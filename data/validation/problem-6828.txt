After they got through the album, they settled into bed and let the TV play in the background. Morgan couldn’t help but share with him what she was feeling, following dinner.
Her cheeks redden and she cleared her throat before excusing herself to the bathroom. The other girls let laughter ring through the room.
“I don’t know of any.” Nat responded honestly. She couldn’t think of an ex of Steve’s or Tony’s that wasn’t mentioned.
Harley knocked by the open door to get her attention. Morgan glanced up at her brother and even gave him a half smile. “Hey.” He began, joining her on her bed. He soon noticed a little black ball of fluff on her bed as well. She'd mentioned the kitten over text. He scooped the cat up, setting it down on his lap. “How are you feeling?”
Clint was unfazed. “He’ll live,” he said, walking away from the argument to put the last of their bags in their car. Clint didn’t blame Steve or Tony for Harley’s doing. He was his own person after all and legally an adult. And so he decided they didn’t need to stay there any longer.
So Tony got up, pulling out a pair of his own pajamas to wear after he took a shower. A pair of matching red pajama pants to Steve’s and the white long-sleeved shirt it came with.
“Win-win.” Pepper realized. Carol nodded and took another sip of her wine. “What’s going on with the Hammer investigation?”
“Maybe we should take a break.” He decided, pulling his hands away from the hold. Maybe marriage was too much. Maybe they needed to take a moment for themselves by themselves.
Tony was conflicted with himself. He lets go of Steve’s hand and he reaches a hand up to hold the back of Steve’s neck, pushing him into a kiss. Steve doesn’t hesitate. He never does when Tony kisses him. He gladly melts into the kiss. Tony’s tongue is slipping pass his lips and searching his mouth. He wants this and soon Tony is pushing him back on the sofa and yanking Steve’s shorts and underwear down his legs to access is hole. Tony never breaks the kiss, only reaching down to unzip his pants and free his dick. Then he’s sinking into Steve and Steve is crying out in pain because Tony just entered him without any prep.
“How did you hear about that?” Remy figured he’d start asking this question now and stop assuming because if she knew, who many other people did?
“Fury is getting dead end, after dead end and it’s been two months. Whoever did this, is really good.” Carol informed her.
“No. Tony I swear to you.” Steve whispered, turning him around so he could see him. He had tears in his eyes. “I don’t know what happened or what I was thinking.” Tony shook his head. How many times were they going to say this lie? “I never wanted to bring this up because it meant nothing.” He glared at Natasha.
“That didn’t stop Steve,” Sam countered. The light bulb clicked in Bucky’s head. That’s what had Sam on edge. Everyone knew Steve had cheated, that was no secret, but he supposed the revelation that he’d cheated with someone so close to him and Tony – someone they called family was plaguing Sam’s thoughts; making him feel insecure. Making him see something that wasn’t there. He’d never have anything with T’challa. And sure, T’challa had voiced his interest in him in the past but neither had pursued it. He respected himself, his husband, his family too much to ever get involved in such a scandalous affair. He wasn’t Steve.
“What do you think honey?” Tony asked her, placing a pair of bunny ears on top of her head that also had a crown on one ear.
“I was wrong and I’m sorry Tony. Sorry for letting someone else in when I should have been focusing all my energy on trying to win you back. I should have never given up on us when I knew I was innocent. I’m still so sorry.”
“Apparently neither did she. But I know we can work it out. I was hoping to start figuring something out with her this morning but…”
I would also love to hear if you guys had any favourite parts or favourite characters or favorite couples and why?
Tony watched as their mouths fell open and a chuckle escaped from him. “Are we sure we want another kid?”
Tony had arranged a day for his female friends to hang out while Gamora offered to host it. It was a good way for her friends to see the new place she shared with Quill. Nebula had stopped by earlier before heading back into space with the rest of the guardians while Pepper, Carol, Hope, Wanda and Nat managed to make an appearance and stayed for the duration of the “girls’ day”.
About 4 weeks later, Steve and Tony had gathered their children. Steve was ecstatic. They’d created a life together from their love and neither of them wanted to hide anymore once Tony had finally entered his second trimester. He was also starting to show a bit. If he wore tight-fitted clothes, anyone could definitely spot the outline of a small baby bump. So, they wanted their children to be the first to know, after telling Maria Stark she would be having another grandchild soon.
Jacob sighed. “Whatever.” Amelia was laughing uncontrollably at this point. “What’s got you so distracted anyways?”
“I think my parents are so caught up with rekindling their relationship and getting ready for the new baby that they’ve completely neglected everything else. I don’t believe for a second that under normal circumstances, they’d be okay with you living here.” He paused. “And if they are, know that I’m not.”
Steve always had a weakness for babies. His heart melted at all the pictures he took with William and he decided to send a few to Tony. Steve knew he would enjoy seeing them and he loved to make Tony happy.
“I don’t want us to get our hopes up.” Hammer could have been lying. He didn’t want them to get excited and later disappointed.
“Who’s Wade?” and everyone in the room turned to look at a blushing Peter. He really didn’t know how to answer that. He wasn’t sure what the relationship was or lack of but he and Wade had been talking almost every day since that day they almost kissed. Wade had given him his number and when he wasn’t annoying him in person, Wade was blowing up his phone.
“Oh good.” Michelle commented. She’d said little to no words so far. “I half-expected you to bring up Harley.”
“Yes she does. Her father just ‘babys’ her a lot. Doesn’t let her do anything that involves guys.” Amelia informed them.
Pepper was too. Amelia’s powers were dormant for 18 years and Calvin had none to display as far as she knew. She glanced over at Nat, noticing her silence. It wasn’t fair for them to discuss something she couldn’t weigh in on, so she was appreciative of Gamora when the subject was changed.
Loki greeted Nertha and then Torunn. “My dear nieces.” Loki never failed to let his brother and sister know how much he preferred their children over them. He and Nertha shared a hug and bowed before Torunn after which she pulled him to his feet and hugged him tightly. She definitely inherited Thor’s strength.
Wanda watched from a distance, her twin parading around with Cassandra Lang. He hadn’t fully told her the extent of his relationship with her. He only stated that he was getting to know her. Clearly, it was growing into more than that.
Anna and Remy were inseparable but luckily, Remy wasn’t living with them. Anna and Peter would graduate at the end of the month and then Remy and Anna would be relocating to a country in Europe to do what they did best - working as hired assassins. They were in no rush to marry or have kids yet. Remy liked to remind her that having Amelia Potts as a daughter was more than enough.
“I keep telling you Remy, I don’t want you dating my daughter. Do that and we’d consider the debt repaid.” Steve provided, squeezing his hand so much, mid-handshake, that Remy let out a groan.
“It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to go through.” Morgan began. “To think that we’d created a life and then it was taken from us…” She trailed off. Her eyes were getting a little wet. “But I know I’ll get through this.” She remembered her grandmother’s words. “Because I have so much love and support from my family and friends.” Amelia and Torunn both joined her in a hug.
William was the 1-year-old baby boy Wanda and Vision adopted. William Maximoff. Wanda and Vision had not envisioned parenthood to be so challenging, but the dark-haired, fair-skinned, blue-eyed baby had made it quite entertaining. It was a joy to raise him and William especially enjoyed being levitated and floating in the air by the use of Wanda’s or Vision’s powers.
“I just didn’t think he would disappear like this. I thought…” and he took a deep breath to prevent himself from crying. He was subconsciously playing with his necklace again before he let it fall back into his shirt. Michelle gave him a moment. Peter threw on a smile and tried to perk himself up. “You were talking about Calvin. Which I guess means you’re finally over Amelia.”
“So where is my favorite nephew?” Loki began and soon remembered the child in Sif’s womb. He stooped down and spoke to Sif’s belly. “No offense. You’re not born yet.” The nephew he was in pursuit of had actually been missing from the party for some time now. Tony and Steve had unwillingly allowed Loki to babysit Peter, Morgan and Harley several times in the past and Peter had quickly become his favorite.
Bucky and Sam sat Steve on the sofa in their shared apartment. Bucky wouldn’t let Steve stay in that apartment by himself ever again. He had almost lost his best friend and little SJ. They would stay here. They’d get his stuff in the days to come.
“I’m dying to see you pregnant.” Stephen mumbled, wrapping his arm around Tony’s middle. He always had a little pudge following his last pregnancy.
Steve watched Tony wipe his nose. “I feel like a part of me knew that while another part kept reminding me, you’d cheated before and…” Tony sniffled. “…once a cheater, always a cheater.” Steve nodded. He believed that too. He couldn’t blame Tony for thinking he’d cheated again. He only wished to clear things up.
“Do you think we’ll ever be like that?” Amelia spoke after a beat. Jacob peered down at her and wrapped his arm around her waist.
He and Morgan spent most of the day out of the city and in the great outdoors by a lake before they had to come back home for the dinner. Nathan’s mom, Betty was going to be there, and Morgan would be joining them as well. In the 10 months they’d been dating, Morgan had only met Betty Ross a handful of times. She imagined it was the same for Nathan with his mother living so far away. They called and texted all the time, but he never saw her enough. That was okay though because he was well aware of his mother’s love for him. And besides, he had another mother living with him that loved and cared for him just as much; if not more.
“Yeah.” He pulled away from his father and turned to his mother. “That’s why you don’t want me hanging out with Wade.”
“Wade is different mom. I promise you. He's a good person. He's kind. He's honest. He's respectful (with me).” He added that last bit as an afterthought. “He's a good guy.” And Peter meant every word.
Almost everyone slept over. Tony had arranged accommodation like he did every year for everyone. They only exceptions were his kids’ friends that went home to their own families once the party was over last night. Steve was just getting back from his regular early morning run with Sam when he caught sight of Strange helping Tony with breakfast. They were giggling and Tony had on an apron that read “kiss the cook”. He seemed genuinely happy. Steve wished it was him making Tony laugh like that again but for the past few years all he ever did was make him cry. He saw Strange press Tony up against the counter and he couldn’t bring himself to look away. Sam patted him on the shoulder, making him turn away from the scene. It was his way of sympathizing with him. Sam eventually left Steve standing there to go freshen up for breakfast and wake his husband and child.
“Yes. You do.” He shot back. “You ran over to her, wiping her tears away like all she’d done was fall and bruise herself.”
He wasn’t. Ending a relationship with someone you cared about would always hurt. He just really needed some comfort right now. “I will be.” He replied.
Jacob released her. “Someone might but you can’t make Harley. He doesn’t even know what love is.” Nertha had to agree with that. As much as she cared for Harley, she knew he didn’t feel the same.
Steve came up in the elevator a moment later. He wore a checkered blue and white shirt and dress pants. He was freshly shaven and his strong cologne hit him as Tony turned to face him.
“You wanted to be sure?!” he asked, his voice rising a few octaves. Bucky thought they were pass that. He genuinely believed they were in a good place again. He hadn’t mentioned this since the one and only time, months ago. But it was clear, that the thought had still lingered prominently in Sam’s mind. “Sam, I have never been with anyone else. I told you this.” He reminded him.
“I was only gone for two months and you live here now?” He asked in disbelief, taking the seat, two stools away from him. Maria then started to make her grandson a plate.
But then he felt as though he was giving up on his dreams. He wanted to get his degree and he wanted to be an active part of S.I. one day. Morgan would be the one running operations, but he had a few ideas to add here and there. Torunn, on the other hand was the crown princess of Asgard. It was her home. He couldn’t ask her to stay on earth but she wouldn’t want him to be unhappy on Asgard either. It was something they had to discuss further.
Nathan stayed quiet sucking on his teeth. That wasn't entirely true. To be fair there were plenty of times where he hadn't pulled out in the heat of the moment.
Steve was surprised to hear this. He never thought in a million years Tony would pick up for him, that Tony would ever be on his side again. Especially after what he'd done in the past and/or where they were at this point in their lives, but he was happy about it. He smiled smugly at Stephen thinking maybe there was still some hope left for his and Tony's relationship.
They did this most mornings. Tony wasn’t the best cook. He wasn’t any type of cook really. Even when Steve was still living with them, Tony left all the cooking to Steve. He was happy though, that his kids inherited this trait and could fend for themselves.
Tony paused his typing, looked up from the screen and stared at Stephen, who’s back was now facing him. “What do you mean?” Was he really getting angry about him texting Steve when they’d just made love?
The crowd applauded. A rainbow of expressions filled the room, but most reactions were positive. Both their families were smiling with joy except for a bitter Nertha and a poised Hela, who whispered to Thor. “You have really changed things, haven’t you, brother?”
They were both silent now. Rhodey was still staring at her. Carol didn’t look away. She didn’t move and neither did he.
“Yes, you can babe.” Steve gave a harder thrust, and bit Tony’s left ear while the bed banged the wall a final time. Tony screamed out, another orgasm rocking through him. His orgasm spurred Steve’s, his hole clenching around his member, forcing him to let go inside Tony. They kissed as Steve stifled the moans that tried to leave his mouth. He collapsed on Tony, their foreheads touching and both breathing heavily.
The mansion was almost empty except for Anna. Tony was at work, Maria was out back caring for her garden, Peter was at school for his last day of junior year and Morgan was setting up her new home with Nathan. “Forgot to mention that I ran into Anna down in the lab, while in search of you.”
“Bye Petey,” he offered before he made his way to the elevator, smiling sadly at Peter before the doors closed. Peter wanted to cry. He wanted to shout. He wanted to defy his mother. He wanted to make him angry because why couldn’t he just trust and believe him. Trust him and believe that nothing was going on.
“You guys are so mean to me. Why am I even friends with you two?” Steve finally got to speak for himself.
Stephen gave it some thought, thinking back to his time at the bar prior to getting home last night. “Yes…” Stephen confessed. “There was a Johnathan Doeran.”
“That can’t be a coincidence.” Harley chimed in. He knew he wasn’t crazy for thinking Anna was up to something.
Clint saw the way Vision stared at Wanda. He knew that look. It was the same way he looked at Laura when they first met and it was the same way he looked at her now, 18 years and three kids later.
“Sorry I asked.” Stephen finished and Tony disappeared out the door. Once he got in his car, he broke down, tears staining his face.
“Good. The breakup was a little strange, but we’ve managed to remind amicable.” Jacob explained truthfully. He tried to sound positive, but Harley could see grief in his eyes.
The girls giggled as Steve’s brows raised with pure annoyance, but his lips curled up into a half smile, after hearing the words he had said to Peter minutes ago. He subconsciously rested both hands on Tony’s midsection. Tony panicked however, fearing Steve might be able to tell that he was pregnant.
And he yanked them down. Eyes now shut tightly because he wouldn’t dare look at Steve now. His legs were wobbling a bit and he felt like he was turning to jelly. He imagined Steve was staring at the part between his legs, absolutely horrified.
“What? How do u know?” Peter inquired as he watched Harley mess around with his phone. Morgan advanced towards her older brother. She wanted to know too of course.
“Why don’t you want to get married?” He questioned, watching as she took the hand from her cheek and kissed his palm.
“That’s the second time.” Torunn noted, eyeing Lila suspiciously. She could sense the animosity towards her and if she had to guess, there must have been some jealousy at the root of the problem.
If Tony was being honest, he was just busy throwing up and fortunately enough he was desperately in need of a bath after all that puking so it wasn’t really a lie anymore. “I took a warm bath instead.” He explained. “Without you.” He added, apologetically.
“Torunn found her snooping in your lab mom.” Harley supplied, wishing he was spending time with her instead of whatever this was.
“Apology accepted mommy, but Nathan and I are moving into our new place at the end of the month.” Morgan explained.
“Winter. Welcome.” He began, she smiled shyly at him. “Azari is so excited to see you.” Winter stepped out from behind her papa, a grin plastered on her face. She scanned the area for her friend but only got Shuri advancing towards her.
“I don’t understand why you didn’t.” Steve chimed in, arms folded over his chest and his mind racing thinking of another child he didn’t plan for.
He came home a little earlier because he was at a genuine loss for words about his father’s affair with Aunt Nat. He needed answers and only Steve could provide that.
While Natasha got the front door, Nathan snuck back up the stairs and into his room, but Nat had gotten a glance of him climbing the stairs and fleeing the scene. It made her mind ponder and wonder if he had seen or heard her conversation with Remy.
At the mention of his name, Harley entered the room with two containers of ice cream in his hand. “I brought pistachio because I thought of your eyes and –”
Peter listened in horror as Friday started listing pieces of information on Wade. “Yes Boss. Wade Winston Wilson. Born November 22, 1988 in Ontario, Canada. Age 28. One child: Eleanor Camacho. Age 5. Alias: De –”
Steve looked almost flabbergasted, eyes widened and he grabbed Tony’s arm. “Tony. Keep your voice down. Your mother and Peggy are in the next room.”
Tony excused himself from the conversation he was having with Bruce. Pepper had reminded him that it was getting closer to midnight. It was Christmas Eve and he liked to make his speeches at a quarter to midnight – 15 minutes before Christmas. As host he liked to welcome everyone collectively; most times with Pepper by his side. She opted out this time around, however and Tony decided not to question it.
Something, anything that might appeal to his sense of humanity because this is an innocent baby; a brand new life. How can he ask him to get rid of the baby they made TOGETHER out of love. “I – I –” he stammers and Tony is watching him carefully, awaiting his rebuttal. “I can’t afford that. I’m 4 months.” Tony isn’t wavering; not even for a second. His mind is clearly made up and nothing’s going to change that. Steve isn’t supposed to be pregnant. This wasn’t the plan. “It’s a boy…” Steve finishes. They were having a boy.
Harley was surprised. He definitely wasn’t expecting to hear that. He straightened up. “I’d never suggest that. You’re a princess after all. My chances with you are non-existent and you happen to be my sister’s best friend. I’d never.”
“Tony. The last child of ours that we trusted got pregnant.” Steve reminded him but Tony didn’t forget; that was only 4 months ago.
“You’d been watching my 16yr old son?” Tony’s jaw tightened. “Should I just call the cops and get this over with then?” He didn’t have time for this. Not only was this terribly inappropriate, let’s not forget it was illegal.
“She knows something.” Morgan concluded. “What if she’s the killer?” She whispered. Another very serious allegation.
Tony decided to fess up further. This was one of his good friends after all. She knew him well. “Yeah, that too.”
The next day, Steve moved in. It took less time than they anticipated which was due to the fact that Steve didn't have much things, they later learned. 'Of course he didn't', Harley had said to Peter. 'He's just another golddigger with nothing to his name.'
“I love you.” Steve breathed. Tony stared at him and remained silent. “I want you to know that you’re the only person I’ve ever loved.” He went on. “I knew what I had. I knew how lucky I was.” He was able to make out a light blush on Tony’s cheeks regardless of the poor lighting. “I would never mess that up.”
"I'm sorry." Harley didn't expect that. What was he sorry for? "Tony told me, your other father left when you were a baby and I get it. It must hurt to be abandoned like that. But I would never try to replace him and -"
. So, they knew how to kill. They knew how to execute their plans; they knew how to get away with it and they knew
He invited Thor to the table and Steve pulled out a chair for him. Loki was already eating his meal and Maria offered to make Thor a plate as well.
“We’re going to the mall with Grandma today to finish up.” Peter informed him, referring to Morgan and himself.
Tony let out a delicious moan. “I can never have a proper conversation with you.” He began shuffling around and Steve pulled back his fingers. Tony was facing him, staring into his soul when, the next words graced his lips. “But I just can’t resist either.” And he forced his lips unto Steve’s, never having to beg for entrance into his mouth.
“I told your father I didn’t need a guard,” Sif addressed her daughter and Torunn felt so in the dark, like they were completely omitting something. She was this close to asking them what she had missed when her father spoke up again.
“You are smart.” Torunn remarked, handing him a gift in return. “Never forget that my father is the God of Thunder; he wields stormbreaker and I carry a sword.” She smiled brightly at him and Harley faked one.
“Don’t you dare lift a finger, mother. Let the guys help you.” Tony lectured. She was a bit stubborn, loved doing everything herself and didn’t like help. Tony was happy he didn’t get that trait.
Steve shook his head at that. Harley had the tendency to “date” outside of his age group quite often; sometimes younger and sometimes older. Tony didn’t like. Steve hated it the most. But he wasn’t a kid anymore. He’d do whatever he wanted to, like he usually did. Harley was always the wild child. “That’s not the point. You just ruined that girl’s innocence.”
And Steve gave Strange one hard punch in the face that sent him flying through the glass doors behind him which led to the balcony and landed on one of the buffet tables and essentially disrupting the party. All eyes were on him as he stood up and realized the entire room of Avengers were only a second away from attacking him if needs be.
“We get that Steve but you really shouldn’t be using her like that.” Bucky was right. He always was. Sharon didn’t deserve that. She was clearly into him for more than just the sex and he didn’t want what she did.
“I don’t know…” Sam sighed. “But what about that M’Baku guy?” he interrogated further. “I see the way
“I do your honor.” Nova steps back to her table pulling out a recording. Tony is worrying because they hadn’t planned for whatever it was Steve’s team was doing and Tate tried to stay cool. Nova approaches the judge, motioning to the monitor set up on the side. “If I may…”
When Steve came to, both Sam and Bucky were freaking out over him because Tony was gone and so was Nicky.
“Are you done yet?” Tony wondered. He was seated on a chair posing while Steve sketched him. He was 16 weeks along with the twins. He’d been pregnant before – Harley was turning 3 in August and Morgan was turning 1 in April – but this pregnancy meant everything was twice as difficult. He’d blown up so much already. He didn’t know how he was doing it but according to their doctor, baby A and baby B were both fine and healthy.
“Morgan is bleeding immensely, Sir.” With Friday’s response over the speakers in Tony’s bedroom came a dim glow of light from above, reflecting into Tony’s brown eyes.
but the people of Asgard would never forget. Thor read his expression and let Loki know that Torunn was his heir and always would be, no matter what the people thought. She was his first born. And unbeknownst to the people of Asgard but Sif and Hela, Thor asked of them to ensure Torunn was crowned Queen after he had passed. His word would be law, even after his death.
The door slid open and Anna walked in. “What are you doing with Natasha Romanov?” Remy smirked at her as she plopped down beside him, the white of her hair falling forward. She pushed the section of hair out of her face, peering up at him with those gorgeous brown eyes, waiting for an answer.
Steve watched Vision searching his face for his reaction. He spoke in agreement with Wanda. “Yes. Wanda and I have done plenty of research on babies. We plan to adopt.”
The question took Natasha by surprise. They’d never talked about marriage before but in hindsight, she supposed she should have seen this coming. They were getting closer to their 4-year anniversary; 4 months off to be exact and Bruce had married Betty way sooner than that. But there were a lot of factors at play for the duration of his first marriage. Bruce wasn’t a ranging green monster anymore; her father wasn’t a Former Lieutenant of the U.S. Army and she hadn’t gotten pregnant. So maybe she shouldn’t compare then to now.
of July celebration/birthday considering where he stood with his kids. Peter and Harley had stopped by to give him a gift and celebrate with him. Harley had wanted to know if he and Nat were a thing and he set the record straight. There never was a thing to begin with. Just a mistake. Morgan, however, was actively avoiding him. That wasn’t sitting well with Steve.
Harley and Peter learned alot about Steve Rogers after he moved into their family home. The guy seemed genuine but the two Stark men weren't going to let up that easily. Even if he had a disability. Besides, he had managed to win over their father so who knew what else he was capable of.
“Nope.” Anna popped the ‘p’ then drank from her drink as well. “Dad’s still in the dumps.” She knew her father missed her mother but not so much that it would drive him to depression.
Steve’s nostrils flared and his fists tightened. “You son of a bitch.” Then he was punching Strange square in the face. His nose was bloody from just that one hit and Steve didn’t want to stop. Strange didn’t fight back. Tony came rushing over, yanking Steve off Stephen and then to help him up. Sam grabbed a hold of Steve and pulled him back. There was a very visible vein throbbing in the middle of Steve’s forehead.
A thought sparked in Harley’s head and he narrowed his eyebrows before speaking again. “Does Dad know?”
“Yeah.” Tony answered. Steve’s mind was now conjuring up images of Wade. Wade with Peter and he sighed, rubbing a hand over his face. “At least he’s being safe.” Tony tried but Steve wasn’t convinced. This would plague him for the rest of his life. His baby boy was growing up, way too fast.
“Uncle Steve has essentially moved in,” Torunn informed her. They all knew Steve had “moved in” so he could be there for Morgan, but they’d feed into any gossip if it got Morgan’s mind off things. “Maybe they’re rekindling their relationship.” Torunn suggested.
Steve whispers a no. He’d never joke about a baby. “I didn’t even know you could get pregnant…” Tony sighs, running a hand through his hair in frustration. He has the other hand on his hip and he turns away from Steve to think.
Wade stopped his food prep and glanced up at Peter. “Doesn’t it take a while for it to actually work?”
“I don’t want to be the Queen of Wakanda.” Winter explained. Bucky wasn’t fazed by her confession. He wouldn’t force that on her even though she had agreed to it before. He only wondered what had changed her mind.
“Who would have thought Harley would be the first to get married?” Peter added, laughter in his voice. Anna let out a chuckle. She’d already learned about her older brother’s reputation.
Thor had remained quiet so far, processing what had been said. He glanced from his sister to his niece, then to his wife. “In our home.” he paused. “And he takes advantage of our daughter.” His voice raised a few octaves.
“So…” Kayla started, “You’re just a little over 9 weeks.” She looked over at the pair. “Not 11 weeks. I am so sorry. I made a mistake. Conception would be mid-May.” She finished.
“Maybe.” Morgan was feeding into it too. Good. “I haven’t seen Stephen stop by in a while. Maybe mom and dad are working something out.” If even one good thing came out of this tragedy, she’d be grateful. She looked at her friends. They all had very different lives and very different parental arrangements. Amelia didn’t even have a dad or a second mom and Torunn had both her parents, King and Queen no less. She had it the best. None of them had to deal with the loss of a child.
Pepper didn’t know for sure if Remy had always been a mutant from birth or if it was something he had recently discovered. She remembered seeing a picture of him at the fertility clinic and though it was over 18 years ago, she was positive he looked nothing like he did back then. But Remy was a mutant and by relation, there was a chance Amelia might be too. In fact, Remy had claimed she was upon their first meeting. He passed a kinetically charged card to her daughter and she wasn’t at all fazed by the gesture instead she channelled the same energy back to the card. When asked what would happen if she didn’t, he threw one towards a road and a huge explosion was the result.
Pietro hugged his sister, pecked her cheek and took William from her arms. The toddler went to him willingly and held onto Pietro as he did to Wanda. Maybe he could have sensed that this was his new mother’s twin.
Peter had overslept for the most part. He stayed up most of the night with Wade just talking and having a good time. Wade would never touch him. The most he ever did was hold his hand. He wouldn’t even return the kiss on the cheek Peter gave him last night. He was sticking to his word and as much as Peter admired and appreciated that, he was getting a bit frustrated at this point. Was he really going to wait almost 2 years before they did anything? He needed to let Wade know that he didn’t have to. He would never tell.
Justin emerged from the rubbles that were the result of Tony’s last blast. He came out in a tailored suit, completely weapon-less and unharmed.
“So your parents choose a bunch of guys for you and then you have to choose from that?” Amelia asked for clarification. That didn’t sound fair. Torunn hummed in agreement.
“Happy to have avoided that.” Hope chimed in. Christie had no chances of having any powers when both her parents got their powers from their suits and Hope was grateful for that.
Nathan and Lila watched their parents converse on the porch. Nathan could see Natasha’s eyes on him at one point or another. He had avoided her all summer and though his father thought he was doing so because Morgan had asked that of him, it was simply his choice. He only felt it was right for him to put some space between himself and Natasha. He’d just discovered, along with the majority of his family that she had caused a marriage to come undone and that was something Nathan Banner could not support.
“Anna.” Steve’s voice rang in her ears again, but she didn’t react as she locked eyes with Tony and dragged the knife half an inch further along Stephen’s neck. Stephen winced in pain. Mere seconds later and Steve realized that Tony was in fact urging her when he saw Tony’s lips curled up into a half-smile while staring back at their killer daughter. “Tones. Tell her to stop.” He asked of him and Tony finally blinked, processing what Steve had said and what was happening around them.
Because if he had, he’d tell Morgan and Morgan would tell her parents. And this was something she wanted to tell Steve and Tony on her own time.
Sam watched as he hovered over his erection for a second, lining up his hole with it. Bucky sat down slowly feeling himself being impaled by his cock. Sam held his hips to keep him in place, savouring the warmth around him as his husband rode him to completion.
“But you didn’t give up. You didn’t give up on us. You tried. You tried for over 10 years.” Tony held back tears. Steve tried to win his trust back for years and Tony hadn’t given in once. “I can’t blame you for taking a step back after such a long time.” Because if Steve was to be blamed then he should be too.
Tony and Steve were just enjoying getting ready for their baby – whose gender couldn’t be shown yet. Their baby was hiding that from them it seemed. Kayla had told them to come back in 2 weeks or more when they’d have a better chance of knowing. Steve was hoping for a girl and Tony wanted a boy. While their other four children were split evenly down the middle about it – Harley and Anna with their father and Morgan and Peter with their mother.
. Tony didn’t plan anything extravagant this year and it was crazy to think what had happened on this day a year ago. Steve let the secret slip. Everyone learned that Natasha was the woman that Steve had had the affair with. That changed things and funny enough, for the better.
“Doesn’t matter my response, you’ll ask either way.” Remy said, idling flicking a card from the stack he always carried on him. It emitted a pick glow. He was uninterested.
Sam decided to try apologizing again to Bucky. He’d been constant with his apologizes but Bucky wouldn’t waver, and Sam was starting to think he needed to do some form of grand gesture to win his husband over. That’s why he was standing outside of their front door but hesitant to knock or ring the doorbell.
Steve hugged her briefly and pecked her cheek as he headed towards the elevator. “Goodbye Morgan.” He almost sang the words. Morgan could sense the glee in them.
Tony was still swiping across the screen on his phone, when Stephen put his arm around him and drew his body closer to him. “Let’s go to bed, babe.” He took the phone with his other hand, resting it on his bedside table before helping Tony to straddle him.
“How can you be sure?” Stephen questioned, looking over Steve’s shoulder at Tony before speaking his next words with pure venom. “He was spreading his legs for you days after we broke up,” He paused, watching Steve’s eyes light up with a blue fire of rage, knowing his next words would set the ever-calm Steve Rogers off. “Like a fucking whore.”
“We find Paige.” Tony decided, pulling back from the comforts of Steve’s arms. He wouldn’t let him forget that they might get Paige back, but Steve felt his mind inflating with worry. He wiped his eyes, before meeting Tony’s.
“I could take him.” Tony teased before he was knocked down by a blast. He could hear Rhodey, agreeing with him sarcastically before he too was knocked down.
Leave me your thoughts in the comments about the chapter 😉 and I hope the anticipated Stony sex scene was decent? 💛❤💙 (Because I feel like my writing has depreciated greatly)
“I think Fury should start investigating us. All of us. Everyone is a suspect at this point.” Carol concluded. Nat stared at her questionably.
“It still hurts…” she confessed, and Morgan couldn’t stop herself from getting emotional. Harley wrapped his arm around her, rubbing her arm in the most comforting way possible.
So, I have this idea for writing a spin-off/prequel of this story but the focus is on Sam and Bucky. If you ship them, would you guys read it?
He hit send and a message popped up indicating that his message could not be sent because he had been blocked. Steve put his phone down and started sobbing. Bucky glanced over at Steve, reaching a hand out to comfort him.
Tony's jaw tightens and he's glaring at Tate again. Tate jumps out of his seat. “Your honor! What is this a trial for attempted murder or custody for a baby?”
Sam did have work. He was supposed to drop Winter at school, come back for a quick shower and head back out. But Bucky was very wet and inviting when he entered their bedroom this morning. Sam squeezed his ass and finally pulled away.
"He can't say that to you, baby." Tony promised him. "He wasn't serious. He's just upset. Remember I told you, his other father left - left us."
“I’m not.” She paused. He held one of her hands. “It’s just her.” Rhodey squeezed her palm gently because, yeah he didn’t want to lose his wife to someone else but they could work pass this.
“Yeah. I may be a little paranoid, but you were laughing and having a really good time with him at the Christmas Party.” He swallowed hard at the last two words. Mention of that party only brought him anxiety and infuriated him. His mother had been shot that night.
“You should leave, Steve. You’ve done enough,” Tony sympathized. This wasn’t brand new information, so it didn’t hurt as much as it must be hurting his kids and surprising his family. He’d tried so hard to keep this under wraps for years. Only three other people had known; only three individuals he trusted. Steve hadn’t even told Bucky and they were best friends.
eventually but for right now he didn’t want to dwell on the thought. Instead he caught wind of Tony’s conversation with Stephen.
“Well,” Bruce broke the silence. “Whatever you two decide. Just know you have our full support. 100%.”
“You mortals are quite peculiar.” Torunn remarked. More confusion spread across the room. “And what of you Morgan?” she went back to the topic at hand. “Things are still good with Nathan?”
Steve and Tony had had a talk. They decided it was time they had one of those family meetings and if Tony could recall correctly, he would have to pinpoint the last one to be about 5 years ago when he and Steve told their kids the divorce was going to happen. Steve agreed that this talk would give everyone the opportunity to say what was on their minds. Tony was hoping this would resolve the kids’ issues with their father. Harley and Peter were almost past Steve’s scandalous cheating revelation while Morgan on the other hand still held a personal vendetta against her father. It upset both Steve and Tony because why was Morgan of all their kids still loathing her father for what took place 17 years ago; when she was just a toddler.
Bucky’s eyes met Sam’s in the mirror, his eyebrows creased in wander. “Why? We’ve only been here a week.”
“Oh. I got to know Friday and Karen while I was waiting for you. They’re cool.” Wade announced; he was sitting on Peter’s bed going through the contents of his bedside table.
Steve leaned out of the hug and gazed down at him. “If you think I love you for what’s between your legs, you’re even crazier than I thought.”
“Stephen. We’re old. I turned 45 in May, remember? We’d be crazy to have kids at our age. I don’t even know if I can still get pregnant.”
Steve didn’t deny him. He ended up setting the pace, directing the kiss but was the one to pull away first. They were only an inch apart, their foreheads touching when he spoke up. “Slow, right?” His hands, on Tony’s waist and Tony’s around his neck.
Across the room, Jacob was gagging at the sight of his parents being intimate with Valkyrie. They’d sat him down and informed him of the nature of their newfound relationship. Jacob acted clueless and stayed quiet as they’d tried to justify the saneness of it all. He resorted with uttering the words Harley had said to him several times on this very matter.
Tony tried. He swore he did. He and Steve found themselves sneaking in kisses and little touches as they fondled each other. Steve had been starved, unable to touch Tony in all the ways he used to for years. He couldn’t resist and Tony wouldn’t blame him. He welcomed everything. They just hadn’t had sex yet. Not because they were saving it for something but because, they were hardly ever alone.
“Hey. It’s okay. I know how much you care for your parents, as you should. But just know that all is forgiven. We’re okay.”
“So me, Betty, Michelle and Calvin are going to the movies on Saturday. Wanna come?” Ned asked from the earpiece in his ear.
“I saw them together a few weeks back.” Morgan went on to explain. She saw the faux sincerity on Anna’s face, and she wasn’t stupid.
“Johnathan Doeran?” Tony tested out the name. He was surprised Stephen could even remember a name and what type of name was that? He might as well call himself… “John Doe.”
"He was awful to Harley. He said horrible things to him, made him feel like he didn't belong with his family. It was just terrible. I confronted him about it and somehow it turned into
Amelia had found her powers to be very powerful and potentially, destructive from her lessons with her father. It was scary at first, not knowing she had them and not knowing how to use them. She always considered herself as “normal” and it was taking quite a bit of adjusting but at this point in her life, with four months of her father’s guidance, she’d mastered it indefinitely.
Morgan then dragged the Instagram tab so Torunn could see it. Torunn was pleasantly surprised. Pietro’s post was a shirtless mirror selfie, all chiselled abs and toned muscles on display.
In all this, Wade hadn’t budged, not even an inch and after some time Peter, unconsciously pressed himself back into the hug, closing his eyes and welcoming the embrace.
“What about good old triple-S?” Harley reminded her. He was referring to the super soldier serum. Morgan had noticed something was different about her and brought it to her parents’ attention. They all to willingly filled her and Harley in when he caught on to it as well.
“Hey Pete,” Steve walked in and sat on his bed. “Michelle told me you went to bed early because you weren’t feeling well.” Steve by pure instinct placed the back of his hand on Peter’s forehead. “What’s wrong?”
He stared at her in confusion. “Anna hates tech.” His eyebrows furrowed, wondering why Anna would lie about that.
he was making his husband feel. He would have taken things a little further too if their daughter hadn’t joined them in the living room
Steve kissed him after and let Tony taste himself for the second time that night. Tony’s face turned red, sobs now leaving his mouth when Steve sped up his pace and his cock rubbed against his sensitive spot again
Being back in Kayla’s office was surreal. It brought back memories of Tony’s doctor visits from all three pregnancies; though the last time they were here for a doctor’s visit, things were awkward. Tony was only weeks off from his due date with the twins and he despised Steve for cheating with Natasha, so Tony only ever spoke to him if it was about the babies.
Sam was in the shower and Bucky almost fully dressed when he spoke again. “Our daughter told me this morning that she likes girls.”
“Maybe she was looking for information on the Hammer case, Mom and Dad did say she could be a target.” Peter spoke up putting the attention on himself. He knew Anna was dying to know what was happening with the case. Harley actually did forget about her being a target.
“Yeah. I love Nertha. I love her so much.” He was pulling on his jacket and stuffing his phone in the pocket.
“Yeah. Not easy at all.” Stephen agreed but still his attention was not on him. Justin knew he had to up his game.
“Yeah. I thought it was weird at first –” Rhodey began. They were lounging around in Tony’s kitchen, while he fixed them both a drink.
“Hi, Aunt Peggy.” He came back into the room, rushing to her side, cupping her small hand in both of his. She used the other to caress his face.
“Always.” He responded, squeezing the hand he was still holding and glancing at her for a moment. He couldn’t stop the smile that crept up on his lips. “And you guys look happy.” He mentioned. Tony rolled his eyes. He was so over his children teasing them.
They were having dinner together, Nathan and Morgan out of the house, when Natasha spoke up. “I got the cutest text from Jaime today.” Her nephew was going to be spending his entire summer with them and he was clearly very excited about it. Bruce and Natasha didn’t have a problem with it. With Nathan moving out by the end of the month, they welcomed the idea of having another teenager under their roof that they could care for. Tanya Romanov-Kozlov knew her children were always welcome in her sister’s home and they loved the Aunt Natasha just as much.
Steve remembered the words clearly. He had attended the trial. “Mr. Stark is mentally ill. He’ll be put in a mental health facility until further notice.”
“Of course.” He commented. He put a fake smile on and let Tony finish getting ready. Tony grabbed his phone and gave Stephen a peck on the cheek to announce his departure. Stephen pulled him back, picking Tony up, pressing him up against a wall and going in for a proper kiss.
Harley spoke up first. “Are you saying Peter is the good child?” Although he always knew Peter was. Morgan always tried too hard.
That was three weeks ago. Since then Sam had been staying at Steve’s place who took Bucky’s side once he’d heard the full story from both sides. He knew all too well how important it was to trust your partner no matter how things may seem. Had he gone to Bucky and expressed his paranoia, Bucky would have willingly consented to a DNA test if it eased Sam’s mind. Steve knew it and Sam knew it too. Instead he did everything behind his back and now he had to try to salvage his relationship with Bucky in any way he could.
“Baby. I can’t move.” He whispered, caressing the side of his face. Tony held that hand and used the other to cradle his belly. “I’m going to come if you don’t release me…just a little bit.”
“I should have believed you. I should have heard what you had to say.” There was a heaping serving of regret looming over him. He could not fathom why he hadn’t considered the fact that there might be some evil a foot. Steve was already Captain America at that time. Heroes attracted villains. “Please forgive me.”
Steve just gave her the look he usually reserved for whenever Natasha was in one of her teasing moods.
Sitting up he was greeted to the sight of an exhausted and haggard looking Dr. Strange, and the rest of the Avengers clinging to the corners of his cot.
"For the longest time I had just wanted to do what was right. Somewhere along the way I lost sight of that" I stated, my voice sounding as far away as my thoughts were.
"Speaking of which. Do you want to go to Club A with me tonight?" Steve asked, willing his voice not to stutter.
"There's being logical, and then there's basing things off theoretical physics" Bruce cut in, stepping forward at the unknown threat in our vicinity, "There's countless variables involved in dealing with time and space. Saying that killing Steve will fix the time stream is only theoretical, not pragmatic"
“Don’t even think about it” Clint warned, pointing a finger in Hulk’s direction as he chased after him, “Last time you ate all the peanut butter before I could even get any of it!”
* So I know that Steve isn't actually in Marvel Noir...But I couldn't resist creating a way for his character to fit in that universe. (David Bond isn't officially in Noir either but I think I worked his character into the universe well too - and yes that is actually what Xavier's is called on Earth-90214).
"....Just please don't leave me for Pepper" Steve pleaded, his eyes changing just as quickly to that of a kicked puppy.
Suddenly a burst of energy exploded outwards, Carol now glowing as bright as the sun, having finally overpowered whatever it was Kang had done to freeze her.
But just as the attack rippled outward, another wave of red energy crashed into Kang’s attack, exploding the room into sparks of red and green, reminiscent of Christmas colored fireworks, before both dissipated completely.
Steve looked at his mentor in disbelief, the burden and guilt of his sins finally falling away from him as if someone had unlocked the chains wrapped tight around him.
Reed had called him in for a secondary opinion in figuring out how to cut the connection between him and the Steve Rogers of Earth-199999.
"The Time Variance Authority. We monitor and police the realities throughout the multiverse and are in charge of keeping temporal interference to a minimum" Spangled corrected, looking offended by Bruce’s misinterpretation.
"What if I could give you that happily ever after with your beloved Anthony Stark?" Loki baited, his grin icy sharp.
While I was grateful for my friend I wished they'd all let go of that stubborn "we don't trade lives" and "cut the wire" mentality.
Suddenly Steve jolted awake at the sensation of being shaken, his hands instinctively reaching out and grabbing onto the arms of the hands touching him.
He knew there would be repercussions for creating another timeline, but logically it was impossible for him to fix two of the four timelines they already created by taking the Stones anyway.
Activating his magic Loki telekinetically shoved Steve and Tony at one another, their mouths slotting together as their bodies collided with one another.
"Just like that?" Steve questioned skeptically, almost positive there was a catch somewhere, a 'but' that was coming.
"Earth-199999 has a tear in it's dimension. Because of the tear Earth-199999 has become unstable, allowing frequencies to escape into other universes and resonate" Reed explained.
With a growl, energy sparked from Kang's own suit, disrupting the electrical net, and giving him the opportunity to create a portal and warp himself away, reappearing above us, his face now stretched further in his fury.
He wasn't sure when he'd started dismissing Ton-Stark's flirtations. When they no longer bothered him.
Mortally injured himself, he could do nothing but watch as Tony's breathing grew shallower and shallower. As his lungs filled more of blood than air. The deafening gurgles as he drowned in crimson.
The man was rugged and swave. Brilliant and not afraid to go explore the world, heart condition or no heart condition.
He had let the government, sharks, and scumbags come between them. Manipulate them for their own gain.
He couldn't see. His eyes were covered with what felt like cloth. The foul stench of chemical stung his nose.
"I meant why you weren't in a cell" Steve corrected, having already partially deduced this Loki's reasons for being here, raising an eyebrow at the sorcerer.
For some reason he felt like laughing at Natasha’s futile attempts to set him up with someone. It reminded him of his Natasha’s ’skills’ in stealth. Ergo. Not very subtle.
But he'd felt the blind panic and horror at seeing the Arc Reactor (not RT) back in the other Tony's chest. The prayers that he hadn't been the one to put it there.
The absolute relief and joy seeing Tony alive and breathing after the Snap. Only for Tony to slap the reality of their relationship back into in place.
And acting like my stubborn, uncompromising, hypocritical, selfish younger self is not going to fix things.
While Steve's soul was revitalizing, while his plan gave him hope again, he would not allow the world to suffer for his choices again.
Honestly he didn't understand why Doom didn't just give Steve his Blessing to permanently remove the threat.
“Hank wasn’t an Avenger in that Universe” I explained, not taking offense to him cutting me off. I knew that Tony’s mind was like a speed-track.
I watched helplessly as the orbs struck each of the Avengers, freezing them in place as if they were all a movie and someone had pressed pause.
Make sure you're reading through all the stuff in the beginning of the stories. Not all of it are quotes. I've also been changing up the writing of how they get the memories in order to keep it interesting. This chapter in particular is important for the epilogue. Reading it also helps with the context and theme of each chapter. I've also added my own little quotes mixed in as well.
"The right thing. You would've been proud. Cleaned up my act and everything" Tony clipped disparagingly, self-loathing practically dripping off of his words.
Steve immediately flung his legs over the side of the cot, ignoring the pain in his skull. Of course he didn’t get far before everyone’s hands were on him, steadying him and pushing him back onto the bed.
Apparently his crimes hadn't been severe enough to warrant imprisonment in one of the Time Cells that were situated above him floating around him in loops.
"He could've had all the Avengers under his thumb. The world at his fingertips!" Steve irately exclaimed, the immense annoyance and exasperation evident in his tone.
"Marry me" Steve proclaimed again, his gaze unwavering as his eyes, burning with a fierce determination, bore into Tony's shocked disbelieving ones.
“That’s enough” Bruce cut in, his tone firm and final, “We may not know them, but they did just save our skins. Twice...And besides...It's not like we have anyone in our universe anymore who can fix this. The only person who might’ve been able to was…”
I groaned at the sharp rapid stabs of pain, clutching my head, desperately praying that this so called ‘connection’ wasn’t permanent.
I watched in a daze as my (not my) Shield ricocheted across the room, squaring Kang in the chest after he had tossed
At the time the other Steve was so sure it had been...But after the Snap...After losing so many because they weren't
Wanda, Loki, Strange, Wong, and even Wiccan were collapsed near him, looking more exhausted than he’d ever seen them.
His ideals were from the forties. His dark humor and rigidity portrayed him as inflexible and not very open-minded (But at least he didn't pretend he was something he wasn't like the other Rogers). He couldn't make his relationships with women work. The one child he didn't even know he'd had turned into a psychopathic killer…
"Now run along and find him" Sarah insisted, a knowing gleam in her eyes, "I have my own dance partner"
Then just as suddenly the twisted rope of red, green, blue, and gold yanked him downwards. Or maybe it was sideways. He couldn’t be sure.
“My attempt to make sure what happened in my universe didn’t happen here” Fury answered, for once being absolutely straightforward.
Steve couldn't help but let out a pleased sigh as their lips met for the first time, reaching his hands up to grip Tony's shoulders possessively.
Standing in front of Stark Mansion he rang the doorbell, using his access codes to let himself in and notify Stark of his arrival. According to the computer he was in his quarters.
That once he held the cosmic cube in his hands he could repair it back to how it was supposed to be.
A Steve who had kept the truth of Howard and Maria Stark's death a secret because he selfishly didn't want to feel like he had to choose between his friends.
The fact that a second superhero civil war occurred even after what happened the first time only proved him right.
"Never thought I'd see you alive again" Steve quipped back sharply, narrowing his eyes at the Trickster.
"Now how could I possibly be of any use to you? And what could you possibly offer me?" Steve scoffed, though his eyes lit with a strong curiosity as he tried to figure out just what it was the Trickster was after.
They had called themselves heroes and yet when the very people they claimed they were protecting cried out in pain and fear they scoffed off their plight, selfishly clinging to
With a final tug he was pulled through the haze, landing with a thump on his stomach on cool grass and gritty dirt.
Sorry it's been a while! I've had a bumpy road this past month and half. I promise to continue posting when I can! I have some catching up to do!
"Well, on the bright side at least we don't have to worry about another dimension's Steve Rogers popping in for a visit" Tony stated dryly.
Steve clutched his cane, his grip nowhere near what it used to be, but it was firm and steady none-the-less.
"I'm just...thankful" Steve muttered out, unable to find the right words to properly express how he felt.
, the manipulation of time and space is child's play. Even our youngest just learning to read are taught the basic mechanics" Kang haughtily scoffed.
going to do about it?" Tony exclaimed, eyeing the marker on Reed's computer that was locked onto Earth-199999's location.
His guilt breaking him out of his trance, Steve realized that Tony was staring at him, his eyes twinkling mischievously as a smug, salacious smirk made its way onto his lips.
I know most of you were probably hoping for more Steves, but when I tried including 2 others the chapter didn't flow as nicely, but I hope you all liked it regardless!
Sam, Bucky, and Carol shifted awkwardly, their stances tightening. None of them wanted to actually verbalize the solution they were all thinking.
Reed had recommended that he rest as Earth-199999's cross-dimensional interference had placed a heavy strain on his mind, but he'd obstinately refused.
"Someone a lot smarter than me once said that part of the journey is the end” I assured her, a soft smile gracing my lips.
Without so much as a warning Steve bent down, his head between Tony and the screens as one hand pushed the goggles away from Tony's eyes and into his hair.
Before, Clint's little quips about him and Tony just seemed like little jokes and jabs at their friendship...But now…
"I've made a lot of mistakes...Some worse than others" Steve admitted to her regretfully, unable to fully believe she could be completely proud of everything he had done.
Natasha slowly knelt down in front of her husband and slowly began stroking his face, praying that he'd wake up.
After Mooster Fantastic had freed up his mind he had actually growled at Pepper when she came into Reed's lab looking for Tony.
“Right. So what’s the plan then?” Carol inquired, shifting her gaze between the different ‘guests’ and trying to divert away from the awkward atmosphere, “Because I think it's already been established that we’re out of our wheelhouse here”
Tony blinked in surprise at the abrupt topic change, suddenly very aware of just how close he and Steve were...And the fact that he and Steve were still holding onto each other...In front of the entire Student Body.
That was how he spent a majority of his spare time these days. Sitting on the wooden bench, staring out at the sparkling waters.
With a firm tug, Tony’s calloused hand in mine, he assisted me to my feet, the two of us now standing perhaps half a foot from one another now.
"Do you expect me to hit him with my cane and say, Get off my world?" I snarked, raising an eyebrow to the brother I had abandoned.
He wanted to call the other Rogers a weak little pussy for his pathetic inferiority complex and insecurities...But he'd be lying to himself if he said that he didn't feel like that himself sometimes.
"That's why Bruce wanted your body after you were killed" Stark realized, finally putting two and two together.
Steve's position as the Head Illustrative Artist for Marvel's: A Magazine of Men's Adventure ensured that he would be the only person ever designing the pages dedicated to the man's exploits.
He married Peggy, taking her last name. Stopped Operation Paperclip. Rescued Bucky. Had two kids of his own. Made sure Tony grew up safe and happy as his "Uncle Roger". Passed on the Captain America title to Bucky. And had Howard depower the serum so he could grow old with his wife, living to see the birth of his great-grandchildren before leaving to return to the time he never should have left in the first place.
Steve didn't know when it had stopped being about standing against SHRA and being about hurting Tony.
A wry smirk slowly made its way onto Steve's face as he gingerly looped his arm around Tony's, intentionally groping his hand down the contours of the other man's arm until their fingers were wrapped around each other's in a possessive grip.
And yet despite them both knowing that it was an inevitably that their secrets and lies would eventually be unveiled, they still chose to allow themselves to self-destruct.
He knew Stark refused to make weapons after seeing the actions done with them in the hands of the dishonorable.
"H-How do you...I deleted that footage. I know I did...So how do you know?…" Tony stammered, looking as if he were one stuttering breath away from hyperventilating.
“That statement’s not helping your case” Sam retorted defensively, most likely not liking how they apparently knew all about us, while we knew next nothing about them.
"I would think that would be obvious" I exclaimed, my voice quiet and frail, but no less pointed and sure in its determinations.
He felt bad for his counterpart. He didn’t seem to have the support network that he’d found at the Academy.
“Wrong? Don’t tell me Kang trapping you in the time machine scrambled your brains?” Clint questioned, though his tone was casual I could see that he was tense.
It may have taken him a long time...And an unexpected journey of self-discovery across the Multiverse.
Steve watched almost detached as Warlock flew off into the sky, into the stars with the Soul Gem once more.
“It’s possible that they used the Time Fog to make us all young for whatever reason. That would explain what Loki sensed, and how despite my age I’m apparently a mother of teenage twins” Wanda muttered from her meditative position in the air, her magic flowing around her as she focused primarily on using her chaos magic to sense and sift through the chaotic energy of the Time Fog.
The feeling of his stomach dropping out from under him as the news told him Tony was gone. And the crushed hope that Tony was okay and on the other line,
"He thinks I'm going to leave him for Pepper, have his baby and name her after a cousin that's tried to kill me God knows how many times" Natasha deadpanned, her voice completely serious.
The other Steve had made a strong show of being assured and confident as Tony spat his vitriolic accusations at him...But internally?
“There’s too much that doesn’t add up. And I have a fundamental dislike of anything I can’t figure out...Yet” Tony piggybacked, looking pointedly at Strange.
I hope you all are ready for a trip through the multiverse! First up is Earth-616! The main Marvel comic universe!
“You’re not allowed to retire on us just yet Old Man. We still need ya to keep the less ruly of the lot in line” Clint jokingly declared with a relieved grin.
All his excitement and anticipation transforming into a nervous lead forming in the pit of his stomach.
"What is it?" Steve hesitantly inquired, just as curious as he was exasperatedly dreading the answer.
the imbalance. So long as this old version of myself is still living the unstable timeline will remain" I continued, having already taken in all the necessary facts and allusions and analyzed the best course of action.
I may not be physically able anymore, but my mind held a sharper clarity and self-awareness than it had contained in my younger years.
Telling Clint that Nat and Tony were 'compromised' and that Wanda was being 'held prisoner' at the Compound.
He and Tony were supposed to dance around each other until the worst of their resentment and regret was driven away with time. Tentatively returning each other's touches until the confidence, the trust was slowly built back through being forced to rely on one another again in the field.
The sad thing thing was the other Steve had subconsciously always known that Tony would eventually find out...And yet he
It was almost painful to watch the Steve of that universe struggle with his own feelings between Peggy, Sharon, and Tony.
It's here it's here it's finally here!! The conclusion of this marvelous journey! I hope you all like it!
His Bucky had asked him if everything he'd done had been worth it, unknowingly echoing Steve's own words to Tony after he'd been arrested for standing against SHRA.
"I'm flexible" Steve retorted wryly, moving his face closer to Tony's so that their lips brushed whenever the other spoke.
Or possibly even just a random drunken ramble by Stark who only knew that single Irish song to connect to him with.
"Tony, you're crying." Steve leaned over and gently kissed Tony's tears away. "If it hurts, shall I stop?"
"How did I get here? Let me guess. You brought me here with the crystal. That's why I didn't lose my memory. It's not that Doom's brainwave coverage has failed. It's that you've taken me out of that universe. I just want to know why."
"No... Unless I am imprisoned... I mean, after all, this kind of superhero daily thing is unpredictable. I mean... As long as I have freedom of movement, I will come back."
"You know what? "The golden mask girl suddenly said. "I think they're right. Sooner or later, one day, you will be that person, because now you are the man."
I was the one who was suspected, the one who was tracked, the one who was hunted, the one who cleaned up the mess he had created, but I was not the one who held his abundant resources. I'm still running around raising money, carefully upgrading an old version armor, and dealing with the various high-tech criminals whom he's been promoting to advanced status. It's not a fair world, is it?"
"Thor and Hercules were over there, gods and demigods, plenty of fire. I'll just play with you on the third line." Steve joked. "Maybe they lost touch because of Hulk. Don't take any chances, Tony."
"It won't be me. I mean, it's Avengers, right? The greatest heroes in the world, I'm just a former criminal, a wandering mutant, I'm just..."
“Let me read you this pile of names, Cathy Dale, Janice Cord, Gretl Anders, Dr.SuYin, Whitney Frost, Bethany Cabe... Either they die for you or lose everything because of love for you."
"Einstein only needed one week of sleep a year, I slept yesterday." Tony quipped, "I said that before, just because I had a bad day, you know, there were some noisy guys..."
"Although I've been buried in snow for the last few days since I got back. Snow is always a lot of fun, isn't it? And teamed with the Beast was more fun. Every time I threw snowballs at him, he would be angry, shaking his fur, crying out that he is not a snowman... And he calculated the wrong decimal point. Fortunately, Tasha called me back in time, or we'd be next door to the camels. Ha-ha..."
Peter's logic was all jumbled and incoherent. Tony was amused by Peter's barrage of questions. His answer was to simply open the helmet. Tears welled up in Peter's eyes and he threw his arms around Tony.
Wanda recognized the figure of Iron Man through her tears. She nodded to Tony, then put away her tears and moved over to Jean. Grief tapped into her potential. She channeled the powerful powers of Chaos into Jean's psychokinesis. The two beams of light interact together to form a mental barrier that fully closes Bruce's personality. At this point, Hulk had become a full beast, a beast out of control. There was only killing intent in his eyes. Step by step, the ground trembled under his feet as he walked toward Onslaught. He went up to Onslaught, banged at it without rhyme.
Then he said seriously: "Cap, I suggest you stay here, keep these guys in custody until S.H.I.E.L.D. 's agents arrived. It would be better for you to take over. Spiderman could come with me. He already has the basic knowledge, it's an opportunity to get a handle on Avengers equipment."
"The good news is that the chaotic space-time energy is all confined in its shell. In other words, if we solve it, we solve the space-time turbulence problem once and for all."
"So, you put on the most difficult pajamas in the world to untie and jumped into my bed..." Steve smiled gently, and his voice was as magnetic and low as Tony remembered it, tantalizing.
Before getting into the car, he turned to Spiderman and said, "Thanks for today, Spiderman, I owe you one. I'll make your spider armor on priority 5 stars."
"I don't think you need to research. I already know who he is, 'Whiplash', a mercenary. What enemy have you got, being hunted down in the street?"
"Sometimes public identity isn't necessarily a bad thing, is it, Tony?" Steve smiled. "As long as you're doing the right thing in your identity."
"Don't you see, Spiderman, it’s not about what you and I did right or wrong, it's about Cap making it personal?" Tony was talking to Spiderman, but he kept his eyes burning with anger at Steve.
"Captain, if it's convenient for you, please sign for my son. He adores you." Said the policeman nearby.
"Cap, the meeting has been cancelled, we're on our way to California now. Our seafloor residents, once again protesting against Marine pollution, threw back a pile of garbage. The coastal villas area was half buried. The Atlanteans armed protesters occupied the beach, scaring people away in chaotic scenes. The government has asked the United Nations to coordinate a settlement with Atlantis. We are rushing to maintain order and protect people."
"It doesn't matter. Anyway, this shop is just a cover to trap blonde cherubs. Lure him in, knock him out, put him in a cage, and take him to the basement. There is a moustachioed uncle in the basement who will tie him to a table and do all kinds of experiments. Are you afraid?" Bucky said as he grabbed Steve by the shoulder and grimaced his teeth in a demonic look.
"I'm sorry, Tony." Peter looked down. "It's just... You know... You tried to set me up with Melony, but I... I..."
"There was a change of plan, and I found that my research could be done here on Earth." Tony lowered his eyes to avoid his.
I'll get her to safety first, Tony thought. He picked her up and flew her out of the burning building. There was an attic in the building opposite. Tony went down through the skylight.
The thief, holding the painting, turned slowly, his young face illuminated by the flash of the electric torch.
"If you ask about your physical appearance, you'll still be the same, your 20-year-old self. But in ten years, no one will be the same..."
"Forget Steve's caveman lessons, Quinjet pilot drill and operations manual, I think that's what every Avenger needs. Plus, we can save a lot of money by reducing the incidence of malfunctioning." Tony said.
"Maybe... Maybe it wasn't a mistake." Tony was firm again. “But I must do what I have to do, and so do you. Because I'm Iron Man and you're Captain America. These two titles represent a meaning and a responsibility that is much bigger than ourselves, much bigger than Tony and Steve."
Steve noticed the light on the watch flashing. He expected it. Sure enough, Tony has tricks on his sleeve. He didn't know how many toys he had confiscated from That-Tony. How his little trick had escaped his notice. So, he went back to the camp, put on the watch, hoping he was right. When he pressed the button, Tony's hologram popped up.
"Thanks, Iron Man. You saved my life again. And you saved my family and the whole valley this time." Kris said to Iron Man, smiling as she walked up to him.
"Tony Stark, don't think you're tough. You are just lucky, Captain America is around to protect you. One on one, you'd be dead now. Don't sleep so well. I'll be back." Whiplash shouted and flew away.
"As a scientist, I believe only what I can prove. I don't believe in theology, nor in what you call 'philosophy'." Tony said.
"In other words, I have to stay for 10 years or more before half a century without computers, no internet, no satellite communications and far away from any modern high technology! Kill me now! Isn't he just a lonely boy who needs company? Can't we send him a dog instead?"
Tony's head was still a little dizzy and his stomach was still churning. Just then Kris appeared at the door of the cell.
"You know, it's a different league. One is the domestic league, another is the international, which is higher. Wait a moment, the distinction between them early before you have been deep frozen."
They were leaning foot to foot against the sides of the closet. It was still dark in the closet, but he felt Bucky's feet against his own, and for the first time Steve felt that the closet wasn't so scary.
At this time, Steve's attention was focused on the crew entering. Thor was still on alert for attacks from the air. No one noticed that Tony was slowly falling down... Until Giant Man jumped in.
Spiderman crawled up and down the walls of buildings on either side of the street, apparently not in a hurry, beside him was the slow-moving Iron Man.
Steve, Level S+ Contact: A level 5+ tornado broke out in Colorado. A large number of super criminals took the opportunity to escape. All the Avengers who can be contacted are on the way. I didn't wake you up. You’d better eat something before you rush out.
"Iron Man didn't catch him. He ran away. But rest assured, you are no longer a threat to him. Iron Man has revealed his plot. He fled to the one behind to report."
It was a girl wearing a golden mask. She provided assistance in a recent Avengers mission, then moved into the mansion. Her identity and history are a mystery. She is a reserve member of Avengers now.
"Originally Tasha had sent Giant Man and Wasp. But Jane was having some problems with her transformation; Hank didn't want her on a mission until he made sure she was all right." Steve was piloting the Quinjet, he said.
"So what do you expect in it? A bunny girl jump out?" Steve walked in through the door. "Sorry, I'm late. S.H.I.E.L.D. mission."
Tony wanted to contradict Doctor Octopus, but he was holding back. It's never a good idea to provoke him now. Tony needed more information.
"Okay, you put on invisible armor and videotaped the whole thing. But I don't have time for you to laugh at my miscalculations right now. I'm trying to find a way to break through the New York City energy barrier, let the outside heroes in."
"Think of it as payment for him to look after my shop. And here's my card. If you need any help, please call the number on it."
As the sun passed by his eyes Steve turned his attention to the quiet city below him, his forces already out and on patrol, maintaining order.
“But they found a way to bring everyone back...That’s not what happened in your universes is it?” Steve inferred, his tone letting Fury and Pym know he wasn’t about to just let the matter drop.
Steve stood unmoving, posture rigid, hands folded behind his back reminiscent of a military stance as he watched the gold of the sun creep up along the horizon. It's rays reflecting off of the windows and steel of the buildings and skyscrapers surrounding the Tower.
The opposing red force also dispelled whatever hold Kang had over Sam, Bucky, and Bruce, freeing them from where they had been stuck mid-motion.
"So that's it? No trying to find another way? We just accept this?" Sam demanded irately, his eyes holding a cold fury at being abandoned yet again.
“Would you lay off already?! You’re already about to get your damn way!” Bucky shouted back at him, his control snapping at the realization that this would be our last moments together.
'It's not possible' Steve thought, his weak heart stuttering in his chest as his adrenaline increased.
Risking a glancing into Not-SHIELD Steve's pointedly accusing eyes I knew the very answer in the depths of my soul.
"What's this about Steve getting mind-whammied by another dimension" a familiar voice commandingly inquired.
Though to be fair their jumpsuit was a gray beige with the TVA logo on the left breast instead of a prisoner number.
"The Soul Gem is...interested in what you have to say...Whether that means She will be cooperative is another story" Adam cryptically explained, opening up the palm of his hand to Steve.
"Thanks Steve" Tony said, giving me a genuine smile, "You make me want to do better. Be better...Just don't let that go to your head too much"
He didn't know if he could live with himself if Strange was right and Tony (and Natasha's) soul was forever trapped in the Soul Stone.
Steve could feel that his counterpart hadn’t wanted Tony to leave. Tony had given him a home (like Bucky, like Peggy)...Only for him to leave him behind too.
"I sent him away after he collapsed from exhaustion. He'd all but pinned himself to your side for the last 3 days" Natasha explained.
“That is correct Anthony Edward Stark 616. While the Chronomonitors had alerted us to Steve Rogers 199999’s infraction, the Judges were content to let Earth-199999 destroy itself and inadvertently solve the issue of the cross-dimensional disruption. However Civil Warrior of TRN634 confronted us with the case and convinced the Judges to send myself and Justice Love to arrest Steve Rogers 199999 while the Chronomonitors start on stabilizing the flow of time here” Justice Peace explained, sounding as if he was reading off a grocery list.
"How about you and I go out to eat. Just you and me?" I asked him, trying to keep my voice from stuttering from my sudden bout of butterflies in in the stomach.
"Marvel!" Bruce called out to Carol, barreling his way towards Kang, knocking away his energy blasts as if they were annoying gnats, his muscles coiling as he lightly launched himself into the air, his single functioning arm reared back for the strike.
“Well now you have all the time in the world...Make it count” Natasha advised him, shooing him back off to the balcony as she served Erskine another drink.
"Come here often?" Steve breathed out, almost like a prayer, a relieved and sorrowful quirk of a smile making its way onto his face at the sight of one of his closest friends.
To go from being heralded as the paragon of freedom and justice. The moral epicenter of all heroes. Of the people.
“I honestly don’t know. I couldn’t tell you if I was just traveling through the different universes...Or if I was creating them. All I know is that when I finally let go of the Reality Gem I ended up here” Fury explained, an edge of resignation in his voice.
"But I think you've kept him waiting long enough. Don't you?" Peggy knowingly teased, her eyes directing him to the other end of the Club before leaving Steve to return to the dance floor with her husband.
He knew his worth. He knew there was more to him then just cannon fodder. That even if he lost the serum there'd still be more to him. Unlike the other Rogers he was confident in himself and who he was.
"That seems to be the word around here" Steve conceded, huffing out a laugh, warmth blooming in his chest at the nostalgic banter.
"And we're just supposed to trust you?" Bucky demanded, his sniper rifle still locked between its target's eyes, "How do we know you're not lying and going to make things worse?"
Steve kind of felt like cheering. Maybe his counterpart was actually taking Peggy’s advice to heart and trying to move on!
It wasn’t Stark that couldn’t tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it. It had been her. Her hatred had blinded her.
After letting Tony believe for the briefest of moments that he had managed to escape, Steve quickly swiped the mouse back to him, tucking him snug underneath his chin, his paws encircling him once more.
“Probably a side effect of Fury using the Reality Gem to create our universe. More and more of it goes away as our universe develops” Strange theorized, still sounding out of breath.
“And I’ll go make sure he doesn’t get sidetracked” Janet exclaimed with a fond knowing smile as her wings lifted her up into the air and after Hank.
And when he'd made a small attempt to maybe try with the supposed nurse across the hall from him he discovered that she was an undercover agent. And soon after that he'd discovered that Bucky was alive, and he'd immediately brushed the idea of romance aside once again in favor of finding his long time friend.
But that was before either of them, any of my friends who'd been Dusted, knew what the serious ramifications would be because of my actions.
"I made the equipment for it" Stark revealed, causing Steve's eyebrows to hit his hairline, "But the government deemed immunization advancements unprofitable so the project was dropped...I left the machine with Erskine…"
Steve's breathing stuttered, unable to catch a clean breath as he gazed upon his Mother for the first time since he was eighteen.
"Why? Because it's you?" Blue Eyed Tony inquired, a light exasperated chastisement in his tone, "Despite me saying so all the time, you're not perfect Steve"
Leaning in so that his lips were beside Tony's ear, intentionally dropping his tenor to a husky whisper, "Well I definitely want to spread myself over you".
The fact that within the confines of the saloon he was so raw. So vulnerable. And yet he hides it behind a drunken aloofness.
“So what does it all mean? That Fury, Odin, and Pym did something to us?” Bucky inquired, not liking the possibility that his mind, his body had been toyed with further.
“Ay. I do not believe confronting my Father would be a fruitful endeavor either” Thor agreed in disappointment.
The voice was so soft, if he hadn't been trapped in a space void of anything he wasn't sure he would've heard it.
Steve stared at the Gem in reverence for a brief moment before he tentatively reached out, grasping the it firmly between his fingers.
Just then, an idea popped into Natasha's head, and the loving fondness in her eyes morphed into a mischievous glint.
"You're late" Tony exclaimed, holding his arm out for Steve to take, "I was starting to think you'd stood me up my dear Captain"
"I've taught him all that he knows. I'm confident he'll be a good lead" Peggy chimed in, sounding highly amused.
"Maybe it would help if we list out all our options and weigh the pros and cons?" Bruce deliberated.
That split second where the world had felt like Jell-O...But if he truly willed it...The Tesseract was
"I'm glad that you believe so Mr. Rogers. It's always so much easier when those guilty accept their crimes" an unknown voice echoed throughout the room.
Steve didn’t think his counterpart even knew how to let things go. In a way Peggy still being alive in this universe had made his counterpart latch onto what could have been, what he’d lost even more.
"I want to wake up every day and see your face next to mine" Steve continued, stepping closer to Tony.
"Come" Sarah directed, leaving Steve little option but to follow her onto the dance floor, a few feet from where Peggy, and who Steve assumed was Daniel, were wrapped up in themselves.
“And if the Time Fog is connected to the Multiverse that would explain why we found a broken helmet that resembled Tony’s Tech” Janet declared, following his line of reasoning, eyeing the Fog wearily. They were too close to it for her taste.
Their hate turned to a rivalry. Their rivalry changed to respecting one another as equals. And his counterpart's respect of the man slowly developed into feelings of love. A fact he hadn't realized until Tony and Pepper finally got married.
"Not in your timeline perhaps" Loki allowed, sounding thoroughly amused as he leaned against the cell bars, gazing at Steve as if he were some animal caged for his amusement.
Even in the throes of a nightmare Steve's enhanced senses usually made it so he woke up immediately when someone either called out his name or touched him.
The blast was unexpectedly knocked off course at the last second as a red and gold suit tackled Kang away from me.
"I was starting to think you would never show up. Daniel's been wanting to thank you in person for some time now" Peggy bulldozed forward, giving him a knowing smile.
Steve's tail swished back and forth in contented leisure as he rested peacefully atop the spacious cushioned couch Tony had added to his lab for the rare occasions he actually made his way down there.
Fighting Tony while defending Bucky, choosing his past over everything he had built so far in the future.
But after being forced to relive the memories of a non-animal version of himself and watch him essentially fail at life, Steve came to the conclusion that ignoring his instincts, like the other him had, would only lead him to disaster and unhappiness.
"Captain Rogers" Justice Peace addressed, snapping the elderly man out of the swirling loop of his own mind, "It is time"
Or did the TVA trap his soul in some kind of twisted jail reminiscent of the nightmares Wanda had plagued his mind with all those years ago?
Mini-dimensional pockets where the worst time offenders were folded into mini-time loops until the TVA judges figured out what to do with them.
"And even when he did manipulate the flow of information, the people around him, he was still too short-sighted. Didn't plan for long term" Steve chastised, abhorred at his alternate self's stupidity.
She’d been tailing Fury since the Academy was basically founded and she still wasn’t any closer to figuring out any of his secrets than when she’d started.
"I don't think anyone would ever mistake you for anything less than a man's man Darling" Tony assured him, his calm nonchalance setting Steve at ease.
Sam's attempt to maneuver away left him wide open for an energy blast to the chest, an opening Kang quickly took advantage of.
Conveniently omitting Wanda's past affiliations and her hand in the Hulk attacking Johannesburg to the public.
"Grow up Clint, Kang could come back at any moment. We need to start formulating a plan, not passing out the popcorn" Bee-Lady chastised, sounding exasperated at us all.
Any other day the reminder of how Tony violated his volition would have sent him storming off in righteous indignation...But now...Now he knew it was just Tony's cruel way to avoid digging deeper, letting Steve see his regret. His pain.
“That is correct” Vision stated, “There was a disruption in the time-space continuum that Kang had used to his advantage and freed himself from the time machine the New Avengers had trapped him in”
Steve lifted his head up to see not only all of his friends, but the entire Avengers Academy Student Body had apparently gathered at their meeting spot as well, concerned for their missing leader.
Steve tried to swallow around the lump in his throat as his eyes raked over the form of the man he had killed.
Steve slowly worked his way through the breathing exercises Bucky had taught him in order to help him with his asthma (Though the current tightness in his chest had absolutely nothing to do with dirt and dust).
"If you say copying their strategy is a no go then we'll just come up with something else" Tony assured.
Ton-Stark almost never called him by his first name. Only ever uttering it depending on the severity of the situation...And each time he did it gave him...feelings...feelings he stamped on so hard it was a wonder how he hadn't destroyed them by now.
Anyway, this chapter is slightly different from past chapters, but hopefully you all like it none-the-less!
God. At the end he and Tony had been no better than the criminals they had arrested and locked away.
Speaking of said genius, even with his eyes closed Steve felt Tony trying to carefully wriggle his way out of his paws so that he could get back to sciencing.
"Memories. Well, another Steve's memories. From what I can tell Earth-199999 has a tear in its dimension. The origin of which I can't determine, but the fact you're receiving the memories of that universe's Steve's life may mean it involves him somehow" Reed hypothesized, still gazing critically as the monitor readings.
"How are you feeling? Any residual transmissions from Steve-199999?" Tony casually inquired, sliding up behind Steve, wrapping his arms around the larger man's waist and placing a light kiss between the juncture of his neck and shoulder, a mere brush of his lips against Steve's skin.
The unspoken betrayal of our "til the the end of the line" hanging between us like a thick gray fog.
"I'm not entirely sure" Steve admitted, "But if I had to guess I'd say the concoction the government gave me and whatever Bruce put on these bandages preserved my body until I healed"
Sure he was no Reed Richards, but there was no way he was about to let that Anti-Hydra loyalist out of the Raft.
"I'm not about to sacrifice all life on Earth for one man. I vowed upon Tony's grave that I would never let anything like our Civil War happen again. That lives would never be undervalued. That no 'disagreement' would ever reach such levels again. We were always best together. That is why I became the Civil Warrior. Tony's tech and my shield. Together keeping the peace. Two halves of the same whole" Steve regaled, his eyes suddenly glinting with a strength superior to vibranium, "And I want the other half of my soul back"
With his eyes adjusted to the piercing light as opposed to the suffocating darkness, Steve took in his surroundings.
When the brightness began to fade away Steve removed his hand from his eyes, melodic tunes catching his ears.
"Then I'd tell you that all it would take is when the Chronomonitors connect you, the focal point, to the unstable branch reality you created and use their technology, enhanced by the Tesseract they confiscated from me, in order to 'reverse' time and thereby 'reversing' the creation of the reality you made, that you will have a split second after being forcibly deaged, before you die as a result of the procedure, to grab the Tesseract and teleport yourself to me where I will then stabilize your dying form and use the Tesseract to then transport the both of us to another reality where you can live out your life with your beloved genius" Loki hypothetically elaborated, making the entire convoluted plan sound as if it were the most simple thing in the world.
"Never thought I'd see the day where Captain America has given up" Loki proclaimed, a mocking smirk adorned on his lips as he strut his way over to the metal bars.
Though if he was being completely honest with himself he'd had a crush on Tony Stark long before the man had created his armor.
Even though he had grown to care for them, they still weren't the people he had fought alongside. Befriended. Suffered and shared pain. Loved and lost.
Blearily I forced myself to open my eyes, blinking rapidly from the onslaught of the bright lights momentarily blinding me.
And what did one of the episodes of Days of Our Lives say again? Love was love. It didn't always need to be labeled.
The moment his knees rested atop what he was sure was the desert's surface he clawed at the cloth covering him from head to toe. Yanking. Pulling. Tearing until the searing sun needled at his eyes, taking in greedy gasps of the dry humid air into his lungs.
"You said that they found a way to reverse what Thanos did?" Fury questioned, almost sounding hopeful (almost).
Steve only momentarily paused at Stark's private quarters, bringing his fist up to knock before he lost his nerve.
"Then what in hell is wrong with Steve?" Rhodey demanded, pointedly eyeing the super soldier currently laying down on Reed's lab couch, his head resting on his best friend's lap, and his arms possessively wrapped around her hips.
Loki had already escaped with the Tesseract (and Sitwell still thought he was secretly Captain Hydra), and Tony had killed 2014 Thanos as well as his entire army.
“They have the best chance of not accidentally making a bigger mess of the timeline” Civil Warrior justified, sounding mildly defensive.
"I promise that I will never hurt you like that. That I will never be so uncompromising" Steve promised, sitting up from Natasha's lap and holding onto each of her hands in a firm but gentle grip, the resolve in his eyes sure and strong.
"Together" Steve said, his eyes still shut as he focused on his sense of touch, on the feel of Tony's skin and the metal of his prosthetic.
"I am proud of you, you know. In case that needed stating" Sarah informed her son aloud, not a shred of hesitancy or doubt in her voice.
"Or are you just pretending, lying to everyone's faces because they followed you, because you facilitated it, and showing regret meant everything they did was for nothing?" Steve demanded, his eyes searching, scrutinizing, pleading.
"I'm okay. Strange managed to disconnect me from the other Steve" he explained, feeling the distance between them like a lead weight on his chest.
Steve rose his eyebrow at her in mocking dread, recognizing that tone as the one she used when she wanted something she knew he wouldn't approve of.
"Well one of us has to have a social life" Natasha retorted playfully, giving Steve a knowing look as she poured herself a skillfully crafted martini and took a sip, "Though I hear you finally have plans"
Steve moved the hand gripping Tony's arm and wrapped it around his waist, pulled Tony toward him until there wasn't so much as a millimeter of space between them.
Somehow I got the strong feeling that if I did he would think that I was just messing with him and walk off in humiliation.
This time Steve did blush at that insinuation. He could feel that the other him definitely wasn’t lying, but the thought of the other him partaking in booty-calls because he wasn’t ready to commit to a real relationship yet, because he was still holding onto his past was, was, was slightly mortifying.
When his consciousness returned, he found himself on his knees, a firm hand on his back supporting him, keeping him upright.
Steve had been content with just being Tony's friend, not thinking that the other was interested in him in that way.
"No...I trust you. I just don't want this to happen again" Natasha admitted, still tense from what occurred only a few hours ago.
Sure enough her husband was tossing and turning, his face contorted in a mix of horror, pain, and sorrow. His breaths coming out in pants and gasps.
After the Battle of New York he made sure the Tesseract and Mind Stone were destroyed, the same went for the Aether after giving Thor a few warnings. He had Carol traverse space to ensure the destruction of the Power Stone. Leaving the Time Stone safe with the wizards of Kamar-Taj, and the Soul Stone to stand alone forever on Vormir.
“Then I guess that’s my cue” I proclaimed, using my cane to help hoist me up out of the rolly chair.
Instead of using Secretary Ross' past transgressions against him. Instead of playing up Bucky's past as a hero and prisoner of war. Instead of using his allies to bring in Barnes rather than immediately playing vigilante. Instead of utilizing Tony's hacking skills and resources. Instead of manipulating PR, he arrogantly thought he knew best and wouldn't lower himself to being a 'performing monkey' again, or do what he thought was ignorantly trust a governing body.
Thor was off-world with the Guardians, and while greatly disappointed he understood grief and making poor decisions while wallowing in it.
For a moment Tony said nothing. Just stared at him with an incredible amount of relief that made Steve's chest hurt at the implications of it.
"So you're just supposed to abandon that person back?" Bucky challenged right back, his form tense and ready to strike at a moment’s notice.
"He fought against everything like a battering ram instead of using his influence to change things. To mould the world into what he wanted" Steve scowled, the fury in his eyes glinting hotter than the star in front of him.
Seeing that it was Reed, Natasha answered the Avengers IdentiCard, keeping one hand firmly clasped onto her husband's hand.
“How did you do that?” Bruce inquired curiously, sounding fascinated, though I could see the raw pain and grief in his eyes having to look at who was likely an alternative version of our deceased comrade and friend.
"Who are you?" Sam demanded, none too kindly, likely fed up with having even more unknowns butting in.
"This was broadcasted to the world an hour ago" Sam relayed, his tone firm, the tension and controlled anger in his shoulders clear, though he remained professional, "Every station. Every channel. Phone, tablet, Apple Watch. You name it, it played it"
"Peggy" Steve said, trying to keep his emotions from choking him up, still uncertain if this was all an illusion or not.
Okay so this chapter is quite a bit longer than my other chapters, so make sure you read everything!
“If it were merely that alone I would not waste my precious time studying the Fog with Strange and the Witch” Loki commented with one of his exaggerated diva eyerolls.
Are you fucking kidding me?! You’re going to let her continue to tear the Team apart?! You can’t trust her!
And boy if anything he was suddenly very grateful that Bucky had married Gail. That he had gotten the chance to live his life.
"And that bothers you?" Erskine questioned, eyeing Steve carefully as he placed his drink down on the counter.
"In repayment for your common sense Kang shall make your death a swift one" Kang proclaimed, raising his fist to the air.
And when a pissed off Thanos came knocking not long after, he was ultimately taken down by Carol and Thor. No casualties.
"Well we know where your vote is" Sam stated, mimicking Not-SHIELD Steve’s movements, and meeting his eyes glare-for-glare.
He'd been boring holes into the back of Tony's t-shirt for the last hour, trying and failing to get the genius to stop what he was doing so that he could take him out to a nice lunch.
"The Gems are their own Beings. They are...finicky. Temperamental at best depending on the wielder. Even a hero with tales heralding his exploits may not be deemed worthy" Adam clarified.
“The Me here burned his world because he didn’t have his Tony Stark to stop him...But in doing so he gave me another chance with my Tony” Civil Warrior explained, looking slightly uncomfortable.
"You're okay" Tony calmly exclaimed, speaking gently as if Steve were a frightened rabbit, gripping what he'd hoped was a comforting hand on his friend's shoulder, "We've got you Steve. You're okay"
But being forced to relive the tragedy of Earth-199999 yielded a small ember of hope within the personal hell of having to watch yet another Tony Stark die.
"Apparently on Earth-199999 I'm a man, handsome devil of course, and the two of us danced around each other in a love-hate relationship. Apparently in their world instead of handling SHRA or whatever together all the Avengers ended up fighting against each other and Steve hurt me in an unforgivable way. And by the time Steve got his stubborn head out of his ass I was already married to a female Pepper and later died fighting Thanos" Natasha recounted with an exasperated sigh.
Sure Tony teased him but he never treated him like he was stupid, and he sure as hell didn’t think Tony thought he was either...But he still felt...snubbed?...Jealous of Banner?
had died. Like an echo of a memory I couldn’t fully reach. Deja-vu if you will...And that me that had died, that version of myself, those memories, that history died with him. It felt like it was a part of myself that I had lost and couldn’t reach” Loki openly detailed, something he only ever did with a close few people. Which in itself demonstrated how unnerved Loki was with the whole situation.
Steve couldn't help the victorious smirk that adorned his lips feeling the shudder that passed through Tony's body.
“And how exactly do we do that?” Bucky inquired skeptically, “Because according to Kang we’d need to kill Stev-our Steve in order to do that”
All he felt was pain. As if he was being shredded as he was pulled along an unforgiving rope across the Multiverse.
"It's not whether or not you make mistakes, but whether or not you stand back up to face them" Sarah corrected sternly, before halting their two-step.
"You know for a genius you can be pretty dumb sometimes" Steve muttered, closing the distance between them.
In many ways his relationship with Tony had followed along the same path of progression as the Steve and Tony of Earth-199999 (Just far less violent).
"Warlock" Steve acknowledged as the man floated his way down to the platform, "I'm surprised you came"
When no one did Steve steeled his nerves, and swallowed his guilt and regrets, willing himself to move forward and stand beside the man whose form he would know anywhere.
Immediately scanning his surroundings he finally noticed the familiar lump laying crumpled and unconscious in front of him.
From the memories he did get of his alternate self all he learned was not to let others (or himself) color his perception of Tony's character...And not to let assumptions and unaddressed issues tear them apart.
"People make mistakes Steve. You've forgiven me" Blue Eyed Tony reminded Not-SHIELD Steve, his voice gentle and sympathetic as he brought his hand up and lightly rubbed at my counterpart’s shoulder.
"Damn right! We're the most badass heroes there are! Between Fury, Pym, and Steve there's no way we can't come up with a way to kick this guy's ass!" Tony confidently declared.
"I know you're a good man Tony. One of the best. And I hope you know that too" I told him, my voice resonating with a gentle confidence.
"And instead of escaping you decided to come here to...what exactly? Because I know you're not here to gloat or pass the time" Steve accused, narrowing his eyes suspiciously at the Trickster, trying to gauge his angle in all this.
“Counter temporal frequency” Blue Eyed Tony replied, raising an interested eyebrow as his eyes took in Bruce’s appearance as well, but otherwise didn’t comment, “We’ve dealt with Kang before so we took a wild shot in the dark and hoped that the frequencies of their attacks were similar enough that we could counteract them”
The arrows spread out in a triangular formation, trapping Kang in an electric net, tazing him into submission.
He couldn't do it. He couldn't live in yet another time where he was left behind by the person he lo-
Everyone having regained their bearings wheeled around to see yet another Captain America and…Tony Stark…
“Wanda!” Steve cried out, trying to get the girl’s attention so she could focus on what was around her.
"I don't need you peering into my soul for you to tell me what I already know" Steve bit back, narrowing his eyes sharply at the other man, not liking how Warlock sounded as if he were trying to convince him away from his plan.
...He’d be more offended if he didn’t think that jab was entirely justified after everything that had been said.
'Looks like I'm gonna be leaving you all again' I thought regretfully as Kang charged the hand cannon in his suit.
Sure he still would've been pissed beyond belief, but had Tony told him what the Illuminati had done that first morning he'd woken up things might not have taken the turn it did between them.
Steve pushed aside the Magazine's latest publication to turn his attention to his newest illustrator.
After what seemed like hours Steve finally pulled away, his and Tony's breath coming out in heated pants as they both greedily took air into their lungs, their faces still no more than a few inches apart.
It was minuscule, but the other Me’s tension eased just slightly under the weight of his Tony’s gentle caress.
But before he could even turn around to stomp his way out of the mansion the bedroom door opened, revealing a disheveled Ton-Stark clothed only in one of his many silk robes.
"Right" Steve heard Tony agree, "I think we've already learned our lesson that the two of us are better together than apart"
"I can live with that" Steve declared, internally cheering louder than the roaring crowd of students surrounding them, "Just don't be late"
* I also created my own version of Pepper's character on Earth-8311 (a potto is a real animal - look it up!), and I gave Tony the last name Steppe since an official name was never given for him in this universe (I thought it was cute and worked nicely since a steppe is a type of mouse).
No. You never really do. You just learn to roll with the punches...And some learn better than others.
“Cut it off you fool!” Loki hissed, activating his own magic to shield those from getting hit by the backlash of Wanda’s spell.
But looking at Tony now, so carefree and lacking the wrinkles and stress lines that only seemed to increase every time he'd seen him, Steve couldn’t help but wonder if this was how Tony had looked in his younger years, before all the stress, trauma, betrayals, and hardships from his time as Iron Man had caught up to him...had worn him down...aged him.
Tony's eyes widened in surprise, but slowly a smirk made its way onto his face, though Steve saw that his eyes still held a wary tentativeness.
Whereas he had failed to remake universe-616 into what he'd envisioned as the perfect world, his alternate self could have succeeded if he had just thought of the further reaching implications of his actions just a tad bit more.
“You hate me because I'm you...And you could have been me” I declared, assured in my determinations.
"I thought you two were together! That she was your one and only dance partner!" Tony exclaimed, sounding extremely confused.
Suddenly a shrill echoed through the air, the shock of it snapping Steve back to reality as the emotions suffocating him slowly faded away.
"Now that sounds like defeat" a familiar mocking drall sounded, immediately making Steve's spine go ramrod straight as his eyes scanned for the culprit.
Not unlike Tony's own decision to keep his mind-wipe a secret from him for as long as he could get away with.
Steve nodded at her appreciatively and forced himself to get up again, steadying himself when the floor felt like it was moving.
Something told me if she actually had a way to fix the timeline on her own she would've gone off and done so already (much like she had been ready to do when we first tried to locate Thanos).
"You did well son" was all the man said, a proud smile on his face as he lead Sarah gracefully around the dance floor.
"It'll go faster with the two of us chipping away at this together" Tony retorted dismissively, his mind sounding as if it were a million miles away, "But go on. I know how many calories you super soldiers burn. Go get some lunch. By the time you get back JARVIS and I will have all this squared away"
"Pretty forward for someone who postures themself as a celibate virgin" Tony teased, his eyes glinting in promise as he regained a semblance of his wit.
Another shiver tingled up Steve's spine. This time in pleasure as he felt the contours of Tony's body against his.
"Not a way to atone. But a way to ensure that other issues do not arise for you all due to this later on down the line" I gently corrected him, though I could understand how he would assume that, "I'm going to die very soon. Be it my old age or some other cause entirely. And I'd prefer to pass knowing that you all will not be continually dealing with the fallout of my mistakes when I am no longer here"
"We are good partners" Tony agreed, raising an interested eyebrow at Steve, wondering just where this was going, and what was making the usually confident man so inarticulate.
“Alright there big guy, you’ve made your point and opinions loud and clear, but take it easy. I’m pretty sure this counts as elderly abuse” Iron Man quipped, trying to lighten the atmosphere and move things onto a more productive topic.
? Really? His Sharon flirted with him...But it just didn’t feel right with her being Peggy’s niece and all...
There was nothing that would ever remove the visceral image of Tony's lifeless eyes staring back at him.
"Tony?" Steve called out, not able to fully control his anxiety over the genius not being where he was supposed to be.
Making his way through the sliding glass doors, it took him all of a second to scan the entirety of the lab, spotting
Everything was blessedly quiet as the group surrounding me waited in anticipation for my vision to focus, thankfully with the serum my eyes didn't take long to adjust.
"It's actually starting to piss me off" Reed admitted, an impressive level of disdain dripping from his voice, "Their dimension is sending disruptive transmissions across the entirety of the Multiverse and they
"You did what you did because you felt alone. That you didn't have anyone to rely on and that's on me" Steve declared, pushing right back.
“You actually called on the TVA?” Blue Eyed Tony questioned, sounding like he was questioning the other Me’s intelligence.
He felt gratefulness. A possibility...But not the spark he’d felt his counterpart have with Peggy. Or with…
Steve paused for the briefest of moments at the edge of the doorway, thinking for sure someone else would cut in again.
“Fair enough” Carol allowed, crossing her arms over her chest as she assessed the two groups in front of her.
"What does it matter? You're dead. And I'm losing my mind" Tony exclaimed with a half hysterical laugh, harshly rubbing his face with his hands.
"Steve" Tony teasingly mimed as he typed and swiped away on his holoscreens, "We need to figure out just what this interference is and if it's affecting anyone else. For all we know it's some hairbrained plot by the Red Skull to swap your mind with a version of yourself from another dimension that is a member of Hydra...Just saying that skeeves me out"
"I've been told I'm pretty spry for a man my age" Steve playfully countered back, lightly scratching at the tips of Tony's fingers with nails.
"Yes we are. Look, I don't know what's gotten into you, but it's me remember? I did everything I did because I thought I knew best. That I would do it all over again. SHRA.
He hadn't considered that possibility. Sure people around the world were still waking up to a newly rebuilt universe, but he figured Ton-Stark would have awoken already by now.
I glanced over where my friends were still frozen in place, their expressions one of horror as they struggled ineffectively against Kang's bindings.
Canonly Sheriff Rogers was killed by Bullseye and didn't comeback. But with Emperor Doom pulling Timely into his Battleworld, and the Universes being put back together by Reed I figured I could take some creative liberties and bring Steve back (especially seeing as other characters in this universe started following their counterparts' progression e g., Apocathery Bruce is alluded to have become the Hulk, and Tony built the Iron Man armor after Steve was killed).
Bucky always did tell him that his mouth, courage, and sheer level of stupidity (he preferred tenacity thank you very much) didn't match up with the sickly body he'd been born with.
Tony Stark had looks that any model would be jealous of. His features were a gorgeous mix of aristocratic and an attractive ruggedness from all his time spent exploring. He could spend hours sketching the outline of the man's jaw and the contours of his body (in fact he already did).
"Who used it on me before he was killed" Steve continued, slightly amazed at the past connection the two of them unknowingly shared.
"You fixed the problem though right?" Carol inquired, her voice a mixture of concerned and skeptical.
"Grief and regret easily clouds the judgement of even the most logical...But it is hope that blinds" Adam warned.
"Together huh?" Tony mumbled after what seemed like forever, his breath puffing lightly over Steve's mouth, "I think I like the sound of that"
“The input streaming into his mind is potentially damaging. He may not be able to discern what’s real and what’s not. You have to come to terms with the possibility that he-”
"....If you're asking us to kill you I'm not okay with that" Bruce slowly replied, his voice a tumultuous sea of emotions.
Suddenly a flicker, a glint sparkled before the sun's rays finally caught the Tower's emblem at just the right angle, reflecting off of it like a mirror.
“...Thanos killed everybody with the Infinity Gems. In the aftermath I happened to come across a Reality Gem from another universe...And I used it” Fury hesitantly admitted.
Tony had told them Ultron shouldn't have been able to come online. That right there should have told them that something more was going on.
Sitting on the deck of a lakehouse, Tony tinkering with some machine as he sketched the landscape, laughing at the stupidity of their younger selves.
Bond had a prior history of hijacking and auto theft, but Steve found himself wanting to try giving the man a fresh start at life despite his shady past.
“No I…Everything’s kind of a blur. I remember things...But...Kang” I realized suddenly, the memory coming back and hitting me like a freight train, “We were fighting Kang”
It took a moment for Tony to recover from Steve's unexpected action, but when he did he returned Steve's hold with earnest, getting the distinctive feeling that Steve was only barely being held together by the seams.
Tony just gave Steve a challenging smirk, unashamed as he felt the other man's eyes rake possessively over every visible inch of his body exposed for him.
Steve made his way silently through the many corridors and hallways. His body already instinctively had the muscle memory to get him to Stark's room whether he was playing attention or not. A fact Stark's teased him for on several occasions.
"Then have JARVIS run the scans for you. If anything comes up I'm sure he'll let you know" Steve gruffly countered.
“You know that what happened with Purple Man wasn’t your fault right? That nobody blames you for what happened?” I asked him.
He should have realized before that Howard wasn't as great a parent (or person) as he was when he'd knew him.
“You don’t get to use his words for this” Steve 616 exclaimed, sounding incredibly offended on my Tony’s behalf.
"Oh I'm going to have a lot of fun with you Captain" Tony exclaimed, grinning like a shark as his pupils widened, making his eyes nearly black with desire.
“You think they used the Time Fog to alter our reality? To fix something that had happened?” Tony pondered aloud, though really more to himself than anything else as he brought his hand to his chin, contemplating the likelihood of his own theory.
"Admittedly the construction of the emblem is one of your better design choices" Steve commented wistfully back, the light tone in his voice a stark contrast to his inflexible posture.
"Wha-You just. Nev-Never mind. Forget I said anything" Tony declared shakenly, pushing off of the desk to make what Steve could only assume was a hasty retreat.
The man's face was contorted in what looked like a desperate plea, with sorrow and guilt interlaid in his features.
“Don’t even think about it. We almost lost you Cap. Strange almost couldn’t separate you from the other you’s memories. Right now you need to take it easy” Natasha scolded.
He had years to fully accept his hand in everything that had happened between them. To let go of his amnesty.
He was supposed to embody the American ideals. The American dream. Freedom. The whole spiel. Get married, buy a house, and have 2.5 kids...
Though it pained him to admit that it took him quite some time to completely understand all his faults in the equation.
Yes they had made some mistakes and people were angry. Afraid. But there was a difference between taking accountability, and allowing themselves to be corralled and subjugated out of fear.
"Well, not all of them right? I mean we're not actually going to listen to Kang the Crazy Train this time either when he was wrong last time?" Bee-Lady questioned, wanting a little more clarification.
An image of a skull and six tentacles splayed across the city, as if laying a possessive claim, showing all just who the city...no...the world belonged to.
Dream him was everything he had wished he could be. Tall, muscular, an able-bodied military man, and even a superhero.
"Steve" Tony exhaled, his voice little more than a whisper, as if speaking any louder would mean Steve would disappear.
"Tasha" Steve exhaled in desperate relief, immediately (and carefully) lunging forward to grasp her in a tight hug around her chest, pulling her back onto the bed and clinging to her with no intention of ever letting go.
"And one of these frequencies resonated with Steve" Rhodey concluded, crossing his arms across his chest.
“So what we can only assume that something catastrophic happened while we were adults that prompted Fury, Pym, and Odin to collaborate to try and correct things, which resulted in them de-aging or even possibly reviving us as teenagers” Steve concluded.
“Kang will not waste his time discussing this matter with you again. You all will step aside” Kang threateningly proclaimed, his armor glowing an ominous darker hue of green.
It took a moment for Tony's brain to comprehend what exactly was going on...But when it did their mouths were a flurry of tongue and teeth. Soft nips and whimpers. With him happily, and possessively, exploring every nook and cranny of Tony's mouth and the contours of his body in ways he never had before.
At that, Tony finally took his hands off of Steve's shoulders...Only to realize that Steve hadn't let go of him.
"You're from one of my universe's branch realities" Steve realized with a start, the answer to Loki's living presence smacking him in the face, "You're the one who got away with the Tesseract"
Leaving Tony in the dark about the false psychiatrist and other Winter Soldiers until a fight was inevitable.
"Trust is illogical" Kang retorted reflexively, "Though Kang will concede that without previous data to go off of it is reasonable to be skeptical of my claims"
"Hey Boss! Guess what?" David exclaimed, poking his head into Steve's office and leisurely leaning his arm against the doorframe.
Steve’s stomach went tight as he gave her a slow nod, trudging the last few feet to the open glass doorway leading out to the balcony where a single man stood out drinking in the sights of the night sky.
Cats by nature had a sense of entitlement that made them possessive over what they considered theirs.
Suddenly a tug tore him away from Earth-199999. How he even knew that was the dimension he was viewing he wasn’t sure.
Logically Steve knew he was only annoyed because he was eager to know if Tony returned his feelings or not (He's waited long enough dammit!).
"...It's a good thing you've got enhanced healing. Your toes are gonna need it" Tony replied self-consciously, his neck just as red as Steve's face.
But he also saw the burning embers of life sparking. Reigniting into a steadily growing flame that was burning out the festering poison.
Steve's eyes traced along the shape of Tony's jaw, the smooth tanned skin, the neatly trimmed goatee, and the brilliant blue of his eyes.
"I'm not asking about SHRA" Steve immediately cut off, "I'm asking you if you truly believe that everything you did. Everything that happened, was worth it?"
Death by being turned into a pancake by the Hulk…Definitely an unexpected way to go considering I half expected to die choking on my own saliva by this point.
But he'd selfishly pursued what he wanted all his life (minus a specific married man), and if he couldn't have what he wanted in his time, he would get it in another.
"This matter is on an entirely different scale. More than the future of a single universe is at risk" Kang retorted, clenching his fists.
“The satisfaction of knowing that your fuck up with the realities in your timeline will no longer be screwing around with the rest of the multiverse” Blue Eyed Tony deadpanned.
Sorry its been so long, I have a lot going on in my life right now so it's hard to find the time to write. But I hope the chapter was worth the wait!
"All my designs are fabulous. Whoever says otherwise is a dirty liar that lies" Tony retorted teasingly right back, slowly making his way across the carpeted floor and out onto the balcony.
And somewhere along the line his counterpart had gotten closer to Tony. Latched onto him as a constant.
“The point is someone used you which gave the Gem the opportunity to take control of your Program. The Avengers of that universe, except for Vision and maybe Thor later on, blamed you for Ultron's creation. You blamed yourself. The world blamed you, even after it was proved that it was the Scepter's doing. And the woman who was the reason you went back to work on the Ultron Program in the first place said nothing of her own involvement. Not even when she became an Avenger" I explained in disgust.
"Of course it does!" Steve exclaimed, as if it should have been obvious, his breath now coming out in frustrated pants.
“The best heroes always make a good entrance” the Blue Eyed Tony exclaimed, a cheeky grin on his face.
“Kang then went on some rant on how yet another Captain America was destroying yet another timeline, or universe or whatever and decided that he needed to inform the Council of Narcissism so that they could deal with the matter” Janet relayed with an unimpressed scoff.
"Now Captain, you will suffer. You will suffer as I suffered" Kang proclaimed, his expression one of sadistic glee.
And no matter the age there was always a spark, a fire and life about Tony that filled every room and made Steve feel like together they could achieve anything.
This wasn’t good. At this rate of degradation it was only a matter of time before another fight began and our common goal lay forgotten.
Having fully charged up his cannon Kang stretched out his arm, his glowing green fist directly in front of my face.
“This is a delicate matter. One that differs from when you had shared a body with Ultron. I can’t guarantee that separating him will be painless. It isn’t like closing a door”
Kang didn't so much as move a millimeter as a glowing green dome appeared out of nowhere, successfully shielding him from the onslaught.
“So there’s a mass murderer of epic proportions headed our way?” Tony asked, sounding like he was running through different scenarios on how to deal with the threat.
“There was more to it than that. From the snippets I got something sentient spawned from the Mind Gem in that universe and it took over the Ultron program that you and Banner-”
"I'd say you were making empty offers" Steve countered back, narrowing his eyes once again at the God of Lies, not liking that this Loki had more than likely done his research on why he was here.
"Steeeeve" Natasha stated, her voice going almost sickeningly sweet as she batted her eyelashes at him.
He'd already been so blind, letting assumptions and his own insecurities come between him and everything he'd ever wanted.
Though he'd never admit to anyone that he was intentionally trying to rid Tony of Pepper Potto's scent.
"Can hallucinations and mirages do that?" Steve challenged teasingly, crossing his arms over his bandaged chest.
That the song was about Stark wanting a different legacy to be remembered by when his soul finally passed on from this life.
"You couldn't have done that earlier?" Sam quipped, looking a lot more relieved than he had a few minutes ago.
When he could finally make out the details of his surroundings Steve realized he was in a modern version of the old Stork Club.
"Aren't a problem anymore" Tony declared, an icy coldness to his tone, the implications sending a shiver up Steve's spine.
But he knew no one would relinquish their rights to follow under his command. Their egos and selfishness wouldn't allow it.
"You should know by now that I'm always right" Natasha teased, giving him a quick wink and a peck on the nose.
Which was why even though it was not the same lake, he would go to the place of Tony's burial whenever the pain and guilt got to be too much to bare...When he needed to feel at home again.
Reaching a decision Steve pulled back from the crook of Tony's neck, and without giving the genius any sort of warning he planted his lips firmly atop Tony's own, relishing in their warmth and surprising softness despite being slightly chapped.
Now if everyone else would drop their battle stances and accept that too they might not have to explain away any damages to Coulson later.
"It was your ballad that woke me up after all" Steve revealed, a sharp honesty in his eyes despite his light tone.
"I figured we made such a good team last time, why not help one another once again?" Loki exclaimed, a mischievous glint sparking in his eyes as he stared appraisingly at the former super soldier.
Her husband was usually pretty careful in making sure not to wake her, especially on nights like this where she was actually able to sleep through the night without having to get up to pee every few hours.
'Very well then' She allowed, 'I look forward to seeing what happens to the souls around the both of you this time around'
intervention for the two of you to finally get your heads out of your asses right?” Natasha inquired wryly.
And yet for whatever reason Stark had flashed into his counterpart’s mind for the briefest of moments before it was flung away.
A heavy weight fell upon the room. Choking. Suffocating at the memory of the man who had been larger than life, and had cheated Death at every turn, only for his counter to finally run out just when he had found his greatest joy.
“Well that was anticlimactic” Bucky stated, acting nonchalant, where in truth his suspicions had shifted from Kang now to the unknown ‘Avengers’ who had
"Such a hurry" a man said, appearing from thin air on a seat at the bar, "You know we never did have our drink"
"He was the only one I'd told about the tests and machine. He'd always had his own theories that the Project did more than fix my health conditions. I suppose he was right after all" Steve theorized.
I wanted to know in what universe that color combination wasn't a fashion no-no. Especially if everyone in Kang's universe had blue skin.
Steve wanted to vomit. He wanted to leave. He wanted to go home to his universe where none of this happened! Where their ‘Civil War’ had just been childish and stupid. Where he and Tony had come together again at the end like they were supposed to!
"Look, Kang is a sociopath and 7-layers of nuts. He was convinced that his universe was destabilizing because our Steve lived past World War II, and demanded we hand him over so that he could be killed too" Iron Man exclaimed, sounding like he was trying to be reassuring.
Steve stalked over to where Tony comfortably sat in his plush spinny chair, blissfully unaware of Steve's approach.
Sure he'd been happy with Peggy. He loved their children. Grandchildren etcetera. Bucky never suffered, and even ended up marrying Natasha (who he'd rescued from the Red Room early).
wasn't it!" Janet accused, pouting a bit at Tony, mildly disappointed and hurt that he hadn't told her that he and Steve were together.
The other Rogers was very much like him in a lot of ways. Stuck in a time period where all his ideals and customs were out of date. A time where all his friends were dead...Except his love who had married someone else. A man he had saved.
"Figures you decide to wake up as soon as I leave" Tony stated, his words phrased like a joke, but Steve could see the pain in his eyes now that he knew exactly what to look for.
Steve turned to see a mostly naked Tony rush out of his oversized bathroom, steam bursting behind him.
"Did you think we would actually laze about as you tried to kill yet another Captain America?" Purple Archer scoffed.
“Kang has been arrested and sent back to his proper universe and time” Justice Peace assured him, somehow managing to sound both smug and bored.
Bruce jumped in front of me, using himself as a human shield to protect me from the blast, grunting as he was very nearly knocked off his feet.
"Think about it Captain" Loki said smugly, looking much like the cat that had trapped the canary as he pushed off from the bars and vanished as if he were never there.
'Bring him back to me' Steve pleaded, not commanded, nevered commanded (he learned that hard lesson the first time), an image of Tony vividly displayed in his mind, 'The other half of my soul'
“-We all came here to help the heroes of Earth-199999 fix their timeline and stabilize their universe. So can we all focus on the matter at hand rather than acting like immature teenagers?” Buff Steve chastised, attempting to play mediator, though I hadn't missed the tightly hidden approval in his eyes at Not-SHIELD Steve's reprimands.
Tony couldn't bring himself to use the full power of his suit to deal me the finishing blow for my selfish mistakes...But in the end I was still stopped from causing more blights against the world by a man in a futuristic high tech suit.
Textbook narcissism?! What the hell kind of bullshit assessment was that?! Natasha would never say Tony was narcissistic...Or do a psychologist's job.
Now sporting an impressive frown, Kang launched some kind of green energy blast rippling out from his person like a wave.
Even in the TVA prison jumpsuit Loki's holier than thou attitude was still more than apparent in the calculated gait of his steps.
Tony's brain blue-screened as he felt Steve's mouth open up his own for the taking, finally snapping back to reality when he felt Steve's tongue try and coax his own into motion.
“He’s charging up a ton of temporal energy. If he releases that we’ll all be frozen in time!” Iron Man urgently proclaimed, immediately activating his repulsors.
Deactivating his forcefield Kang stared down upon my frail, and no doubt (to him) pathetic excuse for a mortal that was responsible for all this work and travesty.
“Just like that you’re good with this?” Sam inquired to her in disbelief, “We don’t even know who the hell they are. They could be criminals in their...world, universe, or whatever!”
“It’s Fury, so I don’t think we’ll ever get any straight answers out of him” Natasha reminded them with a scowl.
“Actually. If you wouldn’t mind. I need to speak with Tony alone for a minute” I asked of the remaining group.
Despite my aged vocal cords having lost their strength years ago, my voice still echoed throughout the room, my tone to the point and unwaveringly firm.
After what seemed like forever, the pressure, the cord tugging me abated. The sudden cold of the tiles beneath my back a shock to my system.
The moment the echo of Reed's footsteps were far enough away Steve turned his full attention back to Tony.
"Don't need to tell me twice" a man decked out in a ridiculously gaudy purple outfit that gave Kang's fashion sense of run for its money exclaimed, releasing the three arrows he had notched in his bow.
Following Bruce's plan Carol launched herself at Kang, going full speed with every intent of cracking that shield open like an egg.
"Utterly starved" Tony retorted, wasting no time in leaning forward to close the distance between them once again.
He wasn't about to profess his love like some heart-sick woman in some equally trashy romance novel.
, he meant sitting in a standard (levitating) cold gray prison cell, in an equally standard prison jumpsuit.
Though the pain from using the Gem had already faded, his legs still shook as he stood, slowly making his way over to Tony.
Tony blinked dumbfounded, his entire body freezing in place as his mind mentally replayed what Steve had said like a broken record.
“No!” Bee-Lady despondently screamed, desperately grabbing onto the hand I had resting against my cane, as if the action would somehow protect either of us from the attack.
Bringing his hand up over his eyes to block the input he blinked rapidly, extending his other senses to catalog his surroundings while he was temporarily blinded.
Bond had escaped from Xavier's School for Exceptionally Wayward Youths before it had been shut down.
Even now an old man up to my neck in the grave, Nebula vowed to return and murder me in vengeance for my selfish actions.
"How?!" Stark demanded as he watched Steve tear off the remaining embalming cloth Bruce had placed on him.
"You're wrong you know" Erskine exclaimed, adjusting his glasses, his eyes boring into Steve with a shrewd intelligence, "Even now you are still the clear choice"
“Steve. Do you know where you are? Do you know who we are?” Pym questioned him, shining a light in his pupils to check their dilation.
In the end all his counterpart felt was complete failure. That he had failed them all...And...And...That he wished Tony was there. That he had somehow defied the odds like he always did and survived.
If you couldn't trust that Captain America had your best interests at heart than who could you trust?
“Now is a death glare any way to thank the people that traversed time and space to save your asses Snowflake?” Blue Eyed Tony teasingly exclaimed, not sounding concerned at all with how Bucky still had his finger on the trigger of his rifle, pointed to the ground or not.
He'd let himself burn for all eternity in Hell if it meant freeing Tony and Natasha from such a horrible fate.
“You have a chance...A chance I’ll never have...You all do” I entreated them as I slowly made my way next to the TVA enforcers.
"Apparently Stark is attending the Magazine's latest publicity event. Probably has to do with his latest and greatest campaign against the Nazi's of the world" David informed him, a mischievous sparkle in his eyes.
Fortunately Bruce had dug his toes into the cement of the floor, bracing himself just enough not to crush me.
"Steve I have work to do" Tony grumbled irately, though even he had to reluctantly admit that Steve was pretty damn comfortable.
you all agree with me that Fury, Pym, and Odin are keeping something from us about the Time Fog?” Natasha questioned skeptically, narrowing her eyes at them.
"You and I have plenty of time to catch up" she stated with a soft smile, leaning in to give Steve a soft kiss to his cheek.
"Kang tires of these games" Kang exasperatedly exclaimed, and began to levitate, green orbs springing from his person.
With his knowledge of the future Vanko and Stane never sank their claws in SI, and Carol was saved before she was kidnapped by the Kree. Banner didn't research into the super soldier serum, though he did make sure he and Tony met.
“I’ve been in his shoes. I didn’t want pity or a knight in shining armor and I doubt he does either. And just because someone is physically old doesn’t mean they get a free pass for their mistakes and crimes” Not-SHIELD Steve countered unmercifully right back.
Before Steve could even feel offended or question what the Gem meant, a searing pain shot up his arm as the world was overtaken by an orange glow.
"Tony" Steve called out again, this time not even trying to disguise the irritation in his voice as he stood with his arms crossed over his chest.
At that I watched in exasperation as Sam snapped out his guns, and a barrage of gunfire, and energy were launched in Kang's direction.
Tony questions immediately snapped a red-faced Reed out of his own stunned reverie, causing the man to swiftly turn back to his computer, furiously typing across the keyboard.
“No I...I saw things when I was in the machine. Another world I think. I keep getting these...flashes” I corrected, trying to assure my Team that I wasn’t about to attack them.
"The soul gem desires souls" Adam continued, testing the broken man before him, "Tell me. If you were willing to let the world burn in your division, than what would you do to bring him back to you in order to become whole once more?"
"Why are you even defending him?" Not-SHIELD Steve demanded, sounding both appalled and furious, "He abandoned all of you without a second thought!"
Said Sorcerer merely scoffed, “Regardless of Stark’s quest to prove magic is a science we have yet to quantify, he’s not wrong. When I used my magic on the Time Fog I sensed the entirety of the Multiverse within it”
"Uh...Sorry Cap I don't know the Charleston. I'm not an old man like you after all" Tony fumbled out, cursing himself for getting flustered.
At another particularly sad whimper Natasha tossed the covers over her legs in order to exit the bed, and began waddling over to her husband's side of the bed.
“Ay. I shall make haste” Thor declared, and with a twirl of his Hammer Thor launched himself into the air and through the corridors.
Tears welled up in Steve's eyes as he surged forward, grabbing onto Tony and pulling his body as close to his as he could manage with the table between them, holding onto his closest friend...no...the man he'd secretly loved for a decade as if he'd disappear at any moment.
To be imprisoned in another universe knowing that your home, that your reality existed but was out of your reach was maddening.
I blinked in surprise as a tiny woman dressed in black and yellow suit outfitted with wings flew into my line of vision.
I knew that when the dust finally settled Tony had still blamed himself for what happened even though he'd been under Killgrave’s control. I had hoped that I’d convinced him otherwise, but…
Steve turned to face the open balcony Peggy had directed him to, and the outline of a single person standing alone in its shadows.
Where Steve had expected to see anger or impassiveness, or even denial at his accusations, Tony's eyes reflected something far worse.
When they finally stopped to breathe they only separated just enough for Steve to rest his forehead against hers, relief and love sparkling in his eyes now rather than uncertainty and doubt.
"He owed me a dance. We danced. I was his partner. Just not the one he was waiting for. I was merely holding the spot until he found the right one" Peggy countered smoothly, eyeing Tony with a knowing grin, "And it's about time you both realized it too"
"Marry me" Steve firmly proclaimed, not an ounce of hesitation in his voice as he announced his intentions aloud.
Steve couldn't in good conscience just sit by squandering the all the opportunities he has to reconcile with his Tony, knowing that in another universe another him will never have the chance.
The moment Reed cured Steve of the coma he'd been placed in the other man shot up in alarm, his eyes riddled with panic, grief, and fear as he gazed uncomprehendingly at his surroundings.
“Isn’t that a little hypocritical?” Bee-Lady countered back accusingly, flying right up to Sam’s nose with her hands on her hips.
He hated his self-possession, his reasonable, his steadiness, and the considerate captain's image. He liked to smash his shields, unleash the beast inside him. In particular, it was him who broke them. Tony could feel his heart celebrating victory, his blood boiling. As the shins of his lower legs rubbed against his shins, Tony felt the closeness of his desire for his naked body. Tony's body trembled uncontrollably as he bit his neck. When his kiss fell back to Tony’s lips, it became so soft and comfortable, he responded lightly. No longer the captive state let Tony put his arms about his neck. It was a very long kiss... The lack of oxygen and the warm steam in the bathroom made Tony feel drowsy again, and he really fell asleep.
"I agree, Cap." So, Tony scrapped his plans to turn it into an electric massage shaker water-bed, and decided to just turn it into an electric massage shaker bed.
"Bucky! Woof, woof! Well, apparently not..." Tony sighed. "All right, all right, my earth, my mess, I’ll fix it by myself..."
It's a gruesome prison where superpowered criminals are housed centralized. Tony went to see Dr. Octopus. Tony didn't take Peter with him. He went by himself. Iron Man's identity allows him to be unquestioned.
Steve smiled at Wanda's stubborn expression. Wanda is such a passionate, romantic, spoonful woman. Only Vision could forget her.
"Then you will continue to oppose my opposition for objection's sake. You'll be angry and rebellious, all you think about is fighting me, all you think about is me..." Steve kissed Tony at every pause; Tony's rebuttal was blocked by him again and again.
As the New Year's sunshine came in through the window, Tony woke up, and he rolled over to the man behind him around his neck and kissed him gently on his lips.
"We were always at odds, always at loggerheads. He was always able to get my goat. The only time we're not fighting is when we're in bed, and at that time... I forgot what we were fighting about in the first place. I forgot everything... Pete, are you with me?"
"So be it. There's one last thing I'd like to ask... Will everything be the same when I wake up? Will some people still be the same, in the same place... For example... You know..."
He has no armor, he can't get in touch, Jane had left in a Quinjet. I’m the one who caused him to be in danger without protection again. Steve hit the ground in remorse.
"I'll take a look at the Forever Crystal management system and calculate... This one started here, and that one started there. Just need to find the key nodes, eliminate the main ripple effects, and go through some minor repairs... Well, for now, you only need to let him get a gift of baseball bat on his eighth birthday."
"As soon as I walked in, I was thinking... When is the right time for me to take you? I mean if the main character slips away at the beginning of his party..." Steve whispered in Tony's ear.
"I can only say that's one of the reasons why the real identity of a superhero needs to be kept a secret. When we take off our uniforms, we protect you in secret around the people."
"I knew it, I knew it, I didn't have to try this time! You're so awesome, I'm staring straight at you. I completely forgot to open the door for myself." Spider-Man Said.
Tony, are you drunk again? Or do you never wake up? Only this time Tony didn't close his own eyes. He wondered if it just happened because he didn't close his eyes. As Steve pressed his lips to him, Tony felt he had been waiting for this moment for a hundred or a thousand years. There was so much enthusiasm longing in the waiting time. So, he put his hands around Steve's back, put his body nearly to him, so close... He could feel the heat from his skin, could use his own chest to draw the outline of his muscles. So, he opened his mouth as much as possible without breathing; He lifted his own tongue, allowed his to pass, allowed it to slide his teeth over and over again; He chased every tingling shudder that each time brought. Tony still didn't close his own eyes. He was afraid to close his eyes, even for a moment, everything would disappear, he would disappear, this Steve would disappear.
"Ah-ah... Bad boy." Cried Bain. She gasped for a moment before continuing. "Will a mad scientist like you honestly follow the laws of nature? Isn’t it that you want to be as old as you want to be? Should I be surprised?"
"It is true as you say." Peter grinned. "What do you find out? What's Doctor Octopus up to on that island?"
"Nonsense, every word you say now makes me very hot." Tony hastened to exude sycophantic enthusiasm.
“There's something I think we should talk about seriously, Thor. I know he has been your friend for many years. He may be more cautious, more able to coordinate all kinds of relations, but I am not him. Well, I'm kind of straightforward, so I'm going to be honest with you. You've been roaming the earth for thousands of years, you know our language, and you can speak our language. So, when you're with us, can you modify the way you speak a little bit? I mean, could you speak human words? I really don't understand God's words." Tony said.
Jane was so happy, drank a lot of champagne, basically danced with everyone until her high hair fell over her shoulders. Finally, Hank stepped forward, helped Jane to the study, which was full of old photographs and memories of their past. Jane drank too much, fell into his arms.
Later, Sharon's death was announced by S.H.I.E.L.D., my relationship with S.H.I.E.L.D. was tense for a while. Once again, I was lost, and wanted to give up my identity as Captain America. And he had too many responsibilities, too many people counting on him. When all the frustration and pressure was rolling in, he always wanted a drink. I didn't want him to drink. He didn't pick it up again. But we both had a second time, then a third time..."
Krats's brow furrowed. He rose and took Mrs. Rogers's trembling hands in his, fighting his nausea from the smell of blood.
"I thought you said no one would bother me, but it looks like you slipped your tongue, Ms. Bain." Tony soon composed himself.
"I don't want any more of that luck. He's a playboy, and I'm not interested in him." Said the golden-mask girl.
"You can make up for your last vacation. They went on vacation a few days ago. You were the one left on duty."
It was well past midnight when the carriage arrived at the farm. Kris stretched and breathed. "At last."
"Well, you don't have to start off with a revelation like that. We don't really know each other very well, you know."
"He has some use as a money-bag, but that's all. He thinks he can buy people's hearts with money, it's impossible!"
"Yeah, almost pierced my heart, caused me to need this thing to sustain my life. Do you remember the name of the person? What is his name? By the way, his name is' Tony Stark'"
As it got later and the kids were gone, Steve seemed to be the only one left in the empty school. He narrowed his eyes as the light grew dim.
"Thank you, Tasha, you're really... I really... Thank you so much." This time it was Tony who was speechless.
"I have nothing to say in this judgment of yours. I just want to ask, what's your idea?" Steve said.
"Yes, I've been getting a taste of his life lately. I'm even surprised how he managed to multithread his way through these messes. You know, I'm afraid I'm going to fail a bunch of subjects this semester."
"It's not a silly thing, it's a great thing. A lot of people will be moved by it. I am moved by it. But you're really not very good at covering it up." Wanda smiled. "Before tonight, almost everyone resident in this mansion knew it. You love him and he loves you. When you both are in the same space, you hardly ever take your eyes off each other. Even if your gaze leaves for a moment, it is just that you two avoid each other's gaze before confirming each other's feelings."
At dawn, Tony returned to his dormitory, took a bath, then went to see Peter. They met on the campus of Empire State University. Peter was sitting on a bench under a tree. It was late autumn. The leaves were scattered at his feet. This is the first time Tony has met Peter without his Spider-Man uniform. He was wearing a light gray hoodie, bleached dark blue jeans, and old sneakers that were gray in white. Taking off his uniform, Peter is an unassuming boy, even a bit of a traditionalist, who could easily get lost in the crowd of individualized, trendy college youngsters. His cheeks were red in the cold air. He had been waiting for Tony for a long time.
Television footage cut to the entrance to the Avengers Mansion, where many protesters held signs that read:
"Well, now is the time for the Avengers." Tasha said with a heavy breath. "Vision, you need to contact all the Avengers on the roster who can come to New York to support us now."
"I did sign it on my behalf, but it was voted on by the resident superheroes. Special peacekeeping members were also elected by voting." Steve spoke slowly.
"Promise me, Peter, that you will read the instructions carefully when you go home, use it correctly, and try not to break it." Tony said.
"At least you're not up to some evil plan this time, so count me in. Ouch!" Hawkeye got a kick from Wanda this time.
"No, I am not. I need you to do more important things. First, contact the Avengers who are out on missions and see if they can send anyone to give us backup. Second, find out why this happened. Third, find a way to unfreeze the frozen people as soon as possible. Fourth, inform S.H.I.E.L.D. of the solution and ask them to assist. Avengers' first duty is always to save people, not to rush in rashly. If you really want to be one of us, the first thing you have to understand is teamwork. Now, go!"
"I agreed with Clint this time, mainly because of the recent skyrocketing maintenance costs of the simulation training room." Tasha said deadpan. "In this case, let's close the meeting. Happy New Year, everyone."
"You really need to upgrade your superhero library. Do you think my name is Ironman that means my armor is made by iron?" As he said, Iron Man fell slowly to the roar of his jet boots. When he landed, he rushed to the unconscious Steve, held his head.
"Now I can fix it if I want to, but I don't have to fix it for you. You'd better use it carefully." With those words, Tony flew to Steve's right, and he hit him with another iron fist. Steve leaned back to dodge the attack.
"Trust is earned, not by tricks. Do you think you seduced the leader? Avengers will be under your control?" Hawkeye went on with his vicious remarks.
"This is better be an urgent matter to the imminent destruction of the earth, otherwise, if I see you, I will... % & #."
"Look, Steve, my new backpack." He pushed a button on the strap, the pack bounced off, his armor unfurled from the bag and fell on him. "I've upgraded my armor. You're going to lose this time."
"Shh... Be quiet. Come with me." He whispered to Bucky, took Bucky's hand and gently opened the back door a small crack. He propped the door with his hand.
It was a rainy night. He lost a bet, would take a toy back from this toy shop, but he had no money in his pocket to buy it. He planned to go in first and try his luck. "Opening" was hanging on the door, but there was not a single customer in the shop. He ventured to open the door. The shop was dimly lit. The space between shelves was very narrow, only one person's distance. Rows and rows of shelves, in addition to grotesque machinery, there were all kinds of frightening models. Green Frankenstein, silver-barrel-monster, vicious Viking with hammer, nunchakus wielding demon, giant ant, scarlet witch with shining eyes, ugly blue orc with big feet...
"Our advanced AI system did discover something. Although the face of the intruder was not photographed, it was found that between 5 am and 5:30 am, the quality of the air particles inside the building changed in some specific locations. By capturing the track of these changes, we determined the invasion route of the intruder. He or she broke through the wall, got into the main engine room, and then reached the 30th floor. If you don't believe me, you can go into our system, check it out yourself." Bain raised her eyebrows, an elongated voice. "And the spectral changes your invisible armor brought were being scanned as well as your route. I think I don't need to tell you the code, Iron Man."
"Like this, or that?" Steve whispered in Tony's ear as he unbuttoned his belt, half dropped his pants, and stroked between his legs. Tony's body became gripped by desire.
"The former Iron Man thought it was the best option." Steve tried to calm down. "Avengers' security priority permission had been taken back by the government several times, including during Iron Man's chairmanship. When he was alive... The former Iron Man had spent his entire life dealing with these politicians and the media, fighting a no-fire war to keep the Avengers alive. And signing it at the United Nations, he and I thought, was the greatest victory of the Avengers in this war. Now that this was happening, if the UK government were to protest to the United Nations about the Avengers' unauthorised interference in its own security affairs, it could indeed lead to the withdrawal of our special peacekeeping permission. So, I want you to make a public apology for this."
Doom pondered. Tony stared at the tyrant's solemn figure by the fire, wondering what he was thinking.
Tony thought for a moment, immediately fired a sonar shock wave at Steve's shield. The sound waves amplified by Vibranium, dissociated the current. The dissociated electric particles bounced off the shield and beat Electro, knocking him back a few steps.
"You know, Spider-Man is a guy who lacks a plan, who is confused with logic, who is slow to react, who is socially awkward, who is dizzy with heights and water and blood, who is afraid of heat and cold, who is afraid of everything, whose superpowers were extremely unstable, I'm exhausted from being on a team with him..."
"Yeah, I told him when you were working on the Jet. But now I know why he wants to keep it down, talk to you in private. The so-called private treatment, is it to point to bed treatment? Can you handle this fairly, Cap?" Hawkeye said.
Tony was so unrelenting angry, he fired reports straight to Steve. Steve ducked quickly. The rays damaged the turf, leaving lots of holes. Iron Man was moving fast. The sonar shock wave hit Steve's face. Steve held up his shield to hold it off. Branches of trees were clattering away. The fallen leaves disturbed Steve's view and slowed him down. At the same time, Iron Man swooped down from the sky, hit Steve with an iron fist. Steve raised his shield with both hands. The acceleration of gravity and the power of the jet boots make this attack very powerful. The iron fist hit the shield hard. A loud thud. A hissing spark. The shield was dented a little. Steve backed away from the impact, leaving a trail of scratches on the grass.
"Don't argue with him. He wasn’t defending you. He was for himself. Launch a founder voting for you? That's bullshit. The third act was his goal. He just wanted to use it as an excuse to get his leadership back in Avengers."
Yes, that's it. He's like a transformer. It absorbs, it transforms, and then it releases. And every machine has an Achilles' heel. Tony had an idea, but it was a risky one.
"So what's happening here, it was born of you, so only you can stabilize it and give it enough energy to resist the squeezing of some other parallel universes."
"You know, though the Whiplash was Tony Stark's old adversary, but I've never played with him. According to the data of That-Tony, Whiplash is a pair, a man and a woman, true identity is unknown, hired killers only recognize money, good at using two high voltage whips."
Tony invited Peter to go with him. Aunt May is That-Peter’s family. This Peter had no family. He is alone. Tony didn't want to leave him alone during the holiday. Peter was delighted to accept the invitation. Then they set off on the long road to Kris's home. Yes, it was a "long road". Tony couldn't wear armor or fly Quinjet, because these two modes of travel would reveal his secret identity. So, he was stuck with the public transportation system like everyone else. Of course, Tony used  some high-techs and managed to get them first class tickets during the holiday season when tickets were tight. But it only made their flight a little more comfortable. It was still a long journey, disembarking from Sheffield to the Tube, then to the train, then to the bus... After missing the only bus to the village of Gawthrop, they resorted to the horse-drawn carriage. The long journey made Tony almost nervous breakdown. This is a waste of life! At the end of the 20th century, why the means of transportation for ordinary people are still so backward? Tony vowed to himself that he would buy a private jet as soon as he got his next investment.
"Met at the meeting. Pepper, Happy, Bethany... There were many more I couldn't name. I couldn't have been in his will. I didn't know why I was going to that damned meeting to know about a life that didn't belong to me. Do you want to know the contents of his will?”
"If you ask me, he should trust the Avengers. They have been his teammates for years and should trust each other."
"Yes. In fact, we all vaguely know what happened between him and Cap, but he never said it, never showed it the way you do." Wanda said, slightly excited.
Paige glanced at her companion, hung her head without answering, and walked away. In the noisy hallway, Steve watched Paige disappear around the corner, feeling extremely lonely. He vaguely knew the answers to some things, but he didn't want to be sure. So he pretended it hadn't happened at school. He was still waiting in the same place that day, and Paige showed up, walking back to the toy shop with him as usual. She was very kind to Steve that day and did almost all the cleaning. Steve never spoke to Paige at school again. He was too afraid, he was too afraid to lose Paige, he was too afraid to go back to the days when he had no friends at all at school. But some things, with fear or avoidance, can’t unhappen...
"No buts! Come down, come, I won't let you drown. Take off your clothes and jump down, or I'll pull you down."
"I... You know, I’m really not... Since my father lost his job, he's been a little... Easy to get angry. He used to be kind. This is where he used to take me fishing. The warehouse next door is where he used to work. He took me to baseball games too... The factory shut down last year and my father lost his job. My mother had to go out to work. They prefer to hire a woman because they pay her half as much, so she can only do two jobs. I almost can’t see her all day... I don't have any friends. They say I... You've heard what they said today."
"Why go so far away? You can do research here, on Earth. You'll come back, right? You'll come back, won't you?" Peter's tears would fall again.
Tony was afraid to say too much to Kris. He didn't know what Peter was talking about, so he calmly said, "Excuse me, I'm going to talk to my teammate Spider-Man about the mission."
You see, this matter was originally very simple. Under my home opening a time tunnel, a group of strangers told me how terrible the future me was... I wanted to do a good deed, to be responsible, to be a hero, to stop my future evil self. But the side effect was to cause severe time turbulence, resulting in a global vision. But that doesn't make sense, does it? Theoretically, a person cannot step into the same time node twice. So, I initially thought that the result of my time travel would only result in the creation of a new parallel universe at this time node. After all, there are many crazy ones who can travel through time, such as Kang. Each time he traveled, he created a new Kang, and then created an infinite number of Kangs in the multiverse. As I read this in the Avengers database, I was struck by the fact. So many Kangs were mingling together was not an easy thing to forget. That’s why I was sure my time travel was just that I created a parallel universe, rather than the goddamn paradox that caused the collapse of time."
"Nonsense, it's noisy but warm here. It feels like home. I appreciate you inviting me and my friend Peter." Tony came to himself. He kissed Kris on her cheek and soothed her.
"I'm sorry, I mean, you're right. It's going to have to be you, not Dr. Banner, to accomplish this task."
"Is that so? Captain, it looks like you've packed all your winter clothes in the wardrobe. Are you sure you don't need to go back and change? Or you want to be frozen into a Popsicle and lie in the Arctic for another 40 years." Frostbite aimed a row of icicles at Cap.
"Oh my God, that's great, thank you Captain, thank you. I don't know what to say, I caught you by mistake, and you..."
Maybe one day, on this very same square, we might encounter terrorists like Hydras who attack Congress, meet Avengers who stop them. The Golden Knight in armor would pick me up from my wheelchair, roar past the smoke and fire, carry me to a safe place, and then vanish in a flash of red flame.
"Interesting, how did he run away from under the noses of the two Avengers, you and Captain America?" Doom lifted his voice.
"You know me." Tony said with a smile. "Inventors, geniuses, have some quirks. We need to go missing, lock ourselves up, and make gadgets. So do you want good news or... good news today?"
Tony did not retort. He suppressed the emotion that was surging inside him at Doom's words and made fun of it.
"Doom doesn't have to explain 'mercy' to you hypocritical heroes." A voice, cold as metal, echoed through the hall.
"I also won a lot of money at the time. They didn't expect to lose to a car model. But it only works once, and as my reputation in underground racing grows, no one is going to bet on my opponent anymore." Kris said with a laugh. "In the end, I still have to make money by being a model."
"I drank a lot. You told me not to drink, but the more you said it, the less I wanted to listen to it. I kept saying to myself, I'm not him, I want to prove to you, to all of you, that I'm not him. I can control myself. I know when to stop.
"I am Mags. We've met before." A blonde came up to Tony. He never knew how to say no to beautiful girls.
Tony pulled Spiderman into the middle of the drawing room. Spiderman trailed behind Tony. Tony picked up an empty goblet nearby, tapped it several times with a fork.
At Tony's repeated and cruel prodding, all the present heroes, except the mutants, finally walked into the vortex. Tony looked at the energy gauge... Again, he wanted to open his mask and rub his eyebrows. Since X-Men have to maintain the shield, and the New York City energy barrier caused many of the surrounding heroes to fail to arrive in time, so even if Tony walked in, it wouldn't be enough.
"We'll talk when you cool off." Steve turned around, crossed the lane on his right into another street. Other rays fell down from the sky, caving in the road in front of Steve.
Tony sat and watched. Now and then he turned sideways away from some of the bowls, plates, and syringes that had been blown away in the battle.
Oh, and one more thing, I've been doing some serious reading lately. Your actual age is just a few years older than me. You were only 22 when you were frozen in the ice. You can't just add on the years you've been frozen. He was 23 when he found you, so you're actually younger than him. You just like to play 'vicissitudes.'"
Mr. Leonard, Level A Contact: We are very interested in the Starktron project we discussed last time. If you can provide us with further proposals, we will consider funding.
With that, Tony pushed the button on his backpack and flew out as Iron Man. Peter stood at the window and scratched his head as he watched the knight vanish into the night. The task of "make up a story" is too difficult to carry out, Peter is thinking of.
"Thieves! Don't try to run!" The guard shouted, instantly triggering the alarm. The thieves, who appeared to be familiar with the museum's construction, had already made their way to the unblocked exits. The guard who arrived later only caught the one in front of him holding the painting.
"You're not the only one watching from behind a mask at this party. You haven't looked away from him all night. But when he got what he wanted, he forgot about you." The gold-mask girl continued with a sigh. "Whoever you really are, remember what I say ‘he's a playboy, anyone who falls in love with him has no end’."
“But anyway, today proves you're being watched. You have to take some fighting training. In this way, you can protect yourself without armor. The one behind Whiplash won't stop.”
Wanda came, sat down next to Tasha. She wore a long red frock, narrow and strapless, with her long curls pulled back from her red headband.
“He's a bad guy. Why should I tell the truth? I told him that to let his guard down so I could put on my armor before he noticed. If you didn't make it, I must have a plan B."
Tony felt his hands clenched tighter by Steve, and the palms of his hands were wet with sweat. Then there was more pain, and then there was a thrill of pleasure in the pain. Tony's body caught the thrill and found the rhythm to chase it, and more pleasure came over it. Groans of joy and sobs leaked out of Tony's mouth.
Tony got up. The quilt slid off. His naked body was speckled with scarlet. The sight made Steve's eyes narrow.
"Now? I don't want to avoid you, since you said the relationship you and he, not like the relationship they and he. Old Man."
"Still not too many clues, only know that the opponent should be held a high-tech tiger. That doesn't narrow things down much. A.I.M., Zodiac, Hydra... And some of Tony's old enemies. Hammer, Nefaria, Bain, Mandarin..."
"I don't know if I should be glad to avoid her science class. Because of this situation, she won't be able to recognize me and ask questions about where I've been for the last 10 years."
"There are no superheroes, only monsters, like Frankenstein or werewolves. I didn't even know there were 'superheroes' in the world until you started talking about them."
"Yes, yes, man out of date. Who added these courses? You can train him if they become required courses, right? Because I really can't figure out why I would want to accept this training actively."
"You said you didn't make the black circle. If that was true, why did only the Zodiac agents were able to move around in the circle at that time, all other equipment failed?"
"I hate you, and I hate me. I mean, I hate myself, too, but mostly I hate you. Don't think you'll get off lightly. Remember? I made you. You were born out of my idea. You were supposed to be perfect, but you were perfect for about five minutes. Look what you've done, what you've done to my best friend, Rebel. It's just you and me, one-on-one, and I'm gonna rip you apart until I figure out what's going on. Either way, you and I are both responsible, and I won't stop until I find out."
One came from the tennis coach, asking him the reason for another absence. Tony just deleted the message.
Just as he had turned into a rarely visited street, a line of rays had fallen from the sky; The road suddenly became potholed. He reacted quickly, braked hard, swung the motorbike. The wheels careened to the ground; sparks flew with a creak.
