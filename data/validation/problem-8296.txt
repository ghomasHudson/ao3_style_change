"Everyone is waiting outside, they wanted to see the pup, but he starts crying when he saw them." Steve said which made Tony look at his baby who was playing with the Shield, so that's why the Alpha brought the Shield, to calm the pup down, Tony nods at that and turns to the Alpha who cleared his throat. "Pepper and Colonel Rhodes are waiting outside too." That made Tony gasp and look at the door with teary eyes, Pepper and Rhodey were here! He couldn't believe his ears, he had thought that the two of them had forgotten about him, but Steve was saying that they were here.
The sound of the girlish scream in the mansion made Tony pause in his place and frown, wondering who in the hell was that woman inside his house, no one ever entered this wretched mansion ever since Rogers arrived here, and all of his cleaning staff quit, so the only logical thing that left for Tony, is that someone was idiot enough to have broken into his house. "Hey, J, did someone break into the house or what? Where did that scream come from?" Tony asked as he let go of the wrench in his hand, his words though were met with a long pause before the A.I. finally spoke.
And that was a mistake because not a few seconds after that, a shape rises up from the lake. A head cocked to one side, its features obscured by a tangle of dirty hair, lake water dripping down its broad shoulders. It crawls forward, hands digging into the dirt for purchase as it drags itself along, the dying fire limning its moon-pale skin, as the creature dragged the lower half of its body out of the water. The weight of its body sliding across the grass is a low susurrus, its trailing legs gouging into the dirt as he climbs up, moving slowly towards the fire bit.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, a little bit of violence, feelings, fluff; And Steve being a BAMF… And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"… Didn't know that you use inhalers?" Steve said trying to change the subject, which Tony didn't care about much because it meant that Tony had won this battle, which caused him to relax a little, taking his inhaler from Steve outstretched hand.
"Of course, Sir, what did you expect? And by the way, excuse me for being rude, but who are you?" Steven blinked at that lips twitching up into a smile against himself, the real Jarvis was really as sassy as the AI version of him; Steven saw the older or was he younger man? Look at him with suspicion in his face, which caused Steven to clear his throat.
"Where the Avengers called out yesterday?" The pups asked wanting to know what was so important that the Alpha didn't show up, the Alpha gave a pained smile at that and nod his head, hoping that his boy will understand that Tony didn't mean to break their promise, he never wanted to break their promise, and he hated himself for doing it. "Who were you fighting?" Peter asked as he tilted his head, and Tony, no matter how much, aunt Peggy told him to keep what happened yesterday a secret, the wide eyes of his son as he looked at Tony was too much, it made the Alpha want to pull the baby back in his arms and hold him tightly, never letting go.
"Do you want me to bring you something? Food, water, aunt Peggy? I'm sure that you are tired from sleeping without moving an inch for two weeks, but maybe you should return to sleep, I mean it's probably good for you, but maybe not, I'm afraid of Mr. Hyde coming back, so maybe I will lock you in, what do you think?" Tony teased just to be a little shit, which caused Steven to laugh and shake his head, throwing Tony a warm look that made the Omega puff his chest in pride…
It made his nerves fry when the woman asked him to talk a little about himself. "Just give me a break!" Tony snapped as he stood up, Maria standing with him, looking a bit concern and scared, the doctor to Tony's dismay, was looking at him with a calm look, only making the anger rise inside of him. "So what? I got kidnapped; I got tortured, fell into heat and then was pupped! So what? You have no right to ask me what I feel about it, it was horrible, it was scary, and I thought that all of my family had died! So don't tell me to describe my fucking feelings to you!" Tony snapped as he rushed out of the room, ignoring Maria's calls.
Tony bit his lips, narrowing his eyes at the codes that flash in front of his face; the screen light up as the codes kept streaming before him, causing Tony to let out a sigh through his nose. It was a week since his heart to heart with Peter, a week since Tony realized that the Avengers can't beat Thanos with just luck and trying to recruit any superhero their eyes fell on, a week since Tony realized that they needed a backup plan. A plan that Tony thinks he gets the handle of… in theory at least.
Tony let out a shaky sigh as he finally reached his destroyed mansion; his nerves were stilled being fried as he remembered the horrible screams that he was subjected to listen to for an hour before he finally managed to make his escape. Tony wonders what Natasha was going to do once she learns that her workplace was destroyed and that Fury is possibly dead; Tony hoped that she wasn't going to kill him and would be content by being angry at Steve, but knowing his luck, Tony knew that this was just a wistful wish.
"Tomorrow 's 'is birthdays… 20…" Howard said making Steve stop for a second then continued to walk toward his room he doesn't have the heart to wake up Maria from her sleep, when he reached his room, Steve laid Howard on the bed and took his shoes and jacket off so he can sleep more comfortably. After Steve was sure that Howard won't roll over and hurt himself, Steve left to clean the mess Howard left behind…
daughter? Because the last time I checked, only Steven Goddammit Rogers has the same blue eyes as her!" Tony shouted, ignoring the looks that Peggy and Bucky were throwing at each other than at him.
"All this time…" Howard muttered making Tony lean away from his father last the man went crazy. "He is alive, Peggy! Steve is alive!" Howard said making Peggy gasp and followed Howard who ran to his lap leaving everyone confused,
Tony could only groan in pain when Fury launched on complaining once again, snapping and hissing and accusing Tony of being reckless as hell; oh God, could Fury shut up? "Do you know how hard it was to quiet the media down, Stark? Everyone is going crazy about you marrying an Addams, which by the way is something that never happened in the past 100 years!" Fury snarled, causing Tony to let out a huff, leaning back in his chair and holding the bridge of his nose.
It seems that Steve was able to pick up on his discomfort as he touched his hand gently which pulled Tony's attention to him. "Everything is going to be alright, they are not going to reach us; Shield is already taking care of that." Steve whispered in his ear gently while pointing toward the number of men and women in Shield's uniform getting led on by Natasha as she was snapping orders left and right steering the reporters away from the limo and stopping them from entering the mansion's ground.
The trees had been cut down around the path leading up to the house, so it sat in a clearing, there had once been a garden of some kind it seems, but now the flowerbeds were choked with weeds and the grass has gone to seed, but Tony was sure that he will be able to restore the garden in no time, though maybe he will leave that to after autumn and winter pass. The house was smaller than Tony had expected from the outside but it looked homey, a small building with a porch out front overlooking the lake. By the shore, there was a deck, the wooden boards jutting out over the water, it was worn but still in a good condition, and a small stretch of private beach sloping down into the still, dark water... a house with so many potentials.
"Yeah, I did… but do you know what's more fun though?" Tony asked, a wide grin stretching on his lips as he raised one of his hands, and dangling from one of his fingers were metal cuffs that caught the attention of his husband, who let out a dark and joyful laugh of his own…
"S.H.I.E.L.D. was destroyed." Stated Tony with a deadpanned look, already saying 'fuck it' to his life, after all, why does it matter what he does? He was going to die one day because of either a heart attack thanks to The Addams Family, or he was going to get killed thanks to his friends. The collective shriek of '
He wanted to scream.
Tony let out a content hum when the warmth held into him a little bit tightly… which made Tony let out a shriek as he pushed himself away from the source of the warmth that was enveloping him not a few seconds ago, keeping the chills away. "Good morning,
Though it did get better when Steve eventually arrived home, a day before the heat was scheduled to hit, which Tony though nearly dance of elation at the thought of Steve finally arriving home, Tony fidgeted as he stopped in front of Steve's old bedroom struggling to pick up the courage to enter and ask Steve the questioned that raged in his mind for days now…
Steve sniffled under his blanket, gazing blankly at the TV in front of him but not actually seeing anything. Steve was drained, he was so drained and he just wanted to go back home… home where he and Tony were still carefree and didn't have the problems they were forced into at the moment; back before Howard, and Tony working to become the next CEO, back before the stalker and the phone calls and the terrorist attack… back before he was pregnant and meeting Bucky… just back. If Steve had it his way, he would wish to be back before even meeting Tony and stop himself from falling for that jerk if this is how it was going to end between them.
Anthony remembered screaming Steve's name, as he runs into their bedroom and opened the closet, he nearly starts sobbing as he saw that Steve's clothes were no longer there, he runs around the house praying to God that this was just misunderstanding and that Steve is going to be back soon, that there is something left to assure Anthony that Steve would be back soon. It ends up with his father knocking the door an hour later with a sour look on his face, it ends up with his father telling him that one of Anthony's play toy came to him and demand money or he will expose him, it ends up with Anthony being told that it was Steve… Anthony never believed his father.
"I don't really care, as long as they are healthy and happy, that's all I care about," Steve answered, causing Tony to flush in happiness before he turned to the side, ignoring the knowing look that Steve was sending his way. As always, his husband was so sweet and understanding that Tony wondered how he landed the jackpot without even trying.
"Steve… why do you even like me?" Tony gritted his teeth as he asked that question, God, it would have been so easy to accept that Steve wanted to change and never mention it again, but no! His conscious decided to act now out of all the times, it would have been appreciated to have its backup against Pepper.
"I didn't know you could dance," Tony spoke after a while of dancing, which made Steven chuckle and twirl Tony, making the Omega smile. "Don't change the subject, Mr. Rogers, where did you learn how to dance like this? Steven smiled at the curiosity in Tony's eyes, they looked just like his husband's, yet so different.…
23-Ég mun ekki leyfa þér að gera þá að þrælum. -I will not allow you to make them into slaves.
Tony didn't know if the ride with Happy was worse or not, especially when the man kept sending him and Steve knowing looks, making Tony embarrassed about how unsubtle he was in all of this. Tony didn't care though, not when Steve kept sending him a shy smile every now and then, taking Tony's hand in his and holding it tightly, the closer they reached the Avengers tower, not that Tony was complaining, especially since Steve leaned down to kiss his cheek when they finally reached the tower.
Tony groaned as he stretched his body, sighing happily as the cold and silky sheets caressed his naked body, reminding the inventor of what took place last night. Just thinking about what took place last night made the pleasure flare once more, tingling faintly in his body, as it tried to remind him of the wild (And beautiful) night he spent yesterday.
Hell, he went the whole nine yards with spider webs, dark sheets, black carpet, and black curtains and so much more while decorating that room for the man of the hour that was going to show up any minute now (not that he was hoping to be able to scare Rogers or anything).
Sorry for the late chapter! College is in a few days and I'm a little bit overwhelmed right now.
"No, no, no! I didn't mean that, I will go!" The Alpha waved his hands in a panicked fashion, causing Steve to let out a sniff, followed by muttering his thanks, all the while trying to stop himself from bursting in laughter; yes, Steve was feeling a little guilty for playing dirty and deciding to mess with Bucky's protective Alpha nature, but it was the only way to get the poor man out of the house, the man had been practically holing himself in his room for two months! Any more and he will turn into dust bunny!
Steve let out a heartbroken sigh as he gazed at the crystal ball in front of him; he still remembered his encounter with Tony, how the love of his life just rejected him, breaking his already fractured heart. Steve really thought that he found his one and only; Tony, the beauty that dazzled Steve, the one who isn't afraid and flirt with death daily, with a sharp aim and even sharper wits that made Steve just want to rip his heart and present it to him; maybe even ask him about what kind of deal he did with the devil to be able to live with shrapnel in his heart because that was some amazing deal to be had if Tony still wasn't answering to Lucifer who will never allow someone who will give his soul to help another.
"Peter, love…" His Mama's voice made Peter look at him to see the strange woman and man from before looking at him with tears. "Come say 'Hello' to Mama's friends, Pepper, ad Rhodey." The man who was holding him, let go which made the small boy crawl to sit in his mother's lap once more looking at the strange people.
"Thank you… though I don't think it would have been necessary." Steve gave the Alpha a soft look, walking a little faster to reach his baby's room, already getting excited at the thought of seeing his boy after so long. Reaching his baby's room Steve's grin widens as he opened the door, only to be greeted by the cute sight of Bucky reading a bedtime story to his babe, who was pouting and refusing to go to sleep.
It seems that Tony looked pathetic and miserable enough that Bucky 'I don't give a fuck about anyone but my family, Steve, and his son' Barnes asked him what the fuck was wrong with him, which ended up with Tony laughing miserably and just saying Steve… which made the other Alpha wince… because if anyone knows how Steve is, it will be the one who lived all of his life with the Omega…
Before Tony opened his trembling lips to quiet his baby, the Captain entered the room with a happy smile and a shopping bag in hand. "Hello there, little one, are you well?" The Captain asked making the pup jump in his place in Tony's lap while nodding his head happily. "May I?" The Alpha asked when he reached the bed, making Tony shake a little at that, but a whine from his baby made him swallow and nod his head letting go of his baby who crawled toward the Alpha.
It took Tony three days; three days of thinking over what Angie told him, three days of holing himself in his home and never leaving or allowing anyone inside… three days of waiting for someone to come and kill him but no one showed up… it took Tony three days before he finally said 'Fuck it' and left the house with Morgan strapped into his chest. The three days Tony spent alone in the house, did give him enough time to think over everything; weighing the pros and cons of the town, of him running away from it, and his father who seemed to be catching up to him. it was a nightmare, no matter where Tony turns his back, it was a disaster that was about to take a place, a huge disaster that Tony was in the middle of.
"A new baby won't change that Harley, you are our son, we told you that," Steve said, which only succeeded in gaining another sob from the boy who hide his face in Tony's chest, shaking and mumbling something under his breath, causing both Tony and Steve to look at each other with concern; they stayed like this until Harley calmed down, and by that time, both Harley and Peter were too tired to keep their eyes opened. Both Steve and he didn't know what to do, other than to ask Betty for some advice about this situation, knowing that this would probably cause Harley sleepless nights until they nip the problem from the bud…
Tensing Starkad rushed toward the healer, already feeling that there is going to be bad news he will receive, for his friend never looked as panicked as he did right now. "What is wrong, Braes?" Starkad asked when the Beta stood in front of him trying to catch his breath, it was only a few seconds later that the Beta took his hand and start dragging him somewhere, and Starkad was forced to run unless he wanted his face to meet the ground.
Once the food was on the table, Steve smile widen a little when the brunt came to sit on the opposite seat, even if the man was tense and distrusting, this was actually the first time Steve saw him in the same room without the man rushing out, they eat in silence, not because Steve didn't have anything to say, on the contrary, Steve has a lot of things to say to the man, but he doesn't even know how to start. "I am sorry…" Steve said after he opened and closed his mouth a few times, not knowing what to say other than that, the confused look on the other man's face made the Omega give a tight smile. "I don't really know what I did to make you hate me, but whatever I did, I'm really sorry." Steve said, feeling uncomfortable when all James did was look at him with unblinking eyes.
"H-how…" Tony's voice cracked, panic taking over him as he realized that the person in front of him was actually his father, not a dream he was having because he fell asleep on the floor near the front door. Tony couldn't help panicking; his father had found him, after two years of finally escaping the hell he used to live in, his father had found him! "How?" Tony snarled, anger and disbelieve warring with fear and terror, leaving Tony shaking to the bones as he tried to make sense of how and why was his father here after all these years.
It was painful, it was scary, and Steve was a minute away from sobbing his eyes out. The ride to the hospital was so tense; Steve remembered holding Peter and praying to God that his son will survive. It was not the first time this happened, nor will it be the last, Steve should be used to it after two years, but even after all this time, every time his baby was facing his sickness with situations like this, it makes something inside Steve break.
So what do you think?
"Can we talk Tony?" Bucky asked, the tired look on his face made Tony shift and shuffle uncomfortably in his stand. "Please… we gave you as much time as you wanted to clear your mind, now allow us to tell our side of the story." Bucky pleads, causing Tony to frown and look at his legs.
"He will be heartbroken when he learns about Bucky." Peggy breathed out which made Steven close his eyes, opening them later and look away from the woman.
"'Ello, Pep, 'Odey…." The pup said as he waved to them which made the two of them shake harder and cry more, hugging him and his Mama tightly, it made Peter look around the room once more taking in the people around him. "Mama, 'here 's 'arvis, aunt peg, and aunt ang…" Peter asked when Pep and 'Odey let go of him, that made everyone look at him with teary eyes, and his Mama kissed his head and pointed at the people who were looking at them, it made Peter worry that they have something bad in their eyes, because why were they crying? It made Peter look at his Mama who was smiling happily, that made Peter pout and look around the room, grinning when he saw his Papa, smiling and waving at Peter. The pup wanted to call his Papa to come here, but the Alpha shook his head and pointed at the man that was smiling at the pup gently. "'Ello?" Peter said when the man stopped near him, making him smile happily when the pup didn't scream…
Tony's words though seemed to freeze Steve in his place and he could do nothing but frown, his eyes taking in the short man with a thoughtful gaze. "I won't give up if that's what you think… I would still like to court you; if you are afraid of what your teammates will say, don't worry I will handle them…" Rogers said darkly, which made Tony gulp, and before he was able to open his mouth and insert his foot deeper, the lights flickered off and on, and suddenly Rogers disappeared from the lab like he wasn't even there in the first place. Tony's eyes widened at and he looked around the place wondering where the man disappeared to…
Björn: - This word meant bear (Animal), and one of the most known Nordic names.
"Well, wasn't that an interesting choice for a wedding song," Steve murmured as he took Tony's hands in his, a dark grin taking over him, and Tony was 200% sure that Steve was imagining Tony coming after him with a knife, which Tony did a couple of times before they got engaged, and no doubt it excited Steve; because only Steve would get excited by Tony running after him with a knife.
He walked toward the children's room, hoping that Peter will be there so the two of them will go home. "Tony, are you OK?" Steve's voice made Tony stop in his place and glared at the big Alpha, which made the Alpha stop and looks at him with a confused look, he was holding a big blue mug in his hand. "I see… it didn't go well." Steve said as he took a sip from his mug and looked at the children that were playing inside of the room, which only made Tony glared harder, especially when the man come stand next to him. "So what did go wrong? She asked you the famous question of how you feel." Steve questioned which made Tony hiss at him like a cat that got its tail run over, Steve only nodded at that. "I thought I was crazy…" Steve started which made Tony stop hissing and looked at the Alpha. "After waking up from the ice, everything was different, from places to people, to new inventions… I felt like I was drowning, especially hearing that voice singing inside my head, was suicidal on so many different occasions that I wondered how no one caught on me going insane, only to realize in the end that everyone is a little bent on the inside." That got Tony's attention as he looked at the Alpha with a tired look on his face. "I didn't want to get better, refused even, and thought that if I ignore it then everything will miraculously turn to be OK. If only I realized earlier that the reason for my fear was that, me fearing that I will really be considered crazy if I went to therapy more than revealing painful memories." Tony bites his bottom lip at that and looked around the place until his eyes returned to Steve.
Now, did you know?
"Thank you, Tony, I owe you this one." The Alpha said looking at Tony like he was a gift from heavens which made the Omega try to contain his blush at that and look at the pup that was running toward them when Steve called him. "Peter, what do you think about spending some time with Mr. Stark today?" Steve asked which made the pup's eyes widen at that and he looked between Tony and Steve like he didn't believe his ears.
"The fuck you thinking, Rogers?" snapped Stane as he opened the big doors to his house. "I can sue you for this! You hear me!" Stane snapped making Steve give him a dark smile.
Tony watched Stane like a hawk waiting for a mistake, which he did and Tony sized. With a miracle, he was able to size the gun and also land a hit on the Alpha… he didn't count on his minions being outside…
His father aside, the thing that dominated most of Tony's mind was the town he was living in. On the other hand, Tony wanted to run away from the town, he wanted to run away and disappear from this place, least they changed their mind and decided to kill Tony. Angie spent that day reassuring him that he wasn't held a hostage in this town against his will, that any day he wanted he could leave and nothing bad would happen; Angie also told him more about the town and how nearly half the people who came here were abused people who wanted a fresh start.
Steven ignored the gentle smile on the Beta's face, narrowing his eyes as he waited for the answer, which the healer answered him happily. "He is fine, just a few bruises and scrapes, his right hand is bruised badly, but it will be fine in a week or two." The healer explained, causing Steven to frown but nod his head to the Beta's words. "As for you, you need rest, no work allowed for a fortnight until the stabbing wound is all healed, the shock will go away in a few more days, as for any heat you fear falling a victim for, do not worry when a shock is enforced, it usually takes months before the body regulated enough that an Omega can go into heat." The healer shifted uncomfortably, causing Steven to close his eyes and nod his head, letting out a sigh, nothing the healer said Steven didn't know, for he more than anyone else knows the arts of healing, though he wasn't about to tell anyone that.
"… It's home…" A new voice said, which made everyone look around the room to see who was the speaker, and in the end, all of their eyes turned toward Rogers who was touching the dry paint on the padded walls, his face taking in the room with wide eyes, like he couldn't believe himself, and to be honest, even Tony couldn't believe his ears either, because here went Tony's plan of getting Rogers out of his mansion.
"Anton?" The voice behind Anton made his hackle rose as he turned around, seeing Jamti, Anton bites the inside of his cheek hard, trying to control himself before he said something he would regret. "Anton… is something wrong?" Jamti asked, causing Anton to let out a harsh breath through his nose and look away.
Tony sat down the hammer on the boards, splintered and pock-marked, and sinks to the floor. Under his heavy sleeping robes, his clothes are soaked in sweat. His throat feels raw and harsh, his lungs aching. His hands won't stop shaking, and he clenches them into fists and presses them to the boards, and tries to make himself still but tears start falling from his eyes.
The creature stopped grumbling when he felt a hand taking hold of the wet pants he was wearing; the action caused the creature to tense and let out a threatening hiss as he turned to the boy who dared to touch him. The creature paused when he noticed that the boy was still in fact asleep and that the boy's hand seeks the creature unconsciously. That made the creature send the boy an annoying look, and turn away, refusing to gaze at the boy's tired face and shivering form, that start shivering violently as the air around them became colder and colder. With one last glance, the creature untangled the boy's hand away from him, turning to the edge of the boat.
God, how much Tony wanted to sigh like an Omega in love, not like he wasn't, oh he was, he defiantly was. At first Tony expected to fall in love with Steve to be all firework and fire like he normally heard from the Omegas back when he was at MIT, he even fantasied a few times about being in love when he was a teen…
"Oh, the burn and betrayal, Oh, what is thee name?" Steve said as he put his hand on his heart in a mock hurt which made Tony trying hard to hold into his laughter and failing at that, though the giggling of the pup was worth it.
So what do you think?
The Iron King grunt unhappily when Steven hissed at him and tried to pull his hand away, to hold into his son who was shaking like a leaf when they reached the main entrance where a big muscular and blond man awaited. And Steven held back the need to recoil once the big guy glowered down at them causing his son to choke a sob and hide in his skirt. Steven noticed that this man was the one who came with the dark-haired one his beard was longer than the king's, even allowing it to be braided like the rest of his bright blond hair, and he was looking at Steven and his pup with light blue eyes. A thick hammer was strapped to his black armor's leather belt, and the low rumble of a voice he possessed was enough to send terrifying shivers down Steven's spine, "
"Well, Fury ordered Serpentine to do something she doesn't like!" Chirped Tony with a forced smile, trying not to twitch when he saw how pale Bucky became like he already knew the kind of punishment Fury gained because of him standing up to Serpentine. Tony wasn't an idiot, he wasn't a fool, he accepts his marriage to Steve mainly to not be Serpentine's target like how Fury made himself, all Tony can do is pray for those unfortunate souls lost in the crossfire of Serpentine and Steve's anger. "Now that S.H.I.E.L.D. is destroyed I will go and take a bath and then die somewhere in a ditch, so if you excuse me…" Tony's forced smile slipped as he turned around, dragging himself to his room, already planning out a date with his hot tube and rubber duck… God this was a nightmare.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, a little bit of sadness, fluff! Peter is a cute bean, and a surprise! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"But…" Steve tried to justify only for Tony to growl at him, which broke his heart a little when the love of his life didn't give him any chance to explain why he did what he did, and to make things even worse, Tony went to the trickster and took hold of him from his shirt firing his repulsors as he headed toward S.H.I.E.L.D. which Steve nearly snarled when he saw the love of his life fly away and leave him here, which made Steve's face twitch until it was a murderous scowl that made everyone around him jump away in fear…
…" Rogers ordered him, and this time, Tony didn't dare to fight his command, his body was already shutting down, knowing what was going to happen but was not willing to stay and witness it…
Tony only smiled and kissed Steve's forehead. "Sure, sweetheart, whatever you want," Tony whispered causing Steve to sniff and for a sob of relief to leave his mouth, happiness and hope bloom in his heart at the thought of Tony compromising to save their marriage from being doomed. With a shaky sigh, Steve hides his face in Tony's neck, taking his scent and calming down farther and farther…
"OK, kiddos, what do you think about ice cream? But only today, don't make it a habit." Tony said as he went to the fridge to get the ice cream, wanting the boys to ignore Steve's fight with Fury about his leave from work. Part of Tony couldn't help but roll his eyes, because everyone damn knew that Steve can work from home easily but Fury still like to torture and milk him all the way through before he give to Steve's demand of taking his leave.
"What did you do?" Bucky snarled in Howard's face, if it wasn't for Peggy, the Alpha would have jumped Howard and pounded his head in the wall behind him, something that Tony wouldn't have minded at all. But Tony didn't care; he didn't move from Steve's side since reaching him, Tony just held Steve's hand tightly and begged him to hold on.
"You are so cruel; you practically made us wake up at 3 a.m. who in their right mind wake up at such a time! I know I should have never helped you with J, remind me again, why aren't we taking a plane home?" Rhodey whined as he starts shoving a forkful of eggs in his mouth which did nothing but makes Pepper roll her eyes and give a tired sigh grumbling about idiot boyfriends.
Steve told him that the mask was a prototype that Howard was making for Shield, he also mentioned how Howard always took the mask with him on any gala he goes to, just so he could run away from people in stuffy suits, that more than ever made Tony laugh and look through the window at the city, smiling when he saw Peter sitting in the back in his chair looking outside of the window with wide eyes, taking everything in. Tony smiled every time Steve pointed at a new place, talking about the changes in New York, pointed to a few good restaurants and café, bakers with delicious pastries, bookstores, houses, shops, and other things.
"He is alright, my queen. I just came from his room; the little prince was as fussy as ever about taking a bath." Margaret's words made a quiet laugh leave him, as he stood up after the Beta was finished with his hair, he then went to the tub in his room hiding by a screen, letting out a sigh of content as he disrobed himself and lowered himself in the warm water.
Tony doesn't know how long he stayed sitting in his chair after Peggy throws him and Bucky on them, glaring at them until they stopped with their plan of breaking into the operation room; all that Tony knows is he is one step closer to a mental breakdown. He can't do it, he can't, Tony can't live without Steve; if anything happened to Steve, Tony can't go on, he can't, he doesn't know what to do, he doesn't know how to take care of Peter. Oh God, Peter! What would the little boy do when he realizes that his mother was dead, that the only family he knew is gone forever, his son will hate him for the rest of his life, he will blame Tony for what happened, and he was not wrong in his blame either, because it was Tony's fault, it was Tony's fault, if only he paid more attention, this wouldn't have happened. Tony was sure he was crying; he was sure that he shed tears as he tried to stop his shaking, he knew that he was one minute away from doing something stupid… if Steve didn't survive, then he will… he will…
"What do you mean baby?" He opened one of his eyes tiredly, his body hurt from Stan's visit earlier, and he just wanted to close his eyes and rest… and never open them again… but his baby needs him, he was what? Two years old, or maybe he was three? He lost track of time, he doesn't remember if there was a time he wasn't locked in here like an animal… the memories of having a family and warmth were so far away it seems like a distant dream…
The sound of the British voice made Tony blink and look at the mask near him and pick it up, looking at it, he didn't answer the AI, and the AI didn't ask him back, he just stored the information for a later date. Tony raised the mask to his face and looked through the mask's eyes, humming a little as he inspect the room while wearing the mask, though his heart skip a beat when his eyes fell on the doorway, because there Steve was, crossing his arms over his chest and leaning on the door, an unimpressed look on his face when he was gazing at Tony. "S-Steve…" Tony stuttered and nearly ripped the mask off and run to the Omega, but the Omega shook his head when he tried to lower his mask, which made Tony freeze in his place and gazes at the Omega.
All in all, life sucks, and Tony tried to return back to his routine after all grieving for his child that had died years ago wouldn't do him any good, so he had to suck it up and move on… at least that's what he was trying to convince himself to do… Tony sighed as he pushed the shopping car around the supermarket, Tony really didn't know what possesses him to go shopping instead of ordering deliveries like he always does… though personally he knows that deep down he is looking for a distraction and doing everything his hands fall on until he only has six hours to sleep was working, it stopped him from thinking too much, on a brighter note, he never knew there were so many ice creams' flavors… not that he eats it but Clint's brats had been bugging him about them (He is lying he spent the last month and a half living on this shit he never ate in his life until he became pregnant) and on another brighter note, Sarah Rogers was hosting their get-together the next week, something about her son meeting the neighbors.
The Viking Chief's expression went from peaceful to thunderous in an instant, it made Steve wake up and glance around, he was too far in his fear and terror that he didn't catch the sentences exchanged between them, the man stepped forward, towering over Johann and causing the king to cower in fear. "The Omegas' from my people were violated, their husbands stripped apart, their children burned alive while their pets roasted on spikes to feed your murderers' bellies, and you are telling me." he stepped even closer, furious dark brown eyes pining Johann in place and making him shiver "They were murdered just because… you thought… I did not exist, and therefore, you found yourself in the right to allow innocent people to die?" Johann stuttered his response, which made the Iron King's expression darken even more
"Steve!" Steve heard someone screaming his name which made him turn his head to look at Peggy, Natasha, Fury, and Stane running down… Stane's face was red and Steve wonder if the flash of fear he saw in his eyes for a second was real. "Steve! What's going on?" Peggy whispered frantically as she took a hold of his hands making him stop from running once more…
And finally, Tony gets a grip of his life, finally the pain of losing his pup didn't hurt as much as it used too, but sometimes when he was alone at night, it hurt to even think about it, but in the end, Tony knew he got his friends.
Steve went to the only person who he knew will be able to help him in this situation, he knew Bruce's schedule by now, and he knew that on Friday the Beta had the night shift, so Steve went toward Bruce's room hoping to find the doctor there, he was thankful when he saw the lights under the door, he knocked on the door and heard Bruce's calm voice granting him entry, Steve closed the door behind him as he walked inside the room, looking at Bruce who was drinking tea and reviewing some of his patients' files.
For everyone who liked more explanation about what happened to Steven, this is the answer. When Steven was hit by the missile, his body and soul get separated, by the magic of the machine that was still on when the missile hit, his soul was suck through the portal and he was given a temporary body in the parallel universe. As you can see, later on, his body was recovered and he fell into a coma, but the strain of his body and soul being separated in different universe without death interfering was going to destroy the flow of time, so he had to choose, either to return home, which then the temporary body he gains will disappear, or stay in the parallel universe, which will finally let death claim his body that was in the other world, the Ancient One was able to stabilize Steven's soul which made his temporary body a real one.
As for Peggy, she was looking at Steve with an understanding look, for she too had lost her mate a long time ago, her mate was a beautiful and feisty Omega, never accepted the world's stereotyped of what a proper Omega should be like. Daniel knew what he wanted and he went after it, proving to the world that Omegas can be equal to Alphas, she created Shield after his death, hoping that she will create a safe world for Omegas, a place where Omegas like her mate, like her nephew will have the same equality as any Alpha out there. Seeing Steven with rings he destroyed his Shield to create, made her realize that maybe… just maybe what she fought was within her reach.
"Y-you know me?" The woman asked with a wobbly voice which made the pup pause and nods his head at that, the old man behind her took a step forward which made the pup look at him with a grin and extend his arm that was not holding the toy to hug the man, who was shaking.
The information that Tony has on his house was limited, what Tony knows from the information Rhodey got him and the few words that Bucky and Peggy let slip was slim. He knows that the Rogers family ran away from their house after their son's death, and that son was probably Peggy and Bucky's best friend that the two of them always talk about with a found look (They talk about 'Stevie' as if he wasn't dead; as if he just left the town to live his life away. They never ever told him their friend's last name, just his nickname which was 'Stevie') Tony now knows that the Rogers' family didn't lose their son because of sickness, but because he was killed in the lake beside the house... 'Drown' in the lake beside the house thirty years ago. Being at the tail end of the twenty century, narrow the year of the Rogers' son death a little bit; if Tony placed the unfortunate event somewhere in the sixties he will probably take the time frame from the year 1965 to 1970, that was if Peggy's word of the Rogers' son dying in his teenager years has any truth in them.
Starkad could only chase after his son when the boy took off, chasing after that foolish Omega. As much as Starkad wanted to scream and snap at how things ended, he knows that it was his fault, acting irrationally even when the stubborn queen threw the truth in his face without a care about the consequences. He chased his babe until his son slipped out of his sight, nearly causing Starkad to snarl; he knew his boy was always nimble and fast on his feet, but that didn't give him the right to use it against him, just to chase that foolish Omega he met not a few months ago!
Two years… two years since his child was diagnosed with cancer, two years of chemotherapy, two years of Steve working two sometimes three jobs to be able to pay for his son's treatment, because let's face it, chemotherapy was expensive, radiation therapy was expensive, the nights they were forced to stay in the hospital were expensive, the necessity Steve needs to buy were expensive! Two years of his son being forced to go to chemotherapy because Steve told him he will get better if he did, two years since Steve made Peter drop from school after the pup returned home getting sick and nearly dying from some infection he got, but Steve was not worried, his son was genius, so genius that by the age of 9 he was already in the eighth grade, two years… two years of being put on the list, in hope of his son getting a stem cell transplant, because at the end of the day Steve was not compatible with his pup and couldn't donate to save his child…
Today Steve and Tony will spend their first night as a married couple in the hotel suite they rented, tomorrow after saying goodbye to their pup and parents they will leave on their month-long honeymoon to Italy, where the two of them will stay at the Carbonell family's mansion and enjoy their time there.
"Shut your mouth, you foolish old goat! What do you know of how the world works?! Be quiet, before I personally ask these barbarians to rid you of your tongue." Rage boiled Steven's insides in a way that made him dizzy, and if weren't for his child who was hidden in his arms firmly pulling him into a tight hug and the man lying beside him, he was pretty sure he would have attacked Johann instead. Steven cursed the king while glaring at his king in a way that if looks could kill, then Johann would have probably dropped dead right then. If the king noticed the act of defiance, however, he didn't pay any mind to it, turning around once more to yell again at the Vikings and demand to see their leader, considering that Steven didn't open his mouth to argue this time.
"He didn't hurt you, did he?" Tony ends up saying after opening his mouth and closing it a little not knowing what to do, because the pup was looking at him with so much distress in his eyes it made Tony's Omega plead with him to pull the pup toward his chest and hide him away from the world so he wouldn't be hurt anymore, the pup sniff at that and look at his right hand, hugging the toy tightly to his chest. "Does it hurt, darling?" Tony cooed gently, and he saw something pass in the pup's eyes before the small pup throw himself at Tony hugging the Omega tightly and start crying, which made the Omega held into the pup and rocking him gently, whispering encouraging words to him, and telling him how proud he was because the pup was brave.
There isn't a sensation in the world that comes even close to how it feels to be with his Alpha, and Steve forced himself to keep his eyes open as Tony begins to move, watching Steve as he mewls in frantic pleasure. "Mine…" Tony groaned, and Steve answered with an ecstatic noise, wrapping his legs around Tony. "Mine." Tony repeated, softer now, and tears are falling down Steve's cheeks. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's shoulders. "Mine, my omega, Steve." Tony rambled as he nuzzled Steve's collarbone, then kisses his throat. "Darling, sweetheart, don't cry. Don't cry, baby…" Tony went on as he caressed Steve's hair.
The picture that Steve gave to his son, the boy always took with him no matter where he goes, though he never took it outside of the house in fear of losing it, these days, his baby usually leave it on the coffee table in the living room, because that's where Peter spent half of his days after returning from daycare and later on, school.
Pepper! Tony grinned to himself, he needed to call the woman and tell her where he was, maybe she and Rhodey can come here on Christmas, celebrating Tony moving into this beautiful house, he has to call her, and maybe persuade her into smuggling Dum-E here, after all, he did leave him with her for safekeeping three years ago, while lying to his father about him disassembling the robot, maybe Jarvis will like to come too. Tony was sure that the AI got bored of being a computer, maybe he can wire him into the house, making him a security system that will protect the house in his absence.
"M-me… why?" Steve asked which made the doctor look at Steve in silent for a long time, making Steve uncomfortable by that.
"Are you going you answer that?" Bucky asked, pointing to the buzzing phone with his fry, before biting it, giving Steve a raised eyebrow when the Omega scowled at the phone and rejected the call, and the Omega was grateful that Bucky didn't point who the caller was, but was content getting to know each other.
"He… he is my fated mate." Tony ended up saying after a while of silence, which made Dr. Ross's eyes widen, though she regains herself and a smile made its way to her lips as she looked at the flushed Omega, who was playing with the sleeve of his button-down, a nerves habit of his that Dr. Ross picked on.
No matter how much Steve tried to calm Peter down the boy, continued to cry louder and louder, and it was that moment that Steve felt a little resentment for Tony, the Alpha knows damn well that his help was needed, but still, he didn’t come to check on his crying son, when the boy needed him. Peter suddenly stopped crying, and that more than ever made Steve worried and concern, because normally when Peter cry, he won’t stop unless he and Steve were in bed, with Steve telling him stories about his father, but when Peter looked up at him for a second, he stretched his hands toward him. “Mommy…” That was all Peter could whine before his eyes closed and he fell down, causing Steve to let a panicked cry and rush to his baby.
"Of c-course, Pep, you are the only candidate for the Godmother position!" Tony laughed nervously, hoping against hope that Natasha, who was waiting for Rhodey and Pepper in her car didn't hear that, or else, he was so dead, which was a shame considering that he was still so young and have a child on the way.
"You know what to do, soldier." Zola said with a smugly satisfied expression on his face, he presumably thought that the shock and the rage clouded Steven's face was from him seeing that the soldier in front of him was his long-lost friend and that Steven won't do anything to struggle least he injured that said friend. Unfortunately for Zola though, he had just signed for death when he left the room, leaving Steven with Bucky alone; just a few moments more, and Steven sower that he will unleash what he struggled to suppress for years, and wipe out all of Hydra today.
"Do it, I don't want anyone alive other than this bastard for me to kill," Tony stated, which made Steve laugh before he disappeared in a blink of an eye; after that Tony took out his phone to call Pepper about damage control and his beloved mansion, which to Tony's dismay ended up nothing but a pile of rocks. Pepper went on and on about how the mansion was destroyed today at the time Steve and Tony were supposed to be in the mansion (Tony decided to spent a week in his beloved seaside mansion before returning to the pain in the ass that was his home) but thankfully Tony and Steve delayed their trip several hours before returning back home (The only reason for that was because Steve found another white shark he wanted to keep, but Tony was still convinced that it was the same poor shark he terrorizes before, especially with the puppy dog eyes and whimpers the shark sent his way… it took Tony hours to convince Steve they don't need the shark as a pet)
Steve let out a harsh exhale from his nose at the tone his mother used, scowling at the knife in his hands before stabbing the ground with it. "I really love him, tried to court him any way I can, only successes in getting the attention of his teammates, but never him, maybe I should follow Wednesday footsteps and give my heart to the devil, maybe then it won't hurt." Steve whispered tiredly, getting a sigh from his mother.
The first gunshot caused Tony to curse and look around the room, trying to find a way to escape before the door break completely by Howard's hands. The only way out was the window, and that alone made Tony bite his lower lip hard; Tony knew that falling from the window won't kill him, it may injure himself, but not serious enough to send him to the hospital. With that Tony curse as he rushed to the window, forcing it open as heard the second gunshot followed by another slam. The creaking sound coming from the door informed Tony that Howard was too close to his goal.
To Steven's surprise, he heard nothing but a snort of amusement coming from the king before he continued his way. "As I said before I do not care, besides, I never asked for forgiveness I never wanted in the first place." The king stated before he continued his way once more, leaving Steven standing in the hallway before shaking his head and entering his new room…
When Steve went to find Tony, he didn't have to search long before finding every one, not when Tony was talking so loudly it could have been considered shouting. Reaching the living room, Steve shifted in his place when he saw that there weren't only two cops like he thought there will be, but the place was swimming in them, which was overwhelming.
The hardest part of all was seeing Tony, seeing his beautiful husband so young, so full of life, waiting to take the world by storm as he always does. Tony always asked him about the future's techs, asked him to let him do a little tests on Edith promising to return the AI unharmed, but Steve couldn't, he couldn't give the last piece he had of his husband to anyone, even for his husband's youngest self, his husband gave him Edith on his dying bed, and he wasn't going to give the AI to anyone out there.
Everything was weird, that was the only thing that Tony could think of. It was a month after Pepper and Rhodey left, and Tony can only think of how weird it was, how weird his home was becoming. The cold spots, the missing items, the strange noises Tony heard in the middle of the night, continued as time went by; the only difference is Tony feeling like he was being watched constantly. No matter how many times Tony ordered Jarvis to scan his home, nothing ever showed up; no videos of ghostly things floating, no darting shadows, no clear images of something strange; nothing. The same could be said about the lake and the monster it housed, but the monster was always a strange creator showing up whenever he (They?) liked. That didn't matter to Tony at this moment, instead of trying to solve the mystery of the lake; Tony spent all his attention trying to solve the mystery of the house and the ghost that thought it was welcomed into Tony and his daughter's lives.
So Tony could say that Rogers was not only weird but dangerous as hell, and he even begged Fury to take him back after the cat accident, but the man refused, saying something about Rogers needing 'Familiar faces' so that he will be able to 'recover'… though Tony knew that secretly Fury was afraid of Rogers, that's why he doesn't want him in S.H.I.E.L.D, or any where near it… so now Tony was stuck with Rogers as a 'Forever Here' guest, but that didn't mean he didn't scream at Rogers. He screamed at the man for what he did to his gardens, and the dead animals that were buried in his backyard… he doesn't want a Pet Cemetery in his house, the horror of dealing with that cat was enough…
"Love, you will do amazing, I just know that; it's just like taking care of Peter, and you did amazing with our boy." Steve hummed, kissing Tony's forehead a few times, smiling happily when the Omega seemed to relax in his arms. "I am going to talk with Harley; I will get his story and tell him about the adoption. What we did right now is not conventional so Harley will probably need to return back to the clinic before we complete the adoption process." That got a sigh and a nod from Tony who still had a frown on his face, hiding his face in Steve's chest muttering something that even Steve didn't hear.
"No one said you were…" Steve ruffled Tony's hair making the Omega swats his hand which got a laugh from the older blond. "Don't try to give me another excuse so you can ditch the therapy, I know one thing or two about the excuses you are going to use," Steve said with an eyebrow rising, making Tony who opened his mouth to give another excuse shut his mouth and throw a flat look to the man.
It took him three months to remodel and fix the house, three months of Tony crashing in Mrs. Carter's (Call me Peggy) house, three months of planning his and his baby's life while meeting a lot of different people, making friends with few of them, like Dr. Banner the doctor of the town who was always calm and attentive, especially to Tony considering that he was new here, the Romanov-Barton family, the two spouses were so crazy that Tony couldn't help but think that they may hide something underneath all the craziness, the Odinson brothers that own the town's bar, bickering and fighting every breath they took, which made Tony laugh at their petty fights, and lastly, Peggy's husband, Bucky, a scary man he was that was true, but he was the best carpenter and engineer of the town a fate that Tony couldn't help but ask the man about, only to get a creepy smile from him, so he stopped asking.
"A-and then, I held him from his hair and cut it!" James puffed his small chest and put both of his fists on his waist; the little boy was sitting on the bed beside his mother as he told him the tale of how he punished the bad guy who hurt his mother. Steven gave his babe a soft smile, he was feeling good today, and his child's cheerful energy helped him forget about the hurt that was eating his heart from the inside out.
"Tony Stark, and no, your pup was sweet he didn't cause me troubles at all…" Tony took Steve's hand shaking it a little then let go, he then looked at his watch and let a sigh. "I must go, but before I do…" Tony kneeled and looked at Peter with a small smile. "Thank you for being brave today, I want to give you this, I was sad, but now I am not, so thank you," Tony said as he took a Winnie the Pooh plush out of the gift bag and offers it toward Peter.
It started with Tony being terrified of his pregnancy, trying to deny the baby he was going to have desperately; it ended with Tony finally gathering the courage and going inside the one room in his home that stayed closed for years and years. Going inside the room, the hurt and nostalgia took hold of him as his eyes took the room, smiling sadly when he saw how clean and tidy the room was, no doubt thanks to Steve who always took care of this room when Tony was too wired up to even go inside.
It just went from bad to worse!
It was shocking to say the least, how the pup was so attached to this practically Omega when he always screams when he sees one coming near him, but Sarah stayed near the trio holding in her laughter when she saw the pup flush after he was told that the Omega was actually the Tony Stark. To see her grandson interact with an Omega without a fear, with a happy smile all over his face, it made her day, but to actually see her son joke with an Omega and talk with him without the wariness that usually takes a place every time Steve stand near an Omega… it gave her hope.
"He is asleep," Tony stated, giving Steve a thankful nod when the Alpha left with Peter in his arm and the cupcake plate in the other, leaving Betty and Tony to have the talk they needed without Peter witnessing what could be a fight. "I am not giving him back," Tony stated as he stepped in front of Betty stopping her from heading upstairs.
"Mama, is that Harley?" Peter asked a grin stretched his lips as he followed Steve and Tony, his eyes were wide as they took in Harley; Peter was probably happy to see his friend, wondering when the two of them would play around that the other kid was finally with them.
and then he would be forced to return home or worse, in hope of stopping the scandal that was going to take a place. A pregnant Omega without a mate? He would better kill himself than be at the world's mercy.
"Oh, believe me, darling, my version of the shovel talk includes a literal shovel and a patch of that lovely cemetery you have in the gardens." Serpentine gave a sharp smile, causing her fangs to glint when the light fell on them, which did nothing but make Tony gulp trying to back away slowly without the ghost noticing him. "Now, where were we? Ah, yes, you were going to tell me why the severe reaction when I implied Joseph was abusive." Serpentine asked, and Tony could feel the curiosity coming out from the ghost woman in waves, causing Tony to shift in his place.
"What did you do, you little shit?" Stane growl as he pulled Tony back from his hair, making Tony let out a shout of pain, the winds howl like an angry beast at that, and Tony tried to stop his shaking when it starts getting colder and colder reaching the freezing point that Tony could see his breath coming in white buffs in front of him.
Again, I am so sorry that I ended the story like this, but as you can say a lot has been going on lately, and I just couldn't finish it anymore, hopefully, one day I will return and finish the story.
It took a few minutes for them to find a rhythm, but once they did, they moved together as if performing a choreographed dance. Each thrust was perfectly matched, their hips circling and swiveling beautifully. Even the sound of skin on skin accented by moans had a musical quality to it that made everything seem that much more sensual, more beautiful, more perfect.
father and not just the one with the title who was humoring them until Tony got on his feet.
"Oh, you should have seen your face, Cap, it was priceless!" The man with dark chocolate hair said, grinning happily when the blond huffed at him and scrunched his nose at his husband's words, taking in the chocolate dark eyes that were sparkling in amusement, which much to the Omega's annoyance, made his tense muscle relax. "And I'm sorry babe; I couldn't help it, especially when you were brooding all day." The brunt said as he tried to save the situation, which gains him nothing but the Omega huffing and throwing the water bottle at his husband, which the shorter man caught with a grin and followed the blond who made it as his mission to go to the living room and maybe watch TV because sleep has long since left him after this tasteless prank.
"Little Peter here is a fan of yours since he was three, ever since you invented the Arc-Reactor, he wanted to be an engineer like you, he even invented gadgets in the garage, I really don't know from where his smart came from, too bad he didn't love art." The Alpha said with a mock disappointment which made the pup whines.
Once the touched the land, Steven's eyes widen a little as he looked at the village before him, it was the first time he saw a village like this, big houses surrounded by greenery, the village surrounded by three huge mountains on three sides while the fourth side dominated by the sea, a village with the best defenses someone could ask for, and it was beautiful, it reminds him of home, and Steven wondered if he walked to the left of the bakery, he wondered if he will see his house where he had left it, but Steven shook that thought away, after all, this was not his village, just another one who looked like his home. "Welcome you Mantta, foolish queen." The Iron King said, but Steven didn't give a mocking reply in return, still taking in the beauty and how the village and houses surrounded itself with greenery and trees, the perfect balance between modern and living with nature.
As the time passed, Anthony realized that he stop responding to the name Stark, as the time passed he realized his wish to be Anthony Carbonell and not a Stark, it made Anthony pause and thing, he will daydream and fantasies about him and Steve living far away from here, he fantasy about a home that had a little lab for him, and a studio for Steve, he will dream of the small footsteps running in the hallways and the laughter that will follow, he will dream of opening his own business away from this draining work, away from Howard and Stane, and he always see Steve smiling proudly at him, maybe he will open his own garage? Away… away from this painful life, creating the perfect one with Steve, having their own home, their own family, with his mother, aunt Peggy, Jarvis, and his wife in them, away from Howard and Stane's poisonous influence.
"Moving on…" Tony finally said as he starts shoving a few stray toys he forgot about, trying not to cry when Steve came up behind him and put a gentle arm around him. "Steve… please…" The Omega begged, hoping that the Alpha would realize what he was doing to him just by holding him in his arms tightly.
Getting back home, Tony never knew how much he missed home until he was back, holding his baby, and gazing around the place like he was seeing it for the first time. Steve seemed to share the same feeling as him, because for the rest of the week after Steve and Tony were back, the two of them spent it bonding with Peter, cementing themselves as a pack and a family, which was a breathtaking experiment.
"Steve… my parents are dead," Tony said, already dreading what Steve was thinking about, nope, hell to the no! If Steve was thinking about summoning his parents as ghosts or goddammit zombies, Tony would end the man, he would end him, and Serpentine's rage is damn! Tony was not going to repeat that horrifying night all over again, that night still brought him nightmares!
! Do not worry, I will be the one who will do all the torture, you just enjoy the show." Steve purred the smugness was dripping from Steve in waves, making Tony gulp and send a quick prayer to God, asking Him for mercy. "We are here!" Steve chirped happily, dumping Tony in what looked like a plush pillow that Tony was sure wasn't there a second ago.
"Physically, he was better than the people I saw in the Germans camps, mentally? I don't really know." That made Jarvis nods his head, feeling too tired and too old for this. "He gripped the front of my suit before passing out, he grips it and orders me to save his son… what am I going to do, Jarvis? What am I to do when the pup dies?" Steve sniffed at that, which made Jarvis sigh and stand up on shaky legs.
"I think so…" The boy said as he took Tony's hand and was pulled by the Alpha. "Whoa, you are strong, mister." The small boy said as he took off his Iron Man helmet that turned to the side when he slammed into him. Tony gazed at the small boy as the kid pulled a blue baseball cap from somewhere and put it on his bald head, the kid was pale, and his eyes were a chocolate brown color, but he looked so familiar when Tony tilted his head to the side. "You are Tony Stark!" The boy gasped as he looked at Tony the helmet in his hands forgotten.
"Wha… happen…" Peter mumbled, rubbing his face on Steve's shoulder trying to wipe the sleep away from his eyes, his arms holding tightly to Steve's neck as he looked around the place, snuggling into Steve's neck and letting out a whine when the alarms continued to blare loudly.
"Me… hero?" He stuttered Peter couldn't believe his little ears, his Papa just called him a hero, him! He turns to his Mama who was smiling with teary eyes, Mama told him that sometimes people cry when they were happy, Papa was finally back and he saved them from the bad men so Peter was sure his Mama was happy.
"You are right, I cannot kill you, but it does not mean I cannot kill your little followers, nor does it mean I will not punish you, for you not only attacked my son, but you attacked a pregnant Omega who held the sacred runes that formed the word 'Life' on his person, and you have cursed us with death and plague, for Goddess Frigga will punish all who hurt those who carried her bless!" Murmurs and panic start taking over every person on the hill, for only now did everyone realization of what Hamar's actions caused them. "An Omega who went into a shock after you hurting their unborn… do you know what kind of punishment awaits us from Goddess Frigga? Plague, sickness, starvation, death…" Starkad's smile widens even more at the panic he saw on everyone's faces. "Now, your punishment shall be known to the Gods, Goddesses, and everyone standing on the hill, for only a true sacrifice will stop Goddess Frigga from seeking to curse us." Starkad words were followed by screams of agreement, the fear of being cursed and abandoned by their Gods and Goddesses pushed any sympathy they held for the criminals, no one wanted to be cursed with plague and death because a few idiots didn't know when to pick their battles. "For daring to attack the Omega that held Goddess Frigga's blessing, you are punishment are death, in the form of 'Blóðörn', the sentence shall be executed tomorrow at dawn." Gasps of shock and fear took over the people, for not once since they start living in Mantta did this severe punishment was performed on anyone, and seeing their king ordering it, it made the knowledge of how serious their future punishment at the hands of Gods finally sink.
After finally arriving to Asgard; Thor could only take a deep breath at the sight in front of him, his heart rejoicing by the sight of his home after years of being stranded on Midgard with no way back home. Thor took a few silent minutes as he gazed at his home in an appreciated silence before turning around to gaze at the other person beside him. Thor could only grin at the sight of Heimdall; his friend looked to be in a good shape, even after all these years that Thor wasn't there beside his shield brother. "Heimdall, my friend! How have you been?" Thor asked as he took a step toward the man, smiling at the soft look Heimdall send his way, it had been a long time since he was able to talk to someone from his home without it being in his astral form.
"No! Get out! I said get out!" Tony screamed as he pushed his father, making the older man protest at that, pleading with Tony to reconsider his choices, pleading with him to see reason. "Don't come back unless you get rid of Stane, because everything you said, I'm sure he spoon feed you those words. Oh, and by the way I quit." Tony growled as he pushed his father out of the front door and slamming it shut, he continued to hear his father knocking at the door pleading with him…
That day Steve spent all of his time in his studio, planning on finishing the last of his commissions; they are going to be his last until the baby is born. In just five months, Steve is going to have his baby in his arms! Just this thought alone gave Steve the energy to finish everything that needed to be done.
What do you think?
(See the end of the chapter for
"Thank you…" Steve said after a while of silence, and the Alpha had to stop himself from puffing his chest in pride especially when he saw the Omega looking at the flowers with a gentle smile on his lips, the Alpha opened the car's door for Steve, which made the Omega purse his lips at the action, but got inside the car with no complains making the Alpha rush to the driver seat to take his place behind the wheel and drive to the destination in mind…
Anton, on the other hand, stood still, his eyes were wide, and whatever amusement he felt not a few seconds ago vanished as he leaned on the tree behind him wondering if what he heard was right and that the person beside Steven was asking the Omega to court him. "Wow, is this the best I can get out of you?" Steven chuckled, the light tone the Omega used made Anton narrow his eyes and lean a little trying to see the man who was asking the Omega courting him. "Fine, I accept." Anton's eyes widen even more at the acceptance, and he nearly left his hidden place behind the tree and march toward the Omega, demanding an explanation for this. "What are your conditions and what kind of dowry are you demanding, first of all?" Was the queen insane? Anton wanted to scream wondering why the queen would accept marriage when he was a widow for only a few months, but he was also marrying one of the Christians he protected while paying for a dowry without silver to his name or a witness! (5)
"I get inside by using the door if you are a wonder; Peter, wanted to see you, it's late and he said something about you taking him to the park tomorrow." Steven stated, which made Tony scowl for a few seconds before letting out a sigh, gazing at the clock hanging on the wall with a thoughtful look on his face, wincing when he saw that it was 3:00 a.m. he wondered what kind of hell his boy will make him go through to wake him up tomorrow.
"So you were a Demi, right?" Tony asked which made the man nodded his head. "But you met him when he was forty, right? He was still young and I am sure he wouldn't have minded having sex." Tony pointed out which made Steven laugh at that, count on Tony to say it as he sees it.
It starts getting worse after a year of his son's death, after Tony start the drinking, no one found him without an alcohol bottle in his hand, if he wasn't working himself to death in finding a way to open the company he deludes himself with, then he will drink himself to death, as much as his friends tried to talk him out of it, as much as they begged him to go to a therapist, as much as they begged him to stop drinking, Tony didn't listen.
Unfortunately for him, his father came to visit him, he had called the ambulance and Tony ends up getting his stomach pumped, he could have gone without Howard screaming at him though.
"They are going to be so jealous." Peter whispered in excitement which caused Steve to laugh a little at that, which painted a big smile on Peter's face as he looked at Steve happily, causing the Omega to sigh a little to himself before telling the boy it was bedtime, which made the boy pout a little and whine, causing Steve to smile a little.
"Yes, Dad, I am." Tony smile widens as he said these words, and Howard's heart felt as light as a feather when he saw the happiness radiating off of Tony. Howard could only take hold of Tony's hand and give it a gentle squeeze, words refusing to leave his lips, and Howard was sure if he opened his mouth now he will start sobbing…
"Fine, but bring me the blue one, I will never wear that rosey color even on my death's bed." Steven said which made Margaret smile at that and went to the wardrobes to exchange the dress and bring the blue one to Steven which made the Omega curse as Margaret had to help him with the dress, seven years, and Steven still never used to this kind of torture, he really missed the days when he will wear tunics and pants, who need all these, under-gown, and girdles, and having to stay still for thirty to sixty minutes to get dress, wasting the daylight when he could have worn simple pants and tunic.
Tony finally saw inside of the boathouse, which made him grimace at the disgusting mess that was inside, which Natasha promised that they will clean it tomorrow as Tony should rest now, considering that the teen shouldn't exhaust himself to death like how he was planning with the way he wanted to work things out.
Bucky though, only paused in his glaring to send Steve a confused look. "He went out today, something about talking with the security or the insurance company or whatever; he left right after your friend came." Bucky stated, turning to glare at the Beta who seemed to bump into things more than walking around, an action that caused the Beta to squeak. "He didn't say when he was going to return, but he will probably be back before dinner?" Bucky tried to assure him, something that Steve doesn't know if he appreciated it or not.
"Yes, just yours and mine, no one else." Steve smiled as he said those words, which caused Peter's eyes to widen in delight, and for a small 'Oh' to leave him. "Why don't we go inside? I'm sure, that Tony will love to have your answer." Steve offer, getting a shy nod from Peter who took his hand when the two of them stood up, Steve doesn't even know what Tony will think of how bashful his son starts acting as, it was as if it was the first time he met Tony again.
"I… I…" Steve choked, his breath hitching, and tears started gathering in his eyes, what was going on here? Was Peggy really truthful all along? Was Steve really the insane one in all of this and that Bucky and he were really married? So far everything leads to that direction, and Peggy being alive was one of the dominating ones. "W-what's the baby's name?" Steve ended up choking, trying to change the subject desperately and forget about this insanity altogether.
The rest of the flight was spent with Tony laughing madly as he chased the leader down, nearly chopping his head off several times before the worm managed to sidestep his attacks. When the plane finally landed at home in New York, Steve and Tony had the widest grins in all the world as they unboarded the plane after the terrified pilots and flight attendances who ran to safety as fast as they could, trying not to throw up at the blood and body parts that decorated the interior part of the plane. As for Tony, he could only hum happily, with a skip in his steps as he held Steve's hand, smiling at the dark laugh his husband was letting out…
"I see, if you excuse us ladies, my fiancé and I had an urgent matter to discuss." Tony stated ignoring the shrieks the women let out when they heard the word 'fiancé'. Steve on the other hand just smiled widely and accept being led by Tony, who wanted to be as far away as he can from the party and everyone in it; it was only when Tony and Steve went into the balcony that Tony finally let Steve go, hate and anger war inside of him as he remembered how Ty dared to show his face after years and years of absence. "You wanted his name, right?" Tony asked turning to Steve who tilted his head in confusion. "The person who raised his hand at me?" Tony clarified, and Steve's face became blank as a statue before nodding his head. "What will you do if I tell you his name?" Tony asked, wanting to know what Steve's answer will be, Tony
I hope you enjoy this chapter, and I promise to update the next one soon!
"Five seconds… before I break some idiot's head… don't be that idiot Howard…" Steve said coldly making Howard let go of Steve's suit and look at the shining golden eyes that were looking down at him.
Steven gave Philips a gentle smile when the man thanked him as he sat shakily and gaze around him, ignoring everyone's gaze.
Steven stood up and gave Loki a small smile, eyes going distant as memories start assaulting him. "Yes, it was." Steven whispered gently, so only Loki could hear him, which made the trickster's eyes widen for a second before he nodded his head and return to his book ignoring everyone who went to talk to him, as Steven walked out of the room
"I'm just saying you should move fast… last thing I heard he was dating a civilian and they are about to be bonded." Steve said just to mess with her, but the sound of his phone being broken by Natasha made him hit breaks and look at the Alpha that was looking at him with a gaping mouth. "What the heck, Natalia?" Steve snapped looking at his dead phone that was in Natasha's hand.
"OK baby, so you want a Pete story? I will tell a Pete story." Tony sniffed lying next to his son, hugging him. "So where to start… oh! I know… so one day before Captain went on a big mission to save the world and fight the evil Red Skull… he gave Mama a seed and told him to take care of it…" Tony pauses a little and gazes at his son who scrunches his nose when he stopped making Tony sighs at that returning to the story. "Mama did what Captain said and took care of the seed, day and night until one day Mama came to take care of the seed and saw a baby instead, because you see the seed was special it gives the person who takes care of it a beautiful baby, so Mama took the baby and decided to name him Peter…" An 'A' for the originality and being able to think of the story in the spot, his son didn't complain so Tony took that as a good sign.
P.P.S: Some of you lovely readers asked me if Steven is empowered in this story, the answer is…
Steve couldn't help but scream at the sight, part of Steve was in denial, refusing to believe that the man who spoke with him and putting healthy snacks in his cart was shot. They were talking not a few minutes ago, how did this happen? Bucky just held Steve tightly, giving the scene behind him a fast look before dragging Steve away, nearly carrying Steve as he rushed away, going to the back of the supermarket where the back door no doubt existed.
"It's OK; he probably didn't get the invitation or something." Tony said as he pastes a small smile, turning in Steve's embrace to give him a kiss on the lips, letting out a soft purr in the back of his throat when one of Steve's hands start playing with a strand of his hair, trying to distract him from his thoughts; the doorbell rang, making the two of them break their kiss and give each other a confusing look before Tony shook his head and smiled at his fiancé. "Probably Rhodey forgetting something, I will answer it, can you be a dear and help with the living room?" Tony asked, getting a kiss from his fiancé before Steve turned to the living room.
The door opened showing Captain America in the flesh that made Tony pause a little, Peter who looked up after smelling the familiar scent, called the Captain happily in joy from Tony's lap stretching his arms toward the Captain wanting to be picked up and hugged again. That display made Tony froze in fear, after all Steve Rogers was a stranger, his fated mate but a stranger so for his baby to be strangely attached to someone that the Captain only saw when he rescued the two of them was bad, and an Omega trying to force parentage on someone, this was something that will make any Alpha enrage.
Steve sobbed as he heard the Italian accented voice of the AI call by that name. Long-time ago, when Steve married his love, he wanted to change his last name to Stark, to tell his love that he loves and adore him too much to care about last names, but unfortunately, Fury refused, saying the world needs Steve Rogers more than they needed Steve Stark, his Tony had looked so crushed but agreed with Fury. He was so happy to hear someone call him that, especially in a voice that resembles Maria Stark's (He spent a lot of nights going from video to video from Tony's childhood that he would never forget her voice) Steve cough a little and wince taking a deep breath. "S… a-activate... th-e mis... missile…to h-here..." Steve stuttered, making the AI paused if that was even possible...
A shriek came out from the TV. causing everyone to blink their eyes as they took in the crazy person, who was kicking and shrieking, talking about demons and assassins and ripped dicks?! His upper and lower body was drenched in blood and his chest had a tattoo of a skull that cried tears of blood.
The paramedics were fast, they took the Omega and put him on the stretcher while giving him a few shots and made sure he was stable when they rushed up to the ambulance car that was waiting for them, everything was fine until they reached the pup, as soon as they touched the pup and tried to separate him from Steve, the pup start thrashing and screaming in his already hoarse voice.
How hard can it be? Tony asked himself as he marched to his workshop, planning on doing it in his lab, the fear of Steve waiting for him in the gym is too high for Tony to consider going there; Tony really doesn't need his blood pressure going through the roof too, he already has enough on his plate. Tony come prepared though, he came prepared with a yoga mat, sports drinks, everything! Again how hard can yoga be? You just have to repeat a few poses and stay in them for a little amount of time before moving on to the next pose, easy! Pepper always tried to make him do yoga, so it was no harm in trying, especially when yoga seemed to calm Pepper down, maybe it will help calm him a little, and if it didn't work then Tony will move on and try another thing, no harm done.
"Yes, Tony found a good home for us… away from here…"
"I want you to know that just because I agreed to the therapy; it doesn't mean that I am going to like it." The Omega ends up saying after a while of silence which made the Alpha chuckle and nods his head.
Finally! An update!
As Tony predicted, that day caused more than a rift between him and the Alpha, but it also caused distrust between his pup and Steve. The small boy still didn't believe that Steve was a good man and that Tony was the one who hurt him, and because of that, Tony was forced to watch in misery as Steve avoided him and Peter. He was forced to watch as his boy closed in on himself, just like how he had been before when the two of them were saved from Stane's hands. He was forced to watch his family as they walked around eggshells around him and his pup… And it was breaking Tony. If he thought that being a victim of Stane hurt, this hurt even more and it was breaking Tony more than Stane could ever hope to.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, violence, mention of characters' death, anxiety, near-death experience, alcoholism, mention of therapy, near mental breakdown, Peggy Carter as Captain America, and who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Father!" The sound of a delightful child made Steven blink and turn his gaze toward the sound, feeling the king letting go of his arm and search for the sound too, and then Steven saw him, a child no older than his James, probably the same age, running through the crowd of people until he reached the Iron King jumping in the Alpha's arms when he did, which made the Omega raise his brow at that, especially when the Alpha's demander soften and he held the pup tightly crooning something in his ear.
Harley knew that Mr. Tony was kind, he knew Mr. Tony saved him from bad things that were going to happen to him if he stayed on the street and he also convinced Mr. Steve to hurry the adoption process so Harley would go live with them. He knows that Mr. Steve was kind and that Pete would always have his back. It didn't stop Harley from waiting for Mr. Tony to convince Mr. Steve and Peter to return Harley to the clinic; it didn't stop him from thinking of the worse and brace himself for the bad future that was going to happen. That's why Harley needed to be prepared, that's why he had to stop from getting attached to the Rogers family more than he already did.
Whatever Peggy Carter wanted to say next was cut off by the sound of small footsteps running toward them, causing Tony to tense at the thought of Peter and Harley returning; Tony doesn't know what Peter's reaction to seeing his biological mother would be like, but Tony hoped to avoid a relapse after all these years of Peter doing fine. "Tony…" Harley's voice made Tony turn fast to the boy, fearing that Peter was with him, when he saw that Peter wasn't here, Tony couldn't help but relax a little bit, ignoring the fuming woman beside him. "Come on, we need to go…" Harley said causing Tony's eyebrows to furrow when Harley stood beside Tony trying to pull him toward Clint's house.
Everyone watched as Tony's jaw fell on the ground. "That was Steve's order?" The Alpha squeaked which made his face turn red in embarrassment. "Traitors! That's it I will give you to MIT for free! Do you know how many times Dummy sprayed me with that fucking extinguisher over the years?" Tony snapped at the AI, only getting a dray answer in return.
The second is Addams Family AU! "He Is An Addams" With Steve Rogers being an Addams who is madly in love with Tony and trying to desperately court the man who seemed to reject him every time he tried, it's a funny story with a twisted sense of humor that you needed to read after this dark chapter…
Poor, poor Steve!
Finally! I am back after so long! The finals kicked me down but I made it!
"His office… he came from the S.I. to take something or stay? I don't really know…" Bucky grumbled, returning back to his own book, muttering something under his breath that was too low for Steve to hear but it made Steve concern at the dark look in Bucky's eyes and how the Alpha held his book tightly. Steve promised himself that he was going to talk with Bucky later, he just need to catch Tony first before his husband make a run for it, and then Steve wouldn't see him until it was dark again.
So today was the day. The day that Tony tried to avoid for many months, but had accepted as what it is; today was the day that Tony had dreaded and anticipated for months and months now. Today was his wedding day. It was so funny that Tony thought about it now, it was so funny for him to remember that he spent months trying to avoid this wedding, thinking that he would end up doomed and cursed by marrying Steve. It was laughable thinking about it now, because when Tony finally opened his eyes after the unsavory incidents that kept happening around him; he realized that Steve really liked him and wanted what's the best for him.
Tony only managed to take a few deep breathes, looking at his baby, Tony could only bite his lower lip and close his eyes. Tony could only kiss Morgan's forehead as he lowers himself on one of the chairs, gazing at his daughter who was huffing and moving her tiny arms in an angry fashion. Tony could only give a trembling smile, his mind already resigned to his death… it would be OK, Tony would be OK if the town promised him not to hurt his baby if they promised him they would protect her from everyone that would harm her, Tony would accept death with opened arms, he would accept being killed if it meant his baby was going to live her life.
"He couldn't… not after discovering that Howard was the one who was paying Sunset to date, Tony, because she was the proper Omega in Howard's eyes that Tony should mate… he was scared that Howard will do something to the Omega considering that he didn't come from money." Rhodey said which made Maria's lips wobble remembering the Omega that made Tony so crushed when he learned about her.
Anton will greet him like this every time he saw him, playing his games even when he couldn't see him, only his light.
A lot of things also took place in those months, and one of them the production of the design that Tony created; like his dad and Aunt Peggy predict, the machine did lead to chaos, Omegas' rights had launch once again with intensity the chance of standing equal with Alphas and Betas were too much to pass. Like Steve predict though, there were those who resist the machine; those were traditionalists whose minds lay in stone, thinking Alphas should constantly be supreme to Omegas, that they have the right to determine the Omegas' future, thankfully Steve handled them, on Live TV, informing them to 'Fuck off' an action that made Tony laugh breathless every time he remembered Steve's deadpanned face as he said those cusses on National TV in an irritated voice like he has so much better things to accomplish than remind close-minded individuals that they can't hold someone's freedom and that people has the rights to make their own decisions.
"Not so rude, when you practically bring a child with the same hair color and skin ton as you to the house, tell me Stark, how long have you been cheating on Steven?" Natasha gave a smirk as she walked toward Tony and Steve, probably thinking that she finally managed to drop one on Tony; the woman had been practically hounding him like a leech for years trying to find something imperfect with him. so far, out of every annoying Avengers, Bruce was his favorite, even when the man still glare at him sometimes he was still a friend; followed by Bucky who ended up being desperate enough that he proposed being the second husband and even accepted being in a threesome relationship if it meant being with Steve… that man is persistent, Tony had to give him that.
(See the end of the chapter for
, then we can go to your parents' villa and tell them about our wedding!" Steve exclaimed happily, stars sparkling in his eyes making Tony's twitch until what crazy Addams said made sense.
"Come sit, let me treat this…" Steve whispered his voice refused to come out normally, fearing that whoever trespassed into their home was still there. Guiding Bucky with him, Steve went to the kitchen to find the first aid kit he always kept in full stock, a habit he couldn't shake no matter how many years that passed. "Please take a seat, Bucky; I will come in a minute." Steve ordered as he went to find the kit.
The sky was overcast, sending down a light drizzle of rain; Tony walks up the trail to the main road, his umbrella in hand, seeking to stop himself from running in excitement at the prospect of finally meeting Pepper and Rhodey again. The little parking lot across the road is empty, and Tony zips up his coat and hides under his umbrella while he waits. The trees around him shudder, sending down a flurry of dead pine needles. Tony’s heart skips a beat and he glances up, hoping to see a woodpecker or maybe a falcon. There is nothing there; and Tony sigh in exasperation, hating how stressed and restless he was these days.
"Yeah, I'm fine; he was just being an asshole." Tony said waving the whole thing away, giving his friends a soft smile, hiding the uneasy and shakiness he was feeling, his mind was still going over and over what Ty just said about the monster in the lake, which caused shivers to go down Tony's spine.
"I don't know… though this does remind what happened years ago when I had to save your butt more than once from bullies?" Steve asked just to be a little shit as he sat on his chair, Peter's eyes widened at that and his jaw fell a little at the words he heard, though Tony jumped as soon as he heard those words yelling out the words 'All lies!' which did nothing but make Steve roll his eyes.
"I'm certain this is nonsense. Even a star of your statue and wisdom can still burn brilliantly, for stars grow wiser and stronger with age." Thor offered, his bewildered and uncertain words made a fleeting smile to grace Steven's lips, how naïve of the son of Odin to seek to comfort him, thinking that he was older than he was, if only he knew that not age had taken Steven's shine, but loving a mortal that was standing on the same room as him.
A part of Tony was still in denial about the date… well about the second part of the date, the first part was pleasant enough, it was the second part that made Tony want to run to the hills; everyone and their mother knew that Tony will never ever get inside a cemetery even with the threat of death, not after what he saw the day of his parents' burial. Hell! Tony gave Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy a strict instruction in his will; that if he to ever die in the field, they are to cremate him and dump him in the bottom of the sea.
I had to write and rewrite the chapter many times because I felt that it was a little chaotic? I had to take down a lot of scenes too because it was getting longer and I probably wouldn't have the time next week and the week after it to write or post chapters to any of my stories.
Finally gathering the courage needed; Tony opened his eyes, blinking them a few times before looking at the hand that caressed his cheek. Following the hand, Tony found the owner of the hand, and his breath hitched when his eyes fell on Steve; Steve, who was gazing at Tony with a soft look on his face, Steve who was awake.
The person was sitting near one of the rivers staring at the sky, with a pen in his hand and stacks of papers in the other writing something in them every few minutes, and he wondered to himself what the man was gazing at, so he floats toward the man and looked down on him hoping to see what he was writing, and he was answered by that when the man raised his head saying.
"Yeah, yeah, I know I rock; I make you speechless. All in all good choice with the clothes though, Steve would really love that you have chosen this suit. I heard he was planning to take you to the cemetery today in the witching hour to torture some souls; a very romantic date if you asked me." The woman grin, an insane glee shining in her eyes like she knows a secret that Tony doesn't, which made the inventor gulp in fear, his mouth suddenly as dry as the desert.
"I don't know…" Tony ends up saying as his eyes fell on a painted portrait of his face, and he felt his heart flutter in his chest with happiness... he wasn't forgotten. "But I'm home." Tony smiled a little at that which caused his family to look at him with happiness, Tony turned to his pup fast, when his baby let out a surprised cry.
"Tony, please listen to me!" Howard plea with his son, hoping that the young Omega will see reason, Tony was seventeen! For God's sake! What does he know about raising a child when he was a child himself? Fuck the world if they knew about the situation, but Tony couldn't handle this, the baby will ruin him, will ruin the future the Omega always wanted, for as long as Howard could remember, the Omega always wanted to be recognized by people, wanted to show them that Omegas can be as good as Alphas maybe even better, but with a baby, the shareholders wouldn't even look at him twice, they will strike him down before he had the chance to stand up!
The sound of the doorbell caused Tony to blink, wondering who the person on the other side was; considering most of his friends would just barge in and make themselves at home after complaining about their day. Wiping his hands Tony looked around to see that he nearly finished the sandwiches, causing him to hum and walk to the door, trying to think about who was knocking on his door, was it Bucky forgetting about his keys and running from Winnie once more? Tony lost count on how many times Bucky escaped from his home after Winnie started pestering him about having kids and marrying Natasha.
"Nah, I will manage, besides, I will probably stop at the kids' section to see a few interesting stories for my little munchkin, what do you say, Morgan, do you want Daddy to read you some new stories?" Tony cooed, nuzzling his baby, and smiling happily when her baby scent reached his nose. "I will be back in a few minutes!" Tony grinned waving to Maria as he turned to continue his way, trying to ignore how Maria frowned at his retreating back.
"Now, now, Steve, the pup's face become red, let go of him or I will stop you." Tony said with an amused smile that caused the Alpha to turn to Tony the twinkle in the Alpha's eyes caused the Omega to narrow his eyes at the huge Alpha, but it didn't stop the smile from taking over.
The man grunt in distaste at that, taking a step back and raised his gun, making Tony pause at that and snarl. "Now, now Tony, I wouldn't do that if I was you." He said making Tony growl at that and gaze at Stan with hate. "You know all of this wouldn't have happened if you just accept being my mate… I would have treated you well." That made Tony snort.
They waited for over an hour before someone came in and to Steven's displeasure; it was the Iron King himself and his advisors who showed up, the king going directly toward Steven's cell, while the advisors went to the servants. "Did you change your mind?" The king asked, just like how he has been asking the same question for two days now, something that always got him a harsh glare from Steven, which caused the Alpha to snarl at him, and Steven… well, he was used to this kind of Alphas so it didn't faze him not one a bit.
/Warning/: This chapter contains cursing, a little bit of sadness, a little bit of violence (?), a lot of time skips, feelings, therapy, and fluffiest fluffy fluff! And Tony finally gets a day off, and Peter is precious! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
A boy with dark brown hair, familiar blue eyes, and a familiar cheeky smile, with a fearless persona, as he went around the place looking for troubles, causing everyone to have heart failure as they try to protect the small boy. Familiar eyes that Fury finally saw, with decades between the last time he saw them and the now; part of Fury, the small part that is hidden under layers of scars and betrayals and pain couldn't help but light the spark of hope, a spark that Fury couldn't help but try to ignore to stop the heartache that will follow.
So what do you think?
"J.A.R.V.I.S. ignore her and take me to Howard Stark." Steve mocked her which made the woman's face flush at that and for her face to become red in anger but the ping and the voice coming from above made them stop.
Tony growled as he stalked toward his mansion, planning on killing Steve on the spot; this was it! He was done, so, so done! It was on thing to have Steve stalk him and be creepy, it was another that his cousin comes and threatened Tony like she own him. Tony was so going to find Steve and give him a good kick between his legs, while wearing his armor! No one, not even Barnes will stop him from taking his revenge on that crazy Addams; if only there was a way for Tony to cause Steve to fall out of love.
"That's why I said you were a child Tony." These words made the Omega pout and held in any reply he wanted to give Steven last the man change his mind about him going out with Steve. "Did Rogers tell you that?" Steven asked already planning on pummeling Rogers to the ground.
These dreams, these fantasies, they refused to leave him, and after thinking it through, Anthony realized that there was nothing to stop him and Steve from having that life, Anthony could even change his name to Carbonell, he could finally stop being a Stark, he could have the perfect life with Steve, he could open his own garage and work in it, he could buy the dream house Steve and him always talked about, the two of them could create their own family like they always dreamed of, naming their children with the few named the two of them chose. Anthony wanted that life so desperately…
Steve let out a '
"I swear baby it was not me, I will never do that! You know me." Tony plea with the Omega as he followed him to the kitchen, hoping the Omega will understand, his words though only made Steve give an empty laugh, causing Tony to inhale at that.
"It can't be…" Tony breathed out as he ripped the envelope, his breath hitching when the ultrasound pictures greeted him, making Tony pale as realization painted itself over his face, when he raised his eyes toward James; the Alpha was looking at him with his emotionless face, causing something inside Tony to snap at that. "You! Ever since you came here, ever since you showed your goddamn face here… all of this is your fault!" Tony snarled as he rushed toward James, punching him with all of his strength causing the Alpha to stumble and fall down.
"I know how to clean well, Mama, Margaret taught me how." The pup peeped out which made the Alpha's eyes widen with shock and for his jaw to fall a little, then anger clouded his eyes as he looked at the Omega's smug smirk, a growl left the Alpha and he nearly screamed at the foolish Omega and his pup who just wasted the chance of a lifetime in happiness for lowly slaves.
Steve and Tony got a routine of their own now, something that made Tony happy, it really made him happy that Steve can drop his son at Tony's home without being stress when Sarah or Winnie wasn't in their respectable homes (Thanks to Clint and him voting for Tony being the babysitter of the whole neighborhood) Saturday and Sunday were spent at the clinic, with Steve and Peter going to their therapist and Tony going to his before going to the children's section to take care of the kids, a lot of whom Peter made friends with, chattering happily with them and playing, even listening to their stories and getting to know them, Tony can say that Steve always feels proud that his son was reaching out, the Alpha became one of the volunteers.
He was told a lot of things that made his head spin, he was told about colored TVs, about mobile phones, new movies, music, cultures, new everything. He was told how the world starts moving faster than it was in the forties, how lots of things changed but didn't at the same time… He was told lots of things…
So what do you think?
"Sleep…" Steve mumbled as he throws his pillow and blanket on the carpet arranging them in the way he used to when he slept in Tony's room pulling an all-nighter trying to fix Dummy, Goose, was sitting beside him waiting for him to finish so they could go to sleep.
"I came here to see why the Joke and laughing stoke of the galaxy is trying to capture me!" Steve said in a snappish tone, sidestepping Tony and holding the raccoon in his hand toward his teammate, which made the four of them look at the rodent who was frozen in his place like a stone; they were probably wondering why the rodent was frozen in his place like an obedient kitten and not making a move. What Steve heard from passing, was that those guardians all had an unsavory temper, especially the small rodent in his hand, so it was no doubt shocking to his friends to see him that way. Unfortunately for them, they didn't account for Steve's explosive temper that he was famous for; a temper that even his caretaker stated would be the death of many who cross him.
…" Steve heard Tony murmured, probably to himself, not realizing that Steve can perfectly hear him. "
"Tony, darling, what happened?" Peggy asked him in a motherly voice after returning to her home, only thirty minutes after Bucky and Tony; it took Tony only a few seconds before he starts sobbing, telling Peggy and Bucky what happened early that morning, wondering if they will consider him crazy when he didn't even have scars or wounds to verify his story, at best they will think it was a nightmare that got him shaking so bad, at worse, they will think that he lost his mind.
Steven looked at the man wanting to take the hot kettle and throw at his face while watching as the man screamed at the burns and pain he will get, but the Omega pressed his lips tightly, already knowing that the Alpha wanted the Omega to react like a savage so he doesn't care about the punishment he will serve to his friends and babe because for one he was not breaking their deal. "Let me phrase my words then, I am not asking, I am demanding." The Omega stressed his words like he was talking to a child, an action that made a snarl appear on the Alpha's face, but the man stayed in his place looking at the Omega with narrow eyes. "I think that we both know that I will not crack and accept your offer, just as we both know that it is impossible to finish a week worth of work in one day, but as you can see, I managed… you asked me to be your slave in exchange for my people's freedom, but until now I have yet to see any truth that you followed through your promise." The Omega said through gritted teeth his grip tightening on the mug in his hands.
"Mr. Carbonell… it is a surprise to see you, I thought you have already left the town." Fury said once Tony entered the room, lowering the phone in his hand before clicking it shut, his attention turning completely to Tony who walked inside the room and took a seat on one of the chairs in front of Fury. "Why did you come here, Mr. Carbonell?" Fury asked his eyes darting to Morgan and a frown takes over his face for a split second; the action didn't go unnoticed by Tony who glared at the man and held his baby tightly.
The Omega though… the strange Omega who Fury was told was the Hydra king's mate looked familiar. Not the king of familiar that Fury saw when he was doing one of his undercover mission, but the kind of familiar like the Alpha had spent a long time living and growing with him. That by itself was strange, for Fury was almost certain that he doesn't know who the Omega was.
“So you know…” Sarah scowled at Tony, her face darken by the second, as she tried to calm herself down, probably before she does something she will regret. “I’m doing nothing wrong; I’m trying to protect my family! I control my son’s life, you say? I’m protecting him from making the same mistake he did with that Carter woman! It wasn’t enough my son had to suffer because of her, but my grandson too! And you! You are nothing but a potential heartbreak and pain that will destroy my family once more after it took years to recover! You talk about me being a domineering and shit, but you are ignoring the fact that you are trying to replace your dead pup and your wayward mate with my family!” Sarah took a threatening step toward Tony, but the Omega didn’t move, standing in his place showing the Alpha that he wasn’t backing out, no matter how many barbs the older woman throws his ways, no matter how it hurt when she mentioned his dead child or how she implied that he was whoring himself to have him.
"T… Tony?" Steve mumbled as he lowered his hand, opening his eyes and blinking them a few times before he stilled on Tony who was kneeling beside him, touching him everywhere he can just to confirm that he was real. "What… what happened?" Steve asked, only to get a lapful of a crying Tony who couldn't believe that Steve was in front of him after a year of seeing him die. The loud cry of
At that Tony snarled and snatched the phone from Steve's hand, not that Steve was going to object, not when he was too frozen from shock to do anything other than shiver. "Who the fuck are you, asshole?" Tony growled, which only gain him a dark chuckle from the other side of the phone. "Do you know who I am? I will destroy you! If you ever dared to call this number once more you have no one but yourself to blame!" Tony hissed his hackle rose when the chuckle at the other end turned into a burst of booming laughter.
Sam closed his eyes tightly as that as he starts massaging his forehead, he then put the card in his pocket and took his phone to dial the number he wants.
But in the end, Tony managed to calm down enough to start thinking about his pregnancy without panicking about dead children and the mess that was his first pregnancy. After thinking long and hard, Tony realized that part of him was content with the pregnancy, even happy that he managed to get pregnant; Tony knew that Steve would have his back and is probably overjoyed at the notion of Tony being pregnant, even when the two of them adopted Harley not even three months ago.
Finally! The wedding is here!
" Hearing that made Steven pale and a choked gasp to leave him which made a man with a shoulder-length dark hair and green eyes look at him with narrow eyes, and he whispered something to the redhead which made her frown.
"Sorry…" Tony mumbled as he stood up, smiling at the squeal his baby let out as Tony nuzzled his baby's head; from the corner of his eyes, Tony saw how Maria's eyes soften a little at the action and he couldn't help but relax a little bit, just a little. "What do you say, Miss Morgan? Did you like the books Miss Maria gave you?" Tony cooed, getting a babbling reply from his daughter as she waved her hands around. "I think she is saying yes!" Tony grinned, his shoulders relaxing when Maria shook her head with a small smile…
Steve felt himself became lightheaded and faintly he could hear the heart monitor became crazy, his breath was coming out in a chocked gasps and he wondered for a second if he was having a panic attack, or maybe a heart attack? He doesn't know but he thinks he was going to faint any minute now.
10-Og hver gætir þú verið, munnlegur? -And who might you be, mouthy one?
"I have every right… it was that or jail, remember." Steve's final word seemed to be the last straw because Carter growled darkly, turning to Tony with murderous eyes as if she was blaming him for what was happening to her, Tony could only stand straight, his head held high as he dared the woman to do something to him where everyone is waiting for them.
"I refuse to marry that harlot or that bastard of a brother she has! I am the king! I decide who I will mate and have children with! Everyone knows that my actions with Hamar were justified especially when I am the law!" Anton growled at the piece of metal he was working on; probably daring it to say otherwise, daring it to return Anton's words with mockery and refusal, and hoping secretly that his friends will have his side in this, which they all were, but there was no refusing the elders this time. Anton knew it was past his marriage time, everyone reminds him of that, that every year passes without marriage his judgment became doubtful in everyone's eyes; Anton knew that he should have married years ago with all of their friends when his age was twenty. Anton knew he shouldn't have waited for the Omega who ended up breaking his heart, because of that, Anton probably knew about everyone in the village being disappointed with him living a loner life with no Omega to care of him or his babe, to give him stability in life.
A hushed voice murmured, causing the hair on the back of Steve's neck to stand on its ends; Steve shifted in his place, gazing at his side and shook Tony causing the Alpha to open his eyes and frown at Steve, only to wake up when Steve's terrified eyes gaze back at him. "Who are you?" Steve hissed, trying not to stutter as he opened the speaker on Tony's cue.
Was the only thing Tony's scared mind could think. "Fine, stay you asshole, I will leave!" Snarled Tony as he turned around, already planning to make a run for it when he reaches the front door, even with a pregnant belly, Tony knows that if he reached the lake at least he will be safe.
What is Tony going to do?
The person he was talking about was a woman with dark hair, dark eyes, and pale skin like death, and was wearing too much black to be normal. "Who the hell are you?" Tony asked as he took the woman in, her face was youthful and beautiful, but her eyes were as blank as a dead fish, it was giving him the chills.
"Goodnight, sweetie…" Tony whispered as he tried to get comfortable, thrusting his face into Steve's pillow, hoping that his mate's calming scent would calm him down; Tony promised to give Fury hell when Steve come back; just before Tony finally falls asleep, he heard a small whisper of
… Tony wanted to say, million other sentences trapped behind his lips waiting to be let out, words of pleas, to beg the Alpha in front of him to tell him that his baby was alive, that he wasn't dead like everyone always ended up saying, words of hate and rage, at how cruel the world was to take his only babe away from the safe heaven that Tony provided, words of betrayal, for how his father was so weak that he let Stane manipulate him how he wanted, how no matter what good intentions the Alpha had for his son, he always goes at it the wrong way, how it had been a year and a half since the Alpha gave up on being able to mend his relationship with Tony, and end up running away to Malibu to deal with his heartbreak there, not calling Tony anymore after being rejected by him again and again…
"I am sorry Peg… but Shield is Hydra." That made Peggy gasp and look at Steven who was looking at her sadly. "In 2013, Hydra revealed itself to the world, intending to use 'Project Insight'…" Peggy and Tony tensed which made Steven sigh sadly at the thought that this part in this world happened. "It started with Hydra sending their assassin The Winter Soldier…" Natasha tense at the name, anyone who saw her will think that the small frown on her face was one of confusion, but Steven who knew Natasha for a long time, he knew that she was afraid after all Bucky was the only one who was able to best her, but that small fear in her eyes meant that Bucky was alive, out there with Hydra but alive. "To kill the commander of Shield, which in my world was Nick Fury… the assassin was not what we all thought of…" He wanted to tell them that the soldier was Bucky, that Bucky was out there alive, but looking at Steve's face, something in him shut the idea down… it was not the time for anyone but Peggy and possibly Fury to know about what's going to take a place. "He was a POW an American soldier from World War Two, he was tortured, brainwashed, and was forced to kill, we were able to expose Hydra and their sleeping agents, which caused the fall of Shield, which was later on created once again by Fury in 2023… as for the soldier we were able to save him, he became an Avenger in the end." Steven said which made everyone look in at each other.
"Hello sweetheart, how was work?" Steve asked as he turned toward the Omega with a soft smile, which made the Omega give a wobbly smile and walk toward the Alpha, hugging him from behind tightly, which made the Alpha pause a little in his steering. "Love, did something happen?" Steve asked in a gentle voice, words only meant for Tony to hear, making the Omega take a shuddered breath.
"No… no, sorry forget about that." Tony waved his hand off, hoping that Steve will forget his insensitive question and how Tony forgets the most basic thing, and that is; Steve can't function unless it was night. Which was strange, considering that Steve was a star, and stars shine all time without getting tired or sleepy or whatever, considering that they are huge balls of gas. Thor told them that it was the space stone's fault, which was enough answer for all of them.
Puffs of breaths left Anton as he walked through the forest; his breaths were frozen in front of him in the form of white clouds, informing Anton of how cold and freezing the forest was becoming. Winter was coming. A fact that Anton doesn't know if it was bliss or a curse, especially after the events that continued to happen, leaving Anton stunned. It was a week since everything went as bad as it can go by the arrival of Tyber and his sister, so bad, that Anton wondered how the village was still standing without burning to ashes.
"God fucking dammit, baby; you feel amazing, sweetheart." Tony ground out through his teeth, trying to keep himself calm. Taking a few minutes to calm down before he starts moving his hips to thrust into Steve's tight wet heat.
Though Steve could do without his son taking Tony Stark as his rule model in the engineering world, his pup took a strange fascination to the man, always telling Steve about the invents that the Alpha made, it made Steve concern that Peter recognize his father, but the pup only had an old picture of his father, and Anthony looked so different from Tony Stark that someone might consider them two different people. Steve let it go to the fact that Tony Stark was considered the most genius inventor in all of America after his father, that when he wasn't chasing skirts half of the times, May thought that it was cute how the pup got someone to look up to, so after May persuading him, he finally let it go.
Steve walked passed this room every night, every night sleep refuses to come to him, every night he felt suffocated by the ice in his lungs, every night he felt like he was about to breakdown. Steve didn't know why, but it was probably because fatigues, and not being able to sleep for four days. But that day… that day, Steve stood outside of that room. Looking at the dark brown door that had a little chipped paint on the sides, Steve raised his hand and put it on the handle; he thought about leaving, that the door was closed, that he shouldn't invade the privacy of this room… but something was calling him inside…
…" His mother used to whisper these words to him when he was a child; his mother who was protective of him until the end of her life, even when she was at the end of the Hydra king's sword, she protected him until the bitter end.
"Unfortunately yes, everyone is worried sick about you, and it will be really bad if Tony and I hide you here, the police may even get involved." That caused Harley to choke a whimper and hold tightly into Steve's shirt, the action causing Steve to hum gently trying to calm the boy, kissing his forehead and pulling him away, to gaze at his brown eyes. "But don't worry sweetie; you are only staying there until Tony and I finalize the adoption, hopefully, it wouldn't take long." Steve couldn't help but smile at the wide-eyed look Harley send his way…
