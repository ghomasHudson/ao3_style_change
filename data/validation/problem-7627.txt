When Sam heard Scott say yes, he looked around to make sure he was alone before fist-pumping victoriously. No one saw it, so Sam could excuse the gesture. Sometimes you just had to celebrate a job well-done.
“Rhodey tries to be here whenever he isn’t on a mission with the air force, while Tony has been popping up more often recently then when he first ‘retired’,” Natasha answered him this time, and Scott could hear the skeptical emphasis she put on retired. “Rhodey usually tells us ahead of time, if he can’t make it, what his choice is, and Tony leaves it a surprise.”
“Get it out.”
Sam followed suit, also ignoring the exasperated Captain. “Well, I told him he could bring them, so I guess we’ll see.”
“Of course, Scott. The man is correct when he says you can ask me anything. I am installed in all of the Avengers-accessible areas for people of the correct clearance,” Friday pleasantly explained, and if Scott wasn’t already amazed, he was now by the amount of personality present in the AI’s voice. “Thank you, I appreciate it, Friday. I can call you Friday, right?”
Sam grinned and leaned forward conspiratorially. “What if I told you I knew a guy who would be an asset to our very special team?”
The team all around made various dissenting noises, and ignored Sam playfully raising a hand before lowering it and laughing at Scott’s horrified expression. The team was clearly in agreement.
“I’m always arguing with them, it’s fine.”
“I’m on it,” Natasha responded.
A predatory grin crept onto her face. “I can’t wait to watch your next circuit of interviews. You think you’ll talk to Everhart again?”
Full disclosure, this hasn't been beta read or anything, but it was burning a hole in my hard drive and I wanted to get it out before I second-guessed it.
“I write poems for you in different languages to practice,” Steve rebutted.
So to say Scott was surprised when the pilot of the Iron Man suit and the subject of several M.I.T. courses walked into the kitchen in a three-piece Tom Ford suit is a bit of an understatement. He was definitely less than prepared, which is Scott’s defense for why he knocked over his glass in shock. (Thank God it was empty.)
“Well, he has the phone numbers of some significant people in the American government to cheer him up,  and his own government to deal with,” Rhodes replied.
“Yes sir, it’s being made despite Clint’s numerous protests that he is quote, “retired”.”
Jarvis waited patiently out front with Steve, and respectfully nodded at the group as the Count and Countess dismounted. Rumiko just leaned out the window of her carriage, waving a delicate fan in the intense heat. When she noticed Steve lurking protectively behind Jarvis she choked on air, and swatted at Margaret’s arm with her fan as the lady passed by. The soldier shot her a look, but obligingly leaned over for Rumiko to excitedly tell her who the farm hand was. Margaret’s gaze sharpened with interest, and she watched the man now suspiciously watching Tiberius.
“Prince Charming, mom. Maybe it’s time for me to find my Prince Charming.”
“Wait, please,” Tony called out weakly. “I really like you, Steve, and I don’t want to ruin this. You can drive. Just forget I said anything.”
“Tony Stark,” he greets, holding a hand out to Steve.
It feels like he’s been asleep for mere minutes when his alarm clock screams shrilly at him. He
“Now, won’t you boys shake a poor sinner’s hands?” Loki questions the two. Jarvis takes one of his hands easily and Tony thinks that - if Jarvis trusts this man all of a sudden - maybe he can too? But then the remembers the unsettling feeling that he got when Jarvis was looking at that card. Maybe it isn’t such a good idea. But, before he knows it, his hand is reaching up to shake Loki’s hand without his permission.
Tony Stark stands on the bow of the boat, smiling at the crowd with dazzling white teeth. Cameras lights flash as Tony steps down the ramp that connects the boat to the dock. He takes long strides to reach the dock, grinning the whole way. There’s an air of arrogance that follows him around that makes the guys jealous and the girls swoon. His devilish good looks may help a little bit, too.
Tony rolls his eyes and slumps against the door. His arm is awkwardly caught between the door handle and his body, but he’s too focused on the way his tongue flops numbly in his mouth to care too much. After what feels like an eternity but is probably only minutes, Tony looks up to see a pink neon light that says “Bar.” Tony’s instantly drawn.
“Where to, sir?” Happy asked.
“Sorry guys, maybe next time,” he informs them. He really does need to get back to work.
“Watch your step,” Rhodey muttered as they approached a large step.
“Oh, are you kidding me with this?” Tony groaned, shooing the thing away with his good arm. “Get it out of here.”
Steve can’t help but feel a slight pang of jealousy. Prince Tony Stark is a pretty handsome man, and he wouldn’t mind getting to see him up close. The problem about guys like him is that they’re usually snooty, spoiled brats that don’t know how to handle themselves when they’re denied something that they want. Steve’s about the opposite of that and he doesn’t think he can handle someone of that caliber.
“Let’s go, Steven, your father should be home by now,” she says as she leads him down the hallway. Steve glances over his shoulder at Natasha’s open door. The last thing he hears is the barking of a puppy that Natasha receives from her dad after he tells her he’s done being a ‘pushover’.
“To the hospital please-” Pepper started.
Without even thinking about it, Tony slipped into the back of the car, allowing Happy to take the wheel.
‘You have to work to make your dreams come true, and that star there will just help give you a step in the right direction,’ his father’s words ring in his head. He sure as hell hoped that he was working hard enough to make his dreams come true.
“And he’s staying at our house as our personal guest,” her father continues.
“Your eyes are red. You’ve been crying. Tears for your long lost boss?” he sniped.
“Why do you have to make everything so difficult? I’m trying to do one nice thing for you and you have to go and throw it back in my face just because you refuse to let me drive! It’s not even that big of a deal. Maybe you are just a spoiled brat like everyone claims you are. I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt, but obviously this was a bad idea,” he ranted, sighing angrily with pure disgust evident in his eyes. He turned on his heel and started to stalk back to the tower.
*          *          *
The thought that Tony may have ruined the one good thing in his life because of his stupid need to drive made his knees feel weak. Steve was going to walk out on him, just like all the others, and it was no one’s fault but his own.
Tony awoke to lights flashing in front of his eyes. It was too bright and it hurt his eyes.
*          *          *
“You got it,” Happy called as the car pulled from the drive.
“Drinks are on me, everyone!” Tony suddenly announces. The crowd that had formed cheers and claps their hands.
“Hey Tones,” his dad greeted. “You know we were in a car crash, right?”
“Let me take a look at your hand,” he says, gingerly snatching it. It’s red and swollen and his two first knuckles are split and bloody. Tony whistles at it. Must’ve been one hell of a punch. “We’ll have to get you all fixed up.”
“Come in,” he calls, wiping the white residue from his nose as he does. The door swings open wide and, sure enough, Happy Hogan is standing in the frame.
Steve pulls away from her and wipes his eyes with the back of his jacket’s sleeve.
Sounds of agreement come from the rest of the group.
It ends with Jarvis managing to get his bulbous head stuck in a tuba and them toppling to the ground after trying to extricate him. Then, a mysterious man with bright green eyes behind a long black mop of hair’s shadow casts over them.
“Fair enough. Meet me in the lobby at eight.”
“Please wake up,” he whispered, tears streaming down his face.
“Dad invited him to the Masquerade ball tonight!”
“Don’t you question me, you powerless human. Don’t you dare,” he spits.
“Yeah. Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.”
At first, Tony didn’t react. He just kept scrolling through his blueprints on the tablet, assuming Steve was talking to someone on the phone and feeling a sudden pang of jealousy.
When they got to the bottom of the ramp of the plane, two soldiers strode over with a stretcher between them.
“Thank you. Will that be all, Mister Stark?”
“I said, ‘let me take you on a date tonight,’” he repeated.
Steve grows up and Tony makes a huge mistake.
“Daddy, I want that dress!” she informs him, pointing to a book that stands on a pedestal. It’s Sarah’s book full of designs that Natasha likes to sort through sometimes just for fun. “It would make me look pretty, doncha’ think?”
Tony smiled and nodded, following Steve out the front door.
Tony tries not to take offense to that because Steve’s expression says that he’s just genuinely curious about why an incredibly famous rockstar is occupying a dive bar. Tony can’t blame him for wondering.
Tony swings Jarvis around in circles while Jarvis sputters nonsense at him.
“You’re still moping around about that restaurant?” his boss, Phil Coulson, asks him. He laughs at Steve’s weary nod. “How close are you?”
“Let’s get the hell out of here,” Tony whispers in Steve’s ear, eager to, well, get the hell out of there. He grabs Steve’s hand and drags him out the door before the angered rookie could recover from the brutal punch directed his way.
Steve sighs. He supposes that it’s not often that he goes out anymore and he can’t blame them.
Tony nodded his head wearily at her. Sure enough, he felt a pinch in the crook of his elbow and his eyes started to droop.
“I’m so sorry about that,” Tony says to Steve when they make it outside.
“Prince Charming it is.”
The next time Tony woke up, he was lying in a bed that had scratchy blankets and a lumpy mattress. It definitely wasn’t his own bed.
“Yeah. Yeah, ‘m fine. Just let me drive.”
Tony blushes for the first time since he was a baby.
“Thank you, mama,” he stutters out. He can’t tear his eyes away from the pot full of memories to meet her eyes. He wraps her in his arms and hugs her tightly, sniffling quietly.
“Steve!” his good friend, Bucky, calls out, “Come dancing with us tonight. It’ll be fun!”
“Yes,” she replies hesitantly. It’s obvious that she feels no need to cry whatsoever.
“You okay back there, Boss?” Happy asks, eyebrows raised in question. Tony hates the skepticism that’s so clearly written on his face, noticeable even through his intoxicated haze.
Tony’s eyes water at the melody, at the lyrics. It’s clear that Steve just came up with that on the spot and that he’s nailed Tony down in one go. His voice is like something he’s never heard. It’s strong but wrapped in silk and it draws all the breath from Tony’s lungs. In one stanza, Tony’s sold.
Steve decides that maybe this is a good time to tell her. She deserves to know.
“Hap, just drop me here. I’ll call when I’m ready,” Tony says and he slips from the car as soon as it comes to a stop. He stumbles over the curb a little when his shoe’s sole catches on… well, something. He can’t tell.
“Jesus, just let me drive, Steve!” Tony snapped abruptly.
“Look, Tony, I think it would just be better if I drove, okay? You can drive next time, I promise.”
“She didn’t make it out. I’m sorry, Tony, but your mom’s gone.”
“That’s what they call me,” he mumbles as he pushes his way through the crowd assembled by the door of the bar.
“Jarvis, this good man just read my palm,” Tony notifies.
“Nope. I’m good from here. Thanks, Hap,” Tony said before sliding into the driver’s seat.
When Tony woke up, the first thing he noticed was that he was in the back of a moving car. And he wasn’t driving.
It’s moments like these that make Tony feel invincible. He holds the undivided attention of just under a hundred thousand people, and any mistake he makes is scrutinized. Every perfectly-pitched note worshipped. He holds these people in the palm of his hand and he can sculpt them however he pleases. He loves this feeling, but he hates it, too.
Steve smiles after them before telling Phil that he’s taking his break. He rushes to the building that he plans to establish his restaurant in and puts the down payment on it, thanking the two men as they leave. He studies the run down building and pictures the transformation that it’ll undertake when it becomes a restaurant.
“Well now, why don’t you open the door?” his mother asks. He nods and pushes open the blue doors to reveal a dank and destroyed building. It’s the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen.
Steve’s dad makes sure that his mother knows just how good the gumbo is, and that a gift like Steve’s cooking deserves to be shared. His dad tells Steve to invite everyone over for dinner. That’s how everyone in his small neighborhood gathers at his house, gobbling down some hot gumbo.
“This was important, Tony. R&D said they’d be willing to wait for another half hour for you, but no longer. Can you please do this for me, just this one time?”
“I’d be better if I had some more booze,” Tony says with a lopsided grin. “I’m sure we can find something around here somewhere.”
He doesn’t remember being any more tired than he was at that moment but he refused to be rolled down the ramp in a wheelchair. Rhodey reached out a hand and helped Tony to his feet, supporting him as he made his way toward Pepper and Happy.
“This should be just fine, Tasha. This’ll cover it!” He hugs the money to his chest. He can put the down payment on the restaurant he’s been looking at with all these bills!
Steve takes his hand and leads him outside, where Happy is waiting with the car. Tony’d called him not too long ago and told him to be ready to go out for the night. Tony opens the door for Steve and waits for him to get settled safely in the backseat before crossing to the other side and getting in himself. He watches in amusement as Steve takes in the luxury vehicle and the fact that they have a personal driver at their beck and call.
“Have him home by eleven!” Bucky calls from on stage still, laughing. It’s already 1:30 a.m.
“It caught me completely by surprise,” he informs him. Except, really, it hadn’t. He’s been crowned king for the past five years.
Steve’s mother, Sarah, reads Natasha’s favorite story out loud while tailoring the new pink bow that will go on Natasha’s dress. It’s the story of the Princess and the Frog and Steve can’t say that he loves it as much as Natasha because, really, the thought of kissing a frog grosses him out. Natasha leans forward in anticipation when the ‘best part’ comes up; the one where the princess kisses the frog and the frog turns into a handsome prince. Natasha giggles happily and cheers for it to be read again, but Steve just shakes his head in disgust.
Steve catches onto his tone and makes an inquiring noise. It’s something that Tony could easily dodge, but for some reason, he feels compelled to tell Steve. He shoots him a sidelong glance to make sure he’s really listening, really cares. And Steve’s just looking him earnestly, his brows slightly drawn and lips taking a small downward turn. He’s concerned.
“Now you, Tony, come from across the sea. You come from three long lines of royalty, am I correct? You have an eccentric lifestyle, but your funds are low and mum and dad cut you off, did they?” Loki hums with feigned innocence.
He sings one of his more intimate pieces from his first ever album and he tries to keep his pronunciation clear, though he’s not sure he succeeds. Halfway through his performance, he thinks he can make out the vague shape of Steve appear behind the blinding lights that glare onto the stage. His heart flutters a little and he’s quick to wrap up the rest of the song, eager to go out with Steve.
Tony knows that if he was able to move, he would have recoiled from those harsh words. Mum and dad never really cared enough to give him the time of day, let alone money.
That’s when Tony started to cry in earnest. Gulping sobs wracked his tiny body and pinkish tears dripped from his face.
pokes it with his toe before dragging himself out of bed and throwing on one of the few outfits he has. He brushes his hair and teeth before running out of the door and hopping on a trolley that passes by his house.
He croons breathily, his voice just barely ghosting over the microphone. It doesn’t matter, though, because the crowd is silent and still. Each inhale and exhale crackles and rumbles over the sold-out stadium, each word desperately hung onto by adoring fans. Seemingly, the only thing to be heard within a one-mile radius is the smooth voice of Tony Stark and nothing else.
He manages to break through the swarm of people and get to the front of the crowd where Tony sings and strums his guitar, cackling with a boy who dances around like he has ants in his pants. His perfected carefree and charming mask is most definitely slipped on. Jarvis still notices the way that Tony’s eyes widen a fraction when he gets bumped unexpectedly by a fan or the way that his eyes reflect something similar to a cornered animal. The last kidnapping had taken a toll on him and he doesn’t think that he’ll ever see those bright chocolate eyes the same ever again. At least, not as innocent as they were before. There’s something cold lurking beneath the surface, but Jarvis doesn’t ask. He knows that he needs time and time is something that Jarvis has.
“That’s great, Stevie! Well, we best be going now. Bye!”
“Thanks. So do you,” he mumbled, ducking his head.
It makes Tony feel very uneasy.
Natasha and her dad both stand before strutting out the door.
There was no way that Steve was talking to him, right? There was no way that Captain America, the symbol of all things good and holy, would want to date him, Tony Stark.
“That is some of the best gumbo that I have ever tasted,” he tells Steve sincerely before gathering him in his arms. “I love it, thanks bud.”
Steve, Natasha, Sam, Tony, Rhodey, Vision, and Wanda were all assembled around the table, which was piled high with admittedly delicious looking food. Tony tapped something on his phone, and a hologram declaring, “WELCOME AVENGER SCOTT LANG” was beamed into the air.
“Yeah, and from what I can tell, he did what he did with good motives. Maybe less than stellar methods, but I respect why he did it. Sometimes what’s right isn’t what’s legal,” Steve firmly stated, and Sam couldn’t help his smile. The guy really did make you want to applaud and follow him into battle when he talked like that.
They bickered for several more minutes, before Tony managed to eke out a win in the stubbornness department, getting the boy to agree to at least give the lessons a try. Tony was about to gloat about his victor when Steve spoke up again.
Jarvis pretended to be busy with the stove, and his tone was deceptively light. “You can tell him. I have it on good authority that you’re quite lovable.”
Tony had matured into a man before everyone’s eyes.
Sam nodded. “Yeah, he wanted me to check with you too, which I was going to do already.”
“And a team that has your back,” Steve concluded.
“I do, but usually only when they specifically request my assistance with something or have a question only I can answer,” Friday replied. “Captain Rogers does speak to me more frequently than most of the other Avengers, second only to Sir himself.”
Ms. Rhodes didn't mind Tony's loitering, and outright offered Tony a pallet in the house to sleep on for Rhodey's stay. Tony demurred, but quickly caved when she reminded him that Rhodey did not have long for his visit. Rhodey had already received a rank for his distinguished service, and though he downplayed the honor, Ms. Rhodes and Tony knew how rarely peasants were promoted. (Mr. Rhodes had been a conscript as well.) When he returned to the battlefield, Tony invited Ms. Rhodes to start coming to tea, and she and Jarvis got along swimmingly.
“Maybe I don’t want to see him!”
“No, merely the caretaker of it. I am Edwin Jarvis. I manage this estate for the Stark family.”
The lights in the gym went back on and Tony took of his sunglasses to meet Scott’s eyes. “I always knew you’d be an asset.”
“I think I’m offended,” Steve pretended to whine, but he could never really hide his mirth. But he abruptly stopped when Tony finally unearthed a round shield from his bags. It was right blue and red with a white star, and Steve felt an absurd pang of affection that Tony remembered his favorite colors.
Steve looked to the side, abashed. “I couldn’t imagine you sharing my feelings. You’re so radiant, and I was just happy to have a bit of your attention.”
Jarvis found Tony as soon as he made it to the farm, and only left several hours later, returning with food, before leaving Tony in peace for the night. While Tony grieved, Jarvis had all the farm hands report to him to help him understand the farm’s affairs. The man quickly grasped the situation, handling the many tasks of running a ranch with admirable composure. Between keeping the farm going and tending to his desolate grandson, the staff didn’t have much of a chance to get to know him. Steve tried to talk to him despite this.
Tony grumbled as he hid behind his phone, but as a consequence of having a futuristic hologram contraption, Scott could see his small, but genuine, smile and knew there was no actual offense. He was then promptly mortified when his stomach growled so loudly the team broke into laughter and started taking their places around the table to start serving food.
“Yes, Scott?” The computerized but still distinctly Irish AI chimed in from somewhere, and Scott frowned a bit, displeased by how well hidden the cameras must be. He resolved to either convince Friday to tell him where everything was hidden later, or to find it all himself.  “Have you been able to talk to me the whole time?”
I like the idea that the cat burglar and resident hacker has to be super observant and aware of his surroundings, and only grew more observant after watching his back in prison. Doesn’t mean he’s good at stopping himself from talking and ruining a moment, or good at seeming suave, but Scott is certainly able to read a person, despite how he can’t read the mood when it comes to interjecting. He’s going to have to get better at interfering. People may comment he seems OOC because he is too skilled at reading between the lines, but I stand by this portrayal, if only for the sake of efficiency of story.
Steve made sure to thank Tony, confident that he knew where the idea for the gift had come from. Tony didn’t want the gratitude either, and would later steal pieces of the metal his Dad did not understand to experiment with it himself.
America had been caught in skirmishes with Prussia for decades, and while there had not been an active war between the two nations for many years, Rhodey told Tony of the battles at sea or on the borders. America had a mostly genial peace with both Attilan and Genosha, had little of a relationship at all with Wakanda, had a rocky series of ceasefires with Prussia, and a building tension with Asgard over their clashing foreign interests. (Rhodey had told Tony that much of their training seemed to be preparing them for a prolonged fight with the naval powerhouse.)
“But you do know him.”
"I don’t know honey, I’d have to do a lot of risky things, and go a lot of dangerous places,” Scott tried not to downplay the risks to being an Avenger, and Cassie knew better than most what’s it’s like to almost lose a parent. (He may never forgive himself for disappearing right in front of her that day, but Cassie didn’t hold it against him. He came back, after all.)
Steve smiled. “I think the sky suits you.”
“As I keep trying to tell you, Jarvis needs us at the house because a Count and Countess just showed up and want to meet you!”
“Hey, sorry to interrupt, but can I talk to you for a second, Maggie?” Scott apologetically asked.
Tony continued to gape.
“Don’t ignore the more important parts of that equation, Sam.”
“May I invite you inside to tell us what brings you to our humble farm?” Margaret pretended to investigate the surrounding to hide her smile at Jarvis’s pointed tone and Steve’s obviously cowed retreat. Tiberius merely felt his smile go falser when he considered going inside the humble abode.
“I don’t know if my thought process was that noble. It just felt wrong, and no one else seemed to care when I pointed it out.” (Scott struggled to explain his motivations to Maggie after it all went down. How could he jeopardize his family? After a few months in prison, Scott eventually decided that it was the thought of his parents opening an envelope to find out all their savings had disappeared that motivated him. That and rage when he realized his bosses expected him never to blow the whistle on them.)
Their first meeting, he had been welcoming to the youth, a young, ten-year old boy excited for a new friend. (Tony didn’t have many friends growing up, and even fewer in his teens. He was too smart, too witty, too outspoken, too sensitive, too quick, too impatient, and later, too pretty for the average child to be able to handle. This led to him to turn to his inventions and the aptly named donkey, Dummy, for companionship.)
“You’re already still fending off the government.”
(See the end of the chapter for
In the next few days, Tony tried to reach out, offering his awkward apologies, but Steve wasn’t really ready to hear him. The older boy took Steve’s continued silence and reluctance to interact with him as a slight, and concluded that he was just another person who wouldn’t want to acknowledge his presence. (That was the age when Tony was first growing acquainted with the jealousy and resentment of others. His father was the first and most grievous offender when it came to this, making a game out of seeing how little he could interact with his son, especially when he came to work with his father in the workshop.)
Now, at this same festival, Tony was presenting an elaborate fountain that would hopefully become part of a plumbing system for fresh water, and caught the eye of the noblewoman’s husband. The nobleman inquired after the inventor’s identity later, and the mayor happily told him all about the young engineer with the bright eyes and captivating aura. The nobleman quickly put together that this was the same inventor he had heard of from a friend of his, who had been bragging about an order they placed for an automated plow.
“Howard, don’t be ridiculous.” Maria would try to stop the fights, despite her low record of success. Tony privately thought she chose to live in the countryside in order to force Howard to commute away from her and Tony for his work. She didn’t smile much in general when he wasn’t around, but she certainly never smiled at all when he was. After her death, all agreed she had been weary beyond her relative youth for too long a time.
“Okay, Natasha is also very good at researching people.” Steve corrected.
“But Ellis didn’t choose your suggestion for the role,” Steve cut in.
cheerfully stated. The man completely ignored his fumbling as he went to set the table back to rights, for which Scott would be eternally grateful.
Poor Scott didn't even enjoy P.E. in high school, but here he is, in glorified gym class. He's honestly not sure if this experience has left him feeling more like a nerd sitting with the cool kids during 5th period lunch, or like he's being tutored by kids in detention to prepare for all his final exams again.
This time Friday explained. “Mr. Stark had an emergency work call and left last night, shortly after the party has broken up. He asked me to pass on his apologies and congratulations once more.”
Rewatched it today, am still wrecked, so. I need Scott’s help, so he can help them.
Peggy had reached out to Steve before they left, admitting that she had heard of his actions defending veterans, and they had a lovely talk while Tony was still reluctantly displaying his creations. (Jarvis had to admire Tony’s instincts, even if informed by envy, as he was almost never unenthused when showing what he was really proud of.) The two started sending letters, and she was always with Tiberius whenever he came with some absurd idea or request.
When he returned, his eyes were dry, but bared a sorrow, so great, no words could capture it and no words could soothe it. Grief weighed down his steps, and he looked old beyond his years.
“You obviously won’t, though,” Sam tried one more time, but Steve was already walking away from the discussion and down the jet’s ramp.
“You really think I should tell him?”
“I’ve just never been asked such a thing before, so I was unprepared,” The AI admitted, with that same note of surprise she had when he first asked.
“Damn, it’s a shame the Pym particle can only work on my whole body and not just my arm or something. I mean, I get why that is, but still. It’d be really cool. Shrinking your arm isn’t much help if you can no longer reach anything. ”
“I was just made C.E.O. of an international corporation being investigated by the U.S. government for illegal testing, terrorist activity, destruction of property, tax evasion, trading with government banned groups… Our domestic assets are largely frozen, our stocks have plummeted, our main HQ was destroyed, and the main project Cross had been funnelling most of our funding into was the exact project we destroyed. We’re not exactly in the most stable place, as a company.”
But even with their enemies out cold, there was still work to be done.
“She can demonstrate tomorrow. You’ll have a training session dedicated to demonstrating your powers and helping you grow accustomed to our team,” Steve lightly explained.
“She said the Avengers would help take care of me,” Scott said, before chuckling. “I think I’ll need to get a photo with all of you.”
“And tomorrow, we party,” Sam finished.
Steve obviously approved of the response and meandered away with a content expression. Sam leaned on the wall next to Scott and watched his face as he slowly processed the past little while. When it was clear it’d take him a moment, Sam turned his attention to the sad looking piles of metals and tech scattered across the floor. He had decided that the strange square microchip by his foot was once a part of the security system when the ex-con finally found his words again. “Oh god, I was so awkward.”
"Yeah yeah, I know, life isn't fair and you don't want to get caught, but you've been plucking up, -ha, plucking- all of the chickens and I'll get blamed for losing them. Even though-"
“Yeah. Three of the terrors. One of them is less than a year old, but already a hand-full. My daughter is my eldest, and we had her while I still worked with Natasha at SHIELD.” Clint didn’t seem bothered by the question.
“It’s really a bastardization of the game. We sometimes play actual versions of the game, but in this one we’re just in two teams and can clearly see the other team’s flag from across the room,” Sam explained sardonically.
want you here.” Even Scott could hear the desperate sincerity in his voice.
Steve kept his hold. “I know, I swear I do. I just- I know I need to act like I know that more often. We-” There was a gusty exhale before Steve continued. “
“The farm will survive without you, Steve. We won’t keep you here if you want to leave.”
Steve frowned. “We have to talk about it eventually. I know it’s been rough between us-”
“Several men are locals to the area and don’t have terrorist ties, though they have extensive criminal backgrounds and warrants for their arrest. Local police is on the way to pick them up. Most of the others have at least preliminary entries in our known Hydra member database,” Friday agreed.
While Scott survived his first full day around the Avengers, he is beginning to wonder if breakfast foods are cursed for him, since he can't seem to get through a single breakfast without something shocking happening. On a lighter note, Lagos seems like an interesting place! It's a shame the team will be too busy breaking bones to really enjoy the local culture.
Steve was not some stone faced, humorless stiff himself, and actually had a dry wit that only those who had suffered and persevered despite that, could develop. The two were both farm hands on the Stark property, and while both were hard workers Howard and Maria were fond of, Bucky didn’t inspire the same devotion Steve did in Howard. They also interacted with Tony quite differently.
Steve just gave him a look, and Sam correctly interpreted as a request for more context. “He hacked and stole VistaCorp accounts in order to return the funds to the rightful owners.”
Scott laughed, before finally finding his first question.
“You only just realized your love, but I have loved you for years, with a passion and compulsiveness I have never managed to control. I embraced the madness, as you called it, long ago. I’ve known. I am here for you, I have tied my future to you, not the farm. I can’t go an hour without missing your voice, without wanting to check how you are. Nothing hurts me more than when you’re in pain. If your love was a cup of water, mine would be the ocean, farther than the eye can see.”
The creatures managed to throw Steve off momentarily, while a now distracted Sam was knocked over by Wanda. Scott was relying on Vision not being able to see exactly where his shrunken self was as he grabbed an ant to fly him up to the other team’s flag. He reached the flag, dragging it up with difficulty. Vision sharply refocused on him, a beam of light coming at him. Steve snapped back to his normal size since his steed couldn’t handle the extra weight of the flag, and he dodged out of the way before starting to sprint towards base. Wanda has started flinging the bullet ants at Sam and Steve, and even the super soldier was doing his damnedest to avoid those after he felt one of them bite. Natasha managed to nail Vision with an electric shock of some kind right when he almost snagged Scott, and Scott narrowly managed to throw the flag to the ex-spy. She passed it on to Wanda in order to face Steve on headfirst, and the youngest member of the group almost made it to the base when Sam dropped out of the sky and snagged the flag. Scott had shrunk as soon as he had passed off the flag, and once again rode one of the flying ants up, leaping up onto Sam’s wings. This time though, instead of breaking the wings like in their last duel, Scot simply increased in size, drastically changing the weight distribution of the wings and startling Sam enough to knock the flag down onto the Red Team’s base.
“Short for Sparkles.”
“Not in so many words, but I asked him to come,” Steve clarifies, shouldering his duffle bag. “Because you need help from someone who isn’t me or Jarvis, someone who isn’t used to letting you have your way.”
The ‘or worse’ usually involved the fae, mercurial spirits who become easily angered over nonsensical slights and would exact their revenge on all who offended them.
Steve gently transfers her, being careful to ensure Tony supports her head in the crook of his arm. Her uncoordinated hands rub at her face, but she settles soon enough.
His master is being intractable, completely unreasonable.
“And the force-sensitivity of a gnat. You can’t even feel it, can you? Why they picked him?”
The man stands. “You were famously engaged to fellow Ultimate, Natasha Romanova, six months ago before her untimely death. Your proposal at the time was unusually public in that you hired her entire home village to stand in formation while you two flew overhead, and now, there were no public dates, no grand gestures, no fanfare, only a private courthouse wedding done in secret… to be blunt, was your relationship with the late Ms. Romanova a cover for your…” –he coughs– “husband?”
“Until then… I’ll be seeing you, Stevie, and may the Force be with you.”
Real life is not a romantic comedy where Steve is his best gal and they don’t say anything to each other for years out of a mutual desire not to ruin what they have. For one thing: Steve is a boy and straight, so it’s not like there’s any sexual tension there, and secondly, Tony hates rom coms. They’re just so contrived, so unrealistic, and everything would be resolved in five minutes if the two parties could just be honest and talk to each other about what is really on their mind.
“Riiight.” He nods, rubs his chin in thought. “And Gabe’s what? Your age? Couldn’t even drive yet when you left, right?”
“Uh huh,” Steve responds, his tone flat. “I’m right; aren’t I? It’s a sex toy.”
“Bucky’s letting me crash on his couch for as long as I need until I figure it out.”
Tony slaps his hands away, leans in to get up in his face. “You were hot for this before,” he slurs, pawing at his own chest and wondering why he’s still wearing a shirt at all. He tries to fix that, but Steve keeps putting his clothing to rights, and Tony is too uncoordinated to stop him. “What’sa matter, honey?”
He hears cursing from the cockpit, then a shout: “You okay back there, Steve?”
Stark’s shoulders tremble under the exertion as he starts to stutter.
The myth of Ganymede and Zeus is the basis of Greek pederasty (the relationship between a boy and an older man), specifically Cretan pederasty. Ganymede was a beautiful mortal youth who Zeus abducted to be his cupbearer on Olympus. There is a bit of a role reversal here with Steve and Tony. Steve is younger and lower-status compared to Tony, yet Tony is the receptive partner, which would normally be scandalous should anyone come to know of it.
Steve smiles now, small but genuine. “Maybe sometime–”
He glances at his companions. Pepper is holding up well, but Steve seems to be suffering in the dry heat, though Tony had supplied them both with wide-brim hats and hand fans to stay cool and out of the direct sun. Perhaps Rhodey had been right about Steve, though Tony is loath to admit it. With his weak constitution and lack of academic or experiential knowledge of what they are about to undertake, perhaps Tony should invite Pepper along instead, leaving Steve behind to mind the workers.
“Why not? It gets him into trouble all the time, because the bad guys always cheat, but he can’t, and then he beats them all anyway.”
“There best be a next time,” Rhodey grumbles, adding the coin to his pouch.
He accepts the concoction, taking a slurp with a satisfied sigh. “You’re a God-send, winghead.”
“Bright suns, gentleman,” he hears Stark greet what has to be stormtroopers now aboard. “You’ve certainly beefed up security since last I was here. Before, I just had to fill out a declaration form for any flora or fauna I had acquired on my travels, and then I would be off… after paying a small fee, of course.” There’s a subtle clink of coin. A bribe.
“Antony?”
“Haven’t you heard?” Antony asks him when Rabirius had kindly introduced himself. “I’m persona non grata in these parts.”
“You will both report to me tomorrow morning at 0500 hours for extra meditation and forms. Do not be late.”
It is everything Stark had ever dreamed of, everything he had been working towards for years.
Is that what happened? Would she…
“Not exactly.” Tony pulls back the cuff of his jacket to activate the device on his wrist. Immediately, thin, nearly-liquid feelers made of nanoparticles extend from the cuff, crawling over his hands to the tips of his fingers as well as up his arm over the black undersuit he’s wearing under his clothes to reach from feet to neck and over his ears. A blue holographic interface encompasses his head and wrists, engulfing him in a virtual world of interconnected dots, a soft blue spiderweb.
“On it,” she confirms, before turning to their hired hands and directing them in Arabic to break out the pick-axes and get to work.
,” Hadrianus points out, before his voice goes deathly quiet, almost conspiratorial. “The gladiator will not be a problem for much longer anyhow.”
“It was not, and-”
“Only because you’re making him.”
It isn’t the last Tony sees of Steve’s friends. After the first time, he tags along quite often, not wanting to be left behind in the mansion with only the adults for company. Their mothers encourage the friendship, and Steve’s friends (including Bucky) eventually warm to Tony, and though they rib on him for his wealth, Tony quickly learns he’s not the only one with a sore spot they like to prod.
The combatants quickly lose their trident and sword, both fighting over the retiarius’s dagger, which the secutor avoids and uses as a momentary distraction to flip over the retiarius, turning the bout into a wrestling match.
Mentagra: Skin disease that affects the chin (acne or boils) thought to be spread by kissing.
“You will not best me through base distraction.”
Master Phillips mulls it over. “Okay fine. Satisfy your curiosity and move on.” Master Erskine will see that the boy is mentally unfit to be a Jedi Initiate despite his obvious aptitude, and that will be the end of it.
“You work too hard,” Aternius tells him.
“Pass.”
…Which Antony then promptly spilled on a server in his revelry, staining the man’s tunic. “I must apologize. I will replace your tunic, my good man.” He pulls out his purse, squinting at the contents. “How much could one tunic cost? Thirty sestertii?”
That must be the wrong thing to say because Antony frowns. He purchases a vial of rosewater for the house, but cuts their trip short, returning home shortly after.
“I don’t know how we’re getting out of this one,” he admits to Steve, even as he employs evasive maneuvers, trying to conserve his last operational gunner.
“You’re welcome.” Steve collects himself and stands, offering the man a hand up. “Now maybe you could wash up a little. I don’t know what else will be attracted to the scent of blood.”
Ten years after leaving the Jedi Academy, Padawan Steve Rogers finds himself separated from his master and cornered by Storm Troopers, only to be rescued by an unlikely ally.
Stefanus’s heart swells, and Antony looks so happy that he is well-pleased with the shield that Stefanus leans in and kisses him, a brief press of lips against Antony’s own.
Well now, that’s an idea.
“Looks like it’s you and me,” Steve says, a thin hand clasping Tony’s shoulder, releasing with a pat. “Fair warning: I kick in my sleep.”
Antony’s reply is bitter. “Does Bacchus own your heart?”
“I wouldn’t call it dating,” Steve clarifies. “We’re part of the same scene, and we used to hook up from time to time, but nothing that serious.”
“I love you,” Steve grinds out again, nearly choking on the words from fury or heartache, Tony cannot be sure. “And I don’t care that you don’t love me back, okay? I don’t care that it’s not me. None of that matters right now. I love you, and I don’t want you to die.”
with you?”
He folds the pillow over his head, trying to block out the noise and get back to sleep, but there’s another crash then –
Tony had asked him this one favor: for them to not kill each other for fifteen minutes. Steve had been trained to withstand literal torture. He can do this.
The Jedi Academy is not so different from the Brookland Home for Boys or so Steve comes to believe. Sure, the rooms are nicer, the food and clothing leagues better than where he had come from, but there is something of a pecking order amongst the younglings within extant clans, and being a new Initiate (and a physically unassuming and undertrained one at that), he lands somewhere near the bottom upon arrival.
Instead, Steve leans down, smoothing the hair back and pressing a kiss to his forehead. “Everyone is stupid compared to you, doll.” Tony rolls over, grumbling about unfair advantages, but Steve can feel him grinning against his thigh and smiles to himself, grabbing his book with one hand and threading the other through Tony’s hair.
“Tony, deep breaths for me okay? You’re home, you’re safe.” Raspy with sleep and warm, Steve’s voice smooths over Tony’s frantic mind. Settling his breathing and slowing his heart. A hand gently pries his off of the reactor, bringing it to a warm, solid chest.
“Don’t apologize, this-“ he gestures to the half drenched blankets. “Not your fault.” Tony shrugs, and he’s always been good at that, making big deals seem like nothing. Steve leans into his touch, he’s not frozen. He’s not dying. He’s not alone.
He yelps and startles away. “I fucking hate when you call me that! You know that. Maybe your other sluts like it, but I don’t.” She hisses through gritted teeth and Steve stumbles away from her words.
With Tony, it’s as easy as breathing. They don’t struggle to communicate, not like this. It’s intuitive, and Steve knows that it wouldn’t matter where they were, or what happened, this would always be easy.
“I know. God Honey, I know.” Barely audible, Steve doesn’t let him know he heard. It’s too personal, too vulnerable, to open ended to be safe. This, the hugging quickly evolving into cuddling, is already too much.
“I gotcha, it wasn’t real Tony.” He feels more than hears the words. But it does the trick to slow his galloping heart and help him get in a real breath, his senses coming back slowly. Acting on instinct, Tony reaches out, locking his arms around Steve’s neck and burying his face deep in the crook of his neck.
Steve licks his lips, considering reaching out to stop the genius and, with a burst of confidence, rushes out: “What if I don’t want you to?”
“Okay then. I’ll see you tonight pal, it’s your turn to pick a movie.” Tony claps his shoulder, his hand feels warmer than Sharon’s.
When it comes time to pay, Tony heads to the counter and Peter, like a puppy, follows him. As the girl behind the counter prints the receipt, Peter says: “Y’know Mr. Stark, if you and a same sex friend are eating out and request one check and the waiter sets it in front of you, they’ve decided you’re the top.”
Steve watches, once again, as the short brunette walks to the doors like he owns the place. “You asked for this-“ He gestures at himself cockily “quite explicitly if I remember correctly.” Steve is again, left to shoot guilty looks at the staff and chase Tony outside.
He rubs hard at his face, “I don’t know what’s wrong with me.” The confession hurts, ripping out of his chest into the open air. Cold weight of vulnerability disappears before it can fully settle in, chased away by Tony’s hard hug.
“You almost did.” Bruising that dark, that fast? The swelling? It’s a miracle the delicate bones in his genius’s wrists didn’t break. “I promised I wouldn’t hurt you.”
“You pushed too hard Rogers.” Natasha curls up on the couch beside him, neatly folding her legs over his lap. Instinctively, Steve reaches to hold her there, even as his skin burns. He doesn’t open his eyes, keeping his arm draped over his face.
“Yeah, I know.”
A little wine stain on the pocket of her shirt hits like a punch to the chest, Steve drinks whiskey usually, and Sharon doesn’t like red wine.
“I’m not going with you.” His voice is shattered, and he clears his throat. “We’re done.” Two words cut through the tension in the room and Sharon reels back.
“You can say that again.” Tony raises his glass in salute before swallowing the rest.
“You got shot. Right in front of me. Couldn’t stop it, couldn’t save you.”
Once settled, Steve lays back fully, Tony’s weight on his chest grounding him, keeping him in the present and out of the ice. It’s easier to fall asleep now, with arms wrapped around him, legs entangled in his own and a damp head on his chest. Steve trails his fingers up and down Tony’s bare back, smiling to himself when his already sleeping genius hums and nuzzles closer.
He pulls against the hands, they can’t take him from Steve, not even now. “Tony, Tony come on.” The voice doesn’t fit, barely breaking through the wailing, it’s coming from him, Tony realizes, loud, guttural sobs. “Tony! Come on, you’re alright.” The body in front of him disappears, leaving only a pool of blood before the world turns black.
Sam must see something in his face because he steps back with a broken sigh. “I’m kinda glad I don’t. I wish you didn’t either.”
Steve jerks upright, ripping the hands off his shoulders and twisting away to pin them. Ragged breath punching out of his lungs.
Shockingly, Tony comes to their bedroom that night, well, that morning. Steve’s still awake, tossing and turning, he’s so used to having someone so keep warm. His genius cuddles, even if he denies it to anyone who asks, he’s like an octopus.
Tony hops up the steps to where the quinjet, or a smaller version, is waiting. “It’s called a power bottom Steve, god you need to use the internet more.” He sounds exasperated but he’s grinning to much, a real smile, not the pap-grin he usually has, to really be upset.
Peter usually swings into the lab with so much energy the entire tower seems to vibrate with it. He usually talks a mile a minute for hours on end about everything and nothing. Which is why, when Peter slinks into the lab with nothing more than a dull “Hey, Mr. Stark.” Tony immediately knows something needs to be done.
Sharon sniffs, making his head snap up to meet teary eyes. “If I’m not good enough for you just fucking say it!” She spits venom through tears and Steve would recoil if she wasn’t gripping his arm still.
Steve finds himself surrounded by his teammates, all wearing identical solemn expressions. This is not a good sign.
“Just, talking.” Steve sounds distracted, even to himself. Sharon scoffs And reaches around to jerk his face towards her.
“No, Steve, what exactly do you mean?” He doesn’t sound like he’s joking, and he doesn’t sound angry like Sharon always did when Steve got like this. He just sounds level, and a little confused.
“Steve, honey, it’s not as bad as it looks I promise.” Tony abandons his eggs to cup Steve’s face between his hands. Steve pulls his hands down gently to examine his wrists. Both wrists bruised and swollen, nausea breaks a cold sweat across Steve’s back and he reels away.
Steve jerks, crossing his arms and ignoring the way his stomach twists. “You don’t know what you’re talking about Tony. Don’t say that shit about her.” He finds himself towering over the genius, and to his surprise, Tony doesn’t cower away like he’s done so many times before.
He doesn’t want to go outside. Even looking out the window at all of the new makes his knees go weak, threatening to send him to the floor again. “Doll, I really don’t think I can handle it today.” Steve apologizes, swallowing against the shame even as his cheeks flush.
When the person is right, the world shrinks, in that moment, amidst the heat and sweat and soft cries, nothing else matters.
“Yeah.” Peter admits. He stares down, stirring his ice cream into a cold soup. Tony’s not entirely sure whether or not to push for more information, if talking about it will make things better or worse for his kid. Thankfully, Peter saves him the trouble of figuring it out. “Finals are coming up and we got our review pages today. My history teacher is putting things on the exam we haven’t learned at all and I’m just a little stressed about it.”
“Whatever you have to say Stark, spit it out.” Steve snaps and Tony flinches at the harshness. Guilt squeezes his heart, he’s still fucking things up with the other man.
——————————————
“I just, I’m with Sharon. I don’t want you to get the wrong idea about... this.” He gesture between himself and the genius. Something unreadable flashes across Tony’s face, followed instantly by rage, and then the empty media smirk.
“Honey?” Steve turns his head to Tony, who shifts down the couch and holds his arms out. Steve takes the invitation, laying down so his head presses against Tony’s chest and his knees lay across Tony’s legs.
“I’m busy. What do you- What the fuck!?”
Steve startles, skittering away from Bucky before covering it up with a stony facade. “Alright? Buck, what’s up?” He’s genuinely confused, perching slowly on the edge of the couch with a perplexed frown.
Steve jumps to catch his partner before he hits the ground but as his hands touch Tony’s shoulders, Tony jerks away, crashing to the floor and scrambling back, face contorted in pure panic. The coffee mug smashes on the floor, ignored by everyone. It’s silent for a moment before Tony’s face goes blank.
On the other hand, if someone steps in, and says to the frog that it’s boiling? The frog might not believe them. Someone has to step in and take the frog from the water to prove to it that the water was killing it.
He jerks his chin towards the kitchen hotly stating: “You just don’t want them thinking I can, how did you say, ‘dick you down’.” Steve startles and groans, his own inherent stubbornness taking over, telling him to shoot back.
“For once, I don’t think I’m gonna argue with you.” Tony pulls him into a bone crushing hug, cupping the back of his neck. Steve melts into the affection, he hasn’t seen Tony since Sharon moved them into the apartment, her apartment. “Shit, the apartment! My stuff, Tony I-I need to go back-“
The morning sun brings Tony slowly to consciousness, with a headache looming threateningly. Steve runs his hand up and down his back a few times. “I turned off your alarm, figured you could use the rest.” He doesn’t sound sorry.
Steve looks back up to his face, winking. “It’s a nice ass.” He shrugs, can’t be helped. Tony’s lips twitch and he points another accusing finger.
“You just don’t understand.” Steve shakes his head, they wouldn’t get it. It’s so much harder for her than they know.
“FRIDAY. Lights.” The bedroom illuminates slightly, Tony rolls over, the lights making the red rimming his eyes more obvious. He’s been crying, Steve swallows hard against the lump in his throat. “What’ve you gotta be sorry about?”
. “Stark are you clear?” Steve’s voice is loud and clear through the ear piece, distinctly worried. Tony answer with some witty reply he forgets before it’s even out of his mouth, scanning the area again.
Peggy sounds terrified. They don’t have time to get Howard. “There’s not enough time, this things movin’ too fast an’ it’s heading for New York.” Thinning air means he’s gasping for each breath, glass shattering more from air pressure, shards of glass sting his skin worse than icy wind.
Tony sighs and rakes his hand through his hair. “I mean what I said about Sharon.” Oh. Steve tenses automatically, adrenaline kicking in. “Down boy, I’m not here to fight.” Tony catches onto his demeanour change instantly.
“I love you.” Tony whispers, letting Steve pull him in tight, slipping one arm over his stomach and a leg hitching up over Steve’s. They’ll be okay, Steve doesn’t bother trying to hide his fond smile, warmth spreading from his chest as he wraps an arm around Tony’s waist and tugs, pulling him onto his lap.
Steve gets up to open the door for her, which she brushes off. “Of course. I love you.” He leans in to peck her cheek, which she tolerates with a muttered;
—————————————————————————
Steve holds up the shirt still clutched in his hand, he didn’t realize it was there until Tony asked. Tony pries the soiled shirt from his grasp and drops it on the floor into a puddle of water and betrayal. “I should have known.” Steve mutters to himself.
“V’got a sketchbook under a loose floorboard in the bedroom.” At least, he thinks he put it back. In his rush to get out, the entirety of the night is a blur.
The wall digs into his spine painfully, but he presses harder into it when Tony steps forward. “I-Fuck,
“Steve?” Tony knocks on the door, even with no one watching, Steve is ashamed of how badly he startles. “I figured you’d need clothes so I stole some of Rhodey’s things.”
He drops his head. “I dunno what’s wrong with me.” He admits quietly, glancing up with vulnerable, sheening eyes. Bucky lets himself settle into the couch, holding an arm out for Steve to curl under like when they were kids.
“Captain Rogers, Agent Carter is demanding entrance.” FRIDAY calls quietly into his silent space. Steve huffs a sound too close to a whimper for comfort, wedging himself deeper between the couch and the wall. “Would you like me to tell her now is not a good time?”
“Hiding behind old metaphors aren’t going to help you.” She recites to him, she repeats herself a lot these days. “Come on, I’m hungry and you clearly need to go outside.”
“You ass, you know that serum takes care of your ‘figure’ for you. So what’s stressing you?”
Steve smiles bitterly, mouth tasting sour. “Well, good news then, you can’t.” His voice is brittle enough to crack and when Tony looks up again Steve knows he sees the way his hands tremble and how he swallows convulsively, barely keeping it together.
“I can do that, do you want me to send someone we know or one of my guys?” He offers quietly, Steve stays quiet for a minute, keeping his face buried in Tony’s throat, breathing deeply. When Tony squeezes his shoulder gently for a response, he pulls just far enough away to keep his words from being muffled.
Steve didn’t see Tony for most of the day, finding himself alone in a crowded tower. Distracted, unfocused. Sam got the drop on him in training, ribbed him for not paying attention. Steve didn’t shoot anything back, he just left. Rooms blurred together, faces indistinct. Tony still missing. What could have scared him out of their bedroom? Usually after a nightmare Tony clings to comfort.
—————-
“No! No, it’s fine Cap, don’t apologize for waking me up, I don’t mind.” Something inexplicably soft in his voice turns Steve’s knees to gel and sends tears burning in the corner of his eyes.
“Tonight’s on me Tones, you’ve done, so much.” His voice goes soft at the end, looking around at the yellow lamps illuminating cobblestone roads in awe. Tony huffs, crossing his arms and narrowing his eyes.
Tony stills, blinking down at their entwined hands, he doesn’t respond, just looking between their hands and Steve’s face. “I’m sorry I hurt you so bad you get nightmares, that kills me, but you have nothing to apologize for okay?” Tony nods slowly, scooting almost imperceptibly closer. Steve lets him make his way slowly, painfully slowly, across the bed until Tony’s nearly pressed against his side.
“Honey, if I have to tell you what made that different, we’ve been doing this wrong.” Steve huffs lowly, shaking his head.
“I know that look. You’re not even hearing me. When you want out, and you will want out, let me know.” And he rushes away, almost running towards the elevator and leaving Steve in an empty, cold hallway.
Without pulling back, Steve murmurs back: “you don’t even know how happy I am to see you.” And holds tighter. Bucky stills, squeezing tight before pulling back.
He follows after her, a dog with its tail tucked. Makes sure he follows close, smiling when he should, socializing where he should, never stepping away from Sharon. By the end of the night everything hurts, he feels like a puppet with tangled strings. But she gives him an appraising look and says “that wasn’t so hard, now was it?” And the relief nearly knocks his legs out from under him, his brain fuzzes out, she’s happy. This is a good sign.
“Thanks Tasha,” Steve cradles it close to his chest as he leans into Tony’s side again. Natasha crouches down in front of him, giving an encouraging smile and putting her hand on his knee, careful to keep her nails away from his skin.
—————————
“Yeah Steve, you do.” His voice is hardly louder than a whisper. “I don’t want to hurt you more than you already are.” He admits, looking down at his feet.
“Do you want to go back to bed?” Tony asks gently, stroking his thumb back and forth across Steve’s collarbone. He doesn’t, not really, he’s terrified if he falls asleep Bucky will be there again, taunting him, blaming him for the fall,
Her eyes hold none of the softness they used to, and that shouldn’t hurt as much as it does. “All he does is talk. Pay attention to what’s important.” Steve just nods and dutifully follows her back into the living room, Tony’s words swirling around in his mind.
Quietly, although afraid of startling him, she speaks. “Of course, what are friends for?” She hovers for a moment, her eyes flicking from Tony, to Steve and back to Tony. They lock eyes for a moment, Tony tilts his head towards Steve and Natasha gives a minuscule nod before pulling her hand back. “I’ll be back tomorrow” she promises, standing and moving towards the door with smooth, lithe strides.
Things have changed since the 40’s, and if it sounds like an obvious statement, that’s because it is. And yet, time after time, it surprises him. Things today are either old or new, they either fit or they don’t. Steve doesn’t find a lot of grey areas. And then there’s Sharon.
Steve isn’t willing to give it up. So he forces his eyes closed and accepts as much affection as he can get, not noticing his breathing slowing, his eyes getting heavy, and eventually, falling asleep under the gently traced patterns on his back, Tony’s warm hand trailing through his hair and toying with the strands. He can deal with Sharon and the past and the pain in the morning.
“Don’t be so dramatic. I’m sure whatever you wanted to do can wait a day.” She rolls her eyes over her shoulder at him, grabbing her jacket and slinging her purse over her shoulder.
Damn. Bucky knows him too well to fool him. Which is usually refreshing, but today? Steve just wants him to take things at face value. “Nothin Buck, come on, tell me all about Japan.”
Tony slams the door shut, whipping around and half jogging the few steps to Steve, grabbing his elbows just in time for Steve’s knees to give out. “Shit!” Tony grunts under his weight and tries to gently maneuver them both to the ground.
Tony slowly puts down the screwdriver he was brandishing as a weapon. “Okay...? Thanks for the heads up?” Steve scowls, running a hand through tangled blonde hair and letting out a frustrated groan.
“Tony, I-“ another hand wave and the music drowns out any apology or accusation Steve could have come up with.
Tony bolts up with a choked sob, sheets sticking to sweat soaked skin. The dark room a drastic contrast from the bright sun and blood covered pavement. He gasps, hand pressed hard to his chest, clutching at the reactor. Hands are still pressing on his shoulders.
God Steve might be 100 years old, but he types like a thirteen year old girl.
A hand attached to a delicate, breakable wrist. A delicate, breakable wrist coloured with purple finger marks and splotches. Steve’s stomach drops, reaching his hand out to take Tony’s wrist gently. “Shit. Tony is that- Did I- Did I do that?” His voice comes out strangled.
The Winter Soldier is undeterred, throwing a punch with his flesh hand instead. Steve scrambles back, cursing and blocking, never attacking. “I’m like this because of you.” The Soldier’s raspy voice accuses. Steve stumbles, hitting the ground hard and rolling to avoid being crushed by a metal fist.
, off of his face.
Natasha yanks her hand back, clutching it to her chest with wide eyes. “Steve, honey, it’s okay, take a breath for me.” Tony steps into his line of vision and Steve huffs out his breath, Tony’s here, he’s safe. As his heart slows, everything slips into place. Sharon’s gone, Natasha’s here with his things, Natasha was touching his hair, he’s safe.
“I’m sorry.” He rasps, it was a nightmare, that’s all. He’s made a mess over a bad dream. Tony reaches up to cup the side of his face, bringing blue eyes up to meet brown.
Steve frowns, “Oh, alright,” wrapping his arms around himself and sighing softly he continues. “I’ll see you when you get back then.” He’d never argue about work. Sharon’s job is the most important thing, she’s close to getting a promotion.
Bucky has been off on his own for awhile, travelling, recovering, reconnecting. He comes back brown as a nut and looking years younger, freshly cut hair and neatly trimmed stubble.
It’s demanding, time consuming and taxing on the employees and their families, so when Sharon stays out late, leaves early or doesn’t come home all together Steve doesn’t question it. He’s been there.
Tony shakes his head, holding a hand out. “Cap it’s fine, it’s a thing now, a common thing.” He doesn’t make eye contact however, and any trace of relaxation vanishes, leaving cold panic. Steve reaches to grab the genius’s hand before he can get out of the bed.
“Tony.” Steve cuts him off gently, moving slowly to take a flailing hand in his own. “You have nothing to apologize for. What I did was wrong. I hurt you sweetheart, and you never have to apologize for how you react to being hurt.”
Tony slides between them. “He’s not going anywhere with you, you lying, manipulative, cheating bitch.” He snarls, half holding his arm out as if that would really stop her. Sharon’s arm twitches and Steve flinches back, but she catches herself, she doesn’t reach out to slap Tony.
“Tough break, buddy,” Bruce commiserates. “We still on for tonight? That science project isn’t going to build itself.”
There’s nothing Steve can say that will make him change his mind, so he only looks down at the growing pile in his arms. “It’s nothing.”
“It’s not over yet,” Stark says, peering down at his radar where multiple dots are converging on their location. “There are tie fighters on our tail. Six of them. Hold on!” He jerks the control stick to the right, causing the craft to pitch and roll as a series of blaster fire passes under them.
“I forbid it.”
“What if my good friend Benjamin Franklin and his four identical brothers were to ask you real nice to let me go this one time?” Tony suggests, pulling out five crisp one-hundred-dollar bills and fanning them out for greatest effect.
“I always get the runts. Look at that one.” He points at Suibne struggling under his weighted armor and blunted training weapon. “He’s making me cry.”
“It’s 8 p.m. in Hong Kong.”
“You’re right. Petty larceny improves the taste.”
Steve turns to look at him, his eyes wild and panic-stricken and a newborn baby swaddled in his ruined shirt tucked in his arms. Tony can’t even process what he is looking at, because what he’s seeing… it should be impossible.
Worse yet, they hadn’t even been drinking this time.
“If I kiss you, will you shut up about it?” Tony offers.
