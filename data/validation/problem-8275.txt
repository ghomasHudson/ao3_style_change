Tony doesn’t remember who initiated what, but their lips are on each other’s at the moment, Steve is whispering something in between kisses and Tony only hums in agreement. He’s been mentally keeping track of the time, knowing they don’t have enough time for sex or anything beyond kissing. If he's honest, he needs more time for this too.
Tony spits a mouth full of blood and breathes heavily. The coppery taste worsens his nausea, but he fights to hold it in. Still, when he spits out another mouthful of blood, he finds it's mixed with some bile. A grimace stays on his face as he makes himself look away from the mess. His brain is running a million miles a minute and he has so many questions, but it all comes out like word vomit, much like his physical reaction.
“Did I wake you?” Steve asked, his voice was softer than Tony had ever heard it.
He was met with what was probably the most arousing sight ever. Even just watching him from the back, he started to get hard. Tony in one of his work shirts rolled up his arms, his hat placed firmly on his head and a slight swing of his hips to indicate he was dancing to a tune of his own.
Tony nodded stiffly and did as he was told. Steve had big, warm hands. They generated more warmth than Tony’s, and the few times he felt them sent electric currents up his spine. He wanted those hands and calloused fingers rubbing over his lower back, tracing his spine, holding his own hand while whispering the filthiest commands into his ear in a public place.
“You should be thinking about how good it felt when I touched you. That sense of relief I saw on your face was beautiful. Not the million ways you can hate yourself, pet.” Steve didn’t even look up from his sheet when he spoke.
“Yes!” Steve responded, it wasn’t even a question but that was all he managed to get out.
Tony did so, pushing himself upright and almost nuzzling into the warm hand that reached out to touch his face. Steve could probably tell, or at least he was imagining the knowing look he’d received from the blond.
Tony nodded stiffly, tears in the corner of his eyes that softened the firm look on Steve’s face. Maybe he'd been lying earlier; maybe this was his favorite part of being around Tony, him being compliant and needy. Whatever it was, it motivated him to keep pushing Tony. Steve’s fingers worked in a ‘come hither’ motion, slow and steady, his free hand rubbing the back of Tony’s thigh gently.
Tony chuckled, stepping in front of him and motioning with his head to follow him to the limo. Cameras flashed and paparazzi spoke but Steve’s focus was on the brunet in front of him. In the car, Tony trailed his hands up Steve’s shoulder, as soon as eye contact was made, their lips were on top of each other’s.
Steve leaned against the frame of the door, fingers curled against his mouth, successfully hiding the smirk on his face. His eyes followed the curve of Tony’s bare leg. It was riddled with a light smattering of hair that progressively became sparse the further up his leg he looked. Steve was dying to see the curve of his hips and the firm muscle that granted him enough strength to lift heavy materials, the dusting of hair that trailed up his pelvic area, to his abdomen and then his chest.  It was a beautiful sight to behold, and Steve had something sharp and dry at the tip of his tongue but the words were stuck there.
Steve looked at Tony briefly, then cast his eyes elsewhere, he could feel his throat getting dry despite his fruity drink. “Yeah,” he said.
“I didn’t ask you what you thought of me, I told you to suck my cock.”
Steve felt uncomfortable in the public eye, having to bite his tongue at times and ignore stupidity. Tony put on a good act, obviously used to being a public figure by now. He charmed the audience and interview personnel just by smiling at them. Over all they were able to keep up petty appearances, and Steve was quite irritated by the end of it. Feeling Tony run a finger down his back as they walked out, though, had him forgetting why he was so pissed off.
Steve took his time getting ready on certain days, especially days where he had public events to attend. He enjoyed being well dressed, but wearing confining suits for hours on end wasn’t something he took pleasure in. So he did things to lighten the less than enjoyable load. After a good run, he took a long, hot shower that would momentarily turn his skin red, and leisurely plucked through his drawer to choose what panties he wanted to put on.
Huffing, Tony finally pulled back and tried to catch his breath, Steve did the same and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
“Initial over the top bondage isn’t exactly my cup of tea,” he said with a wave of his hand. Steve looked up from the piece of bread he’d been fiddling with and furrowed his brows a bit.
Tony furrowed his brows in confusion. “I did it perfectly--”
“You look incredible.”
“Wait up,” he hears called from behind him. Steve turns and waits for Tony to catch up. “Any plans tonight?”
Tony slides off of the desk and sinks down on his knees in front of Steve. To Steve’s surprise, he doesn’t immediately start touching his cock--he looks contemplative, and Steve just watches for a moment, wondering what Tony might be debating. Is he ashamed at how deep he's gotten into this? After a moment passes, Steve grabs a fistful of Tony’s hair, with his free hand he traces a finger  around his partially opened mouth and as it opens wider, he removes his finger and pushes Tony’s head down on his cock. He loosens his grip on Tony's hair and lets him suck. Steve has to admit the man has a talented tongue;  he swirls it around the head of Steve's cock, then licks the underside of it, simultaneously keeping his lips locked around it.
Steve reaches towards the drawer at his desk and plucks out a cigarette and his lighter. He lights it and inhales deeply, then exhales--letting his eyes fall close for a second, reveling in the pleasurable combination. Steve thrusts his hips up to get more, using his free hand to shove Tony's head down further to take his entire length down his throat. Hearing Tony gag sends a chill running up and down Steve's spine, drool runs down his balls and he can feel Tony's throat encase his cock. Steve grunts and inhales once more, fucking Tony's face rougher and listening as he chokes.
Tony could understand that. The man didn’t seem like the type to have frequent flings, but that was just an observation. He didn’t exactly look intense as much as knowing what he wanted.
“Don’t get that way.” He pulled Tony into his lap. Tony didn’t have the energy to pull away and be as upset as he wanted to be. He knew Steve well enough to know that he didn’t mean what he'd said. Steve had trouble saying things the right way when it came to expressing his emotions, and he understood that but...
Tony shrugged, “Why don’t you show me what constitutes as a date, then.”
“I brought Chinese.”
When Tony finally gets into a position on his knees, his body is quivering and tears sting his eyes.
Before Tony could respond, Steve took the glass of scotch from his hand and sat it down on the coffee table that probably cost more than his apartment. Steve got Tony onto his back (it’s not like Tony put up a fight, again that smug look on his face that Steve swore he was going wipe off of his face) and gripped the belt around his waist, unbuckling it with ease.
Beta'd by Morpha! Told you nerds I was gonna update...
Tony would call it an empty threat, but Steve’s made him do a lot of things before. He still doesn’t move, though.
Tony nearly choked on his own spit. “So I can’t choose to eat without having to be in a relationship? I eat lunch!”
“I--...uh.” Were they dating? Steve said they’d get into labels later on, so he didn’t know a specific title to put over whatever they had. Plus, saying something along the lines of ‘Master wants me to be healthy’ wasn’t exactly something normally brought up in a conversation.
The sheets weren’t fully on Steve, so he could only hear the shifting of soft cotton fabric, which turned Tony on greatly, knowing that the same man who’s jacking off next to him right now was the one who'll be giving him orders the next day. The thought alone almost made him come, almost. He’d learned to bring himself close to the edge, then relax and stop himself from coming too quick.
“You’re only quiet when you’re waiting to be fucked.”
Steve’s eyes darted between Tony’s lips and his eyes, he then settled on the night sky. Although distorted and tinted orange from light pollution, it was still a beautiful. “Just not in the mood today, Stark.” It was more of a grumble than a clear sentence.
“Abosofuckinglutely.” Tony replied in short, giving him a short peck on his lips.
“Sta—Tony. I don’t want to get on a boat, and you know I hate French food about as much as I dislike your co-workers. I don’t need art for my apartment, it’s fine the way it is, and I have no clue what Last Summer is.”
if he could but he would damn well try. Gagging only turned him on more. Tony pressed two of his fingers in his mouth, sucking and licking. They were nowhere near Steve’s size, but he needed to be filled somehow.
“This was supposed to be us bonding over life, not a weird alternate universe threesome,” Tony said.
Tony twists his hand on the upstroke and seems to hold a firm grip, his toes curl and legs tense. He bites his lower lip and lets his free hand grip the edge of the desk to hold position. Steve takes out his cock from the confines of his stealth suit and works himself over slowly, watching and thinking about how he wants Tony to take his first load.
Swallowing thickly, Tony replied as evenly as possible. “Yes, sir.”
Tony’s wrist is giving off a dull ache, rubbed raw from rusty metal chipping away layers of skin. Parts of his suit cling onto different parts of his body—the only sense of protection he has left. He’s aware that physically, it won’t provide any sensible form of defense but it’s the psychological concept that at least keeps his head up. His face is twisted and determined, he’s been staring at the same brick wall for hours, trying to formulate a plan, but his mind is blank with residues of shock.
Steve nodded his head. Tony then said something along the lines of ‘miss me’, and Steve responded with a flat ‘of course’ with a hint of playfulness behind it. That alone was enough to make Tony glad to be home. Well, that and the fact that Steve was wearing his Captain America uniform, which always got Tony going. Small talk about Tony’s trip continued. And, a stupid mission about mutant bees that Hawkeye had the misfortune of battling up against, and a few bad puns later, Steve’s hand was back onto his groin and he was stroking slowly, but this time Tony wasn't trying to be subtle about staring.
“I could always go to the bathroom—“
Tony reached out his hand, dragging his finger along the scar on Antonio’s forehead. “How’d you get that.”
Tony feels the come drip down his face and he smiles, licking some that's landed on his lips.
They were kissing after that, Steve couldn’t stop himself from making little noises and gasps every time Tony licked or sucked at his bottom lip. One of Tony’s hands reached towards the front of the babydoll and rubbed the pads of his thumb against Steve’s nipple, the combination of the lace and Tony’s insistent fondling had him keening. Already, Steve felt hot, bucking his hips and craving more. Tony looked down and groaned in satisfaction,
Steve sighed. “I guess you’re off the hook then. You busy tonight?”
“I can’t believe he was serious,” Tony huffed lowly.
The man has nonchalantly offered, one drunk night when Steve wasn’t particularly up for Tony’s showcasing of ladies. He sipped on a drink that did nothing, out of habit of making others feel comfortable. He’d stepped on the balcony for some fresh air, needing a break from the madness inside.
“I want to be good for you. Use me like a come rag. I’ll do anything,”
Tony grunted.
Steve and Tony were on pretty good terms, friends even. Tony possibly had a thing for the blond and while others might call it pining, he categorized it as an insignificant thing. At any rate, the fact that Steve had carried him up had him thinking that there might be a chance it could happen again if he put himself in a ridiculous spot -- but not too ridiculous, he didn’t want to look obvious.
“I do not have an accent,” Steve was mostly lying to himself, and Tony sensed it, rolling his eyes. “And ya coulda just told me. Woulda given ya more props. I know how mucha love role playin’.”  Steve’s hands dragged down the length of Tony’s spine.
It was far too late for this, if he was going to be a responsible adult. Responsible adults didn’t buy million-dollar super-cars and race them along the Pacific coast, though, so Tony figured he was off the hook for feeling bad about it. Yeah, it was late, but it was a Saleen S7 Twin Turbo Le Mans and if you have a car with 1,500 horsepower on your hands that could go 0-60 in 2.9 seconds, you’re meant to go jetting off into the horizon with the pedal to the metal. Besides, he’d been plenty damn responsible already, given that he’d actually attended all the meetings he’d scheduled with various Silicon Valley think tanks and walked away with two very lucrative partnerships. If that didn’t legitimize his trip, nothing would.
Certainly he had strong foundations of it--he and the Avengers had rapidly moving towards that territory; they’d been thrown together after the Chitauri invasion and the fiasco of Loki escaping with the Tesseract, and between attempting to track down Loki, the revelation that Bucky was still alive thanks to that strange double he’d fought, and the revelation that Hydra was going strong and infesting all levels of government,
He’d never known loss could ache worse than any physical affliction. It was bitter in his mouth. It crowded in around his ribs to crush his lungs and rip and tear and stab at his heart like a poisoned blade. It churned the acid in his stomach and the fatigue of making it from one moment to the next cramped his muscles, and he wasn’t sure which was worse--all that, or the physical pain that was ever present, and had somehow grown even worse because all that time in the ice? It had set the serum on edge, made it more sensitive, and he’d had no choice but to soldier on through it all and try to scrape out some sort of semblance of acceptance with his horrific lot in life.
Steve’s voice was dark with promise, and Tony screamed again, entirely at Steve’s mercy with no end in sight. He closed his eyes, praying that Steve would finally relent and touch him, he was so hard, so ready and it wasn’t enough, it wasn’t enough, it--
Steve wanted faster? Tony allowed it, but gentled his grip and so that he didn’t chafe or irritate himself. Steve’s rhythm faltered and he slowed down letting himself indulge in the long slide back and forth? Tony worked in more lube and ran his free hand over Steve’s body, seeking out the myriad spots that sent pleasure jolting through him, always a different sensation, always a new area, a new rhythm, letting him wallow in the sublime chaos.
They walked together in companionable silence until Tony ducked suddenly down a narrow clean swept alleyway, and stopped in front of a rusted metal door with a triumphant, “We’re here!”
Metallic red caps adorn Steve’s horns starting about halfway down, and a second entirely metallic, red set protrudes from the gleaming white helmet that now covers his face, a few inches lower than the first set of horns, and curving downward. Smooth white plating with golden accents covers all of his torso and legs, and, when combined with the blue Kevlar barding and red armor over his hooves, Steve looks like a goat version of Captain America.
“Barrel Proof bourbon, neat, apple cider chaser.”
“On it.” Tony gives Steve another quick pat, then stands up and reaches out a hand to guide Steve toward the backyard.
Tony was enjoying leading Steve on a merry chase, and Steve was enjoying outmaneuvering Tony and slowly wearing him down. What had begun as an infatuation and purely carnal intent had slowly evolved into friendship and mutual respect. Tony was adding up to be the sort of person Steve could easily fall for, and as their dance continued, Steve came to the conclusion that while he still wanted to plow Tony through the nearest surface, he was also pretty damn determined to hold on to him afterwards.
the premium caramel pecan dark roast coffee he’s drinking this morning when Clint and Carol make their way into the kitchen for breakfast. There is an awkward silence that Tony resolutely ignores in favor of savoring his third cup because he’s paid his dues this morning and someone else can fucking coax Steve off from on top of the fridge. Steve’s climbed everything else in sight already,
What it
“You okay, Tony?” Jan, still shrunk down, settles on his shoulder and neatly crosses one leg over the other.
Tony slid his hands up Steve’s bared legs, gripping the hard muscles there in order to anchor himself, and licked an inquisitive stripe from the base of Steve’s cock to the tip, getting a feel for the lay of the land, as it were. Steve tasted salty and bitter, but on the tail end of that was an oddly sweet note, like…apple? Tony leaned back in and slowly took Steve into his mouth, using his tongue to rub along the underside of that weighty hardness and draw him in further. Steve swore softly and leaned forward, pushing his way deeper into Tony’s mouth.
Heaven. This was Heaven, and if anyone tried to drag him out he was going to throw them right out the window.
and he’s heard nothing from Pepper or Rhodey since any of this began. Not even Happy, and Happy gets paranoid if there’s no sort of contact after 12 hours ever since the Reno debacle back in ‘01.
Steve sees the question in his eyes and pats his cheek patronizingly. “You’re always so meticulous, Tony. Searching for just the right lube, eating me out until I’m open enough for your sensibilities, stretching me open like you’re trying to get your fist in me. It’s adorable, but I thought that this time, I’d do us both a favor and prep myself.
this man...Steve’s mouth dropped open, his warm breath fogging up the cool glass of Tony’s windshield where his head rested as he panted for air, unable to entirely catch his breath between thrusts. It was almost overwhelming, the delicious burning ache of Tony’s dick inside him, the sensation threatening to utterly consume him at any moment.
” Tony’s near scream was muffled as his black and pearl gray Christian Lacroix tie--long undone--was yanked unceremoniously out from around his collar and shoved right into his mouth. Steve, in an utterly unfair turn of events, was still managing to remain mostly in control, the only hint of his pleasure the rough thrusting behind him and the thudding beat of his racing heart.
he understood the full breadth of that expression, and it took everything he had not to turn around and just go back home.

Can he
Steve had immediately been subjected to the raw tearing hurt of being entirely out of place as he had his face rubbed more and more into all the people he’d lost (not just Bucky now, but
They were long, dextrous, and--especially important--well manicured. It was never a good thing to have raggedy nails poking around inside your most sensitive parts, and Steve had been on the wrong end of poorly maintained hands before. Tony’s hands were soft and only slightly calloused, and most of that only around the pads of his fingers. Realizing that he didn’t have that particular problem to worry about, Steve found it easier to relax around Tony’s fingers.
and then pursed his lips, blowing cool air over the sensitized area and causing gooseflesh to prickle up. “
good to him, that wicked tongue of his would dart out, wetting his bottom lip and then Tony would gnaw at it, biting his lip as he worked himself up. He wasn’t a bucker, though. Tony’s rolled his hips and
“Tony...um, hi?”
"No, but I have an idea how fast you might be able to get me off." Tony was entirely unrepentant and offered up his best smirk--the one that had landed him in the middle of a frisky pile of cheerleaders the last time he was at a Super Bowl after-party.
Time to rile him up a bit, Tony decided.
Tony grinned, a mischievous twinkle in his warm brown eyes. “...I would’ve fucked you
Tony really is that good, and Steve is a wreck.
“And the other circle?” Tony asks as he moves forward, only to be stopped by Wanda before he can cross into the circle.
“Good evening, Mister Stark.” Steve watched as Milo poured up two fingers of Glenlivet 18, and then turned to appraise him for a moment.
The statement itself is almost playful, and Tony might have a sarcastic quip ready to fling back under better circumstances, but right now? Right now he’s soul-weary and numb and half certain he’s losing his mind, and Steve isn’t exactly careful with the way he’s waving that staggeringly large knife around.
“Jesus,
He can’t have this.
“Seal the deal with a kiss, officer?”
"Great."
Tony's head jerks back comically. He blinks, surprised at the turn of events.
way. It's a short story I know, but walking in on them going at it like rabbits - man's the mic drop right there. Thankfully there is still a God watching over me, because Stark was facing the other way so he hadn't notice. I have never clicked on an elevator button as fast as I did that day. After all these years I still have trouble looking at Stark without recalling the image of his white boy ass in my brain."
As uncomfortable as the topic was to Sam, he was aware that his friend was finally living a somewhat normal life - by dating a world-famous, disgustingly rich and very attractive
well and openly dedicated love songs to Steve more rounds than he did for any other Avenger. But yup, Thor was literally stuck to Tony's hip the entire evening giving Steve no chance to even socialise with the brunette without being interrupted. With Asgardian mead in the mix, the private party may have gotten a little out of control with the Avengers having to individually file a report the next day for inappropriate behaviour and causing multiple property damage.
, Steve would never allow himself to believe it.
So even if he failed, which was a rarity, Tony's mistakes would still be impressive.
Despite their explosive and clashing personality, Steve and Tony’s relationship saw the biggest improvement. Of course, on Steve’s part, it was because he was halfway falling in love with their resident genius and benefactor. Steve dedicated most of his time outside missions observing Tony and learning the inventor’s body language and mood swings.
His heart was quickly pounding its way into his ears. His lungs were expanding and collapsing unsteadily, so much so that he immediately summoned the suit and upped the concentration of oxygen to help him breathe. He couldn't even see straight with sweat trickling over his eyelashes.
Tony remains unmoved. “
He needed to go home.
When it comes to life achievements, Tony Stark has a laundry list of them.
Tony palmed Clint's shoulder to stop him.
“Hi Daddy,” Peter chirps but doesn’t look up.
The tired genius tosses the old flip phone lightly onto the metal desk as he stretches his veined arms to lean against its smooth edges, hanging his head down low. This was the most he had allowed himself to think of the Civil War after Steve's phone call. The panic attack that came right after that had crippled him to the point of blacking out mid-flight in his armour and it made Tony so afraid of his own mind. He kept himself occupied with the new Mark L armour ever since., working continuously nearly to the point of exhaustion for 65 hours straight, only taking short naps in between just to keep himself from obsessing over Steve.
Two soon became three, as Steve hungrily demanded for more. His appetite was insatiable as Steve moaned and moaned and
“Jesus Christ,” Tony mutters under his breath, but without heat.
The staircase soon creaked to the footsteps of the retired billionaire scientist as he descended from the bedroom, carrying baby Peter. Tony held his son close as the infant curled in his embrace, still half asleep. Peter was clearly not interested to start the day, nestling into his father’s chest for warmth. Tony however had other reasons to wake up earlier than usual that day.
by the way, and you don't
Steve chuckles. “By the way, I don’t look at men in general either,” Steve says, referring to their earlier conversation. “Just you Tony. It’s always been just you. I love you, so much.”
"Boss, you're destabilising. BP levels are-"
"But I. Don’t.
Tony in fact, had known that. It was just information he chose not to share with anyone.
"But he wants to see me," he adds.
Tony's confidence saw a shift, reporting a slight dip.
“Rogers,” Steve calls out to the senior man without preamble, before he starts his way back to the house.
"So yes, I do want
Tony sinks into the embrace, holding her firmly as he rubs the small of her back. She sobs into the crook of his neck and breathes a sigh of relief. After a moment, she peels away and wipes her tear-stricken face with one hand before bursting into a small giggle. They were still holding on to each other.
Two months later, the internet exploded with the return of Tony Stark at the helm of Stark Industries and the media sensationalised the frequent sightings of the billionaire with his CEO and old flame Pepper Potts, fuelling rumours that he left the superhero business and went back to the corporate world for her.
He hated whenever he made Pepper cry from something he had done.
Project Rebirth transformed Steve Rogers from a sickly young man into the perfect specimen of human development and condition.
Natasha did not remove her gaze from Steve.
It was just after the final briefing before the mission, Steve had stayed back in the meeting room to go over the mission strategy for the umpteenth time, even though he had given specific orders to each Avenger as to their roles once they breached Sokovian airspace. Of course, like all previous HYDRA base raids, Steve was well aware that even the best strategies required heavy improvisation.
"No hang on - What
They both watch in surprise as Peter yawns and nuzzles his way into his Daddy's arms, falling asleep. They share a look, and began packing their stuff to head home.
you want?"
Despite his continuous accusations, deep down Tony has come to accept that Bucky was stripped off his humanity against his will to do HYDRA's bidding, to commit the decades-long assassinations including the cold blooded murder of his parents. Instead of hatred for Barnes, Tony came back from Siberia carrying with him a deep sense of guilt for going off on the man for actions he had no control over, and then blowing his metal arm apart.
He turns to give Tony some privacy, knowing it was not going to be an easy conversation for them to have. Clint couldn't help but overhear the sound of a flick. And then, with little to no context----

"I'm right where I'm supposed to be," Bucky replies cheekily, showing zero intention of leaving. "You, on the other hand, you seem a little lost, Stark. You're a good 3000 miles away from home, give or take."
Sometimes he wishes he wasn’t obsessed with the person on the other side of the call button. That he could find peace by destroying the phone and never having to look at it ever again.
The back and forth banters.
Eighty-six
If only heartbreak healed the same way.
"Stevie really loves you, you know. You must be something else, Stark," Bucky says.
a mile away and having spent so much time with the billionaire over the course of the months, Peter could always tell when Tony was crumbling apart. When Tony finally looks up from under the hood, he sees Peter now standing upright, no longer in his Spider-Man suit and blinking at the burner phone at the edge of the desk before their eyes meet. Peter swallows nervously like he was caught looking at something he wasn't supposed to.
Laura was surprisingly very calm, warm.
Tony's knees were weakening at the intimacy. "Do you, Steve?"
"Why are you
Now that Steve was fully aware of where this was going, he starts to take deep breaths through his nostrils. Before he could properly settle into panic mode, the situation turns pornographic when Tony starts to unbuckle his belt while his eyes remain transfixed on Steve. The blonde quickly puts his hands over Tony's to stop him.  "Tony! What are you doing?"
Steve's brain went offline.
“Do you want a hug?” Peter suddenly offers.
"Okay, okay shhh, I gotcha. I gotcha Tony," Steve coos. "I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm sorry, you're right."
The downright embarrassing.
Tony actually laughs this time, tilting his head, not turning.
Tony leans against the armrest of the sofa and looks around while Steve neatly hangs his coat behind the door and goes to the kitchen to put the roses away. The apartment wasn't half as bad as Tony imagined when he walked up. The wallpaper wasn't hideous, the furniture old but not useless. The air was musty but then again the windows were shut due to the snow. The kitchen island was spotless.
"You thought I was having a moment.
Bucky stays quiet for a while. "Who's your source?"
Peter rolls his eyes. Tony was never gonna let that go. "I'd really like to meet him someday Mr. Stark. Under different circumstances. If he means that much to you, he's gotta be one heck of a cool guy."
They understand each other.
"That, will be all Mr. Stark. Go bring him home, tiger."
“Ooohhhh,” Tony teases, insinuating. Stephen rolls his eyes at the level of maturity on display. “In all seriousness, I don't believe for a second that Steve actually
But all that is in the past.
And he can’t.
"He was
Tony feels his eye warming up but immediately stops himself.
means now; he's heard the whispers from the SHIELD agents as he walks by the gym corridors after a workout. As much as the lingering looks and the flirty compliments about his Greek god body flatters him, Steve's body has never received a physical compliment.
The abrupt onset of overwhelming emotions means that he was at the brink of having yet another massive his panic attack.
"I would expect this from you Stark, given your pre-marital activities." Tony's mouth drops to protest, but Strange continues. "But the fact that I have to go back in time to fix all the damages this sacred Sanctum has to suffer after every trip you make here, I also have to relive the two of you having sex and it's kind of difficult to ignore the little conversations I'm forced to hear." The wizard tugs the container back towards him and angrily plucks a grape. "So could you
?” Tony halts, and places the chef's knife he was using onto the wooden chopping board and relaxes into the broad chest pressing against his back.
Drawn to each other like magnets, they inch closer and closer until they could kiss again.
Too many questions, too early in the day.
"Steve is kind, honourable, really smart guy. Jesus kid, everybody loves Captain America. You would too."
"I've been wanting to call you - I'm sorry it's taken this long," Steve adds.
"Now I need you, to tell me, what happened."
He was
The serum truly hated him then.
Steve bursts into a hearty laugh and Tony does too. “Oh rubbing it in by giving such a humiliating experience a name, why don't you? Gosh, that was a bad one, wasn’t it.”
"Something on your mind?"
"Clint. Did you even think it through when you agreed to bust Wanda out of the Compound? Did you even stop to think about WHY you were throwing punches at Natasha, your child's
"Just stay out of trouble, Clint."
"Yes?"
“Sorry,” Steve says, passing the phone from one gloved hand to another. He instinctively apologizes whenever he was caught pining away, though conscious of the fact that nobody has ever made a fuss over it.
Tony thinks bitterly as he flips the burner phone shut, sighing heavily through his nostrils.
Bucky's mouth stays open. He glances at Steve and back at Tony. Suddenly the whirring of the gears in his metal arm became more pronounced, likely because everyone had stopped breathing for a second.
. But when Tony bends to plant soft kisses all the way down Steve's chest and traces his tongue over Steve's nipple, he was rewarded with soft moans. The moans were dialled up to 11 when Tony decides to play dirty and sucked hard at the nub whilst reaching down to stroke the Steve's hard erection.
Pepper doesn't answer as she guides him to the bed and they sit across each other, their hands intertwined. She sniffles, calming herself down from the tears. "How are you feeling?" Pepper asks, placing a palm over his neck to check for a temperature, also to wipe off the wetness she had left on him.
He was embarrassed enough that so many people have given him shit for That Kiss. Now Tony too? Unacceptable.
it to me as a gift, I can’t just ask him what
to Steve’s and if it wasn’t for the fact that they were sitting in the dark on the helipad of the Avengers Tower, the blush on the super soldier's face would have given away everything that he’s held inside, particularly the torch he's been holding for Tony.
But he is.
Tony remembers whispering a promise to Steve,
” Tony chants erotically, applying the slightest bit of pressure against Steve's head wedged between his ass cheeks with his tongue jabbing Tony's hole over and over. As his knees weaken, Tony's hardened cock twitches and heavily hangs between his thighs, steadily leaking precome onto their silk sheets. The occasional friction he gets when the tip of his dick touches the surface of the bed, on top the fantastic rim job he was receiving, was driving him crazy.
Someone was now awake and that someone was going to get the fresh milk.
of me?"
"There's a towel over there," a voice breaks into the stillness. Tony goes to the source of it and sees Bucky leaning against the island, reading the ingredient list from a box of cereal that covered his face. "I nearly broke my face tripping over your pants so I've thrown everything into the wash."
Cold, but not unexpected.
Tony rubbed his face roughly and bit a balled fist, trying to remind himself what Clint had just told him; that the two of them need to talk. That right now, Steve was trying. He's made the first move, which Tony never expected at all. Deep down, Tony has accepted that at some point, a conversation must take place sooner or later. Whether it does them fuck all, was secondary.
Breathe!
About what it was really going on between them.
Tony blinked.
They danced around each other, behaved like an old married couple, but nope,
"As a person. What's he like without the uniform, the inspirational videos. The shield."
about?”
"And that's why your kid likes him best."
What was intended to be a moment to reinforce camaraderie somehow ended up with him having incredulous, hot sex with Captain America.
Lost in thought, Tony did not realize his breathing had stifled. He had been closing his eyes as he stood by the curtains, facing the large meadow that surrounded the farmhouse. He counts backwards from 100 in his head, finally calms at 79, and opens his eyes to find bright blue eyes blinking at him in earnest.
“No better person to lick wounds with than someone with shared life experiences,” Tony says jokingly as he pats his chest but regrets it the moment he notices how tortured Steve looked hearing him say that. He pushes himself off the wall and brackets his husband’s waist. “Sorry baby, I didn’t mean it like that,” he whispers in comfort, grazing himself on Steve’s bearded jaw.
--leans into the touch.
Aaaand, this again.
? Also, what the fuck, are these real?” Tony stepped forward, poking at Steve’s bicep. “My soulmate’s a
Tony laughed, closer this time, and Steve’s eyes fluttered open to see Tony standing over him, dangling the controller to his vibrator.
He glanced across the ballroom at Natalie, who had easily insinuated herself into Stane’s circle of sycophants, and was quite busy flirting for all she was worth. Stane seemed more focused on the dark red curls that framed her wide green eyes and the sparkle of her large diamond studs under the chandelier’s light; money and beauty was a powerful combo. So powerful, in fact, that Steve was certain the man had no awareness of the tiny red-haired tsum picking his pocket.
It was pretty cliche. Him, and occasionally two other men, being officers and carrying casual conversation. Tony kept his eyes trained on the blond officer every time he stepped in. He was stuck between begging to be arrested or using a cheesy pickup line. For now, he did neither, but it didn’t mean he stared any less when he got the opportunity.
"That's the only thing you should be used for: choking on cock." Steve hisses.
All had gone well, until Tony knelt down to tie his shoes in preparation for the walk back home. At first Tony thought it was his imagination, the sun rising causing a distortion of shadows, but when Tony looked closer he’d noticed something else had risen too. Tony’s first reaction was to point it out subtly and joke about it, and just as a smile reached his face it fell.
talk. Was it wrong and unwarranted? Maybe. Did he care? Absolutely one hundred percent fucking not.
“Look at me.”
“Good. that’s great. Your piece looks amazing,” Tony said. He wasn't sure what else he was supposed to say. Really, he hadn’t even thought their next encounter through besides them having the most intense sex of his life.
“You done?”
Tony huffed. “Oh don’t act so shocked.”
“No problem. Text me when you’re headed my way, and don’t forget about the first rule I still wanna hear.”
It was one of those morning where Tony was running super late. Of course he’d still made time to get his daily few (dozen) doughnuts and an unnecessarily large cup of coffee, before whisking out the door.
Steve raised a brow. “I appreciate the compliment, truly. And, don’t take this the wrong way but... why are you here? This doesn’t seem like your type of environment. I can’t imagine my art dragged you down to another hipster art gallery.” Steve stepped closer, invading Tony’s personal space like last time, and just for that, Tony was glad he showed up.
Steve took a sip of his water, then spoke. “So you’re new to this lifestyle. What made you decide to try it to begin with?”
“Why?” She sounded more curious than impatient, which was both a blessing and a curse.
A dry heat passed over the land, making it so the cool breeze had to work a lot harder to allow some sort of relief. Steve was used to the western heat. Being a sheriff meant sitting out in the sun for the majority of the time while sitting on a horse—the only protection being his hat, firmly placed on his head.
He shouldn’t answer. It’ll cause some terribly awkward conversation in the morning but- “You, fucking me, Q-Quinjet.” Too straightforward. Steve might get up and walk away right now, knowing Tony was fantasizing about fucking him—he was pretty sure Steve wasn’t straight, but he was also almost certain the soldier wasn’t into him.
Tony clicked his teeth and shivered gently, “It wouldn’t have been a surprise, then.”
Tony wants to roll his eyes at the sarcasm, and for some reason that triggers anger. This guy is so much like the man he already adores that it pisses him off that this man can so much as have the same damn name.
“Different? Not modelish… or not a woman?”
Once the uniform is clean,  he burns out his cigarette Tony keeps their eyes locked for a moment, as if waiting for further direction and domination—or maybe wondering what he’s gotten into. Regardless of what it was, Steve has plans to use him thoroughly, and he’d rather not waste time. “Up,” Steve says, and Tony immediately lifts himself off the ground and stands. He’s shaking, tremors leading up his thigh and through his fingertips.
“Agreeing, you start first.”
He loosened his grip a bit after coming down, laying into the sheets and sitting back. Tony pulled out of Steve, stroking his cock with vigor and moving up. A thrill went through Steve. As much as he loved being filled, the feeling of a load onto his face was a lot more fulfilling.
“Good, you should come by my place--” Steve opens his mouth to protest and Tony interrupts “--not for a party just to hang out. You’re such a recluse.”
“You made several mistakes, but I’ll tell your biggest one," his voice is calm as he speaks. "Coming into this facility and pretending it’s yours. I built this place. I tore it to pieces and rebuilt it in my image, successfully.” He grips tighter, feeling the crunch under his fingertips.
Tony does so, a small grin on his face as if he’d gotten through to Steve, as if he’s used to getting his way. Swiftly, Steve grabs the back of Tony’s head and slams it into the oak desk in front of him.
“Steve, oh god yes darling that feels—“ Steve pressed harder to get Tony to shut the hell up, he didn’t need to be told how it felt, he just needed Tony to moan for him, and moan he did.
He licks again and again. Soon, he’s sucking the head of Steve’s cock, and through half lidded eyes he looks up to see Steve’s staring back—more dominant than cold now.
“Has anyone ever told you you’re persistent?”
“Then take a break, darling.” Tony keeps his voice low, soft and teasing—the type of teasing that has Steve shoving him against any flat surface without hesitation, and fucking him into his place.
Tony backs up in disgust. He feels sick to his stomach again, but before he can say anything, Steve yanks him back and slaps him harshly. Tony’s face stings.
So much for steady.
“Wait, what?”
“Not exactly.” He pauses for a moment to balance his phone between his neck and ear and begins wiping the semen off of his hand. “Do you need anything?”
“Pretty good, I ate breakfast and a burger for lunch, but I did have a salad on the side.” Tony said proudly as if displaying a badge of honor.
Both brunets behind him let out fake gasps.
His strong legs were elongated in the heels, his physique somehow emphasized by the soft and dainty night wear. Steve got a good look at himself before grabbing a robe and making his way to Tony’s living quarters, the sound of his heels hitting marble was making his cock hard. Thankfully, he didn’t run into anyone on the way. When he got there, he gave two gentle knocks on the door, just like Tony did earlier.
Tony’s eyes downcast and he forces out a spiteful “yes sir.”
Steve’s hands combing through his hair is what he needs to calm the tremors. Sure, he doesn’t stop shaking, but it’s still soothing. Tony let’s himself submit to his touch, saying his name gently, almost begging , Steve asks him what he needs and Tony shakes his head to signify 'nothing'.
“No,” Steve answered. “You come when I say so, isn’t that right?”
Tony nodded stiffly, giving breathless “yes, Master,” and hoping his cock would remain flaccid.
“He’s right. From what I hear, Steve’s in love with you.” Anthony chimed, giving Tony a sly grin.
Spending money on tailored suits, aged liquor, and only the most rare and sought after had eventually hit the peak of monotonous. Tony enjoyed spending money on those he cared for, and even with Steve, he never got that chance. It took a lot of convincing for Tony to get Steve to agree to go on vacation, specifically the Hamptons.
Stay tuned for more~
“Good boy. Don’t cry. I haven't used you yet.”
“I’ll take that as a yes.”
. Steve had to know Tony was getting off by now, at least he hoped he did. Whether he was disgusted or not, Tony would be jerking off to this memory for a while. That's when Steve swiftly moved over top of him, one knee pressed against Tony's aching groin and applying pressure. Tony didn't speak. This was territory he never thought they'd reach. He’d been imagining a scenario like this from the day he landed his eyes on Steve's focused gaze. The pressure grew greater as Steve pressed down further, and further, and then it began to fucking hurt.
“Save it, Stark. I’m not keeping you for long. I met another one like you by accident in another universe, pretty thing,” his voice trails off, and Tony closes his eyes to brace for another hit when Steve’s hands go up. Instead, a single calloused finger runs across his forehead. “He had a scar right here, drank like a fish, killing himself daily; broken. I almost felt insignificant; he had self-loathing down to a T. But you... You’re healing.”
“Sit,” he offers, calmly and even-keeled.
“What’s ‘this’?”
He should probably establish a safe word, but he's impatient and can’t see things heading into that territory right now anyways. Steve hums for a second. “We’ll get into ‘kinks’ another time. That’s an entirely different discussion. Right now--” Steve gets up from his seat, he can feel his body thrumming with excitement at the way those crisp blue eyes peer up at him almost innocently.
“Even back home you weren’t this scared,” the man sits up, lifts his leg, and strikes Tony with a hard kick across his face. Hard rubber soles feel like being hit with a damn bat, pain blooms across his skin and he cries out in agony. Most of the agony stemming from the man that looks so much like his closest friend torturing him.
Almost ten years he’s been waiting for this, and as of right now, it feels empty, but Tony keeps going, searching, chasing Steve’s lips in an attempt to find him.  There’s a disconnect, there’s always a disconnect and Tony’s sure it’s him and not Steve, not that it matters now.
Steve’s voice made him want to listen, stern but soft when need be. It was amazing from the few times they’ve interacted how badly he’s come to want Steve. Just one kiss could either tie him over or send him over the edge.
Tony felt wisps of cold air against his skin, shivering at times from the combination of the temperature and the silence. Steve wasn’t ignoring him, but they weren’t talking either, not to mention the word punishment weighed in on him like cinder blocks. He tried to keep himself calm. Steve told him that not all punishments are bad. Even if he made a mistake, Steve wasn’t disappointed, was he?
To him, Steve is bittersweet--like dark chocolate, the bitterness is overpowering at first, but sweetness hints and teases, simply a possibility, which then fades into nothing, leaving a bad aftertaste and a craving to try just a bit more. Tony indulges as much as possible, because he’s good at finding distractions; some might say he's an expert.
Tony says nothing more, but Steve hears the clicking of something so familiar, something hypnotizing and something that makes his cock twitch. When Tony finally reveals himself, Steve’s mouth parts and for a moment all the air leaves his body at once. He’s gaping, he knows he is, and Tony looks so proud and gorgeous. His hair immaculate and slicked into place, a sheer lacy robe that rides high and grazes his upper thigh with matching panties and garters, all sharing the same deep red rich hue that compliments Tony’s skin beautifully, sheer stockings and sleek black heels. Tony’s long and lean body looks like it's made for lingerie, and Steve wants nothing more than to bend him over and grab a handful of his perfectly done hair and fuck him relentlessly. The only question is whether to start with his ass or his face first.
Steve wishes he could take a picture of Tony’s face right now. He resists the urge to chuckle from how purely taken aback he looks. Sputtering a bit, Tony speaks. “Did you hit your head?”
2. Tony decided that resting his head on the kitchen counter after coming back from a long and grooling function would be appropriate. The entire time, he constantly ran the scenario of strong arms holding him up and the feeling of his face pressed against Steve’s chest. At the time, he wasn’t fully aware that he was being carried, but that didn’t stop him from the bouts of imagery invading his mind.
Steve walked over to Tony, just as unhurried as before, and slide his fingers into the hair on the nape of Tony’s neck before gripping firmly, thought it wasn't firm enough to hurt. Tony could feel the leather of Steve’s gloves brush against his skin and rub, making him sigh.
On the extensive long list of problems Tony had so meticulously shoved in the back of his head to solve at a later date, Steve was number one; especially nowadays. Tony's having trouble looking at the situation without making boner puns, which would
Tony groans and lifts his head, revealing blood dripping from his nose down to the top of his lip. Immediately he lifts out his hands, energy beams seem to be forming in his robotic suit from the palms of his hands. Steve grips him by his neck and lifts him off the ground without hesitation.
“Is this the part where we all fuck?” Anthony joked.
“Excuse me?” Tony's voice is beautifully schooled, but still betrays a waver of doubt. Self doubt.
Tony’s voice nearly cracked. “I will,” he said, holding up a hand to gesture ‘goodbye’ awkwardly.
Tony bit his lower lip before nodding, then quickly remembered Steve couldn’t see him. “Yes Master.” His voice was low, he could already feel himself stirring.
And just like that, he pulled away, and the waitress came with their order. Steve was full of smiles and was well mannered, as if he hadn’t just said what he’d said a fraction of a second ago.
“Get the oil,” Tony gasped out, his voice trembled, and it was all Steve needed to hear to do what he was told. Luckily on the nightstand was a vial of oil, and Steve poured a generous amount to his palm after he got his cock out. Walking back over to Tony, he grabbed the base of his cock, then stroked up to the tip, and then back to the base. Steve wasted no time pushing his cock into Tony, reveling in the look on blacksmith’s face.
“Mhmm, company,” Tony repeats again. Steve can hear the rattling of the ice in his glass.
This is when the game begins. The doors shut behind him, and Tony runs a finger over the mahogany desk Steve is sitting at. Steve’s pretending that he’s not there, and Tony doesn’t buy it for one second. Someone has to talk first, and it’s almost always Steve grunting an insult or some form of a challenge to make Tony push. Tony thinks he does it on purpose.
Tony nodded, he hadn’t even noticed his eyes were sealed closed until he pried them open to see where Steve went. His dom came back with something that looked like a chain with two attachments at the end, Tony furrowed his brows in confusion, then it kicked in.
Tony was trembling, he usually did when he was angry, getting on his knees he scooted himself closer. Steve leaned in and wiped the tears threatening to spill from his eyes. “This is good, because I know you want to please me, and I know you can, it just takes time. It’s only our first session.” He kissed Tony’s cheek then the top of his forehead.
“You’re oblivious.” Steve responded in short.
Steve grabbed a firm hold of his erection, clothed in soft cotton, and stroked it a few times, his eyes elsewhere entirely as if he didn’t just fucking do that. Never mind that Steve’s cock was mouthwateringly big, the type of big that makes it a chore to suck, the only type of big Tony would suck. But Steve clearly was not wearing underwear, Tony could see the outline of his cock head and Tony so furiously wondered if Steve was cut or uncut (he was betting on uncut).
Fair question, he didn’t have to join him, and Tony is never exactly making him. “Looking for something different I suppose.” It was meant to be a thought, but the words fell from his lips before his brain caught up to him .
1. Tony’s never exactly had trouble falling asleep in odd places when he’s exhausted, and no one bothered to shrug him awake, leaving him there until the early morning sun blared in his eyes. That is, until one day, he’d nodded off to sleep on the couch, grease streaked over parts of his face, and he will neither confirm nor deny drool escaping the side of his lips.
Steve had the hands of a worker, rough and worn, and strong. His touches, however, were gentle when meant to be. He took his time in some areas, near his hipbones and thighs, the hunger in his eyes evident with every swipe of his fingers.
Steve grits his teeth in frustration. “The only thing I expect to hear from you now are moans,” he says, then presses his fingers up to Tony’s mouth, not letting his approval show when Tony licks eagerly while keeping eye contact. Steve takes the well licked finger and reaches inside Tony’s panties, pressing the finger against Tony’s entrance then breaching slightly, and Tony responds almost immediately. Tony arches up, twisting in the constricting hold of Steve’s hands, still firmly grabbing a fistful of his hair, making his body contort in a certain direction that makes it impossible for him grind back onto Steve’s finger.
Rage and indignation will see him through where resolve falters. This
Steve rubbed soothing circles against Tony’s hip bone, and forced himself to stay still while Tony gathered his control back up. After a long moment, Tony lifted himself up and let himself drop back down, his punched out moan mingling with Steve’s own thready whine as Tony’s thumb brushed against his nipple.
“There’s nothing but victims in this story, Tony. Orthiel has taken the Winter Soldier as host, and Hydra...took a good man, and twisted him against his will into the Soldier. The Winter Soldier has no free will, has just been brainwashed and turned into a pawn a...a

It wasn’t nearly as long as any of the dildos in Tony’s carnal treasure trove, which all tended toward an average of seven or eight inches and ran the gamut from slick and cylindrical, to ribbed and studded, and one particularly menacing one that was crooked as a bag of snakes and nearly a foot long.

the car, their dirty moans and lusty gasps and wonderfully filthy grunts punctuated by the rhythmic squeaking of the car and the gentle rustling of the wind in the leaves of the trees around them.
Tony lets out a pained roar of frustration and funnels his tempest of emotion into the fall of his hammer, letting it all pour funnel in.
And quick on the heels of
“Tony, you--”
Steve stared up at the ceiling incredulously, his chest rising and falling with harsh breaths as his teeth ground angrily at the twisted fabric of his gag.
Tony is up and running for Steve’s circle, skidding to a halt as a figure groans. It’s a very human sounding thing, full of weariness and dazed confusion, and it’s in Steve’s voice.
It had been a
Tony froze. “You lost your virginity in a European whorehouse?”
Steve sighed and rolled his eyes as he adjusted the harness on his uniform. Natasha had been like a dog with a bone the last two weeks, trotting out candidate after candidate for Steve to make time with. Logically, he could see the point--he
What the hell?
Hopefully it would lead to more than that, but that was something to contemplate later, when he wasn’t so
“Found your reset button.”
. It wasn’t that at all, I swear. I was trying to protect you.”
Tony is isolated—is he? He hasn’t heard from Rhodey or Pepper or Happy at all, nor anyone else. That makes no sense—surely he could call them, or email or—or—
Tony’s thoughts immediately go to Rhodey and Pepper, to Happy.
Tony’s safe enough in his armor—even vampires can’t bite through the gold-titanium alloy—and he’s not worried about Thor or Hulk, both of whom are more than capable of holding their own.
had the upper hand.”
Instead, he has to sit here and watch Tony damn near have a stroke over the whole damn thing, has to watch as he blatantly backpedals away from everything they could be, denying it all as he frantically builds an defensive wall between them.
Bucky squints an eye in pain, and sighs out a laugh. “She said no,” he confirms, nodding. "Not for the same reasons Stevie did, though.” Tony’s eyebrows shot up but before he could respond, a young waitress appears between them to hand over their drinks – two milkshakes and an americano. She gushes sheepishly as she bats her eyelids to Bucky, who smiles his painfully handsome smile back at her. She lets out a musical giggle before she leaves them.
"I missed you though," he blurts out, straight into Steve's marble blue eyes. He leaves it at that, unsure of whether he would be overstepping to say more considering that it was he who made the decision for them to take a break from each other.
"Good. Now. How long did JARVIS say Hill was going to take to get there?"
“Come off me, Tony. Let’s get you back inside.” Steve tries to lift him but Tony clenches his legs tightly against Steve’s thighs. The move catches the super soldier off guard, rendering him immobile for two seconds before his brain reboots. “
about it,” Sam suggests for the millionth time also, as he randomly hits the surface of the fancy glassy remote, channel surfing to try tune out the agitated super soldier nervously drumming his fingers on the kitchen counter of his personal quarters.
, I will ki-" He walks into Tony's view and stops talking the second he realises what was going on, "-
For reasons he could not explain, Steve noticed that Tony looked at him differently since they came back. Even though Tony had his signature grin on, his gazes were worried, as though Steve was going to disappear at any moment.
"I'll even play aeroplanes with you. Come on."
. Can we not talk about this?" Steve huffs, embarrassment creeping up his cheeks. He bows his head and twiddles the phone between his dextrous fingers.
Steve did not have to turn around to know his husband was rolling his eyes.
“Oh come on,” Tony whines, throwing his voice and turning away dramatically. But he recovers quickly, dropping his face close,
"I don't know," Steve mutters lazily without much context.
A red fire engine on the broad mahogany dinner table led the chaos in the silent cottage. It was the most modern piece of technology in the otherwise humble abode, mainly because it was completely taken apart - the chassis stripped to its bare bones to fit electromagnetic strips, the plastic tyres were being modified to be retractable and the engine bonnet now housed a mini reactor-like power source.
After a brief moment, Natasha speaks again.
"Fuck," Steve hisses, rutting his dick against Tony's perineum, grazing Tony's balls and their cocks bounce off against each other. "Love making you feel good Tony, calling my name. Love it that you're so loud, that I make you feel that way."
He shrugs unapologetically, surprised to find himself able to joke around a devastating topic. "I had the ring in my pocket, I had a little speech ready and you know what Captain Perfect said? '
He takes a deep long breathe, and presses Call.
This is his life now, and he devoted it to Peter, promising to be everything his adopted son needed in memory of a young man Tony still feels greatly responsible for.
Tony considers for a moment. "I'll make you a new one then."
“Oh for shame,” Tony concedes. “Okay you’re right about that one– Daddy gave you a bad example. I don’t suppose you know who Popeye is?” Peter shakes his head, fluffing his long brown curls. “No?” Tony glances over to Steve, who looks at him equally lost. “You don’t – you don’t know who Popeye is either?”
Today he comes bearing a different sort of gift, one that was months overdue.
A tear or two may have escaped him.
"Take me," he whispers into Tony's ear.
Tony gulps at the thought of Natasha whipping out a knife hidden on her garter belt and tossing it in his direction for delaying her big day. Noticing colour also draining from Steve's face, Tony looks at the Sorceror Supreme.
"Barton as much as I love amusing you, this stupid phone?" Tony flicks out the tiny clamshell from his jeans pocket, to no surprise of Clint, and waves it. "I know the song, I know it goes
"Here I thought there was a lot of grovelling to do," he said, grinning hungrily.
"Rogers, we're having a moment here. I promise you; whatever is discussed here will not leave these four-
Reaching the bottom of the stairs, Tony took sight of his life.
He nods.
Steve was sprawled all over his mid-half, dead asleep.
"I don't know," Tony says flatly.
"I've picked one out, and it was actually your idea."
“Don’t pretend you don’t know why he’s pissy.” Tony says, tugging at the tie and knotting it all over again. Steve presses his lips together into an unapologetic smile as he gazes at his husband’s face, enamoured by how beautiful the man before him was. “Yeah you’re smug now; wait til he sends one of us to another realm for constantly jizzing all over his magical relics.”
"Don't I deserve a fucking win?" he spits angrily.
"He doesn't, Pep. I wish I had spelled it out for him when I had the chance. Maybe all this could have been avoided. Maybe he'd see it from my point of view. Maybe he wouldn't ... Jesus I'm pushing 50 in three years Pep. You take away the ice, the man is in his 30s. I don't know what made me think we could actually work."
, secret.”
A symphony of crickets filled the air.
Gooseflesh creeps behind Steve's neck, up his hairline as he extends his arms to make space for Tony. He carefully lowers his hand to rest them behind Tony's back.
"You're Steve's. So by default that makes you my baggage too."
with this one
"Last I checked I'm still a wanted man, Stark. Not everyone's as forgiving as you are," Bucky says stoically.
Yet, as he kisses his son’s soft brown hair, Tony has accepted that it was beyond him to undo or reverse what he did not understand to begin with. He did everything that he could, he paid a huge price for it, but life had to go on.
"For the record, I'm not here to take you in," Tony explains without prompt.
Steve fights the urge to roll his eyes - it reminded it too much of Tony. But the interrogation
"Stark, you may not believe it but I do have a sense of self-preservation. I'm not just saying this to piss you off - man, I am
Clint’s head jerks backwards. "Did you mean that literally, as in you think Steve's doing this for love?
Steve nods.
“I want you to know I support you, Mr. Stark,” Peter says, refocusing the topic with a serious look on his face.
Tony and Steve froze, literally stopped breathing as their eyes snap open to the cry.
"You're having a dream, Boss. We are approaching the Tower. Would you like me to mainta-"
Without warning, Steve's head warps out of the freight train and into the Avengers Tower, 18 months ago.
It was indeed unfortunate that whilst the super soldier serum transformed Steve Rogers into the pinnacle of human potential, it entirely miscalculated Steve's short emotional range and missed the account of enhancing that capacity.  Far too late for that now, especially since he had to messily fall in love with a man who shared the same demons.
They were both stark naked (ha!) but thankfully their modesties were intact thanks to the spread of sheets covering their lower halves. That didn’t help Tony's brain-fart at all, he was caught frozen in the between lust and panic to even form a coherent thought.
"WHAT?" Steve and Tony says together in unison.
"Pep..per? Hey what, is everything okay?"
“Your little speech earlier was pretty something. Thor’s all worked up, he’s really hoping we’re right about this base.” Tony said, taking a nervous step into the room. He was sheepish tonight, Steve noticed, and it made his heart flutter even more. Tony had also changed into a loose sweater and track bottoms, a sign that he wasn’t heading to the lab or working on anything in the garage.
"I know you and I don't really see eye to eye on things, but Stevie's all I've got, Stark. He's an idiot who thinks he's right all the time. But he's loyal to a fault. He's a good egg, the best kind, but he can also be an obnoxious punk who needs someone to anchor him. If you can be that person for him, I wouldn't have to worry about him too much."
with it. He’s going to think I don’t like it.”
Eighty-five
He quietly hopes whoever's responsible for the aroma will be willing to share.
He grins to himself.
“Right, okay, Wong's, Wong's uh good with Petey right? Peter's in good hands.. Oh fuuuuuck, babe do you want to take this to our room?" Tony asks, glancing over his shoulder to get a clearer reading of the situation. What he sees is Steven Stark-Rogers kneeling behind him, two seconds away from eating his ass.
“Why not? It also says here that it’s a special invite to
If you stare at that phone any longer, you’re going to burn a hole through it,” Sam says, his voice piercing through the silence of the balcony.
Maybe it was the power play.
Bucky grows silent, taking slow sips of his coffee.
"Holy fuck---Fry what just happened?"
Because he’s heard all about that time Tony patiently sat down with Steve going through Amazon and Ebay for hours, teaching him about the wonders of the world wide web and online shopping, and thereafter granting him full access to the billionaire’s Centurion card if Steve ever wanted to get anything for himself. Steve went on and on to Sam about how much he appreciated Tony making time for him despite the businessman's hectic schedule, how sweet it was that Tony would lean on his shoulder as they clicked through the webpages - not that Sam had asked.
Clint sighs.
-" He corrects, receiving a nod from Tony, "- to re-enact the worst kiss known to mankind so
"And it wasn't you who did it. James Buchanan Barnes, as I've come to know, is a legitimate asshole, but he's not a killer. Heck, you can't even pick a proper secret hideout, so you'd make a horrible villain."
"Wanda's gone into labor, Tony," Rhodey says, walking into the portal frame. "
“No! I want a car all to myself, pleaseeeee,” Peter whines, bending over to look into Bucky’s blue eyes upside down. He sits upright and pleads to his father, pouting his lower lip out. “Daddy can I, can I?”
Processing.
The outline of Tony's manhood was visible even from his loose boxers and Steve's mouth start to water. It surprises him how much he wanted to be
Sam wanted to address his concerns over Steve's high level altruism, but he thought the better of it, a conversation for another time. "Well, I'm glad you're happy, Steve. Tony seems like a pretty complicated person to be in a relationship with - half the time you look like you wanna punch him in the face, the other half of that time you spend agonising over a butt plug he gave you."
With a pinched smile, Tony makes a micro hand wave. "Merry Christmas."
"I knew that," Peter answers all too quickly, but his cheeks gradually turned pink against his pasty white skin.
Whilst Steve's mind was crowded by thoughts of his ex lover, he rarely discussed the brunette openly, vocally. It became an unspoken thing that any discussion regarding Stark would not receive the benefit of Steve's input, even though Steve seemed to speak through his aqua blue eyes when it came to Tony. It never stopped him from paying attention though.
propose," Pepper concludes.
but did not take.
of you." Steve guides Tony's right hand against his erection and Tony actually breaks the kiss to gasp. As though he actually needed the visual confirmation, Tony presses his forehead against Steve's collarbone to peek. Steve was hard as a rock, and
, no less - nearly three years waking up in a different century and Sam decided at that very moment that no matter how excruciatingly awkward this topic was for him, he was going indulge the super soldier like a good friend.
Tony's last words were still ringing in Steve's ears; twelve tubs of ice cream in a span of six days bears witness to its effect. But now the brunette was standing in the hallway of Bucky's not so secret apartment, halfway across the globe, two days after Christmas with...
Gone are the days Steve would tell Sam to
"I don't know, Pep."
"You guys are talking now though. That's a start," Nat considers.
"Fix him?"
He winces.
He outdid himself this time.
Eerily, this place looks similar to Steve's apartment back in Brooklyn.
Steve wanted to meet in Wakanda.
" Natasha says, making a reference.
There was a pregnant two seconds before Sam narrows his eyes, wondering if Steve had completely missed his point. Of course he did.
The last time you came over, I owe you an explanation -"
The team had finally learned to work like one, as their relationships improved greatly through extended periods of time spent sparring at the gym and training together at the special simulator ground designed by Stark at the compound.
"I knew what that reactor meant to him. I used that information against him, just like how I selfishly hid the truth about his parents' death."
Who was he kidding though? After what happened at the bunker, after he chose to use the words “..if you need me” instead of
The delivery man had walked out of the van, clutching a package. Tony recognizes the old man from somewhere ---
Tony remembers how streams of water ran over Steve’s face as his lips stretched around Tony’s cock. Tony remembers grinding his full, thick length into Steve, hitting his sweet spot with every thrust. Tony remembers Steve crying his name in pleasure, pleading, begging to feel every inch of Tony as he spilled across the bathroom floor, as he milked Tony into euphoria.
Steve had made no plans on using the phone that fateful evening. Steve had zero strategy in place, no rehearsed opening line. No pleasantries. Just his bleeding heart on his sleeve.
Like clockwork, a heavy tear drop escapes and streams down his cheek. Steve quickly wipes his eyes, sniffles through his nose. The sight just melts Tony into a puddle and he crawls over to Steve on his knees, taking his hands into his own as he kneels in front of the man.
Now he may have given up the chance to ever be that.
"I walked right into that one, didn't I?" Tony concedes, a hand up in surrender.
Tony's two slick fingers easily slid into Steve's entrance, earning a loud gasp, and Steve, ever so impatient, wiggled his ass before pushing down, fucking himself over Tony's fingers wantonly.
The two former teammates had stepped out to the patio, where the swinging bench hung. It was dark, the air cool with the moonlight above them. Yet there was unspoken tension.
, clothed and (half) naked. There was desire in those blue eyes, but the same can be taken as curiosity. The fact remains that Steve had only been attracted to women before Tony crashed landed into his life. So it was a fair question from Tony, one that didn't require an immediate knee-jerk response.
If only Tony realizes that he was just staring at Steve, wide-eyed and unblinking.
He’d missed having Rhodey around, his only family left apart from Steve and Peter.
Opening one eye, he peeks at Laura Barton standing two feet away, a cup of steaming coffee in hand, appearing fully prepared to apologise, but she doesn’t. Tony extends an arm to take the coffee mug to stop her from handing it to him. It was unnecessary to add further awkwardness of him recoiling to an act of hospitality. He was embarrassed enough having been caught choking on fresh air and daisies.
have unlocked an achievement that he should not have. When he first realised that feelings beyond infatuation were in the mix, Tony did the calculations and weighed the options - the odds were not horribly against him, being a man confident in his own skin. But considering this
Steve scrunches up his nose in disinterest. “Nope, not doing it for me at all,” he says, all but lies.
Steve burst into a hearty laugh and lightly smacks Sam's arm. "Look, I did apologize to you about that one.”
"What did Tony want?"
, had you turned up at our wedding, maybe it wouldn’t be so bad,” Tony adds.
“Party downtown. But it’s like an exclusive Tony Stark party, so you can’t come.” Bucky smiled, and patted Jake on the shoulder.
he still refused out of shyness alone.
“Last year I OD’d. When I was in the hospital, they found that I had an infected lung. Pneumonia. From drugs.” Some cars on the street below begun honking, loudly, the breeze blowing through them. “So, I woke up in the hospital, three days later, with a hole in my chest. Because I was dying and nobody knew, so they just did the surgery.”
“Hey coffee is text book addiction, I’m slowly weaning myself off.”
“Someone’s eager,” said Steve, his gaze shifting from Tony's eyes to his stature.
Steve’s stroking himself faster now, heaving and letting out low growls as he tugs on his balls and aggressively fists the base. “Take it, bitch,” he says to himself, imagining he’s uttering those words to Tony as he begs for it, screams for it, says Steve’s name like a fucking prayer. Even with all the fantasy, it’s not enough. He needs the real thing to fuck, to use, to break. Watch his eyes roll back, watch him tear up when it’s too much. Fuck, just the mental image of Tony crying on his cock has him coming faster than he thought. He lets out a surprised gasp when he does so.
Fuck.
“Take my dick out, suck it until I say stop.”
“Did you need anything?” Steve said, trying to sound even keeled, though everything Tony said left him not knowing how to properly respond.
Both Anthony and Tony pulled away from Antonio, murmuring something along the lines of “don’t even start.”
When finally in front of him, Steve thinks about possible scenarios, all degrading and horrific, but he settles for buildup. “Take off your boxers, sit on the desk and jerk off. When you get close, stop. if you come, I’ll slit your throat.”
“I know. I just…” Steve doesn’t finish his sentence, but Tony can connect the dots, he backs away from the bar that looks as if it’s never been touched.  Time is nearing but they both refuse to talk about anything. He wonders how the others are handling it; wonders if it’s any better than he's doing right now.
Small gasps left him, each harsher tug to his nipples edging on a new type of pain he had yet to explore. It was addictive, and he needed it to stay constant, Tony felt a cry about to leave him but Steve stopped all of a sudden.
“You heard me.”
The hand was gone after a minute or two, and then Steve was drawing at his desk. He could hear the scraping and scratching of pencil against paper, only imagining what the images probably looked like based on the various unfinished paintings up on the wall. Every once in a while, Steve’s gaze would fall back onto Tony, flashing a grin, then continuing to work with a hardened expression.
It’s all a lie; the glamor and the swag, the bluster and the bravado. He can’t remember when he started lying to himself along with the whole world, but now he’s too damn scared to stop. What bothers him more is the man who sees through him. If Tony were a window, he’d be thick and tinted, plastered with dirt and grim and layers of dust that make it impossible to look without putting in some effort to get past it. He wonders how Steve does it. He doesn’t know if Steve even has to try to do so, as most of the time it’s only grunts and few words that pass between them—matter of fact, the most they talk is when they’re having sex.
He sinks into the couch from across the bar, for once not letting his thoughts wander. He knows it’s his fault, so what’s the point of confessing it now? Steve looks as if he’s expecting him to break at any second, stagnant, tensing his jaw, which is nothing new. It's clear, however, in this moment, that he’s waiting for something Tony just can’t seem to give.
Tony scrunched up his face a bit. He’d never really thought about it. Subconsciously, he might have come to a decision, but he’s never had to answer this question. Overall, Tony had a pretty normal life. CEO of a tech company, making enough money for himself and then some, a small group of friends that he loved dearly, and yet there was this feeling that was like an itch.
Tony gasps, trying to catch his breath or possibly his last shred of dignity. Steve keeps watch of his face, the blood now creating a sleek, red line down the side of his lip. It’s hypnotic, and in that moment Steve realizes he wants to see Tony bleed. He’s not sure if it’s metaphorical, but there’s a sense of submissiveness Steve’s finds in bleeding. He feels himself get excited, so he drops him.
“Well I can tell there's nothing wrong based on that eloquent answer. Oh, and you haven’t looked me in the eye since you’ve arrived.”
At any rate, he decided on white garters with a light blue ribbon in the center of the thigh, the color carried throughout the lace of the garters and panties. Next, he put on the panties themselves. He loved slipping on stockings, seeing his thighs slip behind opaque nylon made him shiver, followed by the garter belt, snapping and securing each section before slipping on his trousers. He heard a slight creak in the door, then two soft knocks.
Tony did what his master said. There was a moment of silence, and then he felt the beautiful pain once more. The feeling of cold metal against his nipples produced a cry from the submissive, his back arched and body shook, he felt clammy and exposed.
“Probably not.”
Still on his knees, Tony crawled to where the come started to seep into the rug and licked and sucked as much as he could from it. A broken chuckle fell from the soldier, and when Tony peered up, he saw him shaking his head. Disappointment? Disgust? Who cared. Tony kept at it eagerly, and eventually he heard the clinking of a belt near him. Steve tipped his chin up with the hand not covered with come, the one with come on it lifted to Tony's mouth. He, again, lapped it up and let out a shaky sigh. It was almost like relief, finally getting a taste of something he craved. Steve was probably watching him but Tony, for once, didn't try to put on a show, and was zeroed in on Steve’s big hand. The leather on his palm swept against his tongue, and it had him moaning.
“I'm serious, do you really want me to hurt you Stark?”
Tony preferred moderately priced, white table cloth places for his first outings. Nothing too loud or distracting, so he could focus on whether or not he was wasting his time. Being the busy man he was, the use of online communities to meet people was almost a must. It made his life a hell of a lot easier, considering how difficult it was to find someone willing to cater to his specific needs without him having to ask for it.
“A long story involving a brain tumor, Reed Richards, and me almost getting married. A long story for another day.”  A long story he wasn’t emotionally comfortable with relaying just yet, but they seemed to get the idea. Antonio melted into Tony’s touch, leaning over Anthony.
Steve says breathlessly. It’s all he hears from the man, the rest is just heavy breathing and the ringing of his belt buckle.
“This isn't about the rules, but I was wondering when we were meeting up tomorrow.”
Steve then removed his hand and started stroking himself again, and Tony didn’t move while he watched. Part of him still reeling from his orgasm and another part of him, well, had patience. Maybe obedience had something to do with it. He didn’t want to conflict with how far they’ve gotten. He never dreamed Steve would feel comfortable pissing next to him in a urinal, let alone bringing Tony to an orgasm (although it was via getting the shit kicked out of him) or stroking his gorgeous cock in front of him.
“Apple.”
The genius was half aware of being lifted and carried, he put together someone moved him the next morning, soft pillows underneath his head and warm sheets covering his skin. There was that drool again, all over the pillow too. Wiping the side of his mouth with the back of his hand, he pulled himself up out of the bed, taking a mental note to get his now dirtied sheets changed.
"Go to Steve."
That bright morning however, the usually suave brunette was actually
"Oh Tony your
The once-inventor regularly endures panic attacks and nightmares every other night, waking up in cold sweat, barely being able to breathe and muttering the words “I’m sorry” over and over again until he fell asleep exhausted.
“You look edible," Tony whispers to Steve's chest as he tugs the lapels. Steve was wearing a two-piece Tom Ford suit and it snugged in all the right places. "Where’s Peter?” Tony asks, looking over Steve’s shoulder.

Sam hooks his arms behind his neck and leans against the armrest, facing Steve. "So you came back to DC."

together," he finally blurts.
Tony smiles weakly. "Been better."
"Then don't tell him. He's not gonna find out because I'll be home in 48 hours. I promise. Cover for me?"
"No, not really. Look kid, I'm sorry, I just
Steve frowns a little. "Can we
Tony sucked cock like a champ, not that Steve had any previous experience getting a blowjob to compare. Tony engulfed the head again, this time moving the tip of his tongue over the slit to swaddle the supersoldier's super precome that was leaking like a faucet. He sunk down again, took the full length of Steve down his throat, breathing through his nose. He hollowed his cheeks as he sucked and swallowed Steve's cock like a lollipop and Steve used all his strength from keeping his hips from thrusting into Tony's throat, conscious of his strength.
Steve recoiled to Tony's finger touching him, as though it burned.
He knew he was home.
He collapses on the floor, white as a ghost. All he wants to do is run away from his own stifling body, but he couldn't.
"I'll make you a new one. A better one that doesn't need to be lubed up every time you have an itch to scratch." Tony flashes his signature smile, teasing. "Look, I rather we don't go through that conversation again. But the offer stands without an expiration date. I really hope you make the right choice."
Steve breathes quietly, he shuts his eyes and continues knocking his head backwards against the firm surface, hoping his friend would take the hint and leave him alone. All the while he continues to grip the precious cargo in one hand.
"I thought you were gonna say kill me," Bucky kids but Tony winces. They've spoken about The Incident. Many times before. They've made peace, they've put it behind them. But every now and then the nightmares do reoccur, solid and clear, as though Tony was right there in the backseat of the car watching the metal arm reaching out for his mother's neck. These were Tony's demons though, he was not going to continue punishing James Buchanan Barnes for HYDRA's crimes.
Steve sighed deeply, tired of talking to himself and Tony could feel the soldier ready to hang up the phone. Tony's heart rate spiked, already regretting his last thought.
"Did you know I asked him to marry me Pep?"
"She's ..." Tony starts, but shakes his head. He clasps his hands to his mouth, grinning into it as he finally breaks into a teary happy laugh. "Steve, she's here. Our baby's finally here. Fuck we're gonna be parents to a newborn baby. Oh man. Peter's gonna freak out!"
Clint takes a deep breath.
But Tony the gentleman, will not kiss and tell.
“Hey buddy” Tony says softly, kissing his son’s forehead. “You gonna wish your old man a happy birthday?”
"Oh you want to skip to the
"Okay, fair enough. But darling, we're having a picnic under the stars, we're overlooking this gorgeous city on the first day of the year and I'm 2 seconds away from -" Tony thumbs over the waistband of Steve's briefs and tugs it over his cock to free the man, "- oh Steve look at you. Jesus you're so wet for me," Tony says, losing his train of thought at the sight of Steve's length, drenched with precome.
"Not right now at least, not anytime soon. I don't want you to get into more trouble. I know we -  if it's not too much... can we meet somewhere else?"
Also the day the blue eyed super soldier shyly told him that he loved him.
Bucky pauses. "Did you have anything in your pockets?
"Honey," Tony interrupts Steve with another kiss, wet and sloppy as he cups Steve's jaw, drawing him in. "It's our anniversary. We've been married for 5 years, and you've been making love to me for much longer than that. You know what I like, what I can take. Let's christen our new vibranium-reinforced bed, - love it by the way, best anniversary present ever - and make the most out of that sound-proof spell I got us for tonight." Tony chuckles lowly at the last thought, remembering that horrendous ordeal of having their four year old walking in on them mid-coitus about a month back because poor Petey thought wolves were howling that night.
love? Barnes?!"
“Unless you want to?" Tony asks gently, almost needing to duck his head to meet Steve's eyes. He tips the chin of the suddenly shy blonde to meet his gaze. "Not that you
I couldn't. See, the bastard cockblocked me before I could get on my knee-"
"I did! - well,
What he actually wanted to say was there were three other people who could walk in on them in this very compromising position, one of them was their infant son. The nightmare of every parent.
He momentarily stops, flips the phone open and it lights up.
At that moment, Tony doesn't seem to care anymore.
“It’s from Uncle Rhodey, Petey” he says, handing his son the goods. Peter turns to his Daddy and excitedly waves the parcel with both hands.
Steve’s eyebrows shot up.
“Peter,” Tony repeats himself as he picks up the plastic plate with Peter’s half-eaten dinner that Steve had left on the coffee table, and proceeds to squat next to the toddler. He still loomed over his tiny son, so he plants a hand on the carpet to duck lower. “
Social functions were another way of Stark tearing down his walls around Steve. He was the only Avenger Tony would readily invite along, mostly because Steve was, after all a national icon. Any benefit attended by Steve Rogers in a dress uniform and Tony Stark counted as extremely successful. Besides, Steve was too
"Don't you have somewhere to be?" Tony asks, hinting for some time alone with Steve.
Opening the door, he definitely didn't expect to come face to face with Tony.
"He's nice," Tony croaks, before clearing his throat. "You'd like him if you met him. In a normal setting without tarmac, and trucks and planes being thrown in your direction. He'd make you breakfast, tell you to sleep regularly, keep you safe on the battlefield and harp on your safety like a mother hen because he's really that kind of person who cares." Before he knew it, Tony was describing all the ways Steve took care of him, and not exactly a general description Peter was asking for.
About them.
Tony chews the insides of his cheek, looking away.
Of course Tony had no idea, at the time, that his phone call to Steve after the whole Triskelion fiasco had
at Tony.
"But right now, right now like you said - I'm checking out for a while. I need to screw my head straight because - see he's Steve to me. Not just Cap, Captain America or some fugitive the world is ready to condemn. He's Steve Rogers to me. I don't expect you to understand everything, and I also don't want you to think this is easy for me. But I need to go him. I just don't know if I can. I freak out just thinking about everything that's happened."
“God no,” Tony snaps, flinching hard at the sudden unwelcomed proximity but he immediately regrets the way it rolled off his tongue. "Sorry I don't, I'm not into touching. Nothing personal though." Peter retracts his offer without taking any offence and takes two steps backwards. He momentarily pauses before he whips out his mobile phone - a Starkphone that Tony had made for him - and starts to type something, his tongue licking the corners of his mouth.
And Steve?
enjoying having Tony's ass pressed against his crotch) but when the weight of Tony returns, the genius' pants were gone.
Steve frowns into space and looks to Tony. “What was
"He's pretty wiped out. Good luck," Bucky continues, taking in Tony's struggles with too much delight. Tony grunts as he carefully peels his limbs from under Steve. Thankfully the super soldier shuffles, giving Tony some space to wiggle out of his grip, and onto the floor. Steve didn't seem to realise that the warm body he was pressed against was now gone and he continues to sleep.
Well, when it was put like that... “What will you need to do? Are there any sort of protections we can use to stack the deck in our favor?”
“You say it pretty often. How about you find a new dead horse to beat?”
“Let’s get you--”
The plates are trendy squares of delicate porcelain, muted gold in shade and chilled to the touch, a decadent scarlet feast painstakingly laid out before him. He’s always been a steak man, and it’s a cut any connoisseur would’ve happily murdered for—planked Châteaubriand, shaped in a heart because even undead abominations could be romantic. Bleu-rare, the meat obviously
It takes some doing, getting Tony’s clothes off, but they are eventually naked, and Tony’s staring up at him with a look of disbelieving awe, like he still can’t believe they’re here in this moment, and Steve can sympathize.
Steve’s always been one to get punched
Tony groaned as garish red and blue lights pulled out behind him, kicked on his blinkers to indicate to the cop behind him that no, he did not wish to engage in a high-speed chase, and continued to drive until he reached a wide enough stretch of road that they wouldn’t be murdered by a random driver barreling through in the dead of night.
When he’s actually able to bear tracing things back to the very beginning, it boils down to the two things that have consistently made a ruin of his life: Hydra and Obadiah Stane.
Tony grinned as Steve took his hand, and Steve was certain that he’d never felt as giddy in his life as when Tony’s lips quirked up into a grin. “I’m glad, too. It means I got to meet you.”
“Tony, what a--”
--and Tony honestly didn’t know what to make of it.
“Move in me. I want to feel you, Tony.”
Steve cups Tony’s jaw, presses a kiss to Tony’s brow, follows the trail of a bead of sweat down the bridge of his nose with feather-light pecks and then kisses him full on the lips, shattering Tony in gentle increments as he gives him everything he’s been wanting since the Chitauri invasion, everything he’s dreamed off and longed for and never quite knew how to get. It’s what he’s been wanting since he woke up from the portal to see bright eyes and a relieved grin saying they won.
He’d been a dead man walking, but not alone.
Steve wasn’t sure what he had been expecting when Nat had told him where he was supposed to be meeting his mystery date, but it certainly wasn’t having his face rubbed in how much his old stomping grounds had changed.
“Let him go and put your weapons down!”
“Leave it, Jan.”
was more like it.
to have his sub collared in order to make it clear who was in charge, Tony had long since learned, which worked just fine for him because he personally despised being collared. It reeked too much of old-world expectations of subservience and role inequality, and he already had enough neurosis on his plate without dealing with automatically being second-guessed and underestimated and written off as “just a bratty sub” as well, all of which tended to accompany him being seen in a collar.
Tony had, oh shit, Tony had fingered himself open, and suddenly the image was
, and if God didn’t hear it, then surely at least the aliens the next galaxy over picked up Steve’s screaming and could pass the message along. The trick was all in the pitch; the lower register humming was the way to go, because the higher registers just meant Steve whimpered and sobbed desperately as he attempted to pump his hips with little success. He was just too off balance, and Tony exploited that ruthlessly.
Steve stopped in front of a bakery that proudly announced itself to be 100% organic and vegan. “Why did you pick this area to meet? You could have easily chosen something close to the Tower.”
, but succeeded only in producing a sex-hazed mumble, barely staying afloat in his own mind. He was too dizzy and lightheaded to form a coherent thought, much less dabble in

There is a loud curse as Clint, Jan, and Carol approach, and Steve rolls his eyes when Clint slaps a bill into both Carol and Jan’s palms.
He needs him.
“Let me make you mine, Tony.” He lifts Tony’s chin with the crook of his finger, staring deep into his soul as he twists the verbal knife with exquisite precision.
“Tony.”
As if prompted by his thoughts turning towards goats, Steve trundles away from him and begins to gnaw on the white silk curtains.
In the center of it all was Tony, wonderfully, gloriously naked, an inscrutable expression on his face. It might have been appraisal, might have been lust, might have even just been Tony mentally off on a tangent and staring through him.

“Your Avengers made it seem as if I needed to speak with Tony rather urgently. A broken amulet and a goat, and something gone wrong with the serum, I believe?”
It had taken a long time, and there had been three weeks of
Tony wondered what new life-improving change he was about to develop.
Dammit.
“I’m no--” Tony trails off, the words clogging in his throat, and Steve feels a hint of self-satisfaction at that.
“Tony. This whole situation is bullcone. I know how you feel about me. Everyone in this entire mansion knows how you feel about me. Why are you sitting here trying to deny it? Have I done
gives you pause, old man.”
Shit, the man was like a furnace. Tony tried to shift to catch more of the cool breeze but utterly failed, caught up tight against Steve as he was, and the hot and heavy weight of of the larger man against him sent a thrill up his spine as he visualized all the many, wonderful, perfect ways Steve could take him apart, and just how wonderful it would feel to be pinned under that heavy and demanding body as it moved over him with carnal purpose. Steve probably fucked like a tank, and Tony was certain that if circumstances ever allowed him an opportunity to get Officer Grant actually inside him, he’d be absolutely wrecked by the end of it.
She gestures for Tony to stand in the smaller circle a few feet away from the quartz and selenite circle as Jan leads a heartbreakingly solemn goat to the tourmaline circle. It’s almost like the goat can pick up on his emotions. Maybe Steve’s back?
“This looks like a place people go to get stabbed.”
Tony freezes in shock, his brown eyes snapping up to meet Steve’s azure blue gaze. It feels like drowning in still arctic water, like being seen and pulled apart and
“Not as much as you love Steve, though.”
Steve licks his lips as he lowers the glass, a hint of fang exposed in the glow of candlelight.
“Our fair Witch does not cast with incantations, but this is a mixture of Asgardian curses and Vanir sorcery, and we would see the risk lightened. You must remain silent once we begin.” Thor moves to Tony’s circle, parallel Wanda yet outside the barrier of crystals.
“Remind me to tell you about this whorehouse Dum-Dum Dugan, Monty Falsworth, and I all wound up hiding in after we got separated from the rest of the Commandos. We had to pass the time somehow, and I think I worked my way through three or four of the girls that night.”

Steve does that.

This though...this was thick and slick enough that it offset the natural roughness of Tony’s palm, and Steve found himself rolling his hips, chasing more and more of the frissons of pleasure that traveled through him as he thrust into Tony’s loose hold. Tony’s fingers would occasionally drop out of their loose fist and take on a life of their own, each one moving in their own little sphere of influence. Tony’s thumb would unerringly find its way to the head of his erection, spreading the thick precome there around the sensitive flesh, nothing rushed or hurried in his movements, just slowly indulging Steve’s whims as he picked up on them.
Tony’s still cursing under his breath, not that it matters because everyone else is ignoring him in favor of the elephant in the room.
Natasha’s smile was vicious and smug, like a cat who had stolen the cream, eaten the mouse, caught the bird, and pinned the resultant carnage on the dog.

Why are you so nervous?”
The entire floor is pure African Blackwood, a perfect conduit between the physical and metaphysical, and excellent for work with energies classically associated with death. The walls are also paneled in blackwood, and the east and west walls are covered in floor to ceiling shelves containing a vast assortment of liquids, powders, plant clippings, stones, and crystals. The north wall houses miniature bars of the highest quality alchemical metals (excepting the mercury—that’s in a massive jar and tightly sealed). It’s no Fort Knox, but the bars of gold alone are enough to make a dragon salivate.
Steve pressed a kiss to the side of Tony’s neck, flushed and hot with exertion, and nuzzled against his cheek, savoring the prickle of Tony’s meticulously groomed facial hair.
Delight sparkled in Natasha’s eyes. "Oh-hoh, what's this now? A mysterious lover from your tender youth? Was he your first?”
“That!” Steve gestured wildly at Tony. “

Tony taken care of, Steve continued, not releasing Tony’s cock as he chased his own orgasm now. Tony convulsed and bit at Steve’s shoulder, muffling his high-pitched whines of overstimulation, shivering and trembling and falling apart as Steve pumped up and down their cocks frantically.
I love it, love the feel of you, the way you’re so heavy and just dripping for me.” Tony nibbled at Steve’s ear as he continued the obscene litany, and Steve broke, crowding into Tony’s space until he was flush against him, grinding and rubbing against Tony, letting out a pleased hum as he grew more and more aroused until he was just as hard as Steve.
The goat--Steve--is standing in front of him now, staring up at him. So is everyone else in the room. Tony traces one of the massive horns curling up and back on Steve’s head, and tries not to read too much into the way the goat--
Steve took in a deep breath and nodded, exhaled as Tony took that as his cue to move forward. It went this way for a short while, Steve gulping down air and controlling his breathing in order to better handle the thick, delicious slide of Tony inside until he finally bottomed out, whispering a fervent string of curses under his breath.
Steve manages not to jump, but only just barely, and he shoots a glare at the figure on the opposite side of the portal that has opened up in the middle of the room. “Strange.”
Tony shies away from that thought, the migraine that’s been looming at the very edges of his senses dulling down and almost entirely away.
Everyone looks at Steve, who looks like an escapee from some random robot anime, and then back at Tony in varying stages of disbelief, and Tony does his best to brazen it out. It’s embarrassing enough that his ridiculous fixation on Steve has been so thoroughly exposed, but he doesn’t need it brought up every other second. He knows well enough that Steve doesn’t reciprocate--they’ve known each too long and been through too much for dissembling. If Steve were interested, something would have been said already. His only hope now is to just let this all blow over as random magical insanity and play it cool so that their friendship isn’t jeopardized. What he
He’s slipping away.
“You wouldn’t be the first,” Tony muttered sourly. “Mab would see him dead for that audacity alone. She has no great love for Hydra in the first place, and to claim Winter’s name and then wreck her plans? She’s set her Knight after the Winter Soldier before.”
When they finally broke free, Tony trailed a finger across Steve’s lips, the pale circle of light from Steve’s flashlight leaving his face partially shadowed.
that if it weren’t for the fact they need to be in constant contact or the goat thing kicks back in, Tony would be running off to hide.
wear you out.
Steve had never seen his tsum so excited. It chittered urgently at him, and Steve was honestly surprised the tsum hadn’t up and started shoving him along. The tsum’s urgency was starting to affect him, and an odd mix of trepidation and anticipatory glee began to churn in his gut as his gait lengthened from a stride to a jog and then finally an all-out run.
A goddamn Starbucks.
Tony has his boardroom and an executive office on the 42nd floor of Stark Tower for when he needs to handle SI business (or at least properly cow scheming board members, recalcitrant investors, and nosy journalists).
Natasha shrugged. “My whole career is predicated on getting answers to questions people would rather not answer. It’s no shame in being bi.”
“Call your suit, Tony, and get us back to the Tower. You’re going to fuck me good and proper, and then maybe do it again if you’ve got the stamina for it. We’ll talk in the morning.” Steve paused, and pressed another kiss to Tony’s chiseled jaw. “Or maybe the afternoon, if I really wear you out.”
“Excellent. How would you like to fling mud in Halliburton’s eye?”
Steve’s going to get his brains knocked out.
He wants to relive the hazy memory of soft lips and warm breath over his throat, wants the way his heart pounded as pleasure rushed down his spine and blew through his veins as Steve sucked greedy mouthfuls of his blood. He wants to revisit the ecstatic pleas, the writhing and dizziness and screaming as he shattered again and again as Steve held him down and
is what I’m talking about, right there! You’re so damn inconsiderate Tony!”
He thinks maybe he should be more concerned about the salmonella, but it’s so far down his list of priorities.
, how the fuck strong are y--mmmmph!” Tony gave up trying to talk and just held onto Steve’s biceps as the cop tried to crawl down Tony’s mouth by way of the filthiest kiss ever known. There was no grace or artistry to it, just Steve mashing his lips against Tony’s and going to town, his tongue sweeping into his mouth and seeking out every trace of himself he could reach.
“She reamed in the neck with a syringe, once. Just...shot me up with random drugs. No consent, no safeword, just strolled up and shoved it in there.” Tony pointed at his neck, which was absent of the deadly crosshatch that Steve had seen in his SHIELD file.

around. Honestly, Tony hates swans just as much as they apparently hate everyone else, but letting Steve kick the shit out of an uppity duck seems excessive.
This base was supposed to be unoccupied with minimal security, but you never really knew with Hydra. Tony’s utter lack of concern for things like security clearances or federal regulations in the face of discovering neo-Nazi cultists had infested SHIELD had won them an incredible amount of information, and all quietly enough that Hydra had no idea where the leaks in their intel was coming from, or how so many of their moles were disappearing.
“You are almost out of time, dear.” Tony follows Maria’s gaze to the reflection of the neat bite mark on his neck. “He’s had his taste, and more than once for you to react so strongly. There is venom in your veins, Anthony.”
That one...that one had broken him a bit more than anything else, and confessing to Tony about Howard and Bucky and what Hydra had warped his closest friend into--it had shattered him. It had shattered Tony, too, but somehow they’d managed to pick each other up and piece themselves back together and somewhere during the process they’d become...integral to each other. Peggy had been his past, but Tony was the future, and he’d drawn him into something that felt a little like home.
“Orthiel...Orthiel was one of the Host’s strongest warriors, Tony. When the Archangel Michael flung Lucifer into Hell, Orthiel was there, casting out many of the Fallen after him. He went to the Northern lands soon afterward, and then...he Fell himself.”
Steve can almost believe that is the sum of it too, but Tony’s eyes flicker away from his, and even if he
Steve fucked like he fought, rough and dirty and determinedly, his mind set on only one goal and his partner dragged along for the ride.
“So blue hair’s a no-go. Still got a thing for brunettes?”
The black and gray marbled sunken tub that took up most of the northwestern corner of the room was filled with steaming hot water and a neatly organized assortment of bottles were laid out on the shelf carved into the matching marbled wall. A stack of the luxuriantly soft bath towels Tony preferred were settled on the nearby counter in the center of the room, and the massive shower opposite the tub was running, and Steve gazed longingly at it, already envisioning standing under the spray created by the massive rainfall shower head that reached across the entirety of the shower’s ceiling while the four horizontal jets--two each on the opposing walls of the shower--soothed away his aches and pains for a while.
true, because Tony doesn’t easily lay his feelings on the line like that.
Steve stands up, his white shoes squelching as he walks through the spilled “food” to loom over Tony.
. Tony suddenly twisted his left nipple at the same time as he sucked at the other one, an almost rough sensation that sent molten heat careening along his nerves and Steve’s knees buckled as he nearly whited out from the intense sensation of his orgasm crashing through him, shuddering and twitching and panting for breath as he collapsed on Tony.
” Tony snaps, and he moves to stand up and no doubt storm away, but Steve rises with him. If nothing else, he

He was going to name her Mae, in honor of Mae Jemison, who rocketed into space, and Mae West and Mae Questal, respectively the original bad-girl starlet and voice of Betty Boop, the original bad-girl cartoon. Triple-layered pun. Inordinately pleased with himself, Tony stroked a hand over the gearshift, caressing the custom silver head lovingly as his demon-girl purred for him. Yeah, baby. Yeah.
the smugness radiating off of you, Brooklyn.”
Tony startles, because the last thing he’s been expecting out of all this is to have Steve’s voice in his head. Cautious relief begins to sneak into his mind, alongside curiosity and wariness. Steve’s in his mind. Or...is he in Steve’s mind? Is this permanent? Is it really Steve? It…it feels like Steve? It’s Steve’s mental voice, and something inside him
There’s a loud crash and then Clint calls back to them from the cockpit. “Whatever you guys are doing, figure it out now. Doom just cracked the first layer of the Baxter Tower’s defenses!”
Steve dies on a Saturday.
“Steve has Sharon. And Billie. And a whole slew of other options.” Tony shakes his head, a bitter twist to his lips. “Steve likes women, and even if that weren’t the case, he could do so much better than me. I’m not going to ruin our friendship by pushing for more than I deserve.”
The soft and easy build of pleasure washed over him slowly, and Tony was keyed right into his responses, meeting--and sometimes anticipating--what he wanted without fail.
Tony loves him. He can

now. Last time had been purely reactionary. Maybe he ought to see about recreating those circumstances.
Tony hates magic, and what he does in his craft room is not that.
Steve let out a stuttering cry as Tony suddenly latched onto one of his nipples, teasing the pert bud with his tongue. Tony alternated between circling it and flicking his tongue against it as Steve whimpered and moaned and writhed and
had more swagger and charm, but it also seemed natural with him, like there was no artifice. There was no denying the ego, but it was tempered with an inherent charisma that made for a potent effect. It was hard to resist genuine, even if it was genuine Trouble.
Steve’s vision whited out as the vibrator kicked back on again, and he went tumbling down into what was promising to be a great orgasm, so long as Tony kept that speed up, oh please oh please oh--
He was infuriating and a bit of an ass, but he was also startlingly generous and could be quite kind. He was brash and bold and suave, but also tormented, and insecure, and Steve wasn’t quite sure he’d ever be able to get a definitive read on the man.
good night.
Compared to those, the vibrating plug Tony had chosen to use was barely worth noticing, maybe four inches long, and barely as thick as his thumb. The only thing that made it stand out was the hot-rod red coloring and the glowing blue disc that sat flat on the base, looking like one of those futuristic digital blueprints Tony created. It was smooth metal, and shaped like a bullet, and as unassuming as Steve had been unimpressed.
Christ, I thought the rumors about you being found were bullshit. I’m glad they aren’t, don’t get me wrong!”
Steve loved this era’s cars, and this one was more beautiful than anything he’d set his eyes on, the metallic red super-car with its iridescent sheen glinted in the pale moonlight, the darker patches of dark gray carbon fiber finish on the roof, front hood, and intake fins gone black in the night and adding a mysterious depth to the Saleen’s overall appearance. It was still flashy and absolutely ostentatious, but it was so damn pretty, and it worked for Stark, somehow.
It’s a free-for-all now, and Tony makes his way to the huddle of police, unable to do much without his armor. Thor is battering Wrecker and Piledriver with his hammer while Steve butts at their legs and backs, keeping them off-balance and vulnerable to the demigod’s attack. Wanda, Jan, and Vision have Thunderball well in hand, and Clint and his trick arrows keep Bulldozer from rallying effectively against Carol’s continued pummeling.
Steve’s Adam’s Apple bobbed as Tony strolled toward him, completely at ease in his own skin, before stopping just in front of him.
Steve looks smug as hell about it, rolls them both over so that Tony is on top, rocks up against Tony as if to urge him to action, and Tony can’t help but sulk because he wants to take in that glorious expanse of muscle, the pale skin and chiseled perfection. Some sights deserve being burned into memory.
“Just ignore him, Steve.” Jan pats Steve’s back consolingly. "You look like you crawled out of a Calvin Klein ad, more than anything.”
At least...at least the shower would be good.
“No way! I’ll be confronting Doom directly, Steve! I’m better protected, but you don’t have that going for you. I’ll be drawing fire from all corners, and you can’t be separated from me, and I’m not endangering you like that!”
Should be.
Steve licked a hot stripe up the side of Tony’s neck, hot, wet, and

Tony was entirely unmoved and just an arched an eyebrow, wordlessly prompting him to continue.
For her shade to return now…
Hydra was back--had never really left, to be honest? Steve had never felt so enraged--bad enough that he had suffered so much and given up literally everything, but to learn it had ultimately been worthless? That he had given up everything and Hydra still managed to prosper in his absence?
The unshattered amulet though, that was a showstopper alright. The Blue Ādaraya had been a gleaming nest of delicate silver filigree adorned with flawless blue diamonds, and in the center of it all had been a massive heart-cut sapphire, deep vivid blue and reflecting an inner fire that caused it to sparkle and glimmer as the light played across its faceted surface. It had reminded Steve of Tony’s eyes, cold and unyielding, deep and secretive, warm and brilliant, always shifting from one to the other and back again.
“Milo, how are you? Let’s start up a tab, my usual please, and I’ll leave my friend here to your tender mercies.” Tony placed a black American Express onto the countertop and slid a fifty towards the bartender. The fifty disappeared into Milo’s pocket, the card went into the till, and two napkins were placed onto the bartop in a matter of seconds.
There was a tell--a flutter in the muscle on the right side of Steve’s pelvic bone--that he quickly figured out meant that Steve was very close, and that’s when Tony would pull away and switch tactics. No reason to end the fun early, even if Steve did get grumpy about things and devolve into frenzied demands and agitated cussing.
Steve glared balefully at the small red remote, wanting nothing more than to knock it out of Tony’s hand and watch it break on the floor, ending his torment. That wouldn't end well in the long run, though. Tony had been unamused the last time Steve had tried it, and the payback had been sheer torture.
“He?”
“I’m not.”
Steve was used to it, though. From the first struggling breath he ever drew, he had known pain. His spine was crooked, and his back had long been a knot of tension and strained muscles. His legs ached, possibly from polio though he’d blessedly missed it ever fully presenting. He was weak and fatigued easily, and his own sparse weight sat too heavy on his brittle bones, leaving him wishing for a moment of relief, fleeting though it might be. His joints ached in the winter and when it rained, and when it was hot his skin burnt and peeled, leaving him miserable whether he was inside or out. His asthma reared its head often and without mercy, leaving him gasping and wheezing and struggling for a breath that just wouldn’t come, and when it did it was just barely enough air getting through his burning lungs that had squeezed tight and left him light-headed and unsteady on his feet..
He wanted more, wanted so much more, but first he had to slake this more immediate need.

“Steve...is that...are you...
Stark grinned. “I’m offering you legendary sex on top of a million-dollar car to not write me a ticket. Tickets are boring, and you’re unfairly hot, and I am compelled to not let the opportunity pass.”

When he finally came back to himself, it was to discover that Tony had stilled, and was running a gentle hand through his hair, softly massaging his scalp and murmuring soothing nonsense into his ear.
and Tony wasn’t trying his damndest to climb him like a tree.
Steve rolls his eyes and brings his hand up to cover Tony’s mouth. Tony’s eyes are full of panic, and he blinks rapidly before looking away.
There’s that overwhelming pulse of feeling down the bond as Tony obliges him, and the thought hits Steve on the tail end of it. Bridges go both ways, though, don’t they? He’s an

-thief, just...taking something of mine back. It was mine first.” Steve trailed off in mortification. “Oh, God.”
“It’s Stark!”
Sure, it made him stronger, faster, and much tougher than he’d ever imagined he would become (even knowing what the serum promised beforehand), but the one thing that no one had taken into account was the side effects. Namely, that the serum had exponentially increased his nerve sensitivity. The touches that registered as benign to other people could grow to become distinctly uncomfortable to him, pleasurable touches were almost so intense as to become unbearable, and pain itself was a fresh hell that made him long for the days before he’d become enhanced.
Steve started forward, only to freeze when the other man jumped up from the floor with a panicked expression. “I’m not a thief! Well, I mean, I’m breaking in, but it’s only because it’s my work that was stolen in the first place, and
His anvil.
The blue-white energy and red magic that has been crackling over the shield is suddenly entwined with warm gold light, and the three energies twine around each other, slamming through Steve and into the shield. Instead of dissipating, the energy is conducted through the shield and is instantly flung against the black tourmaline circle, and then the energy spreads out, following the flowing script and sigils drawn in between the circles until the whole thing is pulsing and glowing with the three different energies. Steve glows more and more as the spell takes hold, and then there is a flash of energy, much the same as when the amulet had originally exploded. There’s a shattering of glass in the background as a shockwave explodes out from the circle, knocking Tony ass over teakettle, and then everything dies down back into a strained silence.
that?”
Steve paused for a moment, but no one was approaching, and he dropped a mild look down at Tony, who was making soft demanding noises and attempting to rut against him with absolutely no success, trying to urge him into resuming.
Officer Grant’s expression went stern, and Tony could already feel the lecture brewing. Would this guy be the kind to just tear into somebody and rip them a new one, or would he be condescendingly long-winded? Maybe he would just cuss for a while and storm off--those were always fun. Oh hell, maybe it would be disappointed looks and moralizing about road safety.
Bucky) to kill his parents and Tony had Not Taken It Well, but they’d slowly moved past it and Steve could tell that Tony was stalling out, was starting to give way to his advances, and Steve had worked at him all the stronger until earlier that evening, after Tony had dragged him to some steakhouse or another and they’d been riding back up to Tony’s penthouse tucked just deep enough into each other’s personal space to not be innocent, Steve had moved to seal the deal and stolen a kiss.
They’re heading straight for them, and Steve is flooding their bond with belligerence. When Tony tries to back away and at least get off the bridge, Steve plants his feet and strains against the leash, ready to dart forward.
“Well, now, that

Steve tucked himself in as much as he could behind his shield and as he reached the tree line, angled himself so it could take the brunt of the impact as he crashed through a wild jumble of branches and neatly roll into a crouch to wait for Natasha to join him on the ground while Clint kept the Quinjet ready for a quick escape.
Steve let out a low groan as Tony squirted more soap over his body, continuing his self-appointed task with a graceful efficiency that Steve honestly appreciated. He wanted to speak, wanted to complain to Tony about the day, check in with Tony and see how
Steve froze, and looked at Natasha incredulously. “How do you even
Tony gave up the fight then, unwilling--unable, really--to move himself away from Steve’s fingers, and he rode the steady pumping thrusts with ease, letting his hips roll with the movements.
Tony braces himself. “Mother,
Steve recovered enough of his wits to murmur “Harder, Tony,” and Tony’s grip grew stronger, more relentless, but the pressure wasn’t constant. Instead Tony squeezed his hand up and down his length, working over his erection, sometimes pausing to let Steve pump their hands up and down his hardness in a slick glide but then easing off into a new range of sensations when it threatened to become too much for Steve.
His thighs tremble and his buttcheeks clench as Tony curls his tongue around the head of his cock, toying with the foreskin before he gives in to Steve’s insistent tugging and takes him all the way down again.
It didn’t take long at all, as worked up as they both were, and Steve savored a primal curl of satisfaction as Tony let out a wrecked noise and stiffened, coming in hot pulses over his hand, his cock. Steve didn’t release Tony, instead continued to twist and pump, working Tony all the way through his orgasm until he twitched and fell limp against Steve’s chest, gasping wetly.
“May I?”
Steve silently cursed Natasha’s meddling.
A stack of glowing blue holographic panels appeared in front of Steve, and Tony stared at a holographic version of him being kissed by Ty--
“You’re telling me that there’s nothing you can do to help?”
“‘kay. f’ckn magic…”
Steve gave Sam a once-over, pleased to note that though his new friend seemed tired (and weren’t they all?) he wasn’t blatantly injured. Looked pretty okay in fact. Steve let his gaze wander away from Sam back to the sleek iPhone, and the bright LED display that read ‘Marvin Gaye - Trouble Man’.

Steve let out an outraged noise as Tony stepped away from the bed, but most of it was muffled by the cloth gag Tony had tied across his mouth. He pulled first at one leather cuff then the other, but the elastic cording tethering each cuff to the bedposts was incredibly durable, stretching and straining with his struggles, but never snapping. Steve let out a startled yelp before he could try to wrest himself free as the vibrator Tony had worked inside of him began to buzz, pulsating directly against his prostate.
days.
Wanda turns and hurls the mystic ball of energy straight at Steve, who lets out a panicked cry and collapses down on the shield like he’s hugging it.
The idea of using Wanda’s magic was floated almost immediately, but Wanda’s powers derive from chaos, and she is reluctant to add her abilities to what is already a potent mixture of ancient displaced power, Amora’s magic, and... whatever the hell is going on with him.
