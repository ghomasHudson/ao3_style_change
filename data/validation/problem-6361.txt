"You don't wear underwear." Tony notes, amused, and he runs his thumb along the crown of Steve's dick.
Natasha. It never is personal with you. You would lead me to my death without remorse, then expect me to apologize for dying."
"I know you better than anyone, Rhodey, and this is not a social call." Tony says, and he wants to sound gentle, but the forced coolness in his voice is enough to snap Rhodey out of whatever he's planning.
Obviously, a fight breaks out. Wanda charges into him with her magic, because she's always hated Tony and this was just adding fuel to the flame; but she's still not as in control of her powers as she'd like to be and Tony's been on the frontlines for years. Vision does more to protect her than to attack Tony; which is understandable, considering some parts of him are made up of JARVIS, who had been created to protect him. Scott shrinks down to get closer and divert his attention like he'd done before, but gets flicked away like the bug he's named after.
"We can't do that, Wanda." Sam answers, and his wings unfurl from his back so he can join her in the air, "We're a really shitty group of friends, but we're still friends. We're
Just before he can step outside, Steve reaches out and grabs the sleeve of his shirt. A flicker of hope fills his chest; because if Steve stops him at least that means they can talk it out, right?
"Tony's the one who figured it out." James supplies, lips curling into a grimace that Steve for one agrees with completely.
Something in Tony's heart snaps. Or maybe just his entire heart just snaps. Tony can't really tell. He's trying to catch his breath, and Steve's words sound so lost and heartbroken. Steve doesn't deserve this from him, and maybe Tony really had been unfair, hadn't he?
Rhodey is taller, but not by much; his frame seemingly lanky but hiding taut muscles. He grins as soon as Tony gets up, and no affection is lost between them as Rhodey wraps his arms tight around the slighter. The eyes on them are questioning and thoughtful, but the pack leaves them to their greeting in peace despite the growing curiosity.
"Oh god. There's two of you." Bucky snorts, and he helps them cook and set the table, and Tony cleans up when Steve and Bucky move to the couch to bitch about whatever baseball team is playing that night.
The anger flies out of Tony immediately, and the brunet is left resigned as he covers his face with his hands. He's been years older than Steve even when they first met; but looking at him right then and now, Tony looks so old and tired.
Tony really wants to scoff at that, because Steve could be lying and playing him. The government, and especially that damned Fury, has been after him as soon as Tony had come home from Afghanistan. They had no idea about him being Iron Man, as far as he could tell, but of course they wanted him to make weapons like the Iron Man suit so they could use it for their own agendas.
Bruce and Thor, who choose to walk into the kitchen at that percise moment, and Thor's cheerful voice is a little too much in the morning. He's not the only one who thinks so, seeing the slightest twitch of Natasha's normally blank face.
The drive to New York is silent, tense, and full of doubtful glances; though, it's not like it's not welcomed. Although Tony feels stronger than ever before by just knowing Steve was sitting beside him, it did little to change what was happening in his life. Howard, albeit reluctantly, his father - dead. Obadiah, even through deceit, a father he would have rather had instead of his own - a possible traitor that wanted him dead. A pack, given to him through nothing but a coincidence - a group of innocents that were going to become colateral damage in something they didn't even fully understand.
"Sorry but I ain't got patience like the punk over here," Bucky replies, and his voice is just a little hard, "I can't follow you for years hoping you'll give me a chance. So I'm going to need it now; will you accept me or reject me?"
“Show me your hands,” he stated, watching as Pepper raised them slowly, distrust already clouding her eyes. Smart of her, considering the laundry list of tasks that Tony had asked of her, most of them unseemly.
The man Steve had saved from his own suicide. His injuries were extensive, his lawyers the best of the best. That wasn’t even getting started on the other suit filed by the victims of the train accident. Steve didn’t stand a chance.
Tony gazed up to see Steve Rogers blue eyes widened with concern staring back down in him. In the moonlight, the orbs seemed to almost glow.
"Don't bother trying to spin your way out of this one," snapped Pierce. "You told me that was where I would find The Captain. But you knew that's where the Ten Rings were holding Stark. You've got your little birds everywhere, don't you? Spinning your web, playing every side so everyone loses - except you, right? Well, we're done playing your game."
Tony stared at the other man quizzically until he finally glanced down at his clothes. Turns out cuddling a freezing mob boss in the backseat of a car can leave some lasting damage on clothes. “I’ll be fine,” Tony replied. “I’m not that wet.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Bucky interrupted, pulling Tony towards the jet ramp. Steve followed the pair in a daze, leaving all their things behind, to be picked up later. JARVIS would lock everything down until then. Soft lights guided them into the tower, and as soon as they were in the elevator, JARVIS started the assent to the penthouse silently.
He could see Steve’s brow furrow, no doubt another argument getting rearing to go, but Tony grabbed at the blonde’s hand. “As hot as I find it when you go domestic, we don’t have time for this. Santa’s got a few more presents to drop off.”
Steve could see Sam tense, but it didn’t matter. None of it mattered anymore. His mind was a run-away steam engine, plowing full speed ahead towards tracks that weren't there anymore. There was no plan, there wasn't anything - only the hot, boiling anger that fueled the engine to keep racing forward. Steve didn’t even turn to look back as Sam scurried out of the room, finally leaving him alone with the remaining prisoners.
The change of tone finally had Steve looking up at his husband, his hand still working furiously on the meat. “Wait, what?”
Steve let out a controlled breath, glaring down at the tiny machine. He thought about the satisfying sounds it would make if he crushed it in his hands.
Clint didn’t realize when he started hyperventilating. It was all too much. If he was kicked off the Avengers, he would have nothing left. He needed this.
Barnes snorted. “You didn’t come back there to save our asses; you’d probably be happier if some of us got killed off.”
Heart stopping, Steve dragged his hands all over his body, looking for any sort of wound, only to come back clean.
Steve’s mind was racing. Two explosions in one day, let alone in one hour was no coincidence. Tony was probably at Stark Industries now, but since he didn’t call, who knows what happened. But Steve trusted Tony. If anyone could handle an attack on his company, it was Iron Man. His team needed him now.
“I didn’t know,” Tony babbled, body shaking. “You have to believe me, I didn’t know, I didn’t know it was him.”
Steve’s breath hitched as his brain replayed Tony flopping around the hospital bed, the doctors screaming, the instruments blaring as they struggled to get his blood pumping again. "His heart stopped," Steve whispered brokenly. "Twice."
There was a time when Tony would have laughed, jesting that yet again, he’d proven his husband wrong. But not this time.
Steve watched him go before turning back into the building, blatantly ignoring the smug look that Natasha was sending him. Fight first, Tony later. The sooner they finish up here, the sooner he could go home. And then, Tony. Easy.
Bucky had been furious, livid with Tony in a way that he hadn’t been since he first met the man. How could he act that way, how could he just
Stark huffed. "Consider me invested. Whether I like it or not, you've dragged me into this mess. I don't have the time or patience for you and your people to blunder about. This needs to be taken care of."
wasn’t supposed to be here, what the hell did you do?” he joked, punching Clint lightly in his shoulder. “Anyway, Kujo’s bright idea was to hoof it through the woods to make sure he didn’t see us.”
Stark met his gaze slowly, but understanding shown in his eyes. “Job’s not done. Besides, I didn’t want you to get your blood all over my warehouse floor. You know how long it takes for that to get out? It’s not good for business.”
“Pietro,” he murmured. “This is the third time this year you’ve been sent to the office. You need to find a better outlet, kid.”
Tony always knew he wouldn’t make it to an old age. While Tony had never made a full on commitment to any mob, he had done a few ‘consultations’ here and there. The whole, ‘I scratch your back if your scratch mine’ kind of deal. Tony makes a few improvements on weapons or even gives away a few whispers of information in exchange for street protection for him and his people.
“Of course. Come on, grab his other arm.” Both Tony and Barnes reached down, grabbing Steve by each of his arms.
Thanks to all who have waited patiently and who are still along for the ride. And as always, I'd love to hear and feedback, what you like/don't like, questions, suggestions, or anything else of the sort.
Upon seeing that Steve was already crouched low to the ground, Sam began to follow, bending his front half down.
Sam sat back in his chair, eyes trained at Steve. Stark took a long swig of the coffee, moaning obscenely as he swallowed. Finally taking in the rest of the room, he rolled his eyes at Steve. "Oh, relax. Take this as a gesture of good faith," he said, revealing the chamber of his gun, which was completely empty.
Tony started to reach for the phone before his body spasmed in protest. Tony’s mouth opened in a silent scream, his gaze turning back to where Pepper had pulled out the entire magnet. The EKG shouted a litany of alarms, both Pepper and Barnes adding in the chorus with their own concerns, but Tony could only focus on Wilson’s mention of Steve.
The Captain rolled his eyes. "HYDRA probably had someone planted there ready to take action if the bomb didn't kill you. We should be safe here. For now."
It was simple really; The Monger knows how Stark operates. With him working with The Captain, they knew that it was only a matter of time before they caught up with Rumlow.
Steve’s response was cut off by the lab doors opening and, a dark blur darting across the room before Tony was gone from his arms, now cradled by a panting Bucky.
“Well,” Steve sighed. “I have to tell Clint about Phil. And I’m not sure it’s a good idea that you be around when I tell him.”
Bucky’s heart was pounding as he watched his options ran out. There was no way that he could let Clint go. He got anywhere near Phil, he’d be taken in for questioning, and then no doubt, once they figured out who he was, arrested soon afterward. It wouldn't matter about evidence - one of New York's officers were shot down in the middle of the street, right in front of the damn precincet. There was no way the boys in blue would rest until they put someone behind bars; and, it's Police Theories: 101 to always start with the significant other. Especially is the significant other is a convicted criminal. But could he leave Coulson here?
Steve looked away sighing, deciding to change the subject. “So do you know what’s gonna happen? Have you done all this before? As me?” Steve gestured around the diner.
The part of the map Steve grabbed must have had the numbers that Rogers had shown him. “Those numbers mean anything to you?”
Pierce tried to feign disinterest, but Loki’s piercing gaze had him realizing that he wasn’t fooling anyone. “You’ve got a lot of nerve showing up here,” was all Pierce said in response.
Steve’s car turned the last corner before be pulled up in front of the small church. He hoped out quickly, sprinting up the steeple steps. Busting through the main doors, Steve almost ran into Sam. “Hey, is the night still young?” Steve tried to joke.
“Oh my god, you’re adorable. Is this how you asked everyone else to join your super-secret boy band?”
Steve snorted despite himself, his hand wiping away at his nose as he stifled. “We’re in a real mess, Buck.”
Steve startled from his dream, almost falling right out of the hospital chair. His chest tightened, the throbbing as painful as if he was still stuck in his scrawny body, unable to protect himself.
“Barton first,” Stark grumbled. “I can’t take any more of his bitching,” he continued. Steve stared in disbelief back down at the brunette, but let Bruce head over to Barton. He could hear Bruce’s disappointed huff as he dressed Clint’s wound, but Steve only had eyes for Stark.
Thor Odinson was the heir to probably one of the biggest energy companies in the world, Asgard. Thor’s family, who started the company in some small town in Norway, had managed to transform it into one of the largest the world had ever seen. Their tech brought the world into a new era of cheap and efficient electricity, not to mention the groundbreaking work they've started on green energy.
But Stark was also right. Steve didn't tell anyone but his crew; no one should have known about them meeting.
“That’s the mystery. There are no pictures of him, if it even is a him. There are only whispers of a red and gold suit in the sky. There are stories. How he has no heart; his lover tried to kill him, but it went wrong. Killed the lover instead, moved away in solitude, shit like that. He went insane. First thing he did was start closing loops. All of them.”
Good news is that since Carrier is done, this story has my full attention. Finally time to finish this mammoth!
Bucky followed Steve’s eyeline, looking at the tall windows in front of them, mostly shot out from the onslaught of bullets. “You serious?”
“What the hell is going on here?” Sam called over, wedging himself between the two men that seemed close to blows.
Of course, accidents happen, and the pair had found themselves ‘starting over’ way too often then they had liked. Now, it just seemed like it was part of the drill, both of them waiting for the other ball to drop and they’ll have to pick everything back up and try again.
All Pierce needed to do was stir the pot a little more. His men would wait for The Captain to leave base, and then Pierce would blow it to smithereens. Some Commandos would be lost, of course, but all for a good cause. The Captain would blame it on Stark, bringing the two back to blows again. Then, all Pierce had to do was to sit back, let the two trade punches until they both slipped up, and he would come in for the kill.
Tony chastised himself; it’s not like he was much better. If anything, he had still fallen way father than Barnes. Tony looked down at the stub of his arm closed his eyes.
Thor was in the Natasha’s room regaling her with stories of Asgard. Clint could even hear Steve’s quiet chuckle and Bruce’s small sighs. Somewhere on the floor above them, an ecstatic man was calling the rest of his family telling them that he was finally a dad. But what really did it for Clint was that he could hear their heartbeats. All five of his teammates; their heart pumping blood strongly through their veins.
And then, when he turns around and looks up into vulnerable eyes, Tony takes a step forward. Steve doesn't move, just waiting with those soft blue eyes waiting in anticipation, and he just allows it when Tony reaches up and cups his face.
Steve growls again. It's louder now; more forceful and a little possessive. He wonders what's swimming in Steve's head, and wonders how he can manage to erase every thought from Steve's head aside from him.
"Patch me in, J." He tells his AI, and JARVIS dutifully hacks into the Avengers' communication channel to speak to them directly, "Where am I dropping you, birdbrain?"
Sam clears his throat, raising a hand and waving it in Tony's direction, "I feel like I've been too hard on you."
Steve took one of Tony’s hand and pushed it into his chest. “Come on, Tony. Breathe with me.” Tony felt the slow rise and fall of Steve’s chest, his own body trying to match it.
Steve smiled, open and genuine. He remembered the last real conversation he’d had with him, before everything happened. Steve pulling him into his office to tell him that Phil was still alive. He’d been so mad at Steve, at Tony, at the fucking world. He’d screamed and cried and clawed and kicked. And Steve just sat there and took it like he was his own personal punching bag.
Tony had already filled The Captain in on the extra rumors he had heard as soon as he got there. Tony had explained to the man about how terrified he was, as well as conveyed in every way possible that he wasn’t actually HYDRA. The Captain, the asshole, just laughed at him.
He sucked in a deep breath and forced his legs to slow to a stop. He hadn’t made it more than a few blocks, but he felt as if it had been miles by the way he was taking in fresh air greedily.
Tony rubbed at his forehead, before leaning down to pick up the rest of the photos. For as angry as he was, the last thing he needed was another kicked puppy look from The Captain. Especially if the man would already be furious when Tony showed up for the fight with HYDRA.
“No!” Steve shouted. “You listen to me. It’s not about her. It will never be about Peggy, because I will never love her.”
“Iron Man,” Steve sighed, cursing inwardly as he sounded as lightheaded as he always was when he ran into the fellow hero. The Iron Man armor glinted beautifully in the sun, the red and gold complementing each other, each curve and joint melding together to create the modern masterpiece, centered around the marvel that was the glowing blue arc reactor.
“Uh, yeah. I guess Fury hit his head too hard on something and decided it was a good idea to let Steve and I bunk together.”
Hill raised her gun again, this time pointing at Steve. “I could just kill you now, wiping you and your loop from my problems. But we like to keep it interesting. You’re going to get in the car with me, and I’m going to take you to the doc. We’ll cut you up until you are just a stump of a man when you’re loop finally comes. Then we’ll kill your loop and make sure you end up as nothing but a fucking vegetable.”
"He has to be out there, J. There's no way he was able to wipe himself from the system- unless of course, that person is me. But something tells me that the Captain and I are not on the same educational level."
Before the explosion, JARVIS had been running tracers on devices that accessed the fake Joseph Grant information. Now back in the safety of his own home, Tony had managed to access the data and pull up two more potential HYDRA locations.
Tony pulled back. "Look at me." Steve clenched his eyes shut in response, but eventually relented to Tony's prodding. Looking up at Tony, Steve was reminded of how awful he looked. The parts of his face that wasn't mottled in bruises were pale and drawn, both blood and water drying in his hair.  "Everything that's happened," Tony started, shaking his head slightly. "Everything we've gone through. It was worth it.
Maria dropped her gun, laughing. Tony instantly darted out into Steve’s arms, Steve effectively pushing Tony behind him.
The air between the two men was tense; Stark looked up at Steve with wide eyes, Steve just glaring back at him, as if daring Stark to argue back.
Not even waiting to catch his breath, Steve hopped up behind the crates, the new angle giving him a clean shot on two men that were still after Bucky, who was charging up the far stairway to get to Clint. He took them down easily, watching as Bucky made the last few steps up to the upper catwalk where Clint was. Listening in, Steve could hear a few familiar sounding rounds go off from above, Bucky attempting to clean out the rest of the threats from the second level. Luckily for his men, the catwalk was too covered for anyone to get a clean shot from the main floor, while Steve’s position was less than stellar. Trapping himself downstairs with upwards of seven armed men left may not have been his best plan.
There was a small stretch of silence before the rapid-fire shouting was back, even louder than before. Steve winced at the number of expletives coming over the receiver.
Steve was out of the room in an instant, sprinting towards the car as he heard Hammer cackle behind him. Steve jumped into the driver seat, seeing that Thor and Clint had sidled in with him.
Lo and behold, it was mere seconds before Barnes came charging around the corner they’d just come from, other steps sounding not far behind him. Without a moment’s hesitation, Barton charged around the corner pointing the barrel down at Barnes.
flight response. Steve would never back down from a fight, whether it be against the fiercest of villains, or arguing with Tony over sleep habits. He would always give it his all; Steve never half-assed anything. But, not many people know that afterwards Steve was prone to fleeing into a sulk. A lot of the times it was over civilian casualties, team injuries, sometimes his own behavior. Even with all his strength, even Captain America can’t hold the weight of the world on his shoulders.
“Don’t look at me like that, boy,” Stane snarled. “You know, when I put the hit out on you,” Tony’s heart clenched at the confirmation, “I was worried that I was killing the golden goose.” Obidiah leaned over him, his bulking frame menacing. He grabbed at Tony’s shirt and ripped it down the middle, the light of his arc reactor illuminating their faces.
“Clint, I wouldn’t be asking if it wasn’t serious. When I mentioned them to Stark, even he seemed worried. All I need you to do is ask if he’s heard anything.”
The dinner was quite, but that was hardly surprising, the team winding down after a long mission. A chirp from Tony’s tablet was enough to get the brunette’s attention, dragging him away from the team. Steve let him go with a small frown, only partially satisfied with the amount of food Tony managed to consume.
“Why are you looking at me?" Pierce shouted back at him. "If you had ever done your job correctly, Stark would have been finished off years ago.”
"But-but that wasn't me!" Loki cried, jumping up to rush to the bars separating them. "It couldn't have been. I was still escaping The Commandos' compound!"
Tony snorted, reaching in his back pocket before chucking her a phone. She unlocked the home screen and went immediately to the contacts tab, smiling at the seven names that stared back up at here. Her finger traced James’s name that sat at the top of the list.
“How many times do I have to tell you, Barton,” Sparky sighed, lip curled in displeasure. “That’s not my name. It’s Agent Crispell.”
“I need you to call Bucky,” Steve replied, not bothering to respond. “Get him and Tony home, and then go and sober Clint up. We’ve got a problem.”
Fury shrugged. “Even criminals need to pass the time. And considering how much he seems to enjoy the show, I highly doubt he’ll stop listening on account of murder charges. Especially since he has anonymity on his side. Even if he listens, it will be like finding a needle in a haystack made of other needles.”
Tony balled his hands into fists but refused to respond. The last thing he needed was a bullet to the head.
“That’s because you’ve been awake too long.” Tony stood up before manhandling Steve over to the couch. He snapped his fingers and pointed down at the cushions. “Sleep,” he said firmly.
“You,” Stark retorted, pointing at Nat, “are going to go back out to your sources. Tell them you caught wind of some Stark weapons that didn't get loaded for shipment at this location.” The brunette dipped a hand in his suit before slipping a piece of paper across the table to Natasha.
Tony jerked away, galking at his CFO for not backing him up. The balding man just stared back, and Tony could almost hear the look say,
“Delete,” Tony responded. He could deal with this. All he had to do was distract Obie with a new design and the man would back off for at least a couple of months.
Tony could feel his heart threatening to thud out of his chest, the blood rushing through his veins a dull roar in in his ears. “You confessed,” he finally grit out.
Yinsen nodded, already typing on the computer. A large boom came from the other side of the door, sending it caving in, furniture flying everywhere. Tony pushed Yinsen behind him, arms raised. Two armed guards stormed into the room, one prepped with another grenade.
Steve shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “Yes. It’s where we’ve been basing our operations recently.”
Maybe it was the craftsmanship; how Tony had slaved over that arm to create such a work of art. Hell, sometimes it just looked like an arm that was just painted silver. Besides, seeing the surprised joy that crossed Bucky’s face when he could hold a gun again would be enough to warm Steve’s heart for decades. It was just another thing that Steve owed Tony; for bringing his best friend back.
But, hey! Look! New characters! Take this as a distraction from how much a salty move that cliffhanger/three week long break was. (If you can't tell, this is me trying to get back into your good graces. I'm a terrible baker, so I can't offer comfort food... this will have to do.)
He could see Tony smirk, no doubt in triumph. “Good. Now then, wipe that frown off your face. Tonight’s a special night.”
Steve jerked, his body moving to cover Tony immediately. He reached for the handgun he had stashed in his belt, whipping it and his arm around to aim at the intruder with a snarl.
Steve glared back. “Is it too much to ask to not have knives where I sleep? I thought we agreed no weapons in the bed.”
He watched The Captain roll his eyes dramatically before running a strong hand through his gold locks.
Tony narrowed his eyes, his brow furrowing. “Course not. You provided the information on Pierce in return for our safety.”
It had been a legitimate concern they had when they first brought Steve back after rescuing him in that burnt out building. In their defense, the last time a bomb had went off, Steve made some less than ideal decisions, ending up with them in the middle of a shitstorm with Thor's brother and Steve freezing in the bottom of a river. But it wasn't anything like last time.
The Captain took off down the street, moving at an unreal pace. He flew through the back alleys, seemingly unfazed by Tony's struggling. He finally stopped when he reached aged building, a business long forgotten about. Kicking down the door easily, The Captain moved quickly inside, moving through the tight hallway and to the main floor. Apparently pleased with his surroundings, he deposited Tony roughly on the floor.
“All of the locations of the file drops are still at the speakeasy. They haven’t been tampered with, and no one outside of us had access to them, and yet somehow,” he trailed off, gesturing to the empty room in front of them.
Steve barely had time to react. He heard Tony shout an expletive before the man was jumping in front of Steve as the bomb exploded. A burst of heat had both him and Tony flying to the floor, and then there was nothing.
“I assumed so,” Fury responded. “Because of that fact, while the SSR had collected a multitude of secrets, more than enough to keep the government happy, it’s not exactly up to date. I’m sure it doesn’t mention have most of your current employees, or you for that matter,” he added, pointing to Tony.
Tony flopped his head down against Steve’s chest, his fingers fumbling as they played with a corner of the sheet. There were way too many miles between Kansas and South Carolina. Tony swallowed around the building fear that was threatening to spill over. “Sounds boring,” he opted to say instead.
“No, you don’t get to do that,” Rhodes snapped, pressing a finger into Steve’s chest. “You can’t talk about him like a long lost friend. From what I gathered here, your relationship with him is nothing but destructive. I shouldn’t let you anywhere near Tony!”
deal,” Steve growled, grabbing the club out of Clint’s hands. “I do not wanna get a call that you’ve been arrested for public indecency.”
Steve nodded, hopping up to his feet, placing a hand down to help the other man to his feet. “Well then, we better get cracking. We only have until Friday before you join us on the wanted list for desertion.”
Tony scoffed. “Or what, you’re gonna kill me? Please. If you wanted me dead, all you had to do was snap your fingers. You wouldn’t go through all this trouble.”
Not that it’s any sweat of Tony’s back. He didn’t need The Captain. He didn’t need them. Tony would do it himself.
“He basically confessed to me yesterday,” Tony confided. “He’s dealing my weapons under the table, giving them out like candy to the monsters under our beds. Obie’s good, but not better than me. He’d have left a trail. And I can find it to you. And,” he added, “if that’s not enough, I will sign whatever form you want, giving you full permission to sweep through SI’s internal servers.”
Steve sighed and headed out the door, only stopping when he ran into Bucky. “Go with Thor and dump that trash in the street,” he commanded, nodding to where Thor was carrying Hammer's half-dead man up the stairs.
Bucky shook his head, eyes not leaving where they were loading Steve on a stretcher. “I’m not going anywhere without him.”
“I think I’d like that,” Tony answered, brushing his lips against Steve’s. “But I think I have a better idea for a date.”
for the scones,” Tony scoffed, smacking Steve on the shoulder. “I just thought you guys might want a place for yourselves.”
Tony knew The Captain and his Howling Commandos were no laughing matter. Tony had never personally run into them, and he hoped to keep it that way. When The Captain first showed up on the radar, no one took him seriously. B-list mobsters are always popping up, trying to make a name for themselves, only to land behind bars. But somehow, he and his ragtag groupies had risen through the ranks, claiming Brooklyn for their own.
“It means that the FBI is interested in what’s happening between The Commandos and HYDRA. And we know a lot more about it than Phil sure did.”
return. But here he was, still sitting at Steve's table, returning to help clean up his mess anyway. “My brother is wilier than all of us combined," Thor spoke. "I cannot begin to fathom the acts that he’s done," he added, nodding at Steve, "but believe me when I tell you that I’m nowhere closer to getting my hands on him than you are.”
The shots got the attention of the other agents in the building, but Rogers was prepared. Camping out behind a desk, Rogers effectively mowed through the remaining SHIELD agents.
Phil hummed, shifting around in the bed, trying to get more comfortable. The drugs were seemingly wearing off if the dull throbbing that had bloomed against his side was any indication. “Maybe I wrote one too many parking tickets.”
It wasn’t long before Tony was panting, letting out the occasional soft cry as Steve’s hand twisted right where he wanted. “You’re doing so well,” Steve murmured. “God, you look so beautiful right now, you don’t even know.” Tony felt a flush bloom on his cheeks in response. “I’m going to try for three now, alright?”
He set up shop in lower Manhattan. Corruption was like currency there, more than enough for him to keep busy. To keep exposing.
He should have known better, honestly. It was the same tactic that he had started with as well. But he'd relaxed, and let himself drift down a new path, following the tantalizing bread crumbs The Commandos left as they trailed ahead of him. The slightest glimmer of a different life, a new beginning. A chance of being part of something bigger.
Steve had given up on the concept pretty quickly but found himself whittling in the corner of Tony’s room, waiting for the man to wake up. Maybe he just needed something to do with his hands, something to distract him from Tony’s injuries, or the Ten Ring members Bucky was hiding in the basement.
The pair strolled around the club until they reached the back. Steve tapped on the rear door, giving a two finger salute to the camera watching them.
“He never came back for it,” whispered Tony. The aftermath of the past mission was chaotic. Everyone was so frantic to get Tony and Steve medical attention, things just got overlooked. Natasha had said that Clint ran off to get his quinjet when Tony and Steve were being loaded on to the stretchers. Or so she thought. Everyone had just assumed that he went back for it and taken it back to the farm; back to Laura and his family.
Clint flipped Tony the bird. “I’ll have you know that I played golf all the time in my youth,” he said, taking the club out and fiddling with the cap on the end of the club. He held it right up to his crotch, eyebrows raising. “It was the easiest way to get cash,” Clint continued, now pulling out the modesty apron and tying it around his waist. “Hustling pool was for chumps, but golf? There’s always rich folk playing golf. Wanna know how long my drive is?”
They were worth listening to Mrs. Barkley’s griping, smelling Mr. Well’s spoiled meals, watching Emily growing up knowing she’d never be hers. Natasha thought of the other shaving kit, most likely still laying in James’s bathroom at the speakeasy.
“It’s great,” Bucky interjected, fingers curling protectively around the small device. “Really, it is.”
Tony came back to himself when he felt someone pulling at his suit. He turned to face The Captain once more.
“Tony,” Steve replied easily. “Come on, take a break. I was thinking we could take Peter out for lunch.”
The first meeting was the info dump, as Tony liked to call it. They went over everything they saw from their position, discussed flaws that happened in the field, and sent any relevant information to their intel group. Then, they would reconvene the next week to review everything that was discussed, correct any issues, talk about next steps.
There was a flash of emotion over Clint’s face, but it was gone as soon as it appeared, the man resorting to nodding numbly.
The SSR was not something he could ever envision himself being a part of growing up. But it was only a matter of weeks before Steve realized that he couldn’t envision his life with it. Without them.
he hissed, staring into the kitchen camera. The icebox shut off with a small whir, the kitchen descending into silence again. Tony clenched his hands into fists, ready to deliver another angry barb, when he finally heard it.
Bucky should have known that being in front of the police station meant that there were going to be cops littering the street. While most were standing over Coulson, some had caught on to the scene that Clint was currently creating.
Obie walked around Tony’s desk to clasp his shoulder, his large head leaning in close. “But it’s not enough anymore. Our stock points are still dropping, Tony. We need to do something about this.”
His response only caused Stark to grin wider. “Ooh, I like you. Can I keep him?” Stark looked to his left, staring at Steve, who had been failing to hide his annoyed face in his hands. Clint frowned, narrowing his eyes at the outsider. Being his first real conversation with the man, it was going just as well as he thought it would. In the weeks since the birth of their tentative work relationship, Steve had handled most of the interactions with Stark. It was difficult letting Steve walk about and about with HYDRA's ranks rising, but Clint knew that the only reason Steve agreed to keep having these outside meetings was to keep Stark away from the family. Considering the last two times Stark visited ended with him pointing a gun at Wilson and a dead body, Clint agreed with him. Meeting outside the base, of course. Meeting and dealing with Stark in general? Now that, Clint had a few opinions on.
to attack one of his warehouses, Stark Industries having recently purchased a few new ones for manufacturing storage. While the warehouse itself wasn’t operational yet, Tony had a meeting last week with some contractors to see the progress. The Captain would, or so he had promised, show up, shoot some bullets, break some windows, throw around some threats. The usual. The contractors would see The Captain’s response, more rumors would spread, and boom. Tony Stark and The Hollowing Commandos would be at war.
He sighed, feeling his body going limp. The tension was gone, the ice retreating from his veins. He drifted, finally floating instead of sinking. He wasn’t cold.
“Just give me one chance!” Schmidt pleaded as he ran back toward the window. “I’ll go get the police!”
Unfortunately for Steve, laughing as he licked his way into Tony’s mouth, it was the beginning of the end.
Steve loved it. The lab was so unbelievably Tony. It stuck out like such a sore thumb compared to the rest of the building, but Steve couldn’t imagine the speakeasy without it. It was just like Tony, standing tall next to The Commandos.
“And why do we own these buildings on said street?” Bucky asked, looking up at their new purchases. “I mean, Steve and I could just paint and cook at the tower.”
I might add. The whole witness protection thing is bullshit. How much longer can you claim to be cleaning up lose ends? Please, we all know that you’re just keeping us out here because you can’t throw us in prison.”
When Steve finally pulled the covers away and slipped out of the bed, Tony couldn’t follow, the lingering cold that was left in his wake too encompassing to escape. Steve had to reach back down for him, gentle hands helping him stand. A final kiss was pressed against his head and Steve was moving again, over to their clothes.
Tony huffed out a hollow laugh. “Always the politician. I knew you’d be back later. It’s a miracle you came back at all.”
Two two pulled into a crowded lot, parking Steve's bike, and walking towards the club. Steve glared over at Bucky, only to groan. “Oh come on, don’t do that here.” To his left, Bucky was smiling down into hand, watching himself levitate a quarter.
“No, I don’t want to hear excuses. You were too caught up in downing more HYDRA agents than Thor, you couldn’t even be bothered to be there for your own teammate. Natasha could have died, Clint!”
“Time to go,” Steve snapped, not wasting another second as he grabbed Sam’s shoulder, yanking him towards the back exit.
“Of course not. I’m just admitting that I’m smarter than you.” Tony silently preened when he saw Fury clench his jaw.
Quite a find, according to him. He said his men were out on a simple drug bust when they managed to find them.”
“Thank you.” It was said so quietly, quiet enough that Steve had to think for a second to make sure he didn’t make it up.
He stomped into the kitchen, throwing the broken plate and ruined meal onto the island in front of him, his gaze returning to the newspaper.
The second explosion had been right under the first, which could have caused big structural problems. Tony could have gotten been sucked in by the collapsing floor, or gotten caught under falling debris. Clint shuddered at the possibilities.
He could argue that Tony didn’t trust him, that he made a decision for the entire group and tossed Coulson aside. But he could also argue that decision was made for the safety of the majority of the family.
“You sound surprised,” said Yinsen, leaning back to look at his work. “Who do you think pulled the shrapnel out of your chest?”
“Steve, what the hell?!” Sam cried, but Steve just reared up again, sending two quick punches before pushing his whole weight against the door, finally feeling the panes give way. Steve was sent crashing to the ground, shards biting into his exposed skin.
Tony thread their fingers together. "Listen to me. This isn't last time. I'm not going anywhere; I'm not leaving your side. You need more? Know that I'm just as invested as you are, Steve. I've never had this before, either. Just know that I'm here, with you, right now. And I don't plan on going anywhere."
Steve had lost count of how many times an apparent rescue of a pet has gone south. Turns out the wholesome Captain America wasn’t good with animals. No matter how many times he tried, Steve always managed to come home with more scrapes from a house pet then a day long escapade with Doom. Unbelievable, really.
His mother wore the same tearful face when he told her he was joining the Air Force. He could see her pride, but it was only a mask, to hide the lingering fear of
The Captain huffed out a breath. “We’ve heard a few rumors. Not a lot, just a tip here and there, but it was enough to… catch my curiosity.”
“Done deal,” Tony agreed, looking back to the pile in front of his before grabbing an empty sheet of paper, starting to scribble Steve’s final secrets out.
Steve almost wished that Tony wasn't as smart as he was; turns out Tony being the best and the brightest on multiple subjects was causing them nothing but problems.
“Maybe now isn’t the best time,” Bucky said, even though he got up and started dressing as well. “We just woke up and we’re not all here, and- ”
“No, no, that ship sailed a long time ago,” Tony laughed. “I’ve just never, you know…” he trailed off, gesturing at how they were positioned.
With the decisions I've made in the past month, its a miracle that anyone ever thought that I could lead them. I mean, HYDRA almost killed you, Buck! I got our home destroyed, I got us loved with Loki, I gave out SSR secrets! And was that enough? No. No, now I gave them my name."
Ward shifted on his feet uneasily. “I’m not sure, Sir. Maybe there was just a typo when it printed.”
Outside, he could already hear the rest of the neighborhood waking up, rising with the sun. It wouldn’t be long before the street was filled with the buzz of lawnmowers and the screaming laughter of children.
Tony tensed in his arms, but nodded softly. No other words were spoken, just their breathing which had easily synced back up with one another. It wasn’t long before Tony’s breaths evened out again, the man pulled back out of consciousness.
“Get your shit together,” Fury added. “I’ve dealt with children more mature than you.” With a final shake of his head, the screen darkened, disconnected by their frustrated boss.
Tony shot another death glare at Sitwell before snatching Pietro’s hand, tugging him out of the office, the teacher’s accusations following them out into the hallway. Tony said nothing as he led Pietro out of the school and over to their car. Once Pietro had buckled in, Tony leaned forward, bracing his head against the steering wheel.
Tony thought. Fury was just hoping that he could keep them caged long enough to break them, killing two birds with one stone. The rest of the team would make it; their lifestyle required them to start a new identity at the drop of a hat. But Tony? Ever since making the agreement with Tony, he couldn’t help but think about going back to the life he used to lead. How he once thought that he had everything that he ever wanted – now, Tony saw that he had nothing. And that’s what he’d go back too.
Tony curled himself over Steve’s chest, sticking his face into Steve’s neck. There were no words spoken, just their gasps and guttural moans. It was too much, they were too desperate. They wouldn’t last long at this rate.
Reaching the top of the stairs, Steve saw Thor and some of his men flank the rest of Hammer’s men, getting them away from Bucky, who was leaning over Clint. Steve tried to run to them, but Stark pulled him back. “Barton’s fine. Finish this first.” Steve glared at the other man, but found himself shooting alongside Stark anyway.
Steve watched as the robber’s car pull the same turn he did, the blonde seeing his window of opportunity get smaller. With one more harsh thrust, Steve sent the cat flying out of the tree and right into its owner’s hands before flipping the tree in the road on the other side of him.
Tony started to manually find the clasps to take off his suit. He stopped however, when he realized that the lower half of his body was stuck under some fallen ceiling.
“Oh my God,” Bucky whispered, gasping when the rubble started to let out tiny squeaks, three pairs of eyes looking back at theirs. “Kittens?”
Steve snorted, smiling slightly as he reached out to grab Tony by the hips, pulling the smaller man in between his legs, sighing as he felt Tony curl around him, calloused hands rubbing gently through his hair and down his back.
“Bold words coming from a man of your recent actions,” Tony snarked back, Steve shooting him the finger, but dutifully hunkering further down in his bed.
The steady beeping of the monitors Tony was set up to was a welcome annoyance. Anything to prove that Tony was alive and well, his heart beating as stubbornly as ever.
“Steve!” Bucky cried, pulling away from his to aim his own weapon that he’d taken off of Campbell’s body. He fired wildly, causing Zola to retreat. Steve took the chance to crawl over to the back corner, hiding behind a stack of crated files.
Clint was missing. Base was bombed. Stark Industries was bombed. Tony’s status was unknown. Inside the quinjet alone, Steve was plagued by voices in his head, asking ‘
“I’m keeping an eye on him, don’t worry,” Barnes interrupted. “It’s just… he needs this right now. It wasn’t exactly easy for him, for any of us, when you were gone. And don’t,” he continued, barring Tony’s attempt to speak. “Don’t apologize. What happened to you is on the rest of us.”
So logically, it shouldn't surprise him that Steve and Tony would end up together. Stark, having lived in the public eye his whole life, has had his romantic preferences out in the open for a long time. Both men were objectionably attractive with similar backgrounds; adrenaline junkies with sordid pasts a knack for guns and had criminalistic hobbies - which, now that he thinks about it, checks off a lot of boxes on his own list. To a third party, the pair of them falling into bed together just made sense.
"Darling, you should really do something about that cheek. It would be a shame if I caused some permanent damage to that pretty face of yours."
“You’re lucky I like you, Banner,” Tony grumbled, preening when Bucky filled another mug and handled it to him.
“Shit, shit, shit,” Tony whispered to himself as he jammed the key into the ignition. He could hear The Captain yelling at Barnes to get in the car. Tony saw the two men run towards their own car in his side mirror as he started to pull away.
Steve, who had taken a seat behind his desk, reached for the gun that lay atop it, turning it to aim at Clint. The smile vanished instantly from Barton's face, the man quickly scrambling to take cover behind Bucky.
“Yes, he will,” Barnes countered. “Whenever Steve pushed in one direction you pushed harder in the other. You two could find a reason to argue about anything. I need you to go back there and tell him that he’s wrong and he’s being stupid. Because even though he doesn’t always see it your way, he’ll always stopped and listened.”
“Because believe it or not, Mr. Stark, there are rules in the justice system. I can’t just have someone meet him in a dark alley to take care of the problem,” Fury responded, before turning to look at Steve. “That is how you have Barnes do it, right?”
“I’m on a fixed income,” she sobbed. “And if you can’t help me, I don’t know what I’ll do,” she broke off, sobbing into an already damp handkerchief.
Sorry for the short chapter, but it was definitely needed to set up the next sequence of events. Enjoy!
Clint looked down at the half eaten meal in his hands. “I’ve never been to Norway,” he mumbled. “I hear it’s beautiful.”
Tony just pulled away, gliding down the few steps from the podium. With a final glance at Steve, he could see the blonde jerk his head to the right, mouthing ‘
“If I thought the news could wait, then I wouldn’t have barged in," the foreigner replied, voice shaking. "But this is urgent. I just got off the phone with the police.”
"You wish," Stane laughed in response. "After what you did, you should count yourself lucky Pierce's men got to you before I let you bleed out in some alleyway."
Steve must have heard him, because he answered, “Yeah, Sam,” arms tightening their hold. He knew that the rest of them would be fine, he just
Pierce tugged away, hands gently pressing down at his now wrinkled suit. “Well, I’m not going to say no.”
“Neither do I,” Steve chuckled, breaking out into a grin, one that was echoed by Tony. “I don’t remember. I honestly don’t remember a time where I didn’t love you. Even when I think back to us on that Helicarrier, all I can remember is wondering whether your lips would taste like blueberries.”
“He’s not going to prison, and he’s not dead,” Clint stated, as if to remind himself. “I’ll take what I can get right now. I always wanted him to get out of this type of life, but I guess I should have been more careful of what I wished for, huh?”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Just thought that you might want an untraceable phone. You know, in case you want to make some illicit calls to some illicit folks.”
“Tony,” Rhodes breathed out before the two of them were running again, tearing down the tunnel. Steve didn’t hold back any longer, screaming Tony’s name, listening to his voice echo through the sewer. It caught some attention, yes, but it was dealt with before it could even think to become a problem. He and Rhodes cut through the men efficiently, not stopping for anything.
Steve finally pulled back, taking deep breaths to stop the few tears that threatened to slip down his cheek. “It’s good to see you, Shellhead,” Steve chuckled. Tony couldn’t help but drop his head into Steve’s chest, giggles sneaking out of his lips.
Tony wanted the same thing, in his own way. Something real, something meaningful to wake up to every morning. And maybe the reason that he’s only now having this realization is because he’s finally found his place. A place where he can see himself adding his own chair to the mix.
“I lost them all,” Steve moaned. “The SSR, your family. I lost Peggy. I almost lost you and Bucky already. Phil’s gone, half our crew left, Clint’s not all here anymore.
“Yeah,” Steve agreed. “One that I thought I never wanted. But somehow I can still dream about it with you.”
Silence then echoed through the halls, followed by a sharp hiss from Tony. “No, absolutely not. I made a deal with Fury, I’m not dropping them.”
What he wasn’t expecting was for Tony to sit back down next to Steve handing him the tablet. “JARVIS finished decrypting,” he whispered, shooting Steve a heavy look.
Strong arms engulfed him, pressing him into Steve’s chest. He shushed Tony, rubbing his hand along Tony’s back, kissing his forehead gently. He could even feel Barnes rest a metal hand against his shoulder. “Of course we believe you,” Steve soothed. “Jesus, Tony, I’m so sorry.”
“Limbo. Atheist who is basically just a delusional pyro. He’s been moonlighting as the mailman for a few months. I told him where’s Starks office was, and then, well you know what happened.”
“Shh,” Tony hushed again. “Sorry, sweetpea, but you’ve lost this one. Nothing you can say or do is gonna get me to leave. I’ll handcuff myself to the kitchen table if necessary.”
“Relax, Cap. Besides, you don’t want to see anything on there. Natasha dumped all of SHIELD and HYDRA’s files on the internet. The media’s tearing you guys apart.”
Sprinting back up the large iron gates of the cemetery, Tony breathed a sigh of relief when he was met with a lack of cars and commotion. He crossed the grassy field, blatantly ignoring the graves he was running over, dipping inside the maintenance hut.
“You need to get out of here. You need to leave. I can’t have you going around blowing my cover. Come on.”
“Do you know the first time I realized I loved you?” Steve asked quietly, rubbing his fingers gently through Tony’s hair.
Steve let himself be pushed down, his body on fire where Tony touched his bare skin. But he needed more. Reaching back up, Steve grabbed Tony’s shirt, Tony letting out a growl when he felt the fabric rip.
Steve groaned, his head pounding as his eyes fluttered open. He tried to move around, only to find himself zip-tied to a chair. Even his feet were secure against the legs of the chair. The last thing he remembered was the assault, and Tony was there, and then- Steve winced as he remembered the pipe that had come down on his head. Steve could only pray that Tony had fled while he had the chance, going for backup.
Steve clenched his jaw. “We’ve got over thirty people working on this and you’re telling me all we have is some half assed conspiracy theory?”
he thought to himself. He reached into his picket, feeling the three small orbs that sat there. Hill and the other agents hopped out the van, Steve and Bucky following suit.
Steve frowned down at the radio that was resting on the dash of the car. Steve had gotten it months ago, begging Sam to let him keep it in his car for fear of Tony finding it. Every Wednesday, they’d pile into Sam’s car and wait, listening for the city’s calls of distress.
Sure, Tony had enemies, but no one had ever done this. No one had ever dared too. They knew who Tony was, what he would do if they tried to attack him. No one would be crazy enough to do it.
"You wanted me to keep you warm." The blond says, and Steve's breath is hot as it fans across his face. Tony hates how his body reacts to just that alone, but doesn't struggle even when a part of his brain tells him he should.
"I want you." Wanda continues, and she's managed to get closer to Tony without Steve even realizing it.
"It felt good to sleep in a bed. I'm sure it was the same for you." Tony replies, matching her knowing look with one of his own.
Steve catches Natasha's eyes and they share a look. Tony would either love this guy or completely hate the way they were both so similar. And then he catches himself and shakes his head because Tony isn't the Tony he remembers being friends with. He can still hear the brunet's words echoing in his ear.
It's been a few weeks since he'd come home following the Mandarin; and in that time, Tony's been preoccupied. Between working at his company, moving all of things out of his penthouse and opening it up to the Avengers for their base of operations, and training to be a part of their team if only to reassure Steve that he'll no longer make reckless decisions on his own, this little reprieve is overwhelming at best.
"Goddammit, Tony, I never wanted to kill you and I'd never want you dead." His words are heavy with emotion as he pinches the bridge of his nose. Tears are building, stinging the back of his eyes; but he won't cry. He would never cry in front of a team that expects him to be strong on their behalf.
"Are you ready for me?" Steve asks against his neck, licking a stripe across his Adam's apple that shoots another thrill of pleasure down his span.
"We don't want him to rise to the bait, but he's been working on designing a weapon for him," Bruce concludes, and though they all see James's growing discomfort, he has the right to know all of this.
"You don't have to talk about it, Steve." He tells the blond, pulling back just slightly to press a kiss to the side of Steve's head, "But I promise, no one's going to hurt you. I'll protect you."
"Home?" For a second, he looks like a lost child, unsure of his place in the world. He turns his head just slightly, his gaze trailing over the Iron Patriot armor longingly, "There's no home without him."
"Here." Steve confirms, raising his head just enough to press a kiss to the side of Tony's forehead. His lips are gentle, the heat that radiates from them causing for Tony's own skin to flush. Steve's very fond of giving forehead kisses, and Tony's never been on the receiving end of them until meeting the blond.
"Thanks for the assist." Captain America breathes, and Tony loosens his grip. The Captain tumbles out of his grip, returning to the ground with a tumble. Damn super soldiers and their impervious bodies, really.
They eat together in silence, judged by monks and surveyed by Stephen who had yet to have any sort of joy in having them there; but still, wasn’t this better than the alternative? Of being chased down by a man who they had fought together and against for years?
"Aren't you here because Obadiah called to threaten him?" Natasha asks now, and she has a hand on James's shoulder, her long fingernails curled into his shirt.
"I didn't come looking for you because of what Strange said." Steve shoots back, his tone certain and leaving no room for disagreement, "I was scared, Tony. I was scared and that's why I didn't come looking for you back then but - but the moment you came into that compound - the moment I thought I lost you for good? God. That angry, hateful
"Sorry, Mr. Stark. We just assumed it was okay to use whatever was in the house." The man has a hand out towards him, polite and gentle in a way Tony really wasn't expecting, "I'm Bruce. Bruce Banner."
That gives Tony another reason to pause, and before Steve gets too far out of his reach, he cups the blond's face and pulls him in for a kiss. Tony hopes Steve can read the
Surprisingly, Bucky's not there. Steve is, curled up on the armchair with a lengthy novel in his hands, brows furrowed and entirely enraptured by whatever he's reading. Tony's heart skips a beat. He's always been told that when he's in focus on something, there's something artistic about him. Likewise, Steve is like a life-sized portrait that looks almost too beautiful to be real.
"Lift your hips." Tony tells him, and there's a dangerous glint in Steve's eyes as he realizes what Tony is attempting.
Steve represses the sigh that desperately wants to be released, taking his seat once more without even looking at the rest of the team, "It's about time we decide what we do regarding Wanda."
Tony's silent for too long, his personality considered. Clint and Natasha hang back with Steve in wait, holding their breaths because their thoughts are mirroring his. Tony pushes both Natasha and Steve away, climbing unsteadily to his feet with the Iron Patriot still gripped tightly in his arms, and steps in the direction of the portal.
"I'll order pizza while you're in there." Steve calls out, his voice a little rough and hazy. Tony's stomach growls at the mention of food, and the rest of their night is peaceful.
"You got a death wish?" Hawkeye asks as he joins the pair on the street. The rest of the team joins them, and side from cuts and scrapes, it looks like they're all uninjured.
He opens it, pleasantly surprised that it's fully charged. He opens the contact list, hoping there are some clues as to who he's supposed to be contacting and finds a few familiar names:
After following an angry Wanda out the last time they'd all been together, he'd trailed after her for hours while her anger built. He was waiting for a moment to broach the subject of helping Tony, like he'd told Steve he would do, but never had the chance. She ambushed him, manipulating the lingering feelings of affection Vision had for her against him. A fight ensued, Wanda tried to pry the stone out of his head, and he phased away, fleeing to regroup and gather himself.
"I thought I'd never see you again." Steve breathes, and he shakes his head like the very idea of it is too painful, "Even if you're Iron Man, Tony; you're human. You should've
Tony releases the mark, running his tongue over it and slowly shifting back in Steve's lap to look up at the blond. Steve's blue eyes are blown wide, his chest still heaving from the thrill of it. He runs his tongue along his swollen lips, and Tony's eyes focus on it like he's never seen anything more captivating. When his eyes turn back up to Steve's, there's a question dancing in his gaze. Tony knows what it is even without being asked, and though he once told himself he never would, he tilts his head and leans closer.
"Don't give me that look, Steve." Tony sighs, and he's no longer fidgeting with the toolkit at all. His hands are pressed onto the surface of the workbench, and his fingers are shaking.
A mere second later, Steve's arms snap forward. One hand lands on the back of Tony's head, fingers curled tightly into the hair on his nape and pulling Tony's head to angle him closer. The other hand is pressed to the small of Tony's back, pulling him impossibly closer like they're supposed to be one person rather than two.
She turns to Tony again, and there's a little dangerous spark in her eye as she smirks, "You blame us for it; but in the end, James is dead because of you."
"Go get your shield, Steve." Tony tells him, and his voice is weak but if his faceplate were up, Steve would see the flicker of amusement dancing in his gaze, "You look pathetic fighting without it."
"We decided to take a break before I left for Malibu." Tony tells her with a long sigh, and at times like this, he finds himself wondering why Pepper had removed the minibar from the office.
"Okay, no. I need a shot of this, too." Rhodey's gleeful voice trails off, and the sound of the camera's shutter is all that's heard as Steve leads him from the kitchen to his old room.
And if that's not chilling enough, Vision stands and floats away, phasing through the wall of the Sanctum and leaving their objections behind.
"Here is the problem." Stephen explains as he gets up from the chair, "If we are to save Tony Stark, we will lose Wanda Maximoff in the process. If we are to save Wanda Maximoff, we lose Tony Stark and the universe."
"What would we even agree on watching together?" Bruce asks with a scoff of amusement, and he's waving a strip of bacon in the air.
"What's so funny?" Steve asks, and he stills his hand as he does so. His head pulls back just slightly, lips trailing up to the spot behind Tony's ear. That spot is specifically sensitive, and Steve knows it.
"What are you doing?" Steve demands, and he can hear the panic in his voice as he tries to tighten his grip around the brunet. Serum or not, the man was just stabbed for crying out loud.
Tony turns to them, and his smile is wide and sharp like he's been waiting for them to ask just that, "What's the fun in killing you there where you'd be unknown when I can kill it while you're on American soil?"
"What do you mean you can't eat all of that on your own?" Steve asks, his voice full of disbelief and amusement, even though he obliges and takes the empty seat, "This is a full meal for an adult, and you skipped breakfast."
And then, one night, Tony's dislodged from his dreams about waking up in Afghanistan to a stranger's hand in his chest cavity to the sound of a scream. At first, he thinks it's him screaming, tossing a hand over his mouth to try and subdue the tremors of his body. But when the screams don't fade, he forces himself upright. The scream is coming from the living room, he realizes, and he crouches on his way out of the room.
Bucky looks at him for a long moment, silent and contemplative. Steve realizes it's the first time in a long time that he's had the chance to speak to just Bucky, alone. Not including the minor argument they got into when Bucky first met Tony, of course.
Smirking, Tony dips back down and takes the tip of Steve's dick into his mouth. He works slowly, teasingly, savoring the taste of Steve in his mouth. He's not too fond of oral, usually; but Steve isn't overly salty and his musky scent is driving Tony wild.
"I will warn you once and only once to stop protecting the murderer." Wanda warns the group, and just for that moment, her eyes drift away from Tony.
The music cuts off suddenly, and Tony's so surprised by it that he lifts his head and bumps his skull against the car's frame. Hissing, he pulls himself out from under the car to glare at his unwelcomed guest. It doesn't hurt enough to tell him he's got a cut, but it sure as hell does sting. When he sees Steve there, holding his food and smiling ever so gently, his anger fizzles out. How he'd forgotten the type of man Steve is is beyond him.
It doesn't take Tony nearly as long to get there, unfortunately. He supposes it's because it's been years since the last time he's been with anyone, but it might just be because of how Steve manages to be everything Tony's ever wanted. Steve's grip is firm around his length, but it's not too rough that it causes pain, and his teeth against the mark he left causes something akin to posessiveness to build in his chest. He's moaning against Steve's shoulders, his own arms wrapped tightly around Steve's torso. He wonders, then, how it would feel to have Steve inside of him. On one hand, Steve was right that they had plenty of time to do more; but on the other hand, Tony wanted all of Steve, right then and there.
"Are these all Howard's?" Bucky asks next, and there's wonder in his tone. Tony's heart flutters at the tone, but the fact that he thinks they'd belong to
What? After all that she said about Tony and damning him, she was just going to help Thanos get that much closer to taking over their universe?
Maria didn't have a very strong constitution, really, and it was a surprise to everyone when she was able to conceive Tony at all. They had all expected for her to die during childbirth. She didn't, but a small part of Tony wonders if she would've suffered less if she had.
"I'm sure you've got a lot to discuss as a pack now, so I'll head to the garage and get started." He turns on his heel, nodding once just to himself before he goes, when Bucky's voice calls out.
"Maybe that'll teach you not to taunt me." Steve tells him, and he's grinning wide like he's won some argument.
The rest of the team is already there, sitting around the dining table that is once more, empty. Wanda is there, but the cloth that Stephen had once used to quell her powers is draped over her hands once more. She's glaring daggers in their direction. Wanda is young and held a lot of resentment for Tony that really - Steve couldn't understand. Sure, Tony designed weapons and a missile his company designed took her family away.
"Tony." Steve's voice is calling to him, and when Tony turns his head, Steve's still right there at the table. He's not even sure how he knows it's Steve's voice, just knows that it is.
Steve responds into it easily, because there really isn't anything better to him than having Tony wrapped up in his arms where Steve knows he'll be safe. He doesn't know enough about science to help Tony build weapons, so he's useless there. He's still learning how to convince Tony to eat regularly and take breaks. He's still unsure of how to convince Tony that his pack is also Tony's pack, but that's something that can't be learned overnight no matter how much he wishes it to be so. But at the end of the day, when Tony is scared or frustrated with himself and can't seem to shake himself out of his thoughts, he knows he can count on Steve; even if he has to be coaxed into vulnerability.
Steve's quiet moans and the roll of his hips to meet his mouth give him a hazy kind of pleasure. He can do this all day, just tasting Steve and letting the blond fill his senses. But oh the other hand, when Steve seems to be getting closer to his release, his fingers are flexing in his hair.
at him already, "I told you I wouldn't ask you to come home. I told you I was fine with just watching from a distance. I told you I didn't want to pressure you. But now -- if you reject me now, after all of this, I
“Please,” he concedes; and he watches in silence as Stephen flicks his fingers and another full cup of tea is in his hand.
Again, the rest of the room seems to be in silent agreement, but Steve remains silent, contemplative, as he ducks his head. His voice is just a whisper, seeing as there are others around, and Tony has to bite his lip to hold back the shiver that comes along with Steve's breath on his ear, "Is something going on?"
There's no verbal answer that comes from the suit. He doesn't need one, anyway. Words come and go but it's actions that mean anything. And this time, Steve would do anything to ensure that Tony never feels like he's on his own again.
Steve stares at him like he's lost his mind, his jaw clenching as he steps closer and effectively boxing Tony against the counter, "What does my working for the government have to do with you?"
"No kidding. We got a long drive ahead and I'd like to get some sleep before it." Clint agrees with a snicker, and the rest of the room seems to snort in agreement.
Because in the end, that's exactly what he was gearing towards. As much as he'd like to stay with Steve and be part of the first family that has ever accepted him, how could he walk away from his family legacy and the millions of workers that relied on him? Howard wasn't able to create a balance that would spend time with his own flesh-and-blood; how was he supposed to be any different.
"You two know each other?" Natasha asks, and her eyes lock onto Steve like she's asking if he understands what's going on better than she does.
If Steve knew that he dreamt of space and car batteries plugged to his chest every night, he wouldn't think that at all. He'd probably run straight for the hills. That should be the reason he tells the blond, he thinks; but he only manages a whimper.
He pushes Steve away again, and Steve looks understandably hurt. Tony can tell he's giving the man whiplash. Tony closes his eyes momentarily, darting his tongue out to decide on how swollen his lips must be. They're raw and tingling, but he loves the feeling of it.
"It happened, now all we can do is move forward." Steve replies, and he turns to his side, leaning his back against the counter and crossing his arms over his chest. Tony tries not to dwell on the image of those beautiful muscles flexing.
His lips are part, just slightly and curled in what seems to be amusement. Tony decides he loathes the Adonis for it.
"We're watching the Hobbit," Bruce supplies, his voice gentle but unsure like he can also read the discomfort on Tony, "Are you going to join us?"
"I'm trying, Steve, I'm really trying." Tony chokes out, and it sounds like a heartbroken plea in his own ears.
"Dammit, Tony." Steve says between clenched teeth, and he takes a deep breath to pull himself together, "You can't keep going out there without telling me anything. What if you get hurt out there? If I don't know where you are I can't get to you if something happens."
"Where are you going?" Steve asks from behind him, but he's not reaching forward to stop him and it gives Tony the thought that his presence really isn't welcomed at the moment.
Tony stares up at him, his lower lip quivering. He doesn't like the anger that's filling Steve's face. It reminds him too much of Howard, he decides.
A life on the run is a life that isn't easy. Anthony Edward Stark, otherwise known as Tony, knows this better than anyone. It's something that's had to be learned quickly -desperately- after two years on the run. Granted, running is a lot easier for him than it would be most people, seeing as he started out with over 2 million dollars in cash and then picked up odd jobs throughout his travels to keep living his chosen lifestyle. Still, with the lack of a home or family and long drives that could take days at a time with cheap gas station coffee, the luster of adventure has faded away completely.
He freezes in the threshold of the room, and all the conversation that had been going on stills at once. Everyone's looking in their direction, and Tony feels overwhelmed in a way he hasn't in years.
"Tony?" Steve asks, and he has his arms wrapped around Tony's torso and the brunet is cradled tightly against him in case he goes into shock.
Tony turns his head anyway, focusing his attention on Bucky. The metal-armed man is staring at him impassively, his lips pressed into a thin line. His eyes seem to narrow onto Tony's neck, where Tony knows Steve's mark isn't covered like it maybe should be.
The blond isn't smiling, exactly, but Tony can see the flicker of amusement in his gaze. He's entirely too smug about the whole thing, Tony thinks, and Tony should really stop staring now.
"I beat you to it this time." Steve says, and their foreheads are pressed together and Tony can feel Steve's breath fanning his face. "I'll try not to put too much pressure on you, Tony. I don't want you to fear me." He leans forward one more time, pressing another chaste kiss onto Tony's lips, "But I promised to get off your trail, and I intend to do that at least for the night." Tony tries to understand what he means, but his brain is seriously short circuiting right now. He's entranced by the scent of honey, the lingering feeling of Steve's hands tracing his skin, the shadow of the bites pressed into his lips that are causing it to swell.
Their eyes shift back to Sam, and even the group parts a little so Steve and James can make eye contact with him. Sam has his own mug of hot chocolate, since he doesn't care too much for caffeine, and he swirles it gently in his hand as he mulls it over, "Confidentiality dictates I can't share what he spoke about, but I can attest to the fact that he wants to try."
"What's this got to do-" Bucky takes the briefcase out of his reach; and Tony doesn't realize his grip has gone slack until he watches the former soldier lift it over his head. Bucky's eyes harden as he turns back to Tony, "This ain't no briefcase. You got a weapon in here?"
"Unstable? Yeah," Tony answers, and with a flicker of his eyes, the rest of the suit beings seeping out of his skin, "but I fixed it. Go ahead, Rogers. Ask me who I am out of the suit."
They take a moment to process this, though Steve never moves his eyes from Tony's expression. There's so much he seems to be holding back with the rest of the group there, but the blond's disappointment is radiating in waves. Tony doesn't want to disappoint him, but are there really other options?
Clint looks like he wants to argue, and maybe he's just going to reiterate Steve's earlier point of not trading lives; but then Steve's thinking back to all the times in the recent past where Tony's brought up his lack of importance to the team.
"That thing's about to blow." The Winter Soldier grunts, and he looks entirely like he's about to throw himself onto the alien to subdue the blast.
"Then you'll wait until you're dead, Rogers." Tony spits out, and he doesn't realize how angry the situation is making him until he slaps a hand onto the table.
There's a knock on the door then, and Natasha's poking her head into the room, "You do know that's Clint's bed? Right?"
He wants to say something, but doesn't want to distract Steve when it looks like he's having a great time. Instead, he quietly tiptoes around the living room to get into the kitchen. If he's going to be staying home, he might as well get some coffee started and work on armor schematics on his Starkpad.
"We were both wrecks when it happened. I left town, trying to find my mate wherever I could. Steve left town when he was 18 to try and help me find them." The smile on Bucky's face is almost bittersweet as he takes another sip of his coffee, "Along the way, we ended up making our own little pack. We're like a band of misfits and losers, without land of our own and just letting adventure guide us. We were in New York; just passing through, really, when he found you. It was like a smack in the face when he realized who you were to him. I was right there when he dove into the water for you, and while I know the kid who got into trouble for smaller things, the way he held you made everything so perfectly clear to me. Steve and I, now that I think about it, we would've never lasted as a romantic couple with how close we are. He's like the kid brother I never had growing up. It was just hard in that moment to realize that not only was he not my mate, but that he managed to find his one and only when he wasn't even looking."
A moment later, he's being hauled out of his seat, tossed over Steve's shoulders in a fireman's carry in the direction of the bedroom. He can't see the state of the bed from over Steve's shoulder; but when he's thrown down onto the mattress it's obvious that Steve hasn't been in his bed in at least a few days. The sheets are tucked in under the mattress in Steve's typical hospital style.
Still, he can't say he minds, or that he would prefer any other kind of life. Well, the second part is a lie; he'd much rather not have his entire pack threatened just so the genius would make more weapons that the brunet himself wanted to part in.
Sam hums as he stands up, collecting the mug that Tony somehow emptied without even realizing it, "Sometimes, I ask myself the same thing. Not about you, but Clint. Man makes a pig pen look clean. But I'll answer what you really mean to ask. You might not see it, but you ground Steve in a way I've never seen. You're
"And well, I told them that day that I was done making weapons; that I wouldn't sit by in a world where I wasn't held accountable for the weapons I created, and I wasn't going to let them distribute the Jericho while it was still technically my design." He scoffs again, then, and he actually does feel a little amused by the thoughts in his head, "Since I was still a minor and in an unofficial post, Howard and Obadiah still had the rights to my designs. I will never forget how the old man had the nerve to look me in the eye and tell me that true peace meant having a bigger stick than the other guy. So, I destroyed every copy of the blueprints to the Jericho, and I packed up my shit and left."
"Let me lead so I don't lose control." Steve mutters against his lips, a sheepish chuckle following as he teasingly rubs his head against Tony's entrance.
"I don't think we should put him through more of her hostility after what she's been doing to him." Sam answers, shaking his head as a hard look crosses his eyes. He won't take an argument on this, and he's probably thinking on Tony's behalf; and while he's spent the latter part of the day criticizing Tony and his previous decisions, Steve can't help but start to hope that just
, Steve. Not just your body, but you." Tony can't help the way his voice cracks, and Steve takes a shuddering breath as he turns his head back to look at him, "When I told you I didn't want to be someone that hurt you, I meant it, Steve. I don't want to hurt you anymore."
"Tony?" Steve asks, and while he's not making any move to get closer to him, he's not running off like Tony's half expecting him to. It's almost as though the man is an actual masochist.
And even though it's going to be difficult, and Tony knows it's as hard on Steve as it is for himself, he's starting to think that maybe they will be okay after all.
"When I graduated from my final degree, Howard had me working, in a completely unofficial role, to design weapons for Stark Industries. He got all the credit, but the designs were mine." He pauses to lick his lips, his eyes flickering shut as he faught the nasea that came with memories of his past, "We got a contract with the government. It was a big one, to design a missle big enough and powerful enough to wipe out any enemies of the state. Howard didn't have any new ideas at the time, so that one fell on me. A few months later, I created the Jericho missle."
Steve knew it would be useless in the end. There would never be enough words to convey to Tony what he was feeling right now. What he had felt as Tony’s life slipped away in his arms.
Steve didn’t say anything this time, but instead brought his head down to mouth at the top of Tony’s dick. Tony cried out, his movement pushing Steve’s fingers in deeper. The gentle suction and occasional prods of Steve’s tongue had him grabbing at Steve’s hair, rushed pleas flowing out of his mouth. Steve pulled back with a smile, letting Tony taste himself with a kiss. He felt Steve start to spread his fingers, stretching his rim.
He could hear a deep inhale, most likely Steve. Clint could almost picture the blonde man, chest puffed out as he clenched down on his hands, trying not to throw a punch. “Oh, we’ll get to that later. Now I’m gonna ask again. What the hell are you doing here?”
"Given the poor clarity of the CCTV cameras, the shadows from the building, and the man’s distance from the cameras, I have been unable to construct a complete subject for facial recognition."
Tony’s face went carefully blank before he replied softly, “I would never half-ass anything that would put our family at risk. You know that.”
The Captain snapped into action. A quick text to his phone, which Tony assumed was to collect the rest of his mutts, and the man was on the move, looking completely opposite to how he was just moments ago. He trailed Tony into the meeting room, heading straight to the computers.
Tony didn’t mention him much, but Steve had a feeling his first impression was enough to go on. Stane did not sit well with Steve. With the tight grip he shook Steve’s hand and the glares he shot him, Steve knew the feeling was mutual.
It wasn’t even the product itself – in fact, said product was just another grimy neck pillow that yet again claimed to be voted best on the market. No, it was the cheesy stock photo that was at the center of the packaging. It was hardly different than what he had probably seen a million times before – a fake couple snuggled together next to a fake fire, with fake smiles to match. But for the life of him, Steve couldn’t help but think of Tony. Couldn’t help but think of his eyes glowing against the bright flames, or how warm his body would feel as he snuggled up next to Steve’s under the stars.
“Agent,” Tony quipped in response, already looking at his son, who was very blatantly trying to become one with the chair he was sitting in, refusing to meet Tony’s eye.
Tony sighed, flopping his head against Steve’s chest. “I know, I know,” he said. “But it’s not a lie. I got a lot of stuff going on up there, and sometimes it doesn’t shut up until I do something about it.”
But it wasn’t that case now. Tony didn’t have a perfect internal clock, but even he knew it had been over an hour.
“Warming it up,” Steve answered, ears pink with embarrassment. “It’s a bit cold, and I just thought that- ” he trailed off. Tony grinned, the smile growing as the blonde shot him a dirty glare. “Shut up,” he pouted.
The bell on the door chimed as Steve entered the diner. He sat in his usual spot, idly straightening out the silverware.
Barnes’ hands twitched again, an unconscious reach for a gun to soothe him. Tony wondered what he was thinking about. Not surprising; he could almost never get a read on Steve’s stone-faced friend.
“Right, thanks for the tip. Next time I see someone get assaulted, I’ll just let it happen. Good to know where your priorities are, Mr. FBI man.”
He picked Steve up, and well, saved him really. Said that if Steve was going to start over, he would as well. Picked up odd jobs when they weren’t at school. Anything to keep them afloat until their new life changed forever.
But while the abandoned groceries weren’t his problem, the reason for the lack of purchase of said groceries certainly was.
Bucky grinned. “You like? Brand new, rides like a charm. That is, it would, if the fucking thing would start,” he finished, kicking the motorbike. He looked back up at Steve. “You going to the club?”
He wasn’t exactly sure where he was; he wasn't exactly sure he cared. What felt like years since he had spoken to an aid on the phone, a vehicle rolled up to where Tony was huddled over Barnes, doing everything in his power to keep him breathing. Hands reached out and loaded them both in. The same hands that pushed him out of the way to start working on Barnes. He didn't fight them, opting to collapse into a seat and drift, pretending he still couldn't hear the other injured passenger's screams in his ears. And then he'd somehow ended up here - wherever here was. He figured it was better not to ask - Tony had asked for
Steve wasn’t a fan of it being directed at him. “It’s not you, it’s me,” Tony said slowly, grimacing at the words coming out of his mouth.
Giddiness bubbled in his cheat, Clint biting down hard on his lip to keep it from escaping. “Of course, you do. What’s not to love?”
Steve paused in his selection, looking back up at Bucky. “Why does it matter if he got his bed in California?”
They were headed south, out of Manhattan, but that was all Steve knew, and he couldn’t muster up the courage to ask. For what seemed like years later, Tony finally pulled next to the curb. He had barely stopped the car before Steve stumbled out, desperate for fresh air. He looked around the street to realize they were in Brooklyn.
He'd seen the bodies - what was left of them. When Schmidt had initially approached him, he'd thought the man out of his mind. What he knew, what he was planning on doing; it all seemed like it came right out of a book. But he owed that man everything. He'd pulled back the curtain for Pierce, showed him a world far more sophisticated and powerful than he could have ever imagined.
To Tony’s delight, Steve whispered a quick, “oh my God,” in horror before he scrambled to get off him, receding quickly back into his chair.
“It doesn’t matter what you call it,” Phil continued. “What matters is the team dropping everything to come find me. Pierce is watching you guys like a hawk – any slip up and one of you actually
Steve watched as Sam walked up to the rest of the Loopers. He looked up with a weak smile. “So, uh, we celebrating?”
Steve thought, stomach dropping. He’s barely had time to grieve the loss of the rest of The Commandos, and now Steve was going to drop this bomb on him.
“Are you sure he'll go through with it? After everything you told us about their past, you're sure Stark will push through his daddy issues to get to Steve before Loki does? I'm all for getting Stark back on our side, but I don't know the man well enough to trust that he'll follow suit. I don't want to risk Steve on your gut feeling.”
Steve nodded, but Tony still didn’t move. Tony cleared his throat, looking down. Apparently after helping Tony back up, Steve didn’t think it was necessary to let go. Steve let go of Tony in an instant, feeling his face burn even hotter.
Everything else started to slip away, Steve only grounded by the two men under him. They moved as one, each one an extension of the other two. They were all that mattered, and there was nothing else.
Phil was working in the belly of the beast, just feet away from the man who was now in charge of HYDRA. Clint had pleaded with Phil, trying anything to get the man to leave, to quit, to do
Of course, Arkansas wasn’t a perfect picture of his childhood. He’d grown up in the outskirts of New Orleans, a Louisiana boy, through and through. Him, and his Mama and gaggle of sisters. It seemed like only yesterday that he was the one laughing in his front yard, chasing his friends around in the summer heat. It was quieter up here, less foot traffic, but it was still familiar. He guessed he should count his blessings that he ended up somewhere like here.
“You see, Stark,” Loki continued, completely ignoring Steve. “You had us all fooled. Everyone believed that you and The Captain were done. But you couldn’t stay away, could you? They saw, Stark. They saw you and Barnes pull The Captain out of the river. They know you’re still with them. They’re going to kill you, Stark.”
Steve opened his mouth to respond, but Natasha grabbed them both by the collar, dragging them out of the room, Thor not far behind. She pulled them up the stairs where everyone else was waiting and sat them down.
Bucky groaned Steve’s name. Or, at least he tried too; even in his disheveled state, Bucky knew that what came out of him were definitely not words. A cool pressure rested against his lips, Bucky humming softly as he let the ice chip slip between his teeth.
Tony narrowed his eyes at the general direction at Steve. He opened his mouth to snap back when Pietro made another snide comment. “She’d eat if Vision told her too.”
“Well, that’s just great,” Steve muttered under his breath, looking back at Bucky. The other man was still looking up at the sky, staring at nothing. He nodded, as if coming to an agreement with himself. He met Steve’s eyes for a brief moment before breaking away, shouldering past him.
I don't know about you, but I'm definitely looking forward to the fact that I won't have to write 'The Captain' every other sentence anymore. It's the little things in life.
Minutes later, days later, years later, Tony found his way back into consciousness. Steve was behind him, peppering kisses along his back and shoulder. Tony found himself leaning into it, loving the feeling of warmth and security.
Tony paused, shooting Natasha a mischievous smirk over the laptop screen. “Let’s get it,” they said at the same time.
sorry, Tony.” He grabbed at Tony’s hands – those damn hands – and cradled them against him. “This is all my fault, and I- ”
“We even said that we would help Steve bring them to the church,” Bucky added. “You know, like the good God-faring people that we are.”
“You okay?” he finally asked, eyeing Stark warily as the other brunette rubbed over his chest, where his new lifeline lay beneath a thin layer of cotton.
You can solve every major crisis that envelopes the globe, but nothing could erase man’s need for conflict. That will always remain. It’s the way the world works, and the way we do, son.”
’. At this rate, I’ll be out of brain cells by the end of the year.” The brunette grumbled and turned back away from Steve, shifting back down to a comfortable position.
“And the first thing you do when you get out is charge down the street guns blazing, isn’t it?” Pierce sneered. “You’re such a child.”
Tony saw a life without Steve, causing his breathing to pick back up again. He tried to reach for his lab chair, but he miscalculated, causing him to spiral to the floor. His breath was stuck in his throat, he couldn’t breathe, be couldn’t-
he means it. Not being a genius himself it’s hard to compare, but he liked to think it was a literal itch under Tony’s skin, the brain refusing to rest before new ideas where shot out into physicality. Even if that meant getting an idea at three in the morning.
“That’s because it’s never been done before. No bullets, no reloads, no anything. All the power comes from that,” he added, pointing to the half made miniature arc reactor.
The two broke off their conversation again, the room falling into silence except for the water dripping from the pipe.
“It’s alright,” Bucky responded, letting his body be squished, even leaning closer. “Probably shouldn’t have led with the water, hmm?” Steve didn’t respond, just opting to press closer to his friend. “You should probably lie back down; Bruce says you're going to have quite a fever to deal with.”
Fury gave him a stony eye, but nodded. “Alright Stark, you’re up. Take Romanoff and Rhodes with you. Get it done. And you,” he pointed back to Clint as he walked out the door. “You and I are going to talk.”
“Well, you found me. I was just leaving, so I’ll walk you to the door?” he asked, trying to push past the other man, but was stopped by a large hand.
do realize,” Steve added, “that if you actually asked Pepper for a break, she would absolutely give you one.”
Tony caught him by the shirt and drew him back in for a proper kiss. “She’s being overdramatic,” Tony said when he pulled away. “I’m sure we can be fashionably late.”
Tony nodded. Steve stepped back over to the bed, pausing only to get another handful of lube, slathering his cock liberally. Tony reveled in the moment, listening to small noise of relief that Steve gave as soon as his hand closed on the hard flesh. He also felt a wave of pride and desire as he watched Steve pinch at his base, staying his orgasm.
“Thanks, Ms. Scarlett,” Emily added, getting back to her feet with a slight spring in her step, as if her legs weren’t already screaming in agony.
Tony wanted to protest, wanted to scream and yell some more. Where had Steve been? Why was he so late? Would he still be here when Tony woke up? That was what scared him the most – that Tony would wake up cradling an empty bottle instead of Steve’s warm hands.
“Yes. Let’s take a look at your life. You’re a killer. You’re a junkie. The real question is why she would bother saving a low life like you. You’re so self-absorbed and stupid. But she’s gonna come and clean you up. You’re gonna take her love like a sponge. And you think you’re finally safe. And then yesterday happens.”
Steve had been shocked; he never really thought that much into archery. But that was what made Clint Barton so spectacular. Just a normal guy taking on gods and aliens, all while using a medieval weapon. And maybe the fact that he could do it all with a smile on his face, and a joke on his lips was just an added bonus.
Bucky grabbed his arm. “Don’t go back in. Let them stew for a little bit. Give them time to figure out what they wanna spill to us tomorrow.”
Steve stepped over the other bodies with disinterest, looking at the other men standing in front of Hammer. “If you tell me who you work for, I’ll let you leave.”
Tony scowled at her, but dutifully stopped fidgeting with his arm. It had been a few days since The Captain’s attack, the tension seemingly increasing each day. Obie had fought with him about increasing Tony’s security, but Tony had shot it down; there was no way he was going to let himself go on house arrest. Pepper was absolutely flustered, like a mother hen constantly fretting over her baby chick. She checked in with Tony at all hours of the day, making it impossible for him to be anywhere else besides where he was supposed to be.
The woman didn’t seem to hear their exchange. “Well, aren’t you two just the sweetest! It’s so wonderful seeing the younger generation interested in local history. Say cheese!”
That was another problem, wasn't it? Thor had offered up his sprawling loft for the people that needed it, but it was still a tight fit, even minus the men who went home to their families, and the ones that were still missing. It was incredibly generous, but Steve knew he and his men couldn’t stay there forever. They needed to regroup, they needed a plan, they needed-
So when Fury asked him to consult on SHIELD business, Tony accepted. When Fury asked to make new tech, Tony accepted. When Fury asked him to take in the Avengers, Tony accepted.
A chair creaked, and Steve’s focus snapped to the center of the room, where Commissioner Fury was turning in his chair to face him.
Bruce sighed. “No, I guess not. I’ll throw a test together. See if you can find anything else for me.”
Tony scoffed. “Oh, really. You’re gonna pull the ‘I’m just a grunt soldier’ card now? Everyone knows now much pull you have here. I’m surprised The Captain is able to tie his shoes without asking you what kind of knots he should go with.”
Suddenly, Fury burst through the door. The agent on babysitting duty straightened immediately, coming to full attention. “Here’s the deal,” the man gruffed out as he stopped towards Natasha and Sam. “Pierce is in our main briefing room. He’s there with the governor and his wife. The governor is there to take some pictures and shake a few hands, the usual PR bullshit. The ceremony doesn’t start for another hour, but I’m gonna go in and sweep this up, now. As much as I would like to cuff the bastard in front of New York’s news cameras, the NYPD wants this out of the public eye as much as possible.”
Steve always thought it was amusing how the fiery red head could always wrangle his lover into doing anything with a simple glare. Steve would count himself lucky if he managed to get Tony to eat a sandwich.
“Not much. All I know is that he just left the station a little while ago. He’s going to make a move.”
“I was hoping you could tell me,” said Fury. “You were the head Librarian. What sort of things did the SSR have?”
The other man shrugged, waving at someone over Tony’s shoulder. “Deal didn’t go the way I wanted,” he answered, almost distracted.
“I guess,” Natasha shrugged. “It just doesn’t make any sense. Why even bother with false information? It’s not like we had any inkling of what direction to head in before.”
Steve groaned. His head was pounding. This future wasn’t supposed to happen. His memories were jumbling together, his past memories changing. When his new memories formed, Steve gasped. His past self didn’t run; he went back to his apartment.
Barton opened the door, peeking around each side. “I slip you out the back, tell everyone you got the jump on me. It’s not fool proof, but it’s the best we can do. I let you land a few punches and hopefully Cap will be too worried about my health to figure it out.”
Steve slapped the hand away. “I’m not leaving him,” he snapped. Steve watched as the nurse running with them rattled off more numbers to the doctor. “What’s she saying?” Steve demanded. “What does that mean?”
The blonde clenched his jaw, his arms crossing. “Did you want something or did you just come here to taunt me?”
“We’re gonna die,” Bucky said to Steve, still looking at the open doorway, as if waiting for Tony to strut back in.
Tony sighed, letting his head fall back against the cold wall with a small thud. She had just come from surgery; she wouldn’t have had a phone anyway.
“Well, you know the basics. That one up there is the North Star. I think. The group it’s by makes a frying pan. Or a toaster, I can never remember.”
“AKA, you’re going to have a surprise house visit today by your handler, and we can’t afford to stick around,” Tony added.
Steve was getting frantic. He was almost back down to the main floor, the blood trail he was following not getting any smaller. If Tony had gotten hurt again, it would end Steve. Steve had promised that after everything that had happened, he would never lost sight of Tony again. And yet, here he was, searching for his potentially injured lover. Again.
Bucky rolled his eyes, crossing his arms. “Really?” Steve didn’t have time to apologize before Bucky was snatching the gun out of his hand, smacking the butt of it against his head gently. “You haven’t slept in God knows how long. You shouldn’t even be allowed to
Back at base, Steve could see that some were still working on clean up from the explosion earlier today. He snapped at Clint to go to medical to get his chest wound taken care of, taking in the small flinch Clint made from the sound of his voice.
There was a roaring in his ears, his vision was blurry. He could feel his blood pounding through his veins. But none of that mattered. His mind was focused on one thing.
He drove wildly, ignoring the amount of traffic laws be broke in order to reach the office. The pain in his arm was getting worse, the adrenaline finally leaving his system. Tony’s hand twitched on the steering wheel, his eyes constantly checking behind him for a tail.
Without waiting for a response, Steve gripped his gun tightly, took a deep breath and jumped from cover. He raced blindly over to the right, drawing fire away from Bucky as he sprinted to another set of crates. His muscles burned as he ran across the last few steps, diving behind the wooden barricades.
“I’m sorry, Cap,” Clint continued. “I tried, but with everything that’s happened, people just…. I’m sorry.”
Barnes tried to push forward, only to stop again. Looking down in horror, he saw his fingers start to disappear.
And then, Steve's body crumbles forward, and all of his weight lands on Tony. He's not squished, per se, but this isn't the most comfortable position in the world. He ignores it, though, bringing his hands down to Steve's shoulders and squeezing the blond against him.
"Stay for dinner, Bucky?" Tony asks; and by asks, he means tells. He can be as stubborn as Steve when he wants to be, and both of the super soldiers know that.
First it was Bucky, and then it was Wanda. And that's just of who he's aware of choosing over Tony, even though those weren't his intentions. Who knew how many people he'd betrayed Tony over.
"'Tasha, do something about this?" Steve asks, releasing the two in order to wave his hand in Clint's direction.
"Look at me, sweetheart." Steve's voice, soft but commanding, has him turning his head back as soon as he hears it. Steve reaches forward, bringing one hand to the back of Tony's neck to hold him there as he pulls out again and thrusts all the way back in. Tony gasps, and Steve lunges forward for another kiss, their tongues meeting in the air between them. It's messy and jerky and there's saliva everywhere, but Tony loves it regardless, because Steve doesn't stop moving the entire time, and all of his attention is on Tony.
"Are you okay?" Steve asks, swaying in his spot like he wants to move forward. Tony's not sure if he can handle Steve getting closer yet or not.
And despite all the reasons things can go wrong between them and all the reasons he's telling himself to let go because someone as beautiful and kindhearted as Steve doesn't deserve to be roped into Tony Stark's life, his heart proceeds to skip another beat.
"Stevie," Bucky warns, and though his voice is quiet enough that only Steve should be able to hear it, Tony's eyes flicker over to Bucky again in amusement.
"Tony!" He calls out, but Tony might not even be listening to him because he just continues walking in the direction of the garage.
"We needed oversight. We needed to be held accountable." Tony disagrees, his hand slapping against the dining table, "Ive been held accountable for years over my weapons designs and my actions as Iron Man, but none of you wanted to be responsible for your actions. None of you wanted to clean up after New York. None of you helped with the fallout of Sokovia. Instead, you got mad when the government said you needed to answer to the destruction of Lagos. The world was going to take us down whether or not we agreed to it.
Wait, Tony's strolling past him. Why's Tony strolling past him? He just literally tucked Tony into bed -- has it even been an hour since he left the room? Should he have stayed and curled up next to the brunet just in case something like this were going to happen? He gets Tony's desperation better now that James had explained some of his behavior, but to completely ignore his body? Steve would do anything to ease the ache from his chest.
Tony doesn't move for a moment, and Steve wishes that he'd flip his faceplate back so he could at least see whatever expression the brunet was making.
Hawkeye continues to look dismayed, and Black Widow looks over at Steve for just a moment before clearing her throat and standing.
Everyone's there from both of their lives, including a man named Sam Wilson who's a hero that works mostly out of Washington, D.C.
At that moment, Clint walks back into the kitchen, lips pressed together in a tight smile, "He's coming out."
There's an alien on the screen; at least, that's what it looks like. There's destruction following it like it's attracting it, and there's a body count flashing on the bottom of the screen. The scene is being filmed via helicopter, and Tony feels his stomach clenching as he watches.
Tossing his phone onto the bed, he grunts. Steve really doesn't make much sense to him. Tony believes in science and research, not following after his heart despite how much it can hurt. He's only human, after all -- wait, no he's not only human, he's also werewolf. Regardless, his brain is the only thing he will follow. Steve can follow him as much as his bulky heart requires. Tony can't pay more attention to that than he does to himself and his dreams.
Damn that Howard. Damn Obadiah, too. Just when he's starting to get comfortable, they spring this shit up again.
"Fuck, Tony." Steve cries, and Tony makes a mental note to chide him about his language much like Captain America does when they're on the field.
He doesn't know how long he lays there, blankets drawn lazily over their naked forms; but he doesn't really mind, knowing their legs are tangled together underneath. Steve's growing erection is poking into his hip and causing blood to rush down to his own crotch; but that's also not something that presses into his mind. Not much, anyway.
"We've met." Both men answer, and the metal suit around Tony disappears back into his skin as he steps forward and drops himself in a chair at the dining table.
He hates it when she's right. Bracing himself, hands curling into his pocket like they're his lifelines, he turns and strides right over to where Steve is sitting. He's not alone, of course. Alphas are rarely alone in public. Tony doesn't care about the rest, though. He only sees Steve and his self-confident grin like he's known this would happen.
In the end, that seems to be enough to break down the rest of Steve's resolve. Tony's hips are bruised from when Steve reluctantly released his hands and curled his fingers into Tony's waist instead. Steve's spot is brighter now and is joined by another several that seem to paint the alpha's neck. The bed has a serious creak now; and it's not a surprise because no one's really used it since he was a kid. When they finish, Tony's thighs are quaking from exhaustion, and he's limping his way into the bathroom to clean off.
"You deserve it," Rhodey answers, smug as always; but just before the trio gets to them, he veers off in Bucky's direction. They kiss, though it's just a chaste touch of their lips. Tony feels like a fish with its jaw slack, "When did -"
"All of you were dead." Tony answers, finally, and then his eyes drift to Steve, "Except you. You were just barely alive, and you told me I could've done more to stop it. Ultron - he was supposed to blanket the planet and add security. The mind stone was too powerful and took over the programming."
"You don't mean that, Tony." Sam tells him, shaking his head like he's in the midst of a bad dream. If he is, he's sharing it with Steve.
Raising his head high, Tony turns heel and saunters into the mens room. Just a moment after he walks in, the door swings open behind him, and he's pulled roughly. His back collides with the door, but it's neither too rough or too gentle for him. He's still dizzy, though, and the gasp that flows out of him is swallowed along with any air that was in his lungs. Instead, everything's consumed by
At the end of the garage is a glass wall and a little locking mechanism that allows only fingerprints. He had Pepper and Rhodey printed in the past; Natasha's might still work but that might've just been left alone as an oversight. When the door opens with a 'swish,' Tony walks into the workshop. He might be trembling a little, too, as he takes in the work stations and computers and organized clutter that always made him feel at ease.
The sound of glass breaking has Tony turning his head in Thor's direction. Thor is positively livid, and doesn't even seem to realize that there's blood dripping from his palms from where he'd been gripping onto a beer bottle.
He starts with a tentative lick of the head, and Steve inhales sharply, though he's forcing his hips still. Steve's cock is straining with the effort, precum dripping from the slit. Tony just laps it up, and he ignores the salty taste because it's Steve and it's something he never thought he could have. He swipes his tongue along the shaft, watching as it causes another drop of precum to form at the tip. Steve is moaning beneath him, but quietly and like he's unsure of what's happening, and Tony wants nothing more than to pleasure him. With that, he wraps his lips around the head, tucking his teeth behind them, and he finds himself moaning when Steve bucks into the heat of his mouth.
"You say that, Tony, but it's always going to hurt when I wake up and you're not beside me." He sighs out, and he presses a soft kiss to the center of Tony's forehead, stepping back slowly to put some distance between them, and while his lips are curled into a soft smile, the joy doesn't reach his eyes, "I'll bring you lunch later if you don't come out of the garage by then."
Steve pulls away, and they're both panting and Tony can feel the flush on his face mirroring Steve's pale skin. Steve looks incredibly sexy like this - hooded blue eyes, swollen lips, and chest heaving. He's still angry, it seems, and Tony knows it's not something words can solve.
Steve doesn't answer but instead returns to his earlier ministrations. There's so much passion in his kiss that Tony feels like he's being swallowed up by it, and Steve holds onto him like he's going to shatter and disappear if he lets go.
He's always hated being vulnerable; and always prided himself on being able to hide it from anyone, including Rhodey and Pepper. Even if they were starting to feel more like his own pack than he had expected, he hates to think of himself as a liability and wonders how much they'll mock him for it.
And really, he'd stay out of any fight that has the Avengers team nearby, just out of spite; but now he has a reason to get himself involved, and that reason is the earnest, kindhearted man that's out there in a fight he's got no business in.
He knows it's a bad idea to look at Tony while he confesses it, and yet his body betrays him anyway and turns to look at him. Tony's looking right at him, this time. His gaze is heavy, searching for lies where there are none. But Steve can't say that, because Tony's got no reason to trust him after their past.
The amusement on Steve's face falters, but just slightly. He's looking at Tony like Tony's the one thats strange. Their gazes hold, and Tony raises an eyebrow, feeling the anger in his body cool down even without his acceptance. Steve seems to notice it, too, and leans forward like he's trying to look into Tony's soul, "Sit across from me or sit beside me. We'll discuss that after you've eaten."
pack safe, but you should know us better by now. We're not going anywhere. I'm not going anywhere. No one's going to take me away from you; not Obadiah, not weapons, not even
"You couldn't even call me and warn me?" Steve continues, and he stops just before Tony, reaching out and firmly planting a hand to the side of Tony's head.
"You asked for it," Steve retorts simply; and in the next moment, he has Tony's hands pinned over his head with one of his own hands and grips both of their cocks in his free one.
"Sir?" JARVIS asks, in a call for his attention, "I took the liberty of preparing the backup briefcase suit for your withdrawal."
"It's cold." Steve mutters, and he won't even look Tony in the eye, like just looking at the brunet is too much for him right now.
"What do you mean?" Steve asks, and his gaze flickers in the direction that the pair had disappeared off to for the briefest of seconds.
. He looks like he's satisfyed with whatever he'd been up to in the past day since he shut out everyone who cared about him. Okay, so maybe Steve
When Tony finally relents and takes the cup of tea, the sound of a camera shutter has his eyes narrow and focus onto Rhodey. The man's shit-eating grin is back, and Tony wants nothing more than to smack it off of him.
, and you couldn't pick the Malibu house?" Rhodey quips, as sarcastic and dry as he ever was, and Tony is up and out of his seat in a matter of seconds.
"Our glorious Captain has picked the best mate to be his!" Thor says, cheerful and bright and Tony realizes he's missed that childlike wonder.
He gets into the garage easily enough, the door lifted off the ground just enough for him to crouch on his way in. It's only when he's inside the garage that his composed façade falls, and Tony drops onto a stool beside his car. He'd been wanting to work on his latest car, an older model that was hard to hard to get his hands on, but it really wasn't much more of an excuse. He just needed to get away from Steve and from his fate. His heart had been hammering in his chest from the moment his eyes locked onto Steve's, and his body wanted nothing more than to just reach out and grasp onto those blond strands.
Tony moans without really wanting to, and he knows this is going against everything he's worked for. He can't submit, not to Steve, not
No. It really doesn't sound outlandish, not that he'd admit that to her. He frowns and tilts his head back to look up at his hotel room's ceiling. Losing a mate, even one you're not bonded to yet, can cause the deepest heartbreak. A lot of times, wolves that lose their mates go insane, and Tony can't imagine what that's like for anyone. He sure as hell doesn't like the idea of doing it to Steve.
Steve just stares in the direction he'd gone in with his heart shattered and laying on the floor, trampled. He deserves it, but it doesn't make it hurt any less.
”I don’t understand!” Wanda shouts, and she’s the only one who seems thoroughly uninterested in helping Tony at all.
"How did you know I was going to come in here?" Tony asks warily, leaning back in his seat with his arms crossed over his chest as best he could.
"Don't finish that sentence." The genius is heaving now, holding a hand in the air with his palm flat like just knowing Steve's breathing in his direction will bring on the onslaught of a panic attack.
He scoffs, then turns once more to leave, but his body collides with another. He recoils strongly, taking a wide step back as he eyes the petite frame he'd walked into. Red, curly hair, lips painted with a color that can only resemble blood, the barely concealed spark of danger in her eyes. Natasha, of course she was there.
The tips of his ears are red, though, and Tony knows he's not much better. The rest of the pack doesn't seem to mind, save for Sam's groan and Clint's inappropriate comments; but Tony just manages to keep his mouth shut as Steve drops him down onto the countertop. If this is what being part of a pack is like, even in the midst of rough times, he was really missing out on a lot.
"Ste-" Tony tries to get in words, tries to tell Steve that it's been too long since either of them had slept and can this wait until they've at least had a nap?
“It’s a public event, Steve,” Tony sighed, tucking the blankets tighter against Steve’s side, dodging the other man’s attempts to push him away. “Complete with private security. I’ll be as safe as can be.”
Pride swelled in Steve’s chest. Tony was right; they were the only ones qualified to handle this. There was no other choice. “Tony’s right. Pierce doesn’t change anything. I don’t know about the rest of you, but I’m not leaving until the remainder of HYDRA is buried alongside the rest of them.”
Tony’s face drew grim, the man no doubt following the same line of thought. But it lasted just a moment before it was gone, Tony nodding determinedly. “Of course,” he said before smiling sarcastically. “You think we have something he’ll want to hear about?” Tony asked, eyes twinkling.
That old-timey Capone mob. A band of brothers, putting the mob before their own blood. Tony saw it now. He saw why The Commandos were never taken down. It was almost impossible; the group before him shared such a bond, that with each hit, they get nothing but stronger. It was Sparta; King Leonidas and his three hundred men standing guard, not letting a single man get past to their home. It was Arminius and his men, defending their Germanic homeland from invasion. It was William Wallace and his Scots battling for freedom on The Stirling Bridge. It was Davey Crocket and his fellow Texans standing tall in the Alamo’s last stand. It was Paul Revere and the Minutemen leading a revolution on the fields of Lexington and Concord. It was the Allies with one final push against a final Blitzkrieg in the British skies.
His muscles burned but he pressed forward, gasping in relief when he saw the cars. Instead of heading straight to his, Tony ran up alongside The Captain’s, dropping the unfilled water bottles and near empty sugar bag to the ground and opened the gas tank.
Steve took off sprinting for the quinjet. He didn’t even bother to wait for the rest of his team. His mind was taken over by one thought.
His mother had all kinds of promises for him. She would whisper them to him as he lay feverish in bed, as he walked to school, even as he left for basic. Frivolous dreams of course, but his mother had always been more stubborn than he was, so he was always inclined to believe them. Then she died, and well, Steve stopped believing in wishes.
he repeated like a mantra. Everything would go to plan, and soon he’d be back in Steve’s arms. He’d told Tony that himself.
The joke fell horribly flat, more so when Tony burst into peals of hollow laughter. “Don’t be ridiculous, Cap.”
Tony huffed softly. “I need to go in to the office. HYDRA’s hit everything in the New York area. I gotta talk to my people, see if I can prepare them for if HYDRA starts attacking on a national scale.”
The pair piled in the elevator, listening to the hum of the machinery as they climbed to Ms. Pott’s office. “I looked at her calendar,” Bucky started. “It had Stark listed as unavailable starting the day you two went missing until next week. Did he say anything to you about taking off?”
“I’m sorry, what?” Barnes gaped. Tony scoffed, grabbing at his comb to run through his hair a final time.
“This isn’t working,” sighed Steve. Maybe they should have just stuck with trying to get something out of Hammer. It wouldn't be like they wouldn't get anything out of him. But Tony had made a good point -
Bucky nodded before taking off to catch Thor. Steve stood around on the main floor and watched them go, his body still thrumming with adrenaline. He sighed again, heading for the gym, hoping a few rounds with the punching bag will calm him down. He rounded the corner, trying to wipe the blood on his knuckles off when he ran into Phil Coulson.
After one last glance over, Steve was off, back down the stairs, hauling four citizens over his shoulder.
Steve paused, looking back into Tony’s eyes, searching for something he already knew was there. “No,” he replied.
Steve hummed, leaning down to suck a mark into Tony’s neck. “How about a date?” he asked when he pulled away. “I believe I promised you one of those. I’ll even cook.”
The wheeze that left his chest was the closest he’d come to a laugh in months.  “I don’t want to burst your bubble, but I don’t think that’s gonna happen.”
Steve was on his way back to base, when he stumbled upon a curled up figure in a back alley. Steve found himself stopping when he recognized a familiar sweatshirt.
Steve nodded. And wouldn’t that be a knife to the gut. Steve and his men turning to an energy company for guns rather than an actual weapons dealer. But Steve and Thor go way back. Steve had first run into the hulking blonde years ago, when Asgardian tech started making its way across the pond. Asgard usually did business over on the eastern hemisphere, so when Steve heard that Thor and his father were coming over to globalize their market, Steve thought he had hit the jackpot. Not being a native to the area, Asgard’s security were no match for Steve and Bucky, the two easily breaking in to their storage. Steve and Bucky planned on stealing the weapons and tech they had brought across with them. What they hadn’t planned on was running into Thor as they were leaving.
When he woke again, it was too an empty bed. Any worry that was building up in his chest deflated when he heard the faint rumblings of Tony in the kitchen. He slipped out of the sheets and padded over to what he assumed to be the closet. Steve huffed when he opened the door; a closet it was, if the clothes lining the walls were any indication, but it looked like there was room to house another three people. Steve idly walked around the perimeter of the room, eyeing the open organized clothing, stopping in front of folded sweatpants. They were soft to the touch and
“Neither did I,” Barnes shrugged. “But you dragged me out of that building anyway. So what do you say? You back in?”
Phil gave Clint one last peck before pulling away. “I should go before someone gets suspicious. You know how Fury gets.”
Bucky smirked as he wiped the blood off his metal hand on their captive’s shirt. “What can I say? I got lost in the moment.”
Phil wasn’t oblivious to the speeding car, heading down the tracks towards him. He knew what was coming, what would happen if it hit. He
The brunette tightened his grip around his ripped sweatshirt. With his luck, Tony would probably die of hypothermia before he found a way home. Regardless, Tony listened for the sound of cars, and headed off to the right. He didn’t make it too far before he found himself stopping again.
Steve huffed. “That’s not what I meant. This whole thing started because something was bugging you.”
“Well,” Steve continued. “Not completely, Sir, and that’s part of the reason we’re here. We think that- ”
And now, Tony was stuck under parts of his building, meaning he couldn’t even get out to see if Steve was alright.
“It looks like our guy is a no show,” Bucky said with a grimace. He had really hoped this would have worked out. For as much as an ass that Stark was, the idea he had wasn’t half bad. It was their only chance to finally get a lead on HYDRA, but now it seemed like they were back to square one. “I’ll text Cap,” he continued. “This isn’t working.”
“Almost there,” she encouraged, shifting the smaller foot to wrap further around the other ankle. She felt the right leg wobble precariously, so she reached her other hand out to support the girl’s hip. “There we go, a successful sur le cou-de-pied,” she said with a smile, looking up at the child. The tiny brunette – Emily – looked back at her with wide eyes as she grasped the hand on her hip tightly, as if it were the only thing keeping her upright.
The two bombings have to be connected. Whoever did this is not just going after him, he’s gunning for his team as well.
Tony’s heart was pounding in his chest. There was no way he could have known these things. Maybe he was bluffing?
“You never cease to amaze me, Clint Barton,” Bucky retorted, pulling out his phone. He dialed Steve’s number, the man picking up on the first ring.
When Tony was fully seated, both men stilled. Time stopped as they gazed into each other’s eyes; lust was thick in the air. Steve moved his hands up to Tony, moving past his hips and threading his hands with Tony’s.
Steve furrowed his brow. “What could anyone gain from this? Watching us run around like a chicken with its head cut off?”
Tony bit his lip. This was not the time or place for this. If Tony had his way, there would never be a time for this discussion. Tony didn't do feelings. Tony could argue the validity of abstract math theorems, but through emotions at him and he's basically useless.
He reached back for the bread, but miscalculated, sending the loaf off the island down to the floor, landing with a small thump.
While Steve had thought about this moment lots of times, never once had he pictured kissing Tony in the middle of a firefight. In fact, it probably wasn’t a good idea, considering the kiss must have looked downright awful. Steve’s force almost pushed Tony on his ass, the movement causing Steve to catch more chin than mouth. When Tony finally got with the program, their noses bumped and teeth clacked as they tried to press further upon each other. There was no push and pull, just take, take, take, as the two men fought for dominance.
Steve watched as the door closed, listening to Stark’s footsteps fade away. He scooted lower in the plastic chair; the small furniture never letting Steve get comfortable. Steve glanced at the clock before letting his eyes drift shut. Stark was right; a small cat nap would probably help.
Tony was cut off by Bucky snatching him into a tight hug. “Oh God, you’re gonna kill me. This is the end, isn’t it?” Steve smiled at the pair, blatantly ignoring the wetness that started to form at the edge of his eyes.
“What is it?” Steve demanded, ignoring Clint’s initial outburst. “The Maximoff’s. Have they found Tony?”
So, no, waiting it out was not an option. Besides, he'd probably never get a chance like this again. This was his only chance to make it back home. And if he died in the process? Well, it will probably be a quicker way to go than whatever The Rings would cook up for him if he did nothing.
“Wait,” he started. “Listen, I know you don’t want to see anyone and by the way I wanna throw up I probably shouldn’t be walking around but I need to get this off my chest.”
to be able to see anything. The man would wander from table to table, stopping in front of a tool and staring, his mind no doubt spinning any and all possibilities. Tony would multitask, jumping between SI work, Bucky's arm, and his own personal projects as easy as breathing. Whatever he was working on was dependent on what he saw, the item in his hand solving the next step on his unending list of projects in real time. He'd never seen anyone draw inspiration from a single lug-nut until he met Tony.
listed underneath. Maybe it was Sam? Steve had his personal cell, but he could be calling from a work number.
a bad thing, Steve! You can’t keep going around, living in the past and your glory days. You don’t think I miss it too? But we’ve got a family to think about, Steve. Kids! We have to make sacrifices.”
Tony pushed Steve out of the sitting room. He was about to charge back in when he stopped himself. Looking around, Steve saw pieces of furniture floating in the air, Maria Hill rising up as well.
me. Hoping to take down two birds with one stone? Why stop with HYDRA when Tony Stark was just sitting a couple blocks down the road?”
Stane sighed, pacing the length of the office. “What about Hammer? I know you weren’t alone in this.”
Steve forced himself not to look around his surroundings. He knew he wouldn’t find anything. “You know,” he sighed, “if this is one big elaborate plan just to accuse me of these murders, I’m going to be pissed.”
Getting no response, Tony turned the handle slightly, peeking his head in. He wasn’t exactly sure what state Steve was in, but after everything that happened today, and with what was to come, he needed Steve more than ever. He had planned on coming up earlier, but he’d been stuck on the phone for hours, talking with both Pepper, and then Fury.
Tony stopped his movements and looked at him with a raised eyebrow, not doubt amused by his awkwardness. He seemed to take pity on Steve, however, stepping closer as well. Steve was just about to put his hands around Tony’s hips when a shrill chirp sounded through the room. Tony sighed, letting his forehead fall onto Steve’s chest. Blindly, he reached behind him, his hand wandering aimlessly across the table for his phone. Steve snorted, pulling Tony closer as he reached his own arm out, pushing the phone into Tony’s questing hand.
It wasn’t long before Steve felt himself get lost in the music, bloods singing with his newest injection of serum.
“Ugh, fine!” The smaller man drew a hand through his hand and yanked at the ends violently. “Fine, just,” he sighed deeply again. “Just not here. You know I love a good scandal darling, but we’re in public, and- ”
Tony didn’t even deem that with a response. Since he’d finally fallen into ‘compliance’, his role as daily play thing had decreased immensely. Of course, that didn’t stop Tony from flinching every time the door was thrust open. “I’m behaving now,” Tony spat with distain. “I’m doing what they ask.”
“Why couldn’t Barnes be as well behaved as you,” Tony huffed, placing a now empty mug on his coffee table and following Sam to the door.
Not that he was worried. Worried happened when he and Yinsen fumbled a prototype together is the stinking sewers of New York’s underground. This would be a cake walk.
