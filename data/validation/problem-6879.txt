"Oh! That… that's definitely something I can look up. I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, it's just that this is the worst time for such a huge order, I-. Not your problem. Okay, first order came in on a Saturday, I remember that much. It can't have been long after the Spring festival. Everyone gets flowers around that time but this was all to one place-. Okay. February 13th is when the first order for Stark Industries came in."
"I hate you. I am actually going to take those arrows and snap them all over my knee like a bundle of sticks. I'll strangle you with your own bow for good measure!" Steve snapped.
Nothing was poisonous, nothing was hidden in the notes, nothing about these flowers were dangerous save for the mysterious benefactor.
“Yeah yeah, I don’t know why you think that’s still funny. Anyway, I’m asking because he likes your rambling but he hasn’t gotten anything done since the start of class so you might have to take it slow, y’know, ease him into all this, maybe get some food every few sessions, the usual.”
“What’s it to you?” Steve grumbled. Apparently, Rhodey spread tales of his imminent demise at the hands of failure.
Fury left the room without saying anything further, which didn't give the Avengers much incentive to stick around.
“Ah, for you… just sit there and look stunned like you usually do, only make sure he can see it. And maybe show him that notebook. He’d stick around for the whole year if you did that.” Rhodes snickered.
“Oh, that’s a great sign! He loves hopeless. Means he can impress you with bullshit. He’s not going to, of course.” She snorted when she noticed to look on his face. “He needs you to pass that class. This is good! You might get a date out of him yet.”
Steve did not shape up. He couldn’t help himself. There was no way in hell that guy was talking sense, especially since the guy was right and he didn’t really belong here. What was he doing, anyway? There’s still three-fourths of the semester left, he should go to Erskine and quit while he’s ahead.
The fast-paced atmosphere fir the mood for the night because Tony was quizzing Steve for the upcoming test. Some of it would be multiple choice but this time there would be diagrams, so Steve would actually have to know what he’s doing. He does, surprisingly enough. Tony’s study sessions have really helped, and Steve’s even been able to get through the lectures with more coherent notes.
Steve had no idea where he was going to find Tony, but at least this looked like a place he would want to be.
“Fuck off, Rhodey, have you seen the curves that boy draws? No way he’s as hopeless as you and Carol think, he’s got to have something between the ears.”
“You mean you’re not sick of pizza?” Tony cackled. “But yeah, let’s do that. Want anyone else to be there?”
“But you want to find him.” Sheila confirmed. “That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? I don’t know how much help the shop can be.”
"Okay, now I've got to know. You're keeping something from me and clearly it's on purpose!" Tony crowed, eyes bright with the eagerness of solving at least one mystery.
“Yeah, yeah…” Steve muttered. He should probably have asked Erskine more questions before he went along with this class.
“No, seriously, that last test was not easy. And you actually got some of the questions that everyone missed, even Carol and I. Those study dates are paying off.”
“He’d probably be willing to tutor you on this stuff. Hell, he’s tutor half the class, if they let him. He’s a total pushover if you know how to ask.”
“Well, artists have to use the same tools we do, for some projects, just on a smaller scale. If anyone can get Steve Rogers to pass this mind-numbing class, it’s me.”
"Exceptions, Steve, exceptions. As it turns out, leaving the game doesn't mean burning all your bridges."
“Huh.” Several things clicked into place and he nodded. “Okay. Well, we keep going out for study sessions so why not stay in this time? Watch a movie or something? We could order pizza or something.”
"Dinner sounds like the best idea I've heard all day. You gonna cook or should I break out my best disguise?"
"What? God, no! I heard that was all over the news, but c'mon, Romanoff, where would I get that kind of money? Besides, how could you go wrong with some chocolate and maybe a sketch or two."
The poor kid beside him was in over his head, a freshman to his junior and Tony’s sophomore. Granted, the only reason Tony was allowed to be a sophomore is that he was a bonafide genius. Well, enough of one to skip most of the early-level classwork required of his degree track.
Steve’s never heard anybody call Nat ‘baby’. He’s surprised she doesn’t kick him in the gonads for it.
Once again, Tony’s the first one to hang up, and Steve feels like an absolute idiot. He tells himself he did the right thing and wanders back toward the sound of young, politically ambitious anthropoid millennials. He puts his phone on silent before shoving his phone back into his pocket.
At the last second, Steve reaches for Tony’s hand in the dingy hallway outside the small faux brass-crested dining hall.
Tony leans against the back of the elevator as the doors shut in front of him, and he smiles, “You’re the best, JARVIS.”
“After your meeting with the New York Women’s Association, you have your Stark Industries lunch,” Nat says, sounding so ever nonchalant, but waiting with a baited grin as Steve drops his pen at the familiar name.
When she finishes reading off the detailed schedule, Nat pointedly clears her throat, “And that’s all for today. We’ll end the night at a hotel in Jersey. Got all that?”
Steve grins, that old Brooklyn thing that he keeps in the back drawers of himself like a secret little thing. On impulse, he grabs Tony’s hand and tugs him to a nearby table.
God, this job. She’s worked on the campaigns for politicians and entrepreneurs all over the globe, all across America. Natasha Romanoff has destroyed entire reputations with a nod of her head and built others from absolutely nothing like a power hungry god. But working for Steve Rogers was different. Never before had she so completely believed in somebody. Never had she even wanted to believe in somebody. Today, she’s proud of him. Usually, she’s just proud of herself. But this time, she’s proud of Steve Rogers more than anything else.
Tony gives Steve the address to a coffee shop he’s never heard of. The soonest Tony can fit it into his schedule is after the new year. Steve’s wide open all through Christmas, but he lies and fibs some appointments and lunches when he talks to Tony.
When Steve wakes up, Nat tells him the updated schedule for the next week, and he doesn’t question it, just smiles, thanks her, and makes his way back to the press cabin to see if anybody has any questions he can answer before they land.
In one terrifying moment, Steve remembers tugging his suit jacket over his shoulders and being rushed out the back door of his hotel only a few hours before. Nat, with a clip board in her hand, briefs him on the most important people to schmooze that night.
The rest of the lunch goes unnecessarily well. Tony goads Steve into trying something a little out of his comfort zone, and Tony himself orders a decadent plate of avocado toast. Tony makes Steve almost feel at home among the sharp angles and cramped corners. Tony has a way of making even shiny, white vinyl surroundings seem like the buffet table at a small town rally.
“Uh, hey, Stevie,” Bucky manages as Sam hauls him off the bathroom floor, “What’s up? We were just, uh- checking the structural integrity of your doors. Yeah, that. Your privacy is so important to us.”
Nat looks very self-satisfied as she reaches across and steals a spoonful of his cereal. Steve’s reading the paragraph on last night’s event, the one typed neatly around a picture of Steve shaking hands with a local celebrity, his suit tugging against his biceps in the direction of being too tight of a fit, when Bucky and Sam collapse into chairs at the table next to Steve and Nat.
“Ah, no, thank you. I don’t -“ Tony starts, for the first time seeming awkward and uncomfortable, and Steve wants to hit his head against the table.
If she could be convinced that he would never marry at all, she believed she could be heartbroken but perfectly satisfied that they would remain a spinster and a cantankerous bachelor in friendship until the end. She was aware now, that she would never take another, not when she was so brought so intimately to the conclusion that she loved him. And so if he did the same, the same Captain Rogers to the world, stayed at Donwell and visited often as he was wont to do, she could bear it. She’d make sure of it.
She felt churlish enough that when he protested her departure from his company, telling her to stay with him, that she ignored his words and continued down the hill to take in the view alone.
“You will see her to advantage; to see her and hear her – no, I’m afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has an aunt that never holds her tongue!” Antonia giggles, quickly curtailing it as she notices her mother’s admonishing glance.
that Tony’s feeding him underneath it, enough to nearly make his eyes roll back in his head with the sensation of it. He gets one quick flicker of determination from Tony before his love pushes the oversized sweatshirt off his shoulders fully, lets it fall loudly in the heavy silence. He’s only wearing a baggy pair of sweatpants underneath that hang low on his hips, exposing a happy trail that Steve wants to lean forward and
She felt all the honest pride and complacency of a woman in alliance with the present proprietor, like Donwell was a second home rather than the household of a friend. Its ample gardens stretched down to meadows washed by a stream. The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike it, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular unlike the manicured lawns of her own household. The house was just as it ought to be; willful, sprawling, yet with a backbone of character much like its owner. She wandered about the estate in perfect happiness for as long as she dared before it was necessary to join the others.
“Is that, is that a-“ He can’t get the words out, “Is that a Pollock?” Immediately drawn to it, he barely hears Tony’s reply.
Steve’s at his side before he can blink, “No problem, Tony. I’m here. I’ll stay. I promise.” He folds one of Tony’s hands in his, interlocking their fingers and letting the heat of him bleed through their shared contact, “I’ll be right here, you just go to sleep.”
in the back of his mind. Every hit Steve takes Tony can feel under his skin, feel his blood thrum with it, with the unseen caveman want to protect his mate to the ends of the earth.
“Whaddya mean, what do I think?” Steven rumbles in reply. It’s like boulders crashing, like a wave breaking across Tony’s calves, foaming around his ankles. He wants to swim in it, wants to feel it against his ears, wants to hear it over and over again. Tony
Miss Virginia ‘Pepper’ Potts was the natural daughter of somebody. Someone had placed her in Mrs May’s care a few years back, and her beauty and intelligence had shone through to the interest of Highbury. That, however, was all that was generally known of her history. Despite their similarities, Antonia did not spend as much time as she wished in the girl’s company. Pepper had been away, as far as Antonia had been aware, to see some of her friends in the country who had been at school there with her. She walked toward the camp of Miss Hill, Mrs May and Antonia with a shy gait that Antonia was forever trying to train out of her.
as his boyfriend. The look on Fury’s face when Steve turned in the official paperwork to sign off on them dating was possibly the best moment in Tony’s life.
Steve fills out every square inch of the khaki suit to perfection, trousers pressed within an inch of their life and the medals pinned on the left hand side are polished to shining. What Tony can’t get over, however, is the aviators perched on Steve’s head haphazardly like he’s pushed them up and forgotten about them throughout the day. Which, knowing how distracted Steve can get by drawing the New York sunset, is probably exactly what happened.
“Hey, Mr Stark,” He says cheerily, “Welcome back to New York. Take a seat. Make yourself comfortable.”
Steve hasn’t even introduced his product yet, hell he hasn’t even pitched its name and the unlaughable sea creature is laughing like a banshee at open mic night. He has zero clue what’s going on, much less why. He resists the urge to tug on his collars, scuff his shoes, do anything that could reveal how absolutely fucking
“Oh, well in that case, he should be exonerated of all offenses, your honor. We have an innocent man here.”
Steve smiles, looking almost shy like he could bend in on himself if he really tried, “It really is my pleasure, Mr Stark. It’s an honor to work with somebody doing good work like you.”
Steve Rogers. Tony recognizes the name. Hell, anybody who’s ever opened a magazine or watched the highlights reel of an Academy Award red carpet has stared in awe at his work. Steve has been revolutionizing the fashion industry for decades now. Known for his extremely private life and his deceptively youthful appearance (seriously the guy looks decades younger than he actually is- he’s been accused of sorcery on multiple occasions), Steve Rogers’ word is basically gospel in the fashion industry nowadays. What he says goes and nobody questions it.
They’re silent then, tucked together. Steve’s ass presses against what is arguably the most important desk in North America. They watch a small crew of gardeners trim a sparse grouping of neat topiaires in the impending dusk light, and if Steve really listens he can hear the Secret Service agents stationed just outside the office whispering Steve and Tony’s freshly appointed code names into their walkies. If he shuts it all off, focuses on the gentle way Tony exists around him in that moment, Steve almost feels normal.
Almost completely formed around anonymous sources’ sourceless conjecture, Tony finds just about no truth in the article, but he spends an inordinate amount of time staring at the juxtaposition of pictures laid out for him before he pulls out his phone.
Tony feels something warm bubble up into his stomach. Something like fondness (or maybe just hunger. He hasn’t eaten since dinner with Pepper last night before he buried himself in his workshop. He should probably get on that). He clears his throat.
All his life, Tony had always preferred the blistering Cali sun and waves to the endless concrete of the New York skyscape, but his own name branded into the sky is certainly a warm invitation of return.
“Please? Steve, I want to talk about this. I thought we- I thought we had something. Talking to you, it's not like how it is with most people. You make me laugh and smile for real. And you’re incredible, and I want to talk about this. Please.”
“Yes,” Tony looks down at his notes then back up at Steve with a grin, “I want to give you exactly what you asked for. no change in dollar amount, no change in equity, plain and simple.”
She throws a granola bar at him and turns on her heel to find Steve, “Clean yourself up, Bucky,” She calls over her shoulder, “You’re a mess.”
Pepper does not stop smiling smugly, she can’t. Instead she all but skips out of Tony’s office, leaving with a wink as she reaches the door, shutting it behind her.
“Ooh, does Natty have a crush?” Tony butts his way back in. He bumps his shoulder amiably with Nat’s, “Want me to send a dozen roses to their hotel room?”
The guy pauses with a neat little canapé halfway to his mouth, jaw dropped open, and his eyes grow nervously, “Uh, who are you?”
Tony watches Steve for a moment, head down, eyes dark and thoughtful. Tony can deal with surprises. Surprises are fine. Occasionally, surprises are even great. Like when Pepper calls and tells him she doesn’t feel like going to Paris right now, she’s too busy, oh Tony won’t you please be my hero and go to a romantic, faraway European city in my place? A good surprise. Tony can deal.
Tony can’t tear his eyes off of Steve, like the rest of the world but even luckier. He nods his head, “Yeah, I remember.”
“Falling in love with you,” Tony says, pauses, voice low and sincere and bright all at the same time, lips drifting toward a low spot on Steve’s jaw, “Was the biggest mistake of my life.”
They’re in Oregon for three days, and by the end of it the so-called Oregon-ans have all but fallen in love with Steve Rogers.
Iron Man lands on the beach, one knee to the sand and a fist punching down to balance himself, a tsunami of little kids’ sandcastles blasting out from behind him like a violent dress train, when he tells JARVIS to put Steve back on.
“I’ll have my people contact you then,” Tony says as he slips the papers back into his front pocket.
Nat’s answering silence makes Steve feels like he itches all over. He tosses the button from one hand to the other and ignores her pointed glare.
“Steve then.” He says in return, and their eyes catch on each other, snag, and tangle in a way that makes the air feel a million times warmer. “I appreciate you might feel that what I am here to do goes against your highly individualistic security here. But there is a reason we were hired by Miss Potts, a reason you are genuinely interested in our recommendations despite what your mouth might say. And with all due respect, I’d like to see it through. My team are
“Antonia, I pray you do not make any matches; your scheming is beyond the likes of poor Highbury.” Her mother chided gently one evening.
“Or wish that I behaved as I should. But I promise you, I would never to do anything to injure Miss Romanov in any way. But if Mr. Barton was attached to Miss Romanov in any way, which he is not I assure you, he would never – he”
So that had happened, and it was amidst the dust and rubble with Clint cackling in his ear and Natasha muttering about stupid idiots who should learn to drive their fancy machinery that Tony realised he was several shades of fucked.
She was the only child of a most affectionate and indulgent mother; and had, as such, the use of their sprawling household as she saw fit. Hartfield was a large estate, and her mother often commented on how she brought movement and noise into it, the lifeblood of its brick walls. Her father had died too long ago for him to be any more than a whisper of a thought; and his place had been supplied by an excellent man as household butler Jarvis, who had fallen little short of a father in affection.
“Now I will tell you something, in return for what you have told me. He did speak yesterday, or indeed he wrote, and was refused.” She shrugged, and made to move across the room. That flower arrangement by the portrait of her parents needed fixing to be sure.
It’s possibly the weirdest group combination, but they make it work, this little ragtag team of leftovers who bond over the shared determination that this earth has more to give them than it has offered them in the past. And the bond of competitiveness over card games.
“I hope you did not venture far, Miss Romanov, this morning, or I am sure you must have been wet – We scarcely got home in time. I hope you turned directly.”
No, she’s blind to all this. Powerless to do anything but stand in abject confusion, stomach churning as butterflies dancing across her ribcage. She feels like there has been a polemic shift in her heart, but she can’t pin down for what reason. All she knows is that she would have gladly spent hours in the embrace of Steve’s arms, and she’s scared to examine too closely why that is.
The picture she gazed upon was indeed flattering. It had been painted not long after Steven’s conscription had ended, in fact if she recalled he had been released not a day earlier for returning. Antonia remembers nothing but profound gratitude for the Almighty as she flung her arms around him on the steps of Hartfield, and her mother ushering them both in with tears in her eyes.
Starks eyes flash something painful, “I made an exception for blood. Turns out they lied, it’s not thicker than water.”
He moves closer, slowly, giving her every opportunity to push him away, but Antonia finds herself loathe to do anything but wait for his arrival with pursed lips and heavy eyelids. She can practically count every eyelash. Yet suddenly, the moment is shattered between them as the far off sound of a door closing breaks into their reverie. Steven’s hand drops, and he quickly steps back, Antonia having to will her body not to follow him into his intoxicating space again.
“Oh, no I did not ever! I am sorry to hear we’ve mistaken one another.” Pepper cries, turning away distressed.
“I’ll follow your lead.” He says, heartbreakingly firm and honest, and Tony feels like he means it as more than just leaving an extra 100 in the hotel room.
The Picture (for it was of such worth it was permanently capitalized in her head), elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr. Hammer’s return from London. Being hung over the mantelpiece in the common sitting-room, when he visited next he looked at it thoroughly, sighing out sentences of admiration just as he ought. As for Virginia’s feelings, Antonia could visibly see them forming into a strong and steady attachment as her youth and timidity allowed. Before long, Antonia was thoroughly satisfied of Mr. Rhodes erosion from Virginia’s mind, and replaced with a contrast of Mr. Hammer.
“He, uh-“ Steve stands up abruptly, chair scraping against the floor. Nat is able to physically see him searching for his escape around the cramped lobby. He turns in the direction of the elevator, “We just talked. About the campaign. It was- it was nothing.”
Steve looks up, mouthful of cereal, to find Nat standing there, arms crossed, hip popped, smug smile. Her hair is pulled back into an impeccable ponytail. Steve knows she’s already been up for hours, like him.
JARVIS gets Tony to where he needs to be in the early morning- a swanky uptown hotel at which Steve and his employees have secured an over-the-top suite for Tony to get ready in. Steve’s already waiting for him when Tony gets there.
“Your suit’s done. For the gala. I wanted to set a time for you to come up and try it on so we could tailor it within the next couple of weeks.”
“I know I like the product,” Tony says simply, eyes never leaving steve’s entrepreneurial take on a parade rest. Steve kinda feels like his throat is closing up. Barton continues to bicker.
“Yeah, yeah, I know,” Tony breathes out as he collapses onto another surface that Steve can only imagine, “I’ve always been more of a night owl. Mornings aren’t exactly my thing. You can get much more done at night.”
“I will,” Steve promises, despite the adrenaline thrumming through his veins. He’s here, really here. It feels incredible, “Night, Nat.”
Tony smiles up at the redheads, innocent in every way of the word except the actual definition, a twinkle in his eye, “Oh lookie. It’s our two favorite matchmakers, huh?”
Steve stands up quickly, the chair pushing back noisily against the linoleum floor tiles. He tries, and fails, to sound breezy when he says Tony’s name, “Tony, how are you?”
“I don’t understand,” He moans, leaning as hard as he can against the spout of the darkest roast coffee, “How aren’t you hungover? You know, there’s a rumor in my family that my great-great-great grandma was a witch. You could be like her. Nat, are you my grandma? Are you a witch?”
Tony cups his hand around the screen of his phone as he glimpses at the caller ID in the sunlight. It’s a New York number, but no contact info. Having spent the last six months very publicly in Malibu, he knows it’s not somebody looking for a quick brunch, but the lack of a caller ID indicates it’s not somebody from SI. Tony returns the phone to his ear, letting his eyes close against the sunlight.
Steve clears his throat again. He suddenly feels like an imbecile, but he latches onto Nat’s voice in his head.
And with that, Tony takes off at a jog, palms outstretched, and red metals chunks soar in from all angles to collect around his body. At the last second, he bends his knees, the last piece clicks into place, and Iron Man kicks off into the night sky.
As Tony releases his grip on Steve’s collar, he sits himself neatly back into his seat, grinning. Steve’s brain appears to have stopped working, an amusing sight that Tony wants to make happen over and over and over again.
Tony grins and stands up, and Steve knows he made the right choice. When Tony moves in to hug him, Steve is able to see the way Nat sits back in her high-backed leather seat looking entirely.... pleased?
They’re silent and each man is at a loss to do anything besides stare at the open mouth visage opposite them and Steve is positive that the 16 year old drowning in AP Chem notes at the table behind them definitely snuck a picture of that goddamn kiss.
It’s absurd. The guy’s at his campaign rally and he has no idea who he is. Steve’s pretty sure Nat had put a life size cutout of himself at the entrance. Steve gives up, and lets his smile fizzle into something Sam would snipe at: a full grin. Nat always says he looks more like somebody’s baseball-playing brother than a presidential candidate when he grins like this, but he can’t help it. This guy is truly absurd. It’s refreshing.
That night, Steve gets an hour of rest, and Nat realizes then and there that it’s her job to get him out of this funk of his before he works himself dead. Fuckin’ Steve Rogers. Sleep is hard enough to come by as is, now she’s gotta knock the insomnia out of him.
Steve’s noticeably better after that. He kills in Jersey, Nat inches in an extra ten minutes for his nap, and his general attitude is miles better now that he’s realized he’s not a bad politician just because he has feelings.
When Nat is briefing the leading campaign advisors about the itinerary for the upcoming week, she reminds Steve about his lunch with Tony Stark, and Nat and Bucky both watch the way Steve momentarily tenses then overcompensates in trying to appear normal. It gives more insight into Steve’s mood than anything else has in the past week.
“Uh, hey, there’s a very scary looking redhead coming this way. I’d very much appreciate it if you didn’t tell her that I just used two different words that she’s allowed to slap me for using in front of donors.”
- fine. Just one sec. Can I put you on hold? It’ll be quick. Promise. JARVIS cue boogie playlist for our guest, Kay?”
Tony rushes through his demolition of the gross, now-armless sea monster so as not to let a fashion god waiting. The monster makes a bellowing death cry as its armless head falls helplessly into the ocean, its arms already sinking fast to the bottom ahead of it.
His hands fidget with the heavy menu. He tells himself that the soupy feeling filling his stomach is just hunger. He hadn’t been allowed to eat any of the food at the pancake breakfast after all, and it had smelled so incredible. It’s just hunger. Seriously. His knee bounces up and down too.
And then there’s soft spoken Steve Rogers, impassioned entrepreneur with a heart of gold and a tangible passion for what he does. He also just so happens to be Tony Stark’s exact type, but if you ask one Bruce Banner he will deny any implications about that until the day he’s thrown off the set of the show for working too much.
“Hey,” Steve says, trying not to sound breathless as he leans against a beige, wallpapered corner, “What can I do for you, Mr Stark?”
It’s truly a miracle that he manages to get himself alone for five minutes to call Tony. Nowadays, it feels like there are campaign assistants (both male and female alike) following him into his bathroom and closet and bedroom, demanding him to sign on dotted lines or re-reminding him of important things that Steve usually remembers anyway. He’s pretty sure Nat had something to do with this unprecedented stroke of privacy. Even in the bathroom of his personal hotel room, he’s not used to absolute privacy in the middle of the morning. He counts himself lucky nonetheless and dials the number.
“Hey, guys,” Steve says, as close to mumbling as a guy who speaks day-in-day-out in emblazoned speeches can get (he spoke like that before the campaign too, though the random feeling of wanting to follow the guy into a fiery abyss is more obvious nowadays, more direct and also more than a tad intentional), “Sorry I’m late. Off morning, I guess.”
Steve isn’t thinking. He takes one looks at the soft, inviting nature of Tony’s pout, and he directly shuts the door in his face. Tony isn’t able to stop the door this time.
He’s been friends with Steve a long, long time. He’s probably known the guy longer than any other living human. He’s never seen Steve act like that. Nat, to her credit, is just as shocked as Bucky.
“I- I have some things to say. And I know you probably don’t want to hear them because the last time I had things to say they weren’t what you wanted to hear. I shouldn’t have said any of that stuff, Tony. I’m sorry.”
Steve tries to play dumb, but it doesn’t really work. He considers fleeing, but they’re standing outside waiting for
They both know what he’s talking about. He’s talking about the homophobic, “outside-of-wedlock” cursing, naysaying assholes that decorate social media with their threats and accusations. To these people, Steve lives an unlawful life that makes him unfit to be president. To most, though, it makes Steve a real person who just wants to love. They usually ignore those people.
“I’ll be back later,” Steve promises, “I have some work to do, and I have to get dolled up myself, but I promise I’ll be here for the big reveal.”
They’re in Vermont when the tabloids pick up on Steve and Tony’s relationship. He’d asked Tony if he wanted to join him for a dinner honoring kids from all over New England who were exemplary in STEM fields. The kids were even more excited to hear Tony talk (who came as a surprise to both the young’uns and their starstruck parents) than they had been at the prospect of dining with Steve.
“Ugh, fine,” Tony groans, doing a loop-di-loop in the air and slicing one of the grabby tentacles in half with his repulsors. Only seven more to go, “Patch em through.”
The address Nat texts him turns out to be one of those pricey, swanky New York brunch joints that are only open until 2 in the afternoon. It’s all clean, white surfaces and ninety degree angles. Steve’s never been here before, never even heard of it. He takes a shallow breath as he reaches for the long, silver door handle and enters the restaurant.
Tony waves at him from the line, holds up a single finger that Steve inherently knows means one sec, be right there, and Steve watches with held breath as Tony orders the largest black coffee the shop offers.
Right there on the street. In front of the whole goddamn world. Not just a couple of starving artist millennials trying to drown themselves in coffee. In front of the birds and the bees and the wandering eyes of New York busy bodies. They’re in upper Manhattan, midday, absolutely
“I mean, if you had your choice, you’d be getting lunch from that $2 hot dog stand over there and mingle among the natives and the tourists alike while you all got food poisoning together.”
Instead of a response, Steve just… exhales. It’s super lame, but his mind’s gone numb. He’s supposed to be this brilliant leader, but here he is rendered speechless by a single look. He tells himself to get over it. Then reminds himself he doesn’t have to.
Tony must’ve had to travel all the way to Shitsville, Jersey to find him. Steve can’t imagine the trouble that would’ve been.
Steve moves around to turn the hose on, hands fidgeting idly with the various cords of his new toy. It looks vaguely like madness to Tony, but Steve looks like a kid who got the coolest new toy.
Steve’s needless silence is answer enough, smiling like an idiot up at the outdated lighting fixtures of the hotel bathroom.
When he finally trips out, tugging his suit jacket straight with one hand and curling his fingers into the backs of his shoes, otherwise barefoot, he’s surprised that Steve’s still in the room, “Oh, hey. Is there something else we need to do?”
“Hey, in all seriousness,” Tony says, grabbing at Steve’s biceps, “If this is something you’re interested in doing, I can talk to Pepper about having one of her landscaper friends call us, and he can give you some recommendations. We can plant some more stuff out front if you want and-“
Tony hesitates, but nods. He grabs his jacket and heads for the door, “Sure, Rogers. If it really, truly makes you happy,” He’s got a wicked grin, and he winks at the door, “Arent you coming?”
“You should get some sleep soon,” Nat says, skirting the passage between the president’s and the chief-of-staff’s office.
Then Nat offers twice as much cash for the same equity as Steve first asked for, and Tony visibly flinches beside her. Tony immediately triples his offer.
“A chance?” Tony honest-to-god snorts, this good natured, sarcastic humor that wiggles all the way through Steve’s body like a ghost or a gust of wind, takes root in Steve’s toes and sets up shop high in his chest, “Steve, you’re gonna blow this election out of the water. You’re gonna dominate.”
Nat shakes her head, “Go without me,” She insists, and Steve feels like he’s being backed into a corner with sticky mortar and porcelain bricks, “It’ll be fine.”
“Yep,” Steve nods, and Tony doesn’t miss the way his cheeks redden as he focuses on the strand of sewing tape he winds around his forefinger, “I want it to be a surprise.”
They notice. Of course they notice. Steve’s been late for a lot of things lately while they’ve been on the road. Things get pushed back, more supporters show up than expected, reporters ask questions even when they’re told the last one has already been asked. And the traffic that Steve’s growing motorcade causes is a time killer of its own devices. But Steve’s morning routine? It’s sacred. Hell, Steve’s almost got it timed down to the minute. He just isn’t late to it, ever.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says quickly, “It sounds like it’s a bad time. So sorry for bothering you, Mr Stark. I-“
Another camera turns onto him for his final talking head and on off-screen producer asks him how he feels about the deal. Steve can’t help it, he beams.
Steve rolls his eyes, beckons Tony to his side of the desk with an outstretched arm, “C’mere, weirdo.”
Steve isn’t sure at all what takes over him. They’re surrounded on all sides by millennials and teenagers with their noses stuck in laptop keyboards and cell phone message boards, all people culturally conscious enough to be highly aware that infamous exes Captain America and Iron Man are having an openly public meeting right in front of them. Steve does it anyway, despite himself. He needs to feel that smile one last time.
Tony’s voice is almost a whisper, and he can’t seem to look away from the blurry, photographic spread, “Thank you.”
He goes out back, grabs a white plastic lounge chair and sets himself up in the front yard with Steve. They spend the entire day like that in the sweating sunshine. Tony lounges, watches his husband, even briefly falls asleep in the sunshine, while Steve works hard and sneaks looks at his sleepy husband lounging under the sun.
“Hey, JARVIS?” Tony says distractedly, busy side-eyeing the swarm of journalists with their pointy heels sinking into the sand tripping over themselves to get to the Iron Man, “Uh, let’s go to the mansion before this gets messy, yeah? We have a flight to prepare for.”
Nat and Sam and Bucky and Steve fly across the country. Steve shakes hands, crowds chant his name. He rotates viciously through three near-identical blue striped ties, just as he’s done throughout the whole campaign. Voting day feels like it’s rounding the corner on its third lap around the track, coming up on them from behind. During the short time allotted for breakfast every day, the three close advisors quiz Steve on topics for the upcoming debates instead of letting the candidate read his newspaper. They drive Steve to campaign events and photo ops and homeless shelters where he smiles and shakes hands and has meaningful conversations off-camera.
Except when she mentions Tony. Which, yeah, he still laughs it off, sure. But Nat knows Steve well enough, and Bucky knows Steve even better. It’s not his Nat-socks-Bucky-in-the-eye-with-a-bag-of-peanuts laugh that they’re so well acquainted with. It’s the laugh that they trained into him, scientifically perfected the pitch-to-smile-widening ratio for maximum donor affect.
Bucky coughs and accidentally sends Sam’s green apple diving for the floor. It feels like slow motion as two more sets of eyes swivel from the fleeing fruit right back to Steve. Their matching grins are absolutely cruel.
Bucky and Sam bicker the whole way out of the hotel lobby, throwing out the remains of Sam’s apple as they pass a trash can and refilling Bucky’s styrofoam cup as they pass the coffee station. Nat stays completely still, one leg crossed over the other, tablet perched primly in her lap, and the two of them watch in silence as the shiny elevator doors close on the bickering mostly-professionals.
“You wouldn’t have to dress me this time,” Tony promises offhandedly, as if he didn’t know that Steve absolutely loved dressing Tony Stark, that it’s wasn’t a huge honor and kinda a dream, “But I think we could have a nice time anyway.”
There’s a disconcertingly strong scent of tiquewood potpourri embedded beneath the vague scent of food. The apathetic host wears an equally subdued grey tie, contrasted only by the small, pride flag pin stuck to his breast pocket. His name tag reads ‘DYLAN :)’. He doesn’t seem all that impressed to see Steve.
“You put your whole life on hold to save the rest of the world. It’s not fair of people to blame you for something you’re trying to stop.”
In the long timeline that the two of them have worked together, Nat has said an entire encyclopedia of words and speeches to him backwards and forwards. She’s cursed at him like a trucker on steroids and carefully nursed his ego as if it was her very own newborn baby. She’s never said that.
The soulmark on his collarbone is scalding, and his stomach twists when he looks down on Steven Rogers for the first time. Broad shouldered, cream skinned and golden haired, he’s gorgeous in a way that’s as easy as breathing. There’s something sits behind his ear to tell him this man is important, pushes his heart into double time.
“I am delighted to hear you so moved on regarding the subject,” replied Antonia, smiling; “but you do not mean to deny that there was a time – and not so distant – when you gave me reason to believe you did care about him.”
I am.” His voice breaks on the last words, “You deserve better. Do you know there are days I wash my hands until they bleed because I can still see the blood of my friends on them?” it’s too honest, too raw. But it’s all he knows. Here, he says, look under the hood, see enough to scare you off and let me lick my wounds in peace.
and god Steve would lay waste to the rest of this world if someone dared to take it from them. Howard and Obadiah tried, once. They did not succeed.
Steven spoke very little of his own family, the destruction that littered his birth and upbringing. The scythe followed his lineage, followed his friends, closely and furiously. What little he let slip out in a puzzle only slowly unweaving itself even now to Antonia, was nothing but full of love and praise. How very callous of her to suggest.
” Antonia seems unable to do much but repeat herself. “It appeared to me to relate to a different person, for I thought you meant the service Mr. Clint Barton rendered you, in protecting you from the gypsies. I could swear it was even named. I said I did not wonder at your attachment – mentioning even what your sensations must have been in seeing him come forward to your rescue. I remember uttering those exact words.”
As a general rule, Tony’s appearance at Stark Manor only leads to heartache and bruises. It’s par for the course that his next visit is the same.
“Natasha!” Stark beams, opening his arms up like Daddy Warbucks on a sugar high, “Long time no see, baby!”
Steve Rogers does not do things by halves. He did not become one of the most reputable names in fashion by doing things willy nilly. When he said he was going to design Tony’s look for the Met Gala, he meant it, and he meant to make it absolutely jaw-dropping.
Steve’s about to shut that train of thought down completely with a bunch of blinking red lights and a long, checkered gate, patently insist that Nat would never manipulate Steve like that, not at a time as important to the campaign as this. But then he remembers that Nat would
The look that Steve creates for Tony is equally fitting. The basics of it is an all black suit: black jacket, black tie, black shirt, black pants, black shoes. Hell, he’s even got real onyx cufflinks. It’s all very dark and dramatic.
Eventually Tony does find Steve. He follows the loud beeping to the front driveway and finds Steve directing a dumpster backing it’s way up the driveway. Steve guides the truck closer and closer to the house, waving his arms like an airway controller. Tony can hear the tinge of his Brooklyn accent emphasized when he calls out over the noise of the huffing truck to the driver, “
“Oh yes,” Steve says offhandedly, somehow simultaneously sounding nervous while also manhandling complete control of the conversation, “Would you agree if I invited you to the Met Gala this year?”
Steve knows and understands Tony better than he has any right to, way better than somebody who’s been on one and a half dates with a man who spends most of the year on the other side of the country has any business understanding. Even without being there, he catches the meaning of Tony’s silence.
“Oh yeah? I didn’t get the sense that this guy was one of us. Got the whole innocent, patriotic thing going on. He better at hiding it than me?”
“Steve?” Tony echoes. He sounds just as breathless as Steve feels. Tony looks around the room and cracks a smile, “I think they did it again.”
Steve pulls his phone away from his face to check the time, and he laughs, “Tony, it’s almost noon.”
Steve has one hand curled around the cab door handle as he waits patiently. There’s a small part of him that will wait patiently for Tony Stark for the rest of his life, “I said I was sorry, you-“
“Well you shouldn’t have worn designer jeans while we’re painting, Tony,” Steve retorts lightheartedly, as if it was obvious. He punctuates it with a succinct peck on the lips.
“Pepper likes you,” The guy gestures vaguely with his canapé toward the crowd. Steve sees nothing but formalwear and faux smiles, but the canapé at least seems to have a general line of sight. Steve, even with nothing to go on, finds himself scanning cruelly for the mysterious Pepper.
That is, until he’s five miles off the California coastline, hanging over the Pacific Ocean with a tentacle-clad  sea monster hissing at him from below, and JARVIS tells him he’s got a call.
Beside Clint, billionaire Maria Hill has her hands in almost every money-making industry that exists in the modern world. From food, to real estate, to service, to tchotchke infomercial products, Maria does it all. She and her husband Nicky are best known for building their security company from the ground up, then selling it for billions of dollars. She would almost be as hardcore, furtive, and sharklike as Natasha with her steady, measuring stare if she didn’t have the propensity to laugh uproariously at frivolous products and snicker openly at the other sharks’ bad jokes. Usually when Maria laughs at your product, it means that Thor and Clint will begin a bidding war over your business soon after. A rumor floats through the halls that they do that because she neuro linguistically programmed them to do so- nobody’s quite sure whether or not that’s true.
“Hey, folks,” Tony preens, waving almost sardonically at the mass of paparazzi snapping his picture, the pink carpet spread before him. Steve smiles beside him.
Tony is uncharacteristically quiet. Steve imagines him sitting down somewhere, lets out a long breath, and eventually speaks. There’s a switch flicked on his end too, big and heavy and political like a tired, old wolf, a very convincing, charming facade. It feels a hell of a lot like the fourth brick wall that boxes Steve in.
With the pen victoriously in hand, Steve eventually clears his throat. He tries so hard to sound as offhand and casual as possible, Nat almost feels bad for him.
Tomorrow, Nat will be the chief of staff to the president of the United States, and Tony will have an all-access pass to the White House if he wants. The new improvements to their reputations are the last things on their minds: the small backstage recess is filled with an air of nothing but pride and love.
It takes a lot of combined effort from both Nat and Pepper to eventually get Steve and Tony to be in the same place at the same time. There’s quite a bit of so-called executive assistant jiu-jitsu on both sides, but eventually Nat pushes Steve into an empty private room in a small New York restaurant, and a few minutes later Pepper does the same.
Steve continues his short pacing circuit a couple more times, unable to think of anything else, and eventually shakes his head.
Tony pulls his pointer finger through a clump of paint at his hipbone, and wipes it on Steve’s cheek, “Jerk.”
Later, he’ll get a call. He’ll recognize the number and pick up despite the hour, conspicuously breathless.
The flair of Tony’s look, however, lies in the accessories. Red and gold and often emitting a faint cerulean glow, the litany jewelry covering Tony’s body head to toe gives the intense illusion of levitating about his body, a surreal technological aura that encapsulates the history and power of the Iron Man.
When they meet for the first time, neither has any clue who the other is. Which in and of itself, is actually pretty impressive.
Tony blinks awake and hardly takes a moment to think, reaching out to mindlessly touch at Steve’s jawline, “
No armored, flying suits, no tuxes. Just the two of them at a restaurant that at least tries to be discreet. Less cameras, less paparazzi, less on-lookers. Well, no, that last one isn’t quite true. There’s probably even more nosy on-lookers than a pre-planned, well publicized event considering they’re on a date. But the point still stands.
Tony gets this funny little look on his face, his head cocked, his nose wrinkled, and his grin lopsided and- real. He waves vaguely in Dylan’s direction, then leans against the door with his shoulder and swings out onto the New York street without looking away from Steve with that meaningful face of his.
Steve has his straw wrapper curled up into a tiny little ball that he rolls continuously between his thumb and his forefinger. He avoids Tony’s eyes at all cost, “She wasn’t feeling too great, asked me to go without her. I hope you don't mind.”
On autopilot, Steve shakes his hand. Like a well-trained monkey at the circus. Programmed to shake hands and say nice things about himself.
Nat’s bent over with laughter at the way Steve blushes so innocently in his final interview and how Tony can’t quite look away.
It feels like decades pass over the space between their lips and yet mere seconds before Tony is pulling away, staring. At some point, both of Tony’s hands wrapped around the rolled up sleeves of Steve’s flannel, so even as he sits back down, Steve can’t properly escape what he did.
“Something happened,” Nat whispers, sliding into the seat opposite Sam and Bucky as they fly from one state to another. Steve’s taking his scheduled power nap on the opposite end of the plane. Nat leans closer toward the other advisors, “Do either of you know what happened?”
“You’re not.” Rhodey snorted, amused. “But at least you’re getting something out of this class, even if it is a little eye-candy.”
“The order was sent in through our website through a series of prepaid cards. A different one for each order. And each order insisted on as many arrangements as we could allow per sendout."
"You mean to tell me that you still haven't said anything?" Natasha Romanoff was positively whining as she draped herself over a stoic and rather annoyed Steve Rogers. "I thought that big flower show was yours!"
Tony kept taking him to random places to eat every Thursday. This time, he asked if they could go to a bar. Irish pub, technically. He knew it wouldn’t be anything like the stuff his mother called dinner but it’d be close enough. Indeed, the Black Rose did not disappoint. Or at least it was about what he expected. They got carded but as long as they stayed away from the bar, the bouncer wouldn’t say anything. Steve wasn’t in the mood for alcohol anyway. Steve got bangers and mash and Tony asked for a chicken pot pie. Steve wondered if they were made fresh. His mother loved chicken pot pie but he couldn’t get past the slimy feeling.
Sheila winced, wondering how this situation got so out of hand, and weaved the flower through her braids. Hopefully its message of encouragement and good fortune would rub off on her.
But four classes of this kid practically drooling over his little shit of a brother would not stand. The kid should ship up and ask a question or just plain ship out because he wouldn’t get anywhere doing this.
“I thought I was choosing the next three dates.” Rhodes objected. “That was the deal we made for the bet.”
"Cupid?!" Tony spluttered. "Like the little baby angel guy that shoots arrows at the people they think should fall in love?!"
Some of them went to Tony himself, and Pepper had taken to wearing a different flower in her hair specifically to hear him groan whenever he saw her. It was their newest form of teasing and he loved it as much as she did.
"I figured you'd have something planned out. And I'll have you know that I love receiving flowers. When I know who they're from."
“You are, which will work out in everyone’s favor because you know Tony best. Where does he like to eat?”
“Okay, now you’re projecting. James, look at me.” Carol stopped him and Rhodes turned to face the girlfriend he’d pined so hard for just for her to turn around and act like they’d been going out the entire time. “They will be fine. People can get their own dates without their annoying older brothers interfering. You’ve known that kid since he was, like, ten, so I’ll let you off easy here, but he’s finally got someone his age interested in him. Why not let him have a little fun?”
“Aw, Steve… look, find the guy who was tutoring you. He’ll know what I’m talking about. You should be extra proud of that C, too. Means you can get all your homework done before the year is out.”
“Yep.” Steve yawned. He never understood how Sam Wilson could be such a morning person on maybe six hours of sleep.
“To celebrate! This is an accomplishment, Steve, this class is hard enough for the best Architecture students. They just dumped you in here, no prerequisites or anything, and expect you to pass with flying colors? But you have, and that’s great!”
Steve was lost by his conversation with the professor and just as lost in the boy’s eyes, one chocolate brown and the other crystal blue. He didn’t even know that type of heterochromia was possible in nature, but it looked right at home on this boy. Steve spent the rest of the lecture sketching the boy’s face and writing down every other word he said. He’d look some of it up later. He needed something to bring to Erskine.
This first set were numerous bouquets in all colors and shapes. Some were rare and left alone, some were common and more than happy to leave with a coworker. But they were all thoroughly investigated to no end, and everyone was curious as to who could possibly send such a surprise.
"This… whoever's doing this. It's possible they could be a rival.They might see you as an opponent." Steve wondered.
“I mean, we both have roommates, so whoever’s place we go back to, someone’ll be there. Did you not want them to be?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony grumbled. “Totally not the point, but whatever. We’ve been going out for literal weeks, Steve.”
"Unfortunately, you're going to have to." Fury announced with his usual grim look and annoyed drawl. "It's safe to say that Stark Industries has been the victim of an elaborate scheme made by our next villain, but they're not the only ones taking a fall. And I'm pretty sure they got the nicer end of the spectrum."
Pepper stalked towards the elevators and Steve waited a few minutes before he followed her. Crossing the CEO of anything wasn't a bright idea, but she'd been there long before Stark Industries made the switch to green energy. Clearly, that fire hadn't gone anywhere.
"Just the most annoying. It's a good thing I'm not allergic to flowers, because this past week has already been hell." Tony scoffed, stalking out the door and down the hall.
The wall behind Fury's head parted to reveal a screen full of pictures. Several boxes of chocolates, hundreds of teddy bears, and about as many flowers that Tony could stand were shown in various places.
Steve rolled his eyes and dug around in his pocket to reveal a small black square nestled in his palm.
“You made it!” Tony crowed. “This is my favorite spot, y’know. They have the best burritos. Chipotle-sized but a million times better. You want to order something and then we can get started?”
"That's what we've got so far. You all will be contacted by the members of this task force who can best use your services."
Plenty of names had been struck from the list. Fans had been contacted, employees vetted, colleagues grilled, to little avail. The answer came one dreary afternoon during a briefing on the Avengers' latest foe.
The genius boy, Tony, has a mole under his left eye, the blue one. Not the only blemish on his tanned skin, but the most prominent. This guy’s acne stage really did nothing to him, if he even had one.
“What? He’s a good tutor. You see how he gets up there and basically hogs the conversation, the kid knows what he’s talking about.”
"Them's the breaks." Tony snickered, giving his now-fiance the box. "I'm sorry your surprise got ruined, though I must say I'm looking forward to that dinner a lot more."
And maybe a few others, like how to stop staring hopelessly at the genius boy who is so hopelessly out of your league.
“Ask him a question or two about the homework late on. If you can understand any of the words on the page, Tony’s got you the rest of the way. Just prove that you’re not a lost cause.”
“All’s the better for it, Tony hates posers. Which you’re not. You’re an architecture student, and that takes a lot of engineering, but it also takes a lot of art and angles and knowing what looks good where. There’s a reason you’re here, after all.”
a janitor recalled easily when she came in one day to find a particular bouquet she’d only seen in magazine cut-outs.
This particular set wasn't exactly his favorite flower. Some of his employees took them home but at the end of the day, he was left with an array of blue and white hydrangeas. A quick search revealed that they supposedly meant frigidity, apology, boasting, and bragging. Tony didn't really know what to make of that. Boasting sounded less like someone's well-wishes and more like he was being played. If this fucked wanted to apologize, the best way to do so would be to quit with the godforsaken flowers and perhaps explain all this. Bit of a stretch, considering this had been going on for a few weeks, but it would have been nice.
The ride to the Tower was about as long as it always was, but Steve might as well have given him all the golden tulips he could carry with how pleased Tony was. Steve's goal was to keep that look on his face from as long as they lived.
"Fair enough…" Pepper admitted. "Whatever they're doing, they best wrap this up. As soon as we figure out who they are, we'll be gunning for them."
You’re damn right, you do.” Tony chirped. “Which is why I’ve humbly offered my services. See you, next class, we’ll work out a schedule after that.”
“Oh no, trust me on this one. You’ve been trusting me on everything else. So, where do you want to go?”
"I don't. Never said it was me you were talking about, just that I don't want to hear about flowers."
“All the cheese your heart desires.” Tony drawled. “And I still wanna see what’s in that notebook of yours.”
"Coriander means hidden strength. Everyone knows that Tony is a genius. But what if whoever's doing this thinks the company as a whole is something to stand of its own accord?"
Steve wondered if these flowers would survive a trip outside the building as he joined the security guards inspecting each bouquet. They had the process down, especially since JARVIS was on the case, but they were more than happy to have Captain America's help. Steve was glad to put his nose to good use, and while the flowers reeked, he couldn't detect any of the usual poisons he'd know of and the guards tested each petal they could get their hands on.
"Yeah, at least the fucker deemed my company worthy." Tony grumbled darkly. "Say, what'd the spies get onto you about?"
“Yeah, that was probably a good idea,” Tony grumbled. “Now, show me some vocab skills, what’s up with your notebook?”
“You’ve actually managed to learn something.” Rhodes snorted when the teacher called for a twenty-minute break. This thing was three hours long, as a once-a-week class, but damn if they didn’t deserve every second of that break.
There were enough flowers to fill a shop scattered throughout the lobby. They’d been checked repeatedly for nefarious objects that might have accompanied them, and since there were none, they reached their intended destination without trouble. They started going home with employees, since they always showed up at Stark Industries.
They stopped the day after Tony visited the shop and everyone let out a breath they didn't know they were holding.
Steve couldn’t stop looking at him. He moved fast and he talked faster. Every other word out of his mouth sounded like a foreign language that everyone in this class could understand except for Steve. He belonged on this track. He deserved to be in this class. But… maybe he’d bit off more than he could chew, coming into a two-hundred-level class and expecting it to make sense. It was on his track sheet, and no one said anything about prerequisites. In fact, when he’d talked to his advisor the older man had waved him off and allowed him into the class. On the request that they meet twice a week to make sure Steve was keeping up with the class. He was lucky that Erskine was so hands-on, but that probably had something to do with the program he was in. An Architecture student who put the art in the architecture, this stuff was going right over his head.
“Ah, I guess you’d have to see it to know what I’m talking about. Not that you’ll be getting that far. He builds robots with newborn AIs that he keeps trying to teach. It’s the funniest thing in the world because they’re so cute but so helpless at the same time.”
Eventually, Tony found the flower shop they were coming from. It was maybe three and a half blocks from SI and it didn’t look all that fancy at all. If not for the logo, no one would know what they sold. A lot of the city was like that, and for good reason: There wasn’t enough space for big fancy signs everywhere and if you sold a good product, everyone would flock to you anyway.
Besides, even if he did know the answer, he didn’t like where this talk was heading. She might have taken a few tips from the guy next to him on how to look down on helpless fuckers like Steve.
“Hey, do you know the answer to number three from the homework?” A blonde girl with mischievous green eyes leaned across the aisle and whispered to him. Steve shook his head. It was a multiple-choice question and he’d likely gotten it wrong. God forbid they write a paper anytime soon. He really is in over his head.
Steve stuttered through his order, a chicken-pineapple enchilada with green chile sauce and a Sprite. Tony made him look smooth by comparison because he couldn’t decide if he wanted an enchilada, a tamale, or a burrito. The waitress grinned and said, “I’ll put you down for your usual.” before going back to the kitchen.
But his classmates were just fine with it, apparently. And so was the boy a few seats in front of him who broke into the teacher’s lecture every five minutes to correct him. Some people were a bit annoyed with the guy, who looked to be around Steve’s age, but he definitely knew what he was doing. He managed to shut them up with each question they asked until they could no longer catch him off-guard and stopped trying after a bit.
“Don’t you think that show of yours was a little much?” Carol asked as they walked to Boca Grande. Rhodey wasn’t really in the mood for Mexican but he wasn’t sure he was in the mood for much of anything. Art Kid’s dilemma was weighing on him now.
Six hours later, he heard “wait a minute, that one class with the boy you’ve been drooling over who tutored you? That class?!”
“Yes!” Rhodey threw his hands in the air. “Thank God, we are one step closer. They might get together before the end of the year!”
“Good morning, Ms. Delian.” He offered smoothly, having barely glanced at her nametag. Sheila Delian had blonde hair and hazel eyes that went wider than a disco ball when she saw him.
"Some people got by the chocolates, others had their roses grow far beyond their measure. This was done to a number of major American companies with no true connection to each other. Some employers got away scot-free, like SI and Van Dyne's fashion empire, but others weren't so lucky. This villain calls himself Cupid-."
"No need, and I'd rather not stir up anything with whoever's sending these. Thank you for all your help, Ms. Delian. I hope your day gets better."
"As a team? Nothing. We'll need your various individual skillsets. As for who's on this, all the usual suspects, Stark. The CDC Shou be contacting you for a sample of the flowers at some point."
“Sam, Sam, you don’t get it, this one engineering class has been driving me batshit and I finally proved I belong in the class!”
“There won’t be a cease-and-desist order.” Tony determined. “Not yet, anyways. People like the flowers and there’s plenty of employees at the Tower. We could easily wait this buyer out.”
He knew that voice. It was the same one he heard every day trying to figure out what the hell the teacher thought he was doing, teaching like this?!
It got to be more than a bit ridiculous a few days later, when Security had to go through dozens of notes attached to as many bouquets. All of them were addressed to Tony and each of them were different in some way shape or form. One group of notes was sweet, describing how the flowers smelled and a picnic they'd be good for. Another involved promises of Tony's favorite foods not long after. What made the employees of SI suspicious is that these were foods he actually liked as opposed to something snagged from an interview or a passing remark. Tony has eaten countless meals in front of countless people, so someone was bound to get some of his favorite foods right. But the fact was that many articles in the genius behind SI involved false information or caricatures of who the man actually was. He allowed it in the name of privacy, and it would definitely help narrow down the pool of suspects.
Nat watches him in the mirror, but doesn’t say anything about the weird look in his eye, the sad bend of his shoulders. She watches him briefly, decides something singly, then quickly dives into a recitation of the detailed itinerary for the day’s traveling.
She hadn’t known when she started the well-meaning sentence, but by the end of it, Nat knows it’s the wrong thing to say.
“No. No, Steve. Just no. Despite everything that’s happened, how could you forget that I know you. You’re an emotional, sentimental, romantic, dumbass idiot, but you don’t do anything
“I love you,” Steve breathes heavily into Tony’s ear, breath sad and furious and over the moon, “I love you so fucking much.”
“Fine.” Nat concedes, pushing herself out of the seat, but lingering in Bucky’s personal space with leveraged elbows and carefully narrowed eyes, “But if I find out either of you had anything to do with this, you’ll regret it. You hear me?”
This is completely new ground for Steve- conversation starters regarding his ass in a suit were not included on Nat’s handy note cards. He sputters helplessly.
There’s something about Steve for the rest of the day- Nat, Sam, and Bucky all notice it- that’s just the tiniest bit off.
“Welp, thanks,” Tony says quickly as the large, glass doors of the building’s lobby come into view, “I’m looking forward to the big day.”
She opens the fourth door on the left, the one that looks identical to all the other grey doors, and pushes Tony through. He’s got his mouth hanging open, jaw unhinged and ready to bicker right back at this pushy, hardheaded redhead, but she taps at her clipboard and lets the door close behind her in one fell swoop. When Tony turns around to face the owner of the office, he finds the one and only Steve Rogers smiling at him from behind a half-pinned mannequin.
Thor and Clint end up partnering together on a deal that’s mostly a time-filler, nowhere near as serious or as appealing as Tony’s offer. Stev politely turns it down, and Clint laughs behind his hand. Maria considers throwing an offer onto the table, even does so briefly, but retracts it as soon as Nat pitches her offer, straight faced as she claims there was nothing she could bring to the table that topped Nat’s deal.
She pulls out the chair across from him, folds one long leg over the other, and she looks at him meaningfully. Steve purposefully stares at the phone. That’s a lot of zeroes.
By the time the hair, nails, and makeup of Tony’s gala look are primed and finished off, Steve reenters, dressed handsomely in an amazing blue crushed velvet suit that only a fashion legend like him could make seem so effortless. Tony’s forced to stay in the black leather seat with his legs crossed as Steve appraises the beauticians’ work with a small smile.
As often happens when half your campaign staff has the intelligence of world-changers and the drunken maturity of frat boys, a chant starts, faces turned expectantly in Steve’s direction. Sam and Bucky lead the charge, overly friendly arms wrapped around one another’s shoulders, champagne glasses emptied within a moment’s notice.
Steve is left standing there alone, after midnight, the street quiet, and he stares up at the silhouette of Iron Man in the night sky and smiles to himself.
Steve’d only half listened, pre-occupied with twisting unnaturally back to fixing Bucky’s crooked tie, his hands getting swatted by Bucky himself. Sam reached a hand over to stop Bucky from resisting, “Yeah, yeah. I’ve heard it all before. Don’t fuck up. Big money, very important. Got it.”
“You don’t count, Stark,” Nat says through an eye roll, curling one of her tiny hands around Steve’s arm, “Pepper already gave me your money. Now, come on, Steve. We have to schmooze.”
The whole time, Steve is vaguely mesmerized by the way Tony talks with his hands, the way his tongue carefully juts out at the steam of the hot coffee. If Tony had asked him to sign a document that legally changed his name to Butt Mcbutterson, Steve probably would’ve done it without a second thought in those moments.
“Let me guess, you’re the type who wakes up at the asscrack of dawn and gets all energized and productive without even drinking coffee. I bet you go on a run every morning before the sun’s up and everything.”
All the major newspapers have SENATOR ROGERS’ name in big letters on the front page, almost every day of the week. The polls are climbing. And Steve’s smile still falters.
