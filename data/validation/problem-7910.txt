his outstretched palm.
Steve looks down at his lap and purses his lips against a smile. “The sun?”
“They arrested Brock. I called my contacts in the city council and the commissioner’s office - the most I can find out is that someone went over the councilman’s head to the mayor, called in a personal favor. He’s being held in the 75th right now, one of the only Brooklyn precincts he doesn’t have friends in.”
“Why don’t you have a Christmas tree up? Or any decorations?” Tony asks, fiddling with a string at the hem of the sweatshirt he borrowed from Steve. It’s big and warm and it smells like Sandalwood. “You love all that crap.”
“No,” Tony shakes his head. “No, it isn’t.”
“I don’t know where you’re getting this quinoa thing from, I have
Brock doesn’t come back. Steve checks outside every hour for him, but he never shows. Steve calls Natasha at work and asks her to look into it, stalk him on social media, see if they can dredge up any information about where he is. Meanwhile, he keeps Bucky company, waiting on him like the absolute baby he becomes when he gets even the slightest bit sick.
“No,” Sam grunts, but he’s got a vaguely guilty expression on his face.
Resting on a little velvet hill are a pair of cufflinks, immediately recognizable as monochromatic 2D replications of DUM-E,
And then several other things happen, and Steve begins to suspect
Steve crouches by the couch and pats Bucky’s hand, eyebrows drawn together. “What’s going on?”
Tony rubs his eyes again.
“Shutting up sounds alright.”
“Hello,” Steve says, phone pressed against his ear, he’s still smiling softly at Tony, one arm wrapped loosely around his waist.
Tony takes a moment to process this, because it seems like some kind of sick joke. As he considers, he notes that the blankets start to feel uncomfortably warm and the last vestiges of relaxation are draining rapidly out of his chest. Excellent.
That’s right. It was custom.
“…so,” Steve says, brow tilting skeptically, “for the first day of our honeymoon, the whole day, you want me to… do yoga in front of you? And you just watch me?”
“Honestly, kid,” Rhodey starts, a teasing smile lifting the corner of his mouth, “Tony has never taken the bus in his life. Everything he knows about public transit has been lifted from pop culture.”
“You’re useless,” Tony smiles before his mouth stretches into a yawn.
Steve doesn’t ask if he can borrow the truck, just glances back at Tony as he grabs the keys off the counter. Tony nods slightly and places his hands on Riri’s shoulders, urging her forward as she starts to drag her feet. They all load into the truck and Steve takes the fastest route to Ms. Williams house. Riri slouches against her seat as Steve pulls up into the driveway, like she’s trying to disappear into the ratty seats.
Sam snorts around the lip of his beer. “Until he passes out? Or one of the brides stabs him to death. Either works for me.”
A silence passes between them, awkward and strange in a way silences never were before. Tony’s throat feels tight, even as he clears it to try and speak again.
She shows up on Tony’s doorstep in a blouse and a pencil skirt, both entirely void of the usual black smears of engine grease and oil.
Tony doesn’t even know how he manages to say ‘I do’ on cue, because he honestly feels like he’s going to start full on sobbing at any moment. He’s also pretty glad they decided against doing their own vows — Steve thought it was silly and performative, the most romantic thing Tony could come up with was 2 minutes on the mystifying powers of his fiance’s ass.
“Call Steve.”
“Oh, I won’t bother you.” The tone of Steve’s voice implies that he definitely will be bothering Tony, aggressively and frequently. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll keep to my farm, you keep to yours. Solitude together.”
Steve puts his hands on his hips and wonders if, for once in his life, he should pick his battles.
Tony calls parents, makes sure everyone has a ride home. He hugs Peter and rumples his hair. He hugs Riri - for the first time, he notes with a sliver of fear and surprise - and they hold each other tight, her curls tickling the bridge of his nose. When they pull apart, she punches him in the arm - perhaps a little too hard - and sniffles.
“Then he says no. You get over him eventually. Life moves on.”
Steve is suspiciously quiet, which makes Tony just slightly move his arm and open one eye in curiosity. Steve is looking at the patchy sock in his lap.
“Smartest kid I’ve ever met,” Tony says honestly, and that’s including himself.
Tony stands dutifully to the side as the rest of the kids in the cell shuffle out, thanking Tony for bail and shooting admiring looks at Steve. Steve spends a couple minutes exchanging contact information with the girl he was talking to when Tony first arrived. They talk in low, serious voices, and Tony is quietly impressed with how firm her voice is. Most people get all fluttery when addressing Captain America.
“They’re absolutely serious about that, dipshit. They don’t want you to vomit while you’re under anesthesia.”
Steve has no idea what business Tony Stark has in Brooklyn, but he seems sufficiently distracted from it by the sight of Steve staring at him.
“His fiancé has already gone back,” the receptionist tells her, a little cooly.
(Probably best to make it an even 50%).
And then they haven’t talked for a week, and they’re both too stubborn to break the pattern. Tony spends the night sitting under his desk drinking very expensive scotch out of a very expensive crystal tumbler. He’s wearing the crimson tie that Steve got him for his birthday, except it’s hanging undone around his neck now, and he seems to have lost one of his shoes.
“Good song,” Steve says carefully, feeling a little uncomfortable in the silence.
The strand of hair pinched between Tony’s fingers is white.
“Oh, god,” Tony says. He can’t stop staring at the flowers and there’s a funny spreading warmth in his stomach.
“I know,” Natasha says, just casual enough to be absolutely terrifying.
“I know,” Rhodes says back and kisses her nose.
Tony gestures for JARVIS to turn down the music, just loud enough that Steve doesn’t have to shout.
“Remember Christmas three years ago?” Tony asks.
Tony’s momentary outrage melts into fondness. “I love you, too.”
Steve’s own bathtub, in his room in the tower, to be specific. It’s dry and clean and a dimly floral smell hangs from the walls. Steve really likes baths, but he feels guilty and over-indulgent whenever he takes them. Natasha has bought him a captivatingly colorful -- and, Tony might add, quite expensive -- array of specialized bath products in an over-the-top attempt to break him of his modesty. Based on the errant sparkles dotted across the rim, she must have managed some degree of success.
Steve flashes him an expression that adequately conveys the utter disgust he feels at having to hear that, and throws a wadded up napkin at Bucky’s face. Bucky goes on another spiel about how he should be treated gently because he’s injured.
Yours,
Steve looks down at where the spoon is buried in his low-fat Yoplait, and raises one meaningful eyebrow.
And Steve is sporting a rapidly spreading blush as he stutters out a “what does that have to do with anything”.
Tony’s rolling his eyes and looking out the window, now, but even a mention of that time makes his heart clench a little in his chest.
“Hi.” She sighs, a small whisper of a thing, glances down at her lap, and starts to speak in a mild, hollow voice. “It’s silly to cry. I knew him for a month. I don’t want to cry.”
Tony freezes instantly, which is made even more difficult by the fact that Steve used the Captain America voice, which isn’t really fair because he knows how much it turns Tony on in the context of their bedroom.
Asshole.
tonight.
“I want to hear about your date.”
“Tony!” Steve shouts over the music, closing the book in his lap and looking up with a small, contented smile. He looks so serene, ironic in the surrounding chaos of the workshop. “Gonna get takeout from Wong’s Garden! You want anything?”
“I do,” Steve warns sharply, lightly pinching Tony’s stomach. “I know you hate it but that’s just because I haven’t house-trained you yet.”
Steve jerks to the side to find who else but Tony Stark, with his back to the bar and his legs spread so wide that it’d be impossible for someone to occupy one of the seats next to him without touching him. He’s wearing his usual posh clothes - expensive looking jeans and a white button down with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. There’s a Rolex strapped around his wrist and a glass of whiskey clasped loosely in one of his hands.  He looks like an ad for a men’s fragrance that costs more than Steve’s annual salary.
“Just don’t feel like it, I guess,” Tony shrugs, handing her a pair of needle-nosed pliers. She takes them silently, fiddling with the motherboard of Tony’s newest supercomputer. “Lost my muse, whatever the fuck that means.”
Two hours later he’s lying on the floor of the workshop with his feet in the air, thinking there’s no way this is helping more than it’s hurting. He communicates this to Steve, who’s doing the same pose next to him, and Steve turns his head to frown disapprovingly at Tony.
“No pictures. If you want to see me in this,” Steve drops a knee onto the bed, moving so he’s straddling Tony’s thighs. “You have to come all the way to New York. And you have to be very nice.”
said silly stuff about you before I knew you.”
.” Tony opens his eyes just wide enough to successfully convey suggestiveness. “Good idea.”
After that, Steve shows up in his room two or three nights a week, hovering nervously by the door every time like he's not sure he's allowed in. They never have an actual conversation about it; Steve just happens to fall asleep there, they just happen to wake up in each other's arms, Tony just happens to have a slightly normal resting heartbeat for the rest of the day. It's probably easier that way. Plausible, deniability, and all.
“No,” he says, grabbing the front of Steve’s shirt. He moves so suddenly he spills the scotch onto the carpet and bumps his head against the top of the desk, but it hardly matters. When he presses his cheek against Steve’s scratchy one, he knows they’re still meant to be.
. At some point Tony lets Steve down, only to push him up against the closed door, wrap his arms securely around Steve’s narrow waist.
“If you’re the one who’s saying it, shouldn’t you know what it means?”
Tony can’t help but scoff a little, even as arousal thuds in his stomach at the feeling of Steve’s teeth on his pulse. “Uh-huh. Pot, kettle.”
Tony’s heart melts. —Not a pathetic amount, though. Just enough that he can still be very suave and look largely unaffected by his earnestly charming husband.
“Don’t call Bucky,” Sam groans, but he opens his eyes wide, staring at Steve hard.
Steve swallows, but presses forward, his wounded pride spurring him on, “You ruined his life! You took away the best job he ever had! And you didn’t even tell him why, and he’s been struggling so much this past year and you don’t even care!”
Tony starts in the opposite direction, expecting Steve to follow, but he doesn’t. Tony slows and glances over his shoulder, one eyebrow arched in expectation.
"At five in the morning."
“It does.”
A small silence settles in the minimal space between them, and then—
Nothing about the moment seems particularly urgent, anyways, not like it usually does. All of their hookups thus far have been nuanced iterations of tearing each other’s clothes off and going at it for an hour before Tony disappears to the other side of the country. As much as Tony may joke about it, he never actually misses his flight. And there’s a reason for that.
“And I suppose you’ll be hitching a ride with me?”
“You love the parties. People at the parties love you.”
Everyone except Riri turns their head to look at him. It reminds him eerily of a documentary he and Steve watched about lemurs two weekends ago.
She’s not like Peter, not in the big ways. She’s too smart for her own good, but seems annoyed that she needs his help in the first place, seems like she’d much rather do this without him. That’s what mitigates the guilt in his stomach at bringing yet another child into the vicinity of his fucked up guidance. Riri knows she doesn’t need him, and she doesn’t care for him beyond his expertise in the workshop.
“And you were in the room for three of those hours, so what’s your point?”
“Ah,” Steve says, grinning, too, now, “that one’s not so bad.”
Natasha delivers the remark with the tone one might use when commenting on the stock market, the inconvenience of road traffic, or Bucky’s mildly smelly gym socks.
Tony maybe always knew that that was true, but he hoped he’d never have to contend with it in this house, so soon after their first parting, his own wealth once again bankrolling Peter’s one-man death quest.
“Anyways, Sam and I really oughta get going. He’s got an early shift at the hospital tomorrow and Bucky’s gonna need the rest regardless.”
The drive is peaceful. Tony makes himself a cassette in preparation. He’ll put Friday in the truck later, but for now he’s content to listen to the same eleven AC/DC tracks on repeat.
the headline moves in a persistent ribbon along the bottom of the screen, while New York's favorite ditzy weatherman, Thor Odinson, prattles off the best ways to stay safe in such treacherous conditions.
“Well,” Tony only ever grins with his entire face. “Just because something’s been awful the first thirty-eight times, doesn’t mean the thirty-ninth won’t be the ticket.”
“I need you to say something.” Tony pushes off the doorframe, slowly makes his way around the desk and comes to crouch at Steve’s feet. Steve grips for his hand a little brashly. “I need you to tell me where you’re at with this.”
“Uh-huh, yeah. I may not have actually… been in the bodega for that phone call. In fact, I might have had that information memorized from the second you told it to me. --Which was, I will say, far too late in our marriage, and I maintain that you were purposefully and spitefully holding out on me.”
terrible idea. He’d rather pitch himself off the top of the tower than admit he’s been feeling a little less like himself lately, but that’s not really what Steve’s asking for. Tony pictures it: he calls Steve and breathes heavily on the phone and Steve manifests wherever Tony is, armed with a story of how he did something dumb that one time. Instant Captain America, Just Add Trauma!
“I’m sorry, I know this is kind of an imposition, but, well, Riri and I have been talking—“
“Are you cyberstalking my contacts?” Steve asks casually, clearing some of Tony’s hair away from his temple and pressing a sweet, absent-minded kiss there.
“Oh… no?”
“We didn’t have a date, did we?”
“One you’re very obviously not denying.”
, Steve can’t help but think: well. That’s the end of that, then. Because Tony’s got more responsibilities than ever before, and he can’t possibly have time to grab a coffee with the little guy from Brooklyn who rejected him that one time and also skipped out at the end of a very lucrative internship with his company.
He resolutely ignores the slight quiver in his hands, the blush still staining his cheeks.
didn’t expect to round out the day picking up his husband from a police station, but sometimes that’s just how these things go.
“Tony?” Steve asks, tentatively rapping his knuckles on the door, because Captain America is always courteous.
“Is that a euphemism, Rogers?”
“‘Cause I’m a fucking idiot.” Tony pauses, moving his hand away from his face and meeting Steve’s eyes again. There’s a startling sort of honesty there that steals the breath right out of Steve’s traitorous, asthmatic lungs. “‘...Cause I — ‘cause I like you. Fuck, Steve, I like you so much, it’s ridiculous.”
She loves roast chicken, running, elevators, DUM-E, and, most of all, Steve. Steve carries her like a puppy even if she’s far too big for it and he runs with her every day, even when it’s raining. He also gives her belly rubs, knits her sweaters, and talks to her when he thinks Tony’s not listening.
“You about done, Romanoff?” Rhodes asks, and it sounds like he’s smiling.
“It’s alright,” Ms. Williams replies in that airy, tired way of hers. “Just force her out before ten.”
Steve promptly looks up and scowls at Tony.
Tony grins lazily up at him, very narrowly resisting the urge to just start taking his clothes off. “Maybe you coupled up with a sappy guy.”
“Seriously, Buck,” Steve sighs, tugging his beanie off his head and shoving it into his pocket. He gropes around in his bag for his own keys, head ducked as he approaches, “get a keychain. A lanyard. You know Sam will make you a lanyard, stop making the rest of us suffer because you’re too embarrassed to—“
“I don’t think you’re doing so bad.”
“—I think,” Steve interjects pointedly, “that you feel bad about missing date night for an assignment you don’t even really need to be on, and you’re trying to sweet talk your way into getting lucky when you come home.”
Riri rolls her eyes at him, but she’s never outright rebuked one of his dismissals. Tony gets the sense that she doesn’t think she deserves… this - whatever this is, access to his resources and his knowledge. Tony wants to tell her she actually deserves so much more, but that’s the sort of encouragement a mentor gives to his mentee, and as he’s established, he doesn’t need another one of those relationships. The only way that ends is in Riri ashing away or getting blown up or finding herself trapped in some other reality with Tony left behind to explain to her mother how the hell this happened.
Heat rises on Steve’s cheeks, but he refuses to be deterred, even as he’s fighting a smile. “You had a point, I believe?”
“I was also there,” Rhodes grumbles. Steve feels a small surge of affection for him.
“What about your date?” Steve asks, voice low and small.
Steve holds his hand a little tighter.
He’s lying awake in his bed, shoulders pressed against the frame, sheets pooling around his waist. His forehead is damp with sweat and his heart is hammering rabbit-quick in his chest. The clock reads 2:43 AM.
Jesus. He’s never been an ace at social interaction, but this hostile half-acquaintanceship with Tony Stark has really made Steve’s batting average swing to all-time lows.
Pepper and Happy blink curiously at him. Tony takes a long sip of his coffee and winces, silently cursing weak Starbucks blends. He has no idea how Pepper survives on this stuff.
today.
Well. Passionate on Rhodes’ part. Natasha is completely impassable.
“Yeah. Really good.” Steve’s looking down at his hands now, running his thumb along his ring finger with this dreary, cast over expression.
When the last beats of the song finally pump out of the speakers, Steve insists he needs to find the bathroom. Convincing Phil not to follow him is far more difficult than is comfortable for either of them. The second he tugs his wrist out of that slightly clammy grasp, he starts off in the opposite direction, wiping sweat from his brow and neck with the sleeve of his shirt.
Natasha says ‘alright’, and Tony can’t hear her actually descend from the dresser and leave, but assumes it happens anyways because she’s no longer talking. Assassins. He’d attach a bell to her neck if he didn’t think she’d find a way to garrote him with it.
Tony could maybe live in Kansas, if it was with Steve. And he just wore cowboy hats and open plaid shirts all the time everywhere they went.
And Tony ponders, as he watches Steve leave for work, how he could’ve thought forever was a burden. Forever — like Steve, like Ruby, like apple-picking for their one-year anniversary, like bickering over early-morning breakfast — is undoubtedly, unequivocally among the greatest of gifts Tony Stark has ever been given.
Coincidentally, his appointment with Dr. Burford is the next morning. He takes it half because a massage sounds really fucking nice, and half because he’s trying to get away from Steve’s relentless fussing. Tony doesn’t get a wink of sleep that night, and during breakfast he feels skittish, cornered— his instinct is to recoil from Steve’s affection like a hissing cat. It’s embarrassing, to say the least, and not beneficial for the whole friendship schtick they’re on these days, so he has to get out of there.
He attends therapy far more often than Tony, and goes on lots and lots of runs, which he says help. He’d never admit it, but physical affection helps, too, so when Tony knows he’s having an off day the first thing he does is tackle him onto the couch and pepper his face with kisses.
“And I like a lay who gives as good as he gets,” Tony says leans back in his chair. “So tell me right now, Steve Rogers, is there
“If it gets any bigger people are going to get the wrong idea about your ego.”
“Hey,” Tony says back, offering him a soft, nervous smile.
and the urgency of that movement promptly dissipates.
“Stop fidgeting,” Natasha tells him, shoving a beer in his hand.
, Tony thinks.
As it turns out, he can only lie to the man for so long. Even though he’s only catching Tony
He glances back at Steve, who is looking increasingly nervous and has started wringing his hands in a way he probably thinks is subtle. It’s kind of a funny sight, paired with his He-Man beard and edgy long hair. It’s also, unfortunately, very endearing, and does nothing to stave off the highly potent “I’m in love with you” feelings swirling around Tony’s brain.
He knows he needs to breathe. He knows he needs to snap out of it. But every time he reaches for one of his coping mechanisms (each varying in effectiveness and general healthiness), it’s like he’s moving through molasses.
About three weeks into his “solitude”, Tony caves and invites Pepper and Rhodey up to the farm. On the morning of their arrival, Tony waits on the porch with a pitcher of iced coffee, sprawled across the deck so he can enjoy the feel of the sun against face and neck.
Steve guesses that’s fair.
He's vaguely cognizant that, lingering at the edge of the sudden black hole in his chest, is annoyance at the fact he’s been begging Tony to order a fancy label-maker for the house and it turns out he
Steve makes a funny snorting sound and Tony sighs, rolling his eyes and going back to Steve’s profile in search of his next potential hopeful.
“Fuck that,” the other kid says, examining Tony with a cool, disapproving stare, “like I’m missing out on this drama.”
“Hey,” Bucky pants, “didn’t Rhonda go to MIT with Tony Stark?”
Now it’s Tony’s turn to say excuse me.
It had been two and a half hours.
It sounds so much like what Peter told him the first time they’d met. W
“No way! Which one?”
(He’d initially asked Pepper to plan the wedding, and she’d laughed so loudly that it drew the attention of nearly every dinner table in their vicinity.)
, Steve thinks, resolutely ignoring the blush that rises on his cheeks.
And he’s just sitting there, watching the stuff bubbling in the pot, and he has this out of body experience where he wonders what the fuck he’s going to say when Steve proposes. And while he’s trying to construct an answer that both his heart and head are happy with, the pasta starts fucking burning. So he grabs the handle to take it off the stove but he forgets that it’s hot, hot enough that it burns him and he throws it on the ground. And now there’s still steaming, slightly charred pasta all over the hardwood and Tony is standing in the middle of it with angry red welts forming along the line of his palm.
Tony makes a noise of frustration in the back of his throat. “What do you even need it for?” Riri’s eyes get all hopeful and she starts to open her mouth and suddenly Tony is certain that the answer will be far more trouble than it’s worth, “—you know what, never mind, it doesn’t matter, because I’m not helping you make it. You know why they kicked you out of MIT? ‘Cause you can’t follow my one rule. No discussing Iron Woman.”
“Okay, fine.” Tony says, flicking his sunglasses up over his head and smiling shamelessly at Rhodey. “I’ve accepted it. Can we talk about you now?”
“No livestock, no bees. Got it,” Steve says with a small, muted smile. He wipes his hands on the dry parts of his shirt and trudges over to where Tony’s reclined, flopping down on the grass next to him.
“That wasn't a rhetorical question, so I'm going reiterate in the direction of the
Tony opens one eye to look at him.
“His net worth is 100 million dollars?” Steve balks, though he’s momentarily distracted by the smell of mac and cheese wafting from Sam’s direction.
all i can say is Yeesh(TM)
“I’ll think about it,” he says finally, and Riri smiles wider than she ever has before.
“It’s not a contest, you know.”
“I’m apologizing,” Rhodes presses, and Steve thinks, with a little smugness, that Natasha might have finally met her match, as far as stubbornness goes. “I’m explaining. If you’re interested in hearing it. If not, I’m happy to leave you be.”
"With me."
It’s not even just that he’s tired—he could pop three caffeine pills and be ready to go—it’s more that he just… doesn’t
“—A stubborn asshole,” Tony finishes, still smiling as he fishes his wallet out of his pocket. “It’s fine. I’ll cover bail. For everyone in custody.”
Rhodes suddenly materializes next to him, ducking out of a car Steve realizes must be Tony’s. He offers Steve a friendly wave, and Steve returns it. Tony remains frozen, eyes flicking between Steve and Brock, some unreadable expression on his face. The spell is only broken when Rhodes tugs on his arm, effectively leading them both in the opposite direction.
Tony hadn’t considered the possibility that, with the introduction of so many miniature superheroes, a few miniature supervillains would pop up to match.
The corner of Steve’s mouth twitches into a half-hearted smile, but it’s gone so fast, lost to the heaviness of his mouth and brow. “I’m sorry, Tony. I think--” Steve cuts himself off, shaking his head. He rubs at the corner of his eye and takes a steadying breath. “--I think I came here on instinct. I was trying to get home.”
Tony winds a hand through his hair, tugs his head back down and resents Steve’s responding chuckle. “Uh-huh. Alimony has been an absolute nightmare.”
“Is this what you plan on doing all day?” Steve asks, and Tony can feel the low vibration of his voice where his spine is pressed against Steve’s front. “Acting as my own personal yenta?”
I hope everything is going well at Arc. Say hi to Peter, MJ, and Ned for me. I miss them. Maybe the next time you’re in the city, we can meet up.
They miss midnight entirely, caught up in some petty argument about the merits of pineapple on pizza. When Tony realizes it’s the New Year, he launches himself across the table and kisses Steve so enthusiastically that it makes the old man in the corner of the restaurant finally leave. Steve can only place his hands on either side of Tony’s face and hold on for dear life. They look ridiculous and Steve definitely saw the flash of someone’s camera in the storefront window, but none of that really matters because— well— start as you mean to go on, right?
“You did?” Tony asks, going completely and utterly gooey.
“I’m not really taking visitors right now,” Tony considers calling him ‘Steven’ as a power move, but ultimately decides against it. Probably too petty. He’ll stow it away for later usage though, just in case. “How did you get this address?”
Steve tries to get up and sways a little in the process, one hand shooting out to steady himself on the coffee table. Tony only manages to watch him teeter for a second and a half before has to say something.
Steve ends up getting in the shower with his clothes on, which shouldn’t really be surprising to Tony considering he was always good at playing down his level of drunkenness until the absolute worst moment. Tony has to get in the shower with him and pull wet clothes off his body, pretend not to notice the bruises across his torso or the fact that Tony’s initials are wrapped around his hip, written in neat, black ink.
,” Tony grins, rubbing at her chest. She’s far too big to be a lap dog, but unfortunately Steve carries her so much that she really thinks she is. She has such a weird, awkward body that she’s only ever comfortable completely stretched out across Tony’s lap or laying on her back like an overturned roach.
“Visit again,” Tony tells them both, arms hanging loosely through the window of the Prius.
What follows is the most agonizing six hours of Tony’s life.
Steve shakes his head, still smiling as he turns around. “I’ll see you around, Tony.”
“You’re both killing me,” Steve sighs, stepping around the island and rubbing at his eyes. He wraps one arm around his husband’s waist and loops the other around his dog, semi-successfully dragging them both out of the kitchen.
“Everyone’s on an adrenaline rush after a battle, people do all sorts of crazy stuff, it’s pure expressions of instinct!”
Tony glances at Steve, who doesn’t look up from where he’s sewing Sam back together, but is sporting a small, pleased smile and a pink flush.
“Schematics for what?”
Despite his initial agonizing, however, he takes the job. He emails Ms. Potts an hour and a half before the deadline, resolutely ignoring Bucky’s evil eye the entire time. Bucky is understandably whiney about the fact that he and Sam are leaving him alone with weirdo subletters over the summer, but he’s also — kind of jumpy, which isn’t really like Bucky, so Steve resolves to visit him at least once if his schedule and salary allow. They both cry a little at the airport goodbye. It’ll be the longest they’ve spent apart from each other since Bucky studied abroad in Germany their junior year.
“Hey,” he breathes, mouth tipping into a small, soft smile. Tony returns it, but a million times brighter and better.
Tony doesn’t look up, but his smile widens as he pulls a fry through a stray glob of ketchup. “How’d you even end up at Arc in
“What?” Steve asks, incredulity spreading over his features. “Are you kidding me? They were smitten—“
—but no. Right? No way.
“You weren’t terrible,” Tony concedes. “Though I did set the bar pretty low for you.”
“You have years. Decades, even.”
When he finds a Stark Industries USB Drive in his P.O. Box that afternoon, his first instinct is to toss it in the blender. It’s small, sleek, and black, a strangely heavy weight at the center of Steve’s palm. He tries his best to ignore it for the better part of the evening, but after a while it feels like it’s burning a hole in the pocket of his sweatpants. Despite the fact he’s risking infecting his entire household with Tony Stark’s Cyber-Virus Revenge, he succumbs to his curiosity and plugs the drive into the port on his computer.
“Because I already fell for you once this year, and it was very, very painful.”
“Alright, then, Rogers, spill. What are your big plans?”
Tony smiles.
“No,” Tony says immediately, petulantly, then seems to cut himself off. There’s another moment’s pause before he shakes his head and sets his jaw, that same strange determination coming over his features. “Fuck —
He whines about it constantly, but Steve just says it’s a good thing he’s got so much time these days, since he’s so old and retired. That usually shuts Tony up.
“Bed.” When Steve talks, Tony can feel the vibrations against his cheek.
“Yeah, honey,” Tony yawns, “whatever you want.”
“How are you not cold?” Tony asks, voice rough with sleep.
Sam’s niece hobbles towards the altar tossing rose petals at everybody. She falls about halfway through, and Peter, who’s the ring bearer, rushes down the aisle to scoop her up in his arms and carry her the rest of the way.
“East Village, ‘round Gramercy.”
It comes from the edge of the USB itself, the black body of it giving way to reveal a sliver of a silver panel and a tiny projector lens. Steve spends several moments examining it in wonder before realizing he’s supposed to — tap the air? He’s suddenly sitting at the center of a spread of glowing blue lines, and at its nexus there’s a button labeled ‘listen’.
“It was a good fight,” Eli chimes in, rubbing at his jaw. He looks so much like a grown-up sometimes that Tony has to actively remind himself that he’s still just a kid. “Minimal civilian casualties, cleared the city best you could, made use of the things you were capable of together.”
“What do you want to do?” Steve sits up, hooks his hands in the backs of Tony’s knees and settles him properly in his lap. “If you could do anything in the world today, what would it be?”
Steve figured it was only a matter of time — his last name is, in fact, plastered in unmistakably large font over the top of the building. He seems to have come from some sort of business meeting, though his tie is hanging around his shoulders and there is a vaguely indecent amount of buttons undone on his shirt. His eyes catch on Steve immediately, and Steve resists the urge to try and make himself smaller under the intensity of the stare.
“What’d you say to Peter?” Steve repeats, sitting down on the couch, too. Ruby curls up against his leg. “You gave him advice. It got him to finally calm down a little.”
to buy you chocolate. I got hungry.”
Tony spends the rest of the afternoon keeping the conversation carefully away from Steve, New York, and related stressors. He doesn’t tell Rhodey he got to the diner on time and was only late because he couldn’t muster the energy to get out of his car. His shades are tipped over his face so Rhodey can’t see the circles under his eyes, and he chugs three cups of green tea to mask the fact he hasn’t brushed his teeth.
They throw a party at the penthouse and invite all their friends, because they share everything, now — places, people, and the inexplicable bone-deep feeling that they belong together. Rhodey tells him they’re moving too fast at least once a week, but Tony’s so far beyond reason, at this point, that he can’t even pretend to humor the idea of putting some distance between them. He doesn’t know what good it would do, anyway. Falling in love with Steve has only ever felt like hurtling towards the inevitable.
They stand in silence for a moment, Steve stiff in the doorway and Tony draped loosely against the frame. Tony knows - knew even before he called - that he probably shouldn’t have done this, but even still, just seeing Steve feels like some kind of relief.
Steve looks at him through lidded, hazy blue eyes. There’s sweat gathering on his cupid’s bow and his hair is damp, almost dark where it falls against his forehead. “Please,” he says, and Tony can barely look at him and remember how to breathe at the same time.
Much to Tony’s relief, Dr. Burford maintains a steady stream of chatter, like he knows the silence will bother Tony more than the water feature. He asks Tony to lie face down on the table, makes no mention of the bruises along his sides, though, thankfully, carefully avoids the sorest areas. He starts out with a gentle touch, and Tony’s ability to speak kind of… drops off, as his hands dig deeper and deeper into Tony’s bunched up back.
Riri swallows her bite of steak and frowns a little. “No later than 10.”
“Love you,” Tony says honestly.
Steve reaches out, ghosts the tips of his fingers over the crow’s feet at the corners of Tony’s eyes, then presses down with a firmer touch. It dimly registers that he knows this man completely. He will never know anyone else like this, for however long he lives.
The corner of Steve’s mouth tips into a tentative smile. “I think so, too. It was getting a little crazy for me down there.”
“Steve,” Tony presses, pushing lightly at his shoulder, “baby, are you awake?”
“Confessing my love to you,” Tony frowns at the garland in his hand, and looks back up at Steve, eyebrows drawn together. “It’s not going so hot, I’ll admit.”
“How often does this happen?”
Tony is about to go off on a whole spiel about what an absolute bastard he is, but Steve cuts it short by stepping forward and wrapping an arm around Tony’s waist, pressing a long, searing kiss to his mouth. There are crows of disgust over their comm lines, where their now gagging teammates are voicing dissent to the current proceedings. Tony uses the hand that’s not on Steve’s ass to turn off the connection.
“What’re you doing Friday night?” Brock asks, leaning up against the side of a building, hands shoved in his pockets. He smells a little like smoke, so Steve figures he probably wants a cigarette and is really only holding back for the benefit of the asthmatic in the near vicinity.
“What do you think you’re doing?” she demands.
“Good golly,” Tony sighs, slowly dragging his nails down Steve’s back. “I sure hope we finish before your parents get home.”
And then they’re kissing.
“Yeah,” Tony says, and can’t resist leaning forward for a kiss, even if they both have morning breath. “Yeah, honestly, Sugar Plum, that sounds really good.”
“But he’s not eating pizza. And he’s wearing a uniform,” Steve whispers, looking back at Tony with skeptical eyes.
“I think that’s enough science for today,” Tony stands up, rolling Riri’s plans up decisively. “Isn’t it past your bedtime, Williams?”
And at the end of the day, he hopes that he’s tired himself out enough to fall asleep the second his body hits the mattress— but it is, unfortunately, never that easy. Now that there’s nothing in his hands to distract him from what’s been lurking in his periphery all day, all that panic moves front and center. Whether it’s concern for the fate of the universe or the horrible, sinking feeling that he’s not going to be able to fix this— the notions are suddenly and utterly immovable.
Steve presses his smile against the back of his hand.
Silence falls between them. For a few minutes, the only sounds filling the air are ones of Steve grunting in pain and America throwing him places. Tony thinks it should probably feel strange, that this is so peaceful and normal.
“And, um. You might be right, about some of the stuff you said or implied about me not approving of the relationship because of where she comes from. That was mostly done unwittingly, but looking back I think maybe some of my own biases played a role in how quick I cut them apart. The way I’ve been raised, the relationship I’ve had with Rhodey over the years — these aren’t excuses, but I hope they’ll… contextualize the decision. A little. ‘Cause I know it was abrupt.”
“A team effort,” Steve sighs, taking a sip of his hot chocolate. Tony knows it’s far more watery than he would make it, but it still smooths out a line or two on Steve’s forehead. “I’d complain about it but at least Bucky’s smiling more these days.”
He’s embarrassed, maybe. Humiliated. Every time he tries to do bills or paint or take up some household chore, right as he hits a streak of productivity, he’ll remember one of the lines from Tony’s horrific speech and abruptly want to
She’s smart, she’s tough, and she’s fifteen, so she’s idealistic as hell. That combination of traits has terrified him from the second she first turned up on his doorstep, and it still does, but watching her now makes him realize that maybe possibility and opportunity exist alongside the threat of danger. Maybe they always have.
“Jarvis?”
“Yeah unless you don’t actually want to get married!” Tony snaps. “In which case, I feel the same way and also I’ve literally never liked you. What’s your name again? Stove?”
Steve comes home and finds him like that, just staring at his own hand like an idiot while the fire alarm goes off persistently in the background.
Tony gives him eyes, eyes that say ‘you are not nearly as cute as you think you are’. The effect is probably undercut by the fact that he opens the door just the slightest bit wider and steps backward, making room for Steve to slip through.
And, what, was
“You don’t have to.”
“Fine. I’ll put you down for a ‘considering it.’”
The rest of the kids are sitting on or up against the couch. Peter’s stationed at the arm, crouched up like a spider, his friend whose name is apparently Ned is taking up the couch cushion next to him. The one Tony suspects is Peter’s girlfriend is leaned up against Ned’s legs. Kate, America, and Eli take up the rest of the space, squished together in a way only Kate really looks comfortable with. Tony quietly observes America sneak a glance at Kate out of the corner of her eye, cheeks suspiciously pink. A few feet away from them, Peter’s looking down at Michelle with a funny face too.
“Yeah, I kind of get that,” Tony tilts his head, nodding slightly.
“They used to tell you smoking helped with asthma,” he says dismissively. His hand twitches, like he might reach for Tony, but the newly realized distance between them remains fixed. “Tony, I need to know why you were—“
PLAYBOY TONY STARK RETURNS TO MALIBU! HE AND BEST FRIEND, JAMES RHODES, HAVE A MEMORABLE NIGHT ON THE TOWN. Beneath the headline is a photo of Tony with his arm slung around Rhodes, both holding empty glasses. Tony’s laughing at something happening out of shot and Rhodes is looking pensively at his shoes.
. If you jump into Reed Richards’ death rip of doom, you— you shoot me a text first. Asshole. Asshole,” Tony repeats, and throws his arms around Steve again, burrowing his face in Steve’s neck.
The workshop was getting so crowded that he was heavily considering outsourcing his smashing, but this morning something seemed to shift. He woke up with Steve draped on top of him and snoring in his ear, and his whole body suddenly felt restless and ready, chock full of the kind of buzzing energy he’s sorely, sorely missed.
“Uh-huh,” Tony says, clearly amused.
“Oh my god,” he says, surveying the brownies with renewed interest. “That’s— Jesus. Did he make them?”
“For what?” Tony asks, resting his cheek on his arms.
Steve doesn’t need to tell him to shut up this time. He just tugs him down, presses their lips together, and makes him.
“Thanks for the warning,” Steve says shortly. “Why are you here?”
And Steve, after a couple seconds’ thought, starts stumbling his way through a story about the USO girls putting him in makeup and teaching him how to pop his hip on beat. Unfortunately they never did find a skirt that fit him quite right, but that didn’t stop Millie, the oldest one of the bunch, from asking Senator Brandt if he could spare the money for a costume that would fit her heavyset sister.
“Well,” Steve’s mouth tips into a crooked, humorless smile, “If you think it’ll tire you out, old man—“
“Yeah?”
“You gonna call me?” Steve asks, leaning back against the pillows, smile soft and sated. “You never call your hookups.”
Tony splutters. “I was trying to be domestic! Like, husband material!”
“Then why don’t you quit?” Steve asks, wondering if that’s overly blunt a split-second too late.
“I know, but—“
Tony wins, like, six times before Steve gets fed up and throws the paper football at his face, actually managing to give him a paper cut above his eyebrow. When MJ comes to tell them the drill is over, she sees Steve holding a damp paper towel to Tony’s forehead as they both converse in low, amused voices. She watches them for a couple seconds, then backs away from the door with a self-satisfied smirk.
“I’m serious,” Steve insists, trailing his hand lightly down the dip of Tony’s spine. “I think it’s— did you change your hair?”
When Riri arrives an hour and a half later, she bounds into the workshop with a strange frown on her face, the same one she adopts when a piece of her tech is being particularly contrary.
On the morning of the fourth day, a tiny darkskinned girl with google marks around her eyes and oil stains all over her cheeks turns up on Tony’s doorstep.
“You expect too much of yourself,” Steve shakes his head, expression sad and mild as he stirs the pasta, “you always do. Nobody ever grows out of making mistakes, Tony, no matter how normal their childhood was. Seems like Riri’s going to build the armor with or without you, because some people, no matter how hard they fight it, were never meant to be normal. She wants more, and she’s one of the few people capable enough to get it on her own.”
so close. “How can you— he’s a person. We’re all people, I know that’s hard for you to remember while you’re sitting on the top floor of the ugliest building in Manhattan, but—“
“Three dogs, max.”
Tony’s in a losing fight against a smile as he claps his uninjured palm over Steve’s mouth, “Hawaii, you asshole. Though I’m starting to think it wouldn’t be far enough away from your high-and-mighty eyebrows.”
And, well. There’s no denying that Tony needs him, too.
She helps, surprisingly. It only happens every few months, and Steve always makes him go to therapy the next morning. That helps, too.
Everything in Tony just
They barely break apart in time to clean up the place and get ready. Steve makes them do it in separate bathrooms because he point blank refuses to greet guests with flushed cheeks and sex hair. The resulting cold shower is effective right up until Steve emerges from the opposite side of the penthouse wearing a deep blue button-down that looks so good he can’t possibly have picked it out for himself.
“Love you, too.”
“I didn’t fake my vacations,” Tony says, pausing to take a small sip of his hot chocolate. “But I did-- I mean, I
She looks at him with wide, imploring brown eyes. Unlike with Peter, he does not fall for it.
They work for seven hours that day, and then seven hours the next. Tony calls Ms. Williams three times to tell her Riri’s fine, she’s just working, tells her to say the word and he’ll send her home. Tony can hear the hesitation in her voice - knows she’s conflicted because if she asks Riri to come, Riri will undoubtedly throw a fit over it and lock herself up in her room, so they won’t spend any time together anyways. The effect will be much the same if Tony forcibly sends her back, except with the added bonus of sulking.
“Is this supposed to embarrass me?” Tony asks, arms folded over his chest. “Because I maintain that I kicked ass in this fight.”
When the bell hooked to the front door tingles to signal the entrance of a customer, Steve looks up and finds that he’s
“I’ll see you later, Nat,” Steve reaches over to squeeze her arm briefly. “And it was nice to meet you, James.”
Tony snorts. “Everyone in the world loves this song.”
“Because I think I’m hallucinating Steve,” Tony pauses and shoves his glasses back up his nose, staring harder at Steve like somehow that’ll make him disappear. “And it’s a really intense hallucination. He looks so real.”
But it’s not like that, now, it just can’t be. With Steve laid out in front of him and a quarter of an edible at the pit of his stomach, there’s nothing to do but take his time and get reacquainted with all the perfect imperfections of Steve’s mouth-watering body. Steve is so easy for it, too, just spreads out and lets Tony do whatever he wants, kissing him with sweet, searching lips and breath that tastes like chocolate.
In the back of Tony’s mind, he knows what this is starting to look like. A home (the Tower), a kid (Ruby), and a husband (Steve). It’s the life he’s always been afraid of — the life he never thought he’d ever, ever want.
This is how he discovers that America’s skin is bulletproof.
“There’s something about a man in a kilt,” Pepper muses, eyes raking appreciatively over the screen, “Even when that man is Mel Gibson.”
His confusion only intensifies as Tony slows to a stop next to a giant open field with impeccably trimmed grass. He makes Steve get out and walk all the way down the incline, until the (brownish and ugly) waters of the Hudson are visible in front of them, daylight glinting off the current. The sun is so bright that it’s already starting to pink up Steve’s skin, and he knows for a fact they’re going to have to pick up a tube of aloe on the way home.
“You wanna sit out here for a bit?” Tony asks, chest still heaving a little.
On Steve’s last day in D.C., Tony wakes up at five in the morning to see Natasha Romanoff sitting on top of his dresser.
His eyes flick briefly to Steve’s mouth, then back up again. “That’s debatable.”
He turns off his phone before he has a chance to read the response, but if he spends the whole of his six hour flight smiling softly at his sparkling water, that’s nobody’s business but his.
“You can’t stop any of them from doing this, Tony,” Steve says, shaking his head. Tony looks at him and finds Steve already staring, eyes kind and attentive as ever. “You can discuss it with their parents. You can advise them on a different career path. You can try to keep saving the world yourself. But the fact that they’ve all gotten this far — it just means they’re really determined to do some good.”
“You know if you finish that, there just might be a prize at the bottom.”
“Not until you talk to me.”
There’s a tentative pause in the recording that, for some reason, makes Steve’s breath catch a little in his chest.
Tony proceeds to rattle off a list of deeply disturbing suggestions, and for reasons that are entirely incomprehensible, Steve can only lean back against the headboard and think
There’s a moment’s pause, then all three of them nearly sprain something in their haste to knock on the wooden edges of the countertop.
“Please,” Tony starts, voice icy in a way that feels utterly foreign, “tell me, how could Brock fucking Rumlow possibly be relevant to this conversation?”
“Steve,” Tony says — desperately, because the thought of losing this man, the thought of burning food for literally anyone else for the rest of eternity, is suddenly too much to bear. “Steve, I love you. I love you more than I love anything else in the world. I just don’t know if I’m—“
“Alright, Lindsay Lohan, that’s enough of that,” Tony steps forward, places a tentative hand on Steve’s shoulder to keep him upright. Steve looks at him with those ridiculously lurid eyes, a strange contrast against the shadows that seem to have subsumed the rest of his face. “I’m not sending you home like this. Hop in the shower.”
“I love you,” Steve breathes, smoothing his hands down Tony’s neck.
At first it’s deeply and profoundly terrible. Tony’s eyes strain against the harsh fluorescent lights in the gym, Natasha keeps trying to strangle him with her thighs, the whole area just smells like old tires for no apparent reason.
“Hey yourself,” Tony shoots back, settling his hands on Steve’s hips. Tony realizes Steve is wearing a Stark Industries sweatshirt from his own closet — so big on him that it’s almost slipping off one of his shoulders. Tony brushes the hair out of his eyes, stares into that clear blue and feels all the tension drain out of his body. “God, you’re beautiful.”
“Art’s great,” Tony shrugs noncommittally, taking a small sip from his glass. “Artists are sexy.”
“You could’ve just told me if you wanted to take me home,” she grumbles.
“Steve,” Tony says, capturing Steve’s wrist in an impatient grip. His eyes are bright and laughing and he’s grinning that grin Steve loves, the one that makes him look just a little bit crazy. “Steve
They pile onto one end of the couch, Tony’s head tucked against Rhodey’s shoulder, Pepper’s head tucked against his. They down some of Steve’s heart-shaped sugar cookies and Tony semi-successfully evades any questioning about where they came from.
“Real?” Tony suggests, mouth curving in a sad, knowing smile.
“Yet I’m still winning! Funny how that works.”
interested.
“Forever. She accepted a job opening down here. We’re looking for a fourth person to sign the lease for fall.”
2. Sent a memo for a ‘team building retreat’ in the company gym, though they happen to be the only two staff members to actually show up.
Until, the Avengers take down a HYDRA base in the rural south, and Tony flies deadstick for the first time since New York.
“So when you said—“
“Really? Where?”
“It’s not gonna be a problem. You won’t even see him, he’s, like, an engineer, right? He designs weapons?” Sam urges, muffled voices audible in the background of the call. Steve has so far resisted the urge to interrogate Sam about his summer roommates — more specifically, whether they are cleaner and smarter and just generally cooler than him and Bucky — but that does nothing to suppress his curiosity.
“Pffft. They’re not serious about that.”
“It’s all over your Instagram,” Tony says, and then, upon hearing those words aloud, instantly realizes how ridiculous they sound. “....oh. Barnes or Wilson?”
“How is he?” Steve mouths, sinking into the chair up against his bedside and reaching to stroke gingerly over Bucky’s knuckles. His face is a little cut up and there’s bruising around his collar and his chest. His arm is in a sling. Steve's heart aches for him.
Steve couldn’t stop his jaw from dropping if he tried.
Tony exhales half a quiet, mocking gasp, “
As he looks, Tony stretches his sore arms out in front of him, shoves an arm up under his tank top to scratch at his shoulder. He’s been at this for hours and his entire upper half is damp with sweat. It should be gross but it’s kind of amazing.
“My brain is very impressive.”
Rhodey drives himself and Pepper up in a rental car. It’s a red Prius, and Tony can’t stop smiling as it pulls into the driveway. He pushes his sunglasses up on his head and jogs down the steps of the porch to meet them.
“Absolutely not,” Tony snorts into the rim of his mug, downing half his coffee in one gulp.
(That’s a lie, actually. Tony’s proposed many, many times, and Rhodey’s said no, which means he’s thinking about it, so anything’s possible.)
“You know,” Steve says thoughtfully, looking up at Tony with mirthful blue eyes. “I think I still have it.”
He’s not Tony’s kid. Peter belongs to someone else, owes answers and justifications for doing this to someone else. He repeats this in his mind once, twice, three times, but the knowledge does nothing to abate this looming sense of responsibility, the one that clouds Tony’s judgment and makes it hard to sleep. He needs a fucking drink.
He’s not the same as before the snap, that comfort with permanence and domesticity has been replaced with the crushing anxiety that his mere presence is enough to create a catastrophic disturbance in the course of the universe. Most nights he wakes up choking on his own breath, and during the others he doesn’t sleep at all. Pepper can’t be his caretaker and his partner - they moved past that sort of dynamic years ago, and it’d be a disservice to them both to go back.
“Put down the scotch, Tony.”
“I see,” Steve says, still thoughtfully rubbing the ears of the dog in his lap. “And, sorry, sweetheart, I’m a little slow tonight, why are
, he thinks, watching Riri and America go at it, Riri outfitted in a shiny new suit of armor and America making full use of her portal popping abilities.
He’s about to say something enticing about a Twinkie when he notices his husband is staring very intently at his forehead.
“Genetics,” Steve says shortly, “what’s wrong? Are you okay?”
Riri complains loudly and pouts, but Steve is obstinate, standing in front of her with a small, patient smile and enormous arms folded over his chest. He evades her questioning about what ‘out’ means, evades everything she says entirely, really, until she pushes up off the floor, takes the welding goggles off her face, and concedes to follow him upstairs. Tony trails behind both of them, amusement blooming in his chest.
“Piss off, Steve.”
Tony wakes up and the first thing he sees is a flurry of white powder outside, a thin layer of snow sticking to the grass. He relinquishes the warmth of the comforter to get a closer look, pressing the bare soles of his feet onto the cool wooden floors and stumbling over to the window.
“I know,” Steve placates, mouth tipping into a teasing smile. “And I believe you believe he’s a good person.”
“I love Smash Day,” he declares.
The guy who definitely wants to sleep with him has left, and Tony is still staring at Depressed Sweater, and Depressed Sweater is still staring back, like they’re locked in some sort of telepathic mind battle. It’s Tony who breaks first, surprisingly enough, looking down at his drink and wondering with considerable gravity if it has been spiked.
“Hey,” he says, flushed and breathless.
The audio cuts more cleanly this time, and the photos of Rhodes are swept away, suddenly replaced with pictures and recordings of Brock. It takes a moment for Steve’s brain to comprehend what he’s seeing, but the second he does his stomach starts to sink.
As it turns out, Tony’s one and only resolution does hold fast in the New Year. He’s not sleeping with his ex-husband anymore — he’s sleeping with his partner, his best friend, and the love of his life.
He hopes to leave before Steve wakes up, because he’s a coward like that, but he accidentally stabs his toe on the nightstand and his resulting grunt of pain makes Steve’s eyes flutter open.
“Barnes had one?” Tony’s mouth nearly drops.
Still, she makes James Rhodes stand in the sweltering late August heat for another hour and a half. Bucky eventually leaves the crawlspace, grumbling about how everyone over 25 has cooties, and Sam has to leave, too, to get ready for work.
“We got

Steve, however, has absolutely nothing better to do, not for this afternoon. So he stays, reads articles on his phone, refreshes his email, and listens to Natasha put a military officer through the kind of torture that might make the villains at Guantanamo shiver.
One day, about three weeks into his tenure at Arc, Peter approaches Steve while he’s in the studio. He’s working on painting a few mock-ups for some of the posters they’re going to distribute as prizes for a competition that’s a part of the youth initiative. It’s still surreal that Pepper, the interns, and the rest of the staff at Arc believe people would be happy to receive his art as a prize for anything, but Natasha keeps telling him (a little hypocritically, he might add) that he needs to be nicer to himself, so.
“Because I’m building you a house.”
“No,” Steve says immediately, then shifts a little, trying to decide if Tony’s condescending towards him or…doing something else. “—yeah. Maybe. I have a lot of opinions.”
“It wasn’t that embarrassing,” Steve says carefully, eyes flicking up to meet Tony’s. Steve knows it’s the softest he’s ever sounded or looked when addressing him, and Tony looks surprised at the treatment, so, naturally, Steve can’t help but choose this moment to blurt out, “Did you tell Rhodes that Natasha had real feelings for him? That she’s in California right now?”
“JARVIS sets it up for me.”
Steve gets a job at an art gallery in Brooklyn. Rhodes' Instagram slowly fills up with embarrassingly couple-y pictures of Natasha. Bucky, to everyone’s shock, stops serial dating, and starts shooting more and more longing looks at Sam. Steve knows they’re going to have to have a conversation about that eventually, but it’s about all the relationship drama he can take for the rest of this year.
He tries again.
Steve grunts in agreement. Tony studies the lines of his face, shadowy and imprecise in the faded warmth of Tony's room. His hair has been rumpled out of that meticulously straight part and his lips are red where he's been biting them, which is something he does when he's focusing. He also, on occasion, makes a face which involves squinting and sticking the tip of his tongue through his teeth. Tony would really love to capture that one on camera one of these days.
It’s 9:30 by the time Riri has moved onto needling Rhodey (albeit in a slightly less aggressive fashion). Tony makes her eat a little food, ‘cause she supposed to be there for dinner, and keeps a careful eye on the clock.
Steve doesn’t. He’s texting Sam, trying to get ahold of him. They’re three hours ahead in New York, so Sam should be finishing his shift any minute now. He’s the closest to Mount Sinai — he needs to, he needs to go—
It’s over in a second and a half, clearly only meant to be some kind of goodbye, but, judging by the sudden surprise on Steve’s features, not the one he’d intended to dispense. He’s stunned Tony into inaction, too, his fingers hovering over his tablet as they breathe lightly against each other’s mouths.
But Steve, goddamn Steve, just makes his way behind the kitchen counter with this amused little smile on his face, presses a kiss to Tony’s cheek, and says “oh, sweetheart. You cooked.”
“Very unfortunate,” Steve nods in faux-sympathy, ruffling Tony’s hair. He glances at Peter, whose pacing seems to have picked up in speed. Steve wonders if he should intervene, or just scoop Tony up in his arms and head upstairs. Peter could have this floor, really. Wasn’t like they used the kitchen anyway.
“And you wore those tight little yoga pants? And demonstrated just how aptly you can fold yourself in half, in full display of anyone who might happen to be refilling their coffee in the kitchen?”
But the second it’s threatened in literally any way, Tony has a full on conniption, as evinced by ReedRiftGate 2k18. Tony still can’t talk about that without his eye twitching.
“Cool.”
Steve shoots him a hurried glance over his shoulder. “Why would I be making pancakes?”
“Getting lucky?” Tony repeats, the air quotes heavily implied. “What are you, 102?”
It’s only one, two, three beats of silence before they’re coming together like magnets, coincidentally right beneath one of the many mistletoes strung up in the apartment. There is something brutally honest in the press of Tony’s lips, like he’s saying ‘here I am, every fucked up thing about me laid on the table, please love me anyways’. Steve can only hope that he’s adequately conveying the following response: ‘I never, ever had a choice’. Tony wraps his arms around Steve’s neck and Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s waist and it feels— it feels perfect. It feels like coming home.
They gather their coats and leave without saying goodbye to anybody. It’s a little irreverent, and Steve would feel guilty about it on any other evening, but he figures they’ve both saved the universe enough times to be entitled to a measure of rudeness now and again. Tony has the car take them to a hole-in-the-wall pizza joint that’s covered in neon signage and woefully lacking in customers of any kind. Steve and Tony appear to have the place to themselves, though Tony whispers that he thinks the ancient, hunched over old man in the corner might not actually work there.
And then it— and then it changes into a whole other thing, and not because Tony’s been an idiot, no, this time,
Steve frowns. “How do you even know that?”
When he’s finally fought his way to the edge of the crowd, he heaves a sigh of relief and settles into one of the stools propped up against the bar. He holds onto his self-control for half a minute before giving up and attempting to fish his phone out of his criminally tight pants.
It starts mostly by accident.  Tony is sitting on the bed pretending to do paperwork, Steve is sitting on the floor darning his socks. (Yeah, literally darning his socks. Tony has told him a thousand times that they can just buy him new ones or stronger ones, but Steve says it relaxes him, so whatever.)
“Congratulations, Mr. Stark,” he sniffles, and then moves to stand beside Rhodey. Rhodey hands him a handkerchief and he blows his nose very, very loudly. Tony tries not to wince at the sound, but he thinks he might let something slip anyways because Peter starts looking reproachfully at his shoes. Tony’ll have to fix that later. The solution will probably (definitely) depend on copious amounts of wedding cake.
“Hope your friend’s not datin’ Stark.”
Viz puts his hand on his chest and laughs a little, then makes a face like the simple sound of it has startled him.
It’s no use trying to keep him out, Tony supposes. He learned a long time ago that he could plaster his whole body with signage declaring ‘WARNING: HAZARDOUS MATERIAL’, and it would only further tempt Steve Rogers’ self-immolating tendencies.
“Okay,” Steve chews on the inside of his cheek, wishing he knew what on earth he was going to say, “okay, yeah. I’m gonna go talk to her. Jesus.”
“You should get some rest, boss.”
“I don’t want to live in Kansas,” Steve turns to him, and the look on his face steals the breath right from Tony’s lungs. He wraps his arms around Tony’s waist, lifts Tony off the ground, and kisses Tony’s laughing mouth. “You idiot. I love you so fucking much.”
After Kate there’s Eli, another one of Steve’s. Steve’s personality seems to be split evenly between Eli and America - America has his temper, his wit, his occasional arrogance, and Eli has his meticulous tactical mind, his seriousness, that solemn, steady part of Steve filled with patriotic purpose. Tony watches in quiet recognition as the other kids, in the absence of Steve or sometimes Tony, slowly start to look to Eli for guidance. He emerges as a sort of natural leader, and even Tony can’t find something snarky to say about that.
“You did. Stubborn.”
Again.
Tony pushes past the cereal and easily fishes out some intriguing shortbread, a couple heart-shaped jam-filled cookies, and a bag of Steve’s weird healthy Terra chips. He’s about to gather up his hoard and head back to the couch when he spies an unassuming little tin wedged in the very back of the cupboard, cartoon reindeers dancing around the rim. Attached to the bottom is a simple tag with the word ‘enjoy’ scrawled in slightly murder-y handwriting. Intrigued, he reaches inside and pulls the tin out completely, popping the lid with his thumb and surveying the brownies inside.
Nobody answers for a second. Tony’s looking at Peter now, taking his arm in a solid, comforting grip. MJ and Ned are looking at their shoes. Dread settles into the pit of Steve’s stomach.
Tony pretends he’s still working, but really he’s watching Steve sink into a deep, fitful sleep, the kind that makes him snore frighteningly loudly. When Tony had first met him, he clocked about 3 hours of rest a night. These days it’s closer to 9, and Tony can even make him forgo a morning run with careful employment of his feminine wiles.
Peter looks stubborn, Led looks scared, and the other one looks.... the same as she did when they first initiated conversation, cool and critical.
Tony doesn’t say it, but Steve hears it in the silence between them anyways:
That makes something catch in Tony’s chest, and, in lieu of saying something sentimental and ridiculous, he tugs a little too hard on Steve’s hair.
"Not yet he doesn't. I bought him a basic tactical one for Christmas, he sleeps with it strapped to his thigh."
“No kidding. Think she’s spent, like, thirty minutes with us the whole reception.”

“I don’t sleep as well as I used to,” Steve says, voice injected with a forced type of casual that neither of them believe.

“Pepper Potts approached me.”
“Come on, Steve, you took direction remarkably well a mere six hours ago. I have the very vivid memories to back it up.
“No,” Steve says, leaning over to press a delicate kiss on Ruby’s nose. She licks his cheek appreciatively.
When Tony fumbles into the penthouse after the Longest Day Of Meetings In The History Of Ever, he’s tired, hungry, and cranky from having to stare at ugly old people the entire day. He just wants to change into something comfortable and eat approximately five cheeseburgers.
“It’s— it’s been in my bag, I keep it on silent during the workday. What’s going on, guys? Who’s been calling?”
When Tony blinks awake in the morning, he realizes several things in slow, drooping succession:
“There are parts of Brock’s story that are true — he was hired to Stark Industries before Howard died. And Howard promoted him. But he didn’t tell you the actual reasons he got fired — which are, I think, displayed pretty clearly for you here. This isn’t even half the footage I have on this asshole. There was also some inappropriate fraternizing with one of our interns who had, like, just turned eighteen. No feed for that one — you’ll just have to take it on faith.”
She’s pretty funny, so he invites her down to the workshop. He doesn’t work with her on her armor - he can’t bring himself to do that - but they tinker with the truck’s engine together, and he gives her a crash course on building an AI with personality.
, says Harpreet in Reception. Even the lady who runs the whole operation, Virginia “Please, call me Pepper” Potts, has a tiny framed photo of her, Tony, and Rhodes at Niagra Falls from a couple years ago.
