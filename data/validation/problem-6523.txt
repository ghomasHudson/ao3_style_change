“It is time for you to sleep,” Thor said as he helped the drunk, stumbling super soldier out of the room. “You are doing your grief no honour by trying to drown it out.”
Something was wrong with Tony, Steve knew the second he walked into the lab. Tony was making frustrated noises and banging his tools around like he didn't care if he broke anything. He'd never known Tony to treat his things with such blatant disregard, he'd often heard him wax lyrical about how without his tools he couldn't exercise his genius. As he slowly moved to get closer to him, before Tony had seen him, Tony let out a painful roar, threw the wrench he was holding across the lab and pulled off his protective goggles. As he turned he spotted Steve.
Tony looked at him, waving a screwdriver in his direction, “Just because I am into women does not mean I can't be into guys as well you know, it's not the forties any more,” but there was no malice in his eyes, just a smile. “And I could say the same thing about Peggy.”
“I’m fine,” came the reply with the hiss of breath being drawn between clenched teeth, “Just got a little hot for my liking.”
“It's the nightmares I can't deal with, Steve. I thought I'd got them under control, I thought I was on top of them. Pepper was always there to deal with me when I woke up... but she left me. She left me because I'm a piece of shit and I can't hold on to anything good. Then, at the worst fucking possible time, a building falls on me. I can't sleep any more, and Pepper isn't here to help and it's all just fucking building up and I can't deal with it. I feel like I'm going to explode.”
Tony rubbed his head, hoping he wouldn't have a bruise. “Yeah,” he replied, “Just tired. I'm fine Cap,” he said as Steve tried to look at his forehead. He waved him away and sat at the table with his favourite coffee miraculously in front of him. He let out a faint grin before catching Natasha looking at him with her eyebrows raised. He quickly looked back into his coffee cup.
He laid a hand on Tony’s shoulder and shook gently, “Tony, wake up, it’s just a nightmare. Wake up.”
“My hero,” he joked as he feigned a swoon before a steely look hardened in his eyes, “Just don't tell Barton or I will kill you.”
Steve sat in the car, wondering where the driver was taking him. He was under orders from Tony not to reveal his destination. Steve was wearing one of his new shirts, a pair of simple light coloured pants and his leather jacket.
By the third movie, Tony was happily asleep. His head was gently resting on Steve's shoulder. Thor and the others were still riveted to the movie. Probably because they hadn't spent the last three days subsisting on coffee and occasional naps. At the end of the movie when the others made to move they spotted Tony and Steve happily asleep together, heads resting on each other and their hands suspiciously close together. Natasha smiled and shushed Thor. Clint took a photograph as Bruce found a blanket to drape over them. They all quietly filtered out to their own rooms to sleep, leaving the two men to their own dreams.
Steve stared at Tony, floundering in his thoughts. Could he do this? Was Tony strong enough to get through it? He steeled himself, running his hand through his hair, “What happens between the old one coming out and the new one going in.”
Tony must have been on the floor for a good ten minutes, if not longer, just crying. Steve just sat there, his presence letting Tony know he wasn't going through this alone and that he would be there for him. As Tony calmed down and wiped the tears from his cheeks, Steve stood up and held out a hand. Tony looked up at him, paused for a moment before grabbing Steve's wrist and pulling himself up.
He walked over, and with an almighty roar, crushed the front of the car into the ground. His eyes flashed green as he caught himself and began breathing deliberately again. It felt good to unleash some of the pent up energy in such a cathartic manner. He knew Clint would be getting regular check-ups now.
“I’ve been so obnoxious,” he smiled and groaned, “I mean, playing Coldplay full tilt through the tower?
Tony smiled and waved an arm dismissively at Steve as he left the boxing ring and wiped his face down with a towel. Before he turned to leave his smile faded as he called to Steve in a serious tone, “You know, thanks for not treating me like broken glass.”
Tony piped up, “Hey, I asked you on this date, I'm paying. Some of the benefits of being a billionaire.”
Steve followed him, his thoughts on Tony and the panic that had run through his system like lightening when he thought he'd been hurt.
The others looked at him concerned as he realised the colour must have drained out of his face as well. He turned to them as he put the phone down on the counter, trying to steady his shaking hands.
Bruce was walking down the street, just taking his usual amble through the streets of the city, taking in the hustle and bustle around him and observing people with normal lives go about their business. He enjoyed just taking in everything around him, pretending that he could fit in, but since the whole Avengers thing he noticed a few more people looking at him in the street. He didn't know if he was comfortable with that, but mostly they left him alone and often the look was not of fear, but rather just of general recognition.
Steve thought, before turning and walking very deliberately calmly out of the door. Bruce smiled to himself.
Steve walked into the lab but couldn't see Tony. Worry kicked in a little as he called out to his friend.
Steve ran his hands through his hair again, “I don't know. One moment he was fine, fighting the bots. Then my uniform got shredded and the next thing I know after dealing with that was Tony crashing. I thought he was really hurt. It was scary.” He sighed again. “I'm always so frightened of losing any one of you, especially Tony.”
He practically barged through the door of the doctor's office, and found Dr Neglectful MD standing uncomfortably close to one of the nurses. She looked at Bruce with what looked like relief before turning and running out of the office.
Steve stopped dead, and Tony saw his shoulders tense. After a moment, he turned around with an obviously strained smile.
"JARVIS, lower the volume please.” The music instantly lowered to a much more manageable level as Steve spun round to look at Clint.
“You are in danger of falling into a stupor,” came Thor’s voice from the doorway. A glass smashed into the wall beside him. “Know I will not relent to your requests for Asgardian mead in the future.”
Tony got back on his feet and flew through the Iron Man sized hole in the wall to stick another Doom bot full of rockets. “I'm fine Cap. Just a minor mishap. All good.”
Tony sat down on a stool as the air seemed to leave him, tears leaving greasy trails on his face. After a few moments Steve took a faltering step towards him. Tony looked up at him, pain evident in his eyes.
“Leave me alone,” Steve protested as he felt a strong arm pull him up off the couch and hold him under the arms.
Bruce growled at the doctor, “My friend is writhing in pain because you don't have the time of day to stop preying on the nurses, care to explain yourself?”
They walked into the restaurant, Tony confirming his booking for Stark, table for two. They were lead over to their table and their jackets taken off of them. Steve looked uncomfortable surrounded by so many people dressed up. When the menus came he baulked at the prices.
Steve looked him dead in the eyes, “Of course not. I will be here to help you through this. We're Avengers, we do things together.”
“Trying to capture any information from the lab cameras,” Steve called in, watching the recording intently to see if you could make anything out that they hadn't already gleaned from hours of extensive running and re-running of data.
Steve was sure he was imagining a tone to Tony's voice that sounded almost jealous, “She's fine. I think she's coping well with the fact that her whole life has been blown.” He smiled, “You know, she spent every darn day trying to set me up on a date. I think she considered it a hobby.” He laughed as Tony mischievously cocked his eyebrow at him.
The room went silent at the noise of the phone hitting the floor. Steve was already on his feet and moving to the phone while Natasha was quickly heading for Bruce who had gone completely white. As she put an arm around his chest to stop him from collapsing Steve spoke into the phone.
“Aye,” Thor agreed, “It is organic yet it has great control over fire. It is not a being naturally of this world.”
He retreated into his thoughts, trying to remember any survival knowledge for this environment. He was taught from a young age how to protect himself should be find himself in certain situations, and since his experience in Afghanistan and building the armour he had worked hard to make himself feel invincible. One thing he had not trained for, however, was magically ending up in the middle of an unknown rainforest without his armour, without his phone and with no reference point for his friends to find him. He patted himself down, checking for injuries or anything else that might cause a problem. What he found instead was a bulge in one of his pants pockets. He reached in and pulled out a multi tool. He looked at the item in shocked confusion for a moment before letting a laugh escape his lips. He always had his penknife on him, just for the comfort of having tools at hand for any tinkering that might need done. It was such an ingrained habit that he’d completely forgotten that he had it. Maybe, just maybe, he had a chance.
Steve's heart may have stopped in his chest for a moment as he was faced with a choice that could affect him so drastically he couldn't quite comprehend it. Was he about to make a fool out of himself? At least he could check that Tony wasn't hurt.
Bruce looked up at him and nodded sharply. Steve offered him a hand up and the two men walked to stand by the ramp of the Quinjet.
This night was the worst Steve had seen him since he got back. He’d started to put some weight back on, his diet had been expanded slightly and he’d been in a good mood all day, even starting to show a bit of his old self, babbling on to Steve about his new ideas or why his old ideas didn’t work for a while before he got to the point of exhaustion and fell asleep. As Steve moved to pick him up the nightmares obviously started up again. Steve sighed sadly as Tony began to whimper and twitch.
Steve smiled, “It's warm...” He ran his hand across it's surface and peered closely at it. He examined it for around a minute before standing up and suddenly becoming awkward, a blush rising to his cheeks.
“Oh, I don't know. Possibly the look of utter disdain you're not so good at hiding from your team,” Steve banded back.
“He doesn’t have it, he left it on his lab bench for the experiment,” Steve explained. “He’s just got his pants, his shirt and his... his safety goggles.” He smiled wanly, remembering Tony’s jest.
“If I use my heavy tips designed for speed and punch I can definitely get through to it, there is something corporeal in there. That’s pretty much what I’ve got. I can’t seem to do much damage though!” Hawkeye replied with the strained voice of concentration and physical exertion. “God I wish I had some of those explosive water heads Tony’s developing!”
“No problem Cap,” he replied as he walked backwards, “I mean, I can't expect everyone to be on my level.”
“Tony, you can’t. We can handle this.” He struggled to keep his voice level, going for a low growl rather than the shouts he so wanted to unleash.
“Tony, I'm pretty sure you can hear me, and I wanted to get all of this off of my chest. I know this will make things awkward for you, and I know it will probably stop you being able to confide in me, but I don't think I can hold it in any longer, especially after what has happened to you.”
friends, Steve. Not before Tony and the team, and Tony was the one that allowed me to ever get close to people because he never treated me as anything other than a human being.”
“Well eventually it'll go down, they always do,” he replied. If he was being honest he was just glad he had something to concentrate on rather than still boiling over down in his lab.
Movie night at the Stark tower was always a big affair. Every Thursday they'd get as much popcorn, ice cream, soda and chips as humanly possible and take turns choosing a movie. This week, however, was extra special. Barton had decided that he needed to educate Steve on the wondrous magic of The Lord Of The Rings. The idea was met enthusiastically by all of the Avengers and as such a marathon was declared. Eleven hours of pure fantastical bliss, not including rest stops to restock on snacks and beverages. Clint lay across Natasha's lap as they sat beside Bruce on the big couch, while Thor took up the armchair which he had claimed for movie night the first time they'd ever suggested the idea. Steve and Tony took up the smaller of the two couches.
Clint smiled widely this time, “Hey, you don’t think I didn’t play all of the sad Whitney Houston songs top volume after Coulson died then you are sorely mistaken, my friend. I think Natasha even joined in once or twice!”
Natasha leaned in towards him, “You ask him out, or we'll tell him ourselves.” The threat came through loud and clear, chilling Tony to the bone. Now he had no choice.
The reporters stood and asked their questions, the run of the mill ‘where was it from’, ‘what was it’ and ‘is it going to come back’ somewhat blending in together. A woman in a red skirt suit stood up to ask her question, the team anticipating another bland same old question.
“At least it was my fault this time and not some crazed kidnappers,” he mumbled aloud as he looked around again. He wished he could remember what was safe to eat. He felt his resolve strengthen, his first task was to find a stream or river. Follow the stream flow and he should eventually reach people or the sea. Both of those options were better than staying where he was and waiting for rescue because no one knew where he was in the first place.
“The only thing those scars say to me is that you're strong. You've made it through things where any lesser man would have failed. You've turned yourself around, and you've proven to the world a thousand times over that Tony Stark is a good man. A strong man. A man willing to sacrifice himself for others. No one could ever call that weak.”
Steve sat outside the operating room, his head in his hands with tear streaked cheeks. He was still in his ripped uniform, he hadn't even stopped to change on his way from the battlefield to the hospital. The others had been practically force led to the debrief by Fury, but Coulson had let Steve know privately on the comm he would cover for him. The rest of the team, along with Fury and Coulson, had arrived an hour later, as Tony was in surgery. Steve had missed getting to see him outside his armour before he went in, though from what the doctors had said that was a good thing. Coulson had collected the armour, it was broken into pieces, huge puncture wounds through the chest and abdomen. They'd all heard his scream of pain, and the sudden cut off. Steve knew he would never forget that moment, those next seconds as he felt himself scream before the entire team went into overdrive. He remembered it like a dream, as if the whole thing had happened in slow motion. He was running across the asphalt, barging parasites out of the way, before almost climbing the creature. As he was making his way to Tony there was a loud explosion, a lurch and a horrible noise from the monster. It began to fall backwards, Steve holding on, still trying to make his way to Tony. As the monster hit the ground the tentacle around Tony fell away and Steve made the last few metres. He cradled Tony's limp suit in his arms as he franticly repeated his name. Thor landed beside him, ripping the face plate off as a helicopter lowered to a hover above them. A number of SHIELD medics dropped around them, pulling Steve away from Tony within seconds, getting Tony onto a back board and away to hospital as soon as physically possible. He'd been left, shell-shocked and frozen. He'd been so close, so close to telling Tony how he felt, and now he could have lost him forever.
Clint opened the door to Steve’s apartment and took in the scene. Steve was standing in the middle of the room with his eyes closed, standing stock still. Clint smiled wanly.
Steve frowned as he saw the red, angry skin that surrounded it, clear even through the layer of salve.
“Seriously Tony,” Steve said, “I don't want you to get hurt.” His brow creased as he stood up. “Bruce said you were in a de-briefing.”
Natasha put a hand on his shoulder as she looked at the sketches. They were all of Tony in some way or another. Leaning over a workbench, patting a bot on the head, mid-explanatory gesture...
“Come on, Tony,” he said softly as he picked the smaller man up. It still hurt to feel just how light he was in his arms. He gritted his teeth as Tony’s fingernails dug into his skin and walked him to his bedroom. The twitching got more and more distressed and the whimpers got louder. Steve laid him down on his bed and decided he couldn’t let Tony get stuck in that dream for another long night.
Strips of pants material were steaming dry over the fire, Tony had cleaned them in some of the hot water he’d intended to use for drinking. Instead the rest of the hot water had been used to clean his wound, he winced as the hot water set pain lancing through his foot and cleaned away the layers of much and dirt from the toe making sure the whole area was as clean as he could get it. He’d also cleaned off the metal bottle opener from his multitool. He’d measured it against his toe and one or two presses should cauterise the whole area the nail had once occupied, then he placed it on the edge of the fire pit to get the metal as hot as he could.
Steve opened his mouth to say something before his expression changed mid way, “But that wasn't... He didn't... You think
Steve swallowed, “I don’t know.” He took a deep breath and looked at their expectant faces, “And neither does JARVIS.”
Tony paced, and then stopped, his back turned to Steve. Then he began to remove his shirt. Bare torsoed, he lay a hand across his shoulder with his head bowed. Steve stood and walked towards him. As he got closer he saw the multitude of raised white lines criss-crossing Tony's shoulders, standing out against the rest of his skin. As he gently touched them with his fingers, Tony flinched.
“But seriously, that shot you pulled off from the back of the Doombot Clint, that was pretty amazing,” Steve smiled at the archer.
Steve braced himself as he saw the grenade like item land a few meters away. It exploded into a painful barrage of needle like water droplets, drenching Steve and giving him enough space and time to get off of the melting asphalt of the road and towards a more sheltered position.
Steve started to pace the lab, “You know, I almost didn't make it. It was the last switch to turn the system off, all I could think about was how many people were going to die, how you were going to die, and through all of that I had to switch it in seconds while Bucky tried to kill me.”
Thor was helping Clint go through the bits and pieces of inventions and plans left in Tony’s lab, hoping something useful would suddenly jump out at them
Tony took a deep breath and something hardened in Steve's eyes, “Now come at me with everything you've got.”
Tony nodded slowly as Steve walked out of the gym. He stood for a full two minutes, slightly stunned by what just happened and trying to calm his rapidly beating heart.
Everyone sat in their usual places. Clint, Natasha and Bruce all happily on the biggest couch, Thor in his armchair and Steve and Tony on the smaller couch. Tony noticed the other four Avengers occasionally giving he and Steve knowing looks or smiling between themselves after glancing in their direction. They spent most of the movie almost-holding-hands, their fingers brushing against each other's, sending electric signals through both of them. Steve held a bowl of popcorn on his lap, and every so often they'd both reach in together and blush gently. Any time Clint opened his mouth to say something he got another kick from Natasha.
“He's stable,” came the surgeon's reply. Natasha saw the relief in Steve's shoulders, as his eyes begin to well again. “But he suffered terrible injuries, it's going to take him a long time to recover. There were a couple of complications caused by the location of the injuries, but he should survive. The next few days are critical.”
Tony smiled another fake smile as people came up to him asking for pictures and autographs. Journalists wandered the hall to capture photographs of all of the Avengers in their formal wear as they attended another function put on to reward them for yet more heroic acts. Steve looked over and saw the obvious tedium in Tony's eyes, even from where he was standing talking to two very nice ladies in gowns. He politely excused himself and walked over to join Tony, posing for a photograph as a papparazo called their names.
He barely got a “Hi Steve” out before Steve was untying him, asking him how he felt and telling him off for being so careless. Tony flapped him off as he got free.
The flight to Itaituba felt like it took eons, each of the avengers simultaneously excited, anxious and scared of what they were going to find when they arrived. Bruce’s knuckles were white as his gripped the edge of his seat, Steve’s hand resting on his shoulder while his mind worked in overdrive, so much going on that he could only perceive it as almost white noise. Clint and Natasha sat in the front, concentration and determination painting deep grooves in their faces. Thor was uncharacteristically silent, standing towards the back of the jet with a concerned expression. It had taken them hardly any time to suit up and get in the air, though it did take Natasha a minute to break Bruce out of his shock. Steve had never moved so fast in his life, his heart beating at a thousand miles per hour. He’d spoken barely anything to Tony, knowing than time was of the essence, but hearing his voice through the phone had made him want to drop to the ground. That broken, cracking voice had sounded so alien, but yet so familiar.
Steve pulled in to a mostly empty gravel parking area and the two men climbed off the bike. Tony took his helmet off and attached it to a strap on the bike as Steve took out his own backpack from the saddle bag.
Steve sat by Tony's beside in the Critical Care Unit every day until he was slowly brought around from his medical coma. Before he was fully awake and transferred to a normal ward, Steve summoned all his courage to tell Tony just how he felt, without having to face the straight out rejection he would have any other time. He took a deep breath.
“We- We don’t have a timeframe on that,” Steve said, trying to make himself come across as untroubled by that statement. It didn’t work.
Steve looked at him, “You survived a fall from space and a hug from the Hulk, if you're glass then you're bulletproof.”
Tony had wires all over him, drips in his arm, salve on his blistered, sunburnt skin. His beard, and hair, had been shaved completely. Steve counted no less than five separate sets of stitches just from his chest upwards.
His first action upon being let out of hospital was to walk straight into his lab and give his bots a very thorough tune up. Steve had watched from the doorway smiling as Tony was surrounded by the eager bots before opening them up one by one and ranting at them about the state of their insides and
“Hey, no problem. Honestly, I was expecting you to take longer than this to get used to everything.”
Tony poured himself another scotch as he tinkered idly with a piece of circuitry. He tried to reconcile the knowledge that if he didn't ask Steve out the others were going to tell him and in doing so were going to tear apart his team. His family. However it went, whether Steve turned him down in person or just ignored what the others said, he was going to avoid him afterwards and Tony didn't want to lose what he'd just managed to find.
Even with the music loud and enough interesting half built inventions in front of him to keep him amused for days he found himself drifting off again after just minutes. He found himself imagining undressing Steve, running his hands over his body and being lifted onto the bed... He shook his head and asked JARVIS to turn off the music.
Steve sighed and leaned back in his chair, “Better. I think. I think I can work through it, anyway.”
Steve cocked an eyebrow at him, “Like I'd do that, Stark. You're not going to stop gloating for a week.”
“No!” Tony said, a little frustration coming through in his voice. “I spent the rest of my stay thinking about what you said. I hoped you'd come to visit, just
“Doombots, spotted in Seattle. Why Doom chose Seattle this time I don’t know, but at least NY and DC are getting a break.”
“You sure you don’t need to speak to a medic?” Steve asked with concern on his face as they followed down the corridor.
After a few hours he politely retired to his lab, overwhelmed with the huge amount of attention in such a short space of time after the monotony of the hospital. Everyone understood he needed to get back to his lab and fix something after so long without any ability to hands-on invent.
me, Steve! That’s just not right! Getting them out took way too much Vaseline and ducktape for any situation outside of the bedroom.”
Doom had obviously learned from his last battle with the Avengers. The bots had been upgraded and had obviously had improved tactical programming included in that. Without Iron Man in the air to provide constant updates from an aerial viewpoint with unbelievable maneuverability, always where he needed to be and always backing up whoever needed it at that exact moment everything was just so much harder.
Steve wasn't sure how long they stood there, taking strength from one another, but it was Tony who spoke first. He moved to lean against the worktop beside him.
“Well what am I supposed to do Steve?!” Tony shouted, stepping in towards the taller man in anger, “Am I supposed to just stand back and let you die? Is that what you want?”
He groaned and sat up as Steve's voice came through the comm, a hint of panic in his voice, “Tony, are you ok? What happened?”
The guests seated themselves as the minister began to speak, Steve and Tony intertwining their fingers and smiling at each other. Bruce could feel the love radiating from every person in the room, and was proud that Captain America had chosen him for his Best Man. This family was all he could ever had wished for and more.
“Then I find out that everything I became, the suit, was in danger because people thought I was still the man I had been. I was dying, but the only thing people cared about is that they could get a shiny new way to kill people out of me. So I did the only thing I could. I tried to self-destruct, without taking everyone with me. I had nothing left, I didn't care, and it scared me so I hurt myself because I had nothing left. I pushed away Rhodey and I pushed away Pepper. I didn't have anyone else.”
“Come on,” he said softly, “You can spare a bite to eat before you test it. It’ll still be there when you’re finished eating.”
“Steve?” Tony spoke softly, lifting his head from Steve's chest. “This is the best Christmas present I've ever had.”
Tony waved his hand, “It's fine. You and Jane need a place to get away from stuff. There's great hunting in the mountains around the house as well.”
“I don't think that's a good idea this time, I reckon we should let them work it out themselves. It hasn't been all that long since Pepper left. I'm not even sure
“Thank you… For not giving up on me. JARVIS told me you came down to talk to my bots while I was gone. That… means a lot.” Tony looked over at Steve who turned his eyes down and smiled faintly.
Tony raced back to his room. He felt like his skin was on fire and his heart was going to explode. When he turned his StarkPhone off silent he noticed a text message from Pepper.
Natasha glanced at the other couch again. Watching Steve and Tony sitting so close together but trying so hard not to accidentally touch was much more interesting than the movie the rest of the team were watching. It seemed the only people in SHEILD who didn't know they loved each other were actually Steve and Tony. Clint caught her eye and rolled his eyes in their direction, a smirk on his lips.
Natasha crept silently towards the figure standing atop the observation level. She kept her balance despite the buffeting winds, her hair drawn into a tight ponytail to prevent it blowing across her eyes and obscuring her vision. As she neared she drew the taser from her belt, holding it in front of her. One of Stark’s tinkerings, he swore this taser would be able to knock Doom out for long enough to neutralise him. She concentrated on her aim, the wind was gusting strongly and she needed to get him first try. Suddenly there was a crash and she was knocked forwards off her feet. She recovered with a front roll and came back up her to feet quickly, taser outstretched. She cursed in Russian as the bots formed a wall in front of her.
“You could have been killed, Tony! You are not ready to be in that suit, and those burns are damn proof of that!”
“Us, Tony. The Avengers. The X-Men. The Fantastic Four. Anyone who could stop them. Anyone who wouldn't just take it lying down. Anyone who wouldn't in the future.”
Within minutes the battle was over and the Avengers had re-grouped. Tony made sure to keep his visor down as he was confronted by a mostly naked Steve, who seemed pretty embarrassed about his situation.
After the laughter from one of the stories died down between them Tony gained a different expression.
“Uhh, nothing. I dunno what you're talking about. Oh, is that dinner?” he said in quick succession, obviously trying to divert Steve's attention.
Clint flicked a fry at Bruce as the Avengers settled down into a post-battle come down. They'd ordered from their favourite take-out and taken over the kitchen with half-discarded bits of kit. Bruce laughed as the team went over their favourite parts of the fight, their preferred way of letting off steam.
“You don't seem to be enjoying yourself,” Steve smiled at him, knowing full well Tony hated these events.
Natasha fired the taser, hoping that it would make its mark, but a strong gust of wind caught the prongs, carrying them away from the target. Natasha cursed again, dropping the taser and drawing her gun.
“GET OUT” he roared at the other Avengers, who were already at the door. Steve saw the Hulk smash his fists through the computer and table as he closed the locked the door.
Fresh sobs came over Steve as he felt Natasha sit beside him. So far the rest of the team had left him to his thoughts, staying in the relatives room waiting for news. He wasn't sure if he was relieved there was someone with him or not. She put her arm around his shoulders and he leaned in towards her.
“You're just so polite to JARVIS and DUM-E. I guess the rest of us just take them for granted, but you always thank them and say please. It's really... nice.”
Thor piped up, “I do not know why you Midgardians are so reserved when it comes to courtships. It is a great compliment to be considered worthy to be someone's mate!”
“That's all the shield,” came the reply, a slight colour coming to Steve's cheeks. He still found it strange to be praised for his physical ability.
JARVIS' voice rang out through the room, “I'm sorry sir, I believe this intervention to be in your best interest.”
Tony stopped scratching at his peeling nose as he saw Steve. It had taken him almost ten seconds, Steve noted.
As they stopped, Bruce went down to investigate what turned out to be a large-ish box. He carefully carried the box back up to the car, before opening it in front of Tony. Five very young kittens were mewing and clambering on top of each other. They had obviously not been cared for by whoever had tried to get rid of them so callously. Bruce put the box down on the passenger seat.
“He created a new element to power it. As far as I know the only atoms of that element all exist within that arc reactor, and they should give out a unique signature. That combined with hopefully the amplification of the signal through the nature of the arc reactor and the metal casing should allow us to triangulate him to at least a vague area.”
Tony’s eyebrows rose with a childlike fake innocence, “Yeeesssss?” He smiled in a ‘don’t be angry’ way.
The team simultaneously looked towards the ceiling in confusion as the sound of Coldplay came blasting through the sound system at an almost painful volume. They exchanged glances before Clint’s expression softened.
“I’ve had the alarm sounding since the moment he left my system, Captain.” There was a beat of pause, “Are you taking your food with you?” JARVIS sounded concerned.
Steve, or one of the other Avengers, tried to be in the lab as much as possible to make sure he was doing ok. Steve usually chose to be in there overnight as he slept so little, making sure that if Tony fell asleep he could take him up to bed. It became obvious quite quickly that Tony was suffering awful nightmares from his ordeal in the jungle. His fingernails often left crescent shaped marks in Steve’s arms as he carried him to bed.
Thor swallowed, “Do not apologise friend. We all despair at times, I was honoured you allowed me to be there to help, even a little.”
“Just a bit of tinkering then? Hmm?” Steve asked as Tony muttered under his breath, “What was that?”
aren’t now.” He ran his fingers through his hair in frustration, “I can’t lose you again! Don’t get yourself killed just after we got you back.”
There was a knock on the table as Bruce put down his plate of bacon and eggs, sliding into the chair beside Steve. They shared a reassuring glance, and Steve squeezed Bruce’s shoulder.
Steve sighed as he pulled the white t-shirt on, having changed into his comfy grey sweatpants. Bruce buttoned up his shirt and gave Steve a look.
Bruce looked at him, “It's... not that simple, Thor. In fact it's probably one of the most confusing things any
“No. There's no way I'm talking to SHIELD about this, don't you dare,” Tony replied with a flash of life brightening his eyes for a moment.
“Everything you've described, all of the things you've lived through demonstrate that. A lesser man would have crumbled, but you Tony, you made it through. You made it through a better man, a man who is helping change the world in an overwhelmingly positive way.”
After what felt like an eternity they were allowed to leave, Fury holding Tony briefly back to check if he needed any further medical support. When he left the room he found Steve standing waiting for him, hands awkwardly in his pockets trying to look nonchalant, while the others continued down the hall.
Tony was too exhausted from his nightmare filled sleep to even protest the contact, “I'm fine Steve. Really. I'm just... working through some stuff.”
A few minutes later Steve stood up and wandered across to one of the worktops on the other side of the lab. He moved a few things before getting slightly upset.
The team all rode home together, exhausted and happy. Tony leant against Steve's shoulder in the car, half asleep. As they arrived at the tower Steve gently shook Tony's shoulder to wake him properly and they walked hand in hand into the tower, Tony still a little slow.
Tony was still standing frozen, before his brain caught up and he looked down at whatever he was tinkering with. “No no, it's fine. I just... I just thought I was the one into guys out of us.”
“How do you think your friends will fare with another of their team mates fallen?” he said, his tone chilling.
“Thanks,” Steve said sheepishly. He smiled, “Next time I ask for Asgardian mead though, please don’t actually bring me any. I forgot how bad the day after can be.”
“No Tony, you're... you're...” He spotted Tony looking at him with raised eyebrows, “Oh who am I kidding, you have enough ego for the both of us.”
“Sure, your stitches are out, your scars have gone pink and your nails are starting to grow again, but you and I both know that doesn’t mean you’re back to normal!”
Steve felt his heart quicken a little as Tony pulled away from him. He saw dampness on his cheeks where he’d obviously let a few quiet tears run. Tony looked at him with exhausted eyes.
Steve let out a small laugh, “But seriously,” he said, looking at Tony intently, “Thank you for not treating me like a kid. You're a very patient teacher.”
Over the next week Tony never had to worry about forgetting breakfast, Steve was always there with his smile and unassuming niceness. Tony spent a lot of time down at the lab, working on his new pet project. Then on Friday, after a night spent watching mindless action films, he found a backpack and a pair of boots waiting for him on the breakfast table along with a bigger breakfast than usual. A note sat against his coffee cup.
Steve walked down the stairs to Tony's lab on his nightly check. Sure enough he found Tony asleep on the workbench, an empty scotch bottle beside him with a little left in a glass. He let out a slight sigh as he smiled at the sight of Tony so peaceful. Such a difference from his larger than life persona. He walked over and scooped Tony up from his chair, carrying him up to his room. As he lay him down on his bed and moved to tuck him in Tony stirred. He opened his eyes a crack and struggled to focus on Steve.
“Thanks Tony!” he heard Hawkeye say, before a “Oh wow, these are amazing!” as a horrific shriek filled the air and the oppressive, burning sensation on breathing lessened a little. “How are you able to get so much water into them?”
Tony started in the direction the noise had come from. He tried to shout, but he was barely able to produce a croak. He cleared his throat and called out again, knowing it was futile but he knew with all of his heart that he was the closest to rescue right now that he was probably ever going to get. It felt like an age but soon the trees around him started to thin. Holding his arm up against the bright sun he finally cleared the forest, feeling a hysterical giggle escape his lips as he laid eyes on the wide dirt road he had walked onto. The packed, bare earth felt strange beneath his feet and he dropped to his knees, too exhausted to cry. He wasn't sure how long he stayed that way, but he knew he had to make a decision. He had no idea how well travelled the road was, but judging by the scale of it he knew that either direction would eventually lead him to some kind of civilisation. The difficult part was not knowing which direction would get him there faster. After playing an internal game of eeny-meeny-miney-mo he decided to go left. He pulled himself off the ground and started trudging. The sun beat down on him relentlessly as he was no longer protected by the canopy, but he knew he needed to stay on the road to have a chance of being seen.
“When I got back from Afghanistan I was broken, Steve. I was broken. A man died to save me. Why? Men were killed by what I did. It's my fault. And when I got back, I found out that the one man I trusted, who was like a dad to me, had organised the whole thing because I was nothing but a nuisance to him.”
Bruce stood nervously at the front of the church beside a fidgeting Steve, looking around at the others standing in the pews. The rest of the Avengers sat smiling and joking with each other, Pepper and Coulson chatting happily about something or other. Nick Fury and Maria Hill looking slightly less serious that usual, maybe the hint of a smile gracing their faces. Other SHIELD agents the team had grown close to over the years they'd worked together. Bruce found it slightly against character that Tony Stark would be ok with such an intimate ceremony, but he'd do anything to please Steve, and Bruce got the impression he was almost relieved they kept it to close friends – family - only. Inside he was a hopeless romantic. Especially when Captain America was involved.
Tony felt something stir in his stomach as he watched at Steve go back to his reading. He took a deep breath and went back to his work.
“Evil vacation is over then,” Tony stated through the comm as he blasted another Doom bot. He weaved in between buildings as Steve and Natasha held the ground. Clint was picking bots off from the highest vantage point he could find, while Thor swept through where he was needed. The Hulk was just doing his own thing, his comforting roar echoing off the glass walls of the buildings. He swept past Steve and Natasha, destroying some more bots which had been about to attack from above.
“Can you open the door please JARVIS?” he asked, still preferring to get permission rather than barge in on Tony.
“Huh?” came Tony's reply, as he looked up to see Steve placing a couple of strips of bacon on a plate set at Tony's place. His mind struggled to catch up.
Steve turned as Tony began to walk towards to the door, “By the way Tony, next time you're tied to a chair you can always call me instead of Pepper. I'd probably get there quicker.”
“I couldn't bear to lose another person I love,” he said quietly, pausing before seeming to realise what he'd said. He looked at Bruce, colour rising in his cheeks. “Uhh... I mean...”
“If you don’t, I’m just going to stay sick,” Tony said softly, “The arc reactor was never made to deal with a rust problem. Which is something I’m going to fix in the next upgrade because holy hell, this sucks. The structure of the external casing has been compromised, Steve, and it’s only going to get worse. Eventually this dying thing in my chest,” he tapped his rusted, flaking reactor, “Is going to fizzle out. Or possibly explode. And it’ll take me with it. If you don’t help me with this then I probably won’t make it out of this hospital.”
Steve had to concentrate on what Tony was saying so he wouldn't drift off just watching him. He loved it when Tony got really into something, his eyes lit up and his smile brightened the whole room. He'd come to a new appreciation of Tony and how he worked during the time they had spent trapped together, after the Iron Man opened up his feelings.
“You're not a mess, Tony. You're a genius. Sometimes it can be hard to distinguish, but you're one of the strongest men I know.”
“It is when it gets out that Iron Man is scared of spiders. Last thing I need is DoomBots suddenly sprouting eight legs and climbing up walls.”
As he took the last couple of strides into the area he’d cleared he felt something catch on his foot. He was going too fast to stop, instead he sprawled into the dirt, feeling his foot rip away from the obstacle. He cried out in pain as tears formed in his eye. Catching his breath he pushed himself up off the ground and hobbled over the fire. He was scared to look at what had happened, his foot was in agony, fire rippling through his nerves and almost overpowering his exhausted body. He sat down by the flames and used the light to examine his foot. He sighed both in relief and apprehension. The nail on his right big toe had been completely ripped off, blood flowing through the now raw nail back and bed. He knew injuries like that not only bled and reopened constantly, but that his toe was now a prime target for infection. An infection that, in this environment, could easily become deadly. He clenched his jaw with the knowledge of what he was going to have to do. He was going to need to cauterise the wound.
Later Steve lay in Tony's bed, his lover lying against him with his hand on his chest, Steve's arm around his shoulder. Both exhausted and completely happy they lay holding each other.
Steve raised an eyebrow, “Are you asking me on a date, Stark?” He was shocked at himself for being so forward.
Tony gave him a playful punch on the arm and spoke through a mouthful of burger, “Seriously, stop being so modest, you make it feel like
Tony awoke bleary eyed and fuzzy headed. His moves were sluggish as he shrugged out of his old clothes and pulled on some pyjama pants and a bath robe. He tied it loosely around his waist before going on a quest for food, for anything to fill his protesting stomach. As he entered the kitchen he groaned, his stomach rumbling as he smelt the bacon frying on the stove. He didn't register who was cooking it as he rubbed at his eyes and sighed.
Bruce rubbed at his chin, “So, we need to find out what that machine was, and we need to run the data to find out where it could have sent him.”
“I'm sorry, but seeing nothing but your legs hanging out the top of your armour just wasn't something I was expecting to see,” came Steve's response to Tony's best snarky expression. “What are you even doing with it? Surely it's easier to take it apart and work on it?”
For a moment Fury wasn’t sure if he’d crossed the line. The rest of the Avengers glared at him with pure unadulterated fury, Clint holding Bruce’s forearm with white knuckles. Static electricity crackled in the air. Eventually Steve sighed and took a step back. The others followed him out of the office, but their expressions never changed.
“Thank you,” whispered Tony, “Thank you for letting me say it out loud, and thank you for not judging me for it.”
He looked back up and caught Tony’s eye, “How... How are you going to replace the one in your chest with this?”
Steve wasn’t sure how long they stood there but he felt the rest of the team join around them in their embrace. His tears tapered off .
“Well, there's always one of the apartments here if you want. I'm usually the only one around all the time since Pepper left, but it would at least give you somewhere to crash.”
Steve smiled, knowing Tony was ok once he started joking again. He ran Tony another glass of water and waited for him to drink it all. He knew he needed to head off the rest of Tony's Insight research before he got to it himself.
The next few weeks were surprisingly quiet for the Avengers. It appeared it was bad-guy vacation time, New York was left unscathed. As such the six team mates had plenty of time to wind each other up and generally get on with their own projects. Steve was making progress with the various pieces of StarkTech riddled through out the tower, with Tony's help of course. Tony was spending extra time in the lab, often barely making it up on time for movie night. He also seemed to be falling asleep a lot more often during the films, though Steve didn't mind carrying him to bed every week. A few times he'd even found Tony sleeping with his head resting on his arms on the workbench in his lab while bringing down food or pondering a question. Eventually it became habit to check before Steve went to bed, just to make sure. Most nights he ended up with a mostly sleeping Tony in his arms, listening to him murmur as he tucked him into bed. Sometimes he'd pluck up enough courage to brush the hair from his forehead and kiss the skin exposed there.
“I didn’t want to give up on you,” he choked, and suddenly found Tony in his arms, his face buried into his chest. Steve felt the dam break and wrapped his arms tightly around the thin little man as they both cried.
Natasha smiled and all hope was lost, “Yes.” The three team mates sauntered out of the room, leaving Tony tied to the chair.
Steve turned to lean against the bar, “Well, these people aren't your friends. I couldn't care less if you were Tony Stark or John Smith from the street.”
Tony and Bruce were taking one of their Science Bros™ head-clearing country trips in Tony's beloved Acura, enjoying not being stuck in the labs on one of the hottest days of the year. As they were discussing new theories to distribute vaccinations and health care to some of the areas Bruce had been working in, they saw something large being thrown out of the SUV in front of them.
Tony froze. Steve froze. He watched, seeing Tony’s shoulders start to heave as his breathing became harder and harder.
Steve closed his eyes as an ache throbbed through his head; he had forgotten just how awful hangovers really felt. He slowly shuffled to a free seat around the tablet, dropping down into it with no grace and roughly propping up his head with an arm resting on the table. He looked over at Thor who was watching him as he stuffed another slice of toast into his mouth.
Clint looked towards him, squeezing his hand painfully, his teeth clenched, “Yesterday, I think.” He groaned, “I don't think my pain button is working any more,” he forced out.
Tony, try as he might, just couldn't land a punch. Steve was just too fast, and Tony was not going to resort to his armour. Anyway, that would defeat the purpose. He was specifically trying to improve his ability to fight hand to hand, so he'd always be ready even if the suit wasn't close enough or combat ready. It would do little against something bigger than him, but it would help him if he ran into skrulls or, heaven forbid, more kidnappers.
Steve sighed again, “I can see what you've done, but I just can't get my head around it quite yet.” He looked at Tony, “I mean, you barely trust me with the microwave right now, lets not run before we can walk.”
Eventually, not meeting Steve's eyes, Bruce spoke. “He was the only person, the only one. The only one who never flinched. Not once.” His voice cracked. “Even you, even Captain America, you were wary. You distrusted me.”
Steve spent most of the next five days in the gym, trying to work out his nervous energy. He made sure to visit the barber to make sure his hair was freshly cut, and he washed his favourite outfit. His brown leather jacket was newly waxed and his shoes were just that little bit more shiny.
The rust had got worse, now the surface of the reactor flaked with sharp wafers of rusted metal punishing any absent minded tapping or checking. The skin around it had started to redden and itch, worse than normal. Tony wished he had something to put on it, to ease the heat and itch of the spreading rash. He bent over to adjust under the strap on his shoes. He’d quickly realised that in such a wet environment his feet would not last long in his sodden sneakers. Using his knife to rip through the material he’d separated the sole, worked some holes into the side and used string-like tough vines to create an open sandal. It allowed his feet to breathe yet also protected them from some of the nastier hidden things in the leaf litter. The safety goggles had been modified in a similar way, strapped around his chest to protect his red stained reactor. He used a makeshift spear as a walking pole, having found a long, sturdy stick and used the multi-tools knife to whittle the end into a point. It had taken him most of a long evening, but luckily he had managed to build a small fire that night so he had some light. He’d fire hardened the point, feeling a little safer and more optimistic with even such a crude longer range tool in his possession. His knife was a fantastic tool, but the spear he could hold out in front of him, keeping anything he needed to at longer than arm’s length.
Bruce smiled and adjusted Steve's collar, “Love is.” He smoothed down Steve's lapels. “But if it helps, Tony is probably just as scared as you are.”
quickly, letting off a battery of missiles which seemed to do nothing more than piss it off. Clint was nearby on a building, targeting as many eyes as he could with his arrows, while Natasha and Steve worked on dealing with the parasites it seemed to carry with it. Hulk was a flurry of movement and roars.
Steve leaned into his microphone, taking a deep breath to calm himself, “With all due respect ma’am, that has nothing to do with the situation today.”
The colour quickly drained from the doctor's face as he stammered, picked up the chart and barely stopped himself running out of his office.
“Thor, keep an eye on this. I’m going home to take a bath in aloe vera before any of those SHEILD medics get any ideas about coming near me.”
Steve waited, he didn't want to cut Tony off while he was pouring his heart out. He knew it could be cathartic to rant everything out, to get everything in the open. He knew this meant he had moved to a new level of trust. Tony had just bared his rawest wounds, had bared his soul to him. When it became evident he had finished he began to speak.
“Too late,” came the clipped response as the armour took off, Tony flying off to the tower. Steve felt his expression darken.
The car pulled up at the kerb and Tony held his breath as Steve stepped out onto the pavement. The two men smiled at each other as he approached.
The men stood in silence, Steve watching Tony fiddle idly with a circuit board. He suddenly turned to him.
Since then they sparred at least twice a week, and Tony was feeling much better emotionally. Steve had let him work out all of his frustrations, punching until he was screaming in rage at everything he'd keep inside for months and years. Now he felt like he was starting to improve in terms of technique, now he'd moved on from pure, blind aggression. He was still matched blow for blow by Steve, but now he could at least see what was happening and could block a good portion of Steve's attacks. Then a first, his fist actually connected with Steve's chest. He'd got past Steve's apparently not impenetrable flurry of blocks. In a moment of disbelief he hesitated and found himself on the floor, Steve on top of him holding him down.
Steve was helping Tony in his lab. And by helping, he was handing him the occasional tool as Tony worked on something intricate and confusing. His nose was buried in a modern history book as he continued to catch up on everything he'd missed when he'd been trapped in the ice. Tony called over to him to pass him some complicated sounding device, and Steve's mind went blank as he looked at everything laid in front of him. When he asked Tony to clarify he got a grunt, a wave and a “one of those thingies.” He sighed and looked up at the ceiling.
“Just as long as you didn't let me get through your defences,” Tony replied, with a suggestion of cheeky smile.
The music faded as he reached level with Steve, whom he turned to face. He took in a deep breath, running his eyes up and down his lover's body.
Tony put every ounce of his memories and pain into the punching bag as the sweat poured off of his forehead. He paused to pull his soaked shirt off and drop it on the floor before going back to working the bag. He let out a scream as he threw a punch with all of his energy. At that moment he heard something move behind him. He whirled around, arms up defensively.
Steve turned to look at Tony, smiling, “Thanks for helping me... again. This is what, the sixth time?”
Steve was worried about Tony. He was still out of sorts, but despite his offer, he just wouldn't talk to Steve about it. He wished he could make him feel better, but you can't get anything out of Tony Stark he doesn't want to give you. After that morning in the kitchen with the fridge incident all of the Avengers had begun to notice Tony seemed to be a little less aware of his surroundings than usual. He'd trip on the corner of a rug, or he'd walk into a door frame while doing something on his StarkPhone. He just didn't seem to be quite all there. Any attempt to talk to him about it was met with “I'm just tired”, “I'm working on something, that's all” or “I'm fine”. When Steve asked the other team members about it he just got shrugs back, or they all exchanged knowing looks and left him in the dark. Then came the day it just couldn't be ignored any longer.
“You’re always hungry,” replied Natasha as he got up and they started to walk towards the door. He laughed.
He turned to the mother again, patting his pockets, “I'm sorry, I don't appear to have a pen. Do you have one in your bag maybe?”
Tony huddled in with his back against the tree, nestled in as tightly as possible between the buttresses of the giant emergent. He absentmindedly scratched at skin around the arc reactor and started when he saw his damp fingers come away stained. He looked down at his chest and saw the red-brown blooms of rust which had started to take hold on the metal casing of the reactor. He cursed, he thought the reactor was pretty rust resistant, but with any alloy that contained iron rust was a risk. The coating must have got scratched in the days he had been walking through the forest, and in such a damp environment it was a perfect opportunity for rust to get in and grow. He had been so focused on finding some kind of waterway and keeping himself hydrated and somewhat fed, if some berries or fruit few and far between counted, that he hadn’t noticed it taking hold. He ran through a diagnostic in his mind as he checked the reactor.
!” Tony's voice cracked. “I've started looking in to Project Insight. I know that's what the helicarriers were named, but I haven't got further into that yet. What I can say is they kept it all pretty damn under wraps, JARVIS didn't find a even a loose thread to tug on when he got into SHEILDs systems.” He ran a hand over his tired face and sighed, “And, fucking hell Steve, you realise this means Hydra almost had their hands on Phase 2 weapons?”
“What is he doing?” he asked, not able to get a decent view of the action through the blinding fire and heat haze.
Steve put on a brave face and smiled brightly, “Hey Tony.” He walked over to stand by the bed, “How’re ya feeling?”
“No, just leave me alone! Nobody cares. I'm just a pathetic, spoilt asshole with no friends, who has no idea how to hold on to anyone he loves and fucks everything up. You should just leave before I end up pushing all of you away. I'm no good.”
Tony sat down and began to eat, staring down at the table, not quite sure how he'd managed to get Steve Rogers to say yes to a date to him. He couldn't screw this up. He heard Steve sit down opposite him and glanced up at him. They both smiled as they caught each other's eyes. They sat in silence for a moment before Tony piped up.
“I know what I’m doing, Steve,” he said, “I know you mean well, but just... just let me be me in my lab, k?”
Tony placed the helmet Steve was holding out on his head and swung his leg over the back of the motorbike. He wound his arms around Steve's waist and held tight as they took off down the road.
He felt himself meet solid resistance, confused for a moment. He looked down and found himself curled in one of the creatures huge tentacles. He struggled against it, routing all the power through his thrusters but he was stuck. His arms were pinned to his sides, he couldn't fire off his repulsors at the creature and he was out of missiles. He tried to shake himself loose, but it wasn't working. He saw one of Clint's arrows explode a few meters down the tentacle, but it didn't seem to do anything. He could hear the others through the comm, but he was focusing on the restriction he could feel across his chest, squeezing the breath out of him. He was aware he was moving towards the creatures mouth, he struggled with higher urgency. As the creatures teeth bit down he felt his armour crack and buckle, hearing the ripping of metal. He screamed, heard Steve screaming “TONY!” through the comm and blacked out.
He reached over to the multitool, mentally preparing himself for what was about to come. He took a deep breath, and quickly pressed the hot metal to the nail bed. He let out a long, ragged scream of pain as he held it there long enough to seal it, then turned the tool over to seal the rest of the nailbed. The whole ordeal lasted only seconds, but it felt like an age. He wretched dryly onto the ground beside him panted loudly as the pain throbbed through him, collecting his mental energy enough to inspect the newly sealed injury. He winced as he gently investigated with a finger, making sure that it wasn’t bleeding and there was no raw open skin left. He was relieved to find he’d got the whole area and that he didn’t need to submit himself to that pain again. He wasn’t sure if he even could. Leaning over he took the dried strips of pants leg off the spit and carefully bandaged his toe, making sure that it was tied on tightly so it wouldn’t get kicked off while he slept. Forcing himself to eat the entire cooked fish through his nausea he lay down to try and get some sleep.
It was Clint's movie of choice, and he went with Kate & Leopold. Rambling on about how it was so romantic that the man out of time meets this modern day woman and falls deeply in love with her and they manage to have such a deep and
They looked at each other for a moment, before Steve began to turn away again. Tony stepped forward involuntarily.
Sleeping together became a regular thing for Steve and Tony, Steve’s presence obviously comforted the troubled man. Tony’s sleeping had become much more regular and much less distressed.
Thor had spent much of the time since the incident cursing the fact he wasn’t able to contact Heimdall. Odin had spent so much energy getting Thor back down to earth after Loki’s capture that he couldn’t get home for months.
“I'm fine Steve, you'd think you've never made a mistake! Oh right, you're Captain America, I forgot,” he said, his customary snark coming through loud and clear, but definitely with an affectionate edge.
“Ahh,” Steve smiled, “That would explain your reaction. You know, until Br-someone pointed it out to me I didn't even think you saw me as more than a friend. I guess I thought Tony Stark wouldn't be interested in some old fashioned soldier like me.”
Thor seemed to be enjoying the epic more than most of the movies they watched together, loudly voicing his approval or unhappiness at certain parts of the film. Clint, although he'd seen the movies multiple times, always whooped when Legolas did something vaguely awesome and Natasha seemed to find Aragorn very appealing. Bruce was definitely on Sam's team. Steve mostly watched quietly, occasionally asking a whispered question to Tony if he wasn't quite sure on something. He was completely in awe of the world on screen. Tony himself watched uncharacteristically silent, only breaking to answer Steve's questions. He was too busy trying to ignore the electric feeling in his stomach every time Steve reached across him to get to the popcorn, or when their arms brushed slightly.
Tony sighed as his smile faded, “These people wouldn't care less about me if I wasn't Tony Stark. They only want me for my name.”
Steve didn't even try to catch Tony's attention, he just left the plate of dinner on the worktop near him like he had done the last couple of weeks. As he left the lab he looked back at Tony, totally absorbed in whatever his latest project was. He smiled.
“For God’s sake, couldn’t he have tried to be careful just once? At least if he’d been kidnapped we’d have a ransom note or something to go off of! This is all his own fault and we don’t have anywhere to start!” he kicked a chair across the room, and then felt a hand on his shoulder. He looked at Thor who had moved to stand beside him.
When Tony awoke it took him a few moments to gain his bearings and realise where he was. He started until he realised he was in the truck, the strong jungle sun beating through the window as he watched the trees blur past. His stomach rumbled as he stretched, before realising the driver was holding out a cereal bar for him. He managed a couple of bites before the sugary taste overwhelmed him and he had to put it down on the dashboard. Soon the trees gave way to fields, and Tony started to see farmers working out in them. Seeing people after so long on his own was difficult for him to adjust to, even though the farmers never even looked up at the truck as it trundled past. He felt himself drift in and out of sleep as they travelled.
Bruce gave him a look Steve had hoped never to have seen again, “How did you do it, Steve?” he whispered.
Steve grabbed the front of Tony's shirt and pulled him in for a long, deep kiss. When he let go Tony swayed a little and blinked stupidly.
Another few moments of eye contact passed before they turned away from each other and began walking to their own rooms, their eyes meeting as they both turned back to look at the other, blushes rising to their cheeks.
Tony grinned, “That's the spirit!” He chucked the keys to Clint who caught them in mid-air and disappeared almost immediately.
“Quinjet. Now. And alert SHIELD medical we are going to need them in the next couple of hours and they better be ready.”
He’d spent hours upon hours, days and days in there since. Fine tuning things, tinkering with half-finished discarded ideas, throwing himself into being as busy as possible. He wasn’t the same. The once brazenly confident, forever muttering and gesturing man had become quiet. Where before he couldn’t seem to stand the sound of quiet, filling up any void with the sound of his own voice and music, now the silences stretched around him. Once the instigator of conversations, now he had to be prompted into them. Where he used to relentlessly tease and postulate with Bruce, now he was content for them to work in companionable silence, speaking when necessary or to share the odd joke here or there. Now he could watch movies with the Avengers on movie night without providing his very own Stark flavoured riff track.
The two men stood there awkwardly, looking at each other. Close enough to feel each others breath. Tony broke first.
By the time they reached the park the other Avengers had already divided themselves up into teams (Clint and Natasha vs Bruce and Thor) and had mostly built their snow forts. As Tony ran in screaming “EVERYONE FOR THEMSELVES!” Steve got out his camera. He got some fantastic shots of everyone in various states of throwing or getting hit, everyone laughing, and a few of Natasha convincing Thor that Mjolnir was not an acceptable substitute for a snowball. His favourites, though, were of Tony. Tony no holds barred, a huge grin across his face as he threw a snowball or got hit. Tony wrapped up in all those layers yet still getting a handful of snow down the back from Clint, or poking his head out over a bank of snow scouting out his next target.
Steve's heart began to beat faster in his chest, “JARVIS, it's Steve. I need to see Tony, let me in please?”
“Me neither,” came Steve’s small voice as he buried his head against the smaller man’s shoulder. Clint wrapped his arms around him and tried to hold back his own tears as Steve sobbed against him.
Tony looked up at Steve, “You know they wouldn't even let me join the Avengers at first? They said I was too unstable. It fucking hurt to hear that, but you know what? They were right. I'm a mess. A big fucking mess.”
Steve felt the tension drop out of his shoulders knowing that Tony was fine. The steam started to clear, revealing the melted and rehardened, glassy look of the buildings and roads. Panes had melted out of windows, cooling in puddles on the ground. Asphalt was warped and shiny. It looked like a Dali painting within a block of the small, steaming figure in the middle of the devastation. He saw a red and silver streak land beside the red and gold armour of Tony, hearing the exchange through comms.
Steve smiled and looked at Tony, seeing the not-so-well-hidden hope in his eyes. “I guess we could work something out.” Maybe he didn't have to start over alone this time.
The boy looked at him and smiled as Bruce reached him. He held out his hand to the child, who shook it with a somewhat awe-full look on his face.
. Don’t make me feel even more useless than I already do,” Tony spat back as Steve paled at the memory of Natasha falling, screaming Tony’s name.
“Yeah. Well, it turns out he's not a ghost story.” He took a deep breath, “It also turns out he's Bucky.”
“Of course I'd never judge you. You're my Tony. Now,” Steve took his hand, “you have a tower full of friends who haven't seen you in days. We should at least say good night.”
Tony nodded, grateful that Steve didn't feel the need to hide him away, nor to force the others upon him after such an emotional event.
Complex engineering diagrams and notes popped up on the screen, JARVIS ran a number through across the next few minutes, and showed them from a 360 degree angle.
“But I know better now. Thanks.” Bruce smiled and headed down to check out his brand new refurbished, personal, re-enforced lab.
Tony awoke with a start as he felt a hand shaking his shoulder. The driver smiled at him and jumped out of the cab, walking around the front and motioning for him to get out. He undid his seatbelt and pushed open the door, climbing down on the ground. He looked around, figuring out that they had stopped at a gas station. He winced as he began to walk, suddenly aware again of the pain in his feet. Running his hand over his face he froze. He stared from between his fingers in a stupor, taking in the fact that there was a phone on the wall of the gas station. A pay phone. He stumbled towards it, his mind searching for the number for the tower. He let a frustrated howl escape his lips as he lifted the handset and realised he had no money to activate the phone. He felt tears start to come to his eyes before he heard a noise behind him and turned to find the truck driver holding out some coins. Tony looked at him, waiting for him to close his hand. When the driver nodded at his hand he greedily grabbed the coins and fed them into the phone. He prayed as the phone rang, hoping beyond hope that someone would pick up. After what seemed like an eternity the ringing cut off.
.” Tony was surrounded by a roaring sound painfully loud. Suddenly the noise stopped and he felt his ears pop. He blinked, stunned.
He willed himself on, stopping to drink some water from a cupped leaf. He closed his eyes and scratched at one of his sore spots. Suddenly he froze as he heard an unfamiliar but tantalising sound. The rumble of an engine and the clanking of metal. He shook his head to make sure he wasn't hallucinating, and for a few seconds longer he heard that distant, hopeful noise.
Bruce gave a subtle smile, Steve seemed to be talking to himself more than him now, which is exactly what he needed to be happening. The others had trusted him with this task, he wasn't going to let them down while they were handling Tony.
“What matters,” Steve grunted as a bolt of searing flame hit his shield, “Is how we fight the damn thing.”
Tony stood nervously outside the restaurant, in his favourite black shirt to block out the light from his arc reactor and a pair of perfectly fitting jeans. His light beige jacket felt stifling as he waited for his date to arrive.
Steve started to go a little pink, “Well, they are essentially people. They deserve the same manners.”
. I didn't get to give you my reply, and of course I've forgotten everything I was going to say now,” he laughed stupidly.
“I’m alive.” He sighed, “It’s good to hear your voice. Can you put me through to the tower line please?”
Steve could recognise a lie from Tony easily, and Tony knew it. Steve moved towards him, a curious look in his eye. “Nothing? Really?” He picked up a tool and inspected it innocently, “I mean, surely you wouldn't fly in that thing if it had any real weaknesses, but I guess you just mustn't be as good at catching them any more.” He glanced at Tony and saw a tenseness in his shoulders. He knew he'd won. “I mean, I could take a look and check for yo-”
back,” came Tony's reply, as his mind focused on what the hell he was going to do when he ran into Steve.
When they arrived back at the tower the rest of the team were there to meet them, as well as Fury and Coulson. Tony was attacked by hugs, wincing as he felt his still healing wounds protest. He noticed Steve stay slightly back, shifting awkwardly, only joining in when Tony shot him a you-get-here-right-now look. They dragged him up to the sitting room where they'd laid out all his favourite snacks and a dozen different flavours of pop since he couldn't drink for another few weeks. Steve sat on another couch, and the two awkwardly made eye contact a few times, Steve always readjusting himself uncomfortably. Tony felt like he could burst, but he just didn't know how to fix this with all of the others giving them no chance to talk.
Bruce spoke again, “Tony Stark, absolute genius, nightmare to understand. I have no idea what is going on with that thing. I don’t think I’ll be able to work it out, either.”
It had been a long time since Tony went for a simple hike through the woods, and allowing himself time to take it all in without technology getting in the way was more relaxing than he imagined it could be. Steve loved to point out any interesting wildlife or plants, and his overwhelming enthusiasm was impossible to resist. After around one and a half hours they wandered into a small grassy glade by a stream and Steve took off his backpack. He rummaged for a moment before getting out a blanket and laying it down. He sat down as Tony followed suit and told him to check his backpack. Soon there were sandwiches and yoghurt and fruit in tubs sitting on the blanket as the two men tucked into the picnic.
Steve pulled his shirt down and stepped back, cheeks flushed. He looked at Tony, “Oh God, I- I’m sorry,” he said breathlessly, “I don’t know what came over me.”
Tony was chest deep inside his armour as Steve walked into the lab. He heard Steve openly laugh before pulling himself out of the torso.
“It appears it was not accidental, Sir. The crash was organised by HYDRA in order to remove them from SHIELD.”
He rubbed a hand roughly against his forehead, pacing angrily, “I told him to be careful!” His breathing was coming in loud angry bursts, “He didn’t even know what it did!” He braced himself against the wall, “I should have told him not to test the damn thing! I shouldn’t have let him! It’s my fault, Clint!” Steve suddenly stopped, looking at the fist sized hole in the wall he’d just created.
Steve worked away at the punching bag, trying to vent the strange feeling he had in the pit of his stomach. Tony had been great tolerating his complete ineptitude with anything technological, but Steve felt like he must just be annoying the genius himself. Tony had told him multiple times he didn't mind helping him figure things out, and once or twice had mentioned the word adorable, but Steve knew Tony was a professional faker. He punched harder at the bag. Hell, Tony had been almost silent the whole way through the latest movie night, only giving him the barest answers when Steve asked him a question, whereas he'd usually be laughing and joking the whole way through and making fun of Steve if he couldn't keep up. Then Tony had fallen asleep on his shoulder, and he'd been too scared to move. Too scared he'd wake Tony up and he'd lose the contact. Of course Tony didn't feel for him, and he'd never tell him, but he relished being able to have that closeness. Steve had woken up sometime after the movie finished to find the rest of the Avengers gone and himself and Tony draped in a blanket. He'd gently picked up Tony and put him in his own bed, before retreating to the kitchen to get something to eat and try to keep his mind off of the squeeze in his chest.
Tony enjoyed seeing the blush spread across Steve’s face, his ears turning red. His heartbeat picked up again.
“What, you think I’m going to let you have all the fun?” came the reply, and Steve could hear the smirk.
Steve pressed his hand against Tony's forehead, “Gees, you're freezing! Let's get you up to your room and warmed up.”
Tony was working hard in his lab, late at night. The heat had become unbearable, temperatures hitting 100 degrees everyday for a week. Not even the tech in his tower could keep up with keeping his lab, full of tools which melted and sparked, a temperature he could stand. His shirt lay in a crumpled heap on his stool, discarded hours ago as it soaked through with his sweat. He was thoroughly engrossed in his work, leaning over the work bench and focused intently on the intricate circuitry he was modifying, his face lit by the blue glow of his arc reactor. He didn't hear as Steve walked into the lab, carrying a plate of food. He did, however, hear Steve's sharp in take of breath.
“Thanks for saving me Cap,” he said, all suave and cool on the outside, turmoil on the inside, “But I gotta go re-programme JARVIS' loyalty core.”
As they left the building the rest of the team were discussing going out for ice cream if they could find anywhere in the city with any still left solid. Steve and Tony made their excuses – Tony needed to get back to the tower and cover himself in burn cream and of course Steve was being his regular overprotective self and insisting on following to make sure he was ok. Natasha raised an eyebrow but didn’t say anything, Clint insisted it was their loss.
