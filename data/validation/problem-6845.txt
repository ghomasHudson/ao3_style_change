“You or your husband probably did not notice but Oscorp is hanging on by a tiny thread! We’ve had to abandon dozens of labs! And a few years ago, SHIELD informed me of the Hydra infestation in several of them…I had no part causing Peter’s pain. I swear it.”
Probably because he was holding onto his father’s skin cream, the first thing he dreamed of was the broad stretch of his father’s back as he concentrated more on his work than Tony. His father’s taunt back loomed in front of him like a fearsome, impassable wall. Tony reached out to touch him but the man struck him away and hissed, “Not now, Tony! Later! We’ll have all the time we need in the future!”
The anger melted away and concern flickered across Tony’s expression. He crossed the room, rounding the couch, and sat next to Steve. He grasped Steve’s hand and vehemently stated, “We are together and love each other.
“She gave birth to a boy. He is two now and his name is Peter…I just recently found out about him and have been raising him ever since. I know you are not related to him by blood but you two are related by marriage and the closest thing he has to family other than myself. If you want…I want you two to be a part of his life.”
Steve didn’t break away from his hand like he expected him to do. In fact, he carded his fingers through Tony’s and replied, “It possibly can’t be that simple.”
“Hey,” Peter said lightly. His chest was still tight with anxiety from his confrontation with his dad and the words they exchanged. Thinking of those words, he paused and then asked, “Wade, can you promise me, from now on, you’ll never kill someone?”
Natasha’s challenge broke Peter out of his embarrassment and he retorted, “You’re on, the loser buys the team pizza.”
Tony put his hands on his head as Steve leaned in and began to wrap the bandages around his body. Every time he wound the bandages around Tony’s back they came into an indirect hug. This close to the man, Tony was able to distinguish his personal scent of soft soap and tough leather. He noted that this close Steve just looked younger. His face was clearer, his eyes bluer, and his hair less perfect. It just made him more human and less the fictional superhero Tony had grown up with.
Despite his worry, Peter was totally fine. He went straight to the community room to find Ben and Peter sitting on the ground playing with Peter’s action figures.
“I concur,” Jarvis agreed. “I suggest putting the suit to sleep until you need it to return to the future.”
“Worse than having a son who you ignored for the last 19 years?” Tony stated with a laugh. Upon Bruce’s shocked expression, Tony said, “Did I mention he spent 14 of those 19 years an orphan?” Bruce opened and closed his mouth like a fish out of water. Tony continued, “Yeah, it’s worse than seeing Steve and I fuck.”
Peter was still clutching his phone in his hand when his Aunt May placed the platter of pancakes in front of him.
The medical examiner sighed heavily and stated, “It’s not unusual for the ejaculate to be found there when the skirt is hiked up to the waist. I’m assuming Rogers did not wait for her to become fully undressed before he raped her.”
“Tony Stark…We’re married now,” Steve murmured, rubbing his hips into Tony’s. Tony groaned and cupped both his ass cheeks and pulled Steve in tighter.
Tony crossed the ceiling as quickly as the boots would allow. Switching from the ceiling to the wall was a little difficult but the end result was rewarding.
Steve clutched at the door handle, wanting to rip it open and run after Tony. Instead, he replied, “N-No, no, I am far from alright.”
“You’re on!” Harry retorted. He handed his controller to Tony and both boys ran over to the television and turned on the game console. Tony rolled his eyes and switched off the Thor toy by pressing a button on the controller. The toy powered down and slowly floated back down to the ground. Tony bent down and picked up the Thor toy. Steve also bent down and picked up the remains of the Iron Man.
He could not believe he was thinking such impure thoughts about his friend. If Tony knew he would probably be disgusted.
Peter slowly opened his eyes, his eyelashes brushing against Wade’s skin as he did. As he looked and listened to Wade he felt his heart swell. There was absolutely no doubt at that point…Peter was
Before Peter, Wade never really lived. Sure, he went through the motions of life and put on a good show but, he hadn’t really felt alive or happy until Peter had smiled at him and flirted back.
“But, you’re right,” Tony interrupted him, clenching his fists. “I won’t try to start something between us. What’s dead is dead. There’s no changing that. I will move on.”
She raised her hands and the familiar magenta mist of her magic appeared around her fingers. His skin tingled and his clothes vibrated against his skin as they lost their ruffles. His neck felt particularly weird as the hickies were removed and Tony did a little dance as a cold shiver went down his spine.
“Tony…He – He just wanted to be a part of the Commandos!” Steve laughed but it was broken and he had to pause to catch his breath before he completely broke down in front of the Command tent of all places. He whispered, “He was like a gift from God, Peggy. I wanted to love him while I had him. It was so innocent…I never imagined it to becoming this: loving him so deeply, the future changing because of it, and Tony…Tony dying…” He rubbed harder at his eyes and gasped, “Oh, my God, he’s actually dying.”
“I beginning to see why Bucky calls you a punk so much,” Tony yawned and pushed himself out of the bed. Steve didn't move as Tony dragged his feet over to him. He felt exposed but also turned on by the way Tony's eyes slid over his body.
Solo’s face became deathly pale and Steve followed his gaze to see him staring at the spot on his arm where Solo had scratched him.
Steve ran over to Coulson and gasped, “My timer is about to run out! Do you have everything handled here?”
He recognized Tony’s light steps as he approached him. He paused by Steve’s side and wrapped an arm around his waist. They leaned into each other and Steve whispered what was on his mind, “How do we take down those three helicarriers before they kill us or any innocents?”
Before the Avengers, he never worried about hiding it from anyone. No one questioned why he drank so much on this particular date. They all assumed it was a part of his usual bad, drinking habits and no one, not even Pepper, noticed one of his bad nights always occurred annually.
At every opportunity, Tony still avidly wished to be with Steve, intimately, with focus and excitement and passion. A few hours ago, Tony attentively brought Steve to the brink over and over, so many times he lost count, edging him so assiduously that his body felt untethered by mass, then meticulously extracted a series of no less than nine overwhelming orgasms, so powerful he felt every empty space in his body fill with light and warmth and bliss.
“I was able to create an inlay for a piece of my reactor. I told you I was putting my heart into this for you.” Tony was smiling smugly now, obviously pleased with himself. “It’s actually part of an identical pair…” He reached into his pocket to reveal a second, slightly smaller but matching ring.
his mind echoed. It tore at him, slowly, piece by piece. Here Tony stood, having traveled half-way across the globe, lying and deceiving every person he knew and every person who knew him, just to be
“I have to confess,” Tony says, his voice a little shaky, “that I mostly picked those songs to annoy you. Modern pop isn’t really my taste.” Steve’s eyes are welling with tears, and he’s a bit unnerved when his own eyes become clouded as well.
Concerned he had made a mistake and worried about what a slumber party with Tony would entail, Steve went out for a walk, picked up a small gift, and promptly retreated to his apartment.
I’m told he left a letter to me. There’s a delay in retrieving it, some miscommunication with Jarvis, perhaps. I never told you this, but I was waiting for him to change his mind about something. Now, I guess he never will.
Whoever it is that’s stolen him like a small sack of potatoes is impossibly strong, because they’re maintaining a swift pace and don’t seem at all inconvenienced by his pathetic protest.
The air was thick. In his mind, Tony’s apprehension was competing with Steve’s confusion. It was getting loud, overwhelming in his head. The only way out was to take a leap of faith, and Tony was willing to jump.
“Tony’s gonna have to destroy the rings. That’s the only hope of restoring the shield and the reactor.”
“You’re amazing,” he said as he slowly pulled out, returning his lips to kiss at Tony’s neck. “Insatiable, incredible, strong.” He rattled off every word of praise he could think was worthy of Tony as he held him tight, relaxing into a blissful afterglow.
Steve moved slowly, pulling out almost completely, only to push back in all the way to slot their hips flush again. He steadily increased his pace, watching Tony thoughtfully, attuned to every cue that he might want more or less or something entirely different.
Steve’s eyes grew wide and Tony felt an easy sense of awe take the edge off of the collective tension in the room. He felt drawn to Steve, maybe even safe, and he finally allowed himself to sit next to him.
Steve was unconcerned with unfamiliar sounds growing more clear, as if something hostile was advancing on them from a far away distance.
.” He couldn’t help himself. Anything that came to mind poured from his soul before he knew what he was saying. “Oh, Tony, you take it so well. You’re too good to me.” He buried his face into Tony’s neck. Tony was tensing up, grinding hard against his movements, resisting as best as he could. Steve felt him unraveling fast, and if he was going to say all that he wanted Tony to hear, he would have to be quick.
“Precisely. The world will be so envious of you and me, and we will have the one thing most coveted by all the world.”
His balance is compromised by his hands bound together while walking over slippery rocks and rolling sticks through a steep, dense forest. He takes in the scenery, wondering if he can solve where they are, and equally wondering if it would matter if he could.
“Shit, Steve…” Tony was coming undone, fast, and if he was going to make good on his promise, he would have to act fast. Without warning, Steve grabbed at the hem of Tony’s sweatshirt, pulling it up and over his head quickly, then shoving it between Tony’s bare skin and the cold concrete. The man didn’t resist, he allowed it to happen to him, running his hands along Steve’s bulky gear in approval. With expert movement, Steve stripped away Tony’s jeans and boxers and shoes in one swift movement. It wasn’t as if he hadn’t done this hundreds of times before - at this point, it would be more difficult to pretend he wasn’t adept at stripping Tony Stark completely naked in a matter of seconds.
As Tony’s tears began to ebb, Steve realized he’d forgotten to really breathe. He indulged in a slow inhale, and then continued an intentional motion of deep breaths, his chest rising and dropping with Tony’s head along for the ride.
Why do the good ones suffer? Why are they brought here, greatness thrust upon them, then to endure torture and cruelty and a lifetime of sorrow, only to be so untimely plucked from the earth?
“It’s a false memory, Steve. That’s all it is. A manipulation. The doing of aliens. It’s not organic. And it’s not real.”
Not that his deceased lover, former knight of the SHIELD, could have saved him from this. It sits heavy in his heart that the man he loved with all that he could give is gone, and the grief gnaws at him fiercely that he never had the chance to bid farewell. Lately, this feeling has evolved into emotions that make his heart stop. Accepting his own mortality and understanding he will never see Steve before his own demise makes the end seem all the more terrifying. His lover died alone, and soon, so will he.
Tony pulls back quickly to look at the wound properly, but there’s blood and he can’t see. He takes off his outer robe and begins to dab at the wound. Steve hisses, and recoils a bit, but it’s only to reach into his bag and retrieve a jar of water. He offers it to Tony, who accepts it, and after pouring a bit on his jacket, he allows the remainder of the water to run down Steve’s face.
Steve knew he would need to fill Tony’s mind with light, and chase away any lingering shadows cast from the mountains of trauma born of the work they did. Tony would need it constantly to help heal his mind of all they witness, day in and day out. He knew he would always be able to find the words Tony needed to hear to render his mind whole again. He would say them over and over until Tony believed it as if the words were born in his own mind. Forever. He would do this forever.
“Head wounds won’t heal even for you if you restrict your body in this way. Nomad, let go of it!” His persistence is growing more urgent as he continues to witness the loss of blood.
Steve knew Bruce’s statement was said with his deepest intention to be kind, but the reality of what they were risking settled in his body like lead, heavy and metallic, foreign and unwanted. He didn’t have time to process it before Tony asserted impatiently, “If we’re doing this, let’s do it. Now.”
The Avengers as a team were almost no more. The fight they endured was almost too much, it almost broke them, until Steve realized Tony had never prepared to fight
His eyes focus on the countless legions of Chitauri ships, swooping in organized movement like ants in a three-dimensional plane, then, he sees the mothership, and suddenly he can’t breathe-
“Did you need something?” Tony hadn’t considered this, that Steve might not set him right, might make it worse, and now he again feels the breath leave his lungs.
“A pirate bar.” Steve said it as if it were obvious, which Tony supposed it was. “Otto’s, I believe. You don’t know it?”
Eventually they settled in the bed, exchanged lingering kisses, and snuggled together in the warm blankets. Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and pulled him close to his heart.
“Every time I kissed you, you didn’t know what we were doing? Every time I held you while you had a nightmare, you didn’t know what we were doing? Every time you fucked me, every time you came inside me, while I moaned your name...that wasn’t some indication to you?” Heat had returned to Tony’s face, wetness glistening on his cheeks. “Then, the world ends, and I give up all my suits for you, to save you and protect you, and I sit here, day after day, waiting for you, and you don’t think to figure out what the hell we’re doing?”
What the hell was on East 14th? He knew he should have arranged Steve’s ride for the night, but Steve had insisted on doing it himself as a way to reorient himself with the city.
It was soft and sweet, tender and kind. Why couldn’t he return, find his way back, be with him in that place again? Where was it buried? Where did he find it, the shared fragile intimacy they enjoyed? He knew it was there, it existed somewhere, it couldn’t have been buried, stifled, smothered. It couldn’t have been an illusion. Why couldn’t he just find it again?
The workshop was dimly lit as Tony carefully inspected the metal under an illuminated magnifying glass.
Steve placed him down gingerly, and settled his imposing frame against Tony’s. Feeling Tony’s slight body underneath him spurred his desire, but he veiled it with scrupulous movements, deliberate touches, and languid grinding of hips. They carefully began to remove superficial fabrics that concealed their skin. With each layer exposed, Tony’s zeal became more and more obvious, and Steve knew his own eagerness was entirely reciprocated.
Suspense starts to gnaw its way through his stomach and the acid keeps burning at his throat. Finally, he breaks his silent protest in an attempt to ease his anxiety.
“You’ve talked to Rhodey about this?” It was still a surprise to Steve how easily people talked about it now. In his time, it was considered a mark of poor moral character to talk about such topics.
I’m starting to think there never was a letter. And, I’m starting to beg for any message from beyond the veil, or otherwise. Anything from Tony.
?” He was building trust, but Steve was still sharp enough to know Tony wasn’t being entirely forthcoming. If he wanted to keep building upon the little they had, he knew he would have to be more honest about himself.
“Does it make the work you do harder to deal with?” Tony was struck with tenderness again. Steve really seemed invested in Tony’s pain. Which, actually, was Steve’s pain. So maybe it made sense. Or, no, it really didn’t. But either way, Tony was finding himself glad he’d confided in Steve.
“I feel drawn to you, Steve, in a way I can’t explain. Tell me you haven’t thought about it before.”
I know it’s only been a collection of days, not quite strung into weeks yet, since Tony’s death. But all I’ve had time to do is to sit and think. I sit in this cell, and stare at the ceiling, but I don’t even see the concrete anymore. I just think about Tony, and what I could have done.
Frustrated and a little discouraged by this knowledge, Steve wondered what good it would do to broach the subject with Tony Stark. Until they finally met, and spent some time together, and Tony casually mentioned the perplexing subject.
He sees Iron Man take off into the distance. Steve is still fighting off the onslaught, slow on the uptake, when he realizes what’s happening.
“Everyone has a story of a really specific thing you have to do with your soulmate to awaken the bond.”
Steve tightly grasped Tony’s hand, punctuated by a clang of metal hitting metal as their identical rings met. Something tried to distract his mind, questioning if he was trying hard enough. It was a thought easy to stifle as Tony began to nip at his neck.
Bruce carefully whispered, “I dosed myself with gamma-radiation when I was 29. I had no control of the Hulk back then and killed a lot of people.” Peter’s face pinched tightly with sorrow and he looked like he was going to cry so Bruce leaned in closer and quickly rushed, “Peter – Peter, I know what you’re going through right now…I know you blame yourself. I know you are disgusted with yourself. I know…I know you feel as if you’d rather have died in their place…”
Whatever they gave him was making him feel sick. Nonetheless, he spun the car tightly around a curve and sped down the highway. No one was tailing them yet, but he knew they’d be on him any minute. He needed to get as much distance as he could between them if they had any chance of escape.
“An initiative made to protect the Earth in the greatest hour of its need using a collaboration of its mightiest heroes…We-we want you to lead them,” Coulson stated.
The lawyers left not long after, only staying to exchange a few more words and then left them alone. As soon as the doors sealed them inside, Tony reluctantly pulled away from Steve.
Cable rolled his eyes and grumbled, “There are probably paradoxes out there where the time traveling never occurs or Stark never goes to the past and those realities are filled with much less stupidity and drama.”
Tears instantly sprung to his eyes and he buried his face into Pops’ chest as he hugged him tightly. Peter wailed, “
“I’ve just grown used to him being around,” Tony explained. And he’d grown used to having another in his usually lonely life, to waking up in Steve’s arms, seeing his warm smile whenever he looked at him, having him only a room away, and…just having his presence in their home. The tower felt too empty without Steve. He felt empty without Steve…
“What??” Mary hissed. Her face twisted into something ugly and it immediately had Steve on the defensive. He automatically moved into a fighting stance but as soon as he realized what he had done, he made himself relax.
Tony calmed down and smiled at Steve. He teased, “This is a national travesty! Who will kiss our babies now?!”
Steve returned the kiss with an appreciative hum and whispered, “Good morning, honey… It’s really morning already?”
,” Eddie hissed as the mass began to change from black to brown to black again. Gripping the counter with his fingers turning white, Eddie gasped, “The molecules aren’t going to be able to handle it! They’re too unstable!”
He chalked it up to his dry manner. He should not have been so cold to Tony for no reason. That had to be it…Steve could not have feelings for his friend.
Steve groaned and his already red face grew a shade darker. He moaned, “I thought I was the only one alive with the knowledge…”
“So you were in the Army?” Tony asked, stupidly looking for more similarities to further prove Steve was compatible with Sam. His jealousy still burned in his gullet but his heart was growing cold. How could he have been so stupid? Pepper was right. Steve found someone else.
Coulson and Bruce stepped back into the hallway but Tony remained where he was standing. Thor looked to him and Tony nodded him on and said, “Go for it, big guy.”
?? You’re throwing a party in my backyard. You were not welcome as soon as you came in with a man with one of the bloodiest kill counts in history!”
Steve felt ill. He shouldn’t be thinking like this. It couldn’t be true. Tony was so excited that Steve wanted to date him. And Steve knew him well enough that he knew Tony wouldn’t fake what they shared…
Steve was the first to move and cautiously stepped forward while keeping a hand on Tony’s arm. Tony was glad for the anchor as Steve was probably the only thing keeping him upright as Tony looked upon their future.
Bucky smiled sadly at him and said, "Tomorrow. I had to wait to tell you till now so you wouldn't have a chance to stop me."
She stared to pace and hissed, “When he shot me, years later, without a flicker of recognition I knew they wiped his mind and I knew there was nothing I could do. His body was there but the man I got to know, the man I loved, was still dead. But it still pissed me off enough to join SHIELD…though I never told them my connection to him or that I used to be the Winter Soldier’s companion, the Shadow Soldier.”
“Here they come!” Peter yelled and then leapt forward. Their final five combatants were charging toward them out of the parting smoke. Steve zeroed in on the man with a body of sand and followed his son out into the field.
“We could tell them,” Tony said a little louder so the others would hear. His lawyers leaned in closer with obvious interest.
Bucky wrote out the letter by hand and snuck onto Natasha’s floor when she was out, leaving the message on her bed.
Peter stepped out of the bathroom in a clean pair of boxer briefs and was rubbing at his head with his towel. Wade leaned back into the bed and wolf whistled as soon as he came into the room. Peter smirked and strolled over to Wade as he asked, “Do you think this will become a thing? Like once a year a super villain has to kidnap Peter Parker or they’ll be kicked out of villain club?”
The Soldier shook his head but did not discourage her efforts. Who knew, maybe she’d actually get it one day…
He followed Bruce silently across the hall and into his lab. As soon as the doors sealed behind them Steve asked, “What is it?”
He pulled Steve and they dove through the crowd. It took the reporters a few seconds to recover then followed them, grasping for Steve.
“What if Osborn wasn’t pulling our leg?” Tony whispered in Steve’s shoulder, drawing him out of his relaxed state.
Harold came back after five or so minutes, holding a paper bag. He announced, “We’ve got it all. Anything else for you, sir?”
“You knew he was going to die,” Steve gasped, his voice rough with emotion. It wasn't a question. He knew the answer but he had to hear Tony say it and then tell him why. He
When Tony woke the next morning, he lay awake for a long time, not wanting to pull away from Steve’s side. Eventually, he pushed himself up on his elbow and shook Steve’s shoulder. He hissed, “Wake up, Steve! Wake up or I’ll drink all the coffee and leave none for you!”
Steve laughed with unadulterated mirth and wrapped his arms around Tony. Bits of mattress stuck to his fingers and floated around them. Tony eyed the bits of his mattress with an amused grin. He plucked one mothball off Steve and blew on it lightly, sending it flying from his hand.
Thor did not question his orders and flew in. He slammed down his hammer between them, making the Goblin jump back from Steve. Tony swooped in, grabbed Steve, and they went blasting in the direction of Oscorp Tower.
His fingers felt nothing as they brushed away the snow and icicles. They are like five, solid chunks of flesh and Steve darkly wondered if he had acute frostbite. Would the serum save his hands?
Steve and Peter were morning people and sitting next to each other so they were happily chatting away about what they planned to do for the day (sneaking out to the zoo). Gone were the days of hiding behind glasses and baseball caps, Tony had made them facial holograms, better than the ones SHIELD had so they could go out without fearing being recognized.
The sight alone made Tony feel like his own predicament was little in comparison to the glistening in Steve’s eyes.
It was no question for Steve to agree to move into Tony’s apartments. It was much larger than his old apartment and included three floors and a large private balcony. Peter had taken to the transition with ease and loved being closer to Tony. The most difficult part for Steve was merging their closets. Tony’s closet was as big as Peter’s bedroom but it was filled with enough suits to clothe an entire army.
And yet, Steve had a gaping void within his body, he knew something had been ripped from his soul, and his memory was of waning reliability.
“This isn’t how it’s supposed to be!” Strange barked to no one identifiable. “These attacks are decades away! This is all wrong!”
Katy Perry kindly reminds him through her song of his own regret, how he wonders why he thought it was a good idea to fly into the darkness, into a wormhole, into another world.
How could there be pain from something so fleeting he couldn’t even properly remember? He was aching over the loss of something that was never meant to be his.
A gentle movement swayed his body, and he felt a pressure wrap around his waist. Tony was holding him, sitting beside him. Tony tentatively wrapped around Steve, until he began to lose sensation in his legs from the uncomfortable kneel. His body slumped to the ground finally, and he wrapped an arm securely around Tony to guide him to rest upon his chest. They remained unmoving, except for the gentle rhythm of Tony’s body rocking with soft sobs.
Tony seemed to falter a moment, before dropping his chin and shaking his head. “Sounds like we’re having a good ol’ fashioned slumber party!”
take?” He held his left hand up to Tony’s gaze, and then rested it heavily upon his heart. “You made this for me, for us. It’s a combination of the two of us. And after we take the toxin, if we have trouble remembering anything, we’ll have
“Tony, hey, it’s me, Steve, I’m here, you’re safe-” he tried again to settle Tony, allowing his affirmations to grow louder and louder in hopes that he would be heard. Tony’s arms wrapped around Steve’s torso, and suddenly he was being pulled into bed.
“Yes! I mean, no. I would not mind seeing this look again. And what a look it is!” Tony gave Steve an exaggerated once-over from head to toe, eliciting a laugh first from Steve, then from Tony.
And, for what? To talk? About what? They’d tried on the phone, on and off for months, and there was nothing productive to talk about. Was it to represent some unenforceable doctrine? That couldn’t be, as Tony shirked his pseudo-ambassadorship responsibilities months ago. Was he here to create a new agreement? Arrest him? Steal his DNA? No, no,
“That would be a solid incentive for the Chitauri to coerce their minds. Compromising Captain Rogers’ shield and inflicting a flaw to Stark’s heart is a subtle strategy, be it that one well-planned attack should secure their demise.”
A scream started forming in the back of his throat, he couldn’t release it, he didn’t want to, he fought it with every shaky fiber of his being, pain mounting and building and consuming him and -
“It depends on how you see it.” Nomad tilts his head to the side and gives a wry smile, if you can even call it that.
Steve savors every second watching Iron Man shoot into the sky, fearing the seconds are limited, knowing they are disappearing too quickly. He has to think of something, anything, to prevent this-
Hushed voices paused him as he was dressing for bed. Small rituals were the only things that held some semblance of logic in this upside down, nearly unrecognizable world. It took a moment to register the familiar tones, and a moment longer to comprehend why they were coming from just outside his door. Steve couldn’t help but freeze - without any will of his own to stop it, he allowed himself to overhear the conversation.
Once Steve had cleared the bed, Tony collapsed back into the sheets. They would leave this place, like they always did, as the precedent set by the past six weeks dictated. Steve would be gone before full morning light, and pursue the newest lead in his vigilante plight to stomp out any whispers of evil. Tony would wake shortly after, and slip out too, presumably traveling to the nearest respectable region to save-face with SI or Pepper or Rhodey or if anyone in his life was particularly bothersome and needed to be quelled. Steve would eventually send a new location, encrypted of course, and their rendezvous would proceed at yet another uncouthly procured lodging. Another pin in the map, another pain in his heart.
“Yeah.” Droplets of water flew from Tony’s face as he shook his head to look around. “I can’t believe your mom was right!”
“If you’d been here earlier, Director Fury, you would’ve been in time for the ‘speak now or forever hold your peace’ line that’s so popular at weddings.” Steve wrapped his arms protectively around his husband.
Nomad hesitates, opens his mouth, then turns his head quickly away. In a flash, Nomad grabs Tony and throws him over his shoulder and sprints eastward along the mountain. Tony hears the roar of an oncoming threat, and tries to resist Nomad’s hold, but to no avail.
There always existed an unspoken challenge between them in the beginning, while they both waited to see who would succumb and make the first move. It was a challenge Steve primarily failed.
“Alright, gentlemen, if you could, uh, just settle into these two beds right here, we’ll, uh, get started.” Bruce’s demeanor was timid and nervous, which was nothing new, but at a time like this, it was less than reassuring. They did as they were instructed, and climbed into two large hospital beds, side by side. There were two other staff hovering about, gaze completely averted, and Fury, who silently surveyed everyone present.
His pants were growing uncomfortably tight, a distraction he would have to acknowledge soon. He kept scissoring rhythmically, impressed by how relaxed Tony’s muscles were becoming.
Nothing I’ve done is worth anything if this is the cost. I can’t take it back. And I can’t tell him any of this. There’s so much I never said, and so much I should have told him. And now, there’s so much that I can only tell
“So, you’re Howard’s son?” Tony nodded in response to the question, concealing the sharp twinge in his heart. “But he already passed.”
“Yeah, when I asked if you’d arrived yet. But they kept sayin’ your name wrong. Spelled it wrong, too. With an ‘i.’ It was on the marquee. Are you certain you don’t know the place?” Steve sat with a loud clanking sound as they arrived at their table. “The bartender said when you perform it’s a drag, but I’m sure you’re great, Tony, whatever it is that you do!”
“Our anniversary. The day I promised I would be with you forever, no one but you, no one else, only you. The day...the day I told you that you’re, that we’re...soulmates. The day I pledged my heart and soul to you. The day...I sacrificed all of my tech, repurposed my suits, the day we lost our family...the day the world ended.
Arms crossed tightly across his chest, Steve bristled against the cold New York wind. “If the Chitauri left anything behind, anything at all, we have a responsibility to contain it. What did we do all of that recon for after the attack if not to control all of their tech?”
Tony leaned back in his seat, staring absently out the window. It had just started to rain, and his reflection in the glass made Steve’s heart pound erratically. Suddenly, Tony’s expression changed, and he lunged from his seat to grab Steve by the hand.
It aches. It’s so strange, how your body can feel nothing at all, and yet there is a gaping pain tearing at every shadow within your heart.
There was no escalation, they just started kissing with a feverish desire - with open mouths, curious tongues, and presumptuous teeth.
“Since no one else knows, I like to keep it that way, keep ‘em all guessing. If people knew, well, I’d imagine it would make things more complicated for me.”
“You cannot wish to help me.” It’s a soft utterance that strikes Tony’s heart, and in this moment he can so clearly see the man he once considered an ally.
taste? The man who still wears his Captain America fatigues questions my sense of aesthetics?” His eyes were a bit brighter now, eager, challenging Steve to take the bait.
Perform? That was a strange way to say it. Tony was pretty sure it had only been twice that he’d overindulged and insisted on turning the bar into a karaoke stage. That was ages ago, and it certainly wasn’t on a bi-monthly schedule.
Steve had to look away, he couldn’t meet Tony’s imploring gaze. The ground below his feet began to feel like he was standing on melting snow, giving away when he dug his heels in for support. “...but you, you didn’t know that you, that we…” He couldn’t form the words, the thought was gone.
“Don’t worry, I added some stuff to this playlist that you’ll recognize, too, if you’ve been listening to the radio this century.”
“We’re gonna need the ring, Steve. Tony’s got to dismantle it if there’s any hope to restore your shield and his reactor.”
“I’ve met many people, Steve,” Tony waved a dismissive hand in the air, “and not one has told me the story of their soulbond awakening.”
“Oh, uh, thanks!” he said, awkwardly shifting the large bowl of popcorn to one arm in order to accept the flowers. His expression looked worried. “I’ll just set them on your counter.”
“No foreplay, huh?” Tony raised an eyebrow, to which Steve rolled his eyes. “No, not much. Just keep thinking about that thing you said.”
“If I could,” Steve reaches a hand out, then stills, and Tony has no idea what he might be trying to do, “might I return the favor?”
“I don’t want that.” He pulled back to stare into Steve’s eyes, resolute in his statement. "Not just me."
A quiet groan emitted from the plush heap he had just escaped. Steve glanced over his shoulder to see Tony, eyes closed, contented smile animating his face, reaching a weary hand in his proximity.
Still, Tony was here, nestled heavily against his rough suit. He was still holding on. It was time Steve held on, too.
“But why? Why make them fall in love and get married? That’s some weird shit right there to force someone to do, even if it is aliens!”
“How did you know?” Tony jumped to interrupt the thought he couldn’t quite bring himself to finish. “You know, that this…”
“Uh, sorry Tony, but yeah. You’ll be sedated in a moment, but I expect you to experience some involuntary convulsions while the toxin runs its course.”
“Steve?” Tony jumped to his feet as Steve approached, hips swaying with an exaggerated swagger, a ridiculous plastic sword hanging off an oversized belt fastened by a gaudy golden buckle. Steve’s eyes were nearly obscured by the brim of a floppy chestnut-colored hat adorned with the largest crimson feather he’d ever seen, and upon closer inspection, Tony could see a large golden hoop hanging from one of Steve’s ears. The look was made complete with a weathered, striped shirt that loosely hung from Steve’s shoulders, and slouching dark boots that clunked loudly as he walked.
Everything about Steve was delectable. His booming laughter was positively infectious, his subtle insecurities were admirable, his broad smile was charming. His sparkling azure eyes were as deep and unknowable as the sea - alluring, nourishing, ever-changing. The man out of time was full of surprises, and for once, Tony didn’t mind being proven wrong.
It was all so new, so uncharted for them both, and Steve was still learning what was good for Tony. What they had was fragile in its novelty, and Steve felt reverence for what Tony was trusting him to build. His candid plan was working, and quickly, their post-mission ritual began to evolve.
But despite the long walks at sunrise, exploring weird places together, near-nightly dinners, and the constant, passionate, sex they shared, they still argued like nothing had changed since the day they met, Tony still sulked in his workshop for hours on end, Steve still repeatedly stuck his foot in his mouth, and could never sieze a moment to tell him what he knew.
Nomad takes off running at lightning speed, and Tony is able to glance around to see no signs of their attackers. He looks up and sees there is a crack in the cowl from where the crimson drips, and Tony isn’t so incapacitated that he can’t understand that Nomad saved his life, only to take control of it again.
Tony's hands tremble as he reaches to take the fractured cowl. The crack is horrifying, and he knows it’s a miracle the man is alive. He’s never seen the Captain’s face before, and the realization strikes his heart like lightning in a moment that he has no time to waste, so he proceeds despite his hesitance. When his hands rest upon the broken headpiece and his fingers begin to wrap around the edges, Nomad’s eyes meet his with a wild, horrified expression. And still, he’s not resisting, even though Tony now feels his terror as if it were his own.
The words are peppy but the dark edge hits Steve as he realizes he’s fighting for his life, and the lives of all of New York. He can’t seem to escape threats to the security of the city or the state, no matter the decade.
I’m told the funeral is approaching. It’s surreal. The formidable, indestructible, incredible, Iron Man. How can we hold a funeral for a man made of iron?
Nomad jerks him towards his chest. “I have use for you,” he utters, and Tony rolls his eyes. “But I’d be amenable to a different arrangement. I’ll take your hand in marriage, if you’d prefer it.”
“Ma used to tell me that when you kiss your soulmate in the rain, your soulbond will awaken and you’ll hear music that no one else can hear.”
“Well which is it? You didn’t know what we were doing? Or you were scared of losing me?” His demeanor had changed abruptly, his voice was still harsh but Tony was starting to let Steve back in, and Steve knew he didn’t deserve it. “Which reason explains why I’ve never seen your soulmark, Steve?” His voice was impossibly tender, filled with sorrow. Steve knew he was listening, really listening, and wanted to hear the truth. It was more than he could bear.
The moment they met, Steve knew they were soulmates. It didn’t take long to realize what the delicate, deep-red
Steve’s eyes settled on a light piece of paper next to his bed. He forced his sight into complete darkness, walked to the bed, and impulsively crumpled the paper in his hand. A few deep breaths later, and Steve still couldn’t bring himself to drop the ruined paper in the trash bin.
The question came as a surprise, but it wasn’t a novel thought. In fact, the very idea was terrifying to Steve, and he clung to every anecdote that could impugn the concept.
“Hmm...not really, I can’t wait until then.” He drew closer, wrapping his arms around the smaller man securely, tightly. Tony laughed, nuzzling into his broad chest.
he hears Clint yell off in the distance, somehow not through the comms, and Steve suppresses a chuckle. Tony sure does know how to bring people together.
It’s incessant, the music, and despite the crisp clarity of the singer's vocals, many of the words are rattled off so quickly they start to mindlessly fade into the background as Steve focuses on the Chitauri. But he’s lying if he doesn’t admit it’s a bit fun too.
Intrepid hands greedily roamed across exposed skin, grabbing and caressing with enthusiasm, until Steve felt like he might burst from the foreplay alone. He shifted to his side, and Tony slotted his pelvis to meet Steve’s in an impossible interlocking of legs and hips.
The process was gradual. He gave Tony the occasional, small compliment, the kind that was believable and honest, about anything other than their work together. Of course, he gave praise when Tony made a good call on the battlefield, but he was careful to keep that sort of talk specific and detailed and reserved for debrief meetings at first. He built the other sorts of compliments slowly, steadily, and deliberately. When Tony began to bristle less and ramble more after these sorts of exchanges, Steve knew he was making progress, earning credibility. He allowed the praise to come more freely, less premeditatedly, and it seemed to be working a bit, but only that - a bit.
“Wouldn’t miss it for the world!” Wade replied excitedly, waving to Peter’s aunt with a big grin plastered on his face.
The Iron Man suit unfolded in the hatchback and broke out of the back window. It picked up the vehicle and the Hydra agents instantly started shooting at them.
Howard and Peggy had been looking into the Project Rebirth murders for the last ten years and Howard had barely interacted with his son in those years. Holidays and summers were their time…if he wasn’t at work.
There was no furniture, not even a cot for him to sleep on. The only loose article was the wool blanket they had given him. They wanted to take away his power so he wouldn’t try to hurt his target but, even with just a blanket, he knew at least a dozen ways to kill someone even in his one-armed state.
Peter chuckled and greeted the others as they streamed into the room. His bedroom at the Tower was bigger than his bedroom in Queens but it quickly felt smaller with all of the Avengers filling its space.
Tony shook his head and murmured, “Brooklyn has changed a lot since you last saw it and if Fury knew you left Malibu, he’d direct his resources to finding you. I’m sorry, Bucky, it has to be me, but I’ll find him and bring him home.”
Peter turned around to see Eddie standing close behind him. Peter took half a step back and said, “Hey, Eddie! I didn’t see you come in…You doing alright?”
Peter inhaled sharply but, before he could exhale a shout, Venom shot half its body mass at his face and smothered his voice and he fell back onto the bed with a heavy thud. Peter limbs were fully freed with Venom’s sudden jump to his head and he quickly flailed them, knocking over his lamp and a few books off his end table. The thuds seemed as loud as gunfire and Peter paused in his struggling to see if anyone noticed.
A bit of drool was dripping out of the corner of his mouth and he was snorting lightly. He was laying on his side with one arm tucked under his head and the other drooped over Peter's waist. Peter only had on some loose pajama bottoms whereas Wade was still pretty much fully dressed. He'd kicked off his shoes before going into bed with Peter but Wade hadn't spared even the few seconds it would take to change just so he could stay in contact with Peter.
Happy narrowed his gaze to the people crossing the street down the block and murmured to Peter, “I’ll park around the block and drive the car around every half-hour.”
He and Tony wore hats, shaded glasses, and clothes they did not usually wear all to remain incognito. He even gave Peter a baseball hat, which he continuously tugged on. They snuck out through the underground garage and drove to a small park in Queens. May Parker met them there and made them all peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Ben could not make it because he had work.
“You need water more than coffee,” Steve commented and wondered when Tony had last had the said liquid.
“You’re dead, Steve,” Tony hissed. “You should have moved on. You should have never been in my dreams. What if this is it?? What if you’re finally l-leaving me?” Tony’s voice broke with the notion.
Coulson had seen him, himself. Captain Rogers may have been a little pale but he was breathing on his own and his mortal injuries were no longer life-threatening. Yet…
The reason being became apparent as a dark tendril wound around Peter’s arm. Tony’s hand tightened on Steve and he demanded, “Pump more of the gas in there, Bruce!”
They were getting nowhere on planning. It was Steve’s forte. Tony’s heart ached as he remembered his arguments with Steve on the importance of plans versus flying into the fray without one. He now saw how important it was to have, at least, some semblance of a plan…he would never risk his soulmate on a whim.
Tony’s heart skipped a beat and he felt like he wanted to clap, laugh, and kiss Steve all at once. Caressing his lips lightly against Steve’s mouth, he whispered, “Me too. I’d be a wreck without you so don’t you dare go cliché on me.”
All of it was so unfair and horrifying. Tony was tempted to escape it by grabbing a bottle of vodka and locking himself away from it all.
Steve sighed heavily again and took a sip from the coffee Tony had given him. The coffee was black with none of the milk or creamer he would have preferred but he did not taste the overly strong bitterness. It tasted like nothing and he barely noticed its burning temperature.
Steve couldn’t help but shout and went to catch him, but Tony caught himself on one of the window frames.
In the lab, the boys hovered beneath the suit in its glass case. Harry was jumping up and down and Peter was excitedly pointing out parts of the suit and explaining what did what.
“I don't need to get to know Deadpool more,” Tony stated, childishly proving his stubbornness. “I know who he is and he is not the one for my son.”
Steve nodded and replied, “I hadn’t realized how infused you were in my life until you were gone…It felt like I was missing a piece of myself…”
And they both avoided talking about the huge white elephant in the room of Steve’s existence. Tony had survived such a traumatic experience that both of them unanimously agreed to concentrate on loving each other instead of thinking about the future.
Tony's mouth dumbly but silently flapped open and close as he searched for the words to say but he could barely grasp what just happened. How was he supposed to respond to it?
“Even if you lived in the other side of the world, I would have heard at least a whisper of you. You took this thing apart like it was a baby’s four-piece puzzle. My top assistants would need twice the time that you did and they’ve taken them apart before! You have skill. How do I not know of you?”
They were whispering excitedly to each other as they loaded leftovers into the fridge. His dad spotted him first and whispered in a raised voice to Peter, “Sorry! We didn’t mean to wake you!”
Steve stared at Tony as his friend’s singular utterance of his name echoed in his mind. Why didn’t he let go?
"Great Scott," Tony gasped sarcastically at the intrusion, and breaking their kiss. Steve laughed, making Tony smile at the joyful man above him.
He’d been cheated out of many things growing up. Being both of poor health and poor wealth amounted to him missing out on a lot. He took it all though and shouldered it like it was a badge of honor for him to overcome but…but this was the one thing Steve didn’t want to shoulder.
It looked like there were a few pictures from last night taken of them without their knowing and Steve commented to Tony, “You were right about people noticing you.”
“Leave a mark,” Tony gasped. His fingers carded Steve’s hair, encouraging him on. Steve did as Tony commanded and sucked at his neck. A groan broke free from Tony’s throat and Steve’s cock throbbed at the sound.
Steve rolled, encasing Peter between his arms and chest. Peter wailed in terror and gripped his chest tightly. Steve landed on his right shoulder and screamed as he hit his wounds. His vision blurred and a watery figure walked up to them.
Tony sighed heavily. At this rate, Steve was going to turn into Pepper 2.0. He turned off the arc welder and clipped his tools onto his belt. He then crossed his arms over his chest and glowered down at Steve. He stated, “I have been handling these tools since I learned how to walk. I know what I’m doing.”
!” Steve gasped, his voice rough with emotion. “Vision and Wanda will be there in another minute. Let them handle this.
Steve folded his discarded clothes before putting them back into the bag with his other traveling items. The last thing he put in was the Iron Man toy. He had taken it out of the jacket and peered at it for a moment before lightly kissing it on its tiny head.
“C’mere,” Tony said, pulling Steve to the center of the bed. “I’m going to kiss you like I’ve want to all day.
Steve refocused on the boat that would take him back home. He whispered, “Yes, I know that much at least…” But how much had it changed? New York could be a whole new city. Was Brooklyn still there? He was afraid to ask…
He unfortunately didn’t have time to wonder about what had happened between the time Obadiah stole his reactor and he got his original reactor back. Because
Peter crawled up on the couch and nestled into Steve’s side. He tucked his action figure between them and sighed heavily.
“Come in,” Steve’s voice made Tony freeze. “Would you like anything to drink? I have water, Gatorade, iced tea…”
With their eyes connected like this, Tony could see Steve’s reactions. He could see how much he came undone by the blow job. Steve blushed from a combination of embarrassment and arousal. It was the most erotic and intimate thing Steve had ever done and he couldn’t imagine sharing it with anyone other than the man between his legs.
“We can go to America,” he whispered, already imagining taking Natasha down the same streets he and Steve ran down.
“I don’t think I could ever grow tired of doing anything with you,” Steve murmured truthfully, lightly kissing his neck.
Tony seemed to finally note Wade’s presence because, when he looked his way, he jumped slightly. Tony also hadn’t seen Wade since the time travel.
When they all got up to go to the gym, Peter immediately latched himself onto Wade's arm and smiled happily at him.
Steve quietly moved around the kitchen as he prepared breakfast. He turned on the coffee machine and patiently waited for Tony’s emergence. As Steve cracked open the second egg for his omelet, Tony dragged his feet into the kitchen.
“He’s on our list, Stark,” Fury countered. “You’re on federal land. Hell, you’re within walking distance of the goddamn Capital Building! This place is crawling with cameras and agents!
Steve’s brows pinched with concern and Tony pointed to it and said, “That was what I didn’t want to see. Next thing I know, you’ll be going to Howard and giving him parenting advice when he hasn’t even met my mom yet.”
He never thought much about why Steve didn’t want to go. He’d assumed it was because he was still waiting for his implant to reset…until Steve revealed the truth behind it one Sunday afternoon.
The father returned the hug and he whispered, “May God lead you true to your love. I will pray for both of you tonight. I hope he is healed and you reach him without any more delay.”
“Do you want me to devour you?” Tony asked hoarsely, Steve could feel him quivering slightly. “Shall I suck you dry? Swallow ever last drop of come? Is that what you want, Steve?”
No, no, no, no! Why did he say that?? Tony was probably joking about practicing!! He was just thinking about how mortified Tony must have been but then there he was forcing him into a situation Tony only teased about happening! Steve tried to brush it away and smirked awkwardly at Tony. The older man was staring at him with a blank expression and Steve laughed nervously and said, “Never mind, it was just a—.”
He only let the bright and moving billboards distract him for a second. He then spun around, looking for a hint of Stark Tower. He knew it was in Manhattan but he and Tony never really discussed exact coordinates. They never had a reason to.
“I…I don’t know,” she gasped. “The armor suddenly-.” She inhaled sharply and he heard her move quickly and something hard hit the metal of the suit. She grunted from the impact then hissed, “I got you.”
“And I think Tony wants to get to know you too,” Rogers whispered. “He…celebrated your birthday, every year since you were born. He might have not reached out to you but he never forgot you.”
The medical examiner’s brows pinched together in confusion and he stated, “Sir, this was the condition of the dress when I received it. There was no tampering. I didn’t believe the Captain could do it either but DNA doesn’t lie.”
“Please, don’t do this. We have time. We can work it out,” Peggy begged, still not accepting the reality.
Tears fell freely from Tony’s eyes by the time Peggy was done and he gasped, “How can I possibly move on after – after…” Tony choked on the words and turned onto his side to bury his face into his pillow. His shoulders began to shake and he sobbed into his pillow. Peggy tried to comfort him, but Tony hissed, “Leave me alone!”
“Pep – we – no, I…I was wondering, and I know this is probably the worst time to ask but, can I adopt you? Legally make you my son? I love you very much Pete and would be honored if you said yes, because, in my mind, you're already my boy.”
But Peter caught himself on the wall as he crawled down it like the forces of gravity held no meaning to him. He must have crawled up the wall the same way and had done so behind the rabbit, which was why Steve had originally not seen him.
Steve sighed to himself then settled down next to Tony. Tony automatically pulled himself into Steve and grumbled nonsense into his chest.
“I don’t know how I would ever repay you,” Steve said. Peter tugged at his collar and Steve mutely followed his reach to a cage of lemurs. Tony kept in step with him.
Peter physically pinched himself to confirm the validity of the situation. Upon the flare of pain, his body was flooded with emotion as everything became that much more real.
Tony did not relent and reached out to grasp the fold of Steve’s breast pocket and let his arm hang heavily off it. He murmured, “I think we should try ‘us’. We’ll go into the relationship knowing there’s an expiration date but we can still have it.” Tony ran his hand up Steve’s chest and then cupped the side of his neck. Steve did not push him away nor did he break his gaze. He stared at Tony with wide eyes and, beneath Tony’s hand, he could feel Steve’s pulse rising. Tony continued, “It’d be better than denying it, right?”
“He probably use it as the perfect excuse to disinherit me,” Tony scoffed and the pleasant feeling from the labor dwindled as he thought about the man who barely raised him. He sighed and looked up to the Mark III’s face shield. He thought back to the other day in Galmara and of the relief and thanks the villagers expressed after he saved them.
Wade reacted immediately and got the metal pole between himself and Venom’s large jaws. Wade’s muscles bulged as he pushed back at the strength of Venom’s bite but the monster still raked him with its long claws, dragging large amounts of blood from his boyfriend.
Steve nearly jumped out of his seat during the chest buster scene and they teased him as he settled back down onto the couch. His dad loved the movie and had made popcorn partway through and kept shushing them during the tenser parts. Around the second movie, Peter dozed off halfway through it as Steve was bemoaning the tactics of the space marines. Wade woke him with a light kiss to the cheek as the credits began to roll. A new batch of popcorn was made and they started the third movie. This time Peter leaned onto Wade’s side and they shared a bowl of popcorn between them as both his parents began to discuss Ripley’s role in the film.
before. Don’t ask him to go through more traumas before he’s even on his feet yet. Natasha…If you ever considered me something more than your boss or assignment…please, give Steve this chance. Don’t tell Coulson. Don’t tell SHIELD.”
—,” Steve leaned forward and was about to reprimand her but then she reached across and slapped Steve across the face as well.
. He nestled his face into his Pops’ chest and listened to his heart beat. He was alive. He was real. He was home…and Peter knew everything was going to be alright.
Thank you again everyone who has read, left kudos, commented, bookmarked, and subscribed! It's things like that, that encourages me to keep writing and make my day! :)
Cable cursed under his breath as he lowered his binoculars and then hissed to Steve, “Osborn walked right past Stark with the reactor.”
“Hey, Tiger, happy birthday!” Peter spun around and Mary Jane enveloped him in a tight hug. Peter buried his face in her red tresses and held her tightly to him. It’d been months since he last saw her. She was his best friend and neighbor since he was young and was the closest thing to a sister he’d ever had. She had moved to Los Angeles not long after they graduated high school and started a career as a model. She was doing amazing and any other person would have probably dropped Peter the second they got any fame, but not MJ. They kept in contact through texting and FaceTime. Despite the distance and years, they were still as close as ever.
Bucky and Gabe exchanged glances. Tony’s statement was loaded and Bucky couldn’t help but wonder what it was Tony knew about the future that bothered him so.
When he looked in the mirror, he felt like he was looking at a stranger and it wasn’t because of the beard or the longer hair…His eyes had no light and his expression was empty.
Once the buffoons left, Norman destroyed all the evidence. They were clearly too worried about the boy to truly consider Norman’s role in the matter. In fact, no one had approached him for questioning, not even one of the Avengers. Their number one priority was finding Venom and “curing” the boy, and it was a bad mistake.
“He was an incredible man,” Bruce gasped, trying to comfort Steve. His own voice was wet and harsh as he held back tears of his own.
Peter nodded then wordlessly padded over to the couch and slid his mask out from beneath the pillow. Both of the men’s eyes grew large and equal looks of shock filtered across their faces. They probably assumed he would try to deny it. He asked, “So how long have you known I was Spider-Man?”
Yet before the prosecutor could get out a single word, there was a rustling behind him and the entire courtroom became deathly silent. Steve turned back around, expecting he was going to have to calm Tony down again.
All along, in the back of his mind, his thoughts lingered on Bucky. As he ate he wondered if Bucky had anything to eat and when he went to bed he wondered if Bucky had a bed to sleep in. He worried for his lost friend and could not help but wonder if he was still watching him like he had promised.
Peggy had yet to use the tent so the table was empty and Steve didn’t pause to lay Tony down on it. With his arms free, he leaned over Tony and cupped his face, running his thumbs over his cheekbones. He was so worried for him and Tony looked so scared, neither of them really thought about it. As soon as Steve’s hands were on his face, Tony wound his arms around the back of his neck and pulled him in. They kissed passionately as their fear obliterated their reason and they kissed more for comfort than for passion.
Steve moved back and draped a blanket over Tony. He rubbed his arms and murmured, “Ready to go to bed?”
He was a little apprehensive about seeing Steve so soon after their breakup…could it be categorized as a breakup? It certainly felt like one to Tony but they were never officially together. Would he call it a split? A meandering of ways? The end of cock on cock action? The possibilities were endless…and it just depressed him to think about.
They went back upstairs, tracing the same route they had taken when Steve first arrived. Tony led him into the bedroom and then to the connected en-suite bathroom. As Steve took it all in, Tony leaned against the edge of his tub…that was thrice the size of a normal tub.
“You have always been so easy to read. I merely needed to look at the sky and know how you were feeling…” Tony whispered to him, turning in the old chair to face Steve.
Bucky let her turn over his hand as she inspected it for cuts. He watched her with unabashed confusion.
It’d be so easy to slip back into his old life that revolved around the alcohol contents of the latest bottle in hand. He’d be able to muffle the pain with enough booze.
“Ughhhh, my voice?” Tony guessed. The dream world was silent with the exception of their own voices.
“Are these people spreading these ‘rumors’ about me and Wade the same ones who think I’m a clone of my dad?” Peter asked sarcastically, and the audience laughed as if on cue. He still had his eyebrow raised and was staring pointedly at Sophie. Before coming to the program, their media teams got together and complied an outline of the show. Peter had known all the questions she was going to throw at him and she was going to know the answers. It was practically scripted and these questions about Wade were not a part of it. They were going to talk about what Christmas and Thanksgiving were like with the Avengers. That was supposed to be it.
big secret and appeared nonchalant as always. The 'boss' name Natasha was calling Bucky seemed to make much more sense now. A million questions stemmed from her revelation but Steve bit them back as he looked down the barrel of her gun. Natasha ignored their shocked expressions and repeated, “Put down the gun, boss.”
Tony blinked open his heavy eyelashes, weighted down by his tears. He stared at the spot where he lightly caressed the coffin and his eyes focused on his wedding ring. Memories flooded him from their wedding: Steve slipping the ring on his finger, throughout the wedding Steve pulling his hand up to kiss the band, and feeling the metal cut into his skin as he gripped Steve tightly as they made love that night. When they got married Tony thought he was going to spend the rest of his life with Steve.
Steve too could feel himself responding to the lust still flowing through him and murmured, “Is this what it is like with all soulmate couples? Nonstop sex in their dreams?”
He spotted the crowd gathering and the flashing lights of the two police vehicles. Jarvis focused his cameras on the perpetrator and the knife he was wielding around. Tony flew up behind him and shot the knife from his hand with rubber bullets before the man even noticed him.
– One day, you just gave me this look and I just knew,” Steve mumbled, his flush growing bright red. Tony smiled warmly at him and turned to lean into his chest.
"...Did-Did I interrupt something?" Coulson asked as he slowly strolled to a stop into the room. The damn agent must have hacked his elevator again. It was his voice that broke the silence between him and Steve.
“Well let’s hope it won’t have to come to that,” Steve murmured, sparing one more glance up to the sparse canopy and blue skies. His eyes returned to the horizon and his resolve back to the mission. Jarvis being overprotective of his master was not as bad as Tony made it out to be. It meant Steve did not have to worry as much about Tony’s safety.
!” Tony retorted, “And what about you? I thought Captain America was this great super soldier! You couldn’t see past the schemes?? You were so ready to trust Mary as soon as you heard she was alive!”
Eventually, they came across Bucky’s gift, the plainest out of them all, wrapped in newspaper just as he used to wrap the gifts he got for Steve in the 40s.
Bucky had given him a moment alone before they went back to camp. Steve had leaned against one of the empty houses and Bucky turned to give Steve some semblance of privacy. Steve stifled his mouth with one hand and with the other wiped furiously at his eyes to keep them somewhat dry as his shoulders shook and he shallowly gasped for breath.
“Only if you're ready,” was Wade's instant retort. He wanted Peter like crazy but there was no way he'd ever take advantage of him.
In the meantime, he could only use his body and words to shield his son. He had no idea who the General was but he seemed to have an unnatural hatred toward Bruce and that hatred had moved onto the boy he believed Bruce’s son.
She cupped his face and she felt him instantly relax beneath her touch. She whispered, “Let’s save Steve.”
WOW intense reaction to the ending of last chapter! No need to worry! The new chapter is here and the end is approaching! Once again, I'd like to thank all of you who have been reading, commenting, bookmarking, and leaving kudos! It's things like that that give me the drive to keep writing! :)
Tony lifted Steve’s legs over his shoulders and picked up his hips, plunging deeper into him. Tony’s finger dug into the flesh of Steve’s ass and gasped, “Yes. You’re amazing. God, you feel so good. Ahh, yes, Steve. Steve, don’t stop.”
Steve put down his sketchbook and grinned eagerly at Tony. When did Steve become so blessed that he warranted such a perfect boyfriend?
.” He paused and squeezed his hand and asked, “I love you. Can…Can we promise to tell each other that every night? No matter what? Even if we are fighting?”
“There’s no need to pay me back, I was just doing my patriotic duty,” Tony said with his teasing smile. Steve learned long ago to not take his mockery personally but he could not help but roll his eyes upon Tony’s jibe.
Peter scurried out of an alley, one hand clutching the front of his shirt tightly, and gasped, “I’m here! Let’s go!”
“Steve!” Tony gasped happily when he saw him. “We’re going to have a toast. Do you think Peter could handle a wine glass full of apple juice?”
A range of emotions coursed through Steve, but mainly, it was grief. It was fairly obvious what the robot meant when he said, “used to.” He didn’t know when his friend passed, and it was probably decades from now, but just knowing it happened was sobering. It was another reminder they were not immortal and, like Gibbons, he too could lose his friends.
For years, he never felt anything but anger or annoyance whenever he thought about his mate…until the day he was kidnapped.
Pepper murmured evilly under her breath as she stepped past him. She was the one who cultivated Tony’s art collection and thought of it as her baby so she was probably pissed now, which, Tony felt was much better than being scared of Bucky. Tony smiled after her retreating form and then turned back to the assassin in his living room.
Tony nodded and the scanner began to rise again. This time his heart was beating faster and his hands were clenched.
Steve and Tony both woke up and looked to their bedroom door. Peter stood there, illuminated only by the nightlight in the hallway. In his arms, Steve could just make out Peter’s favorite Iron Man toy.
They heard the elevator doors click open in the other room and Natasha murmured to Peter, “That must be your dad.”
Steve laughed and said, “Either way, we also wanted to give you a heads up about our upcoming nuptials.”
, there’s no way anyone will believe her! They’ll see you as the victim! Another gay man unjustly treated for his sexual orientation! We can even spin it that Tyler did this because she’s a bigot!
Tony frowned at the hologram and groaned, “The man looks more like a dorrito than Chewbacca! Run a facial recognition on both of them, J, and, if they come back, inform my employees that I want to speak to them immediately!”
He whispered, “I’m sorry too…” For all the pain they caused each other, for being the one to first want a relationship that’d only end in heartbreak, for leaving him first in death…
Steve sighed heavily, dismay weighing heavily on his heart. He took a deep breath and strengthened his voice to sound like he was ready, able, and about to fight with them as he asked the team, “What are you flying into?”
Harry always came over to their Tower, Steve never wanted to let Peter go over to Oscorp Tower because he did not want such a negative influence in his son’s life. Norma took it as a personal insult. He never confronted Steve or Tony personally but glared daggers at them all the same.
“But Peter is so cute and he has your eyes, no one can say no to those eyes when they get all big and adorable and blue and…”
“Maybe this is a good thing,” Tony mumbled, thinking about the recording Jarvis made without his permission.
“I’m so happy…I didn’t ever think I could feel this happy,” Steve observed in an astonished whisper.
“So, cheers to today.” Tony raised an empty hand, mimicking a toast. The movement distracted Steve from his thoughts, and he realized that Tony had been talking the whole time. The brunette gave a smile, and pushed himself up to stand. Steve followed instinctually, and the two began to walk toward the entrance to the compound.
Steve. He met Steve Rogers. Fought with him, spent days in his company. There is so much more for Tony just on the other side of that wormhole. And not even now, staring down death, can Tony accept the unlikely chance that he will see Steve again.
If only I had talked to him. If only I hadn’t fought, hadn’t encouraged others to fight, too. If only I turned myself in earlier. If only I had accepted the deal he offered to me...if only I had done anything different, anything at all, I could have been there to protect him, I should have protected him...I would give anything to go back and be there to protect him…
“Right pocket,” Tony grabbed his pants from the floor and tossed them to Steve. There he found a small bottle of lube.
? Rather, you're Captain America? All that time we were serving together, galivanting around as Avengers, and you kept this from me?”
When they part, Tony is breathless yet again, but this time, it doesn’t hurt. Now all he wants is for Steve to steal his breath again, and again, and again.
He wordlessly turns the song off in a sweat, visions of falling consuming his mind, but the lyrics continue unrelentingly in his brain.
Steve kept his eyes on Tony while the medical staff came to secure them with restraints dangling from the sides of their beds, but his subtle attempts to catch Tony’s attention failed miserably, as Tony only started determinedly at the ceiling.
“Fury and Hill think it has to do with Cap’s shield. It isn’t operating as it once did. Tony compromised it to make a wedding ring. And rumor is that he carved out a piece of his reactor to combine with the vibranium, but Stark won’t confirm.”
I thought I had time to fix things with him. I thought if I served my sentence, when I was released, I’d be able to mend it all with him. I agreed to the sentence, forsaking the deal he fought to offer me, all in the name of being a united front. I wanted to appear as if we were undivided again, show the world that we could agree on something meaningful. And I told myself, if the world sees this, sees what I’m doing, maybe he will see it too. Maybe I’ll be able to change his mind, prove to him our undeniable magnetism, show him how good we are together.
“You’re too late, Nomad,” he says with a mirthless laugh, and before he can stop himself, his heart spills it's thoughts carelessly. “Three years too late. A different time, perhaps, I might have even considered a casual tryst. I’ll admit there is allure to your present rogue aesthetic. But now, there’s no hope for me. I fell in love. Deeply. He was true...and he’s dead. The wounds remaining on my heart will never heal. Even to save my life I couldn’t pretend to marry you. So, tell me, what other choice is there?”
He reached his hand down without looking and grabbed at Tony’s ass, massaging closer and closer to his opening. Tony’s legs splayed wide, an invitation to continue.
Tony takes a hand from Steve’s hold and wipes away the tears before he’s leaning forward and pressing feather-light kisses to Steve’s cheeks, to his forehead, to his chin, his neck, everywhere he can reach. “I never stopped loving you, Tony,” he feels Steve whisper against his lips.
There was a mission, an abrupt onslaught that was subdued with ease and cohesion. But there was a moment in battle when JARVIS was temporarily overridden and Tony was sent hurtling toward the clouds against his consent. It was only a moment, and Tony regained control flawlessly, but as soon as it happened, Steve knew what was coming after the debrief.
,” he gave Steve a taunting look, “yeah, the work is hard. I’m exhausted even consulting on some of the stuff SHIELD throws my way. But then I’m so tired I can’t sleep, and it’s just a vicious cycle. Concurrent insomnia and utter collapse, wrapped up in one perfect package. It’s awesome, I love it.”
Then, an attack damaged the penthouse, and Tony started sleeping in his lab while repairing the tower.
“...I was happy too.” Tony almost immediately interrupted, brown eyes now burning into Steve’s with an unmatched intensity.
He knows the words probably don’t mean what they sound like they do. But that doesn’t bother him. The sentiment is there, all the same, and he feels emboldened.
drag.” He searched Steve’s face as confusion clouded his expression. “What do you say we go back to that bar next Saturday? I’ll show you a different side of New York then.”
Distantly, Tony wondered if this is what kissing Steve would feel like each time. He already felt their lives were inextricably intertwined, and feeling Steve’s emotions, both pain and joy, was unparalleled. If one conversation and one kiss could bring them both so much ecstasy, he couldn’t wait to experience everything else Steve was willing to share with him, too.
Bewildered brown eyes met his, and suddenly Steve felt like he could remember what he was supposed to be holding on to, if he could just stare a little bit longer -
Outer space is vast, and after barely tip-toeing across the precipice, he instantly understands how small he is.
There were probably more bars here, maybe Steve had been taken to a more private section of the restaurant?
He feels a fumbling and tugging at the blindfold, and in a moment, his sight is finally free. Eyes focus on the man before him.
, he thinks when the lyrics play through his mind, even though he doesn’t completely remember the exact JARVIS-translation from his inquiry the last time he heard this song.
“I’d put my money on that it would be you.” Instinctually, he rested his hand on Tony’s, and gave a squeeze. He felt his heart leap at the realization of their intimacy, and a dangerous thought suddenly overcame him that he might never want to let go. “If I’m honest, there’s something I worry about more.”
All in all, after rinsing the skin and wiping away the dried outline of blood to the best of his abilities, the wound itself isn’t terrible any longer, and before his eyes, it’s nearly finished healing.
much more, was a prize to be won to be sure. It only made sense that opportunistic vultures would try to take advantage of Steve, so it was easy to jump to such a conclusion when things seemed amiss. While he knew the Captain could take care of himself, his outdated naivete was a vulnerability that leaches of this century still knew how to exploit - a truth that made Tony bristle at the mere thought.
!” upon impact, even though he realizes the person who threw him also broke his fall. The ground is uneven and feels like he’s atop a pile of broken sticks.
, but you get my drift.” He’d already begun to exit the room before Steve could formulate a thought.
Steve found an equal in the dauntless and unyielding Tony Stark, and he’s only just now realizing it, while holding on to stubborn, impossible hope that somehow, Iron Man will pull off another miracle.
how I see it! Of course it is! How could I not?” He digs his heels into the earth and pulls back with a force that’s disappointingly no match for his captor. “Why are you doing this?”
. In his rage and desperation, he had been ready to destroy the suit, right then and there, to leave Tony, burn it to the ground, and run - but when he realized how defenseless and unprepared Tony was against him, he hesitated. He felt wide, brown eyes search his face frantically, and the next thing his mind registered was the loud clanging of vibranium against frigid concrete.
“No!” Steve surprised them both with his enthusiastic rebuke. “Sorry! Sorry, I mean, no, don’t go, you don’t have to go. I mean-” he took a breath to steady himself. Tony was still curled around him, and feeling the scratchy stubble of his beard against his bare chest was clearly having an effect on him. “I’d like for you to stay, if you’d like it, too. I’d imagine you’re a bit worked up after that, so if I can help you settle, I’d really love that.”
and now their bodies are almost pressed against each other, and all Tony can think about is how close Steve’s lips were to his when he woke up on the concrete and what he wanted to do then and now-
“We don’t even remember it! How could you know what you want if you don’t remember!” He was lashing out, he was spiraling, threatened, maybe the right push could get him to unravel...
inscription on his left rib cage signified. During a drunken night together two days after the battle of New York, Tony had casually mentioned the royal blue
It lives in you. I see that it does. You carry it with you every day. And every day, you choose to overcome it. That’s what makes you so strong.”
But he stills, stops fighting - it’s useless now, no matter what way this goes, he feels like he’s falling as Tony is ascending, until Tony’s gone. Swallowed by the wormhole.
“Up.” Nomad commands, in the same tone that his former teammate used to employ. For a moment his mind fools him into thinking it’s Captain America speaking to him, just like he used to do mere months ago. “Will you walk? Or shall I continue to carry you?” The twisted expression returns, and Tony thinks he might break.
“I know, Steve. It’s bad, I know.” Crouched close, the redhead pressed her hands firmly to his shoulders.
He throws his body weight and slips from Nomad’s grasp. Crashing to the ground, he rolls down the mountainside until he can catch himself by bracing his forearms and legs rigidly. Tony scrambles to his feet and bolts. He doesn’t care where he goes. He won’t consent to Nomad’s offers. He would prefer not to die at the hands of his former teammate, and decides that to die at the hands of any other would be less degrading, so he runs.
He couldn’t look at Tony without a compulsion to hold him, he couldn’t hear his voice without longing to share with him his innermost feelings, he couldn’t even be in the same room as Tony without being overwhelmed by his intoxicating smell. His body ached to touch his skin, to taste him on his lips again, a taste that he used to think lasted days, but now knew it was a taste that faded too quickly, and could never, never,
“Webster’s dictionary defines ‘wedding’ as ‘the fusing of two metals with a hot torch…’” Steve started to look to Tony, confused at his response, before the brunet dismissed his statement. “Sorry, sorry, you won’t get that reference. But yeah, what I mean is, I’d like to see them try to take us apart.” His tone was fiery and convincing, but Steve still couldn’t catch Tony’s eyes.
The kiss was salty with sweat, greedy, indulgent, relieving. A tiny jolt of electricity burned his neck, and he pulled away abruptly in surprise of the foreign sensation.
He saved New York, ostensibly the world, but he just can’t quite shake the thought that no one is safe.
“I probably could’ve warned you...but part of me hoped I would have no reason to bring it up. Clearly I underestimated my sleeping abilities.”
“I do, at least, JARVIS tells me so. I think sometimes I get lucky and forget by the morning. Well, not usually...but sometimes!”
“Um, no, I’d really rather not. It’s easier to just try and forget it. Sorry.” He still seemed a bit dejected in his replies.
He removed his hand from Tony’s cock to scrounge around in a small outer pocket of his pants, retrieving a small bottle of lube - a necessity Steve always maintained in his uniform, since the hours were few that he wasn’t wearing it these days.
But Steve knew he had to slip out of the covers and climb out of the bed lest he risk more dire consequences. He rolled to his side, placed a hand on a bare chest, and gently jostled. “
He wrote that he needs me, still, now, in death, and I see now that although my love was unrequited, he never stopped needing me, as I have never stopped needing him.
I don’t know if I had changed anything if his mind would have changed after all. I would like to think he would have wanted me if I had done things right, and yet...
This song Steve does recognize, and Tony was right about how he knows it. He’d been listening to the radio in a futile attempt to find comfort similar to what he would do when he was young. But now, the music that plays is jarring, unlike anything he was accustomed to hearing.
“But, you’re not grateful, are you? You don’t have to lie. If you don’t want to talk, that’s fine. But you don’t have to hide it from me.”
I apologize for my last letter. I was overcome with anger, and I’m sorry I shared my embittered emotions with you. Thank you for understanding.
Steve saw the instant shift in the genius’ demeanor. Tony couldn’t play coy anymore. His smug expression had evolved into a completely devious grin. Steve couldn’t allow Tony the self-satisfaction - he reached down to pull the brunette by his arm to stand, bringing their bodies so close, the space between them was imperceptible.
Steve smiled, and Tony felt ease again, like they already knew each other in all the ways that mattered. It was a novel sensation, and he just wanted the moment to stretch on forever.
“I’ve never heard of medical interventions affecting awakening a soulbond.” Tony finally spoke up, words flowing quickly. “People have all sorts of surgeries, implants, you know, whatever, and we take the craziest drugs these days. Who even knows what chemicals we consume from our food alone. Plus - tanning beds? Basically vita-rays. Or close enough. Look, Steve,” he leaned close, resting a reassuring hand on his leg, “if anyone’s stubborn enough to figure this out, it would be you.”
“No! Oh, well, mostly, but no, not entirely!” He felt heat stinging his cheeks. “I’m sorry, you were already asleep, so I thought it would be ok, I didn’t expect-”
Steve groaned as Tony nipped at his lower lip. His hands ran along every part of him that he could reach, until Tony’s clothes were so offensive, that he had to hastily do away with the fabric barrier.
“SHIELD felt you’d adjust best with some exposure therapy. I’ve got the best cutting-edge tech, considering that I make most of it myself. I can teach you all you need to know to be a savvy nonagenarian thriving in the twenty-first century.” Not to mention the other asset he possessed that SHIELD wasn’t aware of. He was secretively confident his empathic aptitude would be immeasurably helpful in Steve’s recovery.
“Huh?” Steve had heard the question, he just hadn’t formulated a response. He was met with a soft smile illuminated by moonlight that pulled him back to the moment. “Oh, yeah. I guess I should ask Bruce to clean me up.”
“Ah, yes, my young bird friend. I’ve seen Chitauri sabotage similar to this before, and I’d not be surprised to learn this is another of their cruel manipulations.”
In a flash, Tony surged forward, closing the gap, bringing their lips together. Kisses, soft and sweet, quickly turned desperate and needy, and carelessly wandering hands grew from curious to greedy.
With a needy desperation, they rocked against each other, grinding long and slow until Steve felt shudders rolling though his body. He looked to meet Tony’s eyes, and found the most beautiful and honest expression on his face, colored in shades of vulnerability and glowing with pleasure.
, and I have to give it all up? Let me tell you, I sure as fuck don’t feel compromised. I’m not even a goddamned Avenger and I’m losing everything because of it!”
An unknowable emotion clouds Steve’s face, and he hesitates before responding. “I did not know how you would receive me. I thought it better to maintain the lie until I was assured of your fortitude to accept the truth.”
When you talk to Bucky, let him know I’ll be alright. If you see Sharon, encourage her to follow your lead. Same goes for Bucky, I suppose. I put my faith in you.
“I would hope so.” Tony's words were biting, his face screwed up, eyes growing a bit watery. “Why are you being like that?”
I’m still waiting on this letter he promised. I’m starting to suspect another broken promise so perfectly characteristic of Stark.
He asks JARVIS for a different song he recalls hearing years ago, and at first the peppy tune brings some comedy to his disposition. Maybe making light of his experience will help.
Steve flinched at Bruce’s confidence, how could he be so sure about the alien tech controlling their decisions? “And, our memories…?”
“I think I’d like you to try, too.” Steve was looking at Tony now with such focus that his heart started to pound in his chest. That look was so captivating, he started to think the amorous affection rising in his chest had to be deceptive. Surely, Steve couldn’t be feeling such things, not now, not with him.
“I have a great deal to gain by keeping you captive, all to myself.” He’s whispering in his ear, dark and low, and Tony can hear the rough edge of tension in his voice. “I’ll tuck you away, keep you in the highest tower of my castle, and no one will ever get to you, unless I allow them to do so. The world will be so envious, I’ll gain access to the darkest markets, be revered by all the Cabal.”
Steve felt something icy slip into his veins from the crook of his inner arm. He felt it slowly travel along his arm, then cool began to radiate throughout his body, slowly spreading to fill his extremities and his core. He allowed his right arm to roll outwards, whispered Tony’s name, and felt fingers brush against the back of his hand. Awkward from the restraints, the men interlaced fingers. Steve could see Tony’s eyes grow heavy and his body grow limp as the effects of the sedative took hold. The unsurprising realization came slowly, but he knew he wasn’t falling asleep, and knew he wouldn’t. He never had to be subjected to anesthesia for surgery, but it wasn’t unexpected that due to the serum, it might be an impossibility for him to respond to the medicine as one would expect. Steve steadied himself for what was to come, and before he realized he wasn’t ready, a burning sensation tore through his body. It was a violent, uncontrollably reflex, and he felt his body curl up and flex burst inversely. A wave rolled through him, and never stopped. Looking to Tony, he could see the brunet shaking and convulsing. It was disturbing, unnatural, Tony’s body fighting the restraints, eyes closed, incoherent, no knowledge of what was happening. Pain spiked again, Steve was distracted from Tony, he clenched his right hand hard, and was almost distracted from the pain when a hand squeezed his in return. What were they doing? Why were they doing this? What were they about to lose?
“You’ve killed thousands since the Avengers were dismantled. Burned countless cities to the ground. Hospitals, schools, orphanages. How could anyone covet being your prisoner?”
Maybe Steve wasn’t as fragile and maladaptive as Tony had surmised. Sure, he’d lost his way, but survived an experience unlike anything Tony could imagine Steve would have encountered in his life before - he was even laughing about it now, and willing to try it again. Tony was starting to realize it was possible that the Captain who sat before him had what it took to stay afloat in this brave new world.
“‘m not going to die,” he groans, and attempts to bat away at Tony’s insistent hands. “I’m enhanced with miracle healing abilities, lest you forget.” His words are becoming a bit slurred.
He’s hit with some rocks. He feels them bounce off of his body, and other than having a startling effect, he’s not hurt. But, damn, does he wish he could see, and that his mind wasn’t so foggy-
With a cry, Tony came, shuddering violently against Steve. He held him through it, but the sensation was overwhelming, and Steve felt his own release possess him quickly.
Steve allowed his body to cover the slighter man entirely. In an entanglement of limbs, Tony continued to jerk his hips up against Steve’s imposing frame. He felt Tony’s hands running over his bulky outer armor, almost frantic in their movements. He responded with an eagerness of his own, rolling his hips long and hard against the man pinned beneath him, forcing Tony’s desperate twitches to settle.
A shout shook his mind, and he saw a glimmer of crimson in the sky. Hulk leapt to catch it, and as his body caught up to his mind, he ran to where the armor had landed. His heart was in his chest, he’d seen soldiers in his company succumb before, but this, this was different, Tony wasn’t a soldier, he wasn’t a fellow GI, he was different, he was -
Steve hadn’t shared a room or a sleeping arrangement with anyone since before the ice. He now only slept alone. It wasn’t his choice, and it certainly wasn’t his preference, but he didn’t complain. His apartment in Avengers Tower was more than comfortable. He’d convinced Tony to make his space a bit homely, and that was good enough. Not enough to cure the loneliness that the 21st century carried, but still, it was enough.
“The fact that I went into the ice, missed out on my own time. I’m sure that’s the reason why I won’t find my soulmate.”
I’ve just received the news I'm sure you already know. I can’t bring myself to even write it in this letter. None of this feels real, I don’t know why I’m even writing you. Sam, I spend my days alone in my cell. I can’t accept visitors, and now the guards are telling me I can’t expect that to change for the duration of my sentence. Which is fine, really, the only visitor I had hoped to see was him…
Tony walked up to the statue and put his hand on the shield with a heavy sigh. He never spoke to a dead person before…not even at his parents’ graves. Where did one start?
Peter yawned again and watched Steve with barely open eyes as he pulled out a tiny spoon. He opened the apple sauce, scooped out some and held out the full spoon to his son.
“Best friend, indeed,” Tony agreed but on the inside he felt sad which was the exact opposite reaction he expected. The word fake was being thrown between carelessly but Tony just wanted to throw it far away and make it real…
Steve had lost a brother and regained him in less than a week. On top of his own, escape from death and the impending reunion with Tony, well…Steve could barely put into words the emotions he was feeling.
The judge sat at the table at the forefront of the room. Tony’s lawyers waited for him at the table to the judges left and the prosecution sat at the table to the judge’s right. There were others who worked for the court milling around but Steve’s eyes did not focus on them. His eyes were on the woman who would decide his freedom.
“The rest of the team can handle the base,” Steve retorted sharply. “Tony…we don’t know what will happen to the
“I have more than enough faith that you will cause some sort of scandal or find a way to mortify Steve to death,” Pepper stated.
When his Spidey-Sense usually went off, all his hair stood on end and he always felt a pressure on his body in the opposite direction of the danger with his muscles automatically tensing, readying him to jump away.
“There are very few solutions with what to do with you,” the man continued and Eddie perked up. Wait…they had multiple ideas already? Venom moved uneasily underneath his skin.
The Avengers attempted to enter the room once Peter was unconscious but Venom had been unaffected by the drug and pushed them back. They did not attempt again, fearing the monster would hurt Peter more.
Cable shrugged and said, “From now until you and Stark are reunited after you wake hinges on Stark. If you don’t interact with him and I fix this reactor in time, everything should be fine. I’ve been traveling through the past for years and haven’t disrupted much because I kept an eye on the big stuff.”
Cable clapped his shoulder and assured him, “Then we will complete this without incident and you’ll return to a future with Stark alive and well in it.”
Which was why he was trying with all of the fiber of his being to fight the Red Skull’s hold on him.
“Agreed,” Steve whispered. He spun around and grabbed his shield. As he slid it onto his arm, he asked, “Can I get a lift?”
Just as they were cleaning up dinner, all of their communicators went off. Steve was the first to pull his out and answer it.
“My suit will be here any moment,” Tony gasped hoarsely, his voice almost manic as he clutched at Steve. “You don’t have to die!”
Peter did not immediately return to the penthouse after he and Eddie called it quits for the day. Instead, he went to the Avengers’ labs and there he found Bruce and Scott hunched over a
Tony pressed his face into Steve’s neck and murmured, “What the heck happened? Didn’t the Goblin crush my old reactor??”
His soulmate giggled excitedly and then pressed his body into Tony. Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist and his mouth found its way back to Steve’s.
Steve inhaled sharply and watched with abated breath as he tapped at his phone and brought it to his ear.
MJ’s lips also quirked up and she said, “You are going to tell me everything Peter has been holding out on.” She tucked Wade’s hand into the crook of her arm and began to walk him away as she said, “I want all the dirty details and when I say dirty, yes, I am alluding to the sex.”
“What’s going on, Peter?” Steve countered. “Why the sudden interest? This isn’t a usual father-son talk. I know it’s officially my first day as your ‘legal’ father but do you
As they navigated the building, Peter expected the cheesy pickup lines to start up again but Wade asked him about his internship and Peter dived into describing the experiment he and Eddie were working on.
Peter noticed Tony's change in expression and stated, “While I’m with Wade, I’ll check to see what his schedule is like and pick a night where we can all have dinner and properly get to know each other.”
At first, Peter avoided Tony and Tony believed he might have blamed Tony for what happened to Steve. Yet, after the funeral, Peter changed. He latched onto Tony and refused to let go. It was enough to make Tony weep again and he held his son for what felt like hours. From that point on, Peter took comfort in Tony’s nearness and would hold him whenever he was given the chance, Tony happily returned the embraces and held him for as long as he needed.
“If I put out a billboard, Chewie himself might see it and try coming back…” Tony added with a smirk as he imagined Pepper’s expression.
“I knew old ladies back in Brooklyn who had a tougher punch than this thing,” Steve hissed. He was antagonizing the Red Skull and he knew it wouldn’t do him good but that flicker of annoyance in the man’s eyes was reward enough.
Steve stepped forward and mediated, “But like Peter said, Wade is not Stane. We shouldn’t fight about this.” To Tony, Steve pointedly said, “We haven’t really even met Wade, Tony. The only times we’ve interacted with him was during or after fights, not on a personal level. We shouldn’t be so quick to judge. Let’s give him a chance.”
He broke the kiss when he tasted salty tears. He stepped back and was surprised to see she wasn’t crying or hurt. She smiled at him and wiped the tears off his own face.
He blinked back his surprise as he recognized one of the detectives on his case standing in the rubble before him.
in New York was invited. It was so crowded, Peter felt like he was at the beach on the first weekend of summer. His dad had rented the convention center to throw the party and the building was so large Peter could barely see the other side but, somehow, it was packed. He knew everyone who worked in the Tower was invited and then some but…this was crazy.
“Why did you do it?” Steve asked, not meeting his eyes. “Yesterday was so nice. We spent all day together and nothing should have…should have triggered
“Nothing too weird…got it,” Tony replied, his eyes focused on Steve’s mouth. His gaze flickered up and he asked, “So…Can we start now?”
Steve’s fingers found their mark and Tony sat up sharper and squeaked, “Pep! Steve and I need a moment to let things sink in!”
Hulk leaps and catches the suit, Tony encased within, and when Tony comes to, Steve instantly thinks he knows no more beautiful color than the deep hue of brown that are Tony’s eyes.
Steve tumbled over the edge, overcome with ecstasy filling his every cell with joy. Tony followed seamlessly, emitting an absolutely criminal moan as he ground against Steve, trapping his hand between them to chase his release.
They lay there, panting heavily, for a few minutes before Steve could bring himself to lean back and slip out of Tony. He pushed out a harsh sigh as he zipped his pants back up and secured his belt, then crossed his legs loosely to sit on the unforgiving cement.
The government has a historical tendency toward nonsensical total destruction in the face of a powerful threat.
“I have been listening to the radio, so, I recognized a lot of what you played. It’s debatable whether that’s a good or a bad thing, but anyway, you could say I’m acclimating to this century.” Tony nods, and Steve continues. “This song, well, it reminds me of you. Of what you did today. And how invincible you are.”
“There was a time when I would agree with you. But not any longer can I humor such a despicable notion.”
Tony sees blood, hears a scream of agony, but it’s all happening too fast, his mind is still bleary from all he’s endured and he can’t track it all.
“Can you manage a walk?” the voice says, but it’s not really a question. How does he know that voice?
He knew the solution was to try harder, and be better for Tony. He knew to assuage his temper and vanquish the numbness filling his soul would require work to change and fix what was broken within himself. Only then could he hold all of the shattered pieces that comprised Tony with such immeasurable strength that they might begin to fuse into a warm, lopsided mass, imperfectly created, but at least finally whole again. He knew that’s what Tony deserved.
A quiet day in New York allowed for a lazy day in the tower for the Avengers. It started with snacks, then board games, then arguments over everyone’s favorite movies. Part way through another of Clint’s vehement suggestions, Tony slipped out of the common room. Steve glanced at the remaining members of the team, who didn’t seem to notice, and decided to excuse himself as well.
“Bruges wasn’t bad, Amsterdam, Krakow…even Chisinau had charm. But when you gotta keep up with these scattered leads, fast, and remain unnoticed...well,”
Then, he started seeing. He saw how Tony flaunted himself, dripping with words of self-praise. But when someone else complimented him, Steve saw Tony’s face. He didn’t react, no, not with his face. It was unwavering, as if he was listening to someone tell him different names for shades of taupe. But his eyes - his eyes responded. His eyelids would flutter without ever fully closing, and his pupils would dilate, expanding until his iris was nearly drowned in black.
Steve was learning Tony. He hadn’t seen the events up close, but he couldn’t ignore the telltale signs and unrelenting ripples that existed in the wake of trauma. ‘Battle shock,’ they had called it during the war. Most looked unfavorably upon soldiers who exhibited the symptoms. But Steve was different, and he tried to show compassion, even if he wasn’t perfect every time.
I regret it, I regret all of it. I know my views on the S.H.R.A. were right, but the way I went about it, I got it all wrong.
“Maybe a different genre, next?” he sighs. As much as he's beginning to enjoy how Tony challenges him, this is possibly a little too much of an immersion in the future for Steve right now.
,” he says regrettably. Formerly known as Captain America. He no longer dons the mantle, but still conceals his face with a dark cowl, as his former identity did. “So, is this a rescue, or is it not?”
Steve wasn’t entirely sure he was even ready to meet when Tony broached the subject, but also didn’t feel as if he had the right to decline. He actually didn’t have any rights at all. He fully expected their reunion to be overwhelming, and reality didn’t disappoint. Not that either of them was willing to acknowledge the fact.
“The SHIELD was plotting the return of the mantle, unbeknownst to me. But the world was under attack so suddenly, and before I knew of it, they said to you I was killed…” Tears start to well in his eyes, and all the anger Tony was holding melts instantly. Steve is a victim, just like him. “They spun you their web of lies before I was informed. Beat me to it, to ensure their lie would remain. When we fought alongside each other all those years, I wanted to divulge the truth with every fiber of my soul. But when you appeared content, on the surface, I witnessed your capacity to manage, and I thought I would be so selfish to take your life away from you. I believed that the lie was better for you, better for me, better for all.” Steve tilts his head back and closes his eyes. Tears run down his face, mixing with the remaining dried blood to turn to long, crimson streaks. “It was a mistake. I regretted it every day, even if I thought you were better off. I could never let you go.”
“...home.” It was almost a whisper, merely a soft exhale, and Steve couldn’t be sure Tony himself had heard what he breathed out.
Tony feigned a mild resistance to Steve’s firm grasp, and Steve couldn’t take this coy game any more. Wrapping an arm around the brunette’s waist, Steve pulled him close, and kissed deeply, tongue dancing along familiar territory. Tony sighed a contented response, subtly grinding his hips against Steve. Even through the thick material, Steve could feel Tony’s excitement. At this rate, Tony wasn’t going to last long - and neither was Steve.
Finding your soulmate was an elusive task, one that few people were able to accomplish with certainty. Steve was disappointed to learn that the mystery of soulmates and soulbonds were still as ambiguous as the day he was frozen, if not more so. Few people had successfully discovered their soulmates
Nightmares of the Chitauri flooded his mind. Now awake, he tries to ignore the residual memory, but it doesn’t work - he’s still shaky and feeling slightly tormented.
Tony headed back to the bar, ambiguously waved his fingers in a subtle gesture that procured two more glasses of club soda. He sipped the effervescence from one glass pensively, still wondering if he shouldn’t have just changed into the suit and taken off toward East 14th street to get to the bottom of this whole thing. Sure, it would risk having to cancel his evening with Steve, conjure excuses to explain Iron Man’s presence and Tony’s abrupt absence, but he thought it might be better to be sure Steve really didn’t need backup, or he’d be risking not having a Steve to enjoy an evening with at all.
He has to. Right? Let these adrenaline-addled thoughts disappear, hide them away, never to pursue it-
help. That’s why I do what I do. Iron Man and all. Help others, the hero gig. But, you know, I’ve never felt it this bad before.” While it was obvious that SHIELD was ill-equipped to handle this situation, when Tony insisted on intervening of course he hadn’t considered the effects of acclimating Steve to his new life to be so personally impactful. Even so, it didn’t deter him. “I wonder if the serum has something to do with it.”
I think about that too, about all that I would trade to have him back, or to even have a chance at having him back.
“It’s already been dismantled.” Her soft, numb, truthful reply was the icy steel blade sinking in, a quick burst of shock, then a burning emanated, filling his chest slowly, completely.
“Never mind,” Tony laughs, and Steve suspects some sort of reference has flown over his head, as he reaches up and grabs an alien off of a building wall.
“Alien invasion, Captain. I think the severity of the situation screams for some sweet songs to enhance the mood.” The armor shoots through the sky as the guitar fades away and something much more synthetic-sounding plays in Steve’s ear.
“Of course it did…” He couldn’t help but attempt to be soft, gentle, maybe that was what he needed to persuade him, to remind him of what he felt.
!” he cried, almost surprised by his own eagerness, as he lost the only layer concealing his excitement. The timid nervousness that had lived in his body mere hours ago was nowhere to be found now.
The captor begins to run, and even though Tony can’t be sure it’s not, he guesses this newest development is not a rescue. He gives his best effort to squirm and fight, yelling with all the air in his lungs, which turns out isn’t much, and now he’s fighting just to breathe as his diaphragm bounces off his captor’s shoulder.
Which is why when he finally entered Stark Tower and laid eyes on the beautiful brunette, it took almost a minute for his reeling brain to catch up with his body experiencing desperate kisses and a rapturous embrace. He finally registered the affection and reciprocated, accepting,
He felt movement - Tony had begun to roll his hips in an salacious manner, wrapping his legs firmly around an unencumbered waist.
Steve knew Tony hadn’t remembered anything from that night. Things fell back to normal. Tony still avoided him frequently, and they argued when he didn’t. Battle after battle, argument after argument, they continued to survive, but each time grew a little less stable, a little nearer to failure.
“But seriously, Steve, I think I can help you, if you’ll allow me the chance to try. I’d really like the chance to try.”
The gathering wasn’t huge, just the team, who had nothing better to do, at least according to Tony, who reminded them that as their landlord and benefactor he was aware of their schedules and this event was definitely of more excitement than anything else they had planned. No one had time to buy anything new, so they all wore their favorite outfits from over the years - Clint, a flannel shirt that still had all of its buttons, Bruce, a light-colored linen shirt with chinos that were freshly pressed, Natasha, a red bubble dress that she’d never had occasion to wear because it was too outstanding, and Thor, who excitedly wore clothes that were gifted to him from Rhodey who swore they were of the latest “midguardian” fashion, and comprised of a silver fish-scale sequin blazer with skin-tight leopard-print pants.
” he whispered, albeit gruffly, in Tony’s ear. He implored a few more requests before Tony sleepily grunted and sat up, zombie-like, to afford Steve the space to climb out from behind him.
- is covered in a trail of blood. His hair is matted and dirty and hanging over his left eye. He looks a bit weathered, but has the same youthful, spirited glow he always had.
“Let me show you.” Steve drew near enough to feel Tony’s bated breath against his skin. He reclaimed the glass, deliberately allowing their fingers to brush. Tony’s breath hitched, and it wasn’t without difficulty that Steve suppressed a smile.
Tony doesn’t hold back, and uses his body to inspire greater romance in Steve’s heart. He traces along the edges of where Steve’s armor meets his skin, and Steve responds by removing it skillfully, barely interrupting their escalating kisses. He feels Steve’s presumptuous hands roam under his shirt’s hem, exploring his chest reverently, until he demands its removal, as well as his pants soon after.
With a booming yell in the distance from Hulk, Steve takes it as resounding approval for Tony’s playlist.
Steve lets go of the hand he’s been holding to wrap his robust arms around and pull Tony the rest of the way into his lap.
They stayed like that, bodies pressed flush, skin sticky with sweat and come, for a while as they both came down from orgasm. With their foreheads pressed together, sharing one breath, Steve felt as though he could stay like this forever.
” He tried again, knowing as soon as the words spilled from his lips that it was a mistake. Tony’s tears finally began overflowing from the shallow dam.
You know I’ve faced loss. I’ve lost so many, and seen so much death. But this...it just doesn’t feel real. I keep thinking after I’ve served my time, I’ll walk out of this cell, and be greeted with one of his signature hugs, an impossibly tight embrace. I’ll get to look into those clear, azure eyes once again, and tell him all the things he never let me say before.
“Relax, sweetheart,” he coached. “That’s it, you’re perfect, you’re doing so good.” Tony was shaking, and Steve finally took his twitching cock in hand. “
Steve uselessly extended a hand to ground the brunet, but he had slipped out of reach. Tony had approached the raging fire in the corner of the lab. All Steve saw was a glint of metal in a modest crucible before pungent fumes ensnared him.
“You understand now? I never left you.” It was obvious, so obvious, and yet Steve had refused to see it. “No matter how you hurt me, I stayed for you, Steve. I’ve always celebrated today, knowing it was the anniversary of me opening my life to you. And it was the commemoration of a new future. At least, it was…”
He squeezed the brunette close and pressed a long kiss to his head, breathing in the familiar smell of Tony Stark. He summoned every molecule of courage remaining in his being and decided what he would dedicate himself to from that moment on. He wouldn’t forget this anniversary, not this time.
” His voice was distant, removed, he was lost, somewhere far away, held by a fleeting, false memory he should feel guilty for chasing, an experience that wasn’t his to have.
Tony’s furious. It’s all a game, he’s just a trophy, useless to all beyond the thrill of the hunt. “
He’s only just woke up alive in this century, and the one person he’s grown closest to, despite their frequent spats, is about to die.
When Tony offered to take Steve out for a night in New York, he hadn’t expected to be sitting alone at a bar throwing back club soda like there was no tomorrow. Forty-five minutes past their agreed-upon meeting time and there was still no sign of the Captain. Maybe it was Tony’s fault for assuming a nonagenarian would be punctual, but he was starting to feel like he’d been stood up.
Cars screeched to a stop, drivers honking wildly to express their disapproval. Steve tried to offer an apologetic wave, but the cars continued along their way once the two made it to the slim, center median.
“I’m sorry, Steve. But you do understand why this is so important, don’t you?” Something tugged at Steve’s brain, the genuine attempt the Widow was making to be gentle with her merciless request was not lost on the captain. As quickly as he was distracted by the fleeting warmth, his mind fell to the perfect circle embracing his third digit.
? You had remembered him before remembering your name, last time. He was your best friend. You loved him like a brother…he was the one you and the Red Skull attacked, the one the Red Skull took away.”
The world and its people became more undefined as time went by and he could feel sleep wrapping itself around Steve. He fought it valiantly. He held onto Tony and used him as his anchor. Bucky eventually disappeared but Tony remained at his side. Steve whispered to him, begging him to stay with him.
With various knots, he had turned the old jumpsuit into a bag he could kept slung across his back and tied to him with a square-knot across his chest.
“Jarvis already gave me their address. I just don’t know how I am going to explain this all to them…” Steve said. He faced the polar bear too and adjusted Peter in his arms so his son could keep watching the bear as it swam.
It was a new day now but Peter had been actively ignoring what happened yesterday. Yet, with Steve here now, he could no longer pretend last night was nothing of consequence. He cleared his throat and asked, “What are you doing here?”
Tony icily stated, “This feeling won’t just leave if you find a solution for separating Peter from Venom. And, if you betray us, the guilt would exponentially worsen. Still, guilt is a tricky thing. It lingers and festers. Even when a wrong is righted it does not disappear.”
“I’d be insulted if you didn’t ask!” Tony replied. “I’m suiting up! Bet you 100 bucks I find him first!”
Once again, Steve did not understand what she meant. Why wouldn’t she want Tony to be gay? If he is a happy person that would be a good thing wouldn’t it? And what was a bisexual? Did he hear her correctly?
“To make you vomit maybe,” she replied. “I will suffer the headache and nausea for another hour or so. You, on the other hand, shall enjoy being sick the rest of the day.”
Tony scrambled up a few more steps but Steve met him halfway and practically scooped Tony up into his warm embrace and Tony’s arms snapped around his back. The air was pushed out of Tony’s lungs from the impact and his heart shot up into his throat at feel of his solid,
At one point, when Peter paused in his work to get a water bottle from the fridge where everyone kept their food (safely separated from all the other fridges in the room holding scientific samples or chemicals), he noticed Wade sent him a video message, Peter glanced at Eddie, working on the other side of the lab, and then opened it with the volume low.
Fury signaled to one of the agents behind him and she came running forward with an oddly shaped duffel bag.
It was all he could do now, extort promises from his soulmate…it was so pointless. It would make no difference in the long run.
Steve wrapped his arm around Bucky blindly and gasped, "Shut up, jerk. Shut up and let me hold you."
“It is still safer,” Bucky argued and then opened up a few holograms around him. Tony saw he already figured out how to save files and was already compiling his research. One of the files contained an image of Bucky and Steve and Tony looked away sharply as his heart burned sharply.
And then there was little Wade again. Peter had been expecting to feel Wade's arousal as soon as they pressed together so intimately. He was ready for it this time. He could tell Wade was hardening and Peter would be remiss to admit it, but he was turned on as well. Peter tested the waters and moved his hips against Wade’s. Wade inhaled sharply but rutted against Peter in response.
“But Peter’s life is on the fucking line, isn’t it?” Brock gasped, sounding like he was seconds from hyperventilating.
Once they realized Natasha was going to keep her word and SHIELD wasn’t coming for Steve, they relaxed.
Bruce silently listened too but seemed so tired it looked like an effort to eat nonetheless speak. By the look of the bags underneath his eyes and his worn expression, he had probably pulled an all-nighter. He ate his pancakes with blackberry syrup.
“I just realized that I may love Bucky but I am not in love with him,” Steve whispered, running his hands through Tony’s hair. “My heart is totally yours, Tony. I needed you to know that. This is more than me just choosing you over him. I love you and can’t imagine being with anyone else but you.”
Bruce was near salivating as he stared at the medical files pertaining to Steven G. Rogers pre- and after-serum. He gasped, “Y-Yes, please, do it!”
Before Tony fully committed to the existential crisis that was about to overcome him, he had to confirm: “My father is alive in the future? In 2009?”
“Pep, you’re not making sense,” Tony argued. “You aren't at fault! You're perfect! I'm the damaged one!”
Clint sat up and said, “Jarvis, pause the show.” To them he said, “Bruce! Steve! Hey, what’s up? Who’s the kid?”
Peter kept screaming his name as if Steve had the strength to defeat this shadow monster. Steve was his father, he was Captain America the Super Soldier. Steve was undefeatable in Peter’s mind and he expected Steve to save him.
were asleep. He passed a few of the watchmen and nodded to them in passing until he finally got back to his room.
Eddie walked across the room to the opposite wall that was purely a window. He looked down and stated, “They all look so small down there…”
Coulson nodded curtly and got on his phone. He continued to scroll through the list of names Tony gave him with a grim expression.
Steve did not last long under Tony’s roving tongue and after he came, he switched places with Tony and went down on him.
The next day, Tony acted like the confrontation never happened. He was laughing and asking about the Red Skull and just wanted to play like he always did.
“Didn’t really notice it until…well, a couple of weeks after arriving here in the past,” Tony murmured. “It wasn’t this bad when we left the Hydra base. I haven’t been able to really look at it because it…well, as you can see my reactor's a little bright so even in the privacy of my tent I couldn’t look at it without someone noticing…”
Leaning into Wade, Peter started his tale about the guy who tried picking him up with the cheesiest one liners and won him over.
The stress was getting to him. Tony was so frantic with worry and had barely slept or ate. His clothes hung off him loosely and, the last time he saw Pepper with their food supplies, she looked at him like she saw a ghost. Hell, he felt like he was dying.
They went to her lab, like she wanted, but both of them were tense. By the way Tony’s jaw was set, Steve could tell he was gearing up for a confrontation. They tried to look in on her in the lab but the firewall was still blocking Jarvis. They had no idea how Mary had taken her talk with Ben after he left and it was nerve-racking.
Tony nodded sadly, his lips trembling as he whispered, “He followed you and somehow his help made it so all of you lived, him, you, and the Red Skull…and you know what happens from there…”
He rushed the larger man and then pushed him out of the locker room, practically tripping over his feet as he whined, “But they’re so sexy, Petey!”
Steve was tempted to jump to his feet and embrace them both but he did not act on the impulse. This was Tony’s moment with Peter. His son had never fallen asleep in Tony’s arms before and Tony’s excitement was incredible.
Tony narrowed his eyes at him and grumbled, “…You sorta came back to life without any warning. Finding you was more of a priority than getting lube.”
She dropped her head and heaved shallowly. The world was spinning around her and her heart was becoming heavier with every beat.
Bruce nodded and he and Steve left the room before Peter could babble an excuse to join them. An awkward silence grew in the room as soon as they were gone. Peter looked anywhere but at Tony.
The title of the story is from “The Boys of Summer” by Don Henley...or the cover by the Ataris. The version it’s based on varies upon which era you listen to it in! ;)
“Fuck,” Tony groaned, tucking his head against Steve’s neck and dropping his arm across his chest as he snuggled in. “That was good.”
They eventually went out and did small things like take a drive in one of Tony’s fast cars or Tony took him out to try the new foods that came out since he’d been frozen.
As he questioned, he discovered their flag was Russia’s new flag. The Soviet Union was no more. The Allies had won World War II but there had been more wars since then and the Americans were currently involved in a war with the Middle East.  And then, to hear of the devastation that hit New York,
“I can talk to her,” Steve offered. Maybe Natasha did not know Bucky fought for them. Maybe she was angry because she thought Bucky had abandoned her.
Elbow deep in his Iron Man suit, Tony expected to be busy in his lab for the rest of the day. His music was playing on shuffle and he was humming along nonsensically with the tunes and randomly tapping his foot with the base beats.
Finally, Tony replied in a breathless gasp, “Yes, yes, yes! Do I have to sign something to make this official? Someone give me a pen!”
Soul implants were sometimes compared to radios. You need two compatible units in order for them to work. Until the implant is able to make a connection with a compatible unit, it would remain zeroed as it searched.
Steve had sighed heavily, pulled Tony off the dance floor, and led him to a secluded corner. He pushed Tony against the wall and pushed his body into Tony’s. Tony, who had been talking about his green slime plan as Steve dragged him away, suddenly shut up.
“Any science! My brain is too frazzled to work in my workshop but not doing anything constructive is making me insane,” Tony moaned.
“Who my father is doesn’t change me, Eddie,” Peter retorted, speaking louder so everyone heard him. The whispers came to an immediate stop as everyone turned to look at him. He put down his reports and faced the rest of the lab, stating, “I’m still the same person. I’m still Peter.”
Peter was sitting in his high chair, his face covered in his favorite pumpkin purée and Cheerios combo. Steve was sitting next to him at the counter, watching the small boy with a smile as he sipped his coffee.
“You could have just asked me all of this instead of barging in here and attacking us!” Stark practically yelled.
This alone was an absolute nightmare, he could not imagine the amount of added stress if Tony found out Steve used his image to masturbate to as well.
“Alright…And speaking of Stark. He’s been too quiet. Romanov is good but she doesn’t have an in inside the Tower anymore. If you have time, poke your head in on him. Stark and quiet are a deadly combination.”
Peter quickly schooled his features and joked, “I know, super lame, but he was invited too and I haven’t seen him at all!”
He heard the floorboards squeak the floor below as May moved around and he heard the soft murmur of her voice. Peter backed to his wall, as far away from his bedroom door as possible, to keep May as safe as he could.
“How about you fucking tell us where Steve is?!” Stark exploded as he separated the distance between himself and the Soldier in large strides. The man looked half mad by the fact that his soulmate was missing.
Tony insisted on babying him and had dried him off, helped dressed him, and reapplied his new bandages. Tony only covered the burns on Steve’s face despite wanting to wrap his hands as well. Steve’s flesh on his hands was no longer exposed so he saw no need for the protective dressings. Once his wounds were bound, Tony leaned forward lightly kissed his bandaged forehead.
to hold your hand right now. I wish I could hold your hand but…all I can do, is this…” He lightly angled his foot to rub against Steve's ankle. He planted his foot on the ground beside Steve's but it remained pressed into his and his warmth sunk into Steve's body.
Thank you for your comments, concerns, and true feelings on the matter. I take them to heart and they help mold my writing. The first chapter to Part 3 will posted in a few days and I hope everyone enjoys it just as much as the rest of the series...
“Perfecttttt,” Tony groaned. He was sitting on top of Steve with his prick inside him. He'd just found his prostate and Tony was in nirvana.
Tony woke to Steve pushing himself up. Tony blinked away the blur and met Steve’s gaze. Steve grinned sheepishly at him and whispered, “I didn’t mean to wake you up.”
He tucked the papers under his arm and lifted his huge duffel bag, his shield shifting slightly inside as he did. He explained, “I need to change. Do you have somewhere I can do that?”
Around him, the Avengers held off the rest of the perpetrators, leaving them to spar only themselves. Not long after Thor dropped Peter off at Oscorp Tower, SHIELD joined the fight and the rest of the combatants were rounded up quickly with the exception of the Goblin.
Peter was the first to stroll out to the training mats and came to a stop when he saw Clint testing out the strings on one of his arrows by his practice targets.
Howard’s eyes widened with understanding and then he whispered, “That explains the scars then…” Howard’s eyes focused on the light in Tony’s chest and whispered, “Ingenious…”
As I stated before, Steve and Tony will end up together but Steve needs to hash out what these news feelings. Yes, there is going to be hurt on all sides, yes there is going to be betrayal, and yes there is going to be soooo much angst BUT it needs to be done, otherwise years down the line Steve will think "What if..." and I don't want that.
“Just giving an example,” Tony retorted. He let go of Steve’s hand and said, “I’m going to be more touchy-feely to make our relationship more believable later…unless you keep jerking about like I’m shocking you with electrodes…”
, Steve thought sadly. Instead of saying it aloud he simply smiled sadly at Peter and let him read it however he would.
“My mate was the reason I deflected to SHIELD in the first place. Our masters had killed him when he refused to fight for them anymore,” Natasha replied in a small voice. She was still leaning into his side so he could not see her face as she informed him, “SHIELD doesn’t want anyone to know he existed. He was Russia’s ‘Winter Soldier’ and he was a super soldier like you.”
Peter snorted again as the suit melted off him and pooled into the can. He was wearing the same clothes as before underneath minus his shoes. Once the dark mass was off him, he dropped the now full trashcan on Wade’s desk and walked back over to him.
Steve watched him until he ran out and then turned back to Bucky. His eyes were open by tiny little slits and Steve winced. He asked, “How much did you hear?”
Eventually, they formed a plan and called it a night. The base had separate rooms and Steve and Tony gravitated to one together without question.
The media was not all bad. When patrolling the internet, Tony was glad to see the photos originally taken of Tony and Steve during Steve’s panic attack were lost in the hundreds more that were born from their outings and from the ones they posted personally. In all of these new pictures, they looked happy and so in love and Tony adored it.
Steve clutched his chest as he remembered the promise he made to Tony about never leaving him for Bucky. It was now tainted by a newfound regret for making it.
Whenever Tony bought his dates some fancy jewelry, many times they’d tell him they felt ‘touched’ by the gesture. It had all been empty conjecture but…at that moment, Tony felt the true meaning behind the metaphor. He felt his heart palpitate from the feeling.
“This boy is not Dr. Banner’s son, sir,” Steve gasped. He cautiously raised his hands, his right side throbbed as he lifted the bullet ridden limb. He pushed himself up to his knees with his arms still held up in compliance. “He is
Before Steve sound formulate a reply, Venom lashed out and hit Tony with one of its tendrils. Tony went flying across the room but Thor jumped into his path and caught him before the already injured man could be hurt more.
From there, the rest of the morning was spent similarly as the morning of the preliminary hearing. Everyone was quiet at breakfast, the team came with Steve as a show of support and they drove to the courthouse together, the protestors and media were barricaded outside the courthouse, and they had to go through their chaos again.
They did it. They came out. He had been waiting for this day for so long…it felt like a burden had been lifted from his shoulders and without it he felt like he could fly.
“I’m here, Peter,” Steve gasped frantically. It was up to his son’s chest but did not seem to restrict his son’s rapid breathing. “We’re going to get you out of this!” Steve raised one hand to his ear piece and screamed into his communicator, “TONY GET DOWN HERE NOW!”
Tony leapt to his feet, clutching Peter’s tiny toy to his chest. He swayed as he was still drunk but his eyes were steady. Tony commanded, “Jarvis, run a scan on her. Make sure it really is her and she is not armed.”
Tony widened the viewing screen of their living room just as Peter entered the picture and, not a moment later, Steve was at his side.
Steve fell onto Tony with a light huff of a laugh but then pressed his elbows into the pillows on either side of Tony’s head and lowered his kiss more gently upon him.
Mary looked just as she did in all the photos Ben had of her and the more recent recordings Tony had managed to get from Oscorp.
Bucky rubbed the blood off his lips and stated, “No, I want to…She smiled at me. It was little but-but I want this. I want her.” His small rueful smile grew wider and when he looked up at Steve he saw no trace of the solemn Winter Soldier in his excited gaze. All he saw was the Bucky he had grown up with, the one who loved a challenge and had a laugh always on the edge of his voice. He grinned excitedly at them, his lips splitting open a little more, and said, “I was not so sure about this at first but for the first time in a long, long time I know now what I want. I’m going to fight for her. I want what we had before and I’m willing to do whatever it takes to get her back, – even listening to the mad scientist’s hair brained ideas!”
“Alright,” Steve said. Steve went straight to the fridge and opened the door. The refrigerator was sparsely filled compared to the one on the community floor but he still had more than enough for Steve and Peter to snack on. He grabbed the apple sauce and sat Peter on the counter.
Unsurprisingly, Fury ignored him and was gone in seconds. Leaving Tony, Bucky, and Agent Romanoff alone, like the entire area hadn’t been swarming with SHIELD agents a moment ago.
No more dark thoughts of Tony invaded his mind and his body was able to relax as it went through the familiar exertions of fighting.
Natasha grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and dragged him back into the room. Clint muffled a snicker as she hauled him past the TV and to the door Clint had entered. Tony pushed at her hold but the woman was too strong for him.
As if he could hear his crushing thoughts, Tony suddenly encased him in a tight hug. Steve flinched then slowly wrapped his arms around his torso and pressed his face into Tony’s chest. The arc reactor bit into his cheek and its warm glow heated his flesh.
Before Iron Man could answer, a large flying craft suddenly fell from the sky and hovered over the roof. A hatch opened and a sharp suited man stepped out. The man’s eyes instantly focused on Steve and he answered the question Steve had just asked, “Hello, Captain Rogers, and, to answer your question, SHIELD is the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division for the United States’ Government.”
He waved his hands around the phone, looking for the invisible wire that connected the phone to the phone box that wasn't there.
“We should have taken a less noticeable car if we were going to do reconnaissance,” Steve sighed and stepped out of the car. Tony also got out and waited for him to round the car and stepped beside him, matching Steve’s stride with his own. When they were close enough, Steve saw recognition filter through Ben Parker’s features. Steve did not know who he recognized, Steve, Tony, or both of them.
“Miss, I don’t know if you’re a reporter or a wannabe detective but you are not the one barking out the orders,” the officer retorted.
Despite knowing it was a dream, he checked Tony over as he lay next to him. Tony silently watched him with tired eyes as Steve lightly ran his hands over him. He eventually grasped Steve’s hand halting his worried checkup.
The doors opened to reveal Tony, and all other thoughts he had disappeared when he saw his friend. They both moved together and met each other half way in an embrace.
Tony frowned at the flush. What was going through Steve’s mind? Tony tried not to openly stare but he stared at him from the corner of his eye. Steve’s flush may have revealed his discomfort but Tony reluctantly admitted to himself that he liked the way it looked on his friend’s pale skin and it made his eyes appear bluer.
Steve’s shield came flying out of nowhere and ripped through all of the metal arms before he could finish his boasting speech.
“Yes…” Steve responded slowly, his eyes shifted uneasily between the two of them. Tony was also eyeing Peter strangely.
“Hey, Cap, thanks for keeping Tony some company,” Howard said, stepping beside Steve where he had sat himself on the edge of the cot.
Wade looked crushed and scared. Vision stepped forward and volunteered, “I can go. If it tries to attack me, I’ll simply change my body’s density so it will not touch me.”
“Why couldn’t you give him a chance?” Steve demanded. “Don’t you see the way he looks at Peter? He adores him! This isn’t the same man we saw senselessly brandishing his katanas on the streets!”
Tony’s arm was literally wrenched out of its socket. He heard it pop out and then he was paralyzed with pain as it flopped around as he tumbled across the roof. When he and Steven finally rolled to a stop, his arm bent awkwardly behind him. He sat up and shouted out in pain as the arm fell back to his side. He carefully lay his arm across his stomach and then locked the joints in the suit’s arm to keep it from moving anymore. It definitely was dislocated and might have even been broken.
“Don’t let her go online until you’re done talking to her then,” Peter’s father grumbled right back. He sighed heavily and said, “We need to get more eyes out there, Wade…”
“Oh, God,” Wade gasped. His arms shook and he shakily lowered himself to lay completely down on Peter. He pressed his forehead against Peter’s and he breathlessly asked, “D-Did I do that to you?”
They broke apart with happy smiles and Steve cupped his new husband’s jaw. Tony mouthed the words “love you” to him and Steve loved him so much in that moment that he had to bend down and kiss him again.
Steve’s shoulders dropped. He knew this conversation would come one day. He just wished Peter was a little older to better understand. He whispered, “Everyone gets hurt, including me. Because I am a superhero I am going to get hurt a lot…Everyone on the Avengers will…”
“Distracted by the fact that tall, blond, and muscles isn’t here?” Pepper easily guessed. Pepper knew about his current relationship with Steve and helped keep their secret. She was one of the first people they officially told. The others were their teammates but they pretty much already knew thanks to Steve kissing Tony in front of most of them after he fell out of the vortex. And lastly, they told Fury, just so SHIELD knew and wouldn’t try to use it against them.
“Papa!” Peter exclaimed when he came into the room. He took in his uniform then gasped, “Did shu save dat-tha world?”
Wade dropped his head, wishing he had his mask. It was somewhere in Peter’s room but he couldn’t leave Peter to retrieve it.
They tried several places but only once Steve slid the notebook between the books did the picture begin to change back.
Tony squeezed his ass then trailed a single hand up Steve’s side and caressed the side of his face to whisper, “Steve, my husband, love of my life, Captain of my heart, peas to my carrots, from now on, today and every day is going to be about us.”
They took him to the Tower as it was his home and he desperately wanted to see Tony but it was there the public was waiting for him. There was a stage set up and everything. Steve was supposed to go up there and introduce himself to the world.
Before Peter could say anything, Tony quickly stepped outside. A little glimmer of hope flickered inside him, praying Peter would call and the next time they saw each other, his eyes wouldn't be filled with hate. It was a ginormous wish and Tony felt stupid for thinking it. The situation couldn't be worse.
“It’s a yes or no, Deadpool,” Fury grumbled. “By everyone’s indirect answers I can tell that’s a ‘yes’ and I’m talking to a younger Cap and Iron Man. What year are you two from?”
Tony gulped and looked up at Steve. His blue eyes were clouded with concern and his touch was tender and loving. Tony felt his eyes prickle at his loss. Why did he keep him at such a distance? Why did he let this happen? Tony gulped deeply and whispered, “We need to end this. No more fuck buddies. J-Just friends. Okay?”
Wade leaned forward and lightly kissed the side of his neck. He murmured, “I think your bedhead is now one of my kinks.”
“I want to woo you by the moonlight,” Tony retorted and Steve chuckled. Grinning, Tony stated, “We did pretty well last night under the stars…”
Last night, Steve remembered, right before they went to sleep, Tony had put Jarvis into silent mode in order for them to sleep in. Yet, he still did not connect what Jarvis’s silent mode had do do with Natasha’s words.
Tony grinned wickedly at his hardened member and stated, "I don't think I'll need the towel for this."
“If you ever need me,” Bucky whispered, turning his head slightly so that Steve could almost make out the side of his face’s profile. “Hang a red cloth from the western point of the Tower and I will come.”
Natasha shivered. She’d never say such words aloud out of fear for her own life. The Academy did not take such thoughts lightly.
Steve nodded and bit down on his tongue to not give away any emotion to Bruce. He murmured, “Thank you,” and left.
. I only regret not knowing you thought this way…Everything you just said, I do not see that when I look at you. I’ve never see it that way.
Tony shook his head and felt like he was breaking from the inside all over again. He wetly gasped, “I’m so stupid…”
They broke their kiss, gasping for breath, and, just as it was caught, they both dived back in and smothered each other with another.
As soon as he heard the alarm, Tony dropped the zucchini and raced to his lab and jumped in his suit. Once inside, he demanded, “What happened?!”
Bucky nodded again and flexed his new fingers. He murmured, “It…It almost reminds me of…my old arm…from before.”
Steve looked up and saw Bruce looking up at him from his microscope. Bruce’s brows were bunched together and he asked, “Are you okay?”
“Yessssssss,” Tony droned staring at his hand in Steve’s grasp. All the good humor had escaped Tony and it seemed as if he was struggling to function.
Tony clutched his chest with a pained expression and with his other hand he grasped Steve’s hand tightly. Steve almost pulled away, but Tony’s face pinched with absolute despair and he sobbed, “You…God, Steve, you’re not going to have to live long with it…”
,” Peter quickly receded, realizing how bad that must have sounded so soon after their spat. “I…I want to tell you about my dad and how I met him only a couple of years ago and how…turbulent our relationship was at first…I just want you to understand our relationship and why what happened tonight was so much more worse than it seems…I don’t ever want a repeat of this so…we need to talk.”
Breakfast was all but forgotten as Tony stared up at Steve. He slowly yet deliberately kissed Steve’s stomach, somewhere around his mate’s bellybutton if he was guessing correctly.
“Off?? Steve doesn’t do off, he has the serum!” Peggy retorted. She worriedly touched his forehead and whispered, “What’s wrong Steve? How can I help?”
He returned to the engine, but his heart wasn’t in it. He didn’t even attempt to fiddle with it. It upset him to know Steve was still hurting. He so badly wanted to know more but he knew if he pressed the issue, Peggy would press him for more information.
“Why are you doing that, Cap?” Tony asked. Steve and Bruce turned to see Tony exiting the second elevator. He must have just overheard Steve’s last comment.
With a smirk, she selected Clint’s number instead and slipped the phone back into her pocket as her Bluetooth began to ring in her ear. Clint picked up on the first ring.
Yes, that confirmed it. He laughed at the loverboy reference yesterday. Something definitely happened.
Tony sighed happily and murmured, “I’m already counting down the days to crystal clear waters and white sand beaches…”
Steve had to swallow down his exclamation of joy. He was alive! He was alive and in the same era as his soulmate!! Barely, holding back his smile, Steve asked, “Where can I find Tony Stark’s Tower?”
“If the time traveler from the future wants to try it, I don’t see the problem,” Bucky retorted. Bucky looked forward, at nothing in particular as he stated, “I think you should go for it…You’re lonely, Steve. You’re so lonely sometimes it breaks my heart just to look at you.”
The shower washed his come away and Steve watched its progression into the drain with a deepening blush.
Peter had purposely climbed up the living room ceiling in his family’s penthouse and sat at the highest point, two stories above the floor. Below him, his uncle stood, glaring up at him with his flesh and metal arms crossed over his chest.
Downstairs, he heard his Aunt May open the door and a person say, “Hello, May Parker? Is it true your nephew, Peter Parker, is the illegitimate son of Tony Stark?”
Steve reached over the board and ran his hand over Tony’s soft hair. He smiled warmly at the boy in front of him and Tony returned the smile.
The seating was tight and once everyone was piled in Steve was pressed in on each side. He pressed his arms onto either side of himself so his neighbors would feel his biceps instead the edge of his shield. Dr. Kaswani was one of his neighbors and the last in.
Bucky knelt in front of the door and pulled two metal picks from his pocket. He jimmied the lock in under a minute, staying silent the entire time, refusing to reply to Steve.
Steve touched the screen, running his fingertips over the image of Tony’s jaw and swore to himself that they would succeed.
Tony promised the Mark III, “You’re never going to have the Stark name attached to you. But I need to come up with a name for people to call me while I’m in this...because Mark III just won’t do…” He looked back up to the face shield and asked the inert armor, “What do you think?” He grinned as only one superhero reference came to mind. Remembering his days playing Howling Commandos as a child, he butchered Cap’s title and suggested, “Captain Metal?” He chuckled to himself, it sounded more like a poorly named metal rock band. “Or maybe Captain Arc Reactor…”
“You start training with me this Monday, kid,” Natasha stated. Peter gushed over the prospect excitedly and Steve fearfully wondered what kind of training the former assassin had for his son.
The arc reactor bit into the skin of Steve’s chest and vibrated with power keeping Tony alive. They both were breathing heavily with their chests heaving against each other.
“Yup,” Peter said, forcing himself not to sigh heavily. He was probably going to be answering this question a lot in the coming weeks.
Steve sighed lightly and secured his arms around Tony. He whispered, “Before I tell you, you have to promise that you will not think the worst nor worry. You are very protective of Peter but he’s an adult now and makes his own choices.”
Steve jerked then scrambled out of bed. Tony quickly followed and the floor on his bedside opened up and the Iron Man uniform rose to meet him.
Wade chuckled and pulled him on top of his chest and fell back into the bed with Peter laying on top of him.  Wade's heart thudded gently against one of his arms and Wade ran his fingers through Peter's hair. It was relaxing and Peter felt his eyes begin to droop again until Wade asked, “But are you sure?”
is to leave the premises.” He turned to Tony and said, “Stark, you are not to leave my side and you are not allowed to touch
Steve leaned into Bucky’s side, staring sadly at his implant, and sighed, “Then we could settle down in the same townhouse and be neighbors. Our kids could grow up together.”
The stranger jumped to his feet and grabbed Tony’s face shield with a metal hand and ripped it off as if it were made of paper. Tony cursed and the sound of his voice, now clear without Iron Man’s speakers and protection, sent shivers down Steve’s spine.
“Don't worry, you look cute in all of them and, well…You can come to my place if you want?” Wade suggested.
“When you were unconscious, we unlocked all the SHIELD files on our databases and released them to the public…including the Hydra files. He was in there…He’s really Barnes.”
Steve sighed and looked out to the partitions again. Beyond the barriers was a horde of people come just for them and the fake relationship they held. It was astounding what would draw people to them. Throughout the modern world there was still famine, genocide, and intolerant practices but the strongest country on the planet cared more about their love lives than the more serious issues. It was both amazing and horrifying. Steve quietly repeated Tony’s words, mumbling, “Here we are…”
Bucky sat him down on a piece of rubble that resembled a bench and fussed over Steve and his arm, making sure he was fine. Steve shook his head and assured his friend he was alright.
Peter and Wade were cuddling on his bed, watching an old eighties movie when his dad finally came to collect them for the party. They knew he’d be coming soon so had redressed and hid any evidence of their lovemaking.
