But like all things, their lucky streak had to come to an end.
The building Tony worked in was bigger and shinier than anything else around Midtown. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of windows sparkled in the light against the light brown of the brick building surface. An endless stream of well pressed suits ran in and out of the revolving front entrance doors. Everyone seemed in such a rush, it scared Steve to think that Tony worked with all this. They looked so professional, so much unlike him. Maybe he should have changed his clothes before coming here. There was a hand-me-down brow suit in their closet. Might be a bit small in the shoulder, but anything would be better than a rubble encrusted jacket and un-pressed slacks.
Tony scooted over to Steve’s side as the engine sprang to life. “Don’t worry Steve. Everything will be okay. I promise,” assured Tony, giving a gentle squeeze to Steve’s shoulder. Steve didn’t seem to notice. He just somberly watched each shallow breath that Bucky Barnes took as they rolled down the road.
Steve groaned in frustration. “Bucky, stand down,” he called in clear exasperation. “You saw him the other day. He's harmless. He's an engineer for crying out loud. Not like he'd have a reason to have it out for us.”
His body had been doing that a lot lately, feeling things for people he had only just met. But Steve was different and it bothered him. Like a twitch in his leg that he just couldn’t shake off. Tony needed Steve like he needed air to breathe. Not that it was a bad thing. Steve was very attractive. His blue eyes were mesmerizing, his smile, absolutely dazzling. The very firm muscles under a too tight shirt were an instant plus. But there was something more to him. This wasn’t just lust. Tony’s interest in Steve went beyond skin deep, and that bothered him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve could physically see Tony skid to a stop when he broke through Tony’s train of thought. Was he shaking? God, what had Tony been through to react like this? It was only an apology for a silly little thing. Well, it wasn’t silly to Steve, but that didn’t matter at the moment. What mattered was Tony, and Tony was in pain right now.
“I’ve got all these ideas running around in my head, but technology is not far enough along to accommodate me, and my hands aren’t nearly fast enough to accurately write down everything that goes on up there. Do you even understand what that’s like Obie? To want to create something only to realize you don’t have the tech to go from point A to point B? It’s aggravating! I have all the resources I could ever what, unlimited funding, but no matter what I try, I don’t have what I need to get this thing up to 500 horsepower without burning out!” he emphasized throwing a wrench against the wall.
“Lots of things,” Steve said, the words coming out slower than normal as the pencil moved expertly across the white page. “Mostly shapes and angles when I start out. A little bit about muscles and skeletal structures, and there’s a lot of looking up and down so I can draw the reference image right.”
And this was the part Tony was dreading. “Hey, don’t beat yourself up too much. He’s been through a lot.”
“Listen,” Tony started. But he didn’t finish.
“I think the better question would be what didn’t we hear.” The amused lit in Pepper’s voice translated over the radio clear as day.
“Hi,” the captain said.
The joy on Jan’s face disappeared. Her shoulders slumped down as the excited energy drained from her body. “I’m sorry Tony. It’s just… I forget sometimes. We’ve been with each other so long, I forget that not everyone is like us.”
Bruce sighed. “Well then, tell them to take some painkillers and call me in the morning if it continues to hurt.”
“Because Jarvis is a man, not a woman,” said Steve as he poured a bit of batter into a hot pan. “Just because a man has feminine like qualities, doesn’t mean it’s okay to go around comparing him to a woman. It’s okay for men to do things like cook and clean just like it’s okay for a woman to fight or shoot a gun.”
Thanks go to kuailong for the beta. Her edits made all the difference.
Tony placed his hand on Steve’s knee. “Steve, He will make it. I promise you, he will.”
With careful strokes, he carved Tony into the paper. The strong length of his back. The slant of his shoulders. The soft curves of his arms. He noted the slow passing of the sun as it made the shadows longer and Tony’s profile more pronounced. The 4:45 shadows were perfect for Tony’s shape, and Steve deliberately went a little fast with the outline. He could always go back and fill it in later. He usually did. As long as he got the aura of his model, his drawings turned out to his liking. And at exactly 4:45, Tony’s aura shone like a beacon in a moonless night.
Steve ducked under a few low hanging beams and carefully began his inspection of the cargo bay. It was the only place Tony could have snuck away to without running into anybody.
“He’s an embarrassment.”
The bullets stopped.
“I… um…” the man stammered as he wrung his hands like a towel. “Well, the thing is… I was wondering… if youcouldteachmehowtomakedonuts.”
“Nothing,” Tony said sharply. “Just doodles and lines. Nothing as interesting as what you drew.”
Every time he heard Tony laugh; Steve’s entire face felt like it was on fire. He’d anxiously watch smoke rise up from the smithery and would spend hours listening for the sound of a hammer on an anvil as it echoed across the valley. And whenever his father or brother came home from a sacking, weapons dulled and armor dented, Steve immediately gathered their things up and ran down to the forge, happy to have an excuse to talk to the blacksmith’s son.
“Doesn’t matter. I’m Captain America’s wife. That’s good enough for me,” sang Tony.
“Yeah,” said Steve with hesitation in his voice. There was a flash of something complicated on Steve’s face, but in the blink of an eye the emotion was gone. Tony was okay with that. He could wait until Steve was ready. Trust took time. Tony held his own secrets close to his heart (Rhodey might even say ‘literally’ close to his heart) but Tony understood. Maybe, one day, they could be in a place where they could be honest with each other. Maybe after Tony was out of the mafia business. He didn’t think Steve would approve of that.
They stood in awkward silence for a moment, both not quite knowing what to do or what to say next. Steve tried to remember why he was there. It was definitely was not so he could swim in those dark chocolate eyes after two long weeks of distant phone conversations.
“And if I don’t believe you?” he asked, crossing his arms.
“Who else?” asked Tony.
As soon as Tony felt relaxed in his banter, everything went to shit. The sound of metal scraping against metal sent shivers down Tony’s spine. The regular rattle of garage panes being rolled up late at night was never a good sign.
Grunting in frustration, Tony dashed for safety as Rescue provided cover.
Iron Family. Steve committed the dreadful name to memory. "Anyone got intel on that name?"
“One lucky shot!” yelled Tony. “It took one lucky shot to knock him down and that’s exactly all it will take for you to wind up dead. I refuse to take that risk.”
“Let’s not think about it now, husband-to-be of mine,” Steve said, sneaking his arms around Tony’s waist. “We’re still on vacation and the ‘no tech’ rule is still in effect. Let’s just relax and enjoy our first night as fiancés. It’s only going to get crazier from here.”
Sam's mouth twitched downward. Definitely a "no" then.
“Steve!” he called into the crowd. Why did everyone have to be taller than him? Short was great for working under cars, but crap when looking for someone in a crowd.
“Nope,” said Steve with a smug smile as he popped the last syllable.
Apparently, this man.
Just as their lips were about to touch, a loud noise broke through the tension. Tony whipped around to the service window just in time to see at least five heads duck down and out of sight.
“No, I don’t. And I imagine,” said Tony, whispering sweet words into Steve’s ear, “you’d really like to get a few whacks in as payback.”
“Oh! So we’re making it my fault that all this is crashing down around our ears?” asked very pissed off Pepper.
Tony’s fingers stopped moving. “Does it matter?” He tried to sound as emotionally removed as possible.
"I hate to break up your lovely get together,” Sam said, stepping forward from the congregated group. “But we've got deliveries to make and I want to snag this new guy before Steve insists on doing the run on his own."
Steve hummed. “Never thought about it before. Always thought I’d die from sickness or from the war before I ever got hitched. If I did think about it, I always thought it’d be quick. Need to be. Didn’t want my partner to have time to second guess themselves before hitching themselves to a mistake like me.”
Tony scrubbed his face and tried not to scream. “
“Couple hours ago,” Tony said with a smirk. “My place isnt as bad as your though.” He scooted closer to Steve to clean away the smudge.
“What?” asked Bucky with a careless air.
“Yeah.”
“Well then, if you’ll just follow me. Steve’s enclosure is just up this way.”
Tony thought his birthday would be the hardest to get through. Hell, he thought the anniversary would be impossible to stand. But no, nothing was harder than Christmas without Sheriff Steven Rogers. At a time where his heart should have been full of laughter and cheer, all he felt was a cold emptiness similar to a sleeping forge.
Steve’s eyes lit up like stars in the night sky. He leaped up, kissing Tony with boundless enthusiasm until they were both light headed. He slipped the ring on Tony’s finger with ease. They hugged each other, laughing like they just won the lottery of a lifetime. Oh, who was Tony kidding? A love like theirs, a relationship as strong and as rocky as theirs was, might as well have been the ultimate lottery.
Relief crossed Steve’s face. “Good. Hey, um…” He looked down and did that adorable feet shuffle Tony had seen the first day they met. “Feel free to stop by any time you want. I feel bad kicking you out like this.” Steve's focus darted over to Beefcake McGoldilocks. The constant rubbing of his hands screamed worry and mother hen instinct. Tony could take a hint.
Steve’s smile faltered. “I know we had a lot of fun today, but don’t you miss home?” He knew Tony didn’t have the best childhood, but could it really be so bad that he didn’t want to return?
Just as Thor was about to serve the drinks, Steve heard Dr. Banner whispered something to War Machine.  “I know you have a problem with them. If I were you, I’d take care of it now. You know he won’t be happy if we can’t get along.”
"Barton, you and Rhodey start marking up territory. I want to see our name in the paper when I wake up tomorrow.”
Everyone in the kitchen lost their minds. And thus began the benign bet of who could give Tony the weirdest morning coffee before he noticed.
"Well, it involves toast..."
“I do,” said Bruce with relief at the temporary peace. “It’s actually quite good, and I know what the inner circle likes. Plus, Iron Man has already tasted your stuff and has insisted on paying you at least $2 a bottle.”
“No!” Tony yelled. He held the doll close to his chest. “I want it.”
“Nothing Pep,” he said, with a reassuring smile.
Sleep tugged at his eyelids and the corners of his sight became fuzzy and dim. ‘Maybe Obie was right,’ he thought, slowly realizing how much the couch pulled him into its soft embrace. ‘Maybe he should sleep on it.’ He remember the amazed look on Steve’s face when he first entered the workshop, picking out as many little details as he could. The sparkle in his eyes. The turn of his lips. The timber of his voice as he called out Tony’s name.
“Or someone,” Tony said with an appreciative smirk.
A black hole opened in Steve’s stomach. “I can’t use him like that.”
Smooth as an assembly line, and as quiet as mice, Thor worked the lids open while Sam and Bucky carefully placed them on the ground. As they peered into the crate the gang began to smile as Steve’s heart sunk. It was like Christmas, but with less cheer and more guilt. Steve reached in and pulled out a cold, sleek handgun. He shifted the semi in his hands, letting the gravity of the gun sink into his hands and his conscience. This was people’s hard work and honest pay he was taking. This was someone’s bread and butter. It wasn’t right to take something like this.
“Unexpected?” he confirmed.
“Shh!” hushed Steve, trying to listen. His hand floated froze mid-air. He didn’t dare think about pushing the bullet in his hand into the magazine. The slightest sound and they could be gonners.
“This,” replied Schmidt, stroking the thick fingers of the gauntlet as if it were a treasured lover, “is the hope for Deutschland given physical form. The new right hand of the German people.” He chuckled, gazing at the weapon with longing eyes. “As always, Stark’s work is unparalleled.”
In the kitchen, Steve chuckled. “Give yourself a break, Tony. You’re getting your family’s company back. That’s got to require a lot of paperwork.”
When the echo finally faded, Tony looked up. The wolf was gone and in his place was one of the most beautiful men Tony had ever seen. Sharp blue eyes peeked out from beneath an unkempt mop of blond hair. Pale skin glistened in the morning mildew. His body was thin from malnutrition, but Tony could see the strong muscle hidden underneath taut skin. He most definitely did not take advantage of the man’s nakedness to sneak a peek at the family jewels because “Wow,” was the only thing Tony could say as the man bathed in the morning sunlight for the first time in years.
Tony blushed. “You don’t have to, you know. I’m the only one that has to say ‘yes’ when you offer the ring.”
The answer was on his lips before Steve finished. But as easy as it was to say, it took a few tries before Tony finally got it out. “Yes,” Tony said through a smile so big and a heart beating so fast it felt like it was going to burst. “Yes, I will marry you.”
Tony tried to come up with some excuse. Something to tell them that they were crazy or just letting their imaginations run wild in his absence. But he couldn’t. Tony couldn’t say it because some small part of him knew it was true. Some small part of him wished beyond a doubt that it was true. “We’re not like that,” he murmured quietly
“How was Brooklyn?” asked Happy as Tony pulled the car door shut.
Steve nodded as the pair slowly made their way to the edge of the park. “Real bad. Jones says he’s business is on the up and up, and he can’t take a risk on bathtub booze like ours. He says there’s rumor going around ‘bout a new joint opening up in the next few weeks, and he can’t risk losing customers to unclean homemade stuff.”
Tony nodded. He knew the feeling all too well. “Let me see your hands. I want to see the damage,” Tony said as he stood up.
“But we like making Mr. Ross mad.”
“Maybe you should be dating him instead of me,” Steve said, the beginnings of a smile flickering in the corners of his mouth.
Steve let out a painfully forced laugh and rolled his eyes to the sky. “That’s the least of our problems.”
“No, Tony,” Steve interruption was curt . His face was pinched in all the wrong places, like he wanted to shove Tony out the door and flat out on his ass. “It’s fine. We have to take care if it ourselves. We don’t have the money to afford a doctor.”
“Pepper!” Tony greeted her with a wide smile and a kiss on the cheek. “Love of my life. Please save me from the boring pleasantries that is meeting and greeting every soul in the company.”
Tony shrugged as he tried to shake it off. “There was always that eighty eight percent chance that Hawkeye was stalking me.” Because that was a thing that Clint did on a regular basis even outside of Pepper’s requests. Tony had yet to catch Clint in the act when he was trying to stay hidden, but Clint always had a way of knowing stuff that he shouldn’t know unless he was spying.
Stane shook his head. “Sometimes I can’t tell if you’re really a genius or just fucking with us,” he muttered. “But it’ll work for the meeting. I’ll do what I can to keep them off our backs.”
Rumlow sauntered over, his eyes wide with interest. “What is it boss?”
“Not enough,” Tony said, gasping for breath. He threaded his fingers through Steve’s blond hair. “I want to feel every part of you.”
Steve’s attention shifted to the other man in the room.
“Don’t be,” said Steve. "You didn’t decide to end up in the Dollhouse and you didn’t deserve to disappear there.”
When the man got closer, Steve grabbed a fist full of hair and pulled his head down. Steve brought his right leg up and kneed the man in the nose. The man’s head snapped back like a whip. He screamed bloody murder as his nose bled out like a fountain. He staggered away from the door, but Steve wasn’t done yet. Steve bared his teeth and kicked the man in the gut. The man feel backwards and tumbled back into the room.
Reality swept in as the elevator doors opened to his floor. As much as Tony had the power and the right to pull off something this big and drastic; the truth was Obie was right. Thousands of people would be out of work by shutting down the company at this point in time. And seeing the way Steve and the other half lived, it just hit home how much Tony could not do that. These people needed work, needed money to survive. If he shut down now, who know how many people would commit suicide or die of starvation because of his actions.
“Good morning, young sir,” said Vision with an easy smile. Clearly the only one awake. “Come down for breakfast, I see. Can I help you find anything?”
“Keep it together Cap,” Bucky shook Steve back to his senses.
Tony was sleeping peacefully on his side. His right cheek mashed into the pillow. A few stray strands, mostly brown but a few going gray, draped across his eyes like a curtain. Slim fingers were tucked under Tony’s chin as if he was holding something precious to his heart. His naturally tanned chest moved up and down with each breath he took, giving life to a maze of scars that should have killed him long ago. Tony’s mouth, open ever so slightly as breath after life giving breath passed between his lips.
Steve shuffled his feet, big shoulders hunched over when he said, “I should take you back now.”
Panic gripped his heart. Where was Tony? What the hell was he doing in a place like this? Was he in trouble? Worse, was he in danger? Was the Iron Family holding him hostage because of what happened with Steve? He had to find him. He had to find Tony.
“That’s a very big promise.”
Let me know if you have any questions or feedback. Not a crap week. Just exhausting.
“I many not have your resources, but I certainly have connections. Connections money can’t buy.” Steve reeled his arm back as far as it could go.
Dusk had fallen by the time the last soldier had received his greasy and possibly under cooked donut. Tony wiped his sweaty forehead with the back of his hand as he turned off the heat to the fryers. He took a quick look around the kitchen as he wrapped up the leftover dough. Flour and grease speckled the floor like spots on a dog. Tony let out a tired sigh. He had a heck of a lot of cleaning to do before he called it a night, but right now his feet, ankles, and knees all felt like they were on fire. Tony needed a break.
“Tony,” Bruce interrupted Tony’s thoughts with a meek objection. “I really think I should mention-”
“Mister Tony Stark? Don’t tell me you’ve never heard of him.”
“Relax. I know what I’m doing,” Bucky reassured them as he inched toward Steve.
“Oh my god. What’s mini me doing up this early?” groaned Tony. He tried to wriggle closer to Steve. His once relaxed eyes were squeezed shut as Tony tried hold onto the last remains of a lazy morning.
“Hey. Hey! Knock it off you two” Rhodey said, stepping in between the two men like a teacher breaking a fight between his students. “You’re scaring the kid again.”
Easier said than done. Tensions were high, blows were being traded midair, and there was little light in the dusty warehouse. Brightly colored suit or not, an idiot encased in metal could easily be missed. So, just to be on the safe side, he gave the Brooklyn Boys a friendly wave and threw in a couple of repulsor blasts at moving shadows. That ought to get Steve’s attention for sure.
“Me too. But there’s nothing we can do. Cap’s in no place to give orders and given Bucky’s condition...” Sam let out a heavy sigh. “I don’t know. I think the smart thing is to stay put for now.”
It wasn’t the same dark blue that colored the arctic tundra. No. Even this deep in the water, Tony could see it’s a darker blue. Almost navy. And the shape, he can’t make it out too well, but something about it felt so familiar and yet wrong at the same time. Whatever it was, whatever was trapped in the ice, it didn’t belong here.
"Tony?" Steve's mind slowed down from the adrenaline filled high. The mess of brown hair did look familiar. So did the goatee. So did those dark chocolate brown eyes. He staggered back in surprise. Steve could hardly process it. There, splayed out on the ground, was Tony. Perfect, wonderful Tony.
The wolf didn’t say anything.
you fast food patties. It’s not good for you.”
“What would be weird then?”
“Yeah, guessing that’s the adrenaline talking,” Steve said breathlessly. With adept hands, he ripped the edge of his shirt to make a patch to stop the blood.
Tony huffed. He really didn’t want to leave without giving Steve a proper goodbye, but the slow growing wetness on his shoulder was becoming a good reason to go. “He’s going to expect me to be here when he comes back.”
A warm hand wrapped around his shoulders, and Tony was five years old again. “I know it’s been a long time since you made something for someone else,” Stane said in a gentle voice that could rock Tony to sleep. “But give it a little time Tony. You’ll get it eventually. Just like riding a bicycle.”
“Magnificent.” Schmidt was practically glowing with glee. He closed his gloved fingers around the glowing circle in his hand. “This much power in the palm of my hand, it’s just as our dealer advertised.” He turned to his subordinate, manic smile on his face. “Rumlow, any sign that the infestation has been dealt with?”
Steve mentally slapped himself for sounding like an idiot. “Will I see you again sometime?”
On the other side of the service window was Captain American flag himself. He stood at parade rest, shoulders back, clumps of blond hair stuck out from his head at awkward angles. The moment their eyes met, the man smiled. It was one of those small smiles that lifts up only one corner of the mouth. It made the captain’s deep blue eyes sparkle under his long lashes and Tony’s cold heart melted like spring snow.
“Well, seems like a good place to start,” Tony said, leaning closer to Steve until they were only inches apart. “Speaking of firsts, it sounds like he never took you out on a first date. How about it, champ? Up for popping your first date cherry with me?”
He could trust his lieutenants and butler with just about anything. Obie, well, Obie’s approval meant more to him than anything. He couldn’t find out that Tony was bi. Or that he was a mob boss. Or that he lost his virginity at the age of 13 while under the influence of four different types of narcotics. Important things like that.
Tony forced his legs to run as fast as possible through the heavy weight of the suit. But a punch in the kisser from stupid, fucking Rumlow sent his spiraling off course.
But when Tony turned around and tipped his cap to Steve. That rush of heat to his chest suddenly made it all worth it.
Tony’s heart leapt in his chest. He swam up and dug his claws into the crack.
Oh no.
Steve shook his head. “Only you would call a bloodbath like that a show.”
“Nothing,” Tony said to the nonverbal wolf. “It’s just… um… I… um… I, you know, I gotta get this checked out. By like, and actual professional? Or semi-professional who has thumbs and can use a first aid kit? Kinda huts like hell. So… um… yeah. See you later?”
“Oh. Okay.”
Steve sniffed a rock. No response.
“Anyway, I don’t think Uncle Obie is right. Jarvis cooks for me all the time and he’s not a woman.”
Phil’s warning echoed in Steve’s head again, but he chose to ignore it. Tony had set all this up for him during his two weeks of what he called ‘workaholic hell’. Even if things turned south and the deal didn’t go through, the least Steve could do was meet Tony’s friends. Tony had done so much for him them; it would be rude to back out now.
“What?” he tried to remember what Stane could be talking about. “The helping hand?” It was hard to believe the investors would give that piece of scrap metal the time of day. It was just a theory that had been forced to the back burner because of everything else, but Tony had every intention of finishing it; provided biologists and engineers could get their heads out of their asses long enough to provide him with solid research.
"And the orders? We have enough to make a profit?"
“Yes sir.”
“You sure that’s not yours?” he asked, eyeing Steve’s bloody fingers and purpling knuckles. He tried to lift the sides of his lips at the cruel joke, but his body seemed to be set on ignoring him.
“Okay,” said Tony. “Let him out.”
Yensin were the ones performing surgery. With Bruce flying solo, I can’t say for sure.
“About all this,” Steve said, gesturing to the lavish room. “About your job, your gang, about anything.”
“Really rather not,” groaned Tony from inside the suit.
Tony laughed at that, only stopping when the pain was unbearable.
Steve rolled his eyes. “Just hurry up and close the window, Dugan.”
“Yeah! A lot of folks in Brooklyn have temp work or seasonal contracts with Stark Industries. And a lot of folks I know are looking for full time work at Stark Industries, but haven’t gotten close to getting. But you actually got in. And you have your own business card!”
He spotted the food from that morning in front of the doggy door; still untouched save for the flies buzzing around it, consuming till their little heart’s content.
“I hope you know what you’re doing.”
“Hey, this the line for food?”
“Tony, I…” Steve stammered. He knew what he wanted to say, but he just couldn’t fine the right words to express it. “It’s just... I want to but… Bucky is…”
“Because I’m Steve’s favorite and you aren’t,” the kid said with a smug smile.
This ‘Schmidt’ guy walked into the warehouse, nose tilted up so high with arrogance that Tony could’ve mistaken him for a pig. Oh, yeah. he was going to have too much fun ripping these guys a new one.
Bruce shrugged. “Besides potential info on the Boston attack, not really. Nothing of significant importance anyway. But it’s always good to be prepared for anything. Maybe I can get some secrets about Hydra we can use in the future.”
With a wave of his hand, Steve took his crew in. Following the familiar tinkle of a bell, the inside appearance was fairly subdued. The inside was a small little space with two hanging light fixtures highlighting the dark green walls. The sporadic furniture lying about made it confusing as to what the store was meant to be. A large, sturdy shelf stood empty, but at rapt attention behind a long island surface, sun-bleached so bad there was a well-defined dark brown square at one end. Must have been where the register went. There was a sad looking couch sagging into one of the far corner of the room.  From the wear and tear, pattern, and dirt ground into the cushions, it must have belonged to someone’s grandmother ages ago. A circular table sat in the middle of the room surrounded by a mismatched mess of chairs. Cards, chips, mahjong pieces, and cigarettes were scattered across the table, but there was a distinct lack of fresh smoke in the air.
"Toast!"
His heart skipped a beat as his chest trapped the thin air in his lungs. So it was Steve. His eyes hadn’t deceived him.
Perfect. Just the opportunity Tony needed.
“Tony,” Steve said and was it just Tony’s imagination or did Steve’s eyes light up when he said Tony’s name. “It suits you.”
Tony groaned “No fair. I wanna know now.”
He wanted to do was get away from Tony. He wanted to run away from that lying son of a bitch. Steve wanted to get away from Tony’s life, his company, hell, anything that had to do with him or the Iron Family; Steve wanted to wash his hands of it and throw all his shame down the Hudson with only a pair of cement shoes for comfort.
Tony took the box and gingerly pushed back the lid. Inside was a large, gold band. Perfectly measured to fit around Steve’s ring finger. The arc reactor was engraved on the inside of the band along with the words, ‘Protector of my heart.’ It was corny and sentimental, but it made Steve smile every time Tony said it to him.
Steve’s stomach dropped. Cops don’t take out lights. Cops were stupid and marched in single fine like cattle. If these people were smart enough to take out the lights so people wouldn’t be able to see, if it wasn’t the cops, who in the hell could it be?
Steve nodded, his eyes never looking away from Tony’s chest. “Will the same happen to Bucky?”
Tony smirked. “Don’t think I’ll be going anywhere on my own anytime soon.”
Tony quickly turned his attention to his pet projects.  None of that mattered right now. “If you see him, tell him I’m not home at the moment. Don’t want to ruin the surprise. Diagrams and pictures on the wall might not give him the right idea. Iron Family stuff and all that.”
Steve’s brain stuttered to a stop. “That’s … a little more complicated,” Steve said, trying to be as delicate as possible. He had only recently learned about all the new words to describe sexuality. Things like gender identity and gender expression were still new to him.
The kid bit his lip. He nervously shot a glance up to Steve and Tony. When neither of them moved, he ran into Rhodey’s outstretched arms and buried his head in the man’s chest. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make him mad.”
Steve gulped. This dame really seemed like she knew her stuff. “Tony. He said he worked here as an engineer. He gave me his card.” Steve reached into his back pocket and felt the tip of a thick piece of paper. He almost yanked it apart as he thrust the crumpled up business card, still warm with his body heat, into her manicured hands. She looked at in in silence.
Sam pushed his shoulders back to stand at his full height as he made his way into Steve’s space. “Someone else who stronger than me? Someone more capable than me?” Sam’s sharp brown eyes bore into his.
“Enjoy the whiskey, Steve,” whispered Tony as he watched the rich, warm spirit disappear into the ground. “Can’t go buying you flowers, so I got you the good stuff. Hope you appreciate it, you uncultured swine.”
“What?” asked the kid.
Steve opened his mouth to answer, but the second he did, it was all gone. Like sand through a sieve, the details of the dream faded and disappeared. He couldn’t remember the smell of motor oil on skin or the burn of a beard on his cheek or soft hair under his fingers. He couldn’t remember the man, diligently waiting for him in his dream repeating, “I love you,” over and over again. In a second, it was all gone and Steve was left feeling just as alone and confused has he had the day the spell was cast.
“You should tell them,” said Steve, relaxing against the red brick wall for the first time since he got in line. “To-ny. To NY (New York).” Immigration joke. It was low, but from the looks of it, the joke made Tony smile.
A few days later, Tony gets a text on his night off.
They sat there a few minutes, Rhodey giving Tony the accusatory eye and Tony pretending it didn’t exist. Eventually, he got tired of the look. “What?” he asked, not bothering to look up from the wielding.
“If you actually listen to what he's saying, yeah. Most of the people at his rallies are too dumb to question what he’s preaching.”
“Everything is in order Captain,” reassured Thor.
Steve jumped, but it wasn’t out of fear. He covered his face with his hands as his pale cheeks immediately turned scarlet red.
Steve let out a heavy sigh. “Looks like you’re stuck with us for a while, kid.”
Tony was not intimidated in the least. He rolled back his shoulders. The powerful rage in his eyes settled into a calm, neutral expression. “Okay. We’re playing that way.” Without another word, Tony sauntered over to the far corner of the room. He picked up his dress jacket and shrugged it over his shoulders like a second skin. Tony spun around on the bloody heels of his shoes and smiled at Steve. “I’m going to take a break.”
Tony couldn’t help but laugh at Clint’s disgust. “You’re just jealous of all the angry sex I’m going to get when this is all over. It’s going to be so fucking fantastic that I won’t be able to sit for a week.”
There was a mischievous twinkle in Tony’s eyes as his lips curled up into a peculiar smile. “Kid, a lot of things happen when we get older. A few of them being everything hurts and our lack of stamina makes it harder to keep our energy up. Epically during vigorous exercise.”
Steve looked up. When he saw who it was, he couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief. Never in his life was he so relieved to see the color red. Gorgeous as always, the former Natalia Romanova sauntered down toward them. The scent of New York dogs wafting down in their direction.
Steve’s guys had gotten jumped seven times since Bucky came in, not two days ago, with the shiner. Unfortunately, not all encounters were hand-to-hand combat like they were used to. More than a few guys came packing heat, and that was a major problem from the Brooklyn Boys. They were an bare hand type of gang for crying out loud! Even with the two handguns, shoddy rifle, and Thor with his favorite hammer, they were no match against Tommies and the various semi-automatics. They didn't have the money, resources, or connections to keep up with that type of crowd. Hence why they were still such a small name in town. Bootleg kept them afloat, and their good graces with the local neighbors kept them going.
Tony tried to shake off the noise, but he had frankly had enough of this bullshit. Quick as he could, Tony reached up and unclasped the helmet. A familiar “click” and it was like breathing for the first time. Tony lifted the helmet off his head and shook the sweat from his brow, finally free from the sound cage.
He started swimming back to the ship, darting behind the occasional ice floe or glacier to help hide his presence from the ship’s radar. But just as the ship’ anchor was coming into view, Tony spotted something out of the corner of his eye. Something small. Something blue. Something that didn’t belong in the ocean.
Steve stood up. “What is wrong with you? Why are you making such a big deal out of this?”
“What?” he asked, playing clueless to her strife.
So *ahem* it's been very much over a year. I've been saying I want to come back to this for a long time and now I've finally worked up the energy to write one chapter. Here's to the next one coming out sooner than later I guess?
"You heard me," said Steve trying not to be distracted by how familiar the voice rang. This was not the time or place to get caught up in fantasies. He pulled back on the safety. The familiar click brought back his focus. "What the hell do you think you’re doing on prancing around a place like this? You think you can just walk in and do whatever the hell you want?"
The kid looked at Tony. Then Steve. Then back at Tony. “What aren’t you telling me? Is it one of those things you’ll tell me when I get older?”
Steve had walked out into the ocean with nothing but some scuba gear, swimming trunks on his ass, and a spear in hand. He claimed that he could catch fish the old-fashioned way. Tony doubted it. Why bother when they had perfectly good food in the fridge, but Steve had insisted. Either way, Tony found it amusing. Whenever Steve popped out from the water, he’d wave his empty stick for Tony, and then dove back down for another try.
“I saw the way you looked at him,” Natasha interrupted before Tony could spin any more lies. “You took up a gun after he was murdered, something you swore you’d never do again. That’s not something you would do if he wasn’t more than just a friend.”
Steve let out a frustrated sigh. “I’m not saying that.”
“And what about you?” asked Bucky. “How come you get to be all special and go by yourself?”
“Oh, that’s easy. Because my husband is doing exactly that right as we speak,” Natasha said, gesturing to the top of the fence.
Tony tried to fight back. “Hey! Where are you taking me?”
Tony shook the tempting thoughts out of his head. Wouldn’t matter anyway. After he repaid Steve and said his goodbyes, none of this would matter.
Steve chuckled and fixed the receiver in his ear. “Brooklyn Boys, with me!”
“To get my stuff back,” he hissed. “I’m not going to let some manic get away with what’s mine.
“Here, this is the part I’m having problems with. Can’t replace the power source to make room for the accessories. Can’t make it any weaker either. But it keeps overheating if I don’t.” Tony took the time to describe each little section of the layout and the function of each part, hands flying all over the place like he was a mad scientist. The therms and technology went over Steve’s head, but he didn’t mind much. Hearing the excitement and calming tones in Tony’s voice was a peace in Steve’s crazy life. He could go asleep just listening to Tony talk. For a moment, it was nice to forget his own worries and focus on someone else.
Tony let out a low moan that reached all the way down to his cock. When was the last time he let go? When was the last time he let Steve do what he wanted? When was the last time Tony was as vocal as he wanted to be? They couldn’t do this back home. Too many nosey ears to do as they pleased. But this; Steve’s tongue lavishing Tony’s cock, tracing the throbbing veins along Tony’s shaft, Steve licking and slurping down every bit of Tony’s come as loud as he wanted, this was worth the wait.
Huh. That was interesting. Adult Tony liked strawberries, but the kid version didn’t. Maybe he learned to like it later in life. “In that case, just eat one. Never know unless you try it,” Steve said, putting the few remaining dishes in the sink to be washed later.
Tony’s brow furrowed in confusion. “But what if a man
Steve felt his heart being crushed. Better now than later. But it was his town. His baby Brooklyn that was being insulted. And by the look on Tony’s face, he was beginning to realize what he had done. Bucky always did say when Steve got sad or confused he could easily mistaken for a kicked puppy.
Bruce cautiously approached his frustrated boss. “You okay?”
Steve’s face lit up. Stupid, adorable smile plastered on his face, he leaned in close enough for his lips to graze the shell of Tony’s ear. “In private and in great detail if you like,” he murmured seductively.
“Uh, I didn’t sign up for this Cap,” Bucky said hesitantly.
“Guess there’s only one way to find out,” Rumlow said with a murderous chuckle.
The man closed his eyes. His head lolled forward. Then he began to laugh. It was quiet at first. Then it got louder, and louder. Within seconds, his unquestionably ruthless laughs filled the room. “Does a man grovel to an ant for mercy? I have no need to say anything. You are below me in every way, patty,” he hissed, lobbing a shot of blood into Steve’s face.
A loud ‘ah hem’ broke the two apart. “Are you done flirting yet?”
Steve shook his head, but the smile remained on his lips. “What I’m trying to say is, I love every part of you. Even your crazy early fanboy days. You don’t have to worry about him doing or saying something that embarrasses you. It’s not going to make me stop loving you.”
Tony walked behind the prisoner like a lion stalking his prey. He held his bloody hands loosely behind his back. His smile was relaxed and easy as if nothing was wrong. But Steve could sense a cold anger hidden underneath the surface. It was something about his eyes. Something about the Cheshire curl of his smile. Something about his posture that screamed ‘boss.’
“Go see Tony,” Sam said, winded. “He knows the Iron Family. He may not have access to what we need right now, but I’m betting he can get us what we need with the fewest strings attached. It’s underhanded, but if it’s true that he has some sort of strange, weak allegiance with the Iron Family, it might be our best shot to getting what we need to stay alive.”
“How about we elope?” proposed Steve, snuggling close to Tony. “We leave the island a few days early, get on the plane, fly over to Vegas, go to one of those shit chapels and have Elvis marry us?”
Steve groaned rumbled around Tony’s chest. “Can you guys please go somewhere else? Trying to have a moment here.”
A wave of heat and wind crashed over him. The force of the explosion knocked him off his feet and sent him tumbling once more into the ground. Debris riddled air howled in his ears with the strength of a tornado. Tiny shards of shrapnel bounced off his armor with an earsplitting
“I heard,” Steve said, picking up the small bundle of joy. He looked at Tony and mouthed a silent, “Thank you.”
If you go away, on the summer day, then you might as well take the sun away.
"Whatever their reason, that's none of our concern," said Steve, trying to bring back the group's focus. He could easily see how information about the "new kids in town" could cause panic in the group if the mulled over long enough. Of all things Steve needed in his life, an out of controlled distraction was the last thing he needed. Things were finally coming to a head and he didn't need an extra player stepping into the mix when it wasn't necessary or relevant.
“What? Am I just not a part of this conversation?” interjected Tony.
Steve’s brow furrowed. ‘What was that about?’ he wondered. However, his curiosity was quickly forgotten when War Machine sauntered over to his side. Steve stiffened, barely even breathing, as if the smallest movement would set the robot off. But nothing happened. War Machine, just stood next to Steve, crossed his arms, and watched the operation proceed as smooth as normal.
“That doesn’t make sense,” said Steve. “We were just arguing. Why would he-”
Sam only blew out a harsh stream of air, equally exhausted as the Cap. " I don't know what to tell you that you haven't thought of already. Keep your head down? Like I said, I don't think these guys mess around with small time."
Tony didn’t look up from the magnifying glass as he wired a disarray of coils together. “Wouldn’t be mine or Pep’s. You’re the one that wanted the extra heat.”
“I don’t remember.”
With an understanding nod, Happy started the car and pulled out from the curb.  “Where to boss?”
“No such thing.”
“What about Natasha?”
Oh dear god. “What’s he done now?” he asked, prepared for the worst.
“What the hell am I doing?” he murmured to himself. Steve wanted so bad to sink into the bench and forget everything. So much had happened within the past week, it wasn’t even funny anymore. Not that it was to begin with, but Steve was getting tired of having the weight of the world on his shoulders. The Iron Family was an unwelcomed surprise to the pecking order, as was finding out that legislation to permit prohibition was being discussed in congress. Contracts for their booze were being dropped left and right, and it was making Steve antsy. Steve wasn’t into politics, but Sam was. According to him and his sources in DC, they meant it this time. They had gone so far as proposing four different drafts and presenting it to the floor twice.
"You know the rules Hawkeye. Stick to them," said Tony absentmindedly. Clint's work was always good. He was a pain in the ass sometimes, but he knew how to get the job done quickly and efficiently. Provide you didn't mind an army of arrows sticking out of a body as a calling card. After their first hit with Hawkeye in tow, it never bothered Tony. Hawkeye did his job and he did it well. That was all that mattered. But considering the weapons of choice from his other lieutenants, never let it be said that the Iron Family was subtle. Plus, Tony couldn't be bother to care about that right now. Too many things to think about.
“The world and the nation will continue to punish us based off our heritage unless we act. Unless we tell them no. Unless we tell them, ‘No more!’ ‘No more will I stand to be taken advantage of!’ ‘No more will my nation and my people be responsible for the mistakes of the past.’ ‘No more will I find shame in the fact that I am German!’ Stand behind Hitler, brothers and sisters! He will lead us to victory! He will be the savior of Germany! He is our leader. He is our Fuehrer!”
“Steve, you were holding my hand when I woke up. You held onto it until Coulson brought us to this safe house. The only reason you let go was because I noticed it. Whatever happened, whatever you’re trying to say, I can take it. I want to know.”
“Pardon?” Steve thought they were going to see Tony.
Tony hummed. “Well, I suppose they do look a bit familiar.” That was an outright lie. Tony remembered them the instant he saw them. Hard to forget a rag tag group with some bigger than life personalities. Epically the blonde in the tight, blue uniform.
“They’re always looking for something that sells,” Tony scoffed. “That’s what they do.”
“It is,” Tony said, trying to look as upset as possible. “I finally get to spend time with Captain America and all I have to wear is this silly medical shirt.
“But don’t you want to know what I’m asking for?” she asked, skepticism in her voice.
“Fine, fine. I’m going. I’ll see you for dinner,” Tony said, and then he walked off.
“Well, there you have it Obie,” Tony said, spinning around in his chair. “As much as I am dying to deal with the board, I’m off for lunch with a friend. Wheeling and dealing, that sort of thing. You wouldn’t understand.”
Tony sighed. “I’m not asking you to trust me ‘just because.’ I just… can you please try and eat? Just a little? You’re so beautiful. I don’t want you dying on me.”
Tony just shook his head. “That doesn’t even make sense. We’re the same person.”
“Tony.” Steve pinched the bridge of his nose and scrunched up his face. Where had he heard that familiar tone before? Oh right, Pepper when she was exasperated with him. “It’s fine. We’ll deal with it.”
Pepper rolled her eyes. “Rescuing you from dying, more like.”
“Wait, did you just… Of course you did,” Tony said with a sour laugh. “Because you’ve decided to side with him from now on instead of your injured boyfri- You know what, don’t worry about it. I get it. He’s cute. Hard to say no to a face like that.”
Steve tried not to stare too much as he pulled out a piece of old newsprint and began sketching Tony’s form with strong dark strokes of charcoal. He hardly noticed when his fingers began to blacken as he added detail to the basic structures. He had to make the point just right if he wanted to capture the shadows and curves of the image perfectly. His eyes flashed up and down calculating and recreating each and every detail with his hands. As the image began to match reality, Steve felt that familiar rush of satisfaction.
Jane didn’t seem to notice. "And I heard somewhere that one of your doctors wrote a paper on advanced radiology. Not that I could understand much of what Doctor Banner wrote, but his theories are mind blowing."
Starting to feel that alcohol is the only long term relationship I’m worthy of.
“I must object,” said Thor, a hand clasp tightly on his captain’s shoulder. “Taking of our wares with no guarantee of payment is not how the Brooklyn Boys do business.”
"Alright, I landed the cute guy." Sam did a little celebratory dance.
Tony’s face fell, the guilt flooding Steve’s conscious in a surge of blackwater. “Steve-” Tony’s voice was tired and raw as if this was the last thing he wanted to hear.
“Try one of these arms on for size,” offered Schmidt, removing the weapon and offering it out to Rumlow. “I want to see what it can really do.”
“Who?” asked Obie. “Just say the word and I’ll get security to help.”
It took a few seconds before Steve realized that he was feeling a slight heaviness in his lungs. His feet felt heavy too, and the only thing he could do to ease the feeling was to shuffle them back and forth across the cobbled street. He didn’t want to go. He wanted to stay. Here. He wanted to say something, anything to ease the drawn out silence, but finding one good thing out of the million of inappropriate thoughts was impossible. “That was nice,” he finally said.
“Oh,” said Steve, trying to hide a blush of embarrassment. He hadn’t expected Tony to consciously notice a difference in quality. But now that he knew, Steve had to bite down on the urge to ask Tony what his favorite was and how would he feel about Steve making it again. “How long have you… you know, know?”
They stood in silence as the gold numbers above the door blinked on and off with a soft chime. “So, how do you know Tony?” asked Ms. Pots.
Tony bit down on his hand and tried not to cry out. The friction of the cloth against his cock burned the sensitive skin. Steve’s touch was muted by the fabric, but god it felt so good. Tony tried to stay still, but he wanted more. He needed more friction. Tony’s hips began buck up into the air, moving in time with Steve’s hand as he chased after the heat.
“Yeah, about that support,” Tony said, taking advantage of the easy tangent and away from the awkward and confusing conversation that is his love life. “I’m going to have to take you up on that. I need you to do a beer tasting for me. Now before you make any excuses, I’ll arrange everything beforehand so all you need to do is show up and taste the stuff.”
Rhodey laughed. “Gotta catch me first. I’m fast as lighting now.”
“Whiners don’t get red, white, and blue pancakes from Captain America,” Steve said, praying the bribe would get Tony’s mind off the very adult situation.
Sam increased his push on the pressure point, making his determination clear. Pain, guilt, and shame doused Steve’s fiery rage. Slowly, Steve came down from the adrenaline filled high. His breathing was still shallow, but at least it was regular.
"God Steve," said the voice. "If you didn't want to see me that badly, you could have just said so."
“Should I take offense to that?”
Rhodey gave Tony a pointed look, but said nothing. He crouched down onto his knees until he was about the same height as the kid. “You found what you wanted, right? How about we check out and give these two a minute to get their heads on straight. That sound good to you?”
He tossed the fish in a bucket of seawater and set his supplies down in the sand with a muffled thump as he settled down on the chair by Tony’s side. Steve propped his arms up on the armrest and just watched Tony calculate his way through the numbers.
“… no. But-”
“Bucky!”
Rumlow blistered at the jab. “I’d beat you to death, but I think that’d be too good for a fag like you.”
The first thing that Steve noticed was how empty the room was. It was about the size of his bedroom. Maybe smaller. A single lightbulb hung from the ceiling, flooding the room with in an eerie golden glow. The walls were bare save lines of brown blood splattered against the wood like slashes from a knife.
Tony expected his boyfriend to do something with his chest, but Steve had other ideas. Steve encircled Tony’s nipples, giving them a quick flick for good luck. Then he walked his fingers down through Tony’s happy trail and over the silk bed sheet still trapping Tony’s legs in place. Steve caressed the root of Tony’s cock through the fabric, but he didn’t stay there for long. His fingers fluttered down to Tony’s balls and, without a word or warning, gave them quick, light twist. Arousal raced up Tony’s spine. He arched up like a cat and let out a needy moan that echoed through the entire beach house.
As it turned out Tony wasn’t at St. Mary’s (big shock there), but when Steve called the number on Tony’s business card, Tony answered the phone like nothing happened. He said nothing about his injuries unless prompted and whenever Steve even hinted at the kiss during those first few days, Tony  promptly hung up without so much as a ‘by your leave’.
Natasha smiled. “Make it a double.”
Damn, that wasn’t good.
“Um, excuse me?”
This was his fault. This was all his fault. All the hard work and revisions that had gone into revamping the security system at Stark Industries, and look what happened. Another leak under his nose. If only he knew who the mole was. If only he could plug up the hole faster. If only he could do something, anything to prevent an incident like that from ever happening again.
“Steve!” he voice a little louder and braver than before.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony shook his head. Right. Now was not time to pine like some moll. Now was the time to take charge while the blood still ran hot.
“Ow! Watch the merchandise?” Tony clenched the edge of his seat, trying his best not to squirm away from the pain.
Closing his eyes, Tony took it all in. The scent of crisp morning air and cold sweat, the heat radiating off Steve’s body, almost inviting him to come closer. Their hands brushing against each other as tiny sparks of contact jump between their fingers. A ghost of lips, close to his, mercilessly tempting him to give in and take a bite. Tony let out a breath and felt the air effortlessly roll off Steve’s parted lips. High off the light feeling inside his chest, Tony followed the script to reach out and couple their lips together, but abruptly stopped.
“Not good,” Rhodey groaned. With a heavy grunt and Tony’s help, Rhodey pushed himself on his back so the flickering reactor in his chest blinked up at the sky. Looking down at the damage, Tony tried not to panic. Pieces of shrapnel lined both of his legs making his lower body look like a short, grey cactus. The shine of fresh blood eerily matched the sheen of sweat covering Rhodey’s face.
“Uh, standing right here Steve.” Tony’s objection was lost in the heated debate.
“Kids, am I right?” Tony said with a nervous chuckle as he looked down at Morgan’s picture. Physical proof that, after everything Steve and Tony had been through, they had managed to do one thing right. “Get all sorts of strange ideas in their head.”
“With what we’re doing, I’d rather do everything I can to keep Obie out of this. He’s like a second father to me and he doesn’t deserve to be on the other end of any fall out for the shit we’re getting into. Do whatever you can to make sure he’s not in the line of fire.”
I'm sorry that I'm so late and I'm sorry that it's so long. Hope it was worth the wait.
“It’s a shame,” said Wanda. “I wanted to teach him a few traditional games my brother and I played when we were children. I think Tony would have liked that.”
“Let me see what I can do,” said Tony, rolling up his sleeves.
“You can’t.” Bruce absolutely could not see ‘grease monkey’ without Steve knowing about it. And Steve absolutely could not know about this.
vacation. His time away from the Avengers. If he wanted five more minutes, Tony was sleeping another five minutes. Hot coffee be dammed.
A punch to the face distracted Tony, and the pressure on his bleeding right shoulder was gone. Tony tried to regain focus, but whoever was straddled over him was going to town anywhere above his waist. Tony attempted to cover his face, but at this range it was impossible to miss. Each shot rattled his skull and he felt his life force slowly draining out from the hole in his shoulder. A stray punch hit the arc reactor, buried under layers of protective clothes, and both exclaimed in pain. Metal dug into his flesh and Tony felt very much the need to right himself and adjust the device.
The wrinkles in Sam's brow deepened, but Steve saw hope when Sam ruffled his short dark curls with his fingers, as if doing so would loosen the right answers, or his tongue. "One guy," he finally said. "One guy, five shops, and a Tommy in each hand. That's the word from the rumor mill."
“You don’t have to-”
Tony’s cock twitched in eager interest. His hips canted up, chasing after Steve’s touch. Damn his traitorous body. Tony bit down on his lip as a needy groaned threatened to escape. He refused to give his boyfriend positive reinforcement from such blatant disrespect.
As they listened to the heavy sounds of footsteps disappearing down into a basement, anxiety filling Steve’s chest with each passing second, Sam leaned over and whispered into Steve’s ear, “Who the hell is the Engineer?”
Dammit all. It was like talking to a brick wall and expecting it to respond with something intelligent and groundbreaking. “How many times do I need to repeat myself, the arm isn’t fucking ready! I did not design that arm to be used as a weapon. And that’s what R&D’s unapproved modifications made it into, a weapon. It’s supposed to be a fucking prosthetic! Its purpose is to help people, not strangle the life out of them.”
Tony gave Steve an inquisitive look. “What job?”
“Um… are you guys done arguing?” asked a small voice.
“That bird,” Steve whispered.
“Do you have a better idea?” asked Steve.
Steve woke up, his head cradled in the lap of his best friend, Tony Stark. The credits to an old movie were playing in the background. Brass and woodwind instruments played an upbeat song, signaling to the audience the end of a battle won. But Tony’s attention was solely focused on Steve.
Pepper averted her eyes to a clipboard of papers. “I won’t even dignify that with an answer.”
“What?” asked Steve. He looked down at his sketch and felt a rush of embarrassment. No way was he fooling anyone with his particular brand of fascination. With clumsy fingers he somehow folded away the sketch. “I’m not-”
Joyful madness gripped Rumlow’s eyes. Encouraged by Tony’s reaction, he thrust his hand into the cavity and dug his fingers into the warm metal.
Tony gave a breathless nod. “Well!” Tony asked between shorts gasps of air, stretching his arms wide as if to say ‘look at all this shit I have to deal with’. “Now do you feel like an idiot?” Tony threw his helmet to the ground with a resounding and satisfying clunk.
“Oh.” Steve looked down to try and hide his embarrassment. Even Steve would not deny that he heard disappointment in his voice.
Steve turned his head to give Tony his full attention, to be respectful and all that. As he did, Tony’s hand flashed out and snagged the sketch from Steve's fingers.
“Can you live with that guilt, Tony?” asked Stane in a comforting, fatherly voice that implied he was only looking out for Tony’s best interest. “That, because of your selfishness, you put so many on death row because they can no longer work and no longer provide for their families?”
At that exact moment, because the universe hated Tony with a passion, a sleepy yawn came from the other side of the plane. Tony’s eyes went right to the child as he stretched across the long seat like a cat.
Tony could almost hear Stane's teeth grinding together in anger. “What the hell is wrong with you Tony? You don’t have the right.”
“And then you came to my door in a suit and tie with a beautiful bouquet and I just stood there in a ragged t-shirt covered in green stains from DUM-E’s early smoothie making days because I thought you weren’t serious,” Tony laughed at the memory. Tony had been so embarrassed he’d actually shut the door in Steve’s face, convinced it was all some weird dream. Good thing he’d answered the door when Steve knocked again. Man never knew when to give up. “And now, look where we are,” Tony murmured as he cuddled his favorite superhero.
“Me?” squeaked Steve, still not believing that this wasn’t a dream.
A loud cough broke returned Steve to his surroundings. When had everyone gathered around them? And why weren’t they busy with something else right about now?
The ocean looked cold. Glaciers jutted out from the water. Ice floes drifted to and fro across the black surface. Not even the seals wanted to be in the water at this time of night. They’d rather sleep on sheets of ice than go for a late night swim. And yet Tony didn’t have a choice. It was now or never. He just really wasn’t looking forward to jumping in.
Tony nodded. “It could. Or…”
“Hi,” said the man with an awkward wave of his hand.
Less than a week later, the werewolf’s pack came into town. SHIELD had found them and called Tony the day before to give him the heads up. He had told them not to get their hopes up. Abuse like that couldn’t be healed overnight, but they insisted on seeing the damage themselves.
Clint beamed with pride. “See, he loves it. We should get it for him.”
“Nah. Rhodes is like a brother. It’d just be weird dating my brother,” said Tony as he scuffed the bottom his shoe on the ground. “Besides, if the kid is any indication, I’m too far gone on you to be interested in anyone else.”
“I know it is,” replied Tony.
Sam walked over to the sink and turned on the water. The exposed pipes creaked and rumbled as clean water raced out of the tap. Steve put his hand under the water and just as quickly pulled it back. It was cold. Ice cold.
Rhodey glared at Tony. He walked up to Tony until their faces were only inches apart. “Don’t give me no lip, Tones,” he said in a curt voice. “It’s one thing for you guys to fight in private or on a mission. It’s something else to fight in front of a kid. You of all people should know that.”
“Are you sure this will work?” asked Pepper. “I haven’t heard a single story of a well established family moving to a different city, let alone a different state, and reestablishing themselves successfully.”
“Why not?” asked Tony.
Fast as he could, Tony made his way back to the garage door. Finding adequate cover, he ducked down just in time to hear the screams of repulsor blasts. Out of the corner of his eye, Tony could see Rescue and War Machine doing the good work and punching those cards.
“Just because we’re not at war doesn’t mean the needs for weapons goes away. I told you before, Russia is undergoing a revolution as we speak. They need weapons, Tony. I’ve been contacted by five different factions within the past month about new contracts. And with that Hitler guy as the head of Germany and the Nazi party, it’s possible that all of Europe might got to war again in the next few years. We’re talking about global opportunities here Tony, not just domestic.”
“Less than a pint,” Tony said with a groan as he tried to push himself up. “I’ll be fine. Mostly in shock right now, so it looks worse than it really is. Bullet is stopping a lot of the blood from coming out, so bleeding to death is not how I’m going to go out.”
What the hell? He was Tony fucking Stark! He was the one who made the first move in a relationship. Smooth lines, flirty suggestions, a kiss on the lips after a first date of wining and dinning always got him the girl. But here was Steve who plowed through all Tony’s expectations, destroyed his carefully crafted plan to come back to all this later, and kissed him like it was the best date ever and one of them wasn’t bleeding out on the street. Damn it! Steve wasn’t supposed to move this quickly.
Steve groaned. He really didn’t want to deal with this now. “Not now Sam,” he muttered.
If worst came to worst, he should set up a soup kitchen like Capone did in Chicago. That was an option. Then his people wouldn’t go hungry. `Maybe Steve could help,’ he thought, the blissful idea tugging a sad smile to one side of his face.
“Yeah?”
“Tony!” Steve pushed a hand against Tony’s mouth, blushing brighter and harder than Tony had ever seen before.
“And me?” asked Pepper.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Tony drawled. He looked around the room then beckoned Steve closer. Steve leaned in until Tony’s lips could brush the edge of Steve’s ear, Tony whispered, “Is your name really Steve?”
“You’re just jealous,” sneered the kid.
“What the hell are you thinking boss?” Pepper demanded, joining him behind the assortment of crates acting as cover.
Well, that last one might be a bit difficult to hide, but he could do it.
“Freak, need you to make sure our guests are ‘comfortable’.” He motioned to the injured idiot with a quick jerk of his head.
“I don’t,” Tony replied a little too quickly.
“Is a non-issue at this point in time,” advised Bruce, putting his foot down on the matter once and for all. “We’re here for the booze, not personal agendas.” He turned to them, his body like a wall between the two factions. “You stuff checks out with me, but I need to take the bottles back for the other members of the inner circle to sample.”
“Then I will do my absolute best to forget,” he said with a wave over his shoulder as he and Pepper walked out the lab and to the elevator.
“Steve, let me ask you this,” she leaned forward enough that her sharp green eyes were levelled with his tired blues. “Do you really want to argue semantics with me, or do you really want those guns.”
He did have a point. Tony would never have come up with a plan like that. His strategy would have been more of a “boom” “bang” “in your face” kind of thing. After listening to Steve’s orders, Tony could hear how uncomfortable his own family was through the silence over the radio.
“And?”
“Explain later. Just help me get this shit off him so we can get him in the car,” grumbled Tony, fingers fast at work to remove as much of Rhodey’s armor as he could. Never mind how much it cost to make the armor. It did its job. It protected Rhodey’s heart, and now Tony needed to get it off.
This took Rhodey by surprise. “What?”
Steve knew Tony didn’t have a great childhood. He had held Tony through enough screaming nightmares to know their relationship wasn’t ideal. But the way younger Tony was crying, Steve never realized how bad it really was. He knew some of the facts. But being told about it from Tony’s removed, adult perspective was one thing. Seeing how younger Tony reacted to a very current problem was something else.
With a request for giggle juice, it was possible that they were supposed to meet were in a completely different room.  Considering that there was a dark painted door at the back of the shop hidden in the shadows, Steve bet his hunch was correct. With a leader’s confidence, he went over and nudged the smooth surface, expecting the door to be locked. Surprisingly, the door opened without as much as a squeak to a larger than life speakeasy.
“No Pep,” Tony whined. “They give me the creeps. Even worse than Osborn. Can’t I just blow it off all like I normally do?
Steve let out a tired chuckle. “Understatement of the year.”
“Oh,” Bruce whipped his knuckles on a once green handkerchief that had since been stained red. “I thought we were talking about something important.”
“Tony? What’s wrong?”
Tony rolled his eyes. He bent down under the fryer and resumed his maintenance check on the various valves and knobs that were inevitably loosened during the long drive over the European mountainside. “Jan, need I remind you that we are a mobile donut truck for the military. We go from military outpost to military outpost with the goal of lifting these men’s spirits through food. We have no regulars.”
There were so many options to consider: Spanish beans, Italian beans, Brazilian beans, Chinese beans, even fair trade beans were in a world of their own. He experimented with grind sizes, strong verses sweet, rich versus weak, press versus drip, boiling water versus slightly above room temp water. His normally sparse room turned into a tiny coffee lab and Steve couldn’t find the energy to care. Not when he got the chance to see Tony’s eyes sparkle every time the genius took a sip of Steve’s heavily research coffee. Yes, Steve was putting an excessive amount of work into a dumb prank, but it still made his day whenever Tony let out a contended hum as Steve’s labor intensive coffee washed over his tongue.
Steve’s ear twitched, but his blue eyes showed no sign of recognizing the man. He turned his attention to a nearby tree and resumed his inspection of the enclosure.
“Uh huh,” Tony nodded. “I wanna hear about what you did during the war. The comic dad keeps in his office says you did some really neat things, but he also says they’re just an exaguration and I shouldn’t fill my mind with such nonsense.”
Steve tried to take a moment and catch his breath. His head was cloudy, but he tried anyway. In and out. In and out. Slow and steady breaths in time with the ground’s pulses.
“I don’t know. I’d like to think I give myself just enough,” Tony purred.
“Tony,” interrupted Steve before his boyfriend could get too off track. “Whatever it is, I want to hear it.”
After taking care of the glasses and the bottle, he fetched his sketch pad and pencils form his disorganized corner of the room. Grabbing a chair and one of the few flat surfaces open to act as a table, Steve began to sketch, but this time he dedicated more effort and care to each stroke. Rough sketches on fliers and literature were fine for practice, but art supplies were expensive and a luxury item compared to food and rent.
Stane's eyes softened. “I miss him too,” said Stane with a tired smile. He wrapped a reassuring arm around Tony’s shoulders. “But you’re here now. And having a Stark to continue the Stark name should be a boost for morale.”
“Me neither, but I’m honestly not surprised,” grumbled Rhodey as War Machine retreated back to the end of the aisle for cover
Tony smiled, a dazzling bright smile that lit up his face. “I don’t think they do.”
“Bucky!”
Never mess with Tony’s coffee.
Tony held out the glass of water. Steve took it, but as he did, Tony’s fingers drifted down Steve’s hand and gently caressed the inside of his palm. A shiver ran up Steve’s back. Tony’s touch left a tingling trail of warmth from the crease in Steve’s hand all the way down to his wrist.
Tony hesitated before looking up at Steve. Something was off. It felt like Tony had put up a mask between them and it wrecked Steve to see Tony like that. “Yeah, well, when you’ve been in the white collar business as long as I have, you realize how easy it is to forget the difference between networking and abusing privileges. It’s all in the semantics.”
Damn. He was so going to have a word with Hawkeye about unnecessary stalking.
“But you haven’t seen yourself the past few days,” Rhodey insisted. “Tones, you’re a mess. We know you’re driven to get the guys who took your heart. But the last few days have been the worse we’ve ever seen. You’ve been running yourself ragged building and inventing and frankly it’s beginning to scare us.”
Expensive drinks! Oh shit. Reality hit him like a sack of bricks. Without any indication, Tony had set them up with their first high profile client. Realizing the level of professionalism and discretion that was required when dealing with high profile clients, Steve suddenly felt nervous and very out of place. What the hell was Tony thinking recommending him to a place like this?
“Just making conversation,” said Steve with a shrug. He tried to convince himself that he hadn’t been eying Tonly more than strictly necessary as they parted ways.
Tony glared at the stack of pancakes. He picked up a glistening strawberry with the tips of his fingers. Tony turned it around, examining the surface for any imperfections or any excuse not to eat the foul thing. Unfortunately, Steve had selected only the best fruit leaving Tony only one option, eat the damn thing.
Steve’s heart stopped. He looked at the empty spot in Tony’s lap. “The kid.” Steve scanned the room. “Where is he? Has anyone seen him?”
“Simple,” Tony said. “You’ve stolen my heart.”
“Well,” Bruce criticized. “If you put it in a certain light, it really does look like a love letter. A very messed up letter.”
He was so cold. He felt so lost and alone. Everyone was looking to him for answer and Steve didn’t have any. The world as he knew it was crumbling down around him and the only thing Steve could do was hang on. Bucky was in intensive care, Natasha was missing, Tony was … Steve could barely wrap his head around what Tony was. He was worried to death about Bucky, but as hard as he tried to ignore it, thoughts of Tony drifted in and out of his mind.
“Um…” Well, there was that one time, but that was interrupted by Doom testing running one of his robots of mass destruction. What about that time after- No, Fury had called them in for a covert mission. God, had it really been that long ago? “I can’t remember. I’m sorry, Steve. I know I need to put more effort into being a better boyfriend.”
Didn’t matter. Tony could figure that out later once he was dry and his scales were gone. But one thing was for sure, Captain America was finally coming home. And nobody, not even Captain America could know that Tony Stark; genius, playboy, millionaire, merman was the one who found him.
As he passed Clint on the way out, Phil reached into his jacket pocket for something. “Thank you for the conversation Mr. Barton. Here’s my card. Call if you ever need anything,” Phil handed it over with a wink, before closing what was left of the building door behind him.
Tony rolled over as much as the cot would allow so he could get a better look at his boyfriend. Steve sat on the other side of the small plane, running a still gloved hand through a mop of brown hair. A scrawny boy no older than seven slept soundly in Steve’s lap.
To his relief, Steve was one of the first things he could make out as he quickly scanned the area. His beautiful hair was rumpled, there was blood splattered across his cheek, and his face was a mask of pure rage. But other than that, Steve looked fine.
“Hey, kid,” said Steve. He walked back over to the other side of the plane and ran a calming hand through the wild mess of brown hair. “Did you sleep well?”
Rumlow stood in shock for a second; and fell like a sack of brick, screaming as he clawed at his injured skull. His dark brown hair turned black and wet. Flush, red blood flowed down the side of his face and puddled on the floor. Concussion and possibly fractured skull.
“Don’t need to tell me twice,” Natasha said. “And if anyone did say anything bad about you-”
Tony frowned. “Lucky shot,” he mumbled, leaning over to check the body. Still alive, but he’d be out for a good few minutes.
That only made Tony’s confusion worse. “How? Accidental baby from a night gone wrong? Badly made clone? Wait, don’t tell me. He’s Clint’s clone.”
“My place,” ordered Steve. “We are going to celebrate your accomplishment like normal people and you are going to enjoy it.”
“That’s enough. You two need to settle down right now!” Steve boomed. “Bruce,” said Steve, trying to get them back on track. “Care to update us on our situation? Have you figured out a way to get this little guy back yet?” asked Steve, shifting Tony up and out of sight of his elder counterpart.
“I am, Tony,” she said, eying the paper.
“Look at the big picture Pep.”
But, Rhodey was having none of it. He tried again. “Friend of Steve?”
“You’re incorrigible Tony, though I doubt you even know that it means,” she responded, not bothering to move away from his approach.
Steve mouthed unexplainable emotions as he tried to make sense of it all. “Overwhelmed is one,” he said honestly. Seeing Tony all proper and business like, and the swanky place he worked, Steve didn’t understand how Tony could resist bragging about it to every soul he met. All flash, bang, boom; most people would kill for a position like Tony’s. “Why didn’t you feel you could tell me?”
“Maybe. But he’s told me more than enough,” Tony said, eyeing the signs of mistreatment that littered the werewolf’s body. A limp in his left paw, matted fur, skin thin enough to see bones, bloodshot eyes clouded in feral rage, this werewolf had seen his fair share of abuse and he wasn’t about to trust a human like him anytime soon.
“You’re hurting… I need to…”
Tony raised an eyebrow in inquisitive interest. “Friend?” he asked, stretching his neck out a bit to get a better look.
Steve looked up at Tony and then looked around. This had to be a mistake, right? There was no way Tony was talking to him. The Dance of Fertility wasn’t just any old dance. It was for couples, specifically for couples hoping for a fruitful relationship. Surely Tony was talking to someone else. But no one else was around. All his friends had left him in lieu of the dance or in pursuit of more beer.
On the fourth ring, Tony picked up the phone. “You’ve reached the living replica of Anthony Edward Stark. Your call will only be answered if interesting enough,” he said, spreading the sarcasm like a thick layer of butter. He really didn’t want to be dealing with stuff this early in the morning. Getting shot in the shoulder made his feelings even more so.
Abruptly, Thor stiffened and stopped. “Did you hear that?” he whispered, holding out a hand to stop the others from their work.
“Your secretary?” Stane’s eyebrow was raised all the way up to his nonexistent hairline.
There, perfectly frozen in time, was the legendary Captain America. Bright red boots were tangled in a military green parachute. The red, white, and blue of his uniform had faded over time, but the fabric looked as strong and as sturdy as the day it came off the line. The white star that stretched across the width of his broad, beautiful chest sparkled in the early morning moonlight. His lips and skin were as pale and as perfect as freshly fallen snow, while his golden hair haloed around head making him look like an angel descending down from heaven.
Steve was right. Their day was filled with everything and nothing and it was absolutely amazing. After an amazing breakfast in bed, Tony rubbed sunscreen all across Steve’s back and into the hard to reach part of Steve’s ass, leading to very awkward sex on the beach. (
All of a sudden, Tony started having trouble breathing. He felt his heart flutter in his chest. Tony wanted to take Steve’s warm hands in his. He wanted Steve to wrap his arms around him for real. He wanted to feel warm. Tony wanted to be close to Steve and he had no idea why.
In the middle of the room was a single wooden chair. IN the chair sat the man. A stream of blood ran down the side of his face and dripped onto the floor. His face was swollen as if he had too much food forcefully stuffed into his cheeks. His hands were bound behind his back in a heavy rope that burned the soft skin underneath like fire.
There was another knock. More insistent this time. “Steve? Steve! Wake up Steve! Computer Jarvis says you’re in there. Steve? STEEEVE!”
Natasha feigned annoyance. “Please. I’m a big girl Steve. Found myself a real job and everything. Pays well too.” she said with a smile, as if finally settling into her own skin.
Morgan grinned. “I made a picture” she said, showing off a drawing made with all the crude creativity of a five-year-old. Which, to be fair, she was. “See? That’s you and me and daddy.”
Tony shrugged. “No really.” He had more important things to worry about. Blond, angry things.
The side of Steve’s lips hooked up into a shy smile. He placed a warm hand on Tony’s glove and gave it an affectionate squeeze. “Promise.”
"I'm out!" yelled Sam, retreating back from a last ditch attempt at a return hit.
“Boss,” Clint grunted, pushing aside a bullet riddled table and some rubble. “Next time you want to test us, give us a warming first. I think I might’a broke something.”
As he passed a row that looked like every other before it, he heard a familiar whirring of power. He looked and saw a small circular glow of power lighting up a larger figure. Only a few paces from him stood another metal man similar to War Machine. But this one was different. This one was painted a vibrant shade of red with rich gold accents. Steve’s eyes narrow and his shoulders tightened.
“Yeah, and I did,” she replied flippantly.
“Toast?”
Without a word, Steve nodded his approval. Tony’s lips twitched up into a weak smile as he reached for his tie. Steve’s sharp eyes caught the small tremble in Tony’s fingers as he loosened the intricate knot around his neck. With practiced fingers, Tony removed his tie and let the silk fabric slip down to the floor between his fingers. Next came the buttons. Deft fingers worked each ivory button open until Tony’s entire chest was exposed.
Good luck to all the writers out there. Hope the next update is worth the wait.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No,” Steve insisted. “We can take care of ourselves.” Didn’t matter what Tony proposed, Steve had considered every possibility and this was the best one of the bad lot. Granted, this idea was seeming less optimal with each passing second, but Steve didn’t see much of a choice.
Thank god for Steve's friends interrupting when they did. Tony’s brain had sparked the idea for a toaster at the last salvageable second, yes, but he had gotten stuck in rambling mode as soon as he retracted from the embrace. And a whole lot of shit often came out on that mode. Like how while Steve carefully drew him, Tony fantasized Steve forcing him up against the wall and fucking him dry as Steve eye groped him between kisses with those sharp blue eyes. He would use those big, working hands to milk them both dry as Tony screamed and clawed his way through-
This missing piece of Steve’s memory plagued him day and night. It was like that feeling you get when you forget something important. That deep sense of wrong you feel just before you leave the house. You put your hand on the door handle and think, “Did I forget something? I have everything I need, but I feel like I forgot something.” And you can’t think of it. And you try and you try, but nothing comes to mind. So, you leave home, and in the middle of the day, when you need that thing the most, you remember. You left it on the table so you could pick it up in the morning and why couldn’t you remember this earlier? It was so important how could you forget?
“Hey,” Tony said, his voice crackling like an old radio.
She would know. Natasha would know better than most; losing not only her family, but her country in the Russian revolution. And like the Natasha back then, running away from the revolutionaries in the black of night, across the cold Eurasian terrain, Steve didn’t have time to dwell on it. He had to keep moving if he wanted to survive.
“What? It’s true.” True except the name. The Engineer did get hit with a Stark shrapnel bomb (military grade. It was supposed to be in the testing stages), landing Tony with a chest full of metal. By all accounts, he should have died, heck he almost did. But Yinsen and Bruce, god bless Bruce Banner, did enough of a patch job that Tony recovered enough to finish the job himself.
Steve laughed at that. “How about you? Is your name really Tony?”
“Thirty two hours ago,” replied Pepper, walking into the lab. “And that’s not even close to the record.”
Tony held back and exasperated sigh. This is what he got for working with gossipy women. “You don’t even smoke.”
Raising an eyebrow, she shifted her weight to one side. “You mean the desk in your locked workshop.”
“Why not both?”
Rhodey awkwardly shuffled the armor around so Tony could see the sincerity in his friend’s dark brown eyes. “You’re not just our boss, you’re my best friend Tones. So forgive me if I had no desire to make it any worse.”
“You have nothing to be sorry about,” said Rhodey, rubbing gentle circles into Tony’s back. “Come on, Clint. Let’s go. You guys on the other hand,” he said, giving Steve and Tony very pointed looks. “Whatever’s going on between you two, you need to figure this out.”
“No time like the present,” the man said with a confident bounce. “I also don’t know the next time I’ll get to see you so…”
In Tony’s dream, Steve would be more than happy to hop on board with that. He seemed like that kind of guy. Ideally, Steve would be in the back kitchen, cooking some healthy and hearty dish that his mamma passed down to him, while Tony managed the people in the front. Or, it could be the other way around. Steve, with his big smile and gorgeous blue eyes making small talk and winning people over with his good nature; while Tony was in the back making pots black because (let’s face it) Tony wasn’t too experienced in the kitchen. Of course, fires in the kitchen would mean Steve would have to come back and save him every once in a while. Big strong arms, throwing water to put of the fire, getting Tony soaked to the bone, slowly striping the his clothes off so Tony wouldn’t catch cold. Steve would do that for Tony.
Bruce huffed. The ridiculous things his family did that he silently put up with. “Why do you even care?” he asked, genuinely curious.
Tony charged forward and banged at the ice with his powerful tail. He attacked the small glacier over and over, but the ice was too thick and too old to be broken by such simple means. Something else, something else had to break the ice. Why didn’t he bring any tools with him? Why had he decided to leave his suit shipside? All he needed was to hook it up to the RT, hit it with a hard enough blast, and then…
“We can’t do nothing Steve,” Bucky whispered, biting into an apple. “Parks are public property.  Can’t start a fight on open turf. We got a rep to keep intact.”
The wolf attacked the bars; growling and spitting with the desperation of someone who hadn’t eaten in days.
Bruce clipped the end of the last stitch and Tony rubbed at the sore injury. “I hate you,” he grumbled.
“Bucky,” he murmured as if the name was part of a holy prayer. “Come on Buck, please be okay.”
“Hey, big guy. I brought breakfast,” Tony said, showing off the tray of meat pressed against his hips.
When the man’s face changed to a hue that bordered on blue, Steve threw him head first into the nearby wall. The man cried out as bone cracked against the wood. His head bounced off the surface like a baseball as he staggered back. He teetered about for a few seconds as he tried to find his balance.
“Steve?” Tony waved a hand in front of his eyes. “Kinda leaving me hanging here…”
“Fumbling like a drunken fool. And then you have to nerve to barricade yourself into your lab, leaving me and Obie to deal with the falling out.”
“Always looking out for me Bruce.”
"You're not telling me everything," said Steve. Sam's eye widened in surprise. Yup, definitely more. Steve watched quietly as his wingman closed off from him, crossing his arms and stealing his mouth with a defiant line. Was it really that important that Steve didn't know? Was it really worth the secretary to keep Steve in the dark?
The werewolf looked up, but said nothing as Tony walked past the doggy door and headed straight for the locked gate. It took him a few minutes to pick the bolt (drunk Tony couldn’t remember where he’d left the keys) but when the lock finally clicked open, Tony burst into the enclosure like he was the fucking Kool-Aid Man.
Really? This again? “No, you want a fully functional weapon in the little more than a week  that I’ve been here,” replied Tony, sliding out from under the mess. He felt pissed and a little betrayed as he set his tools down on one of the workbenches. “Is that what I am to you Obie? A weapons factory? I’m hurt. I thought we were past the one-night stands with my guns and into romantic walks on the beach.”
be wise old black men, now can we?” sassed Tony.
Natasha hummed. “Thought so. That’s why I brought back up.”
“Why don’t you join the others on the dance floor?” suggested Tony. “Be a lot more fun than standing by a boring truck waiting on little old me.”
Tony closed his eyes and held back a sigh. He could already tell this was going to be a long lesson. Thank god Steve was cute. “You don’t have to be so gentle. You’re not going to break it.”
Tony shrugged, distracting himself with an assortment of wires and switches. In a voice quiet enough that Steve almost missed it, Tony mumbled, “Didn’t want you making a big deal out of it or taking advantage of me.”
“Obie?” Tony covered his ear to hear better. “Where are you? What the hell is going on over there?”
The wolf didn’t respond. Then again, he never responded to anything. Unless he was angry. Which seemed to be most of the time.
“Hi,” said Tony, because that’s all his brain could think to say in this situation.
“Tony.”
Rumlow’s eyes raked over the weapon suspiciously. Squaring his shoulders, he looked up at Schmidt, a small smirk lifting one side of his face. “Sure is a pretty doll you got there boss. You sure you trust me with her?”
Steve let out a heavy sigh and laid his head down on the armrest. “I don’t know what my point is, but I guess what I’m saying is, I miss you.”
“No! Of course not. They’re the ones who dared me to come over here in the first place. I wouldn’t have said anything otherwise.” Steve turned his head to the side, trying to hide his embarrassment. “You… uh… you have a way of taking a guy’s breath away.”
Steve whined as Tony burrowed into the werewolf’s molten hot heat.
“No,” Tony said between violent hiccups. “Daddy.”
“What the- Steve, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you. I just… Oh god. Please, whatever is happening, I didn’t mean it.” Tony pressed his hand against the scruff of Steve’s neck, but the werewolf shoved him off.
“Oh!”
“Cute,” Bruce muttered, brushing off the comment. As he was quietly put away his supplies, another question came out. “Is this about that doll you’ve been seeing lately?”
Tony grimaced at the answer. “We have dad’s genetics. What else am I supposed to look like?”
“Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t kick the daylight out of you.”
‘No,’ Tony though, pushing the protest to the back of his mind. ‘Figure this shit out first, then go after Steve. Wouldn’t do either of them any good if he was dead.’
Pepper sighed. “I thought-” She stopped midsentence, trying to figure out the best way to say what was on her mind. “You’ve been so stressed the last couple of days. I thought bringing Steve up would help. Whenever you had a spare second, you’d go on and on about him. When I found him in the lobby, I thought-” Her voice died out, running out of ways to say what she felt.
Steve hummed as he crawled back on the bed to cuddle Tony. “I don’t know. Maybe a morning blow job? I hear it’s all the rage these days. And it looks like this part of you is the only part I can reward for getting up on time,” Steve said, nudging Tony’s cock.
“Spread out,” he heard a muffled voice call out as hard boots stomped across the cold floor.” I want to see the floors covered in their blood within the next five minutes.”
“What?,” he askes with an innocent smile. “It was Steve’s idea.”
Boom!
Tony rolled his eyes. “It’s really simple. Adults are always saying I can be anything I want. Well, since I can’t be Captain America, I’ll just have to be your wife when I grow up.”
In Schmidt’s hands was a weapon Tony swore he had taken off the production line weeks ago. The prosthetic arm Tony had designed and sent off with Obie as an afterthought was now in Schmidt’s greedy hands; bigger and stronger than any sketch Tony had sent down to R&D. The fingers on the hand had been altered and reinforced with a heavy metal; now made for breaking necks and spilling blood. The sight of shoddy workmanship, exposed gears, pistons, and metal gleaming in cold in the light, sent shivers down his spine. What was this monstrosity?
“Why are you making bets in my love life? Don't we have our work cut out for us already?”
"Shut up. It’s sweet," Jane whispers back. And Steve doesn’t even what to think about what that meant.
“Is that… could that be…” Bucky mumbled.
“I don’t need that kind of help Obie. I just,” he saw something gold pass by just beyond his line of sight. “It’s personal. I need to take care of this myself.”
The wolf looked at him from behind a tree and growled.
mean nothing to them?
Steve snapped to attention. Tony? Was it really Tony? Steve had been absentmindedly scanning the park, but Tony was the last thing he expected to see out here. His clothes were to nice to fit Steve’s original profile. But the distinctive facial hair,  Steve would recognize that anywhere. He was dressed to the nines compared to when Steve saw him last. Bright red dress shirt and pressed pants made him stick out in brown neighborhood. Couldn’t be Tony. Could it? What was Tony doing here of all places?
“Nothing,” grumbled Tony, jamming a switch on the suit. A red light flashed on, indicating the built in radio was alive and receiving. Screw radio silence. He was going to get to the bottom of this if it was the last thing he did.
“Okay, new plan,” said Steve as he thought aloud. “Tony, you stay here. I’ll look for him. Rhodey, tell Bruce to come back here and check to make sure Tony is okay. I’m still a bit worried about him.”
“Not now Obie,” Tony said, trying to brush off his mentor’s touch. “I’m busy. Need to find someone.”
Steve couldn’t understand. He could barely comprehend it when he was awake. How could anyone love him? He was stubborn and impulsive. He worked too hard. He didn’t take directions well. He had problems with authority. He carried the weight of the world on his shoulders and had a hard time letting people in. Who in their right mind would love someone like him?
Steve shook his head. “I’m not done with him,” Steve muttered. “He still needs to talk. He needs to tell me why he hurt Bucky.”
Steve was special. He made Tony’s steps lighter and his heart sing whenever he was near and long after they had parted ways. Steve’s presence alone made every moment they spent together special and bright. Tony would be damned if he lost that. After Steve dropped him off (wherever that was) Tony planned to leave Steve in radio silence until the shit storm passed. In the grand scheme of things, better to lose him now and hope for forgiveness than to lose him forever in a power struggle and beg for his life as Steve’s life blood flowed down the river. Maybe, if they were lucky, they could pick up back up later. Obviously, Steve would be mad that Tony had left him in the dust. Maybe even livid, but Tony would slowly coax Steve to see his side of the story. How he was a martyr in all this white collar, mob boss mess, and Steve would come round.
Guess it worked.
The man raised a well-groomed eyebrow. “Religious?”
Steve looked up.
“But I wanna help.”
“You got it doc.” Tony gave a salute to his hired muscle as he descended back down to the basement to continue his interrogation.
Steve sighed, the tension surging back into his broad shoulders. “Just because we’ve hit a dry spell doesn’t mean we have money problems.”
“It’s just… I don’t know how to describe it,” Tony sputtered. “I know logically he’s a younger version of me and none of what he’s doing has any dramatic consequence on my life, but it’s so embarrassing. It’s like remembering the super fan boy version of myself from ages ago, only it’s not a memory. It’s real and everyone around me is encouraging his shitty fan boy behavior. Doing stupid things. Telling embarrassing stories. Talking your ear off because he’s so excited that his greatest hero, Captain America, is taking the time to listen to him.
Tony laughed. “Pep would love it if I eloped. Be hell to explain our secret nuptials to the press, but planning a wedding and all the drama leading up to it will be ten times worse. Every press conference or interview from here on out will be focused on us. Who’s on the guest list? Where is it at? Are we going to have a traditional wedding in a church or a modern venue? What are we going to wear? Who’s designing it? Is Steve going to wear his uniform from the war? What about suits? What color are the suits going to be? Am I going to be a drama queen and insist on a dress?
Tony smirked. “Thank you Peppermint.”
“Fine!” Sam threw his hands up in defeat. “If that's how you want to play, you take Tony and I'll stick with Barns.”
Tony was not going to give him the time of day. “What in the world makes you say that?”
“Yeah, but at what cost?” challenged Bucky. “It’s not secret that when little guys like us start making deals with big guys like them, they get targets painted on the back of their head. An’ with what trouble the Iron Family be russlin’ up with Hydra; I’d rather not get caught up in that shit storm.”
“Tony, honey, that’s not exactly how this works,” Natasha said, placing a gentle hand on his arm.
Steve’s stunned silence seemed to unnerve Tony. "If you don't like it, let me know. I mean, I like it, but I don’t know if you like it. I heard artists are picky about their supplies. I can whatever you usually get instead if you want. Or something better. I'm sure I can get something better for you, but it might take a few days with my work schedule,” he rambled. “Maybe something from France. I don’t know how many places are selling art supplies right now, with the depression and all, but I’m sure I can find something you like. France is home to all the great artists, or at least that’s what Pepper says, so I’m pretty sure they have some quality supplies there too.”
Steve’s face lit up.
Steve chuckled as he cracked some eggs into a bowl. Good old Peg.
“Natasha.” Without thinking of how he looked or how he smelled, he stood up and embraced his old friend. Her arms immediately went up to protect the food offerings, but Steve didn’t mind. What mattered to him, at this moment, was a friendly face and a trustworthy comrade.
Suddenly, the rain of bullets stopped.
“Oh?”
“I’ve laughed before. You’ve just never heard it because we’ve been busy.”
“Almost got them.”
“Exactly.” Tony breathed a sigh of relief. Finally, Steve was starting to come around. One last battle to face and maybe one more step to reconciliation. “A few months ago, somebody stole something really big and really bad. Worse than a few grenades. This weapon, it hurt a lot of people and caused a lot of damage. I’m here; dressed up like an idiot to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”
Tony’s first move was to get into the light. Draw Steve’s attention to the Iron Man suit (and Jarvis had said it was a rather stupid idea making an obnoxious red and gold suit), and then get the fuck out of dodge.
Steve planted his face into the crook of Iron Man’s shoulder. His ears were the same shade of red as the armor. “Don’t know,” he mumbled. “The mind plays cruel tricks when on the brink of death.” He gave the armor one last reassuring squeeze before pulling back. Just a little. Just enough so his chest wasn’t pressing into the heat of the still warm arc reactor.
“Tony! Is that you?” Stane’s crackling voice yelled over the din in the background.
“Watch me,” Tony said defiantly as he walked toward the elevator. As much as he wanted to chase after Steve, that would have to wait. If he wanted something as massive as shutting down his company, he needed to do it himself and it needed to be done yesterday. Yes, it would be bad for business and the stocks, but if he could pull it off-
He had to give Tony some grief though. It was Tony, not another eager body wanting to show off and get into his pants. It’s not as if he was trying to flirt with Tony. Grief was a necessary part of the ‘artist and model relationship’. Of course it was. “Models need to hold still for hours on end, and from what little I’ve seen of you, you’re not too good at that part.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now?!”
Tony looked over Steve’s shoulder to see the guys who rudely interrupted them. There had been little time for introductions as the very well-built blonde one (who looked more like a god than an actual human) rushed off to fetch a steak and some ice. The injured party looked like a hobo off the streets rather than someone who could be considered Steve’s friend, let alone the roommate Steve had brusquely introduced him as. Eyes like an assassin that one, and greasy mess of long brown bangs that flopped over his eyes. Tony would guess the guy’s hair  was normally slicked back and well kept, but the lack of appearance could be attributed to whomever gave him that shiner on his face (or whatever caused it.) Must have been a bad brawl considering the severe limp he came in with and the way each breath he took looked painful and labored. Seeing the anxiety on Steve’s face made him feel nervous too. Tony tried to offer some form of advice to ease Steve’s apprehension.
So, with a heavy sigh, Tony hopped up on the ledge. He looked both ways, and when he was sure no one was watching, Tony dove down into the arctic waters.
“Must be Tony,” Sam said as he scrubbed the blood off his own hands. “Saw him dragging a body off earlier. Kept muttering something about making them pay.”
Steve huffed at Tony’s audacity. But he looked like he was enjoying himself. A marked improvement from what Steve saw in the park. Tony’s fingers flew like city pigeons as they dismantled the heater piece by piece. His eyes were different than in the park. His brow was still furrowed, but Steve’s keen eyes picked up the differences. In the park, the lines were deep and more pronounced, sign of frustration as he dug his ideas into the dirt. Now, they were tense with focused and deep thought. Tony’s eyes were steady and bright as steel, as they darted across the different parts of the machine. He looked so perfect. He looked so right. This wasn't about appearances for the sake of potential courting. This was about seeing something beautiful being laid out in front of him like an orange in a Christmas stocking. Something precious and pure
Tony rubbed the back of his neck with a nervous hand. “Well-”
“’m fine,” Tony said, barely moving his lips. “All numb now.” The arc reactor still felt strange in his chest, but everything else was a pulsing numb sensation.
Steve looked down as his cheeks flushed a light pink. “He’s really not that bad.”
But what if Bruce couldn’t fix it? What if Tony had finally done enough damage that things couldn’t be fixed. Maybe it was too late. Maybe the damage done tonight as well as the damage from nights before had finally tipped the scale so out of his favor. Maybe he had passed the point of no return. All those hours, all that hard work trying to taking responsibility for his actions only for it to blow up in his face; Tony couldn’t stand the thought.
“This is all your fault, you know that right?” Sam whispered, giving Tony an accusing glare.
Pepper didn’t say anything. She just brushed his hair in silence and let him feel sad. She had known Tony long enough to know that words wouldn’t help him right now. Tony felt it was true and nothing she said would make him think otherwise.
From underneath the iconic red and gold metal helmet that encased his head, Iron Man, new money mob boss of the Iron Family, surveyed the situation.
Pepper rolled her eyes. “First time you did that, I thought you were giving me the opportunity of a lifetime. Now, I just see it as you being lazy.”
He was about three meters from the door when something soft and furry bumped up against his side. Tony looked down to see, who else, Steve, heading him away from the door like a guide dog.
“Well,” said Steve with a smile as he passed Tony a glass. “Guess we’ll be criminals together.”
The tips of Steve’s ears turned red. “I like ‘em as much as the next guy,” Steve said. “I like filling ‘em or being filled. I also like eating out the jelly before eating the donut if you know what I mean.”
To his displeasure, a brown haired bimbo with a pile of paperwork stood between him and the elevator. Her shoulder length hair looked familiar only in passing. What was her name again? Daisy? Ms. Johnson? Skye? Someone had called her that in a break room, right?
“If just fine you mean ‘we got out a hairs breath away from death,’ then I would agree,” grumbled Rhodey, his hand grazing against the cold heat strapped to his side.
A bang on the door disrupted Steve’s whirlwind of thoughts. In a daze,  he got up and answered the door. Bucky's slowly bruising face quickly brought his focus back to the now.
a civilian should have. A single, large man stood guard over the exit. He had a spine tingling glint in his eye that Tony had seen in too many men just itchin’ for a fight.
“No, you listen for once,” Steve interrupted with a stern voice. “I’m gonna get outta harm’s way like you want, but I’m going to do it my way. Before I get gone, I’m gonna pump these bastards so full of lead that they sink like rocks in the river. And if I just so happen to be following you, well, so be it.”
Tony’s side of the line had gone deathly quiet. If not for the white noise in his ear, Steve would swear that Tony had hung up on him. “Um,” Steve held the phone in a death grip. Tony sounded so small and quiet. Nothing like his usual larger than life personality. “You should get going. I got some people getting on my ass about work right about now.”
“Don’t worry," Tony said with reassuring smile. "I’ll make you proud Obie.”
“I’m sure,” reassured Steve.
“Tony?” gasped Steve, looking up through the blood and grim running down his face.
Slipping the shiv away, Steve joined the huddled circle of heads.
Happy shrugged. “You do have a history of making very bad choices when left to your own devices. And we do have a very recent hit to be concerned about."
Morgan rolled her eyes. “Because daddy’s famous. All famous people wear sunglasses.”
Steve ducked his head, trying to hide the full body flush as his heart threatened to beat out of his chest. “Even if I’m not the tallest or the strongest?” he asked.
“I don’t know, but it’s in the back of Schmidt’s car. I swear,” Clint voice crackled over the radio. “They’re gonna let it go any second now.”
The man whistled. “Damn, and I thought Boston was bad.”
Tony shook the thoughts out of his head as the elevator doors opened to reveal the lavish lobby. No, he had to believe what he was doing was right. Going after Steve now may make things worse, but it was the right thing to do. No matter what, he had to make sure Steve would be safe. If push came to shove, Tony would kidnap Steve himself. He’d keep Steve safe in one of his mansions, while exacting revenge in the name of Steve Rogers. And if Steve didn’t like it, he’d ask for forgiveness later.
Tony cleared his throat. Thank goodness Steve wasn’t the only one nervous. “Short version, it’s a machine that keeps me alive. I had to install in myself after the Ten Rings gang hit my Boston hideout with a Jericho missile.”
“We gonna take it or what?”
“Sure boss,” chirped Clint. “What ‘cha need?”
“Why don’t we start by deflating the dough,” suggested Tony. He needed something, anything to distract him from ogling how beautiful Steve was up close. Tony reached down and grabbed a metal bowl covered in a white cloth from under the counter. He pulled back the worn towel to reveal a plump, white dough. After a quick poke to the surface, Tony gently plopped the well risen ball onto a well-floured surface.
“Whatever you like,” said Stane with a smile. “Although, the investors would always appreciate something that sells.”
The hairs on the back of Steve’s neck stood up. What in name of all that was good and holy was this thing? Is this what the Iron Family had forced Tony to work on?
Tony nodded. “Yup yup. What about you? You’re walking a little funny. Did you trip on something?”
“Where do you think you’re going Red?” asked a familiar angry voice.
“Hey kid, think fast!” yelled Clint as he threw the doll like a football right into the kid’s hands.
will continue as planned; slowly introducing new stimuli to help him adjust, use his name whenever we visit him, maybe if you have something with a familiar scent, we can throw that in the enclosure, but it’s risky.”
get away with something like that.”
Tony tumbled out of the wolf’s embrace like an uncoordinated puppy. He whirled around, expecting Steve to look hurt or at least offended at Tony’s departure. Instead, Steve was shaking like a scared deer. He whimpered and pawed furiously at his face as if trying to claw something off his muzzle. His back paws dug into the ground like he was trying to dig his feet into something he couldn’t quite get a hold of.
“Wow,” Tony whispered, unable to resist pressing a hand to the ice. “You’re beautiful.”
“Yes we do, but we don’t tells Mr. Ross that,” Tony said, beaming with pride at his little trouble maker. “Now, go put on your tutu. Steve’s going to take you to ballet practice.”
Steve’s head whipped around. “Are you shitting me?”
“Who said I was giving you a choice?” Steve asked, a mischievous smile curling up the side of his face. Without warming, Steve ran out from their hiding spot, waving his hands and screaming like a maniac.
The moment Morgan Stark perfected her drawing, she ran straight to the living room to show it off.
“Would you keep it down,” hissed Rhodey. “Kid’s asleep. Do you remember how long it took before Steve finally got him to shut up?”
There was another crunch of gravel. And another. The rapid crunching of stones under feet made it sounded like an army was forming right outside the thin metal door.
A familiar flash of light out of the corner of his eye, and the bullets stopped.
Despite bad visibility, Tony could see that the blast radio was huge. Solid concrete had been upturned from its flat state and was now jutting out of the ground into a silhouette that rich people might say was “modern art.” Large chunks of shrapnel were strewn about the radius in a deathly ripple pattern. And while most of the smaller pieces had bounced off the armor, some larger pieces had embedded themselves into deep into the metal suit.
Tony led them to the werewolf enclosure to find Steve midway through his morning patrol of the small territory.
“Nah, I just like to see you panic like a scared chicken,” Clint said with a mischievous wink. “Just reporting back from recon. Most of the good parts of town are taken, but there are some small time street gangs in the Lower East Side that we can easily take out. Not optimal for business, but we can make it work if we advertise right.”
“Come on,” insisted Clint. “It’s perfect. Give him something to cling to so you can get your boyfriend back.”
“Just the opposite,” said Steve, expecting the reply before it left the doctor’s lips. “We want your silence. The Iron Family has run into a few disagreements with some of the local gangs-”
“Shut up, you big idiot,” Steve said, pushing that stupid look out of his sight. “I’m being emotional and you’re just stilling here cracking jokes. What kind of boyfriend are you?”
Steve closed his eyes and let out a heavy groan. “I know it’s not right, but I really, really want to break his neck.”
Only a few hours after his encounter with the illusive Phil, Steve realized that he never got a reply from Tony. In his embarrassed adrenaline high state, Steve had planted a rushed kiss and dashed off to find a cab before he could get turned down. But would Tony have turned him down? Tony hadn’t kissed him back, he hadn’t said ‘I love you too,’ but he had definitely shown signs that he wanted to do so before the firefight that fated night. Didn’t he? The thoughts of doubt assaulted his psyche so bad that the next morning he sprinted to the nearest phone to call St. Mary’s Hospital.
“We wait,” said Steve. His voice sounded foreign even to his ears. “It’s all we can do.”
“No,” Steve was looking away from Tony like the filth that he is. “Did you hear that?”
He cast a glance at Steve, a snarky comment about how incorrigible kids were already on his lips, but when he saw Steve smiling at him, the words died in his throat.
“No!” He yelled. his face turning scarlet. His objection was so loud, a few people on the dance floor stopped and turned toward the donut truck. But when nothing interesting happened, they returned to their business.
“Then what were you drawing in the dirt? You said there was something there, and I can clearly see some sort of outline from here.”
“Other than that, right as rain, right?” Tony asked as he swung his legs back and forth under the cot.
“Hey, you laughed. Never heard you laugh before.”
Clint nodded. “One hundred percent cotton Captain America plush. Made right here in the gold old US of A. No chop action, but it’s soft as fuck.”
Rhodey snorted in amusement. “I’m sure it does.”
Pepper smiled. “Oh I know you do. I don’t doubt it considering all the unsavory memories I have of kicking your late night houseguests out.”
Pepper tried her best not to look like she wanted to throttle him. “There’s a lot of paperwork that goes through this company, and the reports seem to have gotten ‘lost’ in the mail.”
Which was fine. It didn’t bother him. Didn’t matter that his teammates thought Stark was a right bastard. They thought Iron Man was a hero, a team player, a good guy. So what if they didn’t know Iron Man and Tony Stark were the same person? Made it easier for him to keep his secrets. Keep his distance. Keep the world from knowing a creature like
“If I were you, I would be hurt,” Tony replied with an exaggerated pout. “How would I have time for anyone special? I’ve spent almost all my time in New York working.”
“We are, but we’re super famous and super famous people don’t need sunglasses.”
“Maybe in a few hours. I’m too tired to adult,” Tony said with a loud yawn before rolling over.
“Oh Tony,” her soft voice held all the heartache that Tony wished he could say in so few words.
Tony almost lost it. “You let them touch my stuff!” he yelled into the phone. “You know I hate it when R&D touches my stuff. They always add things that are a pointless waste of space and take away things vital for effective operation.”
“Tell me!”
“Hey bratwurst! Do us all a favor and ship yourself back to Germany. I’m sure Hitler would love a new red faced lap dog,” the onlooker shouted with a laugh.
“So? What’s the big deal?” His normal snappish attitude was heavily clouded in the dozy haze of waking up. Tony rolled his head so it faced the floor. He dragged a lazy finger against the grain of floor. Were there always so many small stones embedded into the cement? “Steve found out,” he murmured, not bothering to look up.
I was going to say this is one of my longest chapters ever and that we'll go back to shorter chapters after this, but my revised draft of chapter 8 says a big fat no. Basically, btw chapters may be late because after the next chapter, it's brand new writing.
“I can’t say for sure, but I have a hunch,” said an unfamiliar voice. An average Joe stepped out from behind Clint. An unassuming suit with a receding hairline and a simple smile. He was very well put together despite the prior fray. “I saw some cars parked on the side of the road before I came in. Didn’t think too much about it, but I’m pretty sure I saw a few faces belonging to the Hydra gang.”
The entirety of his plan relied on that simple fact. He had to get Steve alone. If this
“You can touch it if you want,” Tony said when Steve showed no sign of looking away. “But it’s fine if you don’t. Lots of people don’t like looking at it.”
“You think there’s more to get out?” Rhodey leaned back against a workstation.
“Yeah, she can be pretty scary sometimes,” Sam said with a strained chuckle. “Hey, let me know if anything happens with Bucky. I’ll keep an eye on Cap for now. The way he’s acting… I worry about him.”
Tony stared at Rumlow in stunned silence as smoke hissed of the man’s back and slithered up into the rafters. “What the hell was that about Steve?” Tony asked between shallow gasps. “You could have been killed.”
“Friend of your gal?”
“Bucky.”
How much time did he have?
“Well, not really his card. He only started working here a few weeks ago, so he couldn’t give me one with his name on it.” Steve rambled. How could he say he really needed to get in to see Tony without sounding like a stalker?
He curled in on himself. “I tried to go after him. I really did. But I couldn’t find him. I wasn’t fast enough. I wasn’t strong enough. Story of my life I guess.”
“If we did do that, I’d at least make sure you had some sheet music so you have something to travel by,” said Bruce, cleaning up his supplies.
“… the wolf?” asked Bucky.
“Either way, their supply locations would be good to compare to any documents we have on record. See if anything our Hydra guest knows matches up to what we have on file. Think you can get that for me Bruce? Don't want to be knocking down the wrong doors. ”
“Tony?” Steve’s voice came out as no more than a whisper. He looked at Tony under lidded eyes, pupils blown wide into dark pools of desire.
“I didn’t know they were coming to the company, Stane just moved out of the office."
“Not us, Rhodey. We were supposed to be a team. We were supposed to stick together. The world depended on the avengers. Not on half of a team.” The rest of the team looked up, their eyes jumping from one another. It wasn’t like none of them didn’t think about it but they weren’t ready to admit it.
“There’s nothing here.” Sam unclenched his hands letting his weapons drop back into their proper places. But Steve wasn’t convinced. It was true that there was no one around, just the reminder that someone has been here. Then why was the computer still on? Why were the lights in the halls still in place properly.
"After Tony's disapperance, this company has become much more focused on speficially it's weapons and started to pull further away from the military. Are you sure this is what Tony wanted?"
“Yes?"
“Honey.” said Sarah when his hands fell and his eyes stared at the ground and his tear ducts welling up. Steve couldn’t believe that he could produce a sound.
Strucker made it clear that he saw the files personally and reviewed the information that could be visible to the next president. No one expected Rogers to take the lead and start investigating but Stane knew there was no way he was going to drop this.
“Winning an election always is serious business,” a voice boomed from the front door. Alexander Pierce stood tall in the door frame, blocking all the sunlight, casting a dark shadow on himself. For once, he was casually dressed as if he was getting ready for a vacation, ready to get away from all the campaign business.
"He have suspect you, but for him I'm just the competition that lost. He'll let me in that house." Pierce smiled.
Stane acted like a father to Tony ever since his parents died. That man has been with him the longest, he took care of him. He couldn’t have possibly sold out to HYDRA. Steve trusts him, Stane promised him that he would take good care of Tony’s company for him and he was the best person to do so. Stane has everything that he could possibly want, he would at least respect all the work Tony put into this. That’s what Steve thought. Its what he believes and he is willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. But Nick’s voice keep repeating in his head.
“But there is news.”
Nebula inched closer to Rocket who kept looking between her and the entrance. He needed more of his team to walk out, this wasn’t the time to play jokes.
“Has someone tried to create another one like it?” James stared at Steve. His brows pulled together as he tried to understand the question, his mind carefully pieces through his question.
“Who else knows about this?"
“Nat, please just hurry."
SHIELD started working the military, helping train the cadets in sleuth and rigorous combat. That was how Steve met Nick Fury. Slowly, SHIELD branched away from the military, creating its own organization motivated in protecting the governments secrets and keeping the world in balance. SHIELD walked away from the base and Steve went along. The entire organization was the main factor in many of Steve’s relationships.
“Thank you, I’ll let him know. “
He needs to bring him home.
"After all that, alive might not necessarily be the best choice." Nick's eye moving from Maria to Anna.
Let Skull speak. Be smart.
Behind him, Steve could hear heavy footsteps. The machines reactor was building up power as Natasha reached around the corner and shot the over large hammer towards it. It reacted, but not fast enough as the shot ripped the metal on the left arm revealing a clothed human arm.
“YOU! You are my problem! The accords aren’t the reason we aren’t together! You changed everything and never realized what you’ve done. My problem is you never considered to communicate with me. You just automatically assumed that I wouldn’t believe you. We weren’t together because you couldn’t imagine trusting any one of us.” The entire room went silent and looked at Steve.
“And we need to chat.” With that the conversation was over and Steve groaned into the mirror as he saw his sleepy face stare back at him. He knew what this chat was going to be about. He had been avoiding for a week. He was going to have to face it at one point.
-----
“A mistake?! He’s done missions before!"
“Yeah.”
cant do anything, there isn’t a
“How do we even begin fixing this?” Rhodey spoke to Bruce.
His back straightened, the blood stopped rushing, his heart slowed down. This was a set up.
“Mr. Fury.” Steve rubbed his eyes and shuffled his feet towards the door. A little chatter was coming through the hallway—the boys were already awake.
“Hold on Bucky.” A wrecked voice weakly echoed over the empty “help will be here soon.”
With a tired sigh, Tony caved. “We are talking about this later, right? This whole misunderstanding thing going on between us,” Tony said, motioning between their chests only inches apart.
Sam held up a hand to slow the conversation. “Wait, you’re actually going to go out looking for guns for us?”
The wolf made a low noise that, if Tony didn’t know any better, he’d almost assume the werewolf was laughing at him.
Steve cursed silently. Damn, Tony was sharp. “Yeah, just a friend,” he said casually.
"Jane said the next batch of Odin's Beer should be ready by week's end, but the Asgardian Mead will need until mid week of next before it is ready for consumption."
“Glad I could entertain you,” Steve chuckled.
“Phil Coulson. I’m an information broker for the local paper, The SHIELD Daily Update.” Phil offered his hand. Iron Man didn’t take it.
“You look like dad.”
The ride over to Tony’s speakeasy was a blur of noises and lights. All Steve could focus on was Bucky and how much pain he was in. Sweat rolled down his brow. Blood drained from his cheeks until his face was as white winter snow. Steve had sacrificed his suspender to make a tourniquet in an attempt to stop the blood, but it didn’t do much good. The bleeding slowed down, but it never stopped. With each bump in the road, another drop of blood fell to the metal floor; another drop of blood that Bucky needed to survive.
"Yes!" said Tony enthusiastically. He looked like he was about to take off for the moon. "Well, not literally, but the idea is still the same. See-"
“I’m married to Captain America!” Tony screamed.
Steve loved the fact that the room was always changing with the makeshift setup. Some weeks, the wall was hidden by a wall of wood, while other weeks Bucky would find it entertaining to make himself a throne with the empty boxes. Thor often made forts and wasn't that one hell of a month when they tried to conduct meetings. It wasn't a perfect setup, but it worked well enough for their mixed family .
“Wait, are you flirting with me?”
“I know what you’d probably say,” Tony said with a chuckle. “You’d probably tell me to pull my head out of my ass. There’s no use in crying over spilled milk. Go, gather myself up and carry on like the gentleman I was raised to be. There are people in this town that look up to me. That need me. I need to be strong for their sake.”
“Go ahead,” said Tony. He moved away from the workstation. “Give it a quick kneed and knock out some of the air. But not too much. We don’t want to ruin all our work from earlier.”
“Plus a bunch of others,” quipped another gargled voice. “And just so you know, as President of the ‘Steve Rogers is a Stubborn Asshole’ club, resumes must be submitted with a twenty five dollar processing payment.”
In the back of his head, he registered Pepper giving a stern whispering to Clint before a warm hand grazed his shoulder. “Tony,” Pepper said in that warm and wonderful voice that made him feel like everything would be okay. “For what it’s worth, I’m happy that you’re trying to move on.”
Hope drained from Tony’s eyes. “Why not?” he whined. “Is it because two men can’t get married? Is it because I’m too young?”
“This dump that you clearly live in. God I’m an idiot! Don’t listen to me. No, wait. Listen to me and slap me if I say something stupid like that again. Then again, don’t because if that was true Pepper would have slapped me five ways ‘till Sunday by now. God Tony, can you ramble more than you already do? I mean, I know I ramble when I’m working on stuff, or when I’m nervous, or when I’m drunk-”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam waved a hand, guilty as charged. “I called her in a few weeks ago,” Sam admitted. “Said you needed all the help you can get, so I called the best.”
Natasha sighed. The same type of sigh adults gave their children when telling them there were no monsters under the bed. “I told you Steve, don’t worry about it. I got information from a reliable source that the owners won’t notice a thing.”
“I see,” said Steve as he looked at the three figures drawn beneath a smiling sun. “You got my uniform right and I love your tutu, but why is your dad wearing sunglasses?”
Follow me on my tumbler and see all the shit I reblog.
“You’re going to have to be more specific, Jan. We met a lot of people in France,” said Tony, feigning ignorance.
“Yeah, you’re right,” Tony yawned, not able to stave off the fatigue for much longer. “I should sleep. Call this day a wash. Just… let me rest my eyes… for a few minutes. We can… talk about this more… in the morning…”
“Might not be possible boss.” Tony looked up just in time to see two figures, the mouthy brunette called Bucky and the lean redhead from earlier, climb up the rigging and onto the catwalk. Hawkeye’s signature bow slowly fell to his side as he reached for the knife hidden at the small of his back. “Looks like our guests aren’t too keen on makin’ nice.”
“In the meantime,” said Tony, inching closer to Steve. “I was thinking I could get you to tell me a story of my own while we wait. Preferably a sexy one?”
“Funny, ain’t your name on the check,” called back a familiar voice. Within seconds, Rhodey appeared from the secret back of the shop, a white cloth drenched in red wrapped around his leg. His hands were bloody, but it was too much to be his own.
The hairs on the back of Tony’s neck bristled. He leaned over the workbench, brow furrowed. “Obie, what did I tell you. That tech isn’t ready yet.”
“How the hell did they manage that?” Steve could barely hear his own voice over the noise.
“I have no idea what you mean mister,” said the towering giant of a man, with the largest most innocent looking baby blue eyes Steve could muster without looking like a fag.
Short stuff wasn’t convinced. “But I was training really hard! What about running around the house six times? And our weights? What happened to them?”
Steve opened the door just enough to peek his head out into the hallway without revealing his bedridden companion. “Hey kiddo. What you doing up?” he asked the very awake child.
The wolf snorted as if saying “finally,” but that still left one problem.
Steve nodded, a light blush blooming across his pale cheeks. “In bed with the man I love. I never thought I’d be this lucky, but there’s no place I’d rather be.”
Follow me on my tumbler and see all the shit I reblog.
Tony grinned that same mischievous grin Steve had seen on day one. “Nope,” he said, popping the ‘p’ like bubblegum. That one word reply sent a small shiver of energy down Steve’s spine.
With a strong jerk, Steve yanked Iron Man to him. It was like an out of body experience; watching Steve’s face get closer and closer until Tony felt the impact of Iron Man’s helmet crashing against bone. Tony pulled back the second Steve’s grip loosened from the head-butt.
Steve nodded. A pink blush lit up Steve’s cheeks and ran all the way down to his chest. He leaned forward, pressing his lips against Tony’s and yes, the werewolf definitely did remember how to kiss.
Steve gave Tony a reassuring smile. “Things change when you get older. People get taller. Some get a few wrinkles. You grew a beard. Would Captain America lie to you?”
“What is that?” Steve’s face was white as a sheet and his voice came out as a near silent whisper. “Did you make that?”
He pulled and pulled, putting every ounce of strength he could muster into breaking the ice. Eventually, the iceberg let out a low groan. The fissure grew deeper and longer. Tony pulled at the crack one last time and the whole thing fell apart in his hands.
The wolf swiped at his head. His claws caught on the cage a few inches from Tony’s face, but Tony didn’t flinch. The wolf snarled. He dug his teeth into the metal links, angry and desperate to get out. But the fence was strong. It didn’t give or break. The only thing that was impressive was the fact that he managed to land some spit smack dab in the middle of Tony’s unimpressed face.
“Fine.” Tony slammed down the receiver, glad to be done with the conversation.
“So you’ve stated multiple times.”
“And for the record, I still haven’t forgiven you for breaking Steve’s heart Stark.”
"What is this?" demanded Pepper, equipped with a newspaper and a clipboard of important papers.
“That,” said Rumlow with a toothy smile. “That, I can do.”
of the Howling Commandos, he’s looking for you.”
“Oh, well, if Jarvis says so.” Steve fluffed up a few pillows for extra support sat down at the end of the bed so Tony had plenty of room to stretch out. “Like most good stories, this one starts in Paris…”
“Everything,” he said, trying his best not to shed a tear. His voice cracked instead. “He was really mad.”
Evening came and Tony took the same trek up to the werewolf enclosure, but this time, he had a special surprise with him.
Tony lifted up his sunglasses, admiring how the beads of ocean water made Steve sparkle like the stars. It was a good look for Steve. Made Tony wish their peaceful vacation could last forever. “Having fun?” he asked as Steve got close.
A smile spread across Tony’s face. “It’s okay. Take your time. You’re not used to talking.”
Shit.
The cool cats called it
“What look?” asked Tony. He didn’t have a look. Did he? Of course he didn’t. That was impossible. Was it? He was thinking about Steve, not some pretty dame on his arm. That was the look Rhodey was talking about, right? Thinking about pretty dames, wasn't on his radar. Besides, Steve would be much better than any random dame.  Dressed to the nines in a well fitted tux, blue eyes shining like sapphires from the flashing photographers.
“Tony!” Steve tried to grab his boyfriend, but a sudden blast of energy sent him flying back.
Steve started with Tony’s balls, teasing him with quick kisses from soft lips and hard teeth. He moved up Tony’s shaft, kissing his way up until his lips were only a hair’s breadth away from Tony’s head. Tony gasped as Steve blew a warm breath of air over the damp sheet.
Happy Halloween everyone! Snow/ flurries have been spotted in my neck of the prefecture and it's not even November. Fan fucking tastict. Updating on my tablet, so excus any spelling errors.
That was all the push Steve needed to hear. He stomped over to the man and nudged his beaten face with the heel of his shoe, hard.
“All the more reason to get your affairs in order,” the doctor almost whispered as he made his way over to the bar.
“How are you?” asked Tony.
“Don’t blame me." Bucky said flippantly. "If it was a dame, I’d be one thing. Assuming you were trying for the thing. But a guy? What were you thinking?”
“You okay with just a mason jar? I don’t have anything fancy,” said Steve, pouring them each a glass of amber liquid.
Tony reached out a hand to stop him, but Rumlow was ready for it. A heavy boot knocked Tony’s arm down and back down onto the floor. The thick heel dug into the small exposed flesh not covered by the armor.
Steve looked over Tony’s shoulder and his eyebrow raised a tick. “I’ve got a good one. It’s called, run.” Grabbing Tony by the scruff of his neck, Steve dragged them away from their hiding spot seconds before Tony felt a searing heat race across his back. He turned back for a split second to see their hideout had been vaporized in a blast of white.
“Well whatever they did, it works great. We’ll be able to send out the first shipment in a few weeks.”
Rhodey’s smiling face was relief to see. But there was a sickening twist to the grin that told Tony that not all was right in the world.
A breath caught in his throat. Steve tried to swallow it and push it down along with the horrible truth, but he couldn’t bring himself to lie. Now not. Not to Sam. He squeezed his eyes shut, forcing through the pain. “Tony is part of the Iron Family,” he said, hanging his head in shame.
“The experiment AIM performed on you, we think it worked. Bruce is looking over the data they recorded. It’s not complete, but he’s inclined to believe this little guy, he’s you.”
Tony hummed as Steve pressed a few possessive kisses into Tony’s neck. “Whatever you say, husband-to-be,” he hummed.
The clattering of empty shells stopped. Rhodey leaned his head back as far as the suit could go. “Steve is the leader of the Brooklyn Boys,” he confessed with an exasperated sigh. “Figured it out when we met the guys who were gonna sell us the hooch. Knew we’d run into them again, but never expected it to be like this.”
“Don’t you have some place where you can work this stuff out on your own?" asked Steve. "Someplace where you can tinker around?”
With practiced fingers, Tony rung out the towel in a small bowl. He downed his whiskey in one go and took a sip of vodka for good luck. Water in one hand and sanitized towel in the other, Tony rounded the bar and began making his way toward Steve.
Tony raised an eyebrow. “Why bring it up now?” he asked. Something big must have happened for Pepper’s BS detectors to go off.
Five.
“Then why the hell would you keep something like this from me?” asked Tony. To him, it didn’t make a lick of sense. He was the boss. The boss was supposed to know everything.
“Looks like Thor and Falcon are keeping them busy,” reported Bucky, joining Steve. “I also heard someone up on the catwalk making a lot of noise earlier.”
“I’ll be going out to buy those modified suits you ordered special from the Van Dyne’s while you have a meeting with General Ross and Captain Blonsky,” Pepper reported from the schedule on her clipboard.
Oh, so their relationship was like that, was it? If these were the guys taking SI weapons, it would make dishing out revenge all the more sweeter.
“Didn’t expect to see you here. I thought everyone would be at home tonight.  It is Christmas after all, no matter how little snow is on the ground.”
Steve grinned. “I see a lot of somethings that I like.” He took Tony’s sunglasses and shifted them up so they sat over Tony’s hairline. “It’s been awhile since I’ve seen you this relaxed. Looks good on you.”
“Yeah?” he said into the phone. A chill ran down Steve’s back as the cold, harsh voice of Iron Man replaced the softness in Tony’s eyes. “Yeah, he’s with me. Yes Pepper, my pants are still around my waist. No, I didn’t. I dislike that you insinuate that I … Okay. I understand. We’ll be there in a second.”
Clint shoved his hands in his pockets and hunched over. “And somebody called a hit on the Engineer, so if we happen to find the baster who did it, ain’t no big thing if we happen to knock ‘em over.”
“Which reminds me,” Tony jumped flawlessly on the tangent.  “I should get a present for him. I haven’t had such a good plan for a hit in a long time.”
A loud crack of gunfire ripped through the air. Tony redid his working gauntlet. “Time to show those Nazi bastards how it’s done.”
Tony suddenly felt aware of the critical eyes watching him. “If someone came back from a fight, and they were having a hard time breathing, and were almost keeling over, what would you say it was?” he asked, trying his best to casually walk over.
“And pray tell what you think you are doing?” asked Thor, exuding calm despite the urgency of the situation. “We are not men under your name. Why should we take orders from you?” he asked, tightening the grip on his bloodied hammer.
Stane yelled into the phone, “What? I can’t hear you. They’re working on setting up the factory.” Tony got the feeling that Stane was intentionally trying not to hear him.
Short chapter this time. Next update, is going to be big.
“That’s… It’s not the same.”
“Tony.” Pepper pushed her fingers to her temple. There was that look for the second time today. Tony was on a roll.
Down the hallway, the elevator pinged. Tony walked into the kitchen, announcing his presence with a loud yawn as his bare feet padded across the floor. His hair was plastered flat on one side and a floppy mess on the other. Brown and grey stubble decorated Tony’s jaw and neck all the way down to the purple hickey barely hidden underneath a loose fitting white shirt. Tony stretched his arms over head, revealing a bit of beautiful skin above the waistband of his sweatpants.
“It’s not ready yet. Still need to solve the overheating and power regulating problems,” Tony motioned to the disarray of unlabeled blueprints and schematics.
Steve’s lips turned up into a devious grin. “What do you want, Tony? Do you want the sheet on or off?”
“Did these guys ask for permission too?” whispered Steve, pressing close to Tony.
“But he proposed to you!” said Bucky. “How can we not have a little fun after something like that?”
Tony felt the blood rush into his cheeks. “Thanks,” he mumbled.
“A helper robot,” Tony replied absentmindedly, gathering the necessary things for an afternoon out. “Or, more of a helper hand. Can’t decide if it’s going to be autonomous or dependent, but either way, problems. Still in the ’tech that needs to catch up to my genius before I can make it into reality’ stage. But it should be confusing enough and look impressive enough to keep the board off our back for a bit.”
Jan rolled her eyes. “The Howling Commandos. We gave them donuts a few months ago when we were running around France. Remember?”
“Oh yes. Happy and I would be very impressed by your thoughtfulness.”
Tony grinned and pressed a kiss to Steve’s lips. “The best kind,” he said. “I love you too, sweetie.”
Just as Bruce was about to leave, Tony remembered something very important he wanted to ask about. "What does shortness of breath mean?”
“Just let me do this one thing for you,” he begged, barely breathing. “I haven’t had a lot of good news today.”
Steve didn’t know if he wanted to shake the Iron Family’s hand or shake them down. On the one hand, they had shaken Hydra up something fierce with the exploding heater stunt. (Took a lot of moxie and stupid to scare a group that big.) On the other hand, because the Iron Family rattled their chains, tensions were high and Hydra had become significantly more aggressive, short tempered, and volatile over the past few days. If the five-on-two ambush on Thor and Bucky was anything to go by, Steve couldn’t shake the feeling that they were headed into an all-out war for the underground.
“Roll call gents. Not paying you to slack off on the job,” Iron Man yelled into the shady shop.
“I should probably go now,” he murmured.
Tony’s lips peeled back into a toothy smile. “I’m a very powerful man, Steve. I can keep big promises like that.”
Actually, Steve looked more than fine in Tony’s book. He looked absolutely
“Oh really? And what about us? Isn’t the former Captain America and the mini Stark famous enough for sunglasses?”
Pepper was not impressed. “You went to sleep.”
“I know it’s-”
“No blood.”
Tony’s vision bled red. That bastard. There was no way in hell he would let this man’s grubby, Nazi fingers harm a single hair on Steve’s head.
“Tony?”
werewolf. Throw an unfamiliar scent in there and he might lash out to protect his territory.”
Tony pressed the dome of the dough down with the heel of his hand. The dough billowed out under the weight like a under inflated ball. He grabbed a small chunk at the bottom of the circle and heald it steady. Pressing the palm of his other hand into the center of the dough, Tony stretched out the glutenous mixture into a rectangular strip. He folded the dough in half and with a quick flick of his wrist, Tony spun the now ovular doug around so it was long in width and short in length. He took hold of the untouched edge closest to him and repeated the process. Stretch, fold, turn. Stretch, fold, turn. He continued this motion a few times and then offered Steve the board.
“I think you mean just enough,” Steve said, pressing a quick peck to Tony’s cheek. God, he wanted more. But now was not the time or place. “Figure out the machine yet?”
