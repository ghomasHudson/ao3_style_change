“Thanks, Nat.” Steve sheepishly smiled at her. What idiots they were, the tower didn’t have anything fit to take care of a kid, much less a one year old.
Steve laughed all the way to Tony.
“Come on, you two. Ice cream’s on me,” Steve said.
hiding.
“Let go! Let go! Let go!” The sound of a kick and a grunt came from the emergency stairwell right before the door was pushed open and a little boy came running out.
“Steve?” Tony asked.
Hello, lovelies! I’m sorry I haven’t been on in a while. Work has taken over my life, I feel like there’s barely any time to do anything :( That said, I hope you enjoyed this chapter and I’ll try to see you soon!
Tony was doing his best to cross over to them. His arms held out to his sides to help balance as he dragged his skates through the snow.
“Good,” Steve said, “Then I guess I can show you something really cool.”
“I got things for people
“Uh-huh,” Tony nodded and hurriedly pressed a button. The robot began moving, shooting forward on its wheels like something kicked it before stopping for a second and repeating. It didn’t stop until it hit the leg of the couch and turned back around.
Steve smoothed back Tony’s hair and said, “His head hurts again. He was crying for a while…” Bruce and Steve shared a look, with Steve’s face saying, ‘I’ll explain later.’
The toddler’s sobbing slowed down to a sniffle as he was cradled in Captain America’s arms. His scrunched up face relaxed and his eyes opened, revealing large brown eyes framed by wet eyelashes.
“I’m sorry, Steve, but I have to get going.”
Tony made a whining noise when his legs kept slipping off of Steve’s shin and raised his arms out to Steve, “Steeb! Steeb!”
“… Just admiring what a great artist you are, Tony.” Bruce said as he ruffled Tony’s hair. “Now, do you want to do anything today?”
? Dear Cap, are you sure you know him?” Clint snickered and wrapped his arm around Steve’s shoulders.
He felt the world turn and his breath leave him as his body was yanked down and forced to do a roll. He immediately recognized Natasha’s favorite way of taking someone down—legs wrapped around the neck as she used her momentum to drag the person to the ground.
Tony’s eyes dilated as Steve began kissing down his torso, following each kiss with a little lick. When he reached the edge of the panties, Steve looked up and winked.
Tony looked up at Steve defiantly and crossed his arms again, “Don’t want it.”
“O-oh, Steve.” Tony squeezed Steve’s bicep, “You’ll be the death of m-me.”
“... Do I
responsibility. Bruce has a lab at the Towers and he can do tests. We also contacted Thor and he said he’ll help us too. So while we figure out a way to cure Tony, we’re also going to care for him.”
Steve lightly tapped the top of Tony’s head, getting him to look up at him, “Did you finish your medicine?”
As Steve swept the bits of wire and metal off the floor, Tony walked up to him.
Steve walked over to the kitchen area, eying the large mess of bowls and egg shells spread across the counter and haphazardly spilling into the sink. For two spies who were all about doing things quick and clean, the place was a mess—although he had to admit there was an enticing aroma coming from the oven.
“Iron Man, we’re coming down to assist you.” Captain America’s voice rang out through the communications system.
“What do you want for Christmas, Tony?” Steve asked as they waited in line. In front of them, Santa and his elves were busy listening to each child’s wish as the parents waited off to the side conversing with each other. Occasionally, they would hear a jolly burst of ‘Ho Ho Ho!’ and it would make Tony hop excitedly in his spot.
“Comfy?” Steve asked as he walked out of the store.
liked it then the adult Tony would at least think it was alright.
Giving Tony a bath wasn’t bad at all, quite the opposite, really. Tony was calm and obedient, silently playing with the rubber duck that was tossed in earlier as Steve sat behind him and carefully washed the suds from his head and body.
Steve grinned at Tony’s moan and pressed him against the pool wall. “Now, let’s get you wet.”
“I know you’re sleepy,” Steve said as a reply to Tony’s annoyed mumble, “But just a few more minutes and you can sleep all you want.”
“We’ll clean up then.” Natasha said, getting up from her seat and dragging a yawning Clint and a dazed Bruce to the pile of baby products littered on the floor.
“Tony, Cap.”
Tony squeezed her form and pressed a kiss to her hair. “I’m sorry I can’t be the person that you deserve, Pepper, but for what it’s worth, I do love you.”
Steve stood in the doorway wearing a sorrowful expression that stretched Tony’s heartstrings further than they already were. “I’m truly sorry, Tony,” he offered, walking into the room. “It wasn’t my intention to cause any trouble when I knocked on your front door tonight.”
“I see.” The pale skin showcased by Pepper’s sweetheart neckline was slowly reddening, a sharp contrast against the lavender hue of her dress. “Please have a seat, Captain. I’m feeling a bit under the weather tonight, so I’m afraid I won’t be joining you for dinner.”
The sky turns black,
Had Tony known that he would be expected to attend daily “family” dinners - at precisely 7 o’clock in the evening - when he promised Pepper a normal life, he might have thought twice before making the offer. It wasn’t so much that he didn’t
Steve’s trembling fingers lost their grip on Thanos’ fist, and his hands fell limp at his side.  Gravity gently pulled him down toward the waiting embrace of fragrant earth, whispering of silence and forgiveness and rest. He locked eyes with Thanos, staring down the arrogant greed filling the alien’s irises, and the ghost of a smirk touched his blood-stained lips.
Pepper snorted and walked toward her suitcases. “I’m catching a red-eye back to New York. I’ll send you an email when I get in. The car will be waiting for you at the airport.”
“I didn’t invite him here, Pepper,” he weakly offered.
“My – wait - what-”
Tony felt the loss of at least three layers of skin as Pepper tore her gaze away. He watched her stalk out of the dining room without so much as looking Steve’s way. The sharp staccato from her nude colored Malono Blahnik heels flooded the hallway, a clear message that she was done with any civil conversation tonight. He sighed and ushered Steve into his recently vacated seat.
the one that you’re really mad at.
The scent liquified Steve’s body down to his bones, and he felt himself melt into the mattress and become one with the memory foam. He closed his eyes and allowed himself a long moment of relaxation. It had been so long since he’d slept in a real bed, and even longer since he’d had the luxury of wrapping himself in bedding washed in the Gain detergent that Tony favored so much.
If for some reason his heart rate skipped a few beats at his friend’s answering snort, Tony didn’t feel it necessary to be concerned.
Tony waited until he heard the shower start running in Steve’s room before making his way toward his and Pepper’s bedroom. The room sat at the back of the house, and he wasn’t too shocked to find the door wide open. Pepper stood in front of the large picture window that framed a backdrop of a clear, black, moonless sky. Tony could clearly see tear tracks glistening on the cheeks of her reflection. Two large suitcases sat perched near the food of the bed, and he knew she meant to leave for good this time.
Right now Tony could feel the angry glare of the antique grandfather clock - the one Pepper had insisted on purchasing - burning a hole through his skull, and the itch was slowly driving him mad. Dinner would be ready to serve in exactly seven minutes, and there would be no mercy for him if he was late again this week.
“Hello, Captain Rogers,” she offered in a tight voice. She kept her eyes glued to Tony’s face. “I didn’t know that you were expecting company, Tony.”
“If we’re lucky, we’ll get to go home.” Steve paused. “Maybe someday we’ll get another chance.”
A faint blush bloomed on Elise’s face, and she patted Steve’s hand. “It’s my pleasure, sir.” She took a step back and bowed lightly before pushing the cart back out of the dining room.
“It seems my husband has mutated into a parrot overnight.”
“I don’t understand what’s going on, other than the fact that I’m being…judged,” Steve admitted in a faint voice. He ran his hands through his hair and tugged at the roots.
The sound of heavy footsteps rumbled in the distance behind Steve, but he waited to greet the drones. He caught T’Challa’s eye from a distance and raised his hand in farewell. Steve would never be able to repay the kindness and trust that his newfound friend had offered him and Bucky.
Steve pushed himself to his knees and forced his body to stand on shaky legs, gazing out toward the horizon with a weary gaze. The earth was covered with layers of trampled flesh, a devastating rainbow of skin tones that both inspired and tore at the psyche.
The man’s mouth was moving, but Tony couldn’t hear what he was saying. The only thing he could focus on was the anger burning in the man’s eyes – anger he knew was directed at him.
I got caught up in Captain America’s world, Tony. Before I learned just how ugly that world is.”
“I suppose I could try to isolate the flow of time around the wound. It may buy us a moment so we can attempt to treat him.”
“Oh, my darling, you know exactly who I am,” Tony cooed in a flirty tone.
“I don’t wanna.”
Steve scanned the area and confirmed that its layout was already locked in his memory. The chest of drawers he had once shared with Tony stood tall against the far back wall, and Steve traced the familiar distressed, honeydew chalk paint coating its surface with curious eyes. He wondered if Tony’s gray Zeppelin shirt still slept in the third drawer. It had been left behind when the Avengers had taken their leave from Clint’s sanctuary, and Tony had complained the entire trip home. He’d demanded that Clint have Laura mail it to him, but to Steve’s knowledge, the delivery had never been made. No doubt Clint had held on to the shirt as an emergency bargaining chip.
He moved to walk out of the room, and Tony found his lips parting before he gave his mouth permission to speak. “Why are you here?”
There wasn’t anything Tony could really say to that. He unconsciously pressed his knee harder into Steve’s leg and speared a bite of the man’s salmon. “Anytime, old man,” he smiled, holding Steve’s gaze.
The site that greeted Steve just about knocked him straight on his ass. His quick steps came to a stuttering halt, and he found he could do nothing but stand in the middle of Clint’s kitchen with his mouth hanging open.
“Steven Grant Rogers, you stop this nonsense right now!” Peggy chastised. She slipped her swollen feet out of her heels and lay them in Steve’s lap. “Honestly. Your horrendous attitude is upsetting me, and if I’m upset, your son is upset.” She caressed her belly with the tips of her fingers.
“Are you claiming to have saved me?”
Tony-dupe offered Steve a soft smile, the action crinkling the corners of its eyes. “I see you know what I’m talking about.”
“No time, Buck!”
Wash it far, push it out to sea .
“I’m pretty sure that word isn’t in my vocabulary.”
“Are we goin’ fishin’ today, Pops?”
His heart jumped in his throat when he caught sight of their impromptu guest, and he flung the door open. “Steve!”
“What is this?” Steve demanded in a strained voice. He continued to stare at the empty place Alaric had stood in only moments before. “Who…what…are you?” He felt a shift in the weight still sitting in his legs, and he knew Peggy was gone.
He remembered searing pain, and the horrified wonder that had settled into the cracks of his tired soul as he felt the serum fail his body. A hungry darkness had stolen his eyesight, and Steve recalled the feeling of blood rushing to his lungs, seeking refuge from death. He could still feel tight, gasping breaths pushing at the strained seams of the organs, mingling with the blood, as darkness spread through his body and slowly shut down his system. Steve had welcomed the sensation, he’d chosen to embrace death, and yet, he remembered being drawn to the golden light in Tony’s eyes.
“The soul stone has finally manifested on a physical plane,” Tony-dupe explained.
Natasha snorted and cupped the sides of his face. “Come back to us, Steve. Bring Bucky if you want.”
Tony furrowed his eyebrows and forced himself to meet Steve’s gaze. “What do you mean by that exactly?”
“You touched the dirtiest part of your face, young man, and that action warrants another good hand washing – with lots of soap.”
Steve wakes up in a familiar place, surrounded by familiar faces, and it seems mission assignments have followed him into the hereafter.
- Moby, "The Sky is Broken"
Tony-dupe reached out and took Steve’s hands within its own. Its eyes were bright with adoration. “Your resolve is what drew me to your heart, Steve Rogers. You’ve had my fascination since the day your heart found its resolve.” Tony’s shade squeezed Steve’s hands. “Thanos thinks himself a self-made god, but he’s nothing but a weak impression of power. He could never command one such as I, even though he is trying his hardest to do so as we speak.”
“Too tired,” Steve sighed, and the heaviness of it pushed against Tony’s chest. “I hope you’ll forgive me this once for my impropriety.”
“You mean you were ready to throw in the towel,” Tony-dupe spat. “What, just ‘cause you’re an old man you think you can slack off, Rogers? There’s a whole universe that needs saving, and you bowed out like a coward!”
A comfortable silence took root between them, and for just a moment, Tony could pretend that he was sitting back at the Tower. For just a heartbeat, he could pretend that the rest of the gang was busy washing up before coming into the dining room because no one liked to have Cap’s disapproving smile aimed his or her way – it felt like being stabbed in the heart.
The attack was laser-hot, and it tore through Steve’s mid-section like a heated knife cutting through butter. His lungs seized around the air trapped within, and Steve choked as the organs began to fill with blood. Cold air swept into the open pit that was once held several vital tissues, cooling the blood that rushed toward the gaping wound. Azure eyes filled with terrified awe, erasing the remaining resolve from Steve’s face. He knew in his heart that his fight was finally done – there was no way the serum could compete with the amplified power that Thanos wielded.
The snow crunched under Tony as he waddled to the rink. Bundled up in a red coat, a wool beanie that was slightly too large, and a scarf so thick it covered half of his face, he reminded Steve of an adorable penguin.
The resulting sound and slightly sting had Tony rubbing his face in the pillow to muffle a whine.
“Go on, we’ll be right over there,” Steve tilted his head to the group of parents waiting next to a train and a large gingerbread house for their photos.
“You go first! I’ll be right there!” Steve yelled back. The smile on his face slipped a smidge when he saw Tony slip a little getting on the ice, but Tony’s giggle as Natasha slowly pulled him across the ice quickly put it back.
“Okay,” Steve said and turned away to face her, “I’ll just get Tony washed up.” Natasha was looking at him, her eyes slightly squinted with what he could only describe as amusement. “What?” Steve asked, feeling a bit unnerved.
It was his duty to carry the essence of his lost comrades to the end of his line. Dead soldiers always lived on within those who still breathed, still fought. On and on the essence of dead soldiers were passed amongst survivors, until finally, a brave heart would tow them all past the finish line. He wondered, not for the first time, which poor soul would inherit his scarred spirit.
“What is it that you need to understand exactly?” Steve barked. “Why is this any of your damn business?!”
I watch it crush me, and then I die
“As you wish, Sir,” the AI responded.
Death had finally arrived, and she was a harbinger of the end. Steve swore he could feel the thrum of her breath push against his body, measuring his soul with the mere echo of her hunger. She would claim all lost souls only after the earth had soaked up the last drop of spilled blood, and then she would collect the hearts of those who survived.
“What?! Where? How?”
The hairs rose on the back of Steve’s neck, and he raised both shields high, blocking blows from both sides. He pushed against the force of electric spears aimed at his torso and sent the Chitauri wielding them out toward the center of the field. Blood rushed through his system with the force of a tsunami, the pressure of the discharge pounding in his temples.
Nations had put aside their differences to join arms in Earth’s defense, and the colors of various countries had been hoisted high into the air as soldiers charged into battle. These colors continued to wave from the bodies of the fallen, and each tiny movement of bloodied uniforms fluttering in the wind was a silent reminder of what was at stake.
“I don’t understand,” Steve whispered, tightening his hold on Tony-dupe’s hands. “this isn’t real. You’re wearing Tony’s face, but you aren’t him. This can’t be real. I died. I was done fighting. I was ready….”
Thanos was currently ripping the universe apart stitch by stitch, and some force had seen fit to tuck Steve Rogers into bed for a posthumous nap. What was the point of keeping him around if he was dead? Did Thanos have a way of resurrecting the dead to do his bidding? Steve steeled his nerves and padded toward the entrance, his senses on high alert. He scanned the room for anything that he could use as a weapon, but the only objects around him besides the bed and the chest of drawers were the various reams of fabric Laura stored against the back wall.
“I’m not a coward,” Steve snapped, jumping to his feet. He jabbed Tony-dupe’s right shoulder with his index finger. “I’ve fought my whole life, Tony, and I fought until I couldn’t anymore. I’m just an old soldier whose time has run out.”
Peggy slid nimble fingers up Steve’s arms and let them settle on his shoulders. She gave the tense muscles beneath her hands a light squeeze before guiding Steve into a metal chair with rounded corners. He jumped when her lips pressed a kiss to his temple. “My, my, you’re so tense this morning, my darling. You’ll feel better after you’ve eaten.”
The determined expression on Alaric’s face was one Steve was familiar with. He’d seen it every day in the mirror during his childhood. He ruffled the boy’s hair and took a moment to marvel at its softness. “Do as your mother says,” he encouraged. “It won’t take but a minute, and then you and I can talk about this fishing trip.”
A memory from days long ago tugged at Steve’s focus, and his senses were immediately filled with the aromas of smoky bar rooms and cheap beer, comingled with the sounds of rowdy laughter. The ghost of an old smile touched Steve’s mouth, and he dropped his head to the ground and began to sing. The words pushed past his lips with an energy his limbs no longer possessed. “
“You need to check your ego, Stark!” Bucky growled.
“Wait!” Steve cried. He rushed toward the back door, but Tony-dupe had already slipped through and closed the door behind himself. Steve yanked the door open and stepped outside onto the back porch, his bare feet catching traction on the wooden planks of the patio. He was greeted with a fresh wave of the evening breeze that carried with it the modest sounds and clean smells of Summer in the country.
He sighed and turned over on his side, willing his body to go back to sleep. It was an uncharacteristic move for Tony, but he wasn’t ready to tackle the weirdness that had infected his life. Maybe by morning, after a pot of coffee, he’d be coherent enough to care enough that he’d lost his girlfriend and gained a new roommate whose eyes were more haunted than Tony’s own.
“And what is
the sky.
A shaky exhale fell from Steve’s lips, and he slowly rose from his seat. Tony frowned as his feet fell to the floor with a hard thud. “I’m going to ask you one more time. Who, or what, are you? What is this place?”
“Because I need to know where to guide you.”
“I don’t need help from two old geezers punch-drunk on war songs,” Tony scoffed.
Steve continued singing. “
Tony pulled Steve’s body close. “There must be something you can do, Strange!” he pleaded. “Turn back time, make it stop – there has to be something!”
Steve took in a gasping breath, and the action made his lungs burn. “B-Buck,” he managed to stammer before Tony tore the earpiece from his ear.
“There’s no way you and Bucky can handle this by yourselves!”
“Stevie, you idiot, I told you to wait!” Bucky yelled. “I’m almost there!”
Steve found that he could not let go of Tony-dupe’s hands. It had been too long since he’d been allowed within a thousand miles near Tony’s space, much less within touching distance. To be able to make physical contact with his friend was like a balm to his spirit. “What do you mean as we speak?” he finally voiced.
When Winter passed, Steve’s room was always invaded by heat and dirt so soft and fine he was sure the granules were made of silk. The soil would float throughout the air, coating everything in his room. During the first night of Spring, a fine layer of dust would settle on his skin, caressing his hair before crawling into his sinuses and settling in for a long, Summer nap. The Summer months were hard on Steve – he had daily battles with his asthma that left him completely drained, and some were so bad he swore he saw God’s light beckoning him home.
“You were ready to what, Capsicle?” Tony-dupe prodded. He pulled his hands back and crossed his arms.
Steve fell to his knees, his chest heaving from exhaustion. Fatigue had blinded him, but he could still hear, and he frantically stretched his ears to catch Bucky’s voice over the comms.  He missed the cadence call, and the earpiece resting in his ear crackled, a tell-tale sound that the comm line was being hacked.
“Peggy,” Steve croaked, finally finding his voice. He found himself mesmerized by the burgundy color staining her lips. He slid a trembling hand across the table, fingers stretched out in a silent plea, but the gesture wilted and died as his eyes fell upon the soft curve of her belly.
Tony dreamed of New York. He was surrounded by an icy chill and shadow and silence, but there was a large star pushing through it all. Its bright light illuminated Tony’s vision as the star drew closer toward him, and soon the only thing Tony could see was Captain America pushing through the chaos pulling Tony down into the abyss.
“I - uh - yeah, buddy, I’m fine,” Steve choked.
one of the people that you’re trying so hard to forget about.”
“I’m coming, I’m coming, I’m coming,” he chanted. Steve’s heart stopped as Thanos raised the gauntlet high into the air with the intent of squashing Tony into the earth. Steve was still too far away, he wasn’t going to make it, he’d failed to do his duty, he’d failed to protect what was most important….
Someone called Steve’s name in the distance, and the sound filled the jagged cracks in his spirit, igniting the strange warmth burning in his heart. The voice sounded familiar, but he couldn’t place the owner. He wanted to turn, to seek out the voice, but the anguish in Tony’s eyes held him fast, and Steve found all he could do was hold on to the warmth and wait for Tony to release him.
“Steve,” Natasha breathed, lifting her head. Her right eye was swollen shut.
“I’m coming, Steve, wait for me!”
Tucked somewhere within the folds of her infinite robe lay the heart of one Steven Grant Rogers.
“Tony-”
“Okay,” Alaric grumbled, crossing his arms. “But for the record, I already washed my hands like mom asked.”
Tony awoke with a start and lay in the darkness for what seemed like hours trying to catch his breath. His phone alerted him of a message around 4:30 in the morning, and it was from Pepper. She’d finally made it in to New York, and she’d settled down in a guest apartment that SI reserved for special clients.
“Do you want to wash up? The bathroom is down the hall…somewhere.”
He stepped toward Pepper and cupped her face in both hands, tracing her elfin features with his eyes. “Why can’t you just come out and admit that
Steve raised a trembling hand to Tony’s face and cupped his jaw. “N-no,” he gasped, hoping that Tony would understand. He had no more fight left in his soul. Steve had fought against many enemies, he had saved countless lives, and he’d taken just as many in return. He had sacrificed his heart and soul to the cause of being a just soldier, and Steve had willingly become a villain to fight for the greater good.  There was nothing left to give now, nothing but this moment, where he could take some of Tony’s pain with him to the afterlife.
A strange light filled Steve’s eyes, but Tony had no time to try and decipher its meaning. Hell broke loose in the dining room as soon as he escorted Steve through the doorway. Pepper rose from her seat with a deadly grace that would put Natasha’s to shame, and she speared Tony into place with a heavy gaze. He gently pressed the tips of his fingers into the small of Steve’s back.
And then he was gone, leaving behind a void of heavy stillness that pulled at Steve’s heartstrings. He was sure he had just lain eyes on a boy who was a fusion of himself and Tony Stark, and the mere memory of the boy’s face, of the vibrant Stark energy coursing through his veins, stole the breath from Steve’s lungs. He couldn’t breathe, couldn’t think, and he was hit with a strong sense of
The landing was brutal, and Steve felt his teeth tear into the sensitive flesh of his cheeks like a starved animal. One exhausted heartbeat passed, then another, the sensation filling his head with white noise. He forced his tired body to stand, spitting out a large pool of blood that stained the earth the vibrant color of a Camilla bloom. Steve saw Iron Man finally rise in his peripheral vision, and the sight granted him a fourth wind. His body was running on wispy vapors so delicate his breath threatened to send them out into the void. He had just enough energy left to make sure that Tony got to safety.
“To rest,” Steve answered.
“Mr. Stark-”
A golden circle of pulsing light manifested behind Thanos, accompanied by a bright flash of green and the angry whine of Iron Man’s repulsor. Steve heard Thanos yell in outrage before being violently sucked into the door of the portal. He felt a hard tug on his battered body, but the man Tony had called Strange closed off the portal, cutting off its grip. Absolute silence followed in Thanos’ wake, and it exploded across the field, causing Steve’s ears to pop from the pressure.
A desperate sob spilled from Pepper’s lips, and she threw her arms around Tony’s neck and hugged him tight. “I’m sorry, Tony,” she breathed, sobbing into this neck. “It wasn’t supposed to be this way. I thought I could handle who you were…who you are…but I can’t. I’m scared all of the time, and I never know when someone is going to bust through the door.”
The smoky aroma of fried bacon wafted through the open doorway, tapping the end of Steve’s nose. He rose to his feet and straightened the waistband of the black sweatpants clinging to his hips. Deep down, Steve knew he should be alarmed about his current circumstances. He was dead and Thanos was still alive. The alien was a dangerous threat - Steve had died by his hand after suffering only one attack. There was no telling how long Stark tech would be able to keep Tony safe. Queens was a greenhorn, and Strange’s magic was bound to have limits. Even with T’Challa’s resources standing at the ready, Earth’s forces would need to formulate the mother of all counter attacks to defeat Thanos.
“Have a seat. I’ll make you a plate,” Steve said, dipping more bread into the mixture he had in a dish.
“What’s that?” The group looked up when they heard the sound of Tony’s voice.
With seven minutes left, it was barely enough time to fight off both of them and get Tony as well. But Steve, being who he was, was always up for a challenge.
Without warning, Tony let out the world’s loudest scream. The cry pierced through their ears and caused the team to wince and, including Natasha, panic.
She was halfway out the door when Tony found his voice again. “I think you can, too.”
Steve stilled in his steps in the doorway and let his weight drop against the doorframe. A long minute passed before he finally answered. “I just followed the light.”
“That’s the understatement of the year,” Tony murmured. He walked over towards Pepper’s abandoned seat and relocated the dishes and cutlery to the space right beside Steve. He settled into his seat and pressed his knee against Steve’s leg. “Jarvis, please inform Elise that we’re ready for dinner to be served.”
Tony-dupe laughed. “The answer to that question is quite complicated – people’s actions really do affect their eventual resting place, but it is not I who makes the final decision.”
Sam flew overhead, waving in silent gratitude as he zigzagged through more aerial attacks. Relief flooded Steve’s system, and he released a shaky exhale. He wrenched his shield free from the dead alien and scanned his immediate surroundings. Steve seemed to be lying in a small vacuum of stillness filled with nothing but the sounds of war. He shook his head and pressed the heels of his hands into his brows in a vain attempt to ease the pressure building behind his eyes. Steve took in a cleansing inhale and released a sharp breath, the sound mingling with the eerie cacophony of clashing weapons playing loud and fast in the background.
Steve uncurled Thanos’ fist, his body shaking from the exertion. He had to hold Thanos in place long enough for everyone to escape and regroup. His mouth fell open as a rabid roar crawled up his throat and clawed its way past his lips. A foreign sensation abruptly settled into the atoms of Steve’s body, singing a song of warning, as the gauntlet began to glow a rich purple color, and he found himself welcoming its melody into his heart.
Steve’s senses became permeated with the metallic scent of his fallen brethren. The smell coated the lining of his throat and savagely crawled through his system until it burrowed into the marrow of his bones. Resolve took root at the base of his heart, extending long arms outward. Steve almost choked from the weight of it.
It was a sweltering eighty degrees in the lab. The
“Oh, look at you.” Steve’s eyes ran up and down Tony’s flushed face, down his heaving torso, to the hard red cock pointing straight at Tony’s stomach. “Don’t worry, baby. I’ll help you with that.”
that. Dum-E can stand near me and watch.”
“It’s alright, Tony. You made something so amazing! You didn’t hurt yourself making this did you?” Steve asked, worried about possible burns and cuts.
If he could, Steve would find those people and have them face him, because no punishment in hell could compare to his.
The doctor nodded and placed the sandwiches on the coffee table, “Don’t worry about us. We’ll just be eating and watching cartoons, right, Tony?”
Steve slid his finger in and out, each time inserting it deeper and massaging little circles along the smooth walls.
“I see,” Steve nodded. “Do I just put it in his food?” Steve asked and glanced at the bowl of yogurt.
Steve glared at Fury, eyes sharp with stubbornness and anger.
Patience. Patience. Patience.
Steve frowned, “What do I do then?”
Clint yawned out a thanks as he flopped next to Natasha, groaning when she smacked the back of his head with her magazine. He then turned on the tv, where a commercial advertising a sale was playing, jolly music and all.
“Remember what we said, Tony?” Clint asked.
Tony was about to flip them the finger when he suddenly felt his body tingling and widened his eyes, “Uh oh.”
“Maybe he’s hungry!” Steve exclaimed. “Bruce, is his bottle ready?”
has skates on properly. Now hold still.”
Edit: I got a twitter! It's @toastedmshmllow so go ahead and follow if you want :D
Steve got on his knees, quickly removing the shirt off with one hand before tugging his shorts and boxers off and tossing them to the side.
Steve looked up, right as Tony yelled, “Go away, pirate!”
Steve chuckled as he removed a carton of eggs from the fridge, “Shooting at targets with Clint in the gym.”
“Calm down. He’s four,” Natasha said and hesitatingly handed Fury a breadstick.
*****
Steve stared at his folded hands for a moment. “Then… Would he remember…
“He’s adorable. Is he yours?” A voice suddenly brought Steve out of his thoughts. Turning his head to the left, he saw a handsome young brunet—although shorter than him—in a form fitting suit.
Steve was eagerly waiting on the communal floor, staying just in case Dum-E decided to ‘help’ around, and eyed the flashing numbers that showed the elevator was coming down. He had told Jarvis to get Bruce and Tony down for the surprise and was happy to know that Tony was as excited as he hoped he would be.
“Do I drink the whole thing?” Tony asked as he held up the vial to the light, which thankfully masked the glow it was emitting.
Didn't mean to leave you guys for so long.
“I don’t like him,” Tony muttered into his ice almost finished ice cream.
*****
The meeting ran an extra thirty minutes longer than planned, and for good reasons. Information about the origins of those slime monsters came up—something about another dimension, a mad scientist with a fear of aging, and a lab built in an area that used to be a nuclear power plant. How Shield was able to gather those facts, Steve wasn’t entirely sure, but now that he knew, he could feel a small sense of relief. Bruce was glancing down at his copy of the reports, making notes on his tablet while frowning every once in a while.
When Steve woke up the next day and sleepily walked over to Tony’s room, the first thing he noticed was the lack of Tony.
Thor made his appearance while Tony was being chased by Clint, who was crawling on all fours, on the communal floor. Never one for a quiet appearance, Thor announced himself the second he stepped out of the elevator, voice booming and a grin shining on his face. Bruce, who was right behind him, jumped at the sudden noise and was sure he turned a light shade of green.
At that, Steve frowned, “What did it show?”
Steve popped his head up from the water. His blond hair was pushed back as he slid his goggles off. “Tony! You finally left your lab.” He smiled as he swam to where Tony was standing near the edge. When he neared the steeper part of the pool, the water only reached halfway to his chest.
“I’m not a baby,” Tony glared at the newcomer from behind Steve’s leg, not realizing that he had a chocolate stain on his cheek from the ice cream he was eating.
Within moments, Tony was completely asleep.
Once again, silence caused his mind to drift.
“Yeah, guys. Eat while I play with the little guy.” Clint grinned as he reached out for Tony and gently plucked him from Steve’s cradle. He held Tony up by the armpits, towel slipping off and leaving him in an emergency diaper Bruce fashioned out of a small towel, until he was eyelevel. “You’re a cute one, aren’t you?” Clint began to make cooing sounds resulting in Steve chuckling at the display and Natasha rolling her eyes with a quirk of the lips.
“Want to go to sleep, big guy?” Steve asked when he felt Tony’s body start relaxing. Tony lethargically nodded his head as his eyes began fluttering shut.
Tony was a panting mess by the time Steve was satisfied.
As if hearing Steve, Natasha appeared out of nowhere. A smile reserved specifically for little Tony was already on her face. “Ready for your first skating lesson?” She asked and held out her hand. Tony nodded enthusiastically, placed his gloved hand in hers and stood up unsteadily on the two blades.
“He’s right, Tony. How you managed to pack so much power in something that size is extremely impressive. Is the laser a one time use?” Bruce asked as he walked towards the hovering bee drone, curiosity clear in his expression.
“Why don’t you go look?”
was the part Tony was most embarrassed about.
“Can we go see Santa?” Tony muttered. If it wasn’t for Steve’s enhanced hearing, he knew he wouldn’t have caught anything Tony said.
“No! Stop!”
Tony looked up at him with a tearful face and whispered, “I had a bad dream.”
Everything looked so normal, Steve almost couldn’t believe that the man who created all of this was currently a child eating a sandwich upstairs.
“That he- Wow, really?” Clint had a bemused smirk on his face.
“But Dum-E is there! I wanna play with him!” Tony pouted and crossed his arms. His little legs began stomping on the carpet and a high pitched noise between a whine and a cry formed.
“Wait!” Tony yelled before slamming the one with
“Morning, Bruce. Didn’t realize you were coming up this early.”
Do you guys remember your days as a an awkward teen? Or is that just me?
Clint, finally having someone ‘fun’ to show off to, decided that Tony needed to see him shoot at targets.
“Alright, Rogers. Focus.” Steve spun around, looking.
“I’m close, baby. Gonna fill you up, alright?” Tony gave a single nod and hugged Steve closer to him, nuzzling his face in Steve’s neck again.
“When you reach the floor and you
Tony woke Steve up when light had yet to peek between the curtains, with the toddler siting on his stomach and kneading his face until he jerked awake.
The team immediately helped lower the suit onto the gravel, being careful of not moving the heavy armor around too much incase they injured what—or whom—they thought was in there.
“Now that I think about it, no, not really. He did have a nightmare a couple of days ago but it was a memory I think.” Steve’s eyes widened in worry and looked to Bruce, “Is that a bad sign?”
’ went through his mind. He had only tried it once, the day it arrived, and felt so embarrassed he hid it deep within his luggage since that was one of the few things they didn’t share.
Tony barely noticed he had his back against the mattress, much too distracted by Steve’s tongue in his mouth, until Steve moved and began kissing down his neck.
—the coldest area in the whole building—which meant the rest of the building was probably at least five degrees hotter, which also meant that no one was crazy enough to even
Steve knew all of this, and that was why he hoped that when Tony aged back, which would be soon, Tony would see that the Avengers wanted him around as much as he wanted them.
Throughout the afternoon, Tony played with Dum-E and Steve. Bruce, who was content with lounging on the couch and watching, fell asleep after watching Tony play fetch for twenty minutes. The tricks Tony got the robot to do was quite impressive, as if Dum-E had been built to be more entertaining than useful. When Steve remembered that Tony built the robot in his father’s workshop as a teenager, he couldn’t help but think that there might be more truth to that thought than he hoped.
Steve looked down at Tony, “We’re about to have a thirteen year old in six hours.” He then sighed, “... We didn’t even get him clothes yet.”
Removing the lid, Tony reached inside the box, hesitated and then proceeded to hold up a sheer, lacy black underwear.
“Tony Stark!” Steve shouted, standing up and glaring at the closed bedroom door. “You come out of there right now!” No reply.
Realizing that the man was asking about Tony, Steve stuttered out, “Oh no, I’m... babysitting.”
“Good afternoon, Miss Potts.”
“Alright, alright.” Clint raised his hands up in a ‘don’t shoot me’ manner. “Tony was always—you know—talking to you, hanging around you at the gym, teasing you. Things like that. Much more than to the rest of us anyways. You guys seemed close.” He said with a little shrug of his shoulders.
Steve let out a laugh before running as non-superhumanly possible.
Tony bit his lip, contemplating, before releasing a sigh. He then slowly pulled out his hand and opened his fist. The world’s largest pout formed on his face as he looked up at Steve with the drone in the middle of his palm.
Steve tilted his head, confused, and walked closer to the simulation, “Uh, guys?”
Yep, Tony began talking right after he woke up, and guess what his favorite word was?
“Why are you so calm?!” Tony ran to his tossed boxers and hurriedly put them on, only to groan when he felt Steve’s cum dripping out of him. “If I get things thrown at me I’m making you clean the pool.”
the one with whom you don’t feel safe.
A muscle jumped in Tony-dupe’s jaw, and he speared Steve with an unforgiving gaze. “You smell that lovely odor emanating from your mouth, Steve? It smells like fresh-baked bullshit.”
“So make me understand, Rogers!”
He left before Tony could question him further, and Tony found that he wasn’t even irritated with Steve for just walking away. He found his eyelids falling shut a moment later, and he managed to ask Jarvis to turn off the lights before falling asleep.
Steve furrowed his eyebrows. “A guide?”
Steve attempted to swallow down the large ball of emotion that had lodged in his throat, but it was a futile gesture. He slowly turned his body, and his stomach clenched as he locked eyes with Tony. He was dressed in a pair of stone-washed jeans and a gray raglan shirt with red sleeves. The look was comfortable, but uncharacteristic of what Tony Stark was known to wear. The outfit that he donned was something that Steve had always secretly wished to see him wear, if only just to see Tony in something that was normal to Steve.
Steve looked back toward the elevator and made up his mind, “I’ll be right back.”
“You,” Steve said softly, “Have no idea, do you.” He reached out a large hand, resting it against Tony’s cheek before sliding his thumb across Tony’s bottom lip.
“No, I asked the pirate to help me,” Tony said with a bashful smile. “You really like it?”
Tony huffed but stayed awake, even beginning to perk up when the door slid open to reveal Steve’s floor.
Steve closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Maybe Tony needed a cool down period. Maybe they
the building much less work for five-straight hours with a torch three inches from their faces.
Geez, this really hid
Bruce shook his head, “Not much, I’m afraid. It’s probably going to happen again… and more often as he ages.”
Tony’s eyes widened and a big grin developed on his face, “Really? Can I go see her?”
Shifting from the scars, Steve led a series of pecks towards Tony’s right nipple. He allowed a smirk to appear as he gave the nipple a lick, and tightened his hold on Tony when he heard him gasp. Tony’s grip on his shoulder moved to the back of his neck and the hand that was on the wall went to grip his bicep, as if he was preparing himself for what was next.
“Captain, it would be best if Shield takes him to find out a way to cure him of,” Fury gestured at the curiously blinking toddler, “… This.”
The fabric was being stretched to its max, Tony’s cock already stiffening up and pressing tightly against the sheer fabric. Steve lightly dragged a finger from the middle of Tony’s balls and traced the veins up to the tip of his cock, rubbing at the dampness forming there.
Steve locked his eyes onto Tony’s and gave a loving kiss to the bundle of jagged scars in the center of his chest—making Tony’s heart jump and causing him to fall a little more in love.
When he was positioned near Clint, Steve jumped off and landed on the grass with a soft thump. Clint quickly slid off his load and swung it at Steve, who jumped and narrowly missed having his legs tied by the bag’s straps.
The sudden stop of Tony’s laugh and his dropped smile would have been comical if it didn’t result in a disaster.
“Steve, the stove is whistling.” Steve felt a tug on his pants and looked down. He saw Tony staring up at him, his hair a mess and eyes slightly bleary from his nap.
Steve watched as Tony ran inside in just his boxers, an amused smile on his face. He got out of the pool and picked up Tony’s shorts and tank top. As he neared the kitchen, he could hear the sound of drawers opening and the sound of objects thudding against the wall.
“Thor, I wasn’t expecting you until later,” Steve said as Thor got up to greet him with a hug.
Tony could barely take a breath before Steve was in and out again and again and again.
“Alright, but I’m warning you, I’m not as good as Nat.” Steve said as he got up from kneeling.
“Off, your shirt, pants, off,” Tony said as he tugged at the T-shirt Steve was unfortunately covered by.
Tony avoided his eyes, choosing instead to look at his hands, but still nodded, “Okay.” Bruce let out an almost inaudible sigh and patted Tony’s head softly before heading to the kitchen.
“Who said Clint was the one using them?”
“Since you asked so nicely.” Steve gave Tony a kiss on the cheek.
“Fuck.” Steve whispered, before his thumb rubbed against Tony’s exposed hole, circling it as if hypnotized. His digit dipped in, feeling the slight give, and came out covered with a slick sheen.
“Hand me that, would you?” Steve nodded towards the Captain America toy on the couch.
“Yucky!” Steve heard Tony say, forcing a sudden laugh from him.
He spent the next few minutes studying Tony, from his plump pink cheeks, to the small fist clutching at Steve’s index finger—memorizing this moment—because in six hours, this Tony wouldn’t exist anymore.
He never saw Tony this carefree before. Yeah, he was going to miss it.
He was barely able to graze his fingers over it before Steve backed away, holding him a good distance away.
The second the elevator dinged open, he felt a small weight crash into his legs and wrap around them like an octopus. His hand automatically came down to rest on top of soft hair and looked at Bruce, who was leaning against the elevator wall.
Feeling wetness against his collar and Tony’s trembling, Steve lifted his head and looked at Tony’s face. The little boys face was red and streaked with tears. His eyelashes were clumped together and Steve noticed a smudge of black soot on his forehead.
As they waited inside Shield’s elevator, Steve’s keen eye caught the sight of a small lump hidden by some fabric. “Tony, what’s in your pocket?”
Tony nodded vigorously, “I drank it all even though it was yucky.”
“O-oh, f-fuck,” Tony stuttered, fists clenching against the sheets. He opened his eyes—not even sure of when he closed them—and saw his cock, creating a large tent as it strained against the panties. The small damp spot was steadily growing larger as Steve rocked back and forth.
Suddenly, they felt a rumble and a large burst of lightening struck what felt like inches away from Steve.
“Uh-huh,” Tony nodded his head up and down.
“Ready, honey? I’m starving,” Steve said as he walked over with only a towel wrapped around his hips. A hand on his waist and a kiss on his cheek distracted him just enough before he realized what drawer Steve was about to search through.
With a little nip to Tony’s bottom lip, Steve disconnected their mouths and began to trail kisses from Tony’s jaw to his neck. “What were you planning, Mr. Stark?” He whispered.
Steve glanced at the elevator, surprised that she was visiting at this hour, “Let her in, Jarvis.” Steve placed his newspaper to the side as the elevator door opened and Pepper walked in.
Tony tilted his head, “Do what?”
“Tony! What has gotten into you today? Come out right now or you’re in serious trouble!” Steve knew he could open the door. He could just squeeze the doorknob until it fell off and drag Tony out, but that felt so barbaric and would probably scare any ounce of trust Tony had away, so he resisted.
Tony and Pepper dated. Everyone knew that. Then one day they just broke up and Steve remembered that week very clearly. Tony was in his lab more often than not, with the exception of maybe a shower. Steve wasn’t sure if he consumed anything besides coffee and a few granola bars, because when he took down a plate of sandwiches and placed them outside of the locked door, he saw the same plate, sandwiches untouched, in the kitchen later that day.
“Hold still, Tony. I can’t tie your skates if you keep wiggling away.”
Steve let out a huff and punched the next alien a little harder than necessary just to vent some of his feelings.
Steve—who grew up with his mom, who felt his mother’s love every time she worked late into the night—will never know the grief Tony, a mere four year old, is feeling.
Tony felt a flush forming, heat traveling up and down his body with each second that Steve’s eyes lingered. When Steve didn’t say anything, Tony stuttered out, “I-is it stupid? It is, isn’t it. I knew I shouldn’t have-“
“I promise,” Steve said and pinched Tony’s wet cheeks when he smiled.
“Um, Captain. There are dangerous things around and—um—well... he’s a bit,” The skittish scientist muttered, and gestured, “bouncy.”
“Yeah!”
Steve could only sigh. At least Clint wasn’t using the flaming arrows. Or the exploding ones.
He made his way over to Tony, who immediately looked up with a smile when he saw Steve.
Steve lifted Tony into his arms, “Time to get you cleaned up.” Tony whined and tugged the back of Steve’s sticky hair, “I know, buddy. I need to bathe too.”
“Yeah,” Steve whispered against his lips, “Something like that,” before their mouths met.
Tony shrugged, “Okay,” and popped open the vial before downing the potion. Everyone released an audible gasp, not realizing that Tony would willingly drink the potion without more convincing like most children, or that he would drink it so early in the day.
*****
“Has he still been getting headaches?” Thor asked loudly, a forceful grin on his face.
*****
“Hey, he took care you for me. Be good,” Steve reprimanded.
Holding his hard cock steady with one hand and Tony still with the other, Steve gradually filled Tony up.
“… I can’t say, Steve.” Bruce stared at Tony from his seat, a sad downturn on his lips, “But he may not.”
“Hah, more like tangled, knotted,
For the rest of the morning, Steve felt like a mother duckling—Steve wouldn’t be in a room without Tony a few feet behind him. So it came as no surprise that Tony tagged along when Steve headed down for team training.
“That wasn’t grape flavored,” were Tony’s last words before his eyes slipped closed and he slumped backwards like a marionette into Steve’s waiting arms.
“Tony, do you want your toy?” Steve lightly nudged Tony’s wet cheek with the toy’s soft arm to get his attention. Tony twisted his head up just enough to peek at what was touching him. He released his cradle on his left arm and slowly reached out, holding the toy tightly to his chest once it was in his hands.
“But Steve,” Tony whined, “Everyone is skating already.” Tony even emphasized the ‘everyone’ by pointing in the general direction of Natasha, Clint, and Bruce.
“I’m gonna let Tony hang out with Natasha for a bit. He should interact with more people than just me.” Steve gave a nod of thanks when he was handed a warm cup of hot chocolate.
“Are you sure? ‘Cause Fury is going to leave me a very long voicemail if he finds out some Shield tech is missing,” Steve raised an eyebrow, amused as Tony shoved his hand deeper in his pocket, fist clenching around something small and perhaps bee-sized.
Steve was lacing up Tony’s boots and poking Tony’s flushed cheeks when he wouldn’t stop fidgeting.
Steve put the kettle on the stove to boil while he rummaged around for the container of tea he got for rare occasions like this. Finding it, he prepared two cups before leaning against the counter and waited for the water to boil.
Steve got up and turned Tony around in his arms until his chubby cheek rested on Steve’s broad shoulders. Steve had to hurry, then. He didn’t want to have Tony fall asleep before he bathed and risk waking up a potentially grumpy toddler.
“Here’s your milk, Tony,” Steve said, and handed Tony his cup.
Steve had to look away and close his eyes, to calm down the anger and sadness that ripped through him.
But since when was Tony Stark ever sane?
“What?” Clint replied with a shrug, “The target’s seventy feet away, and besides, Tony’s standing behind me. Aren’t you, kiddo?” He looked down and winked at Tony, who shouted back an enthusiastic “yeah!”
“Shield wanted to keep him for observation.” Steve could see the frowns they each had between their brows tightened. “But I said no. We’re going to be taking care of him.” The tension immediately flew from their faces.
“You’re doing a wonderful job caring for him. Thank you,” Pepper said before walking to the elevator.
“I know. I’m sorry, baby.” Steve couldn’t help feeling guilty for putting Tony through this, even though he knew it was necessary. Steve continued soothing strokes up and down Tony’s back, “It’ll go away soon.”
As quiet as possible with his large frame, Steve slowly made his way over and concentrated on the footsteps the entire time. Within a few minutes, Steve could make out Natasha’s red hair between the tightly packed trees and their hanging branches. Quickly, since he knew she could slip between his grasps if given a head start, he emerged from the trees and immediately ducked to dodge her high kick. A session of hand to hand combat later, he finally had her arms behind her back and her body flat on the ground.
Steve, relieved with the assistance, also felt something was off. He squinted suspiciously at the jets, wondering if there was an even bigger attack coming that Fury didn’t tell them about.
“Cool! His belly felt like a pillow,” Tony said through a giggle.
Tony let out happy giggles and reached an arm out to grab Clint’s twitching nose. The sound of his laughter rang throughout the fifty-sixth floor and all four of them were enamored by the cute toothy grin.
Steve, on the other hand, had his attention caught by some silk ties on display. He had already gotten gifts for everyone—everyone but Tony, that is. What do you get for a man who literally could buy anything he wanted? Maybe the ties were too selfish. Just because Steve thought Tony pulled off the business suit look better than anyone else didn’t mean Tony wanted more ties to his undoubtably large collection.
“Yes! I did!” Thor exclaimed and marched across the room, stopping once he was a foot away from Clint and crouched down, tilting his body to the side so he could see the little boy and his wide, curious eyes, “I must say, you are quite adorable as a child.”
“Yeah?”
Tony’s eyes sparkled at the last suggestion, “I never ice skated before.”
“Model cars?” The group spoke as one, exchanging questioning looks.
Not expecting a person to be swinging at him, Clint’s eyes widened before barely catching Natasha with a loud, “Oof!”
With strong hands holding him and a large muscled body pressing him against a pool wall, Tony had no choice to take what Steve was dishing out.
Steve whipped around to look at the timer projected above him, and indeed time was ticking down. Of course, when he turned around Natasha was already gone.
Tony was silent, causing Steve to turn his attention away from the pan to look at him. Tony’s head was tilted down, hiding his face in Steve’s shoulder.
Steve wiped away the remaining tears from Tony’s red cheeks with his thumb and made his way to the bedroom.
“Nice, we might be home early for once!” Clint yelled out.
“Alright, little monkey, just one second,” Steve laughed and bent down so Tony could get on his back.
Tony tossed the empty bottle, letting it bounce off the couch and fall to the rug, and crawled onto Steve’s lap. His forehead leaned against Steve’s chest and eyelashes fluttered as he struggled to stay awake.
“Yes.”
Steve was moving so fast, in and out of Tony’s body like a jackhammer, hard enough that Tony felt like every breath was forced out of his lungs, like he had to struggle to keep breathing. He rubbed his face into his pillow, as if he could push back the intense pleasure just a little—have this last a little longer.
“Have I told you I love you?” Steve asked playfully and kissed Tony’s chin.
“Steve! Come on!” Tony turned slightly to him and waved a hand in the air.
Taking a deep, calming breath, Tony walked out of the bathroom and sat on the bed.
Steve felt like his heart turned to ice at the sight of what could only be an explosion. He sprinted out of the elevator, grinding the pieces of metal into the floor.
“Dum-E doesn’t eat food,” Steve said and began on wiping Tony’s hands.
“Put me down, idiot. He’s getting away.”
“Of course I won’t. I’m going to be in my room and you’ll be jumping on my stomach first thing in the morning,” Steve said and tweaked Tony’s nose. He slid into the bed next to Tony, who eagerly climbed on top of Steve until he was resting comfortably against his chest, “I’ll stay until you fall asleep, okay?”
“If you wanted the pool to us again, you don’t have to do that. The guys are probably scarred for life.” Steve smirked down at him.
Tony leaned his head back until it rested on the edge of the pool. “I think I’m getting hotter, Cap. Mind helping a guy out?” Tony smirked. He rested one hand on the wall underneath him and the other on Steve’s shoulder.
Their morning was going perfectly fine. Great, even. Tony woke Steve up by jumping on his stomach. They brushed their teeth together. Steve showered as Tony watched cartoons in the living room. They even made breakfast together, making scrambled eggs and toast like Tony wanted. It all went downhill when Tony wanted Dum-E to be present. Now they’re
Tony didn’t respond, instead, he bowed his head down. Steve frowned, “Tony?” And then he saw the subtle shaking of Tony’s shoulders and heard a sniffle.
Steve could feel Tony vibrate from anticipation, “What is it?”
Tony looked up at Steve, then at Bruce, Natasha, and Clint, before nodding with a smile. He let go of Steve’s jacket and placed his hand in the woman’s, where she walked him up the short red carpet and up to Santa.
“Steve,” Steve could have sworn he felt the man squeeze hand hand slightly before Steve let go to pat Tony’s head, “And this is Tony.”
With his palms and fingers still clenching Tony’s ass, Steve slid both thumbs in, and pulled. Tony’s voice left him before he even realized it. He felt so exposed. He could feel Steve rubbing against his walls, gentle and thorough as he was stretched more and more. As he panted he could imagine what Steve was seeing—his ass spread wide apart, and his hole gaping wide from just Steve’s thumbs.
Steve sighed, a smile already forming, “And what would that be?”
“Always gotta use the bathroom before you leave!”
They moved back to give Steve space as he pressed the emergency eject button.
That’s probably why he felt weird around her. She hurt Tony once and he didn’t want to see that happen again.
Tony eagerly nodded after each rule, “I promise. For real this time!”
Steve looked to where Tony was laughing his heart out as Clint tickled his sides and Natasha watched from her seat on the couch. A sad smile found its way onto Steve’s face.
*****
A tiny bee-like drone was zipping back and forth from one side of a ‘stage’ to the other. What looked like a pen in the hands of a scientist shot out a quick burst of laser, instantly melting a six-inch hole in a sheet of steel twenty feet in front of it. Monitors with displays of complicated graphs and numbers were placed all over the room, each one continually changing as more information was added and taken away.
“Worth it.”
Steve automatically hugged the boy to his chest and felt as if his heart was growing too big for his chest, “Of course, Tony. Anything for you.”
Steve gave another lick to the nipple, wrapped his lips around it, and sucked. As he used his mouth to tease the nipple, swiping and swirling the hardened nub with the tip of his tongue, he watched Tony’s eyes flutter and mouth part with every pant.
Steve sighed, whether with relief or exasperation he didn’t know, “I’m guessing they’re playing with the bee?”
Steve held up a hand to stop Josh, whose face was steadily getting redder, from explaining, “It’s alright, Josh. I knew he was gonna do something like that.” Steve smiled, “Thank you for watching him.” Steve stuck his hand out.
it,” Steve said with a grin. This was going to be a bit of a challenge, especially with Natasha’s and Clint’s experiences in the field, but one he was sure he would succeed.
With the densely packed trees and the no super speed rule, Steve’s best option to get there quickly was to jump from branch to branch like earlier. As Steve balanced himself and jumped from tree to tree, he began to feel a bit like the character in that movie they watched last month. What was it? Tarzan? Lucky for Steve, the simulation trees weren’t rotten and he didn’t have to worry about a branch snapping from underneath him.
The sound of the door opening along with a burst of warm air had Tony quickly shoving the box under a pile of his shorts in the drawer.
“I’m sure.” Steve held the toy’s right arm between his finger and thumb, “I don’t need much sleep, you guys look exhausted, and Tony’s been studying gravity long enough.”
“I wouldn’t mind,” Natasha said.
closed and yanking the other drawer open. “Your clothes are here!” He pulled out a shirt to prove it.
The fight proceeded with Clint using his acrobatic skills to dodge Steve’s punches while trying to attack Steve’s weaker areas, namely his back and legs. Steve, on the other hand, was monitoring Clint’s moves, seeing a pattern form every time Clint made a jump and tried to swipe at him. Clint may have been tricky, but he was also slower than Steve.
“Tony, do not make me come in there. Open the door.”
Steve walked to the elevator, turning around right before he stepped past the open door.
“Go hit the shower and sleep, guys.” Steve said when he saw Clint’s head start drooping. “I’ll bathe Tony and get him to bed too.”
bad idea,” Steve said as he tossed his shield, slicing through three aliens like jelly.
“Jarvis?” Tony’s eyes widened and he looked around the room searching for the source of the voice.
Tony sat on Steve’s lap, alternating between playing with Steve’s fingers and throwing his Captain America toy onto the floor just to see it be picked up and placed in his hands again.
“Of course you aren’t! It’s just for your... health.” Bruce said.
Steve blinked at her, feeling like a deer caught in the headlights, “Oh, alright. Thanks for stopping by.”
Steve saw through it though, the hesitation Tony felt every time he disappeared into his workshop instead of crashing onto the couch like Clint after a mission, or when he would skip their Friday dinner party, which would result in Steve carrying a plate down to the workshop because he knew Tony didn’t eat breakfast or lunch.
The question came as a slight surprise to Steve, since throughout the years Steve had known Tony, he never noticed him as a very festive man. Sure, there were holiday galas and the extremely generous bonuses Tony gave to his employees, but Tony was never around to decorate the tree, or up for watching what Clint would consider “holiday classics”. Heck, unless continuously urged by Steve, he wouldn’t have even been in the same room as the rest while they open presents Christmas morning—a strange thing considering how many presents Tony liked to splurge on them.
“... Call him.”
Bruce made his way to one of the bags and pulled out a can of baby formula and bottle.
Natasha responded as calmly as anyone could be in a situation like this, “… We have a problem.”
Steve stood up and carried Tony to the bathroom, taking extra time to get Tony ready for bed compared to the night before. Brushing each little tooth carefully, wiping Tony’s face with a warm washcloth, and changing Tony out of his clothes. Each step was slow and gentle, and always returned with a little toothy smile from Tony. By the time he was done, Tony was swimming in an outfit big enough for a small child.
His first instinct was to flip the room upside down to search for the missing boy, but right as he was about to, Jarvis’s voice came from the ceiling.
Once that week was over, Pepper came, stepping out of the elevator like a furious lion, and went to the lab. Steve wasn’t sure what happened but he remembered hearing shouts as he sat on the communal floor’s couch, and things being slammed, and then Pepper was dragging a haggard-looking Tony up and pushed him into a seat in the kitchen. Food was shoved in his mouth and Steve heard her mumble, “I still care for you, Tony, just not like that,” before she kissed his cheek and left.
Steve turned around and walked out of the office, the door slamming shut behind him. Clint, Bruce, and Natasha immediately stood up straight from leaning against the wall in the hallway when they saw him.
. He felt like he was going to slip every time he kicked one. And of course when they were down one member, there were more aliens too.
Tony smiled, exhausted, and wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck, pulling him down until they were touching from head to toe. “Maybe once or twice,” Tony said.
myself,” Clint grinned as he struggled with the bags as well.
“Thanks for taking care of him,” Steve said with an amused smile. He knew Fury wasn’t as mad as he seemed.
“Great timing, Thor. We need to keep the perimeter secured. There are more of these things than you think,” Steve said, putting emphasis on what ‘secured’ meant by tossing his shield through two more aliens.
No Tony. That means the two switched off while Steve was looking for them.
“Jarvis, what time is it?” Tony muffled through his welding mask as he placed the torch down next to an unfinished metal arm. He pulled the mask off his face and placed it down next to the torch before running a hand through his sweat-soaked hair.
Natasha immediately lifted Tony up and placed him on Clint’s back. A great big grin appeared on their faces as Clint ran over to stand in front of the tree with Tony’s face popping up from behind his shoulder. Natasha and Bruce went to stand next to them as Steve got in position to take the photo.
“When?!” Tony pushed Steve off him and hunted for his clothes.
“Pardon me,” the man laughed, “I just saw you staring at the ties and thought it might be for a husband, seeing that you had a child with you.”
“Do you think Tony took over r&d yet?” Clint joked, stretching his arms above his head as they walked down the hall.
“Whichever way seems easier to you.” Bruce shrugged, “But probably as Tony is sleeping, since the change will take about six hours.”
“Smarty-pants,” Steve said as he tickled a giggling Tony’s side. “Sure, it can watch, but
“I’ll make Tony’s milk. Quite surprising that he hasn’t cried for food yet.” Bruce gave a fond smile at Tony before going to boil some water.
A nightmare.
“Thanks for making me happy again.”
Anything with wiring, Tony would strip them down—laptops, toasters, remotes, even Steve’s communication ear piece—breaking them down to their basic components, study them, and rebuild them back all over again. It reminded Steve so much of Tony as an adult when he saw those dexterous hands moving like lightning—trying to keep up with the pace his thoughts were going—that it made his heart pang a little within his chest.
Tony took longer to come back compared to before, almost unmoving for two minutes, but when he did he was all smiles.
“Oh, sure,” Steve said and handed over the camera. Bruce looked at the various buttons a bit confused but once Steve explained which button did what, Bruce got the hang of it.
As the suit opened up, the soft sobbing noise from inside became much clearer.
“Are you alright?” Steve asked, wiping away tears with his thumb. “Tell me why you’re crying.”
“Let’s just say it involves the maternity ward and rhymes with ‘magenta’.” Maria smirked at Clint’s disgusted face.
Steve gave him a glare, “Yes, really. Are you going to tell me or not?”
“I’m glad to hear that. I’m Aiden, and you are?” The man stuck his hand out with a grin and Steve automatically went for the handshake.
An empty bottle dropped to the floor with a light thud. With her ex-assassin speed, Natasha grabbed the pink bottle and placed it next to the eight empty trays of take out (four of those belonging to Steve) scattered on the dining table.
In the silence, a distressed wail escaped from the suit.
I just want to say I love reading your comments cause it makes me feel like I’m writing something people are enjoying. So thank you!
“Oh. My. God.” Clint whispered.
Steve pulled his cock out of Tony until only the head was in before pounding in and filling Tony up again.
“That’s incredible!” “This could change how we gather intel!” “Tell me you recorded everything!” The scientists excitedly shouted out. Notebooks and tablets were being passed back and forth between them, each one widening their eyes at what Steve could only guess were numbers and diagrams.
“Of course, Captain. You’re one of the few midgardians that can best me on occasions,” Thor said happily before he shoved some bread into his mouth. “But where is Tony? He usually follows you around like a shadow.”
It took Tony ten minutes to transition from sobbing to occasional sniffles and even then Steve was reluctant to release him from his arms. It was only when Tony spoke did Steve loosen his hug.
“Welcome to Santa’s Workshop! Santa’s very excited to meet you!” She held out her hand with a happy smile and Steve lightly nudged at Tony to accept.
Why did Tony have to love such an evil man?
Steve shot Fury his best stern glare, the one that left him winning almost every argument. “I said
“I called Pepper and told her what happened.” Natasha said when she saw the three men’s surprised face. “She’s in Malibu right now but said she’ll come back as soon as possible.”
“How was your skating lesson?” Steve asked.
” Natasha asked.
“It appears that the aliens you fought have returned. They seem to be concentrated within Central Park but are steadily progressing outwards. Director Fury requires all available Avengers to the scene.”
“Ugh, I’ll keep that in mind,” Clint replied, heaving with a goofy smile. “Tricked you, though.”
Sure enough, Clint had both of his arms and Bruce’s full of appliances and gadgets. “You know, you’re supposed to buy gifts for
“No!”
“I’m sure they probably glued him down to a chair so he couldn’t touch anything,” Natasha said.
“The bath is ready, Captain.” Jarvis’s voice echoed throughout the room and caused Tony to tilt his head curiously up to where he thought the voice came from.
Tony as a toddler was much more open to affection than when he was an adult, Steve lamented mentally as he stared into those big dear-like eyes. While Tony was friendly to everyone, willing to give a helping hand when unasked, when they try to help Tony, however, said man would shield himself from them, preventing himself from forming a relationship that could be described as more than just “Team Members.”
Tony’s hips were still jerking, trying to find release from the cock still inside him. Steve pulled out, much to Tony’s protest. He carried Tony to the more shallow part of the pool until he could lift Tony out of the water and lay the upper half of his body on the wet pool deck. Steve kneeled in the water with Tony’s legs around his shoulders.
The elevator door closed shut behind the team as they arrived at the communal floor in the tower. The large area was tastefully decorated: floor-to-ceiling windows acting as walls showed off the beautiful night view of the city, the walls were painted a dark grey, contrasting against the light wooden floor, and in the center of the room was a modern fireplace. To the left of was a matching kitchen, its island counter overflowing with pastel giftwrapped boxes and bags along with containers of the team’s usual takeout.
“S-steve?” Tony said to the man just outside, “Could you come in here?” Hearing Steve’s shuffling, Tony began pushing himself up the bed until he was in the middle. He didn’t know where to put his limbs. Should he cross his legs? Not with this thing on. Lie on his side? On his back?
“Are you sure, Steve? We don’t mind helping.” Bruce asked as he bent down and handed Tony his—once again—thrown toy.
“… I thought she was my mom.”
“You got it, and remember who to root for?”
Steve let the information absorb for a moment before solemnly nodding.
Now, Steve was relaxed against the white sofa, a soft smile on his face, as he watched Tony waddle between him and the toys spread out on the cream rug. Calling Tony energetic, especially after having woken up and being fed, was an understatement.
“It’s not ugly!” Clint cradled leaned Tony against his shoulder, an arm underneath his bottom and a hand patting against his back. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. C’mon, Stark. Shhhhh.”
A shocked gasp left Tony and his eyes widened, “A robot!” He quickly left Steve and ran to Dum-E, which had begun chirping as it met its creator.
“My dad said it’s ok, right?”
“Jarvis, is Bruce awake?” Steve asked, as he got his toothbrush.
Tony walked to the refrigerator and relished in the burst of cold air that hit his body when he opened it. He stood there for a few seconds before grabbing a bottle of water, twisting off the cap, and downing the precious cool liquid. His eyes, which had closed unintentionally the second water hit his tongue, snapped open when he heard a splash outside. Tony closed the refrigerator door and stepped closer to the glass door that opened up to their massive pool.
“Yeah! I want a car collection!” At that the group began laughing—Tony’s wish for a car collection certainly became a reality, if his garages had anything to say about it. But after the whole disassembled toasters and laptops situation, Steve was just glad Tony hadn’t wished for a laser or some type of power tool.
Steve’s eyes snapped opened. He looked around the room alert and confused before focusing on the source of the voice. Tony was in the outfit Steve dressed him in yesterday night, no longer drowning in the fabric but filling it out perfectly. He sat on the bed grinning, his black hair poking out in ten different directions, and the epitome of a cheerful four year old.
Steve opened his eyes, pulled out of sleep by habit. His room was quiet except for the clock ticking on his table. Light seeped through the curtains, signaling the early beginning of the morning, and a quick glance at the clock told him it was seven.
“Shit! Jarvis, what’s the time?”
Tony’s face twisted into a bewildered expression. “Are you even listening to yourself, Pepper? A year ago, you would’ve probably covered Steve up in bubble wrap and spoon-fed him homemade hot cocoa until the color returned to his face!”
Steve yanked his hand back and stared at Peggy with wide eyes. “What is this?” he breathed.
“I think you need this place more than I do,” Pepper smiled. She wiped fresh tears from her face and dried the tips of her fingers on her dress. “And maybe the Captain does, too. The house is quiet and secluded…I think you both need some down time. And if any more stray heroes find their way here, well, at least I know you won’t be alone.”
He pushed his legs over the side of the mattress, bunching the sheets near the foot of the queen size bed. Steve had slept in this bed before, and he’d shared its limited space with Tony. He raked his eyes over the right side of the bed and found that the bedding was undisturbed. His first thought was that Tony was puttering around in Clint’s barn and hadn’t made it to bed again, but he pushed the absurd notion away.
Steve fixed an empty gaze on the plate sitting in front of him. “It’s all right. We’ve all recently experienced unpleasant events that have left us all…unsettled.”
Steve’s right eye twitched in annoyance as soft, plush carpet hugged his toes, cradling his full weight. He hated fighting barefoot. The muted sound of Dorothy Lamour’s “You’ll Never Know” played in the background, growing more loud and clear with each step he took. A tremble danced in Steve’s fingers, and he quickly shook it off. He knew this song. It had been a popular tune with the dames left behind waiting for their soldiers to come home. Steve had listened to the song once with Peggy, and he would never forget how the soft light of the bar lanterns had framed the lovely sheen in her eyes before she blinked, and it disappeared.
“What for?”
Tony-dupe snorted and rose to its feet, gently releasing Steve’s hand. It moved to stand in front of Steve, sticking its thumbs in the jeans pockets. The sight of Tony basically lounging about in Average Joe clothes and bare feet was enough to tickle Steve’s fascination in a way he wasn’t sure he could decipher. The playful smirk that bloomed on Tony-dupe’s mouth wasn’t helping the situation.
Silence echoed in Steve’s ear for a long heartbeat. “Yeah, someday,” Bucky finally huffed. “So whadda ya say, soldier? You ready to earn that ride home?”
“Sing with me, Stevie.
“Going back to work?”
The boy was a physical manifestation of Steve’s dearest dream, and he was perfect in every way. Steve reached out and touched the boy’s cheek with shaky fingers. He glanced back at Peggy, desperate for any sign from her, be it confirmation, or simple support. He noted that her belly was flat, and the sight made his nerves itch. Steve pushed Peggy from his thoughts and turned back to the boy.
Steve ran, tearing through any Chitauri that dared to step in his way. One of the aliens managed to knock his feet from beneath him, and he rolled into the fall, jumping back up as soon as he found some traction. They had all been fighting beside a united world army for two days, fending off wave after wave of enemy forces without any real rest. Sam and Natasha were at a severe disadvantage due to lacking the enhancements that pushed Steve, Bucky, and T’Challa to keep moving forward.
Steve ran a shaky hand down his face, pulling lightly at the ends of his beard. He was surprised to find his facial hair combed and well-conditioned. It had been quite some time since he’d bothered to properly groom the wayward fuzz on his face, and yet, he could smell the faint scent of sandalwood and oakmoss clinging to the coarse hairs. Someone, or some
Okay, most of his attention had been fixated on the event - mostly because a large chunk of his inner friend circle had scattered into the infamous four winds of the earth without being seen since. Clint had taken off after Natasha before the dust had settled around the ruins, taking nothing from the Tower but his weapons and a change of clothes. He’d offered Tony a smile and a two-fingered salute before stepping into the elevator, and Tony had known in that moment it would be a long while before they would meet up again.
The day’s events had drained Tony in the worst of ways, and he found that he didn’t even want to protest as he was led to bed. “Are you going to tuck me in and read me a bedtime story, Cap?”
Sadness touched Strange’s features. “Death has no cure, Stark.”
, if someone would only just fucking reach out. But, there was that little promise he had made to Pepper, wherein he had stated that he was done being a superhero.
Tony-duped laughed, the sound deep and throaty. “Well, now, it would be rude of me to ruin a surprise, wouldn’t it?”
Steve snorted, swallowing a chuckle. Alaric needing to have the last word reminded him of Tony. The thought hadn’t even finished forming in his mind as Alaric’s visage rippled, contorted, and he watched the ends of the boy’s bangs bend into loose, unruly curls around his face, framing his darkened brown eyes. A playful smirk bloomed on Alaric’s face, and it fully displayed the infamous Stark charisma. Steve started in his seat, gripping the back of the chair tight with both hands.
,’ he thought. ‘
to attend, it was that he forgot to make it on time more often than not, and that never sit well with Pepper. Five months of having to look at her pouty “
“Hey, none of that. Mi casa es su casa and all that jazz, no matter where the location. Any house that’s in the Stark name is your home, too, by default.”
Thanos filled Steve’s vision as his eyes finally cleared, and he was larger than Steve had imagined. He scanned the area and recognized one of Tony’s companions to be the kid from Queens. He recalled Natasha disclosing that Queens was Spider Man. The second companion was a stranger, and from what Steve could see, he was a flyer who wielded magic. Whether he was the one who cast open the portal was open for debate.
But they
Pepper laughed and pulled away. She trailed her fingers down Tony’s arms and squeezed his hands. “I know you do, and I’ll always love you. But we’re just not meant to be, Tony.”
He pushed through the doors and practically waltzed in to the dining room. Pepper was sitting at one end of their formal dining table, her long, painted nails curled into the smooth finish of the mahogany table. She was wearing the look Tony had come to hate, and it broke his heart that he wasn’t capable of giving Pepper the normal life she so desperately craved.
“For being you.”
“I was merely trying to show my gratitude.”
Steve raised his head in time to see three figures push through the opening of the portal, and while his vision was still blurry, he could clearly discern the red and gold that marked Iron Man’s form.  A large alien figure followed the trio through the portal, and the concentrated malice radiating from the being confirmed that Steve was staring at Thanos. Fear gripped Steve’s heart, choking off what precious breath he had in his lungs.
Tony-dupe sighed and offered Steve a tired smile. “Walk around, explore. Spend some time with your son.”
Tony’s doppelganger dropped its gaze and stretched its toes, pressing the tips into the wood flooring. Steve waited for an answer, but Tony 2.0 seemed pre-occupied with branding toe prints into the clean floor. Minutes passed, long seconds that wore down Steve’s nerves like magnified sunlight on water. He was one second from grabbing the entity wearing Tony’s face and putting it through the nearest wall when it finally raised its eyes, glancing up at Steve through Tony’s long, sooty lashes.
“Shh, d-don’t talk,” Tony choked, shaking his head. He ordered Friday to scan Steve’s body, and Steve knew the action was meaningless. He was dying, and nothing could stop Death from taking her claim. Strange and Queens shuffled near, but their footsteps were drowned out by Bucky’s voice.
“I didn’t even touch my face for that long!”
He took in a short, choked breath, and it tore through his body like a bullet, leaving a trail of disintegration in its wake. “Looks like I’m finally going home,” he meant to say, but what came out was, “H-home.”
“Well, now you have to wash them again.”
Peggy was pregnant.
A dry laugh rumbled in Steve’s chest, and he tucked its remnants deep into his memory. He saw Bucky run toward a large mob of drones, bright sunlight encasing his metallic arm with a deadly gleam. It was ironic that an antiquated future, in the form of two worn out super soldiers, was all that currently stood against a future that no man had ever dared to envision.
Tony sighed and ran a hand through his hair before throwing on a clean t-shirt. He’d showered earlier in the afternoon, and that had to count for something at least. He didn’t keep up with hygiene issues when he was off from SI duties. Tony sprinted out of the lab and followed the marbled corridor that led to the dining room. He stopped just outside the wooden French doors, grateful that the frosted windows allowed him that extra nanosecond he needed to paint a sunny smile on his face.
Tony spent most of his free time watching the news in his new lab and keeping watch. He hated that he felt like the proverbial mother left at home while her family went to war. He wanted to be there for his team. He needed to lend his support, to help where he could, to fight by them. He’d drop everything and
“No, my darling, I merely offered you a chance. You were the one who fought to live, and your courage saved us both.”
He took the weathered, oversized gym bag out of Steve’s hands, barely holding back a rude noise of disgust when his fingers sank into a thick coat of dirt and grime that covered the black, nylon handles. He tossed the red bag to the side, ignoring the sharp clang of Steve’s shield hitting the floor. The sound echoed throughout the large foyer, rattling Tony’s bones. The metal seemed to be singing a ballad of an untold war, one where the outcome had resulted in an infinite loss.
“Good evening, my beautiful, sweet, honey-bear.” Tony swept in and pressed a kiss to her temple. The rich fragrance of Chanel N° 5 clung to her strawberry blonde hair, and he couldn’t help taking in a greedy inhale. “I’m sorry I’m late, I got lost on the way here – you know, new house and all. I really do think we need some signs in the halls, just until we get a real feel for the place.”
“What’s for dinner?” He asked, taking a seat at the other end of the table. “It must be something good. I smell truffle oil wafting through the air.”
“Oh, Steve,” Peggy sighed, leaning back in her seat. She reached out and stole a piece of bacon from Steve’s plate. It disappeared in three bites. “Really now, I thought you were past the shock phase. I’m almost past the second trimester.”
“It’s your ass that always needs savin’, Rogers,” Bucky quipped. “Best keep your focus on what’s in front of you.”
Steve jerked his head up toward the wooden awning and was greeted by the sight of Clint’s upside down, smiling face. “Clint?” he breathed, taking a shaky step toward his friend.
“Really, Steve? After our time of heartfelt camaraderie, I really think you should call me Tony.”
Steve took the offered plate from Peggy’s hands, and a choked whine sounded in his throat. His eyes were glued to her lovely face, tracing every fine detail with a hungry gaze.
“Sam, on your left!”
Steve stepped toward Tony and placed a warm hand on the man’s shoulder, lightly squeezing the side of Tony’s neck. “You tried,” he pointed out, “and that always counts for something. You’re a good man, Tony Stark.”
“Friends take care of each other.”
“It was rude of me to show up unannounced at your home.”
“You all right, Rogers?”
It was heartbreaking that the act of rallying the world had cost so many lives almost immediately after nations had vowed a pledge of peace. It seemed blood was always the preferred medium of the gods when they allowed roads of peace to be paved in their realm.
Steve whirled around in his seat, bumping his elbows into the steel border framing the table. A little boy stood behind him, and he guessed the child was about four or five. His heart lurched in his chest as he drank in the boy’s features. Chestnut brown hair framed a set of hazel eyes that were accented with thick brows, and Steve could see the artistic blending of his and Peggy’s nose and jaw shape in the gentle bends of the boy’s face. The cherubic curve of the boy’s mouth, however, belonged completely to his mother, and it made Steve’s heart hurt.
Steve punched through a pair of Chitauri drones and sent their broken remains into the hands of angry winds. “Maybe, but it’s not enough. I need you to use what strength you have to secure ‘Tasha and carry her off the field. T’Challa and his inner guard need to be evacuated and escorted to the safehouse.”
“What of it?” Steve asked, crossing his arms. He may have woken up with his chest intact, but he felt completely hollowed out.
Steve’s bangs fell across his forehead, framing his sweaty brow. He pushed through the horde, forcing his body to keep moving every time he took a hit. His shields moved through the air like weaponized ailerons, cutting through the smoke and the screaming and the blood lust with nothing but a whisper.
Tony offered Steve a small smile and pushed the man toward the dining room. He ignored how his hands appeared dwarfed when pressed against the large span of Steve Roger’s back. “You’re just in time, Cap. Dinner’s ready and there’s plenty to go around.”
Steve was around three when he made a conscious wish that he wanted his soul to be swept away by one of the waves cresting within the oceans of his mother’s eyes. He would be allowed to stay in the comfort of her love indefinitely. His fear of death had evaporated after he made the wish, and Sarah Rogers transcended her role of mother, and became his place of undying solace that was founded on life and death. It was a reassuring thought to know that no matter how he died, or where he died, he would always return to a place of honest love.
Steve’s eyes shot open at the thought of Tony, and he bolted upright in bed. He threw back the saffron colored blanket covering his body and ran both hands down his torso, checking for wounds. He felt whole, which was impossible, and he raked up the navy t-shirt he was wearing to inspect his body. There were no signs of open wounds, evidence of convalescing tissue, or scars. Steve had taken a direct hit from one of the Infinity Gems, but his torso was completely clear.
Steve grimaced as a hefty, metal elbow connected with his right temple. His eyesight filled with white light, and he pitched forward toward the burning earth. The back of Steve’s neck began to prickle, and he swung his right shield high, impaling the razor-sharp tip into a Chitauri’s skull. The lifeless form went down heavy, yanking Steve hard. He fell on his left side and slid across compacted rock and dirt, skimming the skies with a blurry gaze.
A chill raced up Steve’s spine, settling at the base of his skull, and he fisted the powder blue sheets still covering his legs with a desperate grip. He remembered dying in Tony’s embrace near the borders of Wakanda. Death had shut down Steve’s body, and it was a sensation that he had never experienced before, not even when the Arctic Waters had entombed his body. The freezing water had lulled Steve to sleep, pulling a blanket over his mind as it slowed the beats of his heart to a mere memory of a crawl. He’d floated for years, drifting in silence.
Steve stared at Tony-dupe for a long moment, trying hard to ignore the heat flooding his face. He felt stripped bare by its stare, and it was a type of vulnerability that he hadn’t felt since childhood. A gaggle of goosebumps erupted along the length of his arms, stretching out to the middle of his back. For a moment, he could feel the bitter cold that snuck in through the large crack in his window and set up shop in his childhood room. No matter how many pieces of wet paper his mother attempted to stuff it with, it was never enough to keep out the elements. The last thing that Steve had felt at night during the Winter months was the cold kiss of Winter’s breath as it pushed through his threadbare blanket.
exactly?” Steve hissed, spearing Tony-dupe with an unyielding gaze. “I know I died. I embraced death as I took my last breaths. Did you resurrect me on Thanos’ orders? Is my consciousness in a computer simulation? Are you planning to rewrite my brain? If your goal is to use me to do harm, I’ll fight you every step of the way, no matter what the cost.”
“I guide the energies of the lost…onward. Where I take them depends on the person. There are multiple heavens, Steve, and an endless number of hells.”
Steve watched his friend twist through the air, leaving an angry trail of lifeless bodies behind him. “You don’t have a choice, soldier,” he intoned, “I’m giving you an order!”
the one that caused you to lose trust in those who are supposed to protect the innocent, not Steve, or Bruce, or Clint, or Natasha.”
The tired sigh that was attempting to crawl up from Tony’s chest lost its footing at the sound of the doorbell ringing, and it promptly fell to a quick death much to his relief, landing in Tony’s stomach. The last thing he needed was to stoke Pepper’s ire even more than he already had. He jumped up from his seat and checked the video screen set into the wall beside the front door.
“It is currently 7:06, Sir,” the AI intoned.
“I consider you my friend, Tony. I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t. You’re also my brother in arms.”
Steve retracted his shields and rushed Thanos head-on, throwing his full weight at the alien. A guttural growl rumbled in his chest as he caught the metallic fist rushing toward his head. Steve held on tight, and with his remaining strength, he pushed the fist back toward its hateful owner. Resolve etched a determined expression on his face, smudging sweat and dirt into the fine lines around his eyes and mouth.
