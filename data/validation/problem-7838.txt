He tried to bend his arm to touch his presumably still-bleeding back, but it was too awkward a position for him to get anything but messy smears of red across the meat of his thumb. It was crazy, and he knew it was crazy-- he knew it was such an extreme measure, one that Tony himself wouldn't even want for him, but he'd heal, wouldn't he? Steve would heal. Tony wouldn't have to know.
Tony felt sick the way he always did when he was a little too loved. It was, again, a feeling wholly disconnected from desire— it was the feeling of wings set aflame by the sun. It was the aftermath of warmth, perhaps a few hours too early.
“I didn’t think you were the prom mom type,” Tony said, scooting closer to Steve. He wasn’t at his most natural, but Steve didn’t mind. His own palms were so sweaty that he’d almost dropped the bouquet a few times on the way to the damn room, after all. He couldn’t judge.
It was then that she displayed something that truly boggled Steve’s mind, something he thought only a prostitute or a stripper might wear. It was… in the
“Yeah,” Tony agreed, voice quiet and a little one-note. Steve couldn’t blame him. He figured Tony might have a migraine to last a hundred lifetimes, then. “Right. The tumor.”
He tried to take control. He really did.
“And you, Kang, can do nothing to escape the flat of my ebony blade!” the Black Knight cried, bringing the blade down on the murderer called Kang with a heavy, violent swing. The man flew upward from the force of the swing, his body landing at the end of a perfect arc with a loud
And there he was.
Steve laughed then, too, more genuine than he had before. He seemed less concerned, too, though he wasn’t entirely without the worry in his brow. “Yeah, well, the real thing was better. 3-Dimensional, and all. And I don’t think I knew how big it was, anyway, what with the skinny pants and all.”
His chest touching
Steve sighed, shifting closer to where Tony was on the bed so he could get an arm around the guy. Casual as it was, it was like fireworks had gone off on his nerve endings, skin set alight where Steve touched him.
He could clear his search history after the fact. He didn’t have to mention the stories if he found them, and hell, he didn’t even know that he’d find them. He didn’t have to do anything but look. And if he found something, he’d read it, and he’d understand it, and he’d… be better for it. That was how it went, right? He didn’t— He didn’t get all of the medical shit, he didn’t get all the parts of the brain and what was pushing against what or squishing what or why Tony’s head seemed to be imploding in on itself all the damn time.
Arriving at the restaurant, he started to panic. He couldn't see Steve which was a bad sign, maybe Steve had been late himself. Yeah maybe Steve was 4 hours late, who's he kidding. As he sighed a waitress approached him, deciding to be brave he asked if she'd seen a tall blonde guy, pale skin with blue ocean eyes, blushing as he said the last description.
. He waited outside of Tony's 'little' house (more like mansion to Steve). What made it worse was that it was pissing down with rain. That's how he ended up cuddling Sam and Bucky on their big coach that night, while Natasha screamed down the phone at Tony.
(See the end of the chapter for
If the doctors are quick enough Steve may be able to come through. After all he’s got so much to live for, hasn’t he? Even if he makes it through, his best friend was pissed off at him. Steve could be sure that he’d still want to be best friends. Nat and Sam barely have anything to do with him anymore, his roommate was barely an acquaintance... and the love of his life doesn’t love him like he used to.
So Bucky confess what happened between him and Steve. Only to get lectured by Sam and Nat about how he should have put Steve first because they're argument was over something small and silly. Like he didn't already know by now.
So Natasha took over for Tony, explaining that he seemed to be in shock but questioned him to what the problem was and why'd he have Steve's phone.
Please let me know what you think of this chapter in the comments xox
Once the nurses seen him try to open his eyes they were a tad bit hopeful but sadly it looked like they could barely be opened. A good sign was that he tried to speak, while keeping an eye on his heartbeat they rushed him down the corridor into a medical bay room.
Knocking both Bucky and Sam's arms they all looked. When Tony still didn't move or do anything. Nat took the phone off him to speak to Steve. She was shock to hear an unfamiliar voice. "Sir.. are you still there sir."
Groggily, Steve tried to open his eyes. But when only being able to open them into a squint, all he could see was a ceiling. Well that what he assumed it was anyway with the lights. He tried to ask where he was.
Will Steve pull through or is it time to give up?
Tony thought. Cause there was no chance he was going anything but the quickest he could. That's pretty fast despite what his age may suggest.
Tony didn’t know what to say, he had so much regret and worried in his mind and heart that he didn’t know what to do with himself. Constantly thinking if he’d remembered then this wouldn’t have happened. Hell if he’d of priorities Steve from the beginning they wouldn’t of been in this mess.
While they where discussing (more like a slight argument) about who Steve would stay with. They see doctors and nurses rushing to a room. The doctor who was talking to them was called to leave.
So that's what he did. Set off straight for Bucky's flat.
Tony, slowing down his sobbing, was ushered into the room by Nat, who was always the more friendly one towards him. When trying to explain the events of the night all the trio heard was a bunch of babble.
In Tony's Lab he was working on a little gift for Steve. To be completely honest he's been working on it since their 1 year anniversary. He knew how much Steve loved painting and drawing but was shy and insecure about it, Tony knew how worked up Steve could get over one of his assignments. the first painting Tony had seen was A) by accident and B) of him.
Tony finally got to Bucky's flat. As much as he and Bucky didn't get along he was willing to see him if it meant that he could make amends with his boy, who
So Bucky trudged his way through the mess on the floor, there was too much in the way earlier with no time to move it all. Once the door was opened he was face to face with
They all came to realise if Steve wasn't with Tony or with them, the big question was where was he. Tony told Bucky immediately to phone Peggy, cause surely he would have gone home and if they couldn't phone Steve, Peggy was the second best option. Tony was praying right now that he didn't know Steve as well as he thought. Steve would be at home and not out on the streets alone with just his thoughts.
“Yeah obviously we did end up fucking during my heat and only a few weeks later I was undoubtedly pregnant and feeling like my world was falling apart. I told him regardless, not wanting to keep such an information from the father and it went as expected.”
“No Steve. What I need to do is make my kids something to eat and you should leave”, the Omega bit out. Just anything to escape the dreaded after heat talk.
that wore him out.
He didn't notice the loud music blasting from an approaching car which came zooming at him. He was knocked backwards. The car didn't even stop, speeding even more to get away from the scene.
Walking towards the exit of the park Steve registered how cliché it was. Heartbroken and walking in the rain, all he needed to do now is burst out in song and it be like the movies. Oh boy, here come the tears again.
Ill be going to uni in 2 weeks so I don't know how soon ill get another chapter up.
Perhaps he should phone Bucky, he's sure that Bucky mentioned during the week that Sam and Nat wasn't being allowed over as he needed to study for his test next Monday.
Making it to the floor that the guy on the phone said they rushed to the  reception desk. "Steven Rogers.... we're hear to see a Steven Rogers" was the first thing Tony said or did when he got there. Thankfully the nurses under stood him and sent to get the doctor who tending to him after had given him their information.
Not worrying about showing up in style, he takes the closet car from the garage to the restaurant hoping that Steve was still there, while Jarvis was trying to get through to Steve's phone.
When Tony was woken up, Jarvis was alerting him that he had been locked down in his lab for 60 hours. how has he spent two and half days down here. The first thing tony did when he emerged from the lab was jump in the shower, you don't realise how sweaty and gross you get when your focused on something else. After a quick shower, Tony decided he should call Steve, to see what he was up to and if he wanted to come over now he had finished the ring. He couldn't wait to give it to Steve, once the studio is done he can present them both to Steve. See the way his eyes light up when happy, the cute little smile and the way he blushes. Sinful. Tony went over to his phone and noticed he had several missed called from Steve and 3 voicemails. He was confused, had something happened.
Hope you like it. Sorry I took so long to post a new chapter, I’ve got a lot of essays I have to write thanks to quarantine. :)

They all got bored of Steve eventually. At least he’d be with his mom who he knew loved him eternally.
"Steve...Hospital....accident....critical." Was all she made out. Steve, her poor Steve. Tears forming in her eyes lead both Sam and Bucky to be concerned. Natasha had never openly cried like that before. Looking at Tony she needed to snap him out of it.
The night was getting on and all of this crying was making Steve tired. Every time he managed to stop his crying he would find something that reminded him of Tony to only start crying again. He thought that by now he would have nothing left to cry. He checked his watch, he'd been sat there for at least
around the apartment was a good idea , even when Steve was home he was made to stay in his room and have to shout to check if they were decent.
He fucked up. He loved his boy so much but he's fucking this up. Steve's friends were right he was no good for Steve, how could he be. None the less, Steve will always be his mouthy angel who saw the best in everything but would throw a punch to 'fight for what's right'.
Bucky woke up from from his slumber to some asshole banging on his door. He struggled to get untucked from Nat and Sam, after their make up session
It was all such a rush, next thing Tony knows is a hospital bed is being wheeled past him into the surgery room with Steve on. He looked awful, face bruised and bloody. His poor boy Hirt so bad and it was all his fault.
Once in the Med bay the doctors and nurse was analysis his injuries, he seemed to be in pretty bad shape, the main doctor treating him recognized his name and face.
he could salvage their relationship.
All the while Bucky was becoming more and more confused. He was now joined by Sam and Nat who was intrigued by all the racket. "What are you on about, why isn't steve with you?" Bucky asked for clarification.
He just wanted Tony, just wanted to be loved by Tony. Was that too much to ask.
He listened to the first voicemail, Steve sounded so excited. "I'm nearly at the restaurant, I can't wait to see you. I've missed you so much and thank you for making it up to me, I understand you had work and I forgive you. See you soon, Love you. Bye".
Bucky, Nat and Sam was chatting next to him, relieved that Steve called and they could all apologize. As they didn't hear Tony speaking anymore, Natasha turned to him. Only to see his face pale.
Hope you like it :)
In the next chapter something bad happens. But what?
Everything would go back to the way they were, while Tony went to answer the phone the trio became more relaxed. They could all breathe, the tension was gone and Steve was alright. After all this call must be good sign that everything everything was alright.
Explain Steve's injuries however was the next step the doctor took. Explaining that he's gonna need a lot of support once he's out. While Bucky offered to take time from college, Tony stopped and insisted that Steve satay with him.
But now, now he was sure to succeed.
Who knew the small Omega pup could look this intimidating.
“Peter, you know I love you, but I would love you even more if you came down from there.”
The sudden low growl from Steve made him look up for another split second. The Alpha was clearly internally cursing out the statement, scent of anger rising quickly.
Steve laughed deeply. “I’m fine, thank you. And well, it’s not a lie if I say without you on the field it’s just not the same, at least for me.”
“Shit”, he began. “I’m so messed up, Pep”.
Bucky Barnes’ laugh was precious and no one could change Tony’s mind.
“Noooo.”, Tony mumbled into the warm blankets. God no, waking up, was torture.
Steve winced at what just happened. He messed up, messed up his chance of talking to the Omega. Damn it. The Alpha was desperately looking forward to both of them sitting down and holding a conversation what would eventually end up with Tony happily accepting his courting and a promising date.
The genius furrowed his brows at the scene but quickly gasped at the obvious facts. ‘Stunning Tony’, no it couldn’t be. Was Steve, the pure image of perfection, jealous? Because of a complimentary comment from Thor, a usual occurrence in the tower. The intimate times he’s spend with the Alpha already must have caused something deep inside of the blond, let loose a whole new set of instincts.
Tony’s eyes widened at the innocent comment, hand stilling on the Alpha’s head. “YOU WATCHED ME SLEEP?!”
Only then did the two dominant figures realize that somebody stepped between them, now blocking the stare off and flooding the room with a new scent, the scent of pissed off Omega parent. Well, fuck. Omega parents were a force to be reckoned with, every person knew that, thus Harley and Steve halted their snarls rather quickly, not wanting to provoke the older Omega even more so.
And there it was again, the pounding in his heart at just the sight of the Alpha.
Steve’s brows furrowed at the answer as he picked up the sour scent of the pup next to him, clearly filled with worry and misery at the state of one of his family’s pack members.
No, it was the fact that when he got up to go to the bathroom he ran straight into a sticky, fibery substance hanging from the ceiling. A minute of struggling to get out of it, got him stuck even more. He grumbled sleepily, while hanging in the fibers, swinging back and forth.
Hearing those words Steve wasted no more time and carried the whining Omega over to the big bed in the middle of the room. Throwing the shorter body down on the white duvet, the Alpha reached down to pull his own shirt off his body.
What was he supposed to do now? He was plainly aware that all of this was his fault, like usually. He was the one that kissed Steve in the elevator, which brought the following actions on and landed him in the bed of the respected Alpha. A very comfortable bed he noted.
Tony smiled at his rambling pup, never tired of the easily amazed nature of his boy who even managed to rope Harley, Bruce and Thor into the discussion of the benefits of a death star and the scientific needs for it.
The blond dutifully, though with a constant grin on his face, freed the genius a few minutes later, the webs thankfully dissolving slowly, and placed a chaste kiss on his lips. “Gotcha.”, he smiled.
Of course his mother looked beautiful. Always, no matter what he wore, the pup thought immediately. And, yes, Harley would do anything to see his Omega parent happy, anything to see his mother smile. Like he tried to do the past years.
God, Peter was a genius.
The pup was still looking at the screen in utter concentration, poking his tongue out in the corner of his mouth and grasping the controller tighter and not sparing a glance at the Avenger in the room.
“SHUT UP! SHUT UP!” Peter wailed at the tormenting comments about his mother.
Regardless Peter left the room after wishing his brother to get well soon and quickly ran to the elevator, food forgotten on the kitchen table. The ride down to the garage was quick and before the teen knew it he reached Happy’s car, the one Harley and him always got driven to school in. His mind was still occupied with concern, a nagging feeling clouding his thought.
“Screw this, looks like you’re not my third child but my eighth child. I’m leaving out Nat, Rhodey and Pepper as those three are the only other adults around the tower.”
“First of all-”
Curiously he picked a black shirt from one of the many piles around the Omega, holding it in front of his face he noted the mostly faded print by now, an indication of one of the many old band T-shirts he owned and loved. A smile spread on his face, the shirt was perfect for the date he was going to ruin anyway, a once in the life time date with Steve Rogers. Not too loose but not too tight fitting it was comfortable enough, now Tony just had to find a nice pair of pants to-
Two figures stumbled in clumsily. Steve was still holding Tony in his arms, strong hands hungrily roaming the Omega’s body as they reached Tony’s bedroom.
Steve squeezed his hand making the Omega lose his words. “The only reason we’re here today is because of your pup. Peter was the one helping me give you the courting gift, he told me the entry code to the lab.”
Leave it to Steve Rogers to talk about inflation on a date.
“Okay”, the boy simply answered, closing his eyes and blending out anything else that wasn’t his mother’s presence at the moment.
“Well, part of it is true.”
And that’s how they came face to face with the mess Peter had caused only mere hours ago. Tony promised himself, after that sight, Peter would never be allowed unsupervised in the kitchen again.
When Mr. Johnson arrived in the classroom Peter was already preparing his digital presentation and going over the slides one last time, all while Steve awkwardly sat on a chair next to him with a curious look trained on the many pictures of historic events hanging on the walls.
So I hope you liked it and thanks for reading!
“Anyway, I have 20 minutes to get you to school and I’m not planning to let you miss another class, kid.”
And, turns out, that did the trick.
“Shit, sorry Alpha”, he tried to apologize and, well, wrong choice of words.
And with that the elevator doors opened again and the kid left in a flash, leaving a speechless Alpha behind, openly gaping at the space the pup stood just a few seconds ago.
The understanding smile he received from the brown haired boy didn’t help at all and only hurt his heart more so.
His Omega was so fucking hot.
The kid only whined at the question and buried himself further into the warmth of the Alpha, not giving a real answer.
“But the pups, I don’t want them to suffer like-”
But at least he could pretend he didn’t feel his heart pounding whenever the tall, blond alpha walked into a room. Pretend he didn’t blush at the smile the hero gave him, those pearly white teeth and kissable lips seemingly just mocking him at this point. Pretend like he didn’t feel his hole get wet, an empty ache deep inside of him when Steve’s body brushed against his in the most innocent way possible.
The first thing Steve did when seeing the Omega walk towards him was die a little on the inside. Whatever the man did Steve wouldn’t have thought the Omega could look any more beautiful than he normally did,, but this, the outfit nearly forced the blond into an asthma attack Something he didn’t get since the forties.
“Uncle Thor what are you doing?”, Harley laughed, squirming against his mother and brother.
The silence that followed Steve’s short story left the table in a small bubble of content, with both of the men wearing a soft smile. A total different to the situation at the beginning. Steve just might have cracked the ice with that.
“Yeah, sure”, the boy replied with a small grin, standing up slowly and strolling into the kitchen without another word or look at the other two people in the room.
“Welcome to the land of the living, Pete. Did you sleep well?”, his Dad asked, smiling as he saw his son walk in sleepily in his pyjamas.
Sam cleared his throat. “Well, what exactly happened right now?”
“You okay?”, Steve asked the sweet Omega in his arms.
His pups helped with placing the dishes inside the dishwasher as well as restocking the fridge with the several foods they used for breakfast. All while Tony tried to clean the stove from Steve’s greasy bacon stains.
“If you’re really doing what I think you’re doing I swear to god Tony you better stop this childish act now”, she said exasperated.
“What the fuck! Steve get out now-”, another sneeze. “Please just go I-”, the man continued to sneeze like crazy and the Alpha was seriously starting to get even more worried.
Steve chuckled from behind him and trusted his three fingers against the Omega’s prostate firmly, forcing another moan from Tony’s mouth. “Keep sucking, I’m close too, Omega”, he ordered lightly.
Which was why when he made his way down to the lab on this Thursday afternoon he was excited and nervous at the same time, worrying what the Omega’s reaction would be. But he was overly positive Tony would appreciate the gift, if anything he’d be surprised as well.
Tony’s first date in roughly fourteen years and he was already failing at the simplest task there was when going on a date. At least he wasn’t alone, alone in the middle of the heaps of clothes laying around.
In spite of everything, however, Thor simply loved getting in a fight. He treasured a challenge against another strong Alpha, especially against the team leader, whom, for the looks of it, was close to charging across the room without another care.
He just had to breed this Omega until he was dripping with Steve’s cum, hole gaping wide and voice rough from screaming the Alpha’s name.
Which was why the Omega had to get away from the blond, the situation getting more risky the more both of them were confronted with each others scents. Tony breathed in deeply and the moan that involuntarily left him made him blush a deep scarlet. A scent! He moaned because of smelling Steve’s scent. What the hell, that never happened before.
The Omega inside of him was craving the touch of the tall, muscly, all American Alpha. Preferably not just a touch but a throughout fucking, though Tony could only dream.
The rising tension of a missing answer filled the table and Tony was innerly close to a panicking once again.
Not catching the eyes of either adult the teen simply looked down at his fumbling hands and let out a breath. “He’s staying home today because he’s not feeling well.”
“Nah I’m good”, the man casually answered and shoved the last bit of courting present into his mouth, the sound of loud chews audible.
“The kid asleep?”, Tony asked raising his head to look up at Steve’s face.
Steve was close to purring at the sight of the genius, as whipped for the Omega as he was.
“Get your Alpha under control again!”
His mother was sitting beside Harley’s side on the bed, running his fingers through his blond locks and purring constantly, a trick of omegan parents to calm their distressed young down. Harley was covered up to his nose by his blanket but the scent coming off him screamed hurt and sick, just like the noticeable shiver Peter could spot from the doorway.
The pup, even though he acted the way he did at home, hated attention at school due to his family name and the other students who thought he was just a snotty and spoiled brat, smarter than everyone and damn annoying. He was glad he did have a few friends, Ned and MJ, who were outsiders themselves and didn’t give a damn about his background. Yet, the comments and glares got to him.
While the two were still caught up in their small, but sweet moment, a sudden tud could be heard from above them, followed by a familiar chatter. The kid.
(Btw couldn't help myself at the end with the smut :))
Tony was pleasantly surprised how much he enjoyed the friendly exchange and the light flirting going on. And the best part, his head felt lighter, the nagging feeling of having to let Steve down and end the date now gone.
Tony nor Steve knew were it all went so, so wrong. Or rather when Peter behaved the way he did.
Yet, his jaw was itching. Steve knew something was missing. A mating bite. A bite to finally make the Omega his forever.
Steve didn’t know what would be worse.
Gripping the flowers tightly he cursed all the way back to the elevator, god, was he stupid, stupid for believing courting would be easy. Damn those movies for always making it seem so easy and achievable for normal people.
Two figures entered the kitchen, one he could scent from miles away, Tony and Rhodey, with whom he was currently in a deep discussion, judging from his flailing limbs and excited gleam in his eyes.
And yeah sorry for the late update but I'm currently in a bad mental state and working on it hopefully..
The Omega was surprisingly cheerful after the morning events, any doubts or insecurities not able to cloud his mind. Maybe it was just the presence of his pups near him, though, perhaps it also had something to do with the waiting Alpha in the kitchen.
The car ride home was spent in comfortable silence. Tony was leaning against the window, eyes dropping every few minutes, the tiredness noticeable and seeping into his mind more and more. Steve was concentrating on the road but kept stealing glances towards the Omega every few minutes, the sheer cuteness from a sleepy Tony being too inviting not to look.
Tbh I listened to the boku no hero academia openings while writing the whole chapter...my brain is mush now
Finally Steve managed to convince Tony to go on a date with him.
He wanted to stay like this forever. Being bound to the Omega in his arms, to Tony.
The genius rubbed his forehead tiredly. “For Christ’s sake, Pete, what did you take?”
That damn Alpha. What the hell were the two hiding?! “I DEMAND TO KNOW WHAT THE EVER LOVING FUCK YOU TWO ARE PLANNING!!”, Tony screeched angrily and pouted at the silence he was presented with.
Peter, still slurping his apple juice loudly, gazed at the flowers in Steve’s hands before looking the Alpha into the eyes with a raised eyebrow. “Business. Sure”, he commented knowingly. “He’s in the office down the hall, can’t miss it.”
The soldier, having questions written all over his face, raised one eyebrow. “Honey, do tell me how you got into that mess.”
One date and the Alpha already got to him. No, screw that, Steve has gotten to him since the day the Avengers officially moved into the tower.
“But-”
The grin grew wider on his face as the Omega tried to wrap his brain around his morning discovery. Oh how he wished he could take a picture of the man right now. Well, he could always ask Jarvis to do so but that would just come off as plain creepy and Tony wasn’t creepy just noisy most of the time.
Peter was covering his face, getting ready for the impact of the punch and praying it wouldn’t leave a bruise for his mom to find. But before he could feel pain he heard Jason wail in agony.
What do you guys think is up with Harley?
Harley snickered at the Alpha across the table. “Didn’t look like that half an hour ago.”
“Your pup must be okay with us dating or he wouldn’t have helped me like that, which means you don’t have to feel guilt in any way. You deserve to life your own life outside from your kids. It’s nothing shameful, Tony”, the blond carefully explained with another gentle rub to Tony’s hand.
And who could blame him? Steve was the fitting image of the perfect Alpha, the glorified version romantic novels, Tony’s secret guilty pleasure, always liked to depict in detail. He had the looks, the strength, the righteousness, the saving the world aspect and honestly a cock to die for.
Lunch was spend similarly with the same attention, only this time on a wider scale in the packed cafeteria of the school in which Steve naturally stuck out harshly, a tall super soldier Alpha not a usual sight for kids who weren’t Peter.
“Happy? Yes, uh, could you please come and pick us up? No no Peter’s fine but something happened and it’d be best to leave school for now.”
But he would really appreciate being fucked right now.
Steve’s head snapped over to the voice of his boyfriend and he gasped at the sight. The whole side of the room was covered in webs, looking right out of a horror movie, and Tony was right in the middle of it pulling at the fibers.
Tony, after ten minutes of trying to coax Peter down, gave up eventually and tugged at Steve’s T-shirt to get his attention. “Steve, I’m fed up. Go get Peter down from there.”
“Nothing could be more enjoyable than two Alphas challenging each other in a thrilling fight!”, Thor declared, not at all oblivious to the other blond’s stirring growls directed at him. Turning towards the Alpha he let out a growl himself, now clearly worked up and looking forward to the challenge.
He should have guessed he’d get a greeting like that.
The cock that thumbed against his gaping hole made the Omega struggle, his hands clenching the sheets for dear life, mouth letting out a string of pleads and whines. He was so fucking ready.
“Clint”, Tony sighed and slowly loosen his hold on the now content Alpha in his arms to look up at the now wickedly grinning Omega, who was eyeing the whole situation with too much interest for the genius liking. “Let me just remind you how you were cowering on the floor just a few minutes ago.”
And with that Peter sat down his glass again and took the controller back into his hands, starting the game anew.
The intense stare of Tony was a powerful weapon.
After a few more trusts, the Omega felt an intense, but blissful, pressure at his entrance. The Alpha’s knot was finally popping and steadily sealed Alpha and Omega together. Finalizing the breeding as cum flooded the Omega’s hole.
Tony’s eyes singled in onto the more than generous bulge and he gulped loudly, saliva pooling in his mouth. Damn, he was so ready to be wrecked.
“Steve, fuck, I’m sorry for Harley’s behaviour”, Tony admitted all of sudden. “But that doesn’t excuse your reaction either! He’s a young pup and you should have-”
“Mr. Rogers is now awake, sir.”
And wow. His pups couldn’t stop surprising him, could they? Tony smiled at the words, touched that his son was so considerate to actually try to build something from one of Tony’s favourite movies just to make him happy. He really had the perfect family.
What the hell could the man do? He wasn’t Tony, he wasn’t his mother and not even sure if he could call himself a friend.
After the phone call Tony sighed tiredly. God, being a parent was exhausting, especially the constant worrying.
“Pancakes!”
Damn, that panini head was using those old gentlemen Alpha tricks.
Sex with Steve Rogers sure wasn’t boring, Tony thought tiredly and sighed against the man’s thigh. He was so damn tired now.
What do you think about Tony's past?
“Peter! Pup, I'm sorry it took me so long. Are you alright?”, the blond asked worriedly as he moved closer to the teen who was still sat on the ground with little whimpers escaping his lips here and there.
“Peter, why is a super soldier sitting in my car at half past seven in the morning?”
Still, he regained his posture and looked at his kid in shock. “Wait you don’t remember what happened yesterday?”
The Omega was sure this wasn’t healthy, another side factor of not having an Alpha by his side while his kids grew up. But he was trying, really he was. Since Steve was, kind of, courting him and clearly interested in the older Omega, he tried to be open minded. That their conversation was probably nothing serious.
“Steve?”, a sudden voice, his voice, sounded from across the room. “What are you doing here? And most importantly, how did you get into the lab while I’m working?”, Tony asked suspiciously, setting down the gadget in his hand and crossing his arms exceptionally.
“It won’t be long,” Steve called after him just as Mr. Johnson placed a photo of himself as a kid in a Captain America costume on the desk.
Steve growled loudly. Taking the Omega’s wrists into his right hand and slamming his arms against the door, above Tony’s head, he snarled in his face.
“What are you talking about?” the Alpha answered with furrowed eyebrows and confusion written all over his face.
“Would Uncle Thor have ended up team leader if he’d beaten Cap?”, Peter asked with curious eyes while cutting his syrup loaded pancakes into pieces.
And then silence as they sat in front of each other, none being able to seek eye contact in the first minutes. Only saved by a waitress who gave them their menus with a kind smile and took their orders for drinks before vanishing again.
“You know I could help”, the Alpha informed the Omega for fourth time as he sat at the counter reading a newspaper, like the old fashioned fella he was.
Well, guess it’s gonna be another all nighter, he thought bitterly. He, truly, just wanted to spend time with both men, this sucked.
At the same time his youngest pup slowly uncurled himself from the makeshift human ball still pretty shaken from the extreme scents and pheromones, now meekly watching his mother with curiosity. Another omegan whine was close to being released from his mouth out of pure intake of the disappointed scent emitting from the older Omega. At least the Alpha growling stopped, his brain delivered.
At least Tony didn’t run off this time, the Alpha gleefully took in. It was an improvement from the last time they spend the night together, when Steve got stirred awake by his instincts howling at him and the stabbing pain in his chest making him feel the absence of his heat mate.
“Since it’s a weekday, Sir, both of the young Sirs are currently at school.”
Natasha let go of the Omega and smiled faintly at the words. “How was the tower while I was gone?”
The answer was simple. Spite.
With that they were off on the way to school, trying to maneuver through the horrible morning traffic of New York.
But Tony was never able to give his pups something simple as that.
A collar.
The Omega smiled lightly at the Alpha’s insistence to take care of something as mundane as breakfast. Well, maybe it was just his post orgasm friendliness. Tony wasn’t one to complain however, Steve was a pretty great cook and his breakfast was kind of infamous around the tower.
A growl reached his ears and as he looked up at the Alpha a strong dominating scent reached his nose, accompanied by a lustful gaze. “Fuck, Tony, you look so good, so damn good. Like you’re my Omega, like you belong to me and me alone.”
The teen breathed out heavily and looked widely at the screen, shoving in his face that he lost this round of Mario Kart, what a bummer he thought annoyed.
, every adult in the room asked themselves.
When they reached the floor of the common room Pepper wasted no more time and swiftly excited the elevator while taking hold of Harley’s arms in the process, forcing out a fed up “Hey” from the boy. Tony only was able to catch another glimpse of Harley’s hair as they already vanished behind a corner, obviously following loud noises coming from the living room.
“But-”, the Alpha tried but got cut off by the engine starting and Happy throwing him a meaningful look through the mirror.
“You wanna tell me about your date with Steve yourself or do we still have to keep on doing this time stretching small talk until I finally got it out of you?” Natasha looked at him exceptionally sitting on the table next to his worksheets and crossing one leg over the other smoothly.
“Harley”, he started with a now noticeably calmer voice. “I’m aware your instincts must be riled up at the moments but nonetheless this is no way to behave in front of a superior Alpha and most importantly your own family”, Tony explained carefully, staring at his son intensely.
Tony was at a loss for words and drooling at the sight in front of him. Sex with Steve Rogers? He was actually offering to sleep with Tony?
Yeah, Tony didn’t know. His reaction to the blond Alpha since they’ve had sex was apparently ten times worse.
“Please tell me you kicked some serious butts on the mission,” he teased lightly, looking at Nat’s face glad to have her back again. It was a usual occurrence that members of the Avengers were called on for a solo mission, but the Omega always missed the female Alpha the most, well and sure Steve as well.
Before Tony could say anything else the Alpha beside him tugged at his sleeve. “Tony time’s almost up. You better leave now or else you’ll be late and even though I’m aware you’re used to being late, this isn’t an appointment you should miss”, Pepper said with another tug as she glanced at her shiny watch one more time.
Sighing exhausted, still struggling to pull at least one arm free he called out for his AI. “Jarvis, wake Steve, now!”.
Peeking through his shaking finger the boy suddenly saw the young Alpha on the ground, holding his shoulder with a painful expression while the other guys ran away with panicked screams.
But, well, it took them another hour of chattering child, now stuck to Tony’s shirt, until the boy actually quieted down. And like a switch was flipped over the boy stopped talking all together, his eyes getting drowsy, grip loosening from Tony’s shirt and yawning loudly.
With a hunger the blond was making out with the shorter, moaning male. Grunts being the only sound in the dark room as spit was being shared between two heated mouths. Steve’s tongue pressed against Tony’s in the most intoxicating way, the warm feeling stirring the Alpha’s hard cock in his pants.
He hurried after the other man after locking the car and came to a stop beside Tony, waiting on the elevator to arrive.
A smile that made Tony’s head swoon.
“Uh thank you, Alpha,” Tony breathed out, eyes transfixed by the the boy. With careful hands he unwrapped the box and what he saw made his heart stop for a second.
But Peter was different. Not because he was an Omega or shit like that, Tony clearly didn’t believe in such prejudices, but because he’s always been struggling more than his brother. He was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD when he was merely seven years old, so the older Omega was constantly keeping an eye on his pup.
Harley wasn’t normally this aggressive and easy to anger. What the hell triggered his pup like this.
The growls, snarls and pheromones were already hard for Tony to bear but for an Omega pup it was impossible, not having learned how to generate his own contributing instincts triggered by an Alpha yet.
“Thank you for telling me, Tony”, Steve started. “I understand why you’re so wary of dating anyone now. I just- my feelings they haven’t changed, I still feel the way I feel and I hope you understand that nothing could convince me you’re not fit to be with me.”
Steve chest rumbled at the affectionate gesture, angling his head up against the Omega’s tracing hand. “You’re so pretty Tony, no matter what. Especially when you sleep, so peaceful and just perfect”, the pheromone high Alpha mumbled into his neck, still cuming inside the genius.
Still, he couldn’t get lost like that. The Alpha was raised better than that.
The other man couldn’t stop his whines and purrs, the Alpha ramming into him just like he promised at the beginning. Another slap to his ass cheek, staining the milky white flesh with a harsh red and the Omega was hard again. His short cock pulsing painfully.
Quickly Steve pulled down the ruined pants, freeing the Omega’s cock and exposing his whole body to the Alpha’s hungry eyes.
Then he hastily pulled out another bouquet from his back, gentle pastel coloured flowers catching Tony’s eyes and making him raise an eyebrow.
It really was like Tony’s heat once again.
The whole moment was unspeakably enjoyable to Steve, who would have never thought he’d get to be a part of. And as he looked at the seemingly glowing kid with a smile of his own he was once again thrown off guard at how amazing Tony’s kids were.
Tony sighed behind the menu and pulled the sheet down a bit to cast a look at the blond in front of him, eyes narrowing at the question. “Since it’s 7pm and I haven’t eating anything this evening, I’d say I’m rather hungry.”
“Brave move, Rogers. Trying your luck again with the flower thing”, he commented with a hint of amusement.
Tony tried to not let it faze him though, he still wasn’t finished.
Steve smiled content, never getting tired of the bickering between his teammates, well, and Tony never disappointed in that department.
“Hey kiddo,” Tony said, walking over to Peter, combing his hand through his son’s hair. “How are you feeling?”
“I try.” Tony backed away a bit from the entrance, skating a bit around the entrance. “I can’t believe you forgot that you’ve never skated before.”
“I’M SORRY. Please just stop hurting me!”
Matt’s shoulders slumped at that, as he rubbed his eyes and groaned. “They’re in my room. It’s just been a really… long weekend. And they’re not in danger or anything, but just,” he didn’t really finish what he said, though both his parents were getting the idea that a minor concern for the twins was necessary.
“Yes. That’s what we talked about when all of this first started. Just sex. No feelings or anything like that. And last night definitely fell into the latter category.”
“You don’t need to mock me Steve, I’m right.”
Steve sat on the other end of the couch, trying to focus more on his coffee than on Tony. They sat in silence, neither really sure where to start.
Because Steve had not grown up with a lot of options in terms of food, cooking was never really Steve’s forte. However, a few nights ago he heard Tony mention how much he loved sushi, and Steve decided he was going to use this to his advantage. Steve was able to rope Sam, the tower's best cook, into helping him get all the ingredients and help with all of the prep.
,” Peter told him as Tony sat down next to him.
“Yeah, the media has absolutely been bothering you more than usual lately, but it probably doesn’t help that you’re also trying to be a parent as well as deal with them. I promise though, that after my meeting, we will figure out a game plan on what to do about them. Got it?”
“Well, now that we know it was just teenage stupidity, I think being grounded for two weeks from everything ought to be a good punishment.” He said with a goofy grin.
Steve knew pretty quickly that the feelings he had for Tony were ones he had never felt before. Sure, he had really liked Peggy, maybe even thought they could have had a life together, but the attraction that he felt for Tony was on another level. Not that he could tell Tony that, or anyone, for that matter.
“Fuck.”
Steve smiled wide. “I would love for you to show me that.”
“Wait, what? But we just had this huge heart to heart!” Peter protested.
There was no way of that being possible, but that didn't stop Steve from trying. It was late at night, late enough that everyone else was asleep, when Steve was sitting in the living room, thinking of how and when to ask Tony out. As he did so, he also sketched Tony, reminding himself of how much he loved Tony's soft brown eyes and adorable nose and chiseled jaw a-
Steve thought about it, and realized they were right. Steve didn’t really do much with Tony outside of team stuff, so how was he supposed to get Tony to think of him as more?
“Really,” Natasha said, raising an eyebrow. “You’re going to try and lie, to me, about your feelings?”
“I’m not mad at you at all, just trying to get you to understand. And I was an adult when I made those poor decisions because I didn’t have anyone who loved me the way your papa and I do, who made me do things I don’t always want to in order to take care of myself when I was your age.” Tony said, rubbing her back as he talked. She still wouldn’t look at him, but she hadn’t moved away from the touch either.
“Hey babe, I think we missed a present,” Steve said, stepping away from the tree to try and make sure Tony was the closer one.
“You’re really not that subtle about liking Tony, Steve, and that’s coming from me.” Bruce pointed out, sitting down on the chair across from him while Natasha sat next to Steve on the couch.
“Tony, I love you too. I promise I want this over just as badly as you do, but I need you to breathe.” As he said this, Steve started to do the breathing that he wanted Tony to do, hoping that the man under him would follow suit. For a minute, Tony continued to sob and beg, still hyperventilating and shaking, which was starting to worry Steve, but soon, Tony started to follow suit on the breathing.
“I know I haven’t known him long, but we connected really fast. I don’t really know a lot of people who are military and don’t automatically think of me as Captain America.” Tony moved to interject, but Steve stopped him. “That wasn’t a dig at you. I know you don’t think of me as Captain America first, but having other people like that is nice as well.”
“You promise you’ll help me study after?” Tony smiled at that and nodded.
“Meeting with Evans. Got some last little details to go over before he sells us his company. Shouldn’t be more than a few hours,” Tony reassures him, but Steve was not having it.
"Please don't tell me you need something. I'm sorry if that sounds rude, but I have had a long enough day and I still have things I need to finish."
“It’s okay to take breaks. They’re good for studying in the long run because you can take in more information.”
“Not enough,” Isabel mumbled, having pulled the pen out of her mouth to write a note in the book, before returning to her original position.
How he had ended up in Steve’s bed. Again.
“Moved past what? The just sex?”
Steve’s words seemed to fall on deaf ears, as Tony was now fighting to break loose of Steve’s grip, so Steve let go, letting Tony curl into a hyperventilating, shaking ball. Steve ran his hand up and down Tony’s back, giving him encouraging words when JARVIS spoke up.
“See! You already know the basics. I told you it would be fine.” Tony pulled Steve into him again, wrapping him in a hug with a peck on the lips.
“Papa I really need to learn this. I’ve been really trying hard but it’s just not sinking in and I really need it too. You know how hard it is for me to get through the reading material, and I just want to do well on the test,” Isabel explained, looking like she was about to fall apart. Tony himself could see straight through it, which was probably why it wasn’t directed at him, but rather Steve, who now looked like he was about to break, which Tony couldn’t let happen. Tony walked up to his husband, making sure Steve’s eyes were on him, and whispered to his husband.
“See, that’s seven against one.”
“That’s why there are six pairs, and one that would only fit her.” May laughed and thanked him when he handed her the skates. With that, the three adults helped the kids get their skates on.
They had been watching a movie in the communal living room when it happened. It was just the two of them left in the tower. Tony was lounging on the couch, while Steve sat in an armchair situated close to said couch. Tony was fine; he really was as far as Steve could tell. He had one panic attack in the morning, and it was already mid-afternoon and another one was nowhere to be seen.
“I’m glad, bear. Now let's go see what Steve made for lunch, and I’m sure the boys have a movie picked out already.” At that, they left the room, heading towards the living room with everyone else. Steve was just setting up some sandwiches, fruit, and popcorn on the coffee table when Tony and Isabel came in.
“Baby it’s okay if you are, we just want to help you so you don’t feel like that anymore,” Tony said, rubbing Peter’s shoulder, tears dangerously close to falling.
“You guys were always so touchy and laughing with each other. You barely know him.”
“Be my valentine?” Steve asked, making Tony laugh.
The one good thing was that they seemed to be happening less frequently as the week went on, at least according to Bruce. Instead of 9 or 10 a day, it had gone down to only 3 or 4, which was still a lot, but an improvement. The problem though, was that they were starting to take a heavy toll on his body. They weren’t completely sure if the panic attacks were happening less frequently because the serum was actually starting to wear off, or because Tony’s body physically couldn’t handle them anymore, and he was just always too exhausted to have his heart rate up that fast.
Matt, being the energizer bunny that he is, skated off right away, with Isabel attempting to chase after him, both in fits of giggles. Peter was holding May’s hand, skating much slower and taking his time to get use to the ice, but still obviously enjoying himself nonetheless. They were still a little a head of Steve and Tony, who were skating a bit behind them, taking in the view of their children having fun.
“He’s never going to see you as more if you do nothing except stare at him all the time. You have to put yourself out there so he notices you as more than just a teammate.”
“I need to finish this.”
“Of course.” Steve took the ring out of the box and placed it on Tony’s finger, who already had his finger out. Tony looked at the ring for a moment, still smiling.
“I know Tony. It was a rough couple of months. But they’re all better, or at least enough that we can leave them with the team for a few days so that we can have the break so we can focus on just us.” Tony knew his husband was right. From Peter becoming Spider-man, Matt getting diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and Isabel and Tony’s major fight, not even including other things such as Avengers stuff, to say the year had been a stressful one was just the type of the iceberg. But things had calmed down for a few weeks, so the rest of the team, Pepper, and even the kids had pushed for them to have a weekend to themselves. It was nice while they were there, but they weren’t allowed to contact anyone from home, Rhodey promising to call if there was any sort of emergency, so Tony’s nerves came back like a whirlwind the moment they entered the tower.
Steve and Tony both looked to the kitchen to see Natasha still recording them on her phone.
“Yeah, that sounds about right,” Tony said, guiding his son to sit down at the table, “Why don’t you eat some breakfast.”
They continued to talk, brainstorming things that Steve could do, before everyone turned in for the night, but at least a plan was set in place. Steve always worked better with a plan.
“I don’t think that’s possible,” Steve said as Tony started to head out, earning him a laugh from everyone, and slap on the ass from Tony.
“Please no! Get off me! Leave me alone!” Tony thrashed, trying to get Steve off and away from him by any means necessary. Steve pinned Tony’s wrists to the armrest and used Tony kicking as an opportunity to pin them down as well with his body. He now had Tony pinned down, horizontal on the couch. Steve was sitting on his hips, using his calves and feet to pin Tony’s thighs down, and his wrists pinned right above his head. In another situation, Steve would have been happy to be in this position, but with Tony still flailing and begging Steve not to touch the arc reactor, he was wishing he were anywhere else.
“We’re not asking you to stop studying and go into the test as is. You guys just need a break. Breaks are good so that you don't overload yourself. And besides, you both probably know most of the material later. A few hours aren’t going to kill you.” After a moment of consideration, Peter finally relented.
“I don’t know what you guys are talking about.”
Of course, there were also the normal rumors that the couple’s relationship was falling apart; they were just, more intense than the normal ones. Again, most of them were about Tony cheating and having a bastard child, but then there were different versions of that one. It was a one night stand after Steve had been paying to much attention to the Avengers, or it had been a long-term side relationship that backfired, or even that he had been sleeping around constantly, with men and women, and one night just had a miss-step. Some had nothing to do with Tony cheating, but Peter being adopted as an attempt the save the marriage because of other problems. It was a lot.
“Are you sure? Maybe she could study for a bit more?” Tony shook his head.
“He’s straight as an arrow and has his eyes set on someone else. I promise you, he hasn’t been flirting.”
The only thing about the future that was better than the food, Steve thought, was Tony Stark. Tony Stark, whose eyes always shone so bright that it rivaled the arc reactor in his chest. Tony Stark, whose brain was almost universally unrivaled. Tony Stark, who had the biggest heart of anyone Steve had ever met and could bring a smile to anyone's face. Tony Stark, who barely seemed to acknowledge Steve’s existence.
Eventually Tony and Steve were the last two out in the living room though, cleaning up from the presents. Steve watched to make sure Tony had his back turned away from him and the tree so Steve could slip one last thing under it.
“I can’t. Please just breathe with me please, it’ll be over so-“
Steve realized his mistake when Tony brought up sparring. He didn't mean it as a team thing, he meant it as a way to spend time with Tony and show-off.
“Wait, what?” In
Of course Tony had noticed that Steve’s behavior started to change. He noticed the snide comments Steve would make to try and keep Tony from going to business meetings. He noticed the way he was always physically close to Tony when any other people were around. He noticed that Steve didn’t like leaving Peter alone with other people unless he knew Tony was going to stay with Peter, even people like the team and Pepper, who were practically family.
Then, the rumors started to fly. Since the media found out about Peter before Steve and Tony made any type of announcement about it, there were a lot of suspicions about how Peter came to be. The most common one was that Tony had had an affair and that Peter was the resulting consequences of his actions. Another popular one was that the boy’s family had been killed by the Avengers, and the superheroes felt guilty about it and took him in. They had heard everything from kidnapping to secret SHIELD experiment to alien baby. The last one was Tony’s personal favorite.
They were originally going to talk to Pepper or Rhodey to come by and help, but Tony had vetoed those pretty hard, saying Pepper would just make him think of the company, which would stress him out, and Rhodey was across seas, and Tony didn’t want him bothered. So Nat just started to hang around Bruce and Tony a lot during this period, just to make sure Bruce doesn’t get stressed by Tony, and that Tony takes care of himself.
“What can I do then to stop that from happening?”
“Sweetheart, you need to take a break from the studying.”
ice skated before, it was just pre-serum. And I must have blocked out how badly it always went until I put on the skates.”
“Do you know how to curl ribbons for the presents?”
He didn’t want to admit it, and he sure as hell didn’t want to have this conversation, but Tony knew Steve was right.
“Got a bit too caught up in the sex part I guess,” Tony said, which made Steve start to laugh. At first Tony didn’t mind, but he started to get a little offended when Steve kept going.
“Umm… babe?” Tony asked, confused as to what his husband was doing, “Everything good?”
Steve had convinced everyone in the tower to "coincidentally" be out the one night Steve decided to cook, so that he would be able to spend some time alone with Tony. Once Sam left, and he checked that everything was set, Steve went on the hunt to go and find Tony. As Steve expected, Tony was in his lab, but it didn't take long for Steve to realize that he was on the phone - and it didn’t sound like a very pleasant conversation.
"What if he says no?"
"Well, I think I would say check yes to that," Tony said, giving Steve a peck on the cheek.
There was a park bench facing a large frozen pond, with a table set in front of it. There was a small canopy over the bench and table, along with a patio heater on either end of the bench, keeping the snow away from where they will be, without taking away the magic of having it around. When Steve moved closer to the table, he saw two places set on the bench, for the couple to sit next to each other instead of across, with a candle lit and food set out for the both of them. A large bouquet of roses was the final touch to the table, as well as other flowers on the edges of the bench that wasn’t covered by the canopy. There was some light music playing from some speakers that Steve wasn’t sure of where it was coming from, but he didn’t question is either. As he was looking at the beautiful setup, he felt a set of arms wrap around his waist and a kiss that was set on his back.
Was he never going to get the chance to be with the man he loved because he had to traumatize him in order to keep him from dying?
“Bella bear, I need you to look at me,” Tony said softly, putting a hand on her back to try and get her attention.
“I mean, Uncle Rhodey made us have dinner together every night, but other than that, pretty much. I saw Peter nap a few times, but I’m pretty sure Isabel’s blood content is just caffeine at this point. I’ve been trying to get them to take breaks, but you know how they are when they study together.” Matt explained, looking more and more drained as he talked, and Tony felt for him, pulling him into a hug.
“Everything is set up as you asked Mr. Stark. Would you like me to take you to where you are eating or are you okay with taking yourself back?” Before Steve could ask what she had meant by that, Tony was already pulling him away, saying that they’re good, and taking him back outside.
Steve and Tony both sighed, unsure of the answer they just received. It didn’t go unnoticed by Peter though.
Ten minutes later, Steve was bringing two cups of coffee from the kitchen to the living room couch. Tony was curled up in one of the corners, trying his best to be consumed by the couch.
“Six months of no conversations about anything more and us still doing our own thing.”
“That doesn’t really narrow it down. Maybe like why you made me layer up so much?”
Which actually wasn’t true, Tony knew exactly it had happened. Being friends with benefits made it kind of hard to not end up in bed with Steve.
“That’s still half”
“Daddy!” Steve turned quickly to see all three of his kids racing towards them, May trailing behind, smiling as well.
“Thank you,” Tony responded, “It was my idea, now where is Bruce?”
Technology was, of course, one of the pros. Being able to connect with others and have all the information in the world at his fingertips was something he never could have even dreamed of. Civil rights were better now, even if that topic could be questionable at times. The diversity in food was easily one of his favorite things about the future, being that he now had access to foods he never used to, or even would have thought of from before he was frozen, like indian food, peruvian food, and ethopian food - there were so many kinds of new foods to discover.
He’d hated himself for it, before. He figured he still did. But he was shameless, he guessed, in a way that Steve never felt he could be. After all, how fucked up could Tony Stark get? How sinful? How dirty?
Tony tore his eyes away from Steve as he continued to apply his foundation, pulling it down his neck, then, and painting himself into reality.
“I mean, he’s an arms dealer,” Tony interjected. “Of course he is.”
Right?
Steve felt the weight on the bed shift as Tony sat up, and he propped himself up on an elbow to more easily meet Tony’s eyes.
“And here I was thinking it couldn’t get worse. What’s him being a twink got to do with it? You know, back in my day—”
Something tightened in Tony’s chest— for a brief moment, he felt more longing than he had in some time. It was no longer the

of Steve’s head falling back against the headboard, and he couldn’t quite keep himself from smiling as he pulled back. “Who am I to deny you something you’d like so much?”
rubbers, all squished together in a funny sort of way.
He looks around himself, now, at the too-neat walls of the penthouse and the cute, comfortable decor he and Steve picked out together. He looks at the home he doesn’t deserve, the home that could be piled ceiling-high with the bodies of those he’s failed— friends, lovers,
, and for a short while, there was an air of disappointment that settled in the room.
Goliath gave the Black Knight a
“It’s functionally a cyanide pill, Tony. It’s nothing more than that.”
“Yes, we will,” Iron Man agreed. “It’s a date.”
Steve didn’t feel the need to comment on those strange little things, either. Especially not then.
“Be back in a sec,” he mumbled, finally standing and heading to the kitchen  to nab Tony’s drink. He filled the cup directly from the sink, quick and easy; the cup itself was plastic, thick enough to be a little on the weightier side when empty and sturdy enough that it wouldn’t break if dropped.
genius best friends rather than one. “Everyone knows, huh? Why, Iron Man, I wouldn’t have come up with that in a million years.”
“I’m going to get you back at some point,” he said, tossing a piece of popcorn into the air near Steve. Steve, knowing well enough by then what Tony was angling for, snapped his head forward to catch the popcorn in his mouth.
“They’re probably in the crowd. Loose shirts, guns tucked into the waistbands… You know. I’d just keep an eye on anyone as big as you. We won’t have to worry about it if we’re careful.”
That wasn’t the case here. He’d been half hoping the guy was decent to lovers (prospective lovers, anyway), as he’d known a handful of… villainous people who were. Decent enough, at least. But this
“I’m trying to put him in something flattering.”

He'd grown to understand that he wasn't sick- not the same way Joseph was, at least, and not the same way some of the other men were (who'd only joined the military because they liked the idea of bloodshed, no matter whose blood it was). Destiny was. The world was, to some degree. The redeeming quality had and always would be individuals themselves, kindhearted and welcoming. They were the kind you hoped to come home to, the ones Steve knew waved flags for the victors they were fortunate enough to be unable to empathize with. People redeemed the world- the people who knew what being people meant- and the more Steve sat with that, the more alright he was with himself, going off and beating the hell out of the people who didn't.
Plenty of people were drinking. Tony used to, at these parties- he still did at times, but he seemed less inclined to do so the more crowded the mansion got- and it worried Steve how little it took for Tony to become totally and shockingly soused. It wasn’t quite Steve’s preference, but he was willing to have a glass of champagne to nurse slowly as he made his way from group to group, checking in on loved ones and greeting old friends. His sips were small and reluctant, but if nothing else, it was something to do with his hands.
He'd come to a different conclusion. It was worth it when those you were fighting against were the same people you needed to fight for good. It was worth it when you stopped being a unified force for the sake of the dream, and you started being a tank with a U-shaped gun. It was worth it when sacrifices could be made- not people, not ideologies, but sacrifices of comfort in one's simplistic view of the world- for the better of that world.

“You don’t have to talk like that.”
“You think they’ll destroy the weapon?” Nat leaned forward, resting her folded forearms atop the table. “They can make a new one easily, but if we have it, we can learn how to counter it.”
They stand together. Steve pauses, keeps an eye on Tony. He doesn’t seem entirely ready to walk away.
When his eyes landed on Tony, he approached. He always did. Tony was an alluring man, and even if he hadn’t been, Steve could still think of no one better to seek out for a break from the crowd.
“Is that another joke?” Tony asked.
“Move a sec,” he said. “You’re makin’ the whole bed dip.”
sleeping with a man— and that dressing as Santa would be fine if not for the copious amounts of blush used to achieve that rosy cheeks look.
“Yeah?”
The architecture of the mansion was distinctly familiar. It was something Steve thought might have been built in his childhood. Wrought iron wrapped around the staircase lovingly, the windows gorgeously arched. There were areas that seemed as if they were intended to be minimalistic in a traditional sense, but Tony wasn’t one to leave much space on the walls. They were covered in photos, in portraits and paintings.
Part of him misses being a child in these moments. Part of him misses having his nose stuck in a book in the courtyard, the sun bearing down on his too-dark uniform. He misses being a third of his mother’s size, hiding behind her legs when the world was too much for him. He misses being so young and so stupid that he could delude himself into thinking atonement was open to him— being some poor, sad fucking 7-or-8-or-9-or-10 year old doomed by rot in his veins and the nature to share it all. He can’t remember how long it’s been since he’s been more good than bad. Maybe he never was.
“You’re awful. Despicable, truly.” Tony resituated himself, reaching for the bowl of popcorn again and shoving a handful into his mouth. His words were muffled as he spoke through his chewing once again: “I don’t even want to watch with you anymore.”
It was dark out by then. The shadows wrapped around him, bled into the black of his suit, kept him in one piece as he walked along. Outside, it was quiet. People kept their heads down, for the most part— truly, Paris had never been so tired. It was as if the whole of the city had been battery powered all this time, and someone finally ran the charge down.
Not that anyone knew. Not that anyone
And then Tony turned away, reaching behind himself with some effort to prop himself up with a pillow. Steve took hold of its corner, tugging it into what looked like a more comfortable position, and gave Tony’s arm a gentle
“I did not.”
Steve had asked him once, earlier on in their friendship.
“Thanks,” he replied, willing ease into his voice.
“Who knows?” Jan lightly bumped her elbow against Steve’s waist. “Maybe you’ll like it.”
“A trick,” Kang coughed out weakly, and Steve had half the mind to boot him in the cheek for his crimes. “It was all a trick.”
Iron Man turned to look at him, his helmet tilted down. “The Time Machine, Cap? Where they have a time machine?”
He can’t argue. He can’t push Steve away right now, not so close to— and he can’t blow Jan off. Can’t leave Bucky with that stupid broken pinky of his. He can’t do it.
“Yeah,” Steve agreed, a little too quickly. “Yeah, I thought— well, I thought the same.”
“Oh, I’m not. But Jan texted me before this and said if I didn’t get a picture, she’d die.”
who drew or sang or did drag in their mother’s walk-in closets. He didn’t care who wrote poetry under the bleachers at school or who hid panties in their dressers.
Tony took the bagel that was handed to him, staring down at it almost like he’d never seen one before. He just wasn’t quite with the program yet, didn’t know how to handle the— well, the fuck-buddy-turned-breakfast-partner ordeal.
Had he stayed awake for just a few more moments, he might have had the thought:
It kept him sane. There wasn’t much else around that could.
“Nooo. No, do not do that to me while I’m sucking your dick.”
“Oh.”
It was an easy sentiment to adopt, and one that could have saved him quite a bit of grief throughout his life; it allowed for simplicity with objective antagonists to the more broad global view of the dream he'd been defending all his life (freedom, that was, in its purest and most thriving form), and it allowed for complexity in how he'd handle his allies.
Tony made no effort to speak to them. He chose a seat at the far end of the bar, his face turned away from the rest of the patrons. He ordered one drink. He waited for that friend of his to show up.
He tried everything. He tried everything he could. He wanted to be okay. He wanted to be sane.
“Mind if I buy you a drink? Anything on the menu’s free game, handsome.”
“No one’s deluded themselves into— Jesus, Tony,” Steve says, and Tony’s not sure whether he’s disappointed or just a victim of Tony’s ever-reaching projection.
“I will,” he promised again.
“Ah, hell.” Steve slipped a hand into his pocket, procuring the small device and placing it into her open palm.
He heard
Steve didn’t love that insight, not because it wasn’t helpful, but because he’d had a bare bones understanding of the kind of shit Tony had been put through over his lifetime. He had to stamp down the part of him that, however briefly, compared himself to people like Sunset Bain. This was different.
. Sam looked pissed, the type that means 'I'm gonna fuck a bitch up' face.
Repeating the information, Tony finally snapped he immediately rushed to his car with the others trailing behind him shouting that they were coming too.
Bucky was kicking himself, regret was his only companion at the moment. What a dick he was to Steve and he might not even get to see him again let alone apologize for everything.
And he couldn't believe how selfish he had been. Steve had been so worked up with his relationship drama that he'd forgot to ask how Bucky was.
Making it into the hospital car park, and out the car. If the trio held onto the car for dear life while Tony was driving, nothing is to be said.
"He's crashing".  "No Heartbeat" "internal bleeding". " get him to surgery NOW".
and the look on everyone's face. Nat has a straight face, the look of no emotion which scared him the most
Tony and the trio walked to the door of the room where the nurses rushed to.
The doctor came over and began to explain what she new about the accident. Tony felt so much pain when she said that according to a witness Steve was walking across the road while a car came speeding down sending Steve flying.
Just as Bucky was about to phone Peggy, Tony's phone rang, with Steve's name appearing across the screen. Everyone felt at ease. They knew that Steve was alright he probably just needed some alone time.
Perhaps if he went for a walk he would be able to keep his mind off of it all. Only then did he realise it had been raining, he was completely soaked and haven't even noticed.
Banging on the door he began shouting for Steve, he needed Steve to be there, to talk things over. He needed to remind Steve how much he loved him. There was so much to he needed to tell Steve but he didn't know what to say.
As they were eating though, even with the heat lamps, Steve noticed that Tony seemed to be shivering a bit. He was pulled in tight to Steve, but that still didn’t take away from how much Tony was trying to stay as curled up as possible. Steve rolled his eyes, knowing his husbands was probably freezing and just not saying anything. Without a word, Steve put his fork down and started to undo his scarf a bit. He moved it to Tony’s neck, but as he started to wrap it around Tony, the scarf fell off of Steve’s neck as well. He tried for another moment, to get the scarf to stay on both of them at the same time, but to no avail.
They were plotting against him, he was sure.
Turning around again, shaking off Natasha’s hand in the process, Tony came face to face with Steve again, who was casually leaning against the door frame, arms crossed observing the scene peacefully.
Though, then suddenly a scent reached his nose and simultaneously making his insides warm up, a content feeling washed over him and forced a small purr out of his mouth, startling him in the process lightly.
Though, he knew he had a ton of work just waiting on him down in his lab, calls to make, people to see and probably, definitely according to the sounds of his rumbling stomach, breakfast to make. Besides, a shower wouldn’t hurt the man concluded, scenting himself as a sigh left his mouth.
The Omega saw red.
God, was the Alpha for real? Was he being serious? Tony wasn’t sure of anything at the moment.
“Oh but I do”, Steve clarified. “Please accept this gift, Omega”, he tried once more, empathizing the Omega title this time, trying to convince the man’s stubborn nature. Couldn’t Tony see how he felt?
“Without the Omega you’ve been calling all those vile words, you wouldn’t even be alive right now, do you understand boy? Tony Stark flew a nuke into space to safe everyone, even your sorry ass of an Alpha,” Steve growled and squatted down beside the trembling boy.
Even his pups. Oh shit.
“He didn’t care I already had a pup, even liked Harley a lot and when we started dating became a proper Alpha figure for Harley to look up to, something I never could be. Though, when time went on his expectations of me changed. He demanded me to stay home, kept insisting Pepper was better at handling Stark Industries by herself and that I should be true to my Omega nature”, the bitter taste in Tony’s mouth now returned and his scent spiked with silent rage.
A fucking lego brick. Tony was too old for this.
“No but seriously”, the blond pup started once again, ignoring the piercing look of his mother and rather concentrating on the serious face of Captain America, who had his mouth set into a firm line. “Just looking at the statistics, from a logical point of view, it would be fairly easy for Uncle Thor to beat Steve. He is a god and last time I checked god beats super soldiers by far.”
Still, he couldn’t stay up there.
Noticing the Alpha’s stare the archer gulped down the bite quickly and grinned at the man, who stood wordlessly across the room.
Maybe he should have stayed home he kept thinking as he slid down the wall with his knees pulled up and face now resting on his crossed arms. He let out a sigh and just wished for Steve to finally free himself from Mr. Johnson’s clutches so the day could be over sooner than later.
Tony’s mind needed a few seconds more to process another forthcoming act like that
Tony couldn’t stop thinking about it. His own cock was now rock hard, precum slowly forming at the tip and staining his loose underwear from the night before. How the hell was he always reacting so strongly, what was it about Steve Rogers that made his mind stall completely, as if his brain could only revert to its basic instincts.
The boy in question didn’t seem to hear the man and continued to try sipping his coffee. Tried being the keyword, as he kept burning his mouth, gasping loudly and then repeating the process.
Feeling the sweat forming out of pure stress he laughed forcefully and tapped his fingers on the wooden table as if to distract himself. “So...food”, he started anew.
Steve chuckled at the cheeky and rude answer but complied anyway, not having the patience to wait any longer himself and swiftly lined up, slick pouring out of the Omega’s hole and coating his cock hotly. Without another thought the Alpha shoved right into the wet, tight heat and snarled loudly at the feeling. Yes, this, this was missing last night. The ultimate act of and Alpha and Omega coming together.
A few minutes passed with none of the men saying anything. Though Steve’s arm was getting heavy and Tony was starting to sweat from nervousness.
Clearly seeing an Alpha wasn’t good for his career.
Without thinking about the ever cryptic ways of one of his best friends, Steve disappeared into the hallway following the genius down, to what he guessed he vanished to, his lab.
Tony could only blame himself.
How dare they insult his sweet and loving mom just like that. They didn’t know him, they didn’t know about his family, the knew jack shit. Yes, he was an Omega but if anything that his mother taught him was that he under any circumstances wasn’t useless or any of those stupid prejudices.
His eyes found his Dad’s and Peter beamed down at him, still chittering lowly to himself.
Seriously, damn his nest for being so comfortable and inviting.
New, strong hands, pulled at the webs as Tony came face to face with his lover. His saviour, he thought amused.
Tony smiled at the thoughtful AI and gripped Steve’s hand firmly, pulling him along out of the elevator. “Thanks J! Way to think ahead.”
“Mr. Rogers, sir. If you had the chance to go back in time, to the day you got frozen in the ice and live your life normally in the past, would you do it?”
Tony rolled his eyes with a small grin, sometimes he was very thankful for Clint’s talent of making a bad situation seem somewhat funny once again.
“Mom?”, the small voice of Peter barely reached Tony’s ears beside him, but the sudden grasp on his arm caught his attention quickly.
Yeah, he desperately needed to find them.
“You think Sam acts like a child?”, Steve asked with eyes trained on the weather forecast for the next days.
As he reached the foot of the bed, right in front of the grinning, tall Alpha who now firmly fisted his cock in his hands, he reached out with a whine. His Omega instincts went wild once again.
Even Harley, his young Alpha pup, seemed taken back by the sheer force of Alpha behavior in one room. Frozen to the ground the boy could only stare at the two man with big eyes, neck unwillingly bared by instincts, inner Alpha probably submitting in fear of having to participate as well.
“Alpha, tell me what you’re plotting with my pup.”
Not saying another word the man went over to the elevator and pressed the button, standing awkwardly in the living room still with the flowers, those damn flowers, in his hands. What a joke that idea was, he blamed himself, realizing he had to step up his courting game to achieve anything in the future with the Omega.
Something had to be up. Tony must have come to the same conclusion already and was probably running test after test up in the tower.
The smirk he got in returned really didn’t calm his mind.
“Then roughly one and half years later, now with me working at the company full time with the help of Pepper everything changed once again when I met Andrew during a business meeting with another company. We hit it off quite quickly and before I could think about it we went on dates and all those couply things.”
“Yeah just like that,” Tony moaned from beneath the Alpha.
But the way the teen handled the class reminded Steve of the times Tony stood in front of crowds and charming them with his words.
Harley, the young Alpha, still on the blink of reaching his true Alpha status, was growling fiercely at Steve. The actual act looked pretty cute Tony noted, his son pulling his lips in a mocking snarl and emitting a warning scent from his scent glands, signaling for the other Alpha to back off. A pup trying to protect its mother.
Apologies where now spilling out of his mouth, scent overwhelming the small Alpha and too afraid to do anything but submit to Steve with a tear streaked face.
And this time Steve did keep a close eye on the present, he swore.
Harley was slowly strolling behind his mother, avoiding the continuing worried glances the man threw at him.
And to Tony’s surprise a pleasant smell of bacon and scrambled eggs reached his nose making his stomach release another deep growl. Food.
Wordlessly Steve watched both Omegas leave through the entrance to the kitchen, awed and maybe, perhaps, a little scared of Peter’s similarity to Tony. Genius parent with genius kids, he chuckled to himself before following them with a slow pace.
“Oh shut up Harley, who’s still working on his P.G. 0035, huh?!”, Peter yelled fed up. “Ned’s and my idea is way better!”
“Tony, the living room. The team will be back soon. We gotta clean it up and you have to call Peter’s school again, since I don’t think he’ll be able to attend once again. Not after yesterday.”, the blond tiredly mumbled, stroking Tony’s back lovingly.
“You know it’s-”
Before the Alpha could even react to the striking words, open his mouth to ask Tony to elaborate, the Omega was already talking again.
Poor Steve doesn't have it easy
“You don’t have to try it Tony! I just thought I’d offer, you know how Alphas like to provide”, he tried to explain, hoping to receive some sort of smile, an assurance that everything was alright, though, what he got in return quickly shocked him.
Tony, sitting next to Harley and, to his amusement, Steve since Peter wanted to spend some time with his favourite assassin aunt Natasha and cuddled up to her side on one of the smaller couches. Leaving the older Omega beside the blond, which, yeah, was going to be interesting and, probably, pretty awkward.
Though, a few seconds later the moment was lost since his youngest son decided to burst into the hallway, with bacon still hanging half out of his mouth.
The growl that escaped Steve instinctively didn’t even faze the Omega a bit as he continued eating the baked good, Tony’s courting gift, with absolute delight.
The Omega was now looking over the menu once more, slowly losing his grip on the sheets and listening to the blond talk about the past. Something he Tony always enjoyed. The animated look in the man’s eyes, the contently tinted scent and the relaxed posture was a sight to behold, making Steve seemingly glow. A glow that people tried to diminish many times before and thankfully haven't succeeded yet.
“Mom!”, the young Omega whined, only half audible due to the unchewed food in his mouth. Swallowing the piece of meat in one go the boy smiled up at his Ma, reaching out a hand and clasping his fingers around the older Omega’s wrist. “The food’s nearly gone and you still haven’t eaten!”, Peter whined worriedly. “And besides Aunt Tasha wants to see you.” Pulling his startled father along, he cast a short glance to the tall Alpha standing in the hallway with them, eyes gleaming challenging.
“It wasn’t supposed too. It was just to make sure you knew I’m promising adult food and not mac and cheese or pizza. And it’s snowing! You should be layering up anyway.”
“No reason. Enjoy the rest of your night and I’ll see you guys tomorrow.”
“I actually really like the ballet as well.”
Once Steve saw that Tony was done talking, he knocked on the door of the lab, and walked in. Tony looked up to see Steve, and gave a small sigh.
