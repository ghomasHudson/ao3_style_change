“Captain,” she greeted, and Steve gave her a nod as he approached. “We’re glad you’re here.”
“Thanks,” Steve said, and his cheeks looked a little warm as he sipped from the steaming mug.
“Early close today. It’s Thursday.”
“Ah yes. Sam is usually good for sending wayward travellers my way. Bike huh? What kind?”
“Oh my god, no, the actual Captain America is in my room. With all my...decor.”
“Named for the first African american woman in space.” He gave the cat a scritch under the chin. “This gal’s an explorer, seemed fitting.”
“Oh,” Peter said, still clinging to the dog. “I had to ask.”
“Flatterer,” she told him with a smile, handing him a flute of pretty average champagne. “You look like you wish you were anywhere but here.”
“Are you ok? Your spoon?”
“You… made me a sexy joke calendar?” Tony asked very slowly and Steve looked like he was about to spontaneously combust.
“If you think that just because he’s your mate he can do what he wants, then you’ve got another thing coming! You don’t want to seem unfair, do you, Sheriff?”
“How do you want to handle it?” Bucky asked in his ear as they got on their bellies to stay out of sight.
“Diplomacy?! That man has been making indecent comments at me since he got here, and I have been as polite as I can. But I will not stand by and let him hurt Peter.”
“Mr Stark,” Mr Rogers says and looks at Tony intently. “Although it would of course be nice to see him, I think perhaps you are under a misapprehension. Bucky is my friend, perhaps brother may be more accurate as we grew up together as children. But I have only a familial affection for him, no more.”
Steve's gaze was hot as it met Tony’s. “Can’t wait.”
impressive,” Miss Foster corrected. “Using that kind of precision with just the ingredients nearby was genius. Tell me, what do you know about astronomy?”
“Well, I think I saw there was a cafe two floors up,” Steve said, and he led the way, Tony following dutifully.
She settled in to finish the rest of her pancakes. As she cleared the plate, a picture popped up of Sif in her new room.
“I’m glad to hear it. We don’t entertain as much as we used to, and I find from time to time that I miss it.” He gave Steve a look. “You really must come again.”
This was common for games, a last meal in case of a fatality the next day. There was plenty of food and wine, and there were instruments provided for music.
Tony nodded. “I keep her memory alive for him. So that he might know her, even if he is left with me as a poor substitute.”
“Oh that’s- Sam, that’s great,” Steve said, genuine joy filling him even as he worried the news might hurt Tony more, though he’d be so happy for their friends all the same. “You’ll make great parents.”
Tony grimaced. “I know, but -”
When the story was done, Tony gave both little satyrs a kiss on the head before he went outside to clean their bowls, leaving Stíofán to wrestle the kids into bed.
Maria finished smoothing a poster against the wall. “Not bad right? I’m just putting a couple of things up, no point doing everything when I might have to move.”
Steve looked fond. “Yeah, that’s definitely the adrenalin.”
“Yeah, well I hope you don’t mind, we showed the shelter I work at,”  Sam told him, sipping his own drink. “They were pretty excited. There are a few animals who struggle to adapt after an amputation and they’d love to talk to you about partnering up.”
Hammer made an affirmative sound. “The does? Sure did. I hear they’re the cast-off fauns from the Matchmaking Stable - didn’t make the grade but still fine enough to look at if the ones I caught sight of going into the
“You’re doing good, so good.”
“You’re Captain America?! Wait, how? The guy’s like six foot and ripped.”
“Shit.” He turned to leave and noticed one of the kittens sleeping on the stack near the window. “I’ll take this too, it’ll make good bait for the dogs.”
“Are you angry at Dadda?”
He saw red.
Tony nodded, relaxing into the mattress. “Of course. Goodnight, Steve.”
Tony shook his head. “No I can. I swear.”
“I don’t get it, did I offend you? I wasn’t trying to, I just figured you wouldn’t want to take part.”
“I’m always here to see you,” Steve grinned. “Just this time I’m also here to visit the All-Powerful Witch of the Machines.”
“Yeah, and it got me thinking, why didn’t you, uh, you know, make a move?”
“No!” The doe yowled pushing back, and Stíofán grunted, starting to fuck harder.
“Fine,” the doe groaned. He sat up, the blankets falling to show two dusky nipples, and Stíofán found his eyes drawn to them.
He was checking one of the shelves for baking powder when a group of omegas entered the store, chatting in hushed voices. Tony was tucked away from view, and they clearly hadn’t seen him, as it became pretty obvious what they were talking about.
“Mr Rogers!”
“Oh, ha, no it’s the first time we’ve hung out here. My buddy and I, that’s him there, actually, no ignore him, he’s a dork who still thinks finger guns are cool. We’re celebrating, thought we’d try this place since it’s got cheap beer.”
Their wedding was not exactly what Tony had dreamed of when he had been a young omega, still being fed the lie that he’d marry an alpha of his choosing.
“Sounds peaceful.”
Tony snorted, sounding a little shaky. “You going to call me a brave little soldier, sarge?”
Tony nodded, letting Steve tug him around the coffee dripping onto the floor. The glow was almost effervescent standing this close together.
Steve reached out to clasp it, linking his long fingers with Tony’s. “Lead the way.”
“You--”
That was not an acceptable outcome.
“Thanks. I’m sorry you were kidnapped.”
Tony wasn’t sure he wanted to fix it, but before he could say so, Sam nodded.
He felt a hand slip into his and he looked up to see Steve smiling at him. “Are you ready to see your new home, Mr Rogers?”
She looked at J.J who straightened, shoulders back and smiled. He made a
“I see them,” Tony said, unable to stop from smiling. He opened the gate for them to step through closing it tightly behind them. “Ok, now let’s--”
“Now that that’s taken care of,” the alpha said, nodding at the dancers who were just finishing up. “Maybe I could take you for a spin?”
A shadow fell over him, and his head shot up hopefully. Was it-?
He liked it too that Stíofán was uncovered, but Antonius was still wearing the shift, as if still pure even as Stíofán took that innocence from him. “I bet you imagined yourself some senator’s bride, hmmm? Laying on a couch, partying every evening, your every whim catered to. Instead, I’ll be between you legs, taking my pleasure, morning and night. My live-in whore.”
The doe was curled up on the palate, waiting patiently, his shift back in place. Stíofán a little twinge of arousal at the idea that he was back to looking so demure given what they had just done, but it was too early for anything further yet. Stíofán sat down beside him, handing him the bowl. “Here, I bet you’re hungry.”
Peter had complained about a headache, and the back of his throat was red and swollen. His temperature hadn’t abated either, which was the real red flag. Tony couldn’t just sit there and do nothing.
“I didn’t do nothing. It’s that damn horse of yours!” The man said to Wilson, looking angry. “She bucked me off.”
When he reached the courthouse, he discovered Hodge and his gang had been sentenced to thirty days in the county jail, and Bucky and Sam offered to escort them over. Tony found himself feeling relieved. It was only thirty days, but perhaps this would be enough to dissuade those criminals from returning.
The sheriff was very attractive. Tony had assumed as much with his clothes on, but now, seeing him bare, he was gorgeous. He had some scars, no doubt from fighting bandits and arresting criminals, but he had a strong muscled back and broad shoulders that curved down into a narrow waist. He looked powerful.
Jarvis placed a paw on his wrist. “It’s ok. We can get a new one. What’s important is it’s the broom not your leg.”
“You’ll see.”
He picked up a stick and lifted it up. “You mean old snake! You bit my Dad!” Then he moved towards it, clearly planning to scare it away.
So Tony did. He told Stíofán about growing up in Aquleina. He came from a wealthy, old family in the area, who had hoped to make a strong political marriage of Tony to one of the magistrates, but his condition had made itself known, word had spread quickly, and Tony’s parents had made a choice they thought would best help his future. He didn’t seem to blame them which was odd and Stíofán queried it.
S’Teve looked up, keeping his face blank. “Certainly.”
“Are you done?” Steve asked and Tony glared at him.
Tony snorted. “It’s killing you not to ask isn’t it? Fuck it, no reason you can’t know, not like the papers didn’t cover it well enough.” He continued petting Jemison for a moment, before saying, “my father and I didn’t get on.”
“You’re a fucking idiot,” Tony said for the umpteenth time, ignoring the way Steve kept rolling his eyes. “Three fractures! For a fucking plant!”
“I love you too.”
Hodge nodded to the henchman, who dropped the dog and grinned. The man came over, taking Tony by the arm and tying his wrists behind his back. He led him over to the horses, and before Tony could do anything, he found himself airborne.
J.J’s hand gripped hers behind their backs. “Yeah, Dad. They’re one of the best Med Schools, you know that.”
He felt his eyes burn with tears, and though he tried to hide, when his alpha pulled back with a flushed, roguish grin, it dropped from his face when he took in Tony’s expression. “Are you alright?”
Hugh looked a little chastened. “That was an accident. Peadar falled.”
It was tiring, though Stíofán was feeling the effect. He was getting stronger, faster, and quickly becoming the best fighter in the
It took Stíofán a second before he felt himself tense with shock. “You’re..?”
“Yeah, course we can.” He took Tony's hand, leading him away, and called to Sam on his way past. “You got this?”
“So, do you?”
It wasn’t until they reached the very end of the gallery, where the newer artists submitted pieces that Tony found something that really caught his attention.
It was simple: a far cry from the large house Tony had grown up in and those he had spent his life visiting. It included a small kitchen, though Tony could see care had been taken to store things in clever ways, a cosy little space for entertaining and staying warm by the fire, and a small table to dine at. There were some tasteful cushions and a nice throw, making it seem homely, which Tony liked.
He was up before everyone else each morning, hitting the yard and running through the motions for a good hour or two before a full day of practice combat.
They were dressed head to toe in black, combat uniforms with a strange symbol on the sleeve. Tony squinted at it.
The man stepped out and seeing the job was done, clapped his hands together. “That was fast! Now that you’re done, bring your bike into the yard where it will be safe and come on inside.”
Tony looked at the bike, along with Steve’s proud grin and the brown leather jacket he’d clearly bought for riding, parked in the backyard of the bakery. It was a pretty hot image he had to say.
Steve pushed open the door, his eyes taking in the scene quickly. Oh dear.
When he could wait no longer, he started to thrust, slow and steady, the warm fleece so soft beneath his hands, heightening the pleasure.
“About that,” Sam said, coming over from where he was icing some fresh pastries. He slid into the chair next to Rhodey. “You could stay with us.”
She got as far as reaching for her phone when there was a knock at the door.
“You don’t want to do that,” Steve said, voice dangerous.
He felt the raw panic swell in his chest like a bubble, pushing tight against his ribs. No, that wasn’t going to happen. Not to his child.
Steve grinned. “Hardly my fault that I’m forced to come and look after the townsfolk instead of staying in bed with you. Anyone would be grumpy about that.”
Looking at the two other alphas alongside him, Hodge visibly made a decision, and Tony’s heart was in his throat as the man released the omega and reached for the pistol on his hip. His arm came up, the gun readying to put a hole in Tony’s husband when suddenly Steve’s arm whipped into the basket, and there was a dark dust explosion, which sent Hodge into a flurry of coughs. The two omegas got clear, moving to a safe distance. Steve wrenched the pistol from his grip and pointed it at the now grubby trio who were still spluttering heavily.
“Come in.”
“Goodness no. No, we are not like that.” The man fidgeted with the blankets. “I had rather hoped that you-- no, nevermind, I am about to make a great fool of myself. Please, don’t pay any attention to me.”
“Can I?” Peter asked, his eyes even wider now he knew he could press his advantage. Anyone who thought kids were innocent had another thing coming, Tony thought. “Please?”
He was taken into the small back room of the saloon, the door pulled tightly behind them. Steve started to pull his belt from his waist, and Tony pressed himself against the wall, eyes squeezed shut, his face against the grain. It would hurt – Steve was big and strong – and he could feel himself starting to tremble.
“HODGE!” The alpha looked up at Steve’s shout, and his face twisted in an angry grimace.
“I’d never think of asking,” Steve said, looking like butter wouldn’t melt in his mouth. “But if we just so happen to have the ingredients to hand…”
“We are all up and ready and we’re going to be right on time. You want to talk to Riri?”
The faun’s mouth moved as if to speak, but before any sound could be heard, the doe’s eyes went glassy and he collapsed to the floor.
“I want that too,” Stíofán told him, his voice rough. “And gods willing I will be. But I had to be sure. You’ll be safe, I can go into the arena knowing that.”
S’Teve felt his ears heat up as he remembered. Tony had been in a bad state, his body small against S’Teve’s as they’d waited for rescue. Tony was right. It would’ve made more sense to leave and inform the Captain, but he’d been unable to face the idea of leaving Tony alone, vulnerable and likely to be captured. “We were unaware of how the Zenrans treated captured spies.”
Steve sighed. “Tony, I know what I look like, ok?”
Tony huffed. What was this guy’s problem? He opened his mouth to yell back, but he’d already climbed on his bike and was peddling off at high speed. Whatever. This is what Tony got for helping people.
“Woah, ok, sounds like a lot,” Rhodey said, expression soft with sympathy. “And a lot for an eighteen-year-old on his own for the first time.”
“That’s amazing Tony.”
Tony looked at him again and sighed. “I know what it is.”
Oh good god no. This could not be happening. This was easily the most mortifying experience of his life, and yet, Steve was staring at him with a hopeful expression and Tony found himself tongue tied.
“You need to calm down, these things happen! We can do without it.”
“Yip!” Oscar barked, and Tony’s heart melted.
Tony nodded, taking a shaky breath as he pushed to his feet and wiped tiny bits of plaster off his armor. “Right. Lead the way.”
“I’ve sent a letter, so he should know before I arrive. But any reply will come after I’m gone. Jarvis will intercept it so my parents don’t see, but I have to hope he’s happy to see me.”
“Why are they landing in our town?” Tony demanded, and Steve saw the moment that Fury clocked him in the cafe.
The Captain’s eyes widened as if in disbelief that he was being spoken to. “Hi.”
“Seems to me my omega reacted instinctively to protect our boy. I’m sure anyone can understand that.”
Tony appeared at his side, clutching his arm tight in worry. “Is he ok? Is he--”
Rhodey shot a glare at him. “No, he needs to--”
There was no answer, and Tony could hear his own heartbeat pounding in his ears as he began to dig. It took him longer than he was comfortable with to see the familiar red, white and blue underneath the rubble, his hands scratching frantically at the rest of the debris until -
“You’re close, bit more, come on,” Stíofán panted.
He felt the omega relax, arms curling around Steve’s back and pulling him tight. “He was going to hurt Oscar. I didn’t have a choice.”
“Gentlemen, there’s an omega present,” Steve cut in. That made the mud-covered man look over in interest.
Generally, Stíofán was happier too. He felt less alone with Tony sharing his room, always there to speak to and sleep alongside. And well, to say nothing of their nightly activities, which Stíofán took to with gusto, like a starving man to food.
Hodge looked thoughtful for a moment before he nodded at the puppy. One of his gang slid off his horse, picking Oscar up by the scruff of his neck. “Either you put that gun down, or this little guy meets his maker sooner than God intended.”
Then Tony gave him a smile and wandered back down to the workshop.
It was a simple system of disqualification, the winner went on to the next round until one remained.
“Was he?” He let his horns press a little harder. “I sure hope so.”
Tony’s face scrunched in disgust. “Hodge? What in god’s name does he have to do with it? I want my husband to make love to me. I don’t think that’s too much to ask.”
. You want keepsakes, we got ‘em. So pick what you like and uh, spend some money!”
“I guess I could. Won’t I be in your way though? Looks like you have a few projects going on.”
“Noooo,” the doe complained, rolling over and hiding his face. “Tired.”
“Holy shit! He came! You damn well did it!”
“Gods, I was so--” Stíofán moved just in time to catch Tony as he collapsed, his whole body stiffening. He held him tight while he waited until Tony shook it loose.
“Pancakes?” Steve’s stomach growled, and Tony snorted.
“What are you doing, you —-
“I said, can I help you?” The cat’s mouth didn’t move, and Steve didn’t know why he expected it to. But then, he’d seen crazier stuff during the war…
There was a loud rumble overhead, followed by a sharp crack that hurt Tony’s ears, and he looked up to see the edge of the Oscorp Tower, breaking off as smoke poured out the side. There were screams as large chunks of concrete and glass rained from the sky, and the people around him started to run, quickly turning the street into stampede.
“Right. Of course. You know what, I’ll just get them and put them in the extras bag.”
“They’re good climbers aren’t they?” Stíofán said, knowing he was preening and Tony rolled his eyes.
He turned to leave but Steve’s hand shot out and grabbed his sleeve. “Wait!”
She stepped back, flinging the bar outwards and feeling the pull as a spear head dropped forward, extending out.
The omega smiled, a mocking twist to his lips. “I was as shocked as anyone to see Mr Rogers remove his corset
“All done. You shouldn’t have any problems with it now, but if you do I can come back, tweak the spellwork.”
Steve read for a half-hour or so before he seemed to notice Tony was tiring. “Perhaps we ought to leave the rest for tomorrow evening.”
“I mean get a room already, no one needs to be blinded by your love light.”
“No.” Steve let out a breath, his cheeks a little red. “I mean, yes. But, it wasn’t for the plant, Tony. I couldn’t care less about that.”
Maybe-George huffed, tossing a few bills on the table. “Should’ve known. Everyone always says they don’t give a fuck but they always do. You can pretend all you like, but deep down you’re waiting aren’t you? Waiting to hear those magic words? It’s pathetic.”
And when they finally fell into bed at the end of the night, Tony was pulled back in a warm, solid embrace, and it was nearly perfect.
“I love you. I love our pup. I’ve got everything I need. Anything else is just the cherry on top. I don’t want you thinking that I’m not happy with what we have.”
“It is,” Tony smiled, pushing up his glasses as they slid down his nose. “I think maybe Dad even understood near the end. He left me his signed first edition of
He got a little lost in the kiss, truth be told, because it wasn’t until someone tapped him on the shoulder that he came up for air.
“Oh yeah, he’s a sweetheart. Even if he does ignore the rules.”
Tony rolled his eyes as he came up on the tank where more and more robots were stomping out onto the streets. There were so many that he was kind of wondering how exactly the villain of the week had stored them all in one single tank. It would probably be interesting to take it apart.
As Tony winced when the alpha stepped on his toe, the big blond blushed red as a tomato, muttering apologies.
Steve was...tired.
Tony tried to nod, to reassure his alpha, but instead he felt the tears trickle over and brought up his hand to wipe them away.
“I know, baby. You’re sick, but don’t you worry. When the sun comes up, Papa will be here, and he can go for the doctor to make you all better.”
“Ok, ok. No food.” Stíofán felt at a loss for what to do, but the doe’s shiver made the decision for him. He lay down behind him, pulling him close and wrapping an arm around his middle.
“Hey, hey,” Tony said, hand coming up to cup his jaw. “It’s ok.”
“But it could have been.”
J.J snorted. “I don’t know, you growl like one when someone wakes you up, it’s not far off the mark.”
Tony beamed, and Mr Murphy spluttered. “I get more and more eager to meet my dame-in-law every day.”
“Alpine’s doc, of course,” Sam shook Tony’s hand. “It’s like she’s got nine new lives, it’s amazing.”
Dad pulled the letter out, unfolding it with slightly shaking hands.
He was sweet, smart, funny - he liked to tease Tony, which never failed to leave them both laughing at the end - and he was talented. He could draw schematics like an expert, and he clearly had skills in design. The bike was a testament to that: Steve making modifications that had Tony impressed, planning them out in intricate detail. Tony had found him more than once brushing a hand over the bike’s frame, telling it how well it was going to do and how it was going to zoom down the streets so fast that Steve would feel like he was flying.
Tony sighed. “Is it?”
Steve gave a rattling cough. "Get the... tank..."
Maria didn’t need to hear the other side of the call to know her nana was giving him sass. “Let me talk to her.”
Tony listened to the now familiar sounds of his alpha moving about the house - locking up, settling Oscar in his basket, and making sure the stove was secure.
Their social media had gone wild, and he already had several new investors and a large number of orders.
Eventually the supervillain was defeated, Cap leaping onto the hoverboard and crashing it into the roof of Oscorp Tower, with Spiderman webbing the green villain and lowering him to ground level to be taken in by the police.
No one liked cold oats after all.
There were six hits in total, and they must have hurt, but the sheriff just grit his teeth until he was done. His arm had long slashes of red on it, dark enough Tony feared they’d bruise.
He looked up ahead at the lights and he did a double take as he spotted Steve Rogers on the opposite corner.
“Why?”
Stupid party planner. Who cared about the hotel’s aesthetic when the tower was already a work of art?
The rain soaked through his clothes in minutes, and not long after, visibility got bad. He could barely see the end of his broom, but he could see just a hint of lights and so steered towards it. He could feel Jarvis’ claws digging into his side as the cat shook from the damp.
“You better work or I’m donating you to a school janitor!” He told it as he rushed outside, mounting it quickly. He focused his breathing, letting the magic flow through him and into the metal insides of the broom. “Come on, you--”
The only things he got invited to were Stark Magics events or the houses of witch kids from other families, who invited him to try and get the free witchcraft supplies his father always sent with him. He didn’t think he’d ever been invited to a party just for the sake of it. It had always just been him and Jarvis.
“Just relax Steve,” he told him, letting the heat in his belly flow into his voice. “I’m going to rock your world.”
“Now don’t rush, and don’t just pick any town. Make sure it seems right,” she told him, fussing over his hair and his bag. “Make sure to find somewhere to stay as soon as you can and don’t let people swindle you! Many a naive witch has had their money stolen by a commoner on their journey, and--”
Stíofán looked down at the finely crafted shield on his arm, the blue and red paint stark against the sands. He’d never seen its like before, light and easy to carry but stronger than anything he’d ever seen.
“You want to photograph me with your Hydra-issued artistic skills?” Steve was aware his voice was getting a little shrill, but he couldn’t help it. “What the hell did they make you take pictures of?”
“I know you can. Now come on, where are your coats? We need to pick the best of the bunch.”
was dissolved when I went missing. She married someone else.”
“You don’t have any experience with metalwork!”
Tony flushed hotly. Whoops, that had been a bit more honest than he’d intended. “Oh I’m sorry - I didn’t mean it. I just got het up about everything.”
Maria rolled her eyes, picking up her things and starting to put them away.
It had travelled a distance now, moving higher and higher as it passed over the city. He moved in closer, and to his relief could still see Steve gripping the end tightly. He flew forward making a beeline for it.
Even now, when they were just a few hours away from ousting the gang, when he could be home by day’s end, he kept replaying it in his head.
Tony felt his stomach flip. His palms started to sweat and he subtly wiped them on the quilt.
- fuck, you know what? Drop the duster. Here.” He handed Steve the bottle of champagne. “Spill this over your tits.”
“It’s fine.”
Peter’s eyes were big. “I’m sorry. Do we have to? The doggy likes me.”
“You see? They won’t dare try again for a while. But I believe that moves my timetable up. You tell me how to access the plans and schematics for the latest Stark weapons now, or I’ll start shooting.” The look on his face told Tony the negotiation period was over.
Steve blushed. “You spoil me, Tony. You really do.”
There was a knock at the door, and Steve peeked out of his blanket warily. “Yes?”
“Why Sheriff, is that for me?”
“Not like you,” Steve answered, almost reverent, and he reached out tracing a gentle touch over the scars on Tony’s chest, and Tony’s breath caught. He wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and kissed him, pushing him backwards until he was resting on Steve’s chest. He tilted his head, pressing their foreheads together and smiling down at Steve.
The alpha’s friends stood up from the table, more than resting a hand close to the weapon on their belt, clearly looking to start something. “You want to avoid a beating, Sheriff, I suggest you take care of you and yours.”
“This is Wakandan,” her eyes lit up. “Is-?”
Steve frowned, his embarrassment forgotten for the moment. “How so?”
Tony shook his head. “I haven’t got the tools or equipment. Or the space really. I’m only just starting to get some decent money off my magic, and I can’t ask Rhodey and Sam to give up more space.”
“Anyway, the point is, I talked to Carol and Bucky, and now I have more time with you two.”
When Steve tried to pay, Tony had caught the barista’s eye, winking so she’d know to charge it to the corporate account -a trick they used when Tony was flying under the radar -and they’d made their way back down to the 58th floor. Steve looked around. “So, I better get back to my meeting. Sorry again.”
Tony shuddered.
Tony shook his head. “I don’t know. Everyone was accounted for. He’s not one of ours.”
Tony was a social butterfly, greeting many of the residents by name, all charm and friendliness as he distributed cats around the room. The cats were clearly used to the treatment, curling up on laps for cuddles and playing with a few of the cat toys.
Tony led him through into the cafe, waving to a tall man behind the counter with a kind smile. This must be Rhodey - Steve could see the remnants of a soldier’s posture and a keen alertness of everything in the room. When Rhodey’s eyes fell on him, there was a flash of recognition of the same he assumed, because the man nodded to him, something like understanding in his eyes.
Shame. That’s what the burning, twisty feeling was. That for all he didn’t want to be some backwater broodmare, he hated that people thought he was failing at the things his sex were best at. Or that the sheriff had made a mistake sending for him.
“And that goes for you too Hugh. Hooves on ground,” Tony added.
“Do you know where Mr Rogers is?”
Tony snorted. “I’m sure there’ll be lots of different ones. And they’ll all be fluffy and love playing with little boys. As long as..?”
Mainly his freedom.
Tony moaned, rocking his hips as he did. He started a fast rhythm, bouncing on Stíofán’s cock and panting as he worked them both closer to completion.
, I could do that much more easily, do you understand?”
“I want,” Steve repeated, trying to keep his face as blank as possible, “to do something special for Tony’s birthday.”
“Just passing through,” Steve tells him, non-committedly. He picked up a snowglobe and gave it a little shake, the flakes circling the dome and landing on a tiny city with a large ant in the middle. “Ahhh, what exactly is this place?”
The dog caught him looking, and his tail thumped lazily on the floor making Steve laugh.
Maria pulled her hair back, wrapping a hair tie around it and snapping it into place.
And on the other was a very familiar omega wielding a wooden spoon, with an equally familiar child behind him, clinging to his legs and his eyes red from crying.
Word of his success at the Barton farm spread, however, and Tony found himself inundated with requests. He filled his schedule quickly, heading out early in the morning and coming home late in the evening, with any free time spent helping in the bakery.
Tony tugged at Steve’s shirt until he got the message, pulling it off and letting Tony run his hands over the well-defined muscle. Honestly, it was truly immaculate work.
Stíofán watched him go, anger still bubbling, but left it. Instead, he knelt down brushing a hand over Tony’s horns. “You think that’ll teach him?”
“Morning, and really call me Bucky.”
“I have to go!”He didn’t wait for a response before he was out the door, sprinting towards Steve’s house. He had to be in pain, he was sure of it, because he wasn’t fit, but he didn’t even notice, slamming into the workshop and grabbing the still unfinished broom off the workbench.
Tony studied his manual vigorously and managed to write up a schedule to stay on top of it that he hung on the wall of the kitchen. It cut down on the work he had to do since he could just look at his chores each morning and get started. The wife of the General Store owner was also very kind, and when he and Steve had gone to shop, she’d told him she knew what it was like as a newlywed and written out a few of her easiest recipes for him to try. They made a world of difference: clear instructions, and she’d made sure he had the ingredients too when Steve had asked for their order.
“Senior. Then my dear old dad took over the company and had me. But, uh, you’ve remained a fixture of the Stark family.”
Tony was kissing him before the door closed, his hand wrapping around Stíofán’s horns to hold him in place. He was like a wild thing in Stíofán’s hold, writhing against him and seemingly trying to get them closer together even as they were touching all over.
“Mr Stark!”
Tony sighed, and Steve nuzzled him gently. “Come on. Let’s lie down huh? Get some real sleep.”
“I love you too.”
Pepper grinned, taking the carrier from him. “I told you we’d do it. Let me take her and put her somewhere quiet until she’s needed.” She carried Alpine out to the back, her heels clicking on the marble.
He’d been right of course. Peter had taken well to the arts as much as his other lessons, though he still hated French grammar. Mr Rogers kept him in check, firm but fair and with a level of kindness Tony hadn’t found in the previous tutors he’d hired. Mr Rogers seemed to adore Peter almost as much as Tony did, and he would often find them laughing and playing as they learned.
“Don’t you worry,” Steve said with a smile. And then scooped a large bite into his mouth.
Peter ducked his head fussing with his little paper dolls intently. “I do not know where it is.”
Steve nodded. “Yeah, the best roommate I could ask for. It used to me and my best friend Bucky, but he got himself hitched and had a couple of kids, so now it’s just me.” He shrugged. “It’s not where I thought I’d be at thirty, but what can you do?”
He continued to shovel the pie into his mouth, not stopping until it was done.
He looked up to see a very pale-looking Sheriff who did not look nearly as impressed as he should have, given that Tony had just saved a guy’s life. “Hi,” Tony offered, suddenly aware he must look a mess.
“Ma’am, really! Ana, please.” She smiled. “So tell me, do you live nearby or are you visiting?”
Hugh looked confused. “It did before. Arrgggh!”
“That would be cool,” Tony told him, pushing the door to the bakery open. “I’ll see you then.”
Stíofán pushed himself up. “Don’t wear those.” He walked to his chest, pulling out an old tunic that was too tight for him now.  “This should fit.”
It continued, and Tony didn’t seem to be getting better. Stíofán started to fret, wondering about fetching the doctor but when he suggested it, Tony shook his head.
“Steve.” Tony's chest was swelling with warmth. He couldn’t help but grin stupidly. “Look at me.”
Antonius huffed. “An Aquileian Fainting Satyr. It’s a common condition amongst the tribes of Aquileia. Well, actually that’s how it’s described, but we don’t really faint, just kind of go stiff and flop over for a moment and then we’re fine.” He shrugged. “It skipped a generation in my family, so when they realised I had it, they figured I’d have a better chance at the Stables. When the Stables realised, they figured I’d make them more money as a prize for a gladiator or a whore. No senator or general wants a bride who topples over at the drop of a hat.”
She grinned. “Known the sheriff long enough to know he’d never raise a hand to an omega.” She watched him undo his cuff, whistling at the marks. “Those are gonna sting for a while.”
“Are you like some rich dick who thinks you’re better than everyone? Is that it? Like a little lord or something?”
Stíofán clapped him on the back and took off running up the hill.
“Yeah well,” Steve took the shot she passed his way. “Hodge was getting trigger happy. I could see it, and he’d already had a few drinks. Easier just to let him have his way. I didn’t want him shooting off and hitting someone by mistake, especially not with Tony so close to him.” He looked at Tony. “Sorry, sweetheart. I hate that you went through that, whether it was an act or not. It wasn’t about you really, he’s had it in for me since I was made Sheriff over him. But don’t worry, I‘ll have Buck teach him what real humiliation is.”
He took off down the street, looking for somewhere to eat, before he spotted a bakery. It was cute, fresh bread in the window and an array of fancy pastries and cakes that had Tony’s mouth-watering. “Let’s try in there.”
He pulled back, resting his forehead against Tony’s. “I’ll accept the Emperor’s challenge.”
“So I’ll ask you again, Mr Stark. Where are my—“
Steve growled, and Bucky tried to rein it in, he really did, but one look at Steve’s bedraggled face and champagne-tarred and feathered chest and he was off again, holding his aching stomach.
Rhodey smiled. “James Rhodes. Rhodey. And this is Sam.”
Steve raised an eyebrow. “He did?”
Stíofán stretched, his back popping as he took a break from stirring the straw and mud needed for the walls.
“Yeah! It’s a Harley-Davidson WLA Liberator! I bought it from some guy who just had it sitting in his garage gathering dust. When I fix it up, it really is going to soar!”
Steve nodded, unsure what to say. He felt a little panicked and he had no idea how to explain it with his fabricated backstory. “I’m just a little…”
“Um, hey I don’t--”
He looked down at the familiar phrase, marked in the shining silver lettering common in soul words.
The alpha came into the room, and though Tony was turned away, he felt him settle on the bed next to him. “Tough day?”
“Can I see?”
“Awesome! You want some poori? My Nani made it. To make friends.”
Darling, do you realise that we do not have to worry about that anymore, we can be together as Alpha and Omega, as Steve and Tony, as the loving couple that we both wanted to be.  Yes, I know it will be a difficult adjustment for you due to now being an Omega and the restrictions that entails, but I will be by your side to love you and guide you through the transition to Omega and teach you how to be a wonderful Omega for your Alpha and Pack.
Your weight is of great concern, the dietician has worked out a feeding plan that must be adhered to, the feeding tube will stay so that during the night your diet will be supplemented by a formula high in nutrients and calories.
Bruce watched through Hulk’s eyes as his alter ego speared the omega on his enormous cock, and then proceeded to fuck the hell out of him, one huge hand splayed over his pregnant belly. He would have his turn later with the sissy, once Petey completed his first training assignment, show him a little kindness if he did well, smooth the hurt of Hulk’s brutal taking.
Toni sighed and set her work down, gazing up at the screens that played and re-played Spider-Man’s endeavors.
The back of his throat clenched and he swallowed thickly, right before the greatest surge of hatred towards Toni - towards
T’Challa wouldn’t have told her.
Toni stiffened, glancing out of the corner of her eye as she counted Laura’s quiet footfalls. She settled down two feet away from Toni and tossed her a jacket. Her fingers spread across the synthetic material, her eyes darting upwards to meet Laura’s once before she put it around her shoulders. It smelled distantly of Clint’s favorite cologne and she closed her eyes for a moment, just to savor the memory.
“What you did for Barnes?” Hope began in the quietest voice she’d ever used. “That was...I can’t
“Try not to think too much about it, Vision. Or do. I dunno. My advice tends to come from a place of self-loathing and resentment. Listening to me is...inadvisable.”
He stepped away from the window and turned to face the woman who had somehow managed to sneak up on him.
Stark’s indulgent grin was small and distracted but real. “The prettiest,” she told her, then with her fingers she drummed a pattern onto her sternum where Bucky knew her arc reactor was embedded into her chest —
She shrugged again. “I know. But the choice is there.”
Rhodey got in contact with President Ellis and Everett Ross, whom Toni conceded was the more tolerable Ross. Good old Thaddeus was conveniently omitted from any form of contact in spite of him having left a bazillion messages and even more emails and Rhodey’s perpetual response of
, had Toni looked up at the picture of James Bucky Barnes.
“Hey, Toni.”
“Laura,” Laura interrupted almost immediately, and though her expression never flickered, her fingers twitched against the hemline of her top. “Just Laura is fine.” She lingered there a moment, then walked towards the fridge and began pulling out ingredients. “I’ll get started on those waffles, then, shall I?”
“For someone who is doing so much to see her friends regain their freedom, you are strangely silent on their current welfare.” He tilted his head to the side, scrutinizing. “You have not asked after them. Why?”
So, my plan to have this chapter out a week after the previous one failed pretty spectacularly. I initially thought I had about 90% of it done and then decided to add in like...six thousand more words, so...yeah. I hope those extra six thousand make up for the late update?
There was a beat, then she shrugged, her expression somehow honest in its inscrutability.
She was as keenly aware of the way it rested against her skin, like a promise, as she was of the adamantium bead the kids had made her, as she was of the arc reactor in her chest and how a man named Yinsen had once saved her life.
. She would know. She’d played second string for a time.
, Peter,” she said again and, with the kind of care she usually reserved for when working with a particularly delicate piece of tech, she lifted his mask off of his head and made a strangled noise in her throat when she saw how bloody it was. “FRIDAY, damage,” she demanded.
“Mr. Barton.” He looked up and found T’Challa’s knowing gaze on him. “Come. Take a walk with me.”
. She’d fucked up. God, she had fucked up. Again. And no matter how many times she tried she just kept fucking up.
Sooo, what did you guys think of FRIDAY and Vision's interaction? In my head FRIDAY is obviously Ana Jarvis. I just like the idea of Toni surrounding herself with people whom she trusts and I have headcanons of Jarvis and Ana parenting Toni the way kids should be parented whenever Howard and Maria aren't around.
. She wasn’t like Pepper with her itineraries and her color-coded lists; there was a maneuverability in her plans and in the way she did things and Toni found herself liking it and adapting to it.
Before they entered the elevator, Nat heard Toni and Vision speaking quietly behind them.
This is what people did, didn’t they? Rich people, traumatized people, people who hated themselves, people who hated being around other people. They moved to the country, to nature, to
As they were scrubbing in again, Helen nudged her with her shoulder.
There were pencils and pens and paper and tablets, doodles and half-done math equations, a soldering iron, a penknife and what looked like a very expensive but well-loved camera.
And Natasha had helped do that. Whatever happened in Siberia, that one event that had truly broken their family apart that she was too afraid to ask about...maybe it wouldn’t have happened had she not let Steve and Bucky go. Maybe if she’d tried harder to talk to her friends. Maybe if she’d been able to speak to Toni properly, come up with a gameplan,
“It’s the only assurance I can give you.”
Clint stared down at the phone in his hands and wondered when he’d turned into such a useless fuck-up. His wife, his
“The Commissioner’s issued evac for three blocks but I heard them say there are still people stuck in two other buildings, not including Roxxon,” he informed them, tossing his walkie-talkie - she really needed to get him a better one - to the floor and coming to stand by her. “Pretty sure all the lower floors managed to get out but fire or damage is blocking those at the top.”
“I’m not worried about Stark,” he said. And the strangest part of it was that it was, quite honestly, true. “I think,” he continued slowly, carefully - always so careful with Steve - “that after everything she’s already done for me...hurting me wouldn’t make much sense, y’know? She’s...she’s invested a lot in me and I don’t…” He swallowed thickly -
In the silence that followed Toni just watched Shuri; she was a culmination of so many wonderful things. There was a kindness to her that Toni never had, a genuine and unrepressed wonder for life and all its mysteries and possibilities, there was strength and love and
He would regret that for a long time.
Scott was currently spewing his verbal diarrhea at Ayo, who wore a pinched expression as if a particularly noisy mosquito was buzzing in her ear. Clint nodded and fell into step as they began a slow stroll around the courtyard, the sound of Steve and Princess Shuri’s sparring and Scott’s babbling a somewhat therapeutic background hum.
She wondered how long it had been since T’Challa had managed to let go like this and felt a tiny little surge of smug pride. Take
She was small, impossibly small for someone who had done so much, who had encompassed lifetimes into the very sinews of her body. Though he should’ve reserved all judgment considering the man he was standing next to, the man who, at this very moment, was probably wishing that it was his name she’d called.
Then she went back into the house, past the kitchen and into the spare bathroom, sat down on the toilet seat and buried her face in her hands to cry.
Stark snorted, tapping a few commands into her tablet before lightly kicking a wheelie stool and sending it rolling it over towards where Bucky sat
“And, we’re done. Let’s light ‘em up,” she declared, then raised her hands like a conductor and Bucky watched, utterly enraptured, as all around him machines powered to life, a hologram of his body scattered into being, and several charts floated in mid-air, all green, blue and purple.
“Thanks.”
It was hard not to be bolstered by the simple conviction of Nat’s little speech. She was always adept at that, saying everything that needed to be said and using as few words as possible, a skill she must’ve developed because she just hated having to
“He would do well on the Subcommittee, wouldn't he?” she said, and Toni’s heart leaped in her chest. “You will send him our regards, will you not?”
“Yeah,” he said, feeling the fight slip down his shoulders, into the heavy weight of his arms and onto the floor. “Yeah.” He slumped down onto the floor, suddenly so very tired as he gazed between his knees.
And surprisingly she did. Though not before Nathaniel threw up on her, Cooper tried to weasel his way out of doing homework and Lila asked her to braid her hair while she did her math assignment.

She didn’t know what happened after that.
“Hey Rhodey,” she breathed, his name like a prayer.
She started but didn’t turn, merely listened to Laura’s now so familiar gait, her footsteps as gentle as everything else about her. She settled next to Toni, pressing their sides together so she could throw a large, woollen blanket over both their bodies. Toni shifted closer, instinctively leaning in towards Laura’s warmth and her comforting scent.
wanted to be back home, something tells me that you would be. After all, you could always ask my king to drop you and your friends somewhere outside our borders for the authorities to pick up.”
“No,” he rasped, and his hands gripped the backrest, which was accompanied by an anxious creak of metal and wood.
She felt the unbidden beginnings of a smile in the corners of her lips as she read the last part and she tapped out her response before she had time to overthink it.
Nothing there.
- being suitably impressed when Kamala showed off her cape and Shuri and Hope talking about Disneyland. If only Laura and her family were here, if only the others-

“Bring the rest of the world onto your side. The final UN hearing next week. If you can convince the Council, you’ll get your pardons.” He spread his hands wide in front of him, as if he wasn’t asking her carry the weight of the world on her shoulders. “That’s all.”
The arrangements with the UN were finally getting underway and she’d forwarded the first batch of her main amendments to the respective representatives and had already heard back from a couple of them. She sent T’Challa the one she’d worked on with Laura. It took three hours for her to compose that email and another three hours for her to actually send it.
T’Challa clasped his hands behind his back, something Steve noticed he did before delivering somewhat hefty news.
For a while he just sat there silently, giving her no indication as to whether he’d heard her or not. She had been about to open her mouth to ask again when he finally spoke, the timber of his voice low and so
They stayed like that, just sitting in each other’s company, until the sky began to lighten and the first rays of clouded sunlight inched their way above the tops of the trees.
Toni looked at him, took in the tired lines around his eyes and the tense furrow of his brows. She hadn’t asked about what had gone down in Wakanda. She didn’t need to hear it from T’Challa; he had enough to deal with on top of his relentless assault on the Council, the Panel and the half-formed Subcommittee with regards to the Accords and the Avengers contracts. She loved that he wasn’t above using his royal status or his father’s name to further their cause.
It was impressive.
“A bit. It’s beautiful there. What little I was permitted to see.”
The kids were noisy at dinner. Cooper and Lila were arguing about one of their teachers and Nathaniel was talking to himself in that almost-English-but-not language like most English-speaking kids his age. Laura spoonfed him at intervals and Toni stared unblinkingly at her own food until her eyes blurred. Water dripped off the ends of her dark hair and onto her bare shoulders and she could feel it, every cold drop at a time.
Bucky sent him a look, a combination of a self-deprecating grimace and resignation. “Think they did it on purpose. Someone more...objective gets to make the call.”
. Y’know, in a lot of cultures six is an unlucky number.”
Without further ado, on with the chapter! I hope you all enjoy :)
She slammed her hand down on the table, jarring the video sequence of Spider-Man dousing the would-be robber with a shaken bottle of Coke.
she hissed, baring her teeth up at him. “We are so done. And you know what?” She pointed at his chest and smiled nastily. “
“My first thoughts were that it was a prison,” Stephen said and there was not a trace of judgment in his voice. “But when you sent me the notes and the blueprints I saw that Doctor Banner’s name all over. I’m guessing it’s meant to be less of a prison and more of a...security measure of sorts.”
“I think we should’ve asked her
, not sad.
The biggest monster.
He smiled, small and self-deprecating. “I have thrown more tantrums in front of my mother this week alone than I did during my entire adolescence. It is not...becoming of me.” T’Challa visibly inhaled deeply, then exhaled, long and slow. “When I had first realized that my father was not the man I thought he was I made a promise with myself to be
Abruptly, she straightened, turning around fully and crossing her arms as she settled on Bucky.
It was her final day in Wakanda when Steve finally went to Nat and said, “I’ve got everything I wanted to put in, I think. For the most part.”
“A question for another time, Toni, we should keep look-”
She was talking about the Accords and Steve couldn’t help it but the name alone sent annoyance and irritation crawling up his spine. But he continued to listen. Because he hadn’t before. And because he just wanted to hear her voice after so many months of silence.
Toni nodded and smiled ruefully, the first sign of emotion she’d expressed so far. “The others are locked underground. I couldn’t destroy them. They were…”
Harley smiled, shit-eating and smug.
was what she had said.
He opened his mouth to answer, the strange sensation of the codewords being reverse engineered still lingering on the back of his neck and in the metallic taste on his tongue.
Just as quickly it was gone, as if it had never been there in the first place.
Peter and Harley grinned at each other. “Sweet,” they said in unison and proceeded to fist-bump one another much to her hysterical exasperation.
Snow fell across her eyelashes but she dusted the bleak, dark walls and the Siberian white away with her next statement.
When she opened her eyes T’Challa’s breath caught in his throat and the pure terror mirrored back at him.

Clint had nodded slowly, looking at Steve with something akin to cruel disappointment and disgust.

But Toni shook her head, unable to feel pride in any way that Rhodey was intending her to. “Shouldn’t have had to in the first place. This world, man. When did it get so crazy?”
she didn’t realize they were that familiar already - and
When she smiled it came surprisingly easy.
“Did she, now?” she said slowly, and it only seemed to deepen the lines around his eyes. FRIDAY was always a sucker for a smooth-talker. “That’s convenient. Well, then. I suppose you’ll be hearing from us. Do you need a ride back to the city?”
It was a
From a man who had saved her life.
The shrug of her shoulders was a lost, unguarded thing. “One day at a time, I guess. Or maybe it doesn’t get fixed at all. Maybe it never can.”
“My friends. I would like to introduce you to my sister, Shuri. She is more than the brains behind our good country; she is also my keeper, so she likes to think.”
Jarvis had once said something along those lines. Whereas Ana had told her to keep the important things so that you wouldn’t always be looking for new ways to smile.
bad at selling this but-”
“And now we would like to call Ms. Toni Stark to the stand.”
“Who-?” she began, voice shaking.
The hairs on the back of her neck stood on end when Barnes stepped through the doors of the kitchen. The air itself felt like it had dropped ten degrees and for the briefest moment she thought that if she exhaled through her mouth her breath would turn Siberian white.
Breath caught in her throat, Toni reached out, her hand landing softly on his cheek. He met her gaze and went rigid, immediately realizing his mistake.
In the moment of silence that followed, her sadness was almost palpable and not for the first time Vision wondered whether in addition to manipulating others’ emotions, she could also project her own. Or whether that was simply a byproduct of their connection with the Mind Stone.
Bucky. The weight of his hand on Steve’s shoulder.
“Well, shit,” she laughed, and he shrugged, feigning nonchalance.
“I like it,” he said, and there was an almost magnetic attraction between their suits from where he was touching her. Strangely enough it calmed her nerves a bit. “It suits you.”
hovered wordlessly after and Toni grabbed it, letting it settle in the pile of self-loathing that she kept somewhere in the pit of her stomach.
T’Challa didn’t speak for a while, simply brushed his thumbs across her skin in thought. It was oddly soothing and she hoped someone wasn’t going to put this in the papers tomorrow. That would feel like a violation. This was nice. It was special. She wanted to keep it that way. She’d get FRIDAY on the job the second they left.
Laura smiled and reached out to take her hand. “True. But that’s not a bad thing. And like you just did with that piece of junk, just because one component is broken, it doesn’t mean you can’t use what’s left. You can always salvage parts from the wreckage. Some old things, some new. You can make it work. You can make it better. You can make it stronger than it was before.”
And Toni was
“If it will help, I will confront Shuri about her unnecessary interventions and enlisting your aid when you are already stretched thin with your responsibilities.”
“Because he is my friend. Because he is
“Perhaps further discussion on extenuating circumstances that may encroach on our supposed neutrality should be brought up during the first meeting,” Vision supplied, even as he added his own comments in the margin.
Computer speech didn’t have a voice, so it was impressive that FRIDAY had managed to imbue her report with such venom that Vision very nearly
She stood up, the sound of her chair screeching across the floor making the hairs on the back of her neck raise chillingly.
And her father’s shield.
The inbox disappeared and was replaced by an animated galaxy screensaver.
“Got it in one, sweet pea. How old’re you, Ms. Khan?”
He looked at his team, his friends, the ones who had followed him and placed their trust in him and he had never felt less worthy. Wanda looked scared, Scott’s brows were furrowed in confusion and concern, Clint looked angry, he always looked angry these days, Sam was a solid pillar as ever and Bucky-
Toni breathed in slowly through her nose, then straightened and made her way past the HR lady and into the room, meeting T’Challa’s gaze one last time before crossing the threshold.
enough, not to bear any ill will towards Bucky while he went through this.
Guilt twinged its way up her spine but Natasha would’ve told her to deal with it because when you were faced with an unknown variable, sometimes you had to
Like Natasha had told him all those months ago; the important thing was staying together. It didn’t matter how, just that they did.
“I don’t mind,” he’d informed her breathlessly, his forehead dripping with sweat as he came and sat down next to her. “You’re…” He winced guiltily. “I’d rather you than Toni. She’s too...

Thankfully Rhodey was Rhodey and Natasha was just equally good at thinking up battle plans on her feet so they hopped on their sparkly new quinjet and headed to town, picking up Spider-Man along the way, who literally catapulted himself off the top of a building into the quinjet’s open hatch.
. “To look at your families. To look at those whom you love.” She thought of Hope and Stephen and wondered what their brilliant minds were thinking. Whether Pepper had that soft smile on her face, whether Happy was clasping his hands tightly in front of him the way he did whenever he was excited about something. She thought of Peter and Harley and Kamala and Shuri wished and wished and wished she had the emotional capacity to show them how much she cared about them, how much she looked forward to seeing them become the people she knew they could be. “And I ask you to ask yourselves. How would you protect them from the what’s to come? Whether it falls out of the sky or whether it’s

But she had to. Just once more today.
“Boss, we’ve found him,” FRIDAY interrupted and Toni’s focus sharpened to a fine point. “Cameras just picked him up in Tudor Park. He doesn’t look so hot, Boss.”
“You did
Toni slumped back into her seat and folded her arms crossly.
That was easily one of the most hilarious things she’d ever heard so she fucking

forge, something old with something new.
He really did sound regretful. But more than that it was a weight lifted off of her back that her fears weren’t unfounded, that there were people who believed that Earth wasn’t safe. It was satisfaction driven home.
Toni couldn’t say she had. But she had seen the personification of it before. She wondered if it was as upsetting. She expected Shuri’s image was even more so.
“Vitals are holding steady.” She held out her hand and one of the doctors placed a dermal regenerator — a true U-Gin and Stark Med collaboration — in it, and she promptly began running it over the jagged edge of Barnes’ shoulder. “The gangrene is healing well enough. There’s not
She thought of Rogers. Of when he used to be Steve, Steve,
“Brave new world.”
Just as quickly as it came, the feeling melted out of him, leaving a raw, hypersensitive film of resignation and loss. Because she was right there, god,

If anyone could unpack and reproduce an energy source to the exact measurements of an arc reactor it would be Wakanda’s resident genius princess.
He sobered as he surveyed Kamala and Toni’s heart went out to him because sixteen-year-olds shouldn’t have to be driving across the state just to save girls whose eyeballs were bleeding and their bodies literally falling apart.
.” She left it at that, knowing Nat would glean more than just a semblance of coherency from it.
Because that’s what Toni was, it’s what she did. She fixed things.
“The Charlie Spencer Relief Efforts. A joint project between Toni and Miriam Spencer. Took a while to get her to answer any of Toni’s calls but when she did…” She let that speak for itself.
Pepper hadn’t looked happy. She had that expression where she had resigned herself to the gravity of what Toni was saying and what she was trying to do, but was angry at the way that it had to be done.
“I did,” she said, still not turning around, because if she did she didn’t know what she would see. Her father.
It was like she hadn’t slept in
“They’re still bitter over the whole Suez Crisis,” Natasha supplied in an undertone and Toni tilted her head from side to side. “Understandably so. They’ve been taken advantage of more than once by foreign nations.”
“I’ll see you soon. We’ll have that talk. And a whole lot more.” It wasn’t a request.
Toni frowned at the sudden buzzing in her ears.
. But it had been, and it had
“Yeah you did,” she interrupted. “Whatever it is, yeah, you meant it. You’re a man of your word, right?”
He didn’t know how they could fix this. Whether this could be fixed.
“Something on your mind?”
They trembled and the muscles twitched and the scars were raised. But to her, they represented intricacy and detail, the fine kind of work on another human that she couldn’t possibly hope to reproduce in this lifetime. They represented lives saved, each one the center of his universe for the duration of the surgery. How important they must have felt.
“I know,” Sam calmly reassured him. “I told them they were only looking at your side of things. I told them that until we know everything about Siberia we shouldn’t be fanning flames or coming up with any wild theories. Clint has some theories of his own. Poor dude has a
“You better keep that kid safe.” And that was an odd thing for a villain who had just tried to kill said kid to say. “There’s a lotta unsavory folks out there and if they find out the connection between him and you? They’ll use him to get to you.” He smiled and it was all teeth and T’Challa placed one threatening hand on his shoulder and another on Toni’s.
“When?”
Dummy cooed worriedly, trying to divide his attention between Vision’s heavy silence and FRIDAY’s righteous rage.
“We use the mirror dimension to practice magic for a reason. It’s why I incorporated it into The Room. The outside world doesn’t affect us in here and we don’t affect anything out there. Nothing goes out and nothing comes in.” He looked down at her, arching a brow. “Except you, apparently.”
“Hey.” She blinked and Toni was frowning at her with disapproval and something as close to reassurance as they could be at this stage of their relationship. “Don’t think too hard. I was a shit conversationalist at the time. I still am. She deserves someone who knows her better. Just call her.”
“I don’t deserve it but—”
For a moment she could almost imagine that it was her last night on Laura’s farm, when the grief was still new and hadn’t yet burrowed into all her cracks until some days it was the only thing holding her together.
Shuri was, in her opinion, sitting far too close to him and was trying to examine his very sentient, very irritable
“Thank you.”
“So that’s him, huh?” Hope said, coming up beside her and gazing through the window. “That’s Spider-Man.”
“I’m taking my vitamins,” she remarked flatly, then added softly, “and going to therapy. Again, you might want to try it some time.”
But first she needed to pick brussels sprouts for Laura was going to blitz them in the oven with bacon bits.
Her smile turned wry. “Yeah. It has, hasn’t it?” She and T’Challa shared a short look before she addressed them all. “Unfortunately, as much as I’d like it to be this isn’t a social call. I see wonders never cease.” She nodded towards Steve’s tablet and the stylo held loosely between his fingers and gave him a small smile. “So I guess we’ll start with the contracts first and work our way up to the Accords. That includes you too, Barnes.”
“Stevie,” he began quietly, and Steve knew what he meant without him having to go any further.
Bucky was in a lighter state of cryo while Shuri was in the US, so Steve left the apartment feeling restless and frustrated. He went down to the gym where the Dora sometimes trained; Okoye and Aneka were with T’Challa this time but Ayo, ever stoic and dispassionate, was practicing with a staff.
A hand landed atop her trembling one and Vision stiffened, giving her a sharp look of alarm.

She swallowed thickly. “I told Vision. And T’Challa and Nat know. T’Challa was there. He saw it. And Nat...Nat knew about my...about my parents...
Even without the phantom pain, even without
ungrateful—”
who was alone in this. Who had a plan because Toni always had a plan even if she had to pull it out of thin air in a split second and cling to it with jagged nails crusted with grease and blood.
It was like her ears had popped, like all the sound had been sucked from the room, like she was in a vacuum watching everything happen in slow motion. A migraine throbbed in the distance and she inhaled slowly, feeling her lungs burn the way they had burned when she had flown through that portal and the air ran out. The way they had burned when she had gasped in air at about minus twenty degrees, and it had felt like a hundred daggers of ice were piercing her chest until she had thought her lungs would burst and she would drown in her own blood.
“I’m Spider-Man.
Startled, she stared down at the rotund bundle, fumbled with the bottle for a bit, then held it steadily until he wasn’t just sucking air and giving himself a bad tummy. Nathaniel made little noises in the back of his throat as he drank, and blinked slowly up at her. Natasha had been right; he
“Toni,” Vision began again, interrupting her thoughts. “I would just like to say that I am pleased that you are coming back to New York.” He stopped, his face betraying a myriad of emotions that Toni couldn’t keep up with. “It has been...lonely without everyone. Without
“The temperature has not fluctuated since we first arrived, Toni,” Vision uttered. “You are exhibiting signs of stress.”
“Hey yourself,” Toni said, equally soft, rubbing her left wrist and worrying her bottom lip and her fingers were playing with something shiny around her neck. That was new. “Are you…?”
Just then the door to the meeting room a little way down opened and the HR woman who had pulled her aside earlier stepped out.
“But he’s my dad.”
, he wanted to say.
“You wanna go for a walk with me?”
. But yeah, we have some new faces because we
“Yes,” Toni and Shuri both said at the same time.
Ellis nodded slowly, though his eyes were sharp, missing nothing. “And I suppose the Secretary of State being, well, out of state, has nothing to do with it?”
But he was so much more than just his legs. He always had been. She would make him see.
Barnes might have nodded jiltedly behind her, might have opened his mouth to say something -

“In an old house in Moscow that was covered with vines,” Toni sang, barely more than a whisper that summoned all Natasha’s demons from as far back as she could remember, and then some more until she couldn’t
He let out an incredulous huff, looking stumped, and strolled over, still glancing back at the door like he was trying to figure out what it might do next. She
“This is your home, built using your money,” Vision supplied when it became apparent that she wasn’t going to say anything. “I’d say you had the most choice in the matter.”
“You totally
Her eyes flickered down towards her tablet, her fingers tracing patterns on the now-blank screen.
“I’m a futurist, remember?” She grinned. “The next step is all there is.”
The look on her face.
Much like the last few chapters, I owe a huge part of my soul to the brilliant, baddest ass beta of all, Demigodscum, without whom I would still be waffling over this chapter. Seriously, honey, you are the actual best. <3 <3 <3
“Reckon everybody knows your name after Leipzig,” Clint supplied carelessly in an undertone. He had the phone T’Challa had given him in hand and his attention kept alternating between it and the TV. Steve often wanted to shout at him,
“Haven’t been able to,” Laura admitted, pulling two mugs out from the cupboard and a box of Earl Grey.
“A few more days.”
she said lowly. “When you let yourself join with the Mind Stone you obtained true humanity for the first time. You had a choice. And you chose to ignore your prime directive, the
She ran her finger over the bead where the letters ‘S’, ‘P.P’, ‘K.K’ and ‘H.K’ were carefully carved in their respective handwriting over the surface of it. Her heart clenched in her chest, a warm feeling emanating from her heart and spreading outwards, like a soft, golden glow.
protect them in turn.”
.” She was only vaguely aware she was seething, that there was a simmering rage behind the arc reactor that was fueling her words. “You don’t take matters into your own fucking hand without knowing all your angles. You don’t just fucking declare your stance on shit you don’t fully understand and then expect the rest of the world to follow you just because you think you stand on the right side of righteousness. You don’t just fucking
“She said that you knew something was coming because you’d seen it. When you flew that nuke into space.” She felt pinned in place by his words, by how old, how
One afternoon, she was playing with the tumble dryer in the shed for no reason other than the fact that she’d stumbled upon it, not really knowing whether Laura already had one hidden somewhere in the house. When Laura came in and found her tinkering with the machine she’d chuckled.
He turned around again and Helen Cho stood tall and prim on the other side of the glass, her mask lowered around her chin.
“You’re doing good work here, Toni,” came Stephen’s quiet voice as he stood once more, finishing off the last of his lemonade and carelessly tossing the empty glass through a portal. “I understand your reasons for creating this space and I respect them. So I say this with only the best of intentions; I think this is necessary and I believe the others think so as well. But I also think you should prepare yourself for the eventuality that one day The Room is going to be utilized in the manner as Doctor Banner intended. I know that’s not what you want to hear but there will always be threats, Toni. And this may be the only way to contain them.”
Happy would never be the same again.
Vision found her four hours later in Lab B after FRIDAY’s alert, floating silently across the room until he stood by her side.
“Yes,” Stephen said after a time, and Barnes faded further into the background of her mind, but didn’t disappear entirely. “I’d...I’d like to try.”
"No single word in English renders all the shades of тоска (toska). At its deepest and most painful, it is a sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without any specific cause. At less morbid levels it is a dull ache of the soul, a longing with nothing to long for, a sick pining, a vague restlessness, mental throes, yearning. In particular cases it may be the desire for somebody of something specific, nostalgia, love-sickness. At the lowest level it grades into ennui, boredom.” - Vladimir Nobakov in Lolita
The second thing she noticed was the beard.
“Oh,” he said, then went red in the face because-

The holo screen, which had the dual functionality of acting as a cover as well as displaying his vitals, disappeared and he sat up out of his melancholy musings.
It was surprisingly easy to have the Accords wrested from her control-freak hands and spread more evenly amongst Nat, Rhodey, T’Challa and Vision. They were, in many ways, so much more suited to political delivery than she was. Nat had faced international scrutiny before, Rhodey was one of the most decorated military men in modern history, T’Challa required no explanation beyond being
“Ah,” she finally spoke, her voice dangerously soft. “Well.”
“She didn’t know me anything private; she wouldn’t have even if I’d asked. And she sensored a whole lot,” she quickly told him, shifting guiltily on her seat. “Not the swearing, though. But who am I to judge?” Toni nibbled her bottom lip and Peter narrowed his eyes. “I swear I won’t do it again. This was purely a one-time thing. I’ll...” She gestured vaguely, awkwardly with one hand. “Ask. Next time. Unless it’s life or death, like you’ve lost your mask and have been taken captive by an evil octopus and need saving.”

As if it wasn’t bad enough already, Wanda interjected, a slight tremor — the catch in her false bravado — in her voice as she spoke.

“Thank you.”
looked her in the eye and Laura’s ADX-level of control slipped just a little. “Wakanda. With the others. Except for Romanov. Dunno where she is.”

And when she opened her eyes she was distantly aware of Helen and Shuri having a conversation over her head, their tones somehow too light and too casual but too far away for her to pay them any attention.
“How’d you think?” he murmured, sounding choked but when she pulled back his eyes were dry and settled over her shoulder.
Just before he followed Steve back out again, he heard his name being called in the quietest voice he’d ever heard, barely more than a breath.
The room was deathly quiet; whether it was out of respect of because they wanted to see the spectacle that was Toni Stark was beyond her ability to gauge. Somewhere above her T’Challa sat like a statue, regal and confident. On a row to her right were Coulson, May and Johnson, their attention unwavering. Vision, Rhodey and Nat were somewhere on the left side of the room while a sea of international faces gazed down at her from all angles.
He rolled his lips together to keep back a grin but his eyes gave his mirth away. “I’m not judging you,” he said finally. “If I didn’t think this idea held merit I wouldn’t have volunteered. And it does,” he added, looking at her sidelong with an intensity that had her insides churning funnily. “And the other Avengers know it too.”
“See, these babies have no biological nature whatsoever. That needs to be programmed into it. I’ll literally have to give them their own DNA. Kinda cool, huh?”
“I need to head into town to pick up some stuff anyway. Won’t be a few hours. Plus Lila and Coop need someone to watch them do their homework, so.”
She pondered on the perceptiveness of children, children who absorbed the emotions of those around them as organically as osmosis. And this poor boy, this quiet kid who liked to make wood sculptures, who missed his father as much as he was mad at him, who hugged Toni and didn’t want her to leave in spite of knowing what she was and what she’d done…
“You think they need you. Your friends. They didn’t for that situation.”
“You’ll be fine, Toni. Mr. T’Challa has only ever conveyed his utmost respect towards you.”
“Yeah,” she agreed. “Me too.”
“Sometimes,” she began quietly, thinking of the crackle and pop of JARVIS’ voice as she flew out of range, “there are things that are better left forgotten.” She waited but Stephen didn’t argue and there was understanding in the lightness of his sigh. “So you decided to become an Avenger because of New York?”
“So, uh, you know that I’m trying to push forward the Guarantor Clause. Which basically means that minors or masked heroes need someone to vouch for them before the UN.”
“Sisipho Itobo,” T’Challa declared triumphantly as he glided into the meeting room, arms open wide in exaltation. “The newly-appointed Panel Head of Wakanda.”
One of Laura’s kitchen cabinets was uneven so she took the door out, sandpapered it down and refitted it during the hours of three and four in the morning. Lila had come down for a glass of water, seen Toni work, and quietly sat down at the kitchen table to watch until she’d fallen asleep again, head cushioned on her crossed forearms.
And it felt good knowing that ever since they’d started working together Laura didn’t have to listen to Toni walking around the house during ungodly hours of the night looking for something to do. There were nights where she would hear Toni walk out the front door and she would wait with mounting anxiety for the sound of an engine followed by her car leaving the grounds. She only let herself fall asleep again when the front door opened and Toni’s padded footsteps came up the stairs and disappeared into her room again.
“Oh point oh six seven seconds, Boss.”
They both remained silent, caught in their own thoughts, in their own exhaustion.
“What do you think, FRIDAY?” she asked after a while, pulling up a 3D rendition of one of his portals that, from what she could tell, seemed to connect to some vague point between the Himalayas and the Andromeda Galaxy.
Kamala had made them in art class: one for each of the kids and one for Toni that was currently sitting on top of her favorite desk in the workshop. Each of the misshapen but lovingly-made mugs had their initials on the side in different colored glitter. It was hilariously garish and
I was meant to post this on Wednesday but I legit had no time to edit during the week so here we go! This chapter is pretty LONG so make yourself a cup of tea before delving into this one. But yay, we finally meet T'Challa! I seriously love that man so much, like I ship T'Challa/Tony (Toni) so hard, you have no idea.
She felt…
“I swear, I’ll bring him back,” she promised. “I just need a bit more time.”
He curled his lip in distaste, glared at Natasha a final time before he practically grabbed Toni’s upper arm and stomped out of the bathroom and
, I want you to be my voucher. I’d sign now but I think you’ve cut off the circulation to my fingers and that’s my writing hand.”
And then Stephen had stopped in front of her and Wanda had looked unsure but also
, and Vision spewed logic better than a goddamn Vulcan.
“I’m not saying no. I want you to do it,” he told her, and surprise, brief and transient, flickered across her face. “If...if you’ll still...then I want you to do it.” He nodded, more to himself than to her.
“Cutting in,” Hope snapped in a tense voice, and they could hear the rapid flutter of her wings. “Found the bad guys. They’re, fuck, they’re HYDRA. Heard the salute and all.”
I'd be really interested to hear your thoughts, even if all you want to do is rant at me for taking so long, lol.
was like being surrounded by balmy summer air and she exuded a sense of
When he opened his eyes, he did something he hadn’t done in a while, something that JARVIS had never been programmed to do but had accomplished in his own way.
Toni’s heart plummeted to her feet. Because no.
She swallowed thickly as she raced into the city. “Thanks.”
Bucky suspected Stark would’ve answered had she not been astoundingly devoted to ensuring the circuitry of his upper arm was absolutely perfect. He couldn’t even recall her
That was…

“Done and done. Initiating scans of Ms. Khan now and transmitting them to Vision. He is already in the midst of setting up the molecular stabilizer by my recommendation. Boss, she is in one serious state of flux.”

“That’s one in the swear jar for you, Vis,” Stark said, managing to crack a smile, as stressed and tired as it was. “But yeah. Quarters. Quarters, quarters, quarters. All right, Barnes. We got this.”
“After we got back from the meeting on Thursday I got an alert that Spider-Man had somehow managed to get himself in trouble. I saved him from drowning near some fancy suburb.”

The woman jerked upright, the arc reactor creating two colorless pinpricks of light in her wide eyes. Shoving the hood of her blue MIT hoodie back, she slid closer until he could see her face more clearly. Her hair was a mess and her eyes were puffy and she looked like death warmed over but gosh, Peter still thought she was one of the most beautiful women in the world.
“Nat,” Toni continued, observing her closely. “Go get some rest. You look exhausted.”
“Zemo told you, didn’t he?”
The inability to sleep the first night, Toni had been informed, wasn’t exclusive to her. There was something about letting yourself be vulnerable in a different bed, much less a different house in a different state in what felt like a completely different country. And sleep was perhaps the most vulnerable that she could ever be. It took her a while to get used to most new beds and the guestroom’s queen was no exception, notwithstanding that she’d slept in it before.
“Would you like some breakfast? I was thinking about making some savory waffles.”
She looked away and up only to meet Steve’s eyes across the room, doctors, machinery, space and a single panel of glass the only thing separating them in that moment.
Ayo did, he wanted to say. Self-loathing and guilt did.
A wry smile, an apologetic smile.
Steve had seconds before he was desperately trying to swallow the thick cum flooding his mouth.  The burning sensation he felt as he swallowed was not something he had expected, but the taste outweighed the discomfort he felt.
The watcher smirked,
“Now I will perform an ultrasound so that we can confirm that Tony’s reproductive organs have matured, ready for mating and pregnancy.”
“My dear, you must be thirsty, perhaps you would prefer a bottle of cold water.”
The Avengers meet with Pepper and Tony's doctor.
Before placing the omega in the Cradle, he injected him with a highly concentrated dose of oestrogen and progesterone, as well as placing a slow release dissolving capsule in his cunt just below his hymen which would encourage slick production.  Steve would be receiving a highly emotional, wet and horny omega in his suite tonight
Darkness shadows both Alphas faces, they want more, they need the tiny omega’s total submission, his complete capitulation to the will of his Alphas.
Winter and Tony finally meet.
“Fucking hell, dirty cow!”
Boarding school was pivotal in shaping his future behaviour, in order to counteract the ill treatment at the hands of his bullies he began to use his wit and intelligence to fight back as he knew physically he was no match.  Within months his bullies retreated, nobody wanted Tony hacking into their lives and that of their parents causing mayhem.  Unfortunately, this isolated him even further so he turned to bribing and buying time with his other class mates.
“Well it looks like no breakfast for you Stark, that means plenty more for me then.”
Tony leaned back into Thor’s strong arms, glad to take the weight of his feet, this would be the las pregnancy be for the hundred year calm.  Thor had promised him weeks of forge time and even a trip off world to visit the dwarfs as his present for all the pups he had given them.
Suddenly two went bundles of boundless energy appeared before him spraying droplets of warm sea water and thrusting small hands full of slimy wet seaweed towards his face.
“Alpha, please, please, I submit, I am yours, I need your knot!”
The decline in the omega birth rate could not be allowed to continue, omegas needed to be bought back under the control of Alphas and the Government. Fights amongst individual Alphas over an omega would soon devolve in to State against State and Country against Country as omegas became rarer. Feral Alphas could not be reasoned with, omegas were necessary to an Alpha’s well being.  As it stood it would take a whole generation from when the laws were repealed to re populate omegas and this was only because omegas usually carried multiple pups, the bigger the litter the more chance of an omega pup.
“Now you are going to sit there and look at yourself for the next two hours, I want you to think about your behaviour and the consequences of disobeying me again.
The two pups would be given the new test at six months of age, which would reveal their orientation, the omega pups would be raised in Special State run Homes to ensure that they were educated and trained in how to properly serve their future Alpha Mate, whilst betas and alphas would be put up for adoption.  Bruce was being put forward for the Nobel Prize for Genetics for his development of the formula for the orientation test and his work on the genetics of multiple birthing for omegas.
Steve inquires about further physical alterations to his baby boy.
Tony knew it should be physically impossible for his body to take in both Alphas fists without being ripped in two, but here he was bearing down as his knees slid out to the sides, his holes swallowing their fists, then their wrists and as gravity had its way he ended with his cunt and asshole seated halfway down their forearms.
Thor did not look to impressed, just as he was about to speak Steve laughed, pointed to his still hard cock and said;
An hour later he awoke when his butt plug began to vibrate and the dildo in his pussy started to grow larger pulsing as it stretched his inner walls.  Struggling out of his burrito blanket he slipped off his joggers and the baggy t-shirt he had been wearing taking a moment to sniff the faint smell of Steve’s Alpha musk that still lingered on the rumbled fabric.
“Good girl Betty, can’t have my omega falling asleep, want you awake and fully aware when our bond forms.”
Judge Edwards and his assigned court clerk/recorder were escorted to her office within minutes and once settled in the comfortable chairs facing her she drew a breath and began to speak.
I understand that Mr Stark has been admitted to Mountain Rise Conditioning Centre, you may now proceed with the medical treatments that have been recommended and any others that they or you may feel are required or needed.
The sun was beating down as he slowed to a walk, scanning the area he made out a darker shape in the distance, it looked as though it could be another cabin.  It seemed like hours of walking and resting, before he reached the cabin, his skin was burnt, his feet covered in blisters.
He waited until Widow’s back was turned before he scooped up Tony and ran towards the Portal.  He knew that he only had a few more minutes before it would close, just as he reached the edge a body slammed into him, not thinking he threw the omega into the Portal hoping that someone would catch him, even if he could not escape at least Tony would be safe.
Over the last two years he had modified and perfected her body, so now she was  petite, curvy and had a full bust with pert nipples that were always erect. Her blond hair curled round her shoulders framing her delicate features.
Tony quietly followed Steve hand clutching the pictures of his pups, Steve’s calming touch was the only thing keeping him from completely freaking out over this latest revelation. It was so confusing part of him was panicking at the thought of trying to birth and look after three pups, but another part of him was preening under the obvious approval of his Alpha.
He will have his own surgeon do any other modifications as and when he decides, he also wants to break you himself, which l am quite happy to allow as l really don’t have the time to deal with you.
Tony could hear Loki’s screams as he pushed the pups as quickly as he could down the corridor, Bruce laughing at his flushed face and the trickle of slick trailing down his leg.
Non consensual body modification (again)
The doctors had been concerned by some of his behaviour and had advised further psychiatric reviews to ensure he was stabilised and free of Hydra and the Winter Soldier conditioning. Steve just knew that they were being too cautious and had advocated that Bucky would be better off with his mates and the Avengers to watch over him, after all he had known Bucky since they were kids who better than to recognise if he was having difficulties or acting unlike his Bucky would.
Tony wailed as his body convulsed with yet another orgasm, his fingers uselessly trying to stop the stream of piss that flowed over them and down his thighs.
Steve preferred Tony to be naked at all times when they were alone, but he work shop was the one exception clothes were needed for protection and safety.
Steve’s hands start to massage his stomach pressing down on the water filled mound and it’s all Tony can do to not cry out as the increased pressure sends shooting pains through his stomach and his ass clamps down on the plug.
“Does my needy bitch want me fuck his throat until he chokes? Do you want me to give permission for your cock teasing lips to swallow me down, suck on my dick like a popsicle?  Then once your stomach has been flooded with cum I could slowly fill your cunt with my fat cock whilst fingering your clit until you scream and squirt for me.
The Parkers have some visitors.
Chapter 44
Bruce noticed the change in May, now the omega’s sweet scent filled the air with pure arousal, the underlying scent of sadness and fear disappearing.  His cock hardened, his eyes taking in her squirting cunt, as she cried out as a sixth orgasm rolled over her.
The paparazzi were practically tripping over themselves to get a photo of Tony as they stepped out of the main doors of the Tower that evening to go to their dinner engagement. Steve smiled, his hand held on Tony’s lower back, turning him so the photographers could get the money shot, of him in the short red Valentino embroidered dress and spiked heels.
“Time to milk your tits Stark.”
I thought it best for today, as he is still adjusting to your new bond and Sarah. When the memory resurfaces it will play on his mind and create a need to actually fulfil his supposed dream.  So in a few days you are going to have an incredibly horny mate who will want to indulge in a threesome.
“You will never say no to me, you will take my cock wherever,  whenever and however I want.
Tony sat in the bath just holding the sponge, it didn’t t feel right to be alone or responsible for washing himself, daddy Steve always took care of it. A sob caught in his throat, what was the matter with him, how could he want this, how perverted was he.  Steve was right to bring him back to the Clinic, he wouldn’t be surprised if he just left him there and forgot all about him, and found  somebody normal.
Tony was not happy with the change, he wanted his bottle back and to be sitting on daddy’s lap. Slapping his hands on the tray he proceeded to make his feelings on the matter known.
“Such a good omega Tony eating and drinking all your lunch, you deserve a reward. Going to massage your tits and fuck your cunt, then I am going to milk your tits.  Going to wait till they are full and dripping then I am going to suck your teats and feast on your milk.”
Tony clawed at Steve’s hand trying to pull it away to stop the ever increasing pain as his cock was slowly crushed.
Peter hated going up to the Avengers Pack floor of the tower, but Ms Pepper his Alpha insisted that he visit his aunt two times a week to have lunch with her, and to spend time with Omega Tony discussing the latest developments in R&D and if Tony had produced plans for new tech for SI to bring them down to her.  There was also the unspoken rule that he was to make himself available to any of the Alphas of the Avengers Pack, whilst he was present on the Pack floor, he could only be thankful for the chastity device Pepper insisted he wear at all times when not in her presence.
Steve gasped at Tony’s words, how could he have not noticed that his little one was upset that the babies had arrived and was even a bit jealous of all the attention they were receiving.
Tony waited for Steve to let him up so he could go pee and get rid of the horrid diaper with its sticky cum soaked front.
Tony was becoming more agitated the longer he spoke, tugging at the wrist restraint and trying to kick the blankets off with his good leg, anger and pain sparking in his eyes. Steve placed his hand on Tony’s good shoulder and gently pushed him back against the mound of pillows, he hoped the medical staff would get there soon, Tony was becoming more and more hysterical, tears streaming down his face as he shouted himself hoarse, convinced that he had been kidnapped and Steve was an evil Hydra clone.
“Now, this is the CAT scan was done after we operated on Omega Stark. As you can see his broken leg has been set and his dislocated shoulder replaced, this was the easy straight forward part of the surgery, we then reversed the gastric by-pass and cleared most of the scar tissue, along with cleansing his stomach, intestines and bowls.  A full blood transfusion is under way to flush out the drugs currently still in his system and we will do two rounds of dialysis treatments over the next few days.
Naked apart from her collar she crawled back to kneel in front of Steve, head bowed, hands clasped behind her back she thrust her chest out for his inspection.  Hard fingers twisted and pinched each nipple, tugging and stretching the sensitive nubs until she began to mewl, her cunt throbbing and dripping her sex juices onto the carpet.
“Do you buy your own clothes and food?”
“Tony, you know that I only want what is going to make you my perfect omega and I think that getting rid of those nasty little things will calm you down and make you more centred.  You will be able to focus on my pleasure without being distracted by your own needy desires.”
Time stood still, Asgard and the Fates waited with bated breath, Tony smiled as golden bolts of lightning flashed across his vision, welcoming him home.
As he sat keeping watch over Tony that night, Steve hoped and prayed that Tony would accept his courtship, he knew that before all of this there had been a spark of something between them, but both had backed off unwilling to pursue a relationship knowing that long term it would never workout. As difficult as it would be if Tony refused his courtship and chose another pack member to mate with, he would respect his decision and would never try to force a mating bond.
“Stop struggling Loki, you are immortal and can withstand a few minutes without air.  Now be still or I will take my belt to your behind, and that will be in addition to your punishment for stabbing me.”
Steve knew that Tony would struggle with his task today, his sweet boy didn’t have a lot of experience with women, regardless of what the papers had published.  Women never wanted to admit they could not remember the night they spent with the playboy, so the legend had grown.
Keep him tethered on his back to the breeding bench and ensure that the fucking machine is used for at least four hours twice a day, anal penetration only for the first three days and then gentle cunt stimulation for two days.  After the fifth day the bitch will be able to be pounded in both holes without any fear of tearing his wound.
“Yes Alpha.”
Withdrawing once he saw his omega was close to losing consciousness he let him draw a few pitiful gasps of air before he thrust his spit slicked cock back in to the wet warmth of his omega’s throat, with his other hand he grabbed at Tony’s throat and rubbed his fingers along the obvious length of his cock under the thin skin.
“Ms Potts, it would seem that your body is remarkably sensitive to any kind of stimulus at the moment, probably due to the amount of alpha cum ingested and fucked into you today.
You need to be punished for not just breaking my trust but for endangering yourself and your baby.”
Tony moaned the gel was cold and that he didn’t like the bright lights, and could they hurry up before he starved to death.  In fact, it wasn’t until the sound of rapid heart beats filled the room that he stopped grumbling and looked at the monitor.
Tony was curled up on the sofa wrapped tightly in warm soft blankets sleepily watching Steve complete the latest Shield mission reports.  His mind felt fuzzy he knew that he should be more focused and working on the latest SI designs, even if he could not use his hands he could tell Jarvis what he wanted done and the bots could handle the cleaning of his armour for now.  It was not as though he was going to need it for the foreseeable future.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Beautiful isn’t she, my perfect omega bitch, there is no need to be shocked by her lack of clothing or undergarments, historically omegas remained naked with only a collar and jewellery adorning their bodies.  One of the Stark Amendments is that ‘Bonded Omegas must be shown in their natural state, decorated only in the jewels of their Alpha to show their subservience and ownership. Omega clothing if allowed by an Alpha must be such that it clearly shows the wearer’s orientation and exposes their omega bonding marks and brands of ownership.’
Tony didn’t want to admit that he much preferred the milk and oatmeal to the bacon, eggs and hash browns.  Steve  was good enough not to say l told you so, which meant Tony gave him a small smile as he wiped a drop of honey from the corner of his mouth, rather than push his hand away.
You have five minutes to get your pussy to swallow both bottles, l don’t want to see a gap between your cunt lips and the seat of the chair.  Fail and l am going to give you a good old ‘high and tight’ marine cut.”
Pepper and Steve together had decided enough was enough, it was time to ensure that Tony was bought under their full control.  Faced with all the bad publicity and the drop in Stark Industry stocks Tony agreed to step down as CEO and place Pepper in charge of the Company.  The next step had been getting Tony down the aisle, Tony had been surprisingly resistant to getting married so a drunken weekend in Vegas solved that problem and ensured that there was no pre-nuptial agreement.
I’m a strong advocate of this amendment, omegas service one purpose, and should be available to their Alpha at all times, clothing is a privilege, and only necessary if the climate dictates it.
“Mmmm, Winter I think that our fuck toy likes the idea of being a real bitch, no stubby cocklet ruining the line of her panties, yes Tony we know all about your secret stash, you will be getting punished for keeping that secret from your Alphas
He spotted the Avengers across the ballroom saw then gather closer around Steve when they saw him. A wall of strength he could not penetrate, there cold hard stares daring him to come no closer.  I would be impossible to speak to Steve directly but there was no more time, this was his last chance to set things straight.
No clothes for you today, feed the girls then come find me, l want you to spend a long session on the fucking machine this morning.”
Tony attempted to pull the covers up over his head but with his mitten covered hands couldn’t get any hold on his blanket, giving up he closed his eyes and evened out his breathing, in a desperate attempt to fool a god, two spies, a green rage monster/Dr and a Super Soldier that he was asleep.
Bucky's views on what is happening.
“Jarvis lights off please and set an alarm for 6 am.  One more thing Jarvis please ensure the forge in the workshop is heated to the correct temperature for branding I will be ready to take Tony down after breakfast, goodnight.”
“When we get to the private club, l want you to be quiet and only speak when l say you can, keep your eyes lowered and don’t eat or drink anything unless l feed it to you.
Tony rubbed his rounded stomach, they were going to have the first scan as soon Steve and Winter returned.  His Alphas had decided that their omega would have a scan to determine how many pups he was carrying and test to determine which Alphas pups he was carrying but after that they wanted to bring back the rituals of a traditional omega pregnancy.  He was slightly concerned as to what that entailed but had been assured Jarvis would monitor his and the pups medical health along with Dr Banner and that Steve and Winter would take care of everything else.
There is no way that l am going to be demoted to her PA, just so that she can steal all my work and present it as her own!”
Ty couldn’t believe his luck when he had seen Tony slip away to the bathroom, he had followed quickly when he saw Captain Rogers get waylaid by the Vice President.   Locking the bathroom door, he had slammed open the cubicle door, startling his old boyfriend who was struggling with his pants.  When Tony had called him daddy, his cock had gone from half hard to rock hard, the pink thong sent all his blood rushing south.  It was simple to pull the smaller man out and rip off his clothes, before tossing him up onto the vanity, smirking at Tony’s cry of pain as he slapped him, then squeezed his thong covered cock until tears streamed down his face. Pushing the thong to one side he eyed up the ringed cock and balls, the tiny cock no more than three of inches long hard.
“тихо! You pathetic little omega, the pups are fine.  God knows what Stevie wants with such a weak cry baby omega who can’t take a bit of pain, you must be a great fuck for him to put up with all your whining and whinging.
Nimble fingers wove new threads in to Asgard’s Tapestry, three twisted black threads split, one turning golden, weaving its way into the future, leaving behind two thin and frayed black threads that were tied off with a sickly yellow thread.
The voices talking above him just a distant faint murmur, he did not even resist when another set of hands lifted him, turning him round so that his pregnant stomach and milky tits were on full display for the whole pack.  A foot nudged his knees wide apart the heavy weight attached to his small omega cock swinging between his exposed thighs.  The hand in his hair roughly yanked his head back exposing his bonding marks and scent glands for all to see.
Steve smiled as he watched Tony’s eyes skitter away from the mirror, Tony would just have to get used to his new wardrobe of clothes.  His hair had been cut and styled, so that the curls were full on top but the sides and back slightly shorter, eye liner, blusher and a shimmer of lip gloss complemented the tight red t-shirt that showed off his slim frame.  Hipster jeans gave him a view of the soft roll of stomach flesh, unseen beneath were the black silk panties with a mesh panel running through the crotch which would show off his plugged asshole and bound cock.  Gold toenails peaked out from his red Birkenstock sandals, his matching fingernails still tapping away on the Stark pad.
The binding rings will provide an effective visual warning and constant reminder to your boy of what could happen if he displeases you.
Steve strode into the workshop to find his omega sprawled across the large leather couch tugging at his caged cock and trying to convince JARVIS to release his butt plug so he could fuck himself on the dildo he had hidden in his worktable.
“What the fuck Jarvis! Let me down right this minute, what the hell do you think you are doing!”
Mrs Hogan will become joint CEO with Captain Rogers on return from her honeymoon.  Ms Natasha Romanov will become her personal assistant with a view to temporarily replacing her whilst she is on maternity leave in a seven months’ time.
Tony threw Loki a sympathetic look as he left, he knew there was nothing he could do to help and if he was being truthful, he didn’t want to upset his Alphas and be punished.  Since his operation and transformation, they had become strangely more caring and protective.  They were both still incredibly strict and would discipline him if he misbehaved, but the harsh brutal treatment he received before had ceased.
Before closing the wound he ensured he flooded the gland with his own alpha hormones, Pepper would instinctively be subservient to him from now onwards.  He wasn’t going to reveal to her that the serum had also enhance the strength of his hormones, so that over time she would loose a little more of her alpha essence.
Morning saw him hard and irritable, his skin itching from having to slept naked on the cotton sheet, why the hell could they not have been silk, he was going to demand silk sheets if his Watcher wanted him to continue sleeping naked.
The gel was cold on his stomach, but at least his legs were no longer spread in those horrid stirrups. He was still naked but that was nothing unusual, apart from now there were two strangers getting a good look at his junk and jelly belly rolls.  Crap, now that he had thought about food, he really wanted his jellybeans, maybe he could also convince Steve to stop for burgers on the way home.
Explicit Pet Play, don't read if not your thing,  Tony/Daisy Cow does get guilty enjoyment from what is done to her.
Peter stumbled and tripped as he was dragged through the barn by his nose ring, a switch to his behind soon had him trotting a long behind the herder until they reached an empty stall.
The End.
The first photo showed Captain Rogers, Tony Stark and Pepper Potts gathered round a table signing documents, in its-self it would not normally have made the news, but the dramatic transformation of Tony Stark and to some extent Pepper Potts has sent the internet wild.
Now once I have milked my boy I would like the doctors to go ahead with the procedure, I do not want Tony knowing what is going to happen, I want the pleasure of revealing that to him myself.”
Bruce could see that she was burning up, the serum eradicating extremis, literally heating it out of her system.  Pepper’s face was flushed and her arms twitching as she rubbed at her prickling skin, he could see that the cool breeze was making her nipples pebble, the silk shirt buttons straining as she twisted and turned.  The tight pants would be unbearable against her heated skin.  Time to test the other aspect of the serum, see how pliable she was to another Alpha’s will;
Happy smiled as he cupped her face, rubbing her tears into her skin, and pushing the snot running from her nose into her mouth.
Tony to his shame felt another gush of slick escape, the heat of arousal coiling in his belly.  He could feel his pussy clenching in time with his asshole, his empty holes desperate to be filled.
Steve texted Natasha to advise her of the situation and to advise her to monitor Pepper’s behaviour whilst Jarvis would monitor her for any medical problems.
“Relax Stevie Boy, I know I can’t fuck you, I just want to make you feel great. Come on you must have wondered how it feels, seeing as how the little bitch writhes and begs for it, even I can find the pleasure in it, especially when it is your huge cock reaming my asshole.  Please Steve let me show you, I want to love and care for you as much as you do me”
“D..daddy h..hurts,  please!”
Yes, he wanted a traditional trained omega obedient and submissive to his will, to behave in public as a perfect bonded omega should do.  In private he would allow some leeway in behaviour so long as Tony did not take too much advantage of it, he enjoyed watching his omega fight against the restrictions placed on him trying to find a way around them before using his unique mind to process the changes and adapt.
But that would all change now that he, Captain America had been unfrozen and bought back to life after seventy years under the Arctic Ice.
“Hmmmm, Steeeve, pancakes now, stupid weigh in later.”
Grabbing hold of Loki’s hips he forced him down further on to his cock, until he could feel his hard length through the thin skin of the omega’s stomach,  Loki wanton moans of pleasure increased as his knot caught and pushed passed his rim to fully inflate, locking them together.
Tony drags himself up on to the bed, the cool smooth sheets giving relief to his abused nipples. Resting his forehead on crossed arms, ass raised high he waits for both Alphas to decide their next move.
Read the Tags, if you don't agree with any of them I would suggest you do not read this.
Tony couldn’t believe how Steve was dictating his future, he had just escaped crime one controlling Alpha and now Steve was acting as though he had the right to tell him what to do.  When was anyone going to ask him what he wanted.  The baby had finished feeding and was now asleep so he asked Steve to place her back in her crib.
“Great Bruce, can we start now, Tony has napped long enough, I have ordered a sexy corset for him to wear to the White House on Monday.”
“Yes Alpha.”
Chapter 25
(See the end of the chapter for
The taste of the thick creamy paste was disgusting, he tried putting his tongue over the end of the feeding tube and sucking slowly but only succeeded in nearly choking himself when there was a sudden change in the speed and pressure of the flow. All he could do was keep swallowing; he wasn’t even sucking on the feeding tube now.
Thor ran his fingers over the hoops taking note of how they slotted together to form what looked like a cock cage along Loki’s plump lips. His cock hardened at the thought of what it would be like to see his Loki’s clit trapped within the rings, the tip disappearing up into her cunt.
“Good morning Alpha, Bruce, l hope we have not kept you waiting to long?  Pepper was a bit resistant to my choice of attire for her this morning and obviously tired from her excursions last night.”
He knew that the chances of this happening would be minimal, even though his body wanted to submit his mind still fought the impulse to submit to an Alpha even if it was his mate.  He may have said the formal words of submission to Steve but there was still a part of him that was ingrained with years of resistance to bend to the will of an Alpha’s orders.
Now move the mirror to the end of your bed tilt it so l can see you when you lay down.
“Awww baby, only a few more minutes and you will be as clean on the inside as you are on the outside.  See daddy has turned off the tap, now you just need to stay still whilst I remove the tubing and then we can get all the nasty mess out.
Steve would take his time tonight with his Bucky and ensure their bond was fully settled so that in the morning he could decide on what level of bonding he would allow between Bucky and Tony.
Steve flushed.
“ Good you are awake, the Captain was most insistent that you be aware of everything that is being done to you.
Steve and the other Avengers rushed to the elevator and within two minutes were standing in front of the steel shuttered glass walls.
Now it is time for your appointment with Lydia, you will be able discuss all your concerns and worries with her, she is going to guide you through all the missing memories and tell you the correct way of dealing with the trauma you suffered.
Loki plays with Tony whilst his Alphas watch.
Steve checked out their Social Media Accounts once Tony had fallen asleep.  He snapped a picture of Tony’s discarded dress and shoes and posted it on his Instagram account, ‘Sweetheart looked beautiful tonight, every little twink should have pretty red dress.’
‘Stunning’ was the only word that came to mind as Steve watched Hulk lead Tony/Daisy in front of them, her nipples pulled taut by the thin chains attached to them causing in turn her huge milk laden udders to be stretched out in front so that the thick rubber bands constricting them were on full view as she trotted quickly along behind, trying to keep up with Hulk’s large strides.  Below the mound of her pregnant belly the ruffles fluttered giving glimpses of frills and of the gold bell hanging between bowed thighs, each ring sent a jolt to his already throbbing cock.  The sight that had him loosening his pants to take his cock in hand was that of fleshy round globes framed by ruffles and split by the skimpy thong jiggling with each step.
“Tony have you made your choice, I need you to be clear about what reward you want, I will be happy either way with your choice but you need to realize that the procedure that you don’t chose will then become a punishment for any major transgression in the future.”
Tony was well aware that Steve had just assumed the pups would be boys and then in turn present as Alphas, so it caused him no end of amusement to dress the pups from head to toe in pink and frills even though he hated the colour and watch as Steve tried not to crush the delicate fabrics as he held their pups, it had been worth the spanking he had received when his Alpha had finally caught his amused thoughts through their link.
As an omega now, your body is not strong enough to cope with the strain of flying in the suit for hours at a time, especially if you are carrying babies.
Hulk’s large hands made short work of washing his riot of curls, his Alphas had been refusing to let him cut his hair for the last 3 months, saying that a traditional breeding omega took on a more androgynous appearance, so they appealed to all members of their pack.  This was also their reasoning for having his balls inverted and he should be thankful that his penis had naturally shrunk to a small enough size that they didn’t need to have it docked. Tony had not been able to sit down without discomfort for two days after calling it a load of bull shit, saying it was just his Alphas being knot heads who couldn’t make up their minds if they wanted to fuck a male or female omega.
“Good idea Bruce, also I think that Friday should be restricted to the Tower and the Compound, after Ultron and Thanos I don’t feel that the public are ready to know the extent of her abilities, apart from the fact I don’t feel comfortable with her having access to the whole of the internet and the ability to hack into any data base in the world.  Put what restrictions you think are necessary and just give Tony access to simple commands for help within the tower, no news channels as well, I do not want him concerning himself with outside problems, he needs to learn to let go and concentrate on what is now important to him as an omega.
Odin passed his hand over the bowl, whilst staring at the shifting patterns in the blood, it was no surprise to see the minute golden flecks of Frigga’s magic in the blood.  His wife had such a soft spot for her younger son and had been extremely unhappy with him when he had decreed that Loki would become Thor’s omega and be attached to the Avengers Pack to serve the remaining time of his sentence.
Coulson seeing that Natasha had finished, and that Steve was beginning to look annoyed as well as confused decided to continue.
Every time he tried to make inroads on it the scratching noises and near silent whispers from the overhead vents distracted him once again.  He was going to kill Barton and Natasha if they did not stop using the vent in the Heli-Carrier as a means of getting around unseen. Although he was decidedly surprised that they were making any noise, perhaps the lack of missions over the last few months had made them complacent.   He would have to review their training schedule and maybe set them some work teaching the baby agents if they had the time to sneak around in the vents.
Betty smiles as the President as she places her hand over his and guides it closer to her mons.
“Dirty little bitch, look at the mess you have made, clean it up.  Go on bend over and lick it clean, make sure that everyone can see your sloppy boy pussy.
“I don’t remember any of that, if you don’t let me up l am going to call security and have you arrested.”
Deaf and blind, she had been strapped to the breeding bench for 3 days, being mounted by the hounds whenever their doors into the breeding room were opened.  Jarvis for some reason had just left her and not bothered to call any of the staff to release her back to her kennel.  When they had returned, she had been severely dehydrated and hysterical.
He managed to run and jog for five miles before he needed to rest. He could hear Tony whimpering towards the end and didn’t want to cause his omega an more distress than necessary.
Breakfast with the Avengers and a challenge from Thor.
Once in the shower JARVIS released both plugs so he could complete his enema.  Using unscented soap he scrubbed his body clean making sure his cock and the folds of his pussy were fresh and clean.  After drying himself he just had enough time to clean his teeth before situating himself on his hands and knees in the centre of the bed.
Heart beating rapidly, he almost missed seeing Steve’s hand reach into the limo.  Shakely, he took hold of it and with as much grace as he could muster stepped out and into the awaiting media frenzy.
A furious and hysterical Tony had promptly gone out and lost his virginity to the first Alpha he had come across, the thick leather collar that had always been locked around his neck since he presented stopped any attempt at bonding, not that it would work anyway since his obviously demented and delusional father had ruined  any chance of him finding a suitable Alpha mate.
8.	Discipline first position – Raising up to his knees he placed his clasped hands behind his head.
Steve was intrigued by that having another age range between baby Tony and adult Tony, it would be a good threat to use if he began to misbehave when at public events.
Sita turned from where she had been pinching and twisting Loki’s nipples making them hard and red.
“Thank you Jarvis, l am going to shower and change, return sight and sound please over the next twenty minutes, l want him naked and empty, but on the verge of another orgasm, ensure that his bladder is full again before removing his gag.”
As Thunder and lightning lit up the sky, Sif and Hogun placed runes on the two Alphas wounds and watched as their final breath left their bodies.
The film was the most downloaded on the internet, the hardcore version was only available to a select number of people who could afford the extortionate price and who guaranteed to keep it in their private collection.
Steve had been furious and instead of breeding him himself, had dragged him down to the kennels for Raider to impregnate.
“Perhaps a certain omega threw one to many tantrums this morning about his mitts and being allowed to eat his own breakfast, which resulted in Bruce getting a little big green and having to spend some time meditating before Hulk made an appearance.  Then a certain Bird Brain caved to big tearful doe eyes and allowed him to eat said breakfast on his own and then disobey the rule of only one topping.”
,” she breathed. Then, because she was a masochistic idiot who enjoyed contradicting her own words, she asked, “What are you even doing here?”
Toni faltered a little, suddenly unsteady and unsure about what they were really talking about, but Helen continued.
“Are you well?”
“It’s not a
in some way. Like she was monitoring his reaction to see whether or not he’d prove whatever unspoken expectation she had about him.
“How...how long may I say?”
A young, dark-haired woman with a white strip dyed at the front stood there, hands clasped behind her back and her posture reminiscent of a certain Maria Hill.
A thousand miles away, hours and hours ago, Toni was staring upon a sea of flashing lights and loud shouts and a flood of questions.
Reaching out again, she stroked the curve of Toni’s cheek. Toni shuddered at the touch, her forehead creasing in pain and Laura stilled before moving closer in concern.
So, we're finally moving forward a little in this chapter. Just a little. And there's some plottiness happening but again, nothing profound yet. Still, I do hope you enjoy this chapter, and I promise that things will start kicking up to speed soon.
Toni looked up at her warily. “Okay?”
“We are literally in a different dimension,” he explained, hands in his pockets as he came up beside her. “This entire training room is in the mirror dimension,
Because that was what they’d become to one another.
“Whoa. Hey, no. I know that,” she told him hastily, not wanting him to think he or FRIDAY were in trouble for looking for her sorry ass. “I’m not mad at anyone. I mean if anything…” If anything they ought to be reading her the riot act for being such an asshole and leaving them to deal with the aftermath of what

Shuri pulled a face at her and Toni rolled her eyes. “And I didn’t take him out because he’s a mouthy little shit.”

Aaand, on with the show! I hope you enjoy <3
He lit up from the inside, his relief palpable, whenever Dr. Eccles let him practice with his neuroprosthesis, the support on the lowest setting. It even made her relax a little, just to see Rhodey’s spirits rise. Things weren’t great between them, but she counted the fact that he didn’t kick her out when she started monitoring his PT sessions as a win.
. She saw a man stripped bare, a man defeated yet not. She saw a mirror and a reflection. She saw someone who was something and became something else, something new.
Where she landed next to him amidst the rubble in the aftermath of a fight, faceplate raised, and give him a sweaty, relieved smile. When she sat cross-legged on his desk, having nudged his laptop precariously close to the edge of the table, as she fixed his communicator. Where her voice carried over the comms, relaying the enemy’s position or reassuring the team that she had their backs.
And then Doctor Cho straightened in her seat, bringing up a 3D diagram of Bucky’s shoulder and the current implant, and once again, it was like watching Toni Stark morph into someone new, someone with sharp eyes and professional attentiveness, someone who was ready to get right down to business.
And of course, Natasha proved to be fucking boss at coming up with solutions to problems. No surprise there.
Because Bucky was stronger than him.
That was a surprise; she would’ve thought Pepper would have at least notified Toni of the incoming. Unless of course she thought Toni needed the jolt.
“Thanks, Vision.”
If I hear a single fucking peep out of any of you—”
“Steve.”
Instead he watched Toni with the same, if not stronger kind of hunger, of

She blinked and Rhodey blinked back at her. He groaned and pushed himself up, rubbing his eyes.
“Thought we agreed months ago that this wasn’t all on you.”
“As long as you want,” was the immediate response. “As long as you need to and,” she trailed off. “As long as you think you should.”
unfazed as he returned to monitoring Bucky’s vitals.
“Who’s the kid?” she asked, reading checking her brain function on one of the monitors.
,” he said evenly, “was even more dangerous. So I picked a side and it was you.”
she breathed, taking it from him and running her fingers over the engraving. “This is the coolest thing anyone’s ever given me. Except for my suit, of course,” she added with a sweet smile at Toni, who just rolled her eyes and waved them off.
Through her subtle effort not to meet his eyes, what she could see looked...wilder,
“After Ultron,” she began stiltedly, then sighed. “I know Vision is good and something wonderful and amazing. But I also know he could easily have been the destruction of our world had you and Bruce and Thor not stepped in. For a long time the fact that I’d made that possible made me question everything I knew about the work I was doing. Whether I was moving faster than our world was ready for. Whether I was...trying to play God.” She shook her head ruefully and Toni had to bite back the protests that were ready on the tip of her tongue. “But then you came to me with that project for Colonel Rhodes and…” She shrugged. “I slowly fell back in love with my work and with myself and I could look at Vision and see that I’d had a hand in creating something precious out of fear and chaos.”
She swallowed. “Not a story to be told over a phone, Platypus.”
T’Challa hummed in understanding. “You are justified in your anger. And in your pain.”
She nodded slowly and Toni reached out and grabbed a wheelie stool for her. “Here. You’re welcome to watch, if you like. Just put on your protective gear,” she added, pushing an extra pair of glasses and gloves at her, which she obediently donned, looking excited.
That’s what the Civil War had resulted in.
A flash of metal.
“Whoa, Lord’s name in vain,” she gasped. “Aren’t you a puritan?”
“Captain Rogers?”
a system of accountability, some more extreme - frighteningly so - than others. It may not have made international news but FRIDAY and Vision had brought up the stats of what were essentially lynchings and witch hunts of enhanced individuals that had occurred in recent years across the globe. That was something they were going to have to bring up with the Council. Not today but some time during the week-long discussion.
“Doctor Stark?” the nurse said, and Toni got the feeling that it might not have been the first time she’d called her name. “We’re ready to begin when you are.”
She didn’t have an answer for that. None at least that would appease him. Luckily for her she knew her face said everything her own words couldn’t.
As if he’d heard Steve’s inner torment, he craned his head over his shoulder, meeting Steve’s eyes. They held one another’s gaze for a long moment before T’Challa bowed his head in an understanding nod. There was nothing Steve could say in return that could appropriately convey how grateful he felt in that moment and it was yet another reason why-
His hands, clasped together on the table, entered her vision next.
She heard Laura get up to leave.
in them the same way that I do. Because the Accords are about protecting people; they are about making us accountable for our actions. They are about working with people, with each other, which is something we didn’t always do before. Not just myself and the Avengers but other organizations like SHIELD, for example.”
people, to shake their hand or stand too close to them because he is afraid of what he thinks he might do.” There were tears in her eyes now and a bone-deep disappointment in them that Toni drank up and let seep into her pores until it belonged to her.
Only Toni could make that sound like an insult. Only Toni could hit where it hurt the most without even lifting a finger.
. It was one of the things his SHIELD therapist - who had, ironically enough, turned out to be HYDRA - who had told him to sit with his feelings. Just sit. Just
She looked back at Toni, who licked her lips and frowned at the ground.
“I just have one more order of business.”
“Laura—” Toni began.
Toni smiled. “Did you name her? If you name her it means you’ve got her for life.” She softened her voice, allowing herself to be vulnerable for a while. “You know what they say about pets.”
It was the pragmatic approach she’d been trying to sell to the Council and to the rest of the world, tailored to her audience when necessary but the underlying message was the same.
considering all he was wearing a very flimsy pair of espadrilles - as he did an about-turn and zoomed towards Stark.
from the woman who was hurting so badly from a wound that she had inflicted.

She felt him before she heard him. Felt that synthetic soul that by all rights shouldn’t have existed but did, felt the power of the Mind Stone humming,
Stephen appeared to physically steel himself, and without a word from him, the cloak unclasped itself from his neck and sped towards Toni, where it immediately wrapped itself around her shoulders and sent her stumbling away from the door.
She looked up and stopped mid-sentence, her gaze flickering unsurely to Peter for a brief second before focusing on Toni once more. It was strange, seeing Shuri
“I’m not doing it for them,” she said, and deciphering the level of truth in that statement was an exercise in futility, even for her. “I’m doing it for the world. Because we’re going to need heroes. There is...so much out there that we don’t know.” A hole in the sky. An endless black. A void. An unnamed fear. “We’re defenceless. And because I didn’t, no - because I
“I would welcome your honesty, Ms. Stark. Whatever you have to say to me you can say.”
, she’d said.
“Oh, Toni,” he whispered.
Never let it be said that Toni didn’t use her fame wisely to help a newly-enhanced girl get the hang of her powers.
“Yeah.”
The room exploded.
Laura didn’t answer immediately, her fingers drumming against her chin in thought.
“Those are a bit more open to interpretation and debate considering I have access to the Iron Man suits. Also Vision’s existence rather complicates matters further. One high school student sent Boss a very interesting essay on the subject if you’d like me to forward it to you.”
He didn’t know her.
And finally.
She’d burned the first batch of fried rice and stood in front of the stove silently panicking before Laura took pity on her and helped her prepare it again from scratch, bumping their hips together as they worked. Laura herself had been acting a little off all week but Toni didn’t push; she’d tell her if and when she needed to bring it up.
She wished she’d put on more concealer to hide the suitcases packing under her eyes.
was what this was.
She stopped stirring.
For a moment it looked as if he was going to stay. But then as if on cue, Steve angled his body towards him, though it seemed to kill him to have to turn his back on Stark. Again.
It was gutting. And he felt like shit for feeling that way when Shuri had done so much, done
Stark’s voice, soft and quiet, sounded strangely loud in the sudden vacuum of the room.
The slow-motion crinkling of her red suit, deafening in her ears. The glass-like explosion of a blue heart.
Because unlike them - save for Scott - he had a family to go back to, he had ties and responsibilities and he’d left Laura with barely a lifeline.
“You really think so?”
“After T’Challa’s gesture of generosity I...finally found a way to incorporate a lot of things I wanted into the suit,” she agreed. “Powered by its own arc reactor like the other suits. But more...resilient.” She paused, then added in an undertone he was sure he wasn’t meant to hear, “I’d like to see a couple of super soldiers have a go at this.”
Toni stilled, the hand holding her spoon hovering just out of reach of her mouth as she watched Rhodey slump a little in his chair.
. He smiled, then, and it was soft and so fond that it made her heart ache. “That is my duty, Toni. Wakanda is
“When are you going?” Cooper asked.
Toni takes the first few steps towards her demons. But there is one she can't yet bring herself to confront. Because just looking at him causes the sound of shattering glass to echo in her ears.
“The mechanism looks incredible,” Shuri said, with a delightfully impressed grin. “This level of ingenuity should cost
T’Challa watched her carefully. “And how is...all that?”
“His highness, King T’Challa, although very young, is a worthy ally.”
“I know what happened in Siberia.”

“Jesus,” she whispered, skidding to her knees beside him and gently taking his face between her hands. “
Toni smiled to herself, daring to hope, daring to believe that this could be something good between them. A fresh start. A shared venture that didn’t carry the weight of Bucky Barnes between them.
“It…” He began, embarrassed when he felt emotion swell in his throat. “It works.”
“So that’s your gameplan?” Coulson continued, looking wholly unimpressed. “Try and kidnap Toni Stark and get her to build you something?” He looked like he was trying to bite back a smile. “For some reason people seem to conveniently forget how she became Iron Man in the first place. You could give her a
“Hey, Vision,” she greeted carefully. “You look…”
Toni didn’t even have a second to respond when the door burst open and Natasha marched in, grabbing her by the shoulders and shoving her into the nearest stall.
Upon his seal of approval Toni turned back to Maria.

Peter gave him the stink-eye and folded his arms, even as he kept darting a cautious gaze at the girl who was currently whimpering.
“Since this is a democracy and not a monarchy,” he said smoothly, “I believe we can do away with titles. ‘T’Challa’ is much more palatable than ‘Your Highness’, don’t you think?”
He finally met Toni’s eyes, looking rueful. “My actions and emotions over the last several weeks are not exactly worthy of a round of applause.”
When she spoke next, it was apropos of nothing.
She’d said it herself.
“M’ sorry,” she breathed. “Hand slipped.”
“He’s right,” she said, then made a show of flipping through her notes, even though she’d read them on the flight over. “But we’re getting off topic. So. You were a neurosurgeon. And now you’re a wizard.”
“Y’don’t need it,” Steve reassured him, meeting Toni’s eyes for the briefest moment before she busied herself with some machine and that claw in his chest only squeezed tighter. “Like Shuri said, you’re in safe hands.”
useless. Because surely, Steven Rogers, Toni Stark has proved over and over again during the last few months that this,” he looked up and saw her hands open in front of her, “is not irreparable.”
And maybe he shouldn’t have done it. She’d left a note, after all and her intentional disappearance indicated the need for solitude after all that had happened. He could understand that.
And between the Barton kids and Cassie Lang and now these two teenagers before him it was turning into a place he barely recognized.
There were others behind him but as the wind howled unforgivingly in the distance and the snow fell across a barren landscape and atop her eyelashes,
She thought of James Buchanan Barnes. Of the Winter Soldier.
“My father used to make being a king look so dignified. Even when I was just a young boy I would try so very hard to imitate him. To be the perfect son. To be the

Sometimes kids just had to experience the hard truths by themselves.
It was while he was sorting through his closet that his fingers stilled over an item of clothing hanging there amidst the jeans and jackets and plain t-shirts. His fingers hovered over the faded t-shirt, a generic SHIELD issue that had ‘ROGERS’ on the back. He’d worn it a lot a long time ago. Then at some point it had gotten mixed up in the laundry and he’d walked into Toni’s room a couple of weeks later to find her sitting on the bed wearing it. She’d been sleep-deprived and her hair a mess but the second he’d seen her in it he didn’t think he’d ever quite felt as if he’d been hit by a sixteen-wheeler as he did then.
“How’d you like an upgrade, KAREN?”
“You have been avoiding me,” she said, and it was a statement, not a question, unsurprised in its resignation.
Then again, it was probably presumptuous of him to ascribe gender to bots he’d just met.
But Stephen continued on, unaffected, yet entirely attuned to the extra level of tension in the room. “She believed that you and I were similar to the extent of our abilities. The execution is different, as I’m sure you’re already aware, but I believe with time and study, we’ll be able to get you back on the field, where you belong.” He smiled and it was kind and Toni was immensely grateful for it. “You’re quite the fighter. I look forward to working with you.”
“FRIDAY. Bring up everything we have so far about Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross.”
“Good. Because Rhodey aside there’s a whole load of other shit we’ve got to drag through. And I’ll need help with the heavy lifting. You up for it?”
Toni smiled and it was all teeth. “He’s such a busy man these days. We didn’t want to burden him further and thought, hey, why not go to the big man himself.”
Before he could respond, the glass door to the right slid open and a woman in white scrubs stepped into the hall. “We’re ready for you, Sergeant Barnes,” she said, hands clasped in front of her patiently.
And then they’d ripped it up out of the ground, roots and all.
, Nat might have mistakenly concluded were it not for the dangerous flash in her eyes.
stories.
“Prove it.”
“We’ll get a skeleton contract drafted up. Something similar to Scarlet Witch’s but you’re free to play with it as much as you like within reason.”
“Quite the opposite,” Vision remarked but Toni could hear the trace of a smile in his voice.
. You took him away from her and you do not
Her mouth snapped shut on the retort when she saw Ayo with T’Challa and Vision in tow, both of whom had come to a cautious stop next to Natasha and Okoye.
“Holding steady, Toni.”

to reassure him with. Which was perhaps the worst way to start this, this new beginning she’d been trying to frame it as. She had nothing to offer Peter, who was young and impressionable and so insightful that even she couldn’t get past him.
She felt her body burn, the heat searing her right down to what could only be the charred remains of her bones. She felt the ice of space put her back together again.
Toni likened Coulson’s interrogation of the HYDRA agent to a polished stone that cut a violently-rushing stream in half, right now the middle. He was consistent, patient to the point of frustration, and all the while that calm slope of a smile never left his features.
He’d conjured the mirror dimension around the entirety of the training room and Wanda’s magic crashed and exploded against it, casting vivid scarlet fractals across the floor and ceiling.
But after a tense moment, he too just shook his head and left the room, and Steve didn’t know whether to feel relieved or disappointed that Rhodey hadn’t asked him.
Cooper squinted at her, mouth twisting to the side in ponderance. With a final sniff and a rub to his nose that left it bright red, he nodded.
He opened his mouth to say something, then seemed to think better of it, looking at Vision instead.
She wasn’t on a farm. She didn’t have Laura or Cooper or Lila or Nathaniel. But she had this. She had

The red haze of rage retreated and after a moment he nodded. “Yeah. Wife n’ kids.”
“Of course, Laura,” FRIDAY said, sounding pleased.
Toni glared but it was mostly to herself. “It’s so not fine-”
if you like!
“Always,” Shuri chuckled with a determined grin. “How’s he looking?”
, wondering whether it was just wishful thinking or if it really was the remnants of her own unique scent still clinging to the t-shirt from the last time she’d worn it.
“Your friends,” T’Challa corrected with a gentleness that belied him. “Unless of course, we are so terrible a host, or even worse a country that we are unable to keep our very esteemed guest happy.”
Toni huffed and slumped in her seat. “This is very unfair. Shuri and I are just beginning our epic, science-fueled friendship of a lifetime and you want me to betray her trust.”
“—Barnes himself who told Rogers they had to come clean.”
Nat stood in the doorway, hesitating in a way he hadn’t seen her do in a while. After a second he motioned her over with a jerk of his head and she stepped into the room, leaving the door only slightly ajar.
She lifted one shoulder in a shrug. “You just did.”
It wasn’t anger, not at Bucky for going to see Toni or for not telling Steve about it. It was his arm, his surgery and his life. And after HYDRA had taken so much away from him already, he deserved - no - he had a
Leaning forward and clasping her hands together, she asked gently, “How
The image made him laugh out loud and even Toni cracked a small if fretful smile.
“Tell me your plan on bringing them back,” Laura repeated, pulling Toni towards the veranda, where cold lemonade and wicker chairs were waiting for them. “I want to know. And maybe I can help.”
. He’d been guiltily grateful when Shuri had given him the opportunity to get away from it all.
Toni had her hands pressed to the marble countertop as she took in choking breaths that hurt her lungs and made the arc reactor feel like a fireball in her chest.
“I do not know,” T’Challa informed them heavily, “when they intend to release a statement, nor what it will entail. I was not privy to that string of emails. But apparently once we had sent President Ellis and the Council our formal statements, they got through Captain Rogers’ one very rapidly. As well as,” he added slowly, “Sergeant Barnes’.”

He couldn’t stop.

He could see her smile, the arch of her brow, the dark brown of her eyes as she teased him.
“Perhaps,” he conceded without a trace of guilt. “But I do hope that...you will not be angry with her. If only because I too had my own part to play in finding you. And I utilized every single security measure necessary to ensure that no one would follow us here. To ensure that Mrs. Barton and her children would be safe.”
“Lady Hale,” he remarked with a with a winded wince. “Nice.”
“Thanks, honey.” She looked up at Vision and smiled ruefully. “Same time tonight? I’ve been itching to see how our new environmental controls are working on the tomatoes.”
“No, you’re not,” she agreed, surveying him head on, “but, if you want to, you could be. Regardless of what you choose, though, there will be conditions. For

“I just,” she began, then shrugged again. “I

“Your duty,” she immediately replied, as if it were obvious, as if it were the only thing that mattered. He supposed to her, a creation that had yet to know the human experience, it was the only thing that mattered.
She finally looked at him and though evidently concerned, he did manage a smile.
here, did you?”
There were reminders of Clint wherever she went. On her second day at the farm she found a pair of Clint’s gloves, the blue ones he’d worn when he’d accompanied her to one of her factory warehouses to hang out while she presented a new project to her mechanics.
And the only thing that really stood before Steve and Barnes was her.
There was also one other person she needed to speak to, someone who by mere association and endorsement would provide the necessary impetus to really make things happen the way she wanted them to.

Toni breathed out discreetly. Feeling her limbs flag. Two down, four more to go.
It was barely three seconds but it felt like a lifetime, something cold and hot and nuclear building inside of her chest, and something loud
“There are fan theories that she inherited magic from a witch or wizard somewhere down the family line. Sorcerers have an innate ability to be able to learn magic even if they don’t necessarily come from it. Like a prodigy, I guess.”
Their audience had quieted down to a dissatisfied simmer when they realized the installation was a go, much to Bucky’s relief, and there was only the occasional question or comment - mostly from Scott Lang who had walked in with Hope Van Dyne about a half hour in - that Vision seemed more inclined than Stark to answer.
And while everybody back in Wakanda has someone to compare you to, I don’t. And no one else here does. Maybe...maybe that makes our opinion matter more. The fact that all we know and see is
Wanda sent him a brief smile, then turned back to the TV. Sam had opted to cook tonight and Scott was helping him. The sound of them moving around the kitchen, snarking at one another, made him think of another kitchen at a time that felt so long ago but was really only
“Are you okay, Toni?” she asked, sounding genuinely concerned.
. And he had to believe that she knew what she was doing. He owed her that much. And so much more.
“You took your time.”
He wanted to look. He wanted to turn and look so badly, to see the expression on her face, to gauge her body language and analyze each and every nuance of her voice in that one, single word.
Laura pursed her lips. “Clint do any of it?”
the new face of the Avengers? The new team after Captain America and the rest of the Rogue Avengers left?”
“You’re very talkative today,” he shot back.
“Well, for starters you might wanna put some pants and shoes on the next time you walk out here at night. It can get a bit nippy.”
Whether it was patience or the uncertainty that maybe she’d retracted her offer, Barnes didn’t say anything to fill the silence. He didn’t probe, he didn’t coerce and he didn’t voice the question that was undoubtedly burning in the pit of his throat. She’d
Also Stephen! I said I would and I did. Because honestly, how could I possibly leave this wonderful man out when I have so many plans for him? And after that swoon-worthy wink in IW? God, yes.
He nodded because Toni’s speech had caused the biggest stir since Captain America defied a hundred and seventeen countries over his best friend Bucky Barnes. The incident, and Toni’s disappearance for a whole month, had given him a whole load of feelings and Happy’s reluctance and the way his voice got all shaky and emotional whenever he tried to extract anything, anything

He grunted, shaking his head and trying to sit up. “No, n-no doc- They’ll know-”
Then she turned and walked away without waiting for his response and even she had she wouldn’t have been able to hear anything over the chorus in her head that echoed louder and louder with every step down that long, white, sterile corridor.
Stark seemed to hang on his every word like a lifeline. He didn’t know her but somehow he was glad she had Colonel Rhodes on her side.
prior expectations about what her lab might look and feel like. HYDRA’s had always been dimly lit with just enough spotlights that the doctors, scientists and guards liked to shine into the face of whoever their subject was for the day. As far as intimidation tactics went it was still effective and played into a psyche full of cinematic scenes of torture, wet, grimy walls and screams echoing in from behind metal doors with tiny square windows.
