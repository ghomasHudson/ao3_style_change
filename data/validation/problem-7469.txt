"Well, you look terrified, like you've seen a ghost," Steve said. He tipped Tony's chin up, trying to meet his eyes. "Can you tell me what's got you so scared?"
"Thank you, Colonel," said Steve. He offered him a salute, which James reluctantly returned. "Please—"
were the first words that he'd ever heard Papa say to him, after he'd brought him back from the dead in the middle of the desert. Dad had told Peter later on that Papa had been begging Peter to breathe before that, but Peter didn't remember it. Just like he didn't remember most of Dad's panicked freakout before Papa got there.
"No! You can't have me!" screamed Image Peter as the sceptre flashed, with Peter joining in from the bed less than a second later. Tony flinched in Steve's arms, scrabbling against his chest as Steve tried to cover his ears.
“Yes, sir,” replied JARVIS, a bit too warily for Tony’s taste.  “However, I feel I must point out that since you have not made any changes to the structure in the last several hours, I cannot fathom why the result from yet another simulation would be any different.”
"I'm sure it wouldn't be the first time," Steve answered. With a final squeeze, he raised his arm and sat up, helping Tony off the bed.
to save.
"Yeah… probably."
"Hey guys!" Liz said. "I should've asked you this before you all left, but I'm having a party this Friday night and I was wondering if you wanted to come? It's not gonna be anything too fancy, just the Decathlon team and some other people from my class. There'll be pizza and chips and pop and stuff… anyway. You're all welcome to come if you want."
"Oh God, Steve, I'm gonna—
Tony glanced up at Peter, who gave an almost imperceptible shake of his head. Just as Tony had feared, Steve was too badly injured to just head back to the Tower.
And in world-record time, even!
The document continued on for several pages, spouting more nonsense about HYDRA's philosophy of total world order through what basically amounted to controlled chaos, the same type of rhetoric that Dad, Papa, Uncle Sam, and Auntie Nat had found hidden in the old SHIELD bunker up at Camp Lehigh that had housed Zola's consciousness.
He didn't finish his statement, but Steve got his point anyway. Tony was a visual person. He needed to see with his own eyes that Peter was still alive, and Steve couldn't blame him. Not when almost his entire adult life had been dictated by people who had only wanted to use his son's illness as a weapon to keep him in line.
As always, I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
"I said, Thanos is using the Chitauri as his own personal shields," Tony repeated. "Which means—"
"Yeah, well, things are a bit different now than they were back in the forties," Uncle James said. "Besides, this is probably one of those dates that isn't really a date-date because if it turns out that they don't like each other as much as they thought they did, then they can just say it was a friends-date instead of a date-date and be done with it."
"Steve," Tony started, but Steve pressed his fingertips to his lips, cutting him off.
Tony gasped as he brought Steve's left palm to his chest, splaying it across the kaleidoscope of scars covering his heart. "It's okay, baby. I'm right here."
"I'm just saying. Just 'cause were both in relationships now doesn't mean that we can't still hang out," Ned continued. "I mean, we could even go on a double-date sometime, I'm sure Betty and Gwen wouldn't mind."
"Do the diagnostic first, J, yeah? Make sure there's nothing funky before the assembly."
"Oh, gods, I hope he hasn't," Tony rushed out. "'Cause I'm pretty sure, no, I'm actually
"Steve—" Tony whimpered. "Honey—"
Gamora suddenly shrieked, causing both Steve and Alt-Steve to jump so high they nearly hit the stratosphere. Because it wasn't Peter who had just stepped through the circle. Or at least, not his—
It happened as if in slow motion.  The way the backpack swung around Peter’s body, swiping across the end cap display and knocking three of the books loose from the shelf.  Steve’s stomach dropped to his knees as he lunged forward, trying to cross the remaining distance before they had a chance to hit the floor.
"How is Pete doing, by the way?" asked Tony. "Any chance we could get him on the phone here so he could talk to Steve?"
Somehow, though, DNA testing proved the claim to be true, and once again Tony's entire life was turned on its head.
Even though he had absolutely no idea
Tony scoffed, fighting against the almost overwhelming urge to scream. He was so exhausted that he was starting to smell colours, but despite Rhodey, Carol, Sam, and even Phillips himself telling him to take a break—"just fifteen minutes, Tony, please?"—there was no way in hell that he could possibly relax enough to rest.
If Tony’s making noise, then that must mean he’s alive.  And if he’s alive, then Steve must still be alive too, which means that what he heard might actually be real and not just inside his head.
Tony's head snapped back in surprise, and he gave it a hard shake, crying to clear it. "Wait, you saw…
"But, Dad, will you please just listen to me!" cried Peter. "I was gonna go home, but then I thought about you and then I just kinda stuck to the side of the ship!"
Tony smirked towards the ceiling. "What do you think?"
But despite the cold—and the accompanying lack of a warm, sandy beach—Tony had to admit that the trip had been one of Steve's better ideas. December had been a busy month, filled with local and regional Decathlon competitions, a holiday dance at school—which Steve had been thrilled about, since he'd missed the last one thanks to HYDRA—more weekend training sessions, and Christmas, which the team had all spent up at the Compound, just as they had for Thanksgiving. Memories of the fiasco that had been the team's Christmas morning gift-giving still made Tony both smile and shake his head. It was amazing to him how a group of adults—and three teenagers—could instantly transform into a bunch of over-excited schoolchildren at the mere sight of a massive Christmas tree piled high with brightly-wrapped gifts.
Peter gave a nod, readying his pencil.
"Copy that," replied Sam as James immediately ran for the jet, blasting back out a few seconds later in his brand-new War Machine armour.
Just like Grandpa.
"Tony—!"
"Um, it is okay if I watch the game with them, isn't it?" Peter asked gingerly once Uncle Sam was out of earshot. "I don't have any homework since tomorrow's the last day of school."
"So, um… I've got all of the simulator protocols done," Tony said, handing Phillips the pile of papers. "Long as you don't see any issues they should be good to go."
"Good," replied Sam. "When?"
he thought, his immediate reaction being that there could be no possible way that this Doctor List person was telling the truth.
"Yes, I'm sure you did." Papa finished spreading the shredded cheese across the first pizza, popping a few pieces into his mouth. "Now, let's get these pizzas into the ovens before Thor ends up eating our entire supply of peanut butter, okay?"
Steve's heart immediately jumped into his throat. "What? Tony, no,
"I'm looking forward to it, sir," answered JARVIS. "Based on the preliminary designs already included by Master Peter, I am currently estimating no issues with either the satellites or the containment vessel."
"Peter!" Papa screamed as Peter felt his eyes roll back into his head, his frozen hands slipping from their hold on the ship as all the remaining air in his lungs dissipated in one fell swoop, and everything went dark.
"O-kay, well…" Tony trailed off, still thinking. "You're right that I haven't had the pleasure of personally fighting against Thanos," he continued. "But Pete and I have fought against two of his lackeys, and I know someone else who went up against him one-on-one and lived to tell the tale. And I really think if we all worked together, we could do it. But we'd have to all be on the exact same page the whole time, which means no winging it."
welcome'.
Since the aircraft were arranged in three groups of two Steve and Carol were the first to roll out onto the runway. As soon as they had both cleared the hangar Steve eased back, allowing Carol to go in front of him.
"Which means as of 1354 hours yesterday, I'm technically a civilian," said Bucky. "They even told me that they already cleaned out my room, said I could pick up my belongings once I got out." He glanced up at Sam. "Good thing I had most of my stuff at Sam's, or who the hell knows where it would've ended up."
for soundproofing!—it never was while they were sleeping, so Peter could hear Papa's shouts and screams of terror when the nightmares hit almost every single time.
“Thanks for getting off early today, Dad,” Peter says once they're on their way.  “I really appreciate it.”
"I'm pretty sure I don't want to know," Pepper said with wide eyes. "I'll just be waiting for your call."
"Well, as long as he makes you happy, Dad," said Peter. "And I don't need any details about how he does it, just in case you were wondering."
“Either that, or it’s a pretty weird coincidence,” answers Natasha.  “But given what else I’ve read about Howard Stark, I wouldn't put it past him.  The guy seems real nice, if you know what I mean.”
"Hell no!" shouted Tony, wincing when Steve startled in his arms. "There's no way I can be sure, because a split-second later I saw that my kid had just up and disappeared! But you cannot tell me that what happened out there was just some kind of natural phenomenon, 'cause that's just a bunch of bullshit!"
Steve shook his head. "I don't think that—"
"My dads taught me to respect authority that deserves respect. And that Nazis are the lowest form of evil imaginable," Peter retorted, noticing that the red-haired girl gave a very obvious flinch at the word Nazi, almost like it physically pained her. "I guess we should've figured it out sooner that it'd be you who would choose to sink that low."
Which it was.
The proverbial other shoe, so to speak.
he thought.

"Dad?" Peter finally said, his voice so small and weak that Tony had to squeeze his eyes closed.
Emoji Key for those who don't know what to say in the comments!
"Thanks," Peter said. He twisted to avoid a student's swinging backpack, then barely a second later ducked underneath another student's flailing arm at the same time as he pulled Gwen around a third, who was for whatever reason choosing to walk backwards.
"Your heart, Tony," Steve said, his tongue poking out to wet his perfect pink lips. "It sounds like it's racing, are you all right?"
Whew! 😊
Howard Stark had apparently helped to create the very serum that had not only saved Steve's life, but had also enabled him to become the top-notch pilot that he was. In addition to his enhanced height, strength, agility, and senses, Steve's reflexes were also much faster than normal, a trait that had turned out to be very useful during a dogfight.
"Mmm. Fine."
"Is breá limo an oiread sin," Steve whispered. "I love you so much, sweetheart, tell me what you want. Inis dom conas is féidir liom tú a shásamh."
"Oh, I don't know," said Steve. "What do you feel like drawing? More of the adventures of Mrs Bird?"
"Steve?" Sam said, snapping his fingers in front of Steve's nose. "Did we lose ya there?"
"Well, now
"Yes, sir. Sorry, sir," Steve said automatically as he stood to attention, offering a salute that Colonel Phillips nodded away with a barely-suppressed eyeroll. "It won't happen again."
"Thereby keeping a constant flow of energy to each satellite, which would then be channeled into the various power plants," Tony finished. He tilted his head, rereading Peter's notes in amazement.
"Against
of him, which is exactly what we could do if we—"
“And I’m pretty sure it’s not as gutsy as being forced to confront the man who should’ve loved you like a father,” Steve said firmly.  “So how ‘bout we just acknowledge that we’re both gonna feel a lot better once this is all over, and leave it at that.”
“Yeah, it’s okay with me,” says Dad.  “The kid’s been chomping at the bit all day to show off for ya.”
he thought bitterly. Even if it did turn out to be something innocuous, Tony knew Steve wasn't going to be able to let it go for a while.
If they were able to make it home, that is. At this rate, the only thing keeping Tony from pouncing on Steve as soon as they got back to the car was how mad Pepper would be if they got caught.
“Dad, this was all Obie’s doing,” Peter said.  “He made the deal with Justin Hammer to have Regina start working for Stark Industries so they’d have an easy way to send information back and forth, but then… after you and her were—”
—to some gigantic invading space army may have seemed a bit far fetched, but Steve had seen way too many far fetched things come to life since he'd crashed the
they'd pulled out Loki's sceptre and tried to turn his brain into scrambled eggs.
He was cut off by a nurse entering the room.
. Then SHIELD would've never gotten their hands on it, and tried to mess with it, which is what drew the Chitauri to Earth in the first place, and—
"All right," Tony said as he inhaled a deep, shaky breath, patting Peter's back. "As you've probably figured out by now, we've got a situation down there. Can you think of a plan?"
Steve's heart thudded as he climbed inside his cockpit and fitted his earpiece over his ear, from both excitement and nerves. He had been debating with himself almost nonstop for the last couple days if he should just bite the bullet and ask Anthony out on a date, or if he should confess that he had been visiting with Anthony's son at the hospital first and
"Bruce?" he said, low and even. "Did you catch all of that?"
"All right. I want you to circle around and get behind Sam. Pietro, I need you to be watching the skies. If you see any debris looking like it's heading for one of our teammates, you get them the hell out of the way, okay?"
"It's definitely a long shot," Tony said after a short pause. "And I'm not even sure if we should attempt it, 'cause if it doesn't work then we'll probably wind up with even bigger problems than we've already got, but—"
"Have a nice day, Mr Lang," Tony said, effectively ending the conversation. As soon as Lang disappeared with the guard, Tony slumped against Steve's side, closing his eyes as Steve's arm wrapped around his shoulders.
But there in that moment, standing face to face with a man he'd always despised but never thought as anything more than a bothersome troublemaker, Tony had to admit that there was no way he would've been able to hide the massive cauldron of emotions threatening to boil over. By aligning himself with HYDRA, Justin Hammer had literally sold his soul to the devil, and was therefore complicit in every single thing that HYDRA had done since Project Insight.
And then there's the reality that despite his extensive background in swimming and his study of all of the best training techniques, and his experience with said techniques, Steve has never mentioned the possibility of becoming a swim coach.  He’s never talked about it, not with his friends and teammates, not in interviews.  He’s never even mentioned it in passing where it might’ve been overheard somewhere.
“Hey, Uncle James!” Peter said, waving furiously.  “Who’s your new friend?”
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!" Bucky said with wide eyes. "Just hold on a minute. I thought you had another date with him just last night?"
Swallowing hard, Tony turned back to Gamora, now sobbing on her knees over Quill's ashes. Clutching Peter impossibly tighter, he took one step towards her, halted in his tracks when Peter sucked in a sharp breath.
"Where's Fury?" she asked in a low voice.
“No, I’m not.”  Slowly, Steve takes the bottle from Tony, placing it on the floor.  Then he cradles Tony’s hand between his own, trailing his thumb across his knuckles.
"Mmm," Tony grumbled, pursing his lips as he made one final adjustment to the compass. Then he stepped back, looking Steve up and down. "Well, I gotta say that you do make one fine-looking time-traveller, hon. Probably the finest I've ever seen."
"Yeah, that was our impression of him as well," said Steve. "He tried to teach a class for us a couple years ago, and it just—well, let's just say that I probably could've taught it better."
"That's good, hon. That's real good," he said. "I… um…"
" Peter said firmly. "You didn't know what you were doing, I know it. I know it because I saw it through both your eyes
That was the theory, anyway.  But for someone like Papa, who literally could not forget anything, if it worked, it could potentially be life-saving.  While Papa hadn't had any of his really bad PTSD episodes since he started working with Uncle Sam, he still had flashbacks every now and then.  Times when a certain sound or a smell or something would cause him to freeze, and he’d have to hold onto the back of a chair or curl into a tight ball on the floor until he was able to squash the bad memories back down again.
"He's gonna be a charmer, Stevie," said Bucky. "You and Tony better watch it."
Out of the corner of his eye, Steve saw Tony frown. "Um… I thought I'd been assigned to work with Bruce this morning? Something about the funky space lights over Wakanda last night?"
"Oh, Papa, this is so yummy!" he said after he'd swallowed his first steaming spoonful. "Dad's gonna love it, it's so much better than the store-bought stuff!"
"You said we could wait somewhere nearby, once we drop him off?" Steve finally said, sounding very much like a little boy instead of the over six-feet tall, strong, strapping man that he was.
"Reacquisition of signal in five seconds, sir," JARVIS cut in. "Four… three… two… one…"
The sound of the flipping switch echoed throughout the vast basement laboratory, causing Tony to jump as the blue solution began flowing into Peter's arms, legs, and torso. Steve grunted, his fingers tightening around Tony's as he recalled the feel of the freezing-cold liquid burning its way throughout his body, following the paths of his main muscle fibres.
"Yeah, they got back into town a couple hours ago."
"Yeah, I do," Uncle Bucky said. He moved one of his knights, taking Peter's bishop with a triumphant smile. "And especially Стив. Тони has been with you since you were born but Стив hasn't, so it's maybe a bit harder for him. He never knew his own papa, and then his ma died when he was eighteen, and… he never thought he'd be able to have a family, so…"
So who's to say he wouldn't just do it again, and kill even more people?
Instead of replying, Steve captured Tony's lips again, kissing him so hard and so deeply that Tony was panting by the time they broke apart.
"Whatever," Dad grumbled.
Thankfully Sam took the hint, changing the topic to the upcoming baseball series between the two most winning teams in the country. Having grown up adoring pretty much anything that had to do with baseball, Steve threw himself into the conversation with abandon, grateful to get his mind off of the Stark family for at least a few minutes.
"Ahahaha!" Steve heard from behind him, turning in a daze to find Bruce poking his head up out of his armour, laughing maniacally. "You guys are so screwed now!"
"Hmph," Dr Strange said, scowling as he turned on his heel. "Let me know when we're close to landing."
“So… tell me again how you found this guy?” Dad says as he turns onto the street that leads to Empire State University.  The street is lined with colourful row houses that have to be at least a hundred years old, something that Peter finds almost as cool as the fact that in only a few short minutes, he's going to get to meet a real-life Olympic gold medalist.
"Very well, position sent."
Although, now that Peter thought about it, if it had, it might've helped ease Dad's twitchiness a bit. Not knowing where the phenomenon came from was one of the main things that kept Dad pacing trails in the hallways in the middle of the night. And Papa too, by proxy.
“All right, little guy,” Papa said softly.  He sucked in a deep breath and glanced over at Dad, who gave him an encouraging nod.  “Let’s do this.”
“Which is exactly what I’m trying to tell you—” she continued.
Steve scoffed, releasing Bruce so harshly that he stumbled backwards, nearly tripping over a piece of a fender that had broken off a car. He bent over, his palms on his knees as he tried to force his muddled brain to work.
"You—" Tony started, shaking his head to try and clear it. "You can
—ago, and now, Steve would've given just about anything to know with absolute certainty that both he and Tony were okay.
"I will begin immediately, Captain," JARVIS answered.
"Lorne here."
“Of course it is!” Tony rasped.  “Good God, Steve, did you honestly think I’d say no?”
"Is the line secure, J?" Tony asked as he set down the pair of glasses he'd been working with and rubbed at his temples. He'd managed to keep the headache that'd been plaguing him ever since the night before to a dull minimum since he and Rhodey arrived in D.C., but it was still there, just simmering beneath the surface, and no amount of coffee seemed to be able to quash it.
"Very good, sir."
Which would just happen to put him under the current world record of 47.55.
"I am still placing Master Peter's current location at the school, sir," replied JARVIS. "If I remember correctly, they are due to leave in approximately forty-five minutes."
“Yeah, sure.”  Tony idly sipped his coffee as JARVIS went to work decrypting the file, trying like hell to not think about what Steve might be doing at that moment.
Steve tilted his head, looking up at him with pleading blue eyes that were already starting to darken. "I'm not ready to go to sleep yet," he said as he slid his hand up Tony's bare arm to his neck, tugging him closer so he could kiss him. Tony whimpered as Steve deepened the kiss, shifting them so Tony was once again lying underneath him. He should've known that Steve would need more help calming down that just a few chaste kisses and murmured words.
"Goddamnit," he grumbled as he shook the scorching hot droplets from his fingers. He grabbed an oil-stained towel from a shelf, mopping up the rest of the spill before it could destroy the rest of Bruce's papers, even though they were already littered with so many coffee stains that he probably wouldn't've even noticed more of them.
"'Kay. See ya."
"No, don't try and give me that, I know you too well." Tony reached for Steve's hand, brushing his fingertips across his knuckles. "Tell me what you're worried about."
"It's all right," Tony cut in. "It's… actually good that I know about what's going on, 'cause… well…"
A bolt of pleasure shot down Tony's spine at Steve's words, and the way his lips tickled the sensitive shell of his ear. He tilted his head up to meet Steve's mouth in a firm kiss, whimpering when Steve's tongue swiped across his bottom lip just before he pulled away.
he rasped as he saw what appeared to be a massive circular-shaped spaceship hovering in the air over some buildings, about twenty or so blocks away.
"How's he doing?" Tony blurted out, tipping into Steve as soon as the words left his mouth. "My boy, how's—how's—?"
"Beat Thanos," Peter finished, nodding against Dad's chest. He pulled back, looking directly into his papa's eyes. "Please, don't send me away. I wanna fight."
"I'll make sure that he does," said Tony. He offered Sam his hand, which Sam gratefully took. "I can be pretty persuasive when I want to be."
It wasn't until Peter had reached the last few paragraphs of the file that he got his answer.
"Okay Control, JARVIS says I'm three minutes away from my go/no-go point," Steve said. "I'm running my final calculations now."
"Oh gods, Pete, you really did it," Tony whispered as he swiped at his eyes. "You really brought him back to life."
"Steve, I can't—he's gonna—!"
And, dare Steve say, more than a bit smitten with a certain other teammate, despite his repeated assurances back before the war that he was only interested in the gals.
"It's pretty much always safe to assume that that kid's forgotten something or other," Tony muttered. "Tell him I'll take care of it, yeah?"
Steve smiled as he tore off a piece of his bread, dipping it into the rich tomato sauce in the pasta. "I'm not perfect, Tony."
“Yeesh,” Tony said with a shudder.
me, hmm?"
"So, as far as we know, General O'Brien believes that Project Phoenix is still an orbital defence system, which is how it was originally designed and presented to the government," Steve began. "Tony built the tesseract container in secret, and it's currently being guarded by people who've been assigned by Colonel Phillips. On the morning of the mission, Colonel Phillips will oversee the loading of the tesseract into my X-302, after which the eight Phoenix satellites will be mounted on both mine and Carol's aircraft."
"No, shit," Steve heard Clint reply as the Wakandans in the front line activated their rectangular handheld shields. "Damn. That's pretty cold."
"Mmm," Tony muttered. "Must've been nice."
"And we will," Dad stated. "The only thing I require is that Pete needs to stay close to me. We know how to work together, and I need to keep an eye on him."
"Yeah, I know," Peter said as he finally found a tree tall enough to launch one of his webs, smiling under the mask at the awesome
"That would increase the suit's weight-bearing capacity by fifteen percent," said JARVIS.
"Pete? It's gonna be okay, buddy, I'll make sure of it," Tony said as he ran his fingers through Peter's downy-soft curls. He quickly pressed his lips to Peter's forehead, his belly swooping at his frigid temperature. "I'll be right back, okay?
And Tony also knew that Steve was stubborn enough to actually do it. He just hoped that Steve didn't wind up eliminating himself in the process.
"No, I did not," Steve said firmly. He didn't add that it was he who had asked Shuri to keep Tony for an extra day or so, just to be triply sure that he was all right. "Now, please try and rest some more, okay?"
"I wouldn't hear of anything else, Mr Wilson," Stacy said proudly. "And I would appreciate the agents' help if they don't mind."
"Yeah, that sounds reasonable," Dad said, his hand firmly on Peter's shoulder. "Then we'll all converse on your signal."
Tony nods into Steve’s chest, letting out a soft chuckle.  “Well.  Guess I should’ve asked you about that a long time ago, yeah?”
unusual for someone to have to alter code in order to do so, which likely meant…
"Just wondering," Peter said with a shrug. "Is there anything I can do to help?"
They were quiet for several minutes, so much so that Tony almost felt himself drifting off to sleep until Bruce suddenly let out a loud noise, somewhere between a whoop and a yelp. Steve instantly was on his feet, practically vibrating as he held out his hand to help Tony up.
"Okay, but what exactly do you mean by semi-renewable?" asked Bucky.
"Very good, sir. Estimated time of completion for render and assembly is six hours."
"Nope. Shouldn't hurt a bit," Dad said as he came back to the centre of the lab. "JARVIS, whenever you're ready."
"Steve—!"
"Pete, not yet," Dad whispered. "Stand by."
"Are you saying you've had this here the whole time?" demanded Sam.
are you talking about?"
Tony's heart stuttered at the mention of his father, his fingers tightening around the air canister. "Yeah, Steve's told me that story," he said shortly. "You remember it, eh?"
Peter's left arm was tingling with pins and needles as he snuck another glance up at the clock, his heart quickening when he saw that he only had forty-five seconds left before the bell rang. His right foot started tapping on its own volition as he counted down the rest of the seconds, bracing himself for the shrill ring of the bell.
"Yeah, it's okay."
"Ah, but you mean normal human consumption, right JARVIS?" Sam said, laughing as he clapped Bucky on the shoulder. "'Cause I'm pretty sure the rest of these guys could eat just about anything and it wouldn't kill 'em."
stuff to worry about.
sure?" he asked, quirking his eyebrow into what he hoped was a pleading look rather than whiny. He shimmied his hand down between their bodies to curl around Steve's cock, the loud moan that rumbled up from Steve's chest sending a ripple of pleasure down Tony's spine. "Seems like you could use a hand here or something, so…"
Steve was in the middle of rinsing his hair when the idea hit him, nearly causing him to get soap in his eyes in his haste to finish. He quickly towelled off, pulling on his clothes so hurriedly that he almost exited the locker room with his t-shirt on backwards.
"You mean, these could make me as small as a real spider?" Peter asked once they were home, his pure, boyish delight warming Tony's heart like a heater as he studied the vial of reddish-pink dots. "Dad, that's so cool!"
But still…
and not just to me.  I know Bucky’s gonna be able to sleep so much better at night too, and—”
"I am insulted that you could possibly believe that I could even make such a grievous mistake, sir," JARVIS said, with such petulance that a sharp pang of nostalgia shot through Tony. He could just picture the look of disgust on Edwin Jarvis's face as he said the exact same thing.
"Try and sleep now, bud," Dad murmured as he kissed Peter's forehead. "You'll feel better in the morning."
Papa always said that he didn't believe in coincidences, and lately, neither did Peter.
lie about that stuff. He's just not capable of it."
"I wish you could, honey," Tony cut in. "But since Damage Control is a government operation and you're not an official part of it, the Armed Forces Committee probably wouldn't accept the help even if they wanted to."
And the very moment the tip of his wing tripped that invisible barrier, the enemy's automated anti-aircraft defence system kicked in and he was immediately taken out, the resulting fireball so blinding that Steve almost flew head-on into Sam before he was able to recover.
“Who says I’m gonna die?” Steve replied, biting back another gasp of pain.  It wasn’t a retort that was completely without backing.  While he knew that he wasn’t immortal, the studies the SSR had completed on his body mechanics after the serum combined with the numerous physicals and tests he’d had since he was found in the ice, there did seem to be a general consensus that barring any severe, non-healable injury, his life would be a long one.  He couldn’t get sick, at least not with any current or formerly existing pathogens, and any injuries he sustained usually healed within a few hours, with the few broken bones he had experienced healing in a couple of days.
Even though Papa would never want Peter to miss out on something because of him, as Dad had said when Peter brought up the subject a few nights ago, especially since it would mean disappointing Gwen as well. And while Peter knew that Dad was right, it still didn't help him feel any better about it.
"That must've been at the theatre," Peter mumbled, his heart thudding madly. He shivered, burrowing down even further into his blankets as he kept reading, trying to figure out why in the hell HYDRA was sending all these semi-enhanced people specifically after him.
"So… you're thinking that they just need to take out the opposition first?" asked Peter.
Steve instinctively frowned. Something about that didn't exactly sit well with him.
"It's gonna be okay, mo grá," Steve murmured into Tony's ear. "We'll figure it out together."
"Awesome!" Peter exclaimed, his stomach already rumbling at the prospect. He hadn't yet figured out how Papa managed to take the most basic of dishes and make them taste incredible, but he wasn't about to complain about it. Papa's mac and cheese was almost considered legendary amongst the occupants of Avengers' Tower, and his french bread wasn't too far off either.
"Huh?" both Peter and Uncle Bucky said simultaneously.
"Is Thanos in Wakanda?" asked Drax.
"Care to share what you would call it with the rest of the class?"
"Стиви!" Bucky yelled again, his voice now laced with the very same panic that was threatening to pull Steve under, holding him under the freezing cold water until all of the air was pushed out of his lungs, and he had no choice but to give in.
"Peter, it's okay," Papa said soothingly as he drew him to his side. "Whatever it is, we'll be ready."
Grabbing another handful of m&ms, Peter shoved them into his mouth and selected the next file, breathing out slowly as he allowed his eyes to relax into their panoramic state so he could decipher it. He was so engrossed in his work that he didn't even notice Dad coming into his room until he sat down on the bed, nearly causing Peter to jump out of his skin.
Which meant that—
"Thirty seconds to deploy," Steve said over the comm. "Readings indicate that everything looks good from up here, Tony, can you confirm?"
"Yes, Steve, as in
"Yeah," Steve whispered. He hadn't quite thought about it like that. "Yeah, I can."
"Good idea, Colonel," Steve said with a nod. "So—"
grins. "Speaking of it, though, there's something I was gonna ask you about it."
"Ehh, actually I'm thinking it might be better for either Tony or myself to go in first," Bruce said. "That way if we sense an issue once we're inside we can make on-the-fly changes to the GPS."
"So, how's it going out there, Bruce?" Natasha asked over the comm a few seconds later. "You getting the hang of things?"
"Damn." Tony pinched the bridge of his nose, cursing the three tons of intense fatigue that had taken up residence across his shoulders, fatigue that hadn't budged since HYDRA ripped Steve away from him.
“At your service, sir.”
And why wasn't there a term for it? There was a term—widower or widow—for the loss of a spouse, so why not for the loss of a child?
"Okay, let's just all try and calm down a bit here," Steve said, holding up his hands. "We don't know where Fury is. This device was found in the street a few days ago, bearing this symbol."
was—no matter what, was still enough to relax some of the iron-rod tension in his limbs, and despite his churning mind, he found himself actually starting to drift off.
"Such a gentleman," Carol said with a smirk as she stepped forward, grinning at Colonel Rhodes as he held the door open for her. "Good thing I'm surrounded by 'em."
Taking his time, Tony explored and kissed all across Steve's glorious chest and abs, finally popping the button on his jeans when he felt Steve's fingertips digging into his shoulders. He licked his lips as he slid Steve's pants and underwear down his legs, pausing for a second to take him in.
"The point is that we can still keep this from happening to anyone else," Peter said, as firmly as he was able. His chest was feeling tight again, and the last thing he wanted was for his heart monitor to start beeping and get Dad even more worried.
"Oh yeah?" said Tattooed Guy, his skin the color of those silver pokey things the alien had been using earlier on Doctor Strange. "Well, what if we don't feel like being polite!"
Tony shook his head, tears spilling down his cheeks as he leaned in to press his lips to Steve's, whose eyelids were barely still open. The pain medicine must've affected him more than Helen originally thought. "I'm not going anywhere. I
most beautiful man that Steve had ever had the honour to lay his eyes upon…
Rolling his eyes, Peter slumped forward, resting his chin in his hand as the teacher began her lecture and trying not to think about
As to what exactly Peter believed that might be, Tony could only guess. And since he didn't really have the time to be guessing at the moment, Tony supposed that a deeper dive was going to have to wait until after they won the battle.
"You okay, buddy?"
"So… how's Captain Rogers doing?" Phillips said, rather slyly. "Seems like you two have gotten to be pretty close recently."
Tony tapped his chin as he studied the hologram floating in front of him, tilting his head as he made a small adjustment to one of the compositing mechanisms.  Obie had finally left for the day after Tony had literally pushed him out of his office, freeing him to put the finishing touches on the design he’d used to lure all of the pharmaceutical scientists back to the company.
"Yeah, yeah."
"We'll see, buddy, okay?" Dad said with a sigh. "Papa's a bit concerned about what could be hiding in it, and you already have to keep so many secrets that we just don't wanna push it too much, yeah?"
Tony gave a single nod. "I love you too, babe. 'Cept now we have to get cleaned up before we end up getting stuck together."
"Gods, Steve, it's not that big of a deal," he said once Steve could breathe again. "Don't need to be such a drama queen about it."
Tears pricked Steve's eyes, both from worry and from how upset Tony seemed to be. Like he was furious that Steve had the nerve to be worried about him.
He was cut off by the emergency vehicle as it pulled up just off to the side of the runway, the medics readying their stretcher as Steve's aircraft grew closer.
"And so do you," said Tony. "Don't be forgetting about yourself there."
"Don't I know it," Sam said happily. "Even if he does get pouty when he loses at chess."
"Holy
"Including the boots?" Tony asked.
"I'll tune us in to the government's emergency channel," he said as Steve fired up the engines. "Hopefully they'll know something that's helpful."
"Okay, but…" Peter couldn't help it; he just had to ask. "Um… do you know if Gwen's okay? She's not—she didn't get hurt, did she?"
—even after all that time only proved that O'Brien had been an absolute fool for grounding him in the first place.
"Oh," Papa said as he poured some dry linguine noodles into the pan of boiling water on the stove and started shredding a massive block of mozzarella cheese. "Well, make sure and let me know if you need any help with your History tonight, okay?"
Even though Peter highly doubted that he would find one. This was HYDRA. They had practically invented loopholes, plus they had the President, most of the Senate, and at least some of the FBI on their side.
he thought, blinking as the nanites in his left uniform sleeve quickly reformed into a near-perfect rendition of his shield, complete with a white star in the centre. He immediately raised his arm, wincing as remnants of the target Bucky destroyed rained down onto it.
"There," he said as the soldier fell to the floor of the tank, dead. "Pretty sure that's everyone."
"Nah, just tired," Peter answered, rubbing his temples. "I met the new girl, she's in the Academic Decathlon with us too."
"Who wants to murder trillions," added Dr Strange.
"Oh God," Peter gasped, his belly giving a violent swoop as he realised on second thought that no, they were not the same kind of sentry suits that had been circling the prison's perimeter. Instead, the suits now standing at attention in front of Peter's window had all been outfitted with Chitauri tech stolen from the Department of Damage Control, which Peter feared meant that they were pretty much indestructible.
he thought, almost defiantly.
Peter buried his face into his polar bear, trying to ignore the fact that his glasses were pressing uncomfortably into the sides of his nose as he debated on what to do with this new information. If he showed it to his dads it would only make them even more determined to send him away, and that was the absolute last thing that he wanted. Like it or not, if things continued to progress the way that Papa feared they might, the team was going to need all the help they could get for the conflict that was sure to follow.
Thankfully, Mags chooses that moment to appear with their food, covering their small table with plates of pizza and baskets of breadsticks and dipping sauce, along with cups of Dr Pepper and water.  Apparently already basking in his so-called triumph, Peter decides to change the subject, talking a mile a minute about the project he and Ned are working on in chemistry while they eat.  By the time there’s nothing but crumbs remaining, Tony is certain that his beloved son is either going to change the entire world with his chemistry experiments, or cause it to explode.
Peter demanded, wishing so badly that he could stomp his foot. He was fully aware that he was in full-blown tantrum mode now, but he was so
"Not tonight? What the hell do you mean—?"
How could

"Ah, yeah?" answered Peter. "Why wouldn't they be?"

His boy really did spread joy and happiness wherever he went.  It was like he was the human incarnation of a double rainbow.
Which meant that Tony needed to find a way to make sure there wasn't a next time, and he needed to do it as soon as possible, while the odds were still tipped in their favour. Because while he knew that Toomes' arrest would buy them a small amount of good will, the Avengers were still on the shit list of a vast majority of the newly elected politicians, and Tony had a strong feeling that they were looking for any possible excuse to go after them.
"It's okay, Tony, I can drive you both to the hospital," Colonel Rhodes said as he suddenly appeared next to them. Steve apparently
Tony gave his head a hard shake, trying to find some shred of sense in the nonsense conversation and failing completely. "Oh, well, then I'd say that'd be pretty good practise for fighting against Thanos, don't you think?"
“I—I h-hurt him!” Steve suddenly cried, curling impossibly tighter.  “T-Tony, I
"Pretty sure that's
"Huh?" Uncle Bucky said, confused. "Who said anything about swimming?"
Steve's heart lurched at the desperation in Tony's tone, and the guilt he'd managed to stamp down earlier came roaring back with a vengeance. How could he have not thought about how badly the incident at the lake had affected Tony?
“Pete…” Tony said, rolling his shoulders, which were rock-hard with tension.  It was on the tip of his tongue to tell Peter no, that he was too young to get involved with all of the horribleness that was HYDRA.
“That’s exactly what this is, little guy,” Steve choked out.  He reached for Peter’s hand across the table, squeezing it gently.  “I know you already call me Papa, but I was hoping… well… I’d just really love to make it official, and—”
Tony's arm tightened across Steve's waist, his fingers slipping underneath the hem of his t-shirt to ghost across his skin, causing him to shiver.
Steve thought, filing the unpleasant thought into the appropriate circular file in his mind.
And even though he was fairly secure, and that Georgia was a lot warmer than New York, he was still pretty damn cold even with his suit's built-in heater.
Steve frowned, shaking his head as they rounded a curve in the trail. "Eh, I don't know, Sam. I'd feel bad crashing on yours and Bucky's dates all the time, and—"
"Tony?" asked Natasha. "What did you see in there?"
"Yes, which is why I've made triply sure that we're all good here," Tony said evenly. "It's not like I'm trying to hurt the guy, Pete. We're doing all this so we can help him."
"Just turned it over to Hill," Natasha said as she and Thor reached their group. "She's going to take it with her back to the Compound."
"Hurry!" cried Mantis as Thanos let out a hair-raising howl. "He is very strong!"
“Tony?” Obie said, jerking his head towards the monitor.  “I believe I asked you a very simple question.”
Tony had said as Steve stared at the floor plan in shock.  Laid out much like their Tower penthouse, their new home also boasted a fully-stocked art studio, complete with floor-to-ceiling windows to allow in as much natural light as possible.
escaped him that Steve Rogers was a damn good-looking fellow.  And that he was also single, according to Peter’s assessment, which were usually spot on.
"Well… no, I'm really not," said Peter. "Why do you think Dad never went out with anyone once I got sick? No one else wanted a defective kid."
"Yeah, okay. Go ahead and play some music anyway, yeah? Something from the big band era?"
"I didn't save you, Tony. You, me, and Peter, we all saved each other."
"Pardon me, sir," JARVIS said carefully, as if he could sense Tony's skyrocketing anxiety level. He had already been kicked off the computers by Bruce once they realised that having two people attempting to examine the data was causing it to degrade that much faster, likely one of many safeguards built into the encryption system. Unfortunately it meant that he didn't really have anything to do at the moment, and, like Steve, it was only making him even more anxious.
No one messes with Tony’s man, with his
he thought as his mind finally caught up with his instincts.  He looked down, his heart almost cracking in two when he saw Peter’s terrified face, and the pain radiating from his huge brown eyes.
"All right," Steve said, patting Tony's side as he pulled out his fingers, cupping his face to bring their lips together in a wet, sloppy kiss.
"Okay, but, why isn't Uncle Bruce hulking out? And who're those guys with the glowy circle things on their hands?"
"I highly doubt that anyone could understand it better than myself, sir," Steve said, forcing Tony to fake a cough to hide his snort.
I was able to finish this chapter earlier than I thought, so you guys get it a day early! 😊.  Please be aware that this chapter gets pretty dark.  Our boys are hurting, and not handling it well at all 😢.  It does get more optimistic towards the end though.
"I can do that," said Tony. "Keep going."
"We will, Peter," said Papa. "And we love you."
"So what the hell happened?"
Seeing Tony ready and willing to help repair the ship seemed to breathe a bit of life back into Gamora. Straightening her shoulders, she gestured towards a utility shelf, on which sat several battered and worn tools, a few of which Tony could recognise from what he had used on Thor's ship.
"Yeah, you did," Tony said as he heard Steve's landing gear engage. He held his breath as the aircraft touched down, cruising to a final stop about ten metres from where Tony was standing.
"Course we are, buddy," Dad murmured sleepily. "If Papa was too damn stubborn to die when he was frozen in ice for over sixty years, then he'll be too damn stubborn to die now too."
And while Peter knew that Papa and Dad would try and protect him if something like that were to happen, there was no way that Peter was going to just sit by and let everyone else take the blame for his idea. He'd been the one who had pushed Dad into developing Project Phoenix, and if anyone deserved to be punished for it, it was him.
"Mmm," muttered Tony as he popped an oyster cracker into his mouth. He still had trouble accepting compliments from Steve, something Steve was actively working to change. "Tell me more about her. What was she like?"
"Ow!"
"That's what I want," murmured Steve. "For the rest of our lives, I want this." He brushed his lips across Tony's neck and shoulder, skimming his hand down Tony's arm to intertwine their fingers before curling both their arms around Tony's front.
The word had barely passed through Sam's lips when the MAUDE glasses activated, and four burly men and one tall, muscular woman suddenly appeared on the opposite side of the room, who Steve recognised as the other five Winter Soldiers. They were all crowded around a dark grey table outfitted with heavy metal restraints, chanting various words in what Steve assumed to be Russian while an IV bag attached to a pole on one of the table's upper corners dispensed a bright yellow liquid into their prisoner.
Peter sighed as he shook his head. "I didn't notice the smell until I'd eaten about three bites of it. I was—I was tired, and when I'm tired—"
"Simon!" Mrs Stacy admonished as she shot Peter an apologetic glance. "I'm sure Peter doesn't really want to talk about that."
"Nope, don't think so." He slid his hand down Steve's back to his ass and gave it a playful squeeze, smirking when Steve let out a soft growl. "You're a good man, Steve Rogers," he said. "And as soon as I can manage to kick you out of here to go make us dinner, I'm gonna call Pepper and tell her that we'll all be unavailable for that week."
"Man, who would've thought that these would be getting replaced so fast!" Bucky said as he jumped down from his X-301, running his hand lovingly along the wing. "We were just starting to get to know each other!"
"Okay, but… I still am," Scott said, frowning. "And what the hell is a plank scale?"
"Okay," Steve said softly. "But you'd tell me if something was wrong, right?"
"Yeah, and how many goddamn drinks did you have before you hooked it up, huh?" asked Tony. "Well? How many?"
"He actually did make off with one of the rolls," said Wanda, pointing to the large baking sheet next to the pies. "But at least he asked me if he could have it first."
"Uhh," Tony stammered, his blood turning cold even as Steve's arm tightened around him. "Yeah, well—"
“Nope, he was a guy, probably not too much younger than you,” said Peter.  He bit down on his bottom lip, wondering if he should even bother.  “Did you remember to—”
"Oh, we not only have Star Trek, we have every single episode of all five of the television series, and all twelve of the movies, spanning all of the various casts," Shuri said, rather proudly. She leaned closer, lowering her voice. "And I have memorised every single one of them."
"All right, Cindy," Liz said, shuffling the stack of index cards in her hands. Peter had noticed that she hardly ever went anywhere without those index cards. "Give me three minutes on… the difference between a fastball and a curveball, describing the physics involved."
"Thank you, sir."
Peter thought.
A huge thank-you to my wonderful betas allthesinnersandthesaints and jehbeeeh! 💗 💗
into the Arctic ice to just chalk it up to simple bad dreams.
"That is absolutely
"Ah, Christ," Tony muttered a moment later. "There's always gotta be something."
Thor grimaced. "Ah yes, that wretched animal. Loves to leave her treats, as Valkyrie calls them, right on the front steps of my home in New Asgard, but… there is no one I would trust more to lead our army. I only ask… while you were observing in the tunnel, you did not happen to see Loki there amongst the warriors, did you?"
said one of the senators from Tennessee, a petite black woman who was serving her second term. "
"Yeah, but I need to say this," said Uncle Bucky, thick and low. "Peter, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for judging your father before I even knew him, and I'm sorry for what you've been through because of people like me. It's not—it's not right. None of it's right."
"I see,” Steve said, rather mischievously.  “And if I didn't?"
Bucky rolled his eyes, elbowing Steve hard in the side before disappearing into his shower stall. "You know how I've told you at least a thousand times that your poker face absolutely sucks?"
"Thanks," Gwen whispered back. "You look nice too. The plaid really compliments you."
"But I didn't say a single word about Peter," Steve added. "Not by name or by implication. I only spoke about you and your father."
“Mmm,” Tony mumbles.  “P’mise?”
"My dad always says that I am," said Peter. "And my papa's said it a couple times too."
"Yeah," he murmured. "I think we are."
Tony's jaw dropped open, his angry retort dying on his lips as his panic-laden mind finally realised why Howard wasn't concerned.
"Please, honey," Tony pleaded. "The 1940s may have been good for some things, but not for stuff like this. In fact, they really freaking sucked for stuff like this."
Even on the battlefields of the war they had stopped to bury their dead once the shooting had paused. That way soldiers were at least granted the opportunity for closure, to say goodbye to fallen comrades.
"Whoa there, fishy, slow down a bit! You don't wanna choke, right?"
"That's good." Steve tilted his head, a slight smile on his full lips. "The new uniform performed perfectly, in case you're wondering."
“Hello?” he tries to say, his throat too dry and too frozen to even force the sound past his lips.  He jerks again, his heart hammering against his ribcage as he hears Tony let out a soft moan from his spot on Steve’s chest.
The team that Tony was proud to call his family.
was bad, it still couldn't be as bad as
Howard scowled, jerking his head in the direction of Tony's bedroom.
Stepping into the hallway, Tony didn't even bother to make eye contact with the Safety Officers as he informed them that he needed to stop by the house to pick up his notes before returning to the base. Howard was nowhere to be found, likely either sleeping it off in his room or out wandering the neighbourhood as he'd been known to do during the day, which suited Tony just fine. He was in absolutely no mood to see him again anytime soon.
Wordlessly, Tony stepped out of his armour and climbed into the back of the truck, not taking his eyes off of Peter's face as he knelt down next to him, brushing the damp curls off his forehead and leaning over to kiss him. Then he reached his hand back which Steve promptly took, lacing their fingers together as Bruce and Dr Cho settled into the front seats to head back to the Tower.
And if they truly were heroes, like they liked to think they were, then he supposed they owed it to the world to try.
Heading out of the lab, they found the rest of the team sitting in the living room, evidently continuing the discussion they had started over dinner the previous night. They all fell silent as Tony and Bruce approached, with Steve's gorgeous face so tentatively hopeful that Tony's heart gave a lurch.
Attempts that weren't yet going quite the way that he had planned as of yet. Peter was an immensely graceful boy most of the time, well on his way to mastering ballet with Natasha and managing flying through the air on his webs as easily as if he'd been doing so his entire life. But his grace during ballet and in the air apparently hadn't exactly translated to the water yet.
"Holy shit," Tony whispered, shivering as desire shot down his spine like a spear. "You do realise that I'm trying to drive here?"
Scott sighed heavily, letting his hands flop onto his knees. "Look, I'm really sorry, Mr Stark—"
He couldn't afford to think like that.
” Tony stated.  “Which I was, last I checked.  As is Steve Rogers.  You know, the man you seem to have
"You have lost, Captain!" Thanos snarled, his words vibrating with laughter. "Just as you lost before!"
"Does that location correspond with what Miss Stacy found on Pete's computer?"
Tony couldn't help but grin. "Ahh, it's probably a lot closer than you wanna think."
“What?” Tony yelped.  He glanced down at his front, growling in frustration when his eyes fell on a list of AC/DC tour dates from late 1990 and early 1991 instead of their
"It's gonna work, mo grá," Steve murmured, pressing a kiss to the top of Tony's head. He trailed his palms up and down Tony's back, sending pleasant shivers of heat through Tony's body. Heat that he hadn't felt since
"At your service, sir," answered JARVIS.
"Oh yeah, I was. Like so exhausted I was almost psychotic, exhausted," Tony said with wide eyes. "And when I woke up four hours later with my neck all wonky and aching and Pete was still asleep, I actually panicked for a second or two, thinking he was dead."
"Well, no, not completely," Tony said. "We have our defence drones, and I've been working on extending their range, but at the moment we can only cover the East Coast and that's about it. We also have these goofy shrinking particles that Pete, Bruce, and I reverse-engineered, but we haven't figured out an actual use for them yet. That and the nanite suits are pretty much all that we've got at the moment. Oh, and Thor's desire to get the Space Stone out of New Asgard."
"All right," he said quietly to himself. "Let's do this."
"Steve?" Tony said, gently tilting Steve's face back to look at him. "We good here?"
"I am absolutely positive," Steve said, his blue eyes blazing with intensity in the dull greyish light inside the car. He cupped Tony's cheek in his hand, his thumb brushing along Tony's cheekbone. "I love you, Tony, and I want everyone to know it. Especially my mother."
"Suit up," he said. "We're heading to Wakanda."
"My dad's a compassionate and loyal person too," he said. "And he loves my papa so much. I've never seen him so happy."
"It's why you love me, honey," Tony said, moaning as he hiked his legs up, hooking his knees over Steve's hips as Steve pressed him further into the cushions. His mind was already swimming with sensation, his hands taking on a mind of their own as they glided over Steve's soft skin and hard muscles. "
"Well, Phillips already seemed to know about Peter, and—"
The Avengers were about to lose. Again.
"That's true," Tony said with a laugh. He honestly couldn't remember ever seeing his own parents be affectionate with each other so he knew his frame of reference wasn't great, but he also had a strong feeling that not too many of Peter's classmates had parents that seemed to like each other as much as his did.
To Peter's surprise, he found Uncle Sam and Auntie Nat waiting for him in the parking lot instead of his dads, his stomach dropping at the grim looks on their faces.
This chapter contains brief mentions of 1930-1940’s period-typical homophobia.
“Well, I’m sure she wouldn’t mind if you took her out sometime,” Tony said as they pulled onto the street.  “I don't drive too many places by myself, so I’m afraid she doesn't get out all that much.”
"And you don't need to be worrying about me, all right?" Tony said firmly. "You just get as much rest as you can."
Phillips was quiet for several seconds, his finger tapping on his datapad as more pictures poured in.

"There," Tony said to Clint, rather triumphantly as Steve stumbled backwards. "Does that answer your idiotic question?"
"Steve? You're still gonna help with the mashed potatoes, right?" Sam asked. "I got about fifteen pounds of 'em already on the stove that're just waiting for a good beating."
“The Tesseract must be here!” shouts Thor.  “This Strucker fellow couldn't mount such a defence like this without it!  At long last!”
And Peter still had no idea how he'd been able to fight against it.
Peter had done some research on phantom limb pain when he'd borrowed Uncle Bucky's datapad the day before—a not-so-easy task since pretty much all of the available information was on sites that were not government-sanctioned—and what he'd read had horrified him. The descriptions of the searing, burning pain radiating up and down the limb that was no longer there were awful, with testimonies of the pain sometimes ratcheting up to such high levels that the patients tried to take their own lives to be rid of it.
He supposed it didn't matter anymore. All that mattered now was keeping it from happening again.
"Thank you, sir."
"Yeah, yeah," James said with a relieved smile. "Just go and save the world now, okay?"
"Probably 'cause he doesn't know," Tony said. He stepped back as one of the SHIELD guards unlocked Lang's cell, leading the three of them into a nearby interrogation room. Once they were settled, Steve leaned forward, his hands folded in front of him.
Hammer," Tony said, dripping with false sincerity. "What exactly did HYDRA promise you in return for not only betraying your country, but also torturing a U.S. citizen and kidnapping a minor? 'Cause I'm guessing that it'd have to be a pretty damn good offer since there's no way in
Thank you so much for all of your wonderful comments!  I’m so glad you’re enjoying the story! ♥️
"Just about," said Steve as he pulled his sketchbook from his jacket pocket. "But I'm afraid mine's not nearly as detailed as yours."
Rhodey had also informed Tony that he’d recently started seeing someone, a former Air Force test pilot who was now an FBI agent.  That little tidbit had launched an entire slew of ideas on how Tony might be able to solve his issues with Obie, but he couldn't afford to be thinking about that now.  He had to get to Steve first.
Thankfully, he didn't have to wait long, as it was only a couple of minutes later that another man stepped out from a nearby clump of bushes and approached the van. Peter watched as he and the sellers examined the various weapons, discussing firepower and pricing, until one of the sellers picked up a handgun and fired it right over the top of the overpass, not too far from where Peter was sitting. Peter jumped up at the booming sound, which reminded him of one of Dad's repulsors times about a million, immediately firing a web towards the weapon and yanking it right out of the man's hand.
"Yeah, right, hot stuff," Tony laughed. He stole another kiss, giving Steve's ass a quick squeeze. "Love you, honey."
"So, what kind of tools do you got around here?" he asked once he'd swallowed.
"Kid just wants me to be happy," Tony muttered. "'Cause that's just the kind of kid that he is."
Steve shook his head, making a poor attempt at a smile. "It's all right, Bruce. I know all of this has been a bit tedious, and keeping you from your other work, but I also know that I don't need to remind you how important it is." He paused, his eyes sweeping around his teammates all gathered around him. "I know it's sometimes hard to remember, but we're not only doing all of this for Peter's sake. From what we've witnessed so far it does appear that these semi-enhanced individuals were aiming directly for Peter, but we also can't forget to look at the bigger picture. The fact that these individuals even exist in the first place is because someone, or a group of someones, has taken it upon themselves to decide what they think is best for everyone else, and has done so without consideration for anyone else but themselves. Now, I'm not sure about you, but I don't think a true democracy would allow that to happen, which is why we not only have to continue what we're doing in light of recent events, we also have to be even more careful about it. Because until we're able to gather all the available evidence and tie all of these seemingly random events together, we're just as vulnerable as any other average citizen when it comes to the whims of this new government, and I know that's one thing that I'm not personally willing to put up with."
of the ventilator hitting Steve like a missile to the chest. So many people were crowded around Peter, including Bucky, Sam, Sharon, James, and Ma, that the only part of him that Steve could clearly see were his feet, carefully tucked underneath the blankets.
Papa fell silent as they waited at a red light, patting him on the knee as it turned green.
“I had—I had these prepared before—before I left on the mission, and I just—”  Steve paused again, clearing his throat as Peter glanced down at the first page, his eyebrows disappearing under his curls as he read it.
"Ah, yep," Tony said with a chuckle. "That's the one."
"Oh, I don't know," Steve said with a shrug. "Can't have been all that long though."

"Get Captain Rogers in the water right now, Tony," Helen commanded without even looking up. "How long was he submerged?"
Just like he was with Steve, Peter was already saving them from themselves.
Steve gave a tired nod. "Thank you," he forced past his scratchy throat. "And how long until his ribs heal?"
Tony's man.
"Secretly gay?" Steve said, quirking an eyebrow. "I thought it didn't have to be a secret anymore?"
Steve’s cheeks immediately flush hot, and he softly grunts, hoping like hell that Thor and Clint don't notice.   It can’t be a coincidence that Tony used that particular word.  Ever since Natasha pointed out to Steve that Tony tended to slip into older vernacular whenever he was around, Steve’s awareness radar has been working overtime on catching it.
Peter shook his head, not meeting her eyes. The last thing he wanted was to ruin the only date they would get for the entire summer.
“Okay, well… how will you ever know if you have that gift unless you give it a try, hmm?” asks Natasha.  “Who knows?  You might end up being really good at it.  And the extra money wouldn't hurt either, right?”
"I'm ready now, Birdman," Tony said as his helmet locked into place, his repulsors powering up. "Race ya."
And ever since then, in his own grumpy, sometimes rather off-putting way, Phillips had always looked out for Steve.
"But what if I don't wanna go anywhere?" Peter cried, immediately clapping his hands over his ears as he broke into a cold sweat. He tipped over sideways on the couch, curling into a tight ball and wishing he could just sink down into the cushions and disappear. His senses were already going bonkers since he hadn't slept the night before, and listening to his dads shouting at each other was only making it worse. "Why would you think that I'd want to be separated from either of you, isn't that exactly what the Nazis did? Ripped families apart? Why should we let the government rip ours apart when we can still fight back? Isn't that the very reason why they're trying this? 'Cause they're afraid we'll fight back? They just want to control us, that's all this is!"
"Ah, if I may, Captain," said Dr Strange. "It would be much faster for me to simply create another portal."
"Looks good to me, Uncle Bucky!" Peter said, squinting as he examined the new hologram. "I don't see anymore dust in there. Dad?"
"I'm okay!" Major Lorne quickly added. "But my controls are frozen. I can't do a damn thing."
"Just feel like doing a mountain fly-by since my fuel's getting low," said Joseph. "You guys go on, I'll see you back at the base."
A leader who had then attempted to do just that by first identifying those people whom he considered to be domestic terrorists, simply because they happened to practise a religion that he didn't like.
Tony gulped as the door slowly opened, his heart skittering at the tentative smile on Rogers' face as he stepped inside.
Dad rolled his eyes at the same time as Peter felt Papa's shoulders drop. "Peter, why didn't you say anything?" asked Papa.
And there was that damn dimple again, sending a shock of warmth blooming across Tony's chest. At this rate, there was no way Tony was going to even make it through dinner.
"Hopefully longer than a few years, hon," Tony cut in. "I'm personally hoping for a few generations."
And Steve had no doubt that if he were in Anthony's shoes, he wouldn't hesitate to do the very same thing. Keeping the information with Peter, a child who had been kept out of school already for over a year, also gave Anthony the perfect plausible deniability excuse in the event that it was somehow discovered. Since intelligence exams weren't administered to Langaran children until they were thirteen years of age, the only people who would likely know the true depth of Peter’s intelligence were his father and grandfather.
Enraged, Thanos jerked the gauntlet down, yanking Peter from his feet and sending him careening across the landscape just as a ship crashed down to the ground right on top of Thanos, bouncing along the surface before skidding to a halt about twenty-five metres away.
Bucky rotated the arm, flexing the elbow. "It feels much better now, Петр, thank you."
After confirming the information on his phone, Peter groped around for his glasses and slid them back on, his heart skipping a beat when the building completely disappeared.
"No, I'll just go and find him," he said as he reached for the t-shirt sitting on his bedside table. He and Tony usually slept shirtless; Steve loved the feel of Tony's smooth olive skin pressed up against his, but he didn't feel it was appropriate for him to wander around the house that way because of Peter.
suddenly filled the lab, the adjacent building exploding like it had been embedded with C-4.  “Oh God, Bucky!”
With a quick shake of his head, Peter pushed that unpleasant thought to the back of his mind, concentrating next on his need for a suit. It would have to be dark in colour since his usual red and blue would be easier to spot, so black or dark blue would be best, and putting one together by Friday evening definitely presented a problem, but…
But now—
"No! He won't last that long!" Steve shouted back. He was dangerously close to panicking, his smoke-filled lungs pulling way too many memories of his childhood illness from the deep recesses of his mind. "The fire's sucked all the oxygen out of his cockpit! He'll suffocate!"
It was a crisp, late winter day as Steve rose from their bed, the sun just peeking over the horizon as he laced up his running shoes. With a final kiss pressed to Tony's pillow-creased cheek, Steve headed out towards the kitchen, where he found Natasha sitting at the breakfast bar drinking a cup of coffee as she poured over a pile of papers.
"Um, I'm sorry, Mr Stark, but he's refusing to leave the building," interrupted Stacy. "He says he won't leave until he knows for sure that his family is safe."
"Like Steve said, we found it in the street a few days ago," said James. "But you still haven't answered how you managed to get in here—"
You guys, I am so thrilled with how much you’re enjoying this fic!  Thank you so much for all of the wonderful comments! ♥️
"Yes, sir," Steve said. "That's correct."
“I saw the way you looked at Mr Rogers today at the pool,” he says, far too smugly.  “You think he’s handsome.”
And the fact that Tony was so insistent on continuing to go back in when he knew that his coordinates were wrong weighed heavily on Steve, as it seemed to him that Tony was deliberately trying to punish himself.
She tilted her head, as if she was trying to remember that she actually had a name. "Wanda," she finally said. "Wanda Maximoff."
"They're cute though," she added. "Together, I mean. They seem pretty happy."
"That he was, little guy," said Papa. He reached over, giving Peter's hair a quick ruffle before turning to the cabinets, rummaging around for a baking dish.
"You thinking that something might've happened to him?" Tony asked as he sat down at his workstation. "I thought his dad was the king of Asgard or something."
Tony sucked in a deep breath, willing himself to stay calm. It was the same old argument that Howard always used to try and justify his utter failure to retain some semblance of humanity after his release from prison.
Tony thought.
"Hey," he said again, smiling tentatively. "Tony, you—you look amazing!"
and after growing up in a country that hadn't seen peace in over seventy years, Tony found that he was now craving it with every single cell of his body.
"Will you let us know once he's out of surgery?" Tony asked. "After you're all settled, of course. I'd… I'm betting that there'll be something I can do that might be able to help, so…"
"Okay, so now we at least know that he's planning on communicating with us," said Sam. "Does Peter know Morse Code?"
Peter's head snapped up in surprise. "He felt threatened by me? Why?"
"Three minutes," Tony repeated with a nod. "Copy that."
"Yes, we can," she stated. "Thank you, Captain."
A loud
Tony breathed in, nodding as Steve carefully pulled out of him before dipping his head to brush his lips across Tony's in a soft kiss.
Emoji Key for those who don't know what to say in the comments!
And little did Steve know that Tony had also packed Steve's nanite suit, which was now tucked securely in his pants pocket.
It was just…
In fact, it seemed like most of the file had been written by a kindergartener since it read more like a fairy tale than anything else, with lots of references to peanuts and peaches and wild horses and "gates marking the sea", exactly none of which was helping Peter figure out where HYDRA was keeping his papa.
But Gwen only shook her head, crying out again when her hands slipped. "Peter! Please, help me!"
“February 9th, 2019,” Steve suddenly said.  “My team is sent into Sokovia for the fifth time.  Our mission objective: to hunt down the source of the black-market weapons being used to arm the radical insurgents hell-bent on destroying the country’s legitimate government.”
Tony let out a heavy sigh, his hands coming to rest on Steve's hips. "I've had JARVIS look into the girl's dad, and he can't seem to find anything about him that I'd consider dirty, and that includes any possible connections to that asshole Senator Davis. And with all these new names we're gonna be looking into and the fact that some idiot or idiots keep trying to attack the Damage Control convoys, right now I'm thinking that maybe we don't need to worry as much about George Stacy and just let Pete have a new friend. It's about damn time that someone besides Ned realised how awesome Pete is anyway."
"Uhh… can I—can I ask you—um… do you two do that a lot?" Lang asked, narrowing his eyes.
"And Wilson's wings, and Barnes' arm," Tony said. He slid his hand into the crook of Steve's elbow as they continued towards the bedrooms. "I'm sure Nat's stuff is perfectly shiny already, knowing her."
"I think he'd love it," Tony murmured, his throat thick with suppressed emotion. Italy was where they had spent the first half of their honeymoon, and also the place where they had both managed to overcome their fear of the water, and Tony had no doubt that Steve was hoping for the same thing to happen again if they returned. "But are you sure that you're gonna be up for it? I mean, that villa we stayed in is right on the Mediterranean, honey, and—"
"Copy that, Tony, Colonel," said Carol. "We're counting down."
And that's even if Tony had wanted to declassify his defence drones to the British government in the first place. Which he didn't.
know who he was anymore.
Especially since the humming noise has now increased both in pitch and volume, and seems to be coming from inside the building.
Tony's throat tightened at how utterly defeated Steve sounded, and how helpless he felt to offer any sort of comfort to him. The kind of bone-deep mental fatigue was all-too-familiar to Tony, and not something he would wish on anyone.
"Okay, that all sucks and all," said James. "But from how you're telling this story, you were still able to beat it."
that son of a bitch try and play that card, that disgusting, barely-veiled homophobic card meant only to question Steve's authority and embarrass them both.
"Uh huh."
Tony tosses him a frown over his shoulder as he raises his right arm, manually activating his repulsor to use as a flashlight.
Now, Steve honestly had no idea what to think.
to get Uncle Bucky's new arm finished. With how fast he was deteriorating and with Papa leaving on his mission in only a few days, Peter didn't figure that he'd still be around by the time Dad was actually able to build it, and he didn't want Dad to have any unanswerable questions about its design.
"Yeah, I—I draw stuff in there sometimes, but… you sit in front of me in most of our classes, so… how do you know all of this? You got eyes in the back of your head or something?"
let's get out of here."
But what he wouldn't give to have even one of them there now. Because surely the magic they could perform with his former home would somehow translate into bringing his son back to life.
As the name of the last finalist fades into the cheers of the crowd, the announcer calls, “Ready”, causing Steve’s belly to give a slight swoop.  He should be used to it by now, having heard it hundreds of times over the course of his long swimming career.  But this time it’s just different enough to make his heart start to tick a bit faster.
"Thor?" Steve asked again. "Thor, what just happened?"
"Well, then that explains the original space phenomenon that we saw in October," said Bruce. "The Chitauri must've been trying to attack them just like they attacked here."
"A lot of civilians do," Steve cut in. "And in a time like this, being able to communicate with friends and family is very important to keeping the panic down to a dull roar."
“All right, sounds good,” said Tony.  “Let’s give him a call.”
"The flight landed at 103am, Agent Romanoff," JARVIS said.
Although, he wasn't exactly sure how helpful they would be against the fire demon, who was now busy chewing through the metal supports holding up the massive movie screen, sending it crashing to the floor.
Slowly, Papa stood up, his blue eyes too tortured for Peter to even look at as he reached for him, wrapping his arms around him.
"Oh, please, sir, I insist!" said Mr Harrington. "I mean, who better to enrich these young minds with tales of post-WWII life than the man who actually lived it, right?"
"You got it." Steve squeezed his eyes closed as he sucked in a deep breath, flinching as another grenade exploded about ten metres behind them that was immediately followed by a chorus of panicked screams and shouts. He could only imagine how frantic Tony must be already. "All right, we'll go on my mark. Three… two… one… mark!"
"Yeah, I guess." She squeezed Peter's hand, giving him one final peck. "I'll call you as often as I can, okay?"
“What’s gonna be so much fun?” Tony asked as he suddenly burst through the door in a shower of snowflakes.  He made an immediate beeline for Steve, planting a kiss on his lips.  “Well, hello there, good lookin’.  You wouldn’t happen to have any plans for the weekend, would ya?  ‘Cause I am certain that I could show you a good time if you’d let me.”
And if that was the case, then he, Papa, Dad, and the entire rest of the Avengers' team—his entire
"James, Sam, check it out!" Steve commanded.
"That's correct, Captain Rogers," said Anthony. "At the moment we're finding that each core can last for about five patrols before it needs to be replaced. But since a potential space mission would be longer than your average patrol the Air Corps can't afford to run the risk of a core burning out, so there's another element that we'll be using as the core for those missions that doesn't have the same risk of burnout."
he tried to tell himself.
"Project Phoenix is a system of national defence initially developed by Anthony Edward Stark," JARVIS began. "It consists of eight specialised satellites placed in orbit above the planet's surface which are designed to activate in response to a perceived threat, most likely to originate from Langara's rival country, Meridia. Approximately six months ago Peter Edwin Stark began altering the original satellite parameters to instead function as energy channellers, utilising the artefact known as the tesseract as an unlimited power source. If successfully implemented, Project Phoenix will in theory be able to supply enough energy to end the current crisis in not only Langara, but in Meridia as well."
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony leaned back in his uncomfortable-as-hell seat, trying to find a position that didn't aggravate his already sore back and shoulders.
“Tony,” Papa choked out from the chair.  “Tony, I don’t—I can’t look at this anymore—”
Stepping into the hallway, Steve paused for just a moment outside the double doors before pushing them open, his heart fluttering as everyone turned to look up at him, with Tony giving him an approving wink.
"Okay, so, who'd they ask?" asked Cam. "'Cause I thought Howard Stark was supposed to be the so-called expert on that kind of stuff back then."
Thankfully, the name of the rather goofy-looking pair of wire-rimmed glasses didn't translate to what they induced, or Peter might’ve had to beg off watching Papa’s experiment.  Instead, the glasses relied on a complex holographic system that connected with the user’s hippocampus, allowing the system to locate a certain traumatic memory and alter it before projecting the memory onto an external infrastructure.  Through the altered projection, the wearer would hopefully be able to re-experience the memory just differently enough to make it less traumatic.
"That's not why I'm here, Tony," Howard said, so clear and with such conviction that Tony jumped. He hadn't heard Howard speak like that since he was six years old, before his heart surgery.
Peter did have to admit that it was kinda funny how flustered Mr Harrington got whenever Papa appeared though. Most of Peter's classmates had gotten used to having one or more of the Avengers showing up at the school on any given day, but whenever Mr Harrington happened to see either Dad or Papa, he practically dropped to his knees in worship. And while Dad tended to take it in stride, Peter knew that it bothered Papa quite a bit and he was just too polite to say anything. Papa never liked drawing extra attention to himself. The celebrity status he had garnered from being Captain America and from being married to Iron Man was already more than he wanted.
Steve was
Tony slowly shook his head, his face a pale greyish colour. "I don't know yet, babe, but I have to say I have a few ideas, and they're all scaring the shit outta me."
"Sharon?" Steve asked. "Are you—?"
"That's 'cause he's the strongest of us," Steve said, wincing as Peter's grip on his hand tightened even further. "No one else could've resisted this. No one."
The thought bounces around Steve’s mind like an out of control ping pong ball as he turns his face back into the water.  As soon as he’s set, he locks his fingers into their slightly curved position and lowers his head, trying to minimise the drag of the water as much as he possibly can.
Peter shifted slightly in his chair, causing Gwen's fingers to tighten and send another bolt of warmth up his arm. They were watching Rogue One, a movie Peter had already seen twice before, and it was almost time for the big climactic battle scene to begin.
Gwen's eyes crinkled as she smiled, biting her bottom lip like she often did. "No, I'm not. I love that you're Spider-Man, Peter, you know I do. But I love
With another hard shake of his head, Steve slotted his discombobulating thoughts into their respective compartments and threw himself into the discussion regarding Mrs Bird and her three chicks. Once again, he barely noticed the passage of time, only glancing up at the clock by chance when he noticed that it was nearly dinnertime.
“That’s right,” replied Steve.  “I’ve been open for about a month and a half now.”
Senator Davis raised his eyebrows as a chorus of murmurs broke out amongst the committee members sitting around him. It never failed to amuse Tony just how many people seemed to have forgotten that Steve was actually lost for sixty-five years.
"Are there any other questions before we begin?" asked Anthony.
Didn't he?
"Yeah. I bet it didn't." Peter scratched at his nose, fighting against the strong urge to yawn. Apparently even holding a conversation was exhausting him now.
Steve's heart gave a painful lurch at Scott's near slip of the tongue. As heavily as Steve and Tony had always guarded Peter's privacy, Tony had told Steve way back in the beginning that their son's genius intellect wasn't much of a secret, and even less so amongst the Stark Industries employees.
"See? I told you," Tony said as he took a bite of the pasta, which was every bit as good as he remembered. "Mr Jarvis was never wrong."
"We're still working on locating them, Tony," said Bruce. "But as soon as we do, we'll—"
"Mmm. Fine," Peter grumbled. It sounded like he'd be using yet another of his JARVIS overrides in the next day or so, which meant he should probably start working on some new ones.
"Mmm," Steve grumbled as he moved Bucky's hand holding the light, trying to see his reflection in the mirror. "I did have a better plan, but—"
"Got something to share there, bud?" he asked.
"These semi-enhanced, I guess we're calling them. We've all been operating under the impression that they've only been coming after Pete with these attacks, but what if that's only part of their overall mission?"
Tony let out a groan once the screen went black, rubbing at his aching temples. While he couldn't be upset that Barton and Nat wanted to celebrate the twins' graduation, all it did was add to the stress he'd been carrying around ever since—
Not that he ever would.  First, Dad would never do that to his employees, and he’s way too much of a workaholic to even think about taking a day off.  Peter’s lucky when he gets him to stay home from the shop on Sundays, only for him to spend the entire day working on the massive computer program that occupies just about every single one of his waking minutes.
And once the surgery was over, and Peter had given Steve a complete play-by-play of his Decathlon competition while his cheekbone and ribs were put back into their proper places and his left foot was rebuilt using pins and plates and screws and placed inside the largest cast Tony had ever seen, and once Helen was satisfied with Steve's level of pain control and Tony had made his follow-up appointment with the surgeon's office in New York, the entire team boarded the Stark Industries jet and headed home, flanked by two Air Force F-22s.
"Man, I am so glad that we don't live in the suburbs!" Peter said as he slammed through a wooden fence. "This really sucks!"
Unfortunately, the more Steve had attempted to slot each of his unpleasant thoughts into their individually labelled compartments in his mind the more jumbled they seemed to become, and coming face-to-face with none other than Anthony Stark that morning hadn't helped in the slightest.
"I think we're pretty much set here, Captain," Sharon said as she handed the last of Peter's monitors to Sam. Bucky was already sitting out in Sam's car with another load of equipment, having been discharged from the hospital two days prior. He and Sam had just finished moving into the house that Sam had found after the attack, which was thankfully only a five-or-so minute drive from Ma's house, but Sam had repeatedly assured Steve that once the mission got underway they would both be at Ma's as much as possible.
"Okay, but are you sure?" Gwen insisted. "'Cause they're taking my dad to the hospital, so why doesn't Peter just go with him? He's probably got smoke inhalation, and burns, and his arms and fingers are bleeding, and—"
“Fine.  Then I’ll tell Pepper to set the meeting for two weeks from today.”
"Really?" exclaimed Peter. "That's so awesome, Dad!"
Steve's eyebrows knitted together. "So… you're saying some of the wreckage is missing?"
Tony rushed out as about a thousand different emotions began warring inside his mind and body, leaving him so nauseous and dizzy that for a moment he felt as though he might actually pass out. With shaking hands he dropped the sketchbook onto the bed like a hot potato, his legs nearly tangling in the sheets in his frantic attempt to get to his feet.
“Oh, I’m sure,” said Peter.  “People do that to Dad all the time too.  It’s kinda embarrassing, don't you think?”
Tony cut off as Obie’s grip on his shoulder suddenly tightened, almost like he was trying to give him a Vulcan nerve pinch.
—room, his eyes going wide in surprise when his own ID badge was able to unlock the door.
He couldn't even bring himself to finish the thought.
"It's not unfair," Peter muttered, so softly that he was surprised that Flash even heard him. Flash blinked, chewing another mouthful of pizza as he leaned closer.
"Yeah, well, I needed to—"
Peter watched as Cindy winced, then shuffled over to the podium, looking sheepishly at Liz for her topic.
"Yeah, I'm good," Tony added as he dropped his papers onto the console, sliding on his headset. Unlike Steve, Tony had long-ago mastered the art of hiding his feelings. Or at least he believed that he had.
Steve nodded. He had never seen any indication that Gwen didn't absolutely adore Peter, and he knew Peter adored her just as much. "If you need anything, or need to get a hold of me, just ask JARVIS, all right?"
"Meaning if the tesseract does try to cause any problems, the box its in will keep it in line," answered Tony.
"That sounds good, guys," Steve cut in. "Thank you."
"And why not? Just to prove me wrong?"
Steve and Tony both looked at each other with wide eyes, and the sense of dread that Steve had been trying to stamp down all morning welled back up, sitting like a lead ball in the pit of his stomach.
“Yeah, I remember,” said Steve.  “That—that’s pretty impressive.”
“And I didn't lie to you about anything either,” Tony added.  “I just—”
A second later the kitchen's view screen lit up with an image from the security camera guarding the Compound's gated driveway entrance. Steve squinted as he struggled to identify the ugly brown striped van in the image, and the man standing in front of it, frantically waving his arms.
And after five years of marriage—or was it still only four? The whole going-back-in-time thing still tended to mess with Tony's mind on occasion—to still have that kind of passion and hunger for each other just had to be something both very rare and very,
“But, Dad, you promised you’d be able to pick me up on time today!” Peter said, glancing furtively around his locker to make sure he hadn't been overheard.  Seeing as it was almost ninety minutes after the final bell, he probably didn't have to worry much.  Most of the students were long gone, with the few remaining still engrossed in their chess clubs or shop class projects, where they probably wouldn’t be able to hear him anyway.
More specifically, Schmidt’s right hand as he slaps it onto the water.  Which means that not only is Steve still with the charismatic German champion, he’s actually slightly ahead of him.
"Captain Rogers," another voice suddenly said from behind the crossed spears. The tall, regally-dressed man held up his hand, nodding to each of the women as they uncrossed their weapons. "It is all right, General Okoye," he said to the woman on the right. "I am expecting these guests."
Steve leaned back against the bench seat in the back of the Quinjet, his shield tucked next to his feet as he slowly breathed in and out, trying to find some semblance of calm. Ever since Tony's last aborted transmission from the spaceship, Steve had felt like he was standing on the very edge of a cliff, trying desperately to keep his balance even as his foot was slipping ever-so-slowly over, sending dirt and pebbles bouncing down the bottomless chasm.
"I concur," said Strange. "We're getting short on time."
Tony doesn’t respond, causing panic to well up in Steve’s empty belly.
Tony huffed out a sharp breath, burrowing further into Steve's side. "Yeah, well, I will be very glad when all this Damage Control stuff is over. I might even throw a party to celebrate."
"How bad was it, sweetheart?" he murmured. "I mean, were you—were you—?"
“The archives are overwritten every forty-eight hours, sir,” said JARVIS.
Steve's heart began to thud as soon as they turned down the hallway that led to Tony's office. He very badly wanted to kiss Tony goodnight, but he didn't want to seem too pushy or forward and possibly scare him.
"Well, all right then," Tony said as he locked eyes with Steve. "Let's do this."
"I'm allowed to see my grandson if I want to, Tony!" Howard snapped back. "And he at least listens to what I have to say, which is a lot more than you've ever done!"
"It's just a movie, Papa," Peter said, instantly regretting it when Papa's worry wrinkle appeared. "I mean, thanks. I really, really appreciate it."
But, like Steve always said, he supposed the ‘what ifs’ didn't matter.  Not when things were the way they were now.
And only a month after those fateful Games, Steve lost Ma, sending him spiralling into such a deep and dark depressive state that if he hadn’t met Natasha when he did… there's no telling where he would be now.
"I am really glad that I don't work at a lighthouse or something," he muttered. He slid his glasses off, rubbing at his eyes and trying to blink them back into focus when something shiny suddenly appeared in the far upper right-hand corner of his screen, almost like it was reflecting the moonlight.
"I do not see any errors in either the design or its specifications, sir," answered JARVIS. "Would you like to run a diagnostic on this projection?"
"Exactly. Can you do me one more favour before we sign off here?"
Tony let out a puff of air as he and Steve got to their feet, nodding towards the chairman before heading back towards the doors with Rhodey close behind them. As soon as they were in the hallway Tony sucked in a deep breath, glaring in the general direction of the various senators and aides who were now exiting the chambers.
"It's okay, Papa. We'll be able to fix you up again once we get out of here," Peter said softly as he helped Papa to his feet, draping his arm across his shoulders. He was heavily favouring his left foot, which looked so crushed and misshapen inside the boot he was wearing that it no doubt hurt like absolute hell.
"Yeah. Once it's all over." He sniffed as he looked at Steve, his eyes flicking to the portrait in Steve's hand. "It's been so long. So long since I've seen him like this, and I—I'd almost forgotten what he was like."
The elevator doors had barely closed behind Uncle Bucky and Uncle Sam when JARVIS announced that Dad was waiting to talk to him. Peter practically raced to his room, skidding to a stop in front of his viewscreen as Dad's tired face appeared. He was standing inside Uncle Thor's ship, which, Peter immediately noticed, so closely resembled the bridge of a Klingon Bird of Prey that there was no possible way it was a coincidence.
Something about the tone of his voice, the way it wobbles ever-so-slightly, and the way he’s now refusing to look Steve in the eyes causes a knot to rise in Steve’s throat, remembering something else that Peter’s told him.
"I mean, not tonight!" Steve said through clenched teeth. He huffed out a sharp breath as he walked Tony into their bedroom, not giving him another opportunity to protest. "JARVIS, please soundproof the room."
And, of course, being unable to say no to him, both Rhodey and Sam had agreed.
“Um, like so obvious that it’s written all over your face every time you look at him,” replied Peter.  “And Steve’s the exact same way!”
"Oh Christ, babe, I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking, you know I tend to just shoot off my mouth—"
Steve had also told Tony that in order to have the kind of air support necessary for him and Carol to make it through the atmospheric barrier, he would need the backing of at least half of all the patrol pilots. Fending off possible attacks from Langara's ground forces or from pilots loyal to General O'Brien would be critical for the mission's success, as would defending against any possible attacks from Meridian forces.

The backseat heater was going full-blast as Peter climbed inside the truck, which Peter was extremely grateful for as he fumbled to put on his seatbelt. Even with his Spider-Man suit, three layers of clothes, and a down jacket pretty much designed for a climb to the top of Mount Everest, he was still cold.
"Peter? Hey, are you even listening to me?"
"Mmph," he mumbled as he slammed his eyelids closed again, reopening them into slits a few seconds later. Once they had adjusted a bit, he shifted slightly, attempting to raise his right hand, which felt like it weighed about thirty kilograms, so he could reach for the cup of water sitting on the bedside table.
"Yeah, thanks, big guy," said Tony. "And I should have some time tomorrow afternoon to give you a bit of a break, I know it's been awhile since you've had one."
"I'm saying that it's not out of the realm of possibility," Bruce said. He glanced over at Tony, who gave him a nod. "I mean, the very reason that Peter was able to decode the stuff that he decoded was because he could actually see the hidden text in the file, so it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to think that there's something out there in that water that he can see that someone without his visual enhancements can't."

"It is possible," said T'Challa. "I would have to go there myself to verify it, but based on what I have experienced in the past, I would be surprised if it were not the case."
“Uh huh.”  Replacing his goggles, Peter ducks down under the surface and pushes off the wall.  Butterfly was always his favourite stroke during his lessons, but also the most tiring, leaving him huffing and puffing by the time he gets back to the wall.
'Cause it was one thing for him to know that he was going to die soon. Peter had come to grips with that ever since he'd been admitted to the hospital.
"Um… well, both—both of 'em," Peter said. He tugged on the collar of his hoodie, trying to get some air moving around his flaming neck. "They're both gentlemen, and they're both really smart too. I mean, Papa's probably not considered a genius like Dad, but he's still really, really smart. We even study him in our history class, so…"
"Hello," she said, clear and strong, her expression almost unreadable. "I'm Sarah Rogers."
"Oh, I'm pretty sure this lady's got a crush on him or something," said Ned. "And she thought it was weird that he was just walking around the city like nothing had happened after being gone for months. She thought she would've heard that he was back in town."
"What is it, honey?" Tony asked, his confused expression nearly tearing Steve's heart in two. "Is something wrong?"
"Ah, I gotcha. Then I promise I won't tell anyone," said Steve. "And, if you don't mind, maybe I can bring in one of my sketchbooks next time and we can draw together?"
"Yeah, yeah, whatever," Peter grumbled. "But I'm ready now, so can we please get going? I wanna do this."
The fact that there were still a few pretty heavy secrets between him and Tony wasn't helping matters. Unfortunately, Steve couldn't seem to figure out a way to bring up the fact that he had met and gotten to know Peter before he'd even met Tony that didn't sound stalkerish or otherwise creepy. Tony had already told Steve all about his son, including his name and the fact that he was in the hospital, so Steve really had no more excuses for not telling him besides his own fear.
smile. "I guess I have pretty good eyes. And I was looking right at you, so…"
"And we also might want to start thinking about what's going to happen once we've gone through all these names," said Natasha. "I know we're still working on the decryption, and that it's pretty slow-going, but do we have a plan on what to do next?"
"And your friend is all right, Pete, she's with a couple of the police officers," Dad added, his fingers combing through Peter's singed and matted hair. "And Stacy's gonna be okay too." He paused, pursing his lips. "One of the other officers said that you saved his life, so…"
"But how can you be sure?" demanded Peter, dangerously close to squeaking. "If Thanos snapped his fingers but my dad's not dead, then where'd he go?"
"Ah, the mythical Captain emerges!" Sam said with a wide smile. "Bucky and I were just gonna come and see if you guys needed anything."
"In that case, would you prefer that I construct Master Peter's equipment in the lab at the Compound, sir, seeing as that is the location where it will be used?" JARVIS asked.

"Yeah, little guy, everything's all right," Steve whispered as he kissed him again. "Go on back to sleep now, okay?"
and lives to tell the tale.
"Okay, so, should we maybe just move the rest of the stones there?" asked James. "How many are here again?"
"Okay… so…" Bruce finally said, removing his glasses. "If I'm reading this right, you're trying to say that the final variable isn't necessary because we're treating the Quantum Realm as a tunnel instead of an actual endless space."
Tony thought automatically.
"Yeah, right," Peter said, shivering as he stuffed his hands into his pockets to try and stay warm. Now that Gwen was gone the heat was seeping from his body in waves, and while it wasn't exactly freezing outside anymore, it was still plenty cold. "Like I'd do anything like that in front of you."
Steve’s cheeks flush pink against his will, his jaw clenching so tightly that his back teeth scrape together.
"Yeah, not exactly what I'd call a great date," Peter muttered.
The very same anguish Steve was now experiencing, the weight of it so crushing he was surprised that he hadn't yet been pushed into the ground.
"The thing is, honey, it's perfectly understandable to be scared for your kid," he began. "I was constantly terrified for Pete, especially with him growing up in the middle of a war. Before he was too sick to go to school, I used to worry about him all damn day while he was gone, thinking that a stray bomb would miss its target one day and hit the school instead, or something like that. And then once he started staying home all the time, I'd worry that he'd just stop breathing and die before I could get home. And I hate to tell you this, but the fear doesn't exactly go away. Just 'cause Pete's heart is fixed now doesn't mean that I'm done worrying about him. You just… kinda learn to live with it. Otherwise you'll just be paralysed from it all the time."
It was now or never.
"Shh, it's okay, honey," Tony said, kissing him softly on the lips. "I'm gonna take good care of you tonight. Put that super soldier libido of yours to good use."
"No, you may not," Peter said, as politely as possible as his fingers flew across the keyboard. A few minutes later he had managed to retype the entire page, huffing out a sharp breath as the translation caught up with him.
"There you go," he murmured once the tie was properly in place. Then he picked up Peter's suit jacket, holding it out so he could slip it on and brushing his hands across the shoulders to smooth it out.
"Tony—"
Yet another thing that Natasha seems to enjoy pointing out.
"I have, actually, but I'd really,
“But I thought—”  Steve clamps down on his bottom lip before he can say something else wrong.  “Nevermind.”
"JARVIS, how many of these requests have there been?"
"You do?" Tony said, realising that he sounded way too excited. "I mean, you really think that… Mantis could put Thanos to sleep like she did with your father/planet?"
“These are so awesome!” Peter said as he selected a bright blue bookmark containing one of his favourite
"'Night, JARVIS."
"I'm on a mission," it said. "Peace in our time."
"I just need to make sure that you're sure," Steve finally said.
"Oh? What did Pete tell you about him?"
The party, as it turned out, was quite honestly the best party that Steve had ever attended. The food, catered by Tony's very favourite restaurant, the place where Mr Jarvis would often take him, was absolutely impeccable, and the company even more so. As the food and beverages flowed freely and everyone in attendance came to offer Steve and Tony their personal congratulations, Steve felt certain that his face was in danger of becoming permanently locked in the wide smile he'd worn ever since he'd first set eyes on Tony from across the aisle.
It was the exact same sound the
"Pretty sure it was Pete who discovered that little tidbit in the HYDRA files, honey, along with all the other stuff he wasn't supposed to be reading," Tony murmured, stifling a yawn. "Makes sense though. I bet all the rumours floating around about the super cool Wakandan tech just about drove Howard bonkers. You know he always wanted to have his fingers in every single pie he could find, and I know it always bugged the hell out of him that he could never get his hands on more of their magical metal."
As soon as the screen went blank, Peter huffed out a sharp breath, scrubbing at his eyes with the heels of his hands and wincing at the pain that shot through his damaged fingers. Sleep had been so hard to come by lately that his vision kept warping into the honeycomb-like state that it always took on when he was extra tired, but he hadn't wanted to arouse suspicions by wearing the glasses Dad had made for him so he'd just been trying to deal with it.
"Not quite, but with a few minor modifications I can increase the range on the southeasternmost unit. Stand by."
"What the hell is that thing?" demanded Clint as soon as he jumped from the bike. "It looks like a really fucked-up version of the abominable snowman!"
"That's all right, Captain Barnes," Tony said. "I honestly wasn't expecting any of you to make it on the first try."
His words hit Tony straight in the chest, stealing his breath.
"Mr Stark's current location is his laboratory, Captain," JARVIS finished, anticipating Steve's next question. "Shall I tell him when to expect you?"
"And this will save him, right?" Steve asked. "Peter will be able to have his surgery once we do this?"
Steve was
"No, sir. Nothing besides dinner, sir."
"Yep," answered Tony. "Georgia coast, just like the girl found."
"Ah, sure thing, honeybear," Tony cheekily replied as he took off again, quickly locating Peter. "You know I'm always up for a good show."
🔥 = this was so hot/ sweet!
version of Steve from the first two videos, replaced now with a Steve who, if Tony didn’t know any better, would say has a pretty big chip on his shoulder.  Aside from shooting some not-so-subtle glares at his Russian opponent, Steve seems to be a lot more nervous here, like he’s actually afraid he’s going to lose.
"Ha ha ha," Steve said, chuckling as they stepped out of the Compound's front door. Tony squinted as the sunlight hit him square in the face, digging his sunglasses out of his pocket as Steve offered him his arm.
"Ahh, yes, that's right," Steve said, barely catching his frown before it could form. It was a bit unnerving that a supposedly reclusive monarch seemed to know so much information about them, not to mention that singling out Peter within the first few minutes of their meeting was not going to go over well with Tony, who was no doubt already listening in. "My son is sixteen years old."
"I'll take that as a 'no', then."
"Nope, on second thought, now there's just two."
Tony suddenly gasped, the idea hitting him so hard that he nearly tipped backwards.
"Except your healing factor is not due to a mutation, correct?" Shuri asked as she placed a third cloth, this time covering Tony's neck and right cheek. "You were… made?"
that evil, sinister voice that Peter knew haunted both of his dads as well suddenly whispered. All three of them were terrible about sharing certain things because they didn't want the others to worry, even when all it ended up doing was making everything about a million times worse.
"We tried, Mr Stark," said Sharon. "I called up to the base looking for you this morning, and I was told that you could not be interrupted."
"Great. Thanks, JARVIS."
"Okay, Mr Toomes said whatever was happening was happening about a half a kilometre from here," he said as he looked up, cursing the lack of skyscrapers to swing on. Apparently no buildings taller than two stories were allowed in that particular suburb, so he was just going to have to run there. "JARVIS, can you give me the most likely location around here for something illegal to be happening? Radius is about half a kilometre."
Tony pulled back his head, his brown eyes twinkling in the dim morning light as he angled Steve's chin down so he could kiss him. The kiss was slow and lazy, as even on a normal day Tony never woke up very fast, which somehow managed to make Steve's desire for him skyrocket even more. Aside from the sex, which was always incredible, Steve just really loved kissing Tony.
"Peter, can you please tell me what's wrong?" she asked, in that quiet, semi-raspy voice that reminded him a bit of Auntie Nat. "I mean, I know your papa almost got hurt and stuff again, but you've been… I don't know, extra weird ever since school started, and I don't—I just don't know why." She trailed her thumb across the back of Peter's hand, sending goosebumps pebbling up his arm. "And I don't—I don't know how to help you."
"Oh, yeah, my mom's on her way," answered Ned. "She just texted, should be here in a minute or two."
"Don't you
Steve sputtered, unable to comprehend why Tony was being so stubborn about this. How could he not understand that the arc reactor would probably make it harder for his body to fight off germs?
"Because I had a job—"
"Steve," he tried to say, his mouth and tongue flatly refusing to cooperate as the hatch finished lowering, and Steve came into view.
"Did you live with your mom at your old house?" the boy—Simon, apparently—asked. "Is that why you moved?"
"Now then," he began. "You're all here because you've demonstrated exceptional proficiency in the X-301 aircrafts." He pointed to the diagram of the X-301 with the tip of his pen. "As I'm sure you're all aware, the X-301 was built as an experimental aircraft designed to test a brand-new rounded hull, replacing the more conventional bi-wing design with something that's more aerodynamically sound. Well, based on all the reports that you've all filed following your routine patrols, it seems as though that design has performed even better than we could've hoped."
“Was that your father?” Steve asked once he’d pocketed his phone.  He’d sat back down on his stool while Peter was on the phone, lowering himself down onto it like he was afraid it was going to scoot itself out from underneath him.
But he couldn't. Not while Peter's life was hanging by only the thinnest of threads.
Steve's ma had told him a few stories about General Matthew O'Brien from back when he held Colonel Phillips's position as Commander of the Air Corps. According to her, while he had apparently liked Steve's father well enough, he had been known throughout the Air Corps for having a particularly quick temper and for his tendencies to hold grudges, often keeping old grievances tucked away in order to pull them out whenever he felt it necessary.
Tony scoffed. "Most of the time? What about the rest?"
“Okay, um…” he said, scrubbing his palm down his face.  “So you're trying to tell me that the enemy Steve vanquished back during World War II, which, if I remember correctly, ended in 1945, for God’s sake, has now just suddenly sprung up right out of the goddamn ground to kidnap him?”
Gwen only shrugged, hugging her stack of books closer. "They haven't been picking you up from school. Ever since school started it's been one or both of them waiting for you in the afternoon, but for the last week it's been someone else."
Was he ever going to be rid of HYDRA? Or was he destined to be chased by them forever, like the sun by the moon.
too far for if. The only outcome Tony would accept now was a complete and unequivocal victory.
"Mmm, this is nice!" Gwen said as she tapped in her information, handing it back to Peter with a shy smile. "I bet you get to try out all the prototypes from your dad's company, huh?"
"I actually already have plans tomorrow afternoon," he finally said. "But I'd be up for it the day after."
"Because—" Tony started, the rest of his words dying on his lips as Peter raised his head, looking up at him with his huge, doe-like eyes. There was no way Tony could tell him what he'd seen, it would scare him half to death, and the last thing that Peter needed was even more stress and worry for his dads piled on top of his skinny shoulders. No matter how strong those shoulders happened to be.
"Yes, Colonel, that'd be fine," said Steve. "As long as he makes it quick."
"Given the parameters set forth by Master Peter, I have calculated a ninety-seven point three five percent of success," answered JARVIS. "At the moment the only limiting factors are the collection of the necessary components—"
Hammer blinked, giving a slight cough as he fiddled with the fancy silk tie around his neck. The man had always had a flair for the dramatic.
The flash of brilliant white light that followed Tony's snap was blinding, the rippling echoes of it amplified across the entire plain as the six infinity gems dropped to the ground and Tony collapsed against Steve, his entire right side sparking and sizzling like he'd been burned with one of Peter's Bunsen burners. Steve's own right side was burning and tingling too, but he completely ignored the intense pain as he gathered his husband into his arms, brushing the damp, matted hair from his forehead.
Tony bit his lip, hesitating. On the one hand having official police and FBI backup was probably the best way to go. But on the other hand this was HYDRA, and they weren't about to take it easy on anyone who they found to be assisting the Avengers.
"C'mon, baby, stay with me," he ordered. Steve's eyes were still open, but Tony couldn't tell if it was because he was still awake or they were just frozen in place. "JARVIS, where the hell is Barton?"
"Well, some people tend to show their grief a bit differently than others, mo grá," Steve said. "I saw some of that during the war. Guys would be talking to their buddy standing right next to 'em one second, and the next he'd be flat on the ground, shot right through the head or the chest." He let out a sigh, one so heavy that Tony reached for his hand. "And during a battle, you can't stop, or you might get shot too. You just have to keep going, and that makes it even harder."
"Peter,
"I won't," said Peter. "Love you."
Peter bit his lip, trying desperately to keep his tears contained. "Not quite everyone. My friend, Gwen, her dad's a police officer, and she told me that he's pretty upset by all of this, so… it's not everyone."
After shrugging into his jacket, Steve gave Peter a final wave and followed Tony into the elevator.  Without Peter there to chatter away the silence, his nervousness came rushing back with a vengeance, and he found himself rehearsing lines in his head as they rode down the two-hundred-plus story building to Tony’s private parking garage.
"Of course I do," Tony said firmly. "Which is exactly why you ever-so-bluntly informed Nick that there was no way in hell I was going to accompany you guys on this mission. Or Barton, for that matter. Us househusbands have to stay home and look after the kids."
"You might not remember," Beck began. "But we actually attended a conference together, back when the company was still based out in California. It was only a small tech conference held in Silicon Valley, but I'll never forget how mesmerised I was by you, sir. You're just… such an inspiring man to work for, and I hope you'll excuse my tardiness today because I just wanted to make absolutely sure that this presentation was worthy of your valuable attention."
All of the pain Steve’s endured over the last three—or even four—years, both physical and otherwise, has all been for nothing.  He’ll have no money, no endorsements, and no way to help Ma.
"Yes, sir. However, with these identifications, Director Fury strongly believes that we have finally seen the last of HYDRA's agents."
"Well, maybe it should," Dad snapped. "Maybe I should just tell them that I'm not gonna cooperate anymore and see what they think about that."
And while he would've given just about anything for even the chance to get another splinter in his palm or another skinned knee, Peter also knew that if that chance came at the expense of the entire country, then it wasn't worth it.
“But,
Then again, Tony was also certain that if he went to work in the lab, Steve would simply follow him there, which would also mean that he wouldn't be sleeping.
"Okay, that may be," said Steve. "But if Thanos happened to get his hands on the Time Stone, couldn't he then do the same? Couldn't he rewind things to the Battle of New York, for example? Change things so that the missile hits the city instead of his fleet." Steve's heart swooped as soon as the words left his mouth, remembering his horror as he watched Tony fly through the portal carrying that missile on his back.
Uncle Sam said.  He shifted on his feet, eyeing Image Papa warily.
"Steve!" Tony gasped, swerving to the left to avoid one of the guns that had locked onto him. "Steve, where's—where's Pete? Where is he—do you have him?"
"Ned, why don't you back off a bit, okay?" Gwen said, politely but firmly. "From what my dad told me that place where they were keeping Captain Rogers was pretty awful, and I'm sure Peter doesn't really want to have to think about it more than he has to."
And he didn't. Because no sooner had he climbed inside, the ship hit the edge of Earth's atmosphere. He had reached the point of no return.
Pain pierced Tony's heart as he looked down at his half-finished plate. While his mother may have worked hard to earn a living, the intense stress she'd been under because of it had caused her to withdraw from pretty much everyone, including Tony, leaving him to fend for himself from the time he was younger than Peter. If Mr Jarvis hadn't been there to keep him in line for as long as he did, Tony was certain that he would've been dead several times over.
“We got this side, Steve,” she says.  “You guys concentrate on the other.”
"Yeah, I'll get Happy on it," Dad said with a sigh. "But we're gonna get Pete home first."
"Oh, that sucks," Ned said, rather downcast. "I was kinda hoping you could start picking me up."
"What is this place?" Sam asked as he stepped through, eyeing the broken ceiling. "Is this where you live?"
It doesn’t escape Steve’s notice that even despite the mind-numbing pain that he’s in, he was still able to notice how much he liked having Tony’s hand on his hip, for however brief a time it was.
"Shh, honey," Tony whispered as he draped his glorious body over Steve's, pressing him down into the mattress as his lips trailed across Steve's pecs, pausing to flick his tongue across both his nipples as his hand slid down his sternum and abs to pop the button on Steve's shorts and lower the zipper.
mistakes he made with Brock isn’t going to change the fact that he made them, and will likely be paying for them—both literally and emotionally—for the rest of his life.
"Good morning, beloved," Tony whispered, just before he sealed their mouths together. Steve let out another soft moan as his arms curled around Tony's back, moving Tony to straddle him. Tony gasped into Steve's mouth as his own half-hard cock slid against Steve's, heat blooming across his chest as Steve's hands slid down to grip his ass.
Colonel Phillips continued on, waxing poetic about Anthony Stark's many achievements in an obvious attempt to impress the assembled group of Air Corps pilots, but Steve could barely listen, his jaw tightly clenched and only a single thought running through his mind.
"Mmm," muttered Tony. "Stubborn soldier."
Peter cried inside his dazed and dizzy mind, clinging desperately to consciousness.
Unfortunately, that also meant that the team had to tread very carefully. For how easily HYDRA was able to come up with a chump excuse to arrest Steve, Tony couldn't believe that they hadn't yet tried to nail any of the rest of them, especially given Bucky and Natasha's histories as assassins and Bruce's history of running from the government. He had no doubt that they were already being watched, and as such had JARVIS monitoring all communication lines for possible leaks, as well as keeping the defence drones on high alert at all times.
JARVIS piloted the suit directly through their main living quarters and into Peter's bathroom, where the huge soaking bathtub was filled to the brim with warm water. Natasha was sitting inside the tub in her ballet clothes with a shivering Peter wrapped in her arms, her fingers stroking his hair and his head resting on her shoulder while Helen Cho examined his bruised and bloodied knuckles with a critical eye.
"Ned, who actually coined the term, 'Cold War' to describe the differences between the Communist East and the Democratic West?"
"So the plan is that you'll go home with Gwen and her father unless you hear otherwise from me, okay, bud?" Dad said as Peter unbuckled his seatbelt. "And then Papa and I will pick you up from their house as soon as we get back from upstate."
"Clint, Nat," Steve said, nodding towards the computer stations. "See what you can find."
"I thought—I thought that I could stop them," he said softly, his eyes trained on his feet poking out of his blankets. "You guys have been so twitchy about everything lately with all the government stuff and everything else, and when I heard what was gonna happen, I just thought—" He paused, turning to look Tony straight in the eye. "I just wanted to be like you. Like you and Papa."
"Well, anyway," Peter said, clearing his throat. "Have you ever heard the phrase, 'blow smoke up your ass'?"
Papa turned his head, his blue eyes swimming with tears as they scanned Peter’s face.  “P-Peter, I—I love you.  I love you so much, little guy, and I’m—”
"Just a taste of things to come, honey," he whispered, sending a burst of heat across Steve's chest, and forcing him to have to turn around and discreetly adjust himself.
"Well, I'm not sure 'cahoots' is the right word, but he definitely enjoyed his cushy position, and all of its perks," Grandma said. "And tended to turn a blind eye to people who were, shall we say, less cushy."
Ned looked so taken aback that Peter had to stifle a laugh. "No! Are you nuts?"
Because he highly doubted that his dreams would be anything close to sweet until HYDRA was completely dead and buried, and it was high time that he stopped being so stinking afraid, and started doing more to help.
"Well, I promise I'm gonna always be here to take care of him when he's sick, all right?" Steve whispered into Peter's soft curls. "And you too, little guy. I'll take care of you both."
look on his face that Tony might have laughed if he hadn't been so thoroughly spooked. But at the moment, the only thought racing through Tony's mind was now that he had determined that Steve was fine, he had to get to Peter.
Bucky rolled his eyes. "Oh Stevie, you're not a kid anymore. There's no hard rule that you have to wait till the third date."
It was difficult, but they were trying.
"Gwen!" he cried, or rather squeaked, still unable to draw in air as he slid down the web rope to her, cradling her to his chest, her eyes staring blankly ahead.
Image Papa’s face fell so fast Peter was surprised his lips didn't drop to the floor.
"It was over three minutes, almost four," Steve choked out, fighting against the tears threatening to spill over as he pulled his jacket back on. "It was maybe fifteen or twenty seconds from when JARVIS alerted us until we were in the air, and we weren't that far away, so—"
"Peter? Did you say something?"
"Oh, really?" Tony asked, squirming slightly. "Care to enlighten me, then?"
cool, and Peter has no doubt that Dad will be able to pull it off someday.  As long as it doesn’t kill him first.
"You…
Just as Steve loved him.
Emoji Key for those who don't know what to say in the comments!
"Hmm…" Peter mumbled, tapping his chin as he glanced around the room. "How 'bout over by the window? I'd like it if you weren't looking at me, like I caught you contemplating or something."
It only took about three seconds for Peter to realise that the object looked almost exactly like one of Dad's Iron Legion suits, which had to mean that—
"Yeah, that sounds fine," Peter said, thudding his head against the window. Now that school was over his last remaining dregs of energy seemed to have seeped away, leaving behind nothing but exhaustion.
"You know, people say that you can't technically be considered a genius if you're not at least a little absent-minded," Gwen said. She tilted her head, giving Peter a wide smile that sent a rush of warm fuzzies down his spine. "I read that in a book somewhere."
They had barely taken three steps before Natasha came over the comm. "Cap, Thor and I are counting at least fifteen more hostiles in here, and they've just released some kind of gas that's clouding up the second and third floors."
Tony smiled, his gorgeous brown eyes sparkling behind his glasses as he curled his fingers over his microphone.
If only he knew better what to expect. During the war, Steve had known exactly who his enemy was and where they were hiding, and so only had to come up with good ways to beat them.
It was all just a bit overwhelming.
He could even tell that Gwen knew that something was up, especially since he had only managed to pick at his lunch earlier that day, his appetite almost nonexistent as Ned and Betty prattled on about something or other. Gwen hadn't had a chance to say anything yet, but Peter suspected that questions were coming as soon as practise was over.
"I'm not scared, I'm mad," Peter said sharply. Now that his dads knew what was happening, the fear that had consumed him ever since the previous night was being rapidly replaced with anger. "Who do these people think they are, thinking they can just single us out because we're a bit different from them? It's the worst kind of discrimination, and I can't believe that you think we should just run away from it instead of fighting back."
"Oh gods, baby,
mission, but it still hit him like a sledgehammer to the chest, forcing all the breath from his lungs. He still didn't remember much from his time in the bunker or from his coma that followed, only that he'd never been in so much pain in his entire life, or so incredibly exhausted that he felt like he could sleep for a hundred years.
"Yeah, that's very true," Papa said, just before his expression turned serious.
That moment had been one of the lowest of Steve's life, but it had also forced him to dig down into the deepest recesses of himself, searching for strength that he wasn't exactly sure he would find.
"Aw, that's wonderful!" Steve exclaimed, even as he felt a pang of regret. He had really enjoyed getting to know Tyler.
"I'll check on him every couple of hours," Ma said. "Won't even wake him up."
"Steve," said Tony, raspy and desperate as he bounced impatiently on his feet. "Honey—"
"Shh, mo grá," he said as the tip of his tongue poked out between his perfect teeth. "Ach déan iarracht scíth a ligean. Just try and relax."
"Yet to be identified?" Tony asked. "That's quite a stretch, coming from you."
“Oh, Tony,” he said, shaking his head.  “Tony, Tony, Tony, how many times have I told you not to fuck around with stuff you don't understand.  It’s always like this.  Someone comes into your life who’s a less-than-stellar influence, and suddenly you start sticking your nose in places where it clearly doesn’t belong.  And now, since you seem to feel the need to hold this conversation in front of your friends rather than in private, I’m afraid—”
Before HYDRA. Before Thanos.
"Well, yeah. Why wouldn't she be?"
he states, grateful when his voice doesn’t quiver.  “Now if you don’t mind, I’d appreciate it if you could get out of my face.”
Actually, even more so when it was directed at him.
"Now remember, I want you to rest as much as possible," Steve said as he touched Tony's cheek, relieved to find that his skin was already a bit cooler. "You promised."
But for Steve, it was perfect.
"Not for sure, but it should be within the next few days," said Peter. "Like you said, they've been gone for over a week now. I'll ask 'em as soon as they get home and then I can let you know, if that sounds okay?"
"Goodnight, little guy," Steve said as he kissed Peter's forehead. "Sleep tight."
Tears pricked Tony's eyes once he heard Steve click off, but he quickly blinked them away. He didn't have time for tears now. He needed to keep gathering evidence.
Tony shouted as he came to a stop in midair. "
"Stop," Tony said, brushing his fingers across Steve's lips. "Stop that right now. You stayed by my side in the hospital for weeks while I was out of commission, so now it's my turn. In sickness and in health, right?"
"Um…" Peter stammered, gulping. "Why don't you open it?"
“So then, what.  We’re just gonna leave him there?” Peter cut in.  “Dad, you know Steve didn't mean to flip out like he did, it was an accident!  He didn't mean it!”
"Holy shit," Peter said as the words practically jumped out at him from the screen, like a poor-man's version of 3-D. It was still written in Russian, but from what little of the language he had managed to pick up thanks to Uncle Bucky and Auntie Nat, Peter could tell these were actual words written in the Cyrillic alphabet, instead of just random combinations of characters.
Failed to keep Tony from succumbing to his own guilt and despair until he was nothing more than a broken shell of the man that Steve had married.
"It's really him, Papa, I promise," Peter said softly. "HYDRA can't trick you anymore."
Steve watched as Stacy's already ruddy cheeks flushed even deeper. "Yes, well, she's definitely competitive, and has been ever since she was a baby. But from what she's told me, your boy is just as much, if not more so."
He only hoped that the sun didn't turn around and burn him.
"You've got me, honey," he said. "Always."
Steve, I don't know what I would've done if—if you—"
All of which meant that Steve had better find the bunker he’d been sent to find soon, before it got dark.  From what he could tell he was still about fifty kilometres away, and while he hoped he’d be able to make it there before dark, judging by the low position of the sun he would definitely be cutting it close.  For a moment he wondered why the plane had chosen to drop him so far away from the structure, but quickly squashed it.  He was already down, so that didn't really matter anymore, and based on the briefing materials he had been given on the flight, the entire wooded area that surrounded the bunker was rigged with landmines and other various traps that were left over from a failed coup—or was it annexation?—attempt about five years ago.  Steve’s task was to navigate a path through the maze so that the STRIKE team could then move in and secure the bunker, gaining access to all of the supposedly classified materials hidden inside it.
"He'll be staying home," Dad said firmly. "Don't wanna push things if we don't have to."
"Pardon me if this isn't part of your presentation, Mr Stark, but I can't help but wonder. The fuel that we currently use in the X-301s isn't designed for space flight, and as far as I know the Air Corps hasn't yet developed any kind of specialised rocket fuel, so how would we even be able to ignite that engine in order to make it out of the planet's atmosphere?"
the soft, traitorous voice inside his head suddenly says.
And now Papa was suffering even more from it.
—no medal at all, would be devastating.  Both of Steve’s current sources of income, his endorsement deals with TYR and SwimOutlet.com, are dependent on him winning medals.  So if he doesn’t win medals, he doesn’t earn money.
"Uh huh," Peter said, in that little sing-songy
Because now, it technically hadn't.
"Mmm, not so probably," said Peter. "More like definitely. And mostly just 'cause his last name happens to be Stark."

"Mr Stark has agreed to commence repairs on Sergeant Barnes' prosthetic arm," JARVIS replied. "Apparently it suffered some damage during the battle in Miami."
"Was he okay?" demanded Tony. "Steve, was he hurt? Was he—?"
A second later the door to Bucky's simulator popped open and he poked his head out, eyeing Steve and Tony with an air of barely-concealed suspicious mirth as he climbed out.
Steve could certainly understand misery, even if he couldn’t understand how someone with Tony’s immense wealth and resources, and not to mention an absolutely precious son, could be so.
Peter let out a heavy sigh. It'd all fallen on deaf ears, just like he'd feared. "Yeah, I do. I'll go and get it."
"Of course it isn't, you're a good photographer," said Gwen. She reached for her backpack, pulling out her own phone. "Can you take one with mine now?"
"All right. Go ahead and run one more diagnostic and then get it uploaded, yeah? Both mine and Rhodey's suits."
, just get me ready and get inside me."
Another pause fell across the lab, with Tony unsure if he should be amused that there was apparently someone else out there who loved Star Wars as much as Peter, or disgusted by the fact that Peter's girlfriend just compared him to an ugly fictional spaceship.
level, not completely level, which in his mind should've been an automatic clue that he was innocent. Because if he in fact had been tampering with the tesseract with the intention of causing an explosion, the resulting fallout would've been massive enough to completely wipe Langara off the planet.
"You are quite welcome, Captain," said JARVIS. "Is there anything else I might do to help?"
“Do you want me to show you my breaststroke and backstroke too?” Peter asks.
was on a level of intelligence that Steve had never before seen, and was very, very impressive.
"Are we just s'posed to walk through it?" he asked Peter. "It's not gonna like, catch us on fire if we're not worthy or something, right?"
"Uh huh," Peter said, obediently heading over to his workstation and pulling out his trigonometry textbook. Steve had gone out with Bucky and Sam to run some errands, promising to bring Peter's favourite pizza home for dinner afterwards, so Tony headed over to his own workstation, slipping the vial of particles under his holographic projector.
And maybe, if he was lucky, his dads would be so impressed by what he had found that they wouldn't be as mad at him for disobeying.
"I will."
"Yeah, we have," Sam said as they swerved around another walker. "But the stadium's pretty big, so there's plenty of room for you too."
And for Steve, who had never, ever passed up an opportunity to demonstrate his love and affection for Tony, that was saying something.
"Very well, Master Peter. May I at least inquire as to what you are doing?"
“Sure is, bud,” Dad said.  “And put a hustle on it, yeah?  I’m double-parked.”
"You like that, don't you, baby?" Tony whispered as he did it again, waggling his eyebrows when Steve let out another moan. "Yeah, I know you do."
"Yep," she said. "And if you're not feeling well enough to go to school in the morning, just let me know and I can bring your homework to you."
For how different Steve and Tony were, they were very much alike in all of the ways that mattered most, not the least of which was their absolute devotion to their son. If anyone could understand Steve's need to physically see for himself that Peter was all right, it was Tony.
Fear seized Steve so strongly that he felt as if he were drowning again, that all of his blood was being replaced by frigid water and his lungs were transforming into massive blocks of ice. Tears stung his eyes, burning hot against his freezing cold flesh as he struggled to breathe in.
JARVIS was silent for a moment, which Tony knew from experience was never a good thing.
“Which I've always done,” said Tony.  “But—”
"Thank you, ma'am," Peter said from Steve's elbow. "But is he—is my dad gonna—?"
"All right," Steve said reluctantly. His beautiful full lips curled into a soft smile. "See you tonight?"
"Look, sweetheart," he whispered, jerking his head towards the anteroom. "They're all here to root for Peter."
"If he's not one of Thanos' minions, then I don't think we need to hear anymore about him, yeah?
"We will, I promise." Steve brushed his lips across Tony's in a soft, sweet kiss, trailing his thumb across his cheekbone. "Will you get some rest now? Please?"
