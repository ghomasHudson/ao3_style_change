“Very practical, Thad.”
“Hell, no.  In fact, I made up your room.  Just in case.”
So did this.
Steve shook his head.  “If you hadn’t been there…”
“Well,” Tony said, taking his hand.  “I did a lot of tossing and turning on this bed while you were gone.  Maybe I broke it in a little.”
“It’s good,” Howard said. “It’s very much a compliment.”
“Don’t call me that.  We’re fighting, remember?”
“They’ll be fine.  They’re all just taking a little nap.  They’ll all wake up in the morning fresh as daisies, right, sweetie?”
He couldn’t really blame heartbreak anymore for the lump in his throat.  It had been months now.  Six since Steve had been taken, three since their failed attempt to heal him.  He’d moved on.  Tried to, at least.  Gina was young and bright and fun.  They laughed a lot.  They drank a lot.  They fucked a lot.  Was that a quote, unquote normal relationship?  He didn’t know.  He didn’t love her, he knew that.  He liked her.  He liked spending time with her.  But that was pretty much it.  She wasn’t “the one”.  That was something he didn’t like to think about, because he was still pretty sure who that was.  Just because “the one” didn’t agree didn’t make it any less true.
“Tossing and turning alone?” Steve asked.
He pushed the 'Cuda up to 100, and everything flew by.  The trees, the derelict, pock-marked road signs. One startled deer bolted into the woods as he passed, and soon there were outlying farms.  Mailboxes on the side of the road. A few billboards. Then more houses, more buildings, and he was forced to slow down because there was a yellow sign that read "Children at Play", and no matter how badly he wanted to be at the hospital right this second, he would never do anything to endanger a child.
They splashed puddles all the way to the dog park, avoiding the sheets of water thrown up by the passing cars sometimes by the narrowest margins. The sky
“What?”
Steve nodded.  “I know.  Let’s just eat and go to bed, okay?  I’m tired too.”
know you are exactly what your mom needs right now.”
anything.  Steve was here.  Steve was home.  And a slightly higher water bill was the very last thing on Tony’s mind tonight.
“Sure thing,” she said, squeezed his shoulder again, and left.
“She was proud of you, Steve,” he said, and Steve lifted his head to look at him. “Yeah. She was. I mean, she missed you too. A lot. But she was so fucking proud of you. She still is.”
“Is this live?” Tony asked, his mouth suddenly very, very dry.
“Yes, Captain.”
Steve glanced into his eyes, then back down. “Yeah,” he said. “I know you wouldn’t. I would, though. And then you’d be upset that I was upset.”
. I live here now.”
“No apology necessary,” the Colonel said.  “Would you like to sit down?”
Tony shook his head. “
“Nevermind,” Tony said. “Forget I said that, okay? That wasn’t fair.”
“We’re not just ‘anyone’, Tony.”
Howard nodded a bit. He was holding his own cup of coffee, and he gestured to the table with it. “May I join you?”
“Nobody cares, baby,” Tony said, then tugged him closer to whisper in his ear. “Come watch the movie, and I’ll run you a bath afterwards.”
Sam put his hand on Steve’s shoulder again. “What’s going on?”
“We gotta go anyway,” Steve said, digging a leash out of his pocket and clipping it to Dodger’s collar.
He got up, made his bed like he had in the army, tight and smooth, then went through the room, setting it to rights as he did every morning.  Part of this routine came from the military, part came from his mother.  She’d liked everything neat and in its place.
Tony cocked an eyebrow.  “I don’t babysit you.”
Tony laughed, his own unique, natural laugh, and Steve smiled, relieved.  “Look, Tony,” he began, but Tony shook his head.
“Tony?”
“Huh?  Erskine?  What--” Then his legs were swept out from under him.
Steve shrugged self-consciously. “I don’t know. Sometimes, I guess.”
“I don’t give a fuck.  Get out of here.”
Tony trailed his finger up the column of Steve’s throat, humming a little as he undid his own belt. Steve heard it, the metallic clicking of the buckle, the whisper of a zipper, then the mattress dipped near his head, and he sucked in a breath in anticipation.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you at least going to kiss me good-bye?”
“Wilson,” Tony said in a little sing-song voice. “I know
“Have I told you how fucking proud I am of you for that?”
Hunt’s face cracked into a small smile.  “No, son, you misunderstand me,” he said.  “You’ve been given a pardon.  A full military and civil pardon.  Secretary Ross called me this morning himself.  You’re free to go.”
“I love you too, little red.”
Steve just sighed.  “Do you wanna sit down?”
“Guess so,” Steve agreed, then kissed the soft lobe of his ear. “Come on. Come in. Are you hungry? If I knew you were coming, I would have saved the meatloaf Mom made. Sorry. But I can make you a sandwich?”
“I’m sorry.”
“Uhh,” Tony mumbled, staring at his father. At least, he
Tony reached out and adjusted Steve’s pajamas, making sure everything was back where it belonged, then sat back on his haunches.
that mean?”
Tony rolled his eyes.  “I’m sorry,” he said, and yanked out of the soldiers’ hands.
“Steve. I told you. I have to work.”
“I’ve got you now,” Strange said.
.  Happy that someone finally made
“Hey,” he whispered, leaning down to kiss those red lips again. “Don’t worry, okay?” He peppered tiny kisses all over his mouth and jaw as he spoke. His hand drew soothing circles on the creamy skin of his side. “I’m going to make sure you get everything you want. Okay, Steve?”
Sam grasped his arm and Tony drew his eyes back to his. They were still soft, but there was a stern edge to them too. “Make up with him,” Sam said. “Or at least make friends again. If something
“What are you saying?” Tony asked.
Tony shook his head. “I wanted to take care of you this time, okay? Just let me have that.”
Steve nodded. “Okay, Tony.”
“They’ve got to leave the nest sometime, Steve.”
Tony watched until he was out of sight and started to go back to the dishes when a sleek black car came down the driveway.
Tony sighed and moved closer.  He reached up and traced the line of Steve’s jaw with one finger, then cupped the back of his head, tangling his fingers in his hair.  He looked him levelly in the eye.  Steve didn’t look away.
He squeezed Steve’s hands, passing his own warmth to Steve, then released one so he could cup his cheek, run his thumb across his cheekbone.  “I don’t know,” Tony said, softly now, matching his tone to his touch.  “I guess I just didn’t think--”
“Yeah,” he said, and a ghost of a smile flitted over his face.  “I know.”
Held him all night long.
“They would brighten the room.”
Steve glanced at him. “You did?”
“I couldn’t remember.”
“Yes, it is,” Tony replied and yawned.
Tony let his head fall back and rolled his eyes. “Set my sights higher? God. Can’t you just stop? I don’t want to talk about this anymore. I’m fucking tired-”
Not Bucky. Dugan.
“No.”
I'm trying to get this finished as fast as possible.  Hopefully, I will have the next chapter up tomorrow.  Proofing it now, but it's a hurried proof.  Forgive any mistakes.  No matter how long I live, punctuation will always be the bane of my existence.  It's a love/hate thing.  I heard a story once about Ernest Hemingway (I think it was Hemingway) going to get a drink at the end of the day.  The guy at the counter asks him what he's been doing all day.  Hemingway said he'd been working.  On what? the guy asks, and Hemingway says he was trying to figure out whether or not to leave a comma in place.  All day.  I feel you, bro.
Howard looked at his feet for a moment, then back up. His eyes were uncertain, almost...nervous? But that couldn’t be. Steve didn’t think there was any way that could be. Even when they’d seen each other at the hospital, Howard had been nothing but cool and collected even though he’d been suffering through chemo treatments at the time. But he didn’t look that way now.
Sam mimicked his posture. “He said he’d meet you after homeroom and then you two could make out in the janitor closet during lunch hour.”
“He’s smart.  He’s charming.  He’s
Tony turned in his arms and kissed his forehead sleepily. “Don’t worry,” he said. “‘Kay? Nothing to worry about.”
He was just glad he was home.
Nat gave him a final squeeze, then pulled back and looked at him with shining eyes. “Oh Tony,” she said, and there were tears in the corners of her eyes. “You guys are getting
“I’ll take a cab,” he repeated. “Later."
He pushed the love away. He could do that much, anyway. He pushed it away and just focused on the physical. Because that’s all this could be. That’s all he could give.
“The army laid some kind of claim on him when they found out.  They said Steve was their material way before he was an Avenger, so he belonged to them.”
“Fuck you.”
“Come on, it’s a good story,” Tony teased.  “Full of intrigue.  Secrets.”  Pause.  “Twins.”
At the end of his shift, Steve put it all away. He put away his knives, and his apron, and his thoughts. He put it all away. He had other stuff he had to attend to right now. Other stuff that needed his full attention.
Steve’s face eased immediately, as if invisible screws had been holding it up and they’d all been loosened a quarter of a turn.  He nodded.  “Yeah, yes, yes, that’s fine,” he babbled, and wheeled to the left.
“I don’t know,” Steve said, and shrugged his broad shoulders. “Didn’t feel like it at the time. It just felt like-” he paused, his forced smile faltering, “-anyway, I spent a lot of time studying. And training. And it was okay. It felt like what I should be doing, so when Nick came to me and told me I had to take some downtime, I didn’t want to. I wanted to keep working. Keep busy. You know?”
Steve’s already hard eyes grew harder still.  “Stop talking, Tony.  I didn’t come here to talk.”
He put his head in his hand.  “Last night…”
Tony put his hand on his knee. “What’s with you all of a sudden?”
He woke up twice during the night, but considering he had not slept at all the night before, he thought he was doing okay.
“Later.”
She fell silent and he lay in bed, waiting for her reply.  When she didn’t say anything, he sat up.  “FRIDAY?  Are you there, angel?”
Steve woke from a troubled sleep to the sound of his phone ringing. He rolled over, feeling slow and stupid with sleep and the evening heat.  He picked it up, saw Tony’s name, but before he could answer, it stopped ringing.
What the fuck?
Blood sheeted down his neck, his chest, pattering to the floor in great, huge drops.  Tony fell to his knees, grabbing the tablecloth with one hand and yanking it down.  Plates, silverware, the vase with FRIDAY’s daisies in it, all clattered to the ground.  Two glasses shattered unimportantly as Tony pressed the tablecloth to Steve’s throat.
“I know what happened last time, baby,” Tony pressed, “but it won’t be the same.  Doctor Strange is here to make sure everything stays healthy, and she’s just going to be looking, okay, she’s not going to
“Lie. You suck at lying.”
Tony nodded.  "That's all I remember, baby.  Just that."
Tony raised an eyebrow, and she matched him. He nodded, smiling. “Wow. Okay. Okay. You got it, momma.”
Almost.
“You’ll do everything you can to help me succeed,” Tony went on lifelessly. And why not? He’d left his life back at that fourth-floor apartment. “Because that’s what’s best for
“Look, Daddy!” she exclaimed, and pulled him forward while Steve paid the entrance fee, smiling at how excited she was.
The waitress brought him coffee and he dumped sugar into it.  “‘Untoward’?” he repeated, raising an eyebrow.  “That sounds very unsavory, Doc.  Do you think you can handle it?”
“We could have been hanging out at the beach right now if we’d gone to Cayman,” Clint pointed out. He cracked open a beer and passed it to Natasha who was lying on a lounge chair.
, finally, nibbling it, tonguing it, with Steve’s hand on the back of his head, and Steve’s breath in his ear.  “And then we see how many times I can make you come before one of us passes out.”
“That’s right, Captain Rogers.  You can go.”
Steve could almost hear that pouty lip. He wanted to suck on it. “I’m on my way.”
After Tony had gotten Steve settled in the car outside the prison walls, and they were on their way, he’d asked Steve what he wanted to do.
“So, what the fuck?”
"Good.  I want you."
“I know you will.”  She started away and he put a hand on her hip to keep her near.  “Nat,” he whispered, not quite meeting her eye, “thanks for last night.”
“Something funny?” he asked, taking his jacket off and throwing it onto the chair.
Tony came to stand in front of him, pushing the coffee table back out of his reach with his foot.
When they reached his floor, Tony pulled reluctantly out of Steve’s arms. Steve whimpered, and the sound went directly to Tony’s cock. “Come with me, baby,” he said softly, took his hand, and led him through the apartment to his bedroom.
Tony touched him gently, running his fingers over the pronounced ridges of his ribs, the concavity of his stomach, the jut of his hip-bones.  “My god, Steve,” he whispered, “what did you do to yourself?”
“Coffee?”
ten years, Steve! The ten that has me in it. If that’s what you want, anyway. Is that what you want?”
“It’s okay.”
Steve turned innocent, slightly puzzled eyes up to him.  “I thought you said we were roughing it?”
Steve’s eyes met his for the briefest of moments.  “Three times.”
He didn’t expect to see him. That was the thing.
Her eyes grew dark.  He remembered that look.  It was a dangerous look.  “I run our business, Tony.  And that has nothing to do with this.”
“It’s fine.  Sit down.  You look like you’re going to throw up.”
“And what do you want?”
“Why now?”
was the most natural thing in the world.
He wasn’t sure how it could be, but Tony’s eyes seemed to get brighter. He squeezed Steve’s hand again tightly, and didn’t loosen it. Steve could feel his fingers grinding together, but he didn’t mind. It was better, in a way. Grounding. Soothing. “Do you?”
“Okay.”
“I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry.”
“No.  I asked Patty.  She said he’d been hanging around the dumpsters the last couple days.”  Tony shrugged.  “I opened the car door and called him, and he jumped inside.  He wanted to come home with me.  Like he was just waiting for me.”
trouble…
Tony’s eyes snapped to his face. Steve was still looking up at him. His eyes still filled with that sweet innocence that Tony had grown to crave. “You did?” he asked, and there was no way he could keep that slight tremor out of his voice. No fucking way.
And--And--And--
Steve glanced up at him, smiled, then turned his attention back to his task. “Nah,” he said. “I’ll come. Don’t worry.”
Steve rolled his eyes.  “I’m
“It doesn’t suck,” Tony said, and came to lean over his shoulder and look at the paper.  “Really.  It’s good.  You’re doing good.”
“This is about
“As many times as it takes you to understand!”
Tony bristled, and Pepper laid her hand on his arm.  “I hope not,” she said.  “I just bought this dress.  I’d hate to ruin it.”
“Mom,” he said, distressed, but she waved him off with one hand, while the other rose to cover her mouth to keep in a sob.
Steve put his hand over Tony’s, holding it against his cheek, and stepped into him. “Yes,” he whispered. “Please.”
And that unlocked the floodgates.  Knowing he shouldn’t have an opinion, gave him a lot of opinions.  A mountain of opinions, a fucking avalanche of opinions.  “Oh, Pepper,
Some talk, and half a birthday
Strange sighed, a funny, considering look on his face.  Steve wondered if he could read minds and the blush got redder.
arms.
“Doing what?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Really?” Steve said. “In my mother’s kitchen, Sam? What the fuck?”
“Will you turn the music down, FRI?  To fifteen, please.  I still want to hear it, but I guess we shouldn’t drown out poor Brucie-bear, should we?  Especially since he looks like he’s a man on a mission.”
“Uh-huh,” Tony muttered. “You did. And I believe you, too.” He flicked a hand in Steve’s direction. “Or at least I would if you looked even the slightest bit sorry.”
Tony held onto his temper.  He
Tony sighed, his eyes straying to the photo on the nightstand.  Mrs. Ross laughing, Thaddeus smiling into her neck.  “I don’t want to think you’re an evil guy, Thad,” he said softly.  “But your priorities are fucked up and your vision is skewed.”
“She doesn’t know how to make his coffee, Captain,” FRIDAY said.  “She doesn’t go check on him in the lab.  Or fold his t-shirts with the design facing up so he can find his favorites easier.  Or help him catalogue his DVDs by genre, sub-genre, and body-count.”
Steve shook his head.  “I’m sorry.”
He had people in his life, sure, but when it came right down to it, he was alone.  Those people, no matter how much they loved him, all had
“Because
Steve kissed him again. “I love you, Tony.”
Tony stared after him.  His body was in turmoil, and suddenly, he didn’t seem able to get enough breath.  “Really?” he sighed, running a shaking hand through his hair.  “Fucking
Tony cleaned himself up a little, then started coffee.  When it was done, he poured a large mug, dumped in his customary three sugars, and went in search of his elusive Captain.  He didn’t call for him, he just wandered from room to room, searching.  He was in no rush.  He’d find him eventually.  Even with the addition, the cabin was only so big.
But now…
“Yeah. Really.”
“Hey.”
nen--his aura.  The feeling he gave off was safety and security and love.  It radiated off him.  Light personified.  And with him inside of Tony, he was alight, as well.  Steve shared his effulgence, and Tony took it in, let it change him, let it brighten the dark places inside of him, let it make him more than he’d ever been either alone or with anybody else.
wait.  He’d been jerking off to thoughts of Steve since they’d met, it wouldn’t be anything new to him, but soon, he wouldn’t have to.
Natasha looked at him.  It was one of those Rogues-only looks that Tony hated so much.  But he let it go on, let it happen without a word, praying Natasha could convey to him how important it was that he let Wanda take care of him.  What he was talking about--doing it the right way, putting the work in--was insanity.  Everyone in the room could see it except Steve.  So, let Nat give him a look, let her tell him with her eyes the way things were.  If it got the point across, then it was worth it.  Even if watching it made Tony feel like he was drowning in his own icy waters, and for him, there was no hope of a life preserver.
“I have some idea.”
old.  No, a gray hair or two didn't bother him.  He chalked his irritation up to the no-orgasm thing.  He really had been close.
Steve flexed his fingers.  “Thanks.”
, without a shadow of a doubt--if Morgan had not been with them, if Steve hadn’t promised stingrays, they would have left right that moment. Left and gone to either Tony’s apartment or his own, stripping clothing off, leaving a trail of shirts and shoes and jeans on the way to the bedroom. He could almost hear Tony gasping as Steve opened him up. Almost feel him clenching around him as he slid inside him, the tight heat like a dream made real.
“Jesus.”
“Was Morgan mad at me?” he asked.
Tony tensed in his arms, and turned his head so that if his eyes were open, he’d be able to see into Steve’s. They were still closed, though. His brow creased in a frown. Steve wondered if he thought he was dreaming. “What are you talking about, baby?” he asked, and his voice sounded like maybe he thought he was dreaming.
“Whatsit?” Only slurring a little.  That was still okay.
?” Tony asked, motioning to the holographic files.  “What do you have against him?”
Steve propped his forearm against the door, then dropped his head against it and reached back to touch Tony with his other hand, holding him in place, caressing his hair as best he could from the awkward angle. “Tony,” he breathed. “Oh my god, Tony. Please. Please don’t stop. Tony, please.”
.” He scrubbed a hand over his face, then turned a furious eye back at Steve. “And just in case you didn’t realize it, I
“No.  The chicken’s fine,” he answered, striving to keep his voice steady.  “It was good chicken.”
you?”
about it. Fought, talked, whatever. It all came down to the same thing--Pietro didn’t want to deal with him being in the army anymore.
She touched his cheek again, smoothing across his cheekbone with her thumb. “That’s the one regret I have,” she said. “That you didn’t get to know him. And that he didn’t get to know you. Didn’t get to see what an amazing man you’ve grown up to be.”
heard that?  Or was that just another part of the torture?  Just another way to inflict pain?
Tony guided the car to his old spot in front of Steve’s building. He shut it off. “We’re here,” he said. His voice had lost that cold sound. Now it was just quiet. Just sad.
He basked in it for a minute, then unable to stop himself, he asked, “Do
Tony glanced back at him, then looked back at the photograph hanging on the wall. Hanging there with the pictures of Steve, and Sam, and Steve’s father. Hanging there with the pictures of the Rogers family. And, god, it looked
“You’re a terrible liar.”
worried. Wanda had called him on the way home and said Steve hadn't gotten in touch with her all week.  Every time she called him, it went to voicemail.  She was scared.  Was everything okay?  Tony didn't know what to say.  He lied and said everything was fine.  Of course, he's fine, sweetie, he's just fine.
Tony left for the prison half an hour early just in case.  He was glad he did.  A repeat of last week’s arc reactor chat-fest happened.  He knew it would.  Part of him vaguely wondered if this was the army’s way of just getting info for their own purposes, and decided he was done talking.  Next week he’d tell them to fuck off.  He was on tape now.  Two thirty-minute sessions.  They could watch those when they had a hard-on for Stark tech.  He was done whoring it out for free.
Tony sunk his teeth lightly into the back of Steve’s hand.  “You’d
“Thanks.”
Disappointment moved through him.  “Oh,” Tony said.  “I’m sorry.  I gave it to Jeff.  I’ll have him show it to you.”
“I think it’s great.”
He got out of the car and stood looking up at the building for a moment while the taxi’s taillights dwindled in the distance. There was a soft light coming from the fourth floor window. His mom was up there. Dodger. Tony was up there too. His people. His family. He missed Morgan terribly, but he had made his peace with that. It would be okay, as long as he got the other three--even though he selfishly wished she was here too.
“Yeah, um...well…”
“You don’t have to tie me up, Tony.”
Steve comes home
, stewing over it, going over and over it in his head.  Lying in an anonymous motel bed with a neon sign outside the window or bunking down in some shifty-eyed acquaintance’s attic, sometimes it was
Tony must have thought so too, because his own smile faltered a bit. That uncertain look came back. "Um," Tony began, then cleared his throat, scratched his forehead. "How are you?"
They finally pulled into the bus depot at ten o’clock. He’d texted Tony after the flat tire and told him he’d take a cab home since he had no clue when he would actually be getting into town. Tony texted back a sad-face emoji and one word--
“You look good,” Steve said.  Because that was what you said, wasn’t it?  When you saw an ex in public?
He broke the kiss at last.  “FRIDAY?” he said, then closed his eyes as Tony’s lips touched his jaw.
Tony kissed him again.  "Has Shuri-?"
“Nothing like that?  No lapses like that?”
“Show me.  Show me how much.”
Tony grunted, his hand trailing down Steve’s shoulder to his wrist and back again.  “I see your point.  It is a little impersonal.”
“The one with or without the--what was it you called them? Assless pants?”
“What are you talking about, Sam?”
care about the equally startled look on Morgan’s face, the wide, shocked eyes, the mouth not knowing whether to laugh or cry. But Steve had stopped in his tracks, had turned back toward him, and for the second time that day, Tony was struck by an eerie similarity in expression shared by his daughter and the man he used to love.
He stripped his shirt off and kicked off his shoes. He should shower. He knew he didn’t smell very good. But he couldn’t stand to not be touching Tony for one more minute. One more second.
He sat quietly, just drinking his coffee, and when he heard the keys in the door, he looked expectantly up as Sarah came in. Their eyes met, and she drew in a shocked breath. “Tony,” she said.
“What?”
“I should have come back.”
Tony could see his sanity flitting around in the metaphorical rafters, and he made a grab for it. He caught it too. Just barely. Just by the tail. But he held onto it with a vicious strength. “Have, um,” he began, then cleared his throat and started again. “Have you done this before?”
“I don’t know.  Sometimes when we’re in the same room she gives me this
“I want me home too,” Steve said, and the soft laughter in his ear made him smile even more.
Howard’s face stayed friendly and open as he said, “Because I’d like you to come work with us.”
The look Howard gave him was the most disappointed look he had ever received. He hated it. Feared it, and hated it. “Then you’re only proving just how selfish you really are,” Howard said. His lips twisted into a sad smile. “That’s the same decision I made, Steven. And I can tell you right now, if I had made a different one, Maria would probably be alive right now. She’d be with someone else. But she’d be alive.”
Steve pulled away.  His eyes were shining, his tears already beginning to fall.  Tony's lips curved up in a tiny, tired, happy smile. Steve took his hand and kissed his wrist again.
“Well, maybe not as much as when I was twenty, but I still do okay,” he said and put plates on the table.  “Lucky for you.”
“You’ve been working so hard,” Tony said, kissing his temple.  “I’m so proud of you.”
They met on the stairs, Steve halfway down, Tony halfway up.  Steve had discarded the sweater he’d had on when they went to the bowling alley, but he was still wearing his t-shirt and jeans.  Just a plain t-shirt, a soft-looking heather gray.  Tony wanted to touch it.  Wanted to run his hands all over it, but he resisted.
When he woke up the second time, it was to a weight on his chest. Heavy, but not too heavy. Just the right amount of heavy. The perfect amount of heavy. And the heavy was moving just a little. Breathing. Touching him. A hand scratching short nails lightly over his sides, his chest, his throat. Just soft little touches. He shivered and the heavy laughed quietly.
“I love you,” he breathed, as his hands slipped under Tony’s shirt.  “I love you so much, Tony.  I’ve never loved anything the way I love you.”
late, after all.  “I’m sorry,” he said.  “We went out for a drink after practice.  I should have called.”
Tony looked sad all day.
Steve rolled his body off of Tony’s, but did not move away. He curled himself tightly against his back instead, holding him against his chest. “I’m not leaving you alone,” he said into his ear. “I’ll never leave you alone.”
“Why, then?”
Tony drug himself further back until he hit the wall.  He shoved himself against it, gasping air in, coughing it out again.  “Steve,” he said, his voice a grating whisper.  “Steve, it’s me.  Tony.  Tony Stark, baby, look at me.”
Tony stretched in his lounge chair, shivering just the tiniest bit. He’d gotten out of the pool an hour ago after he and Happy had lost--rather unfairly, he thought--to Clint and Nat in a chicken fight, and had been sitting there ever since.
He downed it and got out another one.
“Sorry,” he said.  “I didn’t want to do that today.  I wanted this to be a good day.  I’m sorry I ruined it.”
“What?”
She wiped her lipstick off his cheek with her thumb, then turned to Howard. “Have a nice day, Mr. Stark,” she said.
The smile was back.  The all-exasperating one.  “Oh, that’s right.  When you two big, strong men started fighting over
“Is that so?”
It was harder when it was someone else’s blood, though.
“And I know you,” Tony went on, holding his hand tighter. “We haven’t talked in a while, but I know you. You always put everybody ahead of yourself. Everybody. Your mom. Sam. Me. Fucking
“I’m sorry,” Steve said, looking at the ground. “I didn’t think you’d be here. I was just leaving you a message.”
“You need a ride?”
“They’re like those annoying nerdy kids in high school who knew every answer and got 110% on every quiz.  God, I
Tony kept his hand in Steve’s hair, kept petting him until his breathing evened out and he was asleep.  It didn’t take very long.  Steve fell asleep easier now, stayed asleep longer.  His nightmares were less frequent, less violent when they did come.  Tony felt an intense satisfaction in that.  In knowing that he was part of the reason Steve finally slept soundly through the night.  It was probably wrong to feel that way, to take personal pride in something that really only boiled down to a physiological need, but, who gave a fuck?  Steve used to have profound, scream-inducing night-terrors.  Now, he did not.  Tony didn’t think he was the
He sat at the same table, but his cute little girlfriend was absent.  Shame, really, he felt like they’d bonded.  Then the door buzzed, he looked up, and all thought was driven out of his head.
.  Just in the heartbeat before he stood up and walked away, just after he’d told Steve it was his call.  What might Tony have done if Steve had reached out and put his hand on Tony’s hip as he’d done with Natasha?  Would his word of whispered thanks have brought about the same result from Tony as it had with Nat?  What would Tony’s fingers feel like on his cheek?  What would his mouth feel like on his?
coming back, right?”
And he was.  It was the first time their friends would be here since Steve had come home.  Their first time seeing each other again.  Steve wandered around the house, arranging, then rearranging the table, the chairs, the books in the case, even.  He was making Tony anxious, but he didn’t say anything.  Steve was just excited.  And maybe a little nervous.  Tony was too.  Right down to the nerves.  But he didn’t show it.  One of them needed to stay calm.  Tony could do that.  For his best guy, Tony could do anything.
Steve took his hand out of his pocket and laced his fingers together with Tony’s. “How do you feel now?”
“How we looking, FRI?” he asked, digging an egg roll out of the bag.  “No accidents or anything?”
JULY, THURSDAY 9:00 PM
“Why’d he do it, man?” Sam asked.
“It’s nothing,” he said, and nodded toward the stairs. “Let’s go.”
Steve nodded and put his chin back onto his knees. “Yeah. For a certain kind of person. I do.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam had told him once that meetings helped.  People with shared experiences talking out their feelings helped.  Fear.  Denial.  Survivor’s guilt.  He sat in on a few a week--there was no shortage of them, not now--and listened while person after person told different versions of the same story.
“How’s the hypno-whatsits going?”
Steve shook his head, keeping his eyes on the bandages.  “No.  It’s okay.”
“Would you please not remind me of that?” Tony said quietly, and Strange nodded.
“Tony.”
Dodger didn’t make any more noise, and Steve pet him for a few more minutes, just giving him the attention he deserved for being the best dog ever. When he finally stood up, Dodger followed him into the kitchen to the food bowl he had by the sink now. He looked at Steve, then the bowl, cocking his head in a very clear way. Steve laughed again and gave him a treat from the box in the cupboard. Dodger wolfed it down while Steve drank a glass of water, rinsed his glass, and sat it in the sink.
Steve bowed his head, bit his full, red lower lip.  His brow furrowed as he thought, but when he turned to face Tony finally, the only thing on his face was a determined resolve.
Steve raised one shoulder in a half-hearted shrug. “Just testing a theory.”
Steve’s eyes flicked over to where Mr. Stark stood in the car door. “You don’t have to go with him,” he said. “You can stay here. My mom will let you. I can ask her.”
“You good?”
“Well, okay,” he said, as if relenting.  As if he would not have said yes to anything and everything this man in his arms wanted.  “But only if I get to pick the restaurant.”
.  Had still looked the same, talked the same, acted the same as the man he had known for so long.  The only difference was the smile when he saw Tony, the shy, intimate way he reached for his hand, the eyes that suddenly seemed deeper than they had before.  But those things, however different, had still felt
“Don’t call me Thad.”
“No, man,” Sam said.  “
It didn’t seem like there were enough words for whatever there was between them. Or maybe there were too many. In either case, neither said anything. They just looked at each other.
Steve felt his heart thump in his chest. There weren’t tears. He thought he’d cried all the tears he had over the last while, but his heart. That thump of his heart. “Do you think so?” he asked.
Tony put his hand on Steve’s chest, curled his fingers into his shirt. “I like your house,” he said quietly, tipping his face up, his other hand slipped up Steve’s arm to the side of his neck. He touched the cords there, loving the smooth slide of his muscle under his thumb. He urged him down with a gentle touch, and Steve came easily, willingly.
-likes you. He’s got a crush.”
“You let my dad pick up the check.”
“I know. But I hear there’s a party the next night. And an optional sleepover afterward. Right?”
he thought, kissing him.
this. “Sorry for interrupting your party. It won’t happen again, sir. I’ll make sure Tony gets-”
Steve sat that way with Tony’s hand in his, just taking it in, marking it, and over the years that followed, after the Sokovia Accords, after Berlin, after Bucky and Siberia, when he and the rest of the Rogues went on the run, he would sometimes think about the way Tony’s hand had felt in his.  He would think about the tiny, brave heat that lived between their palms.  He would think about it and wonder, if he could undo everything that had happened, just erase it all so he could feel that touch again for real, even for one moment, if he would do that.
“Is he in there?” Tony asked.
Sometimes it was fine.  They’d known each other for years now, and were well used to each other’s idiosyncrasies.  Steve got up too early.  Went for a jog--no real runs yet, the marathon runs of yesteryear were still beyond him--ate, cleaned, drew, read book after book after book, watched movies.  He was currently working his way through the Brat Pack era.  He had a thing for Molly Ringwald and absolutely no patience for Andrew McCarthy.  The viewing of “Pretty in Pink” had ended in an hour-long tirade after which he swore he was done with the entire genre.  “The Breakfast Club” brought him back.  On a trial-basis, at least.  He started working out again, too.  At Tony’s urging, he took over the loft area as his own, and turned one corner of it into a gym.  He was still a light sleeper most nights, and sometimes, lifted or pounded sandbags until four or five in the morning, took a cat-nap, then went for his run at six.
Tony’s eyes went to the clock on the microwave.  11:23.
“Promise?”
Tony placed his hand gently on the back of Steve’s neck.  His hair had grown a little longer and Tony ran his fingers through it.  “Did you think you were going to be immortal?” he asked.  His voice was soft but genuinely curious.
Steve frowned, pouting a little. “Really?”
Startled, Tony turned and saw Sam standing beside him. He was surprised. Sam hadn’t talked to him much over the past couple of weeks, and Tony didn’t blame him. He was Steve’s friend. Of course he’d be on his side.
“You had to hit him?”
“What?”
Tony lay on his side, his head pillowed on Steve’s firm bicep. Steve’s other arm was around him, holding him tight to his chest. Tony could feel his breath against the back of his neck, feel his heat, the angular planes of his body that were so different from Pepper’s lean curves. He could hear a clock ticking, the sound of Steve’s easy respiration, and that was all.
The first few moments were a frenzy of lips and teeth and tongues, as they tried to fit years into their mouths.  Steve’s arms were like steel, holding Tony in place, pinning him beneath his body.  Tony’s hands were restive, running incessantly over Steve’s hair, his face, his shoulders, touching everywhere they could reach, leaving fire in their wake.
he kissed that mouth?  He should have been keeping track, recording every time he’d touched those lips, ran his fingers through that hair.
“Oh, and let’s not forget ‘criminal’.”
“Vision?”
So, instead of saying
Natasha took his hand.  Steve was waiting but his shallow respiration said he wouldn’t be waiting much longer.  A scientist would have said it was the serum that had kept him alive this long, but Nat knew that wasn’t entirely the case.  Any normal man would have died the instant Thanos laid hold of him, but Steve wasn’t a normal man.  He never had been.  Dr. Erskine had seen that.  Steve had been crushed, his insides turned into a thick soup, his body nearly torn in two, and still he held on.  That wasn’t all the serum, though.  It was
The simplicity of the words shook Steve’s resolve to the core.  He wanted nothing more than to stay.  Or better yet, take Tony with him up to his room and to his bed, but he couldn’t.
“No, don’t you dare say that,” Tony said, putting his finger over Steve’s lips. “Don’t you dare say it’s not a big deal. It is, baby. It’s a huge deal.”
“I know.”
“Don’t you dare.”
people too.  Other people or other priorities, something that would keep them from his side while he lay dying.  It was okay.  He understood.  But it still hurt.  The being alone part.
Steve’s eyes narrowed, frowning in concentration, trying--longing--to be convinced. “Do you think so?”
Steve ran his hand through Tony’s hair.  “I’ve never been happier in my whole life.”
“It was one of the things that got me through,” Steve said, putting his hands in his pockets. “Over there. Sometimes I’d make up little stories in my head about coming back up here with you. Building a fire on the shore. Roasting marshmallows, like you said. Going for a walk into the woods back there.” He sighed. “And it was always July. No matter what time of the year it was
“That’s why?  That tiny bit of coding?”
Steve opened his eyes again.  “Well, what?”
He bowed his head, long dark hair falling in his eyes.  His hand--his human hand, the one made of flesh and blood--hovered just above Steve’s chest.  “I don’t know what to do,” he whispered.
Tony's eyes fell closed.
you done it in the dark?”
Steve blushed, burying another laugh in the curve of Tony’s neck, and suddenly Tony was no longer angry. He was actually quite grateful. If this was the consequence for Clint’s bad behavior, Tony hoped he’d never be good again.
?" Pepper cried shrilly.  "How could you let this happen?"
Tony laughed again.  Tears were in his eyes, but these were good ones.  These ones he could handle.  “Can I be there, do you think?  When he tries to walk the first time?”  He put his head in his hand, grinning and weeping in the Tower kitchen.  “I’d love to see that.  I’d love to see
A tight smile flitted over Howard’s features. “Mr. Barker’s chairs aren’t very comfortable,” he said. “I don’t blame you.”
“Sarah got me a coloring book,” she said. “And I helped Wanda make papri-something.”
So, they touched more, they laughed more, they fucked more, they fought more, they did everything they could to distill
Steve nodded and let his mouth play over Tony’s.  “Okay.  I love you.”
"Anytime I want?  That's a dangerous amount of power you're giving me, Rogers."
Steve looked back and locked eyes with Tony.  He gripped his hands and held them tight.  “I could show you instead.”
“God, I hope so.”
he told himself.
Sure, he may not have had much occasion to do it lately, but that didn’t mean he wanted to be fired from it. Or pass it on to someone else. Or watch that someone else do it. Or
Tony turned Steve’s palm to his mouth and kissed his wrist.  There was blood there, outlining the bracelets of fortune, but he did it anyway.  He would do it every day, every hour, for the next hundred years if he could.
“All better,” he said.
“Oh yeah,” Tony agreed.  “Nick said he hit the roof.  But, technically, they were right, so they’ve got him for now.”  He shrugged and peeled a little of the label from his bottle.  “It seems like a whole ‘who’s dick is bigger’ kind of thing.”
“Yeah,” he chuckled. “We’ll see how it goes.”
“Are you sure?”
This one's a little long. But there's a lot of ground to cover. This is the last chapter of the "high school" portion of the story. Next one will start to delve into the "adulthood" section. None of those will be as in-depth as the high school, but they'll each be an important moment for our guys.
“That’s good.”
Steve laughed a little, just a puff of breath between his lips.  “I didn’t get much practice.  There was really only one guy I ever wanted to ask.”
, then put his finger back to his lips and raised his eyebrows.
“Give me a break.  I’d never really done it before.”
a man on a mission. Because he was. In a way. He’d called it an ‘errand’ when talking to Sam, but in his head, it was a mission. Something he had to do. Something he’d been tasked with. An order from someone higher up than he. And he knew how to follow orders. He knew that if he knew nothing else.
“So, you’re on your way, huh?” Steve asked. He drew an arrow on the ground with his toe.
“That is crazy sharp.”
Steve looked at him, shocked.  “At ease, soldier,” he said faintly.
currently taking up real estate in his head. He could almost feel it in there, slipping around the corners of his mind like a snake through the tall grass, and he wanted to try and get it out. He didn’t want to take it back to the Tower with him.
the one who knew the answer, so you’re just as bad.”
He pushed the thought roughly away.  It would happen.  Steve was getting better, was getting stronger, and it would not be long before he would be able to indulge in that fantasy, in all of the fantasies he’d had about Steve over the years, but for now, just having him here, his arms around him, his breath in his mouth, his tongue firm and decisive was enough.  More than enough.
Tony ran a hand through his hair, then gestured between them.  “This.  This is wrong.”
Tony gave the cat another cuddle, then sat him gently on the nearest table.  He slid his arms around Steve’s trim waist and pulled him closer.  “He only outranks you in title, baby.
“What are you doing out here?”
Steve let Tony help him over to the wall and leaned against it.  He drew his knees up and crossed his arms over his chest, making himself as small as possible.  Tony sat across from him, legs outstretched, leaning on a pillar.
She shrugged.  “It’s a family trait.”
Tony closed his eyes, lay his forehead against Steve’s chest again.  He didn’t want to say it.  He had to say it.  “I don’t want to fuck this up,” he said, voicing his deepest fear aloud.
Steve bent and put his mouth against Tony’s ear.  His breath tickled, and Tony shuddered against his chest.  “I know how it works, Tony,” he said.
“A little.”
“You don’t, though, Tony,” he said.  “You’re fine without me.”
“Or we would have gotten here a lot sooner.”
, he thought, and slumped a little, making himself smaller, making himself as invisible as he could.
Steve went.
That meant Steve’s house was empty. That meant they’d be alone.
“Really?”
See you all soon! Ish.
Tony climbed up into his lap and put his arms around his neck, hugging him. “In a minute, baby,” he said, smoothing his hair behind his ear. “Just let me hold you, okay? I need it.” He kissed Steve’s temple, squeezed him tight, and Steve wrapped him in his arms and crushed him against his chest.
“Steve?” And her voice was still like a queen. She still held herself like a queen. “Are you alright, honey?” She put her hand on his back.
In the lab.  Of course, he was in the lab.  Where else would he be?
Tony shrugged, but pride swelled in his chest.  He’d remembered.  Tony hadn’t been sure he would.”
“Maybe...not.”
Steve took his apron off and tossed it aside. “Frank, I’m taking my break now.”
So, here it is. It's funny that this entire story evolved from a single scene I thought of one day...and that scene didn't even end up in the story! I have a hard time writing endings. I never know when to stop, but this seemed like the place. It's not perfect--they never are--and I'm not in love with it--I never am--but I hope you like it. Thank you for reading!
That tiny, pleased smile. “It wasn’t my finest hour.”
There was really only one way to find out.
He turned abruptly back toward the Tower.  Wanda would be in town by nine.  Shift change was at eleven.  Rounds right after.  By one, things should be settled and relatively quiet.

“I feel like there’s a joke there, but I’m not sure if this is the right time or place.”
“Cool!  Can I get a picture?”
Especially since he could feel him now. Feel him getting closer.
wasn’t the cutest thing Tony’d seen in awhile, he didn’t know what was.  “They just told me to come over here and check up on you and make sure you were okay.”
“Yes,” Steve whimpered.  “Yes.  He’d been developing a drug.  Ross knew about it.  He might have bankrolled it.  I don’t know all that part.  But, he administered it during our sessions.  He--Tony, please keep going.  Please.  I need it.  I need you, Tony, please.”
“Just the broad strokes.”
“Besides, all I really care about is you,” Tony said, and now he did shake him a little.  “And it’s not just ‘a couple stupid classes’.  What you’re doing, Steve...God, it’s amazing.  It literally amazes me.”
Steve pushed the thought gently away and opened the door, steeling himself for a long, lonely night.  He’d left the bed tightly made this morning, but now the blankets were rumpled.  A bare shoulder and a lock of hair peeked out from beneath them.  Steve’s breath caught in his throat as she shifted then stilled again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Okay. In the interest of that, I’m going to tell you that I definitely don’t want you to go. Emphatically not. Okay?”
He nodded, and followed Sam and Natasha out the front door. The booking officer gave him a little wave. "Good luck, kid," he said, and Tony couldn't help smiling a little at that.
Steve nodded slowly. He was frowning. He couldn’t help it.
“That’s what you wanted to do, wasn’t it?”
“Are you okay?” Tony asked. He was working the buckle on Steve’s belt now, doing it with such thoughtful deliberation, then slowly slipping it from around Steve’s waist.
Tony shook his head a little, dismissing it.  “So, if you’re not armed, I guess you didn’t ask me out here to kill me?”
Steve looked at him, anger and guilt bright in his eyes.  Tony was thrilled to see it.  Thrilled to have anything take the place of that cold emptiness.  Even if Steve left, as long as he left feeling
think about it.  Do you?”
Tony shrugged. He knew they wouldn’t. His father had said three years.
A moment later, there was a return pattern:  -. .- -
Steve laughed.  Tony smiled as he rummaged in the cupboard for candles and sat them on the table.  “There wasn’t any summer camp for guys like me, Tony,” he said.  “Least not back then.  I guess now they do stuff like that for the poor kids, but we were left to shift for ourselves back then.”
Steve wordlessly drew their still-clasped hands nearer, curling them close enough to kiss Tony’s knuckles.
“Oh, I beg to differ.  Do you want to see the credit card receipts?  FRI, pull up the VISA account.”
Steve raised an expectant eyebrow.
Once Jerry levelled the jet out, he came on the intercom.  “We’re up, Mr. Stark.  You can move around now.  ETA five hours, twenty-one minutes, if this tailwind holds out.”
Tony smiled.  Balance was restored.  He took his wallet out of his pocket.  “Here, kid,” he said, pawing through it.
“I saved you after that.  That cancels the other out.  Now I’ve only got to worry about you.”
“I promise.”
Tony touched his wine glass, running his finger around the rim, his eyes finding Steve’s over the flickering candles.  “Have we ever done this?”
“Tony--”
the night before, and they both seemed at a loss as to what to read next.
So this took a long time. I'm not 100% happy with it, but I had to get it out of my hands. I rewrote it many times. Way too many times.
“Hey, Thad.  How’s things?”
Tony sighed harshly. “
“Okay.”
He looked at it, at her, the dark eyes, the pale skin.  Steve remembered seeing her for the first time, the drop in his stomach.  She’d been there when he’d went into Howard’s machine, her voice had been the last good thing he’d heard before he dropped the Valkyrie into the ocean.  He’d been afraid to go see her when he’d heard she was still alive all those years later, but he wouldn’t trade those hours sitting by her bedside for anything.
“See you in a few days?”
“I’ll see you in the morning?”
“I will.”
Tony nodded, stole a glance at Steve.  “Maybe.”
He shook Tony’s hand, then Steve’s, tipping him a wink then headed out the door into the cold night air.
Steve gave him a small, distracted smile.  “I’m nervous.”
Tony sighed.  “Okay,” he said, giving in.  “I guess we’re talking about this.  Yeah.  Okay?  I mean, I knew he’d liked me for a while.  At least, he alluded to it a little.  Sometimes.”
he said, and Steve laughed.  "Get to work."
For two years, Tony had not been the one sharing his bed and sharing his life.  It had been Natasha, Sam, and Wanda who had been there for that.  Nat, Sam, and Wanda who had been with him, ate dinner with him, talked to him, laughed with him, bandaged his wounds after combat, helped him with his uniform when he was too sore to do it alone.
scaring is Bucky, and I don’t know if it’s because you’re basically the same person, or if you just put on a better show for him.”
Dreamlessly.  For once.
you.” He kissed him again. “Fuck, baby, I want you. I want you with me. I always want you with me. That’s all I’ve ever wanted. To be with you, to have you with me--with us. Forever. I love you.”
.  “Did daddy scare you?  Yelling like that?  Poor thing.”
“So, you punch me in the face?”
was wet. He didn't think he could get much wetter.
Steve kissed him again. “Okay,” he murmured, and left it at that.
“Hey.” And the word was past his lips before he’d even so much as tasted it on his tongue.
And he found himself nodding. “Okay, Sam,” he said, his head in his hands. “Okay.”
Steve shrugged.  “It’s a little clumsy.  The proportion of the tire isn’t quite right.”
I wasn't going to write this. I was just going to skip right to the birthday, but I was feeling like a big, old sap and couldn't resist it. It's short, because it's not really super important. It's mostly just a little bit of relationship-building and normal morning stuff, but occasionally, I am a sucker for that kind of thing, and I guess today is one of those kinds of days.
“Tony said she’s nice.”
Tony nodded. He inched closer to Steve, held his hand tighter. “When I was finally able to, I ran over to her. She was starting to move by then. She started taking in these big gasps of air, and crying.” He shook his head again. “She said my name. Or, like,
Tony flipped onto his side, staring at his face with incredulous, shocked eyes. Steve’s own eyes were still closed. The little smile was still on his face, but now it was satisfied in an entirely different way. Almost sly. “You’re not funny, Rogers,” Tony said, and the smile got wider.
“No, it’s true.  I would’ve--” he swallowed again, “--died a hero.  That’s what I was meant for.  That was my moment.”  His face was soft but undeniable.  “You should have let him kill me.”
“He’s not wrong,” Tony said.
Steve’s head snapped to the side, snapped to the sound of Tony’s voice like it was a siren-song on the open sea. He straightened his back unconsciously, standing taller, shoulders back, not noticing the way Sam rolled his eyes, smiling a little, and rubbed his temples.
“It was freaky, Tony.”
“I know.”  He wheeled into the kitchen and turned the oven on.  “What religion is that, anyway?”
He gripped the wheels of the chair and reversed it out the door.  The wheel squealed against the doorframe as it stuck, but Steve shoved harder.  It popped free and he spun around and left the room.
“I love you.”
Even if they never talked about it.
“Why didn’t we land at the Compound?”
Steve laughed softly, then kissed his neck again. “Not really.”
“Yeah.”
“Steve!” Nat cried, shaking him.
But after three months, the cars were done.  The speed boats stopped appearing on the lake.  The City Council and The Lions only met once per month.  The bed felt too big with just him in it, and there were never very many dishes to wash.  He still enjoyed the bowling, but sometimes the guys brought their wives or their girlfriends to watch.  It was hard being the only guy without somebody on the team.  Hard being the only guy without somebody, period.
“Yeah, baby?” Breathless, now. Quickened to the point of extinction.
Steve folded Tony’s fingers into his own, removing them from the frame, and held them against his chest. Tony could feel his heart beating. Pounding beneath his hand. “I don’t want to talk about that,” Steve said quietly. “Not right now.”
“No.  I’ll think about you.  About this.”
“Exactly what is that supposed to mean?”
“Oh yeah,” Tony went on, encouraged.  “I’ve got tons of Steve-stories.  You’ll love it.”
Steve raised his hands in silent surrender.
Steve held his ground.  He had no idea what time it was.  No idea what day.  Time in the hole was non-time.  They brought him his meals, but he often slept through them and simply ate it cold when he woke up.  Sometimes, he had the suspicion he’d slept through two meals.  Unless the army had started serving oatmeal three times a day.  Which could be.  He wasn’t really sure.
He’d felt it before, of course.
Steve opened his eyes.  His hand stole out and touched a hole in Tony’s shirt.  Black Sabbath, this time.  Steve hadn’t even tried listening to them, but the shirt he remembered very well.
He groaned and tossed his pen down, rubbing his face with heavy hands.
“Can I have it?” Tony asked.  “When it’s done?”
“Don’t tell me to--whoa, what’s with all the encryption?  Are those firewalls?  What are you hacking into?”
“I don’t
“And Nat. And Clint.”
Tony sat up straight. “But
Steve’s eyelids fluttered and he writhed on the ground.  More blood flowed.  Nat pressed a hand against the gash, trying to staunch the flow, and Steve cried out.  His fingers scrabbled on the grass, pulling out double handfuls.  Under his breath, a guttural sound escaped his lips.
“Baby?” Gently. He said it as gently as he could.
“Steve?” Sarah called from the kitchen.
“Your rooms are just how you left them,” FRIDAY said.  “We’ve had them cleaned and made up with fresh sheets, but all of your things are still there.”
Steve closed the blinds, putting New York in the dark.  “You going back down to the lab?” he asked.
Didn’t matter. This was fine. It was
, he thought, and for once, that dark voice of self-hatred agreed.
, he thought as he pressed his mouth to hot skin, as he let his tongue slip over smooth muscle, his hands touching, caressing.
Tony closed his eyes. “I wish that was true.”
“I’m tired of saying it,” Steve complained, rinsing off his toothbrush and putting it back into the holder on his side of the vanity.  He folded his towel neatly and laid it down next to it.  Tony’s side was a jumble of products, face cream, hair gel, cologne.  His razor sat precariously close to the edge, the charger unplugged and useless, in the corner.  Steve restrained himself from tidying it.  They’d come to an uneasy compromise:  Steve wouldn’t touch Tony’s stuff, and Tony wouldn’t encroach on Steve’s side.  They’d come to this arrangement after a fight over an improperly-capped tube of toothpaste and it had held up so far.
“Like I said, fuck my life.”
“‘Bout damn time.”
“We should limit Clint’s involvement too. Laura and the baby need to be his priority.”
Steve smiled a little, holding her close to his heart. “Well, not a superhero,” he said, “but protecting people is part of it, I guess, yeah.”
A special soul was taken from us a couple days ago. I obviously didn't know him other than through his work, but I feel like a member of our family was lost, and a piece of our collective heart went with him. Thank you for giving us a hero and a man we could look up to, Chadwick Boseman. You will be forever loved and missed.
She nudged him with her toe. “Shut up. Go put my laundry away, then come back here. You had something to talk to me about, remember?”
But just as he was beginning to analyze Bruce’s strange behavior, he heard the front door open, and the familiar
She nodded, quick and light.  Her own tears were falling, catching the light from the bulb and shining like diamonds.

Steve cocked an eyebrow. “Old?”
each other
Steve’s hand found its way to Tony’s belt loop.  His finger curled into it and Tony made a sound dreadfully close to a sob.  He wound his hand into Steve’s hair and kissed him deeply.
Tony turned his head.  A girl was standing next to him, threading her arm through his, kissing his cheek.  Part of him thought he should know who she was.  The rest of him had no fucking clue--
“Are you sure?”
“Get to it, baby.”
“Yeah, well, maybe your father knows more than I gave him credit for. Maybe he was right about everything all along.”
(See the end of the chapter for
knew,” Steve said.
Tony tried hanging on to his irritation, but just couldn’t.  Adorable-Bruce was too much.  He grabbed him and squeezed him tight instead.  “You’re forgiven.  I can’t stay mad at you.  Especially not today.”
.” He ran his hand through his hair again. “And, anyway, it’s what Pietro wants, and-”
“Are you kidding,” Jeff laughed.  “I wouldn’t miss it.  Especially if Miss Romanov here will save me a dance.”
“Um,” he said, and put an awkward arm around May’s waist.  “I thought Pepper told you.”
Steve touched her hair. “I’m glad.”
“‘Kay. Let’s do it, then.”
She gripped his hand tightly and leveled him with her stern-Mom look. “Just because you’re not a kid anymore doesn’t mean you get to ignore what I say.”
“Let’s go up to the roof.”
Meanwhile, the next morning...

“Hey.”
He left the bathroom, went back to the bed and pulled the blanket up over Tony’s shoulder. Before he left, he moved it back down, kissed the warm skin there, then covered it back up again. Tony didn’t move. Steve smiled a little. He loved the way Tony looked while he slept. He could count on one hand the number of times he’d actually seen it, but it was one of his favorite things. Something he could live the rest of his life thinking about and never feel like there had been a second wasted.
When the sun started to go down, and the heat started to leach away, he’d grabbed the sweater he’d chucked on the back of a chair last week, and yanked it on, then went and sat by the pool and stuck his feet in. It was warm. Heated to a perfect eighty-one degrees. Warm enough to keep the muscles limber and loose, but cool enough to not fuck up the pH levels too much and encourage algae growth. Nobody wanted to encourage algae. That was gross.
She took his hands and started backing toward the door. “Keep talking, babe,” she said. “Clint’s keeping Nick all night. So keep talking.”
“Me too,” Steve sighed, and Tony matched him, letting out a breath and slipping off the railing.  He grabbed one of the patio chairs and eased down onto it.  He touched Steve’s arm, his shoulder, cupped a hand around the back of his neck, his thumb caressing the smooth muscle there, as he drew him closer.  Steve came willingly.
"Because you can't just throw money at every problem and have it go away, Tony," Steve flared.
The place was busy, but not packed.  People wanting a quick bite before Christmas dinner, or picking up trays of cold-cuts and cheese to serve as appetizers for their guests.  One or two lonely souls who were obviously taking their sandwiches back to their apartments to eat a solitary meal in lieu of a family gathering.
“It’s too hard,” he’d said. “You come here maybe twice a month, we go to the movies, we fuck, and you leave again. It’s like you’re married to the army, and I’m just your side-piece. That’s not enough for me, Steve.”
“Are you really sorry?” Tony asked.
Steve looked at Nick and Strange.  They were powerful men.  Arguably, two of the most powerful men in the world--maybe in the galaxy--and they were on his side.  He shrugged, turning back to Ross.  “I don’t know,” he said.  “It kinda feels like I might be.”
Tony shrugged, not quite knowing what to make of the
“I’ll buy you some more.”
But that boy could still square his shoulders.  That boy could still straighten his spine, and he did it now.
--he’d be able to identify Tony by his hands alone if he were ever called upon to do so.  He’d spent a lot of time studying those hands over the last couple of months. He liked looking at them. He liked how strong they looked.  How perfect, even with the rough calluses on the fingertips. He liked the fine dusting of hair on the fingers, the nails that were always perfectly trimmed but sometimes had a little grease still under them when they met for coffee or a movie. Steve liked to pretend it was because of him. Because Tony was in such a rush to see him that he sometimes hurried a little too fast while washing up just so he could get there to see him on time. Steve knew that wasn’t what was really happening, but he liked to pretend it, all the same.
“Tell me.  It’s okay.”
“Okay," he relented and drank the rest of the pulpy juice himself.  “What are you doing today?”
Jeff clapped him on the shoulder.  “She’s right.  Let it go, son.”
When Tony got home that night, Steve took him directly to bed. “What’s gotten into
Tony ran his hands through Steve's hair, over his shoulders.  "
“How was your night?”
Bucky turned his back, but Tony couldn’t let him go.  Not yet.  Bucky hadn’t had to ask him here, hadn’t had to offer up first himself for death, or then, his thanks.  Tony wanted to do something for him.  “Barnes,” he said, and Bucky stopped.  “Hey, um, I’m sorry.  For the way things happened.  In the bunker.”  Bucky’s shoulders tensed, but Tony went on.  “I didn’t want that.  Any of that.  I’m sorry.”
“Hundreds?” she asked, while he helped her into her bed and tucked the covers around her again.
But, he decided, the relief was worth the hurt. The pleasure was worth the pain. And now here he was, fifteen minutes after hanging up the phone, standing in front of him, ridiculously beautiful, ridiculously sweet, every single thing that Tony didn't want to live without. Here he was, looking at him with a worried eye, frowning that little frown, and Tony wanted him. Loved him so much, so, so much, and when Steve crowded against him and dropped his head onto his shoulder, Tony’s arms went instinctively around his neck, holding him in place, knotting in his hair, holding him. Just holding him.
“No,” he said stiffly.  “He didn’t.”
He was aware that he had said it rather loudly--okay,
But Tony hadn’t rushed today.
Also, this is another long one, and everything after the phone call is the result of a marathon 10-hour writing binge before I go back to work tomorrow after three days of being flat-on-my-back sick. If there are typos, I hope they're not too offensive.
“What?”
for fuck’s sake. Sure, he may not have come out of that one unscathed, but he was doing okay. Mostly.
But it hadn’t all been physical thoughts, either.  Tony just liked being with him.  When he wasn’t being a gruff, militaristic asshole, Steve was funny, and patient, and sweet.  Being with him some nights had been like a balm on a wound.  Listening to him talk had felt like a gift, and when those eyes had fallen on him, and he smiled, Tony had felt like he was floating.  Even at the start, when they’d said they hated each other, one look from Steve, and he was better. One look, and whatever was broken inside him at the time, felt healed.
Steve ducked his head, blushing. “Someday,” he said. “Someday, maybe I will.”
He walked down the jet’s short stairway and leaned against it.  The sun blared down, but it contained very little warmth, just a hard glow like a megawatt spotlight.  It reflected off the blue of the ocean, kicking sunbursts back into his eyes.  He put his sunglasses on.  He hadn’t slept last night.  Had only tossed and turned, anxious, nervous,
the frosted ones.  Does
Dum Dum let out a loud, barrel-chested laugh. “He’s got you there, Barnes.”
Tony closed his eyes. His hand, still covered in a drooping bandage, rose and rubbed his forehead. “Baby,” he said softly. “God, baby, I’m sorry. That is not anywhere even close to where my head was at tonight.” He dropped his hand and moved closer to Steve. He reached out a tentative hand, and even though Steve had not let him touch him all night, he let him now. He let Tony brush his finger along his cheek, and then back into his hair. “Steve. Honey. I trust you completely.
He smiled dutifully.  Two more weeks.  Because she was nice.
Tony licked his lips.  Nerves were beginning to flutter in his stomach.  “So, there’s the lake,” he continued, talking fast, the words spilling out of his mouth in an untidy jumble.  “I mean, obviously, there’s the lake.  Big-ass body of water is usually called a lake, right?  The kitchen’s old, but everything works.  Strange sent me copies of all your meds--don’t be pissed, I know it’s personal, I’m sorry, I just wanted to make sure you had what you needed, and to be fair, I’d probably be the one to go get them anyway, so I just saved a trip.  Also, there’s a couple of those RZR ATV things out back.  They’re death traps, but I saw a gang--like a literal gang, Steve, I think they were showing colors and everything--of ten-year-olds driving them when I came up before, so I had to get some.  We can’t be the only kids on the block without toys, right?”
“Yeah,” he said, and turned so he was facing Steve. His eyes were lit up, looking excited. “Yeah. Please? Please come with me to my boring, monotonous, ridiculously gaudy Stark Industries birthday-thing?” He grasped Steve’s hand and clutched it to his chest, batting his eyes until Steve chuckled. “God, baby, please?”
“Nope.”
Howard shook his head. “It’s the same thing, Steven.”
“We all cried.  The old lady manipulates you through the whole movie.  You’re
“Don’t say I didn’t warn you.”
He stopped playing with the bottles when Tony came back into the room. He sat back on the sofa and looked at him. Tony didn’t stop, just climbed into his lap, straddling his hips with an easy confidence, and kissed him deeply. Steve moved his hands up Tony’s back, going under his shirt to touch bare skin, urging him closer, as close as he could get him. Tony unbuttoned Steve’s top button and ducked his head to nip at his collarbone.
Steve had barely gotten to the hospital, had not seen Tony, or even spoken to anyone about him yet.  He had no idea what she meant, but he knew with absolute certainty that she was right. Whatever it was, whatever had happened, Pepper was right to be angry--Steve
Steve frowned when it went to voicemail. “Hey,” he said quietly. “Sorry I keep bothering you, I just...It’s okay. Nevermind. I’m sorry. Talk to you later.”
Steve hugged him tight then let him go. Tony expected to see a smile, but he was frowning instead. “Steve?”
“Hush.  I’m trying to read.”
on a honeymoon?” Tony asked curiously.  “I never thought about that.  Is that still allowed without a proper weddin’?”
Steve rested his head on their clasped hands. His own tears threatened, but he kept them at bay. “I love you, Mom.”
“No, FRI, he does.  He hates me.”
’,” he said.  “Flabbergasted” was not a word he used often, but it was certainly the one that seemed to fit this particular situation.
“Aww, come on. He might regret it for the rest of his life, but he’ll enjoy it while it lasts.”
“I should…” Steve said softly, and in the dim light, Tony saw him glance toward the loft.
“Thanks, Jerry.”
“Twenty minutes, Rogers.”
“Fine,” Tony said.  “Fuck off, Rogers.”
“You heard me correctly.  You are to be released immediately.”
“It’s his heart,” Steve said.  “You don’t see it much at first, but the longer you know him, the bigger it gets.  The
Tony laughed low and sensual. “Do I care?” he asked. “Do
“Grilled cheese okay?”
A bundle of blue polyester hit him squarely in the chest, all gangly, teenage octopus arms clinging to him.
Tony gave him a slow, secret smile. “Yeah, that’s it, Rogers,” he breathed. “You’re not memorable at all.”
Steve didn’t say anything. He just took the step that would press them together, and kissed him. It was not gentle. It was anything but gentle. It was rough, demanding, nothing like any kiss Tony had experienced for years. More years than he could remember. More years than he could even count. He felt the blood pumping through his veins, pounding in his temples, his wrists, his throat, even as Steve urged his mouth open and thrust his tongue inside.
“And Ross?”
“Yeah.”
One last thank you to everyone who read this series. I know it made a lot of you angry at one point or other, and all I can say is...THANK YOU for that! It's more than I could ever ask for this to evoke any emotion whatsoever, so I'll take the anger!
#3: It just hurt too goddamn much.
“You called me a pig.  I think.  And told me to keep my mouth shut or something.”
“It’s ‘cause of you,” he said.
“Your what?”

Steve goes back to the Tower, reminisces, and has a meeting.
to him?"
“She doesn’t know,” Steve answered, his mouth tilting into a tiny smile. “And I’d appreciate it if you didn’t tell her. She’d kick my ass from here to Jersey.”
“It’s okay,” he said.  “You don’t have to--”
“I am a lot.  What’s it, this time?”
He shuddered again, his entire body quaking, and then there was a curl of white on the outer edge of his vision.  His body and mind strived to reach it, that tiny ray of oblivion. Somehow he knew there was quiet inside the whiteness.  Somehow he knew there was peace there.
Dodger wagged his tail. Steve snorted quiet laughter. It was obvious Tony had very little experience with dogs. It was also obvious Tony was trying very hard with this particular dog.
what you do to me. Do you?”
“Of course it did. I’ve seen that movie fifty times.” He looked at Tony through his lashes, giving him that coy, angelic look that never failed to make Tony weak in the knees. And hard as a rock. “How do you think I first realized I liked guys?
“They didn’t assault anyone.”
And that was it.
” He reached past her and tried to close the book, but Tony grabbed it out from under his hand.
Steve shook his head. “I’m not avoiding you.”
“Should I contact anyone?”
“No, Nat,” he said, shaking his head.  “I don’t want to know.  I
Steve had talked to his mom that night when he got home. Mrs. Perkins brewed them both tea, sat them down at the kitchen table, then left them alone, descending the stairs in small, careful steps, purse hung over her arm. She would have liked to listen to what Steven had to say, but this was a family-talk. She was sure dear Sarah would tell her all about it eventually. She just hoped Steven was all right. That he and the other boy hadn’t hurt each other too badly. Steven was so sweet, so sensitive, and the thought of him being hurt--especially by someone who obviously loved him so much--was almost too much for her to bear.
Steve yawned pointedly and shook his head.  "Nah. Us old guys need our rest." He turned on his side away from Tony, pulling the blanket up over his shoulder.
Tony sat up.
Slowly, limbs heavy, hearts heavier, they all got off the bus again. Steve and a couple others went to see if they could help. The driver let them. He was as anxious to get them home as they were. He’d been in the Guard a long time himself. He knew how they felt.
“He’s dangerous, Sarah.  Give him more.”
The lights in the cabin popped on, banishing the shadows and throwing the whole, bloody scene into sharp relief.
They ate at the restaurant, then drove home through the frozen dark.  Steve kept his head turned, eyes staring out the window, watching the shadows of the trees stream past.  Tony had the heater on, the stereo turned to some local station that seemed to have no real format, just playing whatever they wanted with no rhyme or reason except tonight when it seemed every song was a love song.  He made it through "I Remember You" and "Wild Horses" okay, and was on edge through "These Arms of Mine", but when they got to “Everything I Own”, Tony couldn’t stand it anymore, and snapped the radio off.
“Don’t go,” Tony said. “Don’t. We can still fix this, baby. But you can’t go.”
That sobered him up.
And he
“Yeah,” Steve said. “We do.”

Steve moved in his sleep, turned his head, a low moan in the back of his throat.  He’d been asleep for two hours.
“Hey,” Steve answered, heard the hitch in his voice, cleared his throat, and tried again. “Hey. Tony. Hey.”
He could text him, though
Tony kissed him, open-mouthed, hot, wet, tongue moving greedily, and Steve kissed him back with just as much passion, thrusting up against Tony’s knee.
Steve just laughed.  “You would have been the only one.  Nobody was too interested back then.  Peggy, but she was my C.O.  It took us awhile.  In fact, we really weren’t supposed to, at all.”

mummies at the museum. And I’ll even take you down to the dinosaur rooms if you want. I know you love dinosaurs, Sam. Everybody loves dinosaurs.”
Steve slid his arms around Tony’s waist. “I told him I needed a break,” he said. “That I thought we should spend some time apart.”
