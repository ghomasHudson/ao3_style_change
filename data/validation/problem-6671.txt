“C’mon, kid. I’m sure this guy has some things to discuss,” he says. Peter watches them go for a moment, but decides to go then, as well. He gets into a large hallway filled with what looks like ancient artifacts. He feels his mouth open in surprise as he takes it all in.
It’s only typical for Peter to go to the compound as soon as school is over. Happy is already waiting for him, being as distant as always – Peter just figures it’s more a thing about being uncomfortable around kids and teens rather than him just not liking him. Through the crowded traffic, Happy curses at incompetent drivers once every while. Peter doesn’t point it out, knowing he’ll only be met with silence.
With a few movements between the fireballs, Yaël managed to make the concrete crack and build a wall around her sister. Of course, in between, she still had to dodge the fire Nilla was now steering in big, strong strings, aggressive enough to set a whole forest on fire.
Of course, Charles was the answer to this mystery. His younger version walked around the corner, with his hands against his back, like he was just taking a stroll.
Peter throws the sunglasses on his bed and reaches out for Tony, giving him a short, reassuring hug. He doesn’t expect Tony to just grab on to him and not letting go. Peter chuckles hesitantly, gently patting his father on the back.
“Kind of unofficial. She took care of me when my parents didn’t. Or whenever Jarvis couldn’t.” Tony starts up the coffee machine again before leaving the room. Peter gives Steve a questioning look, seeing the super soldier standing there with his mouth open but clearly unable to say a word.
What’s going on? Is it the Goblin again? Is he after Peter once more? He wouldn’t put it past Harry, but right now he really wishes it isn’t him. Harry is the last person he needs to see right now; he already knows his dreams will be filled with bad memories.
“FUCK!” Yaël cursed loudly as she threw the coat on the floor and started stomping on it. Then she suddenly got attacked by a hard sting in her shoulder. Yaël hissed and turned around, but there was no one. So she touched her shoulder and noticed a piece of her clothing was burned away and the hole showed a red, sore, burned off piece of flesh with a few strings of the burned fabric sticking into it. Bloody hell, she just healed from the former wounds and within just a split-second, Nilla managed to damage Yaël again.
“You can fill in this paper now, or you can bring it back later this week. There’s no deadline, really, but I’m sure you’ll want it finished before you’ll start college, am I right?” Tony forces out another smile. His body just feels exhausted right now, and all he wants at this moment is to lie down in his bed and stare at the ceiling. Rather with Pepper at his side, but he can’t have everything now, right?
Tony starts to make his way to Otto, only to see his wife is doing the same thing. She grabs Otto’s shoulder, telling him something Tony can’t hear. Otto turns around, suddenly confused. He hadn’t realized what was going on. As he turns, something seems to hit him in the back, causing for him to lose his balance and fall forward on his face. He doesn’t move after that, his wife starting to shake him.
Peter feels for her. He wishes he could help, but he can’t really do anything here. So he doesn’t answer. Nothing is said as they hold up their hands to stop a taxi, only to have it drive them by. There’s already somebody inside, Peter quickly notes. Better to just wait for the next one, then.
“Had a misunderstanding in the past. He wanted something from me that I couldn’t give, and he took it personally,” Peter tries to keep it simple, but it hurts to just talk about it like this. Like Gwen’s… like it had just been an accident and not an attempt of Harry – The Goblin to get even.
Dr. Cho is probably waiting for him; it’s already noon and Peter is still lying in bed with his covers thrown closely to him. He’d rather just stay in bed right now, but there’s no point in postponing it, right? The answer will stay the same, whether he’ll figure them out today or next week.
Peter finds himself dancing with some girls he never even met. Much to his surprise, even a few guys start rubbing up on him when there doesn’t seem to be much pace for anybody to move. And Peter doesn’t care at all, because he’s having fun. And for once, people don’t see him as the loser, or the nerd that can’t keep his family together.
“Let me tell you what, I’ll ask Tony if you can come along to the compound one day, alright? That way I can introduce you to all the Avengers!”
“Not like it matters right now since they don’t want to grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.”
“In those few hours, I somehow managed to get you into the board and went to the doctors that tended you to check on your condition.” He finished, like he had explained his whole point, but Yaël still didn’t get it.
“These locks are sensitive to anything unnatural, so if I would try to forcibly open it, Mr. Stark would be immediately warned for it, and I promised Captain Rogers that I would not use my powers for those kinds of things,” Wanda explained. With that she lifts up the card again where Peter can clearly read her name. “Outside of training, they expect me to behave like a normal human would, just in case I would ever come to lose these powers and not become completely dependable of them.”
Turning off the infernal sound coming out of the machine on her nightstand she turned around to get back to sleep, but she accidentally rolled onto the file the two men had given her. There was only one paper in it.
“You are getting changed, and after that you can go to sleep,” the man warns him. Aching all over his body, Peter groans when he listens and forces himself back on his feet. It should be embarrassing that Tony is helping him get dressed, but with how heavy his limbs are feeling Peter’s pretty sure he couldn’t have done this on his own.
“Dads, I’m- I’m sorry, okay?” Peter starts, walking up to the bed taking place on the chair that had previously been occupied by Bucky. “I just- I got angry and I behaved like a brat, and I shouldn’t have, I know that.”
“You mean aside of the fact that he’s just kicked his boyfriend out of the house for the eleventh time because he’s on this idiotic quest to deal with his problems by himself?” Rhodey throws in before Tony can respond.
Seeing that Thor and Hilde were keeping Hela busy, Yaël took a few steps back and started retracting water from Hela’s body. Hela was so caught up in the fight that she didn’t even notice. At least until she knocked downBrunnhilde and Thor, who climbed up again and yelled to dreadlock-guy to go.
“Oh I’m not?” Tony asks, lifting an eyebrow. “Well, then I suppose that’s it. The end of the company. Let’s all go home, it’s over.” Tony starts getting up, noticing the even stronger glare Pepper’s throwing at him.
“Sure,” Tony assures him, keeping his voice down as well. Steve walks up to the bed, taking place on the opposite side, making sure Peter is lying between them. The super soldier immediately puts a hand on Peter’s head and kisses him on his hair before leaning back against the bed board.
“MJ? What’s going on?” Peter asks in confusion. MJ turns towards him, giving him a wide smile before shrugging.
“Yes, dear?” Tony asks, giving Steve an innocent look. Steve walks up to where Tony is, suddenly pulling on the chair until it’s rolling backwards.
“Oh you got to be joking?” Peter mutters out. Laya, who passes him by with her own order, seems to have heard him.
“Three people are still stuck in the building, but we can’t get to them without endangering our own men,” the man says.
It’s not one of those headaches that comes when he hasn’t had enough water in his system, or when his brain is going in overdrive. It’s more of the silently suffering kind of headache that comes because of the people surrounding him.
Yaël grinned as she read the text. So, this man really couldn’t die? How was that even possible? Or was he joking? How does a man get immortal? She received a following text.
“You asshole, don’t you ever almost die again when I’m not here!” she hisses at him, punching him on the shoulder. Tony loses his balance for a moment, but she holds him back.
“Okay, I promise,” Ned assures him, still not sounding entirely keen on what is coming next. And then Peter starts talking. He explains
“His parameters are alright,” Tony says somewhere. “Heartrate elevated which is normal on this occasion, but other than that there’s nothing standing out.”
“Heya sports, did you all sleep well?” Tony asks once he notices the two boys arriving. He’s got an amused smile on his face while he closes the refrigerator, holding a milk carton in his hands.
“He’s alright,” Steve agrees. Then he gently kisses Tony on the shoulder. “If anything, I think he only texted us to ask if you found anything on that cat-lady.”
“Davey! How long have you been here?” Johnny asks when he pulls back. He clearly seems to find his friend’s drunken state quite hilarious, since he gives Peter a short look with amused eyes.
Okay, so Steve had just been extremely tired this whole time. “Why don’t you come over to sleep in my bed tonight?”
I've seen multiple cases of encephalopathy. It's a pretty scare thing to watch, seeing a person break apart like that day by day. It's probably also one of the reasons I stay away from alcohol or multiple painkillers all the time. With that, I want to make clear that I had my patients in mind while I was writing this, and I tried as much as I could to portray it as accurately as possible. in some cases, there's violence and constant cursing. In the other, forgetfulness. Sometimes the person just can't speak any longer. It goes on and on.
“So I’ve heard,” Strange answers. “Now, Dr. Banner, if you may, just, tell us where exactly you’ve been?”
“Alright, thank you Mr. Stark! Sorry for calling you on this line, but I don’t really have a lot of time or I’ll be late for-“
“Yes?” he didn’t sound surprised to hear her at all. Yaël scratched her head. What was she supposed to say now? It’d sound idiotic if she’d just say she had a weird dream, but how would she explain it otherwise?“Yaël?”
“What? Are you afraid Peter will be attracted to me instead of you?” Oh, Yaël loved teasing her raisin-friend.
Everybody stops their movement. Eyes are opened wide, mouth have dropped in surprise. Tony's fork falls out of his hand.
There’s no news, from nowhere. It’s practically the middle of the night, so nobody he knows is still awake. And he’s too tired to head out. He should just sleep.
“Oh Tony,” Steve says with a pained sound. Tony suddenly feels a hand resting onto his shoulder, and he looks up, only to find Steve staring at him with a worried look. “I’m so sorry.”
“I’M NOT A HELPLESS LITTLE GIRL, OKAY?!” Yaël grunted out of frustration as she tried to lean more on one leg to get the other one out of her pants.
“Hey, what’s wrong guys?” Peter asks in confusion. Tony shakes his head, only now noticing that there are tears in his eyes.
She also quickly discovered that Fury was giving her way too little money. Two days after Nick and Professor X had left, she already hadn’t had enough money to buy groceries for the following week.And when she naively called him about it, he answered her that she already had cost him enough money – which was not fair because she didn’t even know what she had done! So Yaël had decided, on day three, that she should get a job.
Being Spider-Man has taken a small moment of rest, until Peter’s all healed up again, but other than that, things are practically the same. Ned is still incredibly curious as to how the Avengers exactly are as persons, Michelle continues on staring at Peter with this huge distrust, Aunt May still seems to have this weird crush on Captain America (probably even more so now that she’s actually met the man), and Flash still seems intent on making Peter’s life a miserable hell.
Now, after having replaced his wet clothes and taking a warm shower, Peter wonders what he could do with what remains of his day. He hasn't seen his Dad or Steve around so far, but he knows Bruce is somewhere in his own lab.
. Not to offend or make fun of her, but because they knew Yaël was able to have a good laugh with them. At least it was better than Space Girl with the continuous Spice Girl-music added to it every time Wade made his dramatic departures.
Another shake of his head. “I used to talk to you when it came to stuff like this. You gave me ideas all the time.”
“And after that, with Nat, in the helicarrier. She got hurt as well. Despite that, despite everything, she still decided I was worth something.”
Having grabbed his skateboard, Peter throws it down on the ground none-too-gently before putting one foot on it. He knows it’s quite a little way before he’ll get there, but at least this way he’ll kill more time. In the case that Yaël wouldn’t be home, Peter would just continue walking towards Stark Industries and lose more time. At least this way he can clear his head some more.
“You look troubled, Anthony,” T’Challa suddenly says, getting the attention of Nakia and Okoye as well. The latter is just standing by the large windows of the balcony, looking outside as if she’s expecting trouble even from this high. Knowing their luck, she could be right.
“How much do you know? About me?” Peter asks then, eyes suddenly glistening over wat looks like a blue liquid. He wonders what that is for, but figures that it has something to do with her mind-controlling abilities since none of the others have it.
“I heard his mother passed away a while back, and that it messed him up a lot,” Bruce says after a while, surprising Tony. To be honest, he hasn’t really been keeping taps on the lives of his old friends from college other than Rhodey. Besides, it’s not like Otto has ever really been considered Tony’s
After the subject, Yaël and Logan both waited until all the students were gone, like normal teachers do. They packed their stuff and walked out, Logan first and Yaël right behind him.
“Okay, Peter’s here for his training. Just… chase them off, try and get them back to the compound. I’ll take care of them, alright?”
Not that it needs a lot of fixing; sure, installing Karen back again would be great, but further than that Peter realizes he doesn’t need much else. Somehow, it already makes him stronger, more agile. Peter feels better than ever before because of it. However that could be, he knows he should question it. But to be honest, he couldn’t care less.
Peter doesn’t answer anymore, because there’s nothing else left to say. He gives Mr. Stark a quick look, but there’s nothing to be read from him. While Mr. Stark had looked angry before, now he just appears like somebody kicked his puppy.
“He’s HYDRA, and he’s loose. We can’t have him running around like that after everything he’s done,” Steve explains. Tony then sighs and lowers his gaze again.
Tony doesn’t make any move to stand up. Instead he takes his notebook and starts scribbling something down.
It’s crap, anyway. Peter takes the note without reading it, and balls it up to throw it into the nearest trash. He’s already accepted the fact that he’ll have to repeat the year, so whatever. At least he’ll no longer be stuck with Flash as a classmate, then.
Yaël walked to her little fridge. “What do you want? I have water, or beer, or… oh jeez, this milk is bad news, yo!” She threw it in the bin. “I also have orange juice!”
Tony doesn’t know who says it. He just closes his eyes and gets it all through his head. For all this time he’s been constantly so worried about his son ending up killed that he never thought about his boy potentially killing
Peter pours probably way too much shampoo into his hair. Passing the soap over his body, he comes across his scar on his lower belly for a short moment. While the drops of water fall onto his face, he looks down to give it a view. It seems so long ago when Harry snatched Peter out of the sky and impaled him through some sort of metal pin on a building. No matter how crappy that situation was, it did help him and Tony forward.
Or, somebody else, that is. Because when he told Rhodey, all he got was laughter and a ‘I knew there would at least be
Tony smiles lightly, but it doesn’t stay on his face for too long. It’s, after all, just another reminder that he never got to know Peter when he was little. That’s something Mary took away from him.
instead of getting a few strong drinks. Tony knows that, if he’d been going to the workshop, he might have thrown everything around in anger.
Sharon is looking at him with raised eyebrows. Tony knows he’s looking horrible, but he wouldn’t have thought it’d be this bad. They’re at the table. Sharon brought food, Tony provided the drinks, and they’ve been talking about something for the past hour.
“My my, I think I’ve found our regular meeting spot,” somebody says behind him. Peter groans, rolling his eyes and turning his head slightly to see the Black Cat walking up to him.
“Then it’s T’Challa for you, too,” he says. Tony nods, following the King into the car. The drive isn’t long at all. When he’s offered a glass of champagne, Tony refuses.
Glad that Peter remembered to dress for the occasion, Tony guides his three companions out of the penthouse and into the elevator Steve just dumped all of the Avengers in. Steve is quiet, probably wondering what he agreed to join in to. Peter’s face is still red, for some reason making the boy appear very uncomfortable. Bruce, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to catch the awkward silence. He discusses some of Octavius’ older projects he remembers.
May is next to Peter. Her hand is holding his, but she’s since long stopped trying to talk to him. It’s not that Peter doesn’t want to, but it’s more that it’s extremely hard to start a conversation without wanting to blame the entire world for everything. So he stays quiet, in turn making May continue her book at last. Peter can just remember her reaction when she heard they were going to New Asgard. She’d been excited, but at the same time worried about Peter’s health.
Yaël wanted to bite back that she could do it on her own, but she knew she couldn’t and Vision surely didn’t deserve her bitchy answers. So she tried to calm down a bit, but the wound hurt like hell, and nodded.
Peter has detention again. Tony sighs when he gets the news. It’s happening way too often, and he’s got a strange little feeling that it’s kind of his fault.
Yaël got up, readying herself. Okay, so this was what she had been training for. She had to use al the techniques she had discovered and throw them into this battle.
“No, I’ll be fine. I was just startled,” Peter responds. Tony gives him a long look before the teenager starts to get uncomfortable. Then eventually he gives up. “Alright, I’ll wait here.”
“Yeah, okay, heard you were going to kidnap me so I brought along extra pizza. That way I’ll have something to eat while a complete stranger starts to probe me,” Peter calls out, praising his own sarcasm once again. Creepy Stalking Guy puts a hand on his face and makes a fake expression that should come over as insulted, but Peter doesn’t buy it, instead turning around to take a look at the apartment.
The fist loosens, opens. A big hand reaches out for something, and someone is raised into the air. Tony still can’t see who it is. He isn’t trying to find out, as long as Peter can just manage to swing his feet around. Kick, as hard as he can, and Tony is assured that he’s okay.
“You crazy son of a-,” Peter mutters the moment they’re only minutes away from Stark industries, hands onto his stomach as he prepares himself to lose all the contents. Before he can finish his sentence, a loud scream is heard coming from Wade, and then the sound of some sort of blade. When Peter looks up, he sees one of Wolverine’s claws through the roof of the car, two of them buried deep into Wade’s skull.
Peter has enough of it. At first, he’s spending all his time in classes he’s quickly figuring out he’s too smart for, barely having any time for a break since he’s got to get to Stark Industries the moment he’s finished with school. There’s barely even time for him to patrol around as Spider-Man these days, since he often forgets himself and stays at SI long past his working hours.
“Preparing for the surgery wasn’t easy. They needed to make contact with Dr. Cho to get the anesthetics right and even then I still woke up during the surgery. Didn’t feel any pain so that’s that at least,” Steve explains. After Tony covers himself back up, Steve reaches for his hand again, holding it close to his chest. “When you passed out I thought I had come too late. You looked so awful, Tony.”
“You’re even ready faster than Tony,” she says with a wink. Peter snorts, not really surprised about that. The fact that Tony has been needing a serious shave and haircut, he can figure that it would have taken a bit more time. MJ is the next one to walk out. It’s weird, seeing her so much fancier than normally. Her wild hair is straightened out, her normally baggy clothes replaced by slim dark pants and a white shirt with on top of it a black coat. She gives Peter a wink before sitting down again and taking her book. Peter smiles back at her, feeling a sudden urge to kiss her but keeping himself from doing that.
“So, how is she?” Tony asks, not even caring that this interview is not going the way it’s supposed to go. There’s time to ask his usual questions later, right now all he needs is to know if Mary’s okay.
With his mind reminding him that Tony doesn’t want him to go after the big guys, Peter hesitates for a moment before going to investigate. He’s not planning on taking him on, after all, all he wants is to have a quick look and see if he has to call somebody. Maybe SHIELD, since Sharon came by the tower the day after Tony escaped from the hospital (mostly to curse his head off), and then told Peter to just call the number if he ever found anything strange.
“You know as much as I do that I’m not a great example,” she said as she moved a pawn. X quickly shook his head as she was moving the pawn the wrong way, so she corrected herself. “Besides, what could I possibly teach these kids? I’m not even a mutant, let alone human.”
“Most of the time, Merc with a mouth, after all! Now, let’s go. It’s Friday and I need to stalk Parker in the pizzeria.”
Tony doesn’t smile, which makes Peter think that it’s serious enough. Not really in the mood for that right now, he resumes the walk back to the table. There, he hands out waffles to everybody, getting appreciative looks in return.
They laugh, then they go to sit down on the only couch in the room. Natasha brings Peter up to date to where she’s been until now. As far as Peter understands, she’s been traveling, on her way to make sure nothing of the Red Room remains standing.
Yaël discovered that day, while teaching classes, that, though she enjoyed pampering herself with sweets, she also missed the big festival. Not that she wanted a party or anything, she just missed that Helvegian habit. She hadn’t seen it in at least an era as, being banished, she wasn’t allowed to go and celebrate with the others.
Sorry! I've been gone a little while due to the exams. My first one was today, and though it absorbed every bit of free time I had left, it still didn't go well. So, as a get better, I made another part of the incorrect quotes since that kind of brightens my day a bit!
So after a little while, Natasha started having conversations with the weird alien-girl. Nothing deep, but just light conversations which built up to, after Yaël had stayed in the compound for a little while back then, joking around and triggering other residents with their sarcasm. That didn’t make Tony like her more, though.
Mr. Stark then says instead, much to Peter’s surprise. His mouth falls open, and his book falls to the ground. With a grunt, he kneels down to pick it up.
Preparation takes a while. The music shifts from one song to the other, apparently always playing something from Johnny Cash. By the time Tony’s just about collected everything he needs, he goes to sit down on the stool and pulls off his shirt. Looking down at his chest, he passes his hand over his scar. Not just the one from the arc reactor, but the T-shaped memory of his surgery last year. He takes a deep breath, for a moment missing Steve even more than before.
“Yeah, sure, Steve,” she threw him her kindest smile and went with her hand through his hair. The guy had such amazing hair. “Just come to talk with me frequently so you don’t burst out against Tony, I don’t want you to fuck this up.”
Tony can’t really lie to her, he never could. “Amongst many things, yes. You are, I’m sure, aware that my life hasn’t really been much fun…”
“What’s wrong with my last name?” Steve asks a bit angrily. He crosses his arms together, getting enough distance between the two of them.
“Oh, no,” he muttered. He walked towards his family and wrapped his arms around them. Yaël saw him making Tony lean into his arms. A tear made a way through the dirt on Cap’s cheek. He closed his eyes, like he was testing if this was just a bad dream. But apparently, it wasn’t.
“I’m not going with you and I’ll give you a hard time if you’re trying to kidnap me,” Yaël answered dangerously.
“Uh, I think he’s in the professor’s office,” one of them says, pointing to the building they’re standing in front of. Tony nods before removing the suit. Pulling out his sunglasses, he walks through the courtyard, greeting every teenager and kid that seems excited to see him.
having to talk about it. The only reason she has it is to make sure James isn’t going to go crazy from the lack of it.
quinjet and disappeared with it. And he knows he can track it down eventually, but in all honesty, Tony can’t bring himself to do that.
Immediately, a warmth passes over Peter, originating from the suit. Though shuddering through the cold, Peter feels an immediate relief now that he’s no longer freezing.
“Don’t! I’m almost free! I’ll climb to the building and get to safety. Just get out of here or he’ll get you!”
And even though Peter had only met Peggy a few times, he can’t help but feel a few tears roll off his cheeks as well. Grabbing Tony’s hand, he tries to find comfort, only to realize that Tony is in need of it as well.
“I remember getting your text. I was heading your way to rip you a new one, but I don’t remember the details; I was kinda drunk,” she mutters, shaking her head. “Uh, last thing I remember was you dancing with an umbrella in your hand.”
“Then we’ll do it together; I don’t remember much of it, either,” she says with a smirk. They then press the play button, immediately hearing the noise of a shaky camera, surrounded by too many people talking together. In the background, there’s the clear sound of a DJ playing – was it Flash? Peter can’t really remember…
“Protection? That’s how you see this?” Steve almost shouts at him. “This is protection? It’s internment, Tony!”
All of this, the stuff with Loki, immediately reminded her to those kids in the woods, back on Helvegen. That one boy seemed to ‘like’ her too, but it was all fun and games. She had just been a joke to them. And later it happened again, with Loki. That had to be the last time, never again, she swore to herself.
“One time I added boosters to my skateboard to go faster. I ended up breaking my arm,” Peter finishes, looking back down at his hands after that.
“Is this a joke?” James wonders. And eventually Tony manages to get the boot off, groaning out in relief.
“No, we can do this just fine,” Steve tells him. Tony sighs but follows suit. He takes a towel, and waits for Steve to clean the bowl before he can dry it. There’s a strange, domestic feeling about this that Tony hasn’t felt in a little while. In his mind, he’s reminded of the time where Pepper insisted on doing the dishes, but he quickly finds that there’s no more pain in his chest. There’s nostalgia, yes, but looking at Steve is enough to counter the sadness immediately.
Tony ignores him. He drops the mugs down on the coffee table and kneels down on the ground. Ignoring the pain in his left shoulder as he leans on it, he reaches underneath the couch and finds there the familiar fabric of the suit he’s been working on with Peter.
“What I say is, you gave Mr. Parker detention after he supposedly ‘lied’ to you, but I am here to confirm that he
And Peter dances. Suddenly, all that insecurity and anxiety seems to have disappeared from his face. He smiles at the people, pretends to sing along as he starts leaning off the street lamp. Tony and Steve both frown when Peter suddenly disappears behind a bunch of umbrella’s. They both lean a bit to the side, trying to get a good look but unable to see anything.
“Kind of,” he answered dryly. “She touched it and it somehow disappeared into her. Her body sucked up the stone, I would never believe it would be possible if I hadn’t seen it with my own two eyes.” The king sighed “Back in the day, Cem, her father, was one of my best guards, so I put him onto the job to guard the stone. One day his wife, Agostina, brought him some lunch. Of course she had to bring that spawn of hell with her. The kid touched it, the stone turned into some kind of liquid and just ran into Yaël’s skin. Gone was the stone.”
With that, Korg landed behind one of the zombie-ish dudes who was almost going to stab some guy with dreadlocks, and blasted the zombie into pieces.
Being February, there’s still some light snow falling down, but not staying on the ground. People are packed into their warm coats, flocking together to stay warm in the cold with their hot cups of coffee in their gloved hands.
A sweet looking woman with cool glasses opened the door. She didn’t look like an aunt, or maybe the cool, hippie kind of aunt that only appears at family parties with incredible stories to tell… Was Yaël even at the right place?
are you wearing?” he put his hands in his pockets after opening his vest because of the warmth. The poor soul always had to wear a costume, being a receptionist in THE Stark Tower. Yaël looked down. Oh, right, her lovey-dovey-act.
“The moment he returns, I’ll give him a piece of my mind, right Dum-E?” Peter mutters as he fumbles around with two screwdrivers, tightening two metal plates together for current project.
“Mr. Parker, take a seat, please,” Principal Morita says, pointing towards the empty seat next to Mr. Stark – who isn’t looking all too happily at Peter. The teenagers tries to swallow away a sudden lump in his throat, but then obeys and drops himself down in the chair. He does his best not to look at Mr. Stark, keeping a straight posture as his eyes rest on Mr. Morita’s desk.
“Right, that evening sucked,” Tony points out. Then he sighs again, taking a framed picture of Peter and his parents. It must be weird for him, looking at pictures of Peter’s mother and knowing that she’s no longer here.
“You did, she had to leave again. But she left a message,” he says, picking up the post-it and handing it to Tony. The engineer blinks a few times at Peter’s outstretched hand holding the piece of paper, but eventually reaches out to take it.
All heads turn to the door as well. It’s closed, the blinds shut. It doesn’t take long for May to march towards it and burst it open. She couldn’t do it faster. Before anybody can say anything, she’s inside with her nephew. Strange hurries after her, along with Rhodey. Steve waits for a bit outside, a smug smile on his face while he reaches out his hand towards Tony.
“Hi, dads,” Peter greets them. Steve looks up, giving Peter a wide smile. Tony doesn’t seem to react, meaning that he’s deep into whatever he’s currently working on.
“Maybe we can come to an arrangement,” Loki asked Hela, while staring at her with suspicion. It was weird to hear his voice. She had heard him in her dreams, but that hadn’t been reality.
Tony smirks, filling his cup with coffee and then taking place at the table, not addressing the boys but still talking loud enough for them to hear.
Sam shoots another small glance towards Natasha. Tony, too, gives her a quick look, finding her staring ahead without as much as an expression. She’s good at keeping poker faces, but right now, the fact that she’s putting one up is indication enough that she’s trying to hide something.
“They simply couldn’t decline, Loki!” Yaël crossed her arms. Why did she even bother arguing with that stubborn man?
“If your leg is fractured, don’t you need to make sure it heals the right way again?” Clint asks in confusion.
In the end, they were an hour late to a party they went to for the second time in their knowledge. But the only thing that matters to Steve and Tony both is keeping Peter in the dark. He doesn’t need to know about it.
“I didn’t think you’d actually say it!” Steve counters, voice raised just as much as Tony’s. “Can’t you just understand that I love you, Tony? I love you
Peter stands still, hand on the cold metal that opens the door, but not pulling it down yet. He waits.
“For now, we’ll have to do it without Bruce, but we’ll get him back, for sure,” Steve assures him. “And even if it won’t work right away, Peter will still love you. He didn’t mean what he said, and you know that.”
A bit later, Brunnhilde walked in, with a bottle filled with something that was clearly not a drink for children.
“Couldn’t you just, I don’t know, use your telekinetic powers for opening doors?” Peter asks when they get out of the room again. Wanda shakes her head and takes his hand to make him follow her. Though Peter can’t place one hallway from the others, Wanda does seem to know where she wants to go, and as it turns out that’s exactly where Peter just came from. They pass Dr. Cho’s office again, and follow the end of the hallway until they get to an obviously locked door.
“Dude, I thought you couldn’t?” he asks, clearly confused. “You know, with your medication and all?”
“But Peter!” Tony protests. Next to them, another desk gets pulled along, dragging a poor man along with it. There’s a loud shout as it flies into the source. As Tony takes a good look around, he realizes that’s not the first victim this afternoon.
“In a minute, first I need to make sure he has a comm! When I’m in the tower I’ll get Wanda to come here as quickly as possible and-“
“Can I be honest, Tony?” Bruce asks after they’ve left the building. Tony feels a small chill going through him at the question. Whenever somebody asks something like this, usually something awful is going to follow.
“Yeah, I’m peachy. Just gonna lie down here for a sec, though,” Peter returns, frowning at how raspy his voice sounds. Aunt May surely is going to ask questions again. What’s Peter going to say, this time? Should he blame it on another common cold? Hell, maybe he’ll even catch one as well.
Well, no, last year Steve made her some dinner, which felt a bit like home but also totally not. Which was okay, memories shouldn’t be deliberately reconstructed.
“Yeah, there are the sex-positive asexuals,” Heather adds. “Then there’s the antisexuals like your Aunt here.”
With his other hand, Tony rubs his scar. He’s been doing that too often, lately. At least the bruising from the shield is gone, but in the end, Tony will always feel it.
Peter nods, not really thinking about how she can’t see him at all. Then he clears his throat. “Uh, yeah, uh, talk to me.”
“Steve flew all the way from Wakanda to donate his liver to him. Sadly, somebody called the cops on him and now he’s in jail until they’ve finalized the accords.”
“And I suspect he refused because he’s a very responsible young man,” Tony states. The two boys chuckle again nervously.
“Why wouldn’t you?” Yaël asks while launching quite a big piece into the water. Two ducks start fighting for it, making quite some noise in the process.
“Is there something you need, Miss Stacey?” Peter hears Tony ask in the background. Peter’s head goes into his direction immediately. This Tony sounds exactly the same like Peter’s, if not a bit more exasperated. Without prompting, Peter walks up to him, taking off his mask at last.
“Whoa, oh my God!” Peter exclaims, recognizing the suit immediately. Not because he’s seen it before, but mostly because of a feeling. Peter hasn’t seen him working on a suit other than the one he’s been making together with Peter. He’d just expected it would have been for this Daredevil-guy. To see it suddenly in front of him, the final result of all the work they’ve put into it… It takes Peter’s breath away.
They both walk out of the elevator on the same floor. It could be coincidence, but when it looks like she’s going the exact same way Peter is going, he figures he might see more of her in the future. Just as Peter walks up to one of the nurses to ask for Tony, he sees the Doctor walk into a room.
“Easy for you, we should presume,” brown-glasses points out. Tony gives the man a quick stare before smirking.
“It’s like you’ve stolen the words right out of my mouth,” Steve whispers back in between the kissing. He allows Tony to push him back. Laying down, Steve doesn’t remove his eyes from Tony’s.
Somewhere during the flight Peter falls asleep. He doesn’t mean too, but it’s not really so bad to wake up and find out they’ve arrived. Once his eyes are completely opened, May is already packing in her book, Steve is walking towards Tony to check out the landing. Bruce is busy putting his headphones away.
Tony snickers at that. He can easily imagine it, yeah! “Sounds mostly like Loki’s work to me, though.”
Harry was back as the heir of Oscorp, but only being seventeen years old – he was older than Peter – he was too young to rule. After his father’s death, they had to figure out who would be in charge until Harry was old enough.
Tony rolls his eyes, because that’s not an answer to his question. Giving the house another last glance he suits up and gets in the air as quickly as possible.
“That’s not what you thought when you asked me to take on Steve,” Peter throws at him, but regrets it immediately. He can see the change in stance on the suit almost instantly. Tony doesn’t respond immediately, leaning forward a bit while his free hand goes to his chest. Peter knows what that means; he’s rubbing his scar again.
“2016. He’s the one who approached me,” Tony answers truthfully. He knows he could screw up the timeline like this, but as horrible as it is to say, it’s not like Mary has long left to cause a catastrophe. “Listen, I know that you never wanted me to know about him, but things are as they are and I love him more than anything in the world.”
Besides, people who don’t know about him being Spider-Man could notice the lack of scar and start asking questions. They all saw him being impaled on the video somebody felt the need to share on the internet.
“We haven’t really spoken since you came back, and I can understand that. You came back late and you probably didn’t want to wake me, and then you’ve been at school…” Okay, he’s rambling. Tony takes a breath. “Just, nice work at DC.”
“Uh, what’s going on?” he asks, confused. Tony points towards the couch before putting his finger to his lip.
There’s an awkward silence the moment the elevator-door closes in front of them. Mr. Stark pushes the second-to-last-highest button on the pad to get towards his office, but doesn’t start to speak at all. Peter is aware that the man is looking at him curiously, taking in his messy look.
The first thing she did as she woke up was weeks of mental and physical exercises. They had put her in a very lonely department, god knows if she even had been in a hospital or not, she surely didn’t know. The only thing she saw there were white walls, doctors and professors. There were no other patients, no one. After that, X and Fury straightly put her in the apartment and left her here, kind of.
that follows. The sound that indicates that he’s too late, he’s always been too late. And Peter gasps for breath, leaning forward as he puts his hand on his chest, remembering too well how her lifeless body felt in his hands as he cradled her close to him. As he wept, cried for the girl he loved, feeling her dying in his arms. One heartbeat, one more, and then nothing.
“You want me to take away the suit, don’t you?” Tony asks, sadly. All the eyes on him lower again, nobody wanting to face him when he hits the mark.
“Wanna come and see how Peter’s doing right now?” Tony then asks. Steve nods, not even thinking about the fact that Tony can’t see him do so.
“You want to return to New York, am I not mistaking?” T’Challa continues the conversation while they exit one hallway to get into another one.
“Crap!” Peter shouts. Quickly he scrambles towards to front seat, leaning to the left to grab the steering wheel in an attempt to avoid driving people over.
“Steve,” he breathes out. Why are his eyes stinging? Why are Steve’s eyes red, too, behind his glasses? They don’t search for explanations, instead pulling each other into a strong hug and holding on tight.
Tony storms through the crowd as well. Even attempting to fly again, his left boot valiantly sputters out a little bit before failing. It helps him forward at least a little bit. He’s getting closer, and closer. Steve has reached
“Mr. Stark, Ms. Potts,” the Vision greets, startling Pepper every time again when JARVIS’ voice blooms up out of the android.
“The newspaper? You know I never forget about that,” Miles interrupts him as he fishes out the paper from his bag and throws it Peter’s way. Peter tries to grab it, but misses and nearly drops the hot plate in the process. Miles just snorts.
Getting on the ship was the worst mistake Yaël had ever made, but on the other side, if she had stayed on Helvegen, it would have been the death of her as the whole kingdom was trying to hunt her down. Some nights, she had heard footsteps and whispering, but the guards had never managed to find her in that cave. Once they’d got into the ship, Loki turned two-faced. Yaël had much trouble adjusting to its technology, but that was nothing compared to how she got treated and how she had to adjust towards Loki.
, Peter thinks to himself. Quickly, he throws himself off the roof, swinging his way to his own apartment building with a tension in his body that he hasn’t really felt before. Feeling as if his cheeks are permanently colored red, he goes on until he arrives at the window in his bedroom. Easily, he opens it and sneaks inside when he sees there’s nobody in there. Shrugging out of the suit, Peter grabs for some clothes he randomly finds lying around and puts them on without bothering to see if they match.
“Yeah yeah, ad if it takes too long we’ll skip to the real act,” he agrees. Natasha bites on her lip as she tries to hold back her laughter. Especially when they press the play-button.
“I’m not sure I want to know the answer to it,” he answered. Then he stood up, whiping his pants so that he was clean from pizza-crumbs. He was ready to leave, Yaël noticed, as she saw him looking around for his backpack.
The Avengers are still standing, though barely. Vision is knocked out – Tony can’t imagine how it must have hurt, having the stone ripped out of his head like that – and Clint’s missing in action somewhere. They know he’s alive; he’s left signs. But were he is, nobody knows.
So Tony closes his eyes, putting is hands on Steve’s hips instead to pull him closer. The kiss is rough, and it barely leaves any room for them to breathe. But it’s still perfect, somehow. Every time Tony pulls back to take a breath, Steve leans forward once more to capture his lips again.
“Yeah, but, I thought she was secretly crushing on Peter all the time, you know?” Ned asks out of the blue, and both Harry and Peter turn to him with eyes open wide. Ned blinks a few times, not understanding what he said wrong. “What is it?”
“What the fuck, dude?” Peter bites out before turning around. He leaves the party without saying anything to anybody, leaving Johnny behind.
in the room starts cheering and clapping, even louder than earlier. Especially the members of the Avengers all start making winning noises, while May and Pepper just stand at the sidelines with big smiles on their faces and clapping their hands. The kids look away in disgust.
Tony smiles when he sees Peter do the same, despite his tears. He lifts his hand up until it’s in Peter’s hair, and then he pulls him forward again. A short kiss is pressed against the teenager’s forehead. After that, he lets go of him.
She was way too happy to have Steve back, so she decided to tell him about Peter, to change the subject.
And then there’s nothing but a dialing tone. A tear rolls down Peter’s cheek. Taking a deep breath, he puts the phone aside and pulls up his mask again. He almost expects Happy and him to leave the moment he walks out, but he doesn’t expect the confused look he’s getting from him.
“Did someone ever tell you that you have an extremely difficult personality?” she smirked to his back. Logan didn’t even bother to answer to that. “Great,” Yaël mumbled to herself.
“How’s he doing?” Natasha asks. Tony turns his head to the side a little bit, seeing her familiar curls standing next to him. She looks extremely unbruised, and her hair seems perfectly neat as always. Tony feels a shiver going through him upon seeing her.
“So, do you have plans this weekend, Peter?” Steve asks when he, too, has taken place at a stool. The three of them have started on their breakfast, though Tony is still moving slower than the others. Steve looks so genuinely interested, that Peter can’t find it in himself to keep his suspicions going.
Who did this guy think he was, tossing her plates around and shooting holes in her floor like that? Maybe Fury should pay him less after this act of insanity.
“Welcome back.” There he was, the black-haired dude. This time, he had a braid tucking his hair back. It looked kind of awesome, though.
“Not your smartest move, Yaël,” the man said dryly, but he did nothing to help her. After a struggle, Yaël got rid of the flames, but was still stuck with some smoke and she was oh, so cold from using fire as she used a lot of her own body temperature to create the flames. She coughed and rubbed her eyes. Her heart raced as she started to panic.
“Yes, just come in,” he says, voice still raspy. The door opens while he walks back to his bed. Suddenly there are arms surrounding him and a girl about his size hugging him tightly. He chuckles a little bit, patting her back. “Here’s my Munchkin.”
It doesn’t happen often that one of the assigned deliverers fall sick, and they often have replacement for it, but when two of them fall sick at the same time, it looks like the boss has to compromise a bit and send out one of the waiters instead.
“No shit, I would get a fear of normal whales after this,” Harry counters. Peter laughs, and Harry laughs in return, only a bit louder. Peter stops immediately, feeling his eyes go wide. Suddenly all the sound in the class is disappearing, and all he’s hearing is Harry’s laugh, sharp and loud in the otherwise silent room. Is Peter imagining it? Or is Harry grinning here?
This is not gonna do; if he wants to keep being Spider-Man, he’s got to learn to protect himself better. Sure, he’s been doing fine for the past year, but as it turns out he’s no match against Harry. And it’s not like the Goblin is particularly stronger than his previous adversaries, but it’s just because it’s Harry.
Tony’s flying. His body is weightless, he’s seeing nothing more than clouds. There’s no wind touching his face. He must be in the suit. He must be on his way somewhere. Maybe he fell asleep?
“FRIDAY, I know you have to listen to Mr. Stark here, but you asked me for help; you could help me out a bit in return, you know?”
before he started hating him, Harry used to look up to his mother, aspire to be like her. Then, after she passed away, Harry never mentioned her again.
“Peter, why are we removing the tracker from your suit?” Ned asks. Peter, with a flashlight in his mouth and a screwdriver trying to get a few things loose. Trying to answer Ned’s question, he takes the light from his mouth, but continues turning the screw around.
for the past week? Tony surely seems to find it hilarious, but then again, Tony has the weirdest music-taste, too.
The knocking gets louder. “TONY, OPEN THIS GODDAMN DOOR OR SO HELP ME I’LL CALL THE RESCUE ARMOR AND FORCE MY WAY IN!”
The Avengers are on a mission. That much he has gathered. What the mission is about, he has no clue. He should probably have gone with them, since he’s an Avenger as well. But he couldn’t. He still can’t.
Raido’s curiously reaching out his little hands towards the hammer, only slightly touching it when Yaël turns around a bit, getting it out of the kid’s reach. Peter follows her leaning against the hedge and looking into the garden.
"Well, uh... I was just thinking-" the Super Soldier starts, standing at the bar while looking at Butterfingers with his hand on his chin.
. Did she not once mention ‘Stark’s heirs’? How Mr. Stark’s offspring would be equally in control of FRIDAY as he is. With a soft gasp, he thinks that he’s figured it out.
“We’re going to Disneyland,” he says proudly. Peter’s mouth falls open in surprise, and his spoon, which he was using to eat his breakfast with, drops down on the table.
A couple of the Avengers look at each other. Barnes meets eyes with Sam and Clint before the three men nod and stand up.
Tony stark knows he shouldn’t be hiding away back at the compound, but still he finds himself right there, doing nothing other than staring right outside and watching the trees shake from the sudden wind that came up about an hour ago.
“Well, as far as I know, he broke up with Steve, so I’m pretty sure he’s not doing too great right now,” Peter offers, giving his Dad a look. When Tony notices them staring, he gives them a wave. Peter waves back, but Pepper turns to the teenager with wide eyes and a mouth fallen open.
But suddenly, Steve stops, face full of surprise as he presses his com link closer to his ear. Tony can’t hear anything anymore, every communication device he has is fried.
angry, and it’s his usual self-defense whenever anybody gets angry at him. He said mean things to Uncle Ben too, the day he died. Things he regrets to this day, but he can never take back. He figures he’s got that outburst-treat from Tony himself?
“You’re such a fucking dickface, you know that, right?” Eddie complains, shoving Flash the moment he reaches him. Flash makes a questioning noise. “Having a pleasant chat with the Penis here, aren’t you?”
There’s no robberies, no muggings on the street. The most Peter could do was pulling a puppy from the streets right when it was about to be run over by a truck. After handing the puppy back to the woman it belongs to, he once again gets a few dollar bills pushed into his hands.
“But, Dad! There’s this black goo there,” Peter says, pointing towards the crater behind him. Tony looks at him for a quiet second before gazing to what’s there behind him.
“Ah, my boys grow up so fast,” Tony jokes, pretending to flick away a tear. Peter snorts. He winks at Wanda when they pass each other, suddenly feeling the need to tell Yaël about this. But he can’t, because she’s disappeared without any warning.
“Peter, are you alright?” somebody asks all of the sudden. There’s a knocking on the door following Steve’s voice from the other room.
Of course, the fact that his phone goes off is crap, because he was actually doing good at listening in to these guys. As a result of his sudden interruption, the sellers suddenly point their guns towards the man in the large shirt, who holds up his hands and takes a few steps back in fright.
“C’mon, Dad, can I please come in?” Peter begs. Despite that he doesn’t sweat in the suit, he would really just want to take a shower and relax a bit on the couch for the evening.
The thoughts keep on going through his brain, but nothing comes out of his mouth. He doesn’t even notice the remains of the glider striking his way until he’s thrown to the side and Captain America’s shield is keeping it from piercing through him. When everybody is distracted, Harry tries to make his leave, but War Machine seems to regain his attention just in time to grab him and smash him back into the ground.
By the time he’s finally back under the covers, Tony’s already taken place on the bed as well. There’s enough place for both of them, but still Tony has banished himself to the far corner of the mattress. With his hand in Peter’s hair, the boy starts drooping off.
“Right, uh, sorry,” Peter mumbles, figuring it’s better to just pull back before he gets her angry. She’s known for having a bad temper, after all. He’s about to say something else when suddenly he hears something behind him.
“Your throne.” With a proud face, Thor sat down on the blue metal and white leather chair. Loki joined them and stopped next to Yaël, and quickly stroked her hand as a way of greeting her. More whispering raised from the crowd. Oh, yeah, sure, this was going well! Goddammit, Loki, Yaël inwardly grumbled.
“Jane Foster,” Thor starts, loud voice blooming all over the hall. Steve smiles without realizing it. There was never a doubt that Thor really
“And we’re both here illegally,” Wanda mutters out. Yaël, who was sick of the conversation, put on a Harry Potter movie, just so everybody would shut up about it.
Karen returns. Peter snorts, shaking his head at how stupid that one is. It’s actually such an obvious one he couldn’t even come up with it himself! He’s a disgrace for the Stark-lineage!
the compound. This is a completely strange environment, and everything inside of him tells him he shouldn’t be here.
“Yeah, well, it’s driving me crazy. There’s just so much happening around me I can barely concentrate on upgrading Dum-E’s codes!” Tony complains. “It’s insane, Brucie! There’s noise coming from everywhere! If I stand close enough to you, I might even hear your heart beating.”
That had literally been the last time he’d seen her. He’s never heard of her since, so to suddenly find her son sitting there in front of her… he doesn’t know if it’s a sick joke coming from the universe, or a chance at redemption; a chance to do right by her by helping out her son.
“You ran away yesterday,” Tony says shortly, with his hands in his pockets. At least he’s not wearing his glasses. Peter clears his throat, looking down at his feet with his waffles in his hands.
“Peter, I know you’re only doing what you think is right, but we just want you to pick your battles wisely,” Steve tries to bring down the situation.
“Hey, I don’t care about that,” Steve assures him. “As long as, in the end, I still have both of you, I’m fine.”
X, eh, Charles, whatever, laughed, turned his wheelchair and started rolling down the hallway. “You’d do the same for me Yaël!” she heard him yell right before she closed the door.
“The guy probably quit. Don’t worry, we’ll get him back on the scene,” he says, sitting himself back down on the chair before throwing another item of clothing to Peter. As he catches it, the shirt around him goes back into tent-mode. “Now try on the pants!”
“Indeed,” Loki sighed “So, I noticed something; You told me you have been meeting other men on earth-“
“PETER!” MJ shouts in the background. It’s the thing that brings Peter’s mind back to the reality. Quickly, he puts the mask back, jumping to the side only to barely avoid a kick from Eddie. Eddie, who is wearing a mutated version of the black suit Peter used to have.
A few taxis passed them. Yaël saw one, clearly driving over the speed-limits, before it stopped in front of them with screeching tires. The driver opened the passenger-door from inside and… WADE?! Why was he driving a taxi?
“Goddamnit, it’s my liver, right?” he groans. “I remember the doctor coming by earlier, crap… why is my brain all over the place?”
“That moment, you couldn’t care less about the universe. You just wanted your son back,” Strange continues to add salt to the wound. Tony’s only aware that his fist was heading Strange’s way until Steve grabs his arm to stop him.
Instead, MJ finally arrives into his new bedroom, her camera in her hand and her hair put up into a messy bun. She’s wearing that green jacket Peter likes a lot, and underneath it a white shirt with the mask of Spider-Man on it.
“No but- uh… yeah? Maybe? I mean, is it possible that, somehow, the person who went back just… hasn’t gone already? Crap, this sounds weird.” Tony slams the journal against his head while he tries to get his thoughts in order.
“The Avengers are in hiding, Natasha’s blonde now, Steve’s in prison and Tony almost died but survived because of a liver transplant,” Peter blurts out. Everybody looks at him with a strange expression and Peter just shrugs. “I simply gave him a quick recap. Oh, and Vision and Wanda are kind of a thing.”
“But we’re going to be fine; it’s going to be okay,” Tony assures him, even though he doesn’t really believe it himself. The idea of having to go on without Steve grounding him just feels like agony.
‘Happy birthday, Yaël’, she thought happily while licking her lips. She didn’t really care no one knew the date of her earth-birthday. On Helvegen, a birthday was celebrated by the start of a new decade. On that day, everyone came together and celebrated each other’s life with a big festival, which always ended with a big campfire and dancing. Of course, that way of celebrating a birthday had its charms too, but on earth, a birthday was more personal, about one person. Sometimes two, but never a whole kingdom.
“Yeah, I already filled in my part, though I’m running out of things to say without revealing our super-secret project,” Peter admits with a light chuckle. His eyes are still red, but there are no more tears in his eyes. Relieved, Tony takes the paper, pulls out another chair to Peter’s desk and sits down while motioning for Peter to sit down next to him.
“Oh, I should make my homework myself, huh?” Flash asks, and then he moves, punching his hand in Ned’s stomach while grabbing his shirt. The next thing is whispered, but Peter can understand clearly what he’s talking about. “Why don’t you ask one of your superheroes to come and rescue you, huh?”
“I know you don’t like getting objectified, so why are you wearing it?” The motorcycle turned on with a hum and Steve steered the vehicle to leave the parking lot it was standing on.
“They’re just telling crap,” the boy mutters under his breath, and Peter suddenly finds himself snorting.
“You go on, I’m headin’ on home. Got some work to do, after all,” she says with a grin. Peter nods, holding up a hand for a high five. When she returns the gesture, he smirks before leaving the hallway. Entering the auditorium for today, Peter is once again facing hundreds of other students, all having taken their favorite seats in the room. Peter clears his throat, trying to catch anybody familiar but failing at it.
“Did you know?” Eddie asks, ignoring Peter’s words. “Did you know somebody recorded our fight? That massive humiliation I got when you punched me a broken nose? The looks I got at school when frail, fragile little Peter Parker managed to knock me out with just one swing?”
“Ah,” he raised his hands, clearly amused by her tone “Welcome to Helvegen! Now that I told you that, you’re going to follow me.” Yaël raised an eyebrow and walked towards him.
“Peter! Someone’s here for you!” the aunt yelled enthusiastically. She quickly ran to a kitchen cabinet and pulled two spoons out of it, pushed them into Yaël’s hands and dragged her to the door of Peter’s room. Then she disappeared. The last thing Yaël heard from her was. “I’m heading out for work now, just shut the door behind you when you leave. I’ve put the key on the table, you can lock the door and put the key into the mailbox downstairs, okay?” Then the front door slammed shut, without giving Yaël a chance to answer.
“I can help, too?” Scott suggests. Hope gives him a smile and puts a hand on his cheek before patting him three times.
Once they get there, Dr. Cho wraps his hands up, counting at least three broken fingers. Tony gets some painkillers, and after that, he’s brought back to his guest room at the building.
“Even so,” Tony suddenly starts without looking up, “Steve is stuck in Wakanda, and I am here. As long as we haven’t changed the accords, we won’t get a chance of being together.”
Ah, what the heck, he just wants the proof. With a small nod, he thanks Wanda. The girl just smiles at him, leans forward to press a small kiss on his cheek – on the mask, of course – and then she’s off again. Internally, Peter swears that if she would ever need help, he’d be there to give it to her.
“Uh, yes, I’m okay,” he lies. He knows he’s not okay, but what is he going to say? He can’t explain it all to Sharon now, can he? Not when Steve made such a big deal of it already when they
“Oh, uh, I think so? I mean, suddenly everything started itching, it was crazy!” he lies, trying not to make too much of a deal about it. He can’t really just announce right here that some random girl started kissing him with no warning!
“To me it seems like the guy has some sort of personal vendetta against you,” Michelle states while the video is still playing. Peter sees himself kicking Harry in the stomach before falling down. It looks much shorter than it felt when Iron Man grabs him and quickly flies him away from there. “Care to explain, Parker?”
“Uh, hi guys,” he mutters, instead turning towards the bed and finding Tony lying there, looking like he’s ready to fall asleep on the spot. Next to him stands Steve, still in his uniform. The two of them are the only ones not looking at Peter. That makes it even worse.
“Dad!” Peter complains again. He tries to push the man away from him, but holds himself back when he thinks back of the wound on Tony’s chest. Does it still hurt? He doesn’t know, since Tony never talks about it.
“I’m sorry, Tony. My head was wandering off,” she says quietly, though forcing a smile on her face. Tony nods, giving her a smile as well.
And while he’s talking about strange, he wouldn’t have expected to meet Dr. Strange and another man along with it.
Peter wonders why he isn’t just going home. He doesn’t know those people, and even finds himself disliking this Wade-person that has been stalking him at work for months before now. Sure, Yaël seems friendly enough, and Peter’s sure that she might one day be a great hero, but it takes only a short conversation with her to know that she’s a bit gloomy.
The needle pokes through Mary’s skin without trouble. Once he thinks he’s in deep enough he grabs the vial and pushes it into the holder. Once he sees it fill up a small smile comes up onto his lips. Mary, too, smiles for a bit.
She was so sucked up into the fight, that she almost didn’t notice the fireworks shooting form a crashed down spaceship and a badass-looking, armed woman walking out of it. The woman immediately owned everything that crossed her path.
He sounded a bit aggressive, which made Yaël only wanted to back off more. This wasn’t her friend talking to her.
There are slurred responses from the others. Sam’s out from the world and Clint’s about ready to drop down as well. Bucky, in his confusion at Bruce’s sudden departure, loses his balance and drops down. With that, he takes Steve down along as well.
May arrives an hour after Peter’s brought here. They guide her to the room, and she just silently grabs a chair and sets it on the other side of the bed to take Peter’s hand into her own.
Yaël didn’t even had the chance to react before it happened. Smooth and quickly, Nilla slit Raido’s throat.
But he has to do it with what he has. Sure, it’s going to be tricky to inject the nanites into multiple skeletal structures in his body, but he’s done some crazy shit before. Just to make sure, he also takes out some of the heavy pain-medication. Self-medicating is probably the worst idea ever, but he’s not really looking forward to feeling his bones being punctured every time again and again.
Somehow she managed to do her make-up and floundered herself in one of the new dresses she had bought with Wade, because her drunk brain made it seem necessary to look good so when she’d be yelling to Peter, he’d be intimidated by her good-looking-ness. Of course there was no logic there, only her drunk brain that was glitching around. In her head, looking good plus being angry would make her seem like a goddess.
“That’s odd, you told me you quit band-practice last year,” Tony says, playing along for now. But the anger inside of him is getting damn stronger each time. “What’s up?”
May has been offered a bed to stay the night, but she’s refused it. Staying with Peter while he sleeps, May explains that she’s perfectly comfortable like this.
Outside, he can see Steve and Sam sparring together. It seems like a lost cause for the Falcon, though Peter thinks the Captain is taking it easy on him. He decides not to interrupt him and just walks them by.
Steve huffs out a small breath that reveals to Tony he’s smiling. Quickly, Tony turns his head to give Steve a kiss on the cheek.
But Yaël was smart enough to understand. Fury put her in a cage like a wild animal to see if she’d become the beast he thought she was.
“And I love you, too,” Steve whispers to him. “I love you so, so much.” Tony pulls his hand away, instead opening up his arms as an indication for Steve to collect his hug. Steve kicks off his shoes, lowering himself down on the bed until he’s between Tony’s arms. Wrapping them around his partner, the two men close their eyes again, breathing in each other’s scent.
Yaël saw someone stepping outside the lift. Was that…her lord and savior, Peter. She jumped up and ran towards her friend. “P! How did it go? Are you, like, hired?” she started rambling, trying to escape from the god, who was still watching her.
Peter can almost roll his eyes at her compliments. Actually, his life is still kind of crappy. The only reason why he’s even considered it is because he wanted to get to know his father.
The boxes are secure. Peter pulled them all together with his web. Sitting on top of the cyclone rollercoaster, he could see Happy search for him, letting out a relieved breath for not losing the stuff.
“That Goddamn Goblin came back!” Mr. Stark grumbles. “That’s the second time he grabbed him already!”
“Has your brain been ripped out too?” Yaël growled as she walked backwards into her apartment and shut her door while Wades face was still planted against her chest. Wade mumbled something. “What?”
Peter shrugs again. “I’m renting a place not too far from here. It’s actually just a two minute walk, right next to this nice little coffee shop-“
problems. Often, Tony finds himself envying them. In a lot of occasions he finds himself wondering to himself what his life would have been like had it been different.
The first person comes out with his hands in the air, quickly followed by two others. The three of them allow themselves to be taken into custody with no fight or struggle. If only everything would go so easily, Peter wonders to himself.
“Uhm, let me see… Null, en, to, tre, fire, fem, seks, syv, åtte, ni, ti.” Wade clapped for her way to enthusiastically
Then the Mary on the screen pulls up a picture from somewhere. She points it towards the camera, so Tony has a good view on what’s on it. He recognizes Peter instantly. He’s so young, sitting there between Mary and the man that must be Richard. Tony chokes only a little bit when he sees that it’s a picture of the family together.
Peter shook his head. “N-no, but instead of being grateful that Tony rescued me, I told him that he might be my father, but he wasn’t my dad…”
Peter looks to his side, seeing the black suit lying on the ground. He frowns, moving to the side of the bed and reaching out for it. Once his fingers grab a hold of it, he blinks a few times in confusion. Could it have anything to do with this? Is it possible?
Much to both their surprise, the elevator pulls through. The moment the door opens, the smell of beer fills into Peter’s nostrils. There’s a heat going on, one that comes with having too many people breathing in the same room. Against the wall, there’s a couple already making out. Another girl is passed out against the wall.
“No, no, no, don’t do this! I’m in a relationship,” he mutters out. Tony smiles lightly before pressing a kiss on Steve’s lips.
“Peter, can I come in?” Tony asks. There’s no answer, causing for him to hesitate for a little bit longer. He searches inside his head, looking for assurance that Peter’s actually in the room. When he finds confirmation for it, he reaches for the doorknob to get himself in.
There’s more laughter. The pressure on his chest gets even stronger. Peter finally opens his eyes and grabs the foot, but holds himself in on pulling it away. He doesn’t want to raise attention to himself.
Then he raises his other fist, preparing himself to throw a punch. Tony shouts, tears in his eyes already forming. He’ll be too late! He won’t get there in time! But then the fist stops midair. Thanos’ head turns to the side, as if he’s being spoken to. Tony can’t see who it is. Whoever it is, he’s fucking grateful for buying them time.
Tony hums in agreement, lifting Steve’s hand towards his lips to press a kiss on his knuckles. With a quick glance to the street name, he memorizes where the festival is so they’ll find it again afterwards.
“It’s alright, Steve. I already knew what they were going to ask. Telepath, remember?” Wanda points at her head to accentuate it. Steve closes his eyes and groans even more. Meanwhile, Tony is still trying to regain his breath after almost choking on his coffee.
He almost drops the phone down when it suddenly starts vibrating in his hands. An unknown number shows up on the screen, indicating an incoming call. His senses are giving him mixed signals here. One part tells him not to pick up at all. He has no idea who it is, and he might cause trouble in one way or another.
“And that’s why you were late?” Steve asks, sounding a bit concerned. Peter sighs before dropping his head on the table.
“What the hell is going on?!” she barked at him. She might be exhausted after trying to use her air-powers, but this man made her freaking rage! Yaël really didn’t have the money to buy new plates or to pay Peter’s hospital bills if he’d get hurt.
, his mind tells him. Tony automatically puts a hand on the man’s cheek, slowly caressing his skin as their eyes make contact.
Michelle doesn’t pay any attention to him, but Liz does. A bit flustered when she passes along her questions from her cards, she barely even dares to look at him as she expresses how glad she is he’s back. Peter lets out a small breath and nods at her.
“Stark,” is the first thing Steve says when the doors slide open. Tony doesn’t startle from it, already aware of how Steve used to make his entrance back in the day.
“He’s got that from his dad,” Steve adds to that, but only a bitter chuckle comes out of Tony after that.
“He dropped a building on Peter’s head,” Tony says, startling Steve. He almost falls out of his seat, jumping up on his feet while he looks at the door as if he could see him standing there. The last Steve can remember about him was about an hour ago where he was stuck in another fist fight with… he doesn’t even know. Nor care.
“But, then why didn’t you tell me anything?” Peter asks in confusion. May sighs, putting her hands on her hips.
“So, you got possessed by an Alien symbiote?” Yaël asks as they walk into some sort of garden. It’s pretty dark, but the snow on the ground is still pretty obvious. Peter lets out a long breath, seeing a cloud appear in front of his mouth. He wonders about the baby for a bit, realizing only a little later that the kid is part Frost Giant and can probably handle the temperature like this.
Darcy starts walking off after that, probably searching through all the other people here to get somebody that pleases her eyes. Steve notices immediately when she spots Sam sitting there, still looking at whatever beasty they got.
“I know how you got lost last time, so I figured I could just bring you there, instead,” she says, but the look in her eyes make clear that she means a bit more with that. She’s here to offer him support, he figures. She knows he’s having a hard time – probably because she read his mind before knowing it was him – and figured it out.
Images of New York are shown; the Hulk causing rampage as he takes out a few chitauri. That’s when Rhodey looks away, turning his gaze to Natasha, who is still unmoving. After New York, there’s images of Washington, the helicariers. People drowning because of the flood created by the crashing ships. Now it’s Sam and Vision’s turn to look down.
Hela’s eyes burned with fury as she raised her hands and made a giant spear that pierced through the ship and made it stop from leaving the planet. Then she stormed towards Yaël, who desperately tried to keep the witch back by cooling herself down to throw fire balls at Hela while still pulling water from her body.
Peter sighs, for a moment wishing he would just have gone to Paris with him. He misses hanging out with Harry lately. Not that Johnny isn’t good company, but there’s not really anybody there who knows him from since he was a kid. Harry knew Uncle Ben, talked to him. Harry even remembers Peter’s parents a little bit. The others only met him afterwards. They’re good friends, too, but sometimes, Peter just needs that piece of the past with him.
“H’llo?” he asks without bothering to see who it is. If his eyes won’t cooperate, he’ll figure it out soon enough anyway.
There’s a moment of silence on the other side on the line, and Peter’s already preparing himself for the answer he’ll get. Mr. Stark surely tell him now not to even bother coming back. Peter can feel it. Maybe he
After making sure that Peter’s not going to choke on his own breath, Hawkeye runs back into the action, leaving Peter to recover on his own. With trembling legs, Peter gets himself up. It takes a lot of effort to keep standing, but eventually he’s back on his two feet, trying to get a grip on what’s going on around him now.
“I suspect you’re here for Yaël, aren’t you?” the man asks. Peter nods, unable to say anything. “You’re welcome to come inside. I’ll go wake her.”
“Oh, you haven’t met her yet? Come on, I want pizza. Yaël, get me out of here!” He tried to wiggle his way out of the ice, but that was impossible. He’d have to wait until Yaël freed him or until the ice was melted.
And then they went their separate ways. It was obvious, no? They hardly knew each other, after all. Clint and Natasha were friends for years, sure. Stark had practically adopted Bruce as his brother for some reason. Thor didn’t really ‘belong’ on Earth.
He can’t place the look on Steve’s face. It’s not really hurt, but it’s clearly also not happiness in its true form.
“Iron Man!” somebody shouts, but it’s from afar. His communication-devices are all destroyed. He can’t talk to the others. The Arc Reactor is powered down, the suit is useless. Tony tries to roll onto his back, but even that hurts.
“We’re not supposed to be having some sort of talk here, right?” Tony asks, actually sounding a bit uneasy about it. Ned doesn’t answer. Peter frowns, embarrassed.
“Eh, it doesn’t matter. You’ll figure it out eventually,” he admits. Then he gives Peter a light smile, making clear that he’s not exactly
“I’ll get it,” Steve says, grabbing the wallet from the counter and taking out the exact amount from it. It’s a mixed pot of his money and Steve’s, and while Tony assured him that Steve didn’t have to pay for anything, the guy seems to keep on insisting it. It’s about hopeless to fight him on it, so Tony just lets him be, if that’s what he really wants.
“I know! But I don’t like the idea of my sketchbook staying there with the bird-twins wandering around there!”
), and now these supposed blackouts. Peter’s never been so close to nauseated outside of a disease. With his tablet on his lap and a few teardrops having fallen on them, Peter takes a shaky breath while he tries to hold back a sob.
“I’m so, so sorry beforehand if I somehow hurt you doing this!” Yaël squeaked while biting on her cheek.
And so he tells him of how they started working together, bringing biology and technology together as they started to think about creating better medical equipment. It was something Tony did in between creating the weapons for Stark Industries.
“Yeah, he, uh… I don’t know, he doesn’t seem to be doing so well,” Peter admits, thinking back of the last phone-call he’d just gotten only a few hours earlier. The way Tony looked… it seemed like he was about to lose it again, and Peter didn’t like it a single bit.
Peter fakes a smile. It fools Felicia, who squeezes his shoulder one more time before giving it a light punch.
Peter stands up and holds out his hands to both of them. He would have come between them if there hadn’t been a table in the way. “C’mon dads, you don’t have to shout like this.”
Tony closes the door behind Peter. He doesn’t need to be there in this little reunion, they deserve some time alone. His hand goes to his hair, and he starts to wonder if he should be staying here until he hears the plane leave again, or if he should attempt to walk back and risk seeing Steve again?
“What I’m trying to say with this, kid, is that there’s no shame at all in dealing with some mental issues. More people than you know have had trouble with it in the past.” Then Mr. Stark gets up once more, dropping his glass on the table and slowly nearing Peter at his couch. “I know you’ve lost more people than you should in such a young age. And it’s good that you try to keep them in your mind, but you also mustn’t forget to live in the present, to make new friends and form new families.”
“Oh, god! Sorry!” Yaël yelled as Dr. cho walked outside for a second to get a new bottle and came back in, cleaning her shoulder. She disinfected her hands again and put on new gloves before she went on with stitching the wounds.
“No, I know,” Thor replied. “But he can.” Thor pointed his thumb behind him, to the palace and just when he said it, the towers burst into flames and crumbled down by the power of some sort of enormous demon rising through the whole building.
Thor adds the small bits of decoration; the belt, the buttons and whatever else he can’t really name. Steve has to admit that he doesn’t look too bad. Though, looking at his face, he hesitates on whether or not he should have a shave. He puts his hand on his cheek, looking at his reflection curiously.
“Sam, watch out!” Wanda had yelled at him as she was just going to send out a force of energy, but he wisely closed the door immediately after he almost got hit by one of Yaël’s ice-spears.
“I told Peter about the Infinity War. He didn’t take it too well at first, but now it seems like he hasn’t completely processed it. Just… be sure to pay attention to him in the next few days.” Tony turns towards the hallway that leads to the bedrooms. “He hasn’t been taking his meds the entire time he’s been with Venom, and I fear that he might just stumble into a dark hole when the effects of the suit wears off.”
They formulate a plan. Nobody really involves Tony or Steve, who are still holding each other as they look at Peter’s still form, kneeling down next to them. It’s going to be alright, they’ll go back, and Tony can make sure that Peter will never get hurt by that bastard.
Wanda once told Yaël that she had hated Stark her whole life and she somehow grew out of it once she had actually met him, so that man couldn’t be that bad, right?
For a moment, Peter looks at his hands. Did he seriously destroy his phone like that? And his goddamn controller? That shit ain’t cheap! With a grunt, Peter jumps up from the couch, putting the last controller safely on the table right after saving his game. Without turning off the device, he heads to the remains of his cellphone and takes out his memory card and SIM.
“Please, my singing skills should not surprise anyone,” he says. “You know I once sung a song for an old girlfriend. With Sting, of all people. She loved it, obviously, because I’m good.”
Peter sits up again when, suddenly, he sees the guy she was arguing with running after her. That doesn’t look good at all. Peter jumps up, swinging towards the other building until he’s on another roof that can get him a full view. He needs to know if there’s something going on that needs his intervention here. He might not like Michelle all that much, but she’s still kind of a friend.
Of course, as soon as they ran into the cell-compartment, they got greeted by a whole school of guards, if guards worked like fish, of course. It was when Yaël started grinning, the guards started looking a bit hesitant, but they kept sprinting towards the ‘escaped prisoners’.
“Tony, you’re going first, is that alright?” Tony nods. “Then it’s Steve, and we’ll finish with Peter.”
As if he heard them all coming, the Goblin stops struggling to get the web out of his face, and points the glider back up into the air, managing to escape the blow he was about to receive from the group of Avengers.
“Come on, we need to take those cables out!” Peter tells Tony. Otto screams as well, as if something is hurting him. Tony doesn’t have time to listen, instead grabbing one of the cables Peter pointed at and pulling along with him. When he doesn’t seem to have much success, Steve finally joins in and helps Tony along. Sparks come flying, burning Tony’s hands on some spots. He grits out in pain, but doesn’t say anything.
“Tony is in the hospital, and Steve wants to go back to New York,” Bucky explains. There’s some murmurs after that.
“Because I think the guy has a massive crush on my dad,” he says, once again realizing too late that he said the wrong thing. In frustration he smashes his head against the table and groans loudly. What’s next? Revealing that he’s Spider-Man? That would bake the cake!
“Will do,” Peter assures her. After that, they hang up. Now it’s a matter of trying to stay calm when he returns to the others. If he looks to shaken, they’ll ask him questions. Ned will look at him with those worried eyes, Michelle will press on, Flash will be a dick as always (at least he hasn’t been seen beating other kids around lately, so that counts for something, right?).
“Don’t hesitate, just face it,” she tells him. At least it’s better advice than ‘It’ll be alright, things will be fine blablabla’. Peter nods at her thankfully while knocking on the door. After a short moment of silence, he hears her voice inviting him in. Peter takes a deep breath, and then silently counts to ten to calm his own nerves. After that, he gets inside.
“No. I don’t know if you noticed but Aang is very smooth in handling his powers. I’m… not.” She answered dryly. She had discovered the series a few days ago and she had been binge-watching it secretly. Yaël had also been thinking about it for a few days and she couldn’t shake the feeling that her powers were the source of this nightmare.
“Even more lucky that I did,” she adds, then putting up a video of him and Yaël shouting at each other while everybody around them is staring. Peter is still wearing his ridiculous outfit, but that doesn’t seem to put Yaël off. He can’t hear what they’re yelling about, but he thinks he’d rather not know.
MJ was right, and they finish about ten minutes after Peter joined in helping. After that, MJ fills up a bowl for themselves, handing one to Peter with a playful smirk.
They let go of each other while they head in the hallway. The walls are blackened, the smell of ash all around them. Behind them, Harry is complaining about losing all the stuff he just bought for his departure tomorrow.
“Tony,” Steve starts again, and Tony’s eyes rest on those lips as they speak out his name. Those full lips that can produce the sincerest smile any human can ever manage. Crap, he needs to get out of here,
For once,Yaël wasn't bound to wires at all, she was just stuck in the cage. There were lights shining through the windows of the cottage. It must really be cozy in that tiny house right now, with the sound of the rain ticking on the roof.
FRIDAY tells him without any remorse. Peter groans in frustration and passes a gloved hand through his hair. He hates the ‘Locked-out-protocol’. It’s only designed to make him feel foolish.
“-the Mighty Sorceress, or The Element, or maybe The Rainbow Pony, or…” Wade’s chatter about finding a fitting name for Yaël pulled her out of her thoughts. Peter was even smiling a bit. What a weird group of friends have they created.Yaël grinned. Yes, Peter clearly had become a friend.
Steve shakes his head, but his eyes are still closed. “Noooooooooooooooh! That’s evil! N-no sex for you th-this week.”
A sigh comes from the other side of the line. Thaddeus Ross has since long given up on getting Tony not to call him that.
They’re divorce-papers, he comes to realize. Looking down, he can see that one party has already signed. All there’s still needed is Tony’s own signature. And the urge to sign is strong, extremely strong. But he can’t do that to somebody’s marriage. He doesn’t know this Tony, doesn’t know his reasons for doing what he’s doing.
At first he cried a lot. That was normal during the process of grief. He’d seen his aunt do it, too. It was when he
“I’ve decided to step back from the Avengers,” Tony explains. “It’s not like I can fight alongside them now, and the action is not really good for me.” Tony keeps on toying with Peter’s hair, but now with both his hands.
“Tony worries about him for a reason, Clint. He’s still a kid, after all,” Cap counters, not noticing Peter shaking his uniform dry next to him. “He shouldn’t even be doing this yet, I’m sure he has family that worries about him!”
“There are a whole lot of sub-classifications in our spectrum,” the young girl of Peter’s age – surprisingly enough, her name is Petra – says. Peter blinks in confusion. Should he look it up, perhaps? But what would he need to look up, in that case?
May isn’t too sure about it, on most occasion expressing her doubts about his idea. But he assures her that he knows what he’s doing. So after May, he explains it all to Tony.
Peter has in fact been scolded by Aunt May when she’d heard the news about Peter’s detention. He’s got house-arrest, and isn’t been allowed to leave except for school or the internship. Peter understands it completely, and never even tries to talk himself out of that sentence.
“You have no idea how worried I was. What happened, Tones?” It takes all he has to keep himself from calling him ‘honey’ or anything like that. No longer allowed to do that, he reminds himself.
“Hi, Peter,” she greets him in return. It’s such a stark contrast to the first time Peter met her. For a long time, MJ always came over as a hard-ass, not seeming to care about things. It seems that being with Harry peeled that hard shell off of her and made her a bit more… human? Peter doesn’t even remember when he started to actually like her, but it must be somewhere after her telling Spider-Man that he’s the reason she broke up with Harry.
“I think you guys have a lot in common, don’t you? It seems so obvious you two are father and son when I hear you talking about him.” Peter shrugged, but Yaël saw the happy smile on the kid’s face. He was doing just fine.
“Hey, eh, Mrs. Maximoff!” Peter says while scratching the back of his head. There’s a chuckle escaping from his throat, and if she could see his face, she’s see a whole lot of red. Err, not that she doesn’t already do, that is. “I thought you’d be with the others fighting the Goblin?”
Natasha. Peter smiles. They must have found a way back for him. Peter turns back to Gwen and kisses her one last time.
“Uh, some renovated building somewhere in Brooklyn,” Peter explains. “Harry and Felicia are here as well.”
It takes a few seconds before Steve realizes what he just said. His hands go up to his mouth, looking like he’s ready to take back the words. Natasha clears her throat again, trying to at least make a
“Intern!” Peter shouts out, interrupting Gwen before she can say it. It’s instantly, a reflex, but one Peter doesn’t regret. When Gwen gives him a confused look, he shakes his head.
“Mr. Stark? It’s me, Gwen!” the girl says in greeting, walking inside what looks like an extremely messy version of the lab. Peter’s a bit surprised to see that it looks like many things have exploded in here, while in his world Tony keeps his workplace neat and organized. Maybe that’s because he’s sharing it with his son, or maybe…
“Uh, my room is this way,” he offers, pointing towards the hallway that lead to all the Avenger’s bedrooms. They’re all unoccupied now, as far as Peter knows. “I’m staying next to the Android that doesn’t like doors.”
“Right, Coulson,” Tony mumbles. He shouldn’t be too surprised that he’s not dead, he supposes? Not that Tony’s not glad, but the fact that he’s been a live and hasn’t contacted Pepper since then…? She’ll feel angry the moment she hears it.
“Thank you,” she says after he motions for her that she can pass. He doesn’t really know what to feel when her hand is gently put on his shoulder for a few seconds only to be pulled away again. Wordlessly, Peter turns around to see her walk away.
Tony looks up and then nods. He doesn’t speak. His dinner has been brought earlier, but he hadn’t taken much of it, really. It’s a distraction after all, and he doesn’t need that. Besides, the idea of eating makes him want to puke on the spot.
“You’re hopeless,” Steve mutters into his ear. Tony rolls his eyes, taking a quick sniff in the air to find out what they’re going to eat.
“No, no, us bugs have to support each other, after all!” he says, winking at Peter who gives him a knowing smile.
Hilde smiles despite her constant tough act. It’s obvious she’s containing most of her enthusiasm, keeping her distance from the group.
As soon as Yaël and Wade were out of his eyesight, they started laughing and didn’t stop until they were in her apartment, dyeing her hair again.
In a sudden moment of panic, Tony throws the book he’s holding to the side, pressing his hands against his forehead. He leans forward in his seat, realizing this his breathing is too fast and too faint.
," he complains. Peter makes a disgusted face. Given the fact that they came out of their bedroom, that can't mean much good.
“You think, what?” Natasha urged on, walking forward and putting a hand on Steve’s shoulder to assure him that she’s there. Steve cleared his throat once more.
“Sorry,” Steve says. Tony turns around once he hears his voice, but with the first journal he could find in his hand he doesn’t stand up instead leaning back in his seat. “Tony here?”
That, and there’s also the fact that Deadpool saved his life that one time, but that’s a story for another day.
“He’s… my father. The reason why my mother didn’t want to speak with him anymore is because she accidentally cheated on dad with him,” Peter admits.
Much to his surprise, she charges after him, a grin wide on her face. Peter once again jumps to the side, not even getting his chance to ask his question.
And so Tony goes. The moment the door closes behind him, Peter almost smashes his hands on the table and turns to the four men in the room with eyes wide.
“Last I remember, you were with him during the whole fall of SHIELD. You, as much as he, could have told me
Yaël looked around. The place looked so fresh, decorated with plants of all kinds. She even had one of these fluffy rugs next to her bed. Well, she actually had a bed, instead of a few piled up mattresses. Without a warning, she jumped onto Steve and gave him a tight hug, which actually hurt a lot, so she quietly yelped.
“No, I’m not calling him when Dad’s around. That would be a crap move,” Peter tells him, taking the phone and putting it back on the desk. A short look around and he sees Dum-E is rolling back from the little kitchenette to bring him a bottle of water. “Now I’m going to stretch my legs for a bit, just put the water on the desk.”
“I don’t know, probably. Why don’t you ask them?” That was a good idea, she should call one of them. “So do you remember what language they speak on your planet?”
“Don’t bring up the swear jar or I swear I’ll jam that stupid thing over your head,” Tony mumbles, causing for Peter to laugh. “Besides, who the fuck-“
Peter lets out a shaky sigh, realizing that there’s a tear rolling from his eye. When did Steve even send this? Peter turns the letter around, trying to find anything else written. All he can find is a series of numbers. It looks like… a PIN?
Rolling over on the couch, he turned onto his back and pressed the palm of his right hand into his eye and groaned a little, the pain of a headache that still hadn't left him throbbing in his skull. He cracked open his eyes and saw two figures standing beside him, the light catching them both from behind and making them both glow like ethereal angels from upon high.
Steve just stared at him a moment before he crowded into his space, backing him against the car, making him stumble a little and catch himself on the fender, and he made a weird, strained sound as his ass hit the automobile.
The doors closed, the elevator departing, and Steve let out a sigh then turned and went into the kitchen to find Olivia tucked into her highchair and Tony at the counter, chattering at her as he went about preparing her bottle. But he must have sensed Steve had come into the kitchen, as he said, "I take it the Hardy Boys are gone?"
Tony was quiet a moment, and he nestled a little closer and tightened his arms some and said, "So…would you say that you love me?"
It had taken him a long time after Afghanistan to even be able to tolerate water to any large degree. Showers were definitely easier than baths to deal with, though. Being under a spray wasn't quite as bad as the possibility of being held under a tub of water — not that anything of the like had happened to him since then, but it was hard to shut off that way of thinking once it had formed under duress no matter how little water he filled the tub with or how many times he checked and double-checked to make sure there were no threats in the vicinity. Things had definitely gotten better or easier for him, but he wasn't sure there would ever be a time that he wouldn't have some niggling fear at the back of his mind, some little thought that played over those horrible memories time and again.
Tony, lying on his side, just continued to laugh as he reached over and pulled the baby to his breast. "Suck it up, Rogers," he said as the baby began to nurse from him. "Don't be such a baby. Little pain never hurt anyone."
"You know, it didn't seem that way at the time. And for the record, I'm not sure if I'm talking about back then or last night."
"Yeah?" Barton grabbed some plates and some flatware. "Then I expect the same of you when it turns out it
He hadn't forgotten about what the doctor had asked for, and when Bruce showed up in the penthouse later that morning after the other moochers had left to do whatever it was they did when there wasn't any Avenging to do, Steve appeared from out of nowhere (OK, actually he just happened to come downstairs at that point in time) and said, "Bruce, Doctor Ganford wanted Tony to see about getting some blood and urine tests done. Tony would feel more comfortable if you could do them for him."
"I've done it before," he said and fiddled with the straps, fitting his breasts into the cups and tugging on it so that it fit as comfortably as it possibly could. He sighed a little when he thought he'd gotten it, and he held his arms out and modeled it and said, "Well? What do you think?"
Tony snorted and rolled his eyes. "It figures he would. Daytime TV talk shows where a woman's got, like, three possible guys that could be the father, and they do a DNA test and then reveal it on the show. Don't even think of searching it out. You wouldn't like it."
Tony stared at him, the tablet heavy in his hand, and knowing Bruce, just like Steve, had more important matters to attend to and he really was OK at the moment, he said, "Yeah, fine. I'll be in my lab."
He swallowed and knew he had to choose his next words carefully because he wasn't about to let his last conversation with the one he would always love end in pain, accusation, and hate.
He settled back into the couch with her, and she curled up tight next to him as JARVIS loaded up the movie for them.
"And the Goddess's spells are of an entirely different persuasion. Only she has the means to rescind them."
bad though — or maybe a little disconcerting, anyway — was the actual production of milk. To say that Tony was producing milk was an understatement. He'd read the literature — yeah, yeah, he'd been reading up on this shit more now instead of leaving it to Steve — and he found the overabundance of fluid was totally natural and would even itself out once the baby got onto a regular schedule.
Slowly, Steve removed the photos from the box, grasping them in one hand and setting the box to the side with the other. A serious frown covering his face, he stared down at the photos, looking through them one-by-one. Tony bit his lip some more as he tried to decipher what the looks on Steve's face meant, and he even wrung his hands together somewhat when Steve was going over his fifth look-through of the photos, that serious frown never flickering for a moment.
"—but don't think I'm some goody-two-shoes choir boy that never did a bad thing in his life," the Cap said, steamrolling right over his words and evidently not even hearing that Tony had used his actual, given name for the first time in their relatively short acquaintance. "I was a poor kid from Brooklyn. We never had that much money even before the Depression. Sometimes, you had to do what you had to do in order to get by, if you get my drift."
Tony heard the teasing lilt in Steve's voice, but he still ignored it and snuffled once before he launched himself at Rhodey, throwing his arms around his shoulders and hugging him tight.
She just stared at him, her emerald eyes scanning over his face before recognition dawned therein. "Oh,
He turned just as Steve sucked in a breath to probably say something to that, and he followed Hill out into the press room, Rhodey, Pepper, Natasha, and Steve following behind. There was a crescendo of murmurs that began at one end of the crowded room and echoed into the other as the audience members recognized the woman now stepping up to the podium, Hill, Pepper, Rhodey, Natasha, and Steve standing just behind him, and several of them got up to try and get a better look. Several flashes went off, the red lights of TV cameras glowing in the back of the room, and Tony motioned for everyone to be seated and to be quiet, and once the murmurs had gone down, and with his friends and family gathered behind him, Tony cleared his throat and said, "Uh, so, I guess you're all wondering what I'm doing here. I'm sure you were expecting to get some news on Tony Stark after all these months, and here I am instead. But the thing is—"
team. The one he was still on. Because Steve could go fuck himself if he thought he was taking Iron Man away from him, too. He had no fucking autonomy over his own goddamned body, but he could still fucking be Iron Man, and damn Steve to hell for thinking he could take that away from him.
Tony relaxed back into his chair and said, "That was also a thousand years ago. Things change. I'd say we also have FM radio now, but we're already up to satellite, so who cares about that?"
"Or what? What are you going to do?" When Steve just stared back at him but didn't say anything, Tony said, "Yeah, that's what I thought," and turned and made to go back to the car. "Get in the car. We're going home."
Steve opened his mouth to respond, but Thor, digging through the fridge for something to eat, said, "I trust it is a good thing you did not accompany us on our beach adventure then."
"No, you won't," Steve countered and took hold of Tony's hands to help him up. "Come on. Let's get you cleaned up and settled into some comfortable clothes. We have to go debrief with Hill, but I'll make your excuses for you, but
He expected another shot in the ribs at that, but he got nothing. In fact, he'd noticed the little monster's activity had quieted quite a bit as of late, and he could only presume it was because he'd run out of room in there. Bruce had run some tests the last time he'd been up there and had determined everything was progressing normally, so he wasn't worried on that front.
—" he pointed at Steve, "—are going to take me out for the biggest, best breakfast my ill-gotten gains can buy. But you're the one that's actually going to hand over the dough because you're a gentleman like that."
. Which…was kind of insulting to people that had fled the Dust Bowl, and yeah, maybe not his most kindest or most timely insult, but whatever, hormones raging, wrong body, cut him some slack.
He tugged on her arm just a little to get her to follow him into the kitchen. "Uh…well, I was working on stuff, and I, uh…"
"I mean did you…" Steve's face pinched into unease and a little confusion. "Did you do it the normal way?"
Tony carried her upstairs and into his bedroom. He dropped her onto the bed, and she bounced around a little and tried to get comfortable, but Tony frowned at her ensemble and said, "You can't sleep in that again."
"I know I can't bring Barnes back for you without dragging him kicking and screaming and snarling and probably getting knifed, but what about
"People know we're dating, Tony. It's public knowledge that Captain America and Iron Man are together."
He went in the fridge again and looked around, and he grabbed the small bottle of red stuff and set it down beside her plate.
"It is not such an awful thing. The bond between mates is so strong that it can work to better strengthen the relationships of those around them."
to be one. It cannot be both. But that's not the way you see it, now is it? You're not certain who or what you are now. Yes, you feel comfortable in your other body — your male form — but you've grown to find comfort in this one, too, haven't you? You enjoy the way your bonded looks at you and the way he touches you. The way he puts his hands on you. The way he fits inside you. You enjoy the way you look, the way you feel, the things you can do."
He tried to hide his smile because he didn't want her to think he was laughing at her, but the amount of fire in the belly of this four-year-old was a sight to behold. She was brazen and sure of herself, and whoever Tony had partnered with to raise her (someone much older than Tony, evidently), they had already done a pretty good job of making her feel like she was a valued member of society.
"That's not what I was going to say," Pepper replied then took his arm and said, "Come on. Let's get off the dance floor."
"Who, Hill? Yeah, I think she'd be kind of insulted if she knew we were calling her the Avengers' babysitter."
If he was in a better place, he would note that Steve looked practically gutted by this, grimacing and looking like he was on the verge of tears himself. But he wasn't in a good place, and he couldn't possibly be bothered with whatever emotions Steve was feeling at the moment.
Natasha rolled her eyes and muttered something in Russian that Steve was pretty sure translated into 'stupid goddamned boys' before she turned her attention back to the TV. Thor was just sitting there watching the events unfold with amusement lighting up his face, and it was at that moment that a phone left on the coffee table began to beep, and Sam whined while Bucky made some sort or weird, smug laughing sound and sat up, reaching his hands out to Sam.
"No, but you handle it a damn sight better than probably just about anyone else in your position. Hell, I'm not the same person I was five years ago — and I don't just mean because I've got tits and a vagina and am quite obviously pregnant with a previously dead man's child."
"Wait, are we talking about actual breakfast food or dicks now?" Barton asked. "Because you have a disturbing habit of turning the most innocent expression into something about Cap's dick."
to begin with — pregnant, female, heartbroken. He'd still have this baby. He didn't have a choice. But now, he was starting to wonder if it wouldn't be better — and safer — for everyone involved if he put the baby up for adoption. Keeping him would be putting a huge bull's-eye on his head, and Steve was right when he'd said back in the winter that Avengers Tower was the last place to raise a child, Tony's two-day adventure as a father to an alternate-universe daughter aside. He could have the record sealed so that no one could open it and, thus, no one could trace the adoption back to him. Or whatever assumed name he would use to formalize the adoption. He'd make sure the baby went to parents that would love him and cherish him and treat him with all the courtesy and respect he warranted, and he'd set up a trust so that he would have all the funding he could ever hope for to pay for the education he so richly deserved. He'd make sure that Hydra in particular couldn't trace the child back to him and Steve, ensure that Hydra kept their tentacles off of him, make sure their kid had the happy and loving and
But Steve just laughed some, and Wilson said to no one particular, "Hey, could someone pass me the milk?"
"Oh," Steve murmured and pulled the picture out of his pocket to show Hill, handing it over gingerly like it was a precious keepsake, and Hill took the photo but smirked a little at Tony and said, "I didn't know I ever didn't." She looked at the photo, her eyebrows raising a little in awed amusement. She glanced up to Steve and Tony and said, "Wow. So, does this make it more real for you?"
"Yeah," he said with an exhale of breath and rubbed his free hand against the back of his neck, "it's kind of a long story. Just a..." He looked back at Tony and kept his gaze again as he added, "Something that happened to me a long time ago."
Wilson groaned and muttered, "It's nine o'clock at night, man!" while Barnes said, "I told you. I'm not even sure I want to—"
Tony rolled his eyes and groaned a little as the host conceded that was a good question that deserved an answer, and he shook his head and went back to eating his sandwich as the host moved onto some fluff piece about a wildlife reserve, and he swiped off the feed and scanned over some stock prices and read over a reminder that he had promised Pepper some new specs for energy projects, and he sighed and finished off his sandwich and his juice — Jesus, Steve really had domesticated him, hadn't he? — and headed in the direction of his lab to lose himself in some of his projects.
"Yeah huh," he said and dropped a pat of butter into the pan, trying not to laugh at the fact that alternate universe Cap was evidently a slob.
to? Hadn't once been enough? And besides, would Steve even want another one? Much as Steve adored Olivia, he hadn't even wanted a kid in the Tower originally. He was sure one was Steve's limit, no matter how much Steve may have, deep down, wished for half-a-dozen.
He swung a leg over Steve's abdomen to straddle him once more, and he reached out and took the phone and the tablet out of his hands. He set them on the table beside the bed then ran firm, possessive hands up the hard lines of Steve's abdomen.
Once they finished cleaning off, Steve wrapped Tony up in his best towel and dried his hair off and gave him what extra clothes he could find. The t-shirt and boxers were a little big on him — OK, the t-shirt fit pretty well, seeing as, according to Tony, Steve didn't know his clothing size and bought his t-shirts two sizes too small — and as Steve finished cleaning up in the bathroom, Tony helped himself to looking around Steve's bedroom. It was only at that moment that Steve remembered that he'd left that stupid webpage up with the story about Tony's 'proposal,' and he stuck his head back into the bedroom just as Tony bumped the mouse to knock the screensaver off, only to display a photograph of a groomed, grinning Tony Stark from the other night's gala with a big, black 'wedding bells' headline.
"It's something I started on a few weeks ago," Steve said, and Tony just blinked at him and shook his head a little.
"Yeah, slapping some deli meat and cheese and lettuce and tomato and mayo on a couple of pieces of rye isn't exactly 'cooking.'"
"Yep," Tony said, hoping to god Steve wouldn't dwell on it for too long. God, he did not want to get into his past dealings with Ty tonight. That was definitely not a sort-of-honeymoon conversation to have.
He shrugged but wouldn't meet Steve's eye. "Let's just say this hasn't been the…worst… experience I've ever gone through. I mean, questionable ethics of how it actually happened aside, it's actually kind of, I don't know,
Anyway, she was clever and aware enough to catch onto it, and yeah, honestly, he and the Cap probably weren't the best actors. They probably couldn't fool a four-year-old that had known only that her entire life. She hadn't raised too much of a stink about things being different since her arrival, but that seemed to be because she placed all of the blame on that 'bad man,' the one that had no doubt had sent her there in the first place. He had taken her toys and her clothes and changed the color of her bedroom because he was mean like that. Something told Tony if there really was such a 'bad man,' his aims weren't as benign as all that, and he thought for a moment that the crazy shit that had happened in that other universe could totally happen here in this one, especially after what had happened with Loki and the Chitauri only a month earlier. But he pushed that to the back of his mind and decided to worry about that later. Right now, he just had to focus on getting her settled and comfortable.
He pushed himself away from the glass and strode back over to the chair, and he collapsed back onto it and said, "Cut the lights, J."
He pocketed the phone again, and Steve said, "I still don't want to encourage them by helping to add 'hits' to the sites that post it. That was a candid photo taken at an inopportune moment and disseminated by someone that won't have to live with the consequences."
"Hey, man, that's not cool," Wilson said just as Tony finally succeeded in getting himself up. He righted himself, straightening his clothes and yanking on the bra that was riding up his back some and turned his attention Barton.
to be flattered. They love to be told how pretty and smart and funny and oh-so-wonderful they are. And that's…that's not you. Now, I'm not saying these girls weren't idiots that wouldn't know a good thing if it smacked them in the face, but — and I'm
"Yeah, guy was never very good with tact like that. Don't think he's ever heard the phrase 'letting 'em down easy.'"
He went to fight her on that, but before he could get a word in, she said, "So, I hear you've already got a name?"
Bruce went a little deer-in-the-headlights but recovered enough to say, "Uh, Tony, it might not be a good idea for her to be here when Pepper shows up."
better 'n he is. He likes to boil stuff. That's wha' they did when he was little back when there were
Steve shook his head and kept his mouth shut, but Tony was pretty sure he knew what Steve was going for.
He reached up and wiped the tears away from his eyes, and he scowled and added. "Well, fuck, there goes my makeup."
"I don't think that's how you're supposed to open that," he said through a mouthful of food and then helped her pull the rest of the paper off to reveal a toy telephone that looked like it was made by something called Fisher-Price. It had red wheels and eyes and a smile and a yellow rotary dial, and from behind him, he heard Tony mutter, "You and that stupid phone."
Barnes just shook his head, looking like he was contemplating or debating something in his mind but not seeming to find the words he wanted to express what he was thinking.
Steve did nothing but grind his teeth together some more. Tony could see it in the amber glow of the passing streetlights.
"About what?" Tony asked, and he watched as Steve and Rhodey exchanged slightly uneasy looks before Steve turned to Tony and said, "I, uh—" He dropped his arms, and he reached up and scratched at his forehead. It literally had taken until this moment for Tony to realize it was a nervous habit of his. "I, uh, asked Jim if he— when you— I—"
Tony glanced back and saw Steve eyeing the situation warily, and when Tony asked, "Coming?" Steve took an inhale of breath, dropped his magazine, and got to his feet.
"Maybe next time, kiddo," he said and put it on his list of things to make. A Captain America shield-inspired waffle iron sounded amusing as fuck. Actually, maybe that's how they got it? Maybe that Tony had had the brilliant idea one day to make one?
"Yeah, bullshit," Barton said and yelled out, "Hey, Cap! Wanna grab me a bottle of water on your way back?"
was starting to become a little too uncomfortably commonplace in his life — he sat down at the kitchen island and helped himself to some eggs and sausage and pancakes (and when he went to reach for the coffee carafe, some traitor shoved a glass of orange juice into his hand), and he stabbed a piece of all three with a fork and shoved the bite in his mouth then grumbled about how this wasn't fair and it was discrimination and something about how they'd understand if
Steve glared at him, and Tony puckered his lips and blew a kiss in his direction. He felt the eyes of that elderly couple on him once more, and he turned to them and said, "Yes?" once again.
Jesus Christ. Tony had just been turned into a woman by a mysterious being that had shown up at the end of a battle that Steve was certain she'd had nothing to do with, and all Steve could think about was how attractive he found Tony and how much he really, really,
"I know there's a couple of bottles of milk in the fridge, but that won't last long. Do we have any formula?" Steve asked and rocked back and forth as he tried to soothe the unhappy infant, but Tony shook his head.
"Wherever you'd like," she replied, and Steve nodded and took a breath then began to list out every single ailment, malady, and issue that had plagued him from birth to the age of twenty-five. The doctor at one point asked him to slow down and then repeat the last several as she'd missed them in trying to set them up in her system, shaking her head and marveling at the list of conditions.
Tony winced at the shout and the way it cut straight to the dull throb in his head. "First, ow. What did I say about a headache? Second, hey, wanna shout it a little louder? My parents' corpses didn't quite hear it." He scoffed and added, "Jesus, Howard's spinning in his grave over this."
"Well," the man said and, before Steve knew what was happening, threw himself over Steve in an attempt to reach something on the nightstand beside him. Steve held his breath and hoped and prayed his body would not react to that motion improperly, and right before he thought he was about to give in to the desire of want starting to flood his bloodstream, the man pulled back, something small and black and rectangular in his hand.
Instead, he slipped it onto the chain around his neck, watching it slide down to clink against the diamond and sapphire band Steve had bought him a couple months before. He wasn't sure if he'd keep it there or put it away, but it was there for the time being, and he clasped the chain back around his neck then grabbed the box of photographs and stashed them in the drawer.
Upon reaching the door of the cottage, which appeared to open on its own volition, they were greeted with the humble homestead of the woman perhaps more feared than anyone in the kingdom. The High Chancellor had taken pity upon her, she herself having been orphaned at a young age, and through dealings with the King, he had allowed for her a small tract of land just beyond the village where she could practice her craft in peace.
Other Tony just stared right at him. "I'm really not," he said, even and firm, seemingly convinced of the truth of his words.
Bruce raised an eyebrow at him. "What's really going on here, Tony?" he asked, exhaustion coloring his tone.
He shrugged, and Esmeralda sat a little straighter and said, "Are you sure? If you'd like, I can give you time to think about it."
"It is, babe. That's entirely the reason. You don't want to get a stiffy in front of a battalion of Hydra agents or an alien horde if I happen to refer to you as 'Captain' beforehand. Is it just me, or is it if
. Me." He opened his eyes but didn't look at Tony. "There's a…book." He snorted a bitter laugh. "Guess it's like an instruction book. The care and maintenance of Winter Soldiers. There were words in it— I can't remember them now, but if I ever heard them again — the right sequence—" He shrugged. "They'd have me."
Steve just continued to give him that same look, but this time, he thrust the instruction booklet at him. Tony took it, and he turned it over in his hands then looked up at Steve and said, "Do you think I really read these?"
He pushed forward with it. That was it. That was the breach in the armor. That was the hole in the dam. There was no possible way, if it was 2015, that Tony would talk as though they were still in any way relevant.
Tony shrugged, his fingers moving over the surface like he was typing something more in. "More a code name than anything now, I think. I mean, you lead that band of freak show rejects that likes to call ourselves the Avengers, but 'Captain' is really just a honorary title at this point — same as Natasha and that asshole Barton are 'Agent' or Barne— uh, the one-armed man is 'Sergeant.'"
"If you mean the shield, then...yeah," he said and, to his surprise, found that he wasn't forcing the words. He really did mean it. When it came down to it, in a choice between Tony and the shield, it would always and forever be Tony.
"You're a sexist son-of-a-bitch, you know that? I never realized that about you before. You're a sexist son-of-a-bitch." He let out a bitter laugh and swiped at a few screens. "I mean, you're from the Stone Age, so I guess I can't hold it against you too much—"
There was silence from inside the bathroom before Tony heard the turn of the latch, and Steve appeared looking flushed, somewhat abashed, and so hard it probably hurt. Tony looked him over then said, "You started anything yet?"
The peanut gallery groaned at this, and it served them fucking right for this shit. He was definitely going to pay them back for this. Somehow. Who was most likely to get married next?
Barton snorted a laugh. "What makes you think we're staying in the tower?" He slapped Thor's other arm and said, "Come on. They'll stare googly-eyed at each other all night if we let them."
"I'm sorry, Steve. I didn't know my eyebrows offended you so much. Oh, and my moustache, too. Funny, you seem to be OK with facial hair when I have a cock. But now that I don't, suddenly, you're completely offended by my imperfections."
Steve glanced around the table to take stock of the reaction, the others seeming to fall somewhere between 'curious' and 'disbelieving,' and Jim said, "Yeah, but this is a fairytale, right? An Asgardian fairytale? Something you tell your kids before they go to sleep to scare them into...not running off to the land of the Frost Giants or something."
"It was Pepsi-Cola back in my day. The cheap stuff," Steve explained, in no way defending himself from Tony's accusations. "Coca-Cola was the good stuff. That's what we'd get in the army. Just doesn't taste the same way now. Even the real sugar Pepsi-Cola doesn't taste the same as I remember it, but I don't like that high-fructose corn syrup. It gives it a funny flavor."
"Your pal's trying to teach himself some chords, and the other three went to scrounge up some more instruments so they could have a 'jam' session. Not sure if any of them know how to play a musical instrument, but it makes them happy, so who am I to judge?"
Steve looked to Sam for confirmation, and Sam shrugged and said, "I was half-asleep, but yeah, that's how I remember it."
Through Steve's comm, he heard something in muttered Russian, and then Steve exhaled a relieved breath. Tony presumed that meant Barnes had dropped his arm.
"Finally," Natasha muttered as she pushed forward with a knife and a stack of plates. "Not sure there's anything left with all the heat that was on that cake."
"What made you change—" Tony started to say but then sat upright and added, "Doesn't matter." He jumped to his feet and strode around the table. "So, you want me to teach you how to dance?"
history — hell, the whole world knows, or thinks they know, at least — but…you ever make it with any of those chorus girls?" He put a hand up in defense before Steve could even open his mouth. "And if you don't feel like saying anything, that's fine. That's your history, and I know you're not exact a kiss-and-tell type, but I'm just curious because I know when we started this whole thing up you were pretty damned inexperienced, and I'm just wondering what the extent of that inexperience was."
"Whatever," Tony said with a roll of his eyes before he went back to sorting the gifts, and the conversation thankfully changed from talk 'bond mates' to general disgruntlement at the early hour, as Jim strolled off the elevator at that precise moment, looking a little annoyed as he came into the living area wearing nothing but a pair of pajamas and a bathrobe.
"There's a book, I guess," Tony said and rocked the chair back and forth once more. "It's so old- timey spy-ish, but I guess there's a series of words that can trigger him."
But Esmeralda didn't back down. Instead, she stepped up into Steve's space and said, "Would you have spoken the truth if asked, Captain?"
"It's just a shame the formerly brainwashed assassin didn't want to come. Four times the miserable, four times the fun."
"Yeah, no, I'm thinking more along the lines of a certain bigmouth AI that was probably a little too forthcoming with certain pieces of information."
for Olivia's sake — but he wasn't sure the Cap would see it his way. And Bruce was right. She totally expected for him and the Cap to act a certain way, and she was savvy enough to catch wind of the fact that something wasn't quite right between her daddy and her papa—
Hence why Steve was so fucking precious with that money he'd gotten from the government for leaving him in a seventy-year ice bath. And even that he struggled with because he still didn't think he'd
Olivia just pursed her lips a little. "You should make Papa kiss them away. Papa's the best at kissing boo-boos."
"Wait," Wilson said and pointed between them with his fork, "a coin toss for that was OK, but it's a matter of life and death for the girl's name?"
," JARVIS replied and complied with her order. "I don't know if I like that you can just order my AI around like that."
But the doctor smiled and laughed a little and said, "Then we should be able to get some very good images," and continued to make her way down the hall.
"Really? Oh, well, if you think it's not such a big deal, why don't you hop up on the table instead and spread your legs wide, huh?"
“How thoughtful,” Tony muttered, but Steve just swallowed the guilt that plagued him over Bucky’s continued struggles to come to terms with a previous existence that had only happened because he hadn’t been able to catch him before he fell as well as the painful knowledge that he might never be able to trust his baby girl alone with his oldest friend.
He glanced down at his abdomen and wondered — if just for a moment… No, not possible at all. Alternate universe. Not even worth thinking about.
"Yes," Barnes and Wilson muttered in unison, and Steve glanced up to stare at them in disapproval and disappointment.
and stuff." She made a face like this was the worst thing she'd ever seen. "But usually when you're talkin' 'bout him, you call him 'Daddy.'"
Of course, by the time Steve finally finished and was comfortable with the job he'd done, Tony had to pee again, and he grumbled and fumbled with the dress then sighed and looked at Steve and said, "Help me."
The Wurlitzer was playing some doo-wop song as they passed it on their way to the door, and Tony leered at him and said, "Care for a dance?"
"Here, watch," he said and dimmed the lights to get the right contrast so he could see the specs just like he was looking at them from inside the suit. The newest Mark powered up, and he maneuvered it over to Steve and had it stand right beside him, hands on its hips and head tilted slightly forward in the way that Steve usually stood.
Barton was silent a moment before he said, "Yeah, there's a lot of 'em that don't like us. But I mean you two in particular." He motioned between Steve and Tony. "Who's the one that has it out for you two in particular?"
Steve didn't look any more convinced by Tony's words than he had prior to when he started speaking, but he still nodded and dropped his arms then went over to the collection of wrapped gifts piled in the corner. Barnes watched him walk away a moment then turned to the others and said, "It really bothers him that much?"
Tony, knowing exactly what had caught Steve's attention, smiled a little, and then he put his hands up to his breasts and cupped them gently through the material, making sure not to rip any of the tape that was keeping the material attached to them.
But Barnes just shrugged and dropped his hand. "Pizza. Beer. Bullshitting. We were just hanging out."
But why did he have this weird gut feeling like Steve was going to have to make a choice between them? And why, dear god, did a little voice in the back of his head assure him that if it came down to that, Tony might not be the one Steve would choose?
"Isn't that what you are?" Bruce asked as he stood in the doorway to the kitchen and watched Hill and Natasha finish helping him get dressed. Rhodey pushed past him and came into the room, giving Tony an appreciative look-over as he took a seat and began to type something into his phone.
He swallowed. He could continue to lie, continue to keep up the charade and pretend, but the longer he did that, the more time he was wasting and the more lives were at stake. He hadn't scoped the house out. He didn't know if they were the only two there or not. He didn't even know where he was. He didn't have any shoes on, and that snow outside looked pretty damned real.
He nodded. She was right. He knew she was right, but he couldn't help the twinge of hurt that fluttered in his chest at the knowledge that she was only humoring him — that she didn't believe that he could feel that Steve was still alive and would return home to them, bruised, probably, frustrated, but whole.
Oh, he knew exactly what had torn and what Bruce had stitched, but he didn't really want to think about it.
"Well, look, I don't think they'll be accusing you of dismembering me and stuffing me in a freezer just so you can go out on the town with a gorgeous mystery brunette."
be attending the gala that year (though not giving any speeches; the hell with that). Surprised, but supportive. The Board was breathing down her neck about Tony's disappearance, and she was growing frustrated by the day at the way the media was spinning the whole affair into some illicit and scandalous debacle that called everyone's morality and mentality into question. She had been Tony's friend long before they'd ever attempted to date, and even if their romance hadn't worked out, she was still his friend first and foremost.
He pressed the button for the elevator, and the doors opened immediately. Evidently, JARVIS was on his side in this.
He reached out and grabbed his soda. "Yeah? Well, you weren't in there, so clearly, you don't know. I was. And, as it turns out, there are women out there that would gladly have your super soldier babies and are totes cool with the world knowing that."
"Thanks," Steve said, not entirely sure if that was a compliment or not. He assumed it was because Jim overall seemed to like him and think he and Tony were good together.
Sam and Bucky snorted laughs while Jim shook his head and Thor smiled like hearing this pleased him. Steve watched them a moment before he decided to try his luck elsewhere and left them to their Christmas show while he made his way back to the kitchen, sneaking up quietly enough so that he wouldn't disturb Tony.
Barnes shrugged, but Natasha simply said, "It's not going to happen to you. You're not even fully dilated yet. You have a little ways to go."
"You sure you got enough to make a judgment?" Tony muttered and took another bite of his suddenly smaller sub.
"No," Tony said with a gentle shake of his head and set the mug of coffee down. "Bruce— You know what it is, don't you?"
"Hey, yeah," Barton said, completely ignoring him and presumably talking into the comm. "Someone want to send Thor out here? I need a pickup... Huh?... Mouthy as ever. He's fine."
To be fair, he'd lived forty-odd years of his life as a brunette (excepting one…questionable instance in his younger days), so maybe he was just used to that more?
Steve — not really. Most of that stemmed from whatever residual shit he was still dealing with from Howard. It had become apparent to him, over the course of the few months, that Howard's Steve Rogers was practically a fiction. Was he the steadfast, cunning, brave, tactical genius that Howard had blathered on about? Sure. But Howard had missed the part where Steve Rogers was also a devious, sly, sarcastic little shit that that was not above breaking the rules to do what he thought was Right, and, when he got caught, would then try to talk his way out of it on a technicality that somehow made the person that dared question his method ashamed he'd ever doubted the great Captain.
He leaned down and pressed his lips against Steve's again, wrapping his arms around Steve's shoulders as he and Steve traded soft, lazy kisses. Steve's hands caressed his back a moment before he broke the kiss, and he pulled away and said, "If you don't want another mess tonight, we should probably stop what we're doing right now."
understand. Any of them. Yeah, sure, Barton got to make fun of him and Hill and Natasha got to dress him like a goddamned doll and Steve got to fuck him in new and interesting ways, but none of them understood what this was
"That," Tony said and motioned with a doughnut in the direction of their departed comrades. "I'm serious. They practically
Steve watched him a second, seeming to consider his words before he said, "Well, I wish he wouldn't use us."
Pepper just glared at Tony, and Tony winced a little from the look he saw in her eyes. No, not the anger.
He blew out a couple breaths, and once the pain had subsided again, he exhaled and dropped his head some.
"Oh, no, don't pretend you're better than we are!" Sam said, his gaze focused on Jim even as he pulled Olivia out of the way of Bucky's grasp.
"Oh?" Tony shrugged and walked his fingers over Steve's firm abdomen. "Not a catch. Just a promise."
Tony harrumphed and didn't dignify his comment with any other response except to say, "Sprinkle sugar on those cookies," as he pointed to the sheet of unbaked shaped pieces of dough. "And don't just dump a glob on them. Try to make it look nice, all right? Put some of that artistic talent to use."
He gave her a slightly pained smile, but he then looked between them and said, "You're just trying to steal my date from me."
Steve stepped back out of the bathroom, slight grimace on his face as he rubbed the back of his neck.
but nowhere near as well as you. And you heard that cosmic screwball. We're bondmates — or 'soul mates.' And that means I need you just as much as you need me."
It was in Steve to frown and fight Tony on that. Ask him, again, if he was sure and apologize once more for good measure. But he decided to take Tony at face-value on that for a change, and he smiled and nodded and said a quiet, "OK."
They filed in, one after the other, late one afternoon, chattering animatedly with each other and slapping themselves on the back for a job well done. Even Barnes and Wilson seemed to be acting normal toward each other, and they all took what Tony sadly realized had become their 'assigned seats' in the living room as they told the tale of how they'd kicked the asses of a bunch of kids from NYU.
Tony mewled out a desperate and wanton cry because if Steve kept going the way he was, he wasn't sure he
He smiled at Tony, sort of a soft, flirtatious one infused with boyish charm. He didn't know where it came from — didn't know how he even knew how to contort his facial muscles into that position — but he began to wonder if this whole thing wasn't on the level when Tony looked over at him and made a face.
in stilettos — "when I was younger." He continued to clutch tight to Natasha's arm to keep his balance. "But that was only 'cause I thought I was supposed to enjoy it. I never actually
Tony glanced to Steve, who stared right back at him, and they held each other's gazes a moment before Tony said, "We may have come clean about a few things to each other. Turns out we both have...some unexplained experiences in our past."
Then there were questions about pap smears and HPV and ovarian cysts and uterine fibroids and yeast infections and vaginal bacterial infections an issues with urination, and once he processed what all those words meant, he turned to Steve and murmured, "Yeah, I don't want to be a woman anymore."
Maybe this was the start of a new tradition. He didn't know; but what he did know was that he wanted to give Tony a break after all the work he'd done yesterday. He reached over to the bedside table and slapped his hand around a few times before he found his phone, and he picked it up and turned on the display and grimaced at the time.
Thor and Bruce were already there, sitting at the island, Thor presumably awaiting his breakfast while Bruce crunched away on his. Steve was tending to the bacon at the stove, and Bruce smiled at him and said, "You really shouldn't have coffee, but Steve insisted."
"What else am I going to do?" the Cap asked quietly, and Tony stopped what he was doing to look up at him. The Cap didn't meet his eyes, preferring to concentrate on his task of ripping the napkin, and Tony set the tablet down and remembered back to the Cap's quiet admission of not being able to sleep when he'd 'accidentally' dialed him. He wondered how in the world SHIELD had ever cleared the guy for active duty.
Tony grinned and went back over to his workstation, and he put the apparatus back on and dimmed the lights to pull up the interface and said, "OK, let's go freak the others out."
"Oh," Tony said and pulled away from him, trying to distance himself. If Steve caught on to what he was doing, he gave no indication of it. "Yeah, well, look—"
"Is it?" Steve asked, an amused little smile on his face. His arm propped up on the back of the couch, he extended it so he could reach out and brush his fingers against Tony's hair.
Something cold and hollow shot through him as he felt, for the first time, that Barnes might actually be
"Right at this moment? She wouldn't want to know. I swear to god, I'm going to gag you," he said, working the lubricant between his fingers to warm it up.
Tony smiled a little, and he gave Steve a squeeze and said, "Hey, you never know. Next time could be your turn."
He went to stammer out a response of some kind when Natasha put her hand to the back of his neck and practically purred, "Let me remind you what you have to look forward to," and pressed her lips against his, warm and soft and inviting. Tony squeaked out in surprise, but even to his own ear, it sounded like a slight moan, and he closed his eyes and went with it, hoping it would drive home the message that Natasha intended.
Rhodey murmured a quiet, "Shit," his whole body slackening in a sort of 'jig is up' type of deal. Olivia, on the other hand, sat up at attention and said, "Daddy? Papa, s'that Daddy?"
"Good girl," he said, and some desperate and needy feeling flooded his veins and made his knees go a little weak at the words.
"So, I can't really tell you what happened in that gap between when you fell asleep and now, but I can tell you that everything that's happened has been completely, totally, one hundred percent worth it — for both of us. A lot of really shitty things happened to us, but if changing any of those shitty things meant that we wouldn't be sitting here at this moment opening presents on Christmas morning, then I wouldn't change one second of the past for either one of us."
He had a feeling he knew what Steve was asking him, but he wanted to be absolutely certain he understood completely what Steve was getting at.
Tony didn't know if it was a cry for help, but he didn't see any harm in taking it that way. "Whatever he's paying you, I'll pay double."
He shook his head a little and scuffed one polished shoe against the floor before he looked up at Tony. "You really think that, don't you? That you're not as important to me…"
"Hmm...you know, you're making that sound better by the minute," Tony said but still didn't look at Thor, and Steve found himself suddenly distracted by the baby, who had finished her bottle and was fussing a little, so he missed what Thor and Tony next said to each other, instead putting his concentration on setting the bottle on the table and patting her back until she let out a tiny and satisfied burp.
Fuck. Just saying he didn't turn back at the end of this, would he have to...? You know, stone better left unturned until it was absolutely necessary.
"To what? Him or my stomach? I'm not telling my stomach that I love it, Steve. I will tell my child that I love him. I will not tell my stomach that I love it."
"It looks good on you, Tones," Rhodey said, nodding his approval. "Very—" He cut off and glanced from Steve to Tony and asked, "Is it OK to call you 'pretty'? I don't know what the—"
Steve just looked at him but didn't say anything. Was he telegraphing his moves that badly, or did Tony just know him that well?
"No talking unless I tell you that you're allowed to. Also, I don't want to hurt either one of you," he said and motioned toward the small swell of Tony's abdomen that pushed against the negligée. "I want you to enjoy this as much as I do. I'm not about to hurt you to get my rocks off. I know you enjoy a little bit of pain, but I don't want to do that tonight. I want to drive you mad with want tonight.
"Really don't care what Boris and Natasha are telling you to do right now," he said, hoping his misery wasn't too audible in his voice. "Hydra's a little tougher to outwit than Moose and Squirrel."
for ways to die, but, I mean, I'm starting to feel a little bit of pressure here from people telling me, 'Hey, Tony, don't die unless you want Cap to go postal.'"
"Really? Now?" he muttered and looked down at his belly. "Couldn't have done it when I was in the shower?"
Maybe, in years to come, he could pass it off — hand it over to Sam or Bucky or maybe even Clint if he wanted it (Clint wasn't too bad with the shield, as they'd found out during practices; Bucky...was another story). He didn't always have to be Captain America. He didn't have to forego a personal life just to fulfill the world's desire for a public one. All Steve had ever wanted, really, was a little bit of security and a family to call his own — people to love and take care of, people to surround himself with when he grew old. He had that in spades now, not just one but two families: his extended family of Avengers and the ones that mattered more to him than anyone ever had or ever would — his Tony and his baby girl. And damned if he was going to lose either of them. It hadn't been easy, and he'd made some sacrifices, but he had a family now, and he wasn't letting them go for anything. If that meant giving up 'Captain America' — if that meant giving up being an Avenger — then so be it. He would figure something out. He always had. He was nothing if not resourceful. The serum hadn't given him that.
Steve's jaw tensed and did that funny thing it did when he was grinding his teeth together. "I know," he muttered, and Tony sighed and rolled his eyes.
Not that this was enough to pull him away from his work. Even Bruce couldn't get him to make headway to his lab, and he blatantly ignored Bruce's concerned, "
"Fucking hell, Steve! Look at me! God, I can't even tell my husband I love him without sobbing like an idiot over it!"
the one thing Tony had assured himself was never his, before he turned around and gave the little 'signal' to the rest of the crew that it wasn't that at all — he swallowed and schooled his face into something neutral if just the slightest bit chilly and said, "It's not. Trust me."
"I think you've done your part, don't you? You took down Hydra, took out the Red Skull, saved the world. That's enough for
to either one of them? Well, maybe I would have before you came along, but the point is I don't necessarily
"OK, good." She nodded and typed something into her tablet then set it aside. "That takes care of that for now." She got up and grabbed a blood pressure cuff. "Now, just relax," she said and put it around his arm.
Thor smiled, and he leaned forward some as though to give the impression of imparting wisdom on them.
"Thought you didn't believe in that?" Steve said, quiet, his voice a little gravelly like he hadn't used it in days.
Tony hummed out a thought then smiled and nodded his head to the couch. "Come on. I'm sure you've got a thousand questions turning over in that head of yours."
He lay down on his side, grimacing a bit as he tried to get into a comfortable position, and he huffed and sighed a bit and waited for Steve to get back so he could complain to him.
Oh, good. There were more of them, and he doubted all of them were as good-hearted at their core as James Buchanan Barnes.
The eastern blackout hadn't had anything to do with Strucker's sect of Hydra, and aftermath of that had taken up the Avengers' attentions for the duration.
"Amnesia," Bruce said, and Tony glanced up to him. He shrugged and added, "Guess you got hit with it at some point in her lifetime. According to her, Cap cried because you were out for a while and you forgot who she was. Guess which was the bigger offense to her."
"I was actually talking to the baby, but I'm glad to see you're coming around on my ability to take care of our child."
He slumped down in a chair and sobbed it out, not really sure why he was crying or what exactly he was crying for but not able to temper it just the same. He let the tears fall where they may, but he wiped his nose with his sleeve and tried to snuffle back some mucus, but when that didn't work, he found a roll of shop paper towels and blew his nose into the not-exactly-soft product, hoping none of the others would be brave enough to venture down to the dungeon after they'd seen the murderous expression on Steve's face.
"Look, man, I'm just calling it as I see it. Pepper's great. She's a great girl period. I just don't think she's the one you spend the rest of your life with. I think you two kind of fell into a relationship because you thought you were supposed to. I just think you're better off as friends."
"Hmm…" Tony mused and reached up to play with Steve's hair. "Was this before or after the first written language was recorded?"
They settled back into a silent calm after that, Steve reclined against Tony, his head nestled against Tony's chest, Tony's fingers raking gently through his hair. He whispered a prayer to not let him go back, to let him wake up tomorrow here in Tony's warm, safe arms, and as sleep began to overtake him, he heard Tony murmur, "So, FYI, kinda thinking about putting a workshop in the basement, and this
"True," Barton said. "No one needs to see another repeat of last night's Shake Shack incident." He shivered like it was one of the worst things he'd ever seen before something came to him, and he grabbed his phone and pressed a few buttons and swiped through a few screens then held the phone out to show Tony. "By the way, you're already a meme."
He just nodded and decided to change the subject to something a little less bone-chilling. This probably wasn't the last time he'd have to worry about Hydra getting their disgusting mitts on either one of them, but that was a worry for another day.
Steve squeezed his eyes shut a second, holding his breath as he tried to push that conversation back into the abyss he'd been able to keep it stored for the past couple months. He sort of remembered Thor being there — floating around as he inspected the different pieces of equipment and samples that dotted Bruce's lab — when Bruce had had that discussion with him, the one where he hadn't been able to mask his worried, brown eyes as he'd said, "
Welch hummed in thought then said, "Well, at least the Captain there," he said and nodded his head at Steve. "Until they can find a way of replicating the serum that made the Captain the perfect weapon that he is, they might as well
"I'm not having sympathy pains," he muttered, but Tony knew he was just arguing for argument's sake.
But Steve shrugged again, looking equal parts abashed and nervous. "I thought you were just humoring me or trying to be nice. I don't know. Forget I said anything."
