The second time he sees Steve is at the coffee shop he likes to frequent. Pepper had practically dragged him with her for the next company meeting and surprise of all surprises, it happened to be at his favorite coffee shop.
His skin looks almost ashen in the artificial light of the lab and although the lights in the lab are probably only making it look more severe, Tony doesn't look… great, for lack of better words.
“We should throw Cap a surprise party,” Clint said as he walked into Tony's shop without asking, just a few days before the Fourth of July.
"Okay," Wade said, stepping forward to drop the notebook on the messy desk. "I'm listening. What do I have to do?"
“I don’t know if I should have told my friends,” Peter admitted. “They're… Well, Harry, Gwen, and Liz all seem really uncomfortable. I don’t know, maybe we should have done the usual family only party and then the public gala like we have every other year…”
“How was the funvee?” Rhodey had asked, grinning as tears welled in his eyes. “Next time… you ride with me.”
He did tell Weasel what happened, but he threatened him with violence if he told Peter anything. Bob, on the other hand, would crack under the slightest bit of pressure, even from the cinnamon roll that wouldn’t hurt a fly that was Peter. Tony of course knew, but he wouldn’t say anything either.
Unable to stop him, Wade felt breathless as Peter pressed their lips together. It was their first kiss, and Wade felt his skin prickle as he did his best to overcome his shock and return it. It was messy, sloppy, but it felt perfect all the same. And Wade almost never wanted it to end.
Then, Steve’s hand lashed out, grabbing Tony’s wrist. “You,” Steve struggled to say. “You… could have… saved us…”
“That’s only if you can catch me!” Then, the man turned and tried to run. Steve snagged his arm by the elbow, turning to lead the way back to the tower. He heard Tony sigh, only for his husband to make a disgusted noise.
“You’re both busy,” Bucky said, fiddling with the remote to his TV, looking at some kind of foreign cartoon. “And your team doesn’t know.”
With a sigh, Tony leaned his head back against the console by where his helmet was connected to the ship. His stomach growled, and he licked his dry lips to try and wet them. If there was any more food left on the ship, the Guardians had hidden it well. All Tony found in his extra search was an old walkman.
“Like what?” the man practically hissed, giving a pointed look at Peter. “You want us to make baby bottles?”
Eventually, he found a way out of the box. Well, it was more accurate to say that he found a way to blow it up. With him inside. But he survived. Sort of. He had fought Francis, but couldn’t beat the bastard. He had gotten stabbed through the chest to die in the burning building, but his mutation brought him back, and he’d gone to find Peter. Well, the readers already saw how that had gone.
The third week was tours. They'd go to several different science centers in the city and get a tour of the facilities. These locations included the Baxter Building, Oscorp, and Avengers Tower. The Avengers Tower was going to be fun, since they might get to meet the team and see some of the gear that they used. Of course, Peter had already seen all of the gear, even helped fix some of it, but he just wanted to spend a few years as a normal kid, so he would pretend that he didn't.
“A week ago, the company was going to take on a new scientist from OsCorp, starting new week, once he wrapped up his project there. However, I got a call from Norman Osborn during a meeting with this scientist saying he'd lost an experiment. So I had to tell him we wouldn't be taking him. And he's been harassing the front desk everyday since.”
There was nothing to do about it now, Tony knew. So he laid his head back, and closed his eyes. He let everything fade away into nothingness around him, and just let himself go numb. Through the growing emptiness, there was only one sound before everything went completely dark. One sound, crisp and clear, as if it were coming from all around him.
U was recording everything, and Peter loved to watch as the boots got better and better. He loved watching him fumble around with flying. And when Dummy drenched him with fire extinguisher foam.
“Well, yeah, say that’s a hot spot.” He was a little out of breath, now, taking in a deep gulp of air as he went. ‘Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?”
“There are no words!” Wade panted, Francis laughing beneath him. “Now! Me and you are gonna go fix this butterface!”
Aside from Steve, Bucky got along with Darcy and Peter the best. For some reason, Darcy liked hanging around on his floor, which was losing its cage like defensive measures, and just told him she had ‘beaten a god with his own element’ and that she wasn't ‘scared of some pussy with a metal arm’. Bucky… actually like her. Steve had even pointed out that maybe Bucky could ask her on a date.
“Yoo-hoo!” Wade whistles, beaming when they looked up in his direction. “Oh my god! That was so awes-”
His fathers greeted him, but he didn’t say much. He knew they were worried, he just didn’t want to talk. Instead, he put on the suit and went out early as Spiderman, coming back just before dinner so that Steve wouldn’t find him gone.
Mrs Warren smiled, though she looked a little surprised. “Very good, Mr. Parker. Who wants to go next?”
There was a pause, as they played for a bit longer. Then, Yensin looked up. Little did the man know, what he said next shook Tony's very being.
He blinked, the frowned. The team was asking him to distract Steve for several hours. Alone. Doing whatever it was that Tony needed to do to distract their Captain. Tony didn't want to get his hopes up, but this could be their chance… Well, his chance. To find out if Steve wanted a friend date or a date date.
Pausing, Steve turned to look at Thor. He wondered if maybe he should ask about Thor’s mental state.
When Tony met Steve Rogers, he had tried to hate him. He really had. But he couldn’t keep himself from just… falling in love with Steve. Not the hero worship that he had as a kid, but actual love. He loved the way Steve would try to draw the team when he thought they wouldn’t notice, and the look he got when he felt he had accomplished something. Hell, Tony even loved the way Steve’s brow would get this little crinkle in it when he was confused about something.
“I organized with everyone to move in today, now that SHIELD has collapsed.” Coulson, who stood by a group of what looked to be a mix of scientists and field agents, held up a clip board with some papers on it. “Miss Potts approved, I didn't think to much into it.”
Bruce was the one that dropped him off, geared up with a backpack full of things he would need, a sleeping bag, and a camera.
“Stark!” Rogers voice drops a few octaves into a chilling tone that freezes Tony for a heartbeat. He clocks the quick rise and fall of Rogers’ chest as his parted lips grow into a pleased, smug grin. There’s a hint of panic in Rogers’ eyes, but most of the emotion swirling in them is irritation.
When he’s commanded Bucky off Sam not five seconds later because the man was going blue, he gets a soft gaze off Bucky that makes him cross his arms (carefully over his broken ribs) and lean back in his chair.
The fundraising evening for an independent political campaigning company- ‘Lightning’- was boring; overwhelmingly and stiflingly boring. In fairness, Tony was used to the parties that Howard used to throw before he was murdered, and they were just weaponry orgies with astonishing illegal activity.
Steve rolls his eyes but nevertheless leans forwards to graze a kiss against his husband’s full lips.
“I’ve got Sam on speed dial and Buck’s gonna come in at lunch to make sure I’m still alive. It’s all in hand, Mr President.”
The thought of working with Steve in close proximity after telling him he wished he was dead causes Tony to feel incredibly sick. The thought of pretending that he didn’t love the other man so fiercely it ignited his fucking veins made him feel even worse.
He sounds shaky, but the conviction in his voice somehow causes a pattern of claps to echo throughout the room and a few people cheer. A quick glance to his left reveals Pepper smiling from ear to ear in the wings.
After that, the weeks blur into one. They talk utter shit about each other through the media, only to meet up in the evenings to fuck each other into heaven. It was a fair statement to say that Tony had never found such hatred and pleasure in one person.
The receptionist’s phone rings shrilly, slicing open the silence and she widens her eyes at them both sheepishly.
“What?” Tony yells and jumps in the air to face Pepper, nearly taking out a passer-by on the way. He tries to subtly point at the man and fails. Pepper winces and yanks his arm back down to his side. “That’s Rogers? The biggest political pain in my ass ever?”
“You spent all that time hurting.” Steve whispers, clearly voicing his thoughts aloud. Tony hangs his head as tears prick violently behind his eyelids. “And you never let me help you.”
“You nearly died.” He croaks and more tears threaten to mirror Steve and spill over his lower lashes. “What did you expect me to look like?” Heartache squeezes at his chest so he takes a deep breath to compose himself. Steve notices and lets out a pained whine.
The Avengers HQ had been receiving hundreds of excited calls from the media as the most infamous rivalry in present day politics exploded overnight. Apparently, Rogers had been giving the world complete radio silence after Tony’s personality assassination had reached the papers- a bit unsurprising really.
“That’s good to hear.” He announces and Steve glares at his mocking tone. Dr Beech sighs and puts her signature at the bottom of a piece of paper with a flourish of twirling lines before looking at her handiwork with pride.
When he returns, Bucky’s got a post-it note in one hand and a pen clamped between his teeth. Steve sends Sam a concerned look as Bucky starts to scribble something down.
Steve twists his expression into one attempting to represent confusion and laughs forcefully at Bucky.
Steve’s smiling when Tony cranes his head round to glance at him. It’s not a proper Steve smile though, and that surprisingly hurts. The slightly-scared smirk that is plastered to his ex-boyfriend’s lips is the one he used to save for the cameras back when he was still Captain America. Back when he was the love of Tony’s life. Back when they were all a family and everything was
“I wrote this for my Daddy.” She begins and points behind her at the lake. Steve doesn’t follow until- oh, oh fucking hell. She thought Tony was living in the lake, because that’s where they’d released his arc reactor at his funeral. “He’s not here anymore.” She clarifies to them, just in case they’d missed the last two weeks. Her tiny index finger prods at the thick air with severity. “Momma told me he’s gone to live with the angels, but I think he’s living in the magic lake with the mermaids.” Pepper nods in exaggeration from Steve’s side but he’s too dumbfounded to do anything. “He an’ the mermaids are just friends though, Momma, cos he told me he loves you to infinity!” A radiant smile blossoms over her features before it drops to reveal confusion. “I don’t know how much that is. I think it’s more than three thousand.”
There’s the sickening vibration of a bullet hitting skin, Steve’s mouth opening into a perfect hole of excruciation, and then nothing.
“I let Howard hurt you for too long after the bastard died,” Steve chokes out; a warm flush of frustrated red climbing up his neck as he cries out of sympathy and anger for the hell his husband had gone through. “No more. No more, Tony, I promise.”
“Oh yeah,” Tony taps his finger to his chin sarcastically and makes a show of staring at the ceiling in thought. “Extortion charges wasn’t it?”
Unexpectedly, the eerie silence caging the house when the car finally screeches to a halt was worse than if every siren was going off and thirty riot vans were parked on his impeccably trimmed grass. Apprehension clawed up into Tony’s throat, scratching hot blood from his glands, as he catapults through the door in a tumble of flying limbs.
“I guess I deserve that.” Steve nods quietly, his knuckles clenching through the material of his skin-tight jean pockets. “I shouldn’t have just left without any explanation.”
“Tony.” He feels his body cower away even more when Steve uses his scary, political- alpha- voice to command his attention. “You’ve never shared any of your feelings about that time with me. Why?”
Steve’s tongue flicks out to wet the seam of his lower lip and oh Christ, he had a horny and slightly high-off-Vicodin muscly man on his hands. He couldn’t really complain. His husband was alive, and there had been many moments when Tony had to imagine burying the love of his life.
It’s all quiet for another week before Rogers calls Tony a “useless product of weaponry indoctrination”. Tony’s never been so angry in his life. He goes to The Associates building to scream at Rogers, but ends up slamming him up against a wall to kiss him senseless.
“Stop thinkin’ so loud.” Steve murmurs and presses his lips to Tony’s sweaty temple. Tony huffs into Steve’s pec which causes him to shudder involuntarily at the ticklish breeze of air that furls over his nipple.
“He’s probably tired, restless and jealous.” Pepper mutters with a frown. Her black dress had spots of oil still on it from the protestors earlier but she was too angry to change it so was displaying it like a warrior stance. “I know how he feels.”
“Just like you said to me in hospital: you have nothing to apologise for,” he states quietly and shifts his hand down to cup over Tony’s ear. “None of this is your fault.”
Pepper coughs wetly like she’s trying to cover a sob. She does a bloody good job of it too, because Morgan just beams and goes back to her sheet.
“She’s on the young side, yeah, but Bucky recommended her so she must be good at her job.” Steve placates as they watch Bruce converse with the young woman in the other room. The physicist had taken a particular professional shine to Matilda and it was proving difficult to separate them.
Mirage-Steve dissolves into billions of tiny pieces that explode into his skin- drawing blood from Tony’s empty well of pain.
“Sorry that I scratched you,” he whispers in the dark and Steve curls a hand round his neck to rub his thumb over his jugular gently. “I didn’t mean to hurt you.”
He drifts for a few more hours and obediently drinks the coffee that Pepper thrusts at his face about three hours in. He comes round to somebody gently tapping his shoulder and he leaps up from his position reclined against the Pepper- the woman fast asleep. Steve.
“Don’t joke.” Tony can only whine with a frown as he pulls the material down extremely gently past Steve’s ribs to his waist. Steve’s expression immediately softens into one of guilt, his hand coming up to cup Tony’s jaw and slide his thumb over his soft lips.
Steve turns back to him with a sigh and pushes his hands deep into his pockets. Defensiveness. Great.
His breathing quickened with every word until his chest was heaving with caged sobs; the room spinning in patterns of sterile tiles until everything seemed dull at the edges. Pepper yanks the phone from his hand and places a comforting hand on the back of his neck as he shook through ragged heaves. She says something to Rhodey before hanging up and pressing closer to her friend to rest her temple on his shoulder.
“Fairly,” Steve nods and turns his head to stare at the busy bursts of light that constructs New York. “I’m not gonna fight dirty until he does, Sam. Then we’ll see who’s the right candidate for President.”
This causes the back-breaking weight of remorse sitting in Tony’s stomach to somersault like a trapeze artist. He remembers those clashes with Steve- the bad ones at the end in particular- how similar the hatred he used to feel towards his ex-boyfriend was to dying.
It hits him like a freight train and leaves him reeling. Who knew five simple words of the English language could bruise as much as physical contact? Tony certainly felt bruised: battered and aching and fragile.
Out of nowhere, Steve came hobbling into the hallway on his crutches with a fear-stricken frown imprinted onto his face.
“Are you gonna come out with us?” Nat corners Tony in the stifling moonlight afterwards, the crisp winter air so harsh he was struggling to breathe. He forces himself to take a huge gulp of air, wincing at the iciness that stuck to his tongue and marred his lungs.
“Must be. My god, our Presidential run is going to be good fun.” Not willing to back down from a fight, Tony retaliates with arrogancy that has Rogers frowning.
“Because I love him.” Tony demands with all the certainty he could muster. Then, when he turns to face Steve with red-rimmed eyes: “I love him.”
“I ruined every-everything.” Steve manages to get out through a particularly painful looking crying inhale that sends shudders through his shoulders.
“I’ll never stop loving you.” Steve whispers, the words barely detectable to human hearing. Tony’s lungs seize and he whines softly. Tension suffocates the both of them before Steve’s exhaling heavily and turning to pick Alannah out from the swarms. He smiles gently to himself and Tony braces himself for what’s about to come. “But I love her more.”
Tony tries to ignore him and turns back to his enemy with a forced smile. “How has this year been for you?”
“I must say,” Steve begins to mutter, fingering through the collapsing piles of paperwork on Tony’s desk lazily. “It would be very interesting to know how you managed to pay for all of those campaigns using only the money your sugar daddies- sorry, I mean sponsors- were sending you-”
Tony opens his eyes to flick them to the sky and will them to stop welling up. His throat constricts in a hot ball of fiery aching.
The market bustles away; not one person pays the two men any attention. It’s freeing to be able to converse with someone in public privately, but Tony secretly wishes that someone would jump in and back him up.
“Will do.” The love of his life promises, even though Tony knows damn well he won’t. With one last glance at each other that has Tony physically clenching his ribs to stop himself from breaking down, Steve allows himself to get swallowed up by the crowd, leaving only the heady scent of fresh pine in his wake.
“Morning.” He smiles easily and relaxes when Steve returns the grin lazily. Tony holds up the wad of documents with a flourish and Steve sits up a bit straighter in bed. “Would you like me to sign the discharge papers or can I leave you here a bit longer?”
“It was an easy dig that I’m not surprised you used- after all, there’s a running joke in the city that I’m sleeping my way to Presidency.”
The ICU was again, pretty empty. Only one room seemed to be filled, with a couple of people asleep next to the bed or standing around nervously. Dr Beech reminds them to be prepared, before pushing open a door marked with the number three.
Tony immediately recognises the aftershave wafting from the person. It smells of pine and cinnamon and… home. Fuck.
Steve punches his arm and calls him a cheeky bastard. The room starts to pulse with tedium as it radiates from every skeleton roaming around the vast space.
“It doesn’t make any sense.” Peter voices obediently and Tony jabs his index finger at him enthusiastically.
“I mean, the man knows that Presidency comes with a lot of baggage but god in heaven, I thought we were past the stage of him being pissed because I missed dinner! How has our marriage suffered even more now that we aren’t politically at each other’s throats anymore?”
“He’s not gonna be a better doctor than you, Jenna.” Steve nods solemnly at Tony and Dr Beech makes a noise of knowing agreement. Tony silently mouths ‘Jenna?’ at Steve over her shoulder and waggles his eyebrows teasingly, which Steve suppresses a smile at.
The reason for Tony’s mess is sitting at the kitchen table when he gets back to the house, a laptop open in front of him, his shirt open collared and a half empty bottle of vodka acting as a paperweight and blaring like a siren on top of a folder.
Tony throws his head back in exhilaration when Steve latches his mouth onto the fragile juncture between collarbone and neck- his teeth grazing promisingly down the planes of golden salt.
Tony races to the doors with Pepper hot on his heels and throws a thank you over his shoulder. The variety of patients sat in the main waiting room watch open mouthed as their new President runs past them covered in blood.
“Nope, but I’d like to.” Tony runs his tongue against the seam of his lower lip. “Man, he’s fucking gorgeous.”
Tony silences him with a single look as he nods once, vigorously. “I stand by what I said after the conference. We’ve got to sort ourselves out before we even touch the marriage.”
Tony opens his mouth to argue back when the reality of Steve’s words sinks in, and he has to bite back his retort grudgingly.
Rogers’ right hand man looks decidedly uncomfortable with the tension and shuffles his feet with a cough.
Matilda raises her eyebrows slightly in support and Tony drops his hands to his knees with a loud huff.
A whimper escapes the President’s chest, his feet flinging him across the marble to gather the injured man into his arms. He presses his forehead into Steve’s neck and took liberty in basking in the steady pulse thumping away under his nose.
Pepper snatches the newspaper from the table and clenches it so tightly, angry lines of tension fan out the pages like a lantern. She holds it up to Tony’s face and angrily jabs the page with her index finger.
Matilda hides her shock well, and instead settles for nodding slowly and flicking her eyes towards Steve.
Suddenly, the door swings open behind him and Rhodey’s standing there, flushed and breathing heavily. Tony opens his mouth to greet him before he’s got an armful of his best friend with Rhodey pressing his cold nose into the fragile skin at Tony’s neck.
“Mr Stark,” Rogers replies with a deep, soothing voice that melts down Tony’s spine like honey. Tony steels himself and pushes down his hot flushes aggressively. “It’s good to see you. How are you enjoying this evening?”
Pepper catches her lip in her teeth and squeezes down on the flesh. “I do, actually.” She ducks under a low-hanging branch. “I need to know that somebody else is feeling as shattered as me.”
His voice drips down Tony’s shivering muscles like honey and soothes his aching lungs for a moment. Then, Vision’s horrified features swim into his vision and he pulls back to blink rapidly at his husband, greedily drinking in the sight of Steve awake and breathing.
“In case I’ve deeply offended you- which, I’m very sorry for- I don’t think you’re a whore. There’s nothing wrong with your body count and I shouldn’t have used it against you.” Steve says, too softly for Tony’s hay-wired brain to really process. Instead, he watches Steve grapple with his jeans until he’s fully dressed. He quickly throws some red sunglasses over his eyes to hide the bitter self-loathing that tortures them.
“And then I got there and there were ambulances and cop cars everywhere… then I saw the kid and he was crying and I thought… I thought I’d lost you.”
“Good,” Nat does raise her gaze at this point to give her boss a butter-wouldn’t-melt smile that hid a snarl pissed enough to even derail a furious Pepper. Now, that, was an impressive feat. “Because I was about to rip your balls off.”
He was too old for this. He was too old for looking completely out of place; Clint did warn him that travelling to an outdoor market in a Pulp Fiction t-shirt and tartan chinos was a very bad idea. Did he listen to Clint? No, he didn’t. Dumb fucking move, Stark.
“All fine, baby. They were here earlier. You’ve had so many people send you cards, it’s like your 30th all over again.”
“I wish I could’ve had both.” Steve tells him. Tony freezes with wide eyes. “You, and Cap. But we were warned, Tony. Pepper was right to say that we couldn’t have both. We would’ve killed each other. Hell, we nearly did.”
They stare at each other for a moment and a shared thought passes between them: who’s gonna break first?
Tony suppresses the urge to turn around and tell him to go fuck himself. Instead, he pretends not to have heard the son of a bitch and lets the crowd swallow him up to deposit him back to Pepper.
“Can I help you?” He asks, a bit stunned. Steve’s actually quaking with anger and Tony wants to step back but stands his ground to stare defensively at the blonde man.
Tony smiles fondly and leans back against his chair as Matilda gets comfortable again, Steve warm and alive at his side. “We met over twelve years ago, and Steve was a cocky little shit-”
“Thought you’d say that.” Tony chuckles back and moves to the bed to place a gentle kiss at Steve’s forehead, careful to miss the bruises still littered around his temple and jaw. There were worse ones mottling his right side from his pec to his hipbone but according to Dr Beech, they were healing nicely. Thank fuck. “All done, baby. You’re officially mine again.”
“The Avengers, not just myself but my entire team, have been waiting for this moment for nearly two decades. I cannot begin to voice my appreciation and excitement at being elected President of the United States for this upcoming term.” Tony informs the room and the room nods back at him in synchronised understanding. In a heartbeat, his tone turns to one of clear severity. “It is my solemn promise to you now, that I will do everything in my power to liberate the lives of everyone oppressed in America. There will be no conflict, no poverty, no discrimination and no moral crisis- not when I am in government. Our fantastic country will know true light again, and we will shine as a beacon of hope and promise to the world.”
He wasn’t okay. How could he ever be okay again? He nearly lost Steve once- he couldn’t go through that again.
How was he supposed to answer that question? Well, I was just given the devastating news that one of my oldest friends is now dead and we’re not even thirty but yes of course I can talk to you about my latest policy whilst my ex-girlfriend breaks down over a kettle…
Never in Tony’s life had he felt so conflicted. Never, in one moment of terrifying confusion dating back to his childhood, had his head been so heavy with tension. Just like his statement had said after the attack: he was taking time to heal his family. The country didn’t understand, after all, what was an army without a leader? How could they grow without anyone at the helm? Frankly, Tony didn’t give two shits. The attack had made him realise that he was already spiralling and he desperately needed to be saved.
"Of course it's not one of my flings! How can you ask me that? Have you ever seen one of my flings last
It's nice to know that she likes him enough to let him call her that, and the knowledge that she thinks of him as someone she can call a friend (not that she couldn't before, but now she trusts him a bit better) warms someplace deep in his chest.
"I did indeed, sir, and I'm inclined to agree with Captain Rogers on this one. You're simply too much work. My servers cannot cope with all the stress," JARVIS said drily.
He feels a blush working its way across his face and although he wants to laugh and shrug it off, he knows it's true. It makes him uncomfortable that people who would have never ever looked at him that way before will suddenly stop in the middle of the sidewalk to look at him now. And although he was in a relationship with Tony -  who was completely and utterly shameless - he still found that he didn't believe that people could honestly like someone like him, and the thought made him uneasy and uncomfortable.
Feeling guilty yet again - Steve can't remember feeling anything else during these past few days beyond exhaustion, guilt, and embarrassment and he's starting to get fed up with himself - he tosses his duvet aside and slips out of bed.
"You know, Steve, you don't have to go out on this mission. I mean, sure, Tony asked you, but I'm pretty sure you're not needed. I know for a fact that Bucky would be happy to go with us on the mission."
See, it was like this: Tony had come down from the penthouse dressed to the nines in a Tom Ford suit, shades in place over his eyes and greeted them goodbye with a jaunty wave and a wink before he left in his Audi for some charity gala.
"As you say, sir. I shall wait patiently until then. However, I do have a rather pressing question that regards you selling me to 'a community college', as you so eloquently put it; who will help you remember whenever you have a meeting with Ms. Potts? Or help you upgrade DUM-E or U or Butterfingers? I won't be able to help you from my post at a community college, sir, and as you very well know, I can't keep you out of trouble if I'm not by your side. As that seems to be the case every second day of the week, my job as your protector is thus 'a moot point', as you so often like to say," JARVIS said, sounding oddly smug and sarcastic at the same time.
Tony smiles, and it's not his real smile this time, it's his fake smile. The sarcastic, plastic smile that he reserved for the press.
And this was only for while he was staying on the medical floor. When Steve finally left - and their baby was with them - there would be late-night diaper changes and feeding times as well.
STARK:  Boy, I’m good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let’s see what’s really going on.
Tony was feeling light headed now, and he felt like sitting up was taking to much effort. He leaned, landing with a soft thump on his side on the floor.
"Tony," Steve said, hands shaking and the stone dropped on the ground at his feet. "Tony, hold on. You're going to be okay. Just, hold on!"
Peter brought his Cap Plush, though it stayed in the car when Tony pulled up to the concert hall. He tossed the key to the valley, instead helping Peter out. In seconds, reporters who had been swarming Obie were suddenly around him. People called out to him, and Tony was pleased with the ever present hold Peter had on the leg of his slacks.
Wade felt his chest tighten at the thought of seeing Peter. If he did… Well, he’d probably break down into tears. There would be gross sobbing, and that’s the last thing he needed. Fucked over by cancer and gross sobbing.
"Holy shit," Clint said, rushing forward to try and steady Steve. "Holy shit, Cap! You just- And Thanos-"
they could knock the barrier down. It was just to strong on the outside, it seemed. Except for… Hm, that spot seemed much softer. Much weaker… It could totally work.
"I can't ask you to do that," Tony said. "With everything that's happened, I don't think the world can afford to lose you. Not for good." When Steve's face fell, Tony chuckled, reaching out to snatch his ring back. "But I know you're gonna try. So you better get all you stuff out of the Tower and into the mansion. Tired of the bed being so empty."
"I don't think this is what's most important right now," Carol said. "We need to find Thanos and get that gauntlet."
As the days went on, time seemed to fly by. Peter kept doing in Spiderman thing at night, sometimes joining his family in Avengers stuff when his dad said it was okay. Ned kept being his guy in the chair, when he was in town, and before they knew it, it was the end of freshman year and they were watching Wade graduate.
"You should be resting," Steve was saying. "You just got back, and the twins need someone they know to be here with them."
Peter grew tense, unsure of what to say, and decided that maybe he should just… run. So he climbed out the window, and crawled around to where Pepper couldn’t see him before going up to the roof. He could still hear her, calling out to him, but he ignored her and got redressed. Once he was sure that he was good, he headed back down, finding Pepper in the hall.
“And what’s with the whole story that it’s a bodyguard? He’s my… I mean, is that… That’s kinda flimsy, don’t you think?”
But as he pulled back out of Thanos' reach, Steve saw his chance. The sixth stone was within reach. If he could just grab it, he could keep Thanos' attention. He could keep the Titan focused on him, give the others the opening they would need, and be the only one at risk.
“For staying behind to keep helping? Or for building that unit for Bucky. Could be for those chips you built even though you didn't know you'd need to.” He shrugged. “Just… staying around to help me.”
“Really?” Ned asked, frowning as he pulled out his tablet. “Well, there wasn’t about your patrol pal directly… There was something about a guy who shot up the freeway this morning. Captain America and Iron Man went to get him, though neither have given police statements yet and SHIELD is taking over the case, but the guy got away by…” Ned cringed. “Oh geez, by cutting off his own arm…”
Wade wasn’t sure how long he was in Francis’s workshop, be he really didn’t care. Once he had escaped, and gotten a new pair of clothes after the fire, all he cared about was finding Peter. Weasel would have taken him the box by now, and Peter would have seen the letter. He had to show Peter that he was still okay. That he was alive.
He continued to stare as Peter shot another web and was off once again. He felt great, knowing he had just helped someone. He had understood why his Dad and the other Avengers did what the do, but now he understood a bit more.
"I can't," the AI confirmed. "My range is far, but not as far as you might think. A copy of me will be within both the Iron Man armor and the Iron Spider suit, so once they're in range, I'll be sure to tell you."
For a moment, there was silence on the other end of the line. He wondered if maybe he could snatch the words back, make it so he never said them, but it was to late. The words were out there, and he couldn't take them back. Not anymore.
“-I can’t believe that he would do that! Maybe he already knew you were missing? But then why didn’t he ask me for help? It’s totally uncool, and-”
Peter went wide eyed, holding the plush close to his body. “Really? Cap’n ‘merica is my favorite superhero!”
It was a bit disheartening to see so few of their allies and friends still in the house, but Tony was focussed on other things. Seeing Steve, and the twins, he took a few shaky steps forward, before wrapping his arms around his husband and children.
"Tony, don't move," Bruce said, voice muffled, even though Tony could see the blurred outline of his face.
Good God! This chapter took forever! I'm not even sure how I managed to get it done! I was almost tempted to cleave it in half, but... no. No, I had to make if FORTY-FIVE freaking pages and over 20,000 words! Good luck...
Was that Bruce? He sounded… far away. Or really close? Tony wasn't entirely sure. Still, he tried to lift his head, a sharp tug in his stomach making him gasp. He tried to take deep breaths, only to cough, a wet metallic taste in his mouth. Was he bleeding?
"Then we'll have to move him," someone else said behind him. Was that Coulson? "Stark, this is going to hurt."
, and he may have been a playboy in the past, but he isn’t anymore. He never ‘coerced’ Steve into anything. And if you’re here just to spread false rumors, then you can get out!”
“Well,” Wade drawled as he dropped onto the couch next to Al. “The cock-sucker that turned me into this butter faced creep, who I spent the last two years waiting to murder, slipped through my hands today.” He paused, then scowled at his slowly growing stump. “
“Not quite,” Tony said, though a bit more friendly and relaxed then Steve would have liked. “But that doesn’t mean you’re not still grounded for the mess you made.”
“What better way to crawl back inside that head of yours,” the guy that took him said, and holy shit, that meant this guy was Francis!
Pushing the door open, Peter held it for everyone to get inside. With the right access, DNA and voice recognition, the door opened to an elevator that goes right up to the penthouse. Peter used it when he was to lazy to wall crawl into his window, or when he got back during the tourist rush in the lobby and wanted to avoid people. Now, his friends piled inside, looking around in confusion as Peter stepped in.
as a date. That wasn't… It wasn't very romantic. Sure, Steve knew that they weren't going to have one of those heartfelt, lovey-dovey sort of dinners as a date. But lunch? On his birthday? His
He was cut off when a weight slammed into his side. He went tumbling, falling down and down, until he was slamming into the ground. Good thing was, so did Francis, just a second after Wade. With a snarl, Wade lunged, pinning Francis down. They fought, Francis trying to push him off while Wade tried to kill him, breaking arms and throwing punches.
When Peter turned back around, Harry was the first one to get it. He went wide eyed, and then tight lipped, as he looked Peter over. Ned and Gwen were still staring at the room, and Wade was neutral, already dropping onto the couch.
“What do we do, Captain?” Rhodes asked, turned to Steve with his helmet down, letting Steve see the warriness in his eye.
A little drunk, and with nothing else to do, Wade wandered over to the guy in the booth. He was a real Grim Reaper looking guy. All he was missing was a scythe. Wade figured if this kind of guy was coming to him, it would either cure him or kill him faster. And, well, he didn’t have much to lose, now.
His dad showed them a few of the things that were special about the room, like the projected moving targets, the drone or LMD targets, and Jarvis. Then he showed some of Iron Man, Falcon's wings, and Black Widow stingers. Steve actually came down to practice while they were all marveling at the tech, and showed them his simple shield, even stopping to shake hands with them and letting them try throwing it. Most of his classmates fumbled it, and a few actually got it to ricochet though Steve still had to catch it. When Peter got to throw it, he purposely fumbled it, so he wouldn't raise suspension.
“Why send this to me?” he asked, frowning as he looked it over. It was less a letter and more a packet in a large envelope. “Have you see it?”
“No,” Tony said, Peter still clinging to him, though he seemed interested in the soft glow of the arc reactor under his shirt.
"Bruce says its backlash from the Stones power," Steve explained as he rewrapped his arm. "The bones in my arm were broken in several places, too. He said that much power, even with the gauntlet to channel it, left a mark. The serum, somehow, saved me. If I were normal, like Clint or Natasha, I'd probably be dead."
He finds Tony sitting at the main console in the cockpit, and smiled when he moved to lean on the edge of the keyboard. They were heading to their China tower to meet a doctor friend of Tony and Bruce who could help Clint. Tony was messaging her now to make sure everything was there when they arrived.
Friday ended up being canceled. Steve, as much as he had tried to make sure they had time to, failed to take into account that the Avengers were a legit team that could get called out any moment. Or that Hydra was still at large. And so was most of AIM. And then the run of the mill baddy.
grieving, Steve," Tony sighed. "We all lost people in the snap. Friends, family. But Wade lost…" He trailed off, took a deep breath before continuing. "Wade lost Peter. The one person that he would do
“Got the cure for cancer.” He shrugged. “Sorta. The doc at the lab said that the serum they put in me kinda just… made my cells regenerate super fast. Including my cancer ones. Not entirely sure. Kinda why I came here.”
Tony could only smile. “Yeah, really. Steve, we’re heroes. More importantly, we’re a team. Not just part of the Avengers team, but you and I.
The author smiled, a wide beam on her lips. It made Wade hesitate, but she might be his only chance. Whatever she needed done, whatever he had to do to see Peter back, Wade would do it.
Peter rolled his eyes, though a blush was starting to dust his cheeks. With a huff, he dropped his board and pushed off, rolling around the skate park for a while. It wasn’t that he didn’t want a little brother or sister, or that he didn’t think his fathers could do it. He just didn’t think right now was the right time for them. But thoughts kept rolling around in his head, snowballing now that he was really thinking about it. If his dad and pops did adopt, would they adopt a baby or a kid? Where would the kid sleep? The tower was big, but the penthouse was really only meant to have two bedrooms, with the third room being a sort of hobby room with the floor to ceiling windows.
They were spit up into three different groups, with one three person group and one four person group merging together to do a rotation around the different facilities. Peter didn't know any of the people in the three person group that joined them, though he was more interested in what they saw.
"My arm will heal," Steve finally said, snapping Tony from his thoughts. "And Stephen Strange said he knows a surgeon who can advance the healing process if need be."
“You’re going to do it. Go to the central console and open up all the circuits. When I get clear of the roof, I’ll let you know. You’re going to hit the master bypass button. It’s going to fry everything up here.”
His mouth feeling dry, Peter reached for the bowl, only for a sound like rushing water to fill his ears, his eyes narrowing down to near pinpoints of darkness. Opening his mouth in a cry that even his own ears couldn’t hear, he fell off the couch, landing so hard the air was knocked from his lungs and he was knocked into blissful unconsciousness.
“No, really, I should go first,” Tony tries, reaching into his pocket to get the ring. “You’ll want to hear this first and-”
Steve smiled, almost sheepishly, but fond. "But I don't think I'll be picking up the shield again anytime soon. I've been fighting almost none stop since the 1940's, and it's about time I took a rest."
. How are we supposed to be that team, and get married, if you won't even tell me something so important!”
Instantly, Steve lunged, practically laying on top of Barnes as the Soldier screamed and jerked. His hands were pressing hard on Barnes shoulders, shins twisted around to keep the man's legs from kicking up while Tony worked frantically. This thing was supposed to be connected to Barnes body, his mind, and even be removed regularly. Why the
He settles in the bed, allowing Tony to help him get comfortable. No matter what position he's in, it's difficult for him to settle in properly and when he shifts, he can't help wincing when he moves too fast, feeling the tenderness in his lower half that hasn't disappeared yet.
Which made his job - and no, he really didn't mean it to come out sounding like it was some sort of chore to be Tony's boyfriend, but being Tony's boyfriend was a full time job - so much more difficult, especially since Tony still held his old insecurities concerning his past lovers close to heart.
He'd been walking briskly allong the sidewalk, keeping his head bent and eyes focused on the phone in his hands when he bumped into Steve.
So seeing Steve all broken up and a sobbing mess was something that made some part of him want to grab Steve into his arms and shield him from whatever was hurting him. He wanted to protect Steve.
Tony's asleep in his arms and he has no doubt about it that if Tony were awake, he'd be pretty mortified to hear that Steve had carried him in a bridal carry.
"Okay, okay, okay! You can stop now, it was just a joke. Relax. I've got a team that deals with things like this, should someone decide they wanted to kidnap me. It's a process. Going back to dinner, well, it depends on whether or not you say yes. So what do you say? Friday night? Six pm?" he asks.
It's because he's watching Steve that he sees the way Steve closes his eyes tightly and the way that Steve's entire face twists into a look of sadness.
“Tesoro” is a very popular term of endearment for a loved one, particularly someone with whom you’re in a romantic relationship. It means “treasure,” and is one of the few that remains masculine no matter who is being addressed. It also literally means treasure (as in the thing pirates have), wealth, fortune, or riches. The word “tesoro” can also be used to describe an artistic masterpiece.
He doesn't wait for Stone to finish and punches him right in the face, wiping the grin off his face.
He spins around in his rolling chair, twirling his tie from last night's suit around in his fingers.
The brown strands that he knew to be soft and silky were all tousled and out of place compared to how it had been styled when Tony had just left the tower for the gala.
Which is why, when Steve faints at work and Tony finds out by mistake three days later (Natasha had let it slip that Steve fainted. Although, if Tony were being honest, he's pretty sure that Natasha knew
Tony flashes Steve one of his best smiles, hoping to reassure the blond and help him relax, and it works. Steve loosens up and sinks back into the pillows that Tony had insisted on fluffing up for him, and struggles to hold back a yawn.
He doesn't say anything when he notices Steve's blue eyes watering, instead he carries on talking and gently rubs his hand in small circles over the spot beneath Steve's belly button where their child lay.
Steve feels a flash of something akin to irritation flare up at Tony's words, but he tamps down on the urge to give a scathing remark and chooses instead to watch as Tony surveys the work he's done in the nursery this morning with a critical eye.
Not that it stayed that way for long. Tony was the first to pull away, slightly out of breath and looking even more dishevelled.
"I'm going to ask you what that last bit means because even though I caught some of it, I don't understand everything you just said." Tony looked at their waiter for an explanation.
They eat breakfast together and it doesn't take too long for Steve to finally cave and takes Tony's advice to go back to bed.
"Uh, sorry, sir. The cheque, Mr. Stark, " the waiter said, handing Tony the cheque and his card without looking him in the eye and walking away briskly.
He's so busy staring at Steve that he almost misses Steve accepting. From the smirk on Steve's face, he noticed it as well but wasn't going to say anything.
Steve must’ve sensed that he's really sorry because he inches forward slowly, taking Tony's hand in his own.
"I hate you so much right now, JARVIS. When you realise that you've made a mistake and unlock the doors the two of us are going to be having a long discussion about disobedience and what it means to mind your own business," he mutters.
Tony nodded, then selected the show before snuggling up to Steve once again. They relaxed into the sofa, settling in to watch.
And he loved them. He supposes that he loves them because it's Steve, and he loves everything about Steve, so that's not really something to point out.
"Yeah. Yes, I trust you. Always, Stevie. I'm scared. My head hurts and I don't feel too good. I wanna go sleep," Tony said, slurring slightly. He gripped his head and swayed a bit, about to fall until Steve grabbed him.
Tony's better than that, now. He's cut ties with everyone not interesting enough, not challenging enough to deserve to be in the same room as him.
What about James? Maybe Tony could help James turn into a human again. Maybe James had more information about the Witch. There was a chance he could help them. He was awake, in fact, big grey eyes watching them. Steve put his hand on Tony’s shoulder. It was too hot to the touch, Tony most likely had a fever. But it wasn’t too late yet. They had time. They still had time.
“This isn’t one of the spells I left for you. I don’t know where this came from. Where did you say you found it again?”
Tony winces. The anger in Steve’s voice is close to boiling over, and soon he’ll be spitting vitriol in Tony’s face, because Steve’s blood runs hot and he needs to shout his frustrations out. It doesn’t help that he’s got a point. Tony can’t do anything, they’re both sitting ducks until Steve sorts his feelings and inner cravings out.
Tony hopes that Steve will take the leap somewhere private. He’s 70% sure that this is how it will go, because he’s heard enough about Steve’s love-life to know that he isn’t really the kind of guy who advertises it for the whole world to see. Then again, Tony has come on very strong to Steve. Maybe he’s even being a bad influence.
. In, out, in, out. He’s got one functional arm, no armour, and Steve is only pressing harder, bruising his wrist, growling under his breath. This isn’t going to work. Tony can’t focus on anything but the weight of Steve on him, the warmth seeping through his knee to Tony’s back, the puffs of breath against his hair, and it’s almost intimate, two bodies pressed against each other and the floor, and this wasn’t how Tony wanted this to go, but he’s helpless against Steve.
Steve realised this was what a flirting Stark looked like. Inexplicably, it annoyed him. Why did he have to court every pretty face he came across? Why couldn’t he just appreciate people for their intellect of personality, instead of their looks? Was it too much to ask, huh?
Steve lunged, a desperate attempt at barging through them, and he collided with one of the soldiers, tumbling to the ground with him. They rolled in the dirt, fighting for the upper hand, which Steve gained when he punched the soldier in the face, who went limp under him. He silently thanked the higher powers that the bayonet hadn’t gone straight through him during the fall but froze when he heard the tell-tale click of a musket that was loaded and ready to fire.
He lifted his shield and slammed it into her, the wall creaking with the force of his blow. His shield could damage her, he knew. He lifted it over his head, driving the edge into her chest, again and again, and the wall crumbled behind her. They tumbled into the hole, finding themselves in the hills, rolling away from the damaged castle. Steve pushed himself up and straddled Jocasta. She was weaker now, further away from the Waste and further away from her home. He knew his only chance was to overpower her physically, to not give her the time to cast magic.
He just needed to pick flowers and put them in several vases around the shop. He would take the best flowers he could find, and arrange them into bouquets, and see if anyone was interested in buying them. But where was he going to pick the flowers? He could walk around in Brooklyne, or go through the black door—but maybe he needed Tony for that, could he really walk through the darkness alone?—or pick some flowers from the flower field.
The armour wasn’t the only point of interest, either. Tony took care to observe the various rooms and hallways they crossed on their way to the laboratory. What he saw was unsettling: when the interior wasn’t creepily reminiscent of his own mansion (minus the interesting artifacts and taxidermy mounts), it was filled with unknown appliances, most of them electric. Tony didn’t like it one bit. Where had he gotten transported, that they were so much more technologically advanced than him? He thought he was at the forefront of scientific progress, but that illusion was now thoroughly crushed.
He coughed lightly and changed the subject very transparently: “But, anyways, as I was saying, uhh…”
. You told us you were done with risking your life for magical trinkets, and where are we now, huh? You stupid bastard.”
“Oh, that? Don’t worry about it, I’m experimenting with symbolism and magical markings on the body, I must have forgotten to clean it. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to put on some clothes.”
Steve will think the same. Steve will see him, and his gaze will be cold as ice, his irises frozen blue. Or, worse, his gaze will slide past Tony, and Tony will know that everything they once were is gone.
The hills around him morphed, took on a distinctly orange hue, which morphed into green and ultimately blue. Steve wasn’t in the hills anymore. The castle wasn’t behind him, Jarvis was gone, and he was walking in shallow water, looking up at the starry sky, wind blowing in his hair.
He grabbed Steve by the arm, his fingers digging into Steve’s skin, clammy to the touch. What had upset him so much? Miss O’Casta was as surprised as Steve, calling out a bewildered goodbye as Stark dragged Steve out of the house.
“What I’m seeing is that Iron Man is roughing up his employer, for no good reason. What is happening here? Are you, are you trying to… blackmail him into giving you a better pay?”
Steve doesn’t want to talk about it, just wants to know if they’ve destroyed planets already, how many, who broke first, did you break, Tony, why did you do this why did you use me why why why why
Steve looked down at himself and laughed when he saw that he had his old body back. The Witch’s curse was gone, just as Jarvis had told Steve.
Cap glanced uncertainly at both of them. He stepped closer to Tony, eyes searching for something in his face. Tony stayed stock-still and tried not to notice how handsome Cap was. Cap didn’t seem to find the answer he was looking for, because he just frowned even more, and, oh, was that a
Steve woke up with a crick in his neck. He really shouldn’t have fallen asleep in his chair like that. Well, hopefully it would be over before he had to greet the day’s first customers and—
He couldn’t let it happen. He couldn’t allow it. He needed to protect Tony’s heart, needed to save it.
Steve’s heart unclenched, his relief that Natasha wasn’t falling for Stark all-encompassing. He was disappointed that he wouldn’t be able to meet her, but it was good enough knowing that what he’d been afraid of wasn’t going to happen. But he didn’t like the manipulative streak of Lord Fury and liked even less that he was roping Natasha into his machinations. There wasn’t much he could do about it, though.
She shrieked, an ear-piercing scream, and flared up. Her yellow magic exploded around her, forming a supernova of energy, but Steve held his ground, and Tony stayed strong, his body rising into the air, still pouring a deluge of blue light towards her.
He walked towards it, hoping to find someone or at least a place to rest. He’d pay them if he had to, he just couldn’t go on until dawn.
“So you want me to say that you only think of yourself, that you aren’t good at helping people or rescuing them?”
The only reason Tony can come up with is that Steve’s unconscious wasn’t happy with only killing Tony once, and that it will stop when Steve’s rage has been assuaged. He doesn’t voice that thought.
Unexpectedly, Tony didn’t seem to mind the news about the King making him court sorcerer that much. He frowned when Steve told him but looked oddly pleased that the King had caught out Steve’s lies and turned them into the compliments they really were.
He started coughing, then, and didn’t fight as he turned back, his eyes never leaving Steve’s as he shifted into a huge brown dog. He looked more like a bear than a dog, this time, Steve mused. Was there any logic to his changing appearance? Was it a random pattern?
“Yeah, I…He should be able to send one. I’ll need to carry you, we don’t have enough energy for two suits. Our magic is at pretty much zero now.”
The question was so unexpected that it knocked Steve out of his daze. He took a step back, dislodging his wrist from the stranger’s grip, and spluttered. He didn’t know what was going on, he’d been fighting for his life not two minutes ago, and now this man wanted to drink a cup of tea with him?
Should Steve leave? Should he go back to his room and draw until he was needed again? There wasn’t much he could do here. Maybe he could speak to James, learn a little more about how he met Natasha.
He put Steve’s hand on his heart, and Steve could feel the healthy beat under his palm. Steve curled his hand into a fist and put his other hand on Tony’s cheek.
The Witch of the Waste, the curse, it all came back to him. As did the fact that he was in Stark’s castle. What the hell had he been thinking yesterday? He had to get out of there before Stark came back. If he wasn’t home already. That man was dangerous, and he should try to leave before it was too late—but the fire demon had made a pact with him. And it had promised that Steve wouldn’t get harmed.
“Th—thank you, Stark. I know you know who cursed me, but I don’t work for her. Please believe me, I wasn’t with her of my own volition.”
“Would you believe me if I said I saw you during a vital moment in my life? And that I knew that you were out there, somewhere, and that I just needed to see you?”
“I trust you, Shellhead, but he really does look like Mr. Stark, even if he doesn’t have the same clothes—”
For a terrifying moment, there was nothing but Stark, Steve, and their hands linked together. They were flying, or falling, or sinking, or floating, stuck in time and place.
She gasps. Tries to push Tony out of the way. He won’t move. He sends a SHIELD-wide directive to apprehend the assassin at all costs. Everything happened so fast, the numerous agents on site haven’t had the time to react. A quick scan shows Tony that multiple supers are on site. They’ll deal with it. Tony will take care of Steve.
Tony’s relieved laugh was the best thing Steve had heard in his life. The only way this could be better was if they kissed right here, right now.
Step by step, he walked towards the shop. Step by step, he dragged Tony with him, until he got used to the weight, until his muscles weren’t screaming with exertion, until he got his breathing under control again. He didn’t know where the additional energy had come from, but suddenly he knew that he was strong enough to properly carry Tony. He hoisted him up in his arms, one arm under Tony’s shoulders and the other under his knees. He put the shield on top of Tony’s chest, underneath one of his limp arms.
“Don’t give me this nonsense. I want to know if he has a mountain of gold hidden somewhere, or does he get the money by less legal means? Oh God, does he steal it? Does he perform… does he do
He tried to grab the paper, eyes fixed on it, and Steve understood that there was something about the spell that was more important than it seemed. Stark
No, he was Iron Byronsides. But he liked the ring of “Iron Man” for the armour. It was better than calling it a tin can, at least. And transistors? He’d never heard of that. He wondered why they were so much more technologically advanced. What did they have that he was lacking?
Tony’s nursing his bottle. It’s the last expensive one he bought, an old scotch. It burns his throat, and empties his mind, and he loves the taste of it.
“Rogers, Jarvis, sorry again. I had something to tell you both after taking my bath, and I will say it now. I received a letter from Rh—the King. He’s been requesting I come to an audience with him. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but he wants me to become court sorcerer.”
He would have to make sure that Natasha knew about this mystery wizard, so that she could keep herself safe.
Steve would give him the benefit of the doubt for now, but as soon as he was awake once more, Steve would ask him about everything. How had he found himself stuck in the bushes the day after visiting Steve? Why was he at Shield? Why had he come all the way to the castle? Why was he cursed? How could Steve help him remove the curse? What did he know about the Witch of the Waste? Why had he been with her in the first place? Was he still working with or for her?
There is the workshop, but anywhere past ten metres from it, everything goes dead. He can’t connect to the Internet, nothing but his local sensors and workshop machine. His phone doesn’t have any signal and doesn’t show a time either. By all accounts, his world is a sphere with a twenty-metre radius. Tony doesn’t need to be a genius to know that that shouldn’t be possible, but he’s learned that impossible is not a word you should use when faced with an infinity gem. If Tony had to guess, he’d say that the time gem has put Steve and Tony in a pocket of time parallel to the main timeline, and since time and space go hand in hand, the pocket of time somehow translated into a pocket of space as well. They’re stuck somewhere, between time and space, and Tony doesn’t know what will happen if they don’t break this time loop. Can it go on forever? Will the gem lose infinity energy or whatever powers it?
“Hey, I’m sure you know him better than you think. You and Iron Man are good friends, are you not? Nothing has changed, now you just know who the pretty eyes behind the faceplate belong to.”
There is nothing Tony can do but wait and see. He’s ready. He’s prepared for everything. In the case that he survives, he’s put a comfortable sum of money aside, whipped up a few false identities, stuffed a duffel bag full of clothes and blood and sunscreen.
. He stepped inside the property. A man was waiting for him by the front door, gesturing him inside to a tasteful waiting room. Steve didn’t have to wait long before he was called to the witch’s study.
“She took control over James to tell me this. It’s so—it’s so cruel, she didn’t need to hurt him like that, but she did, just to mock me—this always happens to the people around me—getting hurt for no—I need to meet someone. I can still stop this. Got to make it right.”
But what could Steve say? That he’d started throwing a fit because he’d realised that Potts and Stark were the same person? That he was furious at himself for ignoring Stark’s darker side just because he was marginally friendly? That Jarvis had good reason to stop Steve?
Maybe that was why he let Steve live with him, to have someone else in his house. Steve could understand that feeling. And he wouldn’t judge Stark on what he chose to do with his last months. If he wanted to chase after pretty people, let him do it. It wouldn’t hurt Steve anyways.
“I’m sorry, I don’t know what came over him. He saw Stark and immediately jumped at him, I tried to chase him away, I didn’t know you were walking here, my lord, Mr. Rogers.”
On his way back, Steve asked himself if this man could have been Stark. He’d been a magician, after all, and he’d flirted with Steve.
Stark said it with a wink and a self-depreciating smile, and Steve wondered if Stark really thought he had him fooled. He might have, if he hadn’t seen the mess on his chest, but now Steve knew better. Stark may be fickle, but he wasn’t as vain as he tried to imply.
“I can change where the door leads to. We’ll keep the hills, since that is the castle’s physical location, but I’ll change where the red and blue doors lead to. I might change the black one, but I think I’ll keep it.”
Steve eyes him, decides if he wants to deign Tony with and answer, and some part of him screams in anger at the lack of trust while the rest of him breaks a little more.
“We could assume that my death triggered the time loop, since it resets every time one of us dies. We could try to see if it resets after a certain amount of time, since the earlier iterations didn’t really last that long. Also, since the time gem seems to be connected to you, I think it might be worth a try to see if you can summon it at will.”
The flames burned brighter, grew until they filled the fireplace, as if to show that Jarvis was more than capable of taking Steve on, but they came back to their original size quickly, the fire demon growling that it should never have let Steve come in. It bent his head, still muttering under its breath, and Steve smiled and thanked him pleasantly.
Tony wonders if Steve resents Tony for this too. There’s a good argument to be made that this is Tony’s fault. He saw the war come and didn’t stop it. He escalated, made things worse, drove heroes apart. He made Steve defenceless. And now he was too slow to save Steve.
the log, pulling the rest of the fire with it, until the fire had settled on top of the log. This was, as Natasha would say it,
“You’re mistaking him for Loki Laufeyson, Margaret. My grandson saw the wizard whisk away his friend, and he had shining blue hair and golden-brown eyes.”
Tony swallows, tries to remember if Steve has ever offered to draw Tony in the nude before. It’s too blurry.
Tony sees exactly how badly he’s miscalculated when Steve strips right in front of him to change into workout gear. One instant, Tony’s looking at a handsome body hidden under clothes, and the next, there’s the object of his fantasies in touching distance. Tony can’t keep his eyes away from the chiselled muscles bunching and stretching as Steve removes his T-shirt and jeans. Tony can see a vein pulsing along Steve’s upper thigh. He wants to sink his teeth into it. He’d do it, right here, right now. He’d slide to his knees and wrap his hands around Steve and taste what he wants. The smell alone is almost too much.
He doesn’t deserve this Steve. He deserves the one that hurts him, that punches him in the face, that chokes him and looks at him with cold, dead eyes. This parody of kindness is worse. It’s everything Tony will never have, everything he’s yearned for and annihilated before it could happen.
to be cleaned. Well, Stark could say anything he wanted, but there was no way that Steve was using that pigsty of a bathroom before cleaning it. So he had waited until Stark had left for another one of his “meetings” before hurrying up to the bathroom. Jarvis had tried dissuading him, but when Steve set his mind on something, he followed through.
Tony’s hands were trembling where they clutched his tunic, his eyes wet. Steve didn’t know what to do. He was to blame for this, he knew. He hadn’t been careful enough, he’d picked the flowers without looking for a mandrake. He’d promised himself not to do the exact same thing he’d just done, and with devastating consequences. What could he say? Nothing he would say would make it better. Oh God, what had he done?
With an arch of her fingers, the door opened, and Steve was compelled to stand up and bid his goodbye. He barely had the time to yell out a thank you before he was ushered out of the mansion. They left him on the sidewalk, his head full of thoughts, his mind trying to make sense of what she had told him.
He collapses on top of Steve, shielding him from any attack. The armour’s around him, safe and strong. He made it.
He thought about how beautiful the stars were and that he would like nothing more than to see a star up close.
“We’re fine, Cap, good enough to do this. Jarvis is right, we need to do it now. We’ll rest more later. Besides, you taking care of me has done wonders for helping me recover already,” Tony answered with a wink. Well. If he said so. Tony surely seemed in better spirits, the news about his marks notwithstanding.
Trying to fight against Captain America in his full righteous fury is futile. Whatever you do, he’ll find a way to win. Because he’s right. Because he stands for what is true, for what is good. He’ll even die if he has to. But you’ll always lose in the end. He knows it, you know it, but you’ll still try because you have no other choice, because you have to, because this is for the greater good, and he’ll shout at you that you’ve got everything wrong, that you used him, that you betrayed him, and that
Tony crouched down, carefully holding his hand out for the weredog to sniff. Which happened without problem. Was the man’s animosity for Tony gone? When had that happened?
“Tony, you’re…less than alright. I need to speak to you about Ultrocifern. She’s not with the Witch, I haven’t been able to find her.”
He doesn't know if he is stronger than Steve, though. He gets so overwhelmed by the scent of Steve’s blood that he can’t decide on what Steve is to him. He wants to say that Steve is just a meal waiting to happen, but the truth is, he doesn’t know. When Tony inevitably gives in and goes for Steve’s throat, it could go either way. Maybe Tony will pin Steve against the wall and suck him dry. Maybe he’ll take control, keep the straining mass of Steve in place while he takes what he wants. But just as easily, they could be evenly matched, fighting and fighting until they both succumb to exhaustion. Steve could be stronger than Tony, too. Maybe he'll push Tony back and take his shield and slice off his head. Who knows.
. He doesn’t understand why he resisted doing this. This is what he was made for. He runs toward Steve, intent on tackling him, but Steve goes with the momentum, gets an arm under Tony’s shoulder and flips him over his own. Tony lands hard on the mat, twists too fast and sweeps Steve’s legs from under him. Steve doesn’t quite manage to land in a handstand (the show-off) and collapses on himself. Tony wastes no time in crawling over him, going for a stranglehold or wrist lock. Steve halts Tony’s advance by locking his legs around Tony’s waist and grabbing Tony’s wrists in his hands. Tony elbows Steve in the solar plexus, wrenching his wrists free as Steve struggles to breathe. Tony lets himself drop against Steve, pinning his hands above his head.
Maybe he could make a cup of coffee for Tony and bring it to him, have an excuse to make sure that he was alright?
He didn’t feel the usual tiredness in his arms, didn’t feel the soreness of sitting on the wooden stool, his feet flat on the floor, his grip on the pencils and brushes strong and sure, his eyes sharp, his breathing regular and deep enough to keep from trembling. Each time he finished a painting, he put it up on his walls, wherever there was space, be it near the ceiling or just above the floor.
“Is this what you call accountability?” She handed him a stack of photos, which he struggled to look at one haned. “It’s a town called Gulmira. Heard of-?”
Slowly, he looked over his shoulder at her. Then, because he was tired and hurt, he spoke without thinking.
I got a comment asking about Peter's legs, btw. Tony scrapped the Iron Lad idea and made just the spider legs. They're like the legs of the Iron Spider, but in a little backpack rather then a suit.
So, can anyone pick out the foreshadowing for the next chapter? There are also some references to other fandoms, like quote or mentions, that are in this chapter for other things I watch/read, if you can find those. Or are there any questions about things that don't quite make sense? Put them in the comments, and I will do my best to reply quickly!
Tony blinked. "Friday, you do know what that will do to you, right? You'll get merged with the circuitry. You might not be able to come back out."
“Doubtful,” came Bucky’s reply. On the communications front, Bucky actually hadn’t come very far. He often replied in one word responses, or even just meaningful looks, and usually had to be prompted for more detailed replies. Which were still short anyway.
He tried to sit up, only to his at the sharp tug at his side. Tony had to lower himself back down, tugging off the sheets to look at his chest. He wasn't wearing a shirt, and instead found pristine white bandages wrapped around his midriff. Slowly, he brushed his fingers over it, brow furrowed, trying to find the end of the white strips.
“I’m closing in,” Tony said, narrowing his eyes at the spot on the barrier he was about to ram. God he hoped this worked!
He turned, ready to leave. If he was smart, he’d tell Tony about this guy, and get him taken down. But he’d probably forget about it later. The guy was creepy, sure, but not that memorable. He’d just poof out of Wade’s mind in a few hours.
The next problem was getting the ship up in the air. He scowled at the controls, taking everything in, and wondered what he should do.
Just as they reached the end of the stairs, Wade felt his legs sway under him. His vision blurred and he had to hold onto the railing at the bottom to try and steady himself. Something was wrong. Something was… seriously wrong…
“Delay the order to Pep!” Tony said, rather manly, and not at all in a panicked squeak. “I'll… I'll deal with it!”
“You activated a blackout protocol after Happy Hogan left. I couldn't do anything to stop you, as you used an override.” There was a small pause. “I hadn't noticed a rash, as I was in a blackout protocol.”
With all to much ease, Wade had appeared in the mansion basement, standing in front of Thanos' cell. Without a word, Wade had beamed under his mask, reached out, and pressed the release button for the cell door. Then, he'd waited for the titan to step out, and had just… handed over the Reality Stone. And with that, Thanos was gone once more, just seconds before they had arrived.
“True,” the man said with a smirk, his eyes moving to look over Peter’s shoulder. “But you have him to thank for this.”
So after they’d had their little shout fest, and setting up to go looking for Ultron, Steve didn’t get a chance to talk to Tony in private. He wanted to, needed to, but they hadn’t had the chance yet. Everything was moving to fast, and Steve knew that Tony had just barely managed to take a break to call Peter, much less sleep or talk to him.
With tears welling in his eyes under the mask, Wade found his feet already moving. He ran, faster then he had in a long time, through the dimly lit night streets, towards the beacon of light that was Avengers Tower. He threw open the doors to the lobby, scarring the desks night secretary, and was running to the elevator to the private floors.
Instinctively, Peter turned toward the noise, and lept into action. Quite literally, as he leapt off the wall of a building, and tackle the man with the gun. He knocked him down, and webbed the man up as if he had done it thousands of times before, and pinned him to the wall.
“I put up with the Avengers ‘cuz they’re like family,” Wade said, standing up with a scowl. “The hero thing just isn’t my game. But if I ever reach ‘fuck it’, I’ll give you a call.”
Stepping up to the bar, Peter took a deep breath, bent down, and wrapped his fingers around the bar. He closed his eyes, licked his lips, and lifted with all the strength he had. Only for his arms to end up going straight up into the air, feeling like he was lifting nothing at all. Peter blinked his eyes open, expecting that maybe the weights had fallen off the bar, but found them being held easily above his head. Okay. so he could lift more. A lot more.
The next day, Tony sat in a room with a newspaper, Pepper, and Peter, as Rhodey spoke to the press outside.
After having been dating for a year and a half, Tony had asked him to officially move into the penthouse with him and Peter. Almost immediately, Steve had said yes. He'd been pretty much living in the penthouse with them anyway, his clothes and other things still on the floor he was sharing with Sam.
“Wait,” Tony said, making another loop around the forcefield. “Is no one gonna deal with the fact that Cap just told me ‘language’ like I’m Peter?”
Tony shut them out, doing his best to stay focused. He lost himself in the code, in the work he was doing. He typed and taped, fingers flying as he made the needed changes. This needed to be there, and that needed to be taken out completely. Just one last change, and-
Peter glanced at Obie, then unbuttoned the top few buttons of his shirt. There, in the center of his sternum, sat the mini arc reactor. Peter stared, Obie forgotten, and reached out to touch it. Obie seemed to dislike this, and quickly reached out to button Tony’s shirt back up.
“Oh thank god,” Peter breathed, looking the guy right in the eye. “You have something in your teeth. It’s really distracting.”
When Steve saw Thanos, five stones in hand and reaching for the sixth, he panicked. He charged forward, rather blindly, punched the Titan in the face, and started to grapple desperately with him, trying to take the stone's from him. Adrenaline pumped through him, keeping him on his toes.
She came forward to wrap her arms around him, squeeze him tight as tears streamed down her face. When she let him go, she ran out of the room. Jarvis opened the door for the next person who wanted to see him, and Rhodey came in. He looked furious, but like Pepper, his expression changed when he saw Tony.
It was clear that Bucky was uncomfortable being the one Peter was having this talk with. He looked about ready to just back up into the elevator and leave. But Peter needed advice, and with his dad and pops gone, Bucky was the only one to give it.
Turning to look down the road, Steve blinked as two teens ran towards him. Well, one of them ran. The other was jogging and gasping like a fish out of water.
“You’re Peter Stark,” Harry said, slowly, drawing Ned and Gwen’s attention back to Peter. “And I’m an idiot.”
Tony sighed, leaning back in his chair. How did he say this? How did he explain things in a way that she could understand over the phone?
“Whoa,” Tony blinked, as the Soldier whipped around to scowl at him. “Sleeping Beauty is up. Come on, sit. Wanna reattach the arm.”
His worst fears had come true and he was horrified to find the cell empty. Wilson stood in the hall, beaming like an idiot, and
Bucky didn’t say anything to that, and after a while of Bucky kinda just… watching them play card games, they decided to let Bucky get used to his new floor. Steve led Sam up to the floor above Bucky’s, just below the penthouse and Tony’s lab, which Steve knew was his floor. He didn’t mind the idea of sharing it with Sam. In fact, it would probably be fun to share a living space with someone again.
“Oh no,” Nat said. “Only I get to say that. You didn’t see the sextual tension during the whole Hydra thing. That was so intense, it was ridiculous.”
“Hi!” His dad said with his usual grin, wearing jeans, a Metallica T-shirt, and sunglasses. “Midtown High science group right?”
Once he managed to calm himself down, he did open comms to get the attention of everyone he could. With that done, he had hurried to the panther statue, taking stock of his remaining Avengers. There… weren’t very many of them.
Pepper rushed off, leaving Tony to wonder in confusion why he was here. Had he been out with the others and gotten hit or something? Why couldn’t he remember?
“Yeah,” Tony said as he stared up at the mass amounts of stolen things from the Battle of New York. “I got… something bigger.”
Thor didn’t reply, and seemed to wander off in a daze. Steve went to follow, try to get to his teammate, only for Natasha to be be attacked. His eyes widened, and he tried to figure out what to do. Bucky and Clint were still active, and he could still fight.
She reached in, making a disgusted face. When he hand touched the plasma discharge, she looked about ready to run. Then she made a comment on the smell, and hey! That was just rude. She eventually got the wire, starting to pull it out. As she pulled, it touched the walls, and Tony jerked.
“But he said he’d would be back last week,” Peter grumbled, definitely not pouting as he slouched in his seat, only half heartedly playing the game. “I haven’t seen him since his graduation party three weeks ago…”
I spent a lot of time trying to figure out Wade's... Deadpool-ness, and how to protray it. And how to get to that point while still setting things up for the next chapter.
This is a sort of between chapter, to fill in what would be a two year gap between Winter Soldier chapter and the Age of Ultron Chapter. Have fun~
Steve was immensely grateful for Coulson's and Bruce's offers. Without that worry, it didn't take to long after that for them to have their groups sorted. Steve would lead a frontal assault team made of Thor and Natasha, since Thanos knew about them already. If Rhodes arrived in time, he'd join then, while the others split into two flanking teams.
This deserved some practical testing, though. Some real life, outside the safetynet testing! So he pulled on one of Thor’s hoodies, the man had to many anyway, and put on his old spider legs backpack just in case, started walking around New York, looking for an empty alley that he’d seen some older kids do parkour in. It wasn’t to hard, and he pulled up the hood to take a running jump and grab onto the edge of a fire escape. With ease, he pulled himself up, biting his lip and doing a backflip off the edge to flip back and grab onto the opposite wall. Lifting one hand from the wall, he aimed at the lip of the roof, chewing his lip as he shot the strand of webbing. So far, so good.
Steve listened, thought, and tried to make sense of this. It was… it was to big a coincidence. A woman that looked like Peter? That died not long after giving birth? No, it couldn't be…
“I’m gonna work through his crew, crushing skulls until one of them tell me where Francis is. Then I’ll force him to cure my face. And once he has, I’ll crush him up into a fine vintage and win Peter back.”
The first week was mostly going to be team building things. Getting to know the others and making friends was an important part of what this camp was trying to do, aside from bring back people's love for science. The second week was going to mostly be them doing actual sciencey things. Like building tower structures, potato batteries, and other easy sort of introductory stuff that that they would do later in high school.
Peter Benjamin Stark. They both liked science, though, and Harry actually talked about how he felt about his mom being gone, which Peter could sympathize with. Peter wished he could have known his mother in person to…
Peter followed the others on the tour, studying everything and wondering what everything did and how it worked. Everything just looked so interesting, he wanted to know everything!
“Wade?” Peter called, just as his Spidey sense started sending pin pricks all along his skin. He turned, his guard instantly up as he saw a man standing in the gloom of the alley. “You’re not Wade.”
In shape and size, it would be (theoretically) the exact same as the original flesh arm that had been taken from Barnes. And the strong but flexible metal on the outside would flex similar to the skin that would have been on the surface. The star was still on the shoulder, since Tony didn’t know if the man had wanted it gone or not, but there was a watch that was made specifically for the metal arm with a button that activated a sort of cloaking mode. It would made the metal look like regular skin, giving Bucky a chance at blending in with the surrounding population. Plus a few other things Tony kinda didn’t remember putting in.
She hung up, and Tony could hear her as she came down the stairs. She stared at him through the glass at the entrance, and he grinned a little. The new, even brighter arc reactor sat in his hands.
"What about Tony?" Bruce asked, a few murmurs of agreement spreading across the table. "He should be here."
With a sigh, Pepper put a hand to her forehead. “Fine… Just, don’t take to long to get back to them… It looked really important.”
This caused Bucky to pause. While Steve had told Bucky about his relationship problems, Bucky had told him about the dreams he had. The memory dreams about killing people, following orders he didn't want to follow. He had told Steve a few things that Steve had already known about, and a few that had shocked him. But it was helping to talk about them.
Tony, finding his son forever adorable and precious, pandered to his whim and picked him up. They grinned at each other, then at Pepper. She gave a long sigh.
Coulson hadn't been pleased. Well, the man never seemed to be. But he seemed to be channeling Nick Fury pretty well right now. Wade was a little offended, but shrugged it off. Coulson wasn't keen on trusting him. Oh well.
With a snort and a grin, Weasel grabbed a glass and filled it, holding it up to clink it against the bottle Wade was drinking from. “Deadpool… To you, Mr. Pool.”
*Edit, like, five seconds after posting* There are still tags missing! I only just finished chapter 3! And no, I do not want to panic you! I will not be killing off Peter in the future! I think.
“That’s why you guys took me?” Peter asks, shaking his head. “You’re a couple years to late. Wade, he’s dead.”
Tony frowned, working on the latest version of Natasha's Widow Stingers. “You have my approval to make a large purchase on my card. Might want to hurry, though, or you won't be able to get enough food.”
“He’s insane, Tony! He needs to be brought in before-” His pops cut off, noticing him in the door. “Oh, hey Pete. You’re home early… Why aren’t you at the skatepark with your friends?”
And then, as Tony tucked Peter in on one side, and slid in on the other, Tony knew who’d been sleeping there. Who else but the little five year next to him? Tony winced, then looked down as Peter wriggled over to him. He sighed, and went to reach for his tablet, only to realise just how tired he was, and fall asleep.
“Villagers have been forced to take shelter in whatever crude dwellings they can find in the ruins of other villages, or her in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant.” There were sounds of gunfire from the tv, and Tony took deep breaths, clenching and unclenching the gauntlet fist. “Recent violence has been attributed to a group of foreign fighters referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.
“The suit’s at 48% power and falling, sir,” the AI said truthfully. “That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight.”
“I know,” he said, pressing the ring into Tony’s hand. “I know that we’re going to face a near unending army of robots, and I know that you want us to talk about it, but there isn’t time right now. We’ll talk later, when this is all over, for sure, alright? And if we don’t make it, then at least we both know that we’re willing to work it out, okay?”
Steve huffed as he got his suit, pulling it on as Tony got his own. He already had a lecture prepared in his head. For who, Tony or Deadpool, Steve wasn’t sure. Maybe it was both. When he rejoined with Tony, he barely had a second before his husband was was lifting him up and away from the tower.
Tony was agitated. Sure, he'd seen his son just a few hours before after two and a half weeks away from him, but he was still agitated. Annoyed. Irritated.
Tony stared, eyes welled up with tears as he struggled to breath, to shake off this offle nightmare. This offle, offle nightmare that he was in. It couldn’t be real, it couldn’t be real!
Peter could hear his dad, knew that he was talking, but he didn’t register any of the words. With shaking hands, he reached into the box, moving things around as he looked at them. To most, it would look like just random junk. But to Peter? It was a box full of his best memories of Wade. A clip full of stubs from all the movies they’d gone to over the last year, along with a little case filled with old polaroids that Wade would take in the middle of anything they did. There was a little Voltron ring at the bottom, and Peter choked out a laugh, because Netflix just announced the new series, and Wade would have loved to watch it. There were other small things, but the two biggest were the skateboard, which Wade had always joked about giving to him once he mastered it, and the hoodie Peter always stole when they went on late night dates and Wade would walk him home after dinner at a dinner or a tiny restaurant.
“Nuh-uh,” Deadpool insisted, making Steve close his eyes in frustration. “There is no way in hell I’m setting foot in that tower again. Not like this. The only way you can get me to go back before this whole thing is fixed is if I’m dead, and we all know that isn’t happening!”
Even though Steve had said they'd have a team meeting after Tony had rested, he called the team into the conference room as soon as Tony and the twins were asleep. He knew that he should let Tony join them, but… Steve had seen him after New York. Had seen Tony at his worst, and this… This was going to surpass all of that. Tony just wasn't in the right mind to be out on the field.
In high school, she'd played tennis, ran track, and had been very healthy up until the cancer. She had eyes so much like Peter's that when Tony had found a picture of her, he'd seen only Peter. Everyone said that Peter looked so much like him, but Mary Parker… God, Peter looked so much like her that Tony couldn't see himself in Peter.
Steve could only stare, watching as the boy rolled the old man away. Peter… It couldn’t be. It couldn’t be Peter! The man had to be at least in his nineties. It couldn’t be his Peter. It wasn’t possible! He watched them go, and turned to look at the tombstone that sat before him. At the inscription, Steve nearly let out a wail.
Tony couldn't hear, waving his hands in front of the baby, trying to get it to calm down. “Don't cry,” He said desperately. “Come on, I can't deal with crying babies! I can't deal with any babies! What do you want?!”
They reached the skatepark, and headed inside the gate. It was built for all kinds of skaters, so there was an area meant for the more novice people, where Gwen, Ned, and MJ spent most of their time, just relaxing and having fun while Peter and Harry tried the harder stuff. But first, they got a picnic table to put all their extra stuff, and went to the incorporated food stand. Peter got his usual nachos, and sat down at the bench to eat some while the others were getting their pads and helmets on.
As he was contemplating this, the door opened again, and Tony turned to look as a blond man stepped in. He didn’t seem to notice that Tony was awake, and simply came forward, and placed a vase of carnations on the table next to the cards. Eventually, he noticed Tony looking at him, and went wide eyed.
Tony had loved Captain America as a kid. He had loved the stories his Aunt Peggy told him, loved the hero, loved the legend. He had kept a poster on his wall, and had all the comics. Because Captain America was his hero.
Steve chewed his lip, but took a seat in the bedside chair. "Well, after you took that hit, Coulson and Bruce arrived. They worked to do first aid on you, while I went back to the fight. With the Space Stone, I was able to avoid a lot of Thanos' attacks, get an upper hand as I improvised. Wade jumped in about that time, and it didn't take too long for the both of us, Carol, and the others to over power him. Even with the five other stones, Thanos couldn't predicted Wade's erratic fighting style. So when we got close enough…"
When Tony finally added the last bit of data to Peter's now massive file on his mother, he'd had one of Mary about the time that Tony had met her that he had framed for Peter's room. There were just so few pictures of her then, for some strange reason, but the picture that Tony had found was enough.
But soon, Peter was on his way to his Aunt's office. He waved to the guard at the front desk, and walked to the elevator. Going up and up, almost to the top, until Peter finally stepped out. Bouncing on his toes, Peter reached out, knocking soundly on the door before poking his head inside.
“Yeah,” he said quickly. “It should be fine. It’s like Operation. You just don’t let it touch the socket wall or it goes beep.”
“I take back what I said about Peter. The kid’s not self absorbed or obsessed with looks, but even that guy probably wouldn’t be able to stand your face. Seriously, you look like Freddy Krueger face fucked a topographical map of Utah.”
Steve could hear Tony snickering in the suit, and he cleared his throat to remind his husband what they came here for in the first place.
While an analysis of the goop was going, he did some more physical tests of his body. If his muscle mass had risen, could he lift more? Could he aim the goop? Was it possible to shoot strings of it? Could he stick and unstick to things?
So he plucked the ring out of the box and put it in his pocket before joining the others in the lounge.
“Please, sir, let them do their job. He has a good chance of survival if they can get him to hospital now, but you’re gonna have to let them help him for that to happen.” The paramedic soothes and fucking hell, he was strong. Tony just flails in his muscly arms, still sobbing as the medics fit an oxygen mask over Steve’s face and jam tubes into his arm. The dressings padded around his torso begin to bleed dark red as they move him onto a stretcher and carry him from the room; the kind paramedic letting Tony go from his hold to follow.
“Hi.” Steve’s voice mirrors Tony’s for hoarseness, and there are already signs of puffiness ringing his eyes. “Congratulations, Tony.”
Pepper struggles with the remote to switch the TV off and the picture disappears immediately with a click. Tony just stares at the screen with increasing relief and horror.
Tony’s lips quirk up into a soft smile. He brushes his fingertips through the strands of Steve’s hair that was flopping over his forehead.
Recognition flashes in Rogers’ eyes before he too was falsely smiling and confidently gripping Tony’s hand. The woman standing with Rogers had disappeared but the beautiful brunette man hovering around Rogers’ shoulder stayed exactly where he was.
“Oh uh,” Rogers gestures to the hovering man with his elbow and Tony gives the stranger a professional smile. “This is my bodyguard, James Barnes, but we call him Bucky.”
However, after a particularly explosive conference that left them both hurt and reeling for a few days before two passionate rounds of wall sex in Tony’s office, the ball of fondness and compassion in Tony’s chest was growing. His hurtful words against Steve began to lose their heat until it got to a point where he had to pretend how much he loathed the man. It was clear that Steve was finding it hard to keep their show rivalry fiery as well, judging by how soon he would call Tony with deep apologies after talking bollocks.
“You thought there were more intruders, and I would be vulnerable because I’m still in recovery.” Steve finishes for him and all Tony can do is nod shakily against his collarbone. “Everything’s okay, I promise. It was nothing.”
“-will recover.” Tony finishes for him adamantly and manipulates his chest into calming down slightly. “It will, baby. God, we’ve been through some shit this last week but it will get better, it has to get better."
He felt numb. It was a feeling he hadn’t felt since the days of Howard; not even breaking up with Pepper had made him feel this withdrawn. Tony was aware that Pepper was speaking to him, but the words weren’t clear, and instead her voice was like a tedious hum in his chest. Subdued pain crackled through his nerves, but it was like his body was protecting itself from the full onslaught. His soul had taken a battering already in his rather short life- maybe it was muscle memory to get his senses to shut down.
“Okay, right- let’s have: Angelina Jolie, Rihanna- she’s fucking hot, guys- and… oh I know,” Sam’s eyes harden into something animalistic as he bites his lip. “Clint.”
“Mr Stark.” The surgeon holds her hand out warmly; the exhaustion lines etched around her eyes taking the life out of them. “I am Dr Beech, I presided over Mr Rogers’ surgery.”
The hip brace caging Steve’s pelvis as well as the stitching branded into his torso glares at them mockingly.
Iron Man and Captain America in a committed relationship was never going to have worked out. Everybody told them, warned them even. Pepper even gave them an ultimatum: they could have their roles within The Avengers, or they could have each other. On paper, it was simple. In reality, it was crippling anxiety on missions, it was disagreements on tactics and it was long, drawn-out nights of screaming and hurting.
Dust crackles under his shoes as he stands politely on the front porch and rings the doorbell. Nobody answers.
“I know,” Steve’s voice is gravelly from the little sleep he’s getting at night so he clears his throat to try and resolve how tight it is. “This is what heartbreak looks like.”
A horrible, thick silence descends on the trio; the only audible sound being the monotonous tick of the analogue clock in the room. It’s clear that Matilda doesn’t really know what to say, judging by how quickly her eyes are darting between them like fireworks. After a few seconds of Steve digging his nails into his palms and Tony trying to swallow past the boulder in his oesophagus, she clears her throat determinedly.
“We’ve both lost somebody we love.” She whispers into the lights. Steve can feel his eyebrows knitting together in confusion.
With a predatory snarl, Tony stalks up to Steve in two long strides to jump towards his chest, legs winding around his waist. Steve’s arms immediately catch him and rest under his ass as they claim each other’s mouths with desperation. Steve bites down on Tony’s plump lower lip to demand entrance as Tony opens up pliantly. He licks into Tony’s mouth with a pleased groan; Tony’s palms sliding down his taut stomach and coming teasingly close to his waistband.
“Really? Who, Tony Stark? The son of the most hated man in weaponry? Gee, Steve, thanks for the enlightenment!”
“I don’t mean Nat.” Pepper interjects calmly and sends him a look when he chokes on his exhalation. “You- he always- you know what I mean.”
Out of nowhere, Tony feels suffocated. Steve’s muscles feel as hard as rocks and the arm casually draped over his stomach is like lead. He needs to get out, he needs-
Tony flicks his gaze up to meet his saviour’s and lets all of the pain, the hurt, the sheer excruciation that Howard had left him with bleed into his features.
“You have no idea how scared I’ve been.” Tony admits into his husband’s warm- alive- skin and Steve stiffens and pulls back to hold him at arm’s length. Without Steve’s body pressed against his, Tony realises how much his body was shaking and he becomes painfully aware of how wild and terrified his eyes must look.
“Because you have a dartboard covered in newspaper clippings of Rogers’ party, The Associates, to hammer with pointy missiles.” Pepper points out. “And because you talk shit about your opposition to the press without being bothered to look up who they actually are.”
With a disinterested shrug, Tony brings his glass up to his lips to take a leisurely sip of his drink. “I just remember talking about the legal cases between your party and Nick Fury’s trading company.”
“Yeah, I know.” He murmurs back and blinks back tears with a cough. “I can’t blame you for that. You moved on.”
“The shooting wasn’t your fault, sweetheart.” The brace caging Steve’s hip and upper leg whirs sickeningly when he flexes the bone. “But it wasn’t the Presidency’s fault either. You can’t blame what happened on your occupation, because then those sick bastards have won.”
The tremor through his voice was pathetic. He should be celebrating, he should be elated, it’s everything he ever dreamed of, he… he-
Steve groans and slips his eyes closed for a second. “I know, I just- oh god, I know. Clint, and Sam, and Nat… I was in a bad place when I left, so picking up the phone to ring back scared the shit outta me if I’m being honest.”
The event stretched on for another few hours. Pepper nearly toppled onto Thor with how closely she was standing to him, but luckily the unpredictable weatherman turned politics bullshitter laughed it off good-naturedly. Tony thought the opposite, especially when he literally had to pull Pepper off Thor’s lap so that the poor man could go and converse with his guests. Nevertheless, Pepper is what Pepper does, and within the hour she had a meeting with Thor’s company forcefully carved into the back of Thor’s hand and a smug smile perched on her scarlet lips.
to, Steve, you chose to. You chose to leave me to pick up the pieces and keep everything going alone. You ran away to Ireland with your tail between your legs because it was the easy way out. Don’t you dare,” Tony spits, and puts down his basket to point his index finger in Steve’s face in anger. “Say that you had to. I didn’t force you to. We could’ve made the situation work.”
“Oh, this is bad.” Tony mutters and flings the newspaper down on his desk. Pepper looms over him with a face like thunder and crossed arms as her fingernails tap an explosive rhythm on her wrist.
“Hi, um, I’m looking for my husband Steve Rogers?” Tony asks her. Recognition passes through her eyes but she suppresses it professionally to check her paperwork.
“I shouldn’t have come up to you.” Steve voices with a small huff, the golden hue of country sunshine- a sunshine that came straight to the ground without having to bounce off a few skyscrapers first- illuminates the white blonde streaks in his hair. “I’m sorry, I should’ve just- ah. I should’ve left you alone.”
“She’s not gonna rifle through your thoughts and diagnose you mentally unstable on the spot, Steve.” Bucky continues with an eye roll. “Matilda listens to what you’re saying and she genuinely wants to help. It worked for me, for fucks sake. Me, Steve, the guy who doesn’t have feelings.”
“You said he was flying to LA to give you both some space, right?” Nat mediates from her position reclined in Tony’s chair. Tony nods and she continues with a sigh. “Well that’s a good thing. You did say you needed to sort yourselves out before dealing with the marriage, so maybe this break is exactly what you need?”
Her waterproof boots are neon green with pink flamingos trimming the toe and heel. They’re bright and obnoxious and so typically Tony and Steve adores them. He tells the girl exactly that and she turns to her Mom with wide eyes gleaming with pride. Pepper pushes a hand through her tousled hair and tells her
Matilda- their alarmingly young therapist- can only sit there with a stunned expression as Tony leans back in his chair.
Tony scoffs and salutes hello at Vision when he waves from the front passenger seat, aviator sunglasses perched on the top of his head and an apple core in his hand.
Pepper turns around with a huge, animalistic grin. “But sweetie,” she simpers. “It is- you’ve got me.”
“I’ve heard that Stark can ruin a reputation in a heartbeat so I’m not gonna open my mouth and make more enemies for a fight between you and him.”
“I’ve lost my v-line.” Steve states in a slight warning with annoyance curtaining his features but Tony can’t subdue the amused burst of laughter that erupts from his lungs.
Tony wriggles in his hold to release the nervous energy thrumming through his veins that leaves an empty exhaustion in its wake.
Steve nods jaggedly and gently puts Tony’s shaking hands back down to his sides with his fingers still circled loosely around his wrists. “Of course I’m okay, gorgeous. Fuck, Tony sweetheart, I’m alive and so are you and everyone’s fine.” A whine escapes Steve’s throat as he shifts down onto his good leg, his fingers twitching to pull Tony to him. In the days of successive nightmares- nightmares that haunted Tony’s sleep for weeks, nightmares that he solely blamed on his bastard father’s ghost- Steve could just let Tony tumble into his lap and hold him for as long as it took for the monsters to go away.
“Yeah.” Steve replies miserably and places his hands in his lap to hide the shivers running up and down his appendages.
He can’t help the bite that jars the ends of the words. Steve seems taken aback but to his credit, keeps up his façade of nonchalant politeness.
Thankfully, Steve’s lips twist upwards into a smirk that Tony recognises and he inwardly sighs with relief.
Morgan regards him carefully for a few seconds before she nods seriously and starts playing with a loose thread erupting from his jeans. “Me too.”
“You ready?” He cuts him off with a forced smile and stands back slightly to hold his arms out at right angles. Steve snorts and twists his body to lift his legs off the bed and place them on the floor agonisingly slowly, his hands also outstretched. Tony rests his arms under the other man’s and clasps Steve’s elbows- engaging his core to help pull his husband up to his feet. Nails from Steve’s tense fingers dig crescent moons into the fragile skin at his inner elbows but Tony bites his tongue to stop himself from complaining. Once successfully up, Steve has to catch his breath so they stand there holding onto each other for a moment, slightly swaying. Tony’s hands slide down onto Steve’s hips and he squeezes the good one with a grin.
Pepper lost Tony. He didn’t lose Tony; Tony wasn’t his to lose. This woman lost her husband, the love of her life, and she was pitying Steve like he was the widow destined for a life of pain.
“Well I’m not!” Steve yells out of nowhere and Peter quickly makes a beeline for the safety of Pepper’s office. “Goddamnit Tony! I’m trying to save our marriage.”
“Are you gonna tell me what’s going on here or-…” Steve wonders aloud to Bucky’s back before he’s turning round again with a sigh and handing Steve the paper.
In the end, he had asked Bruce to have a word with Tony. It didn’t take long for one of Tony’s oldest friends and his rudimentary psychiatrist to show him what an important opportunity he was passing up. That and a bit of blackmail, and Tony was ready to talk.
“It’s Happy,” she had whispered hoarsely to drag a finger down Tony’s jaw. The mere mention of one of Tony’s oldest friends caused his heart to go into overdrive. “Tony he, he-”
Tony can’t help but flick his eyes over to Alannah, who’s inspecting some apples whilst chatting pleasantly with the vendor. No, he would never have guessed.
“Understood.” Steve retorts seriously, but gives Tony a sloppy mock salute that makes the edges of his lips quirk upwards.
“You’ve slept with the majority of New York!” Tony yells back. Steve scoffs and rolls his eyes with a forced laugh.
She nods in quiet confusion before he remembers himself, grins falsely, and shakes her hand. “Why, of course!  How could I forget?” Every lie felt like smoke unfurling between his teeth.
She shakes her head. “There’s no point.” Her voice is sympathetic and slow. “The surgery will most probably take hours, especially if it’s a shooting injury- that’s what the paramedic report said. We don’t know where Mr Rogers will end up either: he may go into a recovery room or they might take him straight to the ICU. The best thing to do is to wait here. The doctors will update you when they can, I promise.”
Tony flicks his eyes up to Pepper’s quivering features as she visibly sighs in relief at his alertness.
Pepper sniffs loudly and shudders behind him so he pulls her round to wind an arm around her waist. She places a gentle hand on Steve’s thigh as they survey the damage one idiot with a gun could do.
Tony frowns and snorts slightly. “What, because she’s engaged to the old Captain America? That’s a bit narcissistic, don’t you think?”
“No,” his eyes flash with warning. “They were false data misuse charges that were swiftly dropped when the court proved that they were fantasies.”
“He’ll be fine.” Nat assures him but she can’t look him in the eyes. “The security team will make sure he’s safe. Please, babe, calm down.”
“One of my interns, Natasha, started her job today. She spent the first hour being yelled at by horrible journalists because she didn’t know how to answer the invasive questions that they were asking her. She was sobbing by the second hour, Tony.”
for the first time in nearly fourteen days. His lungs scream at being forced wide open as he inhales as much clean, content air as he possibly can.
Not exhausted. Shattered, like broken. Shattered: like hearts are into millions of pieces when the one person you would die for passes away themselves. Steve always hated that expression.
“I know,” she offers, and tucks a stray tendril of hair behind her ear. “You obviously haven’t talked to anyone about what’s happened… I’m kinda hoping you’ll talk to me.”
“No pal, me and Tony are golden, honestly. I think he’s just shaken up from that false alarm with the security after, you know, what happened at the tower.”
Steve swallows heavily and lets his shoulders properly drop for the first time in months. “Don’t you dare put up with the nightmares. They are not something that you should feel like you have to contend with, baby.”
“You did that because you were scared, not because having a job in politics has ruined us.” Steve interrupts with a sharp slap to his own leg for emphasis. “Take some goddamn responsibility.”
Every nerve-ending in Tony’s body felt like it was on fire. Peter screams painfully somewhere close to Tony’s left ear, but his entire focus is on the plummeting dead weight of the man he loved more than himself, his whole pelvis area painted death red.
Tony’s greeted with bored blue eyes when he walks into the hospital room with a folder. The eyes immediately light up when the gaze drags upwards from a newspaper (“there aren’t any cartoons in this one!”) and Tony’s heart clenches with love.
He pushes all this down- deep, deep down- and laughs at the ridiculousness of the situation. Steve was engaged to someone far more attractive and far less complicated than him. Tony was stuck at the compound, fighting a losing battle with the UN, still trying to piece himself back together after Steve, and still couldn’t find any bastard portabella mushrooms for the skewers.
“I love you too.” His husband laughs and beckons Tony closer to curl up against his ribcage, extremely mindful of the surgical bandages. Tony wriggles sleepily into his collarbone and takes in the familiar presence of his true love. “Mr President.”
Steve doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “Thank you.” He settles, and shakes his head to himself. “It’s not enough, but thank you. For understanding, for letting it happen for- I- I didn’t- didn’t- um…”
The realisation that everyone he cared about most in the world was still breathing blankets Tony in a haze of numbness; he starts to feel shaky again.
“How highly illegal.” Tony deadpans and claps the doctor on the back as she slides out of the door. Steve watches her go with a wave before he’s clearing his throat and shrugging his shoulders at Tony’s watchful gaze.
“I’m sorry.” Tony croaks after a while and reaches out with his ring finger to gently run parallel with the angry mark down Steve’s neck. Steve catches the finger with his other hand and presses his lips to the pad of it fiercely.
Pepper exhales shakily and looks around the room for the TV remote to give them a bit of background noise. Tony became painfully aware that he was beginning to count the beeps of the heart monitor- his whole nervous system taut with apprehension at the risk of the steady pattern stuttering.
Sensing that the conversation could lead the two volatile friends launching at each other in his car, Sam clears his throat and taps on the wheel nervously.
“With a huge dick.” Tony finishes helpfully and manages to swiftly avoid Pepper’s palm making contact with his shoulder.
Midas lights dazzled around Tony as he smiled; he couldn’t really distinguish whether it was Pepper or the copious amount of champagne that was causing his happiness. He links his arm with his best friend’s and kisses her softly on the cheek.
“Stop making my staff cry.” Pepper continues with a glaring warning that sends shivers down Tony’s spine. “I’m not joking. Watch what you say, otherwise you’re dealing with the consequences. I’m done. I’ll get Natasha to replace me, seen as she was already thrown in the deep end today.”
“He’s doing my fucking head in.” Tony groans a few days later, stapling some documents together with enough force to send a framed photo crashing onto the floor. Pepper just murmurs in agreement and slams yet another folder down on his desk. Nat had come to visit them both in their offices after a particularly volatile PR appearance had resulted in riot police surrounding Tony’s car but so far, Tony had just moaned about Steve.
“Red line, red fucking line!” Tony screeches to himself and looks around wildly at the multiple corridors tunnelling off from the double doors. Pepper spots it first and runs towards the corridor, helpfully marked with ‘Resus’; her heels clacking splittingly on the tiled floors.
As a toxic twist of fate, the following week sees Rogers rips apart The Avengers’ latest economy policies on an Australian news channel. Tony yells at him down the phone for an entire five minutes before Rogers hangs up with a cackle that sends butterflies swarming through Tony’s stomach.
“Are you crazy?” Peter shrieks incredulously and waves his hand around above his head to signify the utter chaos that was occurring above them. “You don’t think people would’ve already noticed this?!”
“I don’t care,” Tony shakes his head quickly. “He’s my husband; I have to see for myself that he’s alive.”
What, in the actual fucking heavens of all that is holy, can he say to that? Steve’s ribs clench with panic as he goes to defend himself- goes to defend him and Tony- but Pepper’s already looked away like she’s said her peace. Did she expect him to deny it? How could he? He’d seen Pepper lose everything that day and had watched as she’d sobbed for her husband. He’d stood there, blankly, as she had the love of her life snatched away from her. But then again, so had Steve.
Pepper leans across to press a soft kiss against his temple. He weaves their fingers together and squeezes.
Tony grits his teeth, notices how the sunlight reflecting on his framed photos creates a halo of warm light around Happy’s head and opens his mouth.
“This is not a moment for insult-slinging,” her voice is firm and authoritative but carries a gentle tone to it that makes Tony feel guilty and relaxed simultaneously. “The months around when you two first met sound hectic and full of contrasting emotion. I appreciate you sharing that time with me, Tony. I can only imagine how hard it must have been.”
“Fine. I’m not doing too hot after we had a faux security breach here recently. It brought back the fear from the shooting and I’m constantly scared.” He explains and folds his arms petulantly. Steve exhales sharply and looks away.
STARK: Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.
"Already?" Wade snarled. "You're typing this out right now, aren't you? You knew I was coming. You knew the moment I walked through the door. That's why you left it open."
The man gave a glance around, and then leaned forward. “Mr. Wilson, I represent an organization that may be able to help. What if I told you we can cure your cancer? And what’s more, give you abilities most men only dream of? You've met the Avengers. The world needs extraordinary men like them. We won’t just make you better. We’ll make you
They chatted idly on the way. MJ talked about the new play she was going to be in, and Harry was talking about his dads new intern program with Gwen. Peter was in the back with Ned, Wade’s old board tucked under his arm.
“That’s Deadpool,” Peter mused, rolling his eyes. “He does things without thinking them through because of his healing-factor.”
Obadiah laughed, shooting at him with a mistle, but missing. “You tried to rid the world of weapons, but you gave it its best one yet.”
Peter chewed his lip, thinking for a moment, before he picked up his board and ran to grab his bag. He slung it over his shoulder, saying something to Ned before hurrying to the back gate, turning into the alley to look around for Wade. It was a slim chance, it actually being Wade, but he had to at least try.
Coulson did in fact go to Pepper, who was off on the dance floor. Tony got Peter some different crackers, some cheese, and picked him up as he ate. Peter was getting tired, Tony could see. Not that he could blame him. Events like this took a lot out of Tony, too.
It was great, lots of fun. There was cake and presents, and lots of pictures taken. Peter wouldn't have changed it for all the world.
But as the hunger pains grew, Tony felt his chest tighten. There was still so much left that he had to do. So much he’d left unfinished. He looked down at the tape. He could flip it over, record another message. For… For Steve.
“They’re katanas,” he corrected, a smile showing through his mask, though he turned to look at an odd angle, off to the side, as he continued. “Really, they are katana’s. Wolfy thinks they’re impractical, since they’re both long swords, and honestly, she’s right, but I have a bit of a power boost so it’s not that hard.”
Wade found that finding the author, once he was in her reality, was far to easy. He was a mercenary, after all. Hunting people down was part of the job.
In the end, he had to move to get on the suit, ready to head to Sokovia to face Ultron. He sat in the back as he finalized Friday’s full installation into the suit, while Steve gave everyone a speech. It was Steve’s thing, what he did to help work everything out. He was a good leader that way.
“Hydra,” Tony said. “Because this thing doesn't have any kind of dampener, and I'm guessing that may be partially why he got so aggressive.”
“Someone seemed to have cut power, temporarily, to the network,” the AI said quickly. “However, there is something, or rather, someone at the door.”
Peter wanted to ask his dad what he was doing, but Peter didn't really care. Everyone else was excited, so he'd pretend to be to.
"Bullshit," Tony snarled. "Bruce and Coulson are both staying behind, and can do a perfectly fine job of taking care of Johnny and Susan while we're gone. I was resting yesterday, and now I'm
“It works,” Peter said, rather insistently, glaring up at Obie from his hiding spot behind Tony’s legs.
"It is," Steve said, stepping into the room and setting the cup down to close the door. With the door secured, he picked up the cup, and brought it over to Tony, who took it carefully to start chugging as Steve shuffled next to his bed.
“Oh good,” Weasel's voice groaned from behind the bar before his head of mop hair popped up. “I thought I was going to have to tell the US government you died for Iron Man and Captain America. Who's the other guy?”
“Can you fix it?” Steve asked, peering over Tony's shoulder just close enough that he could feel Steve's breath dusting his cheek. “So that it doesn't hurt?”
“Oh shit,” Wade said, sucking in a breath. “I forgot you did Spidey’s gear! And I’ve been hanging out with the guy for the last year! I thought we were friends, but he totally bailed on me tonight. I went to ask him for help first, but he never shoved, and-”
Tony looked up how long he had to live. Could be anywhere from six weeks to three months. He needed to start getting things ready for when he was gone.
“Tony,” he gasped, and tears welled up in blue eyes, large hands coming to take one of Tony’s. “Oh thank god! You’ve been out for weeks, and after what happened- I’m so glad you’re okay! No one’s been telling me what’s going on, and after you fainted, I was so worried. What happened?”
Steve reached out, cupping the back of Tony’s neck as he bent down to press their lips together. It was the third time they'd kissed, but it felt like the first. The spark was there, bursting to life anew, though Steve's had never died. It only grew stronger and stronger as he held Tony close, their lips moving together and Steve felt like his heart would burst out of his chest.
Steve pulled Johnny and Susan a little tighter to his chest. "We… don't know. They were off planet when everything happened, and we can't get in contact with them."
“Give us a couple minutes, you guys.” As soon as all the cadets leaving, Rhodey spoke. “I’m surprised. I swear, I didn’t expect to see you walking around so soon.”
He swung up, reaching out to catch her. For a moment, he thought he was going to miss, that his fingers would just barely touch hers, and then she would fall, fall so far down, to smash against the sidewalk. But his arm caught around her waist, pulled her close, and he swung up towards the ledge. Connors stood there, looking absolutely shocked, and in a fit of anger, lept from the window towards them.
“It was a memory. Of one of the people I killed… it was a woman, who looked so much like Stark's kid. She had been working on something that Hydra wanted, and so they had me hunt her down. She'd been pregnant when I started, had the kid sometime while I was tracking her, and then I killed her. I killed a woman who just had a baby…”
Tony paused, taking a deep breath. There was a click, signalling that the cassette had stopped. He leaned his head back, thinking that maybe that would be enough. He was just… so hungry and thirsty and
“Tony,” Steve sighed, sounding exasperated. “Do you not know how to take care of yourself? When was the last time you ate? When was the last time you
But then Tony caught sight of him. That ridiculous blue suit, and the blond hair, all the same as it ever was. As strong and gorgeous as the day Tony met him. Everything seemed to melt away, as Tony thought about everything he and Steve had been through. He could practically hear his own teasing words from the first time he met Steve, or see the smile on Steve's face the day they brought Johnny and Susan home. He could see Peter, grinning like a fool, when he found out he and Steve were together. All the good things from their past was flooding over him now, and he choked a little at the wave of pure emotions that washed through him.
He gave a mock salute, sitting down with Peter secured and buckled next to him. Happy drove them home, and Tony carried Peter all the way inside.
Steve took a deep breath, leaning back in his chair. "Yes… When we got close enough, Wade… He cut off Thanos' arm. The one with the gauntlet. I took the opportunity to take it, put the last Stone in while Wade kept cutting Thanos up, and I… I snapped. My fingers, I mean. To bring everyone back that I could. And when I did…"
His limbs felt heavy, and he desperately wanted nothing more then to lay down and let them stay that way. But he had to move, had to… find a way home. Peter… Peter was… But Johnny and Susan might still be alive. They might still be waiting for him.
After getting the news, Peter spent the rest of the summer trying to come to terms with what had happened. Two and a half months, and he found himself back in school. He had told Ned, since he really didn’t want to talk about it, so Ned told the others for him. The girls gave him hugs, and Harry tried to offer up a plan, but Peter had to walk away to get him to drop it.
“What about Darcy?” Steve asked. “You and her have gotten pretty close. Yeah, I noticed. So what about her? You’re just gonna leave her?”
No use beating around the bush. Best to just come out and say it. Tony was acting strange, and he wanted to know why.
Once everything was moved, Steve and Bucky had plopped down on the penthouse couch, and had knocked out. Tony and Peter would be gone for a few hours, getting it set up for Peter to join some kind of science camp when school let out in a month. They couldn't have been asleep for more then an hour when suddenly Steve was jerked awake as Bucky was jerking violently in his sleep.
His Pops ended up coming home and hanging up the shield. Quite literally. It, along with the Captain America uniform, hung in the back of his fathers' walk in closet, where it would remain until Captain America was absolutely needed. Pops wasn't a full time Avenger anymore, and became a full time dad. Johnny and Susan were never without attention of a human being, something Peter was almost envious of. What he wouldn't have given to get those first five years back with his dad.
Unable to hold them back anymore, the tears spilled from Peter’s eyes, and he hurried to his room. He ignored the calls on his fathers, their voices muffled once he was on the other side of the door. Crawling into bed, Peter pulled the hoodie on, wrapping it around himself like a cacoon in an attempt to keep is trembling body warm as he cried. But now? It only felt cold…
He wanted to argue, to tell her she was being ridiculous. But Tony knew she was right. It was his best chance. So he took off the helmet, and ducked under the main console to start pulling wires. After what felt like hours, Tony was setting the helmet in place on top of the main controls, and sat on the floor. The ship rose, under Friday's mindless control, and started off.
“Don’t worry about it. Water under the bridge, and all that. Besides, I don’t really bla—anyways. Don’t mind the jars. It was just a little cosmetic spell, something to nurture my vanity, you know how it is. Don’t want anyone to see ugly burns or scars, right? It would hurt my reputation.”
His arms finally give out, and his face mashes against Steve’s. Their lips meet, for a fraction of a second, enough for Tony to imagine heat and wetness and intent, and then his fall continues, and their blood smears past Steve’s jaw, down his throat, as Tony’s brow crunches against a step.
Tony’s legs give out, but instead of crashing to the ground, he’s held in a steady grip, and Steve’s eyes aren’t angry anymore, the storm gone, a calm sea the only thing left. He’s smiling slightly.
“I thought things were finally going well, you know? I thought, hey, Tony and I have never been on better terms. The war was far away, I was finally moving on, and you’d even proven yourself worthy when you made the gauntlet and the gems disappear. I should have known it couldn’t have been that easy. And you
He continued muttering things under his breath. Steve, on the other hand, was focusing on the mermaid and mandrake part. Those were things that the spell (or poem, as it was) had mentioned. Were they the conditions to making the curse come true?
All he would need to do is jump-start his heart again before he loses consciousness. He could even set a timer.
“Stark, how come your armour looks like that? I don’t see how you operate that thing without energy supply. And why are all your devices so… different?”
He’s stumbling out of bed, his undersheath already slithering out of his skin, before he can fully comprehend what he’s doing.
His meeting was one minute ago. It’s too late, he can’t go now, it’s already too late. He stalled too much, and now it’s coming back to bite him in the ass.
Once upon a time, Tony Stark was a billionaire, an inventor. Once upon a time, he wore the Iron Man armour and was even considered a hero.
God knows he would have done it already if it was that easy. God knows he would have asked Steve to do a lot of things.
Jarvis was surprised too, asking her what she was doing. Had Tony asked her to fetch something from the castle?
“What’s—Tony, what did you do?” Steve hisses in his ear, and pushes forward, crushing Tony between himself and nothing but thin air.
But it was already too late. Steve could see it, this time, how the marks spread further across Tony’s body. One of them was curling around his jaw, another peeking from underneath his collar. The third condition of the curse had been fulfilled.
will die. And that we’re running out of time. I hate it, but if we’re backed against the wall, we will use the bombs, because I refuse to let you—this Earth and its universe die. I can’t—I can’t
When he stopped his tranformation, Tony was holding his right arm in both his hands, the blue glow seeping under the man’s skin. Tony was sweating, his teeth gritted as he said:
He looked so earnest that Tony was tempted to tell him everything, but he decided to keep his cards close to his chest and learn a bit more about the situation first. Gain information, never give it, as Fury would say.
Still, Tony wants to see how that particular turn of events came to be. He starts on the task of hacking the nearest computer to understand when and where exactly  he is. There's an inhibitor of some kind in the walls, ceiling and floor of the room, no,
It took the better part of fours hours to clean everything and sort out the empty bottles and boxes and jars. There were jars with all kinds of stuff in them: powder, gels, creams, some of them had stones. He even saw one with a lone eye. After that one, he stopped opening the jars.
Well. If he had to be honest: no, he wouldn’t. But he would like to spend it with Natasha. And Stark didn’t seem to have any siblings, or even family. But he had his friends, Jarvis, Potts, and—and others. That he’d never seen or heard about.
Stark’s grimace told Tony everything he needed to know. Behind them, Cap inhaled sharply. Tony didn’t care if he’d heard them, he needed to know if Stark had a cure.
And they’re against a wall again, and Steve still has his hands on his shoulders, and his eyes are burning through Tony’s soul, and there’s a horrible part of Tony that wants to kiss Steve, just to see what will happen, because he’s baring his heart already, why not go all the way? He’s lied to Steve, betrayed him, deceived him for months, so why shouldn’t he make everything the worst it can be by confessing?
There’s a man watching him from the shadows. His shape, his posture, the tension that flows from him are familiar.
