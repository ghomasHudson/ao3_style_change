They arrive at the police station at nearly eight in the morning, exhausted and frazzled. Natasha and Clint flash their SHIELD badges, which JARVIS has assured them are still active, and the cop at the desk takes them into an interrogation room in the back. The boys are sitting at the table holding hands and looking incredibly terrified. When they see the three adults enter, the looks of fear intensify and they huddle closer together. As soon as JARVIS assures them that the surveillance equipment is down, Natasha and Clint take seats opposite the boys while Thor stands in one of the corners near the door, close enough to catch them if they try to run, but not so close that he's blocking the exit.
They stay in the archery range for most of the morning. Tony begs to be allowed to hold an apple while Clint shoots it, and that archer finally agrees to let him hold it in his hand, his arm out to his side. He practically shrieks with joy when the apple shatters in his hand as the arrow hits it. Eventually, Clint moves from just shooting the apples, to performing every trick shot he knows. He has Tasha toss one in the air, then she and Steve toss one at the same time. Then he has them each put one on their heads and hits them both simultaneously. Then Natasha picks up one of the destroyed pieces and has Clint shoot that off her hand. She continues picking up smaller and smaller pieces, until the shot would actually put her hand at risk of being hit. When they finally put an end to the fun, the entire range is covered in mutilated apple pieces, with arrows sticking out of the walls making the room resemble a pin cushion, and there is only one box of apples remaining. Steve sets Tony on top of the box and gives him a ride upstairs, while Clint puts away his bow and arrows, and Natasha goes to shower off the practical applesauce the adventure has left her covered in.
The pies are barely out of the oven and sitting on their cooling racks when the assemble alarm activates, startling Tony so badly he runs into the pantry and hides. Steve quickly deactivates the alarm and opens the door to let Tony know everything is alright. By the time he’s convinced the boy that the bad guys have
“But you didn’t, Clint,” Steve assures him, leaning forward and placing a hand on the archer’s ankle, “You didn’t. I’ll talk to Tony and make sure he understands that he can’t jump on people and startle them like that. Especially you and Natasha. Just take a deep breath. You didn’t hurt him, he’s fine.”
"Considering that they're terrified of being disobedient, they shouldn't be too much trouble. Just don't be gone longer than you have to."
Tony is holding one of the wooden spoons from the kitchen and is hitting Steve's bare behind, while Steve leans against the arm of the couch his pants around his ankles. Natasha quickly darts to Tony and grabs his wrist before he can land another strike, and Clint sprints to Steve, pulling him away from the couch and helping him pull his pants back up. They are both so shocked at what's happened that neither of them can say a word. Thor, noticing this, kneels in front of the surprised boys and gently takes the spoon from Tony's hand.
Tony’s eyes go as big as saucers and Steve suddenly finds his lap full of little boy and tiny hands grip his shoulders tightly.
"We're not going with you!" Tony shouts suddenly, startling the team, "You're killers and bad guys, just like the men that took us!"
"I still believe I should be the one wielding the hammer, friend Clint," Thor insists, looking a bit put out.
They sit there in the living room for over an hour, holding the boys and reassuring them countless times that they are loved and cared for. That no one will ever hurt them again. That they are part of a family. When it starts to grow dark outside, Thor makes them all dinner. They watch and make sure Steve and Tony clean their plates, then take them to their room. Tony takes the top bunk with Steve in the bottom, and once they are tucked under the covers, they fall asleep almost instantly.
She slips into bed that night and is pleased to find that Clint has joined her. She pulls him close and they lose themselves in each other, chasing away the memory of what happened with pleasurable touches and passionate kisses. They fall asleep spent and wrapped in each other's arms.
“Hey, you don’t need to worry about them. That’s Captain America remember? He’s the best superhero out there, and he always comes home safe,” Clint assures the boy, laying a hand on his shoulder.
"Good idea. I shouldn't be on the carrier too long. Clint, can you handle watching them for a few hours?" Natasha asks her partner.
"What do we do now? How do we handle this while SHIELD works on a way to turn them back?" Bruce asks, staring down at his feet, mouth set in a firm line.
Steve takes Tony at his word and pulls out again, snapping his hips forward, driving deeper into his lover. Tony cries out at the movement, but there is nothing of pain in his voice. Just bone shaking pleasure. Between the heavenly feeling around his cock and the noises Tony is making, Steve can tell he isn't going to last very long. He wraps his hand around Tony's cock, eliciting more gorgeous sounds from between the genius' lips.
This chapter is a little shorter than the others, I'm sorry! But I wanted to get the next chapter posted. Thank you so much for all of the comments and love you have given this story!! It gives me motivation to write more!
the appropriate response, and because after seeing Steve's face scrunch up with disgust at the idea of it, Tony is fairly certain Steve will think less of him for wanting something like that. He recovers quickly and stops pacing long enough to respond and change the subject.
"Afraid I can't afford anything that would be up to your taste," Steve grins at him, looking at the opulence in room around him.
With a nod, Fury takes one last look at the sleeping children and heads back to the bridge, trusting that the Avengers can find their way out. Silently, Bruce picks up Tony and Natasha carries Steve back to the jet. Clint gets them in the air quickly, pushing the limits of the small craft's capabilities to get them home as fast as possible.
“So does that make Steve and me partners? Cause I sleep with him!” Tony says loudly, and resumes jumping on the bed.
Steve crawls across the table and lands in Natasha's lap, hugging her just as tightly and crying into her shirt.
She hopes the all seeing guardian hears her, then turns back to the controls and pushes the jet even faster.
Once Tony is gone, Clint gives Steve a horrified look, his hand shaking as he pulls it out from underneath his leg, a four inch blade clutched in his fist. He drops it to the floor, eyes wide.
"I know," she says, standing and going to stand behind him, running her arms around him, "I've been doing the same. But we can't keep dwelling on it. They need our help right now. God willing Bruce and the others will find a way to turn them back quickly, but in the mean time... we have two scared little boys to take care of and teach to be kids again. And I need your help."
“I think… I’m glad we didn’t talk about it before as well. I don’t know how well I would have received the information, because I was denying it just as hard as you were. Though not for the reasons you think. My main problem was the whole being the team leader thing. If we do decide to act on these feelings, and I’d very much like to, it can’t affect our work,” Steve says seriously.
“Smart ass.” Tony snaps, leaning in a little more, but not because he enjoys the warm solidness of Steve against him. “You don’t want me to help them anymore than I do.”
"First of all, you aren't going to be punished for what happened today, do you understand?" Natasha informs them.
The little boy nods jerkily and curls even further into himself. Steve smiles and sits all the way on the floor.
Clint snorts slightly, but quiets quickly when Tasha smacks him none so gently on the arm. She turns and smiles softly at Tony.
"And say what, Bruce? That I can't stop thinking about him? That he's a perfect human being with a god-like body that I spend every waking and sleeping moment dreaming about touching? That hearing his voice in my ear during a fight is so distracting I turn my com off half the time just so I can focus on the task at hand? How exactly am I supposed to say those things to him?" Tony asks, turning back to the computer screen.
"Well, those trainers took you away from us. They erased your memories and made you forget who you were and who we are. Then they did all those horrible things to you. We didn't give you new names. Your names are Steven and Anthony. And we are so happy to have you back home where you belong."
“Really?! I get to stay with Captain America?!” Tony shouts, bouncing up and down in his seat in excitement.
“No, sweetheart. We’re your family. We saved you from the bad guys and brought you home. Do you know who we are?”
"If I had arrived sooner, or gone with them as requested..." There is pain in Thor's voice, as though he is holding back the strength of his emotion.
“Woooohoooo!” Tony yells and goes to his pile of clothes, pulling on one of his new shirts and nearly falling over in his excitement.
Steve isn’t sure he’ll ever get use to little Tony’s excited, fast paced pattern of speech, but his excitement is infectious and Steve smiles.
"Did you have an asthma attack?" Clint asks, receiving a small nod in answer, "Did you take your inhaler?" Another nod. "That's very good, Steve." He pulls the boy in for a hug and pets his hair softly.
"Wait, what? Why does my shield need a name? And what kind of name is Disc of Death?" Steve asks, looking up from his lunch with a look of pure confusion on his face.
He wakes slowly from a pleasant dream. He and Natasha have finally had a chance to go on a real vacation and they are lying on the beach slowly exploring each others bodies. Her hands feel like heaven as they roam his chest and slip lower, sliding down his zipper and pulling his half hard and very interested cock out of his pants. The soft silk of her skin brings him to full arousal quickly, her knowledge of his body evident. She leans down and gently licks the underside of his shaft.
“Most likely,” Steve chuckles warmly, “Speaking of them, do you have any idea how lucky you are to be alive right now?”
After their breakfast turned lunch, Thor takes Tony out into the backyard for some fresh air, letting the boy ride around on his shoulders and pretend he’s flying. Steve allows himself a moment to sit in the peace and quiet of the living room. His respite is interrupted when Pepper drops by with several boxes.
“No one is going to kick anyone out. You didn’t do anything wrong, Tony. You can look at my shield any time you want, alright? You just have to be careful because it’s kind of heavy and I don’t want you to hurt yourself. But it’s pretty cool, isn’t it?” Steve sits in an arm chair in the corner of his room, and settles Tony in his lap.
“So do I,” Steve agrees, sliding his hand a little lower down Tony’s back, till it rests on the curve of his hip, and Tony has to strain not to arch into the touch, “Very much.”
"Facial recognition match, 83%," JARVIS's voice interrupts their stipulating, "A gas station near the mansion. The cashier called the local police to report two young boys, unattended, purchasing food and drinks."
"Did you finish the work up on Steve's shield? Any improvements that can be made?" Banner asks with a small shake of his head.
"I have a thought about that," Bruce informs her, and she can hear the shuffling of papers in the background, "Their blood work came back and there's a strange substance we can't identify. It looks like they might have been drugged."
Steve groans and buries his head back in his hands, wishing fervently that he didn't know any of this information about Clint's sex life.
“Hill! What the hell was that?” he yells at his second-in-command when the ship finally stops shaking.
Steve looks at each of them in turn, but before he can make a decision, Clint sighs heavily and lays his bow on the table and begins unbuckling his quiver.
With all that has happened in the last couple of days, Natasha thought she had finally reached the end of her ability to be shocked. But Steve's revelation shows her otherwise.
. Although those few days are an entirely different tirade that needs going on. Yes, I remember. Yes, I’m embarrassed. Yes, I’m touched that you stormed the hellicarrier to save me from SHIELD. Yes, I was obsessed with Captain America when I was a kid. My dad helped create you, so it’s only natural. Yes, my dad was an incredibly neglectful asshole who cared more about finding you than he did about caring for his own kid. But I’m not going to go on either of those tirades, you know why?”
"I know, I know. We won't ever let them hurt you ever again," Clint whispers into the dark hair, holding his small friend tightly.
like he's being torn in half, if you prep him right, and use lube, you won't damage him. Check when you're done, though, just to make sure nothing ripped, but the human body is a lot more accommodating than people think it is. And once you've done it a few times, his body will get a lot more use to the intrusion. That doesn't mean you don't have to do the prep, because I have a feeling that'll always be necessary, but mentally he won't worry about tearing anymore. Does that help? Cause you look like you're about to split a seam," Clint comments with a half laugh at the expression on Steve's face.
"You couldn't have known. And you were right not to go. A two man recon team is much safer than three. And just because you're not from this world doesn't mean you can instantly identify ships or beings from others. Keeping you back with Banner was the smart play," she assures him, squeezing his arm gently, "Given the same situation again, I know I would make the same call. So would Steve. And honestly, Tony only asked you to go because alien cultures scare him. They have since New York. You didn't do anything wrong, Thor. This isn't your fault."
“I don’t mind if the team knows. But if it bothers you, I’m sure a well placed word in the right ear would keep Clint silent on the matter. Unless you’re thinking you don’t want to try a relationship…”
She shoves a few agents out of her way as she spies the jet. It lifts off the ground the moment she's inside and takes off, presumably without authorization. She'll get an earful from Fury later, but at the moment she doesn't care. Something has happened at home, and the tone she'd heard in Clint's voice is one she's only heard one other time. After the dust had settled from the battle in New York, she had found him in his room drinking himself into a coma, blaming himself for all the people and agents lost while he was under Loki's control. He sounded the same way then as he did now. Broken.
"Not at the moment. Why? This better not be about my shield again," warns Steve with a suspicious look.
“No, I don’t. But I also know that by the time you actually get around to helping them, they’ll be so fed up with dealing with you, they’ll either scrap the whole project, or decide to figure it out on their own.”
He slips the single finger in and out until he feels the muscle relax around him, and Tony's visibly tight body does the same. Then he adds a second finger, going just as slow, and adding more lube as he goes. Tony tightens back up for a moment as his body acclimates to the intrusion, but it doesn't take him nearly as long to relax this time. Steve repeats the process with the third and then the fourth finger, continuing until Tony is a whimpering mess beneath him, begging for Steve to just fuck him already.
Steve pulls Tony into a hug, silencing his attempts to convince the Captain of the logic behind his request. It’s painfully obvious to Steve that Tony is afraid of being alone, and the look of desperation on his little face nearly breaks Steve’s heart. For a second, he vaguely wonders how he was ever able to say no to the adult Tony, because he knows for a fact that if the tiny one keeps looking at him like that, he’ll never be able to deny him anything. He just hopes it’s not a problem that remains once Tony is an adult again.
“Fury thinks he does. But they…” Steve takes a deep breath and tries to control his anger, “They cornered him in an interrogation room. JARVIS, play back my conversation with Fury.”
The article excerpt is not actually from an article, but rather it's pretty much exactly what my Child Psychiatrist friend (whose patients are primarily victims of abuse/domestic violence, drug addicts trying to get clean, and kids with anger management issues,) told me when I asked him what the number one thing he wished his patient's support networks would do.
When Tony walks back into the lab several hours later, Bruce takes one look at him and chuckles to himself.
“Looks like you guys had a lot of fun,” he comments as he sits and takes the controller Tony hands him.
Steve sits up suddenly, knocking Tony back on the bed, and starts tickling him gently, eliciting squeals of joy from the boy, as he kicks and waves his arms around trying to get away. After a moment, Steve stops, and sets Tony on the floor.
"You didn't inconvenience me, sweetheart," she gives him a small hug and leads him out of the bedroom.
"No," Steve insists, hiding a smile by standing and taking his plate to the sink, "I'm not naming it. End of discussion."
"It didn't... you startled me, that's all. You really... really feel the same way about me?" Tony asks, still not able to believe what he's hearing, shaking his head to try and clear it just incase he's having an extremely vivid dream.
Startled, Steve hugs Tony back and rubs his back in a comforting gesture. He opens his mouth to tell Tony he’ll always come to get him, when the brunette head suddenly shoots up and nearly clocks Steve in the jaw.
“Banner and Strange are both certain the artifact was magical, and Strange is confident he can find a way to reverse it. But they said it’ll take them a few days to figure out how, as the artifact that did this was destroyed when it detonated,” Steve answers, running a hand through his hair as he repeats what Bruce had reported to him just before lunch. He’s barely made it through the first twenty four hours of taking care of tiny Tony, and he’s not sure if he’ll survive for a few more days.
Thor places a hand on top of Natasha's where it rests on his arm, and squeezes it gently in thanks. He reaches out his hands, and Natasha gently hands him the sleeping Steve. They walk into the house, securing the jet in its home in the garage.
"I'm fine. Just fine," answers Tony, running a hand through his hair as all his courage deserts him, "Actually, you know what? It's nothing. Never mind. Forget I was even here."
The two men nod their agreement and quickly situate the mattresses. Natasha helps them with the sheets and blankets, then they go into the living room. As they walk down the hallway, they hear a soft smacking sound. They quicken their pace, but stop dead in their tracks as soon as they enter the room.
"Not really a fan of flowers actually. You know they're dead right? A plant corpse seems like such a strange gift to give someone," Tony responds, leaning into Steve's embrace with a smirk.
"Were they injured in any way?" Fury's outward demeanor seems unruffled by the information that two of his top fighters have been turned into little children, but the entire rest of the team can tell he's worried. They all are.
"What I want from you has no price. Besides, I always wondered what it would be like to be a sugar daddy."
“Alright. Go ahead and get dressed. We can have some breakfast, and then we’ll see if we can get Clint out of bed.
"Will do. And if you need me, or learn anything else new, let me know," Bruce says, already turning back to his work.
"Huh?" Tony spins around in his chair and looks at the doctor, who gives him a smile and an exasperated sigh.
Tony’s explanation sends a shockwave through the room, with Thor tightly gripping the arms of the chair he’s sitting in, denting them, and Bruce clenching his fists so tightly they turn white, his skin starting to turn green. Clint gives Natasha a hopeless look, which she returns.
He steps out of the room, leaving the frightened child alone with one of his agents, hoping he might calm down enough to reason with. Pulling out his phone, he dials Steve’s number. Tony had been looking into an alien artifact when it had apparently exploded, so he’s going to need Banner’s help figuring things out. And in his experience, passing all communication with the Avengers through Steve has proven to be the best way to avoid unnecessary confrontation… and collateral damage.
Once she's collected herself, she opens her eyes and puts a gentle hand on each boy's shoulder, causing them to look up at her.
Tony barely shakes his head, looking around the room in fear. The look breaks everyone’s heart, and they all want nothing more than to hold him close and tell him everything will be alright. But they had seen the flinch when Tasha had tried to touch him, and there is still the strange question roaming around in the backs of their minds, so they smile as kindly as they can at the scared little boy.
“Wait a minute,” Steve stops Tony’s long winded explanation, “You faked being asleep just so you could cuddle with me for a few more hours? And all those times you insisted on going on a mission with me, you complained the entire time about how boring it was, and you didn’t need to be there!”
“Can I… can I sleep with you? I’ll be really quiet, and I won’t touch anything in your room, and I can hide in the closet if those guys try to take me again, and…”
"I'm fine, Sir," Clint assures the director, wrapping a strip of his torn shirt around the four inch slice from the center of his palm to past his wrist, "It's superficial, and it's not my nock hand. It'll be fine. Hurrying might be nice though."
Fury, by nature of his job, is use to explosions. They come with the territory when you’re the Director of SHIELD. He is not, however, use to having them randomly rock his hellicarrier and nearly knock it out of the sky.
"Yes. We can't have any weapons out where they can see or get to them. I don't want them to think we intend to use them as punishment, or to try and use any of them against us."
Normally, when the Avengers are on their way home from a mission, the jet is an extremely quiet place. The types of battles they get called on to fight always leave them drained and exhausted by the time they’re over. This time… is quite a bit different.
"I'll call Strange and Richards," Fury assures her, and she can tell he's upset despite his best attempts to hide it, "You and the rest of the team focus on caring for those boys. Xavier's people can handle the rest for now. You need anything, you call. Have JARVIS send lists of things you need. I'll have them delivered. Keep me updated if anything changes."
“Yes. So, honestly… I’m glad neither of us said anything. If you had… bad things would have happened, and we would have never ended up where we are now. And if I had… well I wouldn’t have. Really kind of thought you still didn’t even like me until you told mini-me I could sleep in your room,” Tony comments, a little under his breath.
Tony stares blankly at Steve for a few long seconds, mouth hanging open slightly in shock. Then his usually brilliantly fast brain catches up to what's happening and he stumbles as he tries to find the right words for to respond to what just happened.
"There is plenty of storage space in the archery range, ma'am. Shall I seal away all weapons currently stored?" JARVIS asks in anticipation of her motives.
Deciding that the shirt is in the way, Steve quickly helps Tony out of it, then looks down at him in the soft light from the lamp, admiring his body. Where Steve is made almost entirely of muscle, Tony is lean and taught. To the untrained eye, his body doesn't look like one of a battle hardened warrior, but Steve's eye is anything by untrained. He watches the way the muscles move under Tony's skin, revealing in the feel of them under his fingers. He traces the scars on Tony's chest, memorizing each one, wondering where they all came from. He knows the ones around the reactor are from when he'd been kidnapped, and he makes a silent vow to make sure that no one is ever able to hurt Tony that way again.
"No. I'm not seeing anyone at the moment. Although not for lack of trying on Natasha's part. She seems to think every available SHIELD agent is viable dating material. Is my lack of a personal life the problem that has you so worked up?"
"Really? You think the straight-arrow, all-American boy from the forties is going to just take my confession in stride and be okay with it? Not a snowballs chance."
"Young Tony temporarily disabled my security features from the panel in his room. When I came back online they were gone."
Steve blushes and ducks his head a little, embarrassed. The Tony grabs the sides of his face and kisses him again, much more passionately this time, and Steve grips his waist, pulling Tony tight against him. They quickly shed each other's clothes and lay on the bed, breaking their kiss so they can just look at each other for a while. Steve runs his hands along Tony's arms and chest, drinking in the sight of Tony arching into each touch, and loving the small little mewls of pleasure that escape his lips. Tony's eyes rove the length of Steve's gloriously naked body, gulping audibly when he sees Steve's cock, which is just as huge was it was the first time he'd seen it, and it's not even fully hard yet. Steve follows his gaze and lays a hand on Tony's shoulder.
Natasha quickly collects the required blood samples, and the boys don't so much as flinch when she sticks them with the needle. Thor pulls Mjolnir from the vault and they both leave in short order.
Steve makes them toast and scrambled eggs for breakfast, stopping Tony when he’s finished and goes to wake Clint.
“No. That would have been terrifying,” Tony shudders a bit, and Steve pulls him closer, “I mean, when I woke up as normal sized me and remembered it. You should have told me no. Mini-me expected you to say no. But you didn’t. You let me share your room, and run around in clothes with your shield printed on them. You cared about me. And you didn’t have to. You could have left me with SHIELD. They would have called in Banner, who would have called in Strange, who I now probably owe a favor to, goody, and I would have been put back to normal. But you didn’t. And that… I don’t actually have words for how much that means to me,” Steve opens his mouth to say something, but Tony quickly covers it, not finished, “I realize you probably would have done the same if any of the other members of the team had been hit, but that’s sort of my point. The fact that you saw me as a member of the team… made me realize how stupid I’d been, denying my feelings. I had already told myself I was going to tell you soon when you started talking. It might not have been for a few week, but I was going to tell you.”
"Hey," Steve responds, putting down his book and patting the arm of the chair he's sitting in. Tony crosses and sit on it, leaning into Steve's shoulder, as he has a thousand times, though it has more meaning now than it did before. "How are you feeling?"
Turning on his heel, Tony storms out of the mansion, leaving a very lost Captain standing confused in the middle of the living room.
Tony glares at him for a moment, looking for the lie. Apparently not finding one, he slowly scoots over towards Steve.
"I shall place my hammer in the locked vault in my room. It may be best to place the good Captain's shield there as well."
“Afraid I don’t have time for jokes Captain. The artifact Stark was researching detonated in the lab, and it had some… surprising side effects.” Fury informs, a bit harsher than he intended.
. And that’s not something he’s going to tolerate from anyone, not even SHIELD, no matter what strange phenomenon has turned his teammate into a four year old.
"No! No," Tony says vehemently, "That's... not what I want. But I think we might need to... wait to... until I can prepare myself a little better. Besides, I don't think we have any lube anyway."
“Clint! You gotta do the apple trick!” Tony insists, grabbing Clint’s face between his hands and leaning in until his nose is almost touching Hawkeye’s.
After a brief moment Tony nods shortly and Steve releases his arm. He turns and walks up the stairs to his room and enters, Steve following right behind him. Tony shuts the door once they're both inside and pours himself a few fingers of much needed scotch. He offers a glass to Steve, but the super soldier turns it down, as expected. Downing the stabilizing agent in a few quick swallows, Tony then stands for a few more moments in silence, trying to figure out how best to tell the man what he needs to say.
Tony shrinks a little further into himself at the question, and searches her face, as though looking for the trick. It’s a very disconcerting look from such a young face.
"Everything kind of feels small, like I'm bigger than I'm suppose to be, but Bruce thinks that should wear off in the next day or so," Tony answers with a sigh, "Speaking of things that are bigger than they're supposed to be..."
He is sitting with his back against the far wall, knees pulled up to his chest, shoulders shaking slightly as he rocks back and forth. She rushes to him and takes one of his wrists, checking his pulse. His heart rate is a bit fast, but well within normal. He looks up at her when she touches him and there are tear streaks down his face. She lays a palm on his cheek, searching his eyes for the cause of his distress.
“Hey there, Tony,” Natasha says gently, helping him sit up on her lap, “We’re home now. Are you hungry? Would you like something to eat?”
When Steve comes into the living room in his full Cap gear, minus the helmet, and carrying his shield, the other four Avengers immediately stop watching their movie and give him their full attention.
"But we did something bad. We offended Master Clint!" Tony protests, his eyes darting between the three of them.
“I haven’t even asked you a question yet!” Tony counters, frustrated, sitting on the arm of the chair Steve’s sitting in.
"JARVIS, do we have enough space in the locker rooms to store all our weapons?" Natasha asks the AI softly, earning a strange look from both Clint and Thor.
"Well," Steve starts, looking down at himself with a shy grin, "My muscles weren't the only things that grew with the serum," he looks back up at Tony, "I guess... if you want... I could be the one on the bottom... so to speak...?"
“I noticed this morning that the string catches a bit when you draw it all the way back. And I was thinking about how I could fix it. I think I have an idea, and I thought I’d try it out and see if it works,” Tony explains, pulling yet another piece of the bow apart.
“Why don’t you lay down and rest for a little while. It’s been a long day,” Steve stands and carries Tony over to his large bed.
Tony sighs and retreats into his thoughts. After several minutes without response, Bruce gets up and returns to his work with a brief 'At least think about it' in parting. And he does. He thinks about it a lot. There's a lot to lose if Steve rejects him. Their friendship is tenuous at best, and has always been rocky. Losing that would be... unbearable. But at the same time... there's so much that
"And both of you," Clint interrupts before the conversation can go any farther, "Both of you need to respect that while I'm more than happy to offer advice, I am
She pulls both boys into a hug, clutching them tightly despite the way their bodies stiffen in her arms. They don't hug her back, but after a few seconds they relax slightly, accepting the contact. She smiles slightly to herself. She knows they've still got a long way to go, and that there will be far more unsettling scenes to come, but she thinks of the confused look on Steve's face when someone makes a pop culture reference he doesn't understand, and the way Tony's eyes light up when he has a new idea for his suit, and she makes a silent promise that she will do whatever it takes to get her friends back, whole and complete.
“The apple trick! Like William Tell. Where you shoot the apple off the person’s head,” Tony explains in an almost exasperated tone that sounds strange coming from a four year old, “You said you can hit anything! Will you show me the apple trick?”
The walk back to the landing dock is just as uneventful as their walk in. Tony clings tightly to Steve’s neck, his face buried in the Captain’s shirt. Steve’s arm supports him from underneath, the other holding the shield in front of him, protecting the boy in his arms. Clint and Tasha flank him, glaring daggers at anyone and everyone until they exit the carrier and see Thor and Bruce standing next to the jet. Clint runs forward to get the jet ready for take off, while Steve hands his shield to Tasha and she goes to stow it away next to the pilot’s seat.
The both fall bonelessly to the bed, Steve being careful not to land on Tony, and they curl up together, ignoring the mess they've made of the bed. Steve tosses a blanket over them and softly kisses the top of Tony's head.
Clint winces at her statement but can't argue. He's taken tiny cat naps here and there, but has spent most of his time either in the gym or on the roof staring out into the darkness.
Natasha closes her eyes against the anger swelling inside of her, and feels the air shift as Clint turns and leaves the room, unable to handle the situation. She understands how he feels. She's been hoping against hope that she'll wake up soon and this nightmare will be over.
Thankfully, both boys remain in their room that night, though they do end up both sleeping in the bottom bunk together. After breakfast, they sit the boys on the couch to watch a movie, (JARVIS chooses "Brave" this time,) and the team convenes in the gym for a meeting.
She heads for the gym while Thor takes the two boys in hand and leads them into the kitchen. Clint is standing in front of the adult Steve's punching bag going to town on it, wailing away in anger. Instead of interrupting him immediately, she takes a seat on the weight bench and waits for him to calm down enough to talk to her. He senses her presence, but doesn't turn to look at her. After a few more minutes of furious punching, he stops and steadies the bag.
Steve looks at Tony for reassurance, and the adults can see Tony move his hand under the table to hold Steve's.
go on a tirade about boundaries, and team fraternization, and about how I’m not gay, and about how creepy it is that you realized all this while I was
Tony gives him a grin that could light the entire state of New York. He runs a hand through his tousled hair and gently fingers the bruise that's peaking out from the collar of his shirt.
Natasha stands and gives them both a kiss on the top of the head, then ushers them into the kitchen to have them help her make some dinner. It's a simple meal consisting of a prepackaged frozen stir-fry and some boil in bag rice, but it suffices, and the boys are more than happy to help clean up when they're finished eating.
Steve snorts at Clint's remarks, which he assumes are paraphrased, because even though Tony has a nearly eidetic memory, he still likes to shorten things when they shouldn't be and elaborate when he doesn't need to. Steve thinks it's one of his more endearing traits, though it can get a bit tiresome during battle, but he thinks those days are long over.
Tony is sitting at the kitchen table, his tool box sitting open next to him. Clint’s bow (which he had left there when he’d volunteered to stay with Tony,) is laying in pieces all over the table’s surface. When Tony see’s Clint he smiles broadly.
The sensation brings him to full wakefulness and he looks down his body to find, not Natasha as he was expecting, but Steve and Tony, holding his hard cock. Steve smiles and leans back down to lick him again, but is stopped suddenly when Clint pushes them off of him and vaults over the back of the couch slamming into the wall in his haste to get away.
At first, Tony sits quietly and patiently while Bruce tends to his injuries, although he reaches for Steve’s hand when Banner takes a blood sample. He answers the questions about his name and birthday, and what the last thing he remembers before being kidnapped was. Much to Bruce’s dismay, his miniaturized friend doesn’t have much to offer in the way of information. And although Tony’s intellect is still in tact, he only has the knowledge he’d had when he was four the first time. None of his adult skills and smarts are present. It’s a bit disheartening, as Bruce isn’t sure he’s up to the task of solving this on his own, and SHIELD is now well out of the question, but he is determined not to let his friend, or his team, down.
Steve’s chest rumbles as he laughs at the memory, and Tony feels warmth starting to pool in his groin at both the sound, and the sensation of Steve beneath him. Situated as they are, Steve can’t help but notice. He clears his throat suddenly, trying not to shift and make Tony’s problem worse.
"What's wrong?" Natasha asks, worried that there was something else about what happened that he wasn't able to share.
explode, it's made out of vibranium, not tissue paper. It'd probably be the only thing that survived the explosion."
"I can't believe you went to the sex store without me!" Tony cries in shock, "Strike that. I can't believe you went to the sex store!"
“I couldn’t reach any of the ones on the wall, so I brought you this one,” Tony says by way of explanation, then turns to head into the kitchen, but Steve picks him up before he gets very far, “There were some apples on the counter. I saw them when we made pancakes. We’ll need them for the apple trick,” Tony squirms in Steve’s arms for a moment, trying to get down and get the required apples.
Shocked by the honest admission, and the heartfelt emotion in Thor's words, Steve and Tony are speechless for a moment. Then Steve raises his head and looks at them.
Ever mindful of his creator’s wants and needs, JARVIS had ordered ten bushels of apples from the local farmer’s market that are delivered just as Clint’s pouring his second cup of coffee.
"I'm afraid so," Steve retorts, and the conversation quickly devolves into a make-out session, with Tony grinding his rapidly hardening erection into Steve's own. After several minutes, Steve puts his hands on Tony's shoulders and the brunette pulls back. "We need to talk, Tony. I need to tell you what Clint's advice was, so we're on the same page. I don't want to go any further if you're still nervous. I won't push you into this."
of lube, prep up to four fingers, and then push past the initial pain. Tony strikes me as the kind of guy that would enjoy some pain during sex, and even though he'll probably
Steve freezes for a moment at the words, trying not to let his shock show on his face. He forces himself to recover quickly, and leans down to give the boy a quick kiss on the forehead.
"First of all it's a shield. It's used for protection," starts Steve, pulling his plate out of Tony's reach.
"The way they talk. I suppose some of it might be the training they under went, but their minds seem much more mature than those of four year olds," she says. She looks at the security feed of the living room and sighs sadly when the boys slide off the couch where Clint put them and kneel back on the floor. "If it was just Tony I would chalk it up to his natural genius, but Steve seems more mature as well. Maybe their minds didn't regress as far as their bodies did?"
“Let me go!” a small child that looks disturbingly like Tony Stark screams at Fury when he enters the interrogation room he’d been directed to after he’d checked on the damage in research.
"I don't know, brother. But we had to get out of there," Tony answers readjusting the bag on his back, "What we did was wrong, remember?"
“Did you have a good run? Can I go with you next time? Clint told me he shoots a bow just like Robin Hood! And that some of his arrows even
“Because I feel the same way. Have for awhile. First time I saw you in that spangly outfit of yours, thought my heart was going to beat right out of my chest. I shrugged it off as my childhood hero worship rearing its ugly head. Then I saw you come out of the shower one time, towel wrapped around your hips, water dripping down that perfect body of yours… and it wasn’t my chest that felt too tight that time. So while I
Steve lays out all of the pie ingredients on the counter, and very carefully instructs Tony on how to use the apple corer to cut and core the apples. He lets Tony help him mix the spices together, and has to keep himself from laughing when Tony has a sneezing fit because he dumped the cinnamon in too quickly. They use a cookie cutter in the shape of the Captain’s shield (a gag gift from Tony himself a few weeks after New York) to make the design in one of the pies, and a heart for the other. While the pies cook, Steve puts on Finding Nemo, and they cuddle up on the couch to watch the movie.
"That's not going to happen. The worst that will happen is he says no. Probably 'I appreciate the compliment, but I'll have to decline.' Or something along those lines. He's too nice to stop speaking to you or kick you off the team. Talk to him," Bruce urges, placing his hand on Tony's arm and squeezing slightly in encouragement.
The Red Room trained Natasha to be emotionless, to deal with every situation with the same impartial cool resolve. But the more she finds out about what Tony and Steve were 'trained' to do and be, the more her own training fails her. Tamping down firmly on her tears, she picks up the toys and sets them in front of the two boys.
Exhausted, and having made no headway on a course of action, the team decides to call it a night and table the discussion until morning. Natasha goes back to reading her book, Clint’s feet in her lap as he spreads out on the couch, while Steve opens a book of his own and Thor puts on one of the many action movies he’s been working his way through almost systematically. As the movie passes the halfway point, (Thor is mumbling under his breath at the stupidity of the battle strategy the heroes are using, Steve’s eyes are beginning to droop and he catches himself reading the same paragraph for the third time, Clint is asleep and Tasha is starting to look a little tired herself,) they hear tiny running footsteps coming down the hall, just before Tony sprints into the living room at full speed. Before any of them can react, the boy barrels towards the couch.
Steve allows himself a few moments to brood about his team making bets on his love life, before straightening and moving on to the next item on his 'talk to Clint about this' agenda. And the second topic is even harder to broach than the first. But with how easily Clint had accepted the news of Steve and Tony finally being together, (which he was honestly more concerned about the 'being teammates' part of the equation than the 'being with another man' part, as Clint himself is dating not only Natasha, but Phil Coulson as well, which is the reason Steve has decided to go to the archer for advice,) he figures he might as well go for broke, and takes another deep breath to steel himself.
"Oh my God! You too?! I am not the Mata Hari of gay sex! I already had this conversation once with Steve. Go talk to him. Communication is the foundation of a healthy relationship. I am not going to be you guys' sex therapist. Go! Shoo!" Clint waves at him to go away, and Tony blushes even further as he stands and Clint goes back to his book. Just as he reaches the door, Clint speaks again, "There's nothing to be afraid of, Tony. If you're careful, and safe, he won't break you. You'll be fine."
"No. I'm going," Natasha says firmly, her voice broking no argument, "You haven't slept since we brought them home and are in no state to be flying the jet."
"Fear maybe?" Natasha suggests, hands typing away at the large portable table top computer she'd pulled from Tony's office, "They were really scared when we talked to them," she makes a few more adjustments to the search parameters, and lets the algorithm do its work, "What ever drug they were dosed with might have worn off and they decided to make a run for it while our guard was down."
Tony flings his arms around the archer’s neck and cries quietly for a moment. Clint lets him, petting his hair and whispering soothing words to try and calm him. After a moment, Tony pulls away and lets Clint take his hand and lead him inside.
As he stands there, he hears a distinctive growling sound coming from the living room, and sees Tony curl around himself trying to stop the noise. Steve's stomach echoes the sentiment. Clint curses himself for not watching them more closely, as they probably didn't eat much for breakfast. Checking his watch, Clint decides it's the perfect time for lunch.
"She was lying!" Tony yells at his small blonde companion, "Don't you see that? They're just saying those things to earn our trust. We mean nothing to them! And as soon as we believe them, they'll hurt us, just like the others did. We're better off on our own, where no one can hurt us ever again."
"Tony. He's not as straight laced as you think. Give him a chance. What's the worst that could happen?"
"The point of this hammer is to gently combine two pieces of wood so they don't fall apart, not smash the bed into tiny pieces Thor. Besides, you're stronger so it makes more sense for you to hold the frame up instead of me," Clint counters, grunting slightly as he hammers in another nail.
"JARVIS," she says into her com, "Get the jet started and get us in the air as soon as I'm on board."
"Good idea. JARVIS, we need clothes and toys for the boys. And anything else you can think of that might help us... deal with this," she waves her hands vaguely in the direction of the living room and the problems associated with trying to help two abused boys. Let alone two abused boys who used to be their friends.
He turns to leave, but a hand on his arm stops him abruptly, the force of the grip startling him slightly.
Clint stares at him in shock for a full minute before setting his bow and quiver on the table and sitting on the bench next to Steve.
“We go in, we get Stark, we get out. If we meet resistance, we fight, but try not to kill anyone. I don’t
“He’s not actually being hurt, Rogers. One of my agents is just trying to get him to medical…” Fury stops mid-sentence when he hears a distinctive ‘click’ on the other end. He pulls his phone away from his ear and stares at it for a moment in surprise. There are very few people in the world with the balls and lack of self-preservation to hang up on Nick Fury, and he had honestly never thought Steve was the type of person who ever
“Why not? I’ve seen you hit smaller targets from much farther away. And some of those shots nearly missed one of the team,” Steve inquires, eyebrows raised at Clint’s statement.
"JARVIS," Natasha says, terror filling her voice, "Find them. I don't care how many laws you have to break. Find them."
“I will in a bit. I need to get some work done first. But I promise I’ll be right here when you wake up in the morning, alright?”
Tony rips his arm from Steve’s grasp, startling the Captain. His voice is nearly a whisper when he speaks.
Tony runs over to where Steve is standing, and Clint nocks an arrow. Once Natasha has the apple balanced and is holding still, he lets the arrow fly, and it hits the apple dead center, chunks flying in every direction. Tony whoops with joy and bounces up and down, tugging on Steve’s shirt.
"I'm not going to give up on them," he counters hotly, "I just can't... if we'd gotten to them sooner, hadn't split up the team, waited for SHIELD back up. I just keep running all the what ifs in my head and hoping this is some sort of demented nightmare."
He turns in her arms and holds her tightly. They've never been a conventional couple. Their relationship has stayed mostly in the bedroom, but these are trying circumstances and they both need the physical comfort.
"Clint, I don't know how to handle this. I don't know what to say or what to do to make this better, make this right. I barely had a clue when we were just dealing with physical abuse!"
Giving Tony a bath very quickly rockets to the top of Steve’s list of the hardest things he’s ever done. And he once took on an entire Hydra base by himself with nothing more than his shield. He has to refill the tub because the water is apparently ‘boiling,’ ends up chasing the naked boy out into the living room
"Sounds fantastic," Natasha agrees, smiling when the boys gravitate towards each other, "I'll go get Clint and let him know."
Thank you so much for reading! I really hope you enjoyed it! As always, leave me a comment and let me know what you thought!
“And when you’re done shooting apples, we can make an apple pie out of what ever’s left,” Steve suggests, taking Tony back into his arms.
"Tony, little one, why were you striking your brother?" He keeps his tone soft and calm, not wishing to frighten either boy.
Thor arrives mere seconds later, Mjolnir at the ready, but he drops it immediately when he sees the scene before him. Clint is still sitting against the wall rocking back and forth slightly, and Natasha has managed to put five holes into the wall, her hands bleeding from the effort. He goes to her and puts a hand on her shoulder, accepting her into his arms when she turns and buries her head in his chest, tears running down her face. Her voice is quiet and stilted as she tells him what the boys did and what they had been forced to learn to do. He pulls her closer and slowly lowers them both  to the floor, his own tears wetting her hair, and the room is filled with the sound of quiet sobs as all three of them silently fall to pieces.
“No, you said morning! The sun is coming up!” Tony insists, pushing on Steve’s shoulder again. Steve fakes a snore and half way rolls on top of the boy. Tony struggles and wiggles his way out from under the Captain, sitting on his back when Steve finishes rolling onto his stomach. “You gotta get up! You said we could see the apple trick and make pie!” Tony bounces up and down on Steve’s waist, continuing to push on his shoulders.
“Oh. Okay,” Tony’s face immediately falls and he stares down at his feet where they dangle off the edge of the seat. “Will you maybe come visit me sometime? You don’t have to though. You guys have to fight the bad guys, so you’ll probably be too busy.”
“Steeeeeeeeeeve! You came back!” Tony shouts, dropping his controller and practically launching himself at the Captain, “Guess what we did? We watched a movie, and then we fixed Clint’s bow cause it was kind of broken, and then I put the other one back together caused I got them mixed up and took the wrong one apart. But Clint wasn’t mad, and he said I could live with you guy forever and ever! Then we played this fun racing game where you throw turtles at people, and we’re tied for first place! Come play with us! Come play!!” Tony insists, pulling on Steve’s hand.
“That’s right. After I came back, I became a part of a new team. We help keep the world safe from the bad guys.”
“I’m sorry, Clint. I didn’t mean to scare you. I won’t jump on you when you’re sleeping anymore,” Tony promises, giving Clint a small kiss on the cheek, “Will you still show me the apple trick?”
“I wan’t really sleepy, so I started reading one of the books you got me, and it had a story about William Tell and how he saved his son by shooting an apple off his head, and it sounded really cool, so I wanted Clint to show me cause he said he could shoot anything and that he never misses,” Tony explains almost sheepishly, wringing his hands.
“And you aren’t our trainers?” Tony asks again, getting nods of negation in answer, “Are you our owners? Is that why you gave us new names?”
The boys give each other identical looks of worry, but both nod when they see no anger in Clint's face.
"Three fingers is still plenty of preparation!" insists Tony, glaring slightly at Steve, "It's not like I'm saying not to prepare at all. I just... like the burn... that's all."
“Wait, what? Why me? I can’t cook!” Clint protests, but lets himself be dragged into the kitchen anyway.
“Well, that’s…” Tony’s voice hitches a bit when Steve’s hand keep sliding down, “That’s good then. Do you want to… now?” Tony asks, finally giving in and arching his back as Steve’s hand finally slides over his bare ass, and down to his thigh.
"We have to tell them what they did was wrong, but not because they are bad, but because they were taught bad things by evil people. That's the only thing I can think of," Natasha says, sounding unconvinced of her own plan.
“There’s no need for that, Captain. My agents are the best. They’ll talk him around. Then we can set up a room for him while we try and figure out what happened. I need you to contact Banner and have him come up. We’ll need his help to…”
"Would you prefer something different?" Natasha asks softly, "I can have JARVIS order anything you'd like."
Because they work with a covert shadowy government organization that frequently doesn’t tell them everything, Tony had programmed JARVIS to record any incoming or outgoing calls to SHIELD, encrypted or not. The AI starts the play back immediately. When he hears the small voice calling out for help again, Steve grips his seat so tightly it dents. When the recording is finished playing, Clint turns back to the controls without a word, and pushes the jet to the limits of its acceleration abilities. Bruce takes deep, measured breaths, his skin tinged faintly green, while Thor glares angrily at his hammer, blue streaks dancing around its edges. Natasha pulls out her guns and checks them, flipping off the safeties and making sure they all have a round chambered.
Tony looks up at him from the screen where he's been watching Steve and Clint train on the security footage and glares.
your sex therapist! There are plenty of actual ones you can go to. Stop interrupting my practice time."
"I can't believe this!" Steve says, collapsing back on the bench, and banging his head back against the wall, "I've been trying to figure out how to tell the team all morning, and now I find out they already
“I’m sorry! I thought they were the same bow! I didn’t mean to destroy it. I’ll put it back together, and it’ll work perfect! I was just trying to help, cause everyone’s been so nice to me, and you saved me from the bad guys on that flying ship, so I wanted to show you how happy I am that you let me stay with you, and I didn’t mean to break anything! Please don’t be mad! I don’t want to go back home! I want to stay here with you and Tasha and Thor and S-steve! Nobody will talk to me at my house, but you guys talk to me all the time, and you play with me, and Steve makes me food, and lets me sleep in his room, and you don’t make me sit in the corner cause I don’t know the answer to something yet, and I’m really sorry! I won’t do it ever, ever again! Please don’t make me leave!”
Thankfully, no one on the SHIELD hellicarrier is brave enough, (or suicidal enough,) to take on the team of angry Avengers. Most of them simply back up against the nearest wall and raise their hands to show they aren’t a threat. The team of three makes their way through the ship until they reach the interrogation rooms. Fury meets them outside one of the doors.
He creeps into his room and shucks off his outer layer of clothing, slipping into his pajama pants and a sleep shirt. He gently helps the half-asleep Tony out of his pajamas and into on of the Captain’s shirts, not wanting him to wake up being strangled by too small of clothing. Then he slips under the covers and pulls the boy close, pressing several kisses to the top of his head.
"I talked to Clint this morning," Steve interrupts suddenly, "I hope that doesn't upset you. He was the only person I could think of to ask about what to do as he's... currently sleeping with another man, though I doubt he and Phil have the same problem. Anyway, he gave me some advice on what we can do to make it as easy and as comfortable for you as possible. If you still want to, that is."
“No, Tony. Remember what I said last night?” Steve asks, picking Tony up, “You can’t wake Clint up by jumping on him. He has a very dangerous skill set, and if you surprise him, he might hurt you on accident. I’ll wake him up first, then you can jump on him.”
The question tears at their hearts and Clint pulls Steve a little closer. Natasha lays a hand on the side of Tony's face.
"I don't think we have to do anything special. We just need to remember that when we're working, the job comes first and we can't prioritize each other just because we're together." Steve smiles and goes over to Tony, pulling him in for a hug and a quick kiss. "I want to make it work. I don't just like you Tony."
"No. Well, yes. I mean, not really but it's relevant," Tony stumbles through his own response, resolutely
Noticing that it's the archer's hand that is bleeding, Fury stops for a moment and gives him a stern look.
“I’m sorry! I just wanted to look at it. I won’t do it again! I promise! Please don’t kick me out!” Tony blurts out quickly, tears starting to run down his cheeks.
"I... it's..." Steve starts, trying to both find the words and the courage to say them, "Tony and I have... decided to... start a relationship," he says finally.
“You really are just a giant teddy bear full of sap and mush, aren’t you?” Tony asks suddenly, causing Steve to flinch and yank his hands away from the man.
"Hey," Tony says when he finds Steve in his room later that day, after gathering his courage for a few more hours.
"Did he then?" Steve chuckles, "That's good. I'm certain I would die from the embarrassment if I had to talk to him about this again. They knew, by the way, about us liking each other. Apparently we were the only ones who
They carry the boxes down to the shooting range, and while Clint picks out a bow from the wall, Tony picks out several apples and runs to the far wall, placing one on his head.
“The idea that… you could… well of you… of you holding me down… while we… do… things…” Tony gasps out, his body aching to be touched, “I know you won’t… you know…
“So? You’re better than any of those hacks any day. And you know I don’t want anything to do with their research. Come with me, get angry, get me out of this!” Tony whines.
"We are, but that's not what I mean. We adopt them so to speak. Treat them like we would if they were our own kids. Try to undo the damage the aliens did." She turns and looks at Bruce meaningfully. "I think you should join Richards and Strange on the hellicarrier. You're a ticking time bomb down here. Go and help them find a way to turn them back. We'll handle taking care of them in the mean time."
After a moment of trying to get her emotions under control and failing, she tells Tony and Steve to go to their room, an order they immediately obey. The rational part of her mind tells her she should comfort them, should hold them close and tell them everything is going to be okay, but her emotions have a much stronger hold on her, and she knows there will only be regret later if they stay. Mind numb with pain, she stands and goes to the nearest wall, punching a hole right through it.
this. Just as much as you do. But you're right. I am still nervous, though Clint told me I shouldn't be. What all did he tell you?"
“Okay. I assume you mean you would have run away from the conversation and gone even further into your denial?” Steve asks, hoping his contextual assumption is correct.
They both nod furiously, though their confusion is still evident on their faces. They both turn to Clint and bow their heads solemnly.
Steve takes Tony by the hand and heads for the roof, glancing back to make sure Clint is following them. He waves to Tony from the open back door until Natasha takes off. Once the team is gone, Clint crouches next to Tony, who is wiping away tears from his cheek.
“Why don’t we get you to the jet, and then we’ll answer all your questions, alright?” Tasha interjects, glancing towards the door.
"Right away ma'am. However, I feel I should warn you, Dr. Banner's heart rate is quite elevated. Should I prepare counter measures incase of an incident?"
“As you all probably know,” Steve starts, “SHIELD called Tony in this morning to look at an alien artifact they’d recovered and see if there was any potential for weaponization. It apparently detonated while Stark was working on it. Fury doesn’t think he’s badly hurt, but they haven’t been able to do a medical exam because it… well… it turned Tony into a four year old. A very scared four year old, who doesn’t know who anyone is or where he is, and thinks he’s been kidnapped.”
There's a moment of silence which has seemed to follow every question or revelation from the two boys, but the adults are getting better at recovering from the shock of their tiny friend's words.
"They were running recon on that strange alien ship that appeared out of nowhere, and their coms went dead. We ran in, got them, and ran out," Hawkeye explains, running a bleeding hand through his hair, "And
They nod and obediently go and kneel in front of the couch facing the television. JARVIS immediately starts up "Meet the Robinson's" and Natasha is pleased with the choice. She doesn't try and convince them to actually sit on the couch, that's a battle for a later day. Knowing they'll stay where they are, she heads to the guest room.
They don't respond to her offers, simply continue sitting in their kneeling 'waiting' position, staring at the floor. She sighs soundlessly and gently places a hand on each of their heads.
Startled by Steve's sudden outburst, Tony doesn't know what to say for a moment. He's immensely touched that the shy and reserved Captain put himself through the harrowing experience of asking Clint for advice on sex. He leans in and kisses Steve soundly for a moment, reveling in the fact that he
Tony gasps for an exceptionally long time, awe and wonder in his eyes. Steve doesn’t know what to say so he just smiles at the boy.
"Just, give me a second," Tony says, pulling away from Steve and pacing around the room, "I wasn't actually prepared for this response."
"My four year old teammates just tried to blow me in thanks for making them a grilled cheese sandwich and letting them do the dishes. I'm fucking fantastic, thanks," he snaps at her, kicking the back of the couch he's been pacing behind.
"Because you haven't given us any orders," Tony explains quietly, a tear rolling down his face, "I know we're little and we don't have much training, but we'll try really hard and we can do a lot of things. Are you going to sell us? Is that why you're being nice? To test our training?"
Clint has no response to Steve’s assessment of the situation, as it’s correct, and scowls at the flour covered kitchen. As Steve goes to leave the room with Tony, he stops at the table and leans down to whisper to Natasha.
He starts to shake his head then stops, but doesn't nod either. His blue gray eyes are pleading as he looks up at her.
"Oh. Hello, Tony. I didn't expect to see you again until dinner. How goes the work on Natasha's bites?" Steve asks, tossing his towel into the bucket by the door.
“Only forty seven days. We’re not very good yet,” his head jerks up suddenly and he looks at Clint earnestly, “But we’ll try really hard, I promise! We learn really fast! And my brother is working really hard on not coughing so much. He’s getting better! We’ll be really good and do everything you say!”
the bow he’d been using on the apples earlier. They look deceptively similar, but one is for practice, while the other is for combat. Clint drops into one of the kitchen chairs, folding his arms on top of the table and letting his head drop onto them.
"Why don't you two sit on the couch and I'll have JARVIS start a movie for you. I'm going to go check on Clint and Thor. They're setting up your bedroom."
“You came! I just said that to scare those bad guys, but you actually came!! My dad found you, and you actually came!” Tony throws his arms around Steve’s neck and hugs him tightly.
"We won't. And if something happens, just call me and I'll head back immediately," Natasha promises him.
She smiles when she enters and sees her two friends at work. Thor is holding up the entire frame work while Clint goes around and nails the pieces together.
“Cool!” Tony responds, looking at Thor and grinning widely when the demigod tosses the hammer into the air and then catches it deftly.
"Bullshit," Tony says, sneaking another chip when Steve flinches slightly at the curse word, "Everyone else's weapon has a name. Tasha calls her spider bites 'Widow Makers,' Coulson named that giant gun he used on Loki 'Retribution,' 'The Incredible Hulk' is obviously Bruce's weapon, all my suits are named 'Mark' something, Clint's bow is named 'Charlotte' after some French assassin or some such whatever, and Thor's hammer has an unpronounceable name, 'Mafudgenick' or something. Your shield needs a name too."
Realizing that she won't be able to get any answers out of him until she can take the time to calm him down, she turns to the two boys who haven't moved at all since she came through the door. She is terrified to find out what they might have said or done that would shake Clint so badly, and the answer dances in the back of her mind but she can't dare to think it. She goes and kneels in front of them, gently urging them to look at her.
By the time Tony is finally clean and wrapped in one of Steve’s soft fluffy blue towels, Natasha has returned from the store with clothing for the boy. Steve groans internally when he opens the bags she hands him, and briefly wonders if he can get away with letting Tony run around in oversized tee-shirts until Bruce can find a way to make him an adult again. The bags are filled with tee-shirts, underwear, socks, pajamas… all Captain America themed. Tony is thrilled and wants to immediately try everything on, while Steve is just grateful the jeans are at least normal, and vows to never send Natasha to the store again as long as he lives. Steve quickly changes out of his soaked clothes and follows Tony into the kitchen, which is thankfully no longer covered in flour. He scowls at Natasha, but she just grins at him in response.
Clint nods, and Natasha immediately goes over to where Tony is still standing against the back wall. She kneels in front of him, taking one of his small hands in hers.
"He's himself again," Steve informs Clint in a brusk voice, "And he remembers everything that happened while he was young, so he might be a little distant for a few days. Try not to tease him too much."
"Tony, I'm not making fun of you. I like you too. I have for a while. But I didn't say anything because I thought you and Pepper were together. Then, when I found out you weren't, I didn't know
“As for the secret base, we do have one, of sorts, and you’ll probably get to see it at some point, but for now we’re going to take you home.”
Tony opens the indicated door and looks inside. Steve notices immediately that the boy’s excitement is gone, and kneels by his side, putting a hand on his shoulder worriedly.
"We'll keep you apprised of how things are going down here, and if we get any new information from them," Natasha promises.
"You feeling alright there, Cap?" Clint asks him suddenly as he looses his next arrow, "You look like an over ripe tomato. Something you want to talk about?"
“It had its moments,” Clint agrees, starting the race over and adding a tally slot for Steve, and then others for Natasha and Thor when they grab controllers as well. Tony ends up winning the little spur of the moment racing tournament, to exactly no one’s surprise. Steve caves to Tony’s desire to have pizza for dinner, and they each make their own individual pizzas, choosing their own toppings. By the time dinner is over, it’s almost time for bed. Steve gives Tony a bath, with much less muss and fuss this time, and reads him a few books before they turn in for the night. Bruce greets him when he returns to the living room, a large smile on his face.
Steve pulls back the covers and slides in-between the sheets, smiling when Tony curls up against him and falls asleep almost immediately. He pets the boy’s hair softly, silently promising that no matter what happens, he’ll keep his friend safe.
“No, Tony. I’m not mad,” Steve assures him with a smile, then changes the subject, “How are you feeling? Do you hurt any where?”
"It's going really well!" Tony tells the man sitting in the chair across from him, holding Steve's hand tightly and smiling at his lover, "There's still some pain, but the little toy is helping, and we got some others things that are making it a lot easier."
“I’m not going to help you level another SHIELD facility just because you don’t want to deal with their scientists for a few hours. And if you really don’t want to help them, don’t go. I’ve seen you talk your way out of far more dangerous and unpleasant situations than this. You’ll be fine.” Bruce chuckles softly under his breath while he scribbles an idea down in a notebook on his desk.
Fury glares at Clint, but it doesn't do much good since it's the same look he has no matter what the situation. Opting to simply ignore the archer instead of say something, Fury turns back to Banner.
"Hill, pull our people out of that ship immediately. Set up a biohazard zone around it. No one in or out," Fury orders without any further questioning. He trusts Natasha and the tone in her voice worries him. "What happened to them, Romanoff?"
"It's slow going. We still haven't been able to convince them they aren't slaves. You would think they'd understand it after being told forty or fifty different times."
"He's disgusted by me and never speaks to me again. He kicks me off the team and I lose the only family I've ever had," Tony answers glumly, dropping his face into his hands.
"Is he back to normal? Or is he still a kid?" Clint asks, almost hoping Tony is still a child so they can have more fun.
"Tony," Natasha starts, going around the boy to kneel in front of him with Thor, "I know those trainers punished you for everything, but they were bad men. Steve has a sickness. He can't control it and he needs to be treated, not punished. You can come and interrupt us any time. Even if you just want to say hello. You
“We need clothes for Tony. He can’t go around in giant tee-shirts forever. Could you run to the store and get a few things?”
"I was. But just because I was raised a certain way, doesn't mean it's the right way. I was also raised during a time when men beat their wives if they disobeyed them, or burnt dinner. That was no more right than believing that only certain kinds of love are acceptable."
"Tony, talk to me," There is kindness in Steve's voice and it gives Tony a tiny shred of hope that his idea of confessing might not blow up in his face completely, "I can see that something's bothering you. Talk to me about it, please. I want to help if I can."
"Fine. Excellent. You busy?" Tony says quickly, trying to keep himself from simply turning and running back to his lab.
"We are terribly sorry Master Clint. We simply wished to thank you for making such delicious food and letting us be useful to you," Tony explains quietly, standing up a little straighter, "We did not mean to offend. Perhaps you would prefer the use of our other holes. We are experienced enough to provide..."
"That video we saw..." Tony nods, "They kill people, hurt people. That's what they do. And they'll do the same to us. Especially now that we've made them angry."
They stand, Clint and Natasha each carrying one of the boys and head out to the car, ignoring the curious glances from the collected cops at the station.
By silent agreement, they convene in the living room, with Clint and Natasha each ending up holding one of their sleeping comrades. Gently, more gently than anyone in the room has ever seen her be, Natasha tries to wake the sleeping Tony that's ended up on her lap. She carefully jiggles his shoulder, speaking his name in increasingly louder tones, though she never gets anywhere close to yelling. Finally, after several tries, he stirs and opens his eyes. His big brown eyes stare up at her for a moment, then he finishes waking up and really sees her. He pulls into himself, mouth forming into a tight line.
"It's not unpronounceable. It's Mjolnir, and it's older than Earth. Hulk is Bruce's hero name. Your suit names are just their model numbers, though they don't go in any kind of perceivable order that I can tell. Natasha calls them Widow Makers because they're hers, and they are. And Agent Coulson and Barton do stranger things than name their weapons. Just because they have doesn't mean I have to follow suit. And even if I did I wouldn't name it Disc of Death," Steve counters, quickly finishing his lunch to keep Tony from eating the rest of it.
"What? You think 'she' fits better?" he asks with a dismissive wave of his hand, turning back to his schematics, "The shield's practically another member of the team with it's physics defying abilities. Might as well give it a name too. What about AmeriShield? Or Captain Saucer? Oooh. Disc of Death. I like that one."
In the end Natasha and Thor end up heading back to the hellicarrier to tell Bruce in person. He doesn't lose his control, but instead collapses in tears of his own at the thought of his best friend being tortured in such a manner. They stay with him for a few hours until he's calm enough to be left on his own.
Tony leans against Steve’s arm, pretending to read the paper over his shoulder. He’d really hoped the Captain would go with him so they could spend some time together, (which Tony is determined to think of as team bonding and not as him wanting to spend time with his crush, because that is so patently ridiculous it makes his head hurt. Just because his heart beats a little faster when he hears Steve’s voice in his ear during a mission, or his breath comes short when the Captain lays a hand on his shoulder to pull him from his work for dinner, doesn’t mean he
"It's a possibility. I'll have JARVIS run some silent tests on them to see if I can verify it. How are they doing otherwise?"
They watch a movie for a little while, but Tony quickly tires of it, so Clint goes to the large cabinet by the TV to see if there’s a video game he can interest the boy in. When he turns back with Mario Kart in his hand, Tony is gone. Clint has a moment of panic, before he hears a sound from the kitchen. He forces himself to walk at a normal pace into the next room, stopping dead in his tracks at what he sees.
Slowly, almost like he's putting on a show, Steve pulls his shirt over his head and tosses it in a random direction, not really caring where it lands. His sleep pants are tight, and his own erection clearly strains against the fabric, outlining his impressive bulge. Steve lays down next to Tony, shucking his pants and boxers quickly and efficiently. Tony sits up and stares at him for several long moments, looking him up and down, gulping audibly at what he sees.
“He suffered what appears to be some minor abrasions and possibly some bruising, but he’s resisting being taken to medical. Which is most likely due to the side effects. The detonation has turned Stark into a child, no more than four years old at the most, and he thinks we’ve kidnapped him. He knows who he is at least, but doesn’t have any of his adult memories. We managed to corner him in an interrogation room for now, but until we can convince him of who we are…”
Steve nods, accepting the answer and grabs the bottle of lube, popping the cap, drizzling a bit on his fingers, and setting it by the pillow. He gently pushes Tony's knees apart and sits between them. He lifts one of Tony's legs and pulls it on to his shoulder, effectively granting him access to Tony's hole. He gently rubs lube around the small pucker, spreading it around and occasionally dipping the tip of his finger in before pulling it immediately back out. When Tony softly cries out for more, Steve obliges, pouring a bit more lube on his fingers before pushing one inside of Tony at an almost excruciatingly slow pace.
“Your dad thinks it will be safer, while we try and figure out why those men took you,” Natasha adds suddenly, shocking all the other members of the team. None of them had actually thought about what they were going to tell the boy, who for all intents and purposes is a four year old Tony Stark, whose parents are still alive and well, and would want to know why he is going to stay with Steve and his team instead of being taken home, “But we need to keep where you are a secret, so I’m sorry, but you won’t be able to talk to your parents until we’re certain you won’t be taken again.”
“Of the two of us, who is the most likely to talk about something they’re thinking or feeling?” Steve says with a slight smirk, moving his hands to pet Tony’s hair.
They sit in silence for several minutes, Tony still rubbing circles on Steve’s chest, while Steve pets his hair, and rubs his hand along Tony’s back. After a while has passed, Steve finally speaks.
“You can stay in my room, Tony. There’s plenty of space, and if those guys do come back, I promise I won’t let them take you,” Steve assures him.
"Are they now? Well, how about you two come with me and we can meet them down at the station? It's dangerous out here and I wouldn't want you two getting hurt. I'm sure your parents wouldn't like that either."
"They're for you to play with. You can use them any time you want," Natasha informs them, trying to hand a sketchbook and set of colored pencils to Steve.
"You did just fine telling me. So what's the hold up?" Bruce questions, pulling up a chair and taking a seat next to Tony.
Steve showers and dresses quickly, then goes to make the requested pancakes. In hindsight, leaving Clint alone with a child Tony, and expecting them to put pancake ingredients together probably wasn’t the smartest plan Steve’s ever had. When he walks into the kitchen, it looks like it’s been hit with a tornado. A very powerful flour tornado. Both Clint and Tony are covered in flour, having apparently decided that a flour war sounded much more exciting than making pancakes. Natasha is sitting at the dining room table, drinking her coffee and reading the newspaper, trying to hide her smile. Steve gives both Clint and Tony a stern look, then takes the broom from the corner and tosses it at Clint, smirking when Clint looks at him in disbelief after catching it.
Steve feels his blood begin to boil under his skin, and tendrils of red streak his vision when he hears the small voice on the other end of the phone screaming for help. In the back of his mind he vaguely wonders if this is how Bruce feels right before the Other Guy takes over. His anger should surprise him. In fact, the whole situation should surprise him, but it doesn’t. He doesn’t dwell on his lack of surprise for more than a millisecond, as his mind is more focused on the fact that
He hangs up the phone abruptly, but Natasha is used to his mannerisms and it doesn't phase her. She goes back into the living room and finds Tony and Steve sleeping peacefully, curled up around each other.
“So that’s your play!” Tony cries triumphantly, standing up to glare at Steve and missing the contact immediately. “I’m your sacrificial lamb to keep the SHIELD demons at bay for a few more months!”
Natasha wipes a tear from her cheek, and Clint holds out the hand he'd injured while they were trying to recover their lost friends. It's an angry jagged line that stands out starkly against his pale skin. The boys stare at the injury in shock, then look to him for an explanation, and see tears running down his face, his voice cracking with emotion when he speaks.
"No, Tony. We are not going to sell you. Ever. The way you were treated by those trainers was quite horrible and incredibly wrong," Thor tells him, pulling the little boy close in his arms, "We will never treat you in that manner. We love you far too much to ever harm you."
A silent tear rolls down Clint’s cheek as Tony speaks. Suddenly, everything starts to make horrifying, terrible sense. From the moment Tony and Steve had gone offline, it had taken the rest of the team exactly forty seven minutes to find them. But what had been minutes for them, had been days to the small children trapped within. Clint places a hand gently on the side of Tony’s face, the resulting flinch piercing his heart as he whispers,
"I think I hate you both," Clint says, exasperated with both of them, "But you're both right. Tony, you need to respect Steve's reservations, and Steve, you need to respect that Tony knows his own body, and that he'll tell you if there's a problem."
“Of course it did,” Fury says to no one in particular, “I don’t know why I should be surprised. Stark’s on board. Something was bound to blow up sooner or later. Send a team down to make sure there’s no injuries and that nothing
“Tony?” he asks, trying to open his eyes. His room is still dark, but the barest hint of light can be seen creeping through the curtains. “What time is it?”
"Is Phil... big... you know... down there...? Tony asks, turning a deep shade of red as he voices his question.
"No. Nothing I found. Everything about him is perfect," Tony says, mentally yelling at himself for losing focus so noticeably.
Steve wakes very suddenly when a heavy weight pushes down on his chest. He opens his eyes and sees Tony, back to his normal size, sleeping on top of him. Tony stirs slightly, blinking up at Steve in confusion.
"How did this happen?" Director Fury demands of the collected Avengers who are sitting around a conference table on the SHIELD hellicarrier.
"Wha...? You...? Why...? Why did you do that?! You better not be making fun of me, or so help me, I will put on my damn suit!" Tony practically screams at Steve, breathing heavily and visibly confused and slightly upset, even though it is the response he was hoping for, if a bit more visceral than he imagined it being.
“You’re using me!” There is anger in Tony’s voice now, which startles him. Logically, it makes sense, and Tony knows it. But the fact that it’s
“NO!” Tony shouts, sitting up and pressing his palms against Steve’s shoulders, “That’s not what I meant. I just meant that we should probably just be up front with the team about it. If we… you know… do this. And I
Natasha releases Tony's wrist and he hugs his arms to his chest, fear written plainly on his face. He can't meet Thor's eyes as he replies.
"Sorry, man. You're gonna have to be a lot better than that if you want to keep a secret in this house," Clint replies with a slight chuckle, going back to his practice.
respond to the cackling that comes from the kitchen the second time the boy escapes from Steve’s room,) and has to promise on his shield that he won’t get soap in Tony’s eyes when he washes his hair. Tony is also extremely ticklish, and flails around to get out of Steve’s grasp when the Captain is scrubbing him down to get the flour off of him, which leaves both the bathroom and the exasperated Captain soaking wet. Not to mention the fact that Steve’s never seen the adult Tony naked, (though he thinks about it from time to time when he’s alone in bed,) and is incredibly embarrassed by the entire situation and feels like a horrible voyeur, despite the fact that Tony is currently four, and apparently has exactly zero shame.
Steve repeats what Clint had told him that morning, helping Tony off his lap and pulling out a bag from the nightstand drawer. He dumps the contents on the bedspread, and a small toy, just barely bigger than a finger drops out, along with a large bottle of lube.
"Master Clint made us some food and allowed us to assist in its preparation and clean up. We were grateful for the chance to be useful, as we have not done anything of use since you brought us here, and we wished to convey our appreciation by servicing him. Our trainers taught us many different methods of sexually pleasuring our Masters using our holes, though we aren't very experienced yet. When we tried to service Master Clint, he pushed us away. He ordered us not to speak and we have been awaiting our punishment. We did not mean to displease him."
“I’ll explain on the jet,” is all the explanation Steve gives before turning and heading for the roof.
“Hi, Tony. My name is Steve. I know you’re scared, but I’m here to take you home now. Would you like that?”
Fury raises his hands in mock surrender and steps away from the door. Clint and Tasha take up places on either side of the door, keeping their respective weapons holstered, but they stay ready to draw them at any time. Steve hands his shield to Tasha, and opens the door.
Once the exam is finished and Steve has been given an inhaler, instructed in its use, and promised to use it whenever he has a hard time breathing, and to notify them if the problem gets worse, Natasha takes them upstairs and sets them on the couch, turning on a movie. They try to protest, insisting that they can still be helpful, that the injuries won't damage their usefulness, so Natasha ends up having to give them strict orders to stay on the couch and rest for a while. For the first time in a very long time, she fights back tears as she walks away from the scene on the couch. Stepping into the next room, she pulls out her phone and dials Fury's number.
"Of course we want you. We will always want you. You're a part of this family. Why would you think that?"
"They’ve got several fading bruises and a few fresh ones," Bruce reports, pulling his own blanket tighter around his shoulders, "But I can’t tell if those are from their adult selves, or if something happened to them. Although the fading ones leave me to believe they're from their adult selves. It only took us forty five minutes or so to reach them and bruises don’t fade that fast. The newer ones might be fresh though. I’ll run a full work up when we get them back to the mansion. Steve’s been favoring one of his arms, and I’m worried it might be fractured. I think their powers are gone. I took a blood sample just to be on the safe side though. Steve's small for his age, which probably means I won't find the serum in his blood, and Tony's intelligence might still be intact, but his reactor is missing. Although, considering how much trouble it gives the adult version, I have to admit I'm glad of its absence. We don't need two children with breathing problems."
we’ll have any problems, but it’s better to be prepared,” Steve says. Then his voice quiets, “Clint. I hate to ask this. I know it’s a tough subject, but…”
Steve doesn't interrupt or demand he hurry. He knows how hard it can be to open up about a problem, and for Tony it seems to be doubly so. So he stands near the bar waiting for Tony to finish gathering his thoughts. It doesn't take him much longer.
"They're watching a movie, sort of," Natasha says, going up to Clint and placing a hand on his shoulder, "But I couldn't convince them to play with the toys. I think that's going to take a bit longer."
“Well, I have faith in you guys. You’re the closest thing to family he’s ever had. I know you’ll figure it out,” she pats his arm encouragingly then leaves and heads back to work.
! And then Natasha said that she could take out a bad guy with a toothpick, which is really scary if it’s true, but also kinda cool. And she said that as soon as you got home we could have pancakes for breakfast. Can we?”
Clint hangs up the phone and slips it back into his pocket. Then he slides to the floor and pulls his knees close, burying his head between them and sobbing quietly.
“I love you, Tony,” he whispers, voice barely audible, “I have for awhile now. I just didn’t realize how much until I almost lost you. Well, the adult you. This you. I didn’t know how to tell you. Still don’t. I’m terrified that if you knew, that our friendship would be over, and I couldn’t bare that. Everything is still so new, so foreign to me. Having you here… it grounds me, in a way. Makes me feel like I’m not alone anymore. If I lost that… I honestly don’t know what I’d do. I need you, Tony. More than
Steve takes the sketchbook and pencils and sets them on the floor next to him. A single tear runs down his face and he looks up at Natasha. He wipes it away quickly, but she still sees it.
“Cliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiint!” he shouts, diving onto the sleeping archer, and startling the man awake.
“Hi!” Tony responds enthusiastically, “Do you really help Captain America save the world? What are your super powers? Can you fly? I’ve always wanted to fly. How many bad guys have you stopped? Was it hard?”
We have miles of darkness to go before our little family is whole again, (and some of them a bit less little,) but I'm in for the long haul. It just might take me a little longer to get there. Thank you for your patience and understanding. You guys have been awesome. <3
Natasha lays a calming hand on Clint's arm and he takes several short but deep breaths, trying to rein in his temper.
"See? You don't have to treat me like I'm going to break all the time," Tony comments, feeling like he's won the argument.
"I think, the main reason we came to see you today," Steve starts flushing furiously, "Is because Tony wants to try doing it with a little less preparation. And even though things have been going well, I'm still worried about hurting him."
"Steve. Tony. Can you tell me what happened?" She keeps her voice calm and gentle despite the circumstances, not wanting to make what ever problem has arisen worse.
It opens quickly and both of them enter, closing the door just as quickly behind them and glancing around the room to see where the danger is. When Steve smiles up at them from the floor, a small boy in his lap, they relax a little and join Steve on the floor. Tasha hands Steve his shield when he reaches for it, and then he holds it out for Tony to see.
Everyone looks up from their seat on the plane, stopping in the middle of removing their seat belts to stare up at him.
They walk over to her silently and stand in front of her, heads bowed. Clint takes a seat next to her and Thor does the same.
be gained if Steve returns the feelings. There have been several times during conversations or playful banter in the kitchen or lab when Tony has had to stop himself from just leaning in and kissing the other man. He'd felt... something from Steve, but has never been sure of what it was. Maybe Steve does feel the same way about him, but has been waiting for Tony to make the first move. God knows with Steve's personality, the good Captain would never be the one to do it.
“Tony, Clint thinks you’ll enjoy the trick more if you watch it. And you can’t really see it if you’re the one with the apple. So I’m going to put the apple on my head while you watch from over by Steve,” Natasha informs the boy, plucking the apple from his head.
If you've never heard the story of William Tell before, go-go-gadet Google and take a look. It's an... interesting story.
Steve shakes his head, hands raised slightly at his side, though whether it’s in defense or surrender, he has no idea. Tony sighs and drops back down, laying his head on Steve’s chest and pulling the covers up to cover them.
When they reach the main road they pick a random direction and walk for what seems like hours. They hide every time a car passes them, which isn't often given the hour and the remote location. After quite some time, they reach a small gas station and take the little amount of money they were able to steal from a drawer in one of the bedrooms, and buy several granola bars and two bottles of gatorade. The cashier gives them a curious look, but sells them the food anyway and they head back out into the night. A few minutes later a car quietly pulls up behind them, and a man in a blue uniform gets out.
It’s nearly lunch time by the time Steve finishes making the pancakes and sets them on the table. Thor joins them for the meal, and tells a delighted Tony about all the strange and fascinating beasts he’s fought on Asgard. Tony had insisted on hearing about Thor’s home once he’d discovered that Thor was an alien, and had completely stumped the demigod when he’d asked why Thor wasn’t green.
Once the meal is over and the boys have helped him do the dishes, they settle down on the floor to watch another movie. Clint tries to convince them to sit on the couch with him, but they decline unsurprisingly. Clint spreads out on the couch and within five minutes of watching "Finding Nemo" his exhaustion catches up to him and he is fast asleep, dead to the world.
"An awesome name, that's what kind. What, you don't like it?" Tony retorts, snagging a few chips from the Captain's plate.
"You asked," comes the archer's response, coupled with a laugh, "I think the rest is pretty self explanatory. Insert, thrust, finish. Wash, rinse, repeat. As often as possible, if you're me. But why are you asking me about this instead of talking to Tony? Surely he, with his unlimited internet access, knows all this already."
Tony takes deep breaths as Steve pushes inside of him. It hurts, but not as much as he thought it would, as Steve had done an extremely thorough job of preparing him. There is still a moment, when Steve is finally full seated inside of him that Tony does feel a little like he's being torn in half, but the feeling is fleeting, replaced instantly by want, and even more pressing need. Once he's certain Tony has adjusted, Steve pulls out a bit then pushes back inside, the tiny moan it causes making his dick grow even harder, which he hadn't thought was possible.
“Come on, Bruce! It’ll be fun! You and me together, showing up those know-it-alls over at SHIELD, kicking butt, taking names, it’ll be fun!” Tony says encouragingly, putting himself between Bruce and his computer screen.
Steve leans heavily against the closed door once he leaves the room, taking long, deep breaths. He knows it isn’t the same as hearing it from the adult Tony, the one he is starting to admit he actually loves, but it still caught him off guard and made his heart skip a couple beats. He just hopes that Tony doesn’t remember anything once he’s turned back, because even though Steve knows and has accepted that Tony will never return the feelings the Captain has for him, Steve couldn’t bear the loss of the other man’s friendship, tentative as it is at times.
“I could ask you the same question!” Tony says a bit heatedly, though Steve can tell there’s no real malice behind his words. Tony runs his hands along Steve’s chest, drawing indiscernible patterns.
"I don't know. This is so far outside the realm of anything I've ever dealt with," Natasha answers staring at the ground, "Maybe it's time to call in a professional."
The little body in his arms relaxes a little, and Steve can’t help but pick him up and carry him to his room. He sets Tony on the bed along with his shield, and starts taking off his uniform. Tony watches him, eyes wide. Steve has never had anyone watch him while he undressed, let alone a four year old boy. A four year old boy whose adult self Steve has been secretly crushing on for months, but never found the courage to say anything to. It’s disconcerting to say the least, and Steve can feel himself blushing. But Steve isn’t really sure how to explain his dilemma to the kid, so he just slips into his walk in closet and dresses as quickly as he can. When he comes back out, Tony is trying to pick up his shield and slip it on his arm. He notices Steve before the Captain can say anything, and drops the shield back to the bed as though it’s burned him.
The next day, Bruce calls Stephen Strange for help in figuring out how to turn Tony back into an adult, and then the two of them sequester themselves in Bruce’s lab. Steve goes for his usual run in the morning, and upon his return, is greeted by the small brunette crashing into his legs as soon as he walks in the door.
Natasha raises an eyebrow, impressed at the AI's efficiency and calm reactions to what's happened to his creator, but she supposes that's one of the benefits of having an emotionless artificial intelligence as a sidekick.
On that note, I am not a doctor. Nor am I trained in psychiatry or trauma recovery. However, neither are Tasha, Clint, and Thor. So while I remind you not to tout anything in this story as real and viable methods of helping people deal with trauma, I will also remind you that it is inevitable that the trio will make mistakes and step on invisible mines. They are doing the best they can, but nobody's perfect. And this is also fiction.
“Just like the Commandos,” responds Steve, trying to keep the sadness out of his voice at the memory of his friends, “Would you like to meet them?”
“No, Director, I don’t suppose there is,” Steve responds, letting his anger show plainly, “Now, are you going to hand him over, or does this have to get messy?”
Once they've finished talking and deciding how to handle their small teammates, and compromised on putting the kitchen knives in a locked cupboard, Thor decides it's time for some dinner and they head out into the living room. Tony and Steve are no longer asleep, but are instead kneeling next to one of the arm chairs with their hands folded in their laps, eyes staring fixedly at the ground. All three adults stare at the two of them for a few moments before Natasha clears her throat and kneels next to them.
"I shall research current theories and provide the necessary items and literature to all your inboxes by tomorrow morning. Do you think they would prefer separate beds or a bunk bed?"
“He thought something happened to you when you weren’t there when he woke up,” Clint explains, handing the Captain a towel.
"Tony keeps spare cash in his room, just incase," Natasha informs him, "They must have found it. Did the local PD respond?"
Tony spends the better part of the day locked in his office and resolutely ignoring his entire team. None of them have mentioned his childhood adventure the few times he's seen them, and he did make sure to swing by Bruce's lab and thank him for his help in turning him back, promising the other genius that he would call Stephen and do the same. Instead of tinkering with new suit designs or working on the pile of projects sitting on his desk, Tony searches the internet for advice on dealing with a partner that is of significant size. Unfortunately, most of what he finds is either for straight couples, or contains images that are far too graphic for his innocent mind. And the images scare him. A lot. Now worried about stretching out so much his anus will never close again, Tony takes a deep breath and goes to talk to the one person in the mansion that has actual real world experience with the act. He finds the archer in the library reading a book. As soon as he enters, he takes a seat in the chair next to Clint and folds his hands in his lap, trying to think of the best way to start the conversation.
Tony just nods, sliding his own hand down Steve’s front until he reaches the waist band of his sleep pants. Deftly, and as easily as plucking a dandelion, Steve flips them over, so that Tony is laying beneath him. He presses his hands into Tony’s shoulder’s, and a groan of need escapes Tony’s lips. Steve removes his hands, apology written clearly on his face.
Clint stands flattened against the wall breathing hard, his brain struggling to catch up with the situation and failing. He zips himself back up, now completely flaccid, and pulls out his phone speed dialing Natasha's number. She picks up on the second ring.
“In all honesty, you,” Tony replies, his answer startling Steve slightly, “I rarely talk about what I
"Clint. You have to tell me what happened. I can't help if I don't know the situation," she tries to reason with him.
"Not that I'm complaining, but what was that for?" Steve asks when Tony pulls away after a few moments.
"I think the alien regression technology didn't work perfectly," Natasha tells Bruce when she calls him from Tony's office later that day.
"Steve. Tony. Let's go home. It's been a long night and I'm sure you're tired. We can talk about this in the morning," Natasha offers, pushing her chair back to stand.
Steve stirs before they can introduce themselves, and he immediately shrinks back into himself at the sight of Clint holding him. He looks over at Tony and they exchange a look that none of the adults understand, and the fear vanishes from their faces. Confused, Clint looks down at Steve.
Clint nods, laying his head back and taking slow measured breaths. Steve stands to go and talk to Tony, but stops when they hear a rough scraping noise coming from the hall. After a moment, Tony emerges again, dragging Clint’s bow case beside him. Clint jumps up from the couch and vaults over the coffee table, gently taking the case from Tony before he can hurt himself.
"Something Tony said gave me an idea. They think, or were told, that they were bad children so their parents gave them away. Sold them. What if we become their new family?" Tasha says, taking a seat on one of the weight benches and pulling Clint down to sit next to her.
"Nothing is wrong Miss. I simply wanted to be available in case you or Master Clint required service during the night. Would you have preferred my brother? He is in Master Thor's room."
"How are we to handle this?" Thor asks, "They are expecting a punishment. How are we to make sure this sort of thing never happens again while also keeping from frightening them?"
"With a lot of caution and kindness," Tasha informs both him and Clint, "JARVIS is sending us some literature to look over about dealing with traumatized and abused children. But I do know we should keep our voices down, stick to soft inside voices, even...
"I'll do some work on it too," Bruce says, his voice daring Fury to argue with him, "They're my friends."
Thor and Bruce follow him, and once Tony has been strapped into the seat next to Steve, Clint takes off and they head for home.
So... here we leave Tiny Tony behind and venture forward with Stoney. I hope you enjoyed it, and I hope you enjoy what's to come!  Please leave me a comment and let me know what you thought!
"We just found out they were raped and trained to be sex slaves and you want to bring in a stranger?!" Clint practically shouts at her.
"You're right. I'll be more useful up there anyway, and SHIELD has a way to deal with the Other Guy if I lose my cool. Which I've been on the verge of doing since Tony woke up and we figured out what happened."
"You're... a lot bigger than I imagined you'd be..." Tony comments, his mouth going a little dry at the sheer size of the man in front of him. He'd expected him to be big, but this... is a lot more than just big, "I... I don't know if you'll be able to fit... inside of me. I've never done this before. With another man, I mean."
"Hello Sir. My brother and I are just going out for a walk. Our parents know where we are. They're going to meet us a little later," Tony answers, hoping his face doesn't show how terrified he is and give away the lie.
Steve pulls Tony to his feet and leads him to the door. Tony turns and waves to the archer just as Steve turns the handle.
“It detonated? Is Tony alright? Was he hurt? And what do you mean by side-effects?” The joking tone is gone from Steve’s voice, and genuine concern and worry replace it.
"Affirmative. An Officer Warrington brought in two boys matching the young sirs description not five minutes ago. Shall I inform the police department that you are on your way?"
They jump up from the floor and rush to the kitchen, eager to be helpful. They take seats at the bar, and Clint pulls out bread and sliced cheese, putting them to work buttering the bread and putting the cheese on. They are quick and efficient, and in no time the soup is ready and the sandwiches are golden and crispy. The boys devour them with fervor, intrigued when Clint tells them about dipping the sandwich in the soup.
“I love you, Tony,” he whispers, hoping beyond hope that at least the memory of his words will stay with the man he loves. Then he relaxes and joins the boy in sleep.
Tony stands outside the gym Steve uses for training trying to gather up the courage to open the door. But before he can, Steve himself appears, nearly running into the startled Tony.
"Good plan. You'll have to show me whatever stuff you come up with. Well, back to work. See you later!"
"For now, take them back to the mansion. Try and see if you can get any information out of them, see what they remember. I'll call Strange and Xavier, probably Richards too, see if they can help us shed any light on the situation and help us deal with that ship.”
be going on a tirade, trying to save what little dignity I have left, I won’t. Cause I value our friendship too. And… if it works out… I’d like to maybe explore the possibility of there being something more.”
"Huh. That probably means our careers as spies are over," Tony quips, sliding into Steve's lap and straddling him.
Clint’s mind very rapidly goes through the five stages of grief, plus some other emotions thrown in for good measure. The main contenders are shock and anger, and it’s a close tie for dominance. But Steve had informed them of how Tony had reacted when Steve had caught him looking at the shield, so Clint resolutely pushes the anger aside. Hawk had also noticed his string catching when he’d been using the bow that morning, but having years of experience with archery, he knew that all that was needed was to replace the string. Not to mention that fact that
"We didn't give you new names, honey. Those are the names you've always had. What did you think your names were?" Natasha asks, knowing that the last thing she wants to hear is the answer.
“A bit. Let’s get him on the jet and you can take a look at him,” Steve says before nudging Tony’s shoulder softly, “Tony, this is Dr. Banner. He’s one of my friends. He needs to take a look at those cuts you have, alright?”
"I believe I shall attempt to make some of the Captain's famous pancakes for breakfast. How does this sound?" Thor asks, setting Tony on the ground.
"Then why are you keeping us around, huh? Are we your pets? We just sit there and look pretty? You barely let us do anything but sleep and watch the TV. Or did you buy us to use as practice dummies when you design a new weapon? Or to use as bait for the people you're fighting? What are we to you?!" Tony screams, standing in his chair and leaning over the table at them.
"What do you mean? All the tests indicate that their bodies are four years old," Bruce asks, confused, and she can still hear the repressed anger in his voice.
“Wha th fu…? Tony?” Clint manages to get out, pressing a hand to his chest and trying to catch his breath when he sees the little boy on top of him.
“You either want me to call Fury and tell him you can’t help them, or go with you and do the same.” Steve remarks, turning the page with a small smile at the pout on Tony’s face.
Steve doesn't say anything right away, which causes the weight to press down even harder. Then Steve takes a deep breath of his own and smiles at Tony. Then he steps forward, grabs the back of Tony's head, and pulls him in for a mind numbing kiss that leaves tingles on both their lips when Steve pulls away.
The boxes are a godsend. Tony pulls out all his favorites once he and Thor come back inside, and very quickly turns the Avenger’s living room into a giant play room. Steve, Thor and Clint all get roped into playing with him, while Natasha politely declines and sits on the couch to read. They spend the majority of the afternoon building a perfect lego replica of the mansion, complete with quinjet and parking garage, only stopping when Tony’s stomach begins to rumble loudly.
"Bout damn time," responds Clint, causing Steve's head to shoot up with a look of incredulous surprise plastered on his face, "You two have been dancing around each other for months. We even had a bet going to see how long it would take you two to get together. Looks like Tasha won. She bet it would take some catastrophic, life altering event for you two to pull your heads out of your asses. I had my money on Valentine's Day. Makes people do weird things. Anyway, I'm glad you guys figured it out. Really was painful watching you watch each other when you thought no one was looking."
