“Why couldn’t you have changed the lyrics to uptown boy? I’m not a girl.” Tony’s pout was back when he remembered his earlier displeasure.
“Looks like you like it sweetheart, that’s beautiful Tones. Keep at it Buck, his cock is twitchin like crazy in my hand, he’s so close.”
Tony cut himself off as Marie stopped singing and on screen the camera zoomed in on little Tony as he began to sing
“Fuck,” Steve whispered. Bucky and Clint shared twin grins.
Both men looked at each other curiously. It was far too early for Tony to be done. They had seen the damage to the suit and knew it would take their lover a good long while to fix. That was why they were incredibly surprised when the doors opened to reveal Tony. The men on the couch shared another look this time of hopeful surprise. They watched Tony carefully to see if perhaps he had only come up because he had run out of coffee, but to their surprise Tony lurched forward towards them, head down, and proceeded to crawl onto both of their laps. Most of Tony’s body on Steve’s lap and his feet propped up in Bucky’s. Tony grabbed onto Steve’s shirt and buried his face in his neck and whimpered putting his two lovers on alert immediately.
“Stop worrying Stevie,” Bucky murmured, “His temp is goin down, and JARVIS will let us know if it gets worse again. Otherwise I say we get some sleep. I have a feelin that the next few days are gonna be one hell of a time. His throat looked like it was bothering him, so he’s probably getting a cold.”
“Ouch!” yelled an unknown voice. On screen a little girl dressed in a white dress with a large pink bow tied around her waist ran into the scene. The little girl had long blonde hair, tied up in a matching pink satin bow. The girl was smiling smugly to someone off camera. She sat quickly next to the piano and began smoothing down her dress and running her fingers through her hair, looking ever the proper one.
Tony whined again when he heard the sound of splashing water and feeling two large bodies mold up against his. Tony was too scared to open his eyes, even though keeping them closed wasn’t helping him pretend to be brave.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Sidekick...seriously?”
“We promise!” every shouted. Tony smiled at his team-his family.
Tony jumped when he was startled out of his project when a new song came blaring on, something that definitely wasn’t on his playlist. The opening chords to Uptown Girl came on, Tony being totally confused looked first up to the ceiling silently asking JARVIS for an answer, then turning to look at his boyfriends and bursting into laughter.
Tony looked at every Avenger, making sure to make eye contact with each one, seeing the regret clearly shown on their faces. “Well” said Tony, “I suppose I can’t stay mad forever, and everyone was having a good time. Just promise me you’ll never do this kind of thing to me again. I was really hurt.”
“Jesus, Buck!” Steve laughed, “I don’t know if he’s ready for your mouth yet, we want him alive, not dead,” he smirked.
“JARVIS?”
Once everyone had been dried off and Tony’s hair getting thoroughly rubbed down, his two lovers smiling dopily at the sight of his fluffy hair, the two soldiers took their sick lover back to the bedroom where they double teamed him into one of Steve’s shirts and a pair of Bucky’s pants. Bucky pulled the covers down so that Steve could lay Tony down, quickly climbing in after him, and covering them back up under the covers, Tony’s head propped up on Steve’s chest. Bucky quickly slipped in on the other side, Tony safely sandwiched between them.
“Ah bootiful Mama!” cried the boy with the biggest grin spread across his face.
Not to be left out of the conversation, Bucky squeezed Tony’s shoulder in assurance.
“Anthony, when I call your name I expect you to come! Are you literally too much of an idiot child to understand that? My god boy!”
Tony could only nod, they hadn’t even really touched him yet, but this was all too new, too overwhelming.
“Hm,” came the voice behind the camera, his next words sounding like he was smiling, “Captain America, I dare say you should check over by this pile of blankets, it looks very suspicious, perhaps Bucky Bear is trapped inside.”
“Sir, if I may say so?” he received another grunt in response. “I do not believe your team did this to you maliciously. They were all quite besotted with the younger sir and did not know they were going to stumble upon such content. It was not right for them to watch them without your consent, but your team cares for you deeply Sir, they would never hurt you on purpose. Especially Captain Rogers or Sergeant Barnes.”
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“I am sorry Sir, I was distracted.”
“Well,” said Tony, “Mama trained me in piano as soon as I could hold a screwdriver and that was pretty early on. She wante-”
“Yeah but that’s embarrassing!” whined Tony. There was another short pause until JARVIS spoke up again, this time a little hesitant and a lot amused.
“What Bucky is saying, is that we have feelings for you Tony. We’ve had feelings for you for a long time, but we were too scared of what you’d say.”
Tony was overwhelmed. He could barely look them in the eyes with how much the older men were starting at him. He didn’t know what to choose, all he knew was that he needed.
“Do you wish for me to continue Sir?” Tony groaned in response “Very well Sir. The third video was your mother and Agent Carter surprising you with a visit.”
“I DID FUCKNIG WHAT!” yelled Tony, his face quickly changing into different shades of red.
“Wow that was like, a wave of rage Buckaroo,” teased Tony.
Bucky was sitting at the corner of his old couch one arm draped across the back while the other one lay in his lap where it was busy playing with Steve’s hair. Steve looking as content as could be laying in the lap of his love, busy sketching his other love as he worked with his tech. Watching Tony work was art in motion, the both of them his favorite subjects. Both soldiers had content smiles on their faces and seemed totally relaxed despite the blaring rock music.
“I mean duh? What else could it mean big green and mean?” teased Clint. Bruce threw a pillow in the archers direction which was quickly swatted away by Natasha, the pillow had been aimed poorly.
“What did you pick Cap?” asked Bruce
He was pulled out of his thoughts when he heard the water shut off and heard his lovers talking to one another.
“A nice cool bath will be useful right about now. It’ll cool his body down.” Bucky reached up to hold Steve’s face with his hand, knocking their foreheads together gently. Bucky smiled, “Don’t worry Stevie, I’ve had a lot of practice looking after sick people.”
A muffled giggle could be heard while Maria matched his giggle and...another woman’s voice?
Steve and Bucky. Bucky and Steve. There was a thought. A very distracting thought. Life starting out at the tower had started off rocky for everyone. There was a lot of healing to do all around. Given time, things healed and a tentative friendship began between the original Avengers. Steve and Tony began getting along like a house on fire. After getting past their old hang ups about the other they realized they had a very similar sense of humor and liked hanging out with each other. Tony could have sworn there had been even some budding feelings between them. Until Bucky came back that is. But even with the introduction to the unstable ex-assassin and learning what happened to his parents, Tony couldn’t even be mad. It wasn’t surprising when the two soldiers got together. Tony had heard rumors growing up about them. He was happy for them. It was just hard seeing them together for not only did Tony still have feelings for Steve, but he had quickly developed feelings for Bucky as well, what with his rugged good looks and sharp wit that could match his own. He knew though, that the feelings he had towards them were not reciprocated. Plus they were in a relationship with each other. There never was nor will there ever be room for Tony.
“Ya snooze ya lose.” grinned Steve
They sat there in the water. The three men breathing deeply, trying to calm their beating hearts. Tony layed there on Steve’s lap, completely wrung out, leaning his head against his big shoulder, letting his eyes slip closed.
Tony squeaked, not expecting the sudden touch, or how good it felt. His hips seeming to move of their own accord. Tony moaned.
“I love you too, you big pair of dorks.”
“Steve, oh god, come ‘ere, come ‘ere.” Bucky urgently grabbed onto Steve’s bicep and dragged him so that they were both smooshed together by Tony’s legs. There was a pause, then Steve let out a low groan of want.
Tony squeaked, pulling the covers up and over his head. He wanted to thank his lovers. If they didn’t kill him first.
“So one would assume this is when Tony was around age two?” inquired Bruce
“Sh! I want to hear!” hissed Natasha. The team settled back down and turned their attention back to the TV.
“The Avengers watched only four movies thus far and they were as follows. You as a newborn swinging and your mother talking to you, you dressing up in a Captain America onesie searching for your Bucky Bear-”
“I, I don’t really know where to start,” he mumbled the blush returning to his cheeks. The soldiers moaned, sharing a look.
“Buck, what do we do? His temp is getting too high, I mean, what happens when it gets too high? He’ll have to go to the hospital and-”
“Come on baby doll” Bucky cooed “We’ll make you feel better.” Bucky scooped Tony out of Steve’s lap, placing a kiss on his sweaty forehead when he whimpered and headed in the direction of their shared bedroom and ensuite bathroom.
“Hey! I only retaliated. Never initiated. I was raised to be a gentleman.” said Tony haughtily
“What exactly did they all see?” There was a pause and then in a cautious tone.
“Can we see it? Can we see you lose control? Bet you’ll be beautiful.”
“Noted.”
“Now, now Antonio. Now darling, please settle down, and play me your pretty little song.” cooed Maria
“Great you found the pills. Fill a cup and then take out two of those and have him swallow them. Then help me get him out of his clothes.” As Bucky held Tony up Steve approached with the pills and the glass of water. Tony’s eyes were closed, he almost looked asleep if it weren’t for the small whimpers he was making. He must have really felt terrible.
Feeling that warmth bloom once again in his chest for these men, Tony leaned up leaving a quick peck on Steve’s lips followed by Bucky. Tony was about to voice his appreciation for his super soldiers when he was interrupted by a loud excited voice.
In the middle of his workshop stood his two boyfriends with huge goofy grins on their faces, gyrating their hips to the beat of the song. Tony wasn’t sure if they were trying to look seductive, but they were definitely falling flat, making Tony laugh even harder.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony whined, he was so embarrassed! Not even five minutes of them being home he was making a fool out of himself! They’d find out he was so painfully inexperienced and laugh in his face telling him how much of a disappointment he was and that they were going to leave him.
Tony looked up suspiciously. “That was it?”
“And what...did you find...exactly?” he replied hesitantly
Tony was down in his workshop music blasting as he worked on his latest gadget. This one was really going to get those old geezers on the board excited. Maybe they would finally leave him be for a while. Give him some time to himself and his beloveds. Speaking of, both supersoldiers were down in the lab with him.
“Oh my god. Ooooh my god!” shrieked Clint. On screen was a very little Tony. The boy was standing on a stool that had a small rail around the back. Keeping the small child from falling onto the floor. Baby Tony was grinning from ear to ear, wearing only what seemed to be a childs sized apron that looked even a little too big on him. This Tony was definitely younger than the Tony they saw on the ‘Tony Twos’ video. He looked to have a very fine layer of hair on top of his head and his cheeks were definitely chubbier.
Bucky bit his lip, “God Stevie, he’s so innocent he’s gonna kill me!”
“Sh!” the rest of the team hissed
The supersoldiers continued to sit and watch their debatably awful action movie, laughing when one of the main characters had gotten themselves trapped in a choke hold, while Bucky ranting about how there were at least thirty different ways he could break out of that, Steve a giggling mess next to him, when the elevator pinged to alert the arrival of someone to the penthouse.
Tony could only watch his soldiers take turns singing lines from the song making direct eye contact with him. He laughed even harder when they both started to slowly shuffle dance over to his work station. Never once breaking eye contact or missing a word from the song.
“Beauty before age Steve.”
Sweet giggling could be heard as the pair walked down the hallway, Maria still filming the two and chuckling to herself. The two vanished around the corner and the picture turned to black.
“What?” Steve looked down to get a better look at Tony’s now exposed face. He inhaled sharply and quickly placed the back of his hand across Tony’s forehead, becoming even more worried when he didn’t try and bat Steve’s hand away. Tony’s eyes fluttered shut as Steve got a good feel of his temperature.
“They’re probably down there getting frisky, gross.” Clint said with a shudder. “Ow!” he yelled as a pillow was whacked against the back of his head by Natasha.
Steve grunted, “I wish he wasn’t sick at all, I wish there was more we could do.”
“More like adorable and sexy and cute and-” rambled Bucky
“Wah! No! I missed it! Fuckin shit tits!” yelled Bucky quickly sitting back up
“Sweetheart,” cooed Steve, “It’s alright, we want you to feel good. Remember? We said we would help you.”
“My friends, I believe my pick will be most entertaining as it says ‘Tony Twos.’
“I, uh-” he stopped to clear his throat, grimacing at the obvious pain it caused him, “yeah, uh, I feel a little better,” he murmured. “ You guys took real good care of me.”
“You know I’m in love with an uptown girl.”
“Alright wise ass, get going and find the pills. I’ve got Tony.”
Just then the small lump between them began to squirm and a low groan met their ears. They looked down in worry watching to see if Tony was ok. Slowly Tony’s eyes began to flutter open and for the first time in what seemed like too long, a little recognition and a bit of what was pure Tony came back to his chocolatey eyes. Bucky and Steve both smiled down at him when Tony looked at them confusedly.
Steve tugged Tony a little closer. “Oh sweetheart! I can’t stand it!”
Steve gasped. Peggy? Tony had told him Peggy had been in his life but he didn’t know that she had been his Aunt Peggy. He would always love Peggy, she was one of the only people to believe in him when he first started being Captain America, they had been close friends and not seeing her made his heart clench.
“No hamsome, Peg! Ah bootiful!” Tony said in a serious tone
Tony was completely overwhelmed. He never thought he could have this, that his boyfriends would be, not only ok with his inexperience but by the looks of it, severely turned on by it made Tony feel a little more sure footed. His pace, they said. He didn’t even know where to start!
“Are you shittin me!” Bucky’s voice was almost an octave higher than his usual gruff baritone and he had both hands in his hair, gripping tightly.
Tony snorted and smacked his shoulder. “Oh come on, I wasn’t that cute.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s a surprise. Only I hold the secret.” The Avengers rolled their eyes. How dramatic.
“She’s been living in her uptown world!” Steve sang back
“Yes! Oh yes Antonio, you look so good in Mama’s dress, so beautiful. Mama’s angelo.”
Steve smiled to himself. “Alright, so which one do I pick?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The avengers mouths dropped. One minute Marie was trying her best to sing when little Tony began playing all out like a true master. Way beyond the skills of a normal four year old. Clearly their genius was multi-talented. Maria smiled adoringly at her son. Clearly she loved hearing him play so beautifully as well.
The last response got a glare from Steve and Bucky. No one better try flirting with Tony. He was theirs...once they got his consent first of course. The avengers turned quickly back to the screen when they saw Peggy come into view to quickly reassure the boy.
“No more buts!” yelled Tony making Steve snort. Tony rolled his eyes at his immature lover. “Go brush your teeth and then we can try again.”
Steve scrunched up his nose, “Ugh, Buck that was awful, even for you.”
“But, but!”
“Pep’ronni pease!” Baby Tony reached in his sauce covered hands into the cheese bowl and shoved it into his mouth, chewing noisily. Tony then put his hand into his newest bowl and started dropping pepperoni circles onto the pizza, “sneakily” eating a few pieces. More going into his mouth than the pizza.
Tony blushed hotly, “Don’t- don’t look!” Tony attempted to close his legs, but two strong hands, one metal one flesh grabbed onto his ankles, preventing him from closing.
“Oh my god!” Bucky yelled, “Tony! Sweetheart! Love of my life!” Bucky broke down into giggles again. Exasperated, Tony turned to Steve for an answer, beginning to become self conscious.
“Ok, good, now I’m going to pass him to you Steve while I get undressed. Once I’m done I’ll get in with him then you can strip.” Steve nodded and accepted his poor sick lover into his arms, noticing how sweaty the fever was making him. Bucky stripped quickly, grabbing Tony back and slowly stepping into the bath as Steve stripped.
“Beautiful,” agreed Steve
“What?” asked Tony clearly starting to panic
“Yes Sir?”
“Once? Thor, you may be a God, but do you need your eyes checked? He’s still adorable.” argued Steve
“That’s what I am!” Bucky sang as he waggled his eyebrows and Steve flexed.
“I repeat! What the FUCK is going on?” He yelled, “Does no one believe in personal boundaries, consent or thoughts of others anymore? Who said you people could watch these? Watching Howard-” his voice cracked and his hard mask of fury seemed to falter into something the Avengers couldn’t quite place. “Watching all of this garbage.”
“Make it a good one Steve! Preferably baby Tony. I’m still sufferin from diabetes over here and am one hundred percent ok with that.” replied Bucky.
“Steve, if we let him sit down there for God knows how long who knows what’s going to go through that head. We need to make this right and we need to do it now. Not later.”
“I bet her momma never told her why!”
Holy cow! I can't believe this got so much positive response?? No seriously....I can't believe it. Everyone who left a comment asked me to continue so I'm going to do my best! And I was also convinced to add some angst. There is some off screen abuse around the end of the chapter FYI. This chapter and parts of the next one, yes I said next, will be a little angsty but I'm (pretty) sure it will be tooth rotting cuteness from there. I also got some suggestions for this chapter and I kind of mixed a few? Just a little bit. Well...hope you guys like it!
“I have to commend Jarvis. Letting one so small such as you cook your own meals. My mother would do the same thing with Loki and I. Instead of food though it was more like magical conjurings,” said Thor. Clint gave him the side eye.
“Adorable” Bucky finished, “I was saying you’re adorable and you’ve always been adorable and you always will be Tony.”
“We love you too baby,” Steve and Bucky both said. Both of them leaning down to kiss Tony sweetly, Tony having fallen asleep, safe and protected against his supersoldiers.
“That mother fucker.” growled Bucky
“Come on sweet boy, let’s dry off and go to bed. We missed our Tony cuddles so much,” cooed Steve
“Don’t be shy baby, you’re beautiful, never hide from us,” said Bucky
“Antonio guess who is here to visit you! It’s Aunt Peggy! She has missed you dearly!”
“Yeah, we would do it all the time before I was sent to boarding school. He always let me pick what to make. I can’t believe that he let a one year old make a pizza though.”
It seemed Tony’s face was going to permanently stay this shade of red forever, especially if the dynamic duo kept saying sweet things and invading his personal space. Not that Tony minded, especially if they really meant it.
“Bucky,” Tony whined. With one last suck Bucky lifted up letting Tony’s cock slip out from between his lips. Bucky hummed, licking the taste from his lips.
“There’s your beautiful brown bambi eyes,” crooned Bucky as he slowly ran his fingers in the brunets short curls, making the smaller man mewl softly.
However, Tony was too embarrassed to tell his boyfriends, afraid they would leave him for a more experienced partner. He was too selfish to let them go. He would miss the cuddles, the kisses, and the sweet words too much.
Tony whimpered, he couldn’t! He, he just couldn’-
“What?” asked Tony. The pure innocence of the question broke Bucky, laughing loudly at his lovers expense.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Next, need sauce!” Jarvis placed a small bowl in front of Tony and handed him a small spatula. Little Tony lifted the bowl and dumped the entire bowl’s contents into the middle of the dough, making the group laugh.
Tony had to look away, being stared at so intensely was making something in him flutter. Tony opened his eyes when he felt a large warm hand cup his cheek and looked up to meet Steve’s eyes.
“So what does he taste like?” asked Steve while rubbing soothing circles on a panting Tony’s stomach.
“Clint didn’t just find the movies by himself, I was there too. I coulda told him to put them back.” Bucky mumbled.
“Hmph,” grunted Tony
“H-how are you gonna use your hands?”
Steve glared at Bucky but carefully slid Tony’s feet off his lap. Tony himself had fallen asleep during his full body massage. Standing up Steve stepped out of the tub and grabbed the biggest, fluffiest towel they owned. With Tony in his arms Bucky stood carefully and handed him over to Steve to be dried.
“It-there hasn’t been pinning looks!” screamed Tony
Tony frowned, “Did I do something bad?” he asked worriedly, chewing on his thumbnail. That seemed to sober Bucky up real quick. Both men yelled, “No!” and grabbed onto one of Tony’s hands.
Tony could only pant to catch his breath. He had never felt something so warm and wet and perfect around his cock before. He was embarrassed, but he felt like if Bucky hadn’t stopped, he would have lost it, ending quickly.
“Mhm,” Bucky hummed, placing a kiss against his chest, making Tony swallow hard. “I think. You’ll taste. Absolutely. Sweet,” Bucky punctuated each word with a kiss, slowly making his way down Tony’s body until Tony could feel his breath on the tip of his cock. Tony looked down, eyes locking with his longer haired lover. Bucky smirked devilishly, paused for only a moment, then without warning, sucked the head of Tony’s cock into his mouth. Tony screamed.
Heeeeyyyyyyy.......how's everyone doing? Good, good. Yeah so it's been quite a while! I'm sorry for that. Life got busy and I didn't have time to finish! Yes! this is the last chapter I hope it good enough and doesn't leave too many people upset.
“Ay, the Captain and Sergeant have been down there quite awhile.” said Thor
“Anthony!”
“If you’re faithful to your daily prac-ti-cing! You will find your progress is en-cour-a-ging. Do mi so me do mi so me fa la so it goes! When you do your scales and your arpe-gios.”
Tony sat down heavily on his workbench. He let his head drop down onto the table and just closed his eyes. He didn’t want to panic over this. This was not something to panic over, he kept telling himself. He started taking slow deep breathes to calm himself down. He concentrated on his deep breathing and instead of on the creeping feeling of tootightchestnoaircan’tbreatheHELPgoingtodie. Bucky and Steve convinced him to go see a therapist to help with his panic attacks. He really hadn’t wanted to go, now though he was glad he did.
“But I’m ok!” Steve reassured, “Just caught me off guard is all. Everything you did was perfect baby, absolutely perfect. Thank you for letting us make you feel good.”
Ok, so I'm back with a new chapter. I think if I get inspired enough I'll come back and add chapters? So maybe this fic will keep growing? Who knows. Also I'm a huge Disney sap and this song instantly made me think baby Tony. I also totally believe Tony is a musical genius. That's my headcannon. So enjoy this new chapter. Let me know if its cute. I literally just hashed it out. Mot entirely sure how I feel about it.
With that, it was like a flip had switched, both soldiers seemed to move in unison. One second they were lying comfortably within their blanket cocoon and the next the covers were thrown off and Tony found himself on his back staring up into the eyes of two very hungry looking and very naked super soldiers. Tony swallowed hard.
During Tony’s rant he failed to notice the giant grins adorning Steve and Bucky’s faces. Or how they quickly turned to smirks as the small genius was quickly working himself up into and embarrassed panic. Nor did Tony notice the men walking closer until they were almost chest to chest and chest to back. Effectively making a Tony sandwich.
It felt like they had been pleasuring him for days, years. It all started to become too much. Overwhelmed, he began to shake. He felt the familiar hot pressure building inside him and knew he was close.
“Cheese pease!” Another bowl was placed in front of little Tony. This one clearly filled with cheese. Baby Tony took small fistfuls and dumped them onto his creation, getting sauce all over his hands. Again, not doing a super great job at spreading the ingredients.
Tony smiled. He did. In fact it was some of his favorite memories with the man.
“Are you close baby? Gonna make a mess for us?”
“So,” Steve drawled after a few moments, “Is that a no on the maid costume?”
“Woo! I hope it has some adorable baby Tony on it.” said Clint
“You both came to me and I tried to say no, but even I went against your consent Tony, we should have asked. We’re sorry Tony, I’m...sorry.” Steve apologized
Well?????? CLIFF HANGER!! I swear Tiny Tony won't suffer for too long! And big Tony should be making an appearance really soon!
“Alright Stevie, help me get his clothes off, the tub is just about filled.” Bucky sat Tony up a little more and leaned him towards Steve giving Bucky better access to take his shirt off. Once the shirt was removed they maneuvered Tony back against Bucky so he could lift his hips as Steve slipped off his socks, boxers and pants. Tony shivered once his heated skin was exposed to the what seemed like freezing air.
“Tony, sweetheart will you look at me?” asked Steve
“Oh, Stevie, we found the greatest thing since colored TV, in fact we need a TV to experience the greatness!” Bucky giggled as he grabbed Steve by the waist to help him down.
“Shut up, gang green,” muttered Tony, face heating up even more. Bruce chuckled and turned back to the screen. Not wanting to miss a second of baby Tony.
“Ok guys. I think I picked a good one.”
“Guys, seriously, I’m sure Tony would want us to ask at least-”
“I-I’m not a girl!” cried Tony
Both men grinned, glad to hear they were basically forgiven.
“Baby! You’re burning up! What happened? How long has this been going on?” asked Steve
“Sir began developing a fever about an hour ago, although it only began to become a problem about ffteen minutes ago. He stopped working and headed upstairs to you both when he could no longer work.”
“We’re so close Tony, you’re beautiful, you’re driving us mad.”
“Gross,” mumbled Clint. “Ow!” he hissed rubbing his ribs while Natasha glared at him.
“Y-yeah?” Tony stammered and whimpered still slightly distracted by Steve’s hot mouth leaving a trail of marks along his shoulders.
“Me too Buck. How we gonna use our hands baby? Like this,”cooed Steve
“Friend Anthony is truly a sight to see. Who would have known he was once so adorable?
“Oh, my god. Stevie. I’m dead. My heart has stopped. It couldn’t handle this straight up sugar sweet.” bemoaned Bucky
“Who’s judging?”
“Oh! I found one, it’s labeled ‘Music Lesson’ can we watch this one Tony?” asked Clint
Tony hummed in acknowledgement and let himself be washed by his lovers. He mewled when Steve washed his hair, it felt so could and he felt more than he heard Steve chuckle. Bucky had warmed a cloth and was tenderly wiping the mess from Tony’s thighs and stomach.
“It’s a little too late for ‘should have’ Cap.” Natasha replied. Even for her, a woman who was trained to not show emotion, especially in high stress situations, looked deeply distressed by the events that just transpired. She would never had wanted to hurt her friend so badly.
“We need words Tones,” said Bucky, rubbing his thumb along Tony’s hot cheek.
Tony wasn’t sure if he was blushing before but he was definitely blushing now. Steve and Bucky were staring at him. While he was in the tub. While he was NAKED in the tub. Tony subconsciously sank a little further into the water, trying to inconspicuously cover his sex with his hands. He was thankful for the copious amounts of bubbles he put into his bath.
Tony mewled loudly when Steve’s large warm hand almost engulfed his entire cock, giving long slow strokes. His lips taking their place back on Tony’s neck.
“Y-you do?” Tony whispered as he slowly peeked up at his blonde boyfriend
Once back at the tower the team went their separate ways. Tony having to fight off his handsy lovers in order to be able to go down to his lab and patch up his armor. Steve and Bucky relinquished their hold on the genius with a sigh knowing it was important to Tony and important for the team for Iron Man to be ready for any emergency.
“Don’t worry sweet thing. No matter what happens we’ll be here. We can stop whenever you give the word.”
Bucky reached over slowly and gently grabbed Tony’s chin, tilting his face to look at Bucky. Bucky gasped. The eyes that were usually bright with intelligence and spark were dull and glassy. Tony’s cheeks, Bucky realized, were much to rosy, while the rest of Tony was pale, his hair matted to his forehead with sweat.
“That literally does not clear up any of my past questions Buck, could you be more specific?” Steve deadpanned
“Oh my god!” howled Steve
Both older men moaned, “We can do that baby doll, we can absolutely do that,” moaned Bucky.
“P’zza!” shrieked the small boy
Before Tony could finish his command the door to his workshop opened and in walked two very large, very buff, very hot, and very worried looking supersoldiers.
“I have diabetes. I...can’t recover from something like this.”
“Friend Anthony, you are truly a gifted soul. Who knew one at such a small age could be so masterful.” said Thor
“Steve! Bucky! What are yo-”
Tony turned back to his work, his focus shifting back to the task at hand. Time seemed to be lost as Tony worked, losing track of everything happening around him.
“God,” Bucky groaned, “Lemme see Stevie, lemme see.”
“I just want to pinch those chubby cheeks.” muttered Natasha, big Tony blushed.
“Now ain’t that the prettiest sight you’ve ever seen”
“Perfect Captain. I suggest you look a little closer in the room and I am sure Bucky Bear will be found.” As if waiting for his cue the boy took of running at full speed around the room periodically stopping to make dramatic battle poses and to thrust his shield at assumedly pretend bad guys.
Bucky ‘mmmed; in agreement. “Boy, Cap, I don’t know about you, but that mission kicked my ass, I could sure use a nice soak in the tub, get all relaxed and wet.”
“Yes, Sir?”
The soldiers looked on expectantly for the smaller man to answer, waiting patiently and not pushing for answers.
“Sit back down you dork,” Steve said fondly.
“Hey winter crybaby,” yelled Clint over Bucky’s tirade. “The video is back on.”
“You are absolutely right Buck, don’t think I’ve ever seen anything prettier,” purred Steve.
The music began to fade away leaving Tony slightly breathless at being danced around his workshop. The soldiers didn’t even look winded. Tony was still blushing as Steve and Bucky bracketed him on both sides, Steve in the front and Bucky behind him, singing the last lines softly until the song faded out completely.
Tony only grunted in response making his lovers chuckle. He felt too sleepy and wrung out from what they had just done and he felt too warm and safe wrapped up in his lovers embrace. Sleep was too tempting.
Steve kept up his even strokes of Tony’s cock and the younger boy began to squirm in his grip.
“Does that feel good baby?” voice ghosting over Tony’s ear, feeling him shudder. “You have no idea how hot it makes me, knowing no ones ever touched you like this,” Steve emphasized it with a tight squeeze, making the boys hips move erratically. Steve chuckled.
Carefully standing up and aware of their precious bundle, the soldiers stepped out of the bathtub and dried off their smaller lover. Once dry, Bucky took out one of his and Steve’s shirts and helped maneuver Tony into it. Tony was so small compared to them that the shirt easily covered the top of his ass and reached just the top of his thighs. A possessive thrill ran through him at the image Tony presented. He heard a snort and turned to look at Steve who was smirking knowingly at him. As if he could read the thoughts that were going through his mind.
“Baby I was laughin because after you came, which was absolutely breathtakin’ by the way, you collapsed onto Stevie’s face. You started to smother him,” Bucky responded with a shit eating grin on his face.
“Go right ahead!”
“Where do you think we should check first Tony? The kitchen? I swear I saw Jarvis preparing a fresh batch of cookies and after we show him how beautiful you are we can go have a snuggle and I can tell you a new story about the brave Captain America and his sidekick Bucky-”
Bucky chuckled gazing at the boy asleep in the middle of the bed.
“So it seems you weren’t the only one to not play nice,” said Steve
“Buck, uh, you ok?
Steve sighed, “Alright Bucky, let’s go.”
“Hey! Tony, calm down, don’t worry,” Steve said jostling him gently to get him out of his head. “You’re not ready for that yet and that’s ok. We’ll just use our hands. Is that ok with you baby?”
Bucky sighed thumb stroking Steve’s hip, “I do too, but what we’re doing is what’s goin to get him better. Just be here for him Steve and you’ll help him more than you think.”
“Fight fair Marie!” yelled little Tony as he too disappeared down the hallway. The screen cut to black.
The two women behind the camera quickly approached a closed door at the end of the hall when they heard a gasp from behind the door and the pitter patter of little feet, the door handle turning, door flying open to reveal-
“JARVIS what’s Tony’s temperature now?” asked Steve.
Tony blushed, groaning inwardly, he really thought he was done blushing for the day.
The scene ended and time seemed to have moved on as the Tony on screen wasn’t exactly a baby anymore, but the boy on screen was still so small and still had some of his baby fat on his limbs. The boy was walking on unsteady feet around the room and oh, this time it was Steve’s turn to grab his chest with an almost pained grunt. Little Tony was wearing a Captain America onesie. The onesie had short sleeves and shorts that showed the boys chubby arms and legs. The ensemble also had a hood that was up and covering the boy's head, with wings that matched the ones on his cowl perfectly. There was a collective “aw” from the group gathered and a few snickers at the coincidence.
“That’s because you’re our beautiful angel.” said Steve
“What? What!” asked Tony again pushing his upper body off to look better at his soldiers.
It's Steve's turn to pick the video! He thinks he's picked a good one.
Bucky smiled slyly, “Of course it was, I’m a pro at taking care of small people who are shitty at taking care of themselves.”
A heart wrenching scream filled their ears and the camera dropped from Jarvis’s hands.
Steve smiled, “How could I forget, you were the best nursemaid I’ve ever had...still sad I could never get you in the outfit to match.” Bucky shoved Steve away with a mock glare, Steve chuckling at the look on his face.
Soooo?? Have I lost my touch? ( I hope not) The song Tony sings if you didn't know is called Scaled and Arpeggios from the Aristocats. Look it up. It's cute as hell.
“How do you wanna do it honey? I don’t think you’re ready for our cocks, what do you want? Our hands our our mouths?” asked Steve
“Your fucking programm-I...fuck.”
“Boy, I know you have been in my workshop, your grubby little fingerprints are all over my work! What have I told you about going into my lab?”
“B-bucky! You can’t! That’s, that’s-ah! Steve!”
Steve and Bucky were sitting cuddled together on the couch, shoulders and knees pressed together, hands entwined, watching some sort of action movie. The two of them snickering at the horrible fight scenes and the inaccuracies. They loved watching action movies together as they always made fun of them, the both of them ending up as a big pile of giggling fools. Today was no different as they had quickly fallen into giggling fits. It was a dreary fall day. It had been raining for the past few days, with the rain brought and unbearable chill to the air. It had been absolutely awful the past few days and unfortunately the supersoldiers and their team weren’t lucky enough to have spent those days inside where it was warm and dry.
Tony blushed furiously, not being used to so many compliments “Jeez you guys! Stop!”
The soldiers, watching Tony’s every move, smirked at their adorable lover. Tony had been so shy. When they had first tried to move things up a step, Tony spluttered and uttered an obvious excuse. They chucked it up to new relationship nerves and didn’t push the topic. Their boy would let them know when he was ready. But oh- oh, seeing him laying there vulnerable, naked and wet. They couldn’t help themselves. They needed to touch.
“You two remind me of my brother and I when we were young. What’s a little tussle between friends?” asked Thor
“Buck, I, fuck, I know, I know-that was like pure sugar and I’m 99.9% sure I have developed several cavities that I will be calling my dentist about-but calm down, if it makes you feel better lets talk to him, tonight. I don’t wanna wait anymore either.
“No!” he yelled to the room, “Fuck them they can’t just do that! JARVIS?”
“I-uh, oh god!” groaned Tony, covering his now reddened face with his hands. They had really done that! And now he had been rubbing his cock against Steve’s thigh, while they had been sleeping! Tony heard and felt two twin chuckles against him.
Some time later, Tony heard the sloshing of water and whined.
“Yes, Mama” whispered little Tony. He turned to the piano and started playing.
“Stop that incessant whimpering! Stark’s are made of iron boy!”
“Needy, desperate little thing,” with that Bucky shot down and latched his mouth once again on Tony’s nipple, the other being pulled and squeezed by Bucky’s free hand. The other overlapping Steve’s along Tony’s cock. As if they had planned it the soldiers squeezed and stroked him perfectly in sync, Steve placing hot open mouth kisses all along his jaw. That was it. Tony couldn’t take anymore. All he had to do was let go, so he did.
The warmth at his back began to rumble, “Mm, baby doll, good morning.” Tony stilled instantly as a metal arm wrapped securely around his waist.
Bucky went slow so he wouldn’t shock Tony’s system too much. He new his lover was going to absolutely hate this. The water itself wasn’t even that cold, lukewarm really, but to Tony it would probably feel completely unpleasant. Bucky grimaced at the thought, scowled outright when his predictions were verified when as soon as Tony’s legs were submerged Tony began to whimper in earnest and weakly kick his legs, rolling his head against Bucky’s shoulder. Bucky shushed him.
Well...here you go.
“Home videos!” Clint shrieked “Specifically, a certain genius’s home videos!”
Tony shuddered. Steve leaned down to bump noses with Tony. “He’s right sweetheart. We’re head over heels for ya and we want you to be our fella. No joke.”
Natasha smirked, “Good.”
“I bet you are,” Natasha replied giving Bucky and Steve a knowing look. They both blushed slightly, Bucky grumbling something under his breath that Steve wouldn’t even dare say aloud for fear of his life and Bucky’s and pressed play.
Tony shook his head to get rid of his pinning thoughts for the resident hotties. It hurt just that bit more to know Bucky and Steve watched those videos too. Bucky even helped find them. He was going to work down here for the next few days. He didn’t care if it was an “unhealthy coping mechanism” it works so he’s sticking to it. Even though Bucky and Steve always get worried…
Everyone’s hands shot up, Tony almost standing all the way up on the couch to show his true feelings for his childhood ‘friend’.
“I swear to god Steve your ass is gra-”
“I-want help.”
“Wow is right.” agreed Steve.
All tony could do was mewl in response as Bucky began to suck on the head of his cock making Tony squirm. Bucky grabbed onto his hips keeping him steady.

CLIFF HANGERSSSSSSSSS I've always reading them but doing them as a writer warms a dark part of my hears I didn't know I had? Also! If you want to check out my Tumblr you can? I don't have really anything too interesting and not really any original content. Perhaps if I continue to write fic I'll make a separate account just for those. Check it out! (If you want)
“Stevie,” and oh, his voice sounded choked up as well, “That was the cutest fuckin thing I have ever seen! Did ya see the way he ran around attacking all the bad guys? He was tryin to use his shield just like you do! And Bucky Bear? Are ya serious? They fuckin made those? Do ya think he slept with it all the time? Kill me now Steve! I can’t continue to live now that I know this exists in life! I need him like a fuckin fish needs water! I want to hide him away and never let anything happen to him again! Fuck! I-” Bucky was really working himself up. Steve cupped his hands on both sides of Bucky’s face and placed a chaste kiss on his lips to stop his ranting.
“Tattle tale…” whispered little Tony. Everyone chuckled, even Tony.
Tony screamed when he felt a hard suck on his nipples. The scratchy feeling of Bucky’s stubble. The hot mouth, the pressure! Tony’s hands shot up quickly to twine his fingers in the long strands of Bucky’s hair. Bucky chuckled and gave a long lick to the teased puckered bud.
“Damn straight we did dollface. You gave us a damn fright,” Tony looked chagrined, “But damn, am I glad to see those beautiful brown eyes staring back at me.” Bucky reached up to rub his thumb underneath Tony’s eye smiling fondly at him. Tony smiled shyly back.
God, did he miss them. The stress was getting to him and the best way to relieve it was snuggling up to his giant beefy boyfriends. Their hugs were like magic and made everything bad go away. They’d kiss him sweetly, drag their fingers through his hair making him mewl. He loved when they did that. It always turned him into jelly. Bucky would hold him and Steve would slowly move in to ki-
Like a tree ability will bloom and grow. If you’re smart you’ll learn by heart what every artist knows! You must sing your scales. And your ar-pe-e-e-giooooos!” Little Tony’s finger flew over the keys in one last beautiful flourish as the song came to an end.
“You do?” asked Tony
With those past few days behind them Bucky and Steve relished in their time alone, although having their third locked away left a space only a certain genius could fill. They could be patient. Tony would come back to them once he was finished. He always did.
“Know y’will,” Tony slurred his eyes beginning to fall shut once more, “ L’ve you.”
They stopped in front of Tony’s work station and kept wriggling their hips to the music while also doing weird things with their arms. Then before Tony had time to protest he was hoisted out of his chair and into the arms of his beloveds. Both men looking down at him with besotted eyes. Tony blushed as they continued to sing, caressing him and holding him gently, treating him like he was something precious. Steve and Bucky each took turns dancing with Tony. When one was singing a line Tony was passed to that man. As if each of his beloveds were trying to serenade him. Tony couldn't’ help but blush as he was twirled in between the two larger men. He always felt small when he was in between them.
“Yeah sweetheart, there kind of was, from both sides.” placated Steve.
“Oh, sweet thing,” moaned Bucky, “That’s the hottest thing you’ve ever said.”
“Same buddy, same,” replied Bruce.
“Aw Tony, are you embarrassed?” asked Bruce with a smirk on his face
Bruce cleared his throat looking bemused and pointing to Clint and Thor rummaging through the movies. “If you two lovebirds don’t mind, there are more home videos to watch.”
Steve was the first to speak up, “This was wrong. We all knew it was wrong but we didn’t think about how Tony would feel. We should have asked.”
“ ‘ucky beh!” the little boy said in a very serious tone.
Warm. It was warm. Tony hummed his approval. He felt warm and safe. A soft comforting weight was at his back and another at his front. He felt loose and sated. He had the best dream. His lovers showed him what it was like to feel pleasure. Steve’s lips on his neck, Bucky’s on his chest. Their skin rubbing slick together from the warm bath water. Their hands together on his cock.
Tony whimpered into Bucky’s mouth as he plundered and took. His tongue mapping out the spaces of his mouth, making Tony weak. Tony reached his hand up to grab onto Steve’s neck when he felt the larger man begin to suck a mark where neck meets shoulder. Nibbling and sucking the soft skin.
“I think it’s best we go into blackout-”
The soldiers began getting ready for bed as Tony slept on. The silence comforting and companionable.
“That is a wonderful idea! We absolutely must show Jarvis.” declared Peggy. Leaning down she took Tony’s small hand and began leading him out of his parent’s bedroom to go look for the family butler.
“Ditto,” replied Bucky just as wrecked and awed at what they were witnessing on the big screen. In glorious HD was baby Tony, laying down in what looked to be a swinging basket of some sort. His big, expressive eyes were staring right into the screen, or more likely the person filming behind the camera. Steve was pretty sure the woman’s voice that he heard belonged to the one and only Maria Stark, but he wasn’t sure, and Steve swore he could just about count the his bottom eyelashes. They were so long and if Steve wasn’t enamored before he was completely lost to the cuteness. A quick look over at Bucky and the rest of the group confirmed that Steve wasn’t the only one who had fallen under the spell of baby Tony.
“Sir, perhaps you should calm down and-”
Well!? Did you like the ending? I can't write smut I'm sorry!! Thanks for sticking around!
“What the FUCK is going on here?” yelled a sudden voice. The Avengers all winced as they knew all too well who the voice belonged to. Tony Stark, genius, friend, and extremely pissed off Iron Man stood next to the elevator his face twisted into something awful, his posture radiating fury.
Tony began to whimper until it choked off into a moan. Bucky was rubbing his hands up and down his chest, rubbing his thumbs in small circles as he went.
“Bucky? You ok?” asked Steve.
Finally little Tony got himself situated at the piano and then began to slowly crack each finger to prepare himself to play. Making the little girl look on in disgust.
“We got it Bucky, you want to get into his pants.” replied Bruce looking all too amused.
Tony blushed, he seemed to be doing that a lot today “Uh, thanks Thor,” he mumbled
“And that the sexual tension and pinning looks can finally end.” replied an amused Bruce. The supersoldiers chuckled while Tony blushed furiously.
“Oh no, big guy, we weren’t friends. Nor were we ever friends. She tormented me for years and I’m pretty sure our mothers were crossing their fingers we’d fall madly in love and get married.” Tony visibly shuddered at the idea
“Love you Tony” both said
“Not even a ‘hey’? I think our baby boy has forgotten how to talk, Bucky.”
“It may be too late for ‘should have’ but we still have time for doin.” Bucky said “Steve, let’s go down and talk to him. We can’t leave him down there alone. I know he’s a capable adult, but...I’m worried he’s gonna do somethin stupid.”
“I again, can’t even right now,” said Thor.
Everyone got back into place once the next movie was picked. There had been a short argument between Clint and Thor about which one they should watch next, but Thor quickly shot it down with one hard stare and a flex of his arms.
Little Tony put down his slice and started stomping in place, a huge saucy grin on his face. He stuck up both tiny fists with his thumbs up and screamed.
“Oh my god Tony, how old do you think you were there?” asked Steve.
“Your cock is so wet for us sweetheart, weepin so pretty in my hand.”
“Buck I don’t think we’re gonna be wanted around right now.”
After a few moments Steve picked up the body wash and began lathering over whatever parts Steve could reach of Tony’s body, wiping away all the sweat and grime. Bucky copying Steve, reached over to grab the shampoo and began working up a thick lather. Tilting Tony’s head back Bucky began to massage his scalp, making sure to drag his nails across his crown the way he knew that Tony liked.
“Very helpful Tony,” Natasha replied dryly.
“BABY TONY, STEVE! FOR THE LOVE OF ODIN BABY TONY!” Clint shouted over Steve, he wasn’t above playing a little dirty and it was the right card to play. It was almost comical with how fast Steve’s face melted from firm, responsible team leader, to besotted fool, to that of a torn man.
“That sweet huh?”
Tony whined pitifully and tried to hide behind his hands again, Bucky sensing this took a gentle hold of the younger boys hands, bringing the backs to his mouth and leaving sweet kisses to the back. Tony gave a small smile a the gesture.
“Wait, wait! What’s going o-aaAH!”
“I’m younger than you,” mumbled Steve.
“Yeah, but, it’s-it’s embarrassing!” squeaked Tony, refusing to move his hands away from his face. As if hiding would make this all go away.
“If I’ve told you once, I’ve told you a hundred times, stay away from my work boy! If nothing is going to get through to you then we’ll have to do something else!” Howard bellowed. Little Tony was in tears at this point and his whimpers were quickly growing louder and louder. During this whole exchange the camera began to droop lower and lower as Jarvis seemed to forget he had the camera going.
Just then the Avengers heard the elevator ding. Turning their heads the doors open and they were met with the smug looks of two large soldiers and one timid happy look from their small genius. Looking down the Avengers noticed all three of them were holding hands.
Steve looked panicked “Tony! We can explain!”
“Aye, Tony is the most beautiful of midgardians!”
Steve and Bucky settled down soon after, closing their eyes both of them almost asleep knowing their loved ones were safe and in bed.
Tony climbed back up to the head of the bed and resituated himself onto the pillows. He may be overreacting but he did love his soldiers. To do something like this for him without judgement...meant a lot to him. Somehow he wanted to show his thanks to them.
“You guys are ridiculous! Uptown girl? Seriously? And calling me a girl? What’s up with that?” Tony yelled over the music.
Tony sighed again, just thinking about his boyfriends made him giddy. At first he was sceptical and shocked to say the least that the two older men, who just so happened to be famous super soldiers were interested in him. Not just for money, or reputation or-or the sex. But for him.
Steve grinned “So, can we take it that you’ve forgiven us for watching the videos without your permission?”.
“Ugh, if he keeps getting more adorable with age I’m not sure I can keep going without some sort of medical assistance. Bruce quick! Check my vitals, I feel faint. The cold grip of death is upon me and it’s all Tony’s fault.” Clint groaned from the sprawl he made on the floor. At some point he had melted onto the floor from the couch due to the cuteness Tony presented.
“Then it is up to the great Captain America to rescue his friend. Where did your shield go? Captain America needs his shield if he is going to be going on a daring mission.”
Bucky moaned sending shockwaves through Tony when he clenched around his tongue. Tony sobbed. The sensations were too much. Steve sucking roughly then sliding his mouth up until just the tip rested inside, suckling softly. It was driving Tony mad. The two older men continued to torment Tony, building up a rhythm. Bucky would plunge his tongue inside, as deep as he could go, while Steve would suck on the head, driving Tony insane. Then they would switch. Steve would be sucking him in deep, his cock nudging the back of his throat, while Bucky gave torturous little kitten licks all around his hole, not giving him what he desired. It was as if they rehearsed it. His soldiers were so in sync with each other, they were surely going to kill him.
“I don’t mind waiting!”
Bucky popped his head back up with a look of absolute betrayal on his face. Steve laughed even harder.
With an ear splitting wail Tony came. His whole body seized up, back and legs taught, moaning out his lovers names over and over like a prayer. He could distantly feel Bucky and Steve moving against him, moving against each other, until they too stilled, twin moans falling from their mouths.
Once the two women were off camera the children were left alone. Little Tony glanced over nervously at Marie.
They both jumped apart and blushed slightly at being caught. Natasha, the one who called them out, smirked.
The poor boy wasn’t able to finish his sentence. Not even waiting for his response Steve wasted no time and swallowed his lovers smaller cock down to the root, sucking roughly. Tony whimpered and mewled taking in huge gulps of air when he remembered to breathe.
“Tony, from all of us, we’re all really sorry for going behind your back” said Bruce.
“Can we take a vote and unanimously agree that this is by far the cutest shit any of us have ever seen?” asked Clint
“and his gang of Howling Commandos.” Tony gasped, all sadness from earlier leaving and being replaced by sheer giddiness.
“Yeah baby doll, you looked so sweet, seeking pleasure in your sleep, using Stevie to get you there.” murmured Bucky against Tony’s ear, making Tony squirm.
Bucky grabbed onto Tony gently and urged him to turn over, lifting up his hips. Exposing Tony to Bucky’s greedy eyes. Bucky moaned at the sight. His lover was so adorable and yet so unbelievably sexy.
“Shut up.” The team laughed ignoring Tony’s sputtering.
“Oh sweetheart, if only you could see yourself. You’re sweet little hole looks so pretty.”
After a few more minutes the men pulled back, just enough for them to breathe, but not far enough to let go of each other. All three were breathless, not sure who would speak first.
Tony squinted his eyes in concentration trying to remember what could possibly be on the tape. “Yeah,” he replied slowly, “I think that one’s ok.”
“Yeah?”
“Agreed.”
“The hell! That’s it?”
“Dear God, not again.”
Tony thought for a moment. Steve and Bucky, as well as the rest of the team seemed to really be enjoying the videos. And if Tony was being honest with himself, he did too. He felt constantly warm with the compliments and adorations for his baby self. He felt loved. With a shake of his head Tony made his choice.
“Tony, man, it was my fault. If you have to be mad at anyone here be mad at me.” Clint apologized. Seeing how much this was affecting his friend, guilt had quickly taken hold of him. He had not expected for this to go sour and had only expected some light teasing but not this. Never this.
“Tony my dear, would you like to tell the audience what we will be making today?” asked Jarvis
Looking into the camera with those big eyes was little Tony. His whole face was lit up in excitement obviously caused by the knowledge that his Aunt was here to see him. What had gotten Clint to call out was what Tony was wearing. He seemed to be wearing a large shirt, and upon closer inspection looked more like something a woman would wear, and looked more like a dress going by the straps and lace. Adorning Tony’s small wrists were expensive looking bracelets and around his neck hung a string of pearls that was almost too big for the boy and was slipping off one of his shoulders. Lipstick was smeared all over his face and in one of his hands he held what must have been a purse. All of the things Tony had must have belonged to his mother.
“Your cock is so soft baby boy, so soft and wet. God, Bucky I can fit my whole hand around ‘im”
“Oh” was all Tony could say
“Tony-” Steve started
“Marie-” Before little Tony could finish his sentence Marie jumped up and pushed his head onto the piano making a loud chord of notes. Jumping down herself she quickly ran out of the room, little Tony quick to follow.
The playing came to a peak and slowly went back to a slow easy tempo as everyone in the room began to sing.
“Don’t worry Tones, we can help. Come here baby,” cooed Steve, not waiting for Tony to move and simply held him under the arms and lifted him onto his lap, exposing his cock to the air. He shuddered and blushed.
“Turn ‘im around Steve, I need to wash his back.”
