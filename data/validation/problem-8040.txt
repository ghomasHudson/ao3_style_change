be on the team?’
Tony frowns and looks down at his chest. His shirt is ripped and there’s gouges in his chest where the arc reactor used to be. ‘Huh. Did I do that?’
‘They what?’ Sam asks.
‘Yet he still never listens when we tell him the same thing,’ Steve laughs, coming up on Rhodes’ other shoulder. ‘How are you doing, Ma’am? Having a good Christmas so far?’
‘Hey I thought we were boxing?’ Bucky scowls. ‘What’s with the dirty moves Rogers?’
‘I wasn’t.’
‘I’m not sure. It’s felt like days, but it could have just been an hour or two. I…I can’t use my magic,’ she bites her bottom lip and looks around her cell. For the first time since waking up Bucky sees the fear on her face. ‘I tried when I first woke up to see if I could get us out but I can’t do anything. I don’t know what’s happened…’
‘Yeah,’ he smiles and presses a kiss to her head, before letting his eyes drift close. ‘I think you might have hit the nail on the head there, Rosie. Hey Karen? Wake me up if anything changes with Rosie.’
Tony stills and frowns. ‘What do you mean he’s not in the facility?’
‘We need to get to Peter’s school,’ he says, already heading to his suit.
a regular human? What about if you face someone who can move as fast as you, or faster?’
He’s not sure what makes him say the next part. ‘Maybe in the future, when I know you a bit better. But for now I don’t think its a good idea.’
‘Of course, Point Break,’ Tony smiles at him, ‘you guys are a part of this team, so it’s only right we try and celebrate as much of your traditions as we can, especially as you’ll be celebrating ours.’ Thor lets lose a laugh and pulls Tony into a hug that has Bruce wincing in sympathy.
Tony says nothing, but he’s gone very still at the counter, whatever he had been going to get is forgotten and he’s hanging on Steve’s every word.
leap.’
‘I hardly think they’re going to argue that at the event,’ Steve crosses his arms.
‘Like what?’
,’ Peter almost shouts. ‘People
scrawny,’ he pouts. It takes a bit of coaxing for him to finish the story, admitting to how he got Wade to agree to removing the no-kissing rule.
‘Because I’m Iron Man.’
‘Pete,’ Sam cuts across the teenager’s response, ‘don’t worry about it alright? We promise to keep your Spider-Man identity secret.’
the shitty reason you have for not trying for Tony? For not pushing more with Loki?’ Sam demands, tone furious.
‘Seriously?’ Peter blinks in surprise. ‘Me?’
Peter blushes. ‘That was
‘Shall we head towards Peter’s school? It probably wouldn’t hurt to be a little early,’ Steve suggests.
‘I will point out,’ Loki says from his spot on the sofa, ‘that you are wasting time arguing about the Spiderling’s affections when the being capable of destroying half of the universe is on his way here.’
‘Not if we end up in a firefight,’ Tony argues, ‘he’d just get stuck trying to reach us.’
‘You should have learned never turn your back on an opponent unless they’re dead. Especially if they’re one renowned for pulling tricks,’ Loki growls and shoves his brother’s body off of the ice sword and watches it fall to the ground. ‘And I do not take well to people threatening my friends.’
Peter chuckles. ‘If you want me to come back, you’ll call and tell me? I don’t mind cutting my trip short if you want me back. Just as long as it’s not because you’re going into over-protective mode.’
‘Alright kids break it up,’ Natasha laughs. ‘Pete can do whatever he wants. It’s his party.’
He feels the bullets ripping up the tarmac behind him, showering the back of his legs with sharp stones. Then one hits his leg and he stumbles, curling his body around Wanda’s to protect her.
He shrugs. ‘Never really came up before, and how do you just randomly bring it up in conversation?’
Tony groans as the channel lands on a daytime chat show, the title at the bottom reads: ‘Does Tony Stark have a long lost son?’ The entire team turning up to watch Peter’s presentation has sparked a myriad of theories, ranging from the one he is currently watching, to people thinking he’s grooming the boy to become the next Iron Man.
‘Sir I suggest you keep him cuffed until you reach the facility. He’ll be easier to control.’
‘Gaps can be left where there shouldn’t be one,’ Bucky continues the explanation, ‘or they can leave us without backup because they don’t realise we can’t actually manage on our own.’ Then he grins. ‘They also need to learn what distracts certain team members so they can make allowances for that.’
Not knowing how long it’s going to take Bucky and Steve to reach them Loki decides to play along this once, thankful for the time he has spent with Vision in the training room. ‘Very well,’ he lets his Asgardian form melt away, revealing the Jotun one hidden beneath. He still doesn’t feel fully comfortable like this, and he tries not to look over to see Tony’s reaction.
‘Oh god please don’t.’
, Tony.’ Steve lowers his head close to Tony’s, resting their foreheads together, so all he can see is Steve. ‘We got a life to start remember? Don’t leave me now, love,
‘The day you’re out of my hair and onto the front lines where some lucky bastard gets to shoot you, Rogers, is the day I most look forwards to,’ he snaps, before stomping down the corridor to bang on the other soldiers’ doors, hollering for them to come down to the living room.
‘I think I know who this is from,’ Peter grins.
‘Well we all appeared back on Titan and then Doctor Strange started doing his fizzy magic thing and said we had to get back to Earth and get everyone else because you guys would be up here and need some help. So we went back to Wakanda, which by the way is
,’ Sharon’s voice is laced with venom. ‘If she meant so much to you why did you not come to her funeral?’
‘When we were in the lab.’
Steve blinks and it’s as if the scene changes before his eyes. It’s a young boy of four or five in front of him, Howard on one side and Monty on the other with cards between them on the table. Dum Dum is pouring some more whiskey for the players as Gabe, Morita and Jacques have a quiet discussion at the other end of the table. It almost feels that if he could hold on to the picture a little longer Maria Stark and Peggy Carter would walk in, smiling indulgently at the little boy who would have them wrapped around his little finger as he asked to join his father and uncles in their card game.
Loki has to agree; most of its fur is grey and white, but it has a mask of black across its eyes making its blue eyes stand out even more. The pup stands on its back legs, putting its paws up onto his chest and gives his cheek a lick.
‘Sounds good to me. They aren’t armed are they?’
‘If we get to go to Nidavellir we’re helping,’ the rabbit interjects.
intrigued,’ he responds.
‘That’s my job, Ms Parker,’ Tony says quietly. ‘If we can work together we can keep him safe.’ He’s very aware that Peter can probably hear everything they’re saying but he doesn’t let that stop him. ‘When I heard Peter was one of the hostages I’ll admit I was scared. I was scared he’d do something, well incredibly
‘A challenge! Excellent, when can we start?’ Drax roars in approval.
‘I know,’ he gasps, ‘but we only have one chance to beat this bastard. We can’t stop now. My suit is the only thing that can harness the power of the stones.’
‘I realised it wasn’t real just after that but…it still stung you know? And it was all based on something I was scared of being true anyway. It was like when Venom first got control of me and was feeding my fears back to me to try and get control, but they’d been put into a video right in front of me. So then when Mr Harris said the school was coming here and I hadn’t known…’
Then it changes. Instead of the shock of electricity running through his veins he can feel the sting of a thousand tiny needles piercing his skin. There’s another voice crying out with his own.
Tony looks away, blinking at the tears gathering in his eyes. ‘Not sure how I feel about that. You’ve made a lot of promises to me before.’
‘Wade. I don’t know what to do about Wade.’
taking part?’
‘What does your face have to do with a date?’
‘Are you more worried about losing control of your powers or about hurting someone if you overreach?’
Bucky grins at the look on Tony’s face. ‘He didn’t, did he?’
‘Very funny,’ he mutters.
,’ Steve warns, fully Captain tone in play.
‘Hear me, and rejoice,’ the cosplayer calls, acting as if he’s a herald in a fantasy film. ‘You are about to die at the hands of the children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now i-’
‘So? That’s all you can say: so?’ he nearly screams.
Tony isn’t sure what he feels at those words and he and Peter scramble for the door. ‘Get her inside FRI!’ he shouts as he runs. ‘Get Steve and Sam. Go through every single camera she’s passed in the last forty-eight hours and make sure she hasn’t been followed.’
‘A car crash,’ the doctor looks at the table top instead of up at them, ‘I used to be a brain surgeon but the nerve damage was so extensive that I couldn’t practise. I searched everywhere for a cure and that led me to Kamar-Taj.’
he couldn’t quite make himself beg - with the Secretary General and the rest of the appointed UN Council, slowly getting changes.
‘Wait, what?’ Steve asks, feeling alarm burning in his chest.
‘I do technology. Not pens. Not for this amount of time.’
‘I have a favour to ask you.’
The wizards of Kamar-Taj are causing mayhem amongst the enemy, and are doing a lot to help keep them disorientated and allowing their side to stay on top; the Wakandans are fighting with a ferocity and skill that Bucky has rarely seen elsewhere, at the thick of it are the King’s Guard, the women wielding their weapons and decimating their foes in a way that almost puts Natasha to shame. The Jotuns are advancing steadily, their king near the front, and dealing icy death to all who come near them, their limbs are caked in blood, and the wounded are frozen beneath their feet as they continue their march onwards.
He shakes his head and huffs another laugh. ‘Nope. You continue your little dance lesson and I’ll go practise my climbing.’
‘Do you think I would have agreed to this if I wasn’t?’ he retorts, pulling the sunglasses from his face.
‘You threatened to maim high schoolers,’ Tony points out, ‘I dread to think what you’d do to a mercenary given half the chance.’
‘Ness?’
He’s saved from answering by Mr Harris entering the classroom. ‘Alright everyone settle down! I know you’re excited, but before we get ready to go to the Avengers Facility I want to introduce you all to our new student. He’s just arrived here and I think this trip is going to be a great opportunity for you all to get to know him and to make him feel welcome. I’d like someone to volunteer to be his ‘buddy’ for the first day,’ Mr Harris gestures for the person at the door to enter. ‘Everyone this is-’
‘Aww you’d tear down your lab just to stop little old me? I feel so special. This is much better than flowers and chocolates. I do think the traditional gifts are just so boring now aren’t they? So unimaginative.’
When they turn the corner MJ starts opening a classroom door for them to hide in and Ned turns to him, a frown on his face. ‘Just friends, huh? Since when do you have his number? Also that looked a hell of a lot like more than friends to me! And you told him your name!’
I may take a quick break after the next instalment to do one or two short stories away from the series just while I try and firm up what direction the series is going in, so if you have any requests for any different pairings or scenarios do let me know.
‘Ok well let me tell you what the school told me then, shall I? That for a week you were either late with, or didn’t actually complete your homework assignments. And you missed half a day of school just before this all started.’
‘I imagine it hurt to hear just as much as the shield did for you.’ After a pause he adds. ‘He also has dreams of Peter being crushed under piles of rubble and he can’t do anything to save him.’
‘You heard me, blondie.
As always here's your sneak peek:
Rocket looks down from his perch in the trees, sighing and shaking his head. ‘Those two idiots? They make far too much noise to be stealthy. Why send them?’ He sighs again and begins climbing down, ready to reset the traps once the two idiots below him set them off.
‘I mean you were dumb enough to think he’d listen,’ Natasha points out to Steve.
do. I see that wormhole almost every night, I see what was coming for us through that thing almost every night. It’s one of the reasons I don’t sleep well,’ he notices Loki grimace and look down, ‘and the one who made it all happen is finally ready to bring his big guns. This guy has been in my head for ten years; I want him gone and I want us all to still be around to celebrate when he is.’
‘Oh good,’ Steve groans and Bucky laughs at him.
‘Alright,
He sighs. ‘Don’t you think I’ve already had a freak out about this? I spoke to Wade yesterday when we were cleaning up after dinner; he genuinely cares about Pete, I’d go so far as to say he’d to
‘I wonder the opposite,’ Peter mutters to himself as he heads towards the bedrooms; he waves through the door to Scott and Hope, helping Cassie to unpack, and tells them of the new arrivals.
‘Thanks Mr Wilson,’ the kid says, stealing the ball from his hands and jumping off, throwing the ball to Bucky as he does. Tony feels his heart jump into his throat as the kid gets closer to the ground, and only breathes a sigh of relief when Steve manages to catch him before he hits the ground.
‘Well I wouldn’t say “happy” is the best word to describe it. Let’s just say I’ve got a lot of making up to do in the future.’
‘They decided to settle it by who got the most kills during their time with the Commandos. I actually looked up their confirmed kills to find out who won the bet.’
‘I was just trying to make her feel better,’ Bucky whines, wincing as she applies antiseptic to his cut.
to you,’ he rolls his eyes, ‘you’ve lost how many times to me now?
The three of them all share a laugh at how annoyed Peter sounds.
‘I had proof mine was true.’
‘You aren’t the one Steve sent down to the post room on the first of December to pick up the packages. There’s a big box down there I need to go back for as well,’ he responds, turning and heading back out the door.
Steve just laughs and waves goodbye to Sam as the man leaves. ‘Do I need to tell Sam to stay out? We’ve been told you can’t have too much stress or excitement until the doctors are happy for you to be released.’
He turns to look at the other two. ‘I’m also going to suggest that, whilst we’re getting everyone back, no one goes out alone.’
Tony chuckles and brings up one of the files. ‘This one might interest you as well, Loki, it’s a dig at some caves in Norway.’
‘What’s the situation?’ Tony asks as they enter the briefing room, Rhodes is already sat at the long table, a tablet in his hands. Vision hasn’t arrived yet.
‘Ok so why don’t we get all your people settled into rooms?’ Tony suggests to Thor. ‘Wanda, Vis? Can you two get them all settled into rooms on the guest level? Keep them all in the east wing of the compound, it attracts the least amount of attention. We’ll meet you in the common area when you’re done. Have FRIDAY get some food ordered in and delivered to the guest common area and they can eat and drink while we work out what the hell is going on.’
‘Sure thing, boss,’ the AI responds as the doors to the vehicle are kicked open and gunmen start to jump down.
‘Alright let’s get moving,’ Bucky suggests, ‘the sooner we get to Wade’s flat the sooner we can get home and rest.’
‘The holographic illusions are making it difficult for me to tell for certain who is in there, Doctor Banner.’
‘It was May,’ he struggles to stop his breath from catching. ‘I was at the mugging. He stepped in to save
Peter tunes him out and tries to relax his hands from the tight fists in his lap.
Tony leans back against the kitchenette counter, surveying the destruction in the common area. There’s wrapping paper everywhere, with piles of opened presents and plates, now mostly empty, that had been holding snacks and mince pies. He chuckles as he watches Peter taking a swipe at Bucky, only to be ambushed by Wade. The initially frosty pair had managed to bond over winding up the youngest team member. It had started with Wade trying to test how much the teenager’s wall-sticking ability applied to anything other than walls by throwing pieces of wrapping paper at him. As soon as some had become stuck he’d started throwing more and more at the teen, which caused the teen to become more and more aggravated, at which point Bucky had joined in. Apparently it was the new way to make friends.
‘Why do all my AI systems learn sarcasm?’ he pushes away from the table and makes his way towards the stairs. ‘Well, now it’s time to warn the rest of the team.’
‘A spot of friendly competition, my dear Fury,’ he grins, climbing to his feet. ‘Although dear Carol was not impressed with my catching her unawares by the mistletoe at the glasses rack.’
‘Seriously? I look like Freddy Kreuger hate fucked an Egyptian mummy.’
‘Let us know and someone will come help you get him out. Whoever gets him, get him on the Quinjet. Tony is our number one priority tonight; any extra destruction we can cause along the way is a bonus.’
Sam pops thee trunk and hands the super soldiers an axe each, letting them start to walk towards the entrance before handing Quill his one and locking the car. ‘Hey, you alright man? I imagine this is a lot to take in.’
‘If I wanted your advice I’d have asked for it,’ Harry’s tone is cold. ‘I know exactly what you’re going to say Thompson, I’ve heard it out of every spoilt, stuck-up rich kid’s mouth I’ve had the misfortune to be forced to spend my time with. I don’t need to hear it from another one.’
‘If it wasn’t for DUM-E,’ he cuts across Steve, ‘I wouldn’t have made it down to the reactor Pepper had had mounted and got it in my chest.’ The robot in question gives a whir of happiness. ‘Don’t think that means you’re forgiven for the fire extinguishers,’ he warns the robot, who just hangs its arm in defeat. He then tells them how they managed to defeat Obi, and watching the man fall to his death. How he still has nightmares of the man reaching over him to remove the reactor from his chest and leaving him to die slowly and alone.
‘You obviously haven’t as you’re here,’ Sam counters.
‘Nice try,’ Tony gives the soldier’s leg a consolatory pat.
‘Right then,’ Rocket shrugs, ‘a whole month of wasting time and money it is then. What’s first?’
‘Nat!’
‘Oh sorry, of course,’ Peter moves along and the blind man slides in next to him; he notices Loki giving the two of them interested glances and wonders how he’s going to keep the man’s other identity a secret from the trickster. Loki was very good at hiding what he knew when he wanted to be, and also very good at reading other people. ‘Loki this is Matt Murdoch, from the law firm in town; Matt this is Loki.’
‘I’m sorry, too,’ Peter says, looking back up at the older man.
‘I’m not happy either,’ Steve says, ‘but since everyone else is willing to give him a chance I will. He makes
‘He moved in with the Avengers,’ Ned cuts across him, making him bang his head on the desk in exasperation.
‘Unless it’s offering your backside as a place to store my shoes you can forget it,’ Natasha spits at him.
‘Yeah, Pete?’
‘Nothing, just relax and focus on me,’ Strange replies, ‘in an attempt to make this slightly less distressing for you I shall not place my hands on your head. Do you mind placing your hands in mine?’
‘If Beck was working with HYDRA,’ Peter finds his voice again, ‘they could have access to his tech. In which case they really could be hiding next door and we wouldn’t know.’
Bucky just sighs a laugh and shakes his head. ‘Come on, Stevie, we need to get your fella back. Then I’m actually going to teach you how to get past the staring stage of a relationship.’
Rhodes’ hand gets pulled from his and he opens his mouth to shout for the other man, but only ends up coughing as he inhales the dust. He’s fully free from the hole and he struggles out of the grip of the other hands on him.
He takes out the brochure for the dance school, which is only about a fifteen minute walk from his school, and starts going through the pages. ‘I can’t believe it. How did you remember something like that?’
‘Still don’t see why I can’t come,’ the teenager points out.
‘Fair,’ Clint nods. ‘Now stay there while I find a way to send him out.’
‘Nick would be one,’ he replies, ‘he’s got the most experience building and maintaining an information network, plus he’s dealt with various councils and has experience leading the team before. Steve would be another.’
‘Why don’t you call in the Avengers?’ Ned asks, shooting a worried glance at the masked man who’s guarding them.
‘Peter, this is different-’
Steve’s worried. Physically Tony is healing well and the doctors are happy with his progress; what has Steve worried is the blank look that is now an almost permanent fixture on the usually animated features. Peter’s the only one who can get more than a quirk of the lips out of the man, but even that takes a lot of work.
It’s not a question. He and the mercenary hold each other’s gaze for a few moments before the other man sighs and, looking back at the plates stacked on the side, just nods.
‘Tony
‘Oh you’re in trouble alright. Starting with how Loki knew before I did, and ending with how many other people know?’ Natasha frowns again.
‘Is something wrong with Strange?’ he asks, getting what amounts to a nod in response. ‘Lead the way.’ It flies along the corridor and Loki hurries after it, taking out his daggers and letting his armour fall into place as he follows.
‘Un-aliving some gang members,’ he responds, voice harder now. Peter doesn’t say anything in response. ‘I don’t take contracts unless it’s people on the wrong side of the law, baby boy. Not anymore.’
‘Ow! Alright, alright,’ he puts her down and closes the baby gate to the kitchen. ‘Geez, there’s no need to damage my hearing. Hey! No! No don’t play with that. That is not a toy that is my- mph!’ Rosie manages to get his web shooter, which
‘And now the person on this end of the line,’ Loki explains, ‘weaves their way between everyone else,’ he breathes a sigh of relief when Valkyrie performs the step flawlessly as he continues to explain, ‘to the opposite end and everyone else moves up.’ He finds himself face to face with the Winter Soldier. ‘And then we repeat the steps.’
‘Just greeting an old friend,’ Bucky answers.
‘Now you’re just sounding more like your brother.’
‘He’s definitely an improvement on your boyfriend.’
‘Was he this excitable on Asgard or is he being especially so this year because we’re doing it on Earth?’ the inventor asks.
‘Yes my king,’ she bows, taking hold of the Tesseract and disappearing.
‘Everyone’s happy? Tony I’m not-’ Tony cuts Steve off with a kiss then rolls his eyes and shoves him towards the bar. Bucky chuckles and goes to join Sam and Rhodes in a conversation.
‘I take it his personality isn’t as shining as his charitable donations.’
‘Pete let her breathe!’ he pants as they come to a stop at the bottom of the stairs. Steve barely lets Peter step away before he’s bringing Wanda into his own hug. Wanda, Tony notices, is looking a little lost with all of the attention. ‘Let’s get you upstairs,’ he steps forwards, putting an arm around her shoulders and leading her along, ‘and we’ll get you something to eat and drink. God it’s good to see you, Wanda.’
‘Do the Avengers know you’re here?’
Bucky groans to Loki. -
‘Fuck the Accords, Stevie,’ Bucky says, coming up to them with burning eyes. ‘Tony’s missing, we need all the help we can get to bring him back.’
She shakes her head. ‘Nothing. It’s like they’re ignoring me until…’
‘Not for long enough apparently,’ there’s a small answering smile on the soldier’s lips as he leans back down.
‘What’s the plan, Spidey?’
A/N: Hi everyone! I would say I bet you didn't see that coming - but I'm sure you probably did. So Loki is now king of Jotunheim. As always please do let me know what you think about this chapter. I am about to post the second chapter of the week now, so there won't be any sneak peeks just yet.
‘Then I suggest,’ comes a deep voice from behind her. ‘That this time you do not let something come between you all.’
. He shoots back.
Quill’s face lights up. ‘I remember playing that as a kid! That was awesome!’
‘So,’ Tony says, letting the helmet snap back into place, ‘who wants Squidward and who wants tall, butch and ugly?’
No one says anything the rest of the ride home, but when Natasha stands to go back to help patch up some scrapes on the two soldiers she rests a hand on his arm for a couple of moments. He takes it and gives it a squeeze in silent thanks.
. Like stuff that I think Loki and Thor would have only
There’s another pause. ‘What if I
Tony shakes his head. ‘I don’t need to say anything do I?’
‘Cancer.’
He turns to see who had been deemed worthy and blinks in surprise. ‘
Love to you all,
Mama Rhodes’ arrival at the compound was met with a lot of noise. Rhodes and Tony are the first ones down to greet the older lady, making a fuss of her and asking how her trip was, Tony making sure he’s the one to grab her suitcases.
‘He has a point,’ Loki adds. ‘It would be unwise to keep all the stones together. I would advise no more than three on any one planet.’
‘There are a lot of traditions,’ Mantis comments.
‘I know that man,’ he gasps out, tears running down his face.
‘Huh, well thanks Loki,’ Wade chuckles, ‘and you’re welcome.’
?’ Strange asks incredulous.
‘So Rocket has traps through the forest right?’ Natasha processes the information. ‘Hope’s in the ventilation system keeping an eye out for Peter or Scott. Think you two would be able to help us through the trees so we can miss the traps on the floor?’
Wanda studies him for a few moments. ‘Do you trust me to be able to control them?’
‘-he makes out he single-handedly saved us all from Thanos-’
‘Hey,’ Wade’s voice loses it’s teasing and turns soft as he puts a finger under his chin to make him look up again, ‘the only ones you seem to have encouraged so far are the ones who know who you are: kids whose
of them? I mean I get you haven’t really done polyamory outside of the bedroom, but why didn’t you think about giving it a go?’
‘Hey!’ the merc protests, then he frowns at Wanda. ‘You made me lose my goodbye kiss.’
Natasha’s feels her heart clench at the implied threat and stands up before either of the soldiers can make it worse. ‘We’ll bring you what you deserve, Hammer,’ she says. ‘I’ll send a message when we’re ready to this number.’
‘Oh just go,’ Wanda sticks her tongue out at him as he follows the woman.
‘Yes,’ he replies, before signalling for the man to be quiet as he listens to their conversation. ‘Sounds like they just did a drug deal and they’re about to head back to their base. You fancy giving me a hand Mr. I-Want-To-Turn-Over-A-New-Leaf?’
‘Sure you will Big Guy, but you got to get it off me first!’ she laughs, letting go and falling down his back, landing nimbly on her feet and racing off towards the facility where, a few moments later she sees Loki appear carrying the second flag. He teleports next to her, handing it over, before disappearing again with a quick ‘good luck’. One day she’s going to have to hear the story about why he’s so nervous around Hulk.
‘Let’s just see what he has to say first, Drax,’ the human sighs, ‘then we can make our decision as a group alright?’
Clint visibly pales. ‘You have no proof that was me, everyone thinks its Loki.’
Tony sighs. ‘I don’t do realistic very well, you should know that after I made an arc reactor in a cave.’
decision. And it is
‘Ok we are
Peter squeezes his hand. ‘I understand why you didn’t. Now go see Fury.’
‘And that is not comforting in the slightest,’ she sighs, shaking her head.
‘But you can’t lie to save your life, how did you not spill?’ Peter demands.
‘So she was so important to you as a child, but as soon as you became an adult you decided you didn’t need her anymore and just forgot about her, huh? You don’t deserve that gun, Stark,’ Sharon spits at him, ‘that gun was her most precious possession. It should be with someone who actually gave a damn about her-’
‘True,’ Steve chuckles, ‘I bet none of us look our best. What with Thanos, and all the stuff with the new Accords. Tony why didn’t you mention anything before to anyone?’
‘Back on topics,’ Wanda rolls her eyes. ‘We need one for each of the Guardians, so: Rocket, Groot, Drax-’
‘Let us have the Soul Stone,’ Quill speaks up, ‘it might be the only chance we have of getting Gamora back.’
‘I…of course, brother,’ Loki replies, obviously not expecting that request from his brother.
‘They said they bet I wouldn’t drink enough to get drunk since I’m a goody two shoes. So I drank the whole bottle!’ Peter sounds very proud of himself.
‘Too long. Never again.’
Tony kisses the soldier to shut him up. ‘Though I will say, Steve,’ he grins as he pulls away, ‘no one is ever allowed to call you innocent again after last night.’
‘Alright everyone may I have your attention please!’ the registrar calls over the noise. ‘Please can you all enter and take your seats. All those involved in the wedding party please stay out here.’
‘Can’t I come to make sure my friend is alright?’
Thank you so much to everyone who has been leaving comments and kudos. Please do let me know what you think of the story so far.
‘Twenty minutes,’ Tony muses aloud. ‘I suspect less if it got onto all the news channels first.’
Natasha turns, frowning in confusion. ‘What are you talking about?’
‘But I’ve been travelling and I’ve been away for days looking after a baby!’
‘Oh there’s a special area I can go to climb the walls, May. Besides I think I’d be dead if I accidentally pulled down any decorations.’
‘Yeah, after Ross tried calling you,’ Peter yawns.
‘Don’t know what you’re talking about,’ Tony waves her off. ‘So what’s got you wound up over Bruce?’
She can see the inventor looks torn. ‘What does everyone else think?’ he asks eventually.
‘I don’t understand why you think food is a good projectile,’ Nebula adds. ‘It has no weight to it, there’s no chance of injury. What is the point in starting a fight with something that won’t help you win?’
‘Really?’ the little girl’s eyes go wide.
‘If you had your way,’ Steve reminds him in a murmur, a fond smile on his lips.
‘I’ll call them now,’ Natasha says with a smile.
Peter sits bolt upright. ‘Really?’
‘Always am, Baby Boy,’ the merc replies with a smile, pulling him into his own hug.
‘No sir.’
Loki shakes his head. ‘Not entirely; for one I didn’t know I could take on my frost giant form without the Casket, now that I have spent some time in the form I feel I may be able to take it at will. For another I can cause harm to others when I am in it and I’d rather not be giving frost bite to every person who touches me. Until I am better able to control it I think it best I return to the form I am more comfortable in. Besides this is how everyone knows me, and it will stop the annoying nicknames from Stark.’
Peter is with Tony in the lab when the door opens and Wade walks in.
Wade grips Peter’s shoulder tighter and he struggles to his feet and follows the older man out of the room. ‘You alright, Baby Boy?’ he asks as they step into the elevator to head down.
‘Tony,’ Pepper shakes her head, ‘stay out of my relationship. For the sake of Happy’s stress levels and my headaches. Now,’ she says before he can finish opening his mouth, ‘I need you to have a look through these.’ She dumbs the pile of paperwork on his lap. ‘All of these are projects that SI has funded in the past and that are up for renewal. I know you like to still have a hand in what we fund so I thought I’d let you take a look through and tell me what you think and then we can go from there.’
Lautenus barks. ‘Says the one who tried to destroy his own race. Now FIGHT ME!’ He aims a blast of ice at Loki, which the trickster manages to block with his magic, sending the blast flying into the ceiling. ‘You truly are a coward!’ Lautenus crows. ‘Using magic to fight me instead of your true Jotun form. You are-’
‘Sometimes the suicide play is worth it. Means you’ll be able to save tens, hundreds, if not thousands of lives. Like when I flew the nuke up through the wormhole in New York, or when Captain America flew his plane into the ice in the War. But you
Distantly they can hear Thor’s booming voice. ‘Friends! Awaken! The time to celebrate Yule has arrived!’
I hope you're all staying safe and well during all of this craziness. As I have the next stand-alone story already written I'll be starting to post it from mid week, so there'll be an update here on the weekend, and an update on that one mid-week. Hopefully that'll help keep away some of the boredom as the world goes into lock-down. Unfortunately this idiot decided to give up, amongst other things, reading fics for lent. So I'm not able to do that to help me from becoming bored. On the plus side the amount I'm writing has sky rocketed!

‘Hey guys, sorry we’re late,’ Clint’s voice comes over the speaker from the quinjet.
‘But-’ he’s cut off as more soldiers come running towards them.
‘Why is it when I start trying to be an actual responsible adult I get just as much grief as when I’m a reckless and selfish asshole?’
‘How did you-’
,’ Sam counters.
‘We?’ Wanda asks.
Strange smiles again. ‘I may not be well versed in your particular brand of magic, but I’m sure we can find something in the tomes either at the Sanctum here, or at Kamar-Taj.’
Tony frowns at him as he hands Sam his drink and returns to the bar for his and Bucky’s. ‘Just a bad meeting, Rhodey. I’m not being slowly poisoned if that’s what you’re asking. Unless Ross’ voice counts,’ he adds as he hands Bucky his glass and collapses into one of the armchairs.
‘Can I?’ he looks between the two of them. ‘I mean I don’t want to take away your time together-’
‘I shall do a scan to confirm,’ Vision says, rising into the air.
His only response is his friend’s laughter as he opens the door and tells Peter to take some food down to the workshop for Tony.
Nathaniel’s lip starts to quiver, obviously realising he’s said something wrong. ‘That’s what I heard Dad say to Mom one night when I couldn’t sleep and went downstairs.’ Out of the corner of his eye Loki sees Clint hide his head in hands and slowly sink down in his chair. Other members of the table have started to realise what’s happening and he realises this could quickly turn awkward. Wanda seems to be trying to find the best thing to say, and Thor is frowning at Clint and Loki’s wondering how long before Mjolnir will make an appearance.
‘Already ordered, boss,’ his AI replies, ‘I also took the liberty of adding some drinks to the order as well. It should be here in forty five minutes, I’ll let you know when they reach the gate.’
‘I was thinking we needed help!’ he snaps back. ‘And Deadpool was the one to get both of us out of that situation at the end, and before that he saved me a couple of times. Not to mention he took my friend up to the jet.’
‘I think he broke my nose,’ his muffled voice comes through his hand.
Afraid to look Vision in the eye, knowing he can probably read his thoughts with that damn stone anyway, Tony sighs again. ‘I’m scared,’ he admits.
‘What?’
‘Oh no, don’t start apologising for Tony,’ Stephen laughs, ‘you’ll be doing it for eternity if you start.’
‘Maybe cross that bridge when we get to it,’ Natasha suggests, ‘but that sounds like a brilliant idea, Sam.’
‘No I’m not,’ he agrees with a laugh. ‘But anyway this isn’t a call about your love life. There’s been a lot of weapons being moved around the city.’
what I am finding difficult: not having her here and being surrounded by reminders of family and friends.’
‘Excuse me?’ Steve’s voice is cold and dangerous, and he’s trying to keep his anger under control.
Out of the debris come two figures, one who looks like he could rival the Hulk, and the other looking like some weird Lovecraftian cosplayer.
‘I mean,’ Bucky says once the two men have left, ‘that was a proper Tony scowl you had going on then kid.’
‘No,’ is Pepper’s reply. ‘Steve should do it as well so both of the team leaders are up.’
‘Love you too, Wade,’ he sighs happily, then adds. ‘We both love you too, Wanda.’
‘We heard anything back from him?’ Steve asks.
her?’ Bucky breaks the silence first.
Peter’s only half taking in Steve and Bucky’s explanation of how this particular obstacle works, he’s trying to work out the best way to approach this to keep his perfect record without giving away his secret. The trouble with this obstacle is you do actually need to work together to get across it.
‘We could hold it at Kamar-Taj for now,’ Wong suggests. ‘And then once HYDRA is dealt with we could return it to you.’
‘Peter I’ve learned in my life that words don’t mean a lot if actions don’t back them up,’ his voice is getting a little stronger now. ‘And words said in the middle of arguments mean even less. You shout and scream at me as much as you like, but that’s never going to stop me doing everything I can to keep you safe. You mean too much to me, to all of us.’
As everyone’s confidence grows Natasha takes Wanda and Peter and heads to the centre and the three of them have some fun trying to adapt the ballet lessons to the ice. In fairness it may have gone better had Wade not kept swopping in and disrupting them, and even on one occasion challenging Nebula to a form of slalom race between the rest of the skaters.
‘The place is ready to blow as soon as you give the order,’ she can hear Wade’s smirk down the comms.
‘You keep calling him a kid, just how old is he?’ Sam asks, crossing his arms over his chest.
Deadpool
he keep his promise? Made when he didn’t think there was the faintest chance that his friend could become the mindless instrument in front of him once again.
‘He made me kill you,’ he finally admits. ‘He,’ he hiccups and continues, ‘I shot a web and pulled on something and I looked down and it was the reactor. I looked up and it was just like being back in Wakanda. Except this time
‘As long as it’s a double,’ Tony replies, eyes closing, ‘and you got me a large order of fries.’
‘If it counts I agree!’ Peter pipes up, then quickly shuts up again as Steve frowns at him.
‘Because,’ Tony cuts across whatever Wade was going to say, ‘you have homework to catch up on.’
‘Is it large?’ Loki asks, a familiar gleam in his eye.
‘Was that-? Was that Peter and
‘Hey Wade,’ Vanessa grins up at me, ‘did you miss me?’
‘Alright, alright. Give me some credit!’
‘Keep up!’ Wade shouts as he leaps to his feet and, yelling, runs towards where the spies are hiding. Peter just laughs and hurries after him. He manages to flip over a couple of snowballs and aims one at Natasha’s face, which she manages to dodge. Wade has unleashed both of his at Clint, which have missed, but Peter manages to hit him with his last one.
‘Ah, I’m afraid that might be difficult, Mister Stark,’ Rumlow sighs in apparent regret. ‘You see I’ve had the new deployment details for both Rogers and Barnes through today. They’ll be redeployed and leaving at the end of the week.’
Tony stiffens, and eyes Steve cautiously. ‘What do you mean? You want me to take the suit from him?’
The two of them look at the image of their mother, her soft, warm smile looking back at them from the cocoon of Thor’s palm. ‘Thank you, brother, I can’t tell you how much this means to me,’ Thor’s voice is thick with emotion.
MJ raises an eyebrow as she slides in beside him. ‘How many has he had?’ she nods at the bowl of ice cream in front of Loki.
‘Wait, who came after you? What do you mean they want me?’
It's the first day of the trial, and Wanda has some reassuring words for Tony. Meanwhile Fury's problem continues to get worse.
‘Hey Champ,’ Happy smiles in greeting, taking off his sunglasses, ‘how was your day?’
of pages here, Cap-e-tan, and not that I’m not grateful for a present or anything but- what the
‘So Loki wasn’t in his right mind when he attacked us?’ Steve asks.
‘He went after Vanessa to get to me,’ Wade adds.
Tony feels the tears in his eyes as he finishes reading the letter from Peggy Carter. He’s allowed Rhodes to read it over his shoulder, and his oldest friend is gripping his shoulder in silent support.
He waves her off. ‘Yeah well it hardly ever gets taken out. Plus it’s got the best soundproofing. FRIDAY? Bring up the secure link to the facility and let’s see the two ugly mugs.’
Tony has a revelation about who is helping Hammer and HYDRA
Steve leans against the trunk of a tree round the back of the venue, he’s decided to avoid the main door seeing as he hasn’t come with the rest of the squad and therefore doesn’t have a physical invitation to show them. He isn’t exactly dressed for the party either, having not changed out of the dark jeans and hoodie he’d been wearing earlier. Now he just has to find the best way to get in, and find a way to talk to someone who may be able to help him.
,’ he spits out, ‘I should be able to keep bullies away from my friend.’
‘And the Chitauri?’ Natasha asks. Tony tries his hardest to hold in his shiver, but he knows he fails when Steve puts an arm around him and pulls him close.
‘That would be so cool if we could have a huge Christmas with everyone,’ he grins. ‘Do you think we’ll do Yule again? I imagine Thor and Valkyrie will want to celebrate it at New Asgard. I wonder if Loki will join them?’
They’re quiet for a little longer, taking comfort in each other’s warmth; Tony is still trying to process that this is real, that Steve actually wants him. Part of him, that sounds suspiciously like his father, is telling him it’s too good to last. ‘Steve?’
There’s an address after it a couple of blocks from his school.
‘You want me to fight then I fight how I like,’ he snaps.
Loki takes the opportunity to drag Clint forwards once he gives Fury his drink so he’s under the mistletoe and plants a loud and messy kiss to his lips before he manages to land his punch.
‘But she made most of this mess! And Strange,’ Sam grumbles.
‘Because he helped us defeat Thanos,’ Steve sighs in that tone of voice that Tony knows is reserved solely for when he’s testing his boyfriend’s patience going over the same thing, ‘and Peter wants him to join in.’
‘So while you leave us to do all of the hard work,’ a teasing voice that has Sam groaning in mortification says from behind them, ‘you’re just hanging around.’
‘Then I pity the poor fucker, because the boss is not going to be very patient if anything starts to go wrong.’
Loki goes silent, and Bucky can feel his indecision on wanting to close the link but knowing that would not help stop the questions he refrains.
‘Talking science, yes.’
A small team goes to deal with an attempted prison break, but Ross has a surprise waiting for the team that has Tony seeing red.
‘I know that, Steve,’ Tony snaps, ‘I’m just hoping there’s something in this stuff about Hammer that can give us a clue seeing as everyone else is focussing on HYDRA.’
Tony tries very hard not to let his voice break as he replies. ‘Come on Pete you know we have to check this out. And Cap’s not going to let me go anywhere where I don’t have someone he can trust to supervise me because he thinks I’ll get into trouble-’
‘Can you forgive me?’ Peter asks Tony. ‘For what I did in that-’
‘How old are you?’ he groans, very thankful for the fact he can oversee all of this from the ceiling whilst hanging garlands. ‘Steve! Help me!’ he calls as the soldier walks in, another box in his arms.

Cinderella,’ the young girl huffs, crossing her arms over her chest where she’s sitting up in bed.
There's another chapter to come today so I'll leave more of a note on the next chapter!
‘But you want it to?’
‘Peter Benjamin Parker,’ May’s voice is stern, and Peter squeezes his eyes shut. ‘Don’t you dare finish that sentence,’ she pauses for a moment before continuing. ‘Ben went out how he would have wanted to: doing the job he loved and helping people. Even more so if he’d known it was you he saved.’
‘Past actions do not negate present ones,’ Ross cuts him off. ‘When Captain Rogers left he still had not answered for his crimes.’
‘Then you heard “Bucky” and everything went to hell,’ Tony’s voice was raw, but there was no accusation in his tone, no bitterness.
Clint flips him off but mercifully leaves him alone.
‘Cheat!’ she laughs as she walks off.
Tony grins. ‘We’re going to ask Captain Rumlow’s squad to come and pay us a little visit. I need to make some changes to my security after all, and who better than the squad with a member who has the first functioning SI prosthesis?’
‘A couple of broken fingers,’ Steve’s voice catches, ‘but they think, as long as you follow instructions, you should have full mobility back once it’s all healed.’
‘Anything you want to talk about?’ the big man offers.
‘It’s not like I have a bat-signal for the Avengers Ned,’ he says, looking around to make sure none of the others can hear their conversation.
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘See you soon!’ Peter shouts, running out the room and closing the door behind him.
‘Will you
‘Still not sorry.’
‘Alright children,’ Nick stops them before they can start arguing. ‘I suggested Tony was the third member of the team: we need someone who can head up research and is able to actually understand what the hell scientists are talking about and Tony has that experience from Stark Industries.’
Tony throws his hands in the air. ‘Peter do you realise what you got yourself into? Hammer was trying to kidnap you, he brings soldiers to your school, and when we’re trying to come and help you, you take it upon yourself to bring a mercenary with a frankly sketchy history of mental stability into the middle of said firefight.’
‘Yes, you could, you just didn’t want to,’ he grumbles. He sighs again when he hears the doors open and the sound of the second group from the field trip coming into the labs.
‘I’m going to pretend you didn’t say that last bit,’ Steve gives him a warning look. ‘Now are you coming to bed or am I going to have to drag you there?’
‘Uh, uh,’ Steve says, shaking his head. ‘You two deserve it. Hey kid, how long until it wears off?’
Ajax has Wade face Spider-Man in a fight, but something doesn't sit right with Wade. Meanwhile Wanda and Strange have to hope they've done enough to defeat Agatha.
to meet you.’
‘Peter you free tomorrow?’
‘Anyone who goes against the rules and decides to not listen to me: just remember I have dirt on you all. Especially you Tony,’ Rhodes grins.
What’s that?’ Sam asks.
T’Challa and his female warriors go to the aid of the Jotuns, trying to keep them safe from attack as they attempt to deal with the threat from the machines. Wizards from Kamar-Taj join them, forming a barrier around the army. Tony and Rhodey, along with the SHIELD ships, fire into the pen that the Jotuns have created, trying their best to destroy the machines before the Jotuns tire.
‘Let’s take it in turns to go through information and clean,’ Steve suggests, ‘that way everyone gets a break and can come back with fresh eyes at different points.’
‘It was my pleasure, Captain,’ he replies. ‘But when you return remember what I said: don’t let something tear you apart again. For all our sakes.’
He’d never been more sure there wasn’t really a God.
"-Yes, and I chose the sanctuary of God. May I come in or is it custom to leave your guests waiting outside?"
“Go on, we could all use a laugh.”
Having realized this Tony knew something must be done but he was equally sure it must be done careful. The Rogers were as prideful as they were stubborn and if he embarrassed the boy he’d just dig his heels in and that would be the end of it.
"Not at all. The gates of liberty are all the more precious to the man who stands outside them."
He’d said he’d never beg again after his father had turned him and Bucky out to starve. It still boggled the mind, how anyone could turn away their own flesh and blood.
Though the conversation rolled its way through all the usual topics (the weather, the grandness of Germany, the Führer, the anti-nationalists and back again to the grandness of Germany and the Germanic peoples) Vonkov seemed determined to do two things by evenings end: humiliate Tony, and convince Steve that it was somehow in the best interest of everyone if he were to consider donating blood to the institute to help with their ongoing research.
~*~*~*~
Steve sat back and gritted his teeth, thinking with a small tinge of guilt that he was happy he had a meeting with the Mayor that prevented them from lingering much longer over their lunch.
“Why didn’t you want to apologize sooner James?” Maria asked, her little eyebrows scrunched in concern. When James drew his knees up and didn’t answer she looked to Natacha and then to Tony for an answer, but Tony’s throat was too tight to speak.
“These are your new play clothes.” Tony informed her distractedly as he worked at freeing the fabric.
Hadn’t Tony been tutored privately and forbidden from doing anything that Hughard deemed too ‘Jewish’ or might lead someone to suspect he came from that stock? Hadn’t Hughard paid people to conveniently forget that Maria Carboni was a convert on Tony’s birth records? And hadn’t he, upon suspecting potential betrayal, arranged for Tony to be tucked out of sight in the one place he couldn’t be touched, even if it meant stripping away his entire identity?
“It’s their first night in Vienna. It should be memorable.”
He, unlike his sister, couldn’t have been more excited to be in the boat. He jumped up and down in his seat, standing suddenly, eager to watch Ian and Natacha boarding the small one person rowboats Tony had built for them (because apparently when the Rogers’ had purchased their home on the lake and procured a pair of dusty old row boats for their family they’d not foreseen just how fruitful their union would become).
Péter’s memory flashed to the film they’d been taken to see, all about why ethnic Germans had to cleanse themselves of inferior races and how the Reich was making bold strides for all of them. His stomach cramped.
Rogers was already back to writing, grunting out, “Who?"
"I'm fifteen years old Tacha. How long do you think it’ll be before they ask for more than a smile from me?" Péter answered, meeting her stare with one of his own. Pressing her to see the truth. She might find a way to survive under their control, but it would cost her. He didn't believe even his pragmatic little sister would choose to pay that price.
“I was hoping we might get some respite to go home while Péter’s on break. I’ve told them it’s his birthday but they don’t seem very sympathetic.”
“It’s not that simple Tony. General Schmidt does not like to be thwarted.” Steve tried to explain. “He’s determined that Péter should go to the S.S. school. The moment he hears I’m rushing to send him abroad he’ll put a stop on Péter’s travel papers and have us all pulled in for questioning. I won’t put the children through that.”
The bitter thought sat heavy in Tony's stomach and he grimaced. To be fair (and why did it always feel so important to be fair) Tony didn't have the first clue how to help them either. What did you even say after the things that they had witnessed. It's alright? It wasn’t. It won't happen again? It would. You'll be fine? Maybe they wouldn’t be.
an estimated 17,000 thousand Jews were expelled from German lands and forced across the border illegally, into the country of Poland. At 8:00 in the evening on October the 27
"Give your father my regards."
He immediately turned to glance at the man laying asleep in the bed beside him. The way that Stefen’s hair was mussed and falling boyishly across his brow made him look at peace. His skin, touched with gold from so much time in the sun, was smooth and supple with none of the days worries yet to carry. Tony needed to go, before someone spotted him slipping from the captain’s room in the early hours of the morning but Tony couldn’t resist taking just one moment more to look at him.
It was as good as confirmation on both accounts, first Czechoslovakia and then Poland, but Striker was good. Good enough not to say anything too inciteful or politically damaging. Steve gritted his teeth.
"It means boy, and I know a boy who needs to wipe his face." Steve drawled with a note of sternness to urge the boy to comply. James made as if he was going to wipe his face with his sleeve but a swat on the arm from Natacha made him think twice and he glowered at his sister as she thrust his napkin under his nose.
“You dare lay your hand on God’s servant?”
“Virginia!” Hammer called anxiously, eyes darting every which way as if he expected to find Pepper hiding somewhere. “Virginia come quick!”
Steve pushed the tray away, his stomach already twisting at the thought of consuming more than he already had. He'd eaten...well alright, yesterday, yesterday morning to be exact and a few bites at dinner with Charlotte, but looking at the food on the tray he couldn't bring himself to muster the will.
Roll call. Stand or die.
The first of March came and went. It was a somber day full of long stretches of silence and unprompted tears over the smallest of things. Artur was tired of their usual fare and wanted pastry for breakfast. Natacha stubbed her toe carrying the bath water from the fireplace upstairs to the loft and Sara cried when she kicked the iron pot and cursed. Tony knew better than to point it out, but he’d seen Natacha’s eyes get misty as she’d cleaned up the spill while Tony comforted her younger sister.
His eyes scanned the dark hall methodically, leaving no shadow unpenetrated. It was a quick check of all the rooms, a count of bodies, and then back to do another patrol of the grounds.  He opened the door of the room the three boys shared and counted three bodies asleep in their beds. Two blonde heads and one red. He gritted his teeth. It would be better if they were all in one place. There were too many rooms. Too many places for an enemy to hide for Steve’s peace of mind; but he’d promised Tony that he’d get the children back on their routine.
Steve hummed, and without taking his eyes off Stark nodded for Péter to leave them. Péter's shoulders sagged in relief and clutching his baby sister to him made a hasty exit. Steve could hear him murmur a good night to Frau Hogan as he slunk past.
"I wouldn’t waste my breath, trying to convince you not to stick your neck out against impossible odds. I'm trying to convince you to do it with some intelligence!” He snapped. “Any number of things could go wrong in a thirty-minute time window, and they'll be after you regardless as soon as someone notices three prisoners missing! They'll set up road blocks. They'll gun you down. You can't possibly hope to make it by road. "
He was making the right choice, keeping them together and appeasing the government where he could. They’d accept that Steve preferred the children be educated privately and they would find no fault in his choice of instructors.
The request was loud enough for Tony to hear and his heart jumped a little as she fixed him with her earnest gaze. He couldn’t help the wild grin that split his features.
Sam's eyes widening a fraction and he held up his hands in defense.
As if they were just waiting for someone to point it out Steve’s knees started to buckle. He tilted sideways and slumped against the side of the truck, holding himself up with gritted teeth. His eyes never left Dvorak or the rifle aimed at him.
Ha! Tony should hope not. He knew for a fact that the captain’s actual wife had never put up with that, and Tony wasn’t about to start anytime soon either.
“Every last thing?”
The big clock in the sitting room seemed to tick louder and Bucky glanced up to read the time with a scowl.
“Has it ever been done?” Péter asked, a hungry edge to the gleam in his eye and Tony grinned.
“Proud.” She answered without so much as missing a beat, tone as matter of fact as you please. Perfect and proper in anyone’s ears. He hadn’t expected anything less of her.
“I’ll take you there.”
Becker was not a fool. His ideas were unwelcome in the best of situations in the new Reichland. If they went searching-
He shot up in bed, realizing suddenly that he was not hearing the sounds of a live bird but those of a clock. The pale light outside the window told Tony what the clock already had. It was morning and the staff at the inn would be arriving soon. He was still in Captain Rogers bed.
At the mention of her brother’s name Bucky pushed her back with enough force to rattle her teeth.
They'd gone over the plan over and over again before Tony and Bucky set out for Dachau. They left Stefen and the family spreading the story that Tony was tending to a sick aunt and would be back within a week. Tony was to meet Bucky at the station in Munich where he was to take on the identity of the cardinal and Clint his assistant.  Simple work. Not dangerous in the least, except for the fact that they could never be sure if any of their correspondence with the others involved had been intercepted, decoded, and some sort of trap set for them.
Except for the grand piano. He stopped in his tracks when he saw it.
The house felt quieter than a tomb to Tony as he walked into the dining room that morning, expecting to find the children already sat down for breakfast. They were all there. Dressed and ready for another day. If one didn't know any better, it would be hard to believe what they had been through just days before.
There was a clattering at the door that drew everyone’s eye, and it was silent as the door swung open and the captain returned with Cameron at his side.
"Yes,” Stefen admitted after a long pause. Then he sighed.
“Stefen?”
"Jesus Stark! Warn a guy." Bucky cursed as his weight fell against Tony and the smaller man struggled to keep him from falling into the dirt. Tony could smell the blood before he could see it. It had stained the sleeve of Bucky’s right arm a slick maroon.
It was fourteen excruciating days before Antonia came to Tony with the news.  He’d worried after the assassination of the police captain, but there had been no signs of trouble in the interim.  It had been quite as a mouse at Maria’s, and Stanislov had left the tickets and the money for Tony at the Post Office just as they’d agreed upon.
She hadn't told anyone. She didn't think her father would like it if he knew, and Tony would look at her with sad eyes that she couldn't bear. Bucky wasn't looking at her that way, but then again Bucky had always been different. He'd always encouraged her to dance while her father worried what people would see when she did. Her parents had always encouraged her to know her own mind, but there was a war between that and their need to protect her from the hurts they’d suffered. They’d betrayed their own ideals with subtle frequency she knew would break their hearts if she cared to shine a light on it.
Stefen turned, abandoning his thousand-yard stare at the lake to meet Tony’s eyes once more.
“But what if he isn’t coming back?” Ian blurted out, and his cheeks heated as Natacha turned to glare at him as if he’d said something particularly stupid. But Ian stood his ground. He’d seen and overheard his father and uncle Bucky fighting loads of times, but this time had been different. They all knew it.
“I don’t want you to leave, Father.” She whispered.
“It’s alright James. I’m not mad anymore, and I’m sorry I hit you.” Artur assured him quickly from where he stood nervously behind Ian. “Will the stones help?” he asked looking up at Ian, referring to the small ones that Tony had taught the children to heat up in the coals of the fire to warm the beds at night.
Tony had never been more grateful for the forgiving hearts of youth as he scooped the girl up and pressed her close.
Stefen looked away and Tony braced himself for any number or response (each more negative than the last) when the captain refused to take his meaning. Coming here to intrude on his solitude this way and say the things he felt he must had been a risk, one that he was not all that hopeful of seeing paid off.
Stefen would hate this. The thought kept repeating itself over and over in Tony’s mind, cutting all the deeper with each go around. It made Tony positively sick to think of him coming home to see that
"Father Farkas did ask me to report to him. I believe it was one of the reasons he sent me here, but it was not mine for coming. Stefen I-"
We got a very interesting question about our decision to essentially fridge the amazing character that is Peggy Carter so I thought I'd do a post on the Peggy of our story, and we can't do that without Natasha so you get two for the price of one.
Get it out. Get it-
She extended her hand first to Péter, who blushed as he reached for her hand. Tony shifted and Steve glanced at him just in time to catch the roll of his eyes and grinned. Natacha shook Susann’s hand with practiced firmness returning the woman’s broad smile.
Tony had taught them all about the city they called home so Péter knew the history of the Jewish Quarter, a small section of Salzburg that at various points in the city's history had been the designated area for Jews.
“I’ve sent off an announcement for the papers. It’s done, and there is no sense in delaying. A winter wedding will be fun for all of us. We can be in Switzerland by spring.”
"They aren't criminals," Tony interjected. "Not any more than the brothers are criminal anyway. I know you organized their release -"
, Natacha, to understand how important you are to your father and I. It would destroy us if something happened to you.”
"Jews, rounded up in the riots. They should be hanged for what they caused, but the Reich is merciful. If they hand over their properties to pay for the damage and leave Germany post haste, their crimes will be forgiven."
A storm was rolling in, but thankfully the snow had not yet begun to fall. Still with the clouds so heavy around them visibility was low. Ten feet in front was nothing but blurry white soup. The road was treacherous, and Tony prayed they wouldn’t drive off the side of the mountain or blow a tire. He doubted they’d make it the rest of the way on foot. One could easily lose themselves out in this mess.
This is the Knight broadcasting from the INN reaching out to our friends at the CASTLE. Is anyone home?
"I don’t care.” Bucky snapped. “If I had my way you’d have this plan drilled so far down in your head it’s deeper than instinct. Because when things go to shit and you're staring down a gun, instinct might be all you have. "
He didn’t know how much she knew, but then again it didn’t matter so much whether she knew he was a Jew or not. She knew he was disloyal to the Reich and that was enough to hang a man.
Steve watched intently, Péter had a point. Whatever ignorance he had of his people was entirely Steve's fault.
The second half of the November arc. After discovering Peter's deception Tony and Steve face an unforeseen tragedy as violence sweeps through the nation. With clear lines drawn, it is up to good people to act, and Tony is ready to take up that challenge with fire and fury.
Tony and the children stared at her. James hesitated and for the first time Tony could remember he shared a worried glance with Ian.
The back door shut with a thud in his wake and Péter flinched.
Yes, Tony was sure they hadn’t. Three years to be exact. Sara hadn’t even been a year old the summer the fever had taken her mother, and Maria and Artur would still have been very young the summer before. But Tony could well imagine it: hazey summer days filled with sweet mountain air, the entire family down by the lake, sun bleaching their hair gold, Stefen holding one of his little ones in sure arms while they splashed about in the water…
Don’t do it, Bucky pleaded silently, staring hard at Steve, but he already knew Steve wasn’t going to look at him.
Sam stayed silent through the emigration line and only seemed to start back to life when the officer at the desk demanded his papers with a pointed jab.
“Natacha is in town, Harolds gone to pick her up. The others are on their way to my home in Vienna.” Charlotte answered after a pregnant pause.
“And you should always slurp your soup! Father loves that,” Artur helpfully (and far less artfully than his sister) chimed in, and on his back James tried to convince Tony that the Captain appreciated his employees telling him to mind his own business. Natacha rolled her eyes ceiling ward and Tony laughed.
“I’ve bought a house for us and the children in Switzerland and now you want to say never mind?”
“What do you want, Captain?” Tony repeated. There was no slur, but plenty of bite.
And of course Rogers would still be right about it. Damn him.
“This book is not so bad,” Tony mused aloud tapping the pages of the bible. “Lot of things a guy can learn if he’s paying attention. Take Ruth. Ever thought about it Pete? A young woman alone. She goes from being a princess with everything she could possibly want to shack up with a foreigner, a guy so different from her it was like night and day, but she must have seen something in him, something worth giving all that up for. Then he has the nerve to go and die on her and she’s got nothing, not penny to her name and no protection.
What were they going to do with him? One thing was certain, they couldn't leave him out here to freeze to death while they waited for the Gestapo. She eyed him warily. She could lift him...perhaps? It would be difficult, but she and Ona could manage it she wagered. She dropped the rake, making a quick decision.
“He was seven. He was her favorite I think…” Péter answered for him in a subdued way, and when Tony opened his mouth to say whatever reassurances you said when a child said something like that, Péter’s mouth just twisted into a lopsided smile and he shook his head. “It’s okay Tony, I know she loved all of us. But Ian’s named after our great grandfather and that meant a lot to her. She used to say that children are the only way to cheat death… whatever that means.”
He could practically hear the captain’s eyes rolling.
Not that Ret wasn’t a brilliant man in his own right. Susann was lucky to have found someone like Ret who cared far more about the research itself than the gender of the person providing the data, but the world did not share the same obsession with data as Richter. Few did really. It was kind of creepy if Steve were honest.
A moment later however his nose twitched, the familiar scent of coffee wafting through the room and he kicked the covers off, blinking blearily through sleep gummed eyes, following his nose to where Bakhuizen was standing beside the bed sipping smugly from a tall mug.
Frau Hogan (and Tony was really going to have to call her something else besides her married name if he was going to flirt with her properly) wrinkled her nose at the mention of the woman (Pepper, he was going to call her Pepper for the freckles) but the corner of her mouth twitched in merriment. She hadn’t liked Frauline Glass either it seemed.
“What does he want?” Captain Arnold barked and the secretary hopped to answer.
Still, Tony could not help but look out upon the water and see those rows and rows of battleships moored side by side as little more than sitting ducks, enticing the enemy to make another strike.
Tony squeezed Steve’s wrist and his eyes flew open again at the pressure. Horribly, tantalizingly real. All thoughts slid away at that touch, grounding as the earth shifted and slid beneath him. He didn’t have to think anything at all, just feel those hands wrapped around his flesh, that pressure on his wrists.
Steve froze, his eyes flying open wide. Excruciatingly slow his vision swam back into focus, the haze cleared just enough to recognize brown eyes staring down into his. The same brown eyes he’d imagined in his cell and in the sterile room where they’d strapped him down and… Steve closed his eyes, a moan pushing from his chest and becoming a whine in his throat as he willed the vision away.
Worrying as the bouts of shock were Tony would take manic moods and harrowing lows over stares. The ones that practically sizzled with intensity and seemed to see straight through Tony’s…. everything. They were happing with regularity since Vienna and those gazes always left Tony feeling uncomfortably close to abandoning sanity altogether and throwing himself on the man.
~*~~*~*~
He picked on Hoff just because he was smaller, lower in the ranks, and Péter wasn't going to let him. If that meant getting beat up every time he opened his mouth, well at least he knew he was doing the right thing and not just saying it. Not like father.
The morning of their last day in Vienna Tony was up before the others. A rare turn of events what with Stefen’s habit of rising with the dawn, but bad dreams (mostly unremembered) had woken Tony before first light. He’d laid in the dark for a bit, catching his breath, before carefully rising so as not to wake Stefen and the children.
… Bucky, chased down by the police, into a corner, their guns raising to point at his chest, but no fear on Bucky’s face. His eyes were another story. They were no different from the boy who used to lean over his bedside, urging him to breathe.
“They should be in the school room,” he replied reaching for the whistle tucked into his breast pocket in order to call for them. Normally he wouldn’t interrupt their lessons but he couldn’t bring himself to wait.
It was Steve’s job to live through this. His life now was pain. Escape seemed impossible up against the trial of staying alive. Steve wasn't sure what was going to give first, his mind or his body.
“Beg Pardon? You’ll be going with them won’t you?”
The woman put her hands on her hips, “now, that Lilah looks like a silly fool after a husband I think it’s safe enough to stay for a few moments more. Don’t just stand around, let’s get the table set.” She snapped at the hungry eyed men collected around her pot, as if she were the officer in charge. She gestured for the canvass bag near Bucky’s feet and he stooped to hand it to her, sending a charming smile and a wink in her daughter’s direction.
"But you did report on me. On my family." Saying the words didn’t lessen the sting, but they helped Steve find his ground and keep his focus. He wasn’t going to allow Tony to slither out of this.
No one said anything. There wasn’t a man among them who didn’t understand the weight of Schmidt’s threats.  Finally, Zimmerman turned his head and blinked at him, his glasses making his eyes appear owlish.
A brief conversation was held before one figure separated from the others and hurried back aboard the ship, leaving the woman with the two others (yes it was two now, he could see them better now that they were coming back toward the lamps). And it was two children he noted as they passed by his window. A gangly boy in a cap and a skinny girl with unwashed brown hair in tangles.
Steve forced the emotion back down where it couldn’t slow him up anymore. It wouldn’t help him do what he had to do.
“Yes.”
Little Artur sat in the chair next to her, swinging one foot against his chair leg and letting his heel repeatedly thump. Charlotte's mother would have corrected his posture and admonished him with the age-old adage that children should be seen and not heard.
Captain Altera had been nothing more than a god damned bully, whose own smallness of mind and prejudice made it possible for him to frame those he saw as less than himself for crimes they had not committed. She was not to blame!
Tony frowned, setting down his half-eaten sandwich.
“If my captain orders it."
“You disapprove?” Hammer asked with a scandalized air from his seat at the table, looking up from his bite of cheese.
"Hard work", she'd always said, "makes a body old, but the spirit keeps it young."
Getting everyone unpacked and settled in their rooms took what was left of the afternoon. Tony finally had a brief moment to himself to unpack his own things when Péter and Ian, having already finished, were drawn away by the jaunty sound of violin strings striking up in the sitting room.
Tony’s door was still locked. From that moment in Hasenkamp’s office Steve had been wrapped in a cloud of red hot focus, it narrowed his vison, kept him calm when he wanted nothing more than to throw caution to the wind. That tight grip on his control was unraveling as he fumbled with the key, trying to jam it into the lock and not succeeding because of the unsteadiness of his hands.
“Well you had better sober up before the party, we have to sing,” James reminded him, turning back to his own breakfast. Bucky wanted to tease him, tell him he was as bad at expressing love when he felt it as his father was, but that would mean he’d have to speak, so he settled for a low grunt.
The kitchen was warm and busy with the sound of work, which was the sort of quiet that Natacha liked best.  Free of chatter and empty words and no call to think up responses to them. It was especially lovely that afternoon, with the doors propped open to allow the sound of her siblings at practice in the music room to float in. Charlotte had the staff very busy preparing for the Christmas party. They’d practically invited the whole village, and the maids brought the gossip with them that everyone was much looking forward to the fact that there would be a winter concert after all. Tony had her siblings practicing hard when he was not seeing to their father, but Natacha had lost patience for it and had recused herself to go help in the kitchen.
Ian was all seriousness, all innocence and earnestness, as he informed Steve that everyone messed up and did things they weren’t proud of, but it was never too late to do the right thing.
No, it was not his first time in Berlin but it had been a few years since his last visit. Oh yes, he’d be sure and see the sights, however he was feeling worn from the journey. It might be best to take a nap before dinner tonight, what a sensible suggestion Stefen. Couldn’t be seen wilting in front of Germany’s finest.
"Then we’re in agreement. There’s nothing more to discuss."
“Come to Switzerland.” Stefen murmured into the stillness and this time when he asked, there was no mistaking for either of them what he was asking for.
"He'll come back." Tony repeated for his own sake as much as hers.  Charlotte smiled thinly at him.
Stark went to kneel beside Steve, examining his injuries with his hands even as he kept a careful eye on Bucky with an accusatory glare. Bucky could hear the children behind them, likely gathered in the kitchen doorway watching the drama unfold with horrified expressions. He could hardly bring himself to care. What was the damn point anyway?
“Come on children, you heard the Captain.”
With the room returning back to some normality Dvořák sat down, intending to tackle his reports.
Tony pushed away from the door he’d been leaning against while they listened to the broadcast, having heard quite enough for one morning. His sudden departure took the others by surprise, Pepper calling his name softly as he made to leave the kitchen with quick strides.
"I'm glad you’re here.” She choked on a sob. “I’m glad I didn't kill you too."
The light faded and was gone completely as Harold turned the car and drove down the road off to parts unknown.
“I know it's hard to see it now but you must trust me. There are people working to put an end to this, people who would do anything to stop us from going to another war. "
“Slow down Stevie or all the boys will take advantage of you.”
“Péter volunteered to take a patrol tonight,” Emil was quick to inform her and behind her back she heard his friends snickering. Natacha could have kicked Péter just then.
He clung to the thought as a sharp stab of pain entered his arm.  His breath hissed out of his sore lungs. They were still alive. And so was he. He had to get -
The captain lowered his hand and surveyed him quietly. Behind him the children rustled in silent anticipation.
“I should have been there. I-” Steve began, anxiety spiking as his eyes flicked over his many wounds again.
Ian rushed to strap on the winter covers he’d set out to dry, and pad the insides of the vest with the heated stones wrapped in burlap. All the while Tony’s voice drifted down through the open door of the loft, singing a soft lullaby.
“What is it?”
“Does this mean there’s not going to be a war?” Natacha asked from where she knelt on the floor close to the screen, unable to hide the hint of desperate eagerness in her tone as her eyes searched out his in the crowded room. “Now that they’ve given us the land and the Führer’s got what he wants. It means it’s over now, doesn’t it?!”
“You're leaving?” James cried, the first to notice. He sounded stricken. “You can’t leave us here! You can’t!”
Professor Johann Baptist Sieger’s little apartment was well furnished, with all the classic pieces of a man well into his bachelorhood. It might have been cozy were it not for the six dirty children huddled in his closet of a room, their clothes piled in the corner and the three equally dirty and weary adults strewn about the small living space.
“Thank you.” Bucky grunted out, gritting past the pain in his arm to hoist himself up. He could warm up inside. Sweet mother of god, he’d kiss a harry tit for a glass of Willamina’s cider!
~*~*~
“And he’ll be worse if anyone finds out.” She warned under her breath. “He’s too outspoken, Ian. He isn’t popular within the Party. You heard those stupid girls. Where do you think they get their ideas from if not their parents?”
The little ones pealed with laughter as Tony danced about, singing and yodeling, shrieking with laughter as they avoided his feet. Tony sang about the folks in a remote town hearing the song of the goatherd and jumped off the bed with another yodel. He was gratified when James and Artur scrambled after him with jubilant whoops and did their best approximation of a yodel. He’d have to work on their form, but both of them definitely had fine lungs. Tony grabbed Sara and began to dance her about as he continued the game.
“Yes, Tony, alright. But leave the sitting room alone. There are plenty of spare bedrooms out of the way so the children won’t be tempted to find trouble.  And I want you to hire someone to renovate it proper so it’s a real workspace. No use risking an accident or burning the house down because your working conditions weren’t right.”
“Such as?” he prompted and the abbot squared his shoulders, answering just as promptly.
"It's Spider. Six o'clock and all's well."
Bucky didn’t offer any reply to that and silence descended once more, the hum of the boats engine just slightly louder than the slap of water against its sides as the Avenger sliced through the current.
Tony allowed the world to start to drift away for a moment, indulging in his perfect memory. He recalled the feeling of Stefen’s body pressed to his as they waltzed in the moonlight, and let it ground him.
“Well then, you should know Father will expect you to organize our meals and see to the washing of our clothes. He had Frauline Glass giving him wake up calls so I imagine if you’d like to be half as impressive you’ll have to do that as well.” The advice was so blandly given, flung his way so carelessly, as if the girl were already bored with it and moving on to better thoughts, that had Tony truly had no prior experience with great houses like these he would have believed her. As it was he knew damn well that a house this size had servants and a housekeeper whom he’d only annoy and disrupt if he attempted to take over such household duties as the cooking and the cleaning; and he had no idea whatsoever why the Captain would have required a wakeup call from the ever more interesting Frauline Glass (though he could hazard a guess or two) but he very much doubted he’d welcome the same coming from Tony.
One of the boys looked up from kicking the old man, his laughter fading as he caught sight of Péter and his siblings, his eyes going wide with delighted recognition.
He hurried from the room and down the hallway, keeping his eyes peeled as he walked for anything amiss. They were clever but young and prone to bumping into things and he had only left them a few hours alone. Had they been this quiet yesterday? He couldn’t remember.
“Don’t…”
claiming a place of honor in his home.
The children were rustling, eyes looking from Stark to Stevie and back again.
"I don't know." Stefen confessed, the word sounding torn from him. The room plunged into silence, but for the sound of harsh breathing.  Tony wanted to scream.
“Has something happened Tony?” Natacha asked in a grave tone. “He and James aren't coming back, are they?”
Bucky’s eyes flicked down to his sketchbook expecting to see drafts of the AVENGERS cartoon he’d described to Bucky when he’d laid out his crazy plan; instead he was met with the beginnings of a portrait. A portrait of a dark haired man wielding hammer and wrench illuminated by a rising sun.
Sounds of the labor force lining up for roll call and the precarious trek to the factories just outside the camp seeped through the walls. Some of them would sweat over steel machines, weaving together the uniforms of men who had put them there in the first place. More officers to bring in more prisoners. Round and round, night, day, night, day there was no end just another beginning, another fresh wave of hell with no relief.
(Please let them be safe. Let them be well.)
They weren't here.
Pepper, wonderful girl that she was, immediately began fishing through her ring of keys for the right one.
Tony had been dealing with the nightmares and the waking dreams, the shivers and sweats, all on his own for years; he didn’t know why he had such a hard time picturing the captain dealing with the same weakness but he could definitely imagine him pushing his family away and refusing help because of it. Stubborn idiot.
“You heard the Cap. We have our marching orders. Into your night clothes now.”
Sure enough as soon as the sleek black town car pulled up beside the curb the Duchess turned to him and boldly squeezed his hand.
“Tony!” he called out in warning (in need) holding his breath in the moment of silence that followed. And then finally, from inside he heard Tony snap.
Dvořák frowned.
They both jerked at the same time, surprised at the unexpected voice. They turned to find a young woman, not even eighteen, standing behind them, her dark hair braided under her white maids cap.
Bucky looked at him now like he didn’t quite know him and that was far more painful than any sort of disgust he could have mustered up. He’d said once that he’d always known about Steve, or at least that he’d suspected… but, Steve supposed looking the proof in the face that your brother was a cocksucker was different. It felt different to Steve.
Tony shivered. He knew somehow, that Wanda and Pietro were the subjects he was talking about. The ones who had survived whatever Frankenstein experiment the Nazis had subjected them to, who had done things that made them believe that men could become something more than human.
Father was distinct because he was low born, only Frauline Werner had no clue how dirty his blood actually was.
"I'm a Captain in the German Army, I'll live or I'll die."
“All the more reason to do it.” Tony pointed out as he finished stepping into his pants. “The German’s want Austrians to think nothing has changed, that maybe things are even better. Well your children are very proud of their heritage and would never dream of missing such a celebrated Viennese tradition.”
Deiter tensed, but kept on eating. The agent seemed content to wait, posed above him like a carrion bird waiting for a wounded animal to draw its last breath.
A bright, perfectly polished smile bloomed on Charlotte’s face that didn’t meet her eyes as she left Tony’s side and approached Stefen, hand out ready to take his arm.
Stark kept his eyes on Steve but leaned a little to the side to answer James, his voice carrying softly across the table as he spoke and Bucky clenched his fist in his lap, ready to jump in should Stark forget himself.
“It’s Maccabees, James, and you have jelly on your shirt.” Ian said, appearing behind them. He wasn’t alone either Tony noted, looking over his shoulder to find Péter there too with his grandparents. As James dashed off somewhere Tony looked around and found Antonia replacing an empty tray with a tray of steaming latkes, and Isiah sitting in a corner near the stove in the kitchen with Tony’s cousins and a man Tony recognized in passing as the rabbi. He did not see Natacha, but that did not entirely surprise him. He had no doubt that she’d found somewhere to be alone, away from the crowd.
. Steve hadn’t lost him. That was Tony’s beard scratching at his skin, and Tony’s flesh shaking against his. Steve could still protect him. He could still –
Sara bounced up and down with excitement as Steve shook the operators hand and received his prizes. She beamed happily when Steve handed her the teddy bear. When Steve handed Tony the second one he accepted it with far less grace.
spy he had another think coming. Tony’s only real concern was keeping his genetic secrets
He could smell fresh bread and basil.
Stefen swayed toward him as if pulled by gravity and Tony swallowed, throat tight and dry and desperate hunger burning low in his belly to touch him. It felt like years since he had touched Stefen.
“You’re back,” he reiterated once more, once he’d collected himself, opening his eyes to find Stefen still drinking him in with his eyes as if to memorize him.
They’d parked the truck across the road. It was one of only two between the lake district and the main road headed for Germany. They couldn’t be sure no matter what they did which route Tony’s escort would take from the house, but their contact at the naval office believed it would be this one. The country roads were less congested and there were strict orders to deliver Stark to Hamburg as promptly as possible. Bucky just hoped their intel could be trusted.
On Air: KNIGHT
Had it really all just been a tragic misunderstanding? Or had Obadiah had a hand in it all: the riot, Yinsen’s death? Maybe if Tony had revealed himself to those men like he’d wanted to, maybe they would have just killed him and pinned his murder on the
Bruce ignored the man as he reached for a tray of tools one of the others was holding, snatching up a pair of scissors which he promptly began to use to cut away the injured man's clothing.
Stark." the man finally sniffed, his lip curling into a sneer as his gaze moved over Tony.  Despite how unhappy he looked the sour faced monk retrieved a key from the ring on his belt and slowly opened the locks.  He took his sweet time moving the heavy metal bar that held the door shut, but when it was free and he began to open the heavy door with a loud creaking, Tony impatiently pushed from the front, knocking the man aside who let out a shocked squawk. Péter scrambled after Tony as he slipped inside the abbey, not wishing to be left alone with the irate monk.
“Yah gonna be sick, Stevie?” he asked, looking very well like he might be the one to lose his supper next. Tony cleared away the used syringes, wrapping them up carefully for disposal. He kept his eyes firmly away from Stefen, needing the moment to collect himself and not wanting him to see how effected he was by the sight of his pain. It hurt so much more to do the injections when he was awake. Tony almost wished there was a way to put him to sleep. Behind him Tony could hear Stefen’s hitched breathing, his teeth grinding as he clamped down to keep from groaning, fighting for air through the burning pain Tony was sure was scorching his insides.
“Herr Vonkov. How nice to see you again.”
“The boys love their boxing. You know how they are,” she replied stiffly. She looked toward the stairs and Tony knew she would try to make her escape even before she turned to make it, tossing dismissively over her shoulder as she hurried away, “I’m very tired. I hope they don’t do another late film for a while. Goodnight- ”
He’d failed them so monumentally; he couldn’t wrap his mind around it, so it just stayed unraveled. Their faces dancing before his eyes, the weight of their loss sitting on his chest, and he accepted it.
“That’s not what I mean and you know it.” Tony rejoined, pulling away from Stefen’s busy (wonderful) mouth and glaring at the man without much heat. This time Stefen was the one to sigh.
Ian yanked his way out of Tony’s loosened grip and stumbled toward his father, eyes all ablaze and mouth twisted up stubbornly.
"Yes! I'd do it again." he heard himself spit in reply. "I won't have those children frightened to death and starving themselves to spare Captain Rogers' good name!"
“Did you mean it?”
It was one thing to want another man, but a man shouldn’t want to feel overpowered. This was not how he was supposed to be. It was alright for Tony to land on his back. He was different. Softer. Wonderfully softer. But he was hard too. A man everywhere it counted. Steve’s breath hitched in his chest as the pleasure built, alongside it a prickle of headache as his thoughts bounced back and forth inside his head.
"It's good to see you again Nigel," Stefen replied as sincerely as he could manage while his eyes scanned the crowd for an escape route. They snagged on Tony who was coming towards them and his shoulders sagged in relief.
. But the Reich is not a group I’d personally rely on either.”
He almost couldn’t process it when he got to the door, Hammer and the young policeman just a step behind, and saw not one of the little girls but Natacha curled up at the foot of the stairs with tears in her eyes, her face white with shock.
"You're always bored Tony, except for when you're in your workshop." Bruce commented as he took the seat beside Tony and reached for a potato of his own to begin peeling. “On second thought” his brow furrowed and he added as an afterthought, "You haven't seemed bored as a teacher."
Instead of crying like Sara (who had shrieked and climbed up Tony's body, practically perching on his head to avoid being submerged) Maria had wrinkled her little nose and jumped into the water full throttle, as if she’d decided the best way to tackle her fear was to literally tackle it. To Maria’s own surprise (not to mention Tony’s) once in it she
Because that was what it was about Tony realized. It wasn’t about Stefen at all.
“Péter is one of the captain’s children, right?” Bruce prodded gently, mercifully, and Tony nodded blinking away his dark thoughts.
Tony kissed him with urgency, walking backward into the room and gratified when Stefen followed, sinking his weight into the kiss with the same sense of urgency that Tony felt. As soon as they were past the threshold Tony tore his mouth away and reached past the captain to shove the door closed.
! He wouldn’t think it.
The ward filled with screams as men ducked for cover. Something big came hurling through a nearby window in a shatter of glass.
As far as little sisters went Péter had always considered himself pretty lucky. Natacha liked most of the games he did and was actually better at them than most boys. She’d beaten Péter and Harry most the time at their contests.
“That’s not the same as feeling no shame.” Tony pointed out. Stefen merely shrugged, clearly deciding that no more thought on the matter was needed because he buried his face against Tony’s neck with intent, kissing at the tender skin.
Stark was watching him, his gaze quiet and intent. Steve felt a shudder run through him.
Harold came out of the garage at the sound of the car pulling up, shock bleeding into happy surprise as he recognized them.
“Another beer Hedy and a plate of –” he began to order but Hedwig just cut him off with an indulgent smile.
“I’ve got to get home.” Grimm grunted from beside him. “I’m sorry but you’re on your own from here Captain. It’s too dangerous for me to involve my family any further.”
Meanwhile the children blinked back at her, silent and waiting, and Charlotte pulled back her lips into what she hoped was a smile and not the snarl of irritation she wanted to send their father.
The clock chimed again in warning and Ian sighed and stepped away from the mirror. A tall young man in a smart uniform, hair perfectly slicked looked back at him. He looked right. He looked ready to march in the parade and see the soldiers off. He looked like a soldier himself, like he’d be ready to join them if they asked.
They'd stripped him as soon as he’d made it into the courtyard. Schmidt had been there, watching on, still as a statue, the cat poised for the kill.
He was irritated by her request. She could tell even though he continued to smile and babble at the children in a mix between German and Italian that they seemed to understand without trouble.
“They won’t be in any real danger Rogers. The Mayor arms himself against shadows. He’s a coward.”
“If we go to a farm, they’ll expect us to work. Some of us are better suited than others.” Her eyes canted towards James on the other side of Steve, who was dozing. With his mouth open and a little pool of drool collecting in the corner as it so happened. Steve stretched his lips into a smile, because it felt like he should. Because however distant the emotion felt, he knew how terribly deep his love for the boy went and he had to show it.
“Well you can tell him –” Tony began but he stopped short when Bucky made a rude hacking sound like he intended to spit on the floor.
“I’ll let you in on a secret.” James looked up, starting to wriggle as gravity came back into play and the water was low enough for him to stand on his own. “You irritate him too.”
Tony caught his eye from across the table and shifted them poignantly to Steve's empty plate, waiting to be filled. The thought of food, good as it smelled, held no more appeal than it usually did but Steve doubted he could pretend not to understand his silent commands much longer without Tony coming around the table to hand feed him.
*~*~*
Would those same eyes, staring at him now with such open affection, regard him then with revulsion?
Stefen held his gaze, something thoughtful passing behind his eyes.
“Of course he does. Well it’s not good news.” Bucky finally grunted. “They’ve set an execution date. They’ll announce it in a couple of days, but our guy is certain of it. They mean to kill Erik and Lucas. No one is sure about Richter. They think they’ll spare him because he’s German.”
“As I have said, I am yours to command when you want to rectify that oversight, Captain.”
“We do.” Pepper hurried to answer when Bucky opened his mouth with a darkening glower. “We’ve sent the rest of the staff home. The doctor said he is contagious.”
"Damn the mayor!"  his shout echoed through the kitchen and as he took a menacing step toward her, the pair of maids cowered back. Charlotte snapped her mouth shut and looked away, silent and stoic. The only hint of vulnerability to her was the wounded roundness in her eyes that she wasn’t quick enough to hide.
“Tony…” Steve’s throat constricted, choking off any of the words he might have been able to push through it if he weren’t so damned broken.
“That road will take you past the SS Barracks and connects to the road to gartenberg”. Frau Zemo answered brightly, and Natacha turned to look where she was pointing through the trees. Gartenberg was where the Wehrmacht mountain troops had their headquarters. General Schmidt was there. She wondered if he’d be coming to dinner.
Something indecipherable had passed over her face but she’d nodded after a moment. The unspoken plea ‘don’t let them come here’ drifting between them.
“Yes.” Tony heard himself say, the breath shuddering out of his chest as if he’d been squeezed and Stefen smiled in relief. Beautiful, Tony thought. The man was going to be the death of him.
“You must be new to the house.”
He made light of the fact that none of the books he’d read on the subject had included exact measurements and insisted on testing out each batch on himself. The first round burned his tongue and left him with a horrible stomachache.
“If I can get the letter into the right hands it won't come to that.”
“All of you get inside.” he ordered, dropping his hands from her shoulders. He crossed his arms over his chest and added loudly, to be sure the others heard and there could be no misunderstanding. “You’re no longer to leave the block unless Tony and I are with you.”
No. He needed someone who would listen. The children had to be kept-
mattered he realized with startling clarity, his eyes stinging and his throat convulsing around a swelling sob. A hand gentle and achingly familiar rubbed his scalp, fingers threading through his hair. He knew it wasn’t really there, just like the voices in his head, but that didn’t make it feel any less real.
Bucky put one hand on Artur’s head, the other on James and stared down at them both, his gaze intense as his eyes roved over their faces as if to burn them into his memory.
“What happened?” Tony almost jumped a foot when Stefen snagged him by the elbow and pulled him off the front step of the shop. A few of the students exiting behind him giggled as he stumbled, and Tony shot Stefen a peevish glance as he righted himself. It was not unusual for him to find the captain patrolling the streets of the shop when he wasn’t otherwise occupied. Though it had become less frequent as the weeks wore on and demand for his services increased. Since he’d gone with Benjamino to assist on the murder case (like a perfect idiot) Grig had roped him into helping with the census work. It was a near impossible task for the delegation keeping track of who entered the city and who left it, especially when there was a language barrier between them and those that they were trying to keep a record of.
*~*~*~*
A single lightbulb swinging overhead provided the only light besides the square window on one end that looked out into the back garden. The rectangular room was spacious for a pantry, but obviously empty of anything besides shelves and a few boxes of dried goods. None large enough to hide a full-grown man in, Steve thought with a frantic sweep of his eyes.
The river water was chillingly cold, but Tony just gritted his teeth against the icy chill and pushed with all his might, doing his best not to slip and fall face forward into the icy flow.
Anya had a nice voice and knew a ton of interesting songs. Sometimes she didn't even bother singing them in German when Tony managed to get her to sing. And now that he knew the truth about her and her brother Péter wondered if she was speaking Gypsy. Anya... that is Wanda, reminded him of his grandmother.
Natacha stood up, like a phoenix rising from the ashes of all their broken hopes, her gaze distant as she gazed out the window into a world white with snow.
The state said, ‘
Stefen kept the movement of his hand languid and unhurried despite Tony’s obvious desperation. But the bruising kisses and the forceful marks he left across Tony’s neck betrayed his own urgency. Stefen sucked and licked at the heated flesh he left in his wake urging Tony over and over again to

The truck rolled to a stop and a soft kick jolted Bucky awake. Grunting he twisted out of the uncomfortable ball he’d curled himself in, his back protesting after having maintained the same position for so long and brushed off the snow that had collected over his blanket.
“You’re alright, love.” He murmured, it and a thousand other gentle encouragements as he gently washed away the mess. When Stefen was clean Tony abandoned the soiled towel atop the pile of clothes on the floor, uncaring of what Stefen would think when he was back to rights, just so long as he got there.
One thing was for certain. Herr Stark didn't look a thing like what he'd expected.
“The Mariner.”
"You'll watch your tongue if you know what's good for you, or the Captain will hear about it!" The cook warned direly. But Hammer just laughed in return, sounding curiously unconcerned about the threat.
“What’s wrong with that? It’s romantic.” Ian asked, taking a lick of his cone and beside him Natacha rolled her eyes.
Steve was wondering the same.
Not necessarily, some childish petulant voice whispered in the back of his mind. Not all couples slept in the same bed. There wasn't love between him and Charlotte. Stefen had sworn it. He and Tony would have to be more careful with when they lay together, but what was a little more secrecy in regard to something they already had to keep secret? It would all be fine.
It didn’t surprise him that Tony came running when he heard the glass shatter. He was just grateful Stark had the presence of mind to keep the children from following him when he came. Steve sat back on the bed and stared at his bleeding hand dispassionately. He was contemplating how much blood he would have lost if Bucky really had been shot through the head. He’s seen that kind of thing enough he could probably judge it pretty close.
Ian stopped glaring at his little brother long enough to send Tony a curious look.
Tony sighed.
“If you don’t like Tony’s way, think about the fact we don’t know when we’ll be able to eat again. You’ll cry later if you don’t eat now.” Natacha murmured out of the side of her mouth, popping the last bite of hers into it and chewing almost daintily. Steve stared pointedly at Tony’s barely touched plate and then back up at Tony, who rolled his eyes but dutifully returned to eating his own portion.
“We walk all the way to Karkow, cause that’s where the last parcel came from only to learn he’d gone on to Lodz a few months before we got there. Your Da says we can’t go back empty handed so we keep going, and the whole time I’m thinking I’m going to have to bury him and your Baka is never gonna forgive me.
“Sounds exciting.”
If you’re up there God, Tony prayed silently long after he’d lost any sign of the boy’s movements. Watch over him.
"They planned this. Bakhuizen was here. A distraction. They must have slipped out while I wasn't watching." Deiter voiced the realization as it came to him, a junior officer pushing passed him to collect the children's jackets from the table. Clever. They weren't as recognizable without their expensive outer garments. Captain Arnold gestured aggressively and barked for two of the men to search every inch of the establishment and two others the premises.
Not for the first time she wondered why he hadn't told.  As much as it horrified her to think about, it would have been easier if he had. Everyone would hate her, but nowhere near as much as she hated herself.
Shepherding his family out of the way of the road he yelled for Tony, “Stay here!”
“No! I-that won’t be necessary!” Tony had been prepared for a great deal of things but he would not, could not answer to a whistle like some sort of trained canine.
“So they're following you and now, by proxy, me.” Bucky nodded, far too calm for the news. “Damn it, Steve! Always gotta bite the big dogs.”
“James Rogers!” Tony barked, snatching at the back of James collar, swinging him around and grabbing his arms. “DO NOT THR-”
"Not going after your brother is a mistake I'll live with for the rest of my life. I won’t make it twice." He said, voice too soft for such a raw admission and she shuddered. Péter was her fault, they both knew that. She'd had no right to use him like a weapon.
Amen.
Willamina nodded, attention absorbed by clucking over Sara as Stefen quietly closed the back door and walked into the garden.  Tony watched him from the window until he was around the shed and out of sight, worry tightening in his gut.
He hadn’t come looking for Tony to start a fight.
Steve realized with a sinking heart that she was selling her clothing as he watched her slide the basket over the counter and Susann examined its contents. A thick fur coat, and a stately men’s suit, joined a neatly folded pile of shimmery blouses on the countertop.
Tony was startled out of his thoughts as Péter shot off another round, his can shaking belligerently but still refusing to fall.
"There was a mob! They tried to get us when we were at the music hall but Tony made us hide in the cellar." James was recounting rapidly for Bucky, his hands clinging to the man's coat. " I didn't cry though. Well only a little bit but Ian cried too!"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Stefen,” he heard her whisper and the name caught a little in her throat and the intimacy of it tugged at the part of Dvorak that was usually reserved for his sweet Helene and their little Rene. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, casting his eyes away from the private moment.
‘You saw him less than twenty four hours ago, stop trying to jump him,’ Natasha sighs, still not looking up from her notes.
‘Maybe, I guess only time will tell.’
Steve takes hold of the hand over the reactor and brings the fingers to his mouth to press a kiss against them, then rests both of their hands over the bright light. ‘Tony, no matter what happens we face it together alright? Whether it’s Thanos, or fighting for the new Accords, or you know dealing with Peter’s new boyfriend,’ he grins at him, ‘we’ll face it all as a team. Whether it’s just you and me, or whether we’ve got the whole team with us. Just…don’t keep feeling you have to do everything alone.’
‘I thought they identified his body?’ Steve asks.
‘You’re the best,’ he thanks his friend, managing to eat the whole thing in only a few bites.
Strange’s face softens slightly and he leans back in his chair with a nod. ‘I can understand that. Which is why I said you need a break. It’s not easy going through someone else’s memories, and in this case the being whose memories we are seeing is particularly violent. Something which is very different to your own nature.’
Steve’s smile turns warm. ‘That sounds like a good plan to me. After Wakanda, seeing what those stones were doing to you…I just want to make sure we make some time for
‘We’re not being
Pepper taps a finger thoughtfully against her mug. ‘Honestly? I think it’s been since the team was formed after we met her with the whole Vanko incident. Except when she was out of America of course, then we couldn’t exactly go for coffee. We’d send a picture of a mug of coffee to each other instead as a running joke.’
‘And everyone else?’ Thor asks, shifting his hammer from hand to hand.
Thank you so much for all the kudos and bookmarks so far. Big thank you as well to my first anonymous reviewer! I hope this is going in a direction you enjoy.
‘We do not barter with murderous cowards,’ Thor spits as he arrives next to them.
Tony blinks as the information on the screen blurs in front of his eyes, he leans back and rubs firmly at them trying to will some life back into his tired body.
‘Oh great, I knew everything was going too smoothly,’ Tony sighs. They overtake the others and reach the people just as the conversation seems to come to an end. ‘Excuse me? Is this where the carollers are going to be?’
‘YIBAMBE!’
‘Yes,’ Tony clears his throat, trying to get rid of the lump on his vocal chords. ‘That copy I sent you was one I was given to keep after it was signed and agreed. I’ll just have to tell Ross I misplaced it if he ever asks.’
‘Yeah, key word being
‘Steve?’ her voice is quiet.
, but Steve can’t help his eyes keep flicking over to the inventor opposite him. For the first time in a while he looks relaxed and happy. Looking around at the rest of the team, he realises they all do. Vision has his arm around Wanda; Natasha has her feet under Bucky’s legs to keep them warm; Rhodey’s sat in the chair between their sofa and Tony’s; and Sam’s taken a seat next to Peter on the floor, a bowl of popcorn between them.
‘What’s wrong, Tony?’ Natasha asks, coming to look over his shoulder at the recipe.
‘And don’t even get Loki started on his supposed crimes,’ Thor rolls his eyes.
Steve looks over and sees the smile that is plastered on Natasha’s face is most certainly her ‘if-you-don’t-shut-up-I’ll-stick-something-sharp-in-you’ smile. ‘Who is he?’
‘Not exactly,’ Steve tells him.
‘Go,’ Tony tells Steve, letting him, Bucky and Natasha run ahead to meet their friends. He arrives a couple of minutes after them with Peter, Wanda and Vision in tow. ‘What happened?’ Then he catches sight of the person between Thor and Bruce. ‘Someone want to explain what happened to Loki?’
I'm going to keep the ban on any kind of spoilers in the comments until I've finished posting this story. You can start the discussion in the sequels I promise.
‘Maybe not,’ Bucky agrees, ‘but you got to promise me something Stevie?’
made this, or how they got the specs seeing as it was my
‘Baby Boy?’
‘You touch any of them,’ Tony growls, ‘and I’ll make sure you die a slow and very painful death.’
Tony smirks. ‘King T’Challa.’
‘And it has brought everyone closer together. I’ll admit I was surprised to see Doctor Strange here and learn he is going to be staying for a couple of weeks.’
Peter thinks, his head on one side, then turns a grin to Wade. ‘Alright let’s do it. You got your snowballs ready?’
‘What does he think I’m doing when I watch him and Rhodey box? I seriously hope he doesn’t think I’m staring at
As always here's your sneak peek:
Strange, still a little dazed, nods and the three of them start weaving the sticks together. Tony doesn't mention the tear he sees escape from the doctor’s eye at one point, but does nudge a glass of scotch to his two companions, and if the doctor’s one is slightly more filled than Sam’s then it was completely accidental.
‘But-’
‘This is the one from Germany right?’ Bucky clarifies. ‘Spider-Man?’
‘I assume it’s something to do with my Jotun physiology and the fact I am more comfortable in it means I am more able to withstand the cold.’
‘Boss? It looks like someone else has been given control of EDITH, it’s taking me longer to get through.’
‘I’ll see if I can get hold of Hill,’ Natasha’s voice comes from off screen.
Bucky turns to face his best friend. ‘If there is even a
As expected the two super soldiers take off, pushing each other as they go, and they’re soon far enough away to not be able to hear what they’re saying to each other. Though it’s not that difficult to guess considering the punches and attempted trips that occur every couple of minutes. Next to him Natasha sets a fast but steady pace that they can both maintain.
The last thing he sees is one of the soldiers, a bulky gas mask covering his face, leaning down over Wanda, picking up her prone form.
‘Stop being a baby. Will you take him for a training session or do I need to ask Sam?’
The blind man cocks his head strangely in his direction, Peter assumes it’s him picking up a new voice. Then Foggy interrupts. ‘Seriously I don’t mind-’
‘Sshh, it’s a wild Tony Stark! They don’t normally venture out of their natural environment, don’t startle it,’ Wanda teases, laughing when Tony flips her the middle finger.
‘Keep me updated and let me know if there’s anything you need,’ he reminds the super-spy. ‘I’ve already told the two lawyers at SI on the case to expect a call from you so there shouldn’t be any issues there.’
‘If it’s any consolation Peter: Clint’s just arrived,’ Steve ignores him and speaks to the teen.
The others laugh at Steve as he blushes bright red and buries his head into Tony’s hair to hide it. ‘You’re impossible,’ he mutters into his ear.
‘Does he know anything about Peter Parker?’
‘What on Earth?’ Steve asks out loud.
‘Well if the team agreed,’ he says, ‘but you’re our leader in the field anyway and one of the best tacticians alive so it’d be stupid not to. The leadership team is all to be voted by the team, and when or if one steps down then the team will vote to replace them.’
you have?’ T’Challa prompts him, as the older man takes a drink.
‘Is that Jotuns on there?’ Bucky takes a step closer to have a look. ‘I think it might be.’
‘Goodnight, Loki.’
‘Hey Bucky,’ Tony smiles, then turns back to his CEO. ‘Pep can you give us a minute?’
‘I’ll pull us out,’ she promises him.
‘Oh yeah, kid, you’re forgiven,’ she says.
A/N: Hey everyone! Thank you so much for all the comments and kudos this week, I love getting to read the comments through the week and hearing what you guys think of everything.
paranoid,’ Tony jokes as he and Loki return to their work.
‘But he’s scrawny, and like thirteen!’
‘There’s something we found in Venom’s memories,’ Peter tells them, feeling a little stronger now he’s admitted what happened. ‘The guy in charge of the group that took him? I recognised him.’
‘Any more pointers, doc?’ Tony asks.
‘I will agree there shouldn’t have been so much stuff on the ceiling though,’ Peter pipes up as he and Wanda bring out trays filled with steaming mugs of cocoa, complete with mini marshmallows melting in the top.
Bucky can feel the trickster nudging at the barriers in his mind so, with a sigh, he lets them fall enough for the other to push through. It’s a strange sensation, knowing there is no barrier between what he is thinking and feeling and Loki, but the same is also true of the other.
Tony shakes his head, raising his hands in a placating gesture. ‘No, I said I was
Wade blinks a couple of times and shakes his head as he catches Cooper. ‘You and I have
‘You know sometimes I think you just make me write those reports because you want to kill some trees.’
'Dude, seriously? That's awesome!' he says, nearly loud enough to get them caught.
‘Gee thanks, guys,’ Steve rolls his eyes.
Steve fidgets in his tux, feeling like this is possibly the worst night of his life. He’s already stood and greeted more people than he’s possibly ever met in his life, and now they’re waiting around for the speeches and the charity dance.
‘Give me a second, Steve,’ Tony says, leaning forwards as FRIDAY gives him what he asked for; he scans everything until the moment Peter walks through the door, then he presses pause. ‘You see what I see?’
‘Of course, Captain.’
anything,’ Tony retorts, signature smirk on his face, ‘I want you to
‘We’re nearly at the back, Tony,’ Rhodes says through the comms. ‘Vision’s going to try phasing through some of the walls to get a good look. Wanda’s found a side door and is coming round, she should be with you in a few minutes as long as she doesn’t run into any trouble.’
‘We won’t’ Steve promises as he watches Tony leave with a backwards wave.
‘See? Vision thinks I’m wise,’ Tony says.
Natasha smiles at him. ‘With you. Saving you from “the evil government men” remember?’
‘I said Clint and Tony would probably be there too,’ Quill adds.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Thought I’d give you a hand and bring at least one over for you. Though seeing the mess you made of it, I’m surprised they keep you around, Penis Parker. Maybe they just feel sorry for you. I know I would.’
‘It’s not over yet I can still win!’ he counters.
‘If you touch me you will get frostbite, Thor,’ the dark blue skinned man sighs, ‘so whether you wish to help me or not, I will need to stand on my own.’
‘What’s happened?’ is the first question out of Steve’s mouth when FRIDAY puts the call through.
Tony would be lying if he said he wasn’t a little bit nervous about how this night would turn out, he wasn’t exactly looking forwards to the kid growing up a little bit more. He sighs and shrugs on his suit jacket and decides to go and find his boyfriend. If anyone can calm him down it’ll be Steve.
‘Trust me, Captain,’ the god responds. ‘I can bring him back. Just let me face him. The rest of you make sure the rest of this place is destroyed.’
‘Hulk win game!’
Surprisingly it’s Steve who answers. ‘When he suggested it to me I agreed, Peter. It means you don’t have to worry about money while you’re out there and we’re all caught up with other things and can’t get to you easily. Not only that,’ he pauses to look at Tony, and the inventor nods. Steve sighs and continues. ‘Not only that, but we’re about to challenge HYDRA. In Europe. You are known to be linked to the team, and especially to Tony; if anything happens, if you think someone from HYDRA is nearby, you can just get yourself onto a train, or plane or whatever and get to us without wondering how you’ll manage it. It’s a safety net for you.’
‘You’ll go to the facility?’ Strange asks.
So basically I’m taking a
‘Why should we move everything around for Parker?’ Flash demands.
‘Well it’s not the most outlandish theory we’ve seen so far,’ Steve tries to look on the bright side. ‘Let’s face it Tony, if you could you’d adopt Peter in a heartbeat.’
Too soon? Author lady says it’s too soon. Fuck her.
‘Clint-’
‘Thanks, Mama, that means a lot coming from you,’ he presses another kiss to her cheek. ‘Now why has everyone left you here alone?’
‘Oh, hi Tony. Is everything alright? Has something happened to Pete?’
‘Look, how about we do more of what we did tonight?’ Wade suggests. ‘Without the whole person missing and exchanging information obviously. We meet up outside of patrols for food or whatever, but nothing more happens until you’re eighteen.
‘Is there no chance you can get it moved to next weekend?’ MJ asks him. ‘This is the only one for over a month the rest of us can all do.’
‘Vis,’ Wanda sighs, rubbing her temple, ‘if that
‘Spidey baby!’ the excitable shout is all the warning Peter gets before a red blur tackles him and they tumble over the side of the building.
'I was just trying to make her feel better,' Bucky whines, wincing as she applies antiseptic to his cut.
‘Come on, let’s just go make sure he isn’t working himself to death,’ Bucky says, standing up and stretching.
arm like I used to with Steve when he was still a twig when I first met him, you seriously think I’m matching him on
Thor shifts the axe on his shoulder, smiling more broadly than he has since before they fought their sister Hela, as he, Wade, Steve and Bucky all head out on the grounds of the facility.
‘We’re about to take on HYDRA,’ she raises an eyebrow, ‘and you want us to keep the stone that has the power to
‘…what did I
‘Don’t speak too soon,’ Tony warns her.
‘Throw me!’ Cooper giggles. ‘Throw me!’
‘I think,’ Tony replies with a small smile, ‘it’s more a case of what can we do for each other?’
‘Well,’ Tony grins, ‘maybe not
‘Less chatter people! Rhodey get your suit and get one of the planes ready. Wanda, Vision get what you need meet at the landing pad. Now!’ Tony yells, racing down a corridor to collect his suit.
‘I think we should start with those that Quill found,’ Natasha grins. Steve just laughs and hands them out; most of the team are looking excited, but the rest are confused.
‘Hey now Sam, play fair,’ a voice says from behind them, and Steve walks in with Natasha. ‘I literally ran circles around you when I first met you and you still got on the team.’
‘Yeah but I don’t have any cufflinks so I may have to roll the sleeves up,’ he admits, ‘not that I‘m not grateful! It’s great, and it’s really comfy-’
‘Because he’s an insane mercenary?’
‘Might want to give them a wave, Spidey,’ he suggests, voice quiet ‘otherwise they’ll wonder why their friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man isn’t being overly friendly.’
Fury shakes his head. ‘No one knows her tribe exists and I think we’d be better to keep it that way for now. Protect our allies so they can come to our aid when its needed. Besides we need to earn their trust, and if we expose them to the world that’s going to do nothing but have them shut themselves away even more.’
‘Hmm,’ Loki gets out of bed and begins his morning routine, picking out a more formal Asgardian outfit that was better suited to the occasion. ‘Has anyone heard from the wizards yet?’
‘But there’s barely anything in any of his rooms except for the labs,’ Sam’s face appears in the hole above them, ‘and anything that
‘Don’t make my lab explode or I’ll ban you like Tony banned Thor,’ Bruce warns him.
‘Don’t tell anyone. I’d hate to let them think we could actually stand each other.’
‘Sorry. But seriously, please try and get me an invite to the facility. I will worship the ground you walk on.’
They continued along, seeing the Jotun queen grieving for the loss of her son.
‘I must ask: how do you intend to keep it charged in the middle of the jungle?’
‘Has he been driving you insane by any chance?’
‘I love it,’ he whispers against Tony’s lips when he breaks away. ‘I… thank you so much, Tony.’
‘Surely you’re jesting?’ Thor says, looking between the three of them in surprise. ‘You really wish to celebrate our Asgardian traditions?’
‘And what of this Christmas you speak of?’ Thor asks. ‘Tell us, friends, about this celebration of yours.’
Peter groans and, knowing he’s going to regret this, makes his way to the front of the bus. ‘Mr Harris? Perhaps I can solve this.’
A/N: Hi everyone! Welcome to your Christmas present my wonderful readers: an extra double update! I shall post the second in a moment :)
‘My, my, Miss Potts. Have I corrupted you?’
‘HYDRA,’ Steve is the one to answer. Between him, Fury, Natasha, Tony and T’Challa they explain the Wakandan Accords.
‘Oh yeah,’ she blinks, seemingly only just realising the group of people he’s walked in with. ‘Hey everyone. Shuri from Wakanda. Nice to meet you. See you around, I need to steal this boy from you for a bit. Bye!’
‘No!’ Tony, Bucky, Natasha and Wade all chorus at the same time. Peter just pouts and crosses his arms.
Tony shakes his head and folds the letter up, putting it back in the envelope and looks over at the small bear sitting on the table a fond smile on his face. He remembers playing with Edward, and being devastated every time he had to leave it behind, the fact that his Aunt Peggy remembered made him happier than he could say.
The hands holding him under are becoming more solid, more real. He’s losing strength, but he needs to get away. Needs to
Tony nods. ‘I had a little heart to heart with our spider earlier. Seems he wasn’t too keen on you spending Christmas alone.’
‘How about instead of seven more bowls we just get you a sundae with seven different flavours?’ MJ suggests.
‘Anyway,’ Peter tries to get back control of the conversation, ‘this is Betty and Harry,’ he introduces them. ‘Guys this is Steve and Clint.’
‘Pepper’s way to get rid of me for a couple of minutes,’ Tony replies. ‘Basically people place a sealed bid and whoever has put in the highest amount wins a dance with the nominated unlucky bastard. Usually me.’
‘Does this mean I’m forgiven for the Miss Romanoff thing?’ he asks shyly.
‘A what now?’ he looks between Bruce and Thor hoping for an explanation. ‘Because to me he just looks like a freaky smurf and I’m pretty sure I’d have made some comment about it when we fought him if he’d looked like that before.’
There's some heart-to-hearts and everyone gets a video call with Mama Rhodes.
Then he hits the water.
Tony looks at the phone in his hand, spinning it between finger and thumb as he debates whether or not to make the call. He isn’t sure what is bothering him more: the voice he’ll hear on the other end, or the fact he’ll have to make it on such an antique. Trust that man to send him what was in all likelihood the oldest phone he could get his hands on.
‘We did get a normal sized tree,’ Steve reassures him, coming up and putting an arm around his waist.
‘I believe he also made a comment about the teenager the Avengers have been showing an interest in,’ the first woman adds.
‘I’d say we’re maybe another hour or so’s walk away,’ Tony replies. ‘Are they doing alright?’
‘We’d be better off each of us focussing on specific areas rather than trying to reach out to everyone,’ Rhodes adds. ‘You’re never going to have everyone like you, it’s impossible.’
‘You will not-’ Thor looks ready to knock Bucky out for snapping at his brother.
‘He’s still a fucking ray of sunshine isn’t he?’ Wade sighs.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘You know,’ Tony steps closer, linking his hands behind Steve’s neck, ‘we
‘We also need to decide what is going to happen with the Infinity Stones,’ Fury concludes. ‘The Time Stone will obviously be returned to Strange.’
‘Yes, sir,’ the assistant swallows, ‘shall I inform Ajax of that sir?’
‘Fury you son of a bitch,’ Steve laughs in relief.
‘HYDRA,’ Wanda states quietly.
‘I’ll get him to get a move on,’ he says, shouldering his travel bag.
‘Me.’
‘What-’ a blast cuts off the man’s question, sending all of them flying backwards.
She smiles and laughs. ‘You’re not looking too bad yourself,
Lautenus cuts her off with a chocked sound, it’s then Bucky sees the tip coming from the Jotun’s chest.
‘Don’t know what you’re talking about, Sammy,’ Bucky grins, coming out from underneath where he’s been working a particularly stubborn bit of the trunk. ‘This side is all finished and ready for you to sand when you get more than a third of the way down the table.’
He sighs. ‘But it was also exhausting. Balancing expectations, dealing with the reception from the Asgardians, trying to keep my humour high for Thor’s sake,’ he sighs again, ‘never have I felt the weight of being a leader as I did these past weeks.’
‘-So you thought you’d ambush him here.’
Another pause, and Tony feels like crying. He’s about to hang up when he hears the quiet, but firm ‘Yes.’
‘No.’
‘Right, yeah, sorry,’ Wade’s definitely spooked, Bucky realises, ‘it’s just…I shot the motherfucker in the head. He died. He
‘I don’t know,’ he replies, feeling Steve’s arm tighten around him. ‘Anyway, we’ve got more than enough to be getting on with, let’s stop this morbid trip down memory lane. We’ve not got any leads yet on Zemo, so what other options do we have?’
‘Mr Wilson you are out,’ FRIDAY says. Peter hurriedly cobbles together a snowball and holds it ready as Wade slowly stands up. He waits till he hears the crunch of snow from Natasha’s boots and then rolls out, throwing the snowball at her and cheering when it hits her square in the face.
‘We’re on our way,’ Tony reassures him, and the four of them head back along the streets towards the Sanctum, and the sound of the other battle.
‘Yeah we’ll go with that,’ he’s too tired to argue the point, and he’s not entirely sure if he
‘Of course, Peter,’ his AI responds, and immediately there’s some pictures of the team floating in the air in front of them. Rosie stops her protests and starts cooing at and trying to grab some of the pictures.
Hammer’s trial for kidnapping, torturing and attempting to murder Tony is due to start tomorrow; the whole team will be there for the first day, and then they will be heading over to the UN for the start of the debate to bring in the Wakandan Accords in place of the Sokovian ones. They know they’re taking a risk attacking HYDRA while Hammer’s trial is still ongoing, but they don’t have much of a choice after the mission Wade, Natasha and Bucky had come back from.
‘I know, it’s great isn’t it?’
Wanda and Peter start the Christmas planning, and the team send invitations out to the rest of their friends
‘Yeah well I bet you failed to mention you went to the shit hole that is Hell’s Kitchen to your buddies,’ Deadpool counters.
‘I’m not going to like this am I?’ Tony groans, knowing that look all too well.
‘Why do I get a bad feeling about this?’
Vision had suggested cooking a traditional Sokovian dish to celebrate Wanda’s return and he and Rhodes had already prepared everything before they left for the airport. Tony still can’t pronounce the name of the dish, and if he’s honest there are far too many ingredients.
‘I ain’t going to tell him, are you?’ Wade cocks his head to one side as Peter finally draws level with him.
‘Well if it’s not someone you’re seeing why won’t you tell me?’ she teases him.
‘Forget it,’ he grumbles, as he sits on the top of the wall.
When they break apart Peter’s grinning and there’s an answering one on Wade’s face. ‘So I take it that’s a yes?’
‘I feel it,’ he admits, taking a bite of his chimichanga. ‘Thanks for this, Pool.’
‘I seriously thought this was going to take me
‘Six.’
Rumlow has gone still and is staring at Tony with a look that is making Steve nervous. He catches Bucky’s eye and his friend nods minutely. They’ve got to be ready to step in. ‘I don’t know what you’re implying,
‘Merry Christmas, Wade,’ he whispers, then goes into his room, closing the door softly behind him.
‘Couldn’t we have just used FRIDAY?’ Strange asks as he joins them.
‘Uh oh,’ he squeaks as Tony says his full name.
‘Tony you called ground breaking technology BARF.’
Tony’s smile is blinding, and there’s unshed tears in his eyes, as he reaches forwards to press a kiss to Steve’s lips. ‘Captain Rogers,’ he responds, ‘the honour would be all mine.’
Peter shrugs. ‘Because you want me to keep my identity secret?’
‘Alright you and Wanda get to the auditorium, find your mask and wait for instructions. FRIDAY will set you up with comms as soon as the mask is on. I’ll make sure our friend here isn’t going anywhere and then join you. Vision and Rhodey should already be in place monitoring the other hostages.’
‘Thank you,’ he smiles back at the trickster. When Thor had snapped Thanos’ army from existence he had also returned all of Asgard to existence that had been destroyed by both the Titan and by their half-sister. Loki had apparently been waiting on the Bifrost to greet his brother when he returned. If Thor is to be believed there were many tears shed as the brothers reunited. Loki’s version is a little more realistic if anyone were to ask Steve’s opinion. When he isn’t trying to take over the world the trickster is actually quite entertaining to be around.
‘T’Challa!’ Nakia leaps across to the king, sending them both sprawling to the ground just as an explosion rocks through the room.
“What the fuck are you talking like that for?” Bucky grumbled. “It’s done Stefen. You did the best you could.”
The children’s lessons had improved but there was no easy solution for the heat of the schoolroom, the length of the days, or the fact that with each day that passed the children missed their father more. Tony’s last letter from the Captain had been both surprising in its candidness and frustrating in the contradictions it continued to present him in regards to the captain’s character. He’d not expected Rogers to take his antics with such humor, nor to accept Tony’s thinly veiled criticism with such grace. He had definitely not expected Rogers to open up about anything personal. But for some inexplicable reason Stefen (Stefen Gavril Rogers) had seemed to find Tony’s rebellion funny (one might even have called his tone teasing in return) and for some reason even more inexplicable he’d chosen to share thoughts that Tony seriously doubted he’d shared with anyone else.
A pretty flush of exertion had bloomed on Natacha’s cheeks by the time the dance had ended, and it was strange to see her almost shy as some of the nearby guests stopped to congratulate her on her fine dancing. She met his eyes just long enough for him to note the sparkle in them before she shifted them almost guiltily away and Tony took her hand in his and pressed a kiss to the back of her palm.
“Schmidt has family?” he asked, sounding incredulous, and Bucky coughed into his hand trying to smother his startled laughter. The tension broken, Steve even managed a dry chuckle of his own.
"Tony, I'm cold."
"And according to the statement I have here, your father didn't have time to teach you much before he was killed, and you were an undisciplined student at the university."
“James...” but James shuffled away from the door and got up to run to the window, purposefully turning his back to Tony and the others. But not before muttering loud enough for them all to hear, "A stupid latch isn’t going to help."
The Generals wanted the Führer kept alive, and to make a public show of his trail.  They said it was the only way to ensure that the public did not revolt. Hitler was not without love here in Germany after all. They were confident though that the people’s desire to avoid war would prove stronger than their loyalty to a fallen Emperor, but privately Steve didn’t think it would be that easy. Hitler would not go quiet and he was too dangerous to keep alive. A fight was a fight. Stray bullets killed men all the time.
Tony wanted to believe him, but he had a hard time shaking off the feeling of dread that clung to him the rest of the night every time he’d thought back to the desperate way Harry had been clutching Péter. That had not been nothing. It had been love, twisted up with rage and despair. He’d seen enough of it today to know.
So that was it. Guilt and fear seemed to be hanging over the man. Guilt for not acting quickly enough and letting the window of opportunity close, and fear of the very real hardship of sending one’s children away from one’s self with no guarantees of when they would be reunited. No way to stop something horrible from befalling them when they were out of your sight.
Agent Neuman perked up, the gleeful light of interest flashing in his eyes as he turned to the captain with a triumphant smile.
at the same time. Right. First order of business was finding the lights. The cabin was not he quickly discovered so modern as to be hooked up to electricity.
Beside her, kneading bread dough with her hands, Willamina began to hum along with the words floating in from the hall, the sound warm and soft like a purr as it rumbled in her wide chest. She caught Natacha’s eye and the cook’s lips curled in a wistful smile. Natacha noticed that her eyes were glassy, and she had the thought as her younger sister’s voice swelled upward like a trilling bird, that Willamina might be on the verge of tears.
“Ian, where are they? Chop, chop, I don't have all day for games!”
Tony had encouraged Péter by making that broadcast with him. And if he hadn’t been so wrapped up with the boat he might have looked further into Natacha’s story. Péter might be safe on his way back to school right now, if it weren’t for Tony’s need to prove he wasn’t as useless as Hughard and everyone else had always thought.
What was inside that box made Bucky’s throat go dry, his thoughts grinding to a halt. Laying artfully against the dark velvet interior was a necklace. Its chain was beaded with coral, an unusual red so dark it was almost ruby. It was ornamented with an even row of flat gold coins, polished until they sparkled in the sun streaming through the window of the shop. They were true gold, Bucky could tell without having to test them, because he’d seen those coins before.
She knew that very well. She was not a real woman like Ginger Rogers, no matter how he teased her. It was silly to have tried to make him jealous, and she wasn’t sure at all why she had in the first place. She’d hardly know what to do with a real beau if she had one.
“And who the hell are you?”
Peter shrugged, continuing his work as if his departure in the morning didn’t loom over them and it was inconsequential whether he was ready or not.
“Why don't you eat, Herr Stark? I'm sure you'll find it filling,” he snapped before he could stop himself.
“Captain, while the house is delighted to have you back, I simply must bring it to your attention that Herr Stark’s behavior while you’ve been away has been unacceptable – ”
Frowning with concern, Tony shifted out from under him, careful of jostling Stefen’s battered legs. He padded over to the dresser in search of another blanket to thwart the chill.
Though Péter’s cheeks had flushed pink with mortification when Gwen had looked at him curiously he couldn’t be too mad at Harry because truthfully, neither could he.
“Yes.”
The whole room was holding its breath along with Tony as they waited for the captains reply. The funny thing was, Tony already knew what had happened. It was written in every grim line of Stefen’s face. But there was still some part of Tony that insisted on holding onto hope until Stefen placed a hand on both boy’s shoulders and said the words aloud.
Bucky could understand pride in one’s heritage, choosing not to hide your difference. He made that choice every day. But there was a huge difference between not hiding and shouting about it and you had to wonder about a guy who needed to shout that loud. Bucky’d been digging around but largely getting nowhere. He’d hoped that with Kirk being a Navy man and spending his youth at the base he might have something of use for him.
"Why is it so cold? Stefen grunted after a time and Tony shrugged, continuing his lazy stroking of the skin of Stefen's back.
The trouble was Tony wasn’t a doctor and he only had what he’d picked up during his days aiding Bruce in the infirmary at the abbey to rely on.
Steve shook himself and looked back at Charlotte, who had a teasing pout on her lips.
There was something about the way the captain moved, and the ashen look upon the boy’s face that held the silence as the two entered – Stefen supporting the young man with a grip on his arm and a hand on his back. Cameron’s legs were wobbling as if he were drunk, but there was a hollow and glazed look in his eyes that said that was not the case. Tony’s heart sank within his chest as he took in the boy’s tear stained cheeks and the swelling bruise just below his right eye.
“Oh is it?” Stefen made a thoughtful sound as the little girl nodded, expression turning devastated as she said, “That means he’s sick!”
Steve stumbled, the setting sun stinging his eyes as his legs twisted underneath him and threatened to buckle. He fell into the man coming up behind him, his teeth stinging from the jarring collision. Hands pushed against his back shoving him upright and he rebalanced quickly, stepping right back into their steady march.
‘Oh shit you really are Spider-Man!’
‘How did it go?’ he asks the two men as they join him in looking out over T’Challa’s country.
He frowns and pushes the hand away. ‘Mine is a valid point rather than me being overly modest,’ he ignores Steve’s eye roll and continues. ‘Yes I can keep up with science and technology, but we’re moving into a time where you need someone who can keep up with and understand magic and multiple universes as well and that’s not something my brain is geared to manage. If anything Brucie may be a better candidate seeing as he now has experience with space travel and magic.’
‘We shall return with all speed,’ he smiles.
‘And that is not comforting in the slightest,’ she sighs, shaking her head.
Tony just laughs, then reaches to his bed side drawer and pulls out a small wrapped box. ‘Merry Christmas, babe,’ he says, giving the blond another kiss as he hands over his present. ‘I wanted to give this to you when it was just us.’
‘But why can’t I-’
‘Boss you’re out,’ FRIDAY says.
Tony shrugs and looks away. ‘We’re more similar than people realise. I’m better looking, obviously, and not prone to murdering people or mind-control.’ When he turns back he sees a confused frown on her face. ‘We both have things we can be blamed for.’
Steve steps forwards, taking charge. ‘Wanda, you and Nat stay here in case he comes back and we miss him. Tony, Vision and Rhodes can check inside the building. You guys know him best and the places he’s most likely to try and hide away here. Bucky, Sam and I will check outside. Anyone finds anything you get FRIDAY to let us know. Meet back here in an hour.’
‘Is Mr Stark angry?’ he asks as he crawls down the wall, and honestly Sam has to work very hard not to freak out at the sight of the kid crawling down the wall head first.
‘No. I’m the Asset,’ he argues, then breaks away by headbutting Loki. The trickster curses and staggers back.
‘What is on your mind, Captain?’ T’Challa asks. ‘You are becoming quieter with every mention of home. Do you not want to return?’
What it has done, though, is keep them up dancing which they haven’t really done before on New Year, and even Rhodey has let FRIDAY take over as DJ and joined everyone on the dance floor.
‘Awww, but I
‘He was more interested in selling us anyway,’ he spits at the older man. ‘We could have got out later.’
‘About twenty or so,’ Bucky replies, ‘apparently one group were taken yesterday, otherwise there’d be more of them.’
‘That night we decided we were going to start a family, me and Vanessa. She knew me before all this,’ he gestures to his body and Peter knows he’s referring to the scars which apparently cover every inch of his skin, ‘but she still wanted to be with me. We were talking about baby names when they came, the gang members. I managed to get all the fuckers. All except one. He shot her.’
school
Loki is trying not to feel smug as he walks along the corridors of the facility, having left a slightly gaping Scott behind him. He’s still chuckling as he meets Wanda, coming out of her room.
The next time Peter has the ball and goes to kick it he’s kicking air and the ball is sailing over his head, surrounded in scarlet light, to land at Sam’s feet.
To say Peter is a little excitable during patrol that evening is an understatement. He’s pretty sure he hasn’t stopped chatting away either to criminals he’s webbing up or to Karen as he’s swinging through Queens. He’s also pretty sure Tony didn’t invent her to be used as a notebook for present ideas for the team, but he can’t exactly carry loads of things around in his suit.
‘Don’t move!’ he tells Steve as he sees the soldier start to make his way towards him to help, causing the platform to start spinning.
‘Thank you, FRIDAY,’ he says, making his way along the corridor; when he reaches the common area only Natasha and Sam are present. ‘Good morning.’
death.’
‘Approve of?’
Tony sighs and nods, but still doesn’t turn to face him.
‘What about the people we pulled from the lab?’ Wade asks as they start to make their way to the jet, Bucky still supporting him as his leg finishes healing.
Tony sighs. ‘Kid you can’t save everyone all the time.  Sometimes you have to put your own survival first.’
‘There’s already a couple of lawyers at Stark Industries looking into things,’ Tony tells him.
Rhodes doesn’t spend as much time in the training room as he used to, for obvious reasons. He’ll be the first to admit he misses it, even though he and Sam more than make up for it with the amount of training they do with their suits. The other man regularly boxes with him as well, making sure it’s more static training than when any of the others box to compensate for his walking brace. Rhodes isn’t stupid he knows why Sam does so much to help him find ways around his training: he still feels responsible for the accident that caused his injury in the first place.
There’s a look of surprise on Steve’s face. ‘Shit, Pete, I didn’t realise you had to hold back
Hope you enjoy this chapter.
Suddenly Tony straightens up, snapping his fingers. ‘I’ve got it!’ Wanda jumps slightly at his outburst.
‘Oh yeah he’s encasing everyone in ice. He’s having a great time. I’m going to try and get the power source, you alright?’
‘I-you-I..’ Wade struggles to form a sentence, still looking at the paper in disbelief. ‘You want me to be a part of the team? Officially?’ he asks, voice quiet.
‘Peter,’ she says warningly.
Peter wishes Strange would open a portal beneath his feet. ‘Uh…yeah, ok, Cap. Just remember I’m not particularly good at it though.’
‘But Bucky’s stealing my popcorn!’
Steve fumbles with the tie at his neck, his fingers shaking with thoughts on what he’s about to do. ‘Dammit!’ he curses as the material once again slips through his fingers.
‘Alright I’m sorry. But seriously, it’s obvious you like him I can hear your heart beat over the phone.’
‘Which one of us did you want-’
‘You don’t know what he’s like because you’ve never taken the time to actually meet him!’
Loki lowers the book again but the scowl is still on his face. ‘Yes Barnes I have experience with mind control. Both
Despite the news from the UN it’s a very subdued group that fill the quinjet on the return to the States. They’d left just after the Wakandan ship carrying Nakia’s body, the day after the Wakandan Accords had finally been agreed and signed.
‘What’s your idea?’ she asks him.
‘Can someone please explain what’s going on?’ Fury asks. Clint fills him in as he brings him a drink. ‘Please tell me I don’t have to take part,’ he eyes Loki with his one good eye.
Two week's time will be a one-shot separate from this series, which I apologise in advance for any heart-ache it might cause; then I'll start the new series with a short mission featuring Wade, Bucky and Natasha and we'll find out why Wade was so late getting back from his last mission.
‘The Hand.’
‘No, that one is not staying,’ he doesn’t even turn around as he puts his phone back in its pouch.
‘I’m not a mad
this time.’
‘Really? That’d be good I think,’ Wanda smiles. ‘It’d be nice to have a chance to just…
‘We need more ground people,’ Natasha adds. ‘Tony and Rhodes are both air based, and the same can be argued with Vision.’
‘Merry Christmas, Sam,’ Rhodes raises his glass in a cheers as the other man joins him at the counter. ‘And thanks for my present, man, those warmers are going to be a godsend for my back after missions.’
‘You and me,’ Wade grins at Harry, ‘are going to find some time to exchange embarrassing Peter stories.’
Sam sighs and goes to the same side as the dark haired man, incidentally where he can also keep an eye on the rest of the team, and starts his sanding down again. ‘You know I don’t know why Tony doesn’t just give us a robot to do this,’ he says to start up the conversation again.
‘Pete, after everything you’ve just said how do you expect me
Steve laughs and goes to sit next to Wade on the sofa. ‘Why don’t you take a look at the first page? That might make things a bit clearer.’
‘Well it must have been important to completely change your work ethic. So come on, spit it out.’
‘Let’s worry about that later,’ she suggests. ‘Right now we have to get past him before this whole place goes up in,’ she checks her watch, ‘four minutes and thirty three seconds.’
‘What do you need?’
‘I’m going to web your mouth shut if you don’t stop being an ass,’ he rolls his eyes. Then he turns to look at Tony. ‘Shall I show him to his room and then bring him up to the dining room?’
‘I don’t know,’ he admits, standing in front of the stairs and doing his best to block out Bucky’s moaning at Steve’s perfect timing of being an idiot. ‘But I have a feeling I can guess,’ he growls as Ross moves in front of the soldiers.
Loki studies him careful, then he feels the trickster’s nudging at his mind and lets him in. ‘I know what you mean,’ he says quietly. ‘It is nice to have a companion there all the time, and it being someone I can trust not to invade my privacy. And as you say it’s an insurance against future mind control.’
‘So what was that earlier?’ Wanda teases. Tony has to block out their bickering as the military man gets the ball closer to his goal. Just as he looks up to make the shot, Tony notices something over the other man’s shoulder and grins.
‘I like to think of it as you improving what was already there.’
Wanda closes her eyes and covers her ears. ‘I don’t want to know. I don’t need that mental scarring!’
‘I agree,’ Vision adds. ‘Not only is it showing we care about the local communities, but it will give people a chance to actually meet us face-to-face. Perhaps we should do some randomly distributed tickets? So members of the public can come as well?’
‘He’s sulking,’ Wanda laughs from the sofa.
‘Yeah well not all of us have super strength you know,’ he taunts the soldier, ‘we need to use our brains instead.’
‘Well that was one interesting day,’ Tony laughs as he collapses backwards on their bed.
‘Hey now-’
‘I just…’ Bucky pauses, then starts again. ‘He did so much for me when I first got here, Steve. He gave me time to settle in, gave me everything I needed to get better, hell he watched my memories of me murdering his parents and then proceeded to tell me he didn’t blame me for their deaths. And it’s not just me he’s been doing stuff for, Steve, it’s all the team. Rhodey can
‘Sure thing, Tony,’ the man fixes him with a look, ‘as long as you promise not to start sinking into yourself again whilst trying to look out for all of us.’
times Clint’s saved him with an arrow,’ Natasha adds, completely ignoring Steve’s comment.
‘You go ahead,’ Tony waves at them. ‘I’ve got to make sure these two know how to tie skates from this century.’ He laughs and ducks a swipe from Bucky and the others push off onto the ice.
Wanda just rolls her eyes. ‘You basically did. All you could talk about was Deadpool for ages.’
‘I’m sure I can comply if you really wish me too, but I’d rather not if it’s all the same. I can’t take you up on your offer to use the library if you’re dead. What have you been doing? Your Cloak all but attacked me when I walked through the portal it was so worried.’
Steve looks down at the inventor as his friend talks. He notices the dark circles under Tony’s eyes, and the sheer exhaustion beginning to show through. The billionaire is usually so animated when he’s awake that it’s easy to miss. For Steve apparently, but not for other people. And this is the man who apparently saved his best friend’s life a couple of times over in the past few months.
Tony raises an eyebrow. ‘You could beat his punk ass any day, that’s no excuse for you to be eating on the ceiling.’
‘You can’t take him on, Stark,’ Hammer spits at him, ‘he’ll bring the whole team down if you try. And then he’ll go for your
You can’t take a kid that young into a firefight.’
‘Well Mister Parker,’ Fury says as they enter the room, Peter still trying to ignore the way his entire body is aching, ‘I have to say I’m impressed.’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘You’re going to medical,’ Tony’s tone brooks no argument as he and Natasha help him to his feet.
‘This sounds like an excellent alternative to combine both the hunt and the tournaments,’ Loki smiles. ‘I say we do it.’
So this chapter is more setting up where the sequels are going to be taking us. I am intending to cover Infinity War and End Game (as long as I'm not too emotionally distraught after watching it!), and have a couple of ideas for stories coming after them as well. Do let me know if there's anything you'd like to see in them by the way! I'm still trying to think of special ideas as well.
‘No way!’ Pepper’s eyes go wide. ‘He was in Special Ops?’
Peter just laughs and starts walking towards the door. ‘Not today, but maybe soon.’
‘Sorry,’ he murmurs. ‘I’m just… I’ve got too much energy and no outlet.’
‘Stark,’ Sharon presses him.
There’s an eruption of laughter from the children at this, causing Clint to eye him suspiciously before Laura hits him over the head with a wooden spoon and chastises him for being rude.
‘Why three?’ Quill asks him.
Peter is worryingly quiet and Tony isn’t sure what to do. They sit in silence while he pulls a shirt and jeans over his suit, slipping his mask back into the side pocket of his bag, Tony glancing towards him out of the corner of his eye every so often.
, he thinks. ‘Positive. Though…I’m not sure how well it all still works. It should still have running water and everything, but…well no one’s been here in decades so…’
Anyhoo. So here’s what happened in the first series if you can’t remember or can’t be assed to read it (don’t bother, the only good bits were the Spideypool bits and they weren’t often enough to warrant a read):
‘The short answer,’ Loki tells him, ‘is that we are now the kings Odin intended.’
‘How go the negotiations with Peter?’ he asks, trying not to let the smile tug at the corners of his mouth.
‘I didn’t even know it existed,’ he admits.
'You know better than to bother her when she's feeling like this,' she's scolding him. 'You're just lucky it was only a book she threw at you, and she didn't decide to send you through the wall.'
‘I’ll choose a
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘Sorry!’ Cooper whispers, making Peter laugh.
The two of them start sprinting and Sam can feel the air burning in his lungs as he attempts to stay alongside the spy. ‘Hey Cap! On your left!’ he manages to gasp out as they approach the wrestling pair.
Tony frowns as an idea strikes him. ‘Wait do we have to get everyone joint presents now or are we doing separate ones? I really don’t know how this works.’
‘You couldn’t get any worse, Tones,’ Rhodes points out.
Tony just sits back, watching the teenager happily move around his work station reaching for the various different chemicals he’d asked them to get in. He’s experimenting on his web fluid, the lab coat they’d ordered for him is sitting around his shoulders, goggles on his face and he’s still chatting away about the training session he had with Natasha that morning. He’s been talking about it for two hours non-stop.
‘Don’t blame yourself, Cap,’ at his shocked expression Rhodes chuckles. ‘You have the same look on your face Tony does when he’s blaming himself for something. Trust me I know it very well.’ Steve feels his face heating up in embarrassment. ‘Howard was never going to win any awards for being the world’s best dad, regardless of who was or wasn’t in the picture. He was better with machines than with people, very much like Tony. So anyway, when Tony started acting out, trying to get some form of attention, Howard started comparing him to you. I think it was as some form of revenge for Tony’s behaviour, making you out to be this perfect person that Tony could never emulate when he knew that you’d been a hero for Tony for so long.
Peter just shrugs and when Wade opens his eyes again there’s a grin on the teen’s face. ‘Well it’s your choice, Wade. Either you remove the rule and get to use that nickname, or you don’t and stick to just using Ba-’
‘Tony you alright?’ Steve asks through the comms, he’s breathing heavily and Tony can hear people yelling in the background so he assumes the soldier’s running to catch up.
Tony hurries over to join them, his Iron Man suit falling away so he can shrug his jacket off and put it around his friend’s now shivering form. ‘Hey Brucie Bear.’
‘Well Peter nice to meet you. I’m your boss. I promise this isn’t usually part of the job,’ he feels a small sense of accomplishment at the small smile that creeps onto Peter’s face.
‘Is that Steve?’ Peter’s voice is cheery. ‘Hi Cap!’
‘Stevie, we’ve got to get out of here!’ Bucky shouts over the sound of gun fire.
‘Sorry, Mr Stark,’ he mumbles, trying to dodge around his mentor.
‘Kid, move,’ Clint growls.
Nebula shakes her head. ‘We have a complicated history. I think they only allowed me to stay with them because of her. Without her here I feel like I am looking in from the outside. I don’t have a place without her there.’
‘I’m not supposed to be causing you any aggravation, and I imagine arguing with you would do just that,’ Steve smiles at him, and Tony can’t help the answering tug at his lips.
Then a voice he knows far too well comes over the prison speakers and says a word in poorly pronounced Russian. A word that has ice settling in Tony’s stomach. When the second word in the sequence is said he fires up his suit.
-I shall communicate this way until we are done- he hears Loki’s voice inside his head.
‘Why is
nearly take you out before I got there.’
into toads.’
‘Who has control of EDITH, FRI?’ Tony asks.
Natasha gives a small chuckle. ‘They do usually come through in the end though.’
‘How many other Tony Stark’s do you know?’ Bucky asks him.
‘And you will have the army of Jotunheim,’ Loki says as he enters, he turns to Lorena. ‘Take the Space stone,’ he pulls it from whatever pocket of reality he has been hiding it in and hands it to her, ‘return to Jotunheim and bring as many of the army as can be spared. Ensure enough stay behind to defend the realm should the need arise. Go quickly, Lorena, and stay safe.’
‘Can I?’ he smiles.
Peter shakes his head. ‘I tried to go into Wanda’s room to see if there was anything that might help us bring her back if she-if they do to her what they did to Bucky but…I couldn’t.’
‘He’s right,’ Bucky’s voice cuts across as Steve opens his mouth to respond. ‘None of us are fully focussed on anything because we’re too busy worrying about the rest of the team. If we’re all here we can focus on the Accords, and Tony’s lawyers are more than capable of dealing with the trial.’
‘Don’t thank me too soon, Cap, I just hope this doesn’t blow up in our faces. Deadpool does have a tendency to blow things up you know.’
How the guys in the car hadn’t heard the merc’s excited shouts was beyond him.
‘Peter are you alright?’ Karen’s voice sounds as worried as an AI can be. ‘Should I contact Mr Stark?’
I'm posting a little early this week as I'm away this weekend and didn't want you to think I'd forgotten you! Have a lovely week everyone :)
‘I can help get everyone out,’ he argues.
‘What kind of projects do you mean? You mean products that your company sells?’
‘You have the Time Stone?’ Vision interrupts.
Steve takes Tony’s place next to Peter. ‘I hope I read that right that you needed saving.’
‘Thanks, Cap,’ Wade gives him a small smile.
The mistletoe challenge starts, and there's a surprise in store for at least one member of the team
It’s Bucky.
‘Be careful,’ Steve tells Nat, pulling her into his own hug. ‘Please.’
'Aww Anthony that's no way to speak to an old friend now is it?' the oily voice that comes over the speakers is definitely not Ross'.
Loki shuts down the link as he gets closer.
‘Wakanda would be the first to make a facility available to you,’ T’Challa assures them, ‘I think we’d make a lot of leaps forward in technology along with the minds we could put together.’
‘He’ll be able to but whether or not he agrees to is another questions,’ the captain replies.
‘On it!’ Peter shouts.
‘Stupid prick,’ Bucky grumbles, entering the building and seeing the two combatants standing in the middle of the empty space.
‘So looks like everyone’s staying here apart from you two,’ Sam says. ‘Tony you alright?’
‘I met Jessica Jones once,’ Tony huffs a laugh, ‘woman makes me seem like a lightweight when it comes to drinking problems, and has got an attitude bigger than Scott when he goes Giant Man.’
‘Anything you want. What about everything that’s been happening with Obie?’ she suggests gently.
‘No,’ she looks down at the ground, ‘but I failed in my mission.’
‘I’m done with that kind of thing, remember? Besides it’s actually much easier for it to go wrong than I realised. It’s lucky I didn’t end up keeping one of the team trapped in a waking nightmare.’
happy that Fury’s gone behind his back and called the teen.
‘I am an admirer of yours Wade Wilson,’ she replies, turning to face me and her face is so pale its almost translucent. Her dark hair doesn’t help with that, neither do her dark eyes. She looks a bit like a corpse if I’m honest. Or a weird creature thing out of one of those supernatural shows that Pete’s gotten into. Don’t ask me the name of it, I don’t exactly pay attention to the screen when he’s around. ‘You do cause such wonderful destruction. Such sweet death.’
‘Well Stark?’ Rumlow demands. ‘You going to start a blood bath or you going to back down?’
‘Buzz kill,’ the inventor grumbles. ‘But yeah tell him to move his ass.’
‘Dr Monroe has been doing some work with Dr Jane Foster,’ Vision supplies, ‘she’s become one of the leading lights in theoretical inter-world travel.’
‘I need you to move, Captain,’ he tells him, turning Steve around to face the portal behind him. Sam is already dragging a limping Clint through, and Peter is half carrying Natasha.
‘How does he plan on tearing apart the Avengers? Someone tried before and they’re now stronger than ever.’
Peter crosses his arms. ‘I was seeing a friend.’
‘What makes you think I actually enjoyed any of them? I assume this question has come from you overhearing my discussion with Wanda, Vision and Peter at the table. I see not all of your spying abilities have deserted you.’
Tony shakes his head. ‘As heartless as this sounds, if any of the Avengers are lost we can always find someone to replace the gap, either in a suit of armour or because we’re lucky enough to stumble across someone else with incredible gifts. I was scared we’d lose
‘But Mr-’
‘Yeah… hi Fury. Thought I’d manage to dodge One-Eyed Willy but looks like you caught up with me,’ Deadpool gives a wave.
There he’s said it. He’s asked one of them for help for the first time without any prodding from anyone.
‘Great,’ Tony sighs, ‘so we’ve just left one HYDRA fight to go into another.’
‘Yes,’ Bucky smiles at him.

‘Trouble in Hell’s Kitchen.’

follow orders.’
‘You’re older than me,’ Steve rolls his eyes.
‘The fact he won’t look at you.’
‘You’ve got to be kidding me! Is this- have you- oh wow this is amazing!’
‘Gun and shooter remember, Elsa,’ Tony replies, trying to think too much about what he’s about to watch. ‘Now let’s get on with it.’
‘I called you my love and you ran,’ Loki’s voice is quiet. ‘I never thought you would be scared of me, Winter Warrior.’
‘Tony-’
Please let me know what you think and thank you so much to everyone who has commented this week. I will get round to responding today. The support for this series is incredible, I really can't thank you all enough!
‘Honestly? I could murder a burger right about now.’
Loneliness. A deep, aching, choking loneliness is all Bucky can feel right now, and it makes him want to cry. Or at least tear out his own heart.
‘This isn’t a speech,’ he replies, ‘this is a promise.
‘Be ready to move. When I flash the truck lights, start moving,’ she tells him.
Thank you to everyone who is sticking with this story, and welcome to any new readers! I still feel very honoured when I get a comment from someone who has just found the story and caught up with all the chapters. That's a proper slog!
‘But-’
Tony kisses him again. ‘Yeah I do. I love you.’
‘Now you’re just spoiling my fun. We wouldn’t get up to
Wanda looks down at their hands, blinking away tears. ‘I’m not sure I’m ready to face him. What if I lose control of my powers again? What if I end up hurting the team instead of helping to defeat him? I can’t trust my powers, Vis, not after the other day.’
‘I’m curious!’ the dark haired man answers. ‘And how come you never mentioned it before?’
‘Wanda’s with him now,’ she answers, ‘they’re in his room. We’ve put Ned and MJ in two rooms just down the corridor and informed their parents. They’re all sleeping, or at least trying to. What’s the situation here?’
the arm that I sent out.’
‘For example,’ T’Challa interjects, ‘we would have the name “Black Panther” on the roster, however it would not necessarily be myself that would be involved but anyone from Wakanda who we nominate as being most useful to the situation. Shuri may be the one if it is technological or scientific in nature; Nakia could be nominated in matters of espionage; myself or the General in terms of fighting ability. It would not necessarily always be me.’
