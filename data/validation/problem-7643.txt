“Oh, yeah,” Steve murmured; seeming to remember something as he gently extracted himself from the huddle of bots that had closed ranks around him. “Darcy was saying that you primarily worked with holoscreens down here and, well, I was working on my light shading and your screens would be really great subjects. I was wondering, if it wouldn’t bother you, if I could sketch down here, maybe?”
“Maria Stark, the woman who gave birth to us, was a distant, cold, and entitled woman who only had children because it was the current trend and it was expected of her. She was almost worse than our Father, at least he acknowledged that he had kids,” Tony let out a bitter laugh as he looked away from her, unable to stomach seeing the shock and betrayal that was sure to cover her features.
It had been the simplest of ways to pay him back by helping out with that compression core, especially when it became clear that none of them knew what they were looking for in terms of price and quality. Before The Avenger, Tony had helped out with a few repair jobs to get from planet to planet, but it was always with a carefully kept distance and his senses on alert the entire time he was in the air with a strange crew. No one would be around to help him if something went down on a ship in the air.
“Oh yeah? He give you much sass?” Tony asked, smile pulling at his mouth.
,” Clint waved him off.
“Are you trying to guilt me into leaving my workshop?” he asked slowly.
“Anthony,” he began, Tony instinctively listening carefully as his full name was only used by the man when the situation was very important.
“Anyways, I’d best be goin’,” he took a cautious step backwards, as though determining if they were going to go after him for some kind of reward for the heroics.
“Jarvis, mute that,” Tony waved dismissively to the television. “Darcy, my Cupcake, what’ve you got for me today?” Tony called out, walking into the kitchen where she was holding a large white bowl with a wooden spoon poking out of it. A variety of baking ingredients were in disarray, with more flour than was advisable covering a large section of one of the counters. There was a vanilla sponge cake sitting on the cooling rack and the oven light was on, the shadow of something else baking away visible through the glass door. A muffin tin was peppered with cupcake wrappers, no doubt in preparation for the batter Darcy was stirring.
Tony had met Doctor Ashley Kefka a few times before, had even donated money towards the construction of the Ravencroft Asylum a few years ago when she’d approached him about it. An incredibly intelligent psychologist, she was the top of her field and had been appointed the position of running the Asylum by the government itself before the building had even been completed. Tony had primarily enjoyed her company when they met at social events because of her intelligent conversations, and that, despite her profession, she’d never once tried to psychoanalyze him.
Walking over to the control panel, Steve looked it over for a moment before a familiar switch caught his attention and he reached out and flicked it. The lights of the ship flickered on properly, the hum of the engine filled the silence, and the oxygen regulators began to recycle the stale air around the ship once more.
“Official consulting hours are between eight and five, on every other Thursday,” He tried protesting again, just on principle now more than anything, he couldn’t completely deny that his interest had been quipped by the file.
Out of the shadows, Tony felt relief wash over him at the sight of his own personal hero, Steve, bow still in hand from where he had let forth the arrow to kill the monster.
“Think on it,” Jarvis continued in a lighter tone as he once more stood tall. “You now have someone who will need you for love and attention. When she is a little older, you will then be able to look after one another.”
The large man, understandably, stopped moodily in his tracks, little eyes tracking the weapon.
“How typical of galactic businesses,” he said dryly.
“I’m sorry, but I’m not lettin' you die on my ship,” Steve said firmly, and grabbed Tony’s shirt, neatly cutting it up the middle before he pulled it open at the front, sleeves preventing it from being removed completely.
“I need a lot of food to get started in the morning. This if my first breakfast, pancakes are the second, and maybe some fruit or something for my third,” Clint mused, before shoving a huge spoonful of cereal into his mouth.
So, after this chapter we move into completely new territory and - how I refer to in the planning of this story as - the ‘after Avengers movie’ part. Thanks for everyones’ support thus far!
Finally, he was as alone as he was able to get, back in his workshop where Dummy, You and Butterfingers had attempted to clean up the broken glass on the floor from the smashed case.
Clint immediately set about scanning the ship before them.
“It tastes like spicy piss,” he agreed.
One of the things that Tony loved about sleeping in his room, when he did make it to bed that is, was that Jarvis had complete control of the windows and prevented any light from entering before he was awake. Before Afghanistan and his new, ever present night light, he hadn’t been able to sleep if it wasn’t almost pitch black in his room. After, it was more the memory of peaceful sleep in the darkness that made him want his curtains pulled, the blue glow of the arc reactor had become something of a security blanket for him. If the room was pitch black now, well, it meant Tony was flirting dangerously close to death.
“Have you ever heard of the Gods statue?”
“You could,” Steve agreed, voice taking on a pleasant conversational tone. “But you won’t.”
“Darcy,” he couldn’t keep the warning from his voice as she stared at him from the phone screen.
Steve agreed easily, mostly because he had been under the same impression from the beetle-black eyes glaring at them. He watched as Clint, rather considerately, picked up the strangers’ sack for him, before leading the way back towards the ship. Steve eyed the man who walked beside him calmly, as though nothing were amiss.
If nothing else, this whole experience had taught him how essential Tony had become in his life in such a short amount of time.
Any further speculation about abnormally large insects was interrupted by the arrival of Clint and Bruce.
Apparently, dating Steve, aka Captain America, aka the leader of the Avengers, now meant that Tony had no way of escaping the debriefings after battles. He didn’t appreciate having to sit for hours in a room with Fury, as the man nit-picked his way through the entirety of the battle. If the man had such a problem with how the Avengers went about their business of kicking ass and taking names, then he should go out and fight the bad guys himself.
“You’re going to bed.”
Wang ba dan – motherfucker
Before he was entirely ready for it, breakfast was over, the Tower’s various occupants departing as they apparently had things to do and places to go. Tony was left sitting at the table to finish his coffee, Steve clearing the plates and breakfast leftovers, one to the dishwasher and the other packed and sealed in the fridge. This happened in silence, though Tony could admit that it wasn’t so much awkward as it was charged with a mixture of anticipation, nervousness and excitement.
“Come on, let’s get back to the ship,” he said, quietly.
“I’d ask who you all were, but you’re kinda famous now. So, hi, I’m Darcy Stark,” she gave a wave of her own, before her eyes suddenly landed on Bruce.
Steve heard the duel echo of him in the cargo hold and through the small mic built into the helmet as he slid his own over his head.
“I’m not saying that the armour isn’t great, because it’s pretty awesome and I’m a little jealous,” she bumped their shoulders together again, and Tony could feel that familiar warmth he always experienced when she was proud of his creations in his chest.
Steve knew he had to get up though, knew he couldn’t fuck the other man without lube, despite what Tony might try and convince him of while he was blissed out. He knew that doing it with just spit to ease the way would end up with Tony sore for days. Honestly, Steve wasn’t sure he could go through watching Tony in pain for days because of him, nor could he miss out on his daily sex quota that Tony was only too happy to fill.
Steve had a moment to think she was rather pretty, before a frown crossed her face.
“Well, yes. You’re pretty great yourself.” Tony blushed slightly, a smile peaking out of the corner of his mouth. Steve, feeling no need to resist, lent down and kissed his lover softly before pulling back with a large grin.
“The Gods’ statue is said to bless those with budding love between them. It will install the power of the fates into your union and thus bring about prosperity and longevity,” Thor explained, sounding delighted at the opportunity to share his knowledge.
“Right, let’s get to work then.”
“Excellent, Bruce does the best spicy chicken,” Tony offered Steve a grin as the man stood from the couch.
His father had been unreachable.
“Always so sassy,” Tony smiled before getting to work.
“Please, no gang signs,” Tony almost laughed when the soldier lowered his hand. “No, throw it up, I’m kidding. Yeah, peace. We all love peace.”
“Stop, I don’t want to hear about it,” he loudly complained.
“Bed,” Tony murmured, hand reaching up and latching onto Steve’s bicep, trying to pull the man down with him as he lent backwards, counting on gravity to be his friend. Steve laughed, but pulled away; causing Tony to let out a whine he would later refuse to admit to.
“Oh, okay.”
Clint snorted, opening his mouth to no doubt protest Steve’s negativity, when the sound of breaking ceramic from the nearby bar caught their attention. The trio jumped back a step as a man was suddenly thrown through the window of the bar, the holographic glass flickering madly before realigning itself once more.
“It’s a weapons cache,” Tony said, voice oddly flat.
“This ain’t lookin’ good, Steve,” Clint said quietly as he shut off the bike, not moving from his seated position as he looked around them carefully, a bead of sweat slowly rolling down his cheek.
“For what it’s worth, my sister is a huge fan,” he added, causing a sharp inhale from behind him.
“For a price, we have some passenger bunks on board,” he said, slowly, gauging her reaction.
robot and all. I figure, Darcy’s kept him all this time, she may as well have him at his best rather than half broken and all scratched up,” Tony kept his eyes on the robot, fingers moving over the sleekly finished metal pieces now painted a shiny black, Sparky’s tail wagging as the touch sensitive software picked up on the contact.
“It’s a robotic dog,” Tony said, tense as his father approached and bent to pick it up.
Steve had been incarcerated upon the ship for his treasonous behaviour, while Bucky had led the men to once more land on the planet and lay waste to every living thing they encourntered. It was disgusting, mercenary work that Steve felt ill to even think about years later. He hadn’t been able to stop it and it had left a sense of guilt in his gut that he’d never be expunged from.
“Darcy, stop sexually harassing a national icon,” Tony yawned, half-heartedly listening to the conversation going on around him.
, and seriously, if the bad guys were going to give themselves self-appointed titles, couldn’t they think of something better and less cliché? They’d mostly only heard about Doom from SHEILD reports and what they’d seen on the news, never having battled him themselves before.
“Sir, shall I try Miss Darcy?” Jarvis asked quietly, her picture showing up on the hud’s screen before his eyes.
Clint had laughed to himself, evidently amused despite the lack of response he received from the genius who had flat out ignored him, before flopping down on the couch and requesting JARVIS turn on some movie about a kung fu kid.
,” a humourless smile crossed Tony’s face. “I was injured by shrapnel, right in the chest, close to my heart.” Steve’s breath caught in his throat, eyes drawn to where Tony had flattened his hand over his heart. “I don’t remember too much of what happened next, just the pain.”
“It’s nice to be back, Jarvis. Where is she?”
Tony awoke with a groan, a cold tile floor beneath him, the surface slightly abrasive under his fingers as they twitched.
“Right, Pepper, this is my sister, Darcy. Darcy, this is Pepper, she’s my new assistant; I hired her last month after she pepper sprayed my body guards. It was truly a sight to see, I think I fell a little bit in love,” Tony batted his eyes at the red-head who had stopped near him. The woman raised an unimpressed eyebrow, her expression a mixture of ‘you are such an idiot’ and ‘how the hell did you convince them you were a sane and responsible choice for CEO of a multimillion dollar company?’
“Hi Darcy, it’s nice to finally meet you,” Rhodey moved forward, bending down and holding out his hand with a small smile. Darcy looked at it for a moment before Tony felt a small squeeze and she let go of his hand in order to clasp the other mans. They shook once solemnly before she retreated slightly to hide behind Tony, unusually shy.
“Somethin’ like that,” Darcy agreed, dryly.
“I’ll see what I can do, Tony. You just get to working on those designs for me and I’ll try and convince everyone that being here with you is what’s best for Darcy,” Obie finally said, the familiar shadow of a smile on his face.
“Well, what does he look like? I would be very fortunate if two of my friends happened to be travelling together without knowing it,” she said.
“You’re sweet, Steve, but that cake in the oven is actually the best cake in the world. I hate to say it, but Tony’s right this time,” Darcy laughed.
The wave had requested for them to pick up some medical supplies on Yurma and deliver them to Eboracum Novum. It was strange cargo, as Yurma was predominantly history buffs and young collage kids looking for a bit of a thrill and dance club experience. Being only just in the Rim meant that it wasn’t difficult to source various types of drugs and alcohol in the underground clubs. Getting the items on and off the planet, however, was a whole black market experience that Steve tended to keep away from. Young people getting high and drunk wasn’t something he cared to involve himself in.
“Shall I start up the workshop for your return, Sir?” Jarvis asked, tone particularly dry.
“Hello, Captain,” her voice held an artificial sweetness that set his teeth on edge.
Steve watched in surprise as Tony flipped open the lid, pulled out the gun, and then ran his hands over it, checking the weapon over. The way his fingers moved, it was clearly a practiced movement and something he’d done hundreds of times before.
“Agent Mark Millar was terminated this morning. Agent Barton is needed for reconnaissance while we find a suitable replacement,” Fury finally spoke.
Laughing slightly, he took the paper and turned it over so that he could see what she had done. In shaky, childish block letters, she had written both her name and his, followed by their last name. Seeing that she had put the ’S’ backwards only served to charm him further.
“My friend – the doctor, Yinsen – he was able to put together a crude magnet that was powered by one of the spare engine cells. Once I was well – no – better?” he paused for a moment before continuing. “Movin'. Once I was movin’ again, I made a proper energy source to keep the shrapnel from enterin’ my heart and killin’ me.”
Four against one was hardly fair.
“Ay, it had been a most successful day,” Thor agreed.
“It’s a coffee bean plant,” Steve explained.
“Nat’s going to push you off the chair,” Tony singsonged in amusement.
“You’re really serious about this Avengers thing, aren’t you?” she asked, before heaving a great sigh and wrapping him up in a hug he automatically returned, confused.
Steve couldn’t stop the flush of heat that crept up his cheeks and he looked away from her.
The already strained atmosphere of the room grew colder as all eyes darted between Rumiko and Tony.
“It looks like it’s all working,” Darcy offered to him as he passed her, eyes tracking the holoscreens that displayed the positive results of the buildings power grid.
“Do you mean last week when I almost tripped over the spray bottle and a roll of paper towel that was left in the hallway?” He asked, remembering how he’d only just managed to steady himself with a hand on the wall.
“Jarvis, really.”
Clint let out a whoop of excitement, echoed faintly from the other side of the ship where Tony was. On the screens before them, the USC ship was quickly left behind as they flew through the Dark, faster than Steve had ever felt the old girl go before.
“Right. This is my little sister, Darcy,” Tony was unable to hide the pride in his voice at saying such a thing. “Darc, this is Rhodey, we share a lot of classes at MIT.”
“Right, what’s in the box?” he asked, looking over to her.
So far, however, they had just followed Tony around, the other man clearly heading somewhere specific.
Squatting over the hole, Steve watched in confusion as Tony pulled that worn looking book out of where he’d tucked it into his shirt. He was still for a long moment, dirty hands holding the book like it was something precious, before he brought it up to his mouth and pressed his lips to it, then placed it within the hole and began to cover it with dirt. When he was satisfied, he moved the rocks on top of it, before approaching the nearest tree. Sharp rock once more in his hand, he proceeded to carve something into the thick trunk, free hand holding onto the tree for balance.
“You’re saying you’re on the dodge?” He asked slowly.
Steve silently raised an eyebrow and Tony laughed.
A large metal claw was slowly closing around the top of the USC ship, securing it to the Reavers ship that had crashed into it, effectively pinning the vessel where it was with no escape.
“This is Natasha Romanov, a Companion; and this is our occasional medic, Doctor Bruce Banner. You remember Clint and Thor?”
“I was drunk,” he feebly tried to defend himself.
He turned his glare onto her, which she ignored as she iced the rest of the cupcakes with a thick, vanilla frosting.
And yet…
“Mr Stark, do you remember who Steve is?” Traveller asked, gesturing to the blond who came to a stop before him.
“Captain?” Natasha asked, voice cutting through his racing thoughts.
“Steve, I have so much money I’m not even sure what the total is anymore. I’m happy to pay for whatever we get here, it’s nothing to me,” he said slowly, spelling it out.
“Fly safe,” he said quietly, before stealing her Champagne flute.
“Security breach,” Tony exclaimed, before shooting Pepper a look. “This is worse than all those sweaty workmen you had using my private elevator.”
It was all very sad.
It wasn’t like there was a time when he had sat down and thought about what he would say to his baby sister if this was the last time they spoke? It wasn’t like he’d brooded over words, swapped and exchanged various similes and metaphors in an effort to find the perfect thing to say. It wasn’t like he’d had months of not much else to dwell on but what he would say to his sister if there was never anything else he could say-
“It took a few tries but, eventually, I worked it out,” she agreed.
“Love it when you’re bent over cleaning something, the way your ass looks is so fucking hot.” Steve grinned, kneading the flesh beneath his palms and delighting in the stuttered breath Tony took at his curse. The fact that Tony could almost cum from a few light touches and a load of swearing and dirty talk in his ear was something Steve absolutely loved about him.
Steve stepped from the bullet-shaped capsule that acted as transportation between the landing docks on the surface of Aquamarine, and the entry point to the capital city – Atlantis. Patting down his pockets to make sure he still had everything – one could never be too careful with so many thieves in the ‘verse – he glanced back at Tony and Thor who had accompanied him. Thor appeared as jovial as usual, his eyes already zeroing in on the nearby fried squid and crab stands that offered street foods to newly arrived guests. Tony, however, was looking around them curiously.
“Half the time the modern conveniences you all go on about are more complicated than just doing the darn job yourself in the first place. It’s ludicrous. It doesn’t make any sense. It’s just… stupid,” he finished, breathing hard, hands fisted as he leaned over to rest his weight on the table.
“Shit, shit, shit,” he stared out into the darkness, puffing slightly from the climb.
Tony spun lazily from side to side on his chair, eyes tracking the holoscreens again as his mind moved to more interesting projects, namely his AI.
“Well, okay then.”
“Yes, we haven’t seen one another in many years – I didn’t even think you’d still be here, given everything that happened,” Natasha said, looking at Pepper.
But it never came.
Tony semi-stumbled after Darcy, one wrist caught in her hand as she dragged him along, his free hand covering a yawn and rubbing at his eyes in an effort to wake up properly. They only paused briefly when they reached the elevator, Darcy almost vibrating where she stood. As soon as the doors opened, she took a step forward only to stop in surprise at the sight of Steve leaning against the box wall, his nose buried in a book.
“Let us venture forth!”
“We’ve tracked him heading in the direction of the Ravencroft Asylum,” Fury said, and Tony’s stomach clenched with dawning horror.
Silence fell between them in the Infirmary, only the staggered sound of Tony trying to regulate his breathing disrupted the normal hum of the ship.
“It wasn’t even just me, Darc. My weapons killed good, honest soldiers. The Stark name was written all over the sides of those bombs. God,” he closed his eyes, hands clenched into fists. “Some of those kids would have been your age. I can’t, I just,” he broke off as he pushed a hand through his hair in frustration, his throat tight.
“Never,” he pulled her away from him gently, just enough that he could see into her glassy eyes.
“Can I remind you that I’m the business savvy adult here?” he shot her an affectionately exasperated look, but conceded to her request. “It went as well as it ever would, I’m sure Pepper will give me a gold star for it and everything,” he rolled his eyes.
“I feel as though we should have perhaps negotiated for more,” he mused idly.
“We should celebrate,” Darcy suddenly changed topics, looking around with excitement again.
They remained silent, the hum of the engine the only sound around them. Steve felt adrift, not sure what to do in this situation. He’d never seen Tony act like this before, but then Steve hardly knew the man. Tony had been with them for such a short amount of time, there was no way he had seen every layer of him. Something about that thought pissed him off and he was about to open his mouth and try to get some actual answers out of him, when Tony sat up slightly, a determined look settling on his face.
“He’s the
“MIT? Oh, hey, that must be Rhodey,” quickly saving his work on his personal database, Tony pushed away from the screen before him and got to his feet, back cracking loudly as he did so.
“Don’t either of you ever sleep?” there was the familiar exasperation Tony was so well acquainted with.
Moving over to the cot, Tony leaned up on tiptoe so he could see over the railing. Unsurprisingly, there was a baby within, dressed in white with a white cap, eyes closed in sleep, pink chubby cheeks standing out as the only splash of colour.
,” Clint cut in. “You mean you was,” he made an obscene gesture with his shrimp that earned him another whack from Natasha and a huff of exasperation from Bruce.
He walked into the cargo hold and up the stairs, along the catwalk until he reached the base of the stairs to the front hall. Turning left towards the bridge, he came to a stop just before it at the door to his own quarters. Pushing against the handle, the door swung backwards to expose the stairs below, and he descended.
Yurma was, unfortunately, one of the more difficult planets in the Rim to smuggle goods off of, but not impossible. Frankly, Steve had been thankful for the job they’d received via wave the day after Tony’s reveal. There had been a tension on the ship after the mechanic had told them some of his history, about Dr Yinsen and the Ten Rings.
Steve only had a moment to enjoy himself, the warmth of Tony's lips against his own, the light scratch of his beard when he tilted his head to the side to slot their mouths against one another at a better angle. The moment was lovely, but before Steve was ready, the other man was pulling away from him, laughter bubbling up from his throat. Tony ducked down bashfully, forehead resting against Steve's shoulder as he shook with laughter. Steve was confused for a moment, before the sound of Clint's loud exclamations of protest reached his ears and he was rolling his eyes before he'd even registered the words.
“You have a mechanic named Tony travelling with you?” She asked.
“You were particularly eager to see the sights with our mechanic,” she continued as if he’d not spoken.
“So, this is a great way to be involved.”
He could begin any damage control while he waited for his cake, staying close enough to hear if the topic of his parents was resumed, or if he could relax once more.
“What?” He choked out, feeling his ears warm.
That was hot.
It was a little odd, he supposed as the elevator smoothly rose towards the communal floor for the Avengers in the Tower, to use an elevator as a method of getting from one floor of ones ‘home’, to another. But, there was no way Tony was about to attempt going anywhere with the emergency staircase, that would take significantly longer and definitely cut into his coffee time.
“I can’t have the USC diggin' into my ID card, Steve. That would not end well for any of us,” Tony said, brown eyes dark.
Before Tony knew it, hours had passed along with numerous coffee cups and plates of baked goods from the front counter. He was laughing at a story Steve was telling, about how he’d attempted to go for a jog in central park during lunch time and ended up somehow amongst a flock of irate pigeons when trying to flee all the fans, when his phone’s incessant buzzing in his pocket distracted him.
“Ah,” Obie paused for a moment, seemingly surprised that Tony knew about the kidnapping. “Now, Tony, I’m not sure what you’ve heard about this, but rest assured, we’ll get her back in no time,” Obie assured him, voice sounding just like it did every time the Board of Directors got on Howard’s case about that ridiculous funding that Stark Industries did for exploration in the Arctic Ocean.
The terrible sound of metal scraping against metal filled the air and a dull
“Dummy?” Steve shot Tony a frown. “That’s not a particularly nice name, Tony,” he chastised.
“He was unloading what he’d found thus far onto The Avenger.”
“I like to think so,” she grinned. “I don’t suppose you’re in the business of shuttlin’ people between planets?” She asked bluntly.
That's all she wrote.
so,” the injured mechanic looked pleased with himself, despite his wound.
“Sure you don’t want to ditch whatever
Stepping back, Tony took one last look at his peaceful sister before leaving the room. Mind already racing with ideas about what kinds of games they could play together.
Tony watched as she pulled herself up to her full height, high heels making her taller than him, before she sent him a familiar, pointed look.
“Doesn’t matter. Press conferences make Darcy nervous, and a nervous Darcy bakes - a lot,” Tony pushed anything not to do with the soon to be consumed sweets from his mind.
“I think we’ll see how we do ourselves first, thanks.”
Tony didn’t blame him either. It had been months and yet the higher-ups were still regarding Clint Barton, one of SHIELD’s best, as a possible threat because of Loki’s little mind control thing.
The crew had jumped at the chance for a change of pace and a convenient distraction. It didn’t’ matter how ‘normal’ Tony tried to act, the tension around his shoulders whenever one of the crew was nearby was visible, a clear enough sign that he didn’t want anyone to ask about his experiences. Not that Steve expected any of them would, the crew of The Avenger all had their own stories they were reluctant to tell, himself included.
“Bad things sell better,” Tony offered, shooting Clint a smirk before looking back down at his tablet.
“Really? That’s awesome. Can I have one? Or like, ten?” Clint asked, unusually polite from what Tony had seen of the other man over the past few weeks.
Shaking his head, Steve turned and walked back along the back hall, through the dining room and front hall, before finally coming out at the bridge.
“What on Earth-that-was is his problem?” Steve muttered to himself, arms crossed over his chest.
“Stark!” Rogers barked out. “Fury didn’t tell me he was calling you in.” Tony was positive he could hear frustration in the other mans’ voice.
Steve hated to admit it, but Tony had proven to be much more useful than he’d ever thought the man could be when they’d met on Stuttgart. He was acutely aware that the mechanic was the only reason the crew had managed to get away from the clutches of the USC. That extra boost of energy had been just what they’d needed. The fact that the ship was still operating at the same excellent speed days later, meant that they’d arrived on Ariel six hours earlier than expected.
Steve pressed his hand harder against his heart, hoping that it would offer him some measure of comfort.
Steve glanced at her, fingers drumming against the catwalks railing nervously.
“What?” he said again.
“What the fuck just happened,” Tony managed to get out, voice strangled.
There was a disappointed sounding beep from Dummy, and he lowered his claw to the ground, clearly expressing his disappointment. Tony groaned and mentally despaired at how spoilt his bots had become.
Steve bit his tongue for a long moment, mind working hard through possible reasons and outcomes. Tony had seemed pleased before when he’d met Pepper, so it was unlikely that she was a danger to him. However, Steve had been burned by those he trusted before…
Darcy wasn’t hurt, she was safe. He was suddenly so thankful to his father for finally sending her off to a proper school that year. How often did she go along with Jarvis when the man was running errands? He felt sick at the thought of Jarvis being gone, no longer being there to look after him or help him when there was no one else to turn to. Darcy was safe, though, she wasn’t hurt.
“Without a hitch,” Phil said mildly, following along with the conversation with ease.
coffee with Steve.
“My bad,” Tony offered the empty grin he’d perfected for the media what felt like a lifetime ago.
Steve resisted the urge to roll his eyes, knowing Clint enjoyed a good bar fight as much as the next man.
She looked around for a moment, eyes trailing over the crowds before she paused in recognition.
Darcy, who apparently knew him better than he’d ever realised, intercepted him on his way to his workshop and all but frog-marched him to the communal level of the Tower. Where everyone else was. All eating and chatting like every morning, but with the occasional sly, pointed look directed at either Tony or Steve.
Steve couldn’t help but smile fondly before he moved to shove everything back into the cupboard, no one would notice if it was a bit messier than usual. And if Steve’s dick was half-hard in his pants while he did it and his thoughts carried the image of Tony moving rhythmically and making a similar, more pleasured version of that ‘yes’ in a slightly different situation, well, that was his business.
She looked like she might argue with him for a moment before seeming to give in.
Stopping before the door to the room right next to his own, Jarvis removed his hand from Tony's shoulder and gestured to the door encouragingly.
“Now, Stark, tell me: how does all of this make you feel? I’m looking to understand the minds of both the good and the bad, so your honesty is appreciated,” Traveller said, voice still as pleasant as if Tony was paying him thousands of dollars an hour to sit on his couch and natter on about his depressing childhood.
Glancing around the room, Tony felt himself consciously relax. Maybe, he didn’t need to be so alert around these people.
There is no excuse. I am just late at posting this, exceptionally late.
“Yeah, I could go for something to eat,” she nodded, pushing herself to her feet and reaching out to give his hand another small squeeze before releasing it and stretching her arms over her head.
Steve thought Bruce and Jane would get along well. Glancing at Tony, Steve could see he was curious about her profession and was just about to settle in and patiently wait for them to go through the ins and outs of it, when Darcy suddenly reached out and slapped at Jane’s arm.
“You may, however, wish to get to the kitchen before her in an effort to prevent another baking session,” Jarvis suggested.
Tony laughed at him, ratty bag slung over his shoulder as he stood at the top of the ramp, one step away from being inside the airlock.
“Pepper said no,” Tony grumbled, a frown crossing his face even years after the refusal. Owning a coffee factory would have been awesome.
Why did this always seem to happen to them?
“You’re actually serious, aren’t you?” Tony asked, appearing baffled at why anyone would be offering him a position in a crew.
The danger now passed, Steve took a moment to catalogue the man, taking in the van dyke, dark hair, and eyes that were a warm brown colour. He was fairly attractive, despite the redness on the side of his jaw that hinted at the impressive bruise he’d have come tomorrow. His stature was smaller than Steve, more of a compact build, but with more streamlined muscle than Clint. He was definitely someone who, if Steve met him at a bar and felt so inclined, he could lose a few hours talking with.
Giving a small nod of his head, though he still had no idea why they were suddenly going to be heading for Timbetpal with such urgency, Steve left the engine room and headed once more for the front of the ship. He had to tell Clint that they needed to change course if they wanted to reach the planet with any kind of expedience.
A moment later, the book was passed to Steve and he looked at it with interest. It had been fairly well made, though it was clear that it was quite old now. Bound in broken leather, expensive, it was clearly somebody’s notebook of some kind rather than an actual book – a rarity these days to find the latter. Opening it, Steve could see the fancy handwriting littering the page, whoever had written this had been educated, and well for the degree of flourish involved with the penmanship.
The bastard had the sheer nerve to paralyze him with his own invention, threaten both Darcy and Pepper, the two most important women in his life, and then finally to rip the arc reactor out of his chest as the cherry on top of the shit cake that was currently his life. He was going to get to the spare in the workshop, no matter how hard it was to move, or how agonizing it was as the little bits of shrapnel sliced into him, heading for his heart.
- Oh, get out of here
“Tony, seriously. I, I know I can’t really do much, but if you need anything, anything from a friend and not one of the business partners, or clients, or associates…” Rhodey looked at him, eyes far too knowing for Tony’s taste.
“I can’t stay,” Phil ignored him, which was just rude considering Tony was pretty sure he hadn’t come to talk to either Pepper or Darcy.
Steve felt the bottom of his stomach drop as only years of training kept him seated at the table. The desire to jump to his feet in horror was almost overwhelming.
“Totally not. Love you. Got to go. Bye!” The screen went black as she disconnected the call.
Steve resumed eating his meal as if nothing was out of the ordinary. The last thing he needed was for a mechanic to be sniffing around in his business, especially one that they knew nothing about.
Steve was caught mid laughter with Tony when Clint’s voice sounded over the PA system.
Final words said, the door shut. Tony waited until the elevator had started moving before covering his face with a hand.
There was silence in the kitchen for a moment as everyone waited for Fury’s response.
His computer chirped loudly.
“Seem to know your way around engine parts, too.”
“High radiation readin’s, Captain. No containment core detected either,” Clint suddenly said, fingers flicking a series of switches as readings scrolled across one of the screens.
Just an hour and then he’d head back to the workshop and finish off some of those projects. He might even think about starting on that Starkphone… maybe.
Leaning back slightly from where he was finalising the code for his beta test AI robot, Tony idly scratched at his cheek with a blunt fingernail.
“I’ll be back tomorrow morning,” she said, adjusting the scarf slightly as they made their way to where the rest of the crew were waiting at the ramp.
“I have never said anything like that.”
“Did you miss me?” Tony tried for a joke, his throat tight as exhaustion threatened to hit him hard.
“This ain’t about likin’ your ship, Steve. I need to get to Timbetpal, and soon.”
“How far away are they, Clint?” Steve asked, glancing at the window that showed only the debris before them.
“Tony, I need you to listen to me very carefully, okay? You have never been a superhero, never any kind of hero at all. You were drunk and stupid and hit a tree, which knocked the sense out of you. Your sister won’t even talk to you anymore because of your delusions and, frankly, you’re close to becoming a helpless case for me as well. There’s only so much I can do to try and help you if you’re not willing to help yourself. Maybe, if you hadn’t of been such a failure, this would never have happened,” Steve sighed, a great heaved upon sound as if Tony was a perpetual problem that he was forced to deal with.
Clearly, they knew one another well.
Tony,” Bruce looked pale and slightly nauseated, his eyes locked on Tony who had dropped his eyes and was now determinedly staring at Steve himself, daring him to say something.
“I don’t think any of you have any kind of leg to stand on. I’m sure you workout in the gym or something equally mindless when you need to let your mind wander and think through things without actively thinking about them.”
“Pepper, my new darling. What’re you doing down here?” he asked casually, deciding to act as normal as possible. Honestly, if the woman had any chance in hell of lasting in her new job as Tony Stark’s Personal Assistant, then she had better be able to roll with the punches, no matter how formless or out of left field they were.
“You too,” he said, still conscious of the tension coming off of his mechanic.
“Get. Up,” she brought her hands down on his blanket covered stomach, causing him to let out an ‘ouf’ of air. The bed dipped as she leaned up onto it, before he felt the tell-tale breathing near his ear. So, help him god, if she yelled right now, he’d-
“Let’s find the main control room, we might be able to restore oxygen levels if nothin’ else,” Steve directed Thor, who nodded mutely, eyes trained on their surroundings as he hefted his gun.
The control room for The Avenger was full of switches and little lights, screens that showed various vitals of the ship, images from the outside and detective radars. Overseeing all of the controls was the large reinforced window that allowed the crew to look out into the Dark. In the large chair manning the controls sat Clint, hands moving familiarly over the buttons and switches with years of experience. Leaning against the console out of the way was Natasha, a certified Companion of the Universe.
“I, uh, I,” Steve trailed off, eyes locked on the slowly rotating holoscreen before him that showed Clint’s quiver, pulled apart and expanded.
“What the hell was I thinking?” he muttered, staring down at the robot and kicking himself for ever thinking he should be proud of it.
Looking up slowly, Steve felt his suspicions resurface as his eyes landed on Tony. The mechanic looked energised from the firefight and quick escape, but there was no trace of the panic or fear a normal person would be displaying after such an event.
. Before Tony could fight it, the thought was nestled deep in his mind and his heart gave a thump that felt harder than any before it.
like that. Steve was morning kisses on the top of his head as Tony tried not to drown himself in his coffee cup. He was gentle hands to the small of Tony’s back when they were going somewhere, not pushing him, but encouraging and reassuring Tony with his presence. He was large smiles and deep rumbling laughter that always made Tony feel warm inside. It was snuggling on the couch while watching TV - to the point where Darcy had bought herself a bean bag off the Internet that had little dancing Hulk's on it, and abandoned the duo to the three-seater couch - while fighting off Clint when he tried to steal said bean bag. He was holding hands on top of the table while they were having dinner with the team and a steady shield when the teasing started. Dating Steve was small, affectionate bushes of lips against lips which devolved quickly into passionate make out sessions and shy touches.
“Is he traveling with us?” Natasha finally asked, sliding up to stand beside Steve. Although the others were loitering in the cargo hold, Steve could hear them quiet down at her question, no doubt curious.
“Forgive me, I became remiss,” Thor sent a wink towards Jane, who was so immersed in her magazine that she didn’t even notice, not that it dampened the gods’ sunny grin.
Steve walked down the cracked pathway of what counted for the main street of Zyskin, absentmindedly perusing the various shops they passed as Tony kept up a running commentary beside him.
Tony tried not to dwell on it, and instead stared at the apparent literal god they had picked up.
“No, Steve,” Tony snarled angrily at the man behind him. “We’re the Avengers - you’re Captain America, for fucks’ sake!”
“Hi, Pepper,” Darcy’s voice shook Tony from his memory as she waved to the older woman, who had moved into view of the screen when she’d seen who was calling him.
The man looked up, blinked twice in surprise before looking around in confusion, a small blush working its way onto his cheeks.
“Why? What happened?” she asked, distracted.
“They do,” Steve said, eyes tracking the article. “It’s on page four.”
- at school to like him, had gone along willingly. He was shoved into a small backyard shed at the boys’ house and it had only been because he’d made such a racket banging and yelling at the door to be let out that the neighbours had called the cops, that he’d even been found.
“I’m surprised you don’t own a coffee factory or something,” Steve said, still smiling.
The room seemed to hold its breath, except for Tony who was smiling lazily now, that humming sound coming and going every few seconds, as if he couldn’t quite remember a tune.
Feeling along the edges for the release catch, he pushed it down on the first box and the lid popped up slightly with a hiss of air as the pressurised seal was broken. Pushing it back fully, Steve peered inside.
It didn’t take long for Steve to see that there wasn’t anything salvageable where he was, whatever had destroyed the ship had ripped open most of the possible compartment holds in the process and whatever had been stored there had no doubt drifted into the Dark already.
“Throw this away, would you, Jarvis?” he asked stiffly looking ahead and making a point of not watching as the older man took the metal from him.
“So, yeah,” Tony cleared his throat awkwardly.
“Come on, Stevie, baby, come on.” Tony muttered, hands sweeping over Steve’s back and up into his hair, gripping tightly for a moment before going down again and finding his bum to squeeze.
It was then that Tony realised with a bit of a jolt, that Steve was going to pay for his drink. He didn’t think he could remember the last time a date had paid for anything for him, and mostly with good reason. He wasn’t a billionaire just so he could have other people pay his way.
“Mmm.”
“No, nothin’ that excitin’. Just lost interest in this planet, is all, time for a change,” she said.
Tony shifted closer to her, wrapping an arm around her shoulders and pulling her into his chest, Dummy now awkwardly sandwiched between them.
“Love you, too.”
Better to stay under the radar, to live a lawless existence outside of USC eyes. Besides, Steve enjoyed his life more now than he ever had as a soldier.
He’d managed to escape from Pepper and find sanctuary in his workshop for the past two days before Darcy had tracked him down and demanded he come up to the kitchen where she’d made caramel and chocolate popcorn. When asked why, she’d rolled her eyes and said: ‘because I want to watch Disney movies and you’re going to watch them with me’.
coffee, that is - that they’d no doubt be met with some kind of bodily harm.
He wasn’t sure how long he laid prone on the chaise, but the sound of shoes approaching him caused him to push himself up so that he was more slumped than collapsed against the minimally comfortable piece of furniture, as his eyes finally began to clear enough for him to make out the nightmare brought to life before him.
“Serious? What’s Tony doin’ takin’ things from there and buryin’ them all the way out here?” Clint asked, peering closer at the notebook in Steve’s hand.
“Tony,” she whined. “We agreed that event should never be spoken of again. I’m going to need so much therapy over that,” she sighed loudly.
“Sure. Though I wonder what Culver thinks of you wearing MIT merch.”
Tony landed on the balcony platform at the Tower, the spinning discs that removed his armour activating immediately. As he began the walk, Jarvis suddenly piped up in his ear.
“I thought…” Steve started, now looking embarrassed and like he was backtracking, the hand leaving Tony’s and moving to run through his hair, blue eyes darting to the side.
Steve had, honestly, been surprised at his refusal. Bruce wasn’t a big talker, nor did he constantly desire company, but he got along well enough with the rest of the crew that Steve knew he’d find something of a home with them. But, Bruce was adamant that he wasn’t part of the crew, and every now and then he’d disappear onto a planet while the rest of them went off to do a job or two before happening to swing by and find Bruce ready to move on again. In a way, it was almost like the arrangement Steve had with Natasha, the companion occasionally going off to conduct business and earn some legitimate money, between the various illegal jobs they took.
Tadamori wasn’t a particularly big planet, nor one of much consequence to the rest of the ‘verse. It was, however, always hot, with the rainfall count measuring one day every few years. Due to the unrelenting heat of its two-day rotation around its sun star (Earth-that-was time), any and all structures were dug underground. The towns themselves were identifiable only by the series of mound entrances rather than bustling streets. Rumour was that the planet had been abandoned by the USC after they realised how inhospitable it was; however – like a weed – people had raised their families and set up their lives in the heat. The planet was, however, semi-known for the stones that could be minded out from under its crust. Once dyed and polished, the stones were often used in costume jewellery due to their intricately patterned reflective surfaces.
“Just be glad we’ve managed to escape both the USC and the Reavers today.
After a moment, Steve let out an annoyed huff before surging to his feet, hands gripping Tony under his thighs as the genius keened, hands tightening around Steve’s neck. Turning around, Steve lowered Tony onto the couch before pulling roughly at his jeans and underwear until Tony was completely bare, cheeks flushed, chest rising and falling, legs parting willingly as his dark brown eyes stared up at Steve as if this was the only thing Tony had ever needed. Quickly undoing his own pants, Steve pushed away the unwanted clothing until he was nude as well before climbing onto the couch so that Tony could wrap his legs around his waist, Steve’s arms keeping him from crushing the smaller man as he immediately went back in for the delicious skin on Tony’s throat.
Steve smiled, feeling almost indulgent of the stupid shortening of the title that Tony had taken to calling him. Usually, it just increased his exasperation with whatever Tony was doing at the time, but the ale was working wonders and he found he didn’t have the energy to be even mildly irritated right now.
When they’d burst into that room and found Tony standing over the body of the head of SG, Steve had never been so relieved that they hadn’t burst into the opposite scene.
“Hey, Steve,” he didn’t look at the Captain as he spoke, eyes still locked on the book. “I know it’s a bit out of our way, but I really need to go to Timbetpal. The sooner, the better.”
“That’s it, baby, get it nice and wet.” Steve groaned loudly when Tony lightly bit at his digit. Leaning back in so that he was breathing directly into Tony’s ear, Steve whispered.
“Yes, it’s fine. Clint, get everythin’ back the way it was, please.”
do an amazing job on his nails.
“I ain’t that eager to leave your crew just yet, Captain,” he gave Steve a small nod, then disappeared from the room, footsteps echoing towards the engine room.
“It’s been… shiny. Thanks for the lift, been ages since I was on such a good ship.” He suddenly grinned, the corners of his eyes crinkling slightly, a prelude to the laugh lines he’d grow into when he was older. “Your crews okay too, I suppose.”
They had decided that Stone’s laboratory was the first place they would investigate. While he could be holding the doctor in his wing in the Fujikawa estate, Steve was pretty sure they it was a little too on the nose for what he’d heard over the galactic news broadcasts of Tiberius Stone. The man certainly wasn’t the smartest rich man in the ‘verse, but if the way he’d swooped in on various intergalactic deals with multi-galactic companies was any indication, then he was capable of being somewhat shady and manipulative.
“Isn’t that Captain America?” Darcy suddenly asked, eyes staring at the screen in the middle. Tony’s eyes snapped over to it, his breath catching in his throat.
“Oh, and hold onto this for me,” he shoved the frayed pressure belt into the large mans’ hands as he passed him.
“Hey, guys, I think we’ve got more than just Doom out here,” Clint said, gaining the attention of his fellow Avengers from where he was squinting down at the radar image.
Tony’s mind literally blanked for a moment. The data was not computing at all.
When she approached him the next morning on the catwalk of the ship’s cargo hold, Steve’s instinctive fight or flight responses immediately lit up. Like a predator well accustomed to her prey’s attempts at escape – of which Steve had attempted many times before – she slid an arm through his own where he’d been leaning them against the safety-rail and pinned him there.
Even the sound of people around them and burning corn husks couldn’t hide the snort of derision from Tony.
Thirdly, getting one up on a government official dick never got old.
A part of Steve, the part he tried to ignore as it was firmly fixed on mentally cataloguing everything Tony did, wanted to capture this moment forever. The way the rest of the bar had fallen into the background, how Tony’s skin was softened by the dismal lighting. The sheen of sweat on his brow from the drink, the warmth of his brown eyes as they stared back at Steve with amused confusion.
“Great, so how do we beat him?” Clint asked.
The bartender leaned back as well, hand slipping casually into his pocket before he set about making a drink for Tony which he deposited on the countertop before moving away to serve someone else.
“Mmm, Steve?” Tony murmured, hand coming up to grip at the hand Steve had rested on his stomach.
“Dammit, Darcy!” Tony whirled around, furious. “You don’t understand. That was my name on those weapons. All the innocent people who were killed or hurt because of me and what I’d created; what I’ve let slip through my fingers because of my willingness to ignore the hard parts, the difficult decisions, the things I said were too boring for me to bother with,” deflating, Tony sighed and ran a hand through his sweaty hair as he sat leaning against one of the desks.
“Steve, come on, fuck me for fucks sake. Come on!” Tony grumbled when he deemed Steve to have taken too long. Steve slid his arms around so that they were slightly underneath Tony and he could hook his hands up and around Tony’s shoulders, thus preventing the genius from moving anyway and giving Steve leverage for when he delivered on his promise.
Steve led Tony into the ship, their hands still innocently clasped between them, Tony for once strangely quiet.
“Don’t be jealous, Captain Handsome, I’m sure someone will get their freak on with you soon enough,” Darcy winked at him, causing him to splutter and almost drop the pancake onto the stovetop.
“We’re okay,” Natasha replied, straightening up from where she’d fallen against Clint’s chair.
Steve snorted himself, unconcerned with offending Thor as he launched into the familiar tale of the lady he had once had a romantic entanglement with that had ended abruptly when the government had caught wind that Thor wasn’t a simple merchant like he’d said he was. According to Thor, he would one day return for Jane, and she had promised to wait for him. However, from the various other stories Thor had told them about Jane, Steve was inclined to believe that Jane would one day just show up, having tracked down Thor when she’d gotten fed up with waiting.
“Something actually helpful, Iron Man.”
Unfortunately, Clint was also quick to pick up on this and in his usual highly immature nature, according to Steve that was, began loading pointed comments towards Tony whenever he came across the man in one of his cleaning spells.
“What do you think, Tony?” Steve asked once the sound of footsteps had faded.
No more lives needlessly lost because of his ignorance. No more people hurt because they weren’t part of the profit margins. No more ignoring the problems.
“Maybe I should come home this weekend?” he said slowly, half to himself and half to Jarvis. He wasn’t sure if it was too soon to be returning home, even just for a night.
Steve quietly stared through the observation window into the infirmary, his arms crossed over his chest and eyes fixed on the now peaceful figure sleeping on the lone medical seat.
“What can I do for you, Cap?” Tony asked, still patting Dummy in a way he would later deny was reminisce of Doctor Evil in Austen Powers - not that the other man would understand the reference when he’d never actually seen the movies.
“Ready?” Steve asked, looking back at Thor who hefted his gun and pointed it at the door, ready for anything that may await them on the other side.
“That depends; how much trouble are you in with Pepper?” Darcy asked with a raised eyebrow, her arm still stirring the batter in the bowl.
Steve frowned.
– Everyone in the universe
“I would never do anything to hurt Tony,” she reared back, offended.
“Sightseein' is nothin’ to travellin’ around and seein’ all the planets with you. Let’s just enjoy our ale while we’re here, then we can start our next adventure when Natasha returns tomorrow.”
He remained silent and she eventually sighed.
“What are we up against, Sir?” Natasha asked; shooting Tony a look that promised pain if he didn’t shut up.
– demon woman
Natasha was playing a game of Tall Card with Bruce and Thor in the dining room, the trio most likely betting ship chores as their currency. As usual, Natasha was winning, however Bruce wasn’t too far behind her. If Thor had any sense he’d have backed out by now, but Steve was sure the man would end up with the majority of the ships’ chores for the next Earth-that-was month.
“Well, this is me,” Steve cut in softly as the doors opened to his floor, and Tony couldn’t help but glance into Steve’s floor.
“Okay, let’s show you your new favourite room.”
to tell me how you feel,” Traveller looked gleeful, but Natasha, unwilling to take any chances, moved faster than Tony’s still muddled mind could track and struck him hard across the face with her gun, effectively knocking him out.
“Come on, it’s time for bed anyway,” he pulled her up and into his arms, leaving the room without glancing towards the broken robot that was making weak noises as its ear was glitching up and down repetitively. Darcy wisely didn’t mention it either.
“My father is currently playing host to a rival tycoon, a mister Tiberius Stone of Viastone. It is my understanding from some informants, that Stone is responsible for Doctor Cho’s kidnapping.”
“What the hell!” Clint squawked, wrenching his arm away and sending Tony a totally unjustified glare, gaining the attention of the rest of the room in the process.
“I’m kind of busy,” Tony hedged, the idea of facing everyone at once not at all appealing.
“We were passin’ by this area, and I remembered someone talkin’ about this festival a few years ago. Thought we’d check it out,” Tony offered, a smile on his face as he redirected his attention to her.
He didn’t see anyone else until he had to pass through the kitchen, but there was some kind of drinking game happening between Darcy, Clint, and Natasha, with Bruce sitting at the head of the table, a chalk slate before him to keep score.
Mind made up, he took a step to the side and swept out an arm as if in invitation for Pepper to board his ship.
It was no secret among the crew of The Avenger that no one amongst them liked the USC overly much. They all had their own stories – their own difficult histories when dealing with the government group. If Steve was being honest, he was a little surprised the ship hadn’t been tagged by now, in one of those ‘capture first, ask questions later’ kind of coups.
“I don’t suppose any of your ‘work’ is the specs for the new Starkphone that were meant to be finished last Friday?” she asked, eyebrow raised and arms crossed.
Steve was just happy when they made it to the ship without incident, or seeing any of his crew along the way.
“Tony, trust me. No one else has a chance at developing the right kind of machines in order to find this crazy scientist turned monster,” Obie said seriously, hand coming to rest companionably on Tony’s shoulder.
“Do you understand now?” Steve asked softly, breaking Tony out of his reflective thoughts, fingers still running over Sparky in his lap.
“Please, I need you to make my father take this seriously. I need you to get my sister back as fast and as safely as possible,” Tony said quietly, refusing to acknowledge the begging tone in his voice.
Kidnapping! Betrayal! What is Happening Behind the Closed Doors of Stark Galactic?
“You look like you haven’t slept in a week.”
“You almost died two months ago,” she reached out and gave his hand a brief squeeze. “I know you say you’re ‘fine’, I just worry about your
“I came to make sure, well, I wanted to see that you were… dealing, with it all, okay,” the man hesitantly pushed the words out, his whole demeanour uncomfortable.
“Well, you remember how I sent you that photo of that weird guy I may or may not have tased?” she asked slowly.
“We decided to do some stuff in New York for a bit,” Darcy said, pulling back with an innocent look on her face that immediately made Tony weary.
“Ah…” Tony looked indecisive for a few seconds before he shrugged as well as he could when still tied to a chair. “I may or may not be on one of their wanted lists,” he admitted.
Walking back into the belly of the ship, Steve finally found his wayward passenger in the engine room, up to his elbows in the bullet shaped engine.
“Tony! Jack’s an aspiring reporter, what do you expect when he comes over?”
hung in the air. “You’ll be so black and blue you’ll have to work with broken fingers.”
“Teen-age-er! Teenager, Tony!”
“Where’s your nanny, girl?” Howard demanded, body half angled towards her and a deep frown already forming on his face.
“I’m just passin’ through. I was with another ship of scientists, but when they left planet I decided it was time for a change. My friend and me stayed behind, but we’re lookin’ to move along again. My friend’s actually lookin’ for someone, and I said I’d stick with her until she found him.”
“Come on, let’s go find the perfect spot for your tower.”
Steve chuckled quietly as he sat at the table with the rest of his crew, nursing his mug of cider that they’d picked up months ago from a Rim planet.
“I wasn’t planning on it,” Tony replied, his voice faintly amused.
Dragging his eyes away from staring into the Dark, people who did that for too long went mad, Steve focused on pulling himself along the side of the cargo bay so that he could access what had once been the inside of it. The com in his ear crackled to life and he glanced awkwardly to his side, the helmet of his suit obstructing much of his view, to see Thor coming up next to him.
Steve sent him a knowing smile, and Tony really had to re-evaluate his idea of Steve being some kind of mind reader because seriously, every time?
Raising his right hand, he cradled the right side of his head, feeling the matted, sticky texture of blood in his hair. It was mostly dry now, so he’d been out for a while, but the tacky feel on his skin went all the way down his neck and had soaked into his shirt, staining the material. An irrational feeling of annoyance swept through him, as he realised that his shirt was probably a throw away. He didn’t have that many items of clothing, so whenever one was ruined it felt stupidly personal.
Instead, the man was tucked into the corner of one of the honeycomb-shaped walls, his legs folded up to his chest and arms wrapped around them. A well-worn book was sitting on the floor before him, its cover showing the wear and tear of time.
“Well, let’s get on board and have a look,” he finally said, rolling his shoulders before pressing the intercom button.
Steve wasn’t fooled for a moment, his well-practiced eyes caught sight of the small slip of paper Tony palmed off to the man over the countertop, disguised as a friendly slap on the shoulder as he pulled back with a small smile.
Tony just smiled at him easily, hands slipping back into the water.
Tony tore his attention away from the glass dome he’d clearly been trying to work out the engineering behind since they’d arrived underwater.
“It was a waste of valuable time. How do you expect to take over Stark Industries one day if you can’t even conduct yourself appropriately now? You’re fifteen, Anthony, the only projects you should be working on are to benefit the company. Time to grow the fuck up,” he took a menacing step towards Tony, finger extended in his direction.
“News flash, no one sounds fine when they’re fighting the bad guy of the week, in case you hadn’t noticed,” he snapped, wishing desperately that he could be anywhere else.
It was all horribly domestic.
“Important,” he patted Bruce’s chest again before letting his arm fall back onto the operating chair, apparently finished with his ‘I told you so’ for now.
“Seeing as we all know you’re not going to talk to any psychiatrists’, we’re giving you the option of talking to us about what happened today,” Steve explained.
Warmth bloomed in Steve’s chest at his words. Sparing a brief glance at Thor, who was hungrily eyeing a stall with fried squid on display, he steeled himself as his brief conversation with Natasha earlier echoed in the back of his mind.
“Oh, you know. Lots of parties, the people on my floor are pretty cool, and my classes are interesting enough,” she shrugged, the whole frame lifting and falling with the motion. Tony had offered to buy a house for her to live in, off campus, but she’d insisted that she liked the idea of having the ‘real college experience’.
He’d thought that after the reveal of Tony’s history, of his entanglement with the Ten Rings, there couldn’t be much more that he was hiding. The soft blue light glowing in his chest seemed to mock Steve.
“But, I didn’t,” Tony didn’t know what he was going to say, his voice lost and his throat too tight to get anything except a whistling breath through.
“Hey, Jane,” Darcy said, coming to a stop and glancing back to make sure that Steve and Tony had followed her.
“No, it’s not him. It’s some guy who says he goes to MIT with you.”
Maybe, maybe this was real?
“Thanks, Tony. Really, that means a lot.”
Thor, however, didn’t get the memo and suddenly the blonds thick arm swung around his shoulders and Steve had to lock his knees to keep from going under from the added weight.
Steve had just assumed that it had to do with the man’s ridiculous secrets that seemed to be catching up with him wherever they went in the ‘verse. But, what if the reason he hadn’t wanted to come here wasn’t to do with his past, but his present? He had to consider that it might have been the crew themselves that Tony had been trying to keep away from the planet.
“Somethin’ big,” Darcy said, shock and the beginnings of excitement in her voice.
“You only like him because he’s seen the Hulk,” Tony muttered with a roll of his eyes.
“Who cares about the vanilla bean, the is the most amazing cake in the entire world is in that oven, and I want some as soon as possible.”
“No, we’re not,” Steve agreed, before turning back to Tony. “Let’s go to the med tent just incase, alright?”
Steve knew he shouldn’t get involved, the fight had nothing to do with him.
Tony was not a fan.
“No? Tony, you have to go to the hospital,” Pepper protested, her chin jutting out slightly in that stubborn way Tony was so familiar with.
“Steve,” Nick jerked his head in acknowledgement.
Clint just grinned at him, momentarily holding his tongue. The pilot had been sprouting various theories since he’d arrived in the infirmary after they’d gotten a decent distance from Yurma and the authorities.
Breathing through a too fast breath, his ribs protested the speed in which he’d inhaled, Tony forced his mind to try and recall what had happened after he’d met up with Pepper.
“Steve,” Natasha said as they stopped before him, her face surprisingly open given the company. “This is an old friend of mine, Virginia ‘Pepper’ Potts.”
“I thought… I thought I was your helper in the workshop?” she asked quietly.
It was all for nothing, however, as the next instant the elevator doors opened, revealing the man in question in his usual neatly pressed dark suit.
“I’m a giver, Pep. You should know this by now.”
Summer was almost over and Tony was anticipating the start of his first year of high school in the fall. The middle school work he had been doing was easy, but maybe high school would present something of a challenge for him. The kids in high school were older too, so maybe, if he was extremely lucky, they might just leave him alone while he was there. Not like in middle school. Those kids had made it a point every day to remind Tony that he was too young to be there. That he wasn’t welcome.
They were called out into battle with a mad man in a green cloak with a metal mask who called himself
Steve glanced back at Clint, who seemed to have noticed the attention and had frozen in a rather suspicious manner.
“Look, Tony,” Steve sighed and ran a hand down his face before he reached out and clasped Tony’s shoulder.
He had been thinking about this for months now. Admittedly, he probably would have approached it much more slowly and progressively, but as he was on a bit of a time limit these days, he figured that this was something Darcy wouldn’t want to have to be burdened with if the worst should happen.
“I’m here right now,” Tony offered with a lazy grin.
“Tony, you didn’t sound fine before we interrupted,” Clint said, frowning.
“You hate it,” he said.
“Don’t tell me to shut up – we’re being shot at!”
“Darcy?” Rhodey asked, surprised as Tony obligingly tilted the phone so that they could see one another.
What else could Steve say? It was now up to Tony, who turned from him and continued to walk down the catwalks stairs, across the cargo hold and down the ramp into the Ariel sunlight.
Steve thought about it for a moment. They were still technically in the Core planet sector, if only just, and getting caught scavenging a ship here could have dire consequences. However, that ship might still have extra supplies on-board, if the cargo hold was intact. Depending on what they were, it might get them a lot of credits, or it could be food which would prevent them from having to stop off on planet soon to restock before venturing properly into the Rim. Their supplies were too low for such a long trip with no destination, so a little windfall now would be extremely beneficial to them.
It was, by far, the easiest job they’d pulled in over a year.
“He’s really into what’s happening on campus and the world in general, so he makes for a great conversationalist,” Darcy continued, oblivious to Tony’s inner thoughts. “The other guy I met, Jim Wilson, he’s an arts student and really into videoing stuff on his phone.”
Tony just huffed, more amused with a tinge of embarrassment than truly bothered. Besides, Darcy
Upon arriving, Steve followed the waiter to a private room out the back of the establishment, waiting until they’d left them alone in the room to turn and face the other occupant.
“Iron Man, we have a debrief with Fury to get to,” Steve took a step towards him, hand rising as if he was preparing to grab hold of the armour to him to keep him there.
“You will be her best friend.”
“Ow.”
Reaching out, he took Darcy’s hand and solemnly asked for a dance, making a show of it and unintentionally making the older woman swoon.
“I don’t wanna see hide nor hair of you for the whole night, or the Featherbrain gets it,” Tony threatened, a smile hidden at the corner of his mouth.
“I’d rather hear it from you, if you’re up to it,” Steve added, eyes catching on the bandage.
Tony just laughed at them, leaning on the table top, with Bruce sitting beside him, a single mug of ale barely sipped before him.
“I don’t know why I bother saying it, as you never listen to anyone, but you need to take better care of yourself.”
“Uh, what’s goin’ on?” Tony asked, glancing between Jane’s rapidly retreating figure and Darcy.
“Hmm, except now you’ll smell like it,” Tony complained half heartedly.
Pushing aside his embarrassment and thoughts of revenge for later, Tony looked out at the underground carpark, a little unimpressed.
Darcy’s elbow suddenly digging into his side wasn’t different at all, however.
“I’m not little, I’m thirteen, a teenager,” Darcy sounded far too pleased about this fact for Tony’s comfort.
“You’re not gonna leave with me, are you, Captain?” A voice came from behind him and Steve could feel a small smile break out over his face for a moment before he forced himself to frown and turn around.
They weren’t that far into the Rim yet, that there wouldn’t be people who passed between the boarder of the Core planets and the outer Rim planets, he supposed. Ariel, however, was a fairly pricey place and not somewhere he would normally go, given the many USC soldiers who holidayed there. However, money was money, and he followed it wherever it led.
Steve just smiled at him, not in the least deterred by Tony’s lacklustre response.
Tony smiled; feeling a tiny bit of the tension that had been coiled in his shoulders relax for the first time in months. They sat in silence, the house quiet around them, only the distant sounds of the Malibu beach reaching their ears.
“Yes. No. Possibly?” The grin that once more spread across his face was most often seen on small children up to no good.
“Here, Sir,” Clint sat up straight in his chair, even though it was only audio and there was no way Fury could actually see him.
They were just about to walk into the kitchen when a smell hit Tony’s nose.
“You know, I gave you a StarkPad so you wouldn’t have to use those bulky papers anymore,” he said casually, zeroing in on the large glass dome that kept all the cupcakes fresh.
“So, you are a man with something worth fighting for,” Yinsen said quietly, and Tony knew he was right.
On the evening of the fourth day, Tony was pulled from fiddling with an upgraded code for the camera software on the newest StarkPhone, by the sudden silence in his workshop. Lifting his head in surprise at the lack of music, he blinked a few times to adjust to looking at something other than codes and schematics, only to tense at seeing Steve heading right for him across the room.
“Thanks,” he said, a soft smile lifting his lips before the moment was broken by Dummy rearing back up and shoving his claw in Tony’s face once again.
Tony’s lips thinned, clearly unhappy with the dismissal, but he just gave a short nod of acquiescent and looked away.
The robot in front of them had suddenly reached out and clasped onto the hem of Tony’s shirt, thankfully on the side Darcy wasn’t leaning against.
“I know, I know, this kind of stuff is usually
Then Doctor Banner spoke up and Tony felt like he’d come home.
“Are we diggin’ it up, Captain?” Clint asked, already squatted down beside the rock and poking it with his finger.
“Hey, I haven’t even said anything!” The archer put up his hands innocently, having learnt his lesson by now that if Steve was around when Tony went into one of his cleaning frenzies, he shouldn’t blatantly hit on him as Steve’s glares were scary.
Tony sent her a winning smile as a moment of silence dragged between the three before Pepper snorted in a distinctly unladylike way that her image of a pencil skirt and high heels would have one believe.
At sixteen, Tony could say without a single doubt, that the worst day of his life thus far had begun with a phone call to his mobile from Jarvis, who proceeded to inform him that his little sister - his
“I don’t mind,” Steve insisted, cheeks turning slightly pink in the light of the TV screen.
“Yeah, yeah.” Tony sighed, holding his sword up at the ready.
Oh, God.
,” Steve cursed again, before steeling his nerves.
Pepper’s lips pressed together in displeasure, her heeled shoes clacking loudly against the ramp as she went to take a step away from the mouth of the ship. Natasha, however, still held loyalty to Steve first and foremost, and slipped up beside the woman, one arm around her waist and the other pressing something that glinted of metal against her side.
“I’ve never seen one in its raw form before.” Steve admitted turning the large diamond in his hand so it caught the light.
“Hey,” she frowned at him.
“You seem to be well informed,” Natasha commented.
“We’re leavin’,” Steve said, voice firm.
Tony hummed, glancing at him before turning back to Clint.
“Yeah, yep, sure. So, like, after breakfast or something?” Tony continued edging away.
“That’s right, Cupcake. I never break them,” he pressed a kiss to her hair.
After the sexual desire had faded, they had firmly established a close friendship and business partnership. Tony, honestly, wouldn’t have it any other way.
He waited patiently while she attempted to mimic the shape of his hand, succeeding more in sticking all but her pointer finger out. Tony obligingly linked his pinky with hers, giving them a brief bop in the air before releasing them. She nodded as if she understood the seriousness of the moment, before her hand moved to her mouth and a thumb slipped between her lips. Tony knew that Miss Mac was trying to break her of the habit, their father having deemed it unacceptable behaviour of a Stark, but Tony couldn’t bring himself to tell her off for it when she’d just been so upset.
