This seemed to amuse Mordo rather than disturb him. “As you say.” He seemed to be doing his best to pretend that Wanda wasn’t there, looking back down at the hands he held clasped loosely in his lap. “And when we land?”
“Yeah, hold on.” He turned off the tablet and pushed all the papers back into the box before securing it and going to the door. “Who is - oh.”
“Yeah, you will,” Tony grits out instead, shoving Rogers away with a Herculean effort and struggling to his feet. His legs feel like putty and he has to grip the edge of the worktop to haul himself upright. “You'll do whatever I fucking want. Because if you don't -”
“You know, in some parts of the world, you rescuing me means we’re married now,” Tony’s mouth said without any input from his brain.
Tony stared blindly at the last flickers of sunlight as they rose above the clouds, his vision blurring into soft focus.
Tony could take him back to the US, could put Steve in school, could see Pepper and Happy, could check on Peter and Harley, could make sure that everything at SI hadn’t caught on fire while he’d been hiding in a cave (again)...
M’Baku made a low sound of amusement at that. “And who is that, exactly?” He raised an eyebrow. “The threat, yes, you have made much of that, and so we will listen. But you must show your worth to us, if we are to have a truce.”
He cut off that train of thought more vehemently than he meant to. He couldn’t think about that now. It was easier to think of them as two separate people who couldn't occupy the same space; thinking about the connection between them was too disturbing.
“As I said,” Mordo said quietly. He held up his hands to Okoye, as if offering them up for the bracelets. “I did not harm anyone. Your colleagues are merely… sleeping.”
“Yes,” Minoru said, her voice honeyed. “Yes, we did, against Kaecilius. With whom we also trained together, and fought together. It seems you cannot trust anyone, these days.”
She held up her teacup in a mock-salute and settled back at the table, Barton sliding into the empty seat beside her. “Take your time.”
“No.” Mordo looked back at him steadily. “What has been done to her - and what she herself does now - is an abomination. And I am not overly fond of monsters.”
“Off,” Tony gasped, and kicked at the swordman’s hand, trying to at least knock the fucking sword away. “Your name wouldn’t be Inigo Montoya, would it?” How was the guy moving so fast? It wasn’t even the combination of the sword and the glowy shield of doom; the guy was never where physics and ten years of solid hand-to-hand fighting had told Tony he would be.
talking about Steve's religion. I'd always assumed Steve was Catholic given his background so was surprised to see the 'P' on his dog-tags. I like the compromise of one Protestant, one Catholic parent. Tony's mother was Carbonell, again fandom assumptions tend to be that she was Italian Catholic, whereas Howard wasn't anything in particular (although I've read some compelling arguments for Howard being Jewish). Either way, I don't see Tony as religious. That said, he would give the matter of Steve's education (religious or otherwise) serious thought and it wouldn't be something he'd rush.
The swordsman’s eyes flickered to him, then back to T’Challa. “Ah, yes, the threat of violence. How original.” He was silent for a moment, calculating. “Very well. As a show of good faith… My name is Karl Mordo. And all I want with your time-altered friend is a link back to…” He hesitated. “To whoever altered him,” he finished.
“Thanks,” he managed after a moment. He cleared his throat. “Anyway, it’s all been squared away with T’Challa, so if anyone has a problem… take it up with him, I guess.” He looked back down at Steve, and
and… well, that’s where natural contrariness came unstuck. Because what could he do instead? Bother Rhodey at physio? Stay by the kid’s bedside and fret over his breathing?
Steve peered up at him from under his fringe, clearly exhausted and terrified. He listed a little to the left, blinking slowly. There was a long dark bruise on his shin and both of his knees were skinned; he'd clearly fallen over more than a couple of times since the whatever-it-was had happened. “Are - are you a robot?”
and hadn’t there been something about a perpetual flame? Or serpents? Something fairly unforgettable, as images went, anyway.
Tony looked around. He’d been hoping that there would be at least a little bit of tech in here so he could get a sneak peek at the famed Wakanda great leap forward, but there wasn’t even a TV in sight. The room was neatly furnished in pale colours, with a box of colourful-looking toys propped against the far wall. The large windows overlooked the gardens below, and a fan spun lazily overhead, stirring the humid air rhythmically.
“I thought you might have some time to see me before the team checks in,” Maximoff said. She held up the tray in her hands as a sort of peace-offering. “I brought tea.”
He resisted the urge to reach back and add to Barton’s headache by thwacking him around the head. It had taken him three hours to go through Dr Foster’s - and Shuri’s - results and conclusions, and nothing in the data set was remotely encouraging. The portals caused significant disturbances to organic matter in the vicinity. The disturbances manifested in radiation signatures, which were, of course, trackable - hence the swordsman’s ability to track Steve down in Birnin Zana. The samples of Steve’s blood collected at the hospital had continued to exhibit those same radiation signatures, and Barton had collected samples from the attack site they had been too late for while Tony had been unconscious - same result. But why the hell was the swordsman after Steve in the first place? What possible use could he have with him that he couldn’t accomplish with any of the other dead, and more easily accessible, victims?
Tony looked back at Steve again. He’d burrowed down into the suit so that only the top of his head was visible. The suit was still in sentry mode, the arms extended and the repulsors powered up. And now that he had the main system up and running, he could probably keep an eye on whether anyone was returning. “Should be okay.” But… “Once we’re out of here, we’ll need to contact the authorities,” he admitted. “Some magic user has been through here, doing some pretty twisted stuff, and they’ll need to mop up.”
His head felt like someone had tenderised it with a meat hammer. “Ow.” His voice was barely above a whisper, dry and papery. “What the fuck happened?” Something cool nudged his lips and he opened his mouth to accept the ice chip.
He closed the folder with a heavy ‘thump’ and set it to one side, bending over the tablet so that his face was almost entirely filling the video-screen. “But I get what you’re saying. I’m not rushing into it, Pep, I promise; I mean, technically others are rushing me into it - but that’s beside the point - but I just, I just -”
may as well have been spray-painted across T’Challa’s forehead. Tony couldn’t remember anything about the king’s sister, or even that he
Tony translated, and mentally shrugged. It was a stroke of luck that Barton had been sent, really; for all that Barton likely wanted to put an arrow in Tony’s head, his loyalty to Rogers hadn’t ever wavered. And he was the only one on the team who had actual parenting experience. If they were lucky, the kid would attach to him on the flight over and once they got checked over by medical, Tony would be able to just… go. He still had to investigate the clusterfuck of nightmare fuel in the other room.
Steve didn’t seem to have anything to say to that, sniffling a little in his sleep and turning to tuck his damp face against Tony’s neck, oblivious to the drama he was causing.
“... thanks.” Tony managed a smile, surprise melting through him. “I mean - yeah. I appreciate it. I think this is the best shot we have, but… thanks.” It was something to bear in mind, maybe. That not everyone was falling into line behind Barnes on this.
Steve shook his head slowly. “No. I woke up where you found me. I looked around. Got cold. Came back.”
“I - ok. Sure, Rhodey.” Tony climbed to his feet slowly. He cast one last look at the small, sleeping form on the bed before following Rhodey down the hallway, away from the PICU.
The first entry with all three keywords was a mere two minutes long, time-stamped 03:22. He should probably leave that one until later, though; he should start at the first one tagged ‘Tony’ and work his way forward chronologically. He should…
Tony had a pretty good idea of what that ‘whatever’ would have been. And given where things were between Barnes and Rogers before Barnes went under again…
He had managed precisely one hour of uninterrupted sleep - Steve drawing peacefully by his side with intense concentration - before he was rudely woken up by -
He left Steve nibbling the edges of one of the crispy little pancakes that had become his go-to food for pretty much every meal (whilst eyeing the jam that was worryingly within reach and also guaranteed to drip everywhere) and quietly went back to the bedroom, closing the door behind him and reaching for the ever-present pebble. Pep would get things going, he was sure, but there was one more call he needed to make.
“My suit is plenty rein- look, that’s neither here nor there. Can we get back to the terrible plan?”
“Yeah,” Tony said, his gaze fixed on the burning blue of the sky outside. He could feel Barton’s eyes on him. “Steve’s OK. He just had a bit of a nightmare. You know what kids are like.” His hands clenched and unclenched on the armrests.
Because - stretched out on the child-sized bed - was Steve, looking even paler than he had been during the flight over. There was a mask over his face, an IV catheter in his arm, and another trailing away from underneath his gown.
Tony exhaled slowly, closing his hand around the knife and tugging it gently from the kid’s lax grip. “Thanks, buddy. I'm just gonna put this to one side so we don't trip over it, okay?” He slid the knife on top of one of the consoles.
“Barton’ll be there, too,” Tony offered feebly, feeling obscurely like he was back in school and had been dragged to explain himself in front of a disapproving teacher. It wasn’t even his fault! He’d pointed out all the flaws in the plan: the fact that the ‘kill’ order was still out, that Tony himself didn’t trust the guy to prioritise the safety of the child over his old buddy, and - oh yeah - Barnes was still a killing machine with a MacGuyvered off-switch preventing him going on a murderous rampage. “That may be,” T’Challa had answered, serene as a fucking monk. “But my sister was the one to install this ‘off-switch’, and if you trust her enough to consult with her about the child, surely you trust her enough on this.” It had been hard to argue with that logic, although Tony had tried. But the fact of the matter was that he couldn’t be with Steve 24/7, and with Vision out of the picture, that left only three sufficiently lethal options for his babysitter-slash-bodyguard: Barnes, Nat, or Wanda. Out of those, Barnes was far and away the best option; he was strong, he was fast, and he was single-minded. If Tony could trust him to place Steve’s safety before everything else, then… well, it couldn’t hurt. And if the price for that was a couple of photostatic veils and Tony forcing himself to be civil to Bucky fucking Barnes, it was cheap at twice the price.
When Tony had been feeling particularly low - over the palladium, or dealing with his nightmares after New York - he’d sometimes wondered what his mother would have said to him, if she’d been around. Because the only voices around him had been those of soldiers, of those who put duty first. Of those who would sacrifice themselves and would sacrifice him, and would not hesitate. But Tony was not a soldier, and so he’d wondered. Would she have wept, but sent him on? Or would her instinct have been to tell him,
Jane was shaking her head. “But that doesn’t correlate to anything, the child was in Wakanda at the time -”
He followed the trail of destruction until he came to what looked like a command centre. The damage was greatest here: the doors had been ripped clean off their hinges, the computers almost entirely destroyed. And, in the centre of it all -
After a moment, Steve lowered the knife. “Okay,” he whispered, his shoulders slumping. He offered the knife up, handle first.
He did not dare look to his side, where Romanoff was carefully looking down at her hands, her expression fixed.
“- have a look around.” At Steve’s panicked look, he held up his hands placatingly. “The suit will keep you safe until I get back, ok? FRIDAY, sentry mode.” Both arms rose, the repulsors powering up.
Tony sighed. “I’m just gonna sit here and read for a bit. You wake up when you’re ready.” He opened up the briefing pack Barton had prepared for him, leaning back in his chair.
There was a longish pause while FRIDAY queried back with the palace, during which time Tony’s brain helpfully provided him with a variety of scenarios, up to and including a 100% casualty rate, a room full of kiddified Dora Milaje, Scarlet Witch and Winter Soldier, and a selection of other horrors hopefully limited to the pages of a Lovecraft novel. He scanned the edge of the distortion field around the palace, looking for any signs of smoke or movement. What was the Wakandan protocol in case of an attack? In the US an attack on a secure building would trigger a lock-down, but with an attacker able to literally walk through walls… If they got through this, he’d need to get himself in a room with the Joint Chiefs. He’d bet his bottom dollar that no one had done any contingency planning for what to do if the attackers stopped observing the laws of physics. The closest anyone had come to it had been Nick Fury’s little tesseract side-project, and look how well
Which was something that Tony had been wondering about himself. He could explain a few days away as a business meeting, but… “What exactly would explain me being out of the country for any length of - oh, you are kidding me! Rhodey, seriously?
Steve nodded, looking pleased at this.  “I drawed it because you’re sick, and my friend always draws me pictures when I’m sick. And then I drawed him ones back!” He beamed, as if this had been a panacea.
Tony had been woken from a thankfully dreamless sleep after six hours and informed in no uncertain terms that he had to man up and face the inevitable:
tl;dr - Mordo's willing to make the call to do unspeakable acts in the name of protecting reality, turns out the rest of the sorcerers, supreme or otherwise, are on the same page (at least according to him), Tony's wondering what the use of oversight is if the people in the room make a morally abhorrent choice to protect the world (and wasn't this what he was trying to get away from when he shut down the weapons division and limited it to his direct control), and yes, all this has done is muddy the waters that extra little bit re: the whole Accords issue that we'll pick up again a bit later on.
“...yeah.” He knew the nurses were keeping a close eye on the kid, so it wouldn’t be that they’d held back pain meds through neglect or to ration them. But, still, he’d speak to the doctor and see if there was anything else they could do. Tony was the one who’d screwed up, not getting him squared away quickly enough; the kid didn’t deserve to suffer because of it.
There was an even longer hesitation. “Deal,” Steve said finally. His nose scrunched up. “I saw it, anyway. Don’t need to see it again.”
As for Wanda… well, he wasn’t deluding himself. He was never going to be square with her. There was too much bad blood between them for that: her bargains, and his choices.
But Shuri was shaking her head. “I don’t think so, it’s not a permanent link. I think the link is reactivating when the portals re-activate.”
Tony grimaced. “Remind me again when it’s down to fifteen minutes.” He needed to find out what the hell had happened. But before then - “keep scanning for danger, and let me know if you detect any activity.”
Small enough to lift and carry - when Tony had the suit on - and certainly small enough to fit in Tony’s arms. And he had no one else.
“I wasn’t aware I needed a defence. Not with you.” She looked up at him from under her lashes. Once upon a time, she’d used this same move to ingratiate herself as Natalie Rushman; later, she’d used it again and again to tease, to show him that she trusted him to handle it. To let him see all the tools at her disposal. Now…
Tony didn’t fight the glass of water or the painkillers, accepting them both with a grimace. “What’s going on? I remember the attack - sort of - and then arriving at the mountain.” The giant mountain guy, he remembered him as well. Shit, maybe he really
After Dhakiya left him to his own devices, Tony instructed the Iron Man suit to park itself in a corner and looked around the rooms. They were indeed as spacious, as neutral and as low-tech as they had first appeared. The kid could spend hours playing in here and not come across anything to confuse or upset him. The box of toys was similarly low-tech, including some board games, some Legos, playing cards and other things that Tony would charitably describe as ‘quaint’.
Steve looked up at Tony for permission, waiting for the barest hint of a nod before immediately starting to battle with the zips and buttons. Tony left him to it, stepping to one side with Romanoff and Barnes. “How’s it looking?” He could assume from her not-stabbed appearance that things were not currently on fire. “He come quietly?”
Tony knew that look; had faced it across conference rooms and training rinks. He had less than a rat’s ass chance in hell of getting anything useful out of Steve once their esteemed leader was in that mood, and he doubted that the kid would be any more cooperative. He hesitated for another moment, trying to figure out what he could say, but in the end it was a lost cause. “OK, well… I’m just down the hall if you need me,” he said and patted Steve’s shoulder again. He slid out of the bed and eased the kid back down on the pillows, fluffing them behind him a little to give him a little bit more elevation for his chest. “Just - just call if you need something,” he said finally, lost.
Having seen it in person didn’t make the images any easier to stomach. Tony looked away from the screen to where Rhodey was watching the slide-deck, his expression hard. The wheelchair was the same one he’d been using in the US, the one Tony had fiddled with a little; it was sleeker and more streamlined than the standard issue ones, and better cushioned for excellent lumbar support. The prototype of the braces Tony had designed was stashed underneath.
Wanda broke in before T’Challa could answer, her hand still on Tony’s arm. “Tony,” she said again, quiet and sure. “Tony, please. I would not let any harm come to Steve. Believe me on this.”
“Heads up, Cap’s been shrunk into a kidlet,” Barton offered, closing the door and stowing their gear away. “Suggest we get him unshrunk as soon as possible. Also, something seriously freaky went down in that base. It’s Lovecraftian levels of fucked up in there.” He glanced across to where Steve was slumped in Tony’s arms. “Uh, messed up,” he corrected himself.
“Why does it always have to be the costumed lot,” Tony muttered, staring with appalled fascination at the attacker, who in addition to holding up the guard with one hand, was also wielding a
birthday.” He held up his arms to demonstrate the immensity of the occasion, narrowly escaping clouting Tony about the head in his enthusiasm. “
It really wasn’t, Tony had realised with a sinking feeling. He’d shooed Barton out - shoving the entire fruit bowl at him in his haste to get him out of the door - and gone back to packing.
Tony couldn’t spare her a look, too busy staring down the silent Barnes. Maybe he could persuade T’Challa to assign some guards to accompany Barnes whenever he was with the kid. Just to be on the safe side. Just in case...
of that look. It had pissed off both Obie and Fury in equal measure; Tony should have received a fucking
On the other side of the room, flanked by the two Dora Milaje guards and a grim-looking Barton, Barnes was staring at Steve as if the kid had just stuck a knife in his gut.
standards to maintain, and he’d done a fair job of complimenting her on her terrifying attributes, which seemed to both go over well and make her rather amused. (Always charm your hosts, especially if they looked like they could break you in two without breaking a sweat. Tony had always had a thing for frightening capable women, and even though Dhakiya had shown little to no interest, it surely didn’t hurt to be friendly.)
And… look, he was never going to be Barnes’s biggest fan. Once the kid was gone and that asshole Rogers was back, things would be a lot simpler; he could be angry and hurt and assholish to both supersoldiers without any twinge of his conscience. But until then, the best solution would be to hand Steve over, and go and figure out how to turn him back.
4am. Even royalty couldn’t expect you to be perfectly coiffed in the middle of the night with 30 seconds’ notice. It would do.
An army convinced it was right, fighting for what they believed was the greater good. The thing that would spare the world untold horrors.
It took Steve a long time to process this. He stared down at his feet and didn’t say anything, his brow furrowed.
“OK,” Pepper sighed, as if all the fight had gone out of her. “I’ll arrange it. Send me a list of anything you’ve decided on, and I’ll figure the rest out.”
- would want that; that he’d be OK with knowing all his secrets had been laid bare for Tony to inspect and discard. Maybe it was supposed to be poetic justice, or something simpler, baser; flaying Steve open so that Tony could assure himself that there was nothing hidden away… (Was that what Maximoff had intended when she came to him in his dream? Was that why she’d showed him Steve’s nightmare?)
After a few soft beeps of delay, he ended up face to face with Sam Wilson. “Oh, it’s you,” he said, unable to keep the disappointment from his face. “Is Rhodey there?”
Silently, the two of them exited, leaving the others behind. Tony looked at Shuri. “Princess. Do I want to know?”
Maybe it was just another drawing in a folder of them, and the rest were all of Steve and his mother. Maybe he had a dozen drawings of the kid version of Barnes, and another dozen of Barnes saving him from Mordo. Maybe he...
“OK,” Tony said, too loudly, trying to be heard over the roar in his ears, “now that everyone is friends again, can we please get underway, I have a small child to collect from his babysitter.” He dipped his head in acknowledgement to Minoru. “Master Minoru, many thanks for waking our sleeping beauties, if your buddy tries it again we will definitely come back to you after taking his head off clean at the shoulders. D’you have a card? Of course you don’t, you’re a wizard, wizards don’t have cards - ah.” He looked down at the card, then back up at Minoru’s smirk. “OK, well, that’s - Outlook, really? That’s who you’ve gone with? No, no judgement -”
The main computer was a piece of junk. He’d never been less enthused about being on his back for any piece of teach. “I have calculators more powerful than you, and I am frankly offended to be in the presence of something so ancient,” he informed it, half-wedged inside the console to get a better look. He’d dumped whatever he could of the data core into a portable back-up, and had been trying to figure out what was wrong with the comms system. It looked like some of the wiring was even more lowest-bidder than normal. “My kingdom for a transistor radio,” he muttered, starting to strip the wires.
Tony breathed hard, trying to push back the instinctive panic at being startled awake. “Don’t fucking
Barton did not bring him Jane Foster’s notes, or anything remotely useful. (Tony was starting to get paranoid that everything was being withheld until he could prove he could tie his shoelaces.) He didn’t even bring Tony a sandwich, instead depositing a rainbow shake - complete with straw - in front of him.
a massive formative trauma. So - not excusing, but explaining -I'd like to think that she could be given a second chance to redeem herself and fix her earlier mistakes. That said, I don't think that putting her on a combat team with zero therapy was the best approach. And I really disagreed with Tony bringing Peter to the fight, when he had every reason to expect the Winter Soldier and/or Wanda to be there.
Maximoff nodded to herself. “Then I will join those reviewing the footage. It may be that I can spot disturbances of that nature.”
He jolted awake and almost fell off the edge of the bed, grabbing hold of the headboard and putting a foot on the ground to steady himself.
Barton had the grace to look away at that. “I thought it was a bad idea, and I still do,” he muttered. “I argued against it. I wanted to tell you; Christ, Tony, you have to believe that. But you’d just had fucking brain surgery! I knew if I said something you’d be trying to get into the suit, and -”
Barton’s shoulders slumped. “I’ll get him.” He staggered to his feet, swaying a little. He put the cup of ice chips down on the little table beside the ever-present pebble. “He was - he’s
“I figure I can protect Steve more effectively when I’m not in a crippled suit.” Tony stared back at her. “Legolas and the murderbot are no lightweights in the carnage department, either. And I also figured you guys might keep an eye on the West Coast. You know, just in case.”
Tony closed his eyes, the cool metal soothing against his skin. “... You should have told me. I don’t care if I was concussed, or post-op, or bleeding from my fucking brain. Something like this? You should have told me.”
Hey, apologies for the missed week, I was on holiday. Please enjoy this longer-than-usual chapter as recompense.
It wasn’t as though he was exempting himself from that category; he’d lied plenty to Rhodey and to Pepper, both for their own good and when he couldn’t find the words to make himself understood. He’d lied to his dad compulsively; he’d lied to his teachers, to senators, to
They got the rest of their stuff squared away, Barton picking up all the various backups that Tony had ripped out of the main console - and the remnants of Steve’s abandoned armour - and stuffing them in the carry-all. “Okay, ready?”
On cue, Steve twisted against Tony’s side so his face was filling the projection. He gave Rhodey the stink-eye. “You said ‘dick’!”
Kudos to all those who figured out that Tony being out of the loop was odd/deliberate/both. And yeah, I figured that, on paper, the 'let's trap the bad guy by dangling some bait!' plan would look good, but you stick a kid in there, and all of a sudden it sounds less appealing. That said, Tony and Clint are the only two Avengers who are looking at Steve and seeing him as a child separate from the adult, rather than just a pint-sized version of Steve to be restored to adulthood immediately. Hands up who thinks this will cause problems further down the road? (Yup.)
“You will be staying here,” their guide - a tall woman who had introduced herself as Dhakiya - said, opening the doors to the room. “There are two bedrooms and a study to the right, and the kitchen and bathroom are through to the left.” She waited patiently while the porters carried through Tony’s meagre belongings (mostly his undersuit, and the few bits and pieces that Rhodey had brought him) and the small case that contained Steve’s change of clothes (his kid-sized clothes; his adult uniform had been spirited away by the time Tony had thought to ask). The Iron Man suit followed them, standing a discreet distance away.
“You have armed yourself,” she said quietly. “You have the suit, you have the guards. And yet you arm yourself with some hot water. You are afraid of me.” Her lip trembled. “I did not think that I would ever be that person. But I am.” She looked away. Her eyes were glassy and wet. “All I wanted was to somehow make the pain of my loss go away. And instead… There are children whose nightmare tonight will be a red witch coming to kill them in their beds. The - the
“Everything’s fine, Stark.” Wilson smiled tiredly. “I’ll get Jim to call you once he’s rested up a bit. You guys doing OK over there?”
In the silence that followed, Rhodey seemed to want to look anywhere other than at Tony, his gaze finally settling on the child-sized bed and its sole occupant. “The Red Knight, huh?”
(“He’s doing well,” the doctor had said, adjusting Steve’s IV catheter. “He’s responding to the medication, and all the sleep he’s enjoying is helping his recovery. You have nothing to worry about.”
She inclined her head to one side and met his gaze finally. Her eyes were very green and very clear. Her lips had drawn back, showing the sharp points of her eye-teeth; a challenge, he recognised dimly. “If you do not think there is a reason to,” she said quietly, “then let me wake up Steve right now. I can start to work with him; I am sure that I can bring out what he remembers-”
“I’ve known you since you were a snotty teen who could barely reach my shoulders. I know better. Once you’ve decided something is your responsibility, trying to talk you out of it is a fool’s errand.” Rhodey tipped his head to one side. “But I figure - that’s why you called me, right? You need someone to have your back. And I do, Tones. You know that, right? I’ll always have your back.”
There was something strange in the king’s gaze at that, almost triumphant. “Then I suppose we’d best reconvene.” He turned to the guard at his back. “Ayo, please set up a call with my sister. We have much to discuss.” His nose wrinkled. “And… invite M’Baku to join us.”
“Seven dead, all children, none of them known,” Romanoff noted. “The local law enforcement had a problem, because seven adults were also listed as missing. With a population of under six hundred, not many of them were on any sort of DNA database. One week later, the second event occurred.” Maloshuyka, Russia, flashed. “It’s slightly bigger, but still only a few thousand inhabitants, primarily employed by the railroad. Another seven dead, presumed victims of child trafficking. The missing men have a warrant out for their arrest.” The third location flashed. “Pudozh, eight days later, is when the connections started being made. It’s in the Republic of Karelia, which means that the Finns and Russians were both informed of the killings, and connected the dots. After that,” a case file flashed on screen, taking up the right-hand side, “Interpol opened up a file.”
He stared down at it. It looked so innocuous in its inert state. You wouldn’t think to look at it that it could hold something like that.
“Yeah. And our mutual friend’s a great believer in efficiencies, so you’ll forgive me if that’s not enough for trust.” Fury could get blood out of a stone if he had a mind to it,
Minoru stepped forward and wrapped her arm around his shoulders, pushing up on her tiptoes so she could reach him with the suit still on. “It will hear you, when you speak,” she murmured in his ear. “When you need me, call.” She stepped back. “Be safe, Mr Stark. You, and your… child.” She looked across at Mordo. “My dear. Let us remain friends, at least for a while longer.” She extended one hand, and waited until Mordo bowed over it formally, looking as if he had swallowed a lemon.
“I’m just sayin’, the arms are impressive. How much do you bench, d’you think? More than Barnes? I’m betting it’s more than Barnes.” Tony whistled to Barnes as he walked into the conference room. “Hey, Elsa, d’you think you can out-bench his lordship?” In Tony’s defence, he hadn’t slept since… well, it’d been a while.
Tony stood frozen, staring at the box. Then, "no," he said decisively, moving past her and a supremely unsurprised-looking Rhodey, Steve held firmly in his arms. "I'm in charge of him. I'll do it."
“No,” Barnes said, and Tony’s mouth closed with a sharp ‘click’. “He didn’t mention it to me. I went into cryo very soon after everyone arrived here. But - even before that, before he went to the Raft, I could see he was thinking about something. I knew that he was… he needed to leave, there was something he needed to do.” He glanced at Tony, something wry about his mouth. “Actually, I thought he was gonna go find you. Talk it out, you know. All that jazz.”
“Yeah, well, Captain Spangles always knows how to make everything about himself, right? And they call
He wished there was someone more competent - or less sleep-deprived - to do this. “I promise, OK, Steve? I promise to look after you. If someone steals you away, I’m going to come after you. You’re not on your own.”
“Ah. Yes. I am afraid that those best placed to do so…” Mordo tilted his head, pursing his lips. “Well, we did not part on the best of terms. We disagreed on some fundamentals.”
Well, clearly Rogers had been a bad judge of character since infancy, Tony decided. Although given that the only other person he’d properly met so far had been Barton, maybe it was just that Tony was less shit by comparison; who knew. He settled on a sharp nod. “Yeah, Steve. I can look after you.” He hoped. Actually, he was rather counting on getting some help on that front, because he wasn’t entirely sure what he was supposed to do with a kid while he worked. The court official who’d accompanied the doctor had explained that he was now in charge of the kid, and that he wasn’t allowed to do anything major without the court’s consent. And he absolutely wasn’t allowed to remove the child from Wakanda without prior permission. (Well, that was a bridge they could burn if it they ever came to it.) That the child in question wasn’t Wakandan seemed to be neither here nor there; as far as the court official was concerned, Steve was staying put until the court said otherwise, or until they figured out how to unshrink him. (That last bit was Tony’s extrapolation, and he hoped to God that T’Challa would be able to make the wardship go away once Rogers was back, because otherwise… well, it didn’t bear thinking about.)
Peggy would have known what to do. She would have known what to say to fix this, to keep them both safe.
She shrugged and went straight to the large screen where the stand-off was displayed, Lang and Barnes at her side.
They’d have to test it out, somehow, but Tony already knew what they’d find. It was the only theory that fit all the facts. Steve wasn’t just a victim of the portal-creator. He was a direct link back to her.
Barnes, for his part, seemed more concerned with checking on Tony, for some strange reason. “Stark. Are you injured?” He asked, almost brusque, his gaze flickering over the exposed parts of Tony. He did not reach out or touch Tony, but he was standing too close. “Is Steve?”
Tony looked back at where the others were waiting. Romanoff had turned away to give him the illusion of privacy, Lang was looking at his watch, and Barnes… Barnes was just
“He is not physically injured,” Vis murmured, his voice guarded. “There has been another attack, we are not sure where, precisely. The portal connection seemed to affect the child this time more than previously, we are not sure why. He is unharmed, but…” A small, strange hesitation. “If you are back soon, that would be… beneficial for him.”
“Oh, good. As long as you’re using incremental measures for your KPI, and nothing binary like, say, death.”
“OK, I guess we can do this the hard way,” Tony said, and reached for the guy instead. He didn’t have a whole lot of options fighting in close quarters (and he wasn’t going to use the unibeam unless absolutely necessary, as there was a good chance it would take out half the palace) but even if he couldn’t use the repulsors, that didn’t mean that he didn’t have offensive weapons available to him. The suit’s structural integrity was strong enough to let him crush the guy’s head like an eggshell.
with you,” Barton said peevishly, not turning around from the pilot’s seat. “It’ll be another six hours at least. Go read a book or something.”
You'll be pleased to know that my vague idea of what the bad guys are up to is now a much more fleshed-out idea of dastardly deeds and evil shenanigans. Although still ridiculous. (And yet semi-canonical, all the same. Marvel, ilu.)
Tony turned, managing to paste a smile on his face just in time. “Hey, honey bear! What brings you down here?”
Instead of answering, Rhodey eased himself back down again, letting his upper body weight stretch him out.
I really like Shuri, I think she's amazing. Having her in danger during BP probably scared T'Challa witless, because he wasn't used to seeing his baby sister in danger. And I think part of the reason why she's sent to the US with Nakia is to give her that controlled entry into the world - she gets to see a bit of the world, with someone immensely capable watching over her. And although she's a genius in every sense of the word, that doesn't mean that working in isolation is good for her, or for anyone, really. So I figured connecting her with Jane Foster might be nice.
half. Boots and black combat trousers, utility belt, knife... unless Hydra had started outfitting its soldiers with Avengers-issue body armour, that outfit was something Tony himself had designed. Well, sort of. Clearly, Rogers had visited a tailor in Birnin Zana before running off on his jaunt.
The hand clamped back down over his, warm and familiar. On his other side, there was a sharp pinch, and something cold pushed its way into his arm. His chest was jostled as cold, wet things were attached to him, and there was a strange hum starting up around him. It sounded a bit like his repulsors powering up. That was what had to be so comforting, he thought. It had to be that sound, and not the hand clamped around his.
“Nope.” Wilson stepped away, his face suddenly bland. He reached down and pressed his hand against Rhodey’s shoulder. “I’ll see you back at reception when you’re done, okay?” He left before Rhodey could answer.
The king's knowing eyes tracked the movement. He seemed troubled by it, hesitating a little. “Some have returned to look after their families, and others to pursue a different approach. At any rate, I cannot reach them at this moment. Oh - there are ways to contact them, of course, dead drops and suchlike, but they will take time. And I am not certain that the Captain has that time to spare.” T’Challa paused, seeming to weigh his words carefully. “Dr Stark,” he said finally, “I have tried alternate methods of contacting Captain Rogers. But he missed his check-in point. He is not answering his communicator. And Ms Maximoff - she cannot find him.”
His brow furrowed, he dropped off to sleep to the sharp pinch of the IV catheter sliding in to the back of his hand.
Barton was right about something else, too - Tony opened up the HUD the moment Barnes and Maximoff left, Steve sat next to him at the little table, his red crayon clutched tightly in his grip.
He was half-way through re-assembling the boot, the filaments repaired or replaced with the fast-dwindling emergency supplies in the thigh compartments by the time that Steve crept out of the bedroom, fully dressed and in his Iron Man sneakers, up on his tiptoes in exaggerated stealth. He looked up and smiled. “Hey, kid.” He reached out to ruffle Steve’s hair. It was easier to keep the adult Steve and the child Steve separate in his mind when he had the kid version in front of him. He was so different in so many ways from the adult that his personhood, for lack of a better term, was more easily apparent.
“The princess has the restraints ready,” Barnes said. He had his body armour on, and his gun with him. Correction; he had
Rhodey rolled his eyes. “My dick is fantastic, thank you. It’ll take time for things to settle down after the surgery, obviously, but there is every indication that it was successful and with a bit of work, I’ll have full function back in that area.”
Mordo inclined his head. “I do. I suppose… well, I had intended to do this on my own, but I suppose it does not make much difference.” He looked across at Tony, his expression calculating. “I could take you - and the child - to the Hong Kong sanctum. The Master would be able to help us.”
The guide raised an eyebrow at him. “You may not purchase it,” she said severely, as if he had insulted her parents and spit in her food. “It is a
He hesitated, then went to check on the suit quickly. It had locked in to the facility coordinates, and FRIDAY would make sure to get it back safely despite all the various knocks it had taken. Still, it didn’t hurt to check. (Knowing his luck, the repulsors would cut out when the suit was over a hotel or tourist group.) “FRIDAY, keep an eye on it, would you please, I don’t want a front page with
,” he wailed, and that seemed to be what threw open the floodgates. He sobbed as if his world had ended, his arms wrapped around his thin chest in a vain effort to - what? Stop? Or - and Tony’s heart sank - or to comfort himself, because he'd already figured out that the strange man he was with wasn't going to be any help on that front.
Tony frowned. “I don’t see why they’d even - it’s experimental and untested, no-one’s going to hand out a derogation off the back of that.” He’d decided to hold off on the classification of BARF until he’d had a chance to think through the implications of it. If he filed it as a medical device he could probably get the FDA to swing approval - and he’d get a lot more in the way of R&D tax credits - but the obvious avenues for abuse made that tricky. He wasn’t about to nail his colours to the mast until he was 100% certain about what he was putting his reputation behind, and certainly not while he was sleeping four hours a night and compulsively checking that the stupid flip-phone was charged. (One minor miracle coming out of Steve being kiddified was that the phone had pretty much been left to languish in the suit’s secure compartment. No need to reassure himself that Steve wasn’t in danger when he had him sprawled out in deep sleep next to him in the car. Well, ‘him’ for a given definition of ‘Steve’, of course, but Tony wasn’t going to argue with the fever dream that had become his life at this particular point.)
“Or, I back you up, and Barton stays at home to mind the baby instead,” Tony cut in, scowling. He looked at Barton, quiet at his side. “You’ve been silent all through this. You change your mind about us holding hands and running off into the sunset to make daisy chains?”
Rhodey couldn’t meet his eyes. “Yeah. There was a, uh,” he coughed, “proof positive, so to speak. Obviously I’m not supposed to do anything for a bit, but, uh...”
he could grab him, of course. The guy seemed to be everywhere at once, never quite where Tony expected him to be. He was still wielding the glowy circle of light, which seemed to be equal parts shield and some sort of blade, as well as -
“A couple of testimonials wouldn’t go amiss,” Barton drawled from his seat beside Romanoff. His fingers were drumming on the table. “Maybe a video recommendation or two.”
“We have no wish to kill you.” T’Challa leaned forward, his most conciliatory face on. “You are the one who attacked us. Who are you? Why are you trying to hurt the child?”
The swordsman did not take it well. He took one look at the red tendrils twisting from Maximoff’s wrists and his expression contorting with rage. The glowing shield crackled and spat energy as he struggled. “Another one!” He shouted, bracing a knee against Barnes’s abdomen and shoving him backwards bodily.
Dhakiya laughed, dimpling at him in genuine amusement. “You are charming, Dr Stark, I will admit. But not my type.” She shrugged one bare shoulder. “Besides. I think you have other… priorities right now.”
Well, he wasn’t wrong on that score. Tony just hoped to god that it wasn’t Loki. The last thing they needed was a crazy Asgardian in the mix.
“Then it is lucky that it is not for sale,” Mordo said, just as sharply. “Hundreds of my compatriots lost their lives in fighting Dormammu and his followers, and all because our
“Oh, yeah, thanks,” Tony said absently. “The others? Did you guys find anything?” He was forgetting something. Wasn’t he? It had come, and then it had gone again.
Maximoff seemed similarly spooked. “No - I am imposing, I should -” She scrambled to her feet and backed away. “Um - let me know when - if - you want me to try to undo the magic - I mean - just - let me know -”
part of him telling him that probably the ship of ‘mutual trust and respect’ had sailed several weeks previously - and then sighed and hoisted the kid up in his arms. Barton would shoot him, or not - and it looked like it would be
Barton paused by the door and shook his head slowly. “No. Looks like Dr Foster’s theory might be right.” His lips quirked in a tired smile. “Get some rest, Tony. I’ll be back in a few hours.”
Not for himself. Not for the sake of a friendship he’d never been entirely sure had been there. And not for her, either; not for her sake, or her peace of mind. But for Steve? For Steve asleep, dressed in Tony’s AC/DC T-shirt, wrapped in a linen burrito, his clothes carefully folded and his little sneakers within reach, the nightlight on until Tony could get home…
He couldn’t remember the criteria for mandatory discharge in the Accords. Had mental health conditions been one of them? If that was the case, it’s possible that Tony himself would have faced problems, knowing his history. He couldn’t remember any explicit reference to it - he would have noticed if there had been, surely? - but maybe it was buried in some of the pseudo-military code sections. Not something that would have rung alarm bells for him, but something that would have tipped off Wilson.
“The Oakland centre will provide additional security to ensure Dr Stark’s safety,” Okoye said, serene as a monk. “
“Barnes is thawed, Legolas. I’m sure he can keep an eye on the kidsicle until Maximoff or whoever figures out how to de-shrink him.” He waved a hand. “I told Steve I’d bring Barnes back with me after the meeting; I’ll hand the kid over then.” Steve had been anxious again when Tony had headed out with Romanoff, but Tony had settled him down pretty quickly, promising to only be a couple of hours.
He kept his voice deliberately light. “About anything in particular, or just to make my life more interesting?”
“Well,” he said faintly, staring in horror at the pile of bodies. “That’s a special level of fucked up.”
He’d been in danger, and they’d come together to do their thing. (Okay, it was him and Steve, but he wasn’t going to be picky here.) A small, cold place inside him abruptly warmed at the thought. Surely it had to count for something?
For a moment, Rhodey and Tony stared at each other over the kid’s head. Then, “wow, he sure is the spitting image of his older self, huh? I’m gonna leave this one in your capable hands, Tones; don’t worry, I’ll check in with Pep for you -”
- has one extra limb on mine. So, yeah. I'll build your beloved murderbot a new arm. Even better than the original. But before I do? Before I lift a goddamn finger?” He lets go of the worktop and forces himself to walk around it, to crowd into Rogers’s personal space. In just his sneakers, he has to look up to make eye contact and he will not back down, he will
Well, it didn’t matter what he’d thought. His sleep seemed to be either deep and soothing, or hellish and full of nightmares, no in-between. It was a toss-up what he’d get on any given night. And - he looked down at the child still asleep on his chest - maybe the nightmares did make a certain amount of sense. It wasn’t as though he could busy himself in work and put the whole fucking mess to the back of his mind. No, his whole day was now Steve-focused. Well, child-focused, anyway; his brain still found it most comforting to treat the child as a separate person from the adult.
he’d said when offered the chance to run about. And he’d held on to Tony as if afraid that he, too, would disappear.
Of course it was. Chances were, this guy was one of the people responsible for the pile of dead bodies piled up high from Lapland southwards.
to her. There wasn’t a silver bullet to fixing what had gone wrong between them, and he wasn’t sure either of them would take it, even if there had been.
“Barton, wait!” Tony stood up again, Steve still trembling in his arms. As both Barton and Barnes turned to look at him, he faltered and swallowed.
He didn’t even know what to call it. Re-prioritising? Conflicted? Needing a bit of space so his head stopped feeling like it was going to explode?
. “What?” He asked weakly. His voice sounded strange to his own ears, far away, as if it was being piped in from another room.
“Well,” Tony said weakly, staring, “in my defence -” - he was probably hallucinating, because surely no one was that big without some serum enhancement. The guy was - in a word -
. He’d thought that he could simply say his goodbyes and be on his way; he hadn’t counted on Maximoff’s earnest attempt to be conciliatory and meet him halfway. Maybe this all had something to do with Natasha, who was sat on Wanda’s left side, not having said a word since he’d announced his intentions to leave in - he checked his watch discreetly - fifteen minutes from now. He sighed.
“Well, this is very nice and not at all terrifying,” Tony said in the sudden silence, looking around with frank curiosity. “Training for something, are we?”
Tony still found that vaguely disturbing. To start with - when Steve had been ill - he’d chalked it up to any sick child’s natural reticence to walking. But now, with Steve back on his feet and no such convenient excuse, he was starting to wonder. Surely he hadn’t done this with his mother? For all that he was a thin, sickly child, he was still as heavy and cumbersome as a sack of potatoes. There was no way anyone as thin as Sarah Rogers had been - judging by the one photograph a much younger Tony had seen in his history books - had been able to carry a child this large around. “You’re affectionate this morning,” he said after a beat. He looked down at the tow-headed child in his lap.
“I’m just sayin’. You want me to leave you here for a bit?” His eyes darted to the door before he could help himself.
at where Natasha had been drilling a hole in his head with her level gaze for the last five minutes. On his other side, Okoye shifted minutely. “So, if that’s everything -”
“He zipped up his lips!”” Steve explained a little breathlessly in Tony’s ear, evidently having been born with the ‘honourable defence’ instinct. “He’s not speaking, he zipped them up!”
He couldn’t say anything to that. There was a lump in his throat, as if his heart had jumped up to lodge there.
That did sound tempting. For all that Tony had slept away the last few days, he was exhausted. And with Steve already asleep… but - “have there been any further attacks? By Lady Vengeance or by our sword-wielding friend?”
“You’re not Bucky!” Steve shrieked again, twisting on the bed and desperately trying to get away. Despite his accusations that Tony had lied, he was clawing at the IV catheter and the restraining bedclothes, doing his best to get across the bed and back into Tony’s arms.
He grimaced. “I don’t know why I’m surprised. That woman seems to have kept in contact with everyone except me.”
The hands were abruptly pulled away, and something hard and unyielding snapped into place instead, pinning him down. He strained against it, panicked, his breath coming is short, sharp gasps.
T’Challa smiled at that. “Yes. That is a good word for them.” He nodded at the tablet. “But you had a question?”
Romanoff shook her head. “The route they’re taking, and the impact on the victims, implies that someone is using them to power something, or to open something, in preparation for a larger event. But we are unclear as to what. And - it goes without saying - that we need to get ahead of the attacker. The attacks are escalating.”
Wilson rubbed at his eyes and fought the yawn. “He’s in post-op, they’re still doing their assessments. But they’re optimistic the surgery was successful.” He looked away for a moment, as if steeling himself. “How’s Steve?”
It wasn’t even that Steve was - technically - sleeping a few feet away. Or that Tony wasn’t entirely sure he wanted to hear what Rogers thought worth recording, half a world and a broken promise away. It was simpler than that: he didn’t want to have to find out this way. He didn’t want Romanoff to choose for him, to have the decision be taken out of Rogers’s hands. Romanoff had combed through the recordings for useful data already (and, depending on the length, possibly she’d had help from the others) so it wasn’t as though there was anything in there that wouldn’t have been pulled out and indexed in the data packets that sat neatly piled to one side.
And they’d have to make some contingency plans, in case things were not resolved as swiftly as Tony hoped. Sure, he’d promised to Barton he’d look after Steve -
Left alone with the exhausted, sleeping Steve passed out in his arms, Tony stared down at the small face cushioned against his chest.
He grimaced. “You did a good job with those laces,” he said to the bowed head. “Guess your mom taught you how to do that, huh?”
- frightened out of his mind. So be gentle with him, OK?” His hand landed on Tony’s shoulder as he turned away.
He thought about it and decided that he didn’t quite have the bandwidth to deal with it at the moment. If Barton wanted to talk, he’d have to bring it up himself. And besides...
Tony chewed his bottom lip, hesitating. He could tell Wilson, or he could finish the call, but he couldn’t just… “So… hypothetically, if I was to listen to those recordings Nat gave me…”
RE: Black Panther - I already have a vague outline of what I need to happen in this fic, but the part-by-part summaries are not pinned down, yet. So some elements from BP I will doubtless weave in if it's possible to do so, but some parts will likely not work and I'll have to ignore them. (Yes, I'm going to see Black Panther tomorrow. So excited!)
Clint... Clint is really not doing too well with seeing what was in that storage room, let's be honest. And he's
he told the thing-that-wasn’t-him, trying to push it out. It was like slamming himself into a brick wall, if the brick wall kept trying to catch him and cushion him and stop him from flailing, wrapping itself around him what seemed to be an attempt at comfort.
She shook her head. “I didn’t lie, Tony. I want the team to be together. Everything else… we’ll work it out.”
Maybe. Tony hoped not. He hoped that whoever it was running the New York holy place - hell, whoever it was they were going out to meet in Hong Kong - was a little more considerate of the minor trappings of humanity.
Rhodey reached out and grabbed hold of his wrist, squeezing reassuringly. “Steve’s just down the hall,” he said quietly. “They put him in the PICU for the time being. They hope to move him to a normal ward soon, but…” His grip tightened. “How are you doing?”
Warfarin is a blood thinner, used for basically everything Tony has ever had on screen (a replacement or mechanical heart valve, atrial fibrillation, a heart attack, and a variety of other blood clots). I am astonished that he's not on it already. It's dangerous in conjunction with a concussion because it can lead to bleeding in the brain.
“Taking him across international borders as your legal ward,” Pepper finished faintly. She still hadn’t taken her hand away from her mouth. Her eyes were very wide. “I - I don’t know where to start, Tony.”
“Neither will I,” T’Challa said, in the tone of one brooking no disagreements. “We have taken precautions.” He inclined his head towards Mordo’s new best friends.
"Cap?" He called out again, more loudly. "Rogers, are you here?" If it had been Hydra, they would have likely taken Rogers with them. But Hydra wasn't the only military power in these parts; if it had been the Ossetian paramilitaries, they may not have even recognised Rogers without his shield. They may have evacuated and left him behind.
Because he’d known that, whether or not Rhodey would have been able to order him to his death, Tony wouldn’t have had it in him to do the same. (Because he wasn’t a soldier; no, not at all.)
Tony swore, freely and at length, and then kicked Barton as hard as he could on his retreating arse.
“If this sorceress is such a significant threat, we must all go.” He inclined his head. “I would not place the child in danger, Dr Stark.”
He made his way back as quickly as he could and gingerly crawled under the foil blankets, trying to stop his shivers.
Tony stared at the zoomed-in image. It took a minute - maybe longer - but he finally saw what Wanda was doing. Every time the bracelets crackled, she would tense up a little, her own magic flaring, pushing against the swordsman’s power. “Wanda…”
“You have to do this,” she finished sadly. “Tony. You know that’s not true, right? You don’t owe him anything. You can absolutely say no.”
“I gotta say, ‘we’re all shit at everything’ is not really the sterling defence you seem to think it is.” No matter how true it might be.
The kid crawled out from under the metal cautiously, drawing himself up as tall and as brave as he possibly could. He had one of Rogers's smaller knives in his grip, held tremulously with both hands in front of him like a sword. "Who - who are you?"
But the flaw in Tony's reasoning (and what Steve is fixating on) is that he believes he would always be able to trust the morality and ethical integrity of those making those decisions, at least more than he trusts his own. Whereas Mordo is saying that the most learned of the sorcerers would not only agree with him, but that he could have gathered them all up in an army and turned up that way. So, that should have been the end of it, right? The experts, who understand all the stakes, who are willing to make that call, say that Tony has to hand Steve over, and... well, Tony knows himself enough to wonder whether he'd do so, or whether he'd take one look at that unanimous vote and say,
"Later, baby girl. Later." It was going to be a long flight, and he needed to read up on all the ins and outs of the most recent Caucasian conflicts before he committed anyone else to this.
He wished he could be sure of that. But even if Tony thought of the child and the man as two separate people, it didn’t look as though Steve himself agreed with that delineation. After the initial shock of finding himself in this new body, he’d certainly seemed as though he’d understood exactly what had happened to him, and how he had been altered. Or perhaps Tony was being uncharitable here, leaning towards the natural contrariness that the two of them seemed to occupy whenever they were in the same space. Maybe Steve had not thought through the implications.
Hadn’t Tony made his own promises? Hadn’t he promised Steve, again and again, that he’d do everything he could? That he’d look after him, that he’d keep him safe?
Rhodey had confessed to him, sleep-slurred, back when he’d still been in hospital. They’d given him the run-down, and they’d still been holding out hope that a lot of things would go away as the spinal shock faded. But
He also needed to get a line open to FRIDAY. Not that the pebble wasn’t a marvel (he really should get Shuri’s permission to take it apart once this was all over, that, or bribe her with whatever teenaged girls with genius-level intellects wanted - tickets to a Beyoncé concert, her favourite YouTuber’s phone number, access to the recovered Chitauri weaponry components - to go over the schematics with her) but Tony… well. He always felt more secure when he built something himself.
What, that was supposed to be news? Steve’s self-flagellation was supposed to be something new and shocking to him?
There was an odd look on Vision’s face as he pulled away. “Of course,” he agreed. “I will take good care of him. Please do not worry.”
A few minutes later, Barnes wandered back in. He’d changed into a black suit and white shirt, with plain black gloves and dark glasses on a nondescript face. There was a wire in his ear, and his hair was gelled back neatly.
Barton looked up and smiled at her humourlessly. “I’m at your disposal, ma’am. Don’t worry, he so much as sneezes and I’ll get him to a doctor if I have to carry him bridal-style.”
He’d figure it out. Malibu probably wouldn’t work if they needed to get to Oakland regularly, but they could stay in San Francisco. He’d been a resident of California before; he could do it again. And money could hide any multitude of sins; if T’Challa came through on his promise, between the two of them, they’d have an identity drawn up for Steve that even Ross wouldn’t be able to break through.
It has been such a long time since the last update! Many thanks to all those still sticking with this fic. I had to take a break from writing for RL reasons, but I'm back into the swing of it now, and updates should follow in a more regular fashion. I'd like to finish this fic before Endgame comes out, if at all possible.
The journey itself was blessedly uneventful, albeit excruciatingly long-winded. Even with the quinjet it took the better part of 18 hours. Barton and Barnes took turns piloting - Tony pitched in with a 3 hour stint when even Barnes was starting to look a little rough around the edges - and Steve dropped off somewhere over West Africa and stayed that way for pretty much the rest of the flight.
“Shhh,” a woman’s voice said (who was it?) and a small hand fell on his brow. The darkness receded by inches, red light swamping his vision. “It’s OK. You’re safe. Sleep now. Sleep.”
The gray on the edge of Tony’s vision recedes by inches as he stares down at the worktop. Tony swipes away the screensaver and in its place materialize a pair of rotating schematics, facing each other like combatants. His notes scroll down the side, prodding into the relevant sections with thin implements. They look like puppets, held up by textual string.
Tony felt the beginnings of a migraine prickling closer. This was not what he'd been expecting. Help with Barnes, maybe. A discussion about the Accords, possibly. Even - even! - a request for assistance in getting Barton in contact with his family. (He didn't know where they were, he
More silence. Helplessly, Tony looked up at Romanoff and Vision, standing in the bedroom hallway. “He - he needs a bedtime story,” he said, stumbling over his words in his haste to get them out. “And he - he needs -” He couldn’t think. The armour was assembled, the team was waiting for him by the jet, he just needed to -
Tony hesitated. It had seemed simple enough to explain this when he’d been thinking it over, but somehow the words had deserted him in the face of Steve’s earnest confusion. “Steve, listen. I know we’ve been moving around a lot, and I know it’s been confusing. But I need us to take one more trip, OK, buddy? I’m going to move us back to the US.”
He thought back to the feeling of Steve’s hand in his. To the soft catch of Steve’s breath as Tony walked away.
James Farley is referred to as a kingmaker for his role in orchestrating the gubernatorial and presidential elections of FDR.
Barton looked back at him, bruised and exhausted, something infinitely weary in his eyes. “Yeah. Guess so.” He braced his hands on his knees and forced himself to his feet. “I’ll leave you to get some rest. I’ll let Rhodes know you're out of the woods, and I'll check on you in a bit. You’re officially out of post-op with flying colours, so the medical team will be by in a little while to do their assessment. You should probably sleep a little in the meantime.”
Tony wondered briefly why all the medical technology wasn’t freaking him out. Well, either he just wasn’t as susceptible to panic attacks over modern technology as had first been assumed, or the medical tech had freaked him out enough when he’d been even younger and he’d become inured to it. He reached out and touched the mask around Steve’s neck. “That they do, kiddo. You OK with this thing? Know how to use it?”
The king nodded sharply. “Yes, we must intervene. Even if there is no larger goal, these attacks are unconscionable. And Interpol would be ill-equipped to handle a magic user.”
, as he’d tried and failed to explain how everything had gone wrong so spectacularly. How he hadn’t been able to keep the team together.
The energy shield punch connected with the HUD straight-on more or less the moment he arrived, the helmet giving way under the sheer force exerted. Tony landed heavily and did not get up again.
Thinking of the two Steves as separate people was also neater and easier than having to think about what this all meant. After all, if there were two Steves, then he was perfectly within his rights to prioritise the rights and welfare of the child.
It took Tony a moment to mentally re-set to the Steve asleep like a sprawled koala in the next room, rather than to the one on the recordings and in his dreams.
“Spit it out, Barton,” Tony said tiredly. “I’m really not in the mood to play the brain damaged idiot any longer.”
If looks could kill, Tony would likely be a smouldering pile right about now. “You know,” Wilson said, his voice tight, “you are so exactly like him. I don’t think I realised just how much before now.”
“No, that’s OK,” Steve said quickly and hugged his arms across his chest, then seemed to think better of it, deflating. “Oh, I meant… I mean, I can wear the big shirt again, I’ll give it back, sorry.” He reached for the hem of the T-shirt immediately.
As the therapist opened up his bag of torture devices and foam pads, Tony stared up at the ceiling. “There is literally no one in the world I don’t hate right now.” Almost as soon as the words left his mouth he wanted to call them back. If there’d only been adults in the room, the vociferous hate he had for all forms of physiotherapy would probably have been fine (and dear God, he was going to get Rhodey a punching bag that could clip on to the chair, or a stress ball, or
“No.” He hoped. “But, I can take you to him.” He thought. He’d have to either go outside - leaving the kid sans suit-heater again - and set up a link there, or get the communications working from the inside. The base still had a power supply, albeit in the form of generators, and the exit hadn’t been orderly. He could probably get that sorted out just as easily from inside the control room. And he’d be able to contact FRIDAY at the same time. It’d be a little more time consuming, but he didn’t want to take the kid out of the suit any earlier than he had to. “Tell you what. You stay inside the suit and warm up, and I’ll have a look at getting com- uh, a phone line up and running.” He’d be able to get at the data back-ups at the same time, see if there was anything useful in there.
That all being said, although Tony had kept up with his emails - barely - when out in Wakanda, handling the Chair of the FAC was not something that could be done remotely. Especially not when he was overstepping his bounds and meddling in things that were very clearly not his bailiwick. “Smith needs to back off out of Pepper’s - and my - remit. It’s not any of his business how we implement operational decisions.” He’d need to have a short, sharp conversation with him about that.
“Oh, hey now. Hey, there's no need to cry,” he tried desperately, scooting across to awkwardly pat Steve on the back and nearly toppling him over. Christ, the kid was a stick. He could probably pick him up, he certainly looked small enough… Gingerly, ready to drop him if he so much as made a peep of discomfort, Tony reached into the suit and gathered Steve up in his arms. “There, now,” he tried again, passing a hand over Steve’s back. He could feel the press of ribs against his fingers, and he shivered. Too thin, too fucking thin… “I’m sorry I yelled. I didn’t mean it. It's going to be okay.”
This was technology beyond anything he’d seen, barring one specific nightmare example, years ago, when the skies had been torn open.
“It’s a Terminator portal,” Barton explained, wide-eyed and earnest. “My bet is that SkyNet is behind it all.” He’d grown more and more skittish as the slide show had flicked through from the wide shots through to the extreme close-ups on the cuts and the arrangement of the limbs. The last shot - a bloody handprint on the wall, as if someone had braced themselves against it, readying to walk through the empty space - lingered long after Tony closed his eyes. Barton had been making inappropriate jokes with increasing frequency throughout, and although once upon a time Tony would have been right there with him, that ship had sailed a long time ago.
The attacker was dressed in what looked like a knock-off of a Buddhist monk’s outfit, albeit in somber colours and with some rather swashbuckling boots to complete the look. About Tony’s height, medium build, he had a close-cropped afro and a faint scar on his forehead. If he hadn’t been dressed up as some sort of weird cross between Robin Hood and the Dalai Lama, Tony wasn’t sure he would have been able to pick him out of a crowd.
“Absolutely,” Tony said, his throat dry. He couldn’t look away from where Barnes stood, healthy and whole -
Of course, the Palo Alto campus also included the West Coast R&D labs, which was another draw. It was a solidly equipped and fully-shielded facility; that would be helpful, especially if there was something external triggering Steve’s connection to the portals. For all that Tony wanted to connect with Shuri and Jane Foster on this, that didn’t mean that he was going to just sit around and wait for them to come up with a solution for him. Steve was his responsibility; if the connection to the older Steve was a threat to him, it was on him to figure out how to fix that. (Especially as the focus of the Oakland group was likely to still be on turning Steve back, to the exclusion of everything else.)
“Ask me again in a bit.” The prelim work he’d seen back in Birnin Zana wasn’t a patch on this. Tony frowned, skipping back to the earlier notes to compare. The radiation in Steve was stronger than the other kids, coming in well over the safe dosage, but it didn’t seem to have injured him any. Did it have something to do with the de-aging? Or was it all a side-effect of something else? And -
hate him. The minty drink was a million times more effective at getting rid of the foul taste than anything he’d found stateside. “What’s in this stuff?” He surrendered the basin and the peered at the remnants in the bottle. There appeared to be green things floating in there.
Tony thought about being difficult, but - much as he liked winding up SHIELD in general and Hill in particular -  it really wasn’t a smart move to put his people’s backs up. Hill might be Fury’s woman for the most part, but she was still - at least a little bit - one of Tony’s. He rubbed at the bridge of his nose and grimaced. “I missed the Board meeting, huh?”
However much Romanoff may have overstepped her bounds, though, it had been Tony himself who had decided to listen to the recordings. And for all that Wilson’s surprise at Tony’s restraint had stung, it had mostly hurt because it hadn’t been enough, had it? He’d still given in to temptation.
“Sorry,” Wilson said, looking unrepentant. He nodded at the sleeping Steve. “So I hear you’re gonna be babysitting for a while.”
This chapter just wouldn't come. :/ I'd originally planned to start on the whole Tony & Wanda relationship a bit later on, but quickly came to realise that in Tony's current state, he wouldn't let her anywhere near Steve. So we'd have to go through some of those issues before anything could move on. (Of course, saying it and having it be resolved are two very different things; it's good that they've opened lines of dialogue, but there's very little trust there.) I know that a lot of people don't like Wanda, and believe that as she is an adult, she should be treated as such. I do agree to some extent, but I'm very conscious of how erratic my own reasoning was in my late teens/early twenties, and that was
“Well, that is one table that will never pose a threat to us again,” Romanoff said dryly, closing the door behind her.
Tony had resigned himself to staying put, and had notified Pepper that he’d be a few days. (OK, he’d told FRIDAY, who’d told Pepper. But sue him; he’d had enough on his plate without wanting to add being yelled at by his CEO to the list.)
There was an awkward pause while Barnes seemingly tried to make himself invisible through sheer force of will. Tony didn’t look away.
Tony hummed under his breath. “That would be a lot more convincing if you didn’t have Barnes and Maximoff standing guard. And you haven’t explained
“Latched on?” Happy supplied helpfully. “They do that. By the way, he’s been texting every day. I’ve sent a summary to your tablet. He rescued a stray cat yesterday. And aced his Chemistry test.”
Tony nodded as gently as he could. “I know. I know, kiddo. And I know he’s really sorry you’re hurting.” Which was… probably a safe bet. Steve’s compassion would stretch to his child self, right? “You remember me saying that you used to be bigger, and someone made you a kid again?”
Barton was watching him carefully, his brows drawn together in a frown. “Tony? You OK?” He got the penlight out again, shining it in Tony’s eyes.
Steve hid his face against Tony’s neck as they walked, his eyes peeking out over Tony’s shoulder to peer at the woman.
Barnes glanced back at the two of them; Tony’s torso turned slightly so that his shoulder was between the door and Steve, the child’s face furrowed in concentration. The amusement faded at the tableau, Barnes’s expression smoothing out into something unreadable.
teammates,” Tony snapped, feeling the familiar rush of rage. “Hard to be teammates with someone when -”
“It would be my honour, Steve,” Vision said gravely, still with that same gentle smile. He held out his hand. “Will you come with me?”
(He didn’t want to do that again. He didn’t want to pretend anymore that those he lo- cared about were still in his life.)
(To the sob Tony had heard on that damned recording, like peeling open a private wound to leave it wet and bleeding and exposed.)
Why hadn’t he realised sooner? No wonder Barnes hadn’t shown any special interest in the kid, he was probably eager to get his buddy back, not some snot-nosed kindergartener. And Tony had thought that - despite everything - Steve might be safe with him, that Barnes might put Steve first…
Anger flared through him at the thought. Was that what Romanoff’s play was? Pull out the records of Ste-
“Yeah, well.” He shifted uncomfortably. “Just ‘cause I’m a selfish bastard doesn’t mean everyone in his life should be. Take your own damn advice and just - I don’t know. You know what to do. That’s your job, right? Physician, heal thyself.” He waved his fingers in a vague gesture to illustrate.
Where the hell was everyone? Surely the first thing the guards would have done would have been to sound the alarm. Where was Okoye? Dhakiya? Fucking
Mordo had his hands up almost before Tony was through the portal, Okoye and Master Minoru a split-second behind. “Peace, Stark. I do not wish to fight you.” He had an odd look to him, his shoulders slumped and tension in the line of his body, as if he did not believe his own words - or that he knew them to be futile.
“What is it?” Rogers bites out, his hackles well and truly up. The flush is still there, high up on his cheeks, and for an idle moment Tony wonders if - no.
“Coulda woulda shoulda,” Barton muttered, and elbowed Tony out of the way. “Go back and sit with Steve until we’re ready to disembark. Barnes and I have to go put our faces on.”
More fool him; Tony was perfectly happy to drink his coffee black. “It’s like living with a toddler.”
Tony thought. If Wilson had snuck back into the US, it made sense that he’d head back to the area he knew best. And if he was going back for someone… it would explain why he’d split with Rogers, even with that whole hero-worship thing going on. If he had someone to get home to...
” Surely Mordo wouldn’t have been stupid enough to injure them and then attempt to make peace? But, then, they’d thought him contained, and look how
“I will not harm the child,” he said, the moment Tony walked back in the room, Romanoff at his side.
Many thanks to phnelt for doing the heavy lifting in researching likely Californian locations for me, and in helping me think through the next few sections of the fic. Palo Alto seems to be one of the likely places Stark Industries would have a presence, and sticking to a closed community would be one way to keep Steve's presence a secret... at least, in theory.
She shook her head. “No, I am fine. Just a headache.” She looked up at Mordo with venom in her eyes. “Is this supposed to be your ‘good side’?” It sounded as though she were quoting something.
“What?” Tony asked defensively, adjusting his grip. Steve’s arms automatically wrapped around Tony’s neck as the hold was corrected, settling him against Tony’s hip more comfortably, sneakered feet kicking gleefully. Tony was painfully aware that Rhodey hadn’t been there when he’d arrived with the spy twins and the kid, and that this was possibly the first time he’d seen them interact. “This is easiest.”
Unfortunately. “Yeah. He’s just… he was taking a bit of a nap, so they’re waking him up now to see you. Hopefully not too long.” He patted the kid’s hand. “And then you can stay with him while we figure out how to turn you back, OK?”
“What is it you hope to accomplish?” The swordsman asked, sneering faintly. Tony could see the thin sheen of sweat beading on his brow. “Why this elaborate production? Surely it is easier to simply kill me.”
He slid out of his chair and lay down on the ground instead, his feet flat on the floor, staring up at the ceiling and breathing as slowly and as deeply as he could manage. After about twenty minutes, his pulse had slowed down enough so that it didn’t feel as though his heart would tear itself loose in his chest. He sat up cautiously and dragged himself to the wall, sitting up with his back against it, the pebble on the floor beside him.
The warm feeling lasted for approximately ten seconds before the implications hit him: they’d all gathered, and so they’d all be in Wakanda when he arrived. All of them gathered in one place, and evidently able to do so without splitting into camps, without falling into violence -
Tony smacked him away. “Would you quit it with the laserpoint, Jesus, I’m not a fucking cat; go bother T’Challa if you want to play.” What the hell was it, it was on the tip of his tongue… He pushed the blankets away, blinking at the small blonde head resting against his side.
“Oh!” Shuri said, brightening. “Well, that’s when we irradiated with gamma radiation. You can see that -”
But maybe Barton would be. Maybe it got easier, this feeling, and the vice around Tony’s chest would slowly start to loosen. Surely it would; surely, as Steve grew up - as Steve
“He was a runty kid, that’s for sure,” Wilson said from behind him, and Tony just about jumped a foot in the air.
Satisfied, Tony squatted down on the ground to check on Steve. “You OK, kiddo?” he asked. “The doctor’s just going to do some paperwork, and then we’ll be done with the house arrest, I promise.”
But right now? Right now, it's not really practical to sit, or to reach for a lozenge, or to grab some juice. He can’t even reach for his meds, because he left them in the penthouse. Right now, St-
They stayed in the courtyard for another few minutes, Tony holding Rhodey’s hand and not speaking, giving him space to compose himself. He desperately wanted to ask about the guy in Rhodey’s unit - what his name was, how close he’d been to Rhodey, whether Rhodey wanted to share anything - but it was obvious that he’d be prying. He settled for squeezing Rhodey’s hand tightly. “We’ll talk more a little later on, okay?” He said after a while. “I’m stuck here for a bit, what with the kid and all. And you - or do you need to head back?”
Tony thought. A black haze prickled at the edges of his vision, threatening to swamp him. He had to get the kid to safety. If he couldn’t fight the guy… There was really only one option. (He hoped that Maximoff wouldn’t take it personally.)
Barton was silent for a moment. “She was in danger during the succession, I don’t know if you heard. There was a bit of trouble here - another claim to the throne - and Shuri was in danger. T’Challa, he… He said he wanted her away from Wakanda for a bit, and to introduce her to people in her own league.” He shrugged. “I knew Jane Foster was back out on the West Coast after her stay in Asgard, and I figured…”
He should have said something to Barton about that at the time. Hell, Fury should have, or Steve, or… well,
And, like the idiots they were, they’d all decided that there was no chance of the bad guys coming back to finish the job and cut up one last kid.
Barton’s eyes tracked the movement. His hand half-rose, the fingers twitching, as if he’d almost reached out then thought better of it. “Just sit tight,” he said instead. “We’ll figure it out.”
“Are you kidding me? Rhodey, that’s amazing! What about sensation? Control? D’you think they can -” Forget the braces; if the doctors could do their miracle thing and make Rhodey
Something in his tone of voice seemed to make Rhodey frown in concern. He leaned forward, filling the screen. “Hey, I took you in, didn’t I? That worked out OK.”
Tony reached out and grabbed hold of the little hands, holding them against Steve’s side. “I just meant, we can get you something you’d like,” he said, forcing a little bit of gentleness into his voice. “But you don’t have to give this back, it’s yours as well.” Of course Steve would assume the clothes were a loan, the kid had grown up underfed and sickly, raised by a single mother with limited means. Doctors were only when someone got ‘real sick’. “We can get you anything you’d like.” He let go, then patted Steve’s shoulder cautiously.
“Tones, come on,” Rhodey said, his mouth twisting in a wry smile. “You know it doesn’t work like that. Honestly, I’ll be plenty happy to have a working dick back. I’m relying on you to get me walking again, but trust me, getting me anything else below the belt -” His smile suddenly dropped off. “Crap, I keep forgetting - the kid -”
per se, but less infuriated, maybe. At least he was doing something vaguely useful in keeping the kid calm and safe while the doctors scanned him and checked his spelling and peeing. But he didn’t need a babysitter. Not while everyone else was out there evidently playing hero and chasing down leads he hadn’t been made privy to. (He wasn’t bitter about that. Nope. After all, he’d been concussed and then unconscious, so it was entirely reasonable for everyone else to be off doing whatever it was while he had someone grading him on his ability to walk straight.)
“My name is Ndiliswa,” the nurse said with a scowl. “Next, the therapist will come, and you will go to the bathroom.”
He couldn’t bring the child with him, not if the swordsman was feinting - and they couldn’t risk leaving him undefended, either. Vision would be able to keep him moving and get him to safety in the event that everything went belly-up. Sighing, Tony knelt on the floor and pulled Steve around to face him. Romanoff, Barnes and Lang continued walking, although Vision and the four guards paused with Tony. “Hey, Steve,” he said quietly. “D’you remember what I told you about finding you if you were stolen?”
gonna help? Sorry to press you on this, but I have an unconscious seven year old and a fucking Death Eater who likes to chop up little kids after him, so if you’re not gonna be of any help I need to know now rather than later.” He ran of breath, panting. His vision swam again and he grabbed onto the shoulder of the suit to keep himself upright. “Also, I might throw up on you,” he said upon reflection.
belong to?) then they’d have to manage the flow of information very carefully indeed. There would be nothing preventing Mordo’s Hong Kong buddies from portalling back to Jabariland, with Mordo as their guide, to track down Steve and finish what he’d started. No, Tony had to be certain of them first.
There was a certain nobility, he thought, in Mordo’s face. It was an intelligent, attractive face, with expressive eyes and an honest mien. It was the face of a statesman, or a teacher. It was a face that inspired trust.
From the pilot’s seat floated back, “or whoever is running your New York temple,” in Barton’s dry tones. He, at least, did not seem particularly inclined to launch into a discussion of what Mordo’s motivation - and methods - might mean.
It was fast becoming apparent to Tony that Okoye had managed to pack him and Steve off to the James Farley of Wakanda. If he’d had a little more time, he would have probably tried for a charm offensive. It was always good to form new relationships, after all. And this guy was undoubtedly someone it would be helpful to cultivate, especially if T’Challa’s situation was as precarious as he was starting to suspect.
Steve sniffled as best he could behind the mask, his eyes wide and scared. “I thought it was a dream. I thought I’d wake up and I’d be home. But I’m still here!” His thin fingers gripped Tony’s anxiously. “I want to go
he thought, stretching carefully. His ribs ached abominably. They’d healed from the damage in Siberia - mostly - but the bruising had yet to truly fade, and sleeping twisted up had done him no favours. Hell, carting Steve around like a sack of potatoes had also probably not been his brightest move. Jarvis had always complained that Tony was too heavy to carry around as a small child, and Tony had never - quite - believed him. Being balanced on someone’s hip wouldn’t put that much pressure on it, the weight would be spread out, he’d reasoned with impeccable three-year-old logic. Jarvis was just being
He left the power on, disconnecting the unnecessary systems to preserve the energy. What next? Heat, supplies, shelter. The room was still incredibly cold, and despite Tony’s thermal undersuit and the need to crawl into a computer that rapidly heated up to the temperature of a furnace, he was still cold. But if people had been staying here, they would have had useful supplies, like water, and blankets.
Tony thought, and fought the urge to reach out. (Barton, he was sure, wouldn’t want his weakness to be seen by others.)
She led them through the back, up a rickety flight of stairs, and through a door that was labelled with the universally-understood pictogram of a toilet. (With an ‘out of order’ sign hanging on the door-knob.)
Behind him, Barnes was watching him critically. “You won’t need to evacuate him,” he said. “And if you do, you will need someone to guide you through the tunnels.”
“The wibbley wobbley timey wimey spilled over and caught the Hydra goons and Rogers in the backwash,” Barton translated for the benefit of any idiots in the room, still with that obnoxious, too-bright smile. His eyes were anxious when they flickered between Tony and Barnes.
The child was dead, and it was his fault. He must have looked away, or he must have failed, somehow. He must have done something wrong, because the child was dead, and it was on
Taking the hint, Tony sat down on the bench. “I’m sorry,” he blurted out before he could stop himself. Rhodey’s eyes snapped up to meet his. “I’m sorry if I made it so that you couldn’t tell me things important to you. It’s… I’m sorry.”
“I do, and my point is this: you might not have the money or the equipment, but you have a knack for getting other people to just
Okoye and Barnes set off to meet with T’Challa upon arrival. “He will consider what must be done,” Okoye said. “It is late, and there is nothing to be done right now. We shall talk more in the morning. Rest while you can.”
“Steve had it,” Romanoff said, confirming all of Tony’s suspicions. His breath huffed out of him. “He’d started looking at it around the fourth attack, when Interpol connected the dots and the Russian authorities started worrying they had a serial killer running around, gutting entire kindergarten classes. He might have thought -”
Rhodey met his gaze with an effort for a moment before looking away again. “Sam put me in touch with some guys he knows,” he muttered. “I didn’t want to… there might have been a paper trail if I’d gone down the official route, and…”
It had to be Steve. Why else would Mordo be going through this whole ridiculous charade? Just to track Umar? No, that made no sense. There had to be more to it than that. Steve had figured out the pattern - and there
He pinched the bridge of his nose. “Two kids - Hap, seriously. The first kid isn’t even mine, he just sort of… latched on. And kid number two is
“Believe it,” Romanoff said, moving to stand in front of Tony before he’d even managed to get his mouth open to reply. “We have a problem.”
Possibility two was that the ritual wasn’t designed to kill them, per se, so they’d still been alive when the whatever-it-was - “I’ve decided that we’re going with ‘temporal event’, mostly because I’m the one that found it, so no, Barton, you can’t call it a fucking ‘time door’, this isn’t Doctor Who,” - did its thing and turned them back into kids. Rogers must have been close enough to be affected.
And judging by just how far ahead this someone was - and how elegant some of their ideas were - he was starting to get an inkling of just who might have read in Dr Foster on their little problem. “T’Challa send one of his own to bring her in? You know, if whoever wrote this is willing to travel, I’d be more than willing to work with them in New York. They don’t need to be stuck out in the wilds of New Mexico.”
It would have been a magnificent speech, sharp and cutting and just on the right side of morally extortionate. It would have been sung of in song and, and, other things you sing, OK, the point is, it was a thing of beauty and it was a bit of a shame that his knees had decided that, nope, they weren't cooperating.
“Yeah,” he said, and managed a smile. “That worked out just great.” He cleared his throat. “Listen. Not that I don’t appreciate the vote of confidence, but I need a bit of a favour as well. I don’t know how up to speed you are, but we’ve made a temporary alliance with the sword-wielding maniac from before.”
“You’ll have it.” He nodded towards the bedside table, where the pebble still sat. “I will have it uploaded. And…” he cleared his throat, suddenly sounding awkward. “Have you listened to Steve’s audio entries yet?”
“Your teammates,” T'Challa continued without pause, talking over Tony, “did not stay in Wakanda for longer than a few hours. They came here to safely deliver Ms Maximoff. And then they departed.”
No, there was too much at stake. Even if he focused solely on the welfare of the child, there was still too much unknown, too much being left to chance. And with the adult Steve possibly still somewhere in there - still aware, in flashes if not in perpetuity, of all that had been done to him - how could they afford to wait?
He made a mental note to make sure Steve put on socks before they left, though. The kid had had enough sniffles and upper respiratory infections to last a lifetime.
The interesting thing for me is that I can just as easily read Tony - during IM2 - being against external oversight, and Steve - in TFA - being pro accountability. Their experiences have shifted them away from those positions, but honestly, the interesting thing for me is that they could have come down on it either way, especially as we don't have mutant registration in the MCU. Once you throw in something that is sufficiently muddy, both positions start sliding again.
Steve carefully drew the faceplate on as an exaggerated clown-frown. “You’re angry because the bad guy came and was a bully,” he explained. He paused for a second then added a goatee around the mouth slot, framing the frown with scribbled peach fuzz.
“Do you not think that the primary concern should be our common enemy?” Mordo asked, his tone mild and his expression even.
, if the vaguely approving look he got at this was any indication. He rather thought that Steve would protest, but maybe the kid had realised that walking barefoot was gonna be just as miserable now as it had been before. At any rate, he wrapped his arms around Tony’s neck and didn’t protest the embrace, slumping against Tony’s shoulder immediately.
. With an effort, Tony swung his legs over the side of the bed, struggling with the medical gown - when the hell had he been put in the gown and where the hell was his undersuit? He fucking hated hospitals, and not just because of their tendency to pilfer - oh, there it was, tucked under the bed. Well. Well, okay… “I need to see him.” He managed to get himself upright, leaning heavily on the arm of Rhodey’s wheelchair. “Where -”
Wilson was frowning at him. “So you were respecting Steve’s privacy? What if there’d been mission-critical stuff in there?”
And she was still - now and always - one of Fury’s people. Tony had zero doubts about that. The secretive bastard could be ten years dead and she’d still be dancing to his tune. Well, that went for any number of them, he supposed; Fury’s biggest talent had been in manipulating people into thinking they were doing what they wanted to do. Meanwhile, the end result would still somehow end up with him on top. Even after concerted assassination attempts and having his own damn agency riddled with Hydra agents, the man had somehow ended up unscathed.
Tony did not drink tea. “Uh… sounds great. Come on in.” He cast a nervous glance behind him at the closed door to the sleeping area. Steve had been asleep for since Tony had put him back down again and Tony had been debating about whether to ask for some food to be delivered, or to try to get him up and dressed and fed properly. The little kitchen area had been stocked with the basics - enough for him to sort out breakfast, coffee and snacks, at least - but he’d never been one for cooking and he figured that the other meals would involve the rest of their ragtag little group. (And hadn’t he been left with just the most delightful assortment? Not that those departed had borne him any special love, but at least they hadn’t tried to kill or brainwash him. Well, that he knew of, anyway.) He was abruptly nervous. He’d agreed - in principle - for Maximoff to try to turn the kid back, but that had been… well, it had been more under the understanding that he could just hand him over to Barnes and let him take responsibility for those choices. Now that the situation had changed, Tony wasn’t quite so sure about things. Not that Maximoff would hurt the kid, of course.
over, honeybear. Not by a long shot.” He slid gracelessly into the wheelchair and let Wilson clip his IV bag to the stand and stow his undersuit in the little wire basket underneath.
Barton chewed his lower lip. “He…. he concurs with Tony’s assessment. He wants to know what restraints the Princess has come up with.”
But anyway, if T’Challa was hurt or killed, or if the team didn’t come back, they might have to scramble back-up quickly, and out of the four who’d stayed behind, Tony was the only one who was one, mobile, and two, not likely to be shot at on sight by 117 nations. Which was why Romanoff had spoken with Hill, apparently - “yes, she’s talking to Jane Foster, expect contact in the next few hours -” but she was also assembling some sort of new!SHIELD back-up.
He is seriously considering revoking access to his workshop from, oh, everyone. Not Rhodey, of course. Or Pepper, who has access to pretty much everything. But, yeah, everyone other than Rhodey or Pepper (and he refuses to think why his world has narrowed down to the Avengers, why ‘everyone’ is one amorphous mass including both Vision and Barton who are pretty much on opposite ends of the spectrum for basically
Rhodey smiled. “Well… no promises, but their initial assessment seems to be that there’s definitely some improvements they can eke out. The damage doesn’t get too severe until the sacral spinal cord, so…” Colour flooded his cheeks. “Well, they think - you know. With a couple of procedures, I might be able to get rid of the catheter.”
T’Challa smiled thinly. “Sent them to me? Yes, that much I had gathered. But there were some disagreements between the Captain and the others around the best way to approach things. To approach - reconciliation.”
Not a bad philosophy, given what little Tony knew about the life Steve would have led during the Depression, and how Steve’s mother had died. She’d have made sure he was independent and able to survive without her as soon as possible. Sure, Steve had promptly turned that into a blanket pass to punch above his weight on more than one battlefield, even before the serum, but Tony couldn’t fault Sarah Rogers’s logic and motivation. “Well, your mom sounds like a smart woman. And look, you’ve done that bow perfectly.” He patted the boy’s foot. “I need you to keep doing what your mom said, OK? We’re gonna look out for you, but we need you to do the same.”
It wasn't the same thing when it came to Steve, who was heavier than he looked but was still small enough to fit in Tony's arms and slump into sleep, limbs completely askew in a perfect display of trust. Steve, who had no-one, who was Tony's... something. Who was
Tony blinked at him. Barton swayed, separated out into two and then came back together again. That was strange. Wasn’t that strange? “Um… I - warfarin,” he mumbled.
“I don’t want Sam helping me with physio,” Rhodey said on the exhale. He stretched his fingers as far as he could, every muscle on his back jumping. “He does everything else, and it’s too much. I don’t… I don’t want that.”
Rogers’s complexion goes from healthy farm-boy to bloodless corpse in a matter of moments. “Rhodes.” His back straightens, as if readying himself for an execution.
Tony glanced across at him, taking in the way the child hunched his shoulders, as if trying to make himself even smaller. Even less of a threat.
That was the problem. He didn’t. They had too little information, and he’d been out of the loop so much that it was difficult to make informed inferences. And the others… Romanoff might well put all the pieces together, he couldn’t dispute that. (But would she tell him?)
Romanoff had been silent the entire time. She had barely made eye-contact with Tony since arrival, choosing to sit by Barnes at the back, frowning at the data. Tony would bet hard money that the whole lot of them had done their best to assimilate the data but it had been ultimately impenetrable, and they’d gone with a standard bag-and-tag approach. Sound in the short-term, possibly, but not necessarily in the long-term, not when they didn’t know what they were dealing with.
It’s not entirely selfless, that instinct. It’s not just the memory of Steve’s terror, or the echo of someone else’s voice reverberating in his chest; no, not at all. It’s also the wretched covetousness of his dreams, of the bloodied blue blanket and the uniform-clad Steve staring at him with beseeching eyes, and the lives of both in the palm of Tony’s trembling hand.
Wilson’s jaw worked. “But he’s not a kid,” he said, slow and deliberate. “He’s…” He paused, rubbing at his face as he looked away.
Tony snorted, lengthening his stride. “I slept like a baby, Legolas. And the hospital has a lovely view. And the food is delicious. And I’m getting plenty of fibre. Anything else?”
Tony pressed his lips together. “Well, thanks for that pearl of wisdom, Yoda, you have been of no help whatsoever.”
Tony works hard to swallow around the stiffness in his throat. “Whatever helps you sleep at night,” he manages. He braces himself against the worktop and concentrates on staying upright.
“I have been busy,” Mordo said, his eyes flickering between Minoru and Okoye and then - finally - coming to rest on Tony. “Mr Stark, I did not harm your friends. You may wake them now, if you like. I merely wished to demonstrate that this charade is pointless. I am not working with you under duress, but because we need to cooperate.” He half-turned, Minoru turning with him, her hand still on his chest. “We could just -” He stopped, and looked down. “Wait, what are you -”
He watched as Steve thought it over carefully. “Am I… does this mean that I get to go back to school?”
“Some parts. Many parts - look, what I mean is, thank you for, you know.” He waved a hand vaguely. He still wasn’t clear on what the politics were here, other than Barton’s previous comments that there had been a whole lot of shouting (and his own private conviction that T’Challa owed this guy somehow). “... Everything.”
He had nothing else for her, for the well-meaning lies and the machinations and the way she cared so fiercely about people that (he was fairly sure) weren’t quite
“You’re trying to buy his love with art supplies,” Tony said irritably, carding a hand through Steve’s hair and feeling obscurely guilty over the expression on Barton’s face. “It won’t work, you know. He’s just using you to get his crayon fix.”
