He used to think of Rhodey as if he was invincible with the army muscles, quick thinking, and cutting humor, but that - obviously - wasn't always enough to protect him from everything.
He only took a couple of steps toward Stark, who held out a hand to stop him, and then stared when his hands were shaking badly, which was probably the last straw before he freaked.
"I know we're not there yet, but... she has cancer, and she... might not be around much longer, so I was thinking..."
Consciously, that is. It was a different matter that she seemed to be dreaming about her old life often enough and had an intuition to like and dislike the same things older Nebula would.
"Fashionista now, are we, Phil?" Peter teases him as if he knows only too well how Coulson might not just take the first layer off of Steve if he had a chance, but Phil promptly ignores him.
So when Captain Marvel mentioned she was shorthanded on some missions in space, Vision immediately wanted to go.
“What the hell is this?” Quill asked because it looked like a phone with earphones. And not just a cheap model either.
"I see. I haven't been threatened in what it feels like centuries, so... I suppose I could let him have his fun," Loki said, just before Bucky kissed him in appreciation, and when they parted...
They waited, but nothing really happened. So Strange was coming closer to him, and Loki tried to signal with his eyes that he should stop right there, but then the doctor still went ahead and kissed him.
"Wait, I know this one well," Cap spoke up. "Deflecting by crappy humor, blaming everyone else, except himself. The classic Tony Stark move, and you still think I'd put up with him more than I already have to, Buck?"
"It's all part of a bigger plan," Stephen repeated himself. "I've checked all the possible futures, and Earth was destroyed in them all. So I did a spell..."
Thor thought it was best if he left before he could be next, even now that without the inhibitor in his neck, he had a chance to fight Hulk, that was the last thing he wanted.
"The protocol implies to everyone, not just them," Friday corrected. "The Tower is too fragile for any of the Avengers to fight in, so they should be monitored."
Happier than since years, even though most people on the street hadn't even noticed him, and Nat got quite furious with him because Steve hadn't told her what he was gonna do.
attraction between me and Stark, but when you treat me like a hot potato, who you'd be more than happy to pass on to someone else when I don't remember begging you to date me in the first place, I almost wish I had a crush on someone else!"
Rogers does something that Phil can't place: he blushes. It's unlike the rest of the players who are fully aware of the attention they get and even revel in that, and Coulson wonders about that, but Rogers pushes on.
, so if you had a problem, you could have already told me in private. The fact that you didn't, only shows you know you messed up."
"We helped him climb in through the ladies' window! With the secret sneaking skill you taught us, Quill!" she seemed so proud too, Quill didn't have the heart to note that there was nothing secret about climbing things. "So now
But what good did that revelation do now? Never was a drink more tempting than whenever Tony had thought about that, even though he quit because he couldn't take it with the medicine he had to take.
"I'm sorry that I chose to hinder Thanos' plans of destroying half the universe instead. Why do you think I'm here? He has already 4 Stones, and won't stop," Loki told him. "So if she has the Time-Stone-"
"This isn't a trick!" Loki was in disbelief. "The spell can only be undone if we manage to get to some kind of understanding, and while I have my doubts that we'll ever manage to do that, it's immaterial, as long as we're behind bars. Even if by some miracle, I would be able to reverse the spell, you'd be still a prisoner of the Grandmaster, don't you get it? Not to mention..."
"You're right," Rocket said after a small pause. And just when Quill thought it meant he'd leave, he added. "I'll talk to Ronan to leave you alone, and you keep the phone."
"Anything?" Rogers asks, and Phil tries to tell himself, Rogers doesn't even know Coulson is gay, so there's no way he'd be flirting.
"Huh, are you sure I wasn't just trying to do the right thing for once?" Loki didn't like how pathetic the Captain made him sound.
"I... think this is the closest I got to ever watching a game." And it's not a lie, he knows squat about sports.
"To get something you lacked as a child. When your parents clearly were capable to give it, yet they withheld that from you. You feel cheated, so you cheat others. Kind of not that complex of a character, aren't you."
"What would you want instead?" Loki asked, and he realized that was overreach given the disbelief on the doctor's face.
“I became an OSP member because I dropped the ball with Bucky. I should have taken better care of him, and I’ll carry that mistake with me all my life. But at least I’m prepared to do whatever it takes so nobody would go through the same pain as Bucky did then.”
"Umbrella was a keyword used in secret SHIELD communications more than once in the past," Friday told them. "Probably that's why Sergeant Barnes is unfamiliar with it."
"I didn't even notice when I was there," Phil tells her. "I know what you're saying is true when I see them around, but on the court, it's not about that."
Then he was immersed in more water again - he gave Hulk a very irritated high pitched roar - and dried with a towel, only for Hulk to pick him up and put him on the shoulders.
"I think I've met the main story already, and I love her," Wanda looked at Nebula playing. "And I'm glad. Maybe you could also carry all her siblings we're going to have."
"Maybe ask me again after our third date," Tony told them, and Steve couldn't help but think the worst.
"Oh," it was a shock for Thor, even though it could be hardly called entirely unpredictable. But still a shock.
Levi took the last part as an insult, because even though they got along just fine with Tony before, now he was doing everything in his power to make Tony's life harder.
"If you mean that, come back tomorrow night," Steve didn't want to a serious conversation now, fearing that they will just end up fighting again, but he wasn’t just going fuck Tony on a spur of moment decision without discussing it first. He didn’t think Tony would even remember the next day that he was supposed to show, much less go with it.
“Don’t do that,” Jess snaps, “Okay this is hard enough. And I don’t know anyone else willing enough to try.”
and not do any of the things that I've wanted to do with them, not to show them everything I've always wanted to show them. Not to send her to kindergarten or to play-dates."
Steve just nods, walking out when the elevator stops, “Right.” He says and Sam stays where he is, stood frozen as the doors shut again. Peter stands when he sees them, looking at Tony with his lips pressed together, and Steve pauses for just a moment.
Instead, however, she sits and fidgets and twists her fingers together like she isn’t sure how to start.
Peter shakes his head, looking pale, “It’s here.” He says, “The tower.” Steve pauses, staring at him, “Osborn changed it when he took over. There’s a room at the top that he put Tony in.”
Dammit. “Tony – !” He jogs toward him, flinching when the stairs creak as he does and forcing himself to slow down and not upset the already fragile building, “Tony wait.” He turns into the kitchen but Tony’s not there and when he steps out into the hallway, he sees him walking slowly toward the elevator.
Downstairs, he turned on a single lamp and lifted a holographic screen from his tablet to check on his probes.
Anna was in 'her room', which was also Steve and Tony's, and she was fast asleep already when he saw her. Unfortunately, under her hand was a storybook and it was one that he recognised too, which was beyond frustrating. He gently pulled it free and looked down at its cover, his blood warming with anger as he stormed out of the room to hunt Steve down.
“He wasn’t right after you died.” Peter continues, quietly now, “On the news – he cried. And once the Skrulls … when it was all over, he asked me where you were. And when I reminded him, he – ” He blinks, visibly coming to a realisation, “He would talk to himself in the cell and wander around like Luke said but – he was – he kept saying dead people’s names.”
He runs a hand through his hair, wishing everyone would just leave him alone, “What’s going on Jess?” He asks his own question instead of answering hers, and she hunches over.
“Let me look at that,” He offers, stepping forward to take Tony’s hand but it’s snatched away from him before he can even begin to inspect it.
"Uncle Rhodey," Anna was sat in Rhodey's lap, fiddling with his dog-tags, "Why do you smell so weird?"
“Not on the team.” Tony straightens, his search for socks over, “But this is – my house. My mansion. Why wouldn’t I be – ?”
to her despite promising I'd never have to do that when I finally had kids. Hell, I didn't even have a
Tony sat at the counter while Steve looked through the bag that he'd brought, worrying over his bottom lip with his teeth, "God I can't imagine how he must feel." He shook his head, "It feels so unfair. For
He walks through the open and bent-over gate, spotting chains coiled on the ground that Tony must have broken on his way in. Steve drapes them over an overgrown hedge and steps past the graffitied walls and broken beer bottles that now grace their grounds. It breaks his heart to see it and he wonders how Tony had reacted, seeing his mother’s mansion in tatters and abused like this. He shakes his head, stepping through the doors and into the foyer.
Unbidden, an image of Tony comes to him. Tony crying and asking how he can make their fighting stop. Tony breaking down at his funeral. Tony smiling when they spar together and eat out. He shuts his eyes and before he’s even realised it, he’s made the decision to go.
When he returned, Steve was already in his cot and the double bed was free for him but once he lay under the covers he knew that he wasn’t getting any sleep tonight, so he stood and left. May as well work.
He understands their reasons for locking him away, he understands it perfectly, and that’s what makes him so angry. Would he have voted with them to keep Tony barred? To have Shield ‘handle’ his episodes?
Pepper had suddenly been nothing but a pile of ashes at his feet and he'd fallen to his knees once he’d processed that, gasping for breath as Anna had wailed in his ear. Rhodey had found him not one minute later and had flown him away from what became a frenzied rampage of confused and terrified people.
“That wasn’t him.” Jess says, “That was just a suit. Tony wasn’t in the field with Osborn.” She doesn’t offer anything else and Steve sighs.
They leave as a group, Tony helped into the back of the van and belted in. He lets them take him, numb and quiet, and Steve watches them go.
Tony nods, dusting himself off and when Steve walks out, he follows him. They step past what had once been beautifully furnished bedrooms and he helps Tony ease down the stairs without falling through those gaps.
“To stop you from walking away.” Steve answers, “And to ask why Tony’s mind is such a concern to Shield when he’s not an Avenger anymore. He isn’t a danger to anyone but himself like this.”
Tony stares down at his hand, surprised at the blood dripping down to his wrists, “Janet was just here too.” He whispers and Steve sighs, running a hand down his face.
Loki tried to hate this earnestness, but couldn't, not when Steve bought him food plenty times of the day, talked to him, and even risked petting Loki ever so often, knowing full well that Loki would bite his hand off if he wasn't in the mood for it.
"Then we'll just leave when all your other friends decide to show up," Rocket sat down anyway, and Groot followed his lead by smiling at Quill.
But then, only a couple of days later, Steve told him he made popcorn for a movie night and went back to their previous normal so effortlessly Bucky started to question their fallout ever really happened.
The only thing he could do was jump between the threat and the Midgardian, taking a hit. When the Captain noticed, it was funny, because Loki couldn't have told which one of them was more surprised by the sudden turn of the events.
After all, he picked up on Loki's way of talking in less than 10 minutes, laying a trap for Loki just as Loki would have done himself. Loki couldn't help but appreciate the Captain a little bit better after that, so he wasn't as irritated as he would have been if he had to beg for Thor's help, for instance.
"Still, it's... I have a lot on my plate now, Tony..." Rhodey said, and he looked just as tired and worn out as he said, and Tony was ever too happy to accept some resemblance of normalcy between them back.
So he began the incantation, and at first, he didn't think it worked at all until he didn't wake in the Avengers Tower - as Tony Stark.
Rhodey, Pepper, Happy, Bruce, and Peter came to visit, and while they couldn't do anything for Tony, at least they kept Steve company. When time was standing still, that was the only thing that kept Steve somewhat tethered to reality, if he heard them speaking.
"Now that I can hold and not instantly crush the produce, I think it should only get better," Bucky told him. "And I'd do it anyway, Stevie still doesn't like the food of this era as much as the recipes his mom used to make."
Tony looks down, observing the damage. The gunfire's resumed, Natasha and Clint aiming with deadly accuracy. Good. That makes his job easier. The thrusters in his boots are shot, but his HUD and hand repulsors are still functioning.
“You made me wait five minutes to finish up your gauntlet?” she asked, crossing her arms in front of her chest.
“Just a little favor between two pals, right?” Tony says just to dig the knife in a little deeper. “
“At least I’ll die knowing I made King Joseph Rogers as red as his tunic,” Bucky said, mirth dancing in his eyes, a brilliant grin enveloping his face.
With Thor's help, Tony strips out of the armor pieces that are nothing more than dead weight until he's down to his helmet, gauntlets, and chest piece.
"Gross," she laughs, wrinkling her nose. "I'm sure it'll be fine. I meant what I said, you know. I'm glad you guys showed up. You know how much
The wormhole looked like the nebulous, gaping maw of some extraterrestrial beast as Tony rushed to greet it. As he passed through the barrier, Tony could hear nothing but deafening silence. But what he saw…what he
"You know, I tried." The words were quiet, almost too low for even Steve's enhanced ears to hear. "When I had the gauntlet…the stones, I  really tried to bring her back."
“I’m actually not a veteran,” Hailey said, tucking a stray strand of blonde hair behind her ear. “I was…I was in Manhattan,” she stated looking directly at Steve, “on the day of the invasion. It was the first day of my internship and I was so excited.”
“I’m yours,” Tony replied raggedly. “I’m your bitch, sir. I’ll fucking be anything you want to be if you just give me your cock.
, it always leads to something electrifying. Tony's eager to see him, eager to wipe the blood and the bodies of the day's events from his mind.
Bruce stretched a hand out to him, “Come on, Cap,” he said. “Let’s get some food into you.” In a surprising show of strength, Bruce pulled Steve to his feet and helped walk him over to the dining table that had been set for three.
Thor ropes Steve into the strongman game, which attracts a crowd, but who would turn down the sight of two handsome, well-built men lifting heavy things and showing off their muscles? Tony certainly couldn't, and given the way Bruce eyes the bulge of Thor's biceps, neither could he.
Pepper was late. Which was fine, totally fine. Tony knew she was a very busy woman, CEO of a Fortune 500 company and…hopefully not oohing and ahhing over Aldrich Killian’s ginormous brain.
Steve winced. “Sorry, Tony it’s just…you’ve been up here for a while and I was…I was worried about you.”
Steve Rogers was a mouthy, stubborn little punk from Brooklyn who went after what he wanted with a single-minded focus.
“Shit,” he said. He knocked on his forearm and raised his arm, willing the suit pieces to come to him. “Come on, baby.”
They didn’t speak until both of them had finished their cups, just enjoying the relative peace of the morning.
, it doesn't do him any favors. They're almost at the top of the wheel. A stray breeze rustles a lock of Steve's hair, and Tony feels like he's on a cliff's edge.
It takes him a second, but Tony realizes that she's talking about the Avengers. He shakes his head. "They're fine. It's...weird living with so many people," he says. Tony had lived alone for half of his life now, aside from that brief stint in Malibu with Pepper. "They leave coffee grounds in the sink, and last week, Romanov and Barton convinced JARVIS to play Iron Man every time I went into my workshop and—"
The food is strange and the people are stranger and he just wants to go back home. He never thought something as trivial as food would upset him; Steve was a child of the Depression. They were lucky if they had something other than boiled potatoes for dinner at any time of the week.
Steve shifted in his seat, Tony's eyes following the movement like a cat. Tony rose from his seat, goblet forgotten, and glided over to Steve, his hands trailing along the table. How would those clever hands feel upon his skin?
The comms unit on his suit was the first to go, then the thrusters, and finally the HUD. Tony was all alone, flying blind, millions of light-years away from home.
Tony didn't like the dark tone Steve's voice had taken on. He doesn't know much about Joseph Rogers, but obviously, it wasn't pretty. And given Steve's pre-serum height and the slew of health issues, Tony could put two and two together.
Tony lifts his hips to meet Steve, and the hot slide of flesh against flesh leaves him gasping like a virgin.
was forming between the six of them. There had been something there. Something that had the potential to be glorious.
life. He’d be stealing the life of an innocent man and leaving him to God knew what kind of fate. In his timeline, Peggy had been happy. She had lived a long, fulfilling life that included marrying a man that
Tony was uneasy. Not even seven months after the clusterfuck that was New York and the relative peace that had settled over America was being disturbed by the latest megalomaniac with delusions of grandeur; The Mandarin. The American public was left in mystified terror after the terrorist, seemingly arising from nowhere, had taken credit for the bombing of a military church in Kuwait.
“Good thing it was a one-off,” Tony says, hoping his voice comes off light and airy. “Otherwise, I’d be pissed.”
Darkness greeted him. He could only make out vague shapes, mere outlines of objects, wherever he was.
“Yes, sir,” Tony said, silently basking in the growl that had entered Steve’s voice. “We’re far past shyness.”
Steve shook his head, which was the truth. He had heard of the Terminator movies in his original timeline but had never gotten around to watching them. “Afraid not.”
He had pondered the thought of doing as Steve had asked him to for exactly two seconds before deciding to mess with him anyway. His plan, while simple, was genius, of course.
“The human experiments. Why are they doing them in the first place?” He looks from side to side, but they still don’t seem like they’re following him.
Steve lifts his arm, "Here," he says. "Lean into me." Tony does just that and tucks his body into Steve's side, his arm is a reassuring weight around him.
Natasha tilts her head at him again, and he hates how sweaty his palms have gotten, and the hummingbird beating of his heart, like his relationship with Steve hinges on her opinion.
"Did not," Carmen says, and Clint has the good sense to look bashful. "This is normal for us. Especially when someone hasn't reached out in
Tony glared at him, shuffling over to the dining table, blanket and all. “Not all of us can remain young and spry forever.”
"No, because I actually have faith in our teammates. Clint's not gonna peg a kid with an arrow just because he feels like it. He's not the type."
An hour later, when Tony awoke from his nap, stretching languidly like a cat, Steve had prepared themselves a nice meal consisting of blackened chicken served upon a bed of angel hair pasta tossed with garlic butter, parmesan, and herbs. “Damn, Cap,” he said, scenting the air. “Who hipped you onto pasta?”
Steve has that cute little wrinkle in his brow when he's thinking hard about something. His skin burns where it’s pressed against Tony, flushed from the heat of the shower...or maybe Tony’s proximity.
It was nothing. It meant nothing. Just a friendly gesture. The words sounded hollow to even Steve’s ears.
and that's because I have a complete lack of self-control! 🎉 I'm not even going to try and guess what the final chapter count is going to be but I'll try not to go over 10.
“Thank you,” Tony said, pulling Steve away from the dark thread of his thoughts. Tony wasn’t spending the night with Bucky, anyway. He was with Steve. In
That devil’s grin drops just slightly as the word “Rogers” leaves Tony’s mouth. “Would you believe me if I said I was checking up on you?” Steve replies.
Tony hates how he falls into Steve’s arms as soon as his lips meet Tony’s. He had thought once would be enough, just enough to satiate the burning in his blood. He hated being wrong.
On a bitter, cold December’s night, Howard and Maria Stark are killed in a car crash along some deserted back road and something in Tony
It was on his way home from another long day toiling in the sweltering summer heat when things finally,
Steve glared at Brita from where he sat across the same wooden table they had first convened at what seemed like decades ago. “Thanks for the vote of confidence, Brita.”
Thor’s exit was just as flashy as his entrance; as he called out Heimdall’s name, the Bifrost in all of its multicolored beauty engulfed the god, scorching the earth on which he had stood. The scent of ozone and something metallic which Steve couldn’t help but associate with magic lingered on the air.
one still had hope. He’d be leaving behind everything he ever knew but it wouldn’t be for the first time.
Rhodey was followed by Bruce, who had been slowly emerging from his self-induced exile in the tower to spend time with Tony which then meant spending time with Steve. Or maybe it was the other way around. With the re-emergence of Bruce, Steve was allowed into their joint lab (he, sadly, still had yet to see Tony’s personal workshop). Watching Tony and Bruce work together was mesmerizing. In the less hectic moments, where Tony and Bruce were experimenting just for the sake of experimenting, Steve would occasionally join in, asking questions or passing them tools or poking fun at Tony, while Bruce looked on in barely veiled amusement. In other moments when their inventing took a more serious turn, such as when Tony and Bruce had been working together to figure out what stimuli made the Hulk revert back to Bruce with the least amount of resistance, Steve took to simply watching and sketching. His sketchbook now had many a picture of Tony and Bruce’s dark heads bent together in discovery. He found he enjoyed the quiet moments the most. Moments where it was just him and his pencil gliding along the paper like a figure skater upon ice.
. The detonation propelled his suit backwards, his thrusters about as useful as a bonfire would be in Hell.
Steve's hands clamp down on either side of Tony's hips, and Tony knows he's won this round when he sees the dark look in Steve's eyes. He plunges into Tony, fucking a sharp gasp out of him. Tony's not a virgin by any means. His playboy reputation is a well-earned one. But it's been so long since he's been
He was happy now, though. The colder it had gotten in New York as the summer waned, the more he had missed the briny ocean air and the hot California sun. And Pepper was living with him now which was great, really. She’d spend her days at SI’s headquarters being the beautiful, badass CEO she was and when she’d come home, it would just be her and him. No Avengers. No Stark Industries. Just Pepper and Tony. They had date nights and teased each other and sent each other cute texts whenever they were missing each other. Of course there were some things he missed about New York, but Tony wouldn’t give up what he had with Pepper for the world. They were good. Tony was good.
The courtesan stilled, his back going ramrod straight. His following words were cold and filled Steve with dread. “I see. I…suppose I would like to stay at an inn if this is what the next week of my life is to be like.” He turned to the door, and Steve didn’t even know his name to call him back.
Five seconds. For five seconds, he would be the most powerful man in the universe. For five seconds, he considered being selfish.
Returning the Tesseract had been easy enough, yet it left him feeling hollow, reeling from both his past and present—future?—colliding. With every step around the base, he kept on expecting to see Tony in his scientist getup right behind him, some inane, yet amusing quip or another on the tip of his tongue. He also saw Peggy everywhere he went; a flash of crimson lips here, a swish of perfectly curled brunette hair there. He had lingered once more, right outside her office—and he was so
But Tony wanted to. Oh, God, did he want to see just how much of Steve he could handle like he needed air to breathe.
“Stark’s right,” Steve says. Tony tries to hide the surprise on his face. Were his blowjob skills that good? Steve squeezes his thigh in response. “Who’s to say that Loki was the last of them?”
But could they have avoided the war in the first place? What prompted the king of Ma'Hat to court death, for that's what war with Brooke would bring. Five years later, and Ma'Hat had all but fallen, and for what?
If JARVIS had lungs, Tony knew he’d be sighing. “As you wish, sir. I’ve also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore.”
He would never forget the terror and rage that had seized him as he had watched Tony’s mansion fall into the ocean on live television, and if he could help it, he wouldn’t, couldn’t let it happen again.
? If Natasha was here, then of course Tony was here too. Along with the rest of the Avengers. A deep sadness swelled inside of him. Tony and Nat were going to die again and what could he do to stop it? If this was truly Hell, absolutely nothing.
"No," Tony says immediately, putting an end to any questions before they can begin. "We've been friends since high school. It'd be like dating my sister." Not to mention Carmen had known him when he had still been under five feet and had a mouth full of metal. Any attraction on her part had either never existed or died as soon as Tony had opened his mouth.
Tony sat down on the nearest work bench and let out a deep breath. He was so tired all of sudden, like all of the pent up energy he had had been drained out of him. “I’m a piping hot mess. It’s…it’s been going on for a while, but I haven’t said anything.”
Steve had felt good about himself for what seemed like the first time in a while. They had finished working on their last house for the month and a cheery air had followed him for the rest of the day. He was doing good just by being himself, just by being Steve Rogers. He hadn’t been just Steve Rogers in a long time.

Rumlow’s smile dropped from his face as he gripped his reins tight in his hands and spurred his horse onward to catch up with King Joseph and the others.
the concern in their gazes. He mumbled some excuse or another—he couldn’t be bothered to come up with a good one—and pushed away from the dining table, striding, damn near running to the elevator. As the doors slid to a close, Steve felt himself sinking to the floor. His heart pounded away in his rib cage like a prisoner begging to escape his cell. Short, wheezy breaths escaped his lips.
Mark 42 rose from the couch and clanked towards her. “Just breakin’ it in. You know, it’s always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first.”
Steve wasn’t ashamed to admit that he laughed for an unbearably long time. “Oh my God,” he gasped out, tears running down his cheeks. “Tony, what the hell?” He said incredulously, not even realizing that he had slipped up and called him by his first name.
Chris placed her hand on Jackson’s shoulder who squeezed it in return. ““An inch to the right and I probably would’ve bled out.”
“There’s no rule against having guests,” Bucky snapped, the friendly atmosphere vanishing like a thief in the night.
The muscles in his thighs trembled with the effort of straddling Steve for so long. He made to get up and fetch a towel, but Steve continued to hold him tight. Tony wriggled in his grasp.
Steve passed the nearest towel, already stained with grease, to Tony in silence, choosing instead to focus on Tony in his natural habitat. Steve’s bike had been acting up for a few days now and he had remembered Tony’s offer to work on it three months ago and figured, why not? He had always wanted to see Tony’s workshop and his bike was on the fritz, why not kill two birds with one stone?
“I was heading out to lunch when one of the…ships? That kind of looked like whales? It um,” she looked down. “It crashed into the building. I was stuck under the rubble for twelve hours.”

“Thank you all for sharing,” AJ whispered. “I just want you to know while you’re in this room, you will
“No,” Steve began, sitting directly across from Tony. “I didn’t break anything. And I don’t need upgrades or anything like that.” Steve bit his lip. “Think of it as an apology. And a peace offering.”
Tony's toes curl as he nods and lets the moans he was holding back slip from his mouth untethered. If anything, they spur Steve on. His bed squeaks with each thrust, and Tony can hear Steve mumbling under his breath, a litany of "I need you," and "So tight, so
"And you've already skipped breakfast, sir," JARVIS says. "It is recommended that humans eat at least three meals a day."
Once again, I do not own Marvel or anything associated with it but if I did, this is what I'd do. Be prepared for (bad) comic book science/magic.
"Are you sure?" Steve may be a super-soldier, but Tony's not going to be the one stuck explaining to Fury that Captain America was out of commission because of a blowjob gone wrong.
Tony would hardly call it a kiss. Kisses were sweet, romantic things that left you giggling and breathless. No, this was a
His knees. He needs to tuck his head between his knees. Tony does just that, breathing in deeply through his nose and exhaling through his mouth.
Steve blinks at the abrupt change in their conversation, but he rolls with it, bless him. "Of what?"
It was like someone had paused a movie with the way Steve and all the others seemed to freeze at the exact same moment.
Thor smiled brightly, clapping Tony on the shoulder. “Thank you, Stark. That is quite generous of you.”
He was running out of time. The others could only hold off the Chitauri for so long before they would eventually be overrun. He felt like Atlas, bearing the weight of the world upon his shoulders as he carried a nuclear warhead powerful enough to level all of Manhattan and then some into the heavens. The air got thinner the higher he climbed but still he pushed on, activating the thrusters hidden in the calves of his suit.
Almost as if summoned by their mention of him, the low rumble of thunder could be heard in the distance. What had been a clear, bright day, quickly turned into a gray, overcast nightmare as the God of Thunder appeared in a flash of lightning and wind.
Time travel never got easier. But considering the fact that they were literally bending the laws of physics to their will, Steve guessed it wasn’t
Even though he had opted to sit away from the fire, the scent of roasted rabbit wafter over to him. His stomach growled. The midday sun beat down on their heads, a bead of sweat rolling down Steve's neck and into his tunic. He bounced his leg, his body thrumming with excess energy. He wanted to run laps or perhaps mount his palfrey. She rode like the wind and made Steve feel as if he had been born with wings.
"...It's not me you should be worrying about," Bruce says. "But...if you're going...I guess it'll be fine."
Tony avoided his gaze when he said, "You looked troubled. I thought to check on you. Excuse me for presuming."
Steve had started team dinners because they needed to “get along” and “work on their social skills.” Tony was starting to think Steve just started them because he was a shameless exhibitionist.
Clint and Natasha make their way to the sharpshooting booth, Thor and Bruce walking along behind them.
Everyone sensed the change in Steve, everyone except Rumlow, who plowed on uninterrupted, eager to finally get a word in.
“And then you came in here all handsome and seductive,” Steve continued, ignoring Tony’s sarcasm. “I’m a weak man.”
experience with therapy; he had observed a few of Sam’s sessions at the VA and led his own support group after the Decimation but he had never done something like this. He had never been the patient. And that’s what he was, wasn’t he? A patient? Because his mental illness was just that, an illness. And it didn’t make sense to let a physical illness like a cold or the flu go untreated, did it? Why would a mental illness be any different?
He didn’t mean to get so close to the courtesan, but he just had to stop him from leaving, if only to right his wrongs.
Tony never thought Captain America would be so handsy, but he was quickly learning that Steve Rogers and Captain America were two different people.
Tony picked up the bright fuchsia crayon the girl had brought with her and drew a speech bubble to where his mouth would be.
"You make him that way," she says, shocking him again. His stomach drops, and whatever peace between them quickly disintegrates. What does she mean by that? What could she possibly know about him and Steve and all the complexities of their relationship?
“Rumlow is a coward masquerading as a knight and unworthy of his title,” Bucky said. “He preys on the weak to make himself feel strong.”
Steve groans when Tony slides his hands into Steve’s hair, thrusting his hips shallowly into his mouth. He pulls off of Tony's cock, and Tony whines at the loss of his mouth.
She nodded. “The hemorrhaging was brought on by your extended jaunts in time. As I said earlier, even I can only use the Time Stone sparingly. And that device you created, probably operates under similar rules.”
“I am not yet king,” he said under his breath. “These are still my father’s men. One of these days, he won’t turn a blind eye, and I won’t be able to help you.”
Mocking outrage, he said, “Excuse you! I’ve been getting much better in the kitchen. None of my food is undercooked now.”
exactly he was trying to say but the Ancient One seemed to understand what he was getting at anyway.
Tony watches Steve throughout the briefing. He's been watching Steve a lot more lately. Ever since that ride on the Ferris wheel, he's been trying to be more open, more inviting, Steve taking to his attentions like a starving man to a banquet. Steve's all business right now. His jaw clenched, he's scrolling through the digital files JARVIS compiled for them on a tablet with a single-minded focus. His free hand rests on his knee curled into a fist. Tony can practically see the rage in him rising like a tidal wave. He can't imagine how Steve feels, to devote himself to something, to
And there was Steve offering him a way out. If Tony didn’t already love him, that surely would have tipped him over the edge. So what else was he supposed to say except for yes?
“Hey, Cap,” Tony said, trying to force a smile but it wasn’t right. It wasn’t a real smile. “I’m gonna need you to stay with me, buddy? Can you do that? Can you count with me?”
“No,” Jarvis says. “My mother always told me to never measure anything. The food tastes better that way.”
When Tony righted himself, all that was left was his face plate. Tony narrowed his eyes. “Come on. I ain’t scared of you.”
Rhodey shushed him. “Look, the public only knows about three. And Tony…nobody can identify a device. There’s no bomb casings. Not so much as a sliver.”
Tony isn't new to desire or lust, but the need burning inside of him like a red-hot coal consumes him in its intensity.
“Yeah. Well, so I run his credentials, I make him; Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in…where were we in ‘99? The science conference?
Steve sighed, sinking back into Tony’s touch. Step 2 was going on much better than he had initially thought. He had been sure that he was going to have to pull out the big guns, puppy dog eyes, sitting in Steve's lap, the works. In hindsight, that should have been his sign that Steve was up to no good.
“Damn it,” Steve growled under his breath, stalking after the courtesan. “Wait! Wait, damn you, wait!” The courtesan paused right at the threshold, allowing Steve to catch up to him until they were face to face.
Steve returns the favor, taking his time as he washes Tony's body, lingering over scars, old and new. He pauses when he reaches Tony's sternum. The skin is smoother there, newer. Tony can hear his heart beating like a war drum in his ears, and he's almost certain Steve can feel it.
"I'm not gonna bite, you know," Steve mutters when they start to ascend. He won't meet Tony's eyes. "I...I know you're afraid of me."
"I don't see one, either," Tony says. "I see a genius nuclear physicist who moonlights as an equally amazing superhero."
Wrecked is definitely the right word. Tony's willpower is equal to that of a Jenga tower right now. One wrong move (or right one depending on who you ask), and he'll come tumbling down, and Steve will have to pick up his pieces.
Later on, when they're all piled into Tony's limo like they're going on a field trip, Steve texts him even though they're sitting right next to each other.
There’s a sadness to Tony too. It’s one Steve recognizes because he can feel it in himself. It feels like the Atlantic Ocean flooding his mouth and sapping the strength from his bones. He sees it in Tony when he thinks no one’s looking. He sees it when someone brings up his past, the drinking, the parties, the carelessness and a rotten taste fills Steve’s mouth when he remembers what he said on the Helicarrier.
Tony looked down at the drawing and his heart nearly burst at the sight. The picture was a crude drawing of him in his suit with the nuke…strapped to his back? He squinted his eyes. The nuke was most definitely strapped to his back and the coloring of the suit was a bit off but Tony loved it anyway.
Now Tony’s pouting and look, Steve prides himself on being a gentleman and considerate, but he can’t help but lean forward and kiss the pout from Tony’s lips. It’s only fair after Tony kissed his cheek. Tony’s lips are soft and
And he finds himself meaning it. He’d give Steve the sun if he asked. He tries not to let that scare him.
Tony was at his worst right now, drunk and snappy and full of self-loathing, and he would say anything to push him away. “Tony,” he said. “You don’t have to do that. Not with me.”
"Easy, Tony," Natasha says when she notices him hyperventilating. "We made it. We'll be leaving soon. We just need to find what we came for."
A million emotions slammed him all at once. Anger, fear, so much fear, but…there was hope too. Just a sliver, but he would hold onto it with all of his will.
It’s odd, living by himself again. Of course, Tony brought his bots with him, and he integrated JARVIS into all of his personal residences. Still, there was no Pepper to remind him of some upcoming awards ceremony, no Rhodey to get into trouble with. Happy went with him because wherever Tony went, Happy followed. Tony’s sure Happy would have followed him into battle if he could. But Happy doesn’t stay in the tower, and Tony doesn’t expect him to. He knows Happy has a life outside of chauffeuring (and he hasn’t missed the looks between Happy and Pepper whenever she’s in town. He’s happy for them.)
Thor steps up next and, in true princely fashion, bows, bringing Carmen's hand to his lips, pressing a kiss to the back of her palm. "A pleasure to be here, my lady," Thor says.
“No, I suppose I don’t, do I?” she mused, then paused before saying, “Brita. You may call me, Brita.”
The boardroom feels like a matchbox with Steve so close to him with no buffer. Steve’s making himself useful and tidying up the papers and glasses strewn about the table. Tony pours himself another finger of scotch, lets the whiskey burn his throat on the way down. He needed something to ground himself. His eyes follow Steve’s every movement like magnets. Heat blossoms low in his belly when he remembers how Steve had touched him like he was nothing but a toy for Steve’s pleasure. The thought shouldn’t turn him on as much as it does.
There's still that gnawing pit in his stomach at the thought of the Avengers running rampant around a carnival, but they could use the publicity. Maybe it'd calm down some of those Daily Bugle conspiracy theorists who thought that the Avengers were Chitauri shapeshifters who actually started the invasion. Tony has a video of J. Jonah Jameson screaming about it saved to his phone whenever he needs a good laugh.
“What?” Tony says, only a little dazed, or so he hopes. Part of him flinches at the thought of Steve realizing just how far this well of desire he has building beneath his skin goes for him.
But he knew this game. He would only touch Steve when Steve was ready for him. The blond man stroked himself to full hardness lazily as if he wanted to be anywhere but here. Tony would just have to change his mind.
you,” Steve said, a sneer twisting his handsome face. “Do you want to show them, huh? Wanna show them how much of a slut you are?”
For some reason, Tony thinks of the kid he met not even a year ago when everyone thought he was dead: Harley. Tony didn't hug Harley. He didn't have it in him to hug Harley. The kid deserved it, though, for dealing with Tony's shit. Tony liked kids well enough, but having one of his own? He would never admit it out loud, but it scared him. And Steve...Steve deserved more than a coward.
Bringing the needle gun to his forearm, without hesitating, Tony pulled the trigger, successfully injecting the micro repeater into his bloodstream.
"Because I can," Tony says. He lets the water run down Steve's back, washing away the suds before he turns him back around to face him. "Because I want to," he whispers like it's a secret. "Is this okay?"
Steve trails off. Tony doesn't want to think about what his death would do to Steve. On many occasions, Tony had learned to never trust people who said they didn't have a dark side because chances were that they were lying. Steve had been his exception. Steve, who held him when he was lonely and drank hot chocolate with him on the nights when his demons got to be too much. How could someone like that have a dark side?
And when Loki tried to pull at least some of the darkness from Tony, now he was met with impenetrable walls. Stark not only had a brilliant mind, it seemed, but some elementary magic as well without noticing.
"Five? One day I'm gonna have to get back on you for this," Tony said. But when Loki fell silent, waiting for that, he added. "Not today though, when you're incapacitated and still haven't told me shit. So go ahead. And talk."
"For the record, I didn't mean all that," Bruce warned right away. "But it had to be something that's-"
He took over Sam's group. Helped Bruce trying to fix the mistake with the Hulk formula, which was more often than not just Steve giving him another blood sample, but sometimes they've also talked.
He didn't realize how much time had passed because unlike the others, Barnes didn't talk too much to annoy him, letting him work, sitting as patiently as a rock, watching
But, he's also so sincerely apologetic and nice in the morning when Phil's mom finds them still next to each other that she's charmed and not only lets Steve stay where he is, but even years later, when they visit Coulson's parents for the holidays, she still remembers what Steve likes to eat at it takes it up on herself to make all of his favorites - while none of Phil's.
"Tell that to all the people I had tricked in the past," Loki felt somewhat underestimated now, no matter how Bruce was right and he was trying to lie.
And the dating pool outside the conventional soul-mark bonding was just a series of one-night stands. Everyone who gave up on their mark for one reason or another was clear that they might never get a chance for something real, so none of them even tried, Tony included.
Rocket would have gone to the prom with Quill if he asked for real, and... he was no longer surrounding himself with people he didn't like so...?
"Oh? If that's a thing, that's Steve's jam, not mine. Helping elderly ladies to cross the street, rescuing kittens from burning buildings, waking up coma patients with a single kiss..."
Strange still wasn't playing along, so he didn't know. Loki could have kept it from him. But there must have been a reason Jade locked them up together, and not one by one with a perfect future counterpart. This way, they could get a glimpse of the future, sure, but also talk.
A bit sluggish in the daylight, but having better night-vision than Loki himself. Or the fact that Barnes had some kind of magic lingering in him, even if sometimes more, sometimes less. Sometimes being almost cold to the touch, sometimes warm, and all the more passionate.
"It's not a spell. If you learn to channel my magic, you can use it to keep your hands steady," Strange explained. "It's a constant effort, but you-"
"Only you don't know, possibly on the entire planet," Rocket told him with a teasing smile. "You're lucky you're so cute."
situation, Strange realized when he managed to get out of under all the rubble and get to Stark, who was... having a panic attack.
Thor showed up though, looking nothing like how Steve had left him, defeating Thanos with the element of surprise.
If Loki took just a longer look into Bucky's head, he should have figured that the triggers were still there, but he didn't even try. He didn't ask Barnes about it either, enjoying their arrangement too much.
"I want to be. But I also don't want to close myself off from you, and I'd like her to meet you. If you don't show, she might just think I made you up to make her feel better, you know."
Or at least that's what Strange thought, until Thanos came, and was defeated. And he had his body back, feeling much better about that, but quite like how he also lost an opportunity for something else.
He expected some anger, hate, or at least some kind of childish remark in return, like Thor, would no doubt react when Loki was impossible like this, but maybe the Captain was more than just what met the eye because he only gave him a look.
"And if you feel like you need more time," Steve said, looking at Bucky who only nodded before Steve started speaking. "We can just watch another crappy movie or two tonight instead."
And he didn't let go of Quill's hand for the whole night, although he didn't try anything after the kiss either. But even the best nights had to end, so they were going home in the limo, Gamora arranging for the driver to take Rocket and Quill back last, maybe to give them some time together.
idea, because Tony had just returned from space, and he wasn’t taking any hormone adjusting medication or could bother with the usual scent-masking routine, and as he closed the last of the distance between them just for a kiss, Steve suddenly felt flushed and very needy.
It turned out to be almost as a repeat of the night before, except this time Tony let Steve do this, but still was giving him acerbic looks. While Steve ignored the fact that grinding together was primarily a male Alpha couple tendency, and it was nowhere as satisfying for him as if Tony took him for real.
Steve's predictions of the world not needing superheroes but common folk who were still willing to take a part came true, so when Bruce had "cured" himself, and now only became the Hulk if he chose to, and mentioned that in the meanwhile he also cracked how Steve could be turned back to himself, he was just telling it as a joke, but Steve's mind kept on working on that.
A couple of people took pictures, so now the social media was full of them kissing, and while people just mostly ignored Quill, Rocket had it worse, with everyone saying he started it, and finally, it wasn't a surprise that Rocket's parents saw, and decided to get a private tutor for their son, after all, not even letting him attend school any longer.
Once they got the Stones, there was the question of who should use them, and it came down to Banner and him.
"I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about," at least, Steve was tactful not to give anything away if Rocket was bluffing.
And they were about to take off to get some food, when there was a sudden screeching noise that stopped them both in their tracks, while Jade and Wong appeared, running.
The first time it happened before New York. Steve barely knew Tony then, and they got off on the wrong foot right from the start.
Coulson thanks him for the opportunity and leaves, but later at night, as he listens back to the recording on his phone, and gets to Fury's bit on the aliens, he feels so bad for not paying proper attention and Fury even noticing it, that Phil pulls up his laptop and spends hours on the internet learning more about the sport.
"I think he just wanted to do his usual I’m-such-a-hero routine, no matter what the question was, Nat," Rhodey gave Tony a teasing smile.
And when Loki had managed to overpower the Winter Soldier (with the help of the Avengers only, although he'd never admit it), and spell Bucky's mind back, Barnes was hurt.
It was though. When Steve chose to become himself again, he had nothing to lose. Now though? It felt like he had a lot of things. Even Thor's friendship and how that affected all the Guardians if nothing else.
“I’m willing to try and see if that’s true,” Steve kissed him, but then pulled away for a brief second. “Just... please don’t act like this on the field, I don’t think I could concentrate on the mission at all...”
Minor inconvenience was that he still couldn't speak, so he had to connect his phone to Friday's speakers around the house and "talk" to Barnes through it, feeling a bit like Hawking, but he certainly wasn't going to write notes on paper.
"Tell the army they either take you back with this tech, or they get nothing, it's as simple as that," Tony couldn't care less about that. It was so different, finally seeing Rhodey being back to himself again, and that's why he made the suit in the first place. "Or maybe I should tell them, so they better accept it."
"I'm a 94, from Brooklyn, and I used to be allergic to cats. Well, any pet with fur, really, but-" the Captain disclosed, making Loki interject.
care less what someone did in their bedroom!" Steve was growing more agitated as well, and Tony could only inwardly sigh.
Thor didn't want to kick the green monster when he was already down. But just when Thor was about to leave, he heard Banner's voice.
"I'll deal with this," Steve took pity on him. "It's as much in my best interest that nobody else ever sees this as yours, after all."
"The paint is for representing the speed," Tony said, mildly offended. "But I'll tone it down to your boring taste, should you want to, I mean..."
"What? No!" Tony told him, but his carefree chatter was good as gone. "If you must know, there is something I never told anyone, but-"
He almost had a heart attack when there was some strange, sudden noise coming from up close, and he realized he was doing it.
“Well, good of you to notice,” Tony said. “Because it always makes me wanna punch you, but I don’t think I’m able to do that at the moment, and I’ve also missed your sorry face.”
"No, it's not... You might be, but I need to know," Strange frowned at him. "You're sure you weren't wearing a ring like this?"
"Yeah, Cap, but thank you for thinking if someone was emotionally scarred, it could be only me," Tony noted. "Especially given the track record of your boyfriend. Wow."
It was the best end of the world, and Loki has already witnessed the end of two worlds, but he guessed any number of them could come, and he'd hardly change his opinion about it.
"We already do," Loki was deliberately obtuse. "And we're also in agreement that nothing more should happen. If we have to parent her from here, then that what we should do, not letting her-"
"And now you know I haven't been lying to you and the Grandmaster is dangerous," Loki added. "So, you need to do exactly as I say."
Loki was about to throw up. Having a child with this ridiculous of a person was worse than having a Frostgiant baby.
"You used to be a surgeon," Steve looked at him. "You operated around tissues all the time, and somehow found a way. So concentrate the time-spell as you would have a scalpel."
"I do too. But I'm also leaving for college soon, and it's not like my parents allow me visitors. Especially guys."
"What's up, Cap? The land of living has finally proven too much for you to handle so you decided to visit my crypt?"
"It's Dave, actually," Dave corrected, and left with an apologetic smile, while Bucky was tempted to smile back. He washed his hands and would have left himself, if Steve didn't stand in his way, blocking the door with his frame.
Bucky only stared at Steve then, in disbelief. It seemed no matter what he could say would only piss Steve off.
Also, AU Howard Stark warning (although it could be argued whether he is that different really), and maybe this Tony went to boarding school a little later, although not necessarily?
"I didn't. With you dying," Steve said. "I'm selfish like that. I've spent the last weeks thinking I can't even imagine a life without you."
"I do, it's true, he's nothing without me. Used to be, but now a six-month-old child is running the family business instead of him," Loki told the old lady, who was still there, but then made a very swift escape when Loki openly turned to her.
"Buck, I'm sorry. You're the most important person to me, no matter what. But you have to tell me things, so I don't have to find out like this," Steve ran after him, and everyone in the bar was openly staring at them, but Bucky didn't care.
Tony sensed how Loki was more distant because of that, and one day when in bed, he leeched on Loki's magic now, almost giving Loki a heart attack.
"Rabbit is right. Neither of that matters," Thor said. "But I understand how you'd need an excuse if-"
"Well, then you're wrong. I don't own an apology for you when all I did was that I saved your life," Bruce seemed to have an answer for everything.
"You heard him, now could we start?" Fury nods at him, and Phil supposes that's a sign he didn't mess it up badly - even though with Rogers around, Coulson doesn't exactly feel like himself. "Pretty pretty please?"
"I have come up with a better name. SuperLegs. Because I have super legs," Rhodey told him one day when he was already able to walk in the mansion with it, adjusting quickly once Tony got the braces ready. "How much weight I can lift now with them? A car, perhaps?"
"You, and the right thing in one sentence?" Steve tried not to laugh, but it's not like he did a good job covering it up.
"The doctors didn't tell me you had memory loss as well," Tony could only tell him in a similar fashion.
"It's not like that, not this time," she just argued. "This time it will be alright. He won't kill me because he just lost another small girl and can't possibly hurt another. And I'll ask him if he just wants to forget, and he'll say yes. I'll also marry the guy in the red suit, it's been already decided-"
"What's your problem?" Steve also became tense and annoyed by how Tony was acting, not just the other way around. "You know, I tried to be a good sport, truly, but I'm starting to think Pepper was right, and your only grievance with me is that you'd date Bucky if I wasn't."
"Or, make us admit we all want something more because we could have something even better than what we have with Buck. If only we were men enough not to shy away from it," Steve said, just as if urging Tony to make a sarcastic comment on how it couldn't have been possible Captain America who all but just suggested an orgy, but Barnes beat him.
But Tony wasn't hiding behind impenetrable walls now as he usually did. Making Steve feel like he had to take the chance, or he'll never get another, so he kissed the other Avenger, while Tony only kissed him back with more fervor.
Humankind defeated biology. But not bigotry. Alphas (or the people who could trick people to think they were Alphas) were still considered superior, got better jobs, and walked into any room like they owned everything and everyone in it.
But that's also fine, if not nostalgic, just like the mug Coulson bought with Steve's picture on it just as a teasing joke at the bake sale, but that's still in the cupboard there.
Rather than acknowledging the image of the most delicate parts of Steve and how Bucky might have wanted to handle them.
"You know, I think your spells are based on science. If only I had my lab to test everything I can do with your powers..."
He all but dragged Tony to an abandoned chamber, and he pushed Tony down to the closest surface not unlike how Tony did with him the last time, kissing him.
"Even if I could, and that's a big if, his death wasn't ordinary. If I bought him back, that would be only his body. And I'm not trained to use the Soul Stone to even attempt bringing Tony himself back..."
Maybe he was bored on this simple planet, suddenly finding the case of Barnes so interesting. Or, maybe he wondered how much a person can be conditioned to do anything that isn't in his nature - after all, Odin had been raising Loki as if he was an Aesir when he wasn't.
"Oh, I'm angry. Horribly. Both for you keeping secrets from me, and how you seemed to think it was a good idea to try to stop Thanos on your own, risking your goddamn life in the process, believe me. But I don't want you dead. That's kind of part of the reason why I'm furious..." and he wasn't. Or couldn't have been, because he said all this so calmly.
"And this has nothing to do with the fact that all the basketball team members are both insanely athletic and simply gorgeous," Maria points out, giving him a knowing look. "And you could be around them for a while since you've just said yourself, it's not easy to interview all of them at once..."
"The Grandmaster isn't known for thinking clearly. If he melts me while I'm in your body, you might die as well."
"For the record, I'm not that narcissistic," Loki felt ridiculous saying that, but then again, it would have felt weirder if he didn't.
"Good job," Fury says, but it sounds more sardonic than honest. "I've always wondered why you hated him so much but figured it must be because he's the captain..."
"Charge a good price for the posters, and make sure the people trying to get them don't trample each other to death, will you? Ross wouldn't like that."
Oh, and I looked, and there's a Jade in Marvel, but this Jade isn't her, they just share a name. XOXO
Except, Quill was probably the last to know that Ronan now was picking fights with Rocket all the time, and he tried to get other students to do the same as well, and Rocket and Groot's lives were slowly but surely turning to a living hell because of Quill.
When it turned out to be Valkyrie, Thor could only hiss. "What do you think, how much the Grandmaster would pay for a small pet like you?"
“The moon?” Steve asks and Tony’s look is so close to one he would have given years ago that Steve almost forgets what has happened between them.
“He thought he was back in the Hole.” Steve says, numb, “The power went out so it was dark.” As if on cue, the lights switch back on and he throws his glass at his lamp. Jess avoids the spray easily and walks to the window.
, okay. Before being locked up, he was a horror movie. Crying and wandering around like some Victorian widow. He wouldn’t even change his goddamn clothes, and I have a kid to protect.”
“What hole, Tony?” He asks, forcing his memories back, “There’s no hole, we’re just going to my flat.”
Giving him a long, long look, she sat back down and stared at him for a moment before eventually blowing out her cheeks and very visibly deciding to tell him, "I found Clint."
“What is this?” He asks, his voice raw, and he wonders if Jess had called them after he’d refused to help. One of the agents steps forward.
“No!” Tony yanks back but this time Steve is ready and he holds fast, “No, I can’t go back! I can’t, let me go!” To stop him from getting hysterical, Steve does, and he backs up with a hand over where he’d been grabbed, “I need my
Four years ago, he'd returned to New York with his baby in the middle of the negotiations for whether the Rogue Avengers could return or not. Before anything official could have been decided however, Thanos had sent his 'children' to attack Earth.
"I know that," Anna scoffed, "Other donkeys obviously like to look at donkeys." He grinned, shaking his head, "What? What's funny?"
"I know that," He said in his ear, "But parenting is also supposed to be a little less of a job than you make it out to be." He felt like arguing that but the hug felt far too good to ruin, "And she only just went down, if you wake her, she can eat and then sleep."
Once the Rogues had arrived for the meeting that they were supposed to have had however, the fight was theirs. They’d won.
“He keeps going to the mansion,” Jess says, “And that place is on it’s deathbed. I tried to get him out but – he doesn’t listen to me.”
“Sounds to me like someone who was very depressed.” Steve counters and Peter worries over his lip, “Someone who needed help not confinement.”
As Steve nears, he realises he’s muttering to himself as well and his heart sinks. Jess is right. He needs help.
"Is it a monster?" She buried her face in his neck and he held her tight, turning toward Steve's cot to find it empty. Another crash sounded, nearer to the door now, and he spun around to face it. He heard Bruce yell and the sound of the bat and then something was snarling. Anna whimpered in his ear as claws ripped through the wood of their door and one of those creatures from the battle in Wakanda forced its way inside.
"Twice then. I was upset and he was - I don't know." He tugged at his hair, "Sometimes I think it's a good idea, us being together, but then - he does something. Or says something. And I have Anna to think about."
“Did you ever stop to wonder that maybe all this is too much for one man?” He asks and Logan snorts.
Tony huffed out a short, sniff-filled laugh, when he understood, "There are better ways to offer a shoulder to cry on." He said, his blood cooling.
Tony glances around, his eyes dark and wide, “No that’s – I just saw Janet. She was just here …” He points at a hollow entry-way, where there had once been a doorway leading toward the main bedrooms. Steve remembers mistletoe being hung over it and Halloween decorations dangling down to spook half-asleep Avengers.
“We’re going,” Steve snaps, refusing to explain anything until they’re away from this room and somewhere warm and fully-lit, “Now.”
Tony is pale beside him and it takes him a moment for him to realise that they’re not alone. Shield agents are gathered in the grounds, a van parked by the old gate, and there’s a few reporters scattered around as well; not nearly as much as there would have been years ago but enough to garner attention.
“Alright then,” He announced, “Tomorrow, we’ll go out in twos to search for this ship and then radio in when it’s been found. Bruce, Tony – if you can, maybe build something that can destroy it. Blow it up.”
“Fuck,” He gasps, “Thanks.” He shakes his head with a jerk, blinking sharply, “Wow. I’ll uh, I’ll go now. Be careful up here.”
He barely reacts to the blood or to how his palm has now been sliced open, “The funeral, Steve!” He snaps, “For – for your funeral.”
those that had been dusted returned that they'd never have to look at those bodies the way that so many had had to before.
“No.” Steve gestures to the bedroom, “You’re going there.” After a moment, Tony listens, slowly walking toward the bedroom and stepping into it. He looks back once, tears in his eyes.
Tony looks at him and there are tears now, his eyes impossibly huge on his paling face, “I don’t want to go back.” He whispers and Steve wishes this wasn’t his job.
A week later, he heads back to the mansion and back to Tony’s lab. It’s still intact compared to the rest of the building, and he sits at the same desk that Tony had sat in before.
to go outside, I don't need you to encourage her." He sat down on the washing basket, shutting his eyes, and after a moment he heard Steve step around the clothes to crouch in front of him.
“He wouldn’t accept help from any of us and – with everything else and the mess Osborn and his gang left, we had our hands full,” He shifts, “I figured, if he didn’t want to eat, he didn’t want to eat. It was his choice.”
Steve turns away for a moment, pressing a hand over his eyes, “Oh Tony.” He tries to compose himself but too many memories jar his attempts and he isn’t sure he can handle seeing a man he’s loved for so long act so lost. “Tony … “
There’s no protest and Tony stays hunched, his hands over his ears and his eyes shut so tightly he’s likely seeing flashes behind his lids. He steps out and Sam runs around the corner to see him.
"I don't know," She threw her hands up, "I don't understand. His family died, that part we guessed and it's true. They turned to dust but - I don't understand why he wouldn't come to us." Her inability to understand this was obviously what had really gotten her so angry in the first place.
She turns the phone off, glaring at Steve, “Why did I just do that?” She demands and he points at the sky.
I don't trust you. I'd trust you with my life but not my secrets and that's okay, it's how we are, and I
“Why did you have to be real?” He asks and Steve has no answer to that. The door shuts and he’s alone again but he can’t sleep now. He stays awake the rest of the night hating himself and how he’s handling this situation instead.
He stops breathing for a moment, his mind working overtime as he pieces everything together. It can’t be.
He hunched over and now that he was alone, he allowed himself to sob just a little, when a hand on his shoulder almost made him lurch off of the sofa in surprise. He recovered and Natasha rounded the sofa to face him.
"For what happened during our fight, years ago.” She clarified, “I let Steve and Barnes go, remember?"
He takes his bike, knowing the route by heart and avoiding traffic on the way, his head spinning as he goes. The mansion has been barred to the public for being a hazard since the fire and he’d had an altercation with Tony within it as well, which hasn’t done its foundation any good.
The metal had clearly expanded in the heat of the fire and then crumpled from the change in temperature, leaving a web-shaped door with black slits on either side. Large enough for a man of Tony’s size to fall through.
He falls to his knees and lifts the ball of socks into his hands, staring down at them like he was holding his children, and then he’s sobbing.
He turned to go wake her but as though she’d been summoned by his thoughts, she padded into the room with only one sock on.
“Uh, no Anna, you didn’t lose it,” He said, “I just – realised that that book is really stupid and that you’re much too smart for it. I’ll find you a better one.” Tony narrowed his eyes, “It might take me a while though.”
The probe that he'd sent out last January had just passed into another Universe and had picked up numerous life-forms and planets but none matched the signature that matched Thanos' blood. He checked probe-2 and couldn't get a signal, which meant that someone out there had destroyed it or Rocket's spiel about it
He looks at the window that Sam would have fallen through and he knows that drop. Without his suit, to Sam, it’s a death drop.
Her sobbing calms in the hour it takes for Peter to get here and Steve spends it sat at the kitchen counter, staring at his hands.
“There is no funeral!” Steve yells, “I’m not dead! But you will be soon if we don’t get out of here!”
"Probably because I haven't showered in a few days," He said and she scrunched up her nose, "Yeah I know, it's pretty gross. I just haven't had the time."
"Nothing," He came into the room, already in his baggy white Tee and shorts that he wore to bed, "I just love seeing you with her." Tony rolled his eyes, leaving the room to get changed himself but Steve caught his arm before he could leave, "Hey. You okay?"
Switching the lights off on automatic, he closes the door and makes himself comfortable, falling asleep out of pure exhaustion but it doesn’t last long.
A mile away from the bunker, he stored his armour underground and walked the rest of the way to keep the its location as secret as he could. The Avengers were more than equipped with dealing with angry civilians but he had a child to think about and that was a risk he was never going to take. He entered the code to come inside and was met with warmth, the frost on his shoes melting on the Welcome rug.
"This isn't a joke, Steve," Tony said, "I've told you a million times about this, I - this has to be the last time now, okay? No fairytales! I don't want Anna getting stupid ideas, it's
“Yesterday was one of his worst episodes.” Jess explains, “I didn’t know who else to get to help him. I knew you would.”
“Wasn’t your concern needed months before this?” Steve asks, wearily, and he’s surprised Peter doesn’t ask the same of him.
Her tone was beyond mocking and cold and despite his animosity against Clint, Tony found himself defending him, "Sounds like he might just be grieving. A lot of people blame us and to see your family turn to dust in front of you without any way to stop it or avenge them? I mean - I don't blame them for coming after the heroes supposed to stop this."
, I misjudged how much you cared.” She stands, getting her coat, “He put us through hell during the War. All of us, not just you. But you’re the only one who’s run away.”
“Well you’re breaking out again,” Steve tells him, bending to snap the chain. Tony lets him, his eyes dark, but as soon as the metal bends just slightly there’s a pitched noise that fills the room. Tony presses his hands to his ears, squeezing his eyes shut, and the door locks itself from behind them.
Steve blinks twice, his eyes warm, “What funeral?” He asks and Tony slams a hand down over a sharp piece of splintered wood.
Tony scoffed, "I feel like I've been put through the ringer a hundred times and each time hurts in places I didn't know I had. How's that?"
“So there could be more out there?” Tony swallowed, looking out through the window into the forest outside, “Wouldn’t we have seen these ships?”
Tony had kissed him and he’d pulled away. That’s what Tony had used to see that he was real. He’d believed Steve doesn’t want him.
“Those things came out of these huge ships in Wakanda,” Bruce said, “Maybe when they lost to us here, they had one waiting, but we killed their leaders before it could open.”
More join them and he hears Tony panting and gasping in the dark and he realises that this is an alarm. Osborn’s creation no doubt and it’s no fucking wonder Tony’s as confused as he is.
As he walks, he hears a light splashing and glances down to see water. A pipe must have burst recently, which makes the mansion even more dangerous than it already is. He hurries at the thought, his eyes finally adjusting to the darkness, and the water follows him down the hallway.
Steve looks at him, frowning, and suddenly he’s struck with a dull thought, “What’s the Hole?” He asks and he’s met with confused stares, “Tony said to me he didn’t want to go back.” He explains, “To the Hole.”
, Tony left her with him to entertain and went to find Natasha. After dark, they tried to be quieter to keep their location secret, so every step he took creaked in the now silent house. He could hear Anna and Steve whispering downstairs and knew that he was playing a game with her of some kind and Bruce was locked away in his room.
Natasha's was beside his and he wondered if she was asleep but when he knocked, she opened the door immediately, like she'd been expecting him.
His tears bubble up and he almost screams when Jess suddenly speaks, looking out the window, “Angry Sky.” She says and Steve looks up. Despite being past sun rise now, the sky is a dark red, rain clouds rolling through and over what had been pure blue not ten minutes ago.
He wakes to a dull, orange glow, and groans when he realises that it’s his lamp. Sitting up to switch it off, he suddenly sees Tony on his knees beside the sofa, watching him, and he prides himself on not screaming in shock.
“Hi Pete.” He whispers and Peter looks him over. The hoody he’d been in before has been taken away and now that he can see him, Steve notices that the gown is still on. It’s pinned and similar to a hospital gown, and he wonders whether Tony’s actually been to medical or if this is simply the easiest thing to put him in.
"No, I want you to stay!" She said, "But I want you to smell nice too! It's good to be clean." Bruce looked up from his tablet at that, smiling a little, before returning to his work. Tony just shook his head, drying the glass in his hands.
“Yeah.” He steps forward again and this time Tony doesn’t back away, “Yeah, so come on. I’ll drive us.”
No one says anything until eventually, Bucky straightens, “Shield put him in confinement.” He says, “In the dark.” Steve swallows past a very tight throat, “He probably means that.”
“Tony knew.” Steve says, “He wasn’t crazy, he was seeing the future. Osborn had tortured his sanity but the things he was saying were true. The last thing he wanted before he died was to warn you.” He says this to Luke and is bitterly gratified to see him glance away in shame.
"You take on too much Tony," She said, "I could literally smell the stress on you today, I knew you needed an outlet."
“I had a tumour.” He rasps, “Tiny thing but could have gotten bigger. Hank got it out.” Jess stares at him and then at Steve.
"You know, it's nothing I haven't seen before." Steve reminded him dryly and now Tony took his hand off of his arm, "I just - "
She looks disappointed, though not at him, “Of course.” She says, “I’d visit him, on my rota. I was out-voted and Luke and I argue constantly about Dani’s safety and Tony’s mind.”
In Wakanda, Vision had been killed despite their efforts and even with Thor back, Thanos had won. He'd gotten everything.
Looking for her friend was probably a distraction that she needed and god knew they could all use those. He was in desperate need of one himself but with caring for Anna and trying to save the Universe, he just didn’t have the time.
He wishes he could stop it but the agent’s right. If he made a fuss now, as a civilian and a non-Avenger, nothing would be fixed. Instead, he listens to what Jess had said to him before and walks back to his bike.
What I - oh my god," He ran a hand down his face, struggling to calm down, "You're right. You're absolutely right, what I've always wanted is to have a kid with my ex. To co-parent with my ex. To have a child during one of the worst periods in human history and to keep her from the outside world. To have a
Leaving that, he took out his transponder and sent out a signal. This time he tried the Mutants, or X-men, and gave the same message that he relayed each time.
Beast is there already and he’s solemn but clinical, unwrapping Tony’s body and suturing his wrists. Luke’s sat on a table, watching with dull eyes, and he kisses Jess on auto-pilot, his shirt off from a scan he must have just had.
Once they’d all eaten, as per an unspoken routine, whoever cooked the meal that day would clean up as well, and so Tony and Steve washed the dishes between them and packed everything away. Bruce stayed at the table, staring down at his tablet and scrolling through streams of information with a dark frown while Rhodey stayed to talk to Anna.
Tony still shakes his head but he braces for the jump all at the same time, grabbing the edge of the hole once he’d thrown up. He pulls himself up over it and once he’s clear, Steve crouches and then launches himself up to grab it too.
She shouts and Steve glances away, “Don’t pretend like you didn’t, we all saw it. And he’s done shit yes, but he’s been through some shit too.” She scrubs at her face, “And none of us have helped matters.”
“He doesn’t listen,” She repeats, “And he can’t keep going back there but no one – there’s no one willing to try but I know he’ll listen to you. He always has.”
"That's what I thought." Putting a hand to her forehead, she groaned, "And if you think so too then that must be it. He blames us. He fucking
“I can’t find my socks.” Tony tells him, frantic in his looking now, “I can’t – I need them. I’m late.” His hands run over the burnt wood, reminiscent of a man patting the bottom of a drawer. Steve doesn’t say anything for a while and Tony eventually stops, glancing at him and looking so small that Steve almost wants to yell at him, if only to change that expression, “Are we assembling?” He asks.
Tony scowled at his tone, "You know, parenting is a two-person job Steve, you're supposed to remember these things," He sighed, feeling utterly drained and it must have been obvious because Steve wrapped his arms around him from behind and pulled him in close.
"No, everything about Clint was real." She interrupted, "It wasn't to cause a breakdown, I’m not that much of a bitch, but I saw you after you left to put Anna to bed and then I heard you come down here. I just - you let me vent. I wanted to do the same."
“Have a good look.” He snaps and Peter jerks back as though struck. He hates himself for that jab, especially when the worry leaves Peter’s eyes and anger floods them instead.
He lunges forward and grabs Tony by the arm again, hauling him out and lifting him over the window’s ledge. Tony yells and tugs on his grip but he doesn’t let go this time, not until they’re back in the meeting room. He stands on the table and pulls Tony up.
“Tony wasn’t crazy.” He says, “He was seeing things, yeah, but they were all true. Osborn must have known it and had wanted to use it.”
Natasha was gone again as soon as she was finished and Tony kept quiet when he saw tears in her eyes, refusing to even double-take in case someone else noticed them too.
"Daddy," Anna squeezed her arms around him, shaking, and he backed up toward the window. The creature rose to its hind-legs, hissing behind its teeth, and then suddenly it was headless and its body fell backward. A shield bounced over the walls and Steve kicked the head away before their daughter could see, hauling the creature away and tossing it down the stairs. He was gone for a moment and then returned with an all-clear signal.
"Then what is the problem?" He started folding again, "If it could be true? Isn't it better to have something magical to believe in?"
“Um. … you called me.” He sounds small and Steve nods, leading him to the room. Usually, there’d be a time for them to grieve and react to shock, but right now Tony’s body’s still losing blood and the room smells like a butcher’s shop.
He blinked, blinked, and blinked again, "I'm sorry, what the hell are you talking about? Was all that shit about Clint a lie? You wanted me to have a breakdown and needed to lay some foundations first, what - ?"
"I think it's a little more complicated than that." Tony said, refusing the bait of the insult in her tone because he knew that that was what she wanted right now but not what she needed. An argument would not help matters, "Cap and I have a child together, I can't loathe him. We co-parent. And Barnes - it wasn't him, he didn't kill them, and he's gone now anyway. I can't hate an innocent dead man, what the hell would that make me?"
He'd landed outside his tower to see Pepper running for him with Anna in her arms and he'd caught her just as she'd crumpled into nothing. He'd turned to see civilians all around him reacting in shock and grief when their loved ones blew away into the wind and nothing would ever compare to that sick feeling that he’d had in his stomach.
“You moved it, remember?” Steve lies and he shouldn’t do this, he shouldn’t encourage an already delusional mind, but the mansion’s dangerous and they need to leave. “To my flat.” Tony looks at him, “You said it would be easier to dress there.”
“He was the futurist.” He says, “Where was all his knowledge and all his ego when it was needed? When Janet needed it?”
Tony laughed softly, "Well Anna, just because something's ugly, doesn't make it pretend," He said, "Donkeys are very real. And not everyone finds them ugly too."
Tony sat her up and pulled her pyjama top down over her head. They'd gotten a few pairs from several runs and this one had a mug on it and said the words
“No, I can’t go,” Tony protested, standing as well, “I can’t leave Anna here alone with those things out there. No way.”
Steve stands, ignoring the noise, until the voices start to come from within it. Moans and screams, recorded distorted echoes of people they’d once known. He hears Janet, the scream she’d given before being blown to bits by the Skrulls and he wants to throw up. He’s seen the footage, he recognises that sound.
“Hey Steve,” Luke greets but the others look tense. It’s then that Steve spots Bucky in the corner, leaning against the wall with his arms folded and in his old black combat gear, not the Captain America uniform. Jess isn’t here but they’re all clearly aware of what has just happened, “How did it go?”
“He was talking to ghosts. Or to himself.” Sam says, “And he was a mess, he’d get confused. Kept thinking anyone dead was alive and vice-versa.” He stops and Steve stares.
Staring at him for a moment, Tony pushed his anger back, "Thank you." He stood and fixed the lid that he'd just sat on, adding, "While we’re on the subject of listening though, she shouldn't nap before dinner."
By seven o’clock, dinner was ready and Natasha was back. She seemed to be in a foul mood too so they left her alone and set the table for everyone else. Rhodey scouted nights and worked with the army during the day, so whenever he was home he was here only to catch up on his sleep or to eat, which made him the first one down as always.
“Yeah. Me too.” He sucks in a deep breath, looking up at the ceiling for a moment and Sam steps toward him.
“Why didn’t you ask about him?” Is her counter, “I’d no idea if you’d care or not and I didn't want to drag up bad memories.”
“If you have concerns, Director Hill can talk to you.” The agent says but Steve grabs him before he can leave. Several guns are trained on him almost immediately and he hears cameras flashing to document it, “Mr Rogers. I suggest you think before you act.”
Natasha crossed over him to turn it off, twisting the knob tight to save their water, and when she was back she put a hand on his head and pulled her into her arms. He let her, holding on tight, and his anger ebbed in his veins.
He smiled, pushing her hair back from her face though some strands remained stuck to her wet cheeks. The two of them stayed with her until she calmed down and eventually, she lay back in bed. Natasha and Bruce had barricaded the broken window as best as they could in the meantime and the wound on Bruce’s stomach was already healing thanks to the Hulk.
Steve notices and rounds on him, “I guess it was your idea, huh. To throw him in there.” Hank glowers at him, “Punish him for Janet.”
“You’ve been around a lot longer than Tony has, Logan. I’d say you’ve had time to adjust.” Steve says coolly, “And I’d also say that all of us here have had at least two breakdowns in our lives but when Tony behaves vulnerable, he’s treated like a criminal.”
“Did you want to be alone?” He asks and Steve doesn’t answer but he understands anyway and walks around him. There’s something white on the ground and neither of them spot it until too late and Sam steps on it and loses his balance, falling backward and stumbling toward the wide windows where Tony’s bed had once been.
Tony looks up at him, “For you.” He warbles and Steve walks before he can be stopped. He steps around Tony and grabs him by the arm, forcing him to stand.
“And you couldn’t just force him out? Put him in bed and set an alarm if he bolts again?” She gives him a dark look.
“Hey Steve,” Peter pipes up, “Maybe give us a break to explain before you declare whether we can go to heaven or not.”
He tried each one several times anyway because the Universe had to throw them a bone. They hadn't been able to fight Thanos the first time and now there was less of them. They needed more people, they needed an army, and they needed a plan. Looking for Thanos was all well and good but he had no idea what they'd do when they found him. He had all six infinity stones and he'd exterminated half the Universe with it, god knew what else he could do.
“He got you killed Cap.” He says, “He lied. He attacked us, he used us, and he got you killed. All because he was going insane.”
Steve looks at him, “Yes it was.” He says and Tony finally opens his eyes again. He winces at the lights and turns away to see Peter standing there. Steve slowly lets him down but Tony doesn’t even register that he’d been carried in the first place.
“I’m crazy.” He whispers, like it’s all Steve needs to know to justify this, “And I’ve broken out before.”
Since this plane’s crash, everything had been cleared away by anyone able and the graveyards were as full as ever but it was still a haunting sight. Humanity had mourned for four years on for many like it but it didn't feel remotely close to healing yet, though they were getting there. Everything everywhere had changed however, and there was a very strong probability that it would never go back to how it had been.
"If you say so." He counted everything that he'd packed away and added it to the inventory list that they had hanging in the kitchen. There was a picture of the Hulk, drawn crudely with crayon and stuck to the fridge beside it, and it made Tony smile every time he saw it.
Downstairs, they gathered to discuss what the hell had happened now that the shock was over. The creature’s body was in a bag that Steve said he’d dispose of tomorrow but the main question was how it had gotten here.
us, there's the difference," He tucked a strand of hair behind his ear, "And Steve? He makes this complicated, not easy."
He has no idea how he’d done this alone before and just prays that he doesn’t come back again when he’s feeling less agile. Their footsteps echo across the foyer but once he reaches the doors by the end, he notices that Tony’s have quietened. He turns, to comfort him, just in time to spot him walking through the doors to the kitchen.
His anger at Tony is hindering his wish to help him and he can’t keep losing his temper like this. He can do better.
“He’s grieving.” Steve argues and the agent gives him a long look, “He’s lost his entire life, he doesn’t need to be locked away for it.”
He requests access upon arrival and it’s almost instantaneous, which makes him believe that someone has clearly been expecting him. He steps through the elevator and into the communal area, seeing Logan, Luke, Peter, Sam and Hank sitting over the sofas. He feels ambushed and scowls.
Inside is pitch black, shadows moving as the door slides open. Then a single light flickers on and he sees Tony sitting on the edge of a mattress with his head in his hands. He looks up when he hears the door, squinting and shielding his face from the light, and Steve’s chest aches when he looks at him.
He found him in the laundry room, folding away a pair of pants from the dryer, and he snapped his head up when Tony slammed the book down on the rest of the clothes.
“Try what?” Steve asks, a million things on his tongue but he holds them back, if only because she looks so fragile right now.
Steve sits again, his anger still itching under his skin but his imagination conjures an image of a lost and scared Tony that mollifies it a little, “What do you mean, out alone?”
When he steps inside, however, Sam’s already there. He’s on his knees, fiddling with the lock pad and he looks startled when he sees him standing behind him.
“To everything.” She wipes at her nose again, “He shouldn’t be out there alone and I – he won’t listen to me. But he’ll listen to you.”
He calls Peter instead, sitting on the sofa and giving Jess a glass of water. She drinks it, wiping at her face, shaking with shock.
Tony stares at him and when he steps forward, Steve hears a clink of metal. He glances down and sees a chain wrapped around Tony’s ankle; it winds down toward a small hook in the floor and he feels sick looking at it. Tony notices.
“Janet’s dead, Tony,” He says gently and Tony stares at him, “Has been for a while.” Tony shakes his head slowly and despite himself, Steve steps forward to comfort him. He doesn’t get far before Tony jerks back however and he stops, “Don’t. Don’t, I – I need my socks.” He turns back to the pile of debris, “For the funeral.”
He wonders if Tony had made them that way, to withstand fire. He wonders why he didn’t do the same with everything else, but then, it had been his mother’s mansion. Maybe he hadn’t wanted to change more than he already had.
Tony stared at it, panting hard, and all he could think was that his armour was underground a mile away and his daughter was vulnerable and in his arms. He couldn't protect her right now, he had nothing, and if that thing was in here then Bruce wasn't out there. And neither was Natasha.
He walks with deliberate and yet delicate steps, like in a trance, and Steve power-walks toward him to prevent him from reaching the elevator doors.
“But what about – the glow?” Tony’s eyes are manic again and Steve hates this. So much. “The glow in the sky.”
Tony nods slowly, his smile still brighter than anything, “I’m so glad you’re here.” He murmurs, only for his face to suddenly fall, “I’m sorry for everything.” His voice hitches and Steve puts a hand on his shoulder.
He sighed, "Room not soundproof?" She shook her head, "Yeah, well. That’s past-tense and it was only once."
"I know cows are real," She said, her 'duh' voice popping out now, "They make sense and we need milk. But donkeys are weird, they don't make sense and they're
“What day is it?” Steve asks and immediately regrets it. Tony gives him a long look, reminding him of the fact that he’s been locked away in the dark for god knows how long.
He steps into the bathroom when Tony doesn’t come out for a while and finds him asleep over the toilet lid. He sighs, picking him up and dropping him on the bed in his room. He takes a spare blanket for the sofa and promises himself that he’ll deal with this all in the morning. He’s too tired for it now.
He steps closer to wake him before catching sight of the switch by the door. It’s on but with the power outage, useless. He turns it off and feels his heart pound at something that his brain knows but isn’t revealing.
“They killed themselves to get through the barriers before,” Steve added, “What’s to say they got tired of living in a dark ship and a few killed themselves to make a way through for others here?”
Occasionally, when out, Tony would stop to stare at it and sometimes he'd even pray too. Most of his prayers were similar to ones that he had at other sites and they were for those that had been killed aboard planes or trains and so forth and for those that had died beneath them. He also prayed that when -
"So you've forgiven everything because time heals." She scoffed, "Steve lied about your parents, Barnes killed them, I let them go and shut a metaphorical door in your face. But times heals." She stood, pacing.
, Tony, we need to leave. Now.” He puts his hands around his waist, “I’m going to throw you up and then
“No. She’s not, Luke has her.” Steve stands at that, fed up, “Luke’s got her glow, in him. But, the butterfly … it’s black. It’s in his – ”
Steve yells, his voice thundering, “He needed your help, not this! One man and you put the world on his shoulders! And then you pack him up and chuck him in a dark pit to stir his mind until he’s fully insane.” He throws his hands up, “Christ, this is completely – ”
"Easy would be being in a stable relationship. Easy would be Thanos never happening. Easy would be trusting Steve and not worrying every time he tells me something that he's keeping another huge bomb from me. Easy would be not
“Right. Your socks.” He says, “We should get them from my flat first, then come back. What do you say?”
So far, he'd communicated with the Fantastic Four but had had no answer and he'd searched for the Giant Man that Steve had brought to their fight but hadn't gotten word there either. Fury was a no-show and SHIELD was down and he wasn't really sure who else to ask. He'd sent the signal to other Realms as per Thor's instructions and to other planets that Rocket suggested but either the message was shit or no one was around to receive it.
This cabin had originally been built to be a romantic or honeymoon get-away, for when he'd eventually brave a bond, but after everything that had happened in his life that hadn't become likely so this was as good a use as any. He dropped his bag on the kitchen counter and took his shoes off, pulling on the woolly socks that he'd left on the stool to walk over carpet toward the stairs.
She rounded on him, "Of course I blame us," She snapped, "We could have done so much more, we could have
Hours later, Bruce was back in his room with the bottle that he'd found and Rhodey had returned to the Army.
is on the tip of his tongue but he holds it back, “Alright Tony.” He says instead, “We should join them, then. Right?”
“Are you real?” Tony asks and Steve shifts to put his legs on the ground, forcing Tony to rock back onto his heels and then eventually stand and sit on the sofa too.
"Then you'd have to earn it." He stayed blunt, knowing now what this was about, "And vice-versa." She turned to him, meeting his gaze, "So what secret do you want me to know?"
He opens it to see Jess and she looks marginally better than she had yesterday, “You found him,” She says, “Peter says you took him here.” He lets her in, resigned, and she looks around, “I called Shield to get him, I’m sorry. I didn’t think you’d – well.”
“It’s alright.” He says, despite their relationship being far from repair and there being many messes that still need fixing, “Don’t worry about it for now.”
“He made the mistake of mentally torturing Tony as well. None of Tony’s predictions made sense after that.” Jess looks at him, “Angry Sky. Mould.” He points at the wall, “Glowing butterfly is Janet. Black Butterfly in Luke.”
She sighed, running a hand through her hair, "No. Tidying it up will just make me want to do it all over again." She pushed past him to sit over the edge of the bed, her face pinched and pinking with fresh anger. Tony stepped over a pile of what looked like rats but was probably wigs and joined her.
“Shit.” Steve pushes away from the wall. He can’t fit through that same gap so he leaves the elevator to jog toward the foyer. The hole that he’d walked past before is big enough for him to jump through, and he lands in what had once been their meeting room.
Steve put the book down, "Tony. It's a book about a magical beanstalk, I think she's smarter than that."
"She went out looking for Clint again." Steve told him, leaving the laundry for now and walking them both down to the kitchen, "She says he wouldn't go back to the farm after what happened but she goes there every now-and-again anyway, just to check."
Tony snapped, holding the book and jabbing a finger at the cover, "And 'Jack' defeats the giant from
“No.” Tony shakes, “No.” His tears fall now but he doesn’t hide them nor wipe them away, “I can’t. I paid. I paid for it.”
She opens the door, looking back at him the once, “Isn’t it?” She asks, closing the door and leaving when he doesn’t answer. He wants to go after her but his pride and anger keeps him back and instead, he simply locks the door and sits back down.
Jess is sobbing but Steve’s eyes are dry and he pulls her away, calling an ambulance before changing his mind, hoping to keep this quiet. For Tony’s sake.
“Yeah we put food there,” Sam explains, “But I’ve not – I never went in. Just opened it enough to put a tray down.”
“Are you okay?” Steve asks, sitting opposite and meeting her gaze. She doesn’t look up, “Jess? Is everything alright?” Worry starts to fill him, “Is Dani – ?”
Steve just nods, his eyes on the white ball that Sam had stepped on. It’s the ball of socks that he’d seen before, the ones he’d kicked away.
"She can't right now either. Unless Thanos is handing out ballots." Tony opened the cupboard to put the glass away, rolling his eyes.
"Are you sure?" He thought to check anyway, looking about her room and seeing what looked like the aftermath of a small breakdown, "Did you need help tidying after this tornado?"
"Maybe." He folded his arms across his chest, "But as for you letting them go, that's a trust thing. You and I, we don't trust people and you
Bruce followed him down and again, like usual, he looked like hell. Since the battle, he’d had trouble with the Hulk which had also caused him trouble sleeping and he now tried to solve that by drinking as much as possible. It never made much of an effect, the Other Guy soaked it all up, but he looked the part of an alcoholic nonetheless. He was unshaven, barely-dressed, and had a bottle in hand everywhere he went.
“There’s mould in here.” He comments and Steve pinches the bridge of his nose. His walls are a clean white and there are no leakages.
“Hi Daddy,” She said mid-yawn and Tony picked her up to give her a kiss, putting her down on a chair once he was done.
He feels his way back to the door and kicks it hard, three times, hearing it fall before finally seeing light again. The sounds leave the room but continue on, reverberating around them, and he takes the chains off and lifts Tony into his arms.
“Paid for what?” Steve asks, his patience starting to run out. They don’t have time for a breakdown right now, they need to get out of here, “Paid for
“He’s in my room. I’m letting him sleep in.” He puts his coffee down and walks past her to open the door, slipping in quietly. Tony’s lying on his stomach, his face pressed to the pillows, and he looks pale even now.
He looks awful too, in what looks like a one-piece gown and hoodie, barefoot and manic-looking. His hair is longer than Steve remembers and it’s tangled, unbrushed and wild, and there’s a bruise on his cheek.
“Yeah no shit.” She sniffs, wiping her nose with the back of her hand, “But you were friends once. Doesn’t that mean anything?”
“Nevertheless.” The agent says, “This is an order that was voted on by the Avengers.” Steve stops, “And as you and Mr Stark are no longer members, you will have to take it up via protocol.” He pulls his arm free from Steve’s slackening grip, “Now if you’ll excuse us.”
He stands to join her, running his hands down the walls as he does, and his fingers come away damp. He looks back and sees a grey spot growing from a drip of water in the corner. He stares, his hands shaking.
“We couldn’t have had him bat-shit crazy and running around like that,” Luke says, “It was bad enough he’d been crazy and in charge of SHRA, and then even crazier when the Skrulls attacked.”
Tony took it from him as he passed, hiding it away before Anna woke and saw it. Bruce let him, sitting at the table and sighing.
“Yes, I’m fucking real Tony.” He snarls, “This is all real! Our friends are either dead or wanting to be! This is the world we live in and pretending otherwise isn’t going to help!” Tony has gone still now, “I’m sorry for what happened to you, I understand how it might have affected you, but you need to stop.”
He'd flown from the scene, leaving behind a broken team surrounded by dust, but at the time he hadn't cared about anything but his baby.
He paused, his slowly growing relief that she'd come to talk vanishing, "I'm sorry, what?" He stared in disbelief, not quite sure where the hell that had come from, "How is it easier for me? I - what?"
Now, their portraits have been melted into blocks of colour and the screens are black and shattered. He steps over glass and picks his way toward the doors. These had been automatic but now, like the elevator, have crumpled in the fire. He squeezes through their largest gap, his chest burning with the attempt to hold his shoulders in, and he gasps for breath once he’s through.
Steve smiled, soft in a way he never was with anyone else, “Thank you for understanding Miss Stark.”
“We can contact Rhodes.” Natasha offered, “He can scout instead.” Tony turned to her, grateful, “And once we’ve found it, all we need is to blow it up, right?”
“I see.” The agent says, “Then I’ll ask why you decided to grab my arm, if you’ve thought it through.”
"Except Clint was one of those heroes." Natasha countered, "He knows the fight. He's fought the fight. What the hell gives him the right to think we
“Janet is DEAD!” Steve grabs him by the shoulders, yelling, “She’s dead Tony. The mansion’s gone, she’s dead and you’re delusional.”
Now, the six of them all lived together in this bunker, using each of Tony's satellites to try and figure out where the hell Thanos had hidden himself. If they found him, they could fight him. And if they fought him, they could kill him.
In the meantime, he also had to raise a four-year-old who hadn't stepped outside once in her entire life and who felt like she deserved to. And she did but it just wasn't safe.
The remaining Avengers hadn't been given a good light in all this either and had actually been blamed for not stopping this from happening in the first place. One of Tony's private bunkers had been put to use for them, mainly because it was so hidden, and they lived out there now. Occasionally, one of them left to get food for their rations or supplies or to just see if there was anyone that needed help in any way unrelated to Thanos' disaster but mostly they stayed away to lick at their wounds and to plan.
“Yeah.” Is all Steve says to that, using his shoulder to push open the doors out and getting the elevator back down. Sam catches it with him, jogging inside, and he presses the ground floor before he can.
"Yeah and I said I don't want her to have anything with weapons on it." He sighed, "Believe me, okay, Steve. I'd love to give her whatever she really wants but right now, keeping her safe is all that matters. She'll be fine with any doll."
She nodded, not even looking embarrassed. "I suppose. But in my defence, I did believe you are Steve were in a relationship again, and I didn’t think that was stressful," She shrugged, "I mean you've been having sex, so I assumed."
Too many had died, too many had been dusted, too many were lost and missing and too many had taken advantage. Looters and burglars and kidnappers had crawled out of the wood-works and everywhere he looked he felt reminded of all those apocalypse movies that Peter had always mentioned; the roads had empty cars and people kept to themselves, locked away in their homes. All they needed now were zombies.
“What are his episodes?” Steve asks, “Delusions of dead people that the Hole and Osborn’s alarm haven’t helped?”
“I think a visit to the tower is long overdue.” She says and he ignores that and focuses on where Tony is.
He remembers Tony from last night, kissing him and wishing he hadn’t been real. Wanting a ghost of Steve who would at least give him what he wanted before he died.
Tony gaped at her, and suddenly he knew he was going to snap. This was it, and he was too exhausted to even blow up properly.
“Oh fine,” Steve says, “Shield took him. But you already knew that, didn’t you.” His tone must hit because Sam bristles.
“Hey honey,” Tony greeted him, tilting his head for the kiss he knew he’d get on his cheek, “Sleep well?”
Today was Tony's turn to do a run and he used one of his armours to travel back to the tower, which had since been overtaken by a mob that had destroyed nearly all the rooms, stolen all his valuables, and had then left when it hadn't interested them anymore. He picked his way through the wreckage until he found a few bits of tech that he could use and had then scoured for food and clothes in any abandoned stores on the way home.
He crumples the socks in his hands, his sobs grating against his throat and he screams, hunched over and rocking, remembering Tony through the sheer smell of the room.
“I'm not the one who slammed a shield into his neck!” He snaps back and Steve takes it. “I’m sorry,” Peter then says, “I didn’t – I get it. You’re angry. But we’ve not – Tony isn’t – ” He sighs, “He was the least of our problems, that’s all. It wasn’t personal.”
"Yeah." He rasped, wiping at his face, "No luck though." He put the transponder down and sniffed, "You feeling any better?"
Anna was in Steve's arms and when she saw him she reached out sleepily and he took her into his own. Despite her nap, she was clearly tired again now and it had been long enough since dinner for her to sleep again. Steve followed him up to their room and went to the bathroom as Tony went about undressing their daughter and getting her ready for bed.
"Yeah I know. But all we can do now is continue to plan," Steve said, "And hope that when we defeat Thanos, we can bring them back." He pulled free the cans that Tony had found and put them away in the cupboards, along with packets of instant noodles and soup, and then a large Barbie Doll. He held it a little longer before eventually giving Tony a look.
“Bad omen.” She says, “Death. Why, you believe in all this?” The question is a distraction for her but they don’t have time for that now.
Steve catches him instantly and sets him upright, the both of them panting at that near call, and Sam composes himself and claps a hand to Steve’s shoulder.
"The Avengers are synonyms for poor organization, inadequate use of resources, and way too much hot-headedness for me," the doctor declared.
"Aww, and you say the sweetest things, hon," Loki only hoped that payback was fair, and Strange would hate that nickname just as much as he did before.
Steve only laughed inwardly while trying to not look smug that this once Tony fell into his own trap.
And Tony’s anonymous network was used between these Alphas to warn each other if a bigger team of OSP workers were coming to a specific city.
"I mean... yes?" Thor grinned. "I won't deny it if people ask, and everybody already could guess anyway..."
"You know how pro teams also have trading cards, showcasing their players, and stuff like that, right? Also, players endorsing products? So I was thinking, maybe we could have a smaller version of that. Selling posters and merchandise with..."
Time at least goes quickly when Phil's busy, so the extra edition is a huge success, and that only leaves the bake sale, and he kind of has an idea.
But having two close calls on his life, he also wanted to do nothing with it. He couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if they weren't found just for a little bit longer, but one kiss - especially given the circumstance - didn't mean anything, and that was only proved right when they avoided even mentioning it in passing since.
"Thank you," Steve says, but when Phil tries to leave, he also reaches out for him, to stop him. "And I'm sorry."
But Loki supposed he deserved what he got. The deeper he sunk into a lie, the more difficult it was to set it right, and in the past, he was only ever too quick to use lies and magic instead of facing problems head-on like Thor, so this punishment seemed to fit his crime, years later.
But, nobody called Tony out like that without some kind of response, so the next morning Tony found Steve with a giant poster and sharpie.
"Wait, a kitten, kitten, or is that some kind of euphemism for something I don't know and possibly don't wanna hear about?"
"See? That's why I don't talk," Groot winked at Quill and truly didn't speak after, while Rocket kept ranting on about everything and anything, and somehow...
Besides, priority dictated that he'd concern himself less with destroying everything in his wake (maybe even the Grandmaster while he's at it), and more about saving Banner's life, before it would be too late and Loki would be stuck like this forever.
But then there was the Captain, taking him everywhere, and even asking Thor for instance what he truly thought about Loki, and there was no way Loki would miss that talk, even if Thor would only tell Steve the usual customary lies.
But it would be hardly fair from Steve to try to get Bucky to open up to people then make a scene when he finally came out of his shell for a bit, even if Steve didn't share Bucky's and Tony's sense of humor.
Tony shuts off the shower and loans Steve one of his towels. He shuffles into his bedroom, his exposed skin prickling as it meets the air. Steve stands in the middle of Tony's bedroom, hunched in on himself, almost as if he doesn't know what to do with his body. An uncharacteristic display of shyness from him.
,” he says, not recognizing his own voice. His cock pulses in Steve's hands. “Please, I need your mouth.”
The rest of the party had resumed their conversations, trying not to seem like they had been eavesdropping.
It's hard not to when kids start lining up single file for their turn to receive a stuffed animal from Steve.
"Then why—" Steve begins, only to be cut off by Tony's lips. Tony closes his eyes and answers Steve the only way he knows how.
Tony’s itching to interrupt him again, to box Steve around the head and yell that he did the best he could, but he knows it would fall on deaf ears. Steve genuinely believed getting frozen in the ice, HYDRA resurging,
and Tony wanted so desperately to take the head of Steve’s cock into his mouth and lap at the pre-come until there was nothing left.
"He's not like you," Natasha says. He doesn't even have it in himself to be offended. She's right. Steve isn't like Tony and will never be like Tony. A little rough around the edges. "He's not like me, either," she admits, catching Tony by surprise.
"She doesn't half-ass anything, huh?" Clint says. He sounds impressed and…a little excited. Tony can't lie...he's excited too.
Steve looked down, unable to meet AJ’s eyes. It was like she spoke with Steve in her mind. He could see the earnestness in her eyes, how truly she believed that they deserved to be happy. It blew his mind that somebody, a stranger, really, wanted so desperately for him to be happy when he could barely muster up the desire himself.
Bucky sauntered out of Steve’s chambers, briefly locking eyes with the man Steve was to be saddled with for a week. Their eyes lingered on each other, roaming each other up and down. The wave of bitterness at the sight crept upon him like a thief, surprising him with its intensity. He had the strangest feeling that the two were communicating an important message to each other. But what could a nobleman and a courtesan have to say to each other that
Tony walks past Steve into his kitchenette and pulls out two mugs, a saucepan, and a whisk. If he's staying up tonight, at least he has good company. The least they could have are some good drinks to accompany them.
Some days, when Tony smiles at him (one of his real smiles that lights him up from the inside out), Steve figures that he’s close to figuring him out.
It wasn’t until one night, when he, Tony, Bruce, and Rhodey had been playing a simple game of cards, did Steve acknowledge that there
In a technical breach of etiquette, Tony greeted Steve last. He couldn’t find it in himself to care.
His head's all foggy like he just got up from a nap. He's so out of it, he doesn't even realize that the others are walking up to his booth. Tony blinks slowly, trying to ignore the pressure building in his forehead, a sure sign of a headache.
I'm actually really hyped for Chapter 5 but I won't spoil anything. I've tentatively set a goal for Chapter 5 to be up by February 7 at the latest.
Steve swallows before nodding. Tony repeats the process on Steve's front, running the loofah across Steve's pecs and the firm muscles of his stomach, delighting in the way Steve seemed to tremble at his touch.
nonsense. Whenever Happy was with Tony anything could happen.) attitude and his overprotective streak that was a mile wide.
. Tony doesn’t say anything, though. Barton’s eyes have a faraway look; the archer’s mind is on anything but social etiquette right now. Even Thor, who’s a supposed god, looks a bit winded with one hand on his hammer and the other propping up his face. Bruce is full-on asleep, not that Tony blames him, with a shock blanket strewn about his shoulders.
Tony kisses him back, parts his lips and presses his small, lithe body against Steve’s. His arms wind around Steve’s neck and Steve’s settles his hands on Tony’s waist.
They finalize their plans and run them by Fury and what remains of SHIELD. They'll head out tomorrow morning, just before dawn, to catch them off guard. The others have left the war room, either to train or to get some rest. Steve sits at the table alone, the hologram casting his face in blue light.
You'd think Stark could get a lift to anywhere anytime, but with Miss Potts chasing (now Strange) around with paperwork, and his driver refusing to drive him without a talk he insisted they should be having, getting back to the Sanctum wasn't easy.
But also, when Rhodey only gently stilled their movements when the kisses grew too heated, Tony understood.
Or maybe, Loki - the real, vulnerable side of him - was more visible when he was so pathetic that he couldn't even stand, and his mask had especially slipped when he saved the Captain's life.
"You saved your life, you know," the Grandmaster visited him soon. "When you managed to return my Champion, you proved you had value, while that other guy in your body..."
This time, he didn't even waste any time talking, he attacked Barnes while he was asleep, and he was already reading Bucky's mind when he realized Barnes wasn't sleeping, and it was a trap.
"I would have told you to show me not just tell me," Loki gave him a wink, and that, in turn, made Steve laugh. Right before he also applied that advice on their current situation that had nothing to do with fighting, that is.
“You rejected me when even in Heat you wouldn't take me,” Tony spelled it out for him, upset. “So I got sick. But then last night happened and I’m magically healed! It’s you. It was all along.”
"You won't tell Steve such bullshit," now Barnes wasn't just hesitant to leave, but he only came back to Loki's bedside, his glare so intense, that it was almost funny.
But Tony was also left-handed originally and had been bought up to use his right from very early on, so not a lot of people would even guess that the mark for "iron" and "man" was just fake.
"She wants me to go with her gay friend," Quill was irritated because Yondu would never-ever let him even stay out late, but then when Quill was dead set on not going, Yondu even offered to help.
"Captain, I can help save your friend's life," Loki told Steve over the comms. "But only if you leave. You can't see this."
"Great. I still have just barely enough magic to sustain a projection for each night, so my life is pretty much back to normal, but I also got to get some sleep, which is better... But you aren't here to talk about that, are you?"
"Wait, so you're saying Tony can't leave, but we could?" Steve asked, and Friday answered him the same, ignoring Tony's previous command.
It was such a lame excuse really to dance with Rocket, but by then, Quill was already doing it, and...
He wanted to teleport behind the other two, but his control sucked, so he ended up next to them, but they didn't know that, right?
Since killing was frowned upon by Thor, and Loki no longer wished to provoke him without a good enough reason, his self-preservation overruling his impulsivity, Loki couldn't just trample on the mortal, he had to get a little bit more creative to punish him.
"I expect he wanted to do that for a long time. And he could have used his magic or the staff on me, or just picked any of his favorite knives that would have done more damage, but he didn't, so if anything, I should be grateful," Thor mused.
"Now, but when I grew up, it was still... never mind," Steve considered, and judged it didn't matter still, but then Thor stopped him.
Not something Steve could claim of any of the people he knew now, and it shouldn't have mattered, of course, but it did. Losing to Thanos with all his power, speed and strength felt as if Steve lost because he forgot how it felt when he had none of that.
“The elixir Marvel got me did wonders, and you should know by now, if you want me in bed, all you have to do is drag me into yours.”
Tony started drinking like there was no tomorrow, Cap tried to stop him, but that only made him drink more. They were almost half-way through
"Um, that would be Bruce, probably. He's great, you know," now Tony was pulling his leg as if he didn't even get how Loki was referring to himself.
"If you already surmised I'm attracted to men, and you're looking for intimidation, not something else, maybe you shouldn't settle in my lap," Barnes surprised him then by saying. If it was a move to distract Loki, Loki himself couldn't have orchestrated it better.
"Except you don't. Not really," Barnes looked at him. "And you only grabbed me last week because the only other person present would have been Steve, and you couldn't risk him finding out first-hand just how much of an effect he has on you."
"Believe me, I thought magic was bullshit as well at first, but if you don't want to level half of the city, you have to trust me."
"Don't do that," Tony frowned. "Don't patronize me by telling me I did everything right when you're upset. It's worse than if you told me the fucking truth."
"We're like family, yes," Groot told him. "But I'll never be Rocket's type, and I'm completely fine with that."
"I've seen your medical history, and most of what you had have some kind of treatment now, just... I want you to be sure. The human body can't handle the transformation back and forth, so if I turned you back to just..."
"Jesus, boss, let me take you to your room," now it was Happy who let go of Pepper's hand, and instead, got hold of Tony. "This is a new low, even for you."
So he absorbed all the energy he could, from the spell that has been already released and substantially more powerful than him. He fully expected to die, and it's not like it would nullify the enchantment entirely. You couldn't put back a genie in a bottle, even though Loki tried.
“Jarvis. They’ve tried to get rid of him, but he was hiding from them all these years. It took me 20 minutes to get him back.”
Actually, Loki wouldn't admit, but this lowly creature had a quicker brain than probably Odin and Thor combined, which was admittedly a low bar, but still pleasantly refreshing.
And it's not an exaggeration either, and this time, Phil thinks it's kind of endearing to watch him eat all the food he'd ordered.
"It's the young of a dog. And if anyone saw you, I could just say you ran away in the Battle, and I'm only keeping you until I find you a home. It's perfect. You could even leave this room without anyone suspecting," and Steve typed in "puppy" to a magical device, and produced pictures of the said animals.
"Learn my secret once, and it's over," Barnes acted nonchalantly. "Put that off to a later day, keep me in a limbo of when you'd try to find it out, and until then, I might just be pressured to be as entertaining as I can be."
Thor wasn't mighty. He lost his father, he lost his hammer, and now his dignity: Thor barely got out of the prison in Sakaar when Loki turned him into a small, weak, but always incredibly hungry beast with a yellow-orange fur.
So he went with a cat as a disguise, and not only because he knew more about the creatures now, thanks to a page called Youtube and all the cat videos on it. He could climb up to the window of the room Steve was kept in, and get in without a problem.
Peter didn’t want to cry, but when he saw the carnage of the pages, still wet and almost like a paper mache, he had tears in his eyes, even if also some dignity so he wouldn’t start to cry in front of someone else.
"Look, I'm sorry. We'll talk about it back home, right? I mean... if we go back to the things were, we have no reason to end something that has been working out so well for so long..."
"That's what Strange said, but I disagree. You're basically saying that you took my deep-rooted self-hate, self-doubt, and dark thoughts away, making me feel better while you also got stronger. And that our relationship isn't just special but even magically strengthened. As if you were a frickin' good vampire, spreading happiness and dating me in the process."
” Tony’s mood and tone took quickly a turn when he was now suggestively whispering in Steve’s ear. “We could say your wish is my command...”
"Well, I think I've told you everything I could, and I wouldn't begin to presume I know what kind of prejudice the Midgardians have for two men in a relationship," Thor said. "But, as a wise man once said, 'it's a decision'. And I'm rephrasing here, but if you want something else, and you aren't happy, and you might think you'd be more so with me, then you know where to find me."
“Well, no, I don’t!” Tony felt his fingers tighten around the spray now. “So why are you even suggesting that I am? Obi gives me everything. Money. Freedom. Attention. Much more than I’d deserve, and I find the… what?”
close?" Bruce's face was pure horror then, and understanding what he must have pictured, Thor could only laugh.
"And I was only mocking him, but he is a genius. He managed to use the Time-Stone correctly for the first time without effort..."
Then he just went through the motions and didn't let himself think. He didn't even have it in him to be a proper villain, it seemed. Not the acting deranged part - that was surprisingly easy - but how he was plagued with doubts.
So when all the online news were full of not even the news about the suit, but their relationship, Tony was just hoping Rhodey wouldn't be offended, but he shouldn't have worried.
"Maybe you never considered another man as a potential partner before me, and by then, it was too late," Bucky told him.
Not when Tony secretly programmed a "Levi Spa Day" routine into Dum-E's processes, and the cloak was having a gentle wash/massage while interacting with Tony's robots, while the "adults" were free to spend some time only the two of them.
Oh. Loki didn't expect that, but of course, he understood. He wouldn't date someone like himself either.
"But it also hurts you. There are a lot of people who don't believe someone could be so perfect and still so humble and sweet."
Tony was right, and it took more time to take off Bucky's arm properly, attach the new (every part had to be in place with a precision that wouldn't let water in), and then fine-tune every gesture. They were merely half-way through, maybe, when Barnes asked for the time, and it was already 5 am.
