He reaches out with one gleaming shoe and presses into Steve’s crotch, dragging the toe down the soft curve of his flaccid cock.
He’d forgotten what it was like, for pleasure to be… well, something
Orgasm takes him with a wordless cry, takes him over, a searing pleasure that tightens in his balls and spills through his cock, his release pulsing hot over Iron Man’s hand and Steve’s own chest. His rhythm falters; it’s all he can do to keep from collapsing, but it doesn’t seem to matter, because he can feel himself squeezing down around Iron Man’s cock and Iron Man is shouting and thrusting up and then he, too, is coming, warm and wet and perfect, buried deep inside.
Steve can’t help himself. He starts to laugh. It feels like the first time he’s laughed in a very long time.
“And so you’ve just— just
But Steve thinks he understands. “Like this?”
Doesn’t matter. Not relevant.
“I never…” Steve trails off. He’s hardly given any thought at all to what Iron Man is like inside—or, he supposes,
“I wasn’t lying,” he says, because it’s important that Iron Man understand. “About it never having been an issue in the field. But it’s not— Not what you’re saying.”
He digs a thumb into the crease of his thigh, briefly allowing himself to imagine other hands gripping him there, squeezing tight. It’ll be good, being with Iron Man like this, now that he’s himself again. Good, yeah—parting his ankles ever so slightly so his balls settle more comfortably between his thighs—to come together as equals, partners in their mutual pursuit of pleasure. Good to be able to do for Iron Man some small part of what Iron Man has done for him. He thinks Iron Man will like that; in fact, he’s damn well going to make sure of it.
knows, and he’s come here to— What? Take Tony to task? Read him a sermon about right and wrong and the greater good? Anger flares within him, like light refracted through a lens, blazing and focused and many-hued. As if Rogers has the right, after everything he’s done.
Then, the memory curdling in Steve’s own desire, his voice takes on a suggestive tone it surely never had in life:
You flex your feet, testing the tension of the sheets—dart your tongue out to taste your lips.
He lets his hands roam over his own chest and imagines it’s Iron Man’s he’s touching. Imagines the way Iron Man would gasp and quiver and moan. At being touched. At being
The paper is thick and unlined—apparently torn from the pages of one of Steve’s sketchbooks, just as the pen must have been borrowed from his desk. He wonders—smoothing out the creases on the page—where Iron Man learned to use a fountain pen. Maybe it was something he had to pick up, in the course of his work for Tony Stark?
You’ve always tried to be a generous lover, to give your partners what they’ve wanted of you, but this—this enforced passivity—makes it all worse somehow. More tawdry. Despicable. You shove the thought out of your head before it can take root, but you can still
He finds himself reaching—as he still does sometimes, when Tony manages to nudge up against what remains of his pride—for his anger. He remembers what it felt like the first time he came here, not so long ago—the rage blazing like a fire in his chest, lighting his path, making all things clear. But Steve’s anger was for the man who was his comrade, his friend. For the man who betrayed him. For a man who no longer exists.
thanks to the wonderful and many-talented Serinah for the beta!
He… he
“N-no doctor,” Steve forces out.
Steve Rogers is a rock, but the future is a tide, and a rock can cut through the tide but it can’t stop it. Not ever.
The hand on his cock withdraws. There’s a liquid sound, and then Iron Man is parting Steve’s cheeks, baring him, and Steve wonders if it’s possible to die of anticipation.
Tony turns, blindly, shoving himself off the desk, not knowing where he’s going except for ‘away.’
Iron Man doesn’t sit, not at first. He stares down at Steve for long enough to make Steve uncomfortable, before turning and walking a few paces away. He stops, then pivots abruptly, hand coming to rest on the back of Thor’s vacated seat.
“I’m just asking because Mr. Stark…”
“Cap!” he exclaims. “What happened? Are you okay?”
“Cap, you’re a
That’s what he tells himself in the wake of his first round, except that thinking about how it didn’t mean anything to jack off to Tony means he’s thinking about
a together.” It’s as if another force entirely has seized control of your mouth, the words flooding out as from a dam unstoppered. “That’s the whole point. The thing that’s coming? It’s going to break us, Steve, break us right in two, and by the time it happens, you won’t even care.” And it must be true that you can’t control this, because surely you would never have spoken the next words aloud of your own volition, the heart-caught whisper of them: “You’re going to hate me.”
You don’t think about the future; you don’t think about responsibility. It is the best, most exquisitely selfish thing you have ever done and it is so, so easy. Like flicking a switch. All you have to do is reach inside yourself and turn off the light.
Steve nods indulgently, because he’s pretty sure he could have figured it out himself, but it kind of seems like Iron Man needs this. Anyway, it’s kind of nice to be taken care of, even if he doesn’t need it.
after all, and if that didn’t show how skewed his judgement was…
So now your Argonauts, the one-and-a-quarter-billion dollar global defense system you’ve spent the past six weeks of your life perfecting, are on a rampage and you’re racing from hotspot to hotspot across the globe thinking you might actually be kind of a lousy futurist, because you really should have seen this coming.
His eyes slide from you to the suitcase lying open on the bed.
A shock of recognition goes through him. Iron Man’s note. He… never really got a chance to look at it, did he? Too eager for answers to properly examine their vehicle. Well. No harm in taking a look now, is there?
Or, no, probably he wouldn’t have. But Iron Man certainly doesn’t smell like someone who hasn’t washed his chest in months. Anyway, no one could wear something like that all the time, large and inflexible as it is—no matter how well-fitted, it would chafe beyond bearing—
No, Steve isn’t going there. Not for as long as he can help it.
Rogers makes an odd, throaty sound, but when Tony glances over at him, he’s staring determinedly down at his hands.
Steve can’t help himself: he shudders, a wracking, full body thing. His lips shape a plea, or maybe a prayer; even he isn’t certain which.
Rogers hesitates, then tilts his head in acknowledgement. “I understand.”
A sudden desperation rises within you, bubbling up through the fading bliss of orgasm. “Let me?” you ask, and it’s clumsy—too vulnerable, too
Wasp and Tony are both looking at him, eyes wide and startled.
next time: this story continues to earn its unofficial title, "Running With Boners," as Steve continues his trend of angstily popping chubs and then running away. also, there's like, plot development or w/e
“Tony—”
don’t think he’d mind. You know he has an entire collection of vintage Captain America memorabilia? Childhood crush doesn’t even begin to cover—”
“I know part of you likes this. At least this way, you’re useful. It’s been a long time since you were last useful, hasn’t it?”
It’s so stupid—such a goddamn cliché, but you never thought you were
Once upon a time you awoke in a cave and dreamed you could be better than you were, but to Sal, Iron Man is just a man in a metal suit. Wrestling monsters and punching dragons—a child’s dream of how to build a better world.
“Sorry,” Iron Man says, tinny through the modulator, and a little rougher than Steve is used to hearing.
He can feel his mouth moving to shape the words, and he knows them to be true, but they feel at the same time distant from him, like sparks thrown up by the fire currently consuming him, mind and body. And the more he burns, the more the emptiness inside him grows…
“It was… before, when I first smelled it, I was thinking… and then you came out in that— Looking like—” Steve swallowed. “And I…”
Tony was standing in the doorway to the bathing room. There was a towel slung low about his waist, leaving what looked like acres of toned olive skin on full display. There was no mistaking Tony’s body for a woman’s, not with that beard, or the downing of dark hair across his pecs, or that darker trail leading down from his navel to beneath the towel…
“Earlier,” he begins.
Iron Man’s voice is flat, utterly without inflection. He might as easily be the robot Steve had first taken him for, in the submarine all those months before.
The tingle in Steve’s belly increases. He adds a few more strips of bacon to his plate and Tony’s conspiratorial glance gives way to one of reproach.
and the awareness of it… It isn’t right—isn’t fair: you’re just data now. Ones and zeros shouldn’t be able to feel like this, sandpapered raw with possibility.
Forgotten—if he’d ever known it in the first place.
!” Iron Man says, sounding genuinely distressed. “I would never— You’ve got to believe me, Cap, I would never,
So he took care of it, the way soldiers took care of such things, discreetly, whenever he could. It was difficult, the constant, unceasing simmer of lust, rising to a boil at little more than a glance, or a thought, or a smile. It was difficult, and a little bit maddening, but he was already pretty well accustomed to dealing with the hunger and the exhaustion and the discomfort and the fear, and it wasn’t the worst thing, he thought, watching the brightness fade from the young soldiers’ eyes as they marched past the burnt-out husks of farmhouses through churned up fields of mud and blood, it wasn’t the worst thing in the world to have to deal with. At least it reminded him he was alive.
He says as much.
“In that case,” you say, rounding on him, “there are only two choices. There’s one side, and there’s the other, and we’ve already established that that’s not going to
“I really do need to go.”
He stifles a yawn and blinks into the unexpected glow of morning light. A second realization clenches in his chest—he’s no longer wearing his blindfold. It must’ve come off some time during the night.
“Shouldn’t be more than a couple of days. A week at absolute most.”
Time grinds to a halt as strong fingers close around his upper arm, arresting him midfall.
How—?”
“That okay?” Iron Man asks. “You okay to try—”
Steve lets out a sob of relief. There are tears pricking at the corners of his eyes.
She rides you with a focused ferocity, her knees locked like a vice around your hips. They might have left bruises a month ago, back when your skin was still something that could be marked or marred. You raise your hands to her waist and she bats them away.
Even after he’s come, drooling spunk all over his hand as he pictures
(He wonders how much better it would be if Tony—)
“Only in the armor,” Iron Man shoots back. “Technically.”
Steve doesn’t answer.
“This isn’t a fucking pay-per-view. You want some live action to ogle, I’m sure there are plenty of cam girls out there who would be happy for your attention. FRIDAY can hook you up. FRIDAY, can you set up Mr. I Fought the Law over here with some more appropriate viewing material?”
It’s two months ago. You have seen the future, its ugly, sneering face, and the future has beaten the ever-loving shit out of you.
Tony cocks his head bemusedly.
Steve freezes. There’s a strange feeling in his abdomen, as if his heart and stomach had suddenly flipped places.
Steve pulls a face and Iron Man chuckles again, reaching over to drag his nails lightly down Steve’s forearm, a caress with the merest suggestion of bite to it. Steve shivers.
Tony’s hands aren’t shaking.
“It’s time-sensitive,” Rogers confirms. He
“You on your knees is a good start.”
The confession seems to hang in the air, defiant of gravity. You feel oddly light, distant and floaty. Not relief. Shock, maybe.
He can hear, distantly, a series of clinks and clunks that must be the sound of Iron Man undressing, but without Iron Man’s voice, without the anchor of his touch the sounds are so distant from him they might as well be a memory or a dream. Steve’s balls are tight, his cock aching. He needs to be touched, needs it like a fish needs water—like he used to need air, only he thinks now maybe he needs this more. Why is no one touching him?
(yeah i had to change the projected length sorry not sorry but also kinda sorry. honestly if this happens again i'm going to start running out of chapter titles. but at least next chapter featuring the long-awaited return of Tony Stark? sure been a while since we've seen him, huh? wonder what he's been up to? probably something relaxing. i bet he's doing great 😎)
“There wasn’t a single civilian casualty in today’s attack, you know that? Not one.”
(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Steve feels the effects almost immediately. Over the weeks and months, he’s grown used to the feeling of Extremis, both like and unlike the serum in the way it takes him over, sinks into the core of his body and makes it something new. The serum hurt, but that was the pain of growth—of development and blossoming and becoming. Extremis never hurts. Instead, it infiltrates him like a virus: overwrites his cells, erases what it finds and leaves itself in its place.
“I can certainly smell something,” Tony hedged. “It reminds me a bit of jasmine. In fact, it reminds me quite a lot of jasmine. Unmistakably, even.”
“Oh god. I’m sorry. That was such an awkward— Forget I asked. Really. I was just, you know. Concerned.”
Like it was nothing more than a transaction. Like they were strangers to each other. Strangers, or less than—a stranger, at least, might have been moved by kindness. Compassion sitting in for affection, for genuine care.
“It’s Tony,” Steve says—mumbles it, really, into his chest.
“—barely said a word all meeting, and all this on top of yesterday’s fight—”
. He decides in the end that the risk of running into one of the other Avengers at the gym is too high, but passes a few pleasant, mindless hours doing calisthenics on his floor instead. It’s not easy for him to get a good workout with bodyweight exercises alone, but sheer persistence allows him to work up a decent sweat.
“Ready?”
You hear her huff out a breath. “Jesus, Tony, I know that. Everyone knows that.”
“Oh, hell,” Iron Man says. “That doesn’t sound… I’m going to call Don, okay? Just hang in there, Winghead, it’ll—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Touch me,” Steve rasps.
“You’re leaking like a fountain,” Iron Man informs him, and Steve can feel shame spiraling up within him, chased fast by anger, before Iron Man adds, fervent as a prayer: “It’s just about the hottest thing I’ve ever seen in my life. God, what I wouldn’t give for a taste—”
Only at the very last moment can you bring yourself to pull away.
Unbounded.
. Enough would be…
It’s less than a day before that, and you’re sitting in your mentor’s kitchen, drinking his shitty, home-pressed apple juice and listening to all the ways you’ve disappointed him.
The fingers don’t let go.
“Hey, no.” Iron Man hurries towards him, boots clunking softly on the carpeted floor. “I’ve got you. Lift your head?”
“I’ve seen it,” you say, with a simplicity that is as close as you dare come to kindness. “I’m a futurist; that’s what I do. And I know what we’ll be fighting over and I know
He lets his head slump forward.
“Give me that,” Iron Man says, wrestling the pillow away from Steve. Laughing, Steve lets him.
Steve could really use someone to laugh with.
“Thanks,” he says again, and starts for the door.
“Yes.”
“Well, to be honest, I’d largely put that down to
“Are you breaking up with me?” he asks, and his voice is wet.
Rogers sighs. “Tony…”
Given the choice, though, he’d really have preferred different circumstances.
Steve stiffens.
? As if Steve wouldn’t have found one by now, if it existed—as if he wouldn’t have jumped on the chance—
Steve’s shoulders give an involuntary twitch. With a grimace that he hopes very much isn’t visible on his face, he turns back to his voluble comrade, just in time to hear him boom:
influence.”
“More,” is all Steve says. His tongue feels heavy in his mouth. The slow, crackling friction as Iron Man moves inside him blunts his wits, sets his nerves buzzing with energy. He’s so close to what he’s been seeking, close and getting closer by the moment. The image pushes its way to the forefront of his consciousness, a dark-haired figure leaning in over him, the clench and shift of his muscles as he moves. He thinks of hips pistoning, hard and fast and relentless, Tony using him to take what he needs—what they
Below you, you can hear Luke starting up. He hasn’t exactly proven much of a team player—seems to chafe in the role of rank-and-file Avenger, questioning the hierarchy at every turn. Right now he’s accusing you of being a glory hound, as if— as if you’ve ever— as if you want anything from this except to
That’s his first mistake.
Rebelliously, he scribbles in a full beard, but it looks wrong, imposed and out of place, like Arthur’s wearing some kind of cheap Halloween costume. And even beneath the beard he can see—how could he have missed it before, when that’s so clearly Tony’s mouth, wide and full lipped on the bottom…
Thing is, now he’s started trying to imagine Iron Man, it’s a little hard to stop.
Except he’s not wearing the armor, is he, soft and weak and helpless as a crab without a shell.
I wasn’t going to turn you in. You think— What, your get-out-of-jail-free card is user-locked? For your exclusive use? Because I’m just champing at the bit to lock up the rest of my ex-colleagues? Seriously, fuck you.”
Steve grimaces. “Just ask,” he says.
Steve smashes his fist down and feels the tiled floor shatter on impact. The fractured porcelain grates against his knuckles and he knows that when he withdraws his hand, he’ll find blood among the wreckage.
You’d known for some time that war was coming when you realized you’d be its villain. It hurts, now, to think how naïve you were. How you stood, stranded in an age out of legend, looking out over a sea of mud and horses and tattered standards flapping in the wind, and saw another battlefield; how you watched it all unfurl before you—saw with a certainty that surpassed prophecy the fractured ranks, the friends-turned-foes, the unforgiving lines of Steve’s face as he bore down on you like you were a stranger, or less than—and still somehow let yourself believe that, just this once, there wouldn’t
Ah, yes, and there’s the anger again. To think he’d almost lost it.
“Steve, are you there?”
“Please, I—”
“If you think you should.”
that. It was the smart call, the responsible call—not to risk his position and influence, not to jeopardize all the good he could do by getting himself tangled up in Rogers and all his—his
A rapping at the door, sharp and urgent. It pierces through the haze even as the voice continues, the crackling of kindling resolving into the familiar static of Iron Man’s modulator.
Steve feels a stab of irritation. Here he is, most of the way hard and still covered in his own filth, and Iron Man’s talking about a
Despite yourself, you feel a twinge of pity. You remember what it was like, to face this truth for the first time.
So here we are, aggressively canon-compliant up to the end of CACW and then to hell with canon, we’re gonna solve this shit.
A sudden, sharp burst of pressure on the left side of his face. Steve gasps wetly and blinks back startled tears.
He picks up the note, handling it with care, like it’s evidence in some kind of case. Like it’s something to be solved.
Fortunately, the serum gave him a few advantages where wooing was concerned. Apparently it didn’t matter if you were awkward with the ladies when you were engineered to the pinnacle of human perfection.
“Didn’t call you here,” he pants, “so you could give it to me
“No,” he says again, more calmly. “It— It’s good for me. The fighting. It helps keep my mind off things. And it’s never been a problem before. During the war, I mean. Hitler didn’t exactly leave room for sick days.”
And it must matter, you know it must, but standing there before the withering force of Maya’s apathy with your own guilt wrapped around you like the opposite of armor, you can’t seem to think of the words for
Steve nods and tilts back his head, opening his eyes to stare up at the ceiling. He takes a steadying breath.
“No!”
For one, long, agonizing moment, Iron Man doesn’t reply. Then:
You steel yourself. Tighten your abs, as if that could quell the writhing in your gut. Turn onto your side and wait for your eyes to adjust, for the familiar features to coalesce out of the dark.
“At least three that we could see.”
Maya fucks like she’s got something to prove.
Thanks to Serinah for the beta! <3
It helps to imagine that, a little.
next time: Iron Man makes Steve an offer he can't refuse. Yes, it's probably exactly what you're thinking. Slow burn? I don't know her.
Steve sucks in a great gasp of air at the idea—the image of Iron Man approaching his boss like some kind of—of
Now that... That one stings.
He rubs a hand over his face, dragging it around behind to clutch the back of his neck. “I see,” he says, voice as neutral as he can make it. Really—glancing down to where his dick hangs limply between his thighs—it’s probably for the best.
Steve feels a brief pulse of guilt, followed an instant later by an even stronger pulse of… something else. He resists the urge to adjust his pants.
Right now, Steve reads tension in Iron Man’s clasped hands, his upright posture, the subtle tilt of his head. By the looks of it, Iron Man is almost as eager for this meeting to be over as Steve is himself.
What’s the matter with him? He doesn’t want this—doesn’t want these fantasies coming into his head and mixing him up. Tony is his friend. It feels strange to think about him like this, and not in a good way. It feels intrusive. It feels
you spit.
“Well, it’s not like it happened in a vacuum, did it?” you say, fighting to keep the tremors from your voice. “Things have been going downhill for months. You told me I was like a stranger to you, do you remember that? For god’s sake, you wouldn’t even
Tony drags his hands through his hair and spins in place, a reeling circle of frustration. “Well, I would hope not, but then, I never imagined you’d be insane enough to come here in the first place, so clearly my judgement isn’t a reliable metric!”
“You mean you were… thinking about
The punch he delivers is a work of kinetic beauty. Steve can feel his mouth drop open at the sight of it, the smoothness and power, the way the light of the sun catches the armor and sets it to blazing. Rostro flies backwards through the air and Iron Man follows, like a fire-bird streaking flame across the sky.
Tony’s sneer is a carved-marble masterpiece—all the semblance of flesh with none of its frailties.
A memory: Steve’s arms folded, his mouth a thin and unrelenting line, his body angled away from you like you carried something contagious.
,” he says, voice crackling like a hearth fire, “
“No, no, don’t go, I need—”
“Probably not,” Giant Man says. Steve shoots him a withering glare.
“Because I’m just saying, I may not be a genius myself, but I’ve got one on speed-dial, and I’m sure he—”
Steve’s fingers tighten on the door jam, causing the wood to groan ominously. Steve relaxes his grip, praying that Iron Man hadn’t noticed, and that whatever he has to say can be dealt with quickly.
Kinks in the training regimen.
Not that he thinks Iron Man would have said yes, between his desire for secrecy—Steve can’t say he finds the idea of being blindfolded in the shower particularly pleasant—and the armor he refused to—couldn’t?—remove.
A fraction of a second’s pause.
“Helped,” Iron Man echoes. “Sure.”
“Oh, hell. I didn’t realize. You— You really don’t have to do this, you know. You can back out any time, no harm no foul—”
No, far more likely that Iron Man kept it on for Steve’s benefit—that there’s something there he wanted to hide. Some kind of scarring, maybe. Something distinctive. Identifying. He finds, strangely, that he likes the thought. Not, of course, that he wants his friend to be scarred—of course he doesn’t—but just. The idea of it. Iron Man’s life printed on his skin in a way Steve’s can never be, not since the serum. The idea of Iron Man being—being
“Winghead?” Iron Man parrots back. The mattress shifts as he pushes you up. “Anyway, not to be crude, but I think the evidence of just how much I liked it is gonna leak right out of you and ruin these sheets if we leave it much longer. I’ll be back in a moment.”
(Iron Man said there was no shame.)
Steve notices for the first time how cool the night air is without another body to warm him. “You don’t have to.”
Iron Man exhales on a laugh. “Do your worst.”
Not just the fall.
“I think there is,” Steve says simply, and takes a step forward.
He doesn’t know what he’ll do if Iron Man says yes.
He shifts on the bed, parting his thighs, half reclining back against the pillows.
He already knew Iron Man was big—has weighed the heft of him in hand, has taken his girth into his mouth but this… This seems to operate on a different scale altogether. Iron Man is barely in him to the head and it’s already
done that before, not in all the time I’ve known you. We all have off days, but you don’t have to be a genius to spot the pattern here. Something’s up.”
The corner of Rogers’ mouth hitches upwards. “Still. Shouldn’t be an issue for much longer. Carnelia’s been in talks for a while, hasn’t it? And now that they’ve seen the benefits of having a superhero on call…”
Steve realized he’d come to a halt in front of the tapestry which hid the door to the bathing room. He cocked his ears, straining for the sound of movement from within.
Normally, Steve takes Iron Man’s flirting in the spirit it’s intended—a bit of light-hearted banter between friends, but now it grates against his over-sensitized nerves. He needs to end this conversation
Tony leans back again, resisting the urge to cross his legs. “Well, I’ll tell the maids not to bother making up the sofa bed then.”
“Not live, no.”

He huffs out a laugh. “Who gives a flying fuck what I believe these days? Belief is
Steve shakes his head, clutching at his hair. “You said you wouldn’t— You
Next time: Steve gets what he's asking for. But probably not in the way you're expecting.
“Not for the moment. I’ve still got some bagels to eat though, if you want to help, or… no, stupid of me—you can’t really eat bagels, can you?”
“Wow. You really like this, huh?”
you think, something turning over in your chest. For a moment you think it’s your heart, but your heart is as supranaturally hale as the rest of you and,
Steve smiles. “Sounds like a good start.”
“Yeah,” he says, heartbreakingly soft, “yeah. If that’s what you need, I can—I can give you that.”
“Actually…” He clears his throat. “That’s the other reason I called. I wanted to let you know that things seem to have, uh. Run their course. With my. You know.”
,” sounding almost lost, which wasn’t right because surely one of them had to know what they were doing here.
“S’not contagious,” he manages.
Spots dance across his vision. He blinks them away. His mouth is dry; his chest heaves with every breath. The storm in his mind rips his defenses away like they’re made of paper. He knows the name of that storm now, recognizes its lash, the bitterness of ice in its sting. It’s not anger after all, although he can see how he made the mistake.
Tony’s just decided that the best way to deal with this, under the circumstances, is to ignore it, when Rogers continues.
“You want to?” Iron Man echoes. He sounds faintly incredulous, and at the same time—and this can’t be right, but—at the same time, almost wistful.
“Sure,” Tony says, slowly. “You want me to call him for you?”
He reaches down to take himself in hand, and that feels right, that feels good, to be touching himself with Tony’s—no, not Tony’s, Iron Man’s—with Iron Man’s cock in his mouth.
Iron Man clucks his tongue and trails his hand down Steve’s neck and across his chest, seeming to linger just for a moment over Steve’s left pectoral. Then he begins to pull away.
“Three—” and Steve squeezes hard just as something presses upwards into the stretch of skin behind his balls and his world falls apart in a burst of pleasure that sets the sky ablaze.
Somewhere, there’s a soft, electronic chime.
Thanks to Serinah for the beta!
Steve subsides. He should’ve known there would be no avoidance here. Only endurance.
to tell. It’d never seriously occurred to him before, to confide his secret to someone else. Not before the onset of this terrible cycle.
Howard’s voice taunts in his ears.
“What was it like?” Steve is asking.
(Not before Iron Man…)
(See the end of the chapter for
you think again, and all at once you feel so damn weary, so
Steve raked his hands through his hair, hunching over with a little groan of frustration. What was the matter with him today? Was he really that susceptible—that, that
There follows a very brief tug-of-war over Iron Man’s dick, which ends with Iron Man pulling out of Steve’s mouth just as he comes, liberally splattering Steve’s face, chest, and, in all likelihood, the carpet beneath him with warm ejaculate.
not to tell.”
it’s a lie. You’ve seen it, nearly every night now, the moment you close your eyes and even creeping into your waking hours: the cold rage in Steve’s eyes, the cut-glass curl to his lip. He’s halfway there already without even realizing it; he’s
“Of course. It’s you.”
“That wasn’t an invit— Just. Shut up.” Tony rubs his hands over his face. “So this is a thing. I’m harboring an internationally-wanted fugitive while he waits for his ride to show. That’s just great. Really fantastic.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Well.
Steve can feel himself flushing, angry heat creeping up the back of his neck.
.” Steve makes another grab and this time manages to secure Iron Man’s upper arm. His palms are slick with sweat but he just holds on all the tighter. Iron Man’s muscles bunch as he shifts forward and Steve whines as the image of Tony kneeling over him enters his mind, the way his biceps would shift and cord as he braced himself, driving into Steve hard and fast—
Except…
You’re still blinking hex codes from your eyes, which is probably why you don’t give much thought to the knock that sounds twice at your door.
The first time he comes with Tony’s name on his lips is excusable. He tries, generally speaking, not to fantasize too much about people he knows personally—it’s always seemed somehow like a violation. But it was, after all, Tony who was the unwitting trigger, and the need always comes on him so fast when it first comes, and so it was really only natural, by the time he reached his room, achingly hard, almost trembling with desire, that his few scattered thoughts before he came, shatteringly, over his hand and stomach, were all of Tony.
He isn’t sure quite where the desire comes from, a desire that is not like the desire he’s known, something fierce and hot and dreadful, but a quiet, gentle ache. He wants the intimacy of it, two bodies aligned, pressing closer, the soft tangle of limbs and tongues and lips. The thought occurs to him that if he kisses Iron Man, he’ll be able to taste himself in Iron Man’s mouth, and that thought does send a pulse of heat through him, but that’s not what this is about. He can’t even say, in this limp, floating state of post-coital bliss, that he wants to kiss Tony.
And now you know, you
But he’s thinking back to all those urgent texts, all those ruthlessly screened calls.
“You’re messing with me, aren’t you? This is you, messing with me.”
“Just you and me,” Iron Man echoes. “Yeah. That does sound nice. Fun.” Beneath the gentle teasing lies a wistfulness so profound that Steve knows what he’s going to say before he says it.
“Oh,” Steve says, feeling vaguely ashamed. “That’s right. No touching your face, you said. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have asked.”
“You think to best me?
“Maybe not.”
This is the heart of you now, this bleak, black solitude, the sucking maelstrom of loss and shame contained within your chest, your body a perfect, untouchable prison for your all too flawed, all too touchable soul. For a moment, you indulge yourself with a fantasy—of letting yourself fall into that abyss. What it would be like to give up. Give in. To

Except that it’s stopped now, hasn’t it? He’s hardly a hero, benched as he is—gathering dust, irrelevant,
Now, with Iron Man’s secrets seeming to buzz and thicken in the air, it’s starting to feel pretty darn relevant.
Steve’s eyes flick down to the bottom of the note. Iron Man has scribbled something there—presumably his initials. But from the careless way he’s written his letters, the M a collection of loose bisecting strokes practically on top of the I, it could almost as easily be a row of Xs. That’s a shorthand Steve remembers from his own day—kisses enclosed for a sweetheart, far across the sea.
“I’m glad you—” Steve tries. “If we’re going to do this it’s… I
“Yeah?” Iron Man asks.
Ah, yes.
The groan Iron Man gives at these words sounds like it was ripped out of him, but Steve is only half listening. Something awful has just occurred to him.
Iron Man groans. “Of course he has a clone army. It’s just that kind of day.”
Iron Man laughs aloud, fierce and joyous, soaring past Steve in a rush of red and gold.
“Couldn’t sleep?” he asks with wry sympathy.
“You don’t understand.” Iron Man’s voice is like broken glass—perilously fractured, jagged and brittle—but his hands are back on Steve’s body, massaging the cheeks of his ass, spreading him apart once again and Steve is so close to what he’s seeking he can practically taste it, his need a tight and heavy weight in his balls, on his tongue. “There are
Iron Man is sitting bolt upright, palms flat on the table. “Are you all right?” It’s hard to tell through the vocal distortion, but Steve thinks he sounds a little hoarse. “It’s not— It’s still working, right?”
Steve slammed the wardrobe shut with a violence that would have sent any normal door off its hinges.
Sorry for the wait guys, this chapter ended up being… way, way more challenging than anticipated. Hopefully in some small part worth it though? It could probably use some more editing tbh, but I just didn't want to delay any longer. If anyone is still reading this old thing, drop me a line and let me know what you think!
“You offered Loki a drink.”
Steve shakes his head in frustration. Doesn’t Iron Man understand that that’s precisely why he can’t say
“I can’t see anything,” he says, almost marveling at it. The serum has improved his night vision along with the rest of his senses, made him far more sensitive to light. He can scarcely remember the last time he knew a darkness so absolute.
“Don’t move!”
need. He feels half-drunk on the very thought.
Take a step backwards. What next?
Steve tells him to shut up. Which feels good, a little, though it doesn’t do much to soothe the chafed-skin burn where your recent quarrel has rubbed you raw.
Steve gives in. “Yeah,” he says. “Couldn’t sleep.”
Or maybe it’s
“I just thought it would be nice,” he says, amending with a wince at the bloodlessness of ‘nice,’ “fun. Making time together, without all the… complications. You know. Figured we could show each other a good time. Just you and me.”
“You’ve done a lot for me. I’d like to do something for you. I think I’d enjoy that,” Steve adds, cutting off Iron Man’s half-formed protests. “I think you would too.” He licks his lips in what he hopes comes across as invitation rather than nerves. “If you don’t want to, that’s fine, but it’s something I’d really… Yeah.”
“Absolutely not.”
He takes in a breath.
“It shouldn’t.” Frustration leaks in around the edges of your voice. What you’ve done—it’s unforgivable. How can he not understand that?
He stands at the side of the bed, staring down at Iron Man’s note one last time, brushing his thumb over the signature that is and is not a kiss.
You find your would-be victim in Belgravia, ripping through firewalls like so much wet paper. Karim Mahwash Najeeb, former terrorist, current keynote speaker at the Stark Industries Global Peace Summit, and presumed target of the black hat who’s been hacking your nervous system. It would take less than nothing to kill him right now, a whisper of a thought. You’re lucky your hijacker has a taste for the dramatic; it’s a public execution they want, not a swift and mundane slaughter.

Steve knew, vaguely, that Iron Man was still wearing his chest plate, but knowing is different from feeling the evidence cold against his skin. Iron Man must have been very careful so far to position himself so that Steve couldn’t feel it. The realization strikes Steve as sad in a way he can’t quite define.
Steve turns his head into his shoulder again. “Where would I go?” he mumbles.
Tony stabs two accusatory fingers at him. “The intel—”
Just a thought—)
“Not,” he rasps.
Tony wonders if he was ever that unsullied.
This is how it starts, after all.
“How could I not be?” Iron Man returns lightly. “Here I’ll be, nose back to the grindstone, and there you’ll be…”
Then he says, clear and so, so calm, “Enough for what, Tony?”
“Tony,” Rogers says, in what he probably thinks is a soothing tone of voice, “it’s all right—”
He feels heat shimmering just beneath his surface, a heat that has nothing to do with the steam curling and coalescing in the air around him, and everything to do with the memory of the sharp, bright tone of metal, the tang of sweat. The darker undertone of musk.
“I’ve made it seven months so far,” Rogers points out. “Wouldn’t do to break the streak.”
A shadow of a smile flickers across his disgustingly perfect face. It makes Tony kind of want to die. A murder-suicide, that’s what it’s going to be.
“Who else would I trust, if not you?”
“I know your principles and I know what you believe in and I know you will always, always do what you think is right.” You breathe in deep, hoping against hope that, whatever he’ll think of you in the days to come, just now, just in this moment (and maybe, years in the future, looking back over dust and ashes long since settled) he’ll understand. “And I have to do the same.”
Steve nods, still not trusting himself to answer directly. “Do you mind if I…?” His fingers hover over the fastening of his jeans.
His finger taps theatrically at the empty air.
God, this is hard for him—so agonizingly, unbearably hard. You’ve seen this man deliver impromptu speeches that could rally an army on the brink of desertion, and here he is, sputtering out false starts like they’re being cut out of him, like every word has a price paid in blood. He’s torturing himself, trying to make things right between you, and there’s no

Iron Man’s hand falls away.

Also, jsyk this coming update is the last batch of completely prewritten material, so updates after that will be a bit more sporadic.
“Tony—”
“Everything I heard about you as a kid was a lie,” Iron Man informs him. “You’re a menace to society. You oughta be clapped up in jail.”
Genially, Sal unspools the accomplishments of your life and shows them to be small. You were supposed to be road testing the future, he says. Why aren’t you running the table, he says. You can barely look at yourself in the mirror, can you, Tony? he says. He tells you there’s a dam across your life.
“Th-that’s not the problem.”
Rogers hesitates, then slowly retakes his seat on the couch.
that’s good, you’re so good at this, Steve,
It’s never meant anything before.
like it was before. But…” He pauses. Draws in a breath. Licks his lips. Savors the idea of Iron Man on the other end of the line, his current task forgotten, hanging on Steve’s words. “I’d sure like the chance to show you how grateful I am for everything you’ve done for me.”
Steve turns around so he’s straddling Iron Man now. Iron Man’s got one hand on his ass, supporting him, and the other trailing heat up and down his spine.
“No, you just thought you’d swing by and hurl my sins in my face, and then we’d, what? Sit down and have a picnic?”
Maya’s eyebrows lift. You’re staring. With a muttered apology, you step aside. You try to summon up a smile, some small sliver of your much-vaunted charm. She just nods in return, like you’re distant colleagues passing in the hallway at some conference. And then you’re stepping back and the door is swinging shut in your face and you’re alone in the sullen silence of the aftermath.
He took another drink of his coffee to give himself a chance to think of what to say. "You probably noticed that I was really drunk last night," he went on, still talking a mile a minute so that Steve didn't have a chance to interrupt.
"Jesus," Tony groaned. "JARVIS, if I die tonight, make sure everyone knows to blame Captain Cocktease here."
"It's really not," Tony said firmly. "It's better than 'Rum and Coca-Cola,' but it's still a terrible song."
"Sort of," Tony said. "And I'd rather avoid them, especially at events like this."
"You liked that, huh?"
Tony rolled his eyes. "Oh, for Pete's sake." He pulled his hand back and started typing on his phone again.
"Going for coffee?" Clint said. "Mind if I tag along? I need a caffeine fix."
"I wasn't sure," Steve said. "You were complaining, like you didn't know exactly how to get me to do whatever you want."
, this incredibly awkward conversation has been leading up to me telling you that no matter how much we get on one another's nerves a lot of the time, I'm…" He hesitated. "Let's start with 'attracted to you,' and see where we go from there."
Even after Steve had demonstrated that he understood a lot more about science than Tony gave him credit for, they'd never been able to talk like that.
Tony smiled. "Great. Mind if I come with you?"
Now Steve didn't look angry. He looked tired, just like he'd said. "All right," he said. "I guess I owe you that much." He got up, crossing the room to join Tony on the couch.
"We both want to help," Tony said, when Steve was silent. "I'm not the one for inspiring speeches unless they're about engineering, but I'm great at writing checks."
"JARVIS, I thought I told you to keep everybody out of the lab?"
“Would it make it better or worse if I told you that you’d started cuddling?”
"But you're right. Didn't want to see you all dressed up, looking gorgeous, when..." He shrugged. "'S no big deal, usually. 'M Tony Stark. I can find someone else. But you..."
But the way Tony kept grinning at him, with equal parts amusement and heat behind it, called for a change of plans.
Tony Stark was a playboy and a cynic. He shouldn't want to carry reminders with him that at least occasionally, the best man he knew thought Tony was worthy of his attention.
Steve listened as Tony ran through the same explanation that Sam had given him, but at least they were all certain that they could bring Tony back without bringing Ultron with him.
"Or maybe I just want you in my bed," Tony said. "I've wanted that for a while, actually. I just--" He shook his head. "I couldn't ever be sure, with you, and I couldn't risk screwing things up. Which you have to admit, we're both good at doing, at least with each other."
Annoying, but fair.
Steve laughed, but he lowered his head to kiss Tony again as he went back to stroking their cocks. The friction of Tony's erection against his was almost overwhelming, and when Tony arched against him, shuddered, and came, Steve groaned. "Tony."
It sounded stupid, even in his head. He couldn't just tell Tony that he'd contacted him from another dimension just because he missed him.
"Of course I did," Steve said. "You're important to us."
"No, you didn't," Tony agreed. "You came back in the morning with breakfast."
"That's what I meant," Steve said. "I don't know why putting an end to our fake relationship is causing a problem, but it is." That wasn't entirely honest, but it wasn't a lie, either. Steve didn't know. He didn't even suspect. He just hoped.
Tony, who Steve… "Then I guess I'll start with 'I'm attracted to you, too.'" Everything else could wait a little longer. Not too long, because Steve had enough of waiting until things were too late before he said anything, but it was obviously too early for any grand declarations.
house; Steve had already done some redecorating to make it feel more like a shared place, because Tony didn't want to have to start again just when he'd got the garage exactly the way he liked it), the rest was going to the thrift store--but at that, he stopped and frowned.
"Like?"
"You know we have cameras now," Tony said. "Digital ones, even. Easy to carry around, huge storage capacity. No changing film, no darkrooms."
Clint frowned, his forehead wrinkling in thought. "Average? Maybe on the low end of average."
"We can't have that," he said, and quickly undressed.
Then, because Tony was giving him a strange, thoughtful look, like some of what Steve was thinking was showing on his face, he wadded up the paper from his straw and flicked it at Tony's nose.
Two days ago, they'd had the PR team tweet out the pictures Tony had taken of them, with their statements confirming that yes, Tony Stark and Steve Rogers were in a relationship and had been for quite some time.
So yes, they bickered, and yes, Steve canceled on dinner because SHIELD had a mission for him, and yes, Tony just plain forgot that they had plans at least once a week, and yes, if they had actually been a couple, the make-up sex would have been both regular and spectacular.
"I like 'landed.'"
He was mostly undressed: he was wearing his underwear, his socks, and the undershirt he'd chosen so that the arc reactor didn't glow too brightly through his tuxedo shirt. As he blinked enough that his eyes remembered how to focus, he could see that the rest of his clothes were folded neatly on a chair, with his shoes underneath it.
"Well," he said, once he could get his suddenly parched tongue to work, "I guess I could coddle you a bit."
"We can't just abandon you to another dimension forever."
Tony didn't seem inclined to say anything else; he gave JARVIS a few directions, set his phone down on the table, and started poking at a small holographic display projected from the device. Steve watched him for a moment, but then picked up his clipboard and got back to trying to phrase his mission report in such a way that he wouldn't get it back with some very pointed notes from Fury.
And then he would pull the sheet away and show Tony how Steve treated a cherished work of art.
But instead of Tony brushing him off, or just taking Steve's words as the kind of thing you say to comfort a friend without meaning anything much by them, he said, "So if you miss me, you'll do this again? I mean, I know we'll talk on a regular basis, it's not like you guys can function without my input, but like this. One on one."
Tony was handling this better than Steve was, which seemed backward. Tony was the one who'd been caught….
He’s not going to do it, of course, unless the mission goes badly wrong, but that doesn’t stop him wanting to.
Steve licked his lips, wishing he'd gotten himself a glass of water before contacting Tony tonight; his mouth was unexpectedly dry. "Me."
And when Tony asked him how anyone could not mind that, Steve wouldn’t be able to disagree. It was just that he was so very fond of Tony, and he’d put up with a night on the couch if it meant Tony got enough sleep, for once.
Tony shrugged. "This was about you. Believe it or not, I am capable of not upstaging somebody. And it's not like your right-wing fan club liked me anyway. I quit the weapons business, I have an education, I believe in science...."
Tony left his drink sitting on the bar and made his way to Steve's door. "JARVIS, tell him I'm here?"
Tony looked startled, and maybe a little pleased, but he didn't comment, and Steve didn't have anything else to add, so they let it drop.
"It worked," Tony said, "but I have some notes."
It doesn’t really look like Tony needs him at the moment.
A portal. The others were looking for them, and maybe they knew now that Steve and Tony were here and alive.
Steve looked down into Tony's eyes and blinked suddenly, before his mouth curved into a soft smile that Tony didn't think he'd ever seen directed at himself before. "
Captain America couldn't be impatient for a fight to end because there was someone at home waiting for him. That was the way to find himself making mistakes, and when he made mistakes, people died.
torturing himself. Tony genuinely enjoyed hanging out with Steve, getting the chance to talk to him as just a couple of guys drinking coffee instead of as Avengers. And when they went out for the coffee, they didn't even get interrupted, at least not by minor things like Hulk being angry about the lack of pizza bagels.
“Cuddling? Really? I’m not a cuddler.”
"Of course not," Tony said. "You don't have the technical skill. Even if you managed to program in the subroutines, it would probably end up humping your leg like a robot Great Dane."
From inside the room, Steve heard another wordless cry.
That was what Steve had realized; Tony was angry at him not because he'd been surprised by the revelation, but because they wouldn't be "dating" any longer.
But when he’s paying attention, Tony likes good food, and from the reactions of the other guests, the tarts are very good.
Steve let Tony change the subject, at least for the time being. It was good that they enjoyed one another's company, after all, and right now was not the time to rock the boat.
There were a lot more in that vein, and some that verged into 140 characters of pornography, but still, overwhelmingly positive, and it filled Steve with a warm glow to think that so many people would wish them well.
"Some. But I started a new sketchbook."
He waited until Tony was taking a drink before he said anything else, largely because it would let him get a whole sentence out before Tony could reply. "I can't stand cold water," he said. "Not to drink, that's obviously fine, but the hot water gave out in the shower the other day, and that night I kept dreaming about crashing into the ice."
"I wouldn't mind," he said, and stepped back to let Tony in.
"A light switch," Steve finished, unnecessarily.
Steve thought about the number of times that a press conference Tony gave had gone in an entirely different direction than anyone else was expecting, but decided that calling Tony a hypocrite wouldn't get them anywhere good.
"Curious about what?"
"Nothing too painful. No insults, no complaints, and the word 'please.'" He smiled at Tony, even though Tony was still facing the table and wouldn't be able to see it. "That's all."
"I don't need to take a picture," Steve said. "I'm not going to forget." He wasn't even going to dignify the idea that he might sell Tony's privacy to the press with a reply.
Clint’s text reads.
"No," Tony said quickly. "I'm okay. I promise, I'm fine, and even if I wasn't, this is the way things have to be. We can't risk Ultron ever getting free again. If that means I'm here for the long haul, it's what I have to do."
A few minutes later, the door opened, and like the last time, Tony came in and got into bed. He hesitated a little when he realized he wasn’t alone in the bed, but Steve whispered, “It’s okay, it’s just me.”
you. When you come home."
He doesn’t like undercover work at the best of times, and he likes it even less when his disguise is a box of dark-brown hair dye, a pair of what Clint called “hipster glasses,” and the white shirt and black pants that all the catering staff at this party are wearing.
"I'm trying to avoid someone," he said. It had the advantage of being the truth, even if Steve was clearly determined to be unavoidable.
' is a good song." He drew a wavy line down the center of his page, dividing the space into two separate scenes. In one, he continued using the cartoon style he'd adopted for these sketches, drawing himself, on his bed, sketching… himself, he supposed, like the infinite Quakers on the oatmeal box.
Under his palm, he felt the muscles of Tony's back tense. Steve bit his lip, wondering if he'd made a mistake.
Okay, it wasn't
"Sounds great," Tony agreed cheerfully. He let go of Steve's shirt with one hand, slipping his hand down so that he could rub Steve's cock through his pants. "We can do that later. More than once. In multiple positions. Until we both die of exhaustion."
"I apologize, sir. Captain Rogers utilized his override code, and while I tried to discourage him, he was most singleminded."
"I did," Steve said, his hand sliding down the length of Tony's spine.
He realized he was expecting them to be stuck here for a long time. If this had just been an unusually heavy storm, the work crew would still be here, or they'd be out in it, doing some kind of emergency response. But this place looked largely deserted; there wasn't any fresh food, even in what he'd worked out was the refrigerator, and while there were a few clothes in the lockers, there wasn't much sign of habitation.
"I mean when. The smartest man I've ever met is working on getting you back here. I have faith in him."
"Yeah, about that," Tony said quickly, because if he could just give them a reason to sweep this all under the rug, it would be fine, they could move past it. Steve obviously didn't hate him, or he wouldn't have made breakfast, so whatever appalling thing he'd done that Steve thought they needed to talk about couldn't have been unforgivable.
"Just 'spend several months of your life pretending to date me'?"
Tony tossed back the last of his drink and signaled to the bartender for another. "I," he said, maybe a little too loudly, "am having a great time."
Luckily for Steve, he'd just been linked with someone who didn't know the meaning of the phrase "completely private."
Tony examined the breakfast tray. Fried eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast. Definitely not health food, but Clint and Thor were right: if he could get this down, he'd feel better. Luckily, his hangover hadn't left him nauseated; he was even hungry.
"Tony, please," Tony said. "You're letting me put a picture of your adorable kid on the internet, the least I can do is let you call me by my first name. And, if you'll let me, send you the picture, before I blur her face." Then he paused. "Actually--Steve, you want to take her again? Let's give Mandy's moms a nice picture for her bedroom wall."
"Okay," Tony said. "Just kiss me again?"
"No," Steve said, doggedly chewing it. "It's not bitter. It's disgusting, though."
"Thanks for keeping me company," he said. "And for the total lack of help."
"What are you looking for?" Steve sounded infuriatingly calm. If he was about to give Tony a lecture about how they didn't need electricity or central heating or anything but a big stupid stick to protect themselves from things that looked like saber-toothed tigers with horns--
"Definitely not," Tony assured him. "If you'd been subtler, I would have told myself that you didn't mean anything by it, because people were different back in your day."
"That's what happened," Steve said. "You told me that you have, uh, feelings for me, and then we kissed, and then you passed out."
"Enough fun that you want to get coffee before we go home?"
He didn't always understand everything Tony said, but he always loved listening to Tony, watching the way Tony's hands were constantly in motion, the quick play of emotions on his face.
There were a lot of implausible scenarios, but Tony knew those were just daydreams. There were some things that not even he could have.
That was true. He'd loved Peggy, had hoped to make a life with her after the war.
And then, finally, Tony found words. "Hold on," he said, and Steve's hand stilled. "I'm getting close."
Tony came out of the bathroom a minute or so later, shaking his head. “I can’t believe I’ve been coming here to sleep,” he said, but he got into bed next to Steve all the same.
Steve broke off a small piece and put it into his mouth, grimacing almost instantly. "It's salted," he said. "And really sour."
He was never drinking that much again. Not even if Steve left him and he had to watch Steve from afar, being drooled over by most of Manhattan. Blacking out when you had access to multiple flying suits of armor was an even more terrible idea than Tony was willing to go along with, and he had an affinity for things other people thought were terrible ideas.
"No, we shouldn't," Tony said. "You should finish what you've started."
So while Tony kissed back, he also walked backward a bit, drawing Steve along with him until the backs of his knees bumped against one of the beds. "Take me to bed," Tony said, because he usually said, "Fuck me," and this time could, for once, be different.
"What the hell did you do that for?" Tony demanded. The paper had bounced off his face and landed in his coffee, and he grabbed a spoon to fish it out. "Are you insane? My God, I'm dating a lunatic. Not that it's the first time."
Truthfully, if someone told Steve that, "You can come back to the lab and help me test out those new earpieces I made for our field communicators," was a lascivious fantasy for Tony, he'd have a hard time coming up with a solid argument against it.
Steve didn't think Sam would have much trouble with that. Hulk wasn't any happier about abandoning Tony in Strange's pocket dimension than the rest of them were, and Bruce would be a lot more help in solving that problem than Hulk would.
That wasn't too difficult, because he did miss Tony.
"What is it, then?"
It definitely couldn't hurt, Steve thought, because that was the first time he'd heard of that particular program. That could just be because he didn't know everything about Tony's company, but he suspected that grant didn't exist, though it would by tomorrow morning.
That sounded good to Steve. "JARVIS, start the elevator again." He turned to Tony, grinning. "Now, tell me about these plans."
"Why are we talking about sheets right now?"
And then Steve said, "I'm sorry," again, but this time he followed it with, "I had no idea," before Tony could say anything, there was a big, callused hand cupping his jaw, a thumb stroking softly over his cheekbone.
To what end, Steve didn't know, but it couldn't hurt for his teammate to have a more accurate image of him, could it?
And usually, none of those things. Instead: fascinated, challenged, amused, intrigued. Nothing boring about that, or about Tony Stark.
"I don't think I love what that's implying." He grinned at Steve.
Tony was, for all intents and purposes, a million miles away, and that was much less of a good thing, but that was why Steve had contacted him, even though he didn't have anything important to say.
his unwelcome passenger--still seemed to be.
"A toaster, then," Tony said. Despite the conversation he was holding with JARVIS, he hadn't lost sight of what he'd been doing to Steve; Steve groaned a little and pushed forward against Tony's hand. "No, what I want you to do is to clear my calendar for today. And tomorrow; I think I'm going to need to sleep in. Do the same for Captain Rogers."
He heads in their direction with his refilled tray. As he gets closer, he can make out what Tony’s saying: “It was just so sad, you know? Hammer thought that without my armor, I’d be helpless. Like I need any help to outsmart Justin.”
"No."
"Does that mean I can have the sketchbooks?"
"I didn't say I couldn't do it. I said 'magic' is a broad category. Let's narrow it down some. Come up with a list of, say, five to ten things that magic-users have tried against us in the past. Not all from the same person. Even if it doesn't make logical sense to put those attacks together--as much as 'logic' and so-called 'magic' are compatible at all--we shouldn't be preparing to fight against a particular opponent, so we don't want to just copy someone's skill set."
"I'm serious about tomorrow," Tony said. "I get you for two days, no interruptions unless the world is ending."
He could have had JARVIS announce that he was there, but knocking felt more normal, and Tony wasn't any more likely to ignore a knock--or any less likely, either.
"Sounds plausible," Tony said, "and you're right, the closer to the truth it is, the easier it will be for us to remember the details."
"Nobody brings it up any more," he said. "I was with Pepper for a while, and I mostly date women, for a lot of reasons. But in the nineties, right after they changed the rules so that you could still get government security clearances even if you weren't straight, I had a pretty dramatic short-lived relationship with a guy. It made the papers. And I decided that if people asked, I'd answer. So when you asked me to help you--I figured you knew? It's in my SHIELD file, after all."
"When I said that," Steve said, "I had very definite plans of what I was going to do to you in that bed. You sure you're up for that now?"
"And," Clint said, shaking his head, "you're an idiot." He got to his feet. "And I've got a meeting with Maria Hill in about an hour, so I'd better get going."
Besides, it didn't matter what Steve saw now. They were going to die here, and compared to death, what was a little embarrassment?
"Have any suggestions for how we should make up for all that wasted time?"
That was fair, given that Tony had never recanted his "I am done with relationships forever" bullshit, even though nobody should ever listen to something that a recently-dumped, extremely drunk, person was saying about love.
"That's not true," Tony said quickly. "I have a very low threshold for boredom. I have a much higher tolerance for hearing the sound of my own voice, but I'm reaching the limit of that, too. So maybe you should tell me what you're doing?"
"We'll get better," Steve promised.
," Steve gasped, squeezing the base of his cock in an effort to bring himself back from the edge.
"Never," Steve said. He and Tony didn't always see eye to eye, and Steve could envision times when they left one another alone for a few days or a few weeks, until they resolved their differences, but he couldn't imagine ever deciding he didn't want Tony.
Steve's weight on top of Tony wasn't an unfamiliar sensation. That hadn't been what they did last night--last night Tony had buried himself in the glorious tight heat of Steve's perfect ass--but it happened often enough.
Tony shook his head. "People love a love story, Rhodey," he said breezily. "And Cap and I are going to give them one hell of a love story. It's going to be fine. It's going to be
And sure enough, Peter, MJ, and Ned were in the living room--Peter practically radiating cheerful helpfulness, Ned fidgeting uncomfortably, MJ looking just as bored as she'd sounded.
"Want a taste?"
The man was from the nineteen-forties, after all. He was kind and compassionate, but that probably meant that he thought queer people were poor unfortunate souls who couldn't help being like that, not that he was actually okay with knowing that one of his closest friends was bisexual.
So of course, when Steve spent nine days doing nothing but traveling and giving speeches, he was going to miss Tony.
"Yeah?" Tony said. "I'm not tired, Cap, and I don't have a bedtime."
"We could get some snow and pack it around the pan to cool it faster, if you really need water now," Tony suggested.
"Come on," he said. "You look like a man who needs pancakes."
Steve just hated having to say that, because in a perfect world, he'd have been able to give the PR team a better picture of him and Tony, and tell them to send it out with the same tags. Clint had explained "couple names" to him back when Tony and Pepper had still been together. "IronCaptain" wasn't great, but at least it didn't remind Steve of pizza.
"Not many, no." Steve looked down at his hand, pushing his fingers into Tony one last time and watching as they slid in easily past the second knuckle.
"I think about you," he said, which wasn't a direct answer, but it was still important. "After we talk, usually."
But then Tony let out a long, shaky exhalation. "Just me, huh?" he said. "I think I can live with that."
Ned dangled a set of keys in the air. "We can also make runs to the hardware store, or go for coffee, or whatever you guys need."
Of course, Steve had also figured that Tony would be only pretending to enjoy himself at the Pride festival, and clearly, that wasn't the case. He'd seen Tony pretending to enjoy himself before, and this wasn't it.
"Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas any more," he said.
"I'm getting a lot out of this," he said. "I keep telling you, I'm having fun."
"You mean, you could make a list of the ones you know about."
Tony and Tricia finished exchanging contact information--Steve knew that Tony had a phone number just for giving out in situations like this, one that JARVIS filtered for him, so at least he didn't have to worry that Tony would acquire a nuisance because he tried to be nice to Steve. And the fact that this was all in support of the act didn't mean that Steve couldn't appreciate it.
"Certainly, Captain."
"Just that I want to talk to you," Tony said. "It's not just 'having someone to talk to' that's keeping me sane, or at least no crazier than I ever was. It's being able to talk to you, specifically."
After all, he was still bisexual, and he still meant everything he'd said. Including every single word he'd said about being in love with Tony, for that matter.
And then, to Tony's surprise, Steve dragged one of the blankets off the next bunk and draped it over Tony before he left.
Steve frowned a little. "The opposite?"
"You're determined to be a jerk, aren't you?" Tony asked, but he was grinning back.
Maybe Steve had other plans in mind.
"Is this going somewhere?" Steve asked, because it felt like it was. It felt like it was going to a place where his heart was pounding in his chest, in a way it hadn't done since before the serum, though from a very different cause. He was surprised Tony couldn't hear it.
"Candles, oil lamp, anything that gives light."
"I guess I could do that for you," Steve said. "As a favor." He shifted his grip, knowing that Tony's cock was likely to be oversensitive at the moment, so that his hand was only wrapped around his own erection. "Especially since I really enjoyed the chance to watch you."
But he usually waited for Steve to come to him. It made him look less needy. Anyway, they'd never actually had sex in a situation where one of them couldn't walk away afterward. Awkward mornings-after weren't Tony's style, and they didn't seem to be Steve's, either.
"I have to be in DC this morning, remember?"
The endearment came as a surprise to Steve; if he'd thought about what Tony would be like in bed at all--and he had, so many times--he'd always thought Tony would have been… harsher, somehow. Not understanding. Not calling Steve things that brought color to his cheeks and pangs of longing to his chest.
Well, Steve pretty much always could find room for a snack, since the serum, and Tony never remembered to keep regular mealtimes. Steve cut two oranges into quarters and put them on a plate with a couple of the muffins, then filled his mug and Tony's. Balancing the plate carefully on his forearm, he carried it and their coffee back to the lounge.
, right?"
Steve had finished going through the list of mail forwarded to him by the publicists. He let the professionals handle the "We're sorry, but there's no room in Captain Rogers' schedule" emails, but some things required his personal attention, like the kid in Missouri who'd written to tell him how much it meant to him that Steve had decided to come out.
Tony shrugs. “Oh well,” he says. “Since you weren’t even a tiny bit jealous, I guess that’s not going to happen. It must not be my lucky night.”
The flicker of disappointment in Tony's eyes was so quick that Steve couldn't be completely certain that it had really been there.
Maybe he should have felt jealous, or even disgusted, but he couldn't. Tony could have anybody; Tony
Steve chuckled. "You kind of sounded like you did, right before we went through that..."
But that was definitely a groan, hoarse and ragged like it was being dragged out of Tony's throat. And it had to be Tony; if there'd been an intruder, and Tony had the upper hand to the point that his attacker was groaning in pain, he'd have had JARVIS sound the alarm.
Tony sounded a lot less enthusiastic than he had the last time Steve had brought up a new training sim. "I can give you a few minutes right after dinner, sure," he said.
"We're going to get you back in time," Steve promised.
Steve would have to thank Tony for that. He probably wasn't enjoying making small talk with a table full of public school teachers, but he talked about the Knicks, and rolled his eyes at Steve when Steve said, "Sorry, I'm a Nets fan. Once they moved to Brooklyn, I had no choice," in a way that looked affectionate even to Steve, who knew better.
,” he adds.
"This is absolutely about the Andrews Sisters."
"More cartoons of villains getting their well-earned comeuppance?"
"No," Steve admitted. "But clearly this was intended for people to use, and they presumably wouldn't see that well in total darkness either, so there's probably a light source just inside the entrance."
"It's getting kind of lonely here," Tony said, and Steve smiled.
Tony hadn't been nearly as calm and relaxed as he'd seemed, and only Steve's own embarrassment had kept him from seeing it before.
"I'd have asked one of the others to do this," Tony said, "but I wasn't sure if you'd said anything to them or not. There's a restaurant--I swear, you'll like it--I want you to make reservations at. The night I get back. Table for two," he added. "This is
"I don't want to talk to Sam," Tony said, which felt like a subject change at first, until he said, "Obviously, I want to talk to Sam. I want to figure out a way to get me out of here and leave Ultron behind, and Sam's more help on that front than you are."
Tony’s doing fine, his hand on his companion’s arm, long fingers stroking the fabric of the man’s sleeve, and Steve has to remind himself that he’s supposed to be serving food, not glaring at one of the guests.
Steve nodded. "There are some posters on the wall over there. I can't read them, but there are some pictures. I get the feeling this is some kind of base for a work crew, maybe?"
"But if you're publicly dating another man, you think that's going to drive them away."
"No need. The driver texted all of us, and unlike you, they check their phones." He pushed his chair back from the table and stood up.
Tony slid over, as close to the wall as he could get, and Steve joined him under the blanket, bringing the two smaller jars of water with him. "This is from the boiled supply," he said, holding one out for Tony.
Steve had rehearsed that phrase until the string of letters flowed naturally. To a man who had grown up in a time when the nicest way he heard people like him described was generally, "like that, you know," it took a little practice, but he did it.
Steve was even invited to Tony's lab to watch him work, and was able to fill page after page of his sketchbook with drawings of Tony with his robots, Tony in a welding apron and goggles, Tony rearranging holographic elements on a display with the flick of a hand.
"He didn't hire us, Mr. Stark!" a very perky voice called from the living room. "We just wanted to help!"
"You tell me, Cap. I don't see you having much of a social life."
"That's me," Tony said, breathing hard but still managing to sound unbelievably smug. "And I really want to see you come, but
The "someone else put him to bed" theory was backed up by the fact that he'd been lying on his stomach, with his head turned to one side. Sensible precaution when putting a drunk to bed, but Tony wouldn't have done it; the reactor was uncomfortable when he slept that way. It was also supported by the large glass of water and bottle of painkillers on his nightstand.
"I know I'm right," Tony said. "But you came back up here to bring me coffee and breakfast. That's not just what any concerned colleague would do; that's above and beyond. So you weren't mad at me then."
"I hope so," Tony said. "Sam's going to be working with some of the scientists from Stark Industries on that one. He said he's even going to try convincing Hulk to let Bruce come out to help."
And he wouldn't be in love with Tony Stark--Steve felt himself grinning against Tony's mouth at the thought--if he couldn't accept Tony's occasional distractedness, his tendency to get obsessed with his work, and everything else that seemed to go along with Tony's genius.
"I'll show you later," Steve promised.
If he'd been dating Tony, Steve would have kissed him right then, but there wasn't enough of an audience for him to be able to justify it, so he settled for smiling. "I'm okay with that."
Tony’s face was half-buried in the pillow, so even if his response was anything but nonsense, Steve couldn’t understand it.
He heard Steve's breath, drawn in sharply. "Tony," Steve said. "I'm sorry."
He kept his mind occupied that way until Steve came back, carrying one of the baskets from the storage shelves, not by the handle, but with both hands, carefully.
"I, uh. I think I can work with that."
But the shelter they'd found themselves in wasn't all that well-supplied. It was a log cabin, basically, about twelve feet square. There were some primitive-looking benches along the same wall that had the door in it, and what looked like the cover to a well in the center of the floor, and that seemed to be it.
"One, the kids' matchmaking worked out pretty well in the end," Steve said. "And two, I'm not matchmaking. I'm just providing opportunities for Thor and Bruce to interact. If they don't hit it off, they don't hit it off."
"Later, maybe," he repeated, and Tony grinned. That did sound promising. "But let's skip all the stage dressing and go straight to the point. We still should probably talk about what happened last night."
"It's like you can read my mind."
"Isn't this early even for you?" Tony asked when Steve came in.
They were going to have to get better at talking to one another, Steve realized, but maybe not right at this precise moment.
Which was almost everyone, and Hulk didn't need codes to get through a locked door.
If it were just a case of distracting him, Tony probably wouldn’t have wanted backup, but he’s also going to try to plant a bug on him, to find out who he calls when he discovers his stolen tech is gone, and that could get messy.
. Steve had been to space with the Avengers. How was that not a good part of the twenty-first century?
Steve, looking heart-stoppingly gorgeous in that damn tuxedo, was going to be the death of him.
Tony was cranky because when they'd stopped to get hot dogs, the guy running the cart had looked at Tony and said, "Aren't you--" but when Tony had interrupted him to say, "Iron Man, yes, I'd be happy to sign anything you want," he'd shaken his head and said, "No, sorry, I thought you were somebody famous."
"You can call me naive if you want," Steve said, "but I'll never understand why you do business with people you dislike so much you're trying to hide from them at a party."
"We did," Tony said, stepping up and putting one gauntleted hand on Steve's arm. "It didn't take."
"I was in the army, Tony. Just because I don't swear in public doesn't mean I don't know the words. Besides, you've assured me that we aren't in public now."
She smiled warmly at him. "A lot has changed since I was a kid, even," she said. "And a lot more will change by the time the kids today are our age. But it's going to take a lot of work, and I'm glad you've decided to help us with it."
They'd been sitting in those same spots for months, long before their pretend relationship had started; that hadn't affected anything in the tower.
People were going to notice that, Steve reminded himself. Even if it was under the table, people would notice, and it would make their act look more believable. Affectionate.
Instead, Steve just seemed to close down. He wasn't smiling, his ears were back to their normal color, and every spark of warmth in his expression had died out. "Yeah," he said. "That's probably the best way to handle it. And now that I see you're okay, I should probably get going. Training's at two; don't be late."
Then he shook his head. "I was in that position last night, or so I thought, and finding out--again, so I thought--that there was some woman you were so much in love with that it was making you miserable, and she didn't want you? I didn't want to leave you alone and miserable."
"And that's how I'd get you to beg," Tony said, smugly. "I don't think I can wait much longer, though. You sound too good."
a future, instead of just living in it.
"God, yes. I want to hear you come," Tony said.
He took a deep breath. "The food is good," he said. "The company is great." A little bit of a lie, since Tony was in show-off mode, but not too much of one. "This just really isn't my kind of place. I know it's yours, but..."
"Yes," Tony said, kissing him and then taking his hand to pull him toward the door. "But as long as I'm the only one you show your evil streak to, I think we're good."
"I'm Tony Stark," he said. "If anyone can do this--"
Tony chuckled. “Of all the ways I’ve been invited into someone’s bed, this one is unique.” Then, quickly, he added, “I’m aware that this isn’t the same kind of invitation, don’t worry.”
They'd kissed before. Technically. But even the one kiss that hadn't been for public display had been careful, controlled. Tame.
"Any time," Clint said breezily, and left.
(Steve knew he could have JARVIS order him another set of white sheets, or at least a replacement pillowcase, but it wasn't as if the lavender one was unusable. It just looked odd.)
When he'd found out how things had changed between his time and the twenty-first century, Steve had realized that it would be possible for him to be honest about himself. But he'd also quickly discovered that being Captain America, in the twenty-first century, meant that way too many people thought they had a right to all the details of his personal life.
"I can do detail," Tony said. "I mean, if you
Not to mention his almost-nightly talks with Steve, which had become an important part of Steve's day.
Tony was making that difficult, though, especially when their dinner plates were cleared and dessert was being served. He reached over and placed his hand on Steve's, where it was resting on Steve's knee under the table.
Tony's forehead furrowed a little, but then he said, "Right, okay, great. Anyway, thanks. I like doing this, but it was still good knowing I'd have a friendly face in the audience."
He could get used to this, Steve thought, and then realized that he already was.
They were only bruises. He got worse during team training. And they were a tangible reminder that Steve had been there.
Well, Tony would be glad to be free of this particular obligation, and Steve was sure there'd be plenty of women who'd be happy to heal Tony's supposedly broken heart.
Their next speaking engagement together was in late July, at a rally celebrating the second anniversary of the Marriage Equality Act in New York and campaigning for nationwide marriage equality.
This was actually happening, Steve realized, and felt as though all the awkwardness had drained out of him. There was no need for uncertainty, not any longer.
"The table's already clear," Steve said, "so we'll skip that part. But you've been working much too hard--" even if it had been on adding some very questionable functionality to the Iron Man armor-- "and I think it's time you took a break."
"This is amazing," he said. "The food's great, too. I'm pretty sure I don't deserve this, after last night, but I appreciate it."
Steve was hit by a sudden urge to paint that, with a judiciously-draped sheet keeping the portrait from being purely pornographic.
"I wouldn't clean wounds with it," Tony said, "but yeah, we can wash with it." He reached out for the sponge, but Steve pushed his hand aside.
“You didn’t hurt anything,” he said after a moment. “All you do is come in and go to sleep, and by the time I wake up in the morning, you're always gone. You don't even surprise me, at least not after the first time; JARVIS lets me know you're on your way.”
"You're a sap, Rogers," Tony said, but he kissed Steve back, because maybe so was he.
"I'm sorry," Steve said again, as Tony let himself be hustled out, but he wasn't sure if Tony heard him.
"Everything okay?"
"Sounds like a plan."
"I like you in one piece," Steve said. Hugging Tony when Tony was in the armor was... well, not completely out of the question, but left a lot to be desired. Instead, he cupped Tony's face with his hands, leaning in and kissing him until they were both breathless.
But that message via JARVIS had been a challenge Tony didn't intend to back down from. After what had happened between them in that shelter, Steve would know that Tony was just being a coward, and there was no way in hell he was letting Steve think that.
But Tony looked so pleased, like he really did want nothing more than to go for a walk with Steve, and Steve couldn't help but nod. "That'll be perfect."
Tony jerked away, and a glob of gel hit the floor instead of Tony's skin. "Cold!" he complained.
"Yes, I want to know what you were thinking about." Steve took a few steps closer, until there were only inches between them. "I'm really hoping it's along the same lines as what I was thinking when I saw you."
Steve suspected that once things advanced a little further, he wouldn't have a problem asking Tony for what he wanted. It still would have been easier if Tony were here in person, but he thought his self-consciousness would fade as he got caught up in the moment.
The questions weren't too bad. They were almost all about the breakup, and Steve just kept falling back on "It's very painful" and "We just weren't compatible," and refusing to give any specifics.
He couldn't make himself close his eyes, either, no matter how much he wished he could.
Tony laughed. "We sound like we're straight from the pages of some Victorian novel," he said. "I feel like I should be explaining that I'm a good prospect who can take care of you in the manner to which you're accustomed, and ask you about your dowry."
And Steve wanted it to be like this, didn't want Tony to turn to a programmed automaton when Steve was right here, aching to give Tony what he needed.
"Even then, though," he said, changing the subject a little before he depressed himself thinking about the best-case scenarios for his future if he hadn't been frozen for decades, "people had friends. You found people you could trust."
"You're not here, though." Steve would have expected that sex with Tony would be good, but Tony wasn't even on this planet. That had lowered his expectations considerably.
Which means that whatever they found, it's big enough that SHIELD wants to move on it now.
Instead, Steve settled for, "I had a great time tonight, Tony."
"You always do that," Tony said. Not always on his shoulders; it depended on exactly what they'd done. But Steve always clutched Tony to him just a little too tightly, and Tony never minded.
Tony wondered if there was something he could add to the reactor in his chest that would keep Steve at bay, along with the shrapnel.
doing it your way," Tony said, and then gasped, almost soundlessly, when the head of Steve's cock found his prostate.
"Oh, Tony. I'm sorry," Steve said quietly.
But if Steve didn't have them do any such thing...
Steve supposed that was fair. This
Steve was still trying to decide how to reply to that--no, it wasn't a hardship, but it was still a significant favor--when JARVIS cut in.
"Thanks," he told Tony. "It means a lot to me to have you there."
But maybe this was a sign that he could be Captain America, or he could be Steve Rogers, but he didn't get to be both.
Today, though, it seemed like the best way to go about it. It would be hard for Steve to avoid him if he didn't know that Tony was looking for him. So he got JARVIS to confirm that Steve was in his quarters, and then went straight there without giving Steve a heads-up first.
And if he was going to die anyway, if he didn't have to worry about awkwardness and team dynamics and the sheer torture of looking at Steve Rogers every day and feeling like a goddamn Smiths song every time (
Okay, yes, Tony had done that more than once. "Not on a date," he said. "Cross what's left of my heart."
Steve took a bite of apple to give himself a second to think of what to say. "I'm not nagging you," he said. "I'm curious. And maybe a little concerned. But in the end, you're an adult, and if you want to try surviving on caffeine and adrenaline, that's up to you."
"Open the door, JARVIS," Steve said, rattling off his override code.
Steve had left before the interview was over; he was waiting for Tony in the lab when Tony got back to the tower. Tony hadn't seemed surprised to see him there, but when Steve had tried again to both apologize and explain, he'd just said, "It had to end sometime, right, Cap? It's not a problem," and given Steve a smile so bright and sharp that looking at it was almost physically painful.
Steve considered for a moment. "We should keep it close to the truth," he said. "We became friends after the Chitauri invasion, so maybe we should let this fake relationship start there, too? The truth is that we learned to appreciate one another more during the battle, so we can just... build from that."
Steve didn't say anything, just touched the bruises again.
He took a tentative sip, and something must have showed on his face, because Tony frowned, setting down his own glass. "Is something wrong?"
(Good god, the things you’ve
Thousands of feet below, the countryside lies sprawled in an uneven patchwork of yellow and brown, shading to grey in the shadow of the waning afternoon.
Iron Man is speaking.
everything and all at once.
Here’s how it starts:
Steve lifts his hips again, beyond shame now. “
“Just throw it.”
“I know the girls would thank you, if they knew about you,” he says, and then, as Steve tenses, continuing in horrible, singsong reassurance: “They don’t, though, and I’m not going to tell them. You’re my filthy little secret.”
It never ceases to surprise you, how easily he can read you at times, because his face darkens then. Here, at last, is Steve’s anger, that tight bitter set around the corners of his mouth. You focus on that, and avoid looking at his eyes, the way they glitter, pink and raw with unshed tears.
The repulsors flare hot and hard.
A fantasy, nothing more.
The ghost of a smile flickers across his face. “Yeah, Mr. Money-bags, I know you do.”
Steve holds out the strip of cloth.
Steve wiped a hand viciously across his mouth, the other slamming out to catch the wall. What the hell was
He never wants it to end.
“Sorry,” Rogers says, “I— Sorry.” He moves back, a little, but he’s still too close, Tony can feel him, the heat and solid presence of him and so damn
When did he get so weak?
“And what if you thought wrong?” Steve’s voice is even, reasonable, like it’s a real question. Are you wrong in reading something harsher—edged—into the tilt of his head, his flat stare, the sideways draw of his mouth?
Steve swallows. He’s starting to entertain the possibility that something is seriously wrong.
a choice. Not for us.”
Iron Man barks out a laugh. “Right.”
“Maybe,” he says thickly, “maybe I like ‘a lot.’”
Rogers is watching him closely. “What do you know about where the Sons of the Great Bear are getting their weapons?”
, like air let out of a steam valve. “So, uh. What
“I liked it,” Steve says again, because Iron Man sounds like he could use the reassurance. “Like it when you’re you, too. But it was… I think it helped, at least a little.” A memory pops into his head: Tony in the kitchen, eyes blue-rimmed with fatigue but still smiling, still so willing to give Steve his time, to help him makes sense of things. “Tony was telling me a few weeks ago, actually. About what it’s called, when something isn’t real but still works, even if you know about it. It’s like that, I think. You and Tony. The placebo effect.”
“There’s a reason for that,” Rogers tells him, and his voice is so fucking
It’s a moment before you can find it in yourself to speak. All you can think is,
“Nnngh,” Steve agrees.
“That’s a little nicer, isn’t it,” Iron Man is saying, and Steve forces himself to smile, as if he wouldn’t have let Iron Man stuff his head into a burlap sack if that’s what it took.
if you were?). It’s a question of metadata. You know what happened. It’s the how and why that escape you.
Steve isn’t sure whether this makes him feel better or worse.
And that meant… If Steve was still feeling like this, so powerfully, about someone who was so obviously…
The sound of Rogers’ indrawn breath is very loud in the quiet room.
. Don’t think about it, don’t
,” he says, praying that Iron Man won’t make him articulate it further.
There’s an ache in his voice almost as keen as Steve’s own, and Steve doesn’t understand how that could be unless… Unless Steve’s finally asked too much. (Unless he finally
Steve wrinkles his nose. “Trying to butter me up?”
Steve blinks his eyes, as if that could dispel the force of breathtaking lust which had just slammed into him. Iron Man is asking him a question, but he can’t quite seem to parse—
Iron Man gives a breathy chuckle. “Yeah, I gathered.” He reaches over and flicks a thumb over the corner of Steve’s smile. Steve tries to turn his face into the touch but Iron Man’s already pulling away and Steve’s a little too lazy to pursue him.
Still, it’s a long time before the feeling fades.
But you have to say
“Jesus,” Iron Man says. “
“You don’t actually believe that, do you?” Rogers asks abruptly. “About the leader being more important than their team?”
—and now Yinsen’s son is lying dead on the pavement and you feel, for the first time, the Trojan executing in the back of your brain, overriding admin privileges, no write access—

good god, but Steve has got to stop thinking about Tony.
, because that has to be true—it
“Don’t be a stranger.”
,” Steve hisses. “Yes, that’s—” The pressure increases, and the heat is incredible, a mouthwatering pleasure just this side of pain. There’s a roaring in his ears and Steve is no longer quite sure if it’s the roaring of surf or the sound of his own pulse. “Oh. Oh, that feels… Like that, yeah, please,
Maybe it was that very night, when Steve’s body lay spent and sated and tangled with yours. You pulled him tight to you, feeling the arc of his smile where it curved against your chest, and let yourself imagine that to have was to hold, that everything you ever wanted could ever be yours to keep.
Except maybe…
Surprise wipes the furrows from Steve’s brow. “I could never hate you, Tony.”
Now there’s a note of confusion in Iron Man’s voice. “In the training regimen?”
“It’s fine,” Steve says, testing the words out and finding they’re true. “I… appreciate the concern, but I’m… managing.”
I do for you?”
Tony’s voice purred in his memory,
Unzips his fly…
Steve runs a hand across his left pec, as much to shut Iron Man up as anything, but his fingers catch on the puckered nub of his nipple, and he and Iron Man groan in concert.
fine, fuck you very much.” He jabs a finger in Rogers’ direction. “Someone really needs to sit you down and have a good long talk about boundaries.”
“You’re sure this is what you want?”
He comes back to himself when the last of the aftershocks are dying away. Steve is lying wrecked and boneless on the bed, chest heaving, skin prickling with sweat. “That was…” he begins, and stops, at a loss for words.
He maps out a tall frame, leanly muscular, overlays it in mail then sketches the lines of a loose tunic over top, covering the cuirass and heavier plate. A king first and a warrior second, that’s what Arthur should be. His pencil slips as he’s marking the outline of the king’s waving hair, leaving a dark smear of graphite. Steve decides to run with it. No reason why Arthur can’t have dark hair, right?
Tony whirls on him. “Rogers, so help me god—” He cuts himself short, feeling dangerously off-balance, and draws in a steadying breath.  “You try anything like this again and that’s it, you hear me? I
And it’s almost funny, really, because that’s when it hits you. Face-deep in the crotch of someone who is not your partner, smeared and sticky with her juices. That’s when you realize what you’ve done.
“Yeah?”
It’s a moment before Steve can force his mind to process the words.
It is almost, if he thinks about it, humiliating. That he allowed himself to imagine even for an instant that Rogers might’ve come here— That he might just have wanted—
There’s something in the way he says it, gentle but urging, like it matters…
He doesn’t have the stomach for this.
“I’ll be fine,” he says. “Help me up?”
for the first time since that night and somehow it’s all there, all of it, the beauty and the horror and the grief and the anger and the longing and the fear, because he doesn’t know how or when it happened but somehow that’s what Rogers is to him now, always,
“That… What you said earlier, about the aliens and the kidnapping and the—the pollen—”
Steve sucks in a breath as his cock gives a definite twitch.
Whatever the feeling is, it is rapidly eclipsed by gladness. Steve feels his cheeks stretch and his eyes crinkle in a beaming smile.
Luckily, he’s living in the future now, and the internet, he has been reliably informed, is for porn.
way. Maybe he knew them for some other reason. Maybe this isn’t the first time he’d been called on to acquire a discreet companion for the evening. Of course he’d know which agencies were reputable. He’d have to vet them himself, wouldn’t he, as Tony Stark’s bodyguard, if Tony—
Iron Man sighs. “No,” he says, more gently. “No, of course not. You’ve pulled my ass out of the fire more times than I can count. We’re not going to bench you for a single mistake. But—and I’m speaking from first-hand experience here—” He takes an audible breath, fingers tightening and then loosening on the back of Thor’s empty chair. “Personal problems stop being personal right at the point where they start affecting the team. That’s when you have to choose.”
Tony snorts and throws himself into a nearby armchair. “Of course you can’t.”
you are—”
Steve sags against the door, feeling feverish. His pulse is throbbing in his veins. It’s not the only thing that’s throbbing.
Steve lowers his arms in order to shoot Iron Man a look. What, does Iron Man want him to
of the images that immediately present themselves to Steve’s mind momentarily robs him of the ability to speak.
“Steve, wait.”
He extends his hand.
He takes a step closer, drawn by a pull he can’t seem to deny.
Winghead,
Iron Man’s gauntleted hands are strong enough to crush steel—Steve knows, he’s seen it happen—but you’d never guess it from the way he cradles Steve’s head, as if he’s holding something infinitely precious. A metallic thumb brushes over Steve’s cheekbone and then Steve feels the roughness of cotton wrapping around his head, over his closed eyes and the bridge of his nose.
“You’ll be the death of me yet,” he mutters. “C’mon, let’s go.”
Then the images start.

Steve scowls at his own clumsiness. “That’s not what I meant. Just, at the end, when we were… The things you were saying, it sounded like you were being— like you were pretending, again

To breathe, first, calm his racing heartbeat, in—and his nostrils were flooded with floral fragrance, almost cloying now in his over-sensitive state. When did it get that strong? How—?
Steve feels Iron Man settle behind him, moving forward on his knees until Steve is just inside the vee of his thighs. Iron Man’s legs exert a firm but gentle pressure against Steve’s hips. It feels nice. Comforting. Like he’s being held but not confined.
Iron Man’s fingers are careful and far, far too slow as he knots the blindfold into place. “Not too tight?”
he’s talking to, god,
Another memory:
Is Iron Man going to make him spell it out?
“Can’t wait to put me through my paces, huh?” Iron Man raises a gleaming metal bicep, gazing at it in joking admiration. At least, from his tone, it’s plainly supposed to be a joke, but Steve knows Iron Man about as well as he knows any man living, and he knows how proud Iron Man is of his armor. In Iron Man’s place, Steve isn’t sure he wouldn’t resent it, to be so constantly caged. But then, in many ways, Iron Man is a better man than him.
In that moment, you don’t even hesitate.
“I—” Iron Man begins, and stops, as if the question has thrown him.
Steve shakes his head.
He was right to do it, that’s the thing. He
Steve translates, as the hand withdraws.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He doesn’t— He isn’t— He’s a ladies’ man, he wouldn’t—”
He shifts his leg, rubbing gently upward and Iron Man sucks in a breath.
He redistributes his weight again, a seismic shift in the topography of Steve’s world. Steve startles and tenses as Tony’s hand falls heavily on the back of his head.
You called him a hypocrite and he let the door slam as he left, abandoned you for the badly-upholstered consolations of Sam’s living room couch.
—some sort of oblique reference to Steve himself? When a quick flip-through revealed that one of the main characters was actually living backwards in time, Steve had set the book aside and hadn’t looked at it again for months, certain it was some sort of joke—well meant, perhaps, but ultimately tasteless.
It’s all Steve can do not to emulate her.
that kind of kinks. Not
Steve turned.
Oh, we’re way past hope now, pal. We’re—”
But as the weeks rolled into months rolled into years, you found yourself watching Steve more and more. Or, not just Steve—sometimes it feels as if you’ve spent half your adult life with him in your sights—but the way people reacted to him. You saw the way the public looked at him in unjaded moments (even as those moments came less and less frequently), like he was George Washington and Lady Liberty and Santa Claus all rolled into one. You saw the way your fellow heroes turned to him, the way they drank him in, the steadiness of his words, the broad and gleaming truth of him. And you remembered how it felt when you found him on the ice, like the world had been made anew. Like anything could be possible.
He laughs, flat and utterly without mirth. “No, what am I saying, of course you brought me a weapon.”
is enough. How had he ever managed to find pleasure at his own hands? How—?
Iron Man is shorter than Steve—he said—but then, he’d still have the helmet on, wouldn’t he? So maybe, just for that moment he and Steve would be exactly the same height.
He wishes, for the first time in months, that they’d left him in the ice.
He wants very badly to say
Steve can feel himself trying to get hard again. He thinks maybe he wants to cry.
One more beat, one more chance Steve thought Tony would take to argue, but then Tony’s expression softened.
“Sure, why not, came this far.”
Steve’s mouth was ajar, but he couldn’t find words. He stepped into the room, shutting the door behind himself, and padded towards Tony as slowly as he could manage. The sight of him didn’t get any better with proximity.
Not to say what they were doing was no fun. It was. A beautiful blend of tension, satisfaction, and submission. He was bound at Steve's command, but Steve knew how to treat him just right.
Tony shuddered, but he didn’t struggle at all, which worried Steve more than anything else. He avoided Steve’s eyes by shutting his own as he answered in a whisper, “Barely.”
With that in mind, it wasn’t surprising that he woke easily at the sound of rapping on his door very early that Tuesday morning.
“Why are you really here?” Steve asked. “I know you’ve been getting threats.”
Steve was speechless. He’d never even considered that Tony would or could think like that.
Tony laughed and gave Steve a light splash. “You’d never.”
Tony strained against his bonds, but could only manage to tense up, his toes curling. As Steve began to move inside of him, he only grew more tense, groaning and salivating at the corners of his mouth. He had nothing to do be react as Steve set the pace.
Steve's breathing told Tony just how much he'd put into that one punch. He could hear just how labored it was as Steve leaned against Tony, could feel the sweat running down his front side.
“Please,” Tony begged, gasping for breath. “I don’t- Don’t leave me.”
Once Steve was done with the second round, he plugged Tony back up, but didn’t immediately resume punching this time. Instead, Tony heard him the clank of metal, maybe Steve settling down on some equipment. Then steady clanks, confirming Tony’s suspicion. Steve had never been one to skip leg day after all.
There went the bag. The reinforced bag that Tony had designed for him. Tony's cock twitched at the thought of the strength Steve must have packed to rupture the bag just like that. He wondered if that was exactly why Steve did it. A not-so-subtle reminder that he could do the same to him.
Tony really hoped that Steve would come back and tend to him sometime soon.
As he turned the knob, and pulled the door open, though, he found himself completely taken aback.
Even with Steve most likely being halfway across the room, his scent lingered on Tony, marking him as Steve’s turf. It was a scent of fresh sweat, certainly, but also something masculine, musky, and simply
Seemingly out of nowhere, Steve let out a roar that echoed through the room. It was followed immediately by a single, splitting
“No, no, you don’t,” Tony insisted, shaking his head. “No one should know, ever, what goes on in my head, I don’t want that on anyone else.”
“Tony.” Steve moved around to take Tony by his upper arms and force eye contact. “Have you slept?”
*****
Steve gave little bucks of his hips as it happened, but soon after, he started to go soft inside of Tony. Still, he didn’t pull out just yet, opting to keep his hold on Tony and pepper kisses up his shoulder, to his neck, to his cheeks. He pressed his nose to Tony’s and stopped there, murmuring sweet nothings.
No answer. Not even a grumble or any indication of annoyance. Just silence and what Steve dared to think was labored breathing.
“Tony, sweetheart, baby, Tony, love you, love that you let me do this to you…”
Tony was silent, not so much as lifting his head up to look at Steve.
“You don’t have to do this alone, Tony,” Steve murmured, letting his hand start to massage Tony’s shoulder, just gently. “I don’t know if I’m the right person to help you at all, but, keeping all of that in, it’s not good for anyone.”
Steve had heard more than enough to make a decision.
,” Tony hissed, pushing himself to his feet. He paced from the bed to the wall and back as he explained, “It’s Happy, there was an attack, I need to get the hell back.”
“Wouldn’t I?” Steve teased back. “Would it be such a bad thing?”
It was all so quiet and soft that Steve was barely aware of slipping away until the light of a late morning shone in his eyes. Steve instinctively moved to stretch, only to find a weight stifling his movement.
He glanced at Steve, only for a moment, something between fear and anger in his eyes. Then he ducked his head, hiding at against his knees and under his arms.
Slowly, the pieces that Steve had gathered about Tony came together in Steve’s mind.
. Steve soothed him throughout in soft murmurings, and Tony about lost his mind when he felt Steve’s cock pressing against his entrance, just sliding over it, the head catching the rim for a split second.
It was becoming clear to Steve that this might not have been something that he was equipped to handle. Sure, he’d worked with Tony and had an idea of who he was, but he didn’t know Tony like Tony’s actual friends did. This seemed like more of a job for someone who worked with Tony 24/7.
“Alright,” Tony said, barely even sounding alive anymore.
Or how much Steve wanted him. He was pounding into Tony, chasing a second orgasm, sweat dripping from him onto Tony’s skin. Tony’s body was his, and he was going to use it as he saw fit. Tony was definitely going to be sore, and he couldn’t have been happier.
Tony could have cried from it all, but he was too tired by that point. The only thing he could manage was the warm feeling that filled his chest. There wasn’t any place he’d have rather been than there in Steve’s arms.
“I’m not going anywhere,” Steve promised, putting an arm around him. “I’m here, Tony.”
Tony’s wrists were strung up over his head, his ankles not far away, spread out just enough to give Steve plenty of leeway for when he decided to take what was his without straining Tony. His eyes were covered with soft fabric, and a cloth gag stuffed in his mouth. He was as much the equivalent of a piece of exercise equipment as anything else in the room as he’d ever be.
“Yeah,” he said slowly, shutting the door behind Tony. “They’ve been a real help with everything. You want some water?”
Only when Steve placed him on the bed and made to move away did Tony protest, holding on to his arm as he started to turn away.
“So do you.”
Mercifully, the clanking stopped after only a few moments. He heard Steve get to his feet and take in a deep breath as he stretched. Again, Tony could practically see his muscles rippling.
“I’m not putting this on Bruce, and Fury- nope, no, that’s not a rabbit hole I want to deal with.”
*****
“Well, if it makes you feel better, I do feel less ready to break Fury’s face now.”
Steve’s heart lurched. If it wasn’t one thing, it was another. That much never seemed to change.
, Tony snarked in his head. Not to say he wasn't turned on by the display of strength.
“At least when you die redirecting a nuke, people remember you for something good.” Tony gritted his teeth, fighting back emotions. “Not just selfish, arrogant, merchant of death.”
“Yes, you can,” Steve broke in, firm and steady. “Take the bed. That’s an order.”
Yet, as he looked at Tony again, he’d raised his head a bit, listening with intent. Taking that as some kind of positive sign, Steve continued to let himself spill.
“So why are you here?” Steve pressed.
“I just- I didn’t want to be at home, and I guess Jarvis thought this was the next best place to be.”
Pound, pound, pound. That sound was his only point of reference for where Steve was or what he was doing. It was therapeutic in its own right. Tony didn’t need to think while he was like this, he couldn’t talk, couldn’t do anything at all. All he could do was listen and wait in the knowledge that Steve was there with him, and when he needed him, he’d
Finally,
“Rogers,” Tony said in kind. “Guess I shouldn’t be surprised.”
“Oh, you know. Gotta switch it up sometimes or I’d get stir crazy.”
Steve kissed him against the gag, breath tickling Tony’s cheek. He sure knew how to make a guy hung up like a piece of meat feel loved. With that in mind, Tony squirmed against Steve, whimpering for more contact.
Steve laughed, leaning in to kiss Tony on his jaw.
Tony was silent, even as his brow scrunched up like he wanted to argue. He always wanted to argue, used it as a defense mechanism even. Steve prepared himself to plant his feet and be more stubborn than Tony here, but, ultimately, it wasn’t necessary.
He gave a muffled cry as Steve pushed two thick fingers into him, feeling out exactly how sloppy he was and rubbing up against his prostate for good measure.
Steve couldn’t help but frown. He wasn’t sure why, but the way Tony had come to him and how he was now laying on Steve’s bed gave him a looming sense of loneliness. He wanted to do something about it, but didn’t want to do anything out of turn either. Tony was still a wild card, even if Steve liked to consider them friends.
Steve only got those words out before Tony broke in, his voice shaking.
Thinking of it that way, it was suddenly easier to understand. Tony had been through and seen a lot, both with Steve and without him. With that in mind, Steve crouched down to join Tony on the floor.
. He didn’t thrust too fast at first, but he went hard in long, full strokes, bottoming out every time. He used gravity alongside his own sheer strength to let Tony fall back down on his cock. Tony’s prostate was a straight shot each and every time, and it drew sounds that he hadn’t thought himself capable of. He was thankful for the gym’s soundproofing in that moment. Thankful even moreso when Steve slipped the ring off of his cock with a practiced ease.
“Why wouldn’t you want to be at home?”
“Feeling better?” Tony asked, smiling up at Steve.
“Yeah, you like that? You need more of that?”
Maybe it was his own fatigue, or he was just feeling bold, but with Tony seeming to fall back asleep, he carefully arranged Tony in his arms and stood up.
“It’s been in my head too,” Steve kept on. “How does something like that just- happen? That kinda thing, aliens coming down from the sky, it was never really real back when I was- well, when I was what I was. Now everything’s complicated and above us all, and what can we do, really? I’m still just a scrawny kid from Brooklyn who got lucky.”
And Steve set that pace
Tony appeared as relaxed as Steve felt, cheek still pressed up against Steve’s chest and jaw ajar. Steve couldn’t help a smile that crossed his face, nor his hand that wandered over to brush a stray lock of hair away from Tony’s face.
Steve wasn’t getting anywhere by being indirect, that much was obvious. As usual, he was the one who had to get to the point.
Belonging to Steve like that might have been the hottest thing Tony had ever experienced. Words couldn’t describe how much he wanted Steve, how much he loved the man.
“Sure, sure, that’s a word for it. You mind if I crash on your couch?”
He slowly turned the doorknob, giving Tony more than enough time to yell at Steve to go away. When he didn’t, Steve pushed his head in first, peering around the room. Sure enough, Tony was there, but the sight of him offered no relief. He was hunched down on the floor, shivering and backed up into a corner against the shower
“Oh, Tony,” Steve said. “Oh, God, I wish I’d known.”
Now and again, a shudder would pass through Tony, and, almost on reflex, Steve reached out and stroked down his back. In seconds, Tony would settle back down into an easy rest.
“I didn’t come to your house at four in the morning,” he pointed out.
All he could do right then, though, was reach out and put a hand on Tony’s upper arm, hoping that that would get the right message across. Tony tensed, only for him to take a breath and seemingly force himself to relax.
“No. That’s fine,” Steve said, still holding off on speaking his mind outright. “Just didn’t think you’d want to sleep on some grunt’s couch in Brooklyn over your place out in Malibu. Or the Tower.”
Tony took in a sharp breath as Steve started thrusting again, using more of his own strength as Tony remained stationary this time. Milking himself.
With a final breathy groan, Tony let himself relax again, his head tipping back. He only half-believed Steve. It wouldn’t have been the first time that he’d been made to wait, but Steve was horny too, probably even more so than Tony was. Hard enough to pound nails didn’t describe the half of it when Steve was particularly pent up.
Steve was grunting like a wild animal now, far louder than he’d normally be in bed. He seemed to be all around Tony, engulfing him as he made his claim. Tony yelped as teeth dug into his shoulder, no doubt leaving Steve’s mark there. His cock gave a valiant attempt to rise once more as Tony’s mind flashed to everyone being able to see that mark if he wore one of his tank tops. Steve’s silent way of saying “back the hell off, that’s
By the time that he felt the bed dip and a warm body slip under the sheets next to him, Tony was only vaguely conscious, just a hair’s breadth from sleep. He opened his eyes briefly when Steve’s soft grasp slung over his middle, but closed them soon after with a contented sigh.
The only times Steve had ever seen sheer terror this bad was back during the war. Guys who couldn’t take the shooting, the death, the bodies, the ones who went home alive, but never the same. Shell shock, or whatever the doctors liked to call it now.
“I don’t blame you there,” he offered with a shrug. “Just wouldn’t think I’d be the first pick as the safest place to be, when there’s Banner, or Fury, or anyone else.”
Steve got Tony clean and dry before carrying him up to their room. Whether there was a possibility of being seen in their state, Tony didn’t know, and he didn’t care either. Steve was there and everything was okay.
Tony gave a hollow laugh.
“We could have failed. You could have died.” He gritted his teeth against the thought. “God, Tony, I was terrified, you were up there and then you were laying there and I thought-”
“Does Pepper know you’re worried?” he tried.
After only a bit of talking, Steve realized that he was just airing some of his own worries and stopped himself. He was supposed to be the leader, the rock, the anchor everyone could turn to for assurance, and here he was, telling Tony how uncertain he felt at times.
It was amazing how steady Steve’s breath was, through both the exercise and fucking Tony within an inch of his life. All the way up until it started to grow ragged, a telltale sign Tony knew well. Steve was panting in his ear, almost growling, and his thrusts grew shallow and uneven. Tony didn’t think he’d ever heard or felt anything hotter. His jaw went slack, his head lolled to the side, and Tony vaguely felt his own cum splatter against his belly.
It wasn’t too bad, Steve mused despite himself. And Tony wasn’t bad to look at, especially not now, when his face had relaxed and his breathing evened out. It made Steve want to keep his eyes open just a little longer. Just a few minutes...
Mercifully, Steve did exactly that, gently untying Tony’s gag before lowering him and releasing his wrists and ankles. Never did Tony feel like he was about to fall, Steve’s grip keeping him steady every step of the way. As soon as his hands were free, they went right around Steve’s neck, his head resting against Steve’s chest. His eyes shut and he trusted that Steve would take them both where they needed to go.
“If you need anything-”
A buzz interrupted any further conversation between them, as Tony reached down to take out his phone. In the space of a second, Tony’s face morphed into one of hopeful optimism to abject horror.
“Haven’t slept that well in months,” Tony murmured at last.
“Can’t not go all out, seeing you like this,” Steve told him, rubbing hands up Tony’s biceps. “Imagine what I’d do if anyone else tried to touch you like I touch you.”
“What?” Tony balked at him. “Steve, this isn’t your-”
With that, the room was flooded with a mixture of Tony’s moaning and the constant slap of skin on skin. It seemed louder than it likely was with blood pumping in Tony’s ears, punctuated by Steve’s hot breath down his neck. Tony would have sworn that he was sweating more than Steve as he tolerated the strain and pleasure of it all.
“That’s the last thing on my mind,” Steve said, giving a short laugh. “I’d like that. Though, it’s not exactly easy when we live on opposite ends of the country.”
Steve did another double take. Tony shouldn’t be surprised? What was that supposed to mean?
A single sound rang over and over through the room. Hard flesh on hard canvas. Pound, pound, pound, on and on. It sent ripples of tension through the room, all radiating from the one making those sounds. Steve had some stress to work out, pent up from all the small things that weighed on his conscience throughout the week. Tony knew how pissed Steve could get if he was left to stew. Beating on a bag was the healthiest outlet for excess aggression he had.
They both laughed and smiled as they bantered lightly. Tony would have sworn he’d never felt as relaxed as he did in those moments.
Steve had always been a light sleeper. It was a necessity, growing up where there was always the possibility of a break-in, or worse. Not like he’d ever had much that would be worth stealing. Being in the army had only reinforced his tendency to stir at any noise. Waking up in the wee hours of the morning to move on an enemy’s point wasn’t that big of a transition.
Tony hummed, that thoughtful stare coming over him once more. “Let’s work on that.”
Tony stood staring at him, jaw ajar and at a loss for words. It seemed he was finally catching on that Steve wasn’t going to take no for an answer.
Finally, some kind of clarity. It was a roundabout way of telling the truth, but it fit into Tony’s persona. His facade, Steve was beginning to realize.
“I’m just going to clean up, Tony, won’t take long,” Steve promised him.
Making his point, Steve pressed a thumb against Tony’s sore, used hole, pushing some of the dripping cum back inside. Tony hissed, out of any energy to do much more.
But Steve didn’t pull out. In fact, Tony hadn’t felt him go soft at all. Tony had no time to realize what was going on before Steve snarled his frustration, and hiked Tony’s ass up so he could find a better angle. He wasn’t done.
The events of the early morning came back to him then. Tony at his door, Tony’s episode, comforting him, falling asleep with him. Despite everything, Steve found himself taking in an easy yawn as the room became clear around him, as well as the form next to him..
Tony trailed off, curling up even further into himself.
“Nice apartment. Roomy, right in the middle of Brooklyn, that’s nice. SHIELD set you up?”
Of course, it had to end sooner or later. They both needed cleaning up by the time Steve pulled away from Tony. Still, he prolonged things a bit further by first pulling Tony’s blindfold away.
“You doing some kind of experiment?”
“No, you didn’t.” Tony shuffled in place, evading Steve’s eyes and the subject at hand. “You look good. Bedhead, that’s a good look on you.”
Then the thought that was more than enough to send him over that edge; that Steve was there with him, needing him as much as Tony needed him.
Steve blinked, unsure of what Tony meant. “What?”
Steve arranged them so that Tony was half on top of Steve, keeping his arms around him. He didn’t want to pull any blankets over them both, not sure if that would make things between them awkward. This was about helping Tony calm down so he could sleep, that was all.
“So. Why are you really here?” Steve repeated.
long? Why hadn’t Tony said anything? Why hadn’t anyone noticed?
Tony glanced up at him again, in what looked like a glare. Steve frowned even deeper, but he could take a hint.
“I kind of hoped,” Tony said, voice firmer than it had been.
Steve rolled out of bed, ready to be asked by a neighbor to borrow detergent or flour, and made his way out into the living space and to the door. He half-expected it was the lady across from him, maybe asking for help with carrying laundry or- something. She found excuses to talk to him here and there. It was kind of nice, really, if a little intrusive when he was trying to sleep..
“No, something happened alright,” Tony said, relaxing a bit, but still watching Steve with intent.
“I kind of hoped that I wouldn’t get up,” Tony clarified, shrugging and looking away. “That I wouldn’t come back from that wormhole.”
“That’s in your head, huh?” Steve asked, under his breath.
He listened to the shower with his eyes shut, the water pounding against the linoleum and Steve’s skin. It was strange, how soothing the audio was after their session. How easy it was for Tony to be lulled into sleep by it, even without Steve’s warm presence.
So, all in all, while he’s not exactly thrilled by the return of his prodigal libido, it’s nothing he doesn’t know how to deal with.
You are ruining your life.
laugh at you. You do believe me, don’t you?”
There’s something he could do.
“What are you…?”
“You’re still a man under there,” he protests, feeling an odd pang of guilt.
Despite the hair, you don’t look anything like him. Not really. His brows are fair, his chin broad, his cheeks vital and firm. And his eyes—his eyes have never looked like that in his life, alight with the guilty panic of a hunter caught in their own trap.
And now he might lose that, all due to an out-of-control side-effect of the very procedure that had let him earn his place here in the first place. That wasn’t a choice. It might be a joke, if Steve could bring himself to laugh about it.
But Rogers is shaking his head. “I don’t think so. The blast radius was too small. Some kind of auto-destruct, we think.”
Iron Man sucks in a breath.
You were right. Already without realizing it they’re choosing sides. Falling into line. Defining themselves in opposition. To you.
“Mmm.” Steve flattens his palm against his stomach, rolls his hips a little. Pushes his palm down to smooth over his upper thigh. “I looked for you this morning.” Significance hangs off every word. “But you weren’t there.”
You may have noticed the estimated chapter count has changed. We have reached the end of the prepublished material and as such there will no longer be a regular update schedule; however, due to outline tweaks, the next chapter is completely written and will be up on Wednesday. It's a shortie, but a goodie, I hope.
“It wasn’t hard to work out. Not for anyone who knows—” Rogers shuts his mouth abruptly. A moment later, he resumes. “Nationalists bomb the largest refugee resettlement camp this side of the Caucathians, and a month later SI announces the opening of its new Eastern European headquarters? Strange location to choose, Carnelia. Even apart from the terrorism, the economy’s not exactly booming.”
,” Steve chokes out, and sags back into the mattress. It’s not enough.
“One—”
“No.” An all-encompassing denial.
“Indeed,” Thor says solemnly, and with what Steve, is his current state, finds to be almost maddening hypocrisy. “I am certain we all have things we must attend to. Fare thee well, comrades.”
It’s practically Pavlovian, the way just the mention of Tony’s name sends tiny flames licking through his belly. Inside the staunch, unyielding leather of his boots, his toes make a valiant effort to curl.
Tony, with his movie-star good looks and those ravines he has in place of cheeks, Tony with the charm in his smile and the warmth in his manner, with those clever hands and cleverer wit and the shadow in his eyes hinting that there was so much more to him than he ever let anyone see.
Tony’s face, which is still currently making sad-puppy “why are you eating all the bacon” eyes at Steve, undergoes an interesting transformation. His gaze drops, then darts back to Steve, lightning fast, a flush blooming slowly in his cheeks. His teeth drag over his bottom lip, color flooding in their wake.
He flips to a new page and glances around the room for inspiration. His eye falls on the book he’d just cast aside.
He tosses the phone onto the bed and rakes both hands through his hair, steepling his fingers behind his neck, leaning back into their hold.
“You’ve cut yourself shaving,” Tony says, softly, eyebrows still knit. “I wouldn’t have thought that was possible, not with your reflexes. Here, and—”
Steve turns back around at that. “You…?”
Tony had called it. Steve could think of a few choicer words of his own, most of which involved far fewer syllables.
Probably not couldn’t. Iron Man must be able to shower somehow. He certainly didn’t smell like someone for whom hygiene was an issue. He smelled… nice. Really nice, actually, now Steve comes to think of it.
Steve, god,” Iron Man groans as Steve grinds his hips onto Iron Man’s pelvis, feels Iron Man’s balls plump against his ass. “Just like—”
—good mood, good mood, he’s feeling
As if he knows, as if he has even the slightest idea—
“I’m doing good,” Steve tells him. “Really, really good. Better than I’ve felt in… well. A while, anyway.” He clears his throat. “I… just wanted to say I really appreciate—”
Either every conflict is made of heroes and villains, or none of them are. And for those who need to believe in heroes, well. Given the choice, you know which of you they’ll pick. You can’t even blame them.
“I don’t know what you’re—”
“I think you’ve outstayed your welcome.”
He remembers the urgency in Iron Man’s voice earlier, when he thought Steve needed him—remembers the almost palpable concern, and is struck again by a bewildering sense of discord. It just doesn’t add up, any of it.
“So that’s. Really great,” Iron Man concludes. “I mean. You must be so relieved.”
One tap is… is…
But the chest plate—that he kept on even to sleep. Because… he can’t take it off? Surely not. Surely Iron Man would have said…
. It was as if his body had been storing up every wayward impulse, every flicker of sexual interest, only for the floodgates to open all at once until Steve was all but drowning in it.
Tony cuts him off with a sharp gesture. “Nope. Bup bup bup. Zip it. Time to leave.”
The kind of person who cheats. Your flaws are manifold and varied, but you’ve never been disloyal. Never
You’re out of the shower and have just finished toweling yourself off when you hear a pounding on the bathroom door. Your heart turns over in your chest, but it’s only Maya.

Steve’s shoulders drop, mouth pulling in a helpless parody of physical pain. “God, Tony, I really thought—”
“Like hell it’s not.”
“You think I should be suspended.” His voice sounds thin to his own ears.
“It is.” Steve puts every ounce of certainty he has into the words. Apparently this has some effect, because Iron Man’s voice is a little brighter when he next speaks.
, Steve thinks. He can feel something catch alight within him, wonder kindling to desire like a flame to dry grass.
“I— You—” Iron Man stammers. “Jesus, Cap. Let’s just get you to the bathroom and get you cleaned off before you give me a heart attack.”
Wake up, Stark. Your future is calling.
Tony. That’s the whole problem.
“Yeah,” Iron Man confirms. “You already told me all about your cycle and Mr. Stark. If anything, it’s a compliment to my skill, that you’re already too distracted to filter your thoughts.”
From the long, controlled breath that crackles through the voice modulator, it’s clear that Iron Man doesn’t believe him, but all he says is, “Okay. Okay. I’m going now. Just—just call, if you need me. Anything I can do,
what is needed. Even if you have to burn everything you are to do it.
He hopes to god Rogers doesn’t force him to find out.
Something flickers across Rogers’ face and Tony knows he’s hit home. “It’s not about trust…”
Steve shakes his head because Iron Man is the one who doesn’t understand. “I need
Wasp's voice echoes plaintively down the corridor behind him.
Then Iron Man does the worst thing possible.
Something in his voice makes Steve pause to really consider the question.
“For god’s
“I, ah. Uh. Didn’t know that, no.” Iron Man sounds a little flustered now, and lord but that’s a heady feeling. To be the one making Iron Man squirm.
Iron Man had, in fact, given him the copy months before, when they were only just barely starting to become friends. Steve had been confused by the gift at the time—even a little suspicious, as he so often was in those early days. For Iron Man to lend him a book whose first volume had been published in the 1930s—did he think Steve couldn’t handle anything more modern? Was the title—
“Absolutely,” Steve lies.
And then his eyes flicked down, and Steve hurriedly stepped right to hide himself behind the back of the divan, but he was too tall, and anyway, it was too late. Tony had seen.
“Because I hope you know…” Iron Man shuffles his feet and clears his throat in a burst of static. “If you ever need to talk, I’m here. Doesn’t matter the reason.”
He leans across the table. Steve knows he must look half crazed, but Iron Man doesn’t seem to care, just slides a gauntleted hand across the tabletop so that it rests inches away from Steve’s own.
,” he chokes out.
“Not too tight?”
“I’m honored by your trust,” he says. The words are strangely formal, but somehow seem all the truer for it.
Which makes sense. It’s not like he’d really expected to. He’s never known Iron Man to use the kitchen except for social purposes, or to pour himself the occasional glass of water (complete with straw).
There’s a brief silence. “Probably not,” Iron Man says, still with that odd twist to his voice. “But my point is, I’m sure Mr. Stark would jump at the chance to, uh. Give you a hand.”
that. God, it’s shameful how badly he wants that, shameful the greed and intensity of his desire.
Behind him, Iron Man makes a pleased noise.
The wetness and the warmth and the pressure, the hot vacuum of Iron Man’s mouth, the teasing flick of his tongue against the underside of Steve’s head… Steve doesn’t have the vocabulary to describe the way it feels, as if Iron Man is teaching him a whole new language of sensation.
“What the hell?” Tony demands.
And—it’s like something clicks into place in your head, because suddenly you can see it, spooling out recklessly before you: another future. All of Steve’s stubbornness, his loyalty, his unyielding conviction turned not to some nebulous point of principle, but to
He rounded on the wardrobe. If he could just get one of those doors off, it might do for a makeshift shield. Sure the shape would be different, and the weight and the size and the balance, but all food is meat to a starving man. The hinges—that was where the door would be weakest. The fact that he couldn’t see any hinges was beside the point. The door was attached somehow, and however that was, Steve could break it.
He thinks there are a lot of things he could bear, with Iron Man touching him.
No, surely not.
Shellhead’s probably busy, anyway. Steve took up an awful lot of his time this morning after all. He can’t in good conscience ask for any more just on a whim.
"Definitely not," Tony said. "We're going to give the people a show like they've never seen before. Stark technology is going to bring a person through from another dimension, with pinpoint accuracy."
"I had no idea," Steve said. "I don't go around looking up people's life stories when I meet them."
That did nothing to relieve Steve's confusion, but before he could say anything, Tony was out the door.
"I am never going to understand why anyone would call himself 'Killer Shrike,'" Tony said, "but yeah, go on."
He'd just rather read a book than an article on the internet, so he saved the links Tony sent him for times when he was bored and didn't have anything else handy.
“Mr. Stark is sleepwalking, Captain.”
Steve grinned. "Well, I was too polite to mention it, but..."
Steve snorted. "Don't be such a baby," he said. "Somehow I doubt your mechanical… friend… warmed it up for you."
"You have an evil streak, don't you?" Tony asked, but he turned his head to look at Steve, and he was grinning too.
Right now, the world was under the impression that Steve wasn't single. Maybe he should continue to let them think that, at least until all the bigots had been driven away and none of them wanted to be even vaguely associated with Captain America any more.
Megan McLaren was still leaning toward him, still looking sympathetic. "I can only imagine," she said. "I mean... Tony Stark. I don't mean to belittle any of his accomplishments, and obviously, he's an Avenger, he's helped to save the world, but he's also been involved in a number of scandals."
He liked the way things were between them now. He thought a lot of it would last, even after they stopped pretending to be a couple. Steve would still go to the lab while Tony worked, if Tony let him. They'd still get coffee for one another, and they'd probably still go to some of the same events. Even the ones for marriage equality and LGBT rights, because they'd both made commitments.
The realization of Steve’s vulnerability seems to hit them both at the same time. Steve lets out a choked little sound of need, just as Iron Man asks, with some anxiety, “That okay?”
There’s a slight awkwardness—a tension that’s descended on the room and Steve isn’t sure where it came from.
The morning air is cool against his back. His shoulders tighten. He’s aware of a vague sense of unfamiliarity about the room, a spectral, amorphous presence. Or, no—not a presence. It’s the feeling when the light has shifted; everything is different and yet nothing has changed.
Steve lets out a garbled moan. His arms flex uselessly where Tony has bound them behind his back.
“Got it in one.” Tony turns around and raises the glass in a mocking salute. “Cheers,” he says, and drains the glass down to the very last drop.
“Right. Yeah, okay. We were talking about your—your t-tits, right?”
this bed, the very one Steve’s lying in now,
“I want you gone,” Tony says. He starts low, picking up volume and rapidity. “I want you out of here, out of this room, out of my life. What’s it gonna take, huh? How many ways can I say this? I am opting
so you open your mouth and you choke it back and you choke it back and you say, “Hey,” and don’t say, “handsome,” or “babe,” or “beloved,” or any one of the myriad easy endearments that are no longer yours to use, that will never be yours again.
“Oh,” he says, “yeah. I just… had a couple of ideas about some new training exercises I wanted to run by you.”
“It lasts for a week or two, and then it’s gone,” Steve says. “The thing is, I hadn’t, uh. For a while. Not since the ice. Except then, last week… I think the delay might have affected things a little, because it’s been… stronger. This time. Than it is usually.”
The last two words are underlined twice.
“Yes,
, sharp and raw and scraping. How can he be so tight and feel so empty? He pushes further in and is rewarded with more pain. He’s barely halfway to his knuckle and already it hurts so much. He thinks you’re supposed to use something, some kind of lubricant to make it easier but he doesn’t have anything like that and he needs this
The glow has faded a little bit by the time he’s washed, toweled, and dressed. Stepping back into the bedroom, he glances at the clock. A quarter past two.
Steve felt an overwhelming surge of relief—it wasn’t just him, he wasn’t alone—before he realized a very important difference.
And it’s not that you
“I have to go,” Steve says, yanking open the door, half-running, half-stumbling into the hall. He thinks maybe he hears Iron Man’s voice calling after him.
Thank you so, so much to everyone who's commented, new and old. You've kept this story burning like a flame for me, even when RL made writing impossible. I haven't always had spoons to respond, but please know that every comment is read and reread and loved and... You guys are just the bee's knees, the cat's pyjamas, the... penguin's Honda Civic? The point is you're great and ilu and I just wanted you to know ❤️
In the bathroom you splash yourself with water from the sink, let it trickle like sweat down your temples and the planes of your cheeks. A cheap simulation of normal biological functioning. The face that stares back at you from the mirror is a stranger’s: bottle-blond hair bleached to the point of breakage, dark stubble already casting an untidy shadow over the throat and jaw. A weak jaw, you think. A weak face. It looks like the face of someone who could fuck around on the love of their life.
“I don’t— I— I’ve just got a lot on my mind, I guess—not that that’s an excuse—and I know how— how
You don’t kiss much after the beginning, which is probably for the best. Your mouth is dry, sour and mucus-thick. Her mouth tastes like fire and woodsmoke. Tennessee’s finest. The taste of defeat.
Left Tony alone to shoulder the burdens of his own inadequacy, the lives slipping like sand through his fingers because no matter what he did, it wasn’t enough, he could never be
Boys, boys, whitefish and cream cheese and lox are BOTH acceptable bagel toppings. (what is fluff even? is it arguing about bagels? it is, right? genuinely I have no idea what's going on there. maybe I was hungry?) I'm just saying, though, love is knowing how the other person eats their bagel.
Anyway, fuck that.
You think he probably does know. Privacy is the relic of a fast dying world and Karim is, in his way, very much a futurist.
No, harder. That was it, really—
And it helps least of all that it’s Giant-Man’s turn to chair the meeting, and he seems perfectly content to allow Thor to rehash every minute detail of the battle at top volume and in the grand heroic style. All the more time for Giant-Man to make eyes at Wasp, Steve thinks sourly.
“Bet you I can,” Steve retorts, the faint glimmerings of a smile hovering about his lips.
Tony nearly drops the piece he’s holding. His hand flies to his left arm, rubbing at a phantom ache.
“I don’t think—” Steve’s mouth pulls to one side. “I mean, if that were true, wouldn’t I only be interested in women?”
“I— I can’t pretend I’m thrilled about… you and Maya
“…ah. Um. Okay, yeah. That’s… good. That it was good?”
yeah, just like that—or whatever’s the opposite of that.” A strange, twisty laugh. Then, very softly: “You look like my unjust reward.”
Steve—
Jesus. “Uh. No. I should be gone. Before.”
, you promised.”
“I—” Steve rasps.
“I heard you didn’t leave alone either,” Wasp adds, waggling her eyebrows salaciously.
.” Iron Man sounds half-wrecked himself. “You can’t keep going out in the field like this, you’re going to get yourself
“Hope?
“Sure,” he says, as casually as he can manage.
“There’s got to be a way— Maybe if you just found a partner, someone to work it off with. You said you didn’t used to… not alone, right? There are thousands—tens of thousands, hundreds, even—of people in New York alone who would be happy to— Hell, I know a few places in the Village, you’ll barely be able to get through the door without half a dozen Tony Stark lookalikes falling over themselves to take you home.”
Next time, in another thrilling installment of
Rogers goes still. Then he drops Tony’s arm as if he’s been burned.
“Now, I could’ve sworn I saw some robes in that wardrobe.”
He drags his lips in his fingers’ wake, up the inside of Iron Man’s thigh to the thatch of wiry hair where Iron Man’s leg meets his body.
It was real, after all.
You collapse yourself back into your body just as Maya squeezes down once more, but you must’ve fucked it up somewhere—come back too fast, or somehow wrong, because the sensation seems wan and distant to you, like something glimpsed at the far end of a long tunnel. You are in your body, but you can’t seem to remember how to inhabit it. Sensory data skims across your awareness like clouds reflected over the surface of a lake, transient, impossible to grab hold of, while at the same time at the forefront of your consciousness, the stolen image of the woman in Alberta stutters like a bad disk sector, glitching in eternal, prayerful truncation: “I lo— I lo— I  lo—”
“Cap,” Iron Man says, and there’s something terribly hesitant—tremulous—in his voice. “Cap, you— You have done this before?”
Tony is here as a private citizen.
“And when you’re with a partner?” There’s no trace of judgement or expectation in Iron Man’s voice. It sounds like a casual question, like this is a perfectly ordinary thing to discuss, and Steve supposes it is. Lord knows he’d heard far worse bandied about during the war. Maybe it would help to think of it like that. Just a little barracks talk between friends.
Iron Man pulls away. “Right,” he says, and takes a deep breath, like he’s rallying himself for something. “Let me slip into something a little more, uh… less.” The there’s nothing but the clinks and clinks and rustles of Iron Man undressing.
The rest just… never seemed relevant.
Beneath his hands, Steve’s cock gives a needy twitch, and he allows himself one moment of shame for involving his best friend in these sordid fantasies before—
Why should it?
Drawing was always his escape. Escape was something you were allowed when you were 4-F and not good for much more than dreaming. It’s not something you get when you’re a hero. A symbol. That never stops.
Behind the blindfold, Steve screws his eyes shut.
You choke on a laugh, because yes, you love him, holy Christ, you love him, love him so much some days you can hardly breathe with it, like it’s too big for your body, like your beating heart could burst right through your skin, and—
Iron Man’s voice is shaking. “Don’t— You don’t—” He spits the words out like he’s just bitten into something rotten. “Don’t you think, don’t you
“Nah,” Steve says. “I’m committed now.” He rubs Iron Man’s leg reassuringly with his thumb and tilts his head back so Iron Man can see his smile. “Same goes for you, you know. No harm, no foul.”
for betaing and moral support.
He’d just finished the first section when the cycle hit and put all thoughts of light entertainment out of his mind.
“…yeah?” There’s a note of wariness in Iron Man’s voice. Steve decides he likes it. Let Iron Man be wary. This is Steve’s show now.
He wishes to god they hadn’t waited this long. Wishes this was something they got to share, before. Before Steve was old and Tony was
the shit.
“You could do it again. If you wanted. Both hands, you could— Jesus.” Steve feels a shock of cold metal as Iron Man rests his head against his thigh. “I think I’m catching religion here.”
Steve pushes him back a little. Reaching past him, he grabs the bedsheet in both hands and tears off a long, narrow strip.
From behind you, you hear, very low: “I think maybe you don’t know my principles as well as you think.”
Tony is staring at him, color draining from his cheeks. His eyes are wide and stricken. “I—” he says. “I’m sorry, I wasn’t— I didn’t mean—”
Steve stands slowly, giving the others ample time to reach the door. He’s just begun to follow when a gauntleted hand descends on his shoulder.
There’s bitterness to Iron Man’s voice this time, the way it’s burned black at the edges. “Oh, darling,” he says, stroking a hand across Steve’s hair, “you have no idea.”
He turns his attention back to the coffee table, fingers hovering above the clasp. “It’s not live, is it?”
“There isn’t.”
“Hey there,” Steve says, and smiles. He still feels good—he still feels so very good, and he wants to make Iron Man feel good too. “Maybe I can help you with that?”
He moves his hand again, lets his mind drift…
“Winghead? You in?”
Iron Man is grounding him.
Except.
So much effort.
It isn’t long before the pounding is joined by a rapid counterpoint, faint but getting louder. Steve lets his head loll onto his shoulder.
“Captain America’s not allowed to have off days? Is that it?”
Steve shuts his mouth. The words echo in his mind, the sound twisting, shedding its computer-modified artificiality, taking on a familiar accent—cultured, but just a little bit rough at the edges, like singed velvet.
He glares.
“No,” he manages, “
Steve makes a clumsy attempt to catch at Iron Man’s hand. The fact that he succeeds is, he suspects, as much due to Iron Man humoring him as to Steve’s own efforts. He brings Iron Man’s hand to his lips, rests the back of it on his cheek. A shiver goes through him. Iron Man’s
