, oh, God, please, Steve, yeah, like that,” Tony mumbled, rambling off into an incoherent stream of mutterings.
“I know,” Steve replied, his eyelids already drooping. Tony climbed into the bed and carefully draped himself over Steve’s body. The important thing, he thought as he drifted towards sleep, was that he was prepared, and he had thought of everything. He could handle this. Throughout human history, Alphas had been taking care of their Omegas during a Heat, and between everything he’d read on the subject and all his conversations with Bruce, he was more than ready.
The hushed reverence of Tony’s voice, the heat of the motion of his hand, the coldness of Tony’s skin, the burning rub of skin against skin, the rough edge of his nails scraping a thin line--like teeth, Steve had time to think, and then he was coming, his cock pulsing a long, thick line across his stomach and chest and spattering over Tony, coating his chest and the necklace that dangled between them.
“Hmmm,” Stane replied noncommittally.  “See, I think that it is
?” Steve demanded with a vicious sort of horrified rage that sent a spike of…something…down Tony’s spine.  Pride, power, need, mine, want,
“Oh, do you really have to do that now?  He just got here, Howard,” Maria protested.
“Sorry,” Tony said dully, twisting away.  He didn’t want Steve to touch him.  He wanted Steve to hold him.  He didn’t know what he wanted.  The nonsensical demand that Steve just give him what he needed throbbed in his head.  “I’m sorry. I am, Steve.  I don’t know why…why me.  Why this happened.  But it happened for a reason.  Or maybe I have to give it a reason, I don’t know.  I don’t know if that’s a real difference.  I told Obie, strictly civilian non-combatant.  Protection, that’s it, but…”
“Damn right,” Pepper admonished, though she just sounded relieved rather than upset. “Mitch wants to talk to you. He's been trying to get a hold of you all afternoon. Rather spectacularly insistently, too.”
“I’d like that,” Tony said softly.  “I’d really like that.”
Steve closed his eyes.  A bright light burst behind his lids, brighter than any normal light, blinding him. His stomach swooped.  Pain seared through his skull, like it was breaking apart from the inside, or needed to, he wasn’t sure which.  He thought he was glad he hadn’t eaten, and then the world shifted and he was weightless for a flash of a second, floating, suspended, then…down.
“Of course.  Though, it goes against everything I believe in about this world,” Tony said with an exaggerated shake of his head.
“Our room,” Tony corrected.  “Top floor.  Penthouse.  Just hit the red and gold button,” Tony answered, learning his face into the crook of Steve’s neck and taking in a deep whiff of Steve’s scent.  He may have taken a tiny lick, just because it was right there, and yep, tasted even better.  Or did it?  Hard to say.  He drew in another deep breath.  He needed to explore this dichotomy at some length.
“Yeah, don’t worry, Sourpatch, I’ve got it covered. Uh, though, I should probably tell you that, purely in the interests of national security and the greater good, I kind of had to fake marry that stripper-gram you sent. Thanks for that, by the way,” Tony added quickly.
A few seconds later, the elevators slid open again, this time emptying a team of very confused police officers, who were suddenly confronted with quite the unexpected scene in front of them, and shortly thereafter, three medics with a stretcher piled with a defibrillator and other devices.  Two of them swarmed Tony, while the other checked Obie’s vitals. Still alive, darn it, Tony thought with a sigh as one of them shone a light in his eye.
A pause. His stomach swooped. He could hear tapping, like on a keyboard. “Room Six,” the woman’s voice said.
“Can we just… not talk about it anymore?” Steve asked around a sigh.
“I--what?” Tony said, his head spinning almost comically in Steve’s direction as the swelling music played on the screen.
“They fly the banners of the guilds or whatever unfortunate they last met when they are in port, but their ships are light and fast when they aren’t burdened with their spoils.  Different than the merchant vessels. They just bribe the portmasters to look the other way,” Steve explained.  “Seize the goods.  Use the profits for the letters of transit. The guilds will be happy with their market not being undercut, if nothing else.  Commandeer the ships, fill them with your navy and use those to guard your merchants on their routes.”
“Just wondering.  It’s strange not to know what’s normal for me now.  I mean, I know you said we’re friends, but I wasn’t sure what that meant.  Exactly,” Steve clarified, shifting a bit in his seat, like the words made him uncomfortable, and Tony had to try very, very hard not to send a prayer of thanks to the heavens that Steve apparently wasn’t going to pursue this line of questioning too far.  “But, it’s nice.  That we do this now.”
“Well, that’s—that’s what I’m saying.  You wouldn’t have to Bond again, if you didn’t want to,” Steve replied.  That hadn’t exactly been what Tony said, but he didn’t correct Steve.  “Is this what had you upset about Buc—James this afternoon?  I thought…maybe I’d—maybe I’d done something wrong…something that bothered you…” he trailed off, frowning in confusion.
Tony blinked down at him, eyes wide while his mind tried to run fast enough to catch up to his dick. “So, breakfast is over,” Tony said quickly, standing up from the table so fast his chair toppled over behind him and his thighs banged against the top, making the dishes jump and clang loudly. “Plane?”
“I think I can manage,” Steve told Cam, relieving him of the parasol as they walked towards the tent as a group.

“It wasn’t relevant to any of this.  This--between us,” Steve argued, which, though true enough as far as it went, sounded like utter bullshit when he said it out loud.  “I helped Colonel Rhodes and a couple of the guys who were injured.  They’d already come and gone with you by the time I got out of the Hum-Vee.  It was on its side, and the door was jammed shut.  That’s it.  End of story.  It doesn’t—that has nothing to do with any of this.”
“What the hell, Zola?” Hammer spat out, dropping his hand from Steve’s hair and tossing it into the air in obvious annoyance as Zola rushed into the room with barely a quick nod meant to suffice as a bow.  “There had better be a good explanation for this.  We’re just getting star—hey!” Hammer snapped in surprise as Zola walked over and grasped Steve’s shoulder, pushing him back on his heels.  Zola looked harried, to say the least, Steve noted.  His robes were askew where the pin at his shoulder had loosened to let the front gape open.  A sheet of sweat coated his brow and his wispy hair was sticking up in places.
“Was that it?  Was that why?” Steve asked, sounding strained.
“With Tony,” Bucky corrected simply. “I’ll follow you anywhere, you know that. So will the team. Because you’re you, and that’s enough for us, and I know how fucking unfair that is. I know how much you question everything because no one else will. But Tony’s going to make you earn every step of whatever path you put the two of you on. You need that. To know that he’s following you because he believes you’re right, not just because he believes in you. He’s going to make it hard, but damn it, Steve, when you do, you’re going to remake the world. It should be hard. Impossible, really. But you’re going to do it, the two of you,” Bucky said with a quick shake of his head.
“They were.  Gulmira.  Come on.  You know they were,” Tony said dully.
“Really?  A tour?  With the King?” Cam squealed with delight.  “I must tell Lena and Marcus.  They will be so jealous.  They never go anywhere, except the laundry or the storehouse, and those don’t count.  You will wear something special for the King tonight, yes?  To thank him?  I will come with you to the baths and see that they take proper care of you.  You should be beautiful for him, and tell him how happy you are.  He will like to hear this and will want to take us other places with him,” Cam stated with his usual directness.
Tony had forgotten.  Stupid, he thought, annoyed with himself. He reached up and covered the scars at the center of his chest, where the cave bear had marked him as a child, and reached for the edges of the shift to try to hide them.
“Tony, are you--Tony?” Steve called out, shaking him slightly.
“It was a gift from France. The watch,” Tony told her.
to him, for Christ’s sake.
“A Newman?” Steve guessed, the startling color fields filling his mind.  The MOMA had them on exhibit back in high school, and he had wondered how something that seemed so simple could pull you in so completely.  He could see it, the line of deep black bisecting the white, could recall the feeling of standing in front of it, like you were being sucked into it, becoming a part of it somehow.  Steve looked over at Tony out of the corner of his eye.  He’s the vortex, and I’m still tilting towards it, maybe I have been this whole time, Steve thought, the image of blood on sand, how it turned almost black, flitting across the backs of eyes as he let them shutter for a moment. Or jumping.  Same result, except when it wasn’t.  Down the rabbit hole, Steve thought somehow hysterically.  They all did—Ms. Potts, Murdock, Colonel Rhodes—all let themselves be pulled towards this infinite space that Tony occupied, seemingly with practiced ease, though something kept Steve from quite believing it was really that simple for Tony either.  All the world’s a stage, after all.
Tony had stopped laughing, Steve noticed, staring down at his empty plate.
“It need not hurt, Steve. Quick. Painless. And if that is what you want, then I will give it to you,” Tony told him solemnly.
.  Just thinking about him…
“Um…yes.  I…help with the painting,” Steve said, turning to Tony to see if he’d said something wrong.
“Why are you reading requisition reports?” Steve asked, curious.
Steve nodded.  “I am sure. Tony.  I will be fine, and you will stay.”  He smiled softly, glancing quickly at Tony, then away again.
Tony had eschewed the Lord’s invitation to hunt this afternoon in favor of spending it with Bruce, who arrived a few days before Tony, Steve and the rest of the royal party.  The elusive privacy offered by the woods also allowed them the opportunity to speak more freely. Steve suspected Tony knew that he had been chafing under the many rules and formalities now that they were ensconced in the Greenway.  Traveling in Tony’s carriage or staying at one of the many manor houses and inns along the route where they nighted, he and Tony, and sometimes Cam and Rhodes, got to relax and simply enjoy each other’s company, where they could, for a little while anyway, feel like they were just two people, like anyone else.
“I don’t mean to interject myself into your relationship, Captain,” Jarvis assured him.
“It’s Been a Long, Long Time, if you have that one,” Steve said. It still felt weird speaking to the air and having some British AI that always seemed ever so slightly judgmental respond, but he was getting used to it.
Jealousy meant…well, it meant not lack of feeling, that was certain. He wasn’t sure if it meant what he hoped or if he was reading entirely too much into it.  He should probably ask Natasha, but after what Sam had said, he was somewhat concerned she would do something drastic if he brought it up. He watched the video one more time, pausing it on Tony’s face as he blinked first in their staring contest before turning it off.  He decided since he had neglected his run this morning that he would spend some time in the gym and ended up sparring with Clint for a bit, grimacing at Clint’s delighted howl as he managed to land a sharp jab to Steve’s ribcage while Steve was busy thinking about what would happen if he asked Tony to coffee.
“Back at you,” Bucky said, his lips curling up into a small smile.
“Maybe. Maybe it doesn't have to be,” Tony continued softly. “Goodbye, I mean.”
“Mad?” Tony repeated, sounding bewildered. “No. No, I’m not mad, Steve. I’m honestly relieved it wasn’t something worse. I could tell you have been twisting yourself into knots lately. I knew a storm was brewing in that head of yours, and if the night’s outburst was all it was, then I consider myself fortunate.”
One night. One million dollars.  He stared at the glowing, green numbers on the bedside clock telling him it was just past two in the morning.  Steve’s mind flashed back to the balcony, to Stark in his fancy suit, managing to look perfectly rumpled by the wind.  Heremembered thinking how Stark was smaller in person than he looked on TV or in pictures.  People always said that about celebrities. Steve supposed it was probably true.  But, somehow, Stark didn’t
“Hmmm…” she said noncommittally.  “See, that’s a little odd to hear, Steve.  Because Stark has paid for this past week already.  I was wondering when you would stop by to pick up your envelope. In fact, I believe he’s booked you for…well, let’s just say the foreseeable future, shall we?”
“I think I would quite enjoy sparring with you,” Steve replied.
“Can you really do that?” Barnes asked.
“Yes, but--” Steve started, then stopped abruptly, the import of Tony’s words slowly sinking in.
“I’m better,” Tony assured him with several very firm nods.  His head kept bobbing for a bit longer than he intended, but he finally managed to stop.  “Four minutes is a long time.  Lots can happen.”
“It’s a shame I can’t leave you like this all the time,” he sighed, almost absently, stroking the towel over Steve’s cheeks and mouth. “It should be enough, you in my collar. But, I find I want to mark you as mine in every way possible. Even the ones that I… even the ones that are impossible,” he finished, mouth flattening, his eyes darting away for a moment.
“Jack, it’s fine, I got you covered, here,” Brock assured him.  He pulled out his wallet and handed Jack five one-hundred dollar bills.
.  Of course, he had, Tony thought, remembering the first time he asked Steve for soap, and how it had flustered Tony so much that Steve had gotten him dish soap, which was still the best thing for getting motor oil off his hands.  Because Steve noticed, and Steve loved all the parts of him, even the ones that sometimes terrified Tony.
“Of course!” Allen replied.  Steve thought he seemed relieved. “I’ll just wait out in the car.  You take your time.”
, close to as smart as he is--yes, yes, you do. Everyone else you just get annoyed with and order around.”
“Sounds great,” Tony managed, more in relief than because he actually wanted to spend the evening pandering to Steve, but at least he wasn’t expected to cook.
“Someone has to,” Steve said, then gasped as Tony thrust his hips again.  “Tony,” Steve said, voice low and full of pleading.
“I’ll throw you a ticker-tape parade,” Tony retorted listlessly, tearing his gaze away from his father’s hard look.  He needed to get away before he made even more of a fool of himself and did something that really encapsulated the definition of insanity, like plead with Howard not to do this.  It was currently a toss-up between that or just collapsing into a heap and refusing to move for the rest of his life, though, he suspected his father might actually find the latter a bit more acceptable than Tony’s usual behavior.  At least he’d be in the right position.  Fuck.  Fuck, fuck, fuck.  This was happening.  A part of him still couldn’t wrap his head around it.   Maybe he’d wake up, hunched over his desk to find that DUM-E had made him a shake with a bit too much of his mom’s special pills he wasn’t supposed to know about.

“Ah, well, I know—I know I’m not really on the schedule today, but.  Well.  I thought maybe, if you could.  You could let Tony—Mr. Stark—know that I’m available.  If he wanted to see me,” Steve stuttered, realizing that he hadn’t entirely thought this out.
“Going to want to have a nice, long conversation at some point, Stark,” Fury added, tipping his fingers to his forehead in mock salute.
“More specifically…” Tony said after a beat of silence.
The other nipple.  Steve didn’t move this time.  Hammer’s hand went to the front of his breeches, working the ties open.
“I’ll stop.  The solving thing. I can be wildly unhelpful, you have no idea,” Tony promised with a deprecating grimace.  “I shouldn’t have thrown all that at you.  I didn’t know about Rhodey and what he was going to say.  I wouldn’t have.  If I’d known.”
Tony pushed in, slowly, excruciatingly slowly, stretching Steve around him to the point it felt like Steve’s body would come apart, that this wouldn’t work any other way.  It burned, bright and pure, and he was too full, almost choking with how full he was, the pressure of it too much, too much, too much, and then he turned to face Tony, the stabbing ache of sensation rushing back to his nipple coupled with the deep, burning stretch of Tony pushing inside him, claiming him, and he was gone. Over the edge. Flying. Soaring.  The pain was all below him, and there was just him and Tony, and this budding sense of pleasure, fine and delicate and deep, but there.
“Thanks,” Steve mumbled, looking back down at the suitcases on the bed, feeling suddenly self-conscious about how he looked.  For some reason, Brock’s words, which were surely meant to be a compliment, didn’t
left off.  But…” he stopped and flattened his mouth, squinting up at the sun as it warmed his skin.
People were looking at him, really looking--maybe seeing, maybe for the first time--and it probably should have bothered him, but he wanted them to see.  To see and to know.  To know that they shouldn’t talk about Tony, not like that.  No one should.  That, he decided, was a good thing, and if what he could do got him that one, good thing, he was going to let them look and not care.
“Ah-aah--oh,” Steve stuttered, ending in a moan.  He knew he liked touching himself there, but he hadn’t realized  how much more intense it would feel when someone else did.  Tony massaged his balls, squeezing and tugging seemingly at random, finally releasing them when Steve’s cock spurted a copious line of pre-cum across his hip.  “Sorry,” Steve managed.
“Take the left just past the light, Happy,” Steve said, glancing over at Tony before looking back out the window.  “You don’t have to come in, you know.”
you do the shocked face?” Tony agreed with a deprecating laugh.  “Lady Devon would certainly attest, I am sure.  She was only one of many tutors, but lasted the longest.  A testament to her patience, which is why I asked her to take on Cam.  He’s far too easily distracted.  Smart, though.  I think even she is surprised by his progress,” Tony said with a note of pride in his voice.
“Made by my own father’s hand, Raj’Inama.  He would be honored,” the goldsmith called out with a deep, sweeping bow.
“People are always quick to believe what they want to believe,” Cam replied, looking away again, a hint of sadness clinging to his voice.  “I want to believe you will be happy here, and that you will make the King happy, and that I shall serve you well, and that one day, the King will say, ‘Cam, you have served my concubine well, and for this, I will give you a reward,’ and I will say, ‘Your Highness, my mother is a hard worker, and she makes the best potato hash you have ever tasted.  For my reward, I would ask that you bring her here, and let her serve you for all her days.’  And he would.  This is what I want to believe.  So, I will,” Cam said, lifting his eyes to Steve’s.
“Steve. What love mean?” Anto asked again, more insistent this time.
“Colonel Rhodes thought it was very catchy,” Steve said mildly.
“I’m not—I’m not actually good with…with the, ah.  The water and someone—someone touching me like that, I—I can’t,” Tony grimaced, looking up at Steve with a slight wince.  Damn it, damn it, damn it. It was the last thing he wanted to be thinking about. He was in a shower with Steve Rogers, the man of his literal dreams, and he couldn’t—he couldn’t.  Not this. He couldn’t. He wanted to. God, he wanted to so much, not just because it would feel good, and he knew it would, but because it would make Steve happy, and fuck, he wanted that.  But, he couldn’t. “I’m sorry. Sorry, it’s—I can’t.”
“I wish I’d gotten a chance to learn more languages.  Wish I understood yours, the way you understand mine,” Steve sighed, mouth flattening.  “It’s different, that’s for sure, your language. But some languages are like that, aren’t they?  Different. I know you’re saying stuff, I just don’t have the faintest idea what. It’s nice, though, all your sounds.  I’ve got some of them down, I think, like when you’re happy, which is sort of a high-pitched hum that kind of has a vibration to it.  Or when I’m doing something wrong on the
“Sure.  Sounds good,” Tony mumbled.
The alien rubbed at Tony’s prostate again, then pressed harder, making Tony’s cock jump and pulse with need inside the gel, which shifted and moved to accommodate his cock as it jutted out between his legs.  He could feel himself leaking, though the gel just seemed to absorb it.
Steve set his jaw. Felt his teeth grind.  He hadn’t thought he could hate anyone more than Rumlow.  He’d been wrong.  A bone-deep weariness settled over him.  There was nothing to be done.  He’d already failed the girl back at the port.  Bucky.  So many dead.  While he’d waited on the sidelines like a good soldier for men a world away to make a damn stand.
“I know.  Do you trust me?” Tony asked.
Tony crawled across the bed to kneel next to Steve, sucking in another gulp of air into his lungs. He let his eyes close for a moment, trying to find some way to center himself. He could do this for Steve. Take care of him. Make this good for him. This was his purpose.
“Nah,” Steve disagreed, shaking his head. “I mean, put me in a fight with a clear plan and I’ll go in swinging. If there’s a right thing to do, I’ll do it, even if it’s difficult. But this? I’ve never been the one to make the first move; didn’t have a clue how to.” He smirked self-deprecatingly. “I wouldn’t have this time either. But…I missed my chance last time, you know? Went under the ice, woke up seventy years later and missed my date.”
At least it wasn’t a hostile force like the Chitauri had been.
“I almost did before.”
Their eyes were pure black, much like insects, and their eyelids closed sideways and in sequence, which was rather hypnotizing when one paid attention. Evolutionarily speaking, it was a relatively good idea to have two sets of eyes looking at all times. Much better than what humans did with their measly one set of eyes.
Steve’s smile was gentle. “I, uh…overheard you in the engine room. What you said. About our relationship.”
“Who knows, right?” Barton said, nodding.
“It does,” Tony said, bracing his hands on the top of the car. “If you’re not comfortable—”
Steve gave him a sweet grin, one that he’d given Tony plenty of times before. Only this time it made something in Tony’s chest squeeze painfully tight.
Because he…
None of that meant that Tony
Tony murmured a quiet “night” and stared at the wall, wishing the blanket covered the arc reactor’s light. “Let me know if the light gets too bright,” he found himself saying before he could rethink it. “I know Pepper sometimes couldn’t sleep.”
at this point. Jury was still out. There had been too many leeches in Tony’s history for Rhodey to accept every Tom, Dick, and Harry that came into Tony’s life and stuck around. Usually it was for money. Tony’s money sometimes overrode whatever character flaws he had for those leeches.
“That’s sweet,” Tony said, smiling faintly, “but I’d rather remember it. It reminds me that I’m lucky to have this.”
So just by the process of elimination, Steve had been the one to take care of Tony in the aftermath of Pepper. (Or not “take care of” as Tony wasn’t an infant and he hadn’t lost all powers of judgment after being broken up with.) Steve just…hovered.
“Mistletoe,” Steve said, pulling back. What was visible of his face under the cowl looked faintly pink. “Merry Christmas, Iron Man.”
Tony slowly opened his eyes, moving his face enough so he no longer had hair in his mouth. The first thing he saw was that he was not in his room in the tower, which reminded him that he was on a spaceship and sharing a bed with Steve.
“Tony didn’t tell you?”
“I was curious,” Tony admitted. “There had to be
“I take offense at that,” Tony said, narrowing his eyes. “I don’t
Tony smiled into his glass of non-alcoholic eggnog as he saw Luke hold Dani up to the tree, letting her reach out to tap at one of the less fragile ornaments. Most of the ornaments weren’t fragile, but there were a few nicer ones tucked away in the top branches. They’d survived this long simply because no one wanted to face Jarvis’s wrath if they were broken.
As long as it would take Tony to repaint the stealth suit he had made. He’d been considering a different color scheme for it but had decided against it because surely it’d be obvious it was a different suit? But now this meant war.
Barton snorted. “They fall asleep watching TV again? It happens – like – five times a week. Depends on if Steve gets Tony out of the workshop. And if they’re not doing something else to begin with.”
It had to be slow. He knew that.
“You, too,” Steve said several minutes later, seemingly out of the blue.
“I, uh…” Steve swallowed, head moving in the direction of Tony’s mouth. “Yes.”
By the end of his stay, Rhodey was armed with enough ammo to be 100% sure that Tony was in a romantic relationship with Steve Rogers. He was also increasingly hurt that Tony hadn’t
, but the current reality was too nice to ignore.
Judging by the exclamation marks he got back, Pepper didn’t seem to mind. It also answered his question as to whether Tony had told her about the relationship.
“…Dating?” Tony sounded blank.
“You left,” Barton said matter-of-factly, “and then Steve stepped in when Bruce got too anxious. Tony doesn’t really trust Nat and me that much, and Thor was gone too frequently, so that left Steve to do most of the work. One thing led to the next, and here we are.” He made a vague gesture.
“You do,” Steve answered simply.
“Not all of us have
Steve’s answering smile was gentler than Tony had expected given his earlier expressions. “Hey, Tony.”
And because it had always been Steve.
“You would essentially be blacklisted,” Thor informed them. “If you were ever in need of aid in the future, it would not come except from disreputable sources. I would certainly not trust those to aid this planet.”
“Must be a good relationship,” Tony said noncommittally, rolling his shoulders.
There was a ringing sound in Tony’s ears as he started the drive back, unable to look over at Steve. He wasn’t sure what he’d find on Steve’s face. He wasn’t sure what Steve would see on
In the back of his mind, where Rhodey wasn’t stunned and trying to figure out how this had happened, he thought it looked kind of cute. Even domestic.
Was it so bad to have to be in a relationship with him? (Who was he kidding?
Totally doable. (Even with Steve’s hand still resting at the small of his back like he’d forgotten it was there. Tony sure wasn’t going to tell him to move it.)
Steve’s mouth was back on his, but it was gone before Tony could kiss back, only for Steve to press kisses to his cheeks, his nose, his forehead.
ridiculous. “Yes.”
“We didn’t finish it, remember? We had a call—”
Rhodey side-eyed Barton, considering. “You know that, huh.”
Tony’s coffee was decidedly cold when he finally managed to pull himself together enough to take a drink. He wrinkled his nose and debated heating it up as Steve entered the kitchen, looking like he had already been up for five hours and run the entire length of New York City.
When the coffee machine beeped its readiness, he poured it into a thermal carafe and arranged everything on a bamboo tray. The towels he had bought for the occasion were next, soft Turkish cotton cloths he had found in one of the specialty shops downtown that catered to Omegas. He added a few drops of sandalwood oil to each towel, because he knew that Tony liked the smell, then wet them and wrung them out. They went into the microwave next to warm them. Traditionally, it would be done over hot stones, but he figured Tony wouldn’t mind if he skipped a step. He rolled them up carefully to keep the heat in and placed them inside a small clay pot he’d purchased at the same shop, nothing fancy, but with a delicate pattern of small circles around the lip that had reminded him of the reactor. Steve put the lid on the clay pot and added it to the tray next to the food, fiddling with the arrangement a bit until he was satisfied. He carried the tray down the long hall to the bedroom, then stopped in front of the door.
He wondered if Rhodey had seen something in Tony’s manic determination to do this.  If that was why he had been so against this. Him and Pepper both.
“I don’t need those,” Tony said, staring at the small, blue bottle with horrified fascination.  “Those are unnatural.  And illegal.”
“You got shot at by a truck?” Tony asked somewhat incredulously.  “Who gets shot at by a truck?  Okay, legitimately, they’d probably get a pass at taking out Michael Bay based on Transformers 2 alone, but otherwise…”
The alien pulled away, still bent over him, a lock of golden hair falling between his eyes.  He rubbed his thumb over Tony’s cheek, tracing the line of bone, then down to Tony’s goatee, feeling the bristles with a sort of mild curiosity that he hadn’t had when he felt them earlier.  The alien’s face was smooth and hairless. As here his arms, at least what Tony could see of them, though he had a full head of perfect hair that would be the envy of shampoo commercial models everywhere.  He placed his hand over Tony’s lips then, hesitant at first, then pressed more firmly. He sighed, his face blissful, then smiled at Tony. He waved his hand and the not-gel over Tony’s arm moved, freeing it.  The alien took Tony’s hand and splayed the fingers, then put Tony’s index and middle fingers against his lips.
“Sir is…” and now it was definitely strange because JARVIS simply did not have to search for the right word.  “Though Sir has engaged his privacy settings, I can assure you that Sir is not unwell, and does not require your assistance at this time.”
“And last, but definitely not least, Natasha, who probably apologized at some point, but seeing as how I spent the last hour and forty-five minutes telling her, a person whom I just met, mind you, about the time Paul Jamison ditched me at Junior Prom for Jennifer Davies, who, at the time, was supposed to be my best friend, I can’t really be certain,” Pepper explained, chewing primly on another fry.  “I’m not actually sure how that happened, but I feel weirdly lighter, and we’re having coffee and getting our nails done next Wednesday.”
“We fell apart because my old man was a dick who liked to see me suffer,” Tony retorted grimly.
“No, it really isn’t.  I didn’t mean it.  I didn’t, I swear.  I just…I needed space, and instead of just asking for it like a normal person, I was an asshole, and I’m sorry.  I really am.  And thanks for not, you know,” Tony finished, swallowing heavily and biting at his lip.  “Freaking out about it.”
After dinner, slaves, who Steve assumed belonged to the Ul by their thin collars with a looped ring hanging from the center, rushed forward and produced a tall, slim jar-like contraption topped with a glass bowl. Several long hoses fitted with pipes snaked from it. They proceeded to add hot coals and water to the device, along with various leaves that smelled as if they had been soaked in something sweet, and soon enough, a cloying scent filled the air.
“He wanted to serve,” Fury insisted.  “Have
Tony and Steve have dinner with the parents. It goes about as well as you'd expect.
“Ah,” Steve said with a smile that looked somehow relieved.  “I could take it to SHIELD. See if there’s any interest.  If there is, might help grease the wheels at SI.”
“What if the money wasn’t a part of the equation?” Tony asked carefully, echoing his earlier question, but more pointed this time.  He tracked the way Steve’s eyes darted to him and then down to the tabletop, studying his coffee as if it held answers, and found himself in edge, off-kilter somehow as he waited for what those answers might be.
“I like a chall--oh!” Steve shouted in surprise. Shifting lower, Tony’s clever fingers had found the thin line of skin just under his cock and pressed. Steve nearly sat up on the bed.  He caught himself, but not before he banged noses with Tony, who laughed.
“That bright one, there, with the smaller one next to it,” Stone replied.
Steve braced his hands on either side of Tony so he was looking directly down at the other man, watching his reactions as Steve moved his hips in deep, hard thrusts, breath coming out in tiny puffs of air.  He felt himself tightening and knew it wouldn’t be long, so he shifted slightly downward, adjusting the angle of his hips and thrust up, hard and deep, hitting the bundle of nerves just so and watched Tony’s whole body jump as he gave a sharp cry, followed by a low, keening whine as Steve hit it again and again and again and then Steve was coming, thrusts erratic now, deep and hard as he came, then shallowing as his body wrung the last few strokes from him.  He collapsed on top of Tony for what was probably longer than was necessary, but had no real desire to remove himself from Tony’s body, let alone roll over.  Tony didn’t seem to mind, just kept pressing small, feathery kisses to his shoulder and collarbone where he could reach.  Finally, Steve made himself pull out, as gingerly as he could, and rolled over enough to wrap his arms around Tony, placing a kiss to the top of the man’s head of unruly hair.
Actually, Tony thought he was something of a sobbing, snot-streaked, sweaty, cum-stained, blissed-out mess, but, hey, he’d take beautiful.  He’d take anything.  He didn’t care.  Everything was good.  He was flying, floating, falling, and it was all good.  He grunted, felt his whole body go weak, and his vision blurred.  He felt one of Steve’s fingers press inside his slack hole to the knuckle, curling a bit, then pushing all the way in.  It felt different than when the doctor did it, Tony thought blearily.  Made him feel full and empty, which didn’t make sense, but that was the best his mind could do.  A second finger followed, and Tony felt his body adjust to the stretch of two.  Steve pumped his hand in and out in a few lazy strokes, making sure Tony was sufficiently slick and loose, then separated his fingers, up and down, working them against Tony’s over-sensitized hole, making Tony hiss with a desperate, keening spike of pleasure/pain.
Sure, after a while, that had seemed, well…boring.  Staid.  Straight-laced.  Tony was moving on to his PhD, getting deeper and deeper into the world of elite scientists and engineers at the cutting edge of AI, and Steve was, well…just sort of there.  He’d listen to Tony talk, ask questions at the right times, sound encouraging and amazed, do all of that good boyfriend stuff, but he didn’t really
“Oh, that. Steve gets cravings sometimes, you know how it is. Hulk likes to bring him things. Little gifts. Nothing to worry about,” Tony assured him.
“Fairly cheap date, all things considered,” Tony said after a pause. There was a calculating, curious look floating over his features, eyes narrow and mouth drawn into a pinch that was clearly an aborted question, but he shrugged his shoulders and turned back to watching their reflections in the doors of the elevator instead of Steve.  He was probably entitled to demand to know, Steve admitted to himself.  Anyone Steve was in hock to could potentially jeopardize this whole thing, but Tony didn’t push, and Steve was absurdly grateful for that.  “It has these little racecars on it.  Pepper hates it.  Says it’s tacky.  But, then again, you should see all the art she makes me buy.  Looks like someone got a four-year old high and handed them a couple of spray guns of paints.  One just has a big black line down the center like someone was eating Oreos and thought, ‘But what if it was reversed?’  Questionable taste doesn’t begin to cover it.”
Honestly, how important was clean energy, really?
“Well.  Shall we—” Tony started, then turned as the far doors opened again.  “Ah, you made it—ooph!” A small blur of tan robes and dark hair had sprinted across the room and launched himself at Tony, wrapping the King in a too-tight hug.  The guards started forward, only to be waved off by Tony.
“I do believe our time is up,” she responded.  She tapped her pen on her notepad.  It was blank, except for today’s date.
“Did you kill all the bad people because I had a cold?” Tony asked, then sniffed and scrunched his nose up. “Wow.  Every have one of those my-life-is-weird moments?”
Tony stared at the glass until he couldn't see Steve's back anymore, then walked over to the small bar that jutted out from the far office wall. He uncorked the decanter and poured a few sips into the glass tumbler. It was water, but it felt good to hold the glass in his hand. He liked the familiar weight of it, the way the shape was almost a square, with sturdy, rounded edges that made a satisfying noise when he sat it down on the metal tray.
“Tony,” Steve husked out, raspy, like the word was scraped from somewhere deep inside.  He breathed out then and closed his eyes, stepping back and letting his hands fall away from Tony’s face before opening his eyes and turning to the side.  Tony’s hands were reaching out of their own accord, because he sure as hell wasn’t capable of directing his limbs to do much of anything.  He wanted to stop, he did, or he didn’t.  God, it was so hard to tell.  Nothing made sense.
He was so absorbed in his thoughts, he almost didn’t get off the elevator when it opened to the R&D floor, slipping out just as the doors started to close on him.  The agents in R&D turned out to be even more helpful than Steve would have imagined.  They gave him a few names to contact, and when Steve mentioned Tony’s interest in space, one mentioned that Caltech had some kind of partnership with something called the LIGO project. Steve was still a little unsure exactly what it involved, but it sounded right up Tony’s alley.  They also suggested Steve bring Tony by one day, which, admittedly, he hadn’t really considered before, but he thought Tony might enjoy seeing some of what they were working on.  At least to Steve’s eye, it looked vaguely, well...
“You ever been on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride?” Kirk asked, seemingly out of nowhere.
Tyber stared at him long and hard.  Behind him, the other clan shuffled nervously.  They didn’t understand what was happening. They had no Memory of anything like this.  They knew the weapon was bad and could hurt, but it had been destroyed, and Anto had been banished for two full summers to live on his own, dead to them, and he had come back, so the thing was undone.  It shouldn’t exist. He shouldn’t be able to wield it, let alone turn it on an Alpha. None of this should be. Anto could almost sympathize.
The words sounded a bit like the kind of criticism Steve was used to, but the way Tony said it didn’t make Steve feel at all like he was doing something wrong.  Instead, Tony sounded utterly delighted. And incredibly turned on.  Both of those things sent a warm glow of pleasure expanding through Steve’s chest.
Not that he wanted to die. He didn’t.  At all. But, if he was going to die, he’d rather it be on his own terms than slowly being eaten alive from the inside by the thing he built to save him.  Once, he remembered, he had been afraid that he would die in a suit he built escaping a cave. Now, he was sure of it, but he wasn’t afraid. Not anymore. Next great adventure, right? Why not.
“Sometimes.  Guess I always knew where to look for it, that’s for sure,” Steve admitted.  “Um, would you—Sorry, I should have asked.  I’m just—ah--there’s water and coffee.  I think maybe some soda.  I can call the mess—the, uh, cafeteria, I mean—and have them send up anything you want, if you’re hungry?”
A firm pressure on the small of his back cut through the cacophony in Steve’s mind.  Everything went cold for a moment.  Like the way the water feels when you first break the surface, so cold, you forget how to move, Steve thought, then drew in a shuddering breath that burned his throat and lungs and followed the pressure forward, leaning down until his chest met the bed.
“I don’t like him doing that stuff,” Barnes said finally.  Tony thought again about what exactly was meant by a misunderstanding about the nature of Steve’s services, but he didn’t press it.
“I’m sorry, Tony,” Steve said gently, and reached out to grasp Tony’s hand. “Please do not blame yourself for this.  Not this.”
“Th—thank you, Your Highness,” Cam whispered, voice filled with a nervous awe.
She stopped and blinked up at him.  “You know Hirst’s work?”
“I like seeing you like this,” Tony said, his voice easy and soft. “Relaxed. Happy. Not as if you carry the weight of the problems of the world on your shoulders.”
Tony let out a shuddering breath and bowed his head.  “I don’t deserve this.  You.  But I’m going to spend my life trying to.  I promise.”
“I do,” Steve replied. “Very much.”
Anto stared dumbly at him.  He looked down at the spear-thrower in his hand.  That was…it? “Tony things…Tony things good?”
“You’re right.  About the—ark.  That kind of power, someone has to be the one to try.  Someone will, whether they should or not, that’s for sure,” Steve said.
“Well.  Some do.  Omegas get older, Alphas want, you know, whatever,” Tony mumbled, waving his fork in the air diffidently.  “I mean, not all Alphas, obviously, just, you know, some.  Some do that.”
“It was handy?” Tony protested with a shrug.
happiness, the kind that he wasn’t even supposed to believe in--if that was really the toll of his sins, then so be it. He would deal with it, he always had.  If Steve wanted out, then…well. Then, that was that. He couldn’t stop him. Wouldn’t even try. Steve deserved, well, everything, but he at least deserved the dignity of a real choice here.  But, Tony couldn’t quite bring himself to regret any of this. At least they had this. Whatever happened, he got to be loved by Steve Rogers for a little bit of time, and that was worth more than just about anything.  This time together, this one perfect night, when they both loved each other and nothing else mattered, he wasn’t going to let himself twist it into something awful, even if that was his go-to. It was selfish, Tony knew.  Selfish and cowardly and a host of other words his therapist would probably use if he ever bothered to go, but he couldn’t make himself wish for anything different. He should, he knew, but he couldn’t.
“Owowowow,” Tony muttered in vague annoyance as much as actual pain as Natasha helped him slowly sink onto one of the metal benches that lined the inner hull of the Quin-jet.
“Why? Are you having trouble breathing?” Tony asked quickly.
“You know I have your back, Steve.  Always,” Sam said with a slow, pointed nod.  “I just don’t want you to do something you’ll regret.”
Tony let a pleased sigh slip out, then turned and wound his hands around Steve’s neck, pressing a quick kiss to his lips.
“You’re doing it again,” he said, his voice slurring a bit on the words. It wasn’t accusatory, more just an observation.  He couldn’t bring himself to care, really. He felt good. Wonderful, even. Joy suffused his mind, though it was tinged with an edge of melancholy that hadn’t been there before, though that was gone almost as soon as he noticed it.
“Well,” Tony began.  “Since you asked so nicely.”
,” Steve reiterated.  Tony grimaced, but didn’t correct him this time. “He was drunk off his ass, so were most of the guys with him. Security or hangers-on, whoever they were, I don’t know.  I handled it. I can take care of myself, Tony,” he said, giving Tony a small, rueful smile. He looked down at his lap, where Tony’s hand was wound so tightly around his that he could see the whites of Tony’s knuckles against the usual tan of his skin.  It was nice. To have someone care so much. To have someone want to fight your battles for you. To have someone on your side. He supposed, that’s why he was here, now, ready to go face a press corps that wanted to eat him alive, then spit him out, because Tony deserved that, too.
“Nightcap?” Tony asked, his shoes clicking softly across the floor as he tossed his jacket over the back of the sectional and gestured towards the bar.   For a fleeting second, Steve thought he was saying good night using the shortened form of Steve’s former rank, then quickly caught on and shook his head. It was tempting to drink more than he should and just get through the next few hours with a pleasant buzz and lowered inhibitions, but Steve didn’t think that was a particularly good idea.
Was Tony angry with him, Steve wondered, his stomach twisting. Tony’s face had been unreadable for the brief moment that Steve took to try to gauge his reaction. Of course he was angry. He had to be. Steve had done the one thing Tony asked him not to do, and over what? Words?
“You are here now,” Tony said, voice flat and hard, staring at the far wall, almost like he was speaking to himself.  “Whatever…circumstances that brought you to me, you are here now, and you are safe.  No one will harm you.  You will want for nothing.”  He craned his neck to the side and looked down at Steve.  “Is it…is it these memories that cloud your mind?  I would take them from you, if I could, but all I can do is try to replace them with better ones.  Ledgers and dusty manuscripts, even, if that is what it takes,” Tony said with a wobbly half-smile, though his eyes, when he looked down upon Steve, held unspeakable tenderness.  “Perhaps, in time, other things will come to mean enough to keep those thoughts at bay.”
“I don't need time to think about it, Tony. I've had ten years to realize that you were right. Not how I wanted to hear it said, I'll admit, but you had the right of it. Even if you don't think you were right now. This is—you're just—you're caught up in something that isn't real, Tony. It never was. You were right., what you said. Maybe for the wrong reasons, but you were right. You usually are,” Steve said as he bent over to shove textbooks and folders into his backpack.
“My tax dollars at work.  I feel so much safer,” Rhodey huffed.
was patrolling off the coast of Virginia,” Steve finished with an apologetic grimace.   “What about that’s so interesting to you, huh? Just when I think I’ve gotten you figured out, you surprise me, Shellhead.”
“Is it too much?  Dinner and all?  I can tell them to call it off,” Tony offered.  Please say no, please say no, he mentally chanted.  He wasn’t sure how he’d handle only getting a couple of hours of Steve’s time during a commute.  Steve seemed to treat the morning’s Tony-shaped surprise like a forced march he had to suffer through and then like something Tony would ditch like a Taylor Swift boyfriend, given half the chance.   Not exactly the kind of attitude that screamed ready to rekindle a relationship, Tony mused.
“I like it.  I mean, I hate that you had to go through that, but if you’re asking me if this is a turn-off, I’d say definitely not,” Steve assured him.  “I’m not sure what it is, but...not that. It’s...it’s beautiful, in its own, strange way. It keeps you alive, it saved you, it’s--it’s a part of you. I don’t know. I don’t know what I’m trying to say,” he paused, then lifted his eyes to Tony’s.  “I like it.”
There were small starbursts from the lights dangling above the table reflected on the silver flatware, Tony noticed.  White china proudly displaying the Chef’s moniker outlined in silver stared back up at him from the table top.  His gaze followed the outline of silver and swirls and curls that made up the custom crest.  The glassware had its own design on it as well. Something custom, no doubt.  His throat was parched, but if he tried anything now, it would taste like it had sand in it no matter how much he told himself it didn’t, it didn’t dammit all to hell, but he knew from prior experience just how well his stomach listened to his head.
was fine. Now, at least. He let out a sigh and scrubbed his hand over his face, then realized he’d left streaks of blood and wiped them off with the hem of his shirt. He needed to forget. To get his head together. He needed…
Then Steve felt Tony’s mouth in the middle of his back, between the shoulder blades, pressing a long, lingering kiss to the raised skin there. He could feel the heat and wetness of it, but little else, the scar there too deep to have left much sensation, but the shock of it, the delicate attentiveness, the way Tony let his cheek lay against the skin for a beat after the kiss, was almost too much. A shuddering, breathy sob he hadn’t realized he had been holding in escaped him as Tony rolled his mouth along the line of the welt, dragging his lips over the scars that crisscrossed Steve’s back.
is with me.  That I should stop.  Now.  Before something happens that I can’t take back.”
“You’re not mad?” Tony asked.  He hated how small his voice sounded, but he couldn’t help it. Everything had been going so well, and he’d been so careful, on his best behavior, constantly, and then this whole thing…he should’ve just given them the plans for the orange and left it at that, but no, he’d had to be there to see it roll, attack of the killer tomatoes-style, down the green, before it’s pyrrhic phoenix-esque transmutation into the world’s biggest glitterbomb, because of reasons, and now Steve was probably going to get in trouble or possibly a strongly worded letter of some kind or—
“Definitely a compliment,” Tony muttered under his breath.  “How do you feel about rimming? Because, one, I think it would help you relax, and two, dear God, do I want to get my mouth on you.”
“What’s he talking about?” Steve asked, a frown creasing his brow.  Great, now Steve was getting pissed that he was balking.  Of course, his Alpha was upset.  Why wouldn’t he be?  Fifteen minutes into Bonding, and his Omega was throwing a fit at a routine exam.  If they’d just told him.  He could have prepared himself.
“Well…that’s…I mean…” Howard stuttered, seemingly torn between the idea of a top-dollar Army contract and something that made Tony happy.
“Quera,” the Captain said, then lifted him down and dismounted, drawing his sword while one of his men rushed forward and drove a blade into the ground in front of Obie.
“Nah, but it’s Nat’s spot, so people just sort of let her have it for the most part,” he shrugged.  “Actually, I don’t really know how that happened, but there are a lot of things I have learned to just not question.”
“People who have a public are not the public,” Steve countered, nodding towards the pack of teenage boys taking turns leaning in to take a selfie with Tony in the background.  They stepped off the bus a few feet from a large, gray-sided building with a slanted roof and the name of a pharmaceutical company spelled out in blocky letters on the side.
“Maybe that’s how it is, but it doesn’t sound much like how it should be,” Steve replied.  It came out sounding tired. “Whatever people have said,” Steve stopped, drawing in a shaky breath.  People talked about Anthony. Said things about him.
, in every sense of that word, but beautiful, Tony thought.  No use pretending now, Tony supposed. He was letting the alien who found him in space fuck him back to life or whatever, so admitting the alien was attractive was probably the least of his many, many issues for therapy later.
Hypocritical, that’s what that was.  Hypocritical and not… completely amazing, Steve thought with a wistful sigh.
“Thanks, Buck,” Steve said quickly, deciding for now to ignore Bucky’s jibes, if for no other reason than he really didn’t know what to say in response.
He turned away from the mirror and surveyed the empty room.  His bed was made. The corners of the blanket were neatly tucked in with a pristine edge.  The dishes were put away. Nothing sat on top of his dresser or the kitchen counter, except a coffee pot that was fancier than most of the planes he’d flown in the war and toaster he didn’t use.  It was loud when the toast popped up, he’d found on his first try, but then he hadn’t wanted to ask for a different one and be forced to explain why, so it just sat there. It was almost time for his meeting.  He didn’t have to look at the clock to know, but Anthony’s picture was still there, so he walked over and picked it up by the edges.
“Is your plan to solve Steve’s life problems until he likes you back?” Rhodey asked.
“I’m sorry, I’m—I have to go,” Steve said abruptly and stood up from the table.  “Sorry,” Steve said again, grabbing a few napkins from their holder and dabbing at the small puddle of coffee while Tony tried to remember how to breath.
Steve closed his eyes and bent over where his elbows lay on his thighs, letting his head dip low. He couldn’t deny Bucky’s words, wouldn’t deny them. It had been an honorable fight, though he couldn’t say the same for how he had felt afterwards, the deep, dark satisfaction that ran through him when he thought of it.
“I was thinking your ass belongs in a museum more than those sharks,” Steve replied.  “Sorry. Didn’t mean to ruin the mood.”
“You do, my King!  He is more handsome than anyone in the entire kingdom, is he not?” Cam said.
After Steve deposited the check.
“You’re beautiful,” Steve whispered, with a low huff of breath that had a smile in it.  He reached out and put a hand over Tony’s, then shifted a little higher, splaying over the blue light like he could catch it.  His dog tags hung there, dragging against the edge of the reactor where the skin clung to the casing, and Steve traced the pad of his thumb over the slight indentations that spelled out his name over the thing that was now Tony’s heart.  Maybe it was the other way around, Tony thought as Steve rubbed the flat of the tag lightly over the round arc that held the reactor. Metal on metal, Tony thought.  Conductivity.  “Like a star,” Steve said, eyes locked on Tony.
Steve watched Tony swim for the shore. He was avoiding Steve’s question, as he had before, but Steve didn’t push him. There was no point, he realized with a sigh, and turned to follow.
“What—what do you mean?” Steve asked, a confused frown furrowing his brow.
“Of course, it hasn’t changed. What possible reason would Alphas have to change that little nuance?  Why would you think I wouldn’t want to vote my own vote?  You get to,” Tony shot back, harsher than he meant, but maybe he was a little surprised at Steve’s pearl-clutching.  Where surprised is another word for annoyed.
“Yeah, me, too,” Tony said distractedly, wishing the Malnussians weren’t so damn tall. Tony wasn’t exactly short at just under six feet, but the Malnussians were taller than Steve.
When Tony had woken the next morning, it had been to Rhodey giving him painkillers and forcing a few glasses of water down his throat. And when Rhodey had to leave several days later, it had been Steve who stepped in.
“Of course I do,” Tony told Steve. “How could I not?”
Tony’s hands moved to grip hold of Steve’s shirt. “You want this?”
Tony made the executive decision to shut up, taking solace in his drink and resolutely staring anywhere but at Steve.
. We couldn’t have you walking around like an Edward Cullen knockoff.”
This time when Tony kissed him, it wasn’t because of mistletoe (even if that sprig was still hanging over their heads). It was because he wanted to. It was because he
“It will be fine,” K’salk’adi had said. “Paired leaders do not necessarily have to continue holding all meetings together after initial discussions are over. What one partner decides is agreed on by the other; it is more convenient for us to separate and continue building good relationships.”
“You two are in a relationship and that’s why you’re the only ones who can talk with the…Melnussians?” Fury squinted up at them disbelievingly.
Tony turned his head to kiss Steve back, the touch brief before he pulled away. “Is that a plan, Winghead?”
“Just friends?” Rhodey asked, keeping his face blank.
“I don’t… I mean…” Steve sighed, sounding frustrated. “What if they could change?”
Tony tilted his head, giving him a beatific smile. “Am I?”
“It’s not like I need another suit,” Tony muttered, slathering the last of the peanut butter on his bagel. “Besides, can you see me flying around with a giant gun on my shoulder?”
Sparring was good for
But the two clearly weren’t in the closet with all the dates they had. Rhodey had seen a few tabloid covers with photos of Tony and Rogers on their outings, and those rags were
“Eh, I fudged the math a bit.” Tony shrugged. “You know what I
Did Tony have “would date Steve Rogers in a heartbeat now that I’ve considered it” stamped onto his forehead?
Steve’s stomach swam with butterflies, which probably explained the constipation.
“I’m sensing an ‘and’ here.”
The heart didn’t listen to rationalities, especially if they were reasons that didn’t make sense.
“Us,” Steve said, giving Tony a look. “You’re part of this, too, Iron Man.”
Steve had never once told him that he was interested in men. Or in anyone, actually. Steve had been a pretty insular guy who only hung out with his teammates. (Natasha had tried to set Steve up on dates; they failed pretty badly and in often hilarious ways. There’d been dumpster diving involved for one of them.)
“The last time we fought aliens I woke up in a building naked,” Bruce said.
“It’s
“I don’t know what?”
“Things changed,” Tony said, shrugging.
was he going to make sure he was.
“That didn’t sound fine. That sounded the opposite of fine to me. You could stand to sound a little more excited.”
“You and Loki were
Steve had been roped into further discussions with A’gel’fush. Tony had been about to join them when K’salk’adi pulled him aside and offered to show him the ship and some of the technology.
K’salk’adi was silent for a long moment, studying Tony with three pairs of eerie eyes. Then they nodded. “Thank you for sharing your story, Tony.” Their antennas lightened. “Our partners are here.”
Tony blinked.  Read the sentence again.  Checked the name on the top of the letter.  Tried to swallow, but his throat was closed, and he ended up choking out a wet, hacking breath.
,” Tony corrected. “But, they will one day.  I suppose then we’ll see if your system is truly any more arbitrary than ours.”
Steve!  This is where you all offer your voices of reason, talk me off the ledge, rein me in, bring me back down to earth, all that, and instead I get this Oprah feelings bullshit?  You’re coddling me because you don’t want this whole thing to go off the rails, right?  Where’s the righteous indignation at my sudden about-face on romance?  Where’s the cynical skepticism about Steve’s motives? The friendly reminder that it’s really only been a couple of days, and I’m too close to this? Matt, the subtle nod to Daddy issues and unhealthy attachments?  Come on. I’m ready.  Give it to me. I can take it.”
Tony’s smile was soft, but his eyes were fierce and intent. “That is the only dream I have, and the only future I ask,” Tony whispered, clasping his hands on the sides of Steve’s face and bringing his lips to Steve’s forehead.
When he lost J, then he’d know. That would be it.  He could run the basics of the suit himself, but, well.  That would be the time. Cut the recirculator. Float off.  Just let it end. Wouldn’t be so bad, really.
“What did he mean?” Cam asked with a frown.  “What demonstration?”
“Honey,” Steve breathed out, eyes bright with amusement and a spark of something that might be challenge. “I missed you so much.”
“And, normally, we’re done with the evening’s entertainment by now, so you can see my dilemma,” Kirk grumbled, tossing his head back and rolling his eyes dramatically.
“I—nothing.  Nothing, not—not really,” Howard stammered, glancing around the room and not seeming to find many friends by the way his face fell for a moment, before the mask slipped back into place.  “Tony, you know I didn’t mean to do that.  You know that, right? I would never do that.  You know that.  Tell them.  Go on.  Tell your Aunt Peggy.  Come on, she’s gonna think I’m a bad guy or something.”
“I’m asking…Tony, he’s a good man.  I told you that,” Rhodes reminded him. “But, you make him want to be a
Go figure, he thought, recalling all the times Steve spent sitting in his workshop, listening to Tony blather on about whatever project he was working on.  He thought about the book on electrical engineering sitting on Steve’s bookshelf, and realized, as he walked past the giftshop with a number of art books on display in the window, that Steve had wanted to try to understand something of Tony’s world.  There was something truly heartbreaking about thinking about Steve sitting in his room, trying to share something of what Tony loved just because Tony loved it, with no expectation that it would ever mean anything to Tony.  Somehow, that made it mean all the more.  He stopped in front of the display long enough to snap a photo.  He could have JARVIS order the books for his tablet later.
“The headaches will pass.  We, uh, think. We’re pretty sure,” Tony said.  “Uh, Me, Bruce and Helen,” he clarified, wagging his head back and forth with a grimace.  “We think they’ll pass once—once this part is done. Okay, so you are probably appropriately freaked out right now.”
“I think they would say they do,” Steve said after a beat.  He was tapping one finger on the top of his thigh, looking down at his lap.  He opened and closed his mouth, like he wanted to say more.  It struck Tony that Steve didn’t like his answer very much, though Tony wasn’t sure why.
“Yes. Next time,” Steve said quickly, turning away from Tony as he walked towards the large window that still held the newly liberated reddish-orange moon in view.
Oh, it wasn’t like Steve didn’t know that there were men who weren’t much better than a forest beast, but that didn’t mean he was just going to turn tail and run, not anymore. Hadn’t he proven that tonight? He had, he decided, squaring his shoulders a bit. The man smiled at that, he noticed, and he decided that, really, the man didn’t
“Right, well, anyway, that was only the one time. And you’re the idiot who stepped between us when Steve was clearly my Omega and we were Bonded,” Tony reminded Fury with a disapproving shake of his head. It was really hard to remember why he shouldn’t throw the man, to be honest. It turned Steve on, whatever he might say, and Tony found it satisfying, but Fury had brought a diaper cake and that was really fucking cute. God, parenting had so many moral quandaries, he thought with a heavy sigh. “Besides, I apologized.”
“You want me to go?” Steve frowned.  “Won’t they…I mean, won’t they wonder…?” He really didn’t know what he was asking.  Won’t they wonder if I’m a hooker seemed offensive to both him and Tony, so he just left it.
Tony could feel his skin prickling at the scrutiny Steve was trying to hide, every movement suddenly a question. Was this the right way to sit, to look, to breath?  He could feel the pressure to react the right way crawl up his spine and settle, heavy, like a stone, against the base of his neck.  He wants me to like it.  Really wants it, Tony realized with a jolt of surprise that felt a little like pain, though he wasn’t sure who it was for.
“Hmm? Oh, right,” Steve said with a nod and walked over to jerk the door to Rhodey’s cell open with a sharp, scraping clank.  “Sorry, James.”
“Working on setting up a visit?  Tony Stark is working on setting up a visit?” Fury demanded incredulously.
“I like you.  Okay.  You’re a good person. Better than…better than a lot of people. I like you, and whatever happens here, I want you to be okay,” Tony said after a moment.  He wasn’t looking at Steve when he said it, though he raised his eyes up to Steve’s as the next course appeared and the waiter went through what they were eat. Steve watched as Tony rubbed his lips together, swiped a hand over them, then picked up the fork and knife and held them on either side of his plate before taking a breath and looking back at Steve.  “Eat your…er, did he say chickpea cappuccino?”
“I was thinking about Peggy,” Steve replied.  Tony ran the cloth between the fingers of Steve’s right hand, rubbing and tracing them, then over the palm, before letting go and moving on the next.  Tony’s eyes were on his task, seemingly absorbed, but not really, Steve knew.  The muscles of his stomach twitched when Tony kneaded the cloth against the taut skin there, then up, across Steve’s chest, where the discolored star would sit.
So, really, no reason to  wonder what Steve thought about it all, if maybe he looked at the marble and steel, the warm woods and Pepper’s carefully curated art collection, and wished he’d made a different choice.  As giant middle fingers to your ex went, the Tower was certainly right up there, Tony supposed, then grimaced at the thought.  We are going with this has nothing to do with Steve, he reminded himself forcefully.  Nothing.
“Captain Rogers?” the man said as he took the last few steps down to the parking area.  “Welcome to Caltech.”
worry, floated through his mind again, but he couldn’t hang on to it.  He was safe. He felt good. Everything was fine.
“How—how did he even know—how could he when I never---” Steve asked. “You—you did this?”
He heard Tony’s soft footfalls as he padded to the bathroom.  Reality slowly returned and Steve found himself blinking and struggling to get his mind back into gear.  Tony handed him a soft towel, and for a moment Steve just stared at it stupidly.  Then another thought occurred to him.  “Um…would it…would it be okay if I showered here?  Before I left, I mean?  Its just…well, the hot water in the apartment is out again and…if its okay, I mean…”  he stammered, feeling utterly ridiculous now.
The soft thunk of the door closing seemed a fitting bit of punctuation for the ending of Steve’s evening with Tony.  Steve stared at the darkened television screen a while longer.  There was just enough light from the kitchen to see his own dim, distorted reflection caught in a bright star of reflected light.  You’re seeing things, old man, Steve thought, scrubbing at his face and resolutely pushing himself off the sofa.
“Going from dancing one night to married to Tony Stark the next?  While everyone on the black market spoilers mailer list was trying to hunt down this miracle tech Stark’s supposedly peddling and he’s messing around with Stern, who’s been on the dole from Hydra for years?  Yeah, we thought that was a tad suspicious,” Clint snorted.
“Oh, you figured that out all on your own, did you?” Steve grinned.  “Proud of yourself, are you?” Shellhead nodded and slunk down, floating around Steve in a slow circle.
“Wh-what?” Steve stammered, stunned.  “But…but he…I mean, he hasn’t wanted…me…to come, I mean…not since last week…”
“Captain Rogers tells me that you have an interest in space science,” Professor Thorne continued.
“I reiterate that this whole situation could’ve been avoided by a lap dance,” Tony replied, tossing his hands in the air to punctuate his words.
“Come now, Rhodes, Asgard? Really?” Tony scoffed, shaking his head a bit. “Children’s stories and riders of the wastes? That’s what you would have me worry about? Asgard withdrew from the world after the decimation of Yo’ten, and hasn’t been heard from since. They destroyed their only connection to the mainland and burned their ships. I remember hearing my great-grandmother talk about seeing the smoke rising from fires from her window all the way across the White Sea. They’re a cautionary tale of overreach and arrogance that the old ones tell around a fire, nothing more, you know that. As for Tytahn,” Tony paused, a frown pulling at his mouth. “I’ve heard the tales. And tales are what they are, at least for now. Lord Murdock says spice traders from the East carry them with their other baggage and trade these tales just as eagerly with anyone who will buy them a flagon. Who knows what is to be believed? It makes no sense, which I seem to recall being your exact words. Why attack Xenobaris? It held nothing of value. They’re… fishers and net-makers. Peaceful. Hardly a target for plunder. Far more likely these traders are spreading rumors to raise the price of their wares on some notion of coming scarcity than that the ruler of Tytahn has suddenly decided to attack his neighbors unprovoked and without gain.”
