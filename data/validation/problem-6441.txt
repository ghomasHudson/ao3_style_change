The admission is a vindication, blossoming in his chest and relieving some of the heavy pressure on his lungs. “Thank you.”
“Mr. Stark! Hey, wait up!” Peter is rushing down the steps behind him, a flush high on his cheeks as if he’s chased Tony down at top speed and his eyes are bright with concern. Tony doesn’t know if he has the energy or the emotional capacity to deal with the kid right now, to not say something he’ll regret, or to listen to him if he needs something.
Steve grins, leaning over to press a kiss between his shoulder blades before driving his fingers down hard, right into the spot inside him that lights Tony up from the inside out. His husband—his
When the team eventually stopped coming up with foods for him, Steve decided to take up cooking. It kept everyone hanging around long enough and transformed into team board game nights, or a rousing game of cards.
It doesn’t take a shrink to tell Tony what these dreams mean, and living in a world without his partner and the kid is only living a pseudo-life, so he does his best to pretend he’s never had either. Instead, he focuses on making himself useful where he can, and on Pepper and Happy and their beautiful little daughter when he can’t. Morgan is a blessing and watching her learn and grow is a gift. She’s too smart for her own good and Tony worries after her endlessly.
“We’ll see you back in New York in two weeks. In the meantime, these are for you,” Tony shoves the first folder towards Barnes, making eye contact with him for the first time all week. Barnes eyes the folder as if it might jump out and bite him, but takes it and starts leafing through the papers.
Pepper turning up out of the blue when he’s just finished vomiting his guts up is enough to put an end to his three-week bender. The last bout of heaving isn’t from the alcohol, but from shame. It’s infinitely fouler and he’d take drying out again a hundred times over if it saves him any more of
The why of it all isn’t quite clear, and the way she switches sides so effortlessly is tormenting to no end. But she’s had his back when it’s counted in the past, and despite himself, he misses her. Misses what they’d just started to carve out, before it’d all gone to shit.
; here physically, but Steve can’t be sure that the Bucky Barnes he knew will ever return completely.
Sweat trickles down the back of his neck, and nervous energy rushes through him like fissions of energy up and down his spine. There’s waiting, and then there’s
Natasha genuinely seemed to want him to enjoy what she brought, depositing slivers of baklava and delicate little kartoshka. Last week she had produced a dense little cake he couldn’t remember the name of – something that tasted like bananas and hailed from Spain.
“I wish you had said something sooner. Jim mentioned–but, I just figured when he hadn’t brought it up again that maybe it had been a one-off. You’ve got to let us help you when things get this bad, Tony. We can, and we will.”
“You said you wanted wagon wheels for dinner.” Nat offered evenly. Her face was carefully blank but there was an obvious smile in her voice. “I guess when we all think ‘Stark’ and ‘Italian’, wagon wheels are the first thing that comes to mind.”
Tony pulls back, giving him a disapproving look. “I can hear you thinking from here. What could you possibly be thinking about right now aside from coming all over my face?”
What should he even care about Steve’s comings and goings? He doesn’t, he tells himself, not really.
The shove Steve got back jostled Tony’s head in his lap, dislodging a disgruntled grumble from his throat. The alphas settled around him, predictably so.
Steve’s breathing hitched and he arched forward, coming with a bitten off moan as streaks of cloudy-white overtook the red and gold fabric, seeping into the faceplate and covering the little arc reactor. It just kept coming as Steve emptied himself onto the puppet, stroking himself through every aftershock until he was shaking and desperate to catch his breath.
“Fine.” Tony throws one of the arrow tips onto the workbench with an underlying petulance and leans back opposite to her, plucking the coffee from her hands. Without breaking eye contact, he takes a long, scorching pull.
Everyone together for this; Wanda and Vision, Scott and Clint all seated around the table already, with Bucky and Rhodey arguing about something with Nat in the living room, arms waving in animation.
Steve grimaces, clocking how Tony takes intention breaths, deep and slow. Everything in him wants to scream why Steve is wrong, and that’s not true. Tony has always,
“Steve, stop pacing,” Pepper says, voice tight with strain as another wave of contractions ripple through her. “You’re making my head spin.”
They forgo any food and Peter chats idly with FRIDAY for a few minutes while Tony waffles in the Compound kitchen, the liquor bottles on the counter, and the beer chilling in the fridge a siren’s call. There’d been a time when the Compound had been almost dry, personal suites being one of the few exceptions, and Tony supposes that he can’t expect things to continue that way. Still, he wonders if Steve had even given a second thought to the bottles, knowing Tony would be coming this evening.
In all reality, Steve can’t imagine another loss. The way he’d fallen in love with Peter had been immediate and surprising. This young man, so uncertain, so desperate for affection and praise, and Steve had loved him just as much as Tony had.
He closed his eyes and drew a breath, fumbling for a hand on the doorknob to throw the door open. “Tony I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Please believe me. I love you!”
Except then they’d defeated an invading alien race and Steve decided that now he’d definitely seen it all. Or at least he hoped, because he was a surprisingly sore loser and losing ten bucks to Fury was more than enough already.
.” His hand tightens in Tony’s hair and Tony dips forward, nosing against the crease of his thigh before sucking him down, hollowing his cheeks and creating that tight, hot suction that drives Steve wild.
The battle rages on around them, but it’s like they’re the only two people that exist. They reach for the gauntlet together. Steve slams an elbow into Tony’s chest, forcing him back.
“You giving out olive-branch flip phones to all the people you fuck over, Cap? Here I was thinking I was special. Obviously, it’s me.”
Steve laughs, genuinely laughs and Tony can’t help but crack a smile too, even if he is wildly confused and a little concerned about the possibility of Skrulls. As if he hadn’t had enough to worry about, before Captain Marvel had started telling him tales.
“It’s Cap’s birthday.” Tony said immediately before the rest could beat him to it. “The entire country shuts down and everyone gets out their flags and worships Cap like a God.”
“So what are you going to do differently? Tell me, Steve. Look me in the eye and tell me how sorry you are for ruining our fucking marriage while you sit here and change absolutely nothing.” Tony huffs out a breath, incredulous even when he hasn’t paused long enough to give Steve a chance to respond. That’s half the point. “Ridiculous. This whole fucking thing. Because you’re not really sorry, are you? If you were sorry, things would be so different right now.”
“Alpha,” Tony whimpered, Bucky making the slow press into his hole before he slid home, thrusting deep into him. Oh, if that wasn’t perfect.
“What even are wagon wheels?” Steve muttered, exasperatedly to himself, leaving the assassins to a heated debate over meatballs vs. tortellini vs. alfredo sauce.
It’s clear what the focus is though. Right in the middle of the photograph, sitting on his ass in a massive wooden pen with a broad, genuine grin on his face, is Steve. He has an armful of goats and one has the bottom of his shirt in his mouth, mid-chew, but he’s laughing all the same.
Steve hadn’t scented much before the war, and even afterward the serum, his scent was always light and sweet like the slivers of chocolate they’d get at base around Christmastime. Bucky had never experienced him smelling like
“How are you feeling?” Pepper rubs the sleep from her eyes, leaving a smudge of mascara that veers off to the right side of one cheekbone. It’s perfectly imperfect, like the little knot of hair that’s formed from where she’s been lying against the seatback.
Yes, it’s far more than he deserves, but oh how Tony loves this beautiful, maddening man. Steve’s forgiveness is bittersweet on his tongue and he swallows it down anyways, letting it spread warmth through the hollow space inside him.
“Can you package that up for us?” Tony calls across the shop just as Steve catches the shop owner’s eyes skittering away. “And if you keep what you just saw to yourself, I think you’ll find the tip will more than cover all your renovations.”
He was lying on his stomach, face turned away from the window in a wild sprawl across the sheets. Like an octopus, Tony had gathered the blankets and pillows into his arms, clutching them in his sleep and Steve’s chest twinged with a familiar ache when he realized all the pillows Tony had wrapped himself around were from Steve’s side of the bed.
Tony whines Steve’s name, long and high, thrusting counter to his rhythm for a little extra friction that makes his eyes roll back. Steve grips them tighter and all at once he’s right there on the edge.
Tony sighs, closing his eyes. “Because what you’re trying to do with these other memories… it’s, I guess it’s because you’re trying to prevent that last memory from happening, right? You’re trying to tell him – me – before everything goes to shit?”
“Tony.” Pepper must be smiling across the phone line, a disapproving smirk teasing across her mouth because her tone is a gentle, playful warning. “Happy’s good. We’re great. He misses you.” The
As if Tony could possibly think that this just happened; that he’d been passing by on the right day, at the right time. Steve wasn’t that much of a fool. Even if his faith had wavered with the appearance of aliens and Norse Gods, he was still certain. This was destiny. Fate, even.
All the memories are clear in Steve’s mind as if they’d happened yesterday. He can taste Tony’s lips, smeared with honey, and feel the secure vice of Tony’s arm wrapped around his waist as they roll through the sky. He remembers saying goodbye to Peggy together and the way Tony had loved Bucky even after everything.
Steve hates the comparison; he doesn’t even bother hiding it. “Is that what this is about? You think we’re, what? Your parents?”
“Okay,” Tony repeats. “Well, I definitely wasn’t expecting—” He breaks off, shaking his head in disbelief. “Yeah. I love you, too. It’s always been you, Steve.”
He drops down, all his weight collapsing onto the cool leather, before he gives Tony a grateful look.
Somehow, that’s worse. Tony, loving Steve more than he can bear or ever hope to understand. And with a damned fucked up way of showing it. Shame layers into Steve’s grief, the last stone that crushes him into oblivion even though Steve can’t remember whispering
“Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it, Barnes,” Tony waggles his eyebrows at Steve, and the heat on his neck surges up to his cheeks. “I’m sure Steve could tell you a thing or two about that.”
He wishes he’d had the mind to fuck Steve instead; hurt Steve the way Steve will never hurt him, even when he begs for it.
Out of the corner of his eye he can imagine Tony at the coffee machine, hands flying like little birds that light on coffee mugs and bags of fancy, dark roast beans. When he looks over, the kitchen is empty but Steve’s chest feels full and content.
“Not the sparring, Steve. This.” He gestures between them, and then it dawns on Steve like slow boiling water.
“We need to learn to work together again.” Rhodey picks up, leaning forward with his hands on the conference room table. “There was a time where we worked together well, flawlessly, even. It’s going to take practice and time to get there again, time we’re sorely lacking.”
“We’ve been in consultation with the Wakandans who are prepared to fight with us. The Masters of the Mystic Arts are prepared to join us as well, wherever the attack launches. But we’re still down two key players, without so much as a lead in over a year. We’re almost certainly outnumbered and our team is fractured, at best.”
“I think there’s something else I’d like to bring out of you.” Tony hand dips down and grips him hard on the ass, yanking him in.
“You’re a menace.” Steve whines, already rubbing up against his thigh again, hard and thick. That glorious super soldier perk. “Tomorrow. You promise? No running away.”
This is something good. Tony wants him to know that this is something good. His nails dig into Steve’s chest through his shirt, and Steve’s eyes drop down to his mouth, a perfect row of teeth and the little laugh lines that frame his lips.
He had. Peggy had been overjoyed, her eyes shining with an emotion he hadn’t quite been able to place, and it made sense now. If she’d known Tony, if she’d watched him grow—watched him struggle—that knowing smile was suddenly a key in the lock.
When he opened his eyes Tony was right there, looking up at him with an air of confidence that didn’t match the mixture of uncertainty and hope in his eyes. It burned through Steve’s belly like a lit match.
“Steve. Steve. Let go.” Steve’s hands fly back and come up to cover his face instead, as if he can’t bear to look Tony in the eye after everything.
There’s something in him nagging at him that Tony will trust him if he tells him. He could tell him, hell, maybe he
He takes a moment to weigh Steve’s response in his mind and considers that the worst-case scenario is Steve tells him he would have known better later, if Tony is unhappy. Although he isn’t certain he’ll be unhappy sans burnt arm and it gives him a new project to work on. Whatever he’s already built for Barnes, he can improve on a hundred times over for himself.
God, he’s missed this. The joy. The laughter. Everything feels bright and boisterous. Steve curls in towards it, tugging Tony up against his chest to bury his face in his hair.
As Steve drifted off again, the smell of rich, creamy coffee swelled around him. It was a beautiful thing they’d managed to find here and though Tony didn’t linger often in the mornings; he relished these small, soft moments hidden away from the world with his mates safely tucked against his side.
“What?” Steve demands, going for disparaging, but Tony’s smile is infectious. Before Steve can help himself, he’s returning it.
“How about you wait and see before you start making complaints about my performance, alright Nat? I’ve certainly never had any complaints before.”
The dam breaks and Steve lets it all go, clinging to Tony like a drowning man. He drags Tony down with him, down below the surface of the water where everything is cold and black and nothing should survive except, they’re down there together and that can be enough for survival. Tony brushes a hand through Steve’s hair and cradles his head. He’d breathe his last breath into this man if it just meant he’d live even a second longer.
All the while, Steve never stops rolling his hips. Never stops slipping in and out of Tony’s body, caressing him from the inside out as if he can chase away the grief with pleasure. It’s bittersweet, the slick slide of Steve in his ass even as his heart is cracking all over again.
He’s never going to let Tony go. He never wants to wake up. He never wants to take another breath when Tony isn’t there to share it with him.
“It’s almost time.” Pepper’s hand slides across his shoulder and he realizes he’s glaring holes into the back of Steve’s suit.
“I didn’t want–god, I am so sorry. I never meant for that. I only wanted to stop you; Tony I swear. And I almost – I can’t believe I – Tony, I’m sorry. I should have known better. Hell, I did know better. I remember thinking ‘it’s the suit, just power down the suit and it’ll all stop’. But I know you’re not invincible, and I did it anyway. I’m–I am so sorry.”
One minute, Steve is standing beside Natasha and the next, he’s underwater. There’s water in his lungs and he’s drowning. He can’t breathe, he can’t think, and JARVIS is here telling him that Tony is dead when he was just—when Tony was just—
Steve leaned back in his chair, relaxing into the easy discussion and ignoring the pointed look that he could feel Bucky burning into the side of his head. If he met his eye, it would be all too obvious that they were sharing a similar thought.
In retaliation, Tony reaches up and twists one of his nipples until Steve’s worrying at his lower lip, and his eyes are falling closed again.
With another gag, Tony thrusts in deeper, down into the hollow of Steve’s throat until he cuts off Steve’s air completely. He stays there, and just as Steve’s vision starts to blur at the edges, he pulls back, giving Steve just enough time for one gasping breath before he fucks back into the hilt.
Steve sketches quickly, capturing the way Tony’s hands cut through the air as he tosses little bits and pieces into the stir fry he’s making for dinner. Just like everything else, Tony cooks like he’s putting on a show, and Steve smiles to himself, head ducked low to capture a series of arches that form the curve of Tony’s jaw, the tilt of his head.
“You can. I know you can. You’ve got people, Steve. Sam, Barnes. Just listen, okay? Listen.” Tony has to stop, because he’s already dangerously close to begging and who cares about politics and card games anymore.
It’s a ridiculous fantasy, something reserved for children—one he had, in a different form, when he was a child himself—but he holds tight hoping that one day Steve might prove him wrong.
They part ways outside the diner and Tony meanders back to the hotel slowly. Their accommodations wouldn’t have been his first choice or even his second, but it’s comfortable enough despite the vivid green walls. The owners must have done something horrible to their interior designer.
Steve grinned into his shoulder, biting softly at the skin just below his gland and making him cry out. “No. Tony, no.”
Eventually they move out to the lake house. There’s nothing more they can do in New York. The leads have run dry, and at some point, the realization has settled in. They’ve lost. Irrevocably.
It was more out of self-preservation than anything else, as he wandered into the communal space to find Tony half on top of Steve, perched on his thighs. They did this more often these days, the bridge between them rebuilt from the ashes.
The sheets crinkle as he shifts, brittle and paper-thin, and Tony slides over to the side of the mattress making what room he can in the meager space. It’s heartbreaking to see Steve this way, just a shell of the man he knew.
Every breath feels like shattered glass stretching through his chest cavity. Maybe this is what the shrapnel felt like in Tony’s, except he’s relatively certain that this pain is his shattered ribs, sliding around in his chest before the serum can stitch him back together.
Steve in the back of his mind as he reached for it, cracking open the door and letting the toe-curling pleasure of Steve’s hot mouth radiate back into his own mind.
Steve will probably remember forever, the lucky bastard, because one moment they’re trying to sleep, Tony’s hand tangled in the hair at the back of Steve’s neck as Steve’s warm breath flares around the reactor, and the next they’re kissing.
“How long?” Tony croaks, eyes searching the ground as if it holds the answers. “How long have you known?”
When he’s dreamed about him before, Tony is always older and recalled from the part of his mind where Tony will remember Ultron and Siberia, all the secrets that Steve has kept along the way.
The blunt head of Tony’s cock pushes into him and Steve feels made whole. In Tony’s arms he’s alive, reaching up to touch the sun and bottle the clouds. “Tell me again, Tony. Please,” he begs, tugging gently at the hair at the nape of Tony’s neck.
Tony groans, an intoxicating sound that beelines straight to Steve’s cock. He wants to hear it again. He wants to hear it on a loop alongside breathy moans and the way Tony’s voice cracks into a whine when lips struggle to wrap around Steve’s name.
“Why don’t you give Bucky a call and let him know the arm’s almost ready?” Tony nudges him back towards the holograms waiting for his attention.
The other room was more tactile, filled with old fashioned, plush furniture and ridiculous things like bean bag chairs and a mountain of blankets you could drown in if you weren’t careful. FRIDAY had been a valuable consultant, helping Tony to fill the room with anything that might be helpful when it came to ‘self-care,’
They’re just on vacation, a few steps removed from their responsibilities, and the sun is hot and bright in the sky. When they get home, the team will be there waiting for them, and everything will be back to normal.
“Flatterer,” Tony lets his head dip back and his eyes close as the pleasure builds. “I’m going to put a mirror on the ceiling for you so you have to look at yourself. See what I see.”
Tony laughed freely, relishing the flare of possessiveness as the pair leaned over him. Steve was perfect like that, eyes dark and blown black, giving over to that hindbrain desire to claim and mark and
“Right,” Tony says, “he just seems… I don’t know, skittish almost. It’s super weird to see him that way.”
It’s all politics, with Captain America’s face and Tony Stark’s name. A match made in heaven; the perfect end to a so-called Civil War.
Tony had stuttered through the beginning, but found his footing quickly enough. He busied himself with explaining the procedures and the mechanisms, science far beyond anything Bucky could comprehend. Tony asked about his goats, and had Bucky describe life in Wakanda in great detail to fill the time and space.
and his chest constricts, lungs dragging air through the spaces between Tony’s fingers. It’s not enough. He’ll choke on it.
The conversations became repeats of the same, a broken, stunted cycle as Steve struggled to put his thoughts together, and Bucky never truly resurfaced as the man he remembered. Sam seemed well enough but Steve found himself torn between guilt and resentment because every time Sam came striding into the room, he found himself wishing Sam were Natasha.
“Be safe while I’m gone,” Steve reminds him. He pauses at the window, eyes lingering on some unfixed location out on the horizon.
“I’m sorry!” The words are almost a shout because he is, and Tony’s gearing up for a fight. The kind of fight where he’s hurt and ready to dig in deep, but it’s not worth it. After everything, it's not worth it. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean—I’m sorry. You caught me off guard, and I didn’t mean that.”
It wasn’t ever about anyone having to hate Steve or treat him like dirt on Tony’s behalf. He just wants that same respect paid to him in kind. A little balance. Frankly, at this point, he’ll settle for a begrudging respect for his opinions instead of the entire write off he’s been handed.
The light from the chest plate was an eerie glow, following Steve’s body down like a homing beacon and Tony prayed he would reach him in time.
He kisses him, and keeps kissing him, until Tony has him backed up against the far wall, the suit bearing all of his weight as he wraps his legs around Tony’s hips and holds on.
When he leans forward, he thinks he’s going to kiss Steve gently, a soft press of the lips after so long apart.
Groaning, Tony heaves over and rolls sideways off the bed, fishing around on the floor for his boxers and tugging them up over his hips. The rest of his clothes follow, and Steve lays there watching him, eyes cloudy.
Bucky is straightening his tie, a dark, silky red piece that Tony’s picked for him when he hears it.
He leans in and takes it from her hand, nipping her fingers as he does, and she shrieks with laughter, squirming in the high chair.
“Okay,” Tony says, buying for time while realization dawns slower than the beginning of time. “Okay, maybe I’ve miscalculated here—”
All he knows is that two plus two is four and Steve Rogers making decisions for him means things are headed south and he’s not sticking around long enough to get hurt this time. Not any more than he already is, with his wounded pride and his brittle heart held together by the sheer force of his will.
“I’m never letting you go,” Tony says, lips pressed to his ear. “Aunt Peg’s the smartest woman I’ve ever known. I’m never letting you go now, Steve.”
“Tony—” But Tony’s already in motion, pushing back through the screen door and snapping orders to FRIDAY to seal down the workshop before he’s even in the elevator.
As if Tony doesn’t already know that. Isn’t that what so much of this has been about? Living underneath the weight of Steve Roger’s expectations has always been more than even the Iron Man armour could bear. Sometimes, those expectations don’t feel like they’re even about Tony at all.
“Of course, I told them! You heard the woman. Get up here, Pops.” Tony waves him forward as Pepper gives a wet laugh from one contraction to the next.
Steve leans forward with a smile and presses a kiss to Tony’s mouth. When he pulls back, Tony’s eyes are dancing, sparkling with light, and something so joyous makes Steve’s chest squeeze.
“I can be good. For you.” Tony purred in his ear, fingers curling in the back of his hair to drag him down again.
Pulled up on his toes, Steve’s plastered up against Tony from knees to chest and it would be nothing to lean in and kiss him. He misses Tony with an unexpected ferocity, like a piece of his soul has chipped off and stayed behind, locked inside Tony’s chest where the arc reactor used to hum.
JARVIS rattles off a series of coordinates that mean next to nothing, doling out another layer of snark when he points Tony in the direction of one of the high rises to the east. The rooftop is a few stories below the penthouse, and Barnes must want Tony to see him, because he does nothing to conceal himself.
Tony searches Steve’s face. It’s not what he’s been expecting, Steve has caught him completely off guard and challenged him in a way he’s not used to but welcomes with open arms because Steve is right. There’s no shame in it, and Tony’s never been the biggest fan of hypocrisy.
They haven’t talked about what was said a few days ago. They haven’t talked about the letters, or the fact that Steve still hasn’t left the hospital grounds, and they certainly haven’t talked about the fact that when the visiting hours end and Tony’s streamline of guests dries up, Steve curls up in Tony’s hospital bed and holds him until morning.
Tony falls onto the mattress, tugging Steve down until he’s covering Tony from head to toe, soaking up every point of contact his body can find. The hair on Tony’s calves rasp against his thigh as Tony wraps a leg around Steve’s hip and the arc reactor bites sharply into his chest.
“It’s like this, okay,” Tony starts, and he knows this might not go over well, but, “I had this memory of the last time I saw my parents alive I couldn’t get past. I tried not to remember it for the better part of a few decades. But B.A.R.F. allowed me to replay it over and over again until I was able to make it into something else. Actually, say goodbye to them, tell them how I felt, you know?”
The metaphor isn’t lost on him, as he rides the high of adrenaline of reconciliation all the way into a new Mark of the Iron Man boots. If only he could survive on this feeling alone, he’d never crave for another drop of booze again in his life.
“Seriously, why do you look like that?” Tony draws closer and Steve’s body feels ready to give out. When he sways on his feet, Tony darts out to catch him under one arm. “This is not your best look. One out of ten. I don’t even want to know what America’s ass is looking like these days.”
“Damn right,” Tony agrees, laughing as he fishes around for a clean towel and starts mopping up his face. “Feel better now?”
“—I did not feel it was appropriate to interrupt. However, you should be aware that the Soldier did attempt to hack into the audio system without success approximately twenty minutes ago. He is still observing.”
Pleasure starts to curl again, lead in his stomach as Steve folds him in half, angling deeper until he finds Tony’s sweet spot over and over. There’s a steady stream of desperate little moans that Tony realizes belong to him, and he feels himself start to unravel around the edges. Release hangs just beyond reach and it’d be so easy to float away on it.
Somehow, two of the deadliest assassins he knows, both well equipped with excellent poker faces, can’t even fake it for two minutes to cut him some slack.
When they’re both fully dressed, the cooling come on their stomachs swept away with a conveniently placed box of Kleenex Steve discovered, he leads Tony into the room next door.
“It’s not like I’m thrilled about it,” Tony grumbles under his breath, and Pepper smiles, shaking her head. She’s so good to him. Always.
“If you’re pissed all the time, you’ll be useless in training, and on the field. I can set aside a little disagreement, but I won’t trust my teammate to watch my six if he shows up to a mission drowning in booze.” Little disagreement, Tony’s ass.
Tony sighs, rubbing at the ache that’s taken up permanent residence behind the arc reactor. Ironic, now that it’s back, it seems committed to reminding Tony of all the painful memories that brought it barrelling back into Tony’s chest.
“Don’t ever let him go, Steve,” Peggy had said, a papery hand covering his. “Love him, marry him, whatever you want. But don’t ever let him go.”
Tony’s furious because Steve hasn’t learned one measly thing and for a man who claims to be the hero of the ‘little guy’, Steve does a piss-poor job of showing it. The hypocrisy alone should be enough to bury Steve alive.
Sweating and gasping, he gags harshly and throws the blankets back. Fully expecting to pitch sideways and vomit onto the carpet, Tony scrubs a hand over his clammy face and shudders.
A flash of Tony, lying cold on the concrete assaults him and Steve sobs, gripping the hand around his throat and squeezing down. Tony groans again, deeper, giving in and tightening his fingers around Steve’s windpipe as his thrusts grow more erratic, biting down on Steve’s shoulder and panting against his shoulder.
Pepper presses her palm into his cheek and he leans his head into the comforting caress. He’s trying not to hide or lash out, but without those two basic defenses, what is he?
“A weighted blanket. We can order you a heavier one, if you wanted. They’re supposed to correlate with your body weight, or at least that’s what FRIDAY says, and I’m sure the whole super soldier thing means that you’d actually benefit from something that was a little heavier than that. Or next time you could pile a couple more on, maybe? But like, don’t smother yourself because that’s absolutely not the point. Unless you’re in that kind of mood, I guess, no judgement. Been there.”
Steve takes one massive step back but his eyes flash and his posture is ramrod straight. That is, until his eyes clock the way that Tony’s left hand is shaking at his side and his eyes fly up. The tension in Steve’s body drains onto the pavement and in seconds there’s no fight left in him.
Steve’s careful not to loom over him, but his hands are a vice at his hips when he slides to the ground at the edge of the bed and takes Tony into his mouth. It’s a small decency that Steve fills him back up with his fingers, stroking across his prostrate in harsh pulls as he sucks him.
It feels wrong. He tries to take a breath, but the cold creeps in on him out of nowhere. The room is warm and comfortable, so it must be psychosomatic but Steve can’t feel his fingertips. The ice waits to swallow him whole, dark and frigid, and reflexively, his grip tightens on Tony’s forearm.
It isn’t anything as romantic as one letter for every day of the year, like Pepper’s favourite romantic comedy Tony’s been forced to sit through too many times. It started with one, the only letter that Tony ever opened, and was followed by ten more. The twelfth never came.
“Oh, can Stark afford it? Let’s talk about how Stark can afford it when Stark is busy paying for your room and board, the fancy new gadgets you’re so fond of destroying, and everything else your feathered ass desires.” Tony shot back without heat.
They hadn’t spoken about it since, Bucky smoothing everything over with soft words and murmured apologies.
Tony grunts, slamming into him. He moans out some semblance of Steve’s name and comes, whispering that he loves Steve as he pulses deep inside him. It feels like a lie but Tony’s still saying it, over and over again; he loves Steve anyway.
“It’s okay Queens.” His voice cracks. He grips Peter’s arm tighter, anchoring him to the Earth. He’ll replace gravity if he has to. “It’s okay. You’re going to be okay.”
Steve’s always known his biggest secret was his own cowardice. It always has been, even when he’d fought, even when he’d committed himself to doing what was right. He’d tried to tell Tony about his parents when the helicarriers had gone down, but the words had twisted between his ribs and refused to come out. He told Tony more than he thought he ever would, but not about his parents.
A hundred possible responses come to mind and Tony settles on cold and detached, offering Steve a roll of his eyes and a shrug. “That’ll happen to you sometimes.”
Even if Steve had been the one to send the phone, he doubts Steve actually expected Tony would call. And of course, Steve never called.
The asshole had already admitted that he wasn’t sorry when he’d sent that half-cocked letter, all justification, denial and placation. So, it wouldn’t be anything to do with apologies, or closure, or learning how to be a decent human being. No, if anything, he was easing the way to move on and forget Tony altogether. To forget that their time together has ever mattered in the first place.
Everything goes hot and cold and Tony can’t focus, can’t breathe. There’s nothing more than Steve inside him, the cold glass against him and the orgasm rattling towards him like a train while the whole city watches.
Maybe it’s something about the fact that they’re on vacation—that Tony wants him enough to take him away for an entire week to themselves, but Steve feels lighter than air.
He swings by the workshop one afternoon and gruffly offers an apology for ‘how things went down’, asking Tony if he might want to join him up on the roof sometime soon to run some drills. The moving targets in the gym just aren’t cutting it these days, Clint claims absently, before he’s out the door as quickly as he’d come.
“Yeah, you’re right. I—damn.” Tony shoots him a sheepish look and squeezes his forearm. The unilateral decision to run for the hills feels like a small error now, and Tony sets it aside for review later. Now, other focuses require his attention. “I fucked up. I’m sorry, too.”
“I’m not making you any stupid promises now, Rogers. You goddamn martyr. If we make it out of this, I’m going to drop you off a goddamn cliff myself. Or chain you to the bed for the rest of your natural life. You
In the next memory, Tony is angry. He doesn’t remember this one, or what he’s so angry about, but he’s got a hand wrapped around one of Steve’s thick wrists, fingers tight.
The answer seems to surprise them both for a moment, and Pepper’s eyebrows creep up a few notches but she doesn’t challenge him. Instead, she gives him a firm nod, shifts until she’s far enough over the bed that she can press a kiss to his forehead, and runs her fingers briefly through his hair.
Bruce is flat on his ass on the ground, arm freshly burnt to hell. Peter’s aghast, eyes whipping between them as Tony raises his hand and—
Steve laughs, a pure and genuine laugh. “So much better.” But he hesitates. “Tell me again you’re not going to regret this tomorrow.”
It had ended after they’d been in bed together one night, the same as any of the other few dozen times over a series of rapid weeks that blurred into months. Tony had been almost content, driving into the warmth of her body over and over again with one of her hands gripped into his hip, urging him on. He’d nosed at her throat and whispered in her ear to look at him when she came and when she glanced up—
Steve gets another flash from New York, Tony’s wide, panicked eyes asking him, “please tell me nobody kissed me?” And Steve laughing, confirming that wasn’t the case and then remedying the error after they’d eaten their fill of shawarma.
“I don’t sleep without you.” Steve gasps into his shirt. “I can’t. The nightmares—I’ve tried everything. Sometimes I think I’ll go insane with it. Just tell me how you do it. Maybe I can—”
Steve chokes on a breath, the colour fading from his cheeks. For a minute, Tony wonders if he’s going to be sick.
“I resent that, JARVIS, you two-bit doorbell.” Tony warned, but the smile gave away his affection. “Throw it in Capsicle’s Birthday Surprise.”
Steve pitches sideways, bracing himself on the nearest tree with a forearm and retches into the dirt. He heaves until it all comes up then drags the back of his arm across his mouth and spits.
Later, Steve will remember this as the exact moment when he stepped out of his own body and started to drift away.
“I didn’t even realize how much I needed it,” Steve says quietly. “It’s been a part of you for so long.”
“No, of course I’m not really thinking of offing myself, Jesus.” Tony knows when he’s being an asshole and right now, he’s treading on thin ice, preparing to push away one of the few good people left in his life.
Steve paused at the curious look on Bucky’s face. “That… you didn’t take them, right? This isn’t another prank war starting?”
“Not fair, I didn’t know we were using drones!” Sam laughs, laying flat on his back on the mats as Peter hangs suspended from the ceiling above him.
His tie is askew because he’s been playing with it on and off throughout the session this afternoon, and the vein that runs along his forehead and disappears down the left side of his face is defined and pulsing.
There’s been sightings of the Rogues in Eastern Europe and the Council doesn’t know what to make of it all as the weeks stretch into months and they still haven’t been brought to justice. Unease stirs between the various governments. What if something comes and the Rogues are needed? What if the rebellion of so many of the Enhanced was worth turning a kind ear towards?
Pepper wails through a series of vicious pushes. Her body contracts and goes rigid, the tendons all along her body straining with effort. For a moment it doesn’t look like she’ll be successful, collapsing back against the pillows with a little sob that makes Steve’s heart ache for her, but the next wave comes on quickly. She rears back forward, gripping them both until Tony is cursing under his breath and curling around her, a hand on her back as if he can somehow help her through this.
When Steve’s entire body recoils from the joke he flinches, Steve shaking his head and offering a watery half-smile.  “That’s not funny, Tony.”
“You can go.” Pepper steers him over to one of the corners and Tony hates how fast he jumps at the idea of playing the coward, prepared to run and hide from the world. When had he become this man who loses ground in a handful of ill-spoken moments, and his temper even faster?
Steve resists the ridiculous urge to press his hand over the glass, painfully aware of Pepper and Rhodes watching him. They care about him, and he knows this. He and Tony have been together long enough now that Tony’s friends have become his friends too, but he still has his reservations. When it’s not their team, Steve feels on edge. He wishes he didn’t, but he does. He keeps his hand to himself and drops his gaze.
Steve’s face swims before his eyes and he squints into the sun until black swirls and flickers of colour whisk it away. One day, home and New York and Steve won’t be synonymous and Tony will be able to tolerate the city again.
He sighed, forcing himself off the bench by the window and back to his bed with the crisp white sheets and perfect corners.
“Tony?” Steve tries again. He lays a hand on Tony’s shoulder to pull him into his arms. They have to tend to the others. They have to account for the dead. They have to—
The admission surprises them both, and whether he knows it or not, Steve gives his whole hand away. He shifts forward, so their knees are almost touching, and the grief comes rushing back up to the surface, darkening his beautiful features.
He cradles his last link to Tony in his palms and crawls into his too-big bed. When he curls under the duvet, he draws his knees to his chest and pulls the blanket over his head. With a click, the familiar blue light comes on, warm and welcoming.
But he couldn’t bring himself to stop, jerking off in earnest now in a race towards the finish line. In the end, the shame always lost, because this was Tony and Steve needed him more than he needed air to breathe.
“I never meant for any of this to happen.” He ignores the question. “I just want us to be accountable to something more than ourselves. And you know what kills me? That’s not even what this is all about for me. I can handle a little political disagreement. Hell, I’m not even in full support of the damned Accords.” Tony looks up then and pins her with a glare. He’s going there before he can stop himself. “You knew, didn’t you?”
“I think you’ll find you like me cocky.” Tony grinned back, thrusting against him from where he sat up on his knees, one hand under the hem of his shirt, the other buried in Steve’s hair. Tony was hard, rutting into the divot of his lower back and setting his stomach alight with desire.
“I wish I could forget what you looked like the day I married you. And fuck if I don’t wish I could forget your voice saying ‘I’ve been with other people’ even though I know you hadn’t. I know it, even if you won’t ever admit it. I know you wouldn’t—not while we were still married—but hell if I don’t hear that over and over in my head and it’s—” Steve’s voice cracks and breaks off, a hand coming up to rub across his eyes and press into his temples.
He’d never told another soul, not even Peggy, when the smell of vanilla cream started to drift away, releasing its grip on Steve’s clothing. He’d tried to drink himself into a stupor when he realized that eventually, one day, it’d be the last time.
An arc of heat and light slices through the aliens threatening to overtake Clint and Natasha fighting a few feet away from them, and bodies drop to the ground around them.
If Steve could just admit that maybe, for once in his life, this had been his error and not Tony’s. It couldn’t always be Tony. There was a hell of a lot of things in this world he wasn’t certain he deserved, but he definitely knew he deserved better than this.
The Avengers call a meeting at the Compound, restored for the second time since its creation, and Tony sits silent in his chair, listening as the team devises a plan for the Infinity Stones. There’s a unanimous agreement that they can’t remain in the future but it’s not as clear cut who will take them back to the past.
Bucky moaned, the sound a flutter against his ass as redoubling his effort had every lash of his tongue took Tony higher and higher.
Steve shucks his own sleepwear, tugging his shirt over his head and getting caught on the way out before he’s kneeling back onto the bed, hesitant and determined all at once. In the end, the angle isn’t great and Tony hasn’t thought this through as much as he’d thought. Otherwise, it’s perfect. Glorious even, the way that Steve slides heavy between his lips, caressing the flat of his tongue and rewarding Tony with little jewels of pre-come when Tony hollows his cheeks and swirls his tongue over the tip.
“I’m listening, Tony. You’re saying that Bucky knows himself best, even though he hardly knows what day it is some days, and he still wakes up on rainy mornings thinking he still needs to take me out because I’m his target again. But I should trust what he says and if he doesn’t want to be an Avenger so that must be the right answer. I should take him at his word because it’s beyond the realm of possibility that maybe Bucky doesn’t know his own mind right now. Maybe he needs a little hand. Some support to head in the right direction.” As Steve speaks, his face grows darker and darker until he’s glowering, teeth sliding against each other in a harsh whine that makes Tony wince.
He’s ready to go home, with or without Steve, preferably without him at this point, and the anger has bled away. There’s probably something to be said for the way Tony cycles through his emotions, but nothing has ever been coherent when it comes to his relationship with Steve.
Rhodey had teased him mercilessly when he’d found out that Tony had jumped on the whole self-care bandwagon. Until Tony deadpanned that his therapist had thought it was a good idea, and Rhodey had balked.
“We’re together,” Steve says, not taking his eyes off Tony though he’s speaking to the rest of them. Tony smiles up at him, and it feels remarkably good to claim him, here, in front of their friends. Their family. Then he adds, softer, “I’m in love with him.”
This must be what it’s like to really be numb, to be empty. The bucket that could be overflowing with joy, seeing Steve again, knowing he’s safe and alive, is overshadowed by the last twenty-one days. Tony can’t stop thinking about the kid.
Steve groans. “I want to, god Tony, I want to.” More kisses, then, “but we should talk. We should wait. Talk first, then go upstairs. This is part of the problem isn’t it–we don’t talk, we do this, we, oh God–” He’s losing the battle; Tony can already feel his resolve slipping away in the little gasps escaping his mouth between kisses. “God, I don’t want to fuck this up.”
“Peter isn’t that weird little neighbor kid you were obsessed with.” Bucky shoves Steve further down the couch so he can sit beside him. There was already plenty of distance between them, but Bucky has made it more obvious with the hard lines of his body.  “He doesn’t need you lookin’ out for him. He’s stronger than he looks.”
Steve curls over on his side, pulling down the blanket that hangs over the back of the sofa and takes a deep breath. The smell of Tony lingers on everything, sharp and spicy, comforting in a way that makes Steve think he could die here, if he really wanted. Just close his eyes, dream about Tony, and wait for death to come knocking.
“Fuck, you’re right.” The giggle that escapes him sounds hysterical and it’s not a far cry from how he’s starting to feel.
to do with Clint, because when she appears, she’s got two cups of coffee and a box of donuts. She hovers in the doorway, so unlike her, and Tony rolls his eyes, nodding his head so she knows it’s safe to enter.
“So what, then? You think I don’t know when I don’t want to talk to someone? Or is it that you think that doesn’t actually matter.”
Steve opened his mouth to offer an answer and found none. Tears were springing to Tony’s eyes and Tony clutched his knees up to his chest, looking small and broken and so painfully foreign from the man that Steve knew.
Steve reached out a hand as if he could stop him, intending to reassure Tony, to hold him, but Tony was too quick. Tugging the sheets with him, Tony covered his gorgeous body from view, forcing Steve to look up and focus on his face—
when he came, shooting a stream of heat into his body and clamping his hands down hard on Tony’s waist to keep him still.
Exhaustion layered with the delicious haze of booze takes over and his limbs feel thick and heavy. Uncoordinated. A quick text to Pepper cancels their dinner plans. In the short time Tony’s been on the phone, the news has already broken.
“Pepper misses you.” Steve says quietly. Tony’s face falters and his lips spasm into a tight line. “Morgan too. I visit with her when I can. She’s incredible.”
Steve had been so at ease, so peaceful that night, and, as Tony often reminded him, so painfully oblivious.
Hurt contorts her delicate features and it’s almost more than he can handle tonight. She runs her hand through the sweaty mass of his hair and murmurs soft endearments that caress his cheeks and make him ache. Tony lets her tuck him into bed where she holds his head tight to her chest and lets him gasp through silent sobs.
They meet at Tony’s private airstrip a half hour later and spend the six-hour flight curled up in each other’s arms. Tony seems set on seeing how worked up Steve can get before the plane touches down, leaving him awkwardly rearranging in his jeans when Tony is hauling him up out of his seat and down the gangway.
He wriggles in Tony’s arms again but there’s nowhere to go. Between his legs, his cock throbs and he’s been hard enough to cut glass since this all started. There’s no escape from the heat of Tony’s hands, his body pinning him in place.
“That enough talking, sweetheart? Because I need to fuck you. I need to fuck you right now Steve, please say I can.”
this. He deserves to feel numb and forget, just one night, before everything changes. In mere hours, everything will be painful and difficult all over again and right now, relief is as simple as a sharp, tight burn down the back of his throat.
Steve is pliant under his attention, opening his mouth for Tony’s tongue to spear inside and lick behind his teeth. Fisting his hands in the short hair of his beard, Tony tugs at his jaw, pushing and pulling him into the right position as he slams him back against the wall.
“We love it, Tony.” Steve added, blue eyes filled with a deep earnestly that made Tony squirm. “It would have been fine if it had never happened, you know that. But since it has… this is amazing. Thank you.”
Plus, when he checks, the press looks positive so far. Remarkable, really, how quickly civilians will forget betrayal, destruction, and an obnoxious disregard for international law when their safety is at risk again. Though little information has been released on the incoming threat, it’s just enough to set governments on edge, and the media will speculate on damn near anything for a little clickbait.
“You beg so pretty,” Tony tells him, curling over him and lining up for that first, slow glide. When Tony finally sinks into him, Steve arches up into it, opening himself as a home to Tony’s body. Tony’s given him everything, and Steve wants to feed it all back to him.
Tony swallows his denial with another smooth, fiery mouthful and flips the phone open. Taking a deep breath and holding it tight in his chest, he presses dial on the only number that had ever been programming into the phone.
“Barnes. You safe to be around people now?” Tony's voice exuded a confidence that didn’t align with the conversation Bucky’d been overhearing.
A sad noise rumbles in the back of his throat as Tony threads fingers through Steve’s hair. “You don’t have to be alone anymore.”
“Let me go,” Steve said, voice soft and comforting. Steve smiled, all white teeth and adoring eyes despite the rain striking across his skin. It must’ve been a thousand tiny shards of glass, but Steve didn’t wince, just kept his eyes locked with Tony’s and breathed.
At the end of the table and out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Tony stiffen. Bucky had clocked the motion too, turning his attention on him.
Tony runs a hand through the silky strands of his hair, shushing him. “We’re no good at talking, remember.” He presses a mockery of a smile into the crown of Steve’s head. “And it won’t change anything now.”
Tony is a thunderstorm in his arms, all crackling electricity and energy as his hands explore his jaw, his throat, slipping down to try and skirt underneath his armour and tug it off. His usually deft fingers catch on the buckles and folds and Tony growls against his mouth, breaking the kiss to glare at Steve’s uniform.
Was this how Steve had felt, all those years ago, when he’d put the Valkyrie in the water? Steve hadn’t panicked, Tony had heard the tape. Steve had just promised Peggy a dance, voice calm and even, apologetic even at the end, and been a strength for her through it all.
Natasha lets her head tilt to the side and gives him an even look. “I was angry, Tony. I misjudged you on what I chose to see, ignoring the rest. And I was wrong.”
Steve sits back and bites down on the inside of his cheek. Now it’s just to two of them, him and Bucky, together on the floor in painful technicolour.
“I think I know why too. But you’ve come this far. Come on, Cap, just let me hear you say it.” Tony breathed back, a hand twitching at his side. “Wouldn’t want to make… assumptions.”
Maybe it does matter, because if Tony’s honest with himself, Steve’s been giving him orders since the day they all returned. It’s been easy to ignore them, acknowledge them yes, but set them aside because Steve didn’t have the right anymore. It didn’t stop him from trying, and bitterness and resentment made it so much easier to ignore.
He won’t, so it’s no use thinking about. Tony can’t wait forever for something that isn’t going to come. They’re divorced for a reason. An important one, when he has enough space to remember what the ambiguous perspective deigns to tell him on a good day.
Suddenly he’s right there. Tony’s being wrapped up in beefy, oversized arms and all his weight is suspended in mid-air, limp and all but lifeless in Steve’s grasp. He feels like hell, but there are no words to express it and the tears don’t even bother to come to his eyes.
He doesn’t react fast enough to catch Tony, his arms hanging like deadweight at his side with Peter no longer in them. Tony collapses onto leaves streaked with blood and remnants of their friends. His clenched fists slam into the earth, and Steve expects him to scream.
Tony kissed with an underlying desperation, as if at any moment Steve was going to pull away and leave him short. As if he had to fit a million kisses into one moment.
“Thanks,” Steve whispers. He drifts off slowly and when he wakes the next morning, the arc reactor is pressed against his cheek.
“I don’t want to talk about it. I want to do something about it, and I need you to tell me everything you know about your buddy’s whereabouts.”
Steve had hoped to avoid coming here to begin with, but with Shuri unable to help him, Dr. Cho ignoring his calls, and Bruce still in the wind, he hadn’t had any other option. So, while Tony’s eye tracks him like a vulture circling the sky, Steve reminds himself there’s purpose to the feeling of being naked under his layers of too-big clothing. The gooseflesh rising on his arms is a price to be paid. He suppresses a full body shiver.
Steve doesn’t wait for Pepper to come. He can’t bear to see the pain in her eyes. They’ve both lost Tony, but Pepper’s grief is intolerable.
Tony launches forward, and their lips meet, teeth clacking against each other when Tony forces all of his rage headlong into the kiss. If Steve can even call it that.
“Give me the phone, Steve.” Bucky plucked the phone out of his fingers before Steve could get a word in and shoved him off when he tried to yank it back. “Stark.”
Tony doesn’t give him an answer, steering off course yet again. “You don’t need the serum. Never did.”
“You mean – I mean I – darn it, Tony I care about you, okay??” Steve said, just a tough too loud. “You drive me insane. I like you and of course I care about you and I just wanted to – oomfph.”
Tony leaned back against the workbench for a minute, shovelling another bite of pasta into his mouth. A wistful look fluttered across his features, as if temporarily he belonged somewhere else.
When he finally comes, pumping line after line of release down Steve’s throat, Tony shatters. The tears fall onto Steve’s hands, and Tony slides down the tractor, bare-assed on the dirty, old floorboards, cock limp and shining with spit between his legs.
Tony’s phone rings, and Steve composes himself in the bathroom. When they meet outside the front of the church, Tony’s eyes are hard and strained.
“Mine’s still better.” Bucky saunters over and drops down on the floor by Clint’s feet. “He called me the Manchurian Candidate.”
It was the kind of silence that came over him when his mind was made up. When every piece of the puzzle had fallen into place and the master tactician had settled on a final outcome. Why had no one ever told Steve that the endgame didn’t need to result in self-sacrifice?
Tony had found a multitude of other items, fuzzy and plush and soft, that all carried the scents of his pack, and yet he’d still taken them. And everyone had noticed.
Her laugh feels genuine so he smiles and gives them a peace sign as Pepper rolls up her window and the happy couple drives away smiling.
, Tony doesn’t say, like he has so many times before. They both need this. Something that reminds them they’re here, real and grounded.
“Fine, you’re right. I’m wrong. Clearly, I’m mistaken.” Steve back peddles quickly, offering a non-apology that’s all placation and stokes the fires of disdain in Tony’s belly.
“It’s okay. I’m sorry, it’s okay,” Tony had grunted, voice muffled as Bucky squeezed his breath away between the metal fingers. “My fault. You’re okay. You’re okay, Barnes.”
“Where are they taking him! Please don’t take him!” Steve tried to push past Natasha but she held her ground, bracing herself against his weight. He could have shoved her to the floor if he’d wanted to, dressed in nothing more than a pair of borrowed sweatpants with a blanket still draped over his shoulders but she whispered quiet words in a broken voice and all the fight bled away.
The Accords Council passes the new Amendments, agreeing with immediate effect to all the necessary provisions that pardon and reinstate the Rogues. Barnes will serve no jail time and be permitted to join the Avengers pending a lengthy psychiatric evaluation process. There’s no joy on Barnes’ face when the agreement is signed and conferred into the Sokovia Accords and Tony finds himself wondering if maybe he's tired of all the fighting.
Steve opens his mouth to say something more and Tony cuts him off. “I can’t do this. I can’t. Fuck this was—” he breaks off with a laugh that sounds half hysterical in his ears, “do whatever you need to do Steve. But I’m through. There’s no more Iron Man, okay? We’re not a team. We’re not anything.”
Arousal teases at the boiling rage in his belly and the embers of what Steve feels for Tony sucks in oxygen and surges back into a bonfire.
They get them back. Bucky and Sam. Vision and Wanda. Peter Parker in the suit he and Tony had built together from scratch. The portals open behind them and for one brief, perfect second, everyone is home.
“Yeah, I’ll be right there,” he bit out. Steve cleared his throat. He didn’t have much to say these days and his voice was mechanical and flat, rusted from disuse.
And Steve would smile, huff a breath even as he let himself relax back against his pillow, eyes closed to feel the whisper of spectre’s hands across his skin. He deserved this. It was all about him.
After the first time, it had turned into somewhat of an event – save for last year when he’d simply mailed a card from Wakanda, wishing his silver-clawed friend many happy returns of the day. When they’d come home, and Steve had seen the card hanging by DUM-E’s port in Tony’s workshop, he’d known there might still be a chance for them.
to have any drugs, but if he doesn’t stop pacing and if you don’t get this fucking baby out of me right now, Tony Stark, I swear to God I’m going to—”
“Into all of what, Romanoff?” He drawls. “I’m here, aren’t I? You’ve got all the comforts of home again. It’s a damned family reunion.”
“That wasn’t bad, Buckaroo.” Tony was cheeky and when his brain came back online, any minute now, he was going to do something about that. Definitely
He watches, smiling a little as Tony shows her how to peel the sections of a clementine apart. The fruit squishes in Morgan’s pudgy fingers, but she gets the hang of it on the second one. The first slips around her plastic plate, and some lands on the floor for Steve to tend to later.
Steve finds himself wondering if he can honestly say the same thing about himself.  There’s never going to be a right moment, but as Steve takes hesitant steps towards Tony, Steve knows this is the best he’s going to get.
When it’s clear they don’t have the answers, and they aren’t going to bring anyone back, the world turns away. It’s an irony, staring in the face of Ross’ failed attempts to shackle them just months before the snap. Now, Ross is gone, and the world doesn’t care what the Avengers are doing.
Heart pounding of his chest and into his throat, Tony darts into the elevator and mashes the button for the lower level, snapping at FRIDAY to override any other requests to avoid delays, not that he anticipates anyone else to be awake at this hour.
“What the hell? He’s not supposed to use it on his own!” Tony exclaims into the empty room. “Stupid, arrogant, son of a bitch.”
Bucky’s head shoots up, and he gapes at Steve, wide-eyed, before he stiffens and glares at the door like he’s going to storm through it and haul Tony to the altar himself.
“Aside from that being an obvious cliché… what’re we talking here? Linguine? Penne? Rigatoni?” Clint pressed. “Meat sauce? Alfredo? Rose?”
“Just do it,” Tony crawls off the bed and yanks off his slacks and boxers together while Steve stands their dumbfounded, eyes jumping back and forth between Tony and the condom in his hand. He sighs, exasperated, and takes it back, tearing it open with a smooth rip and sliding it over Steve.
“Anything.” And there’s no doubt in his mind that Steve means that. He’ll always mean it, even after everything.
Rhodey pauses. “I don’t think they know what happened between you, man.” Tony doesn’t bother to fill the space so he cuts to the point. “You’re still in love with him.”
He’s a weak man. For Steve, for the booze. For all of it. Tony just wants to feel good, that’s all he’s ever been after his entire unfortunate life and every twist and turn the world throws at him threatens to steal that away.
Steve pauses for a long moment, and Tony glances down to see the familiar tense and release of his fingers at his sides. He’s always been such an obvious man, with no poker face to speak of and a painful disregard for politics. Steve lacks the special brand of elite decorum Tony was raised on and it shows, in moments like these, and anytime that he needs to hold his cards close to his chest. They’re opposites in so many ways, and maybe that’s part of why Steve wants to be able to control this so badly.
It had taken a long time for him to confide in Tony about Bucky when the relationship had been new, and longer still to admit that Bucky had also been an alpha. Tony had been curious and kind as the story spilled out of him for the first time, a hand held in his as he soothed him and reminded him that just because the world hadn’t caught up with them in the 40s, didn’t mean that their love wasn’t normal, beautiful, and real.
It’s a low blow, and Rhodey had known it, because Tony won’t drag him into this if he doesn’t have to. He’s outright refused, and Peter deserves a bit of rest after all he’s been through. Not to mention he’s a child. A child that has asked to take a step back.
Tony tenses, hands balling into fists in the cotton of one of his Metallic t-shirts. “So you’ve just got it all figured out then. Congratulations. Did you unlock some sort of level achievement with that play?”
. He thought maybe he could have that with Tony, once. But day in and day out it’s been about everyone else.
“I can’t be the only one doing things different, Tony. You want to talk, we talk. No more shutting me out and pushing me away. That was a really awful thing to do. I know you heard me. You haven’t done that in—” Steve shakes his head like it doesn’t actually matter. “But I get it, okay? I get it because this is terrifying and I don’t want to lose you either. I’m terrified every damn day but you’re worth it. Do you hear me, you hard-headed asshole, you’re worth it, I love you, and I am so very sorry.”
“To look at our home, Steve. So, I can look at you, and look at our home, and know exactly where we belong.”
During one extremely unfortunate bout of thorough fair, Tony isn’t totally paying attention during a morning set.
Peggy was a goddamn powerhouse and that whole time, she’d known. She’d known, and she’d never said anything. And as always, she had been right.
Steve staggers to his knees at the edge of the futon and pulls himself up until he’s slumped against the backrest, limp limbs a chaos in front of him. It’s almost shocking how there’s no connection to his own body now, just a bag of bones on autopilot that don’t belong to Steve anymore.
“Baby you know fan mail time is every other Sunday at four.” Tony smiles to himself, because even though she’s learning more and more every day, FRIDAY is no JARVIS. He misses JARVIS something fierce and it had hurt to leave him after Tony had rebuilt his coding from scratch. It wouldn’t take much to reinstate him in Malibu, but he has a soft spot for the infant AI now and he can’t wait to see how she grows.
“No, Pops! Here, see?” Morgan holds out a piece for Tony again, and he takes it with the same animation that sets off another series of giggles.
In his right hand, clenched so tight his knuckles tinge white, is the ridiculous grey flip phone. Taunting him. It would be so easy to destroy it.
“I don’t know man; I don’t buy it.” Sam is saying. “I think you got lucky, y’know? We’d never fought against you before so you clearly had the upper hand with that web stuff. I want a do-over, and this time I won’t go so easy.”
Steve whispers the words back to him, and no one else exists. There’s only Tony, looking up at him like Steve’s the only person in the universe. When Tony looks at him, he can almost believe it.
“I would love nothing more than to move past all the blame. If he actually apologized, maybe. I don’t even know if that’s what it’s about.”
At that moment it feels like it’s just the two of them in the room, despite the gaggle of Avengers old, new, and Rogue, more bureaucrats than Tony can shake a stick at, and a half dozen high-security spectators. Ross’s scowl deepens but it’s better to meet him head-on.
The next morning, Rhodey turns up in the penthouse just as he’s padding his way into the kitchen. He’s slept all of three hours and he has to scrub his fists into his eyes because he’s still seeing three of them. The room smells like coffee, but there isn’t any in his hands.
Still fully dressed, the soft linen of Tony’s slacks brushing up the inside of Steve’s thighs when he readjusts himself through his pants. He leans in and presses his mouth to Steve’s throat, leaving smacking kisses in a trail towards Steve’s deaf ear, sounding tinny and far away.
The room he and Tony had shared for months was dark now, lit by a sliver of light spilling through the slit in the curtains. Everything was exactly as Steve remembered, with all of his old belongings scattered across one side of the room. His radio was still on the nightstand and the sweater he’d been wearing on his last day at the Compound remained in a discarded heap on the desk chair in the corner.
Every time he gets close, Tony backs off, keeping him braced against the desk while his eyes droop closed and the body that’s long since gone limp under Tony’s hands slumps forward again and again.
Steve focuses on sucking him down, swallowing around the length of Tony’s cock until he’s sobbing above him, harsh but quiet as if he desperately wants to keep it all in. There’s only so much one man can take.
But he’d always work him over quickly with hand or mouth, or inside the warm heat of his body, bringing them both over the edge in a matter of seconds with a dark chuckle as he spewed lines of filth right into Steve’s ear.
Tony groans, nails raking over Steve’s back in a hot and cold trail leading to the curve of his ass. “Fuck me. Come on. Don’t make me wait, Steve, please.”
“They were your team too, Tony. Wanda and Nat, I can’t keep them safe if I’m like this. If…If this is about Bucky—”
“Why do you guys even bother?” Tony hears Clint ask as he’s halfway out the door. “It’s not like he’s ever going to put the effort in.”
If it wasn’t for the little hitch that Tony catches, a delayed reaction he doesn’t register until Steve’s already moved on, he would have thought his words had had no effect at all.
Tony comes with a gasp, going rigid in his arms as he comes all over Steve’s belly. That’s all Steve needs to tip over the edge. It’s the nirvana across Tony’s face and the hot cavern of his ass tightening up around him and Steve’s gone, pumping into him until he can’t stand it. The aftershocks ripple like bolts of lightning low in his belly.
“Sounds nice,” Steve says, because Tony had asked him something. He can’t tear his eyes away from the columns, sticking out from the black and white newsprint like a bed of nails.
“Come on, sweetheart.” Tony pulls him away from Nat, away from Sarah, away from everyone until his back is to them all.
“You stopped sending letters.” Tony makes conversation as casually as a hole in the head, wincing when it comes out closer to an accusation. Steve shoots him a quirked little smile, eyes crinkling around the edges in a new way.
The words hang like a childish threat between them until Bucky nods, resigned. “Yeah, sure. There are other sets. You could try it again, if you really wanted to. But Tony would be ashamed of this. He’d be so ashamed, if he could see you right now.”
“Don’t want to talk,” Steve mutters, capturing his mouth again and bucking his hips up to meet Tony’s.
The room swirled with the heady mixture of their arousal and the sweet scent of Tony’s nest. Floating along the high of it, Tony closed his eyes, sensations washing over him in waves. Bucky alternated between deep licks into the cavern of his body, and teasing behind his balls, occasionally sucking one into his mouth and driving him wild.
“It would have been better than this. Do you hear me?” Tony grips the hair at Steve’s nape and tugs until Steve’s looking at him, yanking with enough force that he should be ripping Steve’s hair at the root, but doesn’t. “What you’ve done is worse, Steve.”
“The Accords have been suspended until the threats have been dealt with. Apparently, politics don’t matter in the face of a universal emergency, go figure. As for your little girlfriend, I’m assuming someone there must be assigned to his care. We’ll make arrangements for them to continue to do so when he’s back in the US.” Then, as an afterthought, “is he even safe enough to be here, or should I be preparing for some sort of containment?”
The realization that he really means what he’s said settles peacefully in Steve’s stomach. No one even knows yet; they’ve been so careful to keep their relationship under wraps as they figured out if it would last. Then, for the fun of it.
“We could order a heavier one for you.” Tony blurts out, interrupting the stuttering because the last thing he wants anyone to feel in this place is shame.
Tony was finally coming to, his head jerking up from the pillows and with hazy, dilated eyes as he started to struggle. His unfocused gaze searched over his shoulder until it locked on Steve and awareness settled in.
Steve pressed into the shallow of his mouth, lazily thrusting the tip of his cock between Tony’s lips as he tried to suck and lick between gasps. Bucky wasn’t leaving any room to breath, pressing over him and setting a punishing pace. The sound of skin slapping against skin and the musky, salty taste of Steve down his throat left him teetering on a knife’s edge.
“So, tell whoever is running it to shut it down?” Tony suggests, because it’s that obvious and he can’t understand why FRIDAY hasn’t done that already. She remains eerily quiet and something strange turns over in the bottom of Tony’s stomach. “FRI? Patch me through to whoever is running the session.”
“You have to admit, you haven’t been dealt an easy hand here. And we can all see the way that Steve stares at you. Constantly. It’s disgusting, and a little bit pathetic. Even Barnes’ told him to knock it off this week. Sam says he’s told him that he’s got to let it go and move on.”
Peeking around the corner of the door, the smile morphing into a horrified gawk when his eyes raked down the sight of James Buchanan Barnes, the fearsome Winter Soldier, decked out in a blue fleece sweater, Black Widow sleep pants that rode up to his knees, a pair of fuzzy ankle socks and bright purple Hulk gloves.
“Then at least stay with me. I’ll be your date, like old times.” Pepper sways into his space and lets her elbow knot between his ribs. He forces a smile. “He’ll leave you alone.”
, Tony wonders. “I’m sorry, what’s happening right now Honeybear? You’ve been singing a different tune for months and, what, Rogers turns his puppy dog eyes on and you’re suddenly Team
“Just—shut up for a minute. Everyone always says that he straightened you out. That he’s somehow responsible for the goodness in you, but that’s been there all along. I know you think he makes you a better man, but you’re wrong. You make
When he can catch his breath, Tony eases back, slipping from Steve’s body, but hovers over him, petting a hand up and down the side of his ribs. Steve gathers his face into his massive palms and kisses him again, and again, until Tony is breathless and glassy-eyed.
Steve grinned at them, the image of Natasha covered in snow and Clint’s children a sweet and warming notion. She picked up on that thought real quick, glaring at him from the doorway. The softness behind her eyes betrayed her.
“Hi darling.” And then she’s coming towards him, Tony stepping aside so Sarah can wrap her arms around him and tug him down into a hug. “You’ve had quite the growth spurt, haven’t you?”
Steve frowns, considering all the ways that Tony’s just given himself away. It feels like they’ve been here before. Steve knows the words as well as he knows the back of his own hands even if he can’t fully place how he knows them. “Tony, people aren’t afraid of you. Ultron was a mess, yes, and we screwed up in Lagos, but people aren’t afraid of you. You don’t need this to somehow clear your conscience. We’re past that, aren’t we?”
It only makes Steve kiss him deeper, pulling him closer as if he could tug him inside his chest and keep him safe. Keep them all safe.
“Here, here,” Tony pushes the package towards him but then thinks better of it and pulls out a square. He offers it up as if Steve is a child and without thinking, Steve ducks his head and takes it.
“Yeah, I got that much,” Tony tries to tease, aiming for a levity that doesn’t shine through. “I didn’t, ahem, I didn’t realize that you felt that way. That you realized how I–why I –”
With none of the usual finesse – it was just noodles in water after all – Steve dumped a healthy portion of wagon wheels into the bubbling pot. When they filled and plumped up, he strained and dressed them with a generous dose of butter and parmesan cheese.
“Makeup sex.” Tony’s words get tangled between their lips and Steve smiles into the kiss, kissing him back with equal fervour and nudging him backward towards the bed. At the last second Tony pivots, taking Steve with him and shoving him backward onto the bed as he lets out a startled burst of laughter. He’d expected this would be more difficult. He’d expected to feel worse about everything.
“Can you just do this for me? God—stop looking at me like I’m about to go rogue. I’m not going to hunt him down; I’m not going to kill him or something asinine like that. But I can’t do anything with all—” Tony gestures wildly at himself. “
Steve switches to the private line, just for the two of them, racing up the street to where the Hulk is being overrun. Thor is in the sky overheard, Mjolnir flashing against the glint of the sun. They’re almost through. Victory is within reach and Steve can almost taste it.
“No, shut up.” He rounds on Steve, who looks shocked and dismayed, arms protective over his chest where he crosses them. Tony knows the feeling. Armour comes in many forms. “You always seem to know exactly what to say, and sometimes I wonder if you just say what you have to just to get what you want. You’re good at it. Pepper’s good at it too, but it’s been a long time since she used it on me.”
Tony whips around, and Steve sees the look on his face. Determined. Furious. “Stop! Steve, what the fuck! I have to do this!”
That sounds like the best thing that’s happened to Tony in weeks. “I’d like that. So, what’s up, sugar bug?”
There was a pregnant pause that left Steve’s eyebrows resting along his hairline. “No…” Pepper seemed to choose her words carefully. “I have not heard from him, but I’d be willing to guess that he’s going to be home later tonight. Maybe tomorrow morning.”
“After everything that’s changed?” Tony supplies and Steve gives him a slow nod, the lines of his forehead shifting and contracting between his eyebrows. His shoulders are slumped forward, something that might have signaled comfort a few minutes ago, but now give off an air of resignation while he sits there, prepared to take his lot if Tony turns him down.
A few minutes slipped past before Steve shifts and comes awake with a start, blue eyes flicking up to meet Tony’s before he settles and relaxes back into the pillows. It seems they shared the same fear then, that it had all been a dream, and the other might disappear in the light of day.
They’re just placing an order for pizzas when he does, and when Natasha sees him settle into an armchair across from Clint. She shoots him a small smile, and adds his favourite, from memory, into the already obscenely large order.
All at once it comes rushing back and the living room tilts on its axis. Steve jolts up off the couch, his body lethargic and unsteady as he tries to adjust to the mumble of conversation around him, words that stretch and claw for entrance to his brain but aren’t quite processing.
There’s a long line of civilians ahead of him which is almost reassuring. When Tony leaves the Clerk’s Office, Steve will be gone and he’ll go ‘home’ and have a nice dinner with Pepper and Happy. Tomorrow he’ll take Peter out for a coffee and let him regale Tony with stories of his summer internship at SI before he heads out to the Coast and figures out what comes next.
The curry Steve had prepared for dinner was mostly gone, the massive bowl empty in the centre of the table. It was framed with a basket of samosas he had folded himself and another of delicate naan. He’d only burnt the first two, and Thor had devoured them eagerly, proclaiming their charred exteriors a delicacy.
“Don’t do that. Please stop trying to shut me out. Do you—should we talk about it? Whatever you want, Tony, I’ll do it. You have no idea how—”
“Very well. Sir prefers his wagon wheels boiled with melted butter and parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.”
Bucky was groaning above him, picking up the pace and brushing over Tony’s prostate on every third or fourth thrust. It was enough to drive him crazy and the hind part of his brain wanted to give over, come apart.
“Don’t be jealous.” Tony purred, teasing him in a way that would have been impossible a few months ago.
“How is that not exactly what this is? Tell me, Tony, because I want to. God please, believe me. I want to. But what’s changed?”
He sees the hurt in Tony’s eyes, filled with tears and betrayal as the video of his parent’s death plays on a loop. He remembers the day Ross came and he didn’t back down; the fight they’d had at Clint’s farmhouse and going to bed alone with only his secrets for comfort.
Steve yanks at his hips, closing the distance between them and drawing a groan out of the back of Tony’s throat. Steve is rock hard between them, thrusting light against him so they roll and slide together. A familiar rhythm in an unfamiliar room and an unfamiliar not-marriage.
The former wasn’t Tony’s fault, the news had broken quickly, and he really hadn’t had any time to spare to call Peter.
“It’s not about winning. It’s about maintaining appearances. You’ve done that. I can cover the rest. You’re retired now, Tony. Taking a break from these things is exactly what that means.”
He hammers until he’s exhausted and seeing triples, stumbling half-asleep into the safety of his bed late into the evening.
“So, you need a left hand.” Tony said, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world and Bucky was some brain-dead moron. Not that he didn’t feel that way six days out of seven.
“I want a drink,” Tony mutters under his breath, more to himself than Pepper. The convention hall is a blur of noise behind him, background to the static of white noise in his mind.
is your intern?” Steve asks, glancing up from the tablet. Tony is hunched over beside him, elbows propped on his knees with a broad grin on his face.
Back in the forties, an Omega would have constructed a nest around the time of their heat, inviting the Alphas to join them in bonding or breeding, particularly when the partnership was still being solidified. Bucky wasn’t judging, simply inquiring after they’d all silently ignored conversations about bonding and pups for months.
Whatever Peter has said to Steve has had a significant impact. Steve keeps his head down during drills, barking orders and relaying Bucky’s observations clearly and efficiently only as much as is needed to improve performance. Bucky still doesn’t fight with the team, but he’s agreed to give it a try when Tony’s done working on a new arm.
Steve scratches at his wrist, the burn licking halfway up his arm now. Something wasn’t right. Tony has taken more hard hits than Steve could count and though the soulmark has ached and prickled before, it hasn’t burned quite like this. For a moment he’s grateful that medical is on standby, and Tony would be there first.
“He decided not to because he couldn’t bear the thought of leaving you unprotected in the field. The Avalon Protocol both relinquished direct control of the suit to your authority, and made your safety it’s top priority. The latter part of the protocol was added early last year, shortly after your third anniversary.”
There’s an uncertainty on Peter’s face that shakes him to the core and leaves him feeling cold all over. They’re fighting in front of the kid. The only reason Tony’s here, the only person who matters in this whole goddamn circus; Peter’s the only one who isn’t a clown and Tony is supposed to be here supporting him, building him up, giving him a boost if he falters.
“Tony,” Steve brings a hand up slowly, giving Tony plenty of time to pull away before he settles it on the curve of Tony’s throat. A warm trail of heat surfaces and follows Steve’s thumb down to his collar bone where it rubs back and forth.
Steve makes all the right noises, soft little moans that zip through Tony’s cock and create layer after layer of heat in the pit of his belly. It would be so easy to spill in Steve’s mouth and call it a day.
“Maybe, or maybe your swiss cheese brain has been forgetting to put our laundry back in the right place. Even DUM-E could do a better job than you do.” Tony dug his fork into the decadent chocolate cake Steve had whipped up for the bot and cocked a brow.
damn it. Even after everything, Tony finds himself seeking Steve’s approval and he hates that insecure, broken part of him that’s still seeking it out.
Tony takes a deep breath, shoving inside the little operating room, hand already reaching for the override button, except –
“They weren’t.” Steve spins Tony around so he can drop down onto the bed and tug Tony into his lap. Strong, thick thighs wrap around his waist, and Steve knows he’s already done for, descending headlong into the revelation that is Tony Stark on top of him, all around him.
Tony leans on the desk and tips his head. “I think like you better this way. There’s definitely something appealing about the whole big man, small package thing.”
Steve will spend the rest of his life working to deserve Tony, he knows. But he’ll spend the rest of his life working to deserve all of them. His friends. His family.
That’s all it takes for Tony. He arches up underneath Steve, hips slamming into his ass until Steve can feel every jerk and jolt of Tony’s cock, filling him with a wet heat that makes his own cock twitch again with renewed interest. It’s too soon but he clenches down anyways, pleasure bordering on too much, just to hear Tony gasp and drive up into him again.
Tony mumbled something that sounded like ‘cake’, but he doesn’t really seem to be listening. Maybe he hasn’t heard Steve.
“I’m going to suggest your formal Captain’s uniform. Purely selfish, I just want to see it up close. But that’s my suggestion.” Tony himself blinks once and his clothes disappear into a suit, all sharp lines and sleek angles. He’s a sight.
Steve is more efficient than he once was, slicking up his fingers with lube from the bedside table—whoever had left it behind, Tony’s not sure— and tracing the seam of Tony’s ass before rubbing against his hole and pressing in. Tony groans and shoves back, taking Steve’s fingers into the second knuckle in a fierce shove that has Steve gripping his hips to hold him still.
“I’m not going to apologize for that,” Tony clenches his jaw so tight the words slipped through like gritty pieces of sand, grinding against his enamel as they pass through. He wants to say ‘you weren’t here, you don’t know what it was like’ but he doesn’t need to defend himself. “I won’t apologize for being human.”
“This is what you wanted, right? For the whole city to know I’m yours? What was it you said, Steve?” Tony pauses, the little hitch in Steve’s breathing signaling Tony has his full attention now. “You wanted to ‘fuck me like a whore for the whole world to see’? Oh, come on, Captain, I know you can do better than that—”
“Of course. I have you.” Tony’s lips brush his again. He slips in the tip of his tongue, and Steve tugs him in closer, brushing the pan off the hot element and backing Tony up against the opposite counter with a burst of white-hot desire.
Tony shakes out his shoulders and wills himself to remember that it doesn’t really matter because Steve has apologized and they’ve had some mind-blowing make-up sex. Steve has said things are going to be different. They’ve
“We stick together,” Tony said, fierce rage burning bright behind the brown-black mixture of his eyes. “We stick together,
Tony wrote the playbook on pushing everyone out but not now. Not when Steve’s finally come clean and Tony needs him to stay more than ever.
Maybe Steve just liked to be naked, and hell if Tony didn’t love being pressed up against him when he was.
“Steve.” Tony says it like an admonishment and Steve gives him a look. “They haven’t even said what they need our help with.”
“Better get used to it, Pete. Believe it or not, it’s not the death-defying feats and saving the world that make it tough to be a superhero. And you can’t even enjoy the champagne yet.”
“Tony, doll, you should have said something.” Bucky’s voice was gentle and soothing as he shuffled closer, crouching down beside Tony’s curled knees.
If anything, it’s exposure therapy, because this is exactly what Steve had wanted in the first place. This is what was worth it all. Getting Bucky back. And Tony has to admit Bucky has a certain charm to him that draws a room together and eases tension with hearty laughter.
After a lengthy discussion, Tony excuses himself for some air and Steve gives him a quizzical look that he shakes off, resting a hand light on his shoulder as he passes him and wanders the Compound grounds. Being here after everything overwhelms him. Tony had retired for a reason, and despite the rocky beginning, he had enjoyed being retired. Being Iron Man again had almost killed him, twice.
When he genuinely can’t think of a simple answer, Tony switches gears. “Nice that you and Sam are figuring it out. You going to be a guest speaker at his support group?”
Tony wants to have him now, but not as fiercely as he wants Steve to fill up the empty cavern of loss inside him and if this is the only way he can get there, he’ll take it. Tony will take whatever he can have. He’s grieving. He deserves this.
The night before that, Tony held him while he cried, an ice storm screaming through the bunker around them. When the sun rose, Tony slipped away quietly.
A playful smack on the ass startles a laugh out of Tony before they’re both throwing on their clothes and Steve is retrieving his shield from the corner of the room.
“Not recently, but I gave it a try for a bit. I thought it was time I try and sort some stuff out.” When Steve opens his mouth and abruptly snaps it shut, Tony rolls his eyes. “I was trying to grow, Steve, don’t make a big deal of it.”
It’s when Tony realizes he hasn’t heard the ding of the elevator doors that it occurs to him Peter’s been held up. He can see him, but not hear him, just on the other side of the threshold talking to Steve. They have a quick exchange that Tony can’t make out, but Steve’s face, turned towards Parker, is tense and carefully blank.
Clint mutters something else that Tony doesn’t catch, but by the way Peter’s cheeks darken into tomato red, he’s safe to assume it was unsavoury.
“Y-Yes,” Steve croaks, letting go and dropping the hand holding him up from the couch to twine his fingers with the hand braced across his chest. Tony grunts from the pressure, taking all of Steve’s weight into his arms and landing hard with a knee on the sofa.
“Okay. I know.” Bucky says gently. His footsteps retreat and a few moments later there’s a blanket draped around Steve’s shoulders. “It’s going to be alright. F.R.I.D.A.Y., get Jim on the line for me, will you?”
Tony was the beautiful one, scars and all, a map of his life literally printed across his skin and Steve would traverse the globe, kissing and tasting every plane and peak of his body until every inch of Tony belonged to him.
Tony squints and presses his fingertips into his eyes, a headache forming in the centre of his forehead. Forgiveness is a difficult subject, and not one that he’s particularly fond of. But he’s exhausted, and maybe he only has enough energy to hold his ground with Steve.
The man kissed like a God and Tony would have happily bowed down and worshipped at his altar for the rest of his life.
“They are, but that doesn’t mean they have to be important to you. You don’t need to read them if you don’t want to, Tony. We’ve moved on. I know that.”
The first time his world had tilted on its axis, Steve had thrown himself into his work. An alien invasion had been more than enough to take his mind off the sheer propensity of his losses. And then there was Tony.
“Gotta stop meeting like this,” Bucky says gruffly in his ear, and Steve laughs. The sky opens, teaming with another invasion, but Steve just laughs and laughs.
“Tony,” Steve husks against his mouth, tugging him back by the short strands of his hair. Tony’s eyes are glassy and raw, so incredibly open.
“Cap? Steve! Look at me, damn it.” He clasps him on both sides of his face, thumbs under his jaw to tip his head down.
“Please,” Steve says again, letting the words spill out of him because Tony loves to hear him. Tony, the loud one, but over the years he’s learned exactly what makes Steve squirm and gasp until the pleas are spilling from his lips.
the devastating push to be something better, something more. He hates himself for being so invested in Steve figuring this out.
“I wanted to talk to you about today. It meant a lot to me, what you said. And, about other things.”
“It’s not fan mail. There’s no return address, but I’ve scanned the inside of the contents and though I’ve calculated a mild risk upon opening, I still think you’ll want to review the contents.”
“I don’t know. I guess I thought this was something I needed to do on my own.” It’s the truth, but it feels like a lie on his tongue. The long line of heat at the side of his body chases away some of the chill to his loss.
It’s hard to say what’s burning when his entire body is heated to the point of boiling over and steam is pouring out of Tony’s ears at an alarming pace.
Tony does the only reasonable thing then, bringing his other hand up to cup Steve’s face and tugging him down until he can press their foreheads together. “I know.”
Tony glanced up at him expectantly like a baby bird, opening his mouth and glancing pointedly at the pot. As if Steve would
Tony’s still flipping through an hour or so later when Steve arrives at the doorway of the workshop. Something about his posture must set off alarm bells because Steve hesitates in the entrance and doesn’t step inside.
Everything blurs and when his vision clears enough that he can see Pepper gently pulling Peter away from him, his eyes struggle to focus. Nothing has ever hurt like this before, and he’s ready to let go. Turns out, what they say is true. You go when you’re ready. When everything is complete. And there’s only one more thing. He’s got one last thing to do.
Those first few nights, Steve had still been sleeping in a cot, shoved between Bucky’s and Sam’s, waking up screaming from the raw terror of his nightmares. Every night, Tony died again and again, screaming while he stared into Steve’s eyes. It was only natural that he’d picked up the puppet. People did bizarre things to deal with their grief, and Steve told himself this was no different than curling up in one of Tony’s old sweaters or the way Morgan kept her arms wrapped tight around the helmet of the Mark LXXXV.
After Natasha is gone, Tony opens up the box of donuts. They’re familiar–a variety of chocolate-covered creations with bright sprinkles and dense dough. They’re from Randy’s, he realizes, and he has no idea when she’s found the time. Or why.
“Don’t I?” Tony says, the hand playing with his balls drawing away to come back wet with slick. Tony prods between his legs, swiping fingers over his hole. Steve clenches down, body rebelling against the cold touch but Tony keeps him honest. He applies more pressure and Steve’s body yields. “I felt pretty powerless in a dead suit, bleeding into the snow.”
He can feel Steve’s eyes on him and listens to his soft, even breaths. Steve is probably going to defend himself and tell Tony every reason that letter was necessary. That maybe he still feels the same way, but he can understand why Tony
After one of Tony’s unexpected and sporadic heats, Bucky had casually asked if Tony wasn’t the domestic type.
There’s still that part of Tony that wants it to hurt. He can blame Steve afterward if it hurts. But this soft, loving stroking that Steve’s set on makes him want to cry. It’s too good. Tony doesn’t deserve this. If he wasn’t good enough for Steve before, he shouldn’t be good enough for him now just because he’s spreading his legs again and desperate enough to let Steve back into the confines of his body.
Steve feels his eyes widen, knows that he’s gaping at Tony as Tony freezes halfway into the fridge and leans back to look at him. Uncertainty is written across Tony’s face, warring with a hopefulness that’s so plain Steve’s heart clenches. It’s a raw side of Tony that he rarely sees, a little shimmer of vulnerability like he isn’t quite sure what he’ll do if that’s not the future Steve wants.
“Yeah, an SI meeting. Pep says if I don’t come to this one, they’re going to stage a coup and kick me off the board. As if that would ever happen.”
The lean lines of his torso ripple and flow under Tony’s hands, muscles trembling with exertion and barely restrained desire as he shifts restlessly. Steve pumps his hips at a steady pace, shifting up to meet Tony’s downstroke from where Tony undulates above him.
“Tony, don’t tease.” Steve grips his wrist and fucks himself down onto his fingers, watching Tony’s eyes dance with heat as he does. “I want you in me. Sweetheart, please.”
“You’re not supposed to do this by yourself.” Tony murmurs, pressing his forehead into Steve’s temple. It feels so good to hold him. To be held by him again, even as his body is screaming to be let go.
“Tony, geez.” Steve breathed, trying to string together any semblance of a thought. It felt pointless with Tony’s hands all over him, exploring and pressing and grabbing in the most delicious way. Steve shivered.
Steve can’t think, he can’t breathe. The gentleness wraps him in a warm blanket but it feels like a lie. Steve’s nothing like this.
Steve’s orgasm creeps up on him, overtaking him without warning and leaving him rigid and panting, thrusting off-rhythm into the warm heat of Tony’s body with a groan of
He could keep shouting at Bucky for interfering, or beg him for another sequence. Just one last time to go through the memories; the real ones, even. But the exhaustion sets in and Bucky’s an immovable force when he wants to be. Steve already knows he won’t budge.
“Cheesy.” Steve mumbled, which was instantaneously so much better than any other fantasy he’d had. There was a playful smirk on Tony’s lips as he pressed his forehead into Steve’s shoulder, shaking his head with incredulity.
Steve looks resigned and it doesn’t fit. It also doesn’t leave the familiar icy twist in Tony’s gut anymore so maybe it’s good enough. That’s what his life has been reduced to. A series of
It’s like Steve can’t stop. He kisses Tony again between the laughter, hard-pressed to frown when Tony reaches over to wipe the drying come off them both with the edge of the sheets.
Something shifts in the air, in the room, in the space between Steve and Tony. The space that’s been there for years narrows into a singular focus and Tony’s tired of fighting it. He’s spent so long pretending that things are going to improve and one day he’ll wake up happy with everything he could ever imagine. Except Steve is never there, and he’s always left with a distinct feeling of discontentment.
“Mine,” Steve rumbles in his ear, biting the soft spot under his ear and Tony moans around the fingers in his mouth. “Want everyone to know, Tony. I want everyone to see.”
“Stark!” Ross sounds every inch the bulldog, so Tony rotates his chair in a slow, lazy arc. He keeps his posture loose and at ease. Roguish nonchalance, Pepper had called it once.
The hands that had touched Tony so many times, loved him and stroked him until he’d been soft and pliant. Hands that had held Tony steady through storms they’d weathered together. Hands that had tickled him until he’d screamed and tossed Tony over his shoulder, holding him secure as he dragged Tony from his workshop and tucked him into bed.
“Oh, no?” Tony asks. “Because you know, sometimes jealousy can be a good thing. Sometimes the jealousy can actually be really, really hot.” As he speaks, Tony’s mouth trails across Steve’s jaw until he bites down on Steve’s earlobe and sneaks a hand around his waist to grab his ass and roll up against him.
At least Steve has everything else he could need. Family, a best friend. A place to finally call home. All the things that Tony has found in his own way, and he should be happy for his lot. It’s not that he’s bitter, he waded through a well-lived life and there have been plenty of moments of joy. But after meeting Steve, he thought there would be more. So much more.
Fumbling around in the nightstand, Steve tugged out Tony’s preferred brand of lubricant and unbuckled his pants, giving himself a long, lazy stroke before he uncapped the container and liberally coated his fingers. The slick warmed in his palm and with the other hand, Steve spread Tony’s cheeks, letting his fingers find a home in the supple curve of his ass before swiping moisture across his hole and massaging the tight ring of muscles there.
Steve leaned over him and sucked the head of his cock into his mouth and he clawed back his orgasm with fierce desperation. There were too many hands, too many tongues and he could
So when Steve arrives at the lake house, devastatingly handsome with a few new lines on his face—take that Dad, peak of human perfection and still aging all the same—Tony can greet him far warmer than he ever has before.
The air thins around them and Tony climbs, desperately, firing a laser through the ship’s outer layers until he’s pushed through into some kind of access chamber or a vent. Whatever it is, it doesn’t matter because FRIDAY has calculated it and Tony
Steve glances up, uncertain. A curl of uneasy anticipation winds itself through his chest and squeezes.
Tony kisses him, straining up to kiss him with everything that he has and shows Steve that this is okay. Even if it could destroy them both, it’s still okay. Tony’s willing to get hurt again.
“No, I was just being an ass. You should know that by now, kid. I say the stupidest shit sometimes. And Cap’s fine, I’m sure. A little absent, maybe a bit more barkish early in the morning. He’s a big boy. I’m sure he’s fine. And I’m fine. And you’re going to be just fine so everything’s alright. Right kid?”
“Whatever you want. Even if it’s only this. It doesn’t have to be anything more than this, Steve.” Tony would whisper, as if he wasn’t offering to hand Steve the entire world on a platter. As if he wasn’t offering him
“What are you so afraid of, huh? That someone’s going to say something you disagree with? That you’re going to say or do the wrong thing? Look at me, I’m a walking tornado of mistakes and I’m still here. Nothing wrong with admitting you made a mistake and trying to do better next time.”
“It’s the United Nations!” Tony cries. “How can you be condescending, Steve? They don’t want to collar us, they want to oversee us, and frankly, if people are as scared as we know they are, and this could change that… Maybe we need it.”
Pepper’s immediate reply assures him that she understands. She’s worried, but she’ll respect it if he needs to be alone. Then she sends him a surprisingly graphic threat about unmanning a national icon if required and he remembers exactly why he loves her.
When he’d said it, Tony’s eyes had brimmed with an emotion meant only for Steve. It was never about Thanos. It was never about whether they’d won or lost.
“If the kid really is a superhero he’s going to need to be trained, right? Supported. Maybe he doesn’t have anybody else out there. It wasn’t like that for us. Everyone knew I was Iron Man, and the U.S. Army was hardly going to keep all this super soldier sexiness a secret. We’ve always had people. This kid is going to need people, Steve.”
When there’s no immediate response from the rest of the team, tension thick and chilly between the chairs of the conference room table, Tony takes the set up.
Tony’s eyes flick frantically between Steve’s. His pupils are blown black and wide, and oh. Tony’s drowning in them after all.
It was an unexpected surprise when Steve learned the team had gotten a real kick out of his new-found obsession with food. Soon it became a habit, one of the other Avengers appearing out of nowhere with a new (and mostly tasty) treat, watching with bated breath to enjoy his reactions.
Steve blinks at it then looks back up at Tony, uncertain. His question hangs unanswered between them.
“When it’s over?” Tony presses, shoving his feet into his pants and tugging a shirt, then a sweater over his head. His hair is sticking up at all angles and he can still faintly taste Steve’s spunk in his mouth, but he supposes that doesn’t matter in the face of a universal emergency. A token, for the battle to come.
Too bad that Steve’s made even that impossible with his damned letter. If he had just left the door open for him, for
“I know sweetheart, but he has saved me from kicking your ass a few times since you got back so maybe you owe him either way.”
Hot kisses punctuate each word before Tony nips at his earlobe, and a hand drifts down to grip him through his pants, squeezing him with a firm grip until Steve’s gasping and shoving his hands down the back of Tony’s jeans to draw him in. They fall into an urgent, desperate rhythm with Tony’s breath ghosting over his skin, and Steve can’t remember a day in his life better than this moment, right here.
“Tony, oh god.” Something presses against his forehead, the unburnt side of his face. Thin hands, delicate fingers. The brush of long hair against his cheek. Tony smiles because Pepper’s always been the one to be there. She’s never let him down before.
When did Tony grow up and become his parents? And if Steve and Tony are Howard and Maria, who does that make—
J.A.R.V.I.S. doesn’t reply, and the lights drift from their warm comfortable glow into sheer darkness. The abrupt blackness takes Steve’s breath away, not even a speck of light shining through the curtains.
“God you’re– Tony, you’re–” Steve breaks off and gives him a helpless, disbelieving look as if Tony has made an outlandish remark in a made-up language. He gives a slow shake of his head, eyes bringing with something Tony doesn’t understand. “You’re better than me, Tony. I don’t know why you don’t see that. You treat me like I’m a saint, walking around and passing judgement on everyone else. That’s not– I was just trying to get you to give me the time of day. I didn’t want to lose you. I didn’t know how else to get you to listen.”
“This doesn’t have anything to do with you. Buck’s fine. He’s ready. Right Bucky?” Steve glances past him to Barnes who stays silent, shaking his head with eyes the size of dinner plates.
“I gotcha, Pete,” Steve says as Peter lands squarely in his arms, and he grunts under the pressure. Thin and wiry as he may be, the kid’s all muscle under that adolescent frame, and Steve sets him on his feet with a consolatory pat on the back. He grins at Peter’s outraged look.
Their days turn into a steady routine of keeping Morgan safe and entertained. As she grows, Tony grows along with her, and Steve finds himself discovering new things about Tony he’d never known before.
In the crowd, Tony sees a vision of Maria, dressed in emerald green with pearls around her neck. She gives him a sad smile, rife with pity and unspoken hopes and dreams but when he blinks and glances back, she’s gone and an old woman in a sea of grey fabric is sitting at one of the extravagant tables in her place. Something sad and hollow strokes a hand down his spine and Tony avoids looking at Steve when he drags his eyes away from the Avengers at the signing table and listens for the cue at the end of Steve’s speech.
“Come,” Tony bites out, fingers wrapping around Steve’s cock, stripping him roughly until he’s reduced to atoms and the pleasure that chases away any lingering doubt and uncertainty, wiping his mind blissfully blank.
Steve drops the block of wood in his hands and stares down at his feet. His shoulders arch into a pathetic hunch, and in that moment, he looks so small, so vulnerable. “
Steve indulges himself, only once, sliding the tip of his cock into Tony’s mouth to spurt across his tongue. It’s bitter and salty but when Steve drags his thumb across a streak near the edge of his mouth and presses it inside, Tony sucks that down too.
Maybe Tony had been greedy, soaking up Steve’s love and affection under the pretense that it was bottomless and there was no reason to conserve. He could drink his fill, full to the brim and never have to consider that he was working with rations.
Tony snorts. “Don’t be like that J, you’ve heard what they said. This is a necessity. Captain Tightass and good ol’ eye-patch have practically called for this in writing. I’m just doing them a favour.”
Somewhere along the way, Tony has settled. The burnt knot in his chest that was his marriage has grown smaller with time, and though he carries it with him, it no longer weighs him down. After Thanos, the world was in chaos, and Tony was tasked with fixing as much as he could, technology abound as he tackled food crises, infrastructure crises, the oil crises that forced the world into a globalized green energy era.
“Ours?” Bucky echoed, thumb stroking light over the inside of his wrist. Tony broke away from Steve’s kiss and leaned down to offer one to Bucky, nipping at his bottom lip the way Tony knew he liked best. A little pain to accentuate the pleasure.
Maybe it had been talking about it that had done it, though, because despite Steve’s adamant refusal, the thought of Bucky still slipped in from time to time. He’d been happy enough to just ignore it, shove it away and wrap himself in discovering what friendship meant with this new version of his childhood love.
Steve’s body curves around all of Tony, covering as much as him as he can, even down at the bottom of the bed where Tony can see Steve’s feet, still in their shoes, tangling with his own in their bright red, no-slip hospital socks someone’s put on him.
“It wasn’t the right time, Tony!” Steve does reach for him then but Tony smacks him away. “I wanted to; I did. But if I’d told you and that was the last thing you heard—I couldn’t do that to you, not then.”
“Something isn’t right.” Tony shakes his head, giving him a questioning look. “Something doesn’t feel right, Steve. I can’t put my finger on it. It’s almost like we’re not supposed to be here. Like you’re—”
He offers it to Steve with an age-old smile. Steve leans in and takes it, licking the tips of his fingers and watching Tony’s eyes go soft and wistful. It feels as if he’s floating, and Tony is the only thing keeping him pinned down. Without him, Steve could simply float away.
“Nothing.” Steve reaches out a hand towards Tony but stops, hand suspended above his on the bed. “Can I…?” Tony gives him the permission this time, and Steve takes one hand into both of his. His fingers are so laughably small in Steve’s massive palms. “You didn’t. In my mind, you did. I told myself it was fair game, because you hadn’t trusted me with Ultron, but that came after, remember. It was nothing you did. And I am so, so sorry Tony because you deserved more than all those lies. It was never about not trusting you. I didn’t trust myself, and us–you–were the collateral damage.”
Would it really bad so bad if Tony imagined that that’s what this was? In a way, this is another first.
There’s a small click, and then the room is aglow with the soft blue light of the reactor. The calm is instantaneous, chasing away the panic and welcoming in a fresh wave of embarrassment. It’s a silly thing. He’s a grown man, horrified by the dark without the nightlight that’s been living in his partner’s chest the last few months.
“Everyone already knows you belong to me. The way you walk around like you own the world, with my marks all over you. The man who has everything. Mine.”
“I’m not sure what you mean, Steve. But I think that it’s probably best I give you my override codes, just in case he goes straight down to the workshop when he gets back and tries to lock himself in again.”
When Tony’s body bucks up again it takes Steve a moment to realize Tony is squirming away from him, wriggling close enough to the edge of the bed to fumble his way to a bottle of lube. He presses it into Steve’s hand and Steve presses it right back.
“And I forgot that. Or I ignored it because I was angry–not at you, at everything that’s happened in the last year. So, when I saw you that first day and you were drunk again, I thought… I didn’t put my faith in the man that I’d come to know.”
Steve shifts his stance and spreads his arms wide so Tony can take it all in. He knows what he looks like now. “Would
Tony, whispering in his ear. “You’re all I ever wanted; you know that? I knew, that very first day when you sucked on my fingers—”
Prying himself away from the bottle for the countless time in his life was just as hard as it had always been, and more. On the surface sobriety doesn’t actually change anything. He still feels on edge, stiff and formal around the others when he has to see them and desperately lonely and bitter regardless of whether they were there or not.
Tony glanced between them both, doubtful, leaving Bucky to roll his eyes with a rapidly darkening expression.
If he closed his eyes, Tony was there with him, propped at the edge of his bed, eyes dark and hooded with desire. The shame curled into arousal and a sharp twist of tension wound deep in Steve’s belly. How many times had he pictured those eyes on him, watching him, while Tony dragged his bottom lip between his teeth and gave a little twitch of his eyebrows? A silent,
“What’s going on in that coconut?” Tony asked, forcing Steve to resurface from his memories with a flick to the side of Steve’s head.
“You’re not too sore?” When Tony rolls his eyes, Steve gives him a playful smack on the hip, and starts to readjust him until Tony’s pressed up against his chest, facing away. “Like this,” Steve breaths into his ear, “I want to hold you just like this.”
There’s a particularly impressive bite mark over one of his nipples, and hickeys sucked into the top of his chest, no doubt scaling higher up his throat. He’d forgotten what a force of nature Steve could be in bed and Christ, how he had missed that.
“Don’t stop.” Steve desperately clings to the edges of his orgasm, terrified it could all be ripped away in a second. He’s not ready to wake up, he’s not. “Tony. Tony,
Steve scrambles across the dirt, rocks scraping against his knees when he drops down next to them, hauling them both into his arms.
“Yes. Fuck yes. You want to?” Tony shakes his head, eyes round as saucers and rife with disbelief. “How is this so simple? You’re here, you love me, and now you want to meet my mother. Who are you and what did you do with Steve Rogers?”
Steve had searched his eyes, enunciating each word carefully to ensure there was no possibility of miscommunication. “You want me to fuck you. In your sleep. While you’re having a nightmare?”
Steve feels powerless alright. Completely at Tony’s mercy and suspended in his arms. He’s burning up, split open on Tony’s cock as he works himself in one painstaking inch at a time. Tony tosses him around like a rag doll, using his meager weight against him to push Steve into the couch and slam him back into the cradle of his hips.
The fallout came later when resentment and malice dripped from Tony’s lips and played on a torturous loop through for hours afterward.
