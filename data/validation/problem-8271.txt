Mallen, for all his posturing and talk of superiority a moment ago, knew that he had met his match and if he wanted to live to get stronger, he needed to leave. Trying to floor the hero with a barrage of kicks and flames proved useless. He could slow Stark but not enough. Going for broke, Mallen charged for the exit -hoping to overwhelm the now true 'iron' man in close quarters and let Hydra act as shields for a speedy escape.
Stark looks down at himself for the first time and the question sinks in. Its like changing gears in a car the way his mind shifts and he feels...shame. On the one had this new body is amazing, on the other it’s like there's something changing him.
You sit back completely floored by this bizarre crap, you have to be drunk or high or dreaming.
Charles smiled pushing away the troubling images. “He misses you; I believe Logan does as well in his own way.”
The Avengers moved as one force, pushing forward against the rush of soldiers and pushing them back towards the base. Amid the chaos, the Hydra agents began shouting over their radios, behind them the ominous turrents engaged.
Lets face it, pre serum Steve is the cuteness
James followed, staying a few steps behind taking in the omegas stride. Something seemed off but he just couldn't pinpoint it. Loki was a lot like Natasha in the way he held his walk just so. It wasn't as with most people where you could read the slouch in there shoulders or the slight drag in their steps when something was off. He reckoned Loki would keep that steady prowling pace even if he was missing a limb and dribbling blood all over the rug.
Stark was sure Steve had secretly taken lessons from Pepper in order to become truly evil. Maybe the woman even had a super secretive textbook entitled:
Come the big day Peter was all smiles with his poster board with holographic projections. (Yes Steve this is necessary. No Steve there will be no glue sticks this science not arts and crafts no shooooo sugar buns!! )
“I thought...I felt you die.”
“Wi’my.. life…” Steve slurred knocking the glass off the night table.
“Hey”
Time...time. He had infinite amounts of that but did James? Did their relationship?
Somehow, Peggy just couldn’t believe that Howard had finally snapped. Though now seeing the smashed liquor bottles that littered the foyer and main staircase. She could see how it looked. She knew that from the outside looking in that this place reeked of whiskey and madness. All she felt on the contrary was sorrow.
The next series of photographs show a caravan of black SUV’s rolling silently into the lot. It didn't take a mastermind to know who these vehicles belong to when they watches men in black militant assault gear exiting.
“It’s a Stark thing,” Phil contributed.
“That’s my girl.” oh and that phrase just took all the fight out of him.
Stark smirked wolfish and ground his hips down against his husbands. “You're right, I'm lying...big Tony.”
The couple was also dealing with Peter and the child’s fears of abandonment. Bruce got back in touch with a friend of his who had given up the biological sciences for psychology. Dr. Betty Ross came by the tower and started doing short weekly sessions with Peter. It was helping give a voice to the little boy’s worries. As a family, they could work to make sure that Peter knew he would never be left alone.
So, any and all prenatal care would be giving inside the tower and at such time when the Captain’s condition became ‘noticeable’, Captain America would take a much needed ‘sabbatical’ and as far as the public would be concerned, America’s first Avenger would be some where in a cabin in one the nations beloved wildlife sanctuaries .  Cap had that salt of the earth image; it was not hard to picture him outfitted in flannel doing something ultra Alpha like Fly-fishing and wrestling bears in his down time.  That was the plan for now at least.
Chris hemsworth (in all his aussi awesomeness) : And here we have a wild Tony and Steve, aren't they little beauties. Observe the intense scowl as apart of the mating dance. If we remain perfectly still...they may kiss ..or someones left boob will be grabbed. Lets Watch!
“Agent Romanov you will stay put!”
Phil pinched the bridge of his nose and walked down the hall, oh yeah Clint totally did what he was told. The coats where all dangling from arrows in the drywall. Their property owner was going to love that.  Oh and look at that bookcase it matches. Shelves balanced on arrows, on guess at what the guest bath looked like.
“Seems he just missed his father.” A voice called from the entrance.
“What are you doing?”
“Congratulations Mr. Stark, your son is an alpha.”
Sparkling blue eyes met whiskey brown and glittered all the more. “You're back.”
“So Strucker staged a coup?” Coulson added looking up at the woman on the screen, wheels already turning in his head. There was something about her, beyond the fact that she should be over 100 years old ...and according to Barnes – dead. There was something natural in here eyes.” I’ll venture a guess that your mission was a little more than recon?”
It was time for the Stark plan of attack, which meant…Attack.
With Loki's strengths and talents, as well as his designation that made it easier for other omegas and shy betas feel naturally at ease. The first time one of the students hugged him, it felt so strange. Loki just stood there stiff as a board and looked down at the wide-eyed young girl, a girl who had been so scared of her powers. She was terrified of losing control and hurting someone.
The other two men nodded. “I think maybe Bucks right, I should have thought about that. Steve won’t do it.”
“Yeah I’m full-a surprises,” he said, adding ‘so is cap’ mentally. Tony wondered if Nat was aware of her own body language in relation to Steve, if she could work it out on her own. Widow was smart they all knew that, however thanks to the experiments in her youth her sensory responses where a little out of whack. Moreover, this was Steve, the pinnacle of all an alpha should be.
Checking the power control for the building had Tony scratching his head yet again. Those unseen levels below the old meat processing plant were active, well one was active for climate control and the lower level space it self was receiving power. “Why corner yourself like that.” He asked no one. Truth be told Tony could guess why – Extremis.
An: written in the middle of the night in my phone cause yeah... I have feelings and this is were they've been at. It anyone cares, probably not.
The inventor grinned scrolling down the match list. “Oh no I found her, the future Mrs. Rogers…you better hurry though she doesn’t have much future left.”
Kurt watched from a distance, tail swishing fitfully left and right. He knows what it looks like when a man is breaking from the inside out, he's seen it a thousand time- in his students- children thrown away for being different. Persevered for things they had no control over and made to feel like freaks.
The idea that there could be one person he would genuinely want more than anything else would. That he could have that and be able to keep it, be able to find someone that could handle his baggage and all the insanity of being Iron man. Steve could though, because he had his own past and his own mantle of Captain America. There was a connection there, a sort of unspoken understanding that bridged a near century.
“Oh come now I am a little funny.”
Tony leaned over and kissed his omegas brow. There was this blooming of pride every time he saw the ever progressing forms of his unborn children. The billionaire would have laughed if someone told him ten years ago he would be here, with Captain America of all people. He would have poured them a drink and told them they needed it more than he did and kept moving. That was the difference between then and now, because now he could not see his life any different.
It was three weeks later when the avengers with there newest member - Thor’s reformed brother Loki, received a call to assemble.
“It’s just…” The soldier struggled to say.. He was supposed to be a leader not someone so weak as to worry about trivial matters and yet, looking back and forth between the kind eyes and open acceptance he felt maybe it was ok. “My ma… she didn’t raise me like this ya know? We didn’t, omegas didn’t just sleep around and share what Tony and I shared with out some kind of commitment. There was this moral understanding that you were supposed to save yourself for your alpha. I know not everyone did but…I wanted to believe that too.”
“No it looks like your giving a ridiculously forceful hand job, J tell me you getting this.” Tony had tears in his eyes from laughing.
The billionaire blinked and shook his head, he struggled to sit up when a pair of hands slid under his arms and hefted him up causing the world to spin. He staggered a bit and reflexively placed a hand on the reactor, it was there still glowing and humming away under his shirt.  The strong hands that lifted him up. Steve, it must be.
His lips parted to question through the haze but were met with slow trickle of cool water passing over his lips. It felt good, it chased after the too hot feeling like extinguishing a flame.
“I never said you…” Loki signed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “You need to realize your actions have consequences. When I was your age, I made many mistakes. Mistakes that have marked me for the rest of my life as a liar and a trickster. The Court will never respect me. I want better for you!”
After Natasha left Steve happened upon the pair asking a similar question, he felt like he’d seen something like that maybe on television not for the nose but something. The solider could not remember though; also, he didn’t much like modern television so he avoided it. When Thor noticed a bit of blood running from Steve’s nose as well he offered to show him. Steve didn’t want to be rude so he allowed it.
Peter shifted and hugged his blanket he had drug down with him. “That’s what you said yesterday.”
Tony understood of course, now was the worst possible time for something like this to happen, “How long do we have?”
“I know Tony. I know.”
“’s gonna die… every… everyone. I‘m s‘pose  to be better, s‘pose to … ” Steve muttered turning away from the Alpha. His hands were tingling and sweat was running down his back. He felt hot and cold all at the same time, the cold was worse because it came in waves making his skin twitch.
Phil smiled looking over his shoulder, “I never thought he’d betray you. I think it’s the sort of thing Nick can get over. He knows how these things work.” Spoken as nonchalant as one might borrow a cup of sugar.
He needed the distance even if it hurt because everything hurt already so who cares if its worse? Worse by definition at this point was like throwing a match into a raging forest fire.
Bereft – was really the only word adequate enough to describe the collective feeling as the quin jet faded into the distance.
It was Starks turn to comment, the billionaire had been silent flipping through the screens reading over numbers already forming formulas in his head. “So what were looking at is a unpredictable time table with equally unpredictable results.”
Having finished the less than delicious but extremely nutritious prenatal shake, Steve was raiding the penthouse kitchen for something a bit more substantial. He didn’t much feel like cooking and to be honest he only knew how to make a handful of things. Food didn’t have much variety growing up. So short of  potato soup, stews, and other basics …Steve was no culinary genius.
He didn’t jog or do yoga this morning, this morning Steve was otherwise occupied with an overly affectionate alpha. One he decided to have a little mercy on and indulge the poor dear, Tony had been good after all.
“Stand up for me doll.”
She had not lain there long when the siren heard the familiar sound of a ship in the distance. This one hung a lantern low from its bow, a call to sirens. She looked out at the ship and felt a tingle along her spine; this was something…something she could use.
Tony didn’t say anything, he was bad at extremely emotional conversation. Truth be told he was still working out how that conversation was going to go in his head. He thought maybe just handing over his father’s journal to Steve and then hanging around for the question and answer segment. That would be the less painfully feely route. Then again, something else went along with all this. The fact that they might not be able to keep this a secrete for much longer.
Banner acquiesced and gathered up his bag, “I’ll just be out in the kitchen making tea.”
Bucky was standing next to Tony's wheel chair with a bowl in one hand and a spoon in the other. Tony's motor skills hadn't come back fully yet; it was frustrating and Steve could see the tears shining in the engineer's eyes. He wanted to move and stop Bucky because he worried so much about wounding Tony's pride. Then Bucky started to speak.
When Tony first met Hel, he had been terrified. Not of her of course but in his just as his father, Tony could never leave well enough alone.
Now everyone was shutting up cause this looked very serious, Pepper looked nervously between them. Hoping no one was dying, cause you never knew considering how the lot of them lived.
The two children had snuck away from their studies to explore. Tony always found his studies to slow and often boring, Bruce did as well but never said anything about it. This search for the unknown and exciting had brought the two little mer far outside the walls of Asgard and into the much darker colder waters outside the siren city.
The way he prized at the planes bay doors thinking maybe if he could open them, he could swim out. The way the water rushed in all at once and slammed him back toward the control console. It can in so quick and it was so cold. How the water grew higher and higher and he lost the feeling in his extremities first then it hurt to breath and he could feel it weighting down his lungs when his head would dip below the surface. The cold fingers worming into his blood stream before everything went still.
Tony leaned forward resting his chin on his folded hands, “What if the serums failing. There is so much we didn’t know about, so much people like my old man hid for so long. All of this is happening one right after another, what if all those experimental hormones we gave Steve trying to help him just hurt him. What if …what if this just gets worse? What if…”
Tony would burst into hysterical laughter if this was so bad. So instead he just tried to get himself together enough to be of use because it was sounding more and more like he was going to be suiting up soon. If you want something done right you have to do it yourself. “So what do we know.” His voice echoing in the bathroom as he stepped out in search of pants.
The omega’s fingers flew across her Stark Pad looking over additional information gleaned from SHIELD’s database and a private source. Ignoring Tony’s comments toward the inappropriate. “They know the identity of the Winter soldier. He is, or I should say was… a friend of the Captain’s from back in the day. James Buchanan Barnes, otherwise known as “Bucky”. Apparently he was a member of Captain Rogers’s team - The howling commandos; before Barnes’ supposed death. It looks like he’s now working for Hydra.”
“Steve you’re so sweet! Thank you; oh are those apple turn overs?” Pepper smiled playing with Peter’s hair.
“Hell no Tony don't you start that shit with me.” The soldier snapped. “You are going home even if I have to drag you back in a muzzle you got that!”
The siren congratulated herself in such a fine find on this moonlit night. The spell itself had not been too difficult. The boy was only a few days old and his form was easy to manipulate with her magic. With those eyes and that darling little face, she knew exactly how to use the baby to her advantage.
Steve covered his face. “Really?”
Being in his own home he would be comfortable, unguarded. Arriving unexpected would leave him little time to prepare. Natasha had played his game before; he relied on his own superiority. A king holding court, showing everyone just how smart he was. Nevertheless, even with all that intelligence, at his core Loki was a child trying to prove something. His anger could unsettle him.
Tony looked over to the incoming screen; old patchy had been off his greeting card list for a while now. What with the downfall of Shield, and since rebuilding of it under Director Hill. Of course, that little matter of the former Shaft cosplayer/master spy being dead as far as the US government was concerned. They all knew better of course. It would take grenade up the ass to put Nick Fury down. “Answer it J”
“And the faculty? Made any friends?”
"You were the closest thing i ever had to a Dad....I wish i would have told you that sooner...I wish i would have told you how much you where my hero, not just because of everything you did to say the world...but because you saved me.."
Steve shouted orders over the coms as his squadron circled the creature looking for any weak points.
Brown eyes narrowed on the older man, “Follow me,” Stark lead the man down the north side of the tower and in through a keypad locked door on the ground floor, into an elevator.  “Alright, you have until this bucket gets to the top of the building and back down again to tell me what this has got to do with Steve.”
“Stow it. You have two humans trying to escape your body, that can’t be fun. Also I think Tony is pacing again and Sam can only handle that for long before he puts your fool alpha in a choke hold.”
“Yes, Thor is apparently not on the All fathers’ best side at the moment.” Loki commented with a little too much cheer in his voice. As a younger sibling or...not- sibling rather, it’s always nice when you are not the focus of your...not-fathers ire. So yes, maybe he was just a little pleased that Thor was having to the lectured by advisers for weeks and have to be on the receiving end of Odin's one-eyed glare.
An: I'm having feels right now and this happened. I like to think a lot of Steve's character comes from his mother. I find her very interesting, despite the fact that she is seen as a minor character in most fic cases.
Coulson and his team blasted through the main gate – literally. Daisy lead the charge quaking the gates off the hinges and sending them flying. Next hit was the small fleet of black SUV’s. She sent the vehicles sliding and toppling over in the lose gravel.
James sighed and started looking for an exit, “Munchkin what did your Omega say about going before you left the tower?”
“Hmm, something so aspire to. I’ll try and adjust my diet accordingly so you can get your caffeine fix from my bodily fluids alone.”  Steve said moving his hand to look up at the cocky alpha.
A darkness that held too much familiarity and all he want to do was hold his alpha close.
Charles had been right all along. Not that Hank would be in any hurry to tell the man that. Loki knew how these kids felt because he felt it. To look in the mirror and hate yourself for being different. To look at your family and suddenly feel like a stranger. Mutant children often compared themselves to monsters. How often had Loki done the same?
“I stopped the project last year; there were too many problems with the subjects. I realized that Extremis was just to volatile and even if it wasn’t…the risk out weighed the reward. I was willing to walk away from it all but Killian insisted I stay on. He said I was an asset, I was a fool to believe him. He just wanted the virus…that’s what it’s become Tony, that’s the only word I can use for it at this point.  Worse, I think Killian has been working with it behind my back. I'm not sure what he's doing with it but it can't be anything good. I'm risking a lot just by telling you this. I just... didn't know who else to call.”
Just like putting on his gear and prepping his gun- this was part of going to work. This was something he could take off and pack away when the day was over. A dark reminder of the asset he once was- the killer he was still capable of being, but there was one outstanding difference between now and then.
“There's my Peter pan.”
The tiny alpha advanced climbing up onto the couch snatching the lampshade away . “Found you!!!” She cheered and giggled.
“I miss papa.”
When Loki saw Kurt he didn't even get the words out to greet the man before he crossed the distance in a poof of black smoke and enveloped him in a tight hug.
If the Ai could have sounded exasperated he would right now, “Sir, as Doctor Banner had advised against this, ‘prank’ you assured that this would be ’different’. Let me be the first to congratulate you on being horribly wrong.”
“No worries, I can get my merry badge now for ‘helping the elderly’.” Tony jested flipping up the toilet lid before stepping out of the way. “Seriously though, don’t worry about it Steve. I wasn’t so hot when I first came home from Afghanistan, god knows between Rhodey and Happy I got used to group bathroom breaks.”
The only minor hitch had been a text from Natasha as he was stepping off the plane that said they needed to talk about something.
The little mer’s squealed, as they were hauled farer down the trench and away from the now confused monster above who was snorting at the thick miasma.
"You paid for it in full given the unfortunate circumstances. Honestly, I should thank you. If I hadn't kicked the bucket then the Avengers might not have gotten their act together. Listen, everything happens for a reason. Even the things that hurt."
An hour later, T'Challa entered the lab like promised.
I'm back?
After that, the kitchen was quiet again. Even T'Challa's footsteps were now out of hearing range. Tony buried his face in his hands and shook his head slightly. He wished he just stayed in his lab today, not dealing with Ross and definitely not dealing with the consequences he had to face in case Thaddeus Ross were to find out about Tony's involvement in the breakout.
"Great.", he sighed (he seemed to do that a lot these days) and turned towards his workbench again. The holograms were still open and floating around. "When?"
"You worried about me?", he asked with a raised eyebrow, "Quite frankly, I am not the one sheltering a criminal in my palace."
"Now that is definitely new.", the genius replied and set down his glass, "What is it that I can do for you?"
Rhodey haltered in his steps as he eyed his best friend attempting to clean his hair. He was roughly 5 feet away and could smell the fact that Tony hadn't taken a shower in days. He recognized the heavy eyebags from his messed up (none existing) sleep schedule and the more defined lines in his face. He was looking older, more worn out. It made Rhodey's heartbreak.
"Just spill the beans, coati."
And while Tony knew that everything just got even more complicated, he couldn't help but find amusement in the way Rogers indirectly flipped off Ross two times over. He was not petty (a lie, he definitely is a major petty asshole) but let's admit it, Ross had it coming.
"Oh, please. Without me, you wouldn't have survived college so tone down your blabbing and put on some damn shoes already!"
When the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist entered the conference room half an hour after the beginning (not the longest time of being late but still), with sunglasses hiding his eyes and coffee in his hand while staring stubbornly at the phone screen and tapping widely with the other, Pepper's eye twitched in annoyance. The man who currently presented a new marketing strategy stopped in his tracks and waited in anticipation till the newcomer settled down, but Tony just glanced up shortly and then made a hand gesture meaning as much as 'Continue whatever you're doing, I don't care and settled down beside her.
"That's bullshit. You are in the military, you were obliged to sign them. It's not like Vision had much of a choice either, King T'Challa only wanted Barnes to be held accountable for his supposed actions, and Nat...I don't even know what Natasha's motives were, it's not like I could ever make sense of her.", the mechanic argued, his arms now making grand gestures in the air while he was getting more and more frustrated.
"He is slowly starting to catch on.", T'Challa delivered the news Steve definitely didn't want to hear. Had he been the only one fleeing, it would've been different, but now he had Bucky, Clint, Wanda, Sam, and Scott to worry about. Even Natasha was on the run because she helped him. "But it is not me you should be worried about, Captain."
"Tony, what is going on?", he asked, seriously concerned. When the other didn't reply he added, "Talk to me."
"Oh, and before I forget, tell Rogers that the next time he plans something like that, he better find a way that will not drag us all through the mud."
"Good.", Tony agreed before turning slightly and laying a hand on his friend's shoulder, "Good talk. Let's not do that again in the foreseeable future."
She didn't let him finish, "I'm not asking you to do any kind of paperwork or go to every single meeting yourself. I know that you have a lot to do with the R&D and this superhero stuff but I have to be sure that you take this seriously."
"Take care of yourself, Mr. Stark.", was the last thing Peter said before sliding into the back seat and closing the door behind him. And Tony couldn't shake the terrible feeling that
"I'll keep it in mind.", he assured before adding, "As much as I would like to continue the little talk of ours, I have places to be and CEOs to please into not making me a head shorter."
As soon as the meeting officially ended, Tony stormed (without actually storming because he wouldn't give Ross the satisfaction) out of the conference room and further into the heart of the building.
"Are you?"
"No, Shuri, no war is going to happen anytime soon. That was a meeting, no assembly.", her brother replied before turning towards his guests, "Captain Rogers, Sergeant Barnes, glad to see you both in good health."
"Tony?", her tone was warning as she eyed him closely, "Take off the sunglasses."
They both just gave a short nod and Steve asked, "I'm assuming the conference went well?"
Still, Steve had the urge to let his teammate know that no matter what, he would be there to aid in case Tony could not handle a situation himself. The thought of just leaving Tony's life completely didn't feel right, so he sent a letter accompanied by a simple none-traceable burner phone to make contact.
It was a rhetorical question, Tony knew, so he didn't bother answering. He just stepped away from the clearly frustrated woman and made his way further down the corridor. "I gotta go now. See you, Pep."
Tony Stark stared thoughtfully at the small electronic device in his hands. The grease coating his fingers left prints all over the cool metal, not that he cared. The holograms hovering in front of him were his only light source, apart from the small lamp with the partly defective light bulb that he refused to change. The holograms showed the inner workings of the device, nothing too fancy really, but Tony had been awake for exactly 72 hours and 43 minutes, so the lack of concentration shouldn't be as surprising as it is.
"What happened?", still slightly in shock at the reveal of his injuries.
"Stop being so dramatic, Tones."
"Happy, stop right here.", he said and hurried to grab under his seat, pulling out a red and gold suitcase.
Steve looked up and furrowed his eyebrows in irritation at T'Challa's words. He seemed to catch the soldiers' confusion but didn't care to elaborate, instead he let a smile creep onto his face and said, "There is something I promised to deliver."
And Tony found himself smiling for the first time in weeks as Peter beamed at him in excitement.
"Sorry, it's just-", he stopped himself, "When is your brother going to be back again?" The question was directed at Shuri who turned in her wheeled chair beside Bucky.
"I'm taking you back to the compound.", said Tony, not even listening to the teenager arguing. "Heal factor or not, that looks serious. I would be damned letting you walk home like that."
"Rogers just got himself a free ticket to the Raft. Should anyone know something about the current location of the Captain and his associates, then I want to have knowledge of it. In case someone deems it necessary to keep any kind of helpful information to themselves, well, the Raft is big enough.", he had said and shamelessly eyed Tony through the whole ordeal.
"Stevie, could you please stop moving around so much?", he asked his best friend who finally haltered in his steps and turned to face the brown-haired ex-assassin.
Now, with the fixed suit in his backpack, Peter was escorted to the main entrance to meet Happy. Tony just listened as the boy kept on rambling about how cool this afternoon has been and didn't try to hide the small smile stealing its way on his lips.
Tony quickly turned around in his wheeled chair and eyed his lab warily. He stood up, even though shaky on the legs from the long time sitting, and threw away the motor oil before trying to tidy up his workbench to make it look like he wasn't working for three days straight (and still making barely process).
The workshop looked exactly the way he left it. Parts laying around, half of the Iron Man armor hanging on strings, the arc reactor cut through horizontally, and the scorch marks of his miscalculated project joining the others on the ceiling.
“Steve, honey I think you need to sit down.” The alpha said flipping up the armors visor and laying a hand on his omegas shoulder. The comforting touch however was swatted away.
A smoky mental image collected of himself sitting in a bombed out bar trying so hard to get drunk and knowing it wouldn’t work. Yeah, that’s the kind of leader he was, he was the kind who hid the truth behind high ideals. The golden boy with a dark side.
There had been talk about calling Stark in regardless of his personal issues and Natasha had staunchly said no. It wasn't really her choice though, Tony had trusted him with watching out for this and now it couldn't be helped. Why did everything have to fall apart at the same time.
“Stupid hormones…” I sniffle, really this.. is going to be the most embarrassing nine months of my entire life.
The following letters came by nearly every means.
Fury stopped in his tracks… did Stark know? …no there was no way. “Exactly what do I have to lie about.”
Coming on strong too soon would bring up his defenses. From there on, she'd not get anything, not to mention that overgrown house cat prowling around. Therefore, a friendly house call it was.
We meet people in this life who are born into darkness by no fault of their own. They are handed a legacy and succumb to that darkness no matter how hard they fight to be unlike it. Among them are those who can crawl out of their circumstance and become leaders and saviors. Others who failed and yet through that failure learned that there is more to life that what you are granted at the start. Such a extraordinary gift it is to find redemption, to stand on the precipice and say - “ No more”. Those we make a conscious effort to change, though the road may be arduous and fraught with slings and arrows, survive.
They had problems with that in the past and the last thing Tony wanted was to hurt Steve, especially now that the serum was devoted to the development of the twins and Steve’s ever changing body.
Steve found him self-breathing heavily as Tony took him in hand.  For a moment, the inventor just knelt there stroking him slowly.
“Indeed.”
Even now as James told Bruce how fortunate they felt for all of the help, Loki could see in the good doctors manner that Bruce wished he could have done more.
Bucky returned to the tower alone, it was not for lack of trying on not only his but Thor’s part  as well to try and convince Loki into making the journey. It was for the best anyway, Tony was not completely on board with having the former villain in the very tower he had thrown the billionaire out of. Not to mention Clint’s reaction to the possibility.
Taking the tea gracefully, Loki added a few spoons of sugar, “James and I have...decided to adopt.”He said, waiting for a moment.“I wanted to speak to you about how one with our special circumstance would undertake it.”
Thor could only shake his head. “I know she does not mean my brother harm, but I fear she is set in her ways and wishes for Loki to find love for the blood that runs through his veins.”
"I knew that the Nashville summer trip last year would bite me in the ass one day." The man laughed.
For now though, all that was on his mind was heading home and holding his omega in a warm bed. Putting all this ugliness behind him if even for a night.
Normally the armor-clad Alpha would be zipping along beside the plane on a clear day like this. However, Tony had not left his side for more than a few moments. On one hand, Steve found it endearing and comforting; on the other, it annoyed him that Tony was posturing in front of everyone.
Loki especially had been floored to see how much James' pack seemed to care for him, a man they once stood against. After all hadn't he been a villain in their eyes? A monster? Yet all that had changed, it had taken time but it had changed and now Loki could see that his fear of never being more in their eyes than some creature made of malice - was unfounded. It wasn't even that they did this just for James, they did this for him too. This was plain to see in his talks with Steve or quiet moments in the garden with Natasha.
“I'm not abandoning him! We don't leave a man behind!” Barnes nearly screams as Natasha jerks him away from the port side.
In his head Tony knew this was wrong, Loki and his magical godliness or not ...he had the body of a teenager.
Perhaps that knowledge was the horrible truth of it all, as much as James liked to think they had both come so far – they were far from whole. They were damaged people trying desperately to mend each other. It was a valiant effort and even with the progress they had made, you cannot fix what you do not understand.  For all their similarities, they were still very different people. James saw failure as challenge; he'd get irritated and fight for better. Loki saw failure and internalized it; he'd get furious and blame himself for not being better.
Well things just got a lot more complicated.
EP12 - The great nap prank!
“No it’s not, Hill wants us all to head out soon. The only think I can think of his giving him Testosterone boosters, I’m also working on some time release adrenaline patches. If he still seems unleveled we can slap a couple of them on him under the uniform and hope that all the fighting will be enough to keep him steady in the field.” Bruce adjusted his glasses walking along side his friend. He wasn’t holding back on how poorly this whole thing  could go.
James and Tony were not close, not the way he was close with say Steve or Natasha. Yet the alpha’s found themselves seated at the communal dining table over a cup of ‘more Irish that coffee’. It had been nearly a year since the loss and maybe because of the time it felt better to do this...thing they were doing right now.
Still his chest ached again this time much deeper; again, Tony rolled his shoulders back hoping that the muscle was simply sore and aggravated by the hefty ceremonial armor he was forced to wear. The ache began to radiate and grow warmer, his breath caught- feeling a burning sensation rise in his throat. “Dad…”
Beck held up his hands begging and pleading, still to shocked to understand anything other than the fact the room was a mess of debris and now he was standing on the business end of a metal monster.
Loki hated to admit it but he pounded back the rest of his glass before snatching up Bruce's. He would have let his glamour drop right there just to calm the fire in his mouth but that would have drawn more attention than the man was comfortable with.
Tony didn’t know what did.  “11 Steve…Spinal tap. No... ya know what - movie night is happening as soon as possible because if we are going to reside under the same roof I’m going to need you to be up to the 21st century and all its pop cultural glory.”
“Anything you want honeybunch.”
Steve had disappeared a moment ago, leaving him in the kitchen with a promise that he'd be right back. Tony stood there a moment just looking at the pictures stuck to the fridge. Colorful pictures titled 'my family.' and 'I luv papa and daddy'. He smiled softly running his fingers over the pages.
“I'm proud of you.” She smiled glancing between the two of them. “Proud of both of you.”
Or maybe this wasn’t about killing anyone and all about information. A test of sorts. If you have stolen new tech that has never been tested - surly you would put it through it’s paces before using it in an important offensive strategy.
The omega dispelled his fears and turned back to the task at hand.
“Does he really do that?” Loki pulled an amused face. Surely the gruff man would not.
(omega Tony, normally I don’t do this but when I heard Piece by piece, -by Kelly Clarkson. I was literally in tears and this just came to me. I feel it fits this context best. )
The door creaked open, Steve was standing there slightly dressed down - out of his button down from dinner and just in an undershirt and trousers. “Thank you for your concern but I’d rather be..”
If what his old man said was true then things might get worse before they got better. Right now, he just had to hope Steve would see it for what it was and not bury his head in the sand. The blond could be so stubborn sometimes.
that I won’t come for you.”
Song - Fuckin Perfect - P!nk
Something about this swine called me, caused me to turn my head.
“No you can’t Tones because you’re not the only one this is affecting. I know you miss him so why the hell are you avoiding him?”
She saw his hesitation, “I swear, just recon. We know the variables and I think we all know I could have handled this on my own.”
The redheaded Alpha had indeed been watching the exchange closely.  “Go home Stark.”
“Good.”
It wasn’t like Tony planned it to turn out this way….any of it.
They had a plan, it wouldn’t make waiting any easier but at least it was something.
If only that was to be.
The billionaire felt his mouth go dry watching as Loki lifted his hands creating for himself a throne worthy of any LOTR film. Following that the prince lounged as siedr flowed from the interdemtional space licking at his skin in hues of Gold, Amber, and Green. Tony wasn’t sure if watching Loki…recharge was supposed to be erotic. Nevertheless, it was.
So they did, Bucky didn’t know how long it had been when he felt the jolt next to him. The assassin slept lightly and was alert as soon as his omegas muscle tensed. “Loki what’s wrong?”
The brunette chuckled to herself, “Alright then Steve, I think perhaps you’d like a little break for now while Bruce and I have a word.”
Jane pauses and bites her lip, suddenly thankful that the queen hadn't mentioned she and Darcy had been the ones who brought Duchess. Jane had wanted to see Thor but then she would have had to tell him why she was there. Frigga had said it best to allow some time to pass before inevitably involving her impetuous elder son.
Weight settles on the other side of the bed and he knows it's Tony, he can feel the warmth of him from here but he can't feel anything. Used to, every time Tony was near him it was like wrapping up in a blanket from the dryer, this soft warm that settled over him and made him feel at home. Now it's just this cold open space between them and it's torturing.
“Guess it’s just me then. Don’t worry sweetums I’ll be gentle.” Tony remarked with a crooked smile.
Not to mention hearing that Bucky had found someone, it was amazing and he was so happy to hear that.
“How are you feeling?” Doctor Simmons asked as Steve lay there smiling thoughtfully at the captured image.
Stark seemed to find this amusing and took the seat across from the redhead. “Perhaps you didn’t see because you were not looking. There are things in this world Captain, which science cannot even imagine. Monsters that will take your very heart with a smile on their face.”
As it turned out, ‘storm ‘was putting it mildly.
Stark, I should tell him. Staring at him from across the table isn’t going to make this any easier.
Loki turned away walking with a slight limp that Tony just now noticed. He had no idea what happened and his mind was already conjuring up images of long pale limbs painted in red ribbons all sprawled artfully across white tiles. The billionaire shook the macabre image away as he staked after the other man. "There's a lot left damn it so just let me help you!"
Barnes just laughed, “Yeah yeah, no details please.”
“Cheese pizza, no meat this time…I don’t think I can stand the smell of beef or pork at the moment.”  That was unfortunate because man cannot live on greens alone. Leave it to the Jarvis to look out for the omega.
This was his imagination, a horrible nightmare. No one would be stupid enough to try to pull this kind of a stunt like wearing Steve’s uniform in front of him.
What happens when you've lost everything, when you can't find a reason to feel anything other that a grief so deep that it feels like a cancer multiply until there is nothing left of you. When all you see around you is lies. How do you continue to with life once your eyes have opened to all the pain?
Elsewhere in the city.
Bucky Bunny just wants a hug, maybe some waterproof eyeliner too.
“I do not know Thor, go and tend to your King now remember.” Loki snapped though it lacked heat as the man was more occupied by holding up his frail looking son.
“There's something you're not telling me and I have a distinct feeling I'm not going to like it.”
They took turned washing each other, exchanging soft words and kisses. If there were more tears shed the water hid them well, Tony was thankful for that. He wasn’t sure he could bear that painful look in Steve’s eyes anymore. To some extend it did make him feel more human to be clean.  It was a few moments of just forgetting everything and letting the warm jets sink in through his tired skin. Moments of Oasis - sheltering there against his husbands chest, feeling Steve’s heart beating beneath his fingers.
Tony tried to be sly as he slid up behind his Omega standing at the cooking range. Slipping his hands around the blonds hips and leaning up to kiss the nape of the soldiers neck. “What's cookin good lookin.” He said in a low warm tone, molding himself to the taller blonds backside.
Tony thought he would feel better, why did he think he would feel better.
Bruce, wonderful patient Bruce. Steve wondered how in the world that man ever put up with Tony with out going green and squishing him like a bug. “So they are 20 minuets apart now? That seems about right for first stage labor, have you decided weather you want to deliver up here or on the med floor?”  The doctor asked the couple.
Pepper motioned for the music volume to lower before speaking, “Oh Tony…really?”
The name Stark sent a cold throb through his heart, how could he ever face that man. Then when Thor had relayed that Steve was expecting. The thought of the blonde heavy with child formed in James’ mind, it was distorted with memories of how Rogers used to be. All knees, elbows and grit. He imagined that slip of boy’s  little frame sitting on the small bed in the tenement apartment, legs folded and arms around a heavy belly.  It hurt to think of that because he knew that wasn’t Steve.  Those images were  just false memories and wishes he had conjured for himself out of comfort. Perhaps as his time as the winter solider it was thoughts like those that kept him warm at night.
Barton's voice chirped in, “Don't worry babe, if they show up I got this.”
This was Steve’s nightmare.
“That what you really come out here to say big guy or did my manly prowess just change your mind?”  Tony smiled the lines around his eyes crinkling pleasantly and Steve felt that same stutter in his heart.
For the fallen noble his first bite was...well it didn't hit him right away. It was like a slowly increasing blaze that coated the inside of his mouth and the back of his throat. Loki wasn't going to let Bruce know of course not. He had a reputation to uphold here! Taking a few experimental sips of water seemed to sooth for a moment before the burn returned. He thought perhaps if he just ate quickly then it would all be over and he could excuse himself to the lavatory and freeze his own tongue. That sounded like it might help. but no Bruce just kept right on talking and so he had to respond in kind lest the man read his suffering.
Paired with that look Cap was giving him. The "disapproval is over 90000" look. Wade knew something was up.
As if things couldn't be complicated enough, with the potential of cyborg super soldiers or some other such mad shit on the apparent horizon,(this is why you can't have nice things Tony) he has a pre-heat omega to deal with. Cause nothing says ’ welcome home’ like murderous rage infused creatures! Let’s just throw our personal lives in a big blender and take a sex holiday while the world goes to hell.
“Could she control someone if they were like that... likes a hive mind of something?” Simmons interjected over the line
All the while Bucky was fighting relentlessly to hold the ship steady as the perilous seas grew more and more violent and a destructive storm formed in the ominous sky above the shadowy ocean. He gazed out over the raging seas and spotted the small sea craft surface. “Blessed Mary and Joseph!” The man whooped and pumped his fist in the air.
He had gone into an abandoned church following the person and then... Nothing.  Why there was nothing…nothing was bad.  Nothing was cold and empty and tasted like salt water rising up in his throat.
“Tony did you wash this with hot water”
It wasn't just James who had noticed, everyone had seen the broken once prince passing through the halls.
“See, Tony’s going to be ok.” Pepper tried to sound soothing as she laid her hands over Steve’s trying to lead him away from the chair he was very close to breaking.
“Every things gonna be ok doll. Don'tcha worry. “Said more to assure himself than Loki as James reached over and gently stroked the tangle of black hair. At least the omega wasn't shying away from his touch, that seemed like a good sign.
"Nope...no..." Tony shook his head. Something inside him dropped to his stomach and turned cold when the deadly admission left the ravenette lips. "Come on get up you're coming with me"
Maybe Loki was right, he was a monster. He wasn't the man that Steve loved Tony doesn't even knows who he is anymore. This wasn't an improvement or an upgrade. It was a curse, One he had chosen so foolishly with out even thinking about the repercussions.
Tony was groggy but hearing their son’s pitiful cries and pleas, he managed to wake up wake up and rub the simpering child’s back. “Hey buddy no ones going anywhere.”
So, Thor was under the impression Loki and Amora had been together, he would be wrong. Amora had often said she was ‘too pure to allow him to touch her until they would be wed’. Loki had respected her wishes, he respected anything she wanted because he was in no hurry to mate and sire a brood any more than she was to birth them.
Thankfully before the omega could ruminate any further, the platform doors opened and Iron man touched down. Glistening red and gold began to dismantle as Tony walked in, a broad smile across his face.
It was a few days later when Steve decided to tell the rest of the team, or the team minus Thor who was still in Asgard.
If James really thought about it, the closest thing he had to a father figure growing up had been Mr. Lee. He was an older man that lived on the ground floor of the tenement building. Thinking back he remembers the old man sitting on the stoop in evening reading the paper. He always had salt water taffy for the kids and a kind word for anyone who stopped for a chat. James didn't remember if he had any children or a wife, there were times his recollections were still hazy at best.
The brunettes head cocked to the side… why must people hand him things! Still this was for Steve and Tony was admittedly curious so he took the document. “So what…. Beta? You boys thought that the war effort would suffer from something like that. Or that it would matter at all now?  I gatta say I’m disappointed. I thought that maybe you were going to say that he was an alien or something awesome. Maybe a third nipple we don’t know about?”
“Loki, hey how's it going? How about taking a breath for me?” Keeping his tone level he sat the taller omega down.
The alpha was smiling like a predator.
The omega rolled her eyes. “Ya you’re something alright.”
, then this wasn't going to be easy. Images permeated his mind – each more gruesome than the last. The older he became the more mortality seemed to rear its head to remind him '
Time passed with slow touches and roaming lips, the later more the alphas fault. Steve was feeling better, the apprehension was still there but he did not feel that same tightness in his back and shoulders. If anything- being here with Tony made him feel weightless. If only this feeling could last.
It was time to go to work.
When James really thought about it, the last year they only seemed to find time for each other during Loki's heat and the few weeks after were always tense because...the one thing they could agree on wasn't working.

Steve regretted everything he said and it broke his heart that he’d been so pig headed and cruel. He’d been so self-righteous and closed minded when it came to Tony, never once had he actually give the man a chance.
Tony shook his head and sat heavily behind his desk in the home office. “This is for us, I'm doing this for us...,” he said quietly. All altruism aside,  he couldn't just let this fall by the wayside. Even if he wasn't going to worry Steve with it, someone needed to stay on top of this just in case. He could call Fury...then again – he wants to help Hansen and doesn't trust Fury not to snatch her up.  Agent would be out too, for all the good Phil was – at the end of the day, he's still a company man.
“Have they called a code Green yet?”
After a few hours Tony had no more tears to give, he didn’t want to give that hurt to anyone else. Not the media, not his friends.
“Just shut up a second ok? I'm not exactly hallmark cards and fuzzy sweaters. Point I'm trying to make here is that you are not alone, you told me to get my head outta my ass.  I appreciate the hell outta that so this is I telling you to look around. You say the word and we got you, you and Loki. As much as I never thought I'd say it that guy has weirdly grown on me.” Tony scooted forward and reached out to the other man. “One word, that's all. None of us wanted to step on any toes, I know if it was me, I'd spit glass rather than say I needed anything to help Steve. Just one word Bucky.”
Natasha put a hand up to her com link before answering, “Friday’s routing all available cameras and satellites feeds to Coulson’s team now. We have everyone on this Tony, we will find him.”
Bruce cast a weary glance to his scientist friend; Tony shook his head and did his best to anchor the omega. “Steve, turn your head.”
“Here it is baby, fuck…fuck here it comes…” Tony groaned slamming his hips up, the feeling was blinding and perfect and the only thing he could think was ‘claim claim CLAIM’. Pulling Steve’s head back by the hair and sinking his teeth into the gland. The omega shouted and came untouched.
The soldier chuckled, carefully shielding Starks eyes as he rinsed his hair "Yeah I do, smug bastard."
“What have you done…?” Steve whispered, blue eyes filling with the flash of ghastly images, his husbands eyes empty and expression blank as he walk out of a burning building.
“Like she wasn’t scary enough before.” Sam shook his head and followed. Knowing he would follow these crazy people come hell or in this case - high water.
Natasha stood off to the side passively watching the short-lived reunion with Loki and his students. It gladdened her heart to see him smiling again.
“Now you have to flex your Alpha prowess over me because God knows the silly little omega can’t do it right? News flash Shell head! I‘m not an omega anymore... I‘m not anything!”  The soldier started pulling out the IV’s and monitors sending the machines in the room into fits.
The confession had a little keen break through the soldier’s chest as berry juice dribbled down his chin. The alpha leaned forward and licked at the drip before kissing the corner of the omegas mouth.
“Did he say something to imply other wise?” Phil said, fiddling slightly with the volume dial on the radio.
The visceral growl issued from the omega as he tore through adversary, becoming more furious when one managed to shoot him.
“GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF HIM!”
Once abroad, the com crackled in his ears with Stark's voice. The armor flashing past the windows. “That was sweet Robocop...homicidal but sweet.”
It was a bad time but Loki wasn't going to say that.
Somehow Peter knew his daddy was lying, just like when Papa said he was coming back. They were liars and that hurt. Peter didn’t want to be left alone, because who would take care of him? What if Auntie Pepper couldn’t keep him? All these things were so hard to understand and made his heart hurt.
The old man grumbled a bit and pilled a cigar stub from his uniform pocket. “Ya do the same, go to work, help with the pup. Don't be a slouch and change diapers, washin a dish won't kill ya and keep lovin em. When you're mad and the boss man is breathin down your neck, when the bills come in, dosen't matter. The old man grumbled a bit and pilled a cigar stub from his uniform pocket.”
“Bitte! You know I have not seen you eat much today, and I am starving! Come ja?”
A bag of blueberrys in hand
The other man just looked in the bag and shrugged his shoulders, “Less to take off, this is just enough to get you in the Jet. Did I mention I had the jet coming, I do. It is the new one - I was actually going to save it and make this big show of showing up at shield and tossing cupid the keys. There’s an iron man key ring on them if you were wondering. I thought it really tide everything together.”
The many expressions of Hawkeye
Like today for example, today was not a good day.
Every time Loki denied company or begged off socializing for one reason or another. The times after they had been so sure for good news only to have the hope denied once again. It was then that Loki would always shy away from him, evenings claiming to have 'papers to grade' or 'reading to catch up on'.  All of these convenient excuses to just be alone. How many of those 'I will be late returning from the school' nights had been just that and not Loki some place alone with his thoughts? How often had the man spent hours with nothing but his own anger, fear, and loathing for company?
Brief, uncomplicated and if not followed...well- nothing actually happened unless you account for a royal puppy face from the over dramatic Alpha.
James hasn't opened up to anyone about this, not Steve, not Sam during his sessions at the VA, and not Barton who has become like a little brother. For some reason, now seems like the time. On the other hand, maybe its just Nat, how she never pushes or reacts poorly to anything anyone tells her. Hell, he could call her at  Four am and say 'bring a shovel and meet me at this location.' and she wouldn't even question a body in the trunk. Some people would find that concerning but to James that spoke volumes about their friendship.
His strategy was thin at best and easily readable. Especially now that Stark had access to all electrical communication for miles. It seemed Hydra's reinforcements were scrambling and the voice of an enraged woman was shrieking over the sound waves to 'secure the asset'. Tony wasn't about to let that happen. Hydra was a bunch of stupid little children who didn't have the vision for the future that the world needed. It was time he put an end to this here and now.
Steve glare, “I’m serious Tony, we aren’t getting any younger and I want them to experience having younger siblings.”  Steve would never say it, but he noticed more grey in Tony’s hair and part of him worried. He knew there was a chance that his aging would never quite catch up to normal and that he would lose his Alpha. He’d spend years alone missing this man, but he’d have Peter and Wendy. Maybe he just wanted more children because it in a way…those children would keep their fathers memory alive.
“Yes.” Natasha agrees but  thinks over what the other alpha just said. She's never heard Bruce acknowledge anything about giving Loki a physical. Something like that would have come up, Bruce always likes to talk about his day when doing little mindless tasks around the house. If not with her then Pepper, a thing like having Loki in his Lab would have been a fairly notable event.  “Just give it time. Put in for some leave maybe?”
Steve couldn’t help but feel partially responsible for that. Reading words that were laced with an affection he had never known, it made him feel…guilty.  That wasn’t all Steve was feeling though, he was terrified. If this was right... then who knew what would happen to him.
“What the hell is that? Bucky shouts. But his questions fall on deaf ears the light flare with high pitching sound then disappears – and with it – Steven Rogers and Stark's son.
The three of them wonder what was really going on but no one wants to interfere in the business of others, especially the Barnes household. Even with time there was still something’s that remained untread waters. Despite Steve's insistence the Bucky was family and by extension his omega, and Thor confirming his brother better intention these days.
Steve tossed a dishcloth over his shoulder after drying his hands. “Ok princess, I'm coming.” His work was never done, and the omega wouldn't change it for the world.
She sweeps his legs away and lands hard on the older mans chest, a thin blade pressed to his cheek. “ You’re lucky it was me, Bruce wanted to let the other guy deal with you. I don‘t want to kill you Nick, but don’t ever let me catch you near Steve, Tony, or Peter ever again. Or you will lose your other eye.”
Tony needed to get out of there. He needed t o be far away where the world still made sense, where he could think and figure what to do with his life.
Tony had been one of the few people to reach out and push him into experiencing new things. The one person (as frustrating as he could be) who now knew the truth. That truth didn’t even seem to faze him. Tony just wanted him to be ok.
Pair- Loki/Bucky
“You’re head hasn’t been in the game for the last three days.” She spoke pointedly cleaning her sidearm, “Plus, we have what we need from you. Sam can handle any additional hacking now that we’re in the system. It’s all recon for the next few days.”
McCoy sat back holding a cup of coffee hoping the warmth would take away the chill that had taken root while reading page after page. Bruce, was even worse for wear as the man had to excuse himself to calm down.
Natasha nodded and they engaged the door. The captain stood taking a step forward as the wide bay doors opened. He could see Tony, that black armor standing out like ink on a page in the frozen landscape. He had to believe that this would work, that he could get through to Tony somehow.
Bruce, of course, did his best to make this exchange as low pressure as possible. Having James by his side as they sat and spoke with the Doctor about his findings, were a bonus. If he had to have sat here alone it would have surely ruined Loki's progress thus far. The omega felt his palms sweat as he gripped tighter to the war worn hand of his alpha. James just held on tighter and listened, never wavering as the words kept coming.
“Ok fine smarty pants, it’s early for me. Tell everybody …tactfully I guess that Steve and I are busy. We’ll both be benched from anything, if anything come up call Sam or Scott for back up. God I can’t believe I’m saying that.” Tony scrubbed at his eyes. “This is it.. I’m successfully adulting…tell Pepper I’m adulting.”
“Sure thing Pep, I'll be right up.”
Skull looked down at the bound  Captain, “Are those going to hold him?”
Tony glared, “It’s safer on the med floor Steve, its not 1940 babe.”
Tony looked at him for a long moment, “I just, I know you’re here but…”
Her fingers relaxed and slid over the wheel, thinking back to when Barnes and Loki returned.
Stark looked up from where he was drawing patterned with his fingertips over the soldiers chiseled chest. “Yeah, we leave those two down there very long and no telling was questionable bio-science they will get up to in my sexy lab space.”
He sat on the bedside with his head in hands trying to piece together the last events he could remember.
It was bitter sweet sort of moment, the golden sun of evening filtering through the long row of window in the lounge. The way the amber glow warmed the room and made everything seem quiet and still. This was closing a chapter for both of them. It wasn’t forgetting the past but it did bring it to a gentle end. Things were not over, they were just different. Time had changed them both and life had taken them down different paths.
Wanted for Assault and battery of a minor child. Breaking and entering, Aggravated assault.
“Easy, the rest of the team… Sure I kinda wanna hit Barton but he’s not bad, Nat’s a cool chick…she’s stares at your ass as if it’s a porterhouse steak by the way. Not sure if you noticed that, oh and Brucy he’s like the bro, I never had. Thor…he’s…Thor. See look I even surpassed your expectations, this is me growing up. Are you proud Pep? Do I get a gold sticker?  I‘ll even let you put it on my helmet to show everyone one what a big boy I am.” Tony stopped spinning with a grin noticing the blush on his P.A’s face from mentioning Widow.
“Please, Call me Bruce.”
Green eyes narrowed in confusion.. “Safe?...James...no, James deserves so much, he has tried so hard with me.”
“Come to me, return to your mistress that I may command what is mine.” Amora spoke, holding out her palms, rivers of light as thin as the jet stream flowed from the surrounding sea. Each little tendril of magic she had ever cast now streaming back to its source. She would need every drop for what she was about to do.
“Yeah, there's a lot I miss about my Ma when I think about it.”
Tony pouted, “Come on Bucky, don’t be a kill joy. Stevie has that covered”
Tony sat up at the sound of the groggy greeting, turning his head spotting two slightly glazed blue eyes looking at him above a smile.
“Captain Rogers, may I ask a very personal question?”  She finally said as her cheeks tinged in pink.
“Play gently Jor.” Loki reminded as he kept a watchful eye on his little pup swimming over and under the looping sea serpent. Anthony had taken some time to start swimming on his own, unlike most mer who could trail after their mothers the day they were born. The baby had been smaller than most and it took him a while to catch up.
Revisiting Captain Rogers just a year ago, you would find a very different man. A man with darkness around his eyes as he stood alone on a dock outside a little hospital in the pacific. His ship in ruins, his team…his team was shattered. Moreover, his best friend was lying close to death. He would say it was his fault, Natasha would say she didn’t blame him. Sam would say that Steve did his best. Bucky couldn’t say anything.
The Calvary was arriving as Tony made it outside. “I need a medic!”
No he didn't, but these days... James didn't know what to think.
Peter was sitting on his lap and as much as Pepper offered to take him, Tony didn’t want to let the child go.  Peter’s little hand splayed over his tie petting at the soft satin fabric before pushing his little head back under Tony’s chin.  He couldn’t let go.
Tony would have liked to say he was surprised, however his life was never uncomplicated so having all hell break-lose wasn't at all surprising. He stared at his hands and tried to think about what the next 48 hours might bring, this was all they needed right now wasn't it?
“Alright then, after you.” Bruce stepped aside.  It was going to be a long night.
“Box seats for this Sundays game, I have no idea whose playing but I love the nachos.” Tony said heading back into the seating area. The alpha leaned over the back of the sofa and kissed the soldiers cheek. “Did I score spangles?”
Pepper and Phil steeped off the elevator together, braving a slight chill from the winds at this height. this was the highest point on the tower aside from the thin pole mounted with a blinking red light to alert low flying planes (Or iron man suits) of the buildings size. However, it wasn’t what it was when the tower had first been constructed. Which was a black patch of roofing tar and an access latter to aforementioned blinking light? Now it was lightly shielded by low walls of Lucite, to break up the wind, and a soft almost velvety feeling yet artificial grass. Solar panels disguised as onyx stones powered a small charging station. Tony wasn’t wild about the old tech but Bruce had said this would make it the one true bit of solitude. No Jarvis, no RT tech, just the sun and a little plug in for whatever someone might bring with them. Next to the little station where the landing cornered off was covered, not nearly large enough to stand or even sit. Perfect however to lay and be partial shielded from whatever elements one might encounter.
Tony watched from the corner of his eye as Steve tucked into the pizza and cola. He already looked better than he had in the hospital, bruises appeared less prominent than they had under the unflattering florescent lights. The inventor loathed to have to bring up the journal anytime soon but they had no way of knowing what kind of timetable they were working with here. Steve could be a damn ticking time bomb of hormones. Who knew what could happen or its effect on the serum.
It took 83 hours to locate Steve. In Tony’s mind, that was 82 too long, but apparently, the goons that seized Steve were smart enough to change cars once they made it out of the city. They had boarded some sort of tactical jeep that had scramblers that jacked up ever camera they got within 100 feet of, and satellite imaging was only so good until they entered rural areas with canopy cover.  From there they had to narrow things down to a list of know combatant locations. Everything from hydra cells to watchdog groups was on the menu for possible locations that could be holding Cap.
“When did you get home?”
They had that camaraderie, they got in each other's faces half the time but it was always with reason, they were both stubborn, controlling and perfect for each other. Somewhere in all that posturing and snide remarks they found a friendship and then it tumbled into something more all by accident.
Steve wasn’t able to have a proper shower just yet but they did let him clean up and move out of the nesting room. He would likely head back in at some point, hormones telling him to go somewhere safe and small. The linens would need to be changed first though and until then, Steve was content enough to ease back into the plush pillows of the bed he shared with his mate.
Driving through New York to the small cemetery in Brooklyn, the place where Steve’s mother was buried. Tony thought it was only right.  The drive was eerily silent and cars pulled to the side of the road giving the trail of cars wide birth. Civilians left their cars and stood with hands over their hearts or saluting as the hearse went by. There were fire trucks with raised ladders holding up massive flags.
“Right, ok, I can do that. Shouldn’t be too hard right?”
Fury pulled away from Stark tower and made a call. “Colonel Rhodes, Stark is becoming a problem. You asked me to let you know before any drastic measures came to play. Well you can try and get a handle on him or  I will.”
“I should be asking you that don't cha think?” the brunette replies, pouring the contents of the forgotten glass into the sink.
“A-are you sick? A-are you gunna die like papa? A-are you gunna leave me Ple-please don’t leave me daddy!” Peter dissolved into sobs and Tony couldn’t believe what the child had said.
He gulped lowing his head as the metallic finger top trailed over the bulge in the thin lavender lace. “Yes, I  ...I’m a dirty girl.”
The team was scattered through the tower that afternoon, Steve had followed Tony down to the workshop to do some gesture sketches of the inventor while he worked. Clint and Natasha where in the gym, Bruce in his lab, and Thor was in the theater room catching up on the new season of Supernatural - he was a big fan. (There was also a strict ‘no hammer policy’ in the movie room  due to over excitement issues.)
In the meantime, the siren made a grand show of rocking the babe in her arms and cooing softly to the blanketed form. She was quite convincing in this show of maternal care.
Shaking away the sticky words he focused again, No...That was not what he wanted. He just wanted to make it home. Home to Steve and the kids, home to his pack and Jarvis and all the bots. Even butterfingers and that damn fire extinguisher.
There was the tremble again; Loki noticed it this time as he set the tray down. He clenched his jaw momentarily and sat back as if it hadn't happened. She suspected he knew that she would have seen it. He knew who she was, what would he do?
After all, Phil had a lengthy talk with Fury this morning. He made it perfectly clear he would not defend him if Sargent Barnes came knocking on his door. Nick had a decent poker face sure, but Phil had a knack for seeing right through it. The director was all too aware that angering Barnes wouldn't just end with an annoyed super soldier. He would be opening himself up to the terrible wrath of a whole team of Avengers.
“Tony...Tony I have to...” The words were lost in keening little whine. Damn Alpha throwing those heavy 'stay' pheromones. Tony didn't do it often but when he did, it was enough to floor Steve like an elephant dart.
Bruce sighed and watched the omega make a hasty exit, “Jarvis, will you let me know if Steve needs anything. Even if he’s not asking?”
“Sergeant Barnes what’s your 20?”
When Steve was down on the common floor reading one afternoon, he felt something like a flutter along his side. He’d had these light sensations before and dismissed them; however, this grew persistent and seemed to roll to the right before a second flutter on the left joined in. That’s when Steve set down his book and placed a hand over the little movements.  “Hey…”
“Shut up Stark.”
Flopping back into the chair Tony rubbed his own arms and let his eyes wander, he could see a million things in this room that could use improving and that was driving him nuts. It was better to look at those things than Steve though. Because when he looked at the sleeping soldier, his eyes focused too much on things they shouldn’t.
The monster screeched and shook its head as a blast of powerful magic struck its muzzle from the tip of Gungnir, wielded by the former king. “Thor strike it now!”
“If I may suggest Doctor Banner,” Jarvis interrupted, “Perhaps I might be of assistance in cross referencing the information in Mr. Stark Seniors Journal with data available. I believe, with my processing power, I could lead you  to any surviving reports. According to an initial information search it appears that several medical colleges made a point to collect and record data from historical hospital in the early 1970’s.”
“alright,  my turn.. Get.” Tony said from the doorway to the nursery. “Steve your practically sleeping on the floor in here. Go to bed, I think I can cover this for a while.”
Loki tangled his fingers up in the alphas still sweat dampened hair and felt is heart rate spike and stomach flutter. “Then have me.” a slow smirk curling his lips. Each subtle touch lighting him on fire.
“That’s cute but no, daddy said open the door because mommy is being a dick right now.”
The brunette smiled leaning in to lick and suckle one of the blonde’s nipples making Steve gasp and shudder. Taking one of the little buds between his teeth and pulling just enough to illicit a little cry. “Tell me where babe.”
Stark felt his hair stand on end at the tone in Steve’s voice, the omega’s face took on a look between confusion and fear, reaching out just before those blue eyes rolled to white. This was Tony Stark’s nightmare, forget caves, forget torture, and forget black holes in fucking space. Losing Steve trumped them all.
I would like to thank everyone for his or her kind words of encouragement during what has been a very difficult time. I sat down to write this chapter thinking a lot about the struggles I have been through and the struggles still to come. I am not here to lament my past or seek sympathy. What I would like to do is dent a friendly nod to everyone out there just trying to keep his or her head above water. You are not alone, and if you only take one thing from me and from this story – it is that when things are there darkest, that is when you have to have to keep going. You must strain your eyes and find the light because there is light. It may just be a flickering pinprick but it is there.
Steve seemed to know and thank god, he was willing to be the more mature one, “Maybe it’s best if you just let me read the journal alone. I’m sure you have a lot of work to do and let’s face it, neither one of us really want to have this conversation.”
Loki paired the plum shirt with a slate trouser and a tie, he felt good about himself as he gazed into the full-length mirror. Today was going to be a good day.
The young siren lifted her head and clenched her fists, she had to do this. What it terrifying? Yes… but her friend needed her and the world they knew had been torn inside out and tumbled upside until it was crashing down around them. “Yeah,” her resolve found as she looked down at her straining friend. “Go. I’ll keep Tony safe.”
Therefore, Steve can understand why Bucky feels the weight of what happened, he had gone in that building after a target and had no idea until he entered that the guy had rigged the whole structure to blow. There was no way Bucky could have gotten out fast enough, then Tony blasted through a wall and grabbed him by the collar, Tony who was on one remaining boot thruster who knew there was no way he'd be able to carry Barnes out of there. Iron man had grabbed him by the collar and tossed Bucky out, Thor had caught the falling solider just as the building exploded.
The plans were final, Stark and Barnes would go in. Barnes taking point on ground infiltration, they had the warehouse plans and a rendezvous point. Coulson's team would be behind Barnes and run interference to get him in the building. Tony would work his way down from a roof access point and they would meet inside and secure Mallen and his group. Outside Sam and Natasha would be on standby should Hydra have anything special up their sleeves. After securing Mallen Barnes would circle back to find Madam Hydra.
Steve rolled his eyes and hefted himself out of his chair, getting up was harder these days. “ Nice to see you Thor,” He held out a hand only for the gesture to be completely ignored and the larger blond to wrap him up in a surprisingly gentle hug.
Darcy shook her head looking on as Clint and Tony were poised with ropes in an amazingly foolish attempt to ’lasso and ride’ some Makos. “This is the stupidest thing…ever; I’m so glad I get to witness this.” she said, shaking her head with a huge grin on her face. Really this would be better if she had something to snack on while these two rejects played Bite roulette with dangerous predators. Then again this was a usual afternoon outing.
Is it better to know or not to know?
He cant help but see Iron Man as a sign that he's old fashioned and obsolete.
Steve will deny it until his deathbed about how much attention he pays to this ‘teammate’; he notices just how shiny and plastic Tony's wings always are. He wonders at first if they're machines like his suit but notices how defensive he gets when Clint quips, “Your wings are as flashy as your suit, Stark.”
There's just enough street lamp brightness that his face is barely discernible. His frame is barely discernible as he cautiously steps forward.
And human, they are.
Steve takes in a large, grounding inhale and Tony can feel him hovering over Tony's body, knees pressing the rails and fingers ghosting around his chest.
Panic replaces the peaceful demeanor of the room as he twists his wings, attempting to constrict them away from the world. Grief and woe wash over him and the room is spinning.
It's the first time in Steve Rogers’ life that he candidly feels unsettled.
Church scene with Steve. It was going to be after Sarah Rogers' funeral and Steve was supposed to second guess his faith (or meant to be in a chapel in hospital while Tony is dying)
A boy the locals call ‘zombie’ is laying drugged and dazed, identical feathers sprouting from his wings. Neither child dons a black soulmark until they are terminally infected in the final hours before their death. They mustn't have long now, UNICEF figures.
Also Tony, I'm so sorry for fucking you up.
“That's bullshit.” Rhodey says furiously, stalking over trying to get a better look at his wings, clipped and gold dye fading like spray paint.
What ruins Tony until Afghanistan are his wings; they are a sign of no choice, no love and no strength. Maybe he doesn't even have soul. It destroys every rational thought and human instinct for emotion.
Steve pauses and is choking on tears, “If I am an abomination, Lord, then forgive me. But I take this as your blessing and sign of your watchful eye.”
Iron Man sees fear stoking rhetoric and a man with a bigger ego complex than himself obsessed with power and vanity than the earth itself.
The day Tony Stark's wings turn black, the world swallows him whole.
Tony is not Lucifer. At least he thinks so.
Steve knows Corinthians and trusts the Oracle as he repeats the words of a church that shuns an asthmatic, broken boy.
(When Tony Stark sacrifices himself for Steve Rogers, Ananke cackles and sighs with bemusement.
*****
1 Timothy 2:5 (no praying)
He can't help but feel eternally damned, regardless.
I actually don't like Christmas, dont @ me
If it takes the end of the world for the two of them to accomplish anything, maybe they're the opposite of soulmates.
Back at it again with my bullshit.
It took me two days, a failed batch of snickerdoodles and crying about ghosts in my attic to get this done.
There's no time to follow as Steve rushes and kneels near the child. His wings are burnt at the bottom and the neon blue ashy as Steve pats them a frenzy with his handkerchief. He's bruised and covered in grim, but all things considered, doesn't look to need medical aid, Steve decides.
*****
They clash on plan of attacks and argue over small details. Lives lost and battles won.
(Somewhere distantly, Tony still feels like Ares, the Greek God of War and destruction, or Narcissus, in love with only himself.)
Heart in his throat and soul on his sleeve, Tony gives in to love and kisses Steve with a frenzy and warmth, a flawless calibration in the planets, the stars and the black holes.
The curveball fucking him up is most likely Steve Rogers. He's moved to the Tower months ago and Tony still hasn't figured him out.
“Or maybe, he’s here because he cares,” A nagging voice inside his head barely whispers, and Tony just wants to shut it up. Because it’s not true. Steve cares about the team, not him particularly. It's purely professional, despite Tony's attempt to cut the tension down between him.
When Steve Rogers and Tony Stark meet, chaos erupts.
The Fates
Back on my bullshit, y'all.
-----------
P..S. Author is not trying to be offensive with religious imagery.
It's not okay and Tony feels like Papa Legba, loa of fate and Keeper of the Crossroads, is playing tug-of-war with his heart.
To come face to face, close enough to feel the Chitauri’s dying breaths; to watch terror grip a planet so divided among petty politics and morals; to see the End Times stretched in front of a hollowed out suit and know that he stands on the tightrope of end or beginning of humanity; to know that he is what stands between salvation and perdition is all a bit much.
The Avengers debrief, Loki is gone and the united part ways. The world returns to its former disarray. Tony invites all the Avengers to stay at the Tower; only Steve takes up the offer soon after. Steve travels some around the country before he truly realises how much the world has changed.
There will always be new wars, Steve reasons, and always be manipulation and fear rhetoric to chase society to make bad decisions, whether it be Doom Bots or bank robbers, people who believe they're soldiers or saviours, and above all.
Steve is on his back, gasping and bloodied near a window on the seventh floor, trapped under part of a subway car as a 100 ft support beam begins to descend straight for Steve's chest.
He read encyclopedias, catches up on history throughout documentaries and deciphers as many classified documents as he can to do avail.
It's only after he almost dies from palladium poisoning, that Tony knows his soulmate is out there.
The girl, Chaandra, named after the the word moon in Hindi, and the boy, Rav, the beginning of the Hindi word for the sun, have no family left from the disease and their wings a pulsating in synchronicity.
The boy is incoherently mumbling, teary eyed and crumpled. Steve attempts to help the boy up and he fumbles shakily out, “Are you the Devil?” at Steve's extended wings.
He's not dumb despite his father's reiterations that he's useless and should've found his match by now that he'll never have someone who loves him.
And in that moment, all is well in the balance of the universe.
(When he crashes into the Artic at the end of the war, he wonders if it would've been worth it to try.)
He decides that even if his soulmate rejects him or dies, he won't be the ignition of the End Times. He won't let the symbol of predetermined fate rule him anymore.
His mother grabs his arm before he leaves and her eyes shine with earnestly and murmurs, “Thank you, dear. God bless you. He may work in mysterious ways, but He brought you as the shepherd to my lamb.”
(When he hears during the war the rumour that Adolf Hitler's wings are black from the edges in, he nearly drops dead and shrivels back into Steve Rogers, the pint-sized kid from Brooklyn. He realizes after, that people admire Captain America because he's the Sentinel of Liberty not a sign of God's disgrace. His wings will never stop him from being America's son.)
NYX (Goddess of the night) and her children:
Steve knows that teams always break when one member throws a wrench in the wheel.
“We all try to get by”. Marsha smiles at Steve. George is half passed out on their table and looks mischievous, as a 10 year old boy should.
Black. His scraggly and uncoordinated wings that haven't fallen grown in are darker than the view from the balcony at midnight.
When Steve Rogers watches his wings turn black, the world was at war. Maybe that in itself is a sign from the beyond, but regardless, he can't afford to let his fantasy of a soulmate or the possibility of ‘what if” control him anyway. His service to his country.
It's why he's careful letting anyone besides Pepper or Rhodey around him. Pepper, who doesn't entertain his bullshit and calls him out when he's drowning in his own head; Rhodey, who never stops reminding him why he's more than Howard and more than a warmonger.
There's no more malice that night. Just hope and tears. Tony feels something in his chest, where palladium was but days from taking him from Pepper and Rhodey. From taking Iron Man.
Tony fumbles like he's been restrained, and a heart monitor beeps faster and louder, when he realizes he's not swaddled with a blanket but his wings.
It's a Monday or Thursday, but fuck it if he cares. He's happier downing a bottle of Jack Daniel's and messing with signal processing instead of smiling at a fucking holiday party with Stane, stuck up business partners of SI and playboy models who care more about their next exposè on sleeping with a Stark than their wing pattern.
Stark men are made of iron, he doesn't need someone who will melt his iron heart with the acid that turns his heart so cold and wings so dark.
Revelation 19:10 (no worship)
It constantly makes Tony feel uneasy when he see its, the image of a happy and loving American dream. As fucking if.
The Hulk is suddenly in Tony's eyesight, smashing Doctor Doom into concrete while Captain America is suspiciously quiet.
“There is nothing is wrong with you,” Rhodey's voice is strong and decisive, his eyes blazing with something, like pride and love.
"Where is everyone?"
"Pepper-"
-----
"Boss, Colonel Rhodes is in the main lobby. Should I send him down?"
He was in the midst of the Manhattan afternoon traffic when FRIDAY notified him through his phone. Happy was in the driver's seat, grumbling and cursing at the other cars and the traffic lights, but Tony didn't pay attention to any of it, already used to the man cursing like a sailor. Instead, he focused on the blinking message on his screen and FRIDAY's voice that sounded from the microphone.
"Nothing is going on with me.", he defended himself.
Tony was sure, if FRIDAY were a real person, she would sigh right now and glare at him in disappointment and concern. She would be just like that. But FRIDAY was not a real person, she was an AI. Tony was probably the only living thing in the whole section of the compound. Not that he minded, he was always just surrounded by his inventions, humans tended to be too upsetting for Tony to deal with long-term. Hence why he was alone.
"Tony Stark."
"Hey, Mr. Stark? Can I ask you a question?", Peter asked, brown eyes blinking up to him.
"Yeah, go ahead."
The tugging of metal claws on the hem of his pants caught the inventor's attention as he turned his focus towards the bot beeping happily by his side. DUM-E was driving around a cup of a questionable substance that Tony assumed was coffee. Some of the drink has been spilled from the stuttering movements the bot made, a trail being left behind on the tiles of his labs' floor.
The redheaded woman went and opened her mouth to make a remark but the engineer beat her to it, "I know what you're going to say.", he said and held his hands up in a defensive stance when he saw the way Pepper cocked her head to the right and put her hands to her hips, mastering the disappointed-mum-move with bravura. "And I'm sorry, Pep, I swear. I'll make it up to you."
The beginnings of a headache made him look up from his newest project and rub his tired eyes. If he continued like that he is going to need glasses sooner rather than later.
"Don't worry about it, kid."
"No can do. It's part of my charm.", he smirked and send a wink in his friend's direction who replied with a simple eye roll.
"I am so close to finding the problem, I can't stop now. I'll make myself a coffee and then I'm good to go.", his tone would have been described as cheerful if it hadn't been for the cracks in the middle of the sentences.
"Oh this is good.", he signed in satisfaction.
"Tony, listen to me. What happened at the airport with me, was not your fault. Stop blaming yourself for things that you had no control over.", he said slowly, his tone stayed steady as he held the other man's gaze, "You are a brilliant and smart man, but in the end, you are only human too. And yes, not being able to walk without these braces sucks, but at least I
Slowly he was getting tired of the other man's constant movements and Princess Shuri seemed to share his sentiment as she shot a few glares at the blonde super soldier while continuing to take measurements for his new arm.
"I'm in the city for the next few days. Should anything occur that would require my assistance...I believe you know how to find me.", the king of Wakanda said and clasped the hands behind his back before smiling at the older man once again and then making his way out of the kitchen.
Tony cursed silently and rubbed his throbbing head, his eyes felt like they might pop out of his skull and his throat was itching, a cough building up in his lungs. "Shit, Rhodey. I-", he stopped, not so sure what he even wanted to say.
And so Peter began the grand tale of his normal afternoon turning into a major fuck up as a madman with self-made acid guns decided to terrorize civilians.
And his estimated time was correct. After fixing the first layers of fabric was done, they got to work at restoring the lost cables and circuits. It wasn't too difficult even though the size of it all sometimes made Tony's skin crawl in frustration.
Rhodey just watched his face closely, his mind working to give his friend the comfort he needs but he was at the loss of words. The whole Accords situation and the conflict between Tony and the Captain had so many layers, even someone like Rhodey had difficulties understanding all of that. But Tony didn't even wait for James to answer as he continued to rant.
Tony choose to ignore the spilled drink and just took the cup from DUM-E who let out a few beeps and rotated his claw before driving off to another corner of Tony's private lab. He sniffed at the drink before actually drinking it, having learned from past mistakes, and found the smell of definitely not coffee like he hoped, but motor oil.
"You're not gonna like this."
Happy nodded and decide to not question him further, the pure look of determination and concern told him everything he needed to know. So he pulled the car in line again and raced over the crossing at  green, leaving behind the billionaire with his suitcase.
His body was most likely giving up soon. He could feel the exhaustion deep in his bones, his muscles were sore and his eyes burning from glaring at the screens. His leg was constantly bouncing up and down and the headache now spread from his forehead all around, making the throbbing insufferable.
Peter obviously wasn't happy with that answer, Tony couldn't blame him but the boy decided to not question the older man any further, seemingly sensing his discomfort.
While the king of Wakanda has an easy persona and was one of the few people Tony quite enjoyed talking to whenever he had to sit through meetings, he wouldn't consider them any kind of friends. They had fought on the same team in Germany, although for different reasons, and T'Challa was a good ally to have around. He had no hard feelings regarding the help he provided for Rogers and Barnes in Siberia and in all honesty, it was quite amusing how the man with all the answers was sitting directly under Ross' nose without the latter knowing. He guessed it gave some kind of superiority, knowing stuff Thaddeus Ross didn't.
And as if reading his mind Pepper said, "I'm serious Tony. When was the last time you slept?"
"He's kept in check, for now at least, but, Tony, it's never wrong to be too careful.", the Black Panther sounded concerned, something the genius never heard from him before.
He hesitated before answering, Rhodey only waiting to hammer his self-worth back into his head. "Alright."
"I took a nap a few hours back."
Peter's radius of action mostly contained Queens, so it was to no surprise that the tracker led him to one of the district's more populated parts. Except that no one was walking the street, some cars were abandoned as a traffic light switched from red to yellow to green while all the shops seemed empty. The only sign of life was the beat-up red and blue form of Spiderman, trying to let himself down to the ground at a slow pace, the web connected to the edge of a fire escape ladder.
Which was admittedly the worst part about his whole appearance if he was being honest. It was greasy and lay flat on his head. The brown strands slowly turning grey and growing out. He needed a haircut, he thought.
"If you are in the wrong, then so am I. You are not the only one who signed the Accords.", Rhodey insisted.
"I was hoping I would find you here.", the King said and stopped a few feet away from the engineer. He held himself tall as always, his clothes without wrinkles and a small open smile resting on his lips.
Tony avoided her eyes and clicked with his tongue, "Like I said, incident in the lab."
"You.", the Colonel said and pointed towards the engineer's chest. "So stop selling yourself short and blaming every little inconvenience in someone's life on yourself."
For the first time in years, it was not Tony Stark the anger was directed at, a surprise to probably everyone in the room who worked with Ross for long enough. No, the source was one Steven Grant Rogers aka Captain America aka proclaimed criminal who broke his imprisoned teammates out of the Raft, Ross super-secret high-security prison as if stealing a pack of chewing gum from a corner store.
They were already outside. Happy was waiting in the black limousine for Peter to drive home but the question made Tony stop in his tracks for a short moment.
"Looks like you didn't think at all.", she told him, "Tony, you should be more careful. What if it weren't just a bruise and a cut. It's near your eyes so what if you damaged them or have gotten a concussion? Nobody would've been close to help."
"Vision is there."
Rhodey just rolled his eyes at his antics and stood up again.
"Secretary Ross seems quite determined to justify any method he has to use in order to arrest Captain Rogers." T'Challa didn't have to say it out loud for Tony to get the message behind his words.
"Lucky shot.", the teenager pouted. "How long is it gonna take to fix the suit?"
"Tony, why didn't you answer any of my calls? I tried to reach you for hours now.", Rhodey said as he entered the lab through the glass door.
T'Challa turned around and gave a short nod, "Consider your message received."
Tony landed a few feet away from the enhanced teenager and when Peter's feet finally touched the concrete beneath him, Tony put a hand to his shoulder and made him face him. Through the mask, he couldn't tell what kind of expression Peter was wearing but from the way he clutched his right side, Tony could guess that it was laced with pain.
"In two hours."
He began to loosen up his tie as his feet carried him down the hallways of the compound. To everyone else he would appear as collected, with his dark grey three pieced suit, his hair freshly washed and styled and the expensive cologne resting on his skin, if it weren't for the flaring of his nostrils and his furrowed eyebrows that gave away his irritated anger.
After a few moments of radio silence, Tony snapped out of whatever thought he was caught in and began focusing on the person in front of him again. "Sorry."
Tony stayed silent.
"Tony.", she began and said man winced at her partly disappointed, partly exhausted tone, "Whatever is going on with you has to stop."
Peter just rolled his eyes as Tony turned his back, "They're not pajamas, Mr. Stark."
" I know that and I don't doubt his competence to handle this situation, but I don't want Ross causing an international incident because of it. He is that fanatic."
Bucky was relieved when he heard the news that the Wakandan's were so nice to replace his arm. It was unfamiliar to not feels the weight of the metal dragging down his left shoulder, to feel the metal fusing with the scarred skin of his shoulder, and to be able to grab things with his left hand even though he was right-handed.
To say that the meeting didn't go well was the understatement of the century. It began with the snarky comments Ross thought of as necessary as soon as Tony entered the conference room. Vision was already present, dressed in a dark green turtleneck and black pants, his robotic eyes taking in every detail in the room. There were some CIA agents and, to his immense surprise, King T'Challa who sat down in the chair farthest away from Ross. Lucky bastard.
------
"I don't want him to get into trouble because of us. Ross can be an, well... "
"Sure thing, boss.", replied the AI and automatically turned on the lights of the workshop, so no injuries from stray projects Tony kept laying around, would occur.
Tony looked guilty when he met Pepper's eyes. He could see the hardness with an undertone of worry in her's and felt his hands fist the cloth on the inside of his suit pants pocket. "I know, Pep, and I'm sorry. You always try you're best to navigate the company and I make it difficult. I am sorry."
"Good?"
Hope you like the chapter and stay tuned for the next one! :)
"What can I say, you make it just too easy of a reaction."
"I see them. They are all dead. And there was nothing I could do but watch.", he sucked in a breath and clasped his hands together tightly to keep them from shaking. He then let out a bitter laugh, "It is all my fault. Always was, always will be. How could I dare to consider that I could finally do things right."
T'Challa gave an easy smile, "Perhaps not, but with all respect, the Secretary won't be able to do much about me. You, on the other hand, seem to be on his radar for quite a while now."
The two heroes were lounging on the barstools around the kitchen island, the cool grey marble a nice feeling on his sweaty skin. After getting checked over by the medical staff stationed at the compound and declared free to go, Tony insisted on ordering take-out after having to listen to Peter's stomach rumble on the whole way back.
The genius looked at her outstretched hand that waited for him to hand over the glasses. "It's nothing, Pep. Have a little more faith in me."
"What?", the man asked confused but pulled the car over, away from the ongoing traffic, and stopped in a parking zone nearby. "What are you doing?"
"I am afraid he is getting suspicious. At first, he was certain he had me under his control after he learned about the...disagreements regarding Rogers and me, but truth to be told, I just don't care anymore. What he does and what he doesn't do is not my responsibility."
He ignored the chuckle coming from his mentor in favor of inhaling the remaining slices. With his enhanced metabolism, good food was a must.
They were in the Princess' lab, surrounded by the vibranium mine and Bucky had never seen something quite as beautiful before. All of Wakanda was beautiful, so very different from the neighborhood he grew up in and all the places he remembered visiting as the Winter Soldier. The mix of futuristic and traditional styles made it look like a place out of science-fiction movies and Bucky could imagine spending more time exploring all Wakanda has to offer.
"Whoa, what happened to the armor?", asked a curious Peter Parker as he eyed the dented in hunk of metal.
and never seemed to do anything
Bucky sat on the makeshift bed, the white duvet cover a bit wrinkly from his movements. His hair that now reached his shoulder, was pulled back in a bun, a few of the shorter strands falling in his face. The white tank top he was wearing showed the stump where the leftover of his metal arm was. The edges were burned from the blast of the Iron Man suit's repulsor and some of the wirings hang loosely.
"Is Ross acting up again?", the blonde asked, not so sure if he even wanted to know. Whenever the Secretary was involved, his blood pressure skyrocketed.
"Tony.", he spoke softly, careful to not scare the other. But said person didn't respond in the slightest, so he tried again, "Tony, can you hear me?"
"It could've been worse.", the king replied.
"You are worrying too much, Captain. He is supposed to be back in the next hour.", she answered and then stood up to walk towards the desk with many screens.
"Mr. Stark!", the boy exclaimed surprised at the billionaire's presence, "What are you doing here?"
"If it's nothing then you wouldn't mind giving them to me.", she said matter-of-factly with a stern expression.
I apologize once again for any grammatical or spelling mistakes.
"I'm surprised Ross hasn't figured it out yet. How does he think two soldiers escape the snowy landscape of Siberia on foot?", Tony snorted and finally took out his phone to text back Pepper. He had been ignoring her text for two days now and felt a bit guilty about it. He guessed he had to make true to booking tickets for a visit to the art gallery for her.
"I would rather have you not jump around in your pajamas for the next day.", he grumbled.
Another thing on the list of things he does wrong. Pepper is an outstanding CEO and better for Stark Industries than he could've ever been. He must admit, when he first made Pepper take over the company, it was because she was the only option. He was dying and had not much time left, the least he could do was make sure that his company was in good hands after he was gone. Also, Pepper deserved to be rewarded for the many years she put up with him as his PA.
"Boss, the Spiderman suit of Mr. Parker has been penetrated. I sense the danger of injury."
Tony just shrugged his shoulders and tried to summon a smile. From the look on Pepper's face, he must've failed miserably. "Alright.", he then agreed while knowing that he will either lay awake for a few hours before giving up and starting to work again or, and that was more likely, going right back to where he left off.
Pepper let out a soft gasp when his whole face came into view and Tony directed his eyes to stay on the wall behind the redhead, intensely watching the painting hung up there together with the green plant that he thought was plastic. He knew what he looked like. A bruise was forming itself around his right eye, the same spot where his previous one just finished healing completely, and the cut right under the left eyebrow, already cleaned but still hurting.
The silence of the hallway was defeating, only his loud footsteps cut through it like a razor through paper and Tony had to restrain himself from lashing out at one of the walls.
"Nice of you to finally show up.", she hissed at him quietly, not wanting to interrupt the meeting again.
"I'll heal."
"Brother!", exclaimed Shuri when she saw T'Challa walk in, followed by two Dora Milaje, "How was America, did some white man try to start a war again?"
After a few deep breaths, Tony spoke, "They are coming back. The nightmares I mean." His voice is shaking, so different from the usual Tony Stark.
"An asshole? Yeah, I think even people who haven't met him personally know that. But your worry is unnecessary. Even if Secretary Ross should find out about your whereabouts, I doubt anything is going to happen to my brother. He is a king and the Black Panther, don't forget that."
"I thought you said Vision was with Rhodey at his physical therapy."
"Touche."
When the papers were somewhat organized he looked down at his attire. His old band shirt was dirty and far beyond saving from grease stains. His jeans were ripped at some parts and he wasn't wearing any shoes. He glanced around the space to search for them but then decided to fuck it and gave all his attention to his hair instead.
There were reasons why he avoided talking to Secretary Ross, one of them contained the fact that just sitting in the same room as this man made murder look less illegal. Ross had been bugging them with such meetings since he came back from Siberia. He didn't even have time to let the wounds in his face heal before he had to sit in a conference room and listen to Ross complain about literally anything and everyone. It was getting tiring real fast.
"Hey, Rhodeybear. It's good to see you too.", replied the engineer while still fumbling with his hair. It seems like some of the oil got in it and is now clumped together.
Of course, Peter knew that the Avengers broke up, everyone did, as every news station around the globe spoke about it for weeks. But Tony guessed the question was fair, after all, most of the compound was uninhabited, the light out and the rooms collecting dust.
Tony said nothing and instead pointed above him when he sat down on the stool. Peter's eyes followed his finger and faced the scorch marks, "Oh."
"Sorry kid, but acid guns?", Tony asked.
"Looks like we just have to wait for what my brother has to say.", Shuri shrugged and went back to the holograms and screens, beginning to model what is about to become Bucky's new arm.
Steve watched in silence as the Princess worked. All the technology still had the ability to make him feel out of time even after spending time with Tony helped him get by over the years.
"From who?"
"And your burned chicken breast?", Tony wanted to know and pointed at the already healing skin hidden under the shirt.
"Oh, don't bullshit me Tony.", she said, her arms now crossing in front of her chest, "Look, I know that a lot has happened this month and I want to help you, I do. You are my best friend but, Tony, you also have responsibilities that you can not neglect. And turning up to meetings, that also regard you may I add, on time is one of them."
"If I had done more, maybe you wouldn't need these braces to keep walking. I failed to protect you. God, I even brought a teenager with me to the fight in Germany.", his voice was getting quieter, his gaze more unfocused as he looked past Rhodeys shoulder at the wall, completely unseeing and lost in his thoughts.
Tony just checked the time before closing the holograms for good. 1:13 pm. Way too early to even consider dealing with the Secretary.
The genius knew that this was not the last time Peter was going to join him in the workshop. Even though the damage has been repaired, Tony already had an upgraded version of the suit in mind, one where even acid guns had no way of penetrating the material. So something like that would not happen twice.
"Why not sell him out then?"
. Honestly, Tony had been in this hole before. Where he lived with the constant fear of the coming and struggled with his self-worth. It is nothing new. That doesn't mean it sucks any less though.
"You know, one day your eyes are going to get stuck if you keep rolling them.", Tony countered.
walk. And you know who I can thank for that?"
Pepper sighed before stopping her gaze on Tony's black shades, "Why are you even wearing these? It's raining outside, you'll hardly need them."
Rhodey seemed to recognize the dilemma the other was in, he just kneeled in front of him, put a hand on his knee, and squeezed a bit, letting him take his time to sort out his thoughts.
"Watching out for you so you don't accidentally land 6 feet under anytime soon.", stated the ironed hero, "Care to explain what in the world you were fighting?"
"Fine.", he muttered and took off the sunglasses. He knew that if he tested his luck any further it would end with him and Pepper fighting a possible fistfight. They were both stubborn like that.
So yes, even though getting threatened with a prison cell wasn't anything new, especially when it came to Ross and their colorful history, his mood has reached the Earth's core.
"Go home, Tony. And take a nap.", his CEO advised him, "You need it."
I'm back with a new chapter!
And it was true. Rogers was an adult who could make his own decisions, Tony is not going to interfere with that (he learned it the hard way).
"Call your aunt. Tell her you're going to be home a bit later than usual, Happy will drive you.", said Tony while stashing away the empty pizza boxes.
Tony didn't hesitate for long and put the case on the ground and pulled at the handles, gauntlet automatically surrounding his hands. Then he pulled the rest to his chest, the metal enveloping him, the arc reactor flickering to life and the display inside his helmet lighting up while FRIDAY's voice gave him directions. Tony ignored the passerby's ogling him and taking out their phones to film. He just put his hand straight to his side and seconds later he was soaring over the rooftops and packed streets.
"Rude. That's going to cost you points on the 'Who is Tony Stark's best friend' chart."
Now, Tony had experience with over-the-top people who thought they could rule the world. He was CEO of a company once and the board members were anything but pleasant (and maybe they were just bitter about being on the receiving end of Tony's snark and irritation). So when Ross began the meeting, Tony had the hope that it would be over quickly and he could crawl back in his workshop and not resurface for another three days. But like always, the universe seemed out for blood as the Secretary spoke with his unnecessary booming voice, laced with anger.
"Well, looks like I'm taking a break. FRIDAY, please make sure the lab stays secure and that DUM-E does not accidentally cause a fire again."
Peter looked down at the hole in his suit. The edges were black and smoky while the skin took on an angry red color, it blistered and peeled off at some parts. "Oh, it's nothing, really. You didn't have to come all the way here.", Peter dismissed but his voice was shaky and laced with pain.
"Ross has planned a meeting regarding the Accords. He wishes for everyone to be present, especially you, as you bailed out the last few times.", Rhodey didn't even sound accusing, just tired and Tony could not blame him.
"Not important.", the billionaire replied, stubbornly avoiding letting his eyes wander to the red, white, and blue shield stashed away behind a shelf, a traitorous part peeking out of the bag he put it in.
"And after I disarmed him, the police took him into custody and then you showed up.", he finished.
Truth to be told, Tony didn't know what exactly was bothering him. Maybe it was everything. The whole Accords situation. Ross breathing down his neck. The empty compound. His best friends damaged legs. The fact that he was getting too fucking
He told Rhodey about them, of course, he did. If not him, then who else? Rhodey had always been there for Tony, no matter if it was at a college party where he drank way too much for a 15-year-old and passed out with the danger of choking on his vomit or after the whole dilemma with Afghanistan and the shrapnels in his heart. There wasn't any person he could trust more than the Colonel, maybe not even Pepper who was loyal by his side for so many years.
Tony held his breath as his AI fed him all the data she collected from Peter's suit, a function he integrated for exactly such a situation. It seems all the layers that make his suit has been pierced, a fact that surprised Tony a bit. What the hell is he fighting? Because Tony tried to make sure that the teenager's suit would be safe against any kind of blade, bullet, or even fire. A way to keep Peter from injuries and make Tony feel better about letting a fourteen-year-old fight people in the streets.
"Don't you dare to ignore me again, Tony. I swear to you, I will personally stomp down your lab's door.", she threatened and then also turned around after the quick salute Tony send her way, her eyes rolling but concern bubbling deep down.
"And what's up with the black eye?", Peter wanted to know, half expecting to be dismissed again.
The large kitchen and living room, fitting for the large amount of people that were supposed to find their home here, were completely and unsurprisingly empty. It has been a while since he has been up here. Most of his time is spent either in his lab or the business sector of the compound. He doesn't even sleep in his bedroom anymore. The countertops of the kitchen were clean, probably due to Vision who takes his time cooking sometimes, the connected living room on the other hand was dark. The lights were out and the shutters closed. He could practically see the dust settling on the furniture.
For the sake of the story, Bucky is not going into cyro state again and remains awake.
"Let's go, Rhodeybear, to the pits of hell."
Peter bit into the pizza slice dripping with cheese. He moaned as he tasted the food in his mouth after such a long and truly shitty day of crime-fighting against an overpowered chemist with nasty acid-firing guns.
Seeing the gleeful expression return on his best friend's face made Steve smile.
