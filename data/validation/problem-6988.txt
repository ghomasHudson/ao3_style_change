He waits while Steve reads it. He observes him as rage surges into him and then ebbs away while he looks at the pictures.
“We fell asleep?” Steve rubs his eyes, and despite his long beard, the gesture makes him look painfully young.
Tony letting Steve manhandle him, roughly, turn him around against the desk to open him up and press into him inch by inch. Tony guiding Steve to sit on the couch, his wiry thighs straddling Steve’s hips, the weight of his body—small, yes, but solid, strong, virile in such a beautiful way—on top of Steve’s.
Steve lies down on his back because now he wants to watch Tony, kiss him, touch his face. He spreads his legs again, holds his knees up to his chest. Tony sinks into him even though Steve is far from stretched enough for it, but the lube eases the way and Tony’s determination doesn’t let him waste any time after he bottoms out. He just fucks into Steve, harsh and relentless, and he tastes like come and tears and how much Steve adores him.
“St—” he tries to say, but Steve is somewhere else and replies only with a grunt. Tony could be many things right now—scared, sad, terrified, heartbroken, used, lonely, angry, melancholy, patronizing, witty, desperate—so he chooses to be none of them. He’ll let Steve finish, it wouldn't be the first time he waits for an Alpha to be done with him. He’ll let Steve finish; he’ll let Steve knot him while he keeps still and silent like a good Omega, then Steve will leave and Tony will pick up the pieces of himself and all his misconstrued hopes. It’s okay. It’s fine like this. Who would want to be Steve’s Omega anyway? It’d be a nightmare of unmet standards, Tony’s inadequacy dialed up to eleven all day every day. No, thank you.
“My name is Steve,” I say. It doesn’t mean anything, even to my own ears. But it’s been a few days, and some part of me must be starting to heal, although I don’t believe that’s possible. I’m just tired of my own thoughts. “What’s your name?” I ask.
“I’ll PayPal you five thousands Euros, right now, if you give me that bottle of scotch,” he says to the barista, pointing at the shelf behind him.
Tony looks at the side of Steve’s face, now serious, and realizes that Steve is, most of all, lonely.
Tony leans in, kisses Steve at the corner of his mouth, Steve can barely feel it, it’s so delicate. Tony’s mustache tickles at Steve’s skin.
The silence is deafening, Steve wants to scream and cry and scream some more and beg for clemency he doesn’t deserve.
Of course, Steve loves New York. The traffic, the noise, the terrible smell, the people. It makes him feel part of a big system, an indispensable gear in a complicated machine, like there’s always someone else to reach out to. It used to, anyway. Before.
In bed, Tony rolls over to curl up against Steve’s chest. Steve hugs him closer, but every movement is tentative, almost scared, almost like the first days, and Tony must notice, because he grabs one of Steve’s hands and places it on his hip—the bruised one—like that’s its proper place.
He comes back to himself to hear Tony’s concerned voice call his name. It’s a gift, each and every time it happens, each and every time Steve gets to feel Tony’s lips form the sound of his name. It’s the only thing of Tony that Steve can still claim as his in the privacy of his heartbreak.
“We don’t agree on anything,” Tony murmurs, and Steve rejoices in this small success. If they both keep their voices low, maybe they’ll talk and find a solution without burning everything on their way there.
Steve never expected to go out like this. He always thought he’d die in the field, Iron Man by his side. Maybe not as a result of some grand heroic gesture—he’s been careful with those since Sarah was born, they both have—but still in battle. Not whimpering in a bed damp with his own sweat and come.
Blood seeps out of him quickly, stains the concrete floor under them in a dark pool that becomes wider and wider while life oozes out of Tony’s eyes.
Steve opens the front door, steps outside in the little porch. He places the half-empty glass on the table, but doesn’t sit down on either of the chairs.
Sure, maybe Tony won’t reject him, but it’s been ten days, and Steve’s confidence is ripping at the seams. Maybe now he gets what Tony meant when he asked if it wasn’t worse, thinking about being with Tony without knowing if it would ever happen.
But before he can think or realize where he is and what he’s doing, Tony fires a heat blast from his gauntlet, and Steve crashes against the wall on the other side of the bedroom, emitting an inhuman sound when the air leaves his lungs with the violence of the impact.
Steve knows it’s hot, he can smell it in the air, but he doesn’t feel it. His hoodie isn’t enough. He doesn’t know why he feels like this.
“I think there’s something that didn’t make it to the books, regardless of the version. I think she kept it to herself for years, and maybe only shared it with her wife. But Laura died in 2013, and Stella is eighty years old. I think she wants to leave someone who knows this story in the world.”
The same place where he keeps his father, and Obie. Where he keeps Afghanistan. Where he keeps the worst of his guilt, the part of it that’s so sharp and evil that it wouldn’t let him right his own wrongs; it would only crush him with its weight. He keeps it bottled there, lets himself feel only the superficial spikes of it, so he can never forget what needs to be done (change, be better, do better) and why (for the people he loves, for everyone else, for those who can’t fight for themselves), but also so that he doesn’t wallow in despair.
His love for Tony changes every day; every day it becomes different and amazing; it’s an endless puzzle to which Steve adds a piece every day, to make it bigger and stronger and more complex and articulated.
“I want to throw myself off a building every time I think about that day,” Steve says, quietly, and maybe he meant to say it but not necessarily to be heard. “But I’d probably survive.”
“I had no idea,” Tony says, quietly, but with a despondent edge to his voice. It scares Steve, the shame it implies. “How could I…” he trails off and sighs, his shoulders trembling under the weight of his own guilt. “She ran away from one war only to walk into another.”
once a day. That’s the secret, the whole point. Don’t let the memory take over your mind. Don’t try to repress it completely either, because it will never work. Instead, let it come out of that hidden corner of your soul for just enough time to keep it at bay. But never a moment more.
Anyway, seriously, it’s not that he’s avoiding Steve, it’s just that he’s… yep, totally avoiding Steve. So, yeah, he has to admit that deciding not to turn on his heels and go back to bed when he saw that the only other person in the gym was, in fact, Steve, has to be considered the latest immensely bad idea in a fairly long string of immensely bad ideas.
Steve takes a moment to look at Tony’s body as well, slides his fingers, feather-like, over his right arm, blue with half-healed bruises. The result of their last fight with Doom and his bots. Dear Victor is gonna pay for those the next time Steve gets his hands on him.
Tony opens his eyes. He reaches up with one hand and cups Steve’s big face. Steve closes his eyes and leans into the touch, turns his head to press a kiss on Tony’s palm, so very soft.
When he bottoms out, Tony is rigid under him. Stretching out on top of him, he brings his mouth to Tony’s ear and whispers, “Breathe. Breathe.”
“It’s been a process, that’s for sure. But even back when we first met, I knew you weren’t the Tony Stark of the newspapers.”
Silence stretches between the three of them again, while they take a minute to appreciate the disheartening sadness of the situation. Tony looks down at the floor. He knows he has no real reason for it, but he feels ashamed. Exposed, bad. He removes his jacket and his vest. He loosens his tie. He doesn’t even know why he dressed so formally today. He rolls up the sleeves of his shirt. It’s too warm in the kitchen, but Nat and Bucky seem fine.
She takes his hand in hers and squeezes it. Tony watches them look at each other for a moment without speaking, while something is obviously being shared across their bond.
Steve holds himself up with one arm, his free hand slides around to cup the back of Tony’s head, then travels down to caress his neck, his throat, his chest—the scar, the arc reactor.
Back in the guest house, Steve puts Stella’s ragù in the fridge, and then drinks an entire bottle of water. Tony watches him while he does it: his head thrown back, his Adam’s apple bobbing up and down, his lips gleaming with water when he finishes the bottle, but his breathing isn’t labored. Of course it isn’t.
It is a bit awkward, in the bedroom. Steve looks at him with anticipation, openly, as if waiting for Tony to say something, decide something, give him a clue.
He feels every single beat of his heart. It makes him so uncomfortable, being so aware of the blood rushing through his veins, the way it pulses in his neck, in his head.
, but Tony is already sinking down on him without displaying any sign that he thought about preparing himself at all.
The only thing Steve doesn’t particularly love is how small the space around the Duomo is: the piazza suffers from it, the city presses in from all sides, doesn’t allow the building to breathe like it should.
“If you peel the potatoes, I’ll cut them up. So we can roast them,” Tony says, without looking at Steve.
“Yeah. There’s this popular science programme that’s been airing for years here in Italy, and she was often their guest. Whenever they needed an astrophysicist they’d call her.”
But if Steve takes this now, what’s going to stop him from taking all the rest? What’s going to stop him from turning violent, from tackling Tony to the ground and tearing his clothes away? What’s going to stop him from ordering Tony to strip and sit on his lap and moan like the pretty Omega he is whether he likes Steve’s huge fat knot shoved into him or—
The armor retreats into the reactor. Tony starts stripping and Steve tears his gaze away, fixing it over the heap of dirty designer clothes falling onto the grass.
He doesn’t look at Steve while he says all this, but the simple fact that he says it at all is more than Steve expected.
And all he can give himself is a bunch of excuses: that at first their relationship wasn't the best, that he was scared he’d ruin it later, because how can you show up to someone and tell them something life-changing like,
The sketch—done with a blue pen—shows Tony in his workshop, holographic screens dancing all around him. He has a big smile on his face, the skin at the sides of his eyes crinkled with joy. He’s looking up, at the ceiling, and there’s a little bubble next to his mouth that says, “J?”
“I’m glad to see you in a good mood,” he says, and he regrets it for a moment when he sees that Tony isn’t laughing anymore. But then his breathing grows labored and faster, his moans louder, and, well, Steve is okay with this. He sucks Tony’s cock into his mouth, keeps pumping his fingers into him, and he massages his balls with his other hand until Tony comes in his mouth, and it tastes like his slick, but
Steve is not there yet, though, and Tony wants it like that for now. A few hours more. A few hours more of him, alone with this, turning it over and over in his head as though he hasn’t done it already ad nauseam. But he needs this. He needs to do it just for a little bit more, and then he’ll tell Steve, and then, maybe, maybe, this whole thing will end with something that isn’t screams against concrete walls, ice drying the blood on their skin; rage, rage, rage and hate and grief and sorrow and betrayal and wounds too deep to be borne, much less cured.
He sees Tony, suddenly. He even smells him. His mind is playing sick tricks on him, but Steve finds himself grateful for this. It won’t feel so lonely, dying.
Steve is not a poet, he is versed in different kinds of art, but this is it, this must be what centuries of literature are about: holding someone, that someone holding you back, promises of never letting go.
He closes his eyes and waits for Tony to throw his anger at him, because he shouldn’t assume, and he definitely shouldn’t pressure, much less demand.
There’s Bucky in the frame. His hair is a mess, he’s wearing a tank top and boxers, and has a very visible hickey under his ear. And, most importantly, a big, tired smile on his face.
Tony pretends that he’s not hurt by this realization, because it makes sense. Honestly, it just does.
Steve is waiting for him, patiently leaning back against a table, arms crossed over his chest and face pensive, his hair falling over his forehead and catching the light just right.
“I got the information about your parents right before SHIELD fell. It was incomplete, with no definite or credible source. I didn’t know how to tell you. I thought, you know, it’s too personal, we’re not that close. But I knew it’d be important to you as it was to me. So, first of all, I needed to verify the information. I put Sam on it for the most part, but I worked on it too. And we got proof. The tape Zemo showed us... after the SHIELD data dump, someone got their hands on a file with a description of the video, and bragged about it on the internet, enough to reach Sam. That night, before I went to Lagos... I wanted to tell you. ‘Cause by then I was reasonably sure it was true and also… during those three days at the compound, we, we talked, remember? Remember how much we talked?”
Tony has tried, really, to push that night as far away as possible from himself, distance himself from it, put it in a tiny box and lock it inside a dusty and abandoned room deep in his mind, one of those places where he never looks.
“Yeah. I mean that maybe we aren’t just an alternative future, maybe we are also an alternative universe. Maybe Spider-Man can go back to his own timeline/universe and leave ours… unperturbed. But it’s a big chance we are taking here. There are so many things that could go wrong, I—”
His cock is hard in Steve’s hand. Steve moves his fingers up and down Tony’s shaft, slow and lovely, and Tony winces and twitches to keep from screaming.
an MIT graduate, everyone always forgets that—but he also has experience with prosthetics and how they work, so he can offer suggestions based on his own experience.”
They cut my testicles off. They burned them months ago, but now they decide that I’m better off without them. They might be right. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to have an erection again. I can barely even pee.
He’s about to attempt an apology, but Tony straightens his shoulders, and his demeanor changes into something fake and constructed.
Steve sort of wants to laugh. “You must stop ignoring JARVIS when he tells you to eat or sleep. Usually those are clues to gauge how long you’ve been here.”
Steve wants to die. He was supposed to do all that. He was supposed to be the one who killed them all, that got Tony home. Instead, he’s useless. A useless Alpha that’s no good at anything. His Omega doesn’t want him. His Omega doesn’t need him.
In the end, there’s a sort of tiredness around Tony’s eyes, an awareness, resignation. He visibly pushes it all down and plasters the sensual smirk from before onto his face.
Steve kneels on the bed next to him, and strokes his back, the scratches he put there—they sting a bit, in the best way. He bends down to lick them, and Tony doesn’t know which is better, the sweep of Steve’s tongue or the scrape of his beard on his skin.
Sarah comes back after a while. Tony changes into his sleeping clothes, and they huddle close in bed, Steve as still as possible, Sarah between him and Tony.
“That day, when I came to the Mansion,” Stella goes on, “it was shortly after the first time he shoved her. She was unharmed, but scared, and called me over the phone. I told her I’d visit her in a couple of months, when I’d be in New York. And I did.”
“You,” Steve tries, but speaking is hard and his heart is going to burst any minute now. “You’ve decided?” he asks.
When it comes to Tony, Steve starts vibrating out of his own skin, and becomes someone he hardly knows, sometimes.
. He lets it all out, and Steve doesn’t flinch, doesn’t look scared, doesn’t look disgusted, he doesn’t even look sad.
But there’s a prickling sensation unfolding in his guts. It goes from fastidious to annoying, from annoying to insistent, from insistent to bordering on painful.
“Mmh, go back to sleep, Tony, it’s early,” Steve mumbles, and closes his eye again, but he starts stroking Tony’s back, every time reaching lower and lower. Tony isn’t past wiggling his butt. Ha. Sleep now, soldier.
He distracts himself with his tablet, replies to Pepper’s email from a couple of hours ago when the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed. He posts a few tweets to make everyone believe he’s vacationing in Polynesia, adds the pictures Happy sent him from there. He wants to text Peter, ask if Karen took care of the issue with the binder in the suit, but he’s probably (hopefully) asleep right now. He’ll do it later.
There’s a loud ringing in his ears. He feels weirdly hyper-aware of himself, as though he’s suddenly able to feel the blood rushing in his veins, his heart beating, his internal organs working.
He takes off his gloves, pulling at the strap of the first one with his teeth, Steve following his every move. He lets the gloves fall to the floor, scratches at his face with his fingers. His hands are still wrapped, and he should take care of that. Probably. Soon. He should. He should tell Steve he wants to stop. Enough training for the day. Night. Whatever.
He sets off down the hill, hurrying through on that same trail he walked with Tony a few days ago, even though it really seems like a lifetime has passed since that day under the cherry tree.
A few minutes pass in silence, then Steve hears Tony sniff, blow his nose, wash his face. He comes out of the bathroom, eyes red and puffy, face bent down so Steve can’t see it too well.
Steve looks at him, still doubtful. “You sure you’re gonna be okay without... I mean, two hours is a long time to spend empty during a heat, and you could need—”
“It’s better like this, anyway,” he continues. “The thought of doing it with anyone else… I don’t want anyone else.”
He holds a t-shirt in his hands but stops before taking it out of the drawer. It looks suspiciously like Tony’s Black Sabbath t-shirt, the one he’d lost a few years ago, before Sarah was born. Before Steve ran away and came back.
there’s the fact that his dick doesn’t really get very hard anymore. Reaching an orgasm has felt like a chore lately. He can’t take Viagra because of his heart. And he knows that he wouldn’t feel like this if he weren’t
For a moment, Steve thinks of the worst. Of the absolute worst thing, the one he could never live with.
Steve looks at him. “You should’ve been the leader since the beginning. I wasn’t ready. I needed time to recover and instead SHIELD…”
Steve was already half-hard from the adrenaline of their fight, he tells himself it’s normal and it happens very often to a lot of men and it’s nothing to be ashamed about, really, but it never happens when he’s sparring with Carol or Sam or Luke, only Tony, for some reason. For some damn reason.
Steve is shivering, badly, and it’s not just the cold in his heart. He remembers his promise, and he can’t fail Tony now. He can’t fail Tony again.
They stop at a gas station, and Steve gives Tony the day’s drawing in the car. It’s made with charcoal, and Tony immediately thinks that it looks really nice. He seems to always think that of Steve’s art, it’s always pleasing to his eye.
He opens the sketchbook and takes a loose piece of paper from it. He holds it out for Tony to take it.
Steve looks back at him, intense and suddenly scared, because the carefully constructed wall that’s been separating them so far is crumbling down, and Steve doesn’t know what’s beyond it, and his bravery fails him right now, when he’s about to find out.
There’s only the bond in his mind, shining like a sun, and he’s grateful that he can find it so easily now. It was terrifying, before. Being alone, after Tony had been in his head again—
Steve groans and whimpers, out of breath, sweat making his skin stick to Tony’s. A squelching noise fills the room every time Steve thrusts into Tony’s body, and Tony wonders where all that slick is coming from.
Steve is holding his phone and charger in his hand. The phone is running out of battery. He wanted to plug it into the USB slot in the dash, but he hasn’t been able to do it so far.
“I’d like to hear an opinion,” Tony says after a while, keeping his tone light to encourage a response.
“Hi,” Steve replies, stepping into the room. He looks around himself curiously, trying to spot what changed since the last time he was here.
It happens in a second. Tony contracts the muscles around Steve. Steve twitches inside him. A shiver goes through his whole body. Steve props himself up with his hands on the bed, movements uncharacteristically unsure, and he fucks into Tony again.
Steve pulls out of Tony’s mouth, releases his hair. Tony opens his eyes and smiles, says something easy and friendly that doesn’t allude to what they just did, quickly exits the shower and goes wash himself in the next stall.
Next, there are spices and herbs. Tony takes them from the vases on the porch, rinses them in the sink, chops them up on a wooden cutting board.
He wishes they could just talk. Just once. That he could apologize for real, looking Tony in the face. It’s made things easier, in the past. Worse too, sometimes, but Steve wants to be hopeful, now, since no one can see him in the darkness. He wants to imagine it going well.
Something angry and displeased plays around Tony’s mouth. “They didn’t give you any food, did they? Hydra. I suspected, but then the doctors told me. They had to feed you through an IV.”
Tony pulls out of him; Steve sits up on his elbows, and a second later Tony is coming all over his face in hot spurts that hit Steve’s beard and his tongue, because there’s no way he’s keeping his mouth shut for this. He strokes himself to a second orgasm while Tony’s come is still dripping from his chin down on his chest.
Steve thinks about it for a long time, and they feel like days when they meet Tony’s impatient curiosity.
“I remember you.” Tony feels the air become hot in his lungs, his eyes stinging, his skin prickling with betrayal. “You lied to me.”
Stella’s orchard is grey and humid; the timid winter sun doesn’t reach past the branches, even though the foliage is sparse.
And of course it’s not like that between Steve and him, not anymore. That ship has sailed and sunk more spectacularly than the Titanic. But still, the stuff they’ve been doing… Tony would feel uncomfortable, if he were to discover just now that Steve was in a relationship with someone else this entire time.
He looks at him, at his face and his eyes, for impossibly long seconds, and Steve pretends he can still breathe, that his life doesn’t hang on the next few minutes, that he’s okay with the possibility of Tony refusing him, in the end, because at least he’d know.
Steve slides his slick finger into Tony and the heat of him overwhelms him. It’s all there, the warmth he has missed all these months. It’s inside Tony.
Silence stretches between them. Tony looks into the distance, focuses on nothing in particular. The mountains take up the landscape.
—) and tears streaming down his face for someone he misses so much it hurts, for someone that will never come back to him.
It’s like he can feel Steve’s emotions rushing into him from the pads of his fingers. How delicate and careful every movement is, how much Steve wants to make things better for him, how much he cares about him. How much he loves him. How Steve still can’t believe he’s allowed this, and how his hands sometimes still tremble with surprise. All of it, Tony feels it through his skin; it passes from Steve to him with touches that are kind and warm, instead of awful punches in the cold.
She takes a deep, steadying breath. The gray metal of her armor shines in the soft light of the room.
Steve is trying to playing it cool, and he’s doing a decent job of it, all things considered, except he isn’t really breathing while he waits for an answer.
Survival compels me to fight, to win, to kill. But it doesn’t matter. Them or me, it actually doesn’t matter at all.
Tony breaks their close-mouthed kiss and pushes himself back up. He resumes rocking his hips against Steve’s and his scent is everywhere.
He struggles to walk, to see around himself. To see anything at all. Tony looks down at his chest, where the reactor should shine, and his heart skips a beat.
Steve starts gathering his clothes with a sigh and wipes Tony’s tears from his neck with the palm of his hand.
In the end, Tony leaves Maria in the play cot in the living room. She is asleep, but if she wakes up he figures she can spend a few minutes by herself in a safe space.
“I’ll take what I can get,” Tony says, but he feels Steve tense up behind him. He turns his head to find a displeased expression on Steve’s face, the one he makes when something doesn’t go like he planned it to, and okay, he’s gonna strategize a different way to go about it,
Warnings: description of physical and emotional abuse (from Howard, Maria and Tony are the victims). There's also a moment close to the end of the chapter where Steve and Tony are physically rough with each other (ymmv but please be careful if you're easily upset by this stuff).
There’s a very long silence. Tony thinks Steve must have fallen asleep, but then he speaks, and his voice is mangled with tears.
How are they supposed to accomplish anything if Tony throws jabs at Steve any occasion he gets? It’s not even a conscious effort, but it’s still something that’s happening inside him. It’s exhausting. He wants to stop, but he doesn’t know how.
“I could never bring myself to go through my mother’s personal belongings. But after I…” Tony pauses, looking suddenly very sad, “
Steve falls asleep the moment the words leave his lips, so he doesn’t feel Tony’s tears on his forehead, and he doesn’t hear Tony whispering, “I thought you were going to be, for me. That day.”
And Steve remembers that for some reason he was struck by this thing, the thing about a woman being in love with another woman. And maybe it wasn’t even true, maybe it was just that she was a good singer and that was a good song and they didn’t change the names or the pronouns, sure, it was way more likely, but Steve—
Tony follows the direction of Steve’s gaze, and his eyes widen in understanding. He pulls his shirt down to cover himself, and the gesture wrenches a whimper out of Steve.
“It’ll be alright, sweetheart. We’re going home. We’re together again, finally. Everything will be alright, I promise.”
“You know, Peter told me once, that when you can do the things we can do, but you choose not to do them—if something bad happens, it’s on you. Power is useless without responsibility.”
When Steve’s almost done, Tony stumbles into the kitchen, sitting heavily at the table. Steve sets the plate in front of him, and they eat in silence. Tony’s movements are very slow at first, but the more he eats the more he seems to wake up.
Steve doesn’t understand for a moment—he needs to pay more attention, he’s starting to look stupid—then realizes Tony is talking about their food.
His other bodily functions have been messed up as well, and Tony finds himself almost thankful for constipation. Digestion seems impossible.
time ago. Still, agreeing to go out on a date feels a bit too disingenuous on Steve’s part now. The pantomime was useless; all Steve had to do was say no and then ask for what he really wanted, so they’d be on the same page since the beginning. Tony would’ve said yes.
He wipes his face with his hand, movements quick and jerky. He sniffs, his chest heaving with how hard he’s breathing.
“Shhh. Concentrate, Avenger,” Steve orders, with his stern but kind voice, and punctuates his words with a sharp pressure against Tony’s perineum. He allows his massage to gradually grow firmer and firmer, while keeping an eye on Tony’s reactions, careful to remember what works and what doesn’t, what makes his dick twitch and what makes his thighs tremble.
Steve’s hips stutter, his whole body shakes, until he throbs inside Tony and comes again, gritting his teeth, emitting a groan that tastes like that abyss inside him, made of all his regrets, of all the years in which doing this was an impossible fantasy, the silly delusion of a lonely boy who wanted to make a home out of a person and thought that person had no inclination to satisfy him.
, he gets rock hard in the span of seconds, and Tony doesn’t know how much longer he can go on like this, how much more Steve will put up with him and having sex twice a month (if Tony is feeling good).
Tony’s tried basically anything that could work with him. He’s leaned onto Steve’s shoulder while they were watching a movie with the others, has hugged him every chance he got, has whispered in his ear when there was no real reason for it, and he’s even flirted across the team comms and made Jen groan and T’Challa go, “Ew.” But every time Tony tries to push at the edges of friendship and imply something different, Steve instantly draws back, or puts space between his body and Tony’s, or makes up an excuse to leave the room, or fails to respond to Tony’s jokes.
Tony presses his lips together, takes his phone out of his pocket, taps at it with his fingers. Quick, like kids do.
They watch the news during lunch, and Stella mutters something to herself now and then, harsh words meant for this or that politician.
A bite mark that doesn’t fade. That only happens when the Alpha is dead. If the bond is neglected or broken then the mark isn’t renewed, and eventually it goes away. But Tony’s never went away. It’s his own version of what happened to Steve’s ruts.
, he had told Tony, while life trickled out of him with every drop of blood. The last lie. The most unforgivable. He’s left Tony alone after promising he wouldn’t.
But it’s fine. If this is what Steve likes, then fine. Tony isn’t about to protest or ask for something different: if he does, the spell might break, Steve might come back to his senses and ask himself what the fuck is he doing with someone like Tony—an old and used Omega, notoriously damaged goods.
“Because I solved the issue with the cell codes and… Riri told me about Spider-Man. Steve. Don’t you get it?”
Steve establishes a fast rhythm with his head, just the way he knows Tony likes it, hollows his cheeks and sucks hard, keeps his teeth covered with his lips, uses every trick he knows, everything he has picked up from Tony or looked up on the internet; he doesn’t stop fucking Tony with his fingers, and after a while Tony lets out a long, guttural groan, ripped off from deep in his chest, and comes down Steve’s throat, while Steve has to keep Tony’s legs still, so he doesn’t kick Steve or hurts himself while he shakes, violently, tears streaming down his face. Mindless of Tony’s come dripping down his chin, Steve crawls up on top of Tony, careful not to crush him with his weight but still determined to hold him through the aftershock of his orgasm. It takes minutes before Tony comes down from the rush, and he’s still oversensitive when Steve tries to stroke his arm, but he smiles sweetly at Steve, one eye open and the other closed, and curls up with his head under Steve’s armpit, happy, sated, blissed-out.
When Tony’s right in front of him, Steve can’t resist the urge to touch him. He places his hands on Tony’s hips and leans forward, a smile still dancing on his lips. He closes his eyes and breathes Tony in, his skin as familiar as Steve’s own.
, Tony,” Steve takes his head in his hands, props his elbows on his knees, shoulders hunched low, sadness and resignation evident in the shape of his back. “God, what a mess,” he sighs and sits back up. “Anyway. I’m sorry. Really. I’m sure you have a lot of work to get back to so I won’t keep you.”
Tony doesn’t know how to describe it. It’s like he just got the wind knocked out of him the moment he was starting to cry. Tony really doesn’t know what to do.
“Shut the fuck up, Steve,” is Tony’s only reply. He starts cleaning up Steve’s face and neck with the wipes, hesitates around the cuts on his chest, is careful when lifting his arms to get at his armpits.
Because now the bond is there, starting to flourish again. So it’s even more unnatural that he can’t have his mate.
Steve smiles too, but his voice comes out in a little more than a whisper. “It’s always been you, Tony. At the center of it all. There’s always been you.”
He’s never been more sure of how he would’ve reacted if Steve had told him the truth right away, while they were sitting together somewhere safe, with a cup of coffee maybe, with Steve’s calm voice explaining it all to him.
“I hope. I’ll always hope. You and her are my whole world. I’ll never lose hope when it comes to you two.”
And while he speaks Tony does the thing, that thing Italians do when they push all their fingertips together and drag their hand to their chest and it’s so absurd and so, so funny and Steve has to bite the inside of his cheek to keep himself from bursting out laughing.
“I am,” Steve jokes, and Tony smiles, lazy, and a bit out of it. Sweat beads his hairline and he doesn’t seem all that capable of keeping his eyes open.
Steve walks to the car, places his bag on the backseat next to Tony’s. Then, he sits in the same place T’Challa was occupying just a minute ago.
“Just… look down at yourself for a moment, please?” he asks, so gentle Tony wants to cry, and he looks at himself and he sees—
Steve sits up too, looks at Tony’s small frame, his curls moving with the wind, and wishes he could do something, anything, to wash away the weariness from Tony’s face forever, make the lines of anguish disappear from around his eyes, heal the furrow that misery dug on his forehead.
The sharp cuts framing his lower abs in a V. His flat stomach. His thighs, the muscles rippling with the way he’s riding Tony. His cock, hard and beautiful, the head almost purple with arousal. His pretty blond hair falling over his forehead when he lowers his gaze to stare into Tony’s eyes for a moment, before closing them and picking up the pace.
He had stopped. Sort of. Since coming out of the ice he’s smoked, what, maybe ten cigarettes. But while he was in Wakanda...
Tony turns. He sighs, exasperated, closes his eyes and pinches the bridge of his nose, lifting his glasses with the gesture.
He adjusts the fish on the oven tray, over a sheet of greaseproof paper. He cuts even, round slices of lemon. He walks out on the porch with the scissors and gets a few herbs. He wants to mince them as fine as possible with the garlic, so he opens a couple of cupboards in search for the little mixer he knows must be somewhere. It pokes out from the top shelf. He tries to reach it, unsuccessfully. He tries again, goes on his tiptoes, strains and stretches as much as he can. Fuck it.
“Makes me wish I could hire a sniper and just get rid of him,” Stella says, and Steve blinks at her.
Tony’s touch is extremely delicate, and almost apologetic in how careful it is. He unwraps the wire from around Steve’s penis, slow when he pulls each barb from the skin. He produces a Swiss Army knife from somewhere and cuts the twine, then pulls the foreskin to the hilt and back over the shaft once or twice. He waits for blood to return to Steve’s penis, then he disinfects it and bandages it, taking particular care of the area where the knot usually grows. Finally, with some difficulty, Tony pulls the sweatpants up to Steve’s waist.
Steve first instinct when he meets Tony’s eyes is to reach out and touch him, caress his face or his neck. To hug him close, make him press his face to Steve’s chest and shield him from whatever’s on his mind.
Tony’s heart has been weak, unsteady, untrustworthy for a few years now, and yet Steve sees it shine as if it was made of diamonds.
“We are going to be,” Steve says, his tone soothing while he hugs Sarah tighter. “I promise you. Do you trust me? Do you trust us?”
“Not, not alone.” Steve tries out the words, how they feel on his lips. It’s a new concept for him, not being alone.
“I remember. Shut up,” he says, and kisses Tony’s nose right before he starts lathering up his face.
The day is hot and the countryside all for them. No one is going to bother them here, the whole world is just for them.
What if the universe, in all its inhumanity, has granted them only those three days at the compound, only that single night of peace? What if that’s everything they’re ever gonna get? What if Steve wouldn’t deserve anything more even if he could get it?
“Dude,” Rhodey says after running into Steve for the third time in three days. “What the hell’s happening?”
Ok, Luca, go back to her, alright? If you are a good kid I'll send a present to your house in a few days, mh?
The long nights in the compound, scheming, theorizing, building. I brought him coffee. He always said,
“I like to imagine that they can have some… quiet. That they can rest. Talk. Find some peace, maybe.”
He groans, but it’s nothing compared to the sound that comes out of Tony when the head of Steve’s dick makes its way past the first ring of muscle. It’s a whimper, coming from the deepest recess of his body, and it screams at Steve not to stop, so he keeps going.
Steve has also found a tumblr post about how old age can make the prostate hypersensitive, so while growing old may result in less sensitivity for the penis, that is not the case for the prostate. Prostate stimulation can help with erections, which must occur at least daily to keep the penis in good shape.
Steve straightens himself and strips down the rest of the way, throwing his uniform to the floor. He doesn’t care. He doesn’t care about anything.
Tony raises his hands to Steve’s face—he’s not crying. Tony brushes his fingers over Steve’s lips, and he gasps, startled by the touch, by how much he craves this contact. Tony feels minuscule kisses being pressed against his fingertips.
“Stop that,” he says, with the same tone he uses to give orders over the team comms, only this time it’s also thick with tears.
He cries. He clutches Tony’s arms and avoids looking at his face. He cries and cries, gasping for air, his shoulders shaking, his whole body taken by a convulsion when this, all of this, rushes out of him.
The wind howls outside; the incessant patter of the rain drowns away all other sounds around them. Tony stares outside, holding himself up with a shoulder against the recess in the wall where the French window is slotted in.
Tony talks about the Palio, a horse race held in the edges of the Piazza del Campo twice a year since the Middle Ages with very small changes over the course of the centuries. Each horse represents a contrada, a neighborhood of the city, and Tony says that there’s probably no greater sense of belonging than that of a senese to their contrada. Steve is fascinated by this, by humans doing the same thing over and over and over and loving it still, because it’s part of who they are, of their identity; it’s an intimate aspect of what it means to be born here.
Tony rubs his eyes, and looks at Steve, fast asleep, his blond hair spread over the white linen of the sheets, his thin top lip hidden by his mustache. His beard looks tidy and clean, but Tony has never seen him take care of it at all. Lucky bastard.
The guards beat us up every day. And they rape us every night. There’s not too many of them, so a few of us get spared the ordeal some nights, but never more than one or two in a row.
“Do you think they made the chapel cylindrical as a callback to the Round Table?” Steve suddenly asks.
Tony presses a button on the hinges of his glasses, keeps looking in the direction of the kid’s mother as discreetly as possible. “FRIDAY, can we get a home address for that kid and his family? Get them… I don’t know, StarkPads and… whatever they need. Check the medical records for those glasses, let’s keep tabs on any changes. We pay for everything the SSN
Tony’s sure that in Steve’s mind, this is meant to give Tony space; make him adjust without forcing him to share the room with someone who looks like the man. It makes sense, but it’s not something Tony needs. The man and Steve couldn’t be more different for him.
Tony’s voice is rough and cracks, but Steve leaves the chair and goes lay down next to him under the covers. They’re facing each other. Tony whispers, “Thank you,” and falls asleep.
He’s more subdued. He smiles less, talks less. He never laughs. He gets distracted while he’s working, and he startles back to full awareness to notice that two hours have passed while he was staring into nothing.
Tony hasn’t seen him yet. Steve doesn’t want to startle him, so he waits by the door without saying anything. His dick doesn’t particularly agree with this plan, but Steve is going to make it behave.
about the idea of them having sex, to seek Steve out, to tease him and lead him to bed with his sultry voice and wicked promises, to do things to Steve and let Steve do things to him that would make the most experienced person
The first thing that comes to his mind in order to deal with the pain, is to drink. Drink away all the hurt, physical and of any other kind, swallow as much alcohol as possible in one sitting and wait for the entire world to fade away, become a muffled memory, something Tony can observe through the thick bottom of a glass without being touched by it.
They’re obviously just friends, and yet Steve envies that familiarity, the affection, the reciprocal respect and esteem—professional and personal—even despite the lack of regular contact.
There’s a brief silence, and then Steve finds the courage to look Tony in the face. He gives him a small smile, and Tony’s eyes brighten in response.
He fucks up into Steve’s mouth, bracing himself on the bed with his uninjured arm, and tugs at Steve’s hair with the other. He moans, eyes rolling to the back of his head, and Tony feels the vibration of Steve’s throat with the tip of his dick.
Steve draws closer to him, slides down on the bed to line up his face with Tony’s belly. He lifts his t-shirt and ignores Tony grumbling about being woken up too early by his handsy Alpha.
“Did you make this for me or for her?” Tony asks, but his tone isn’t at all confrontational. He doesn’t notice that it might be until after the words have left his mouth.
“Sorry,” Steve whispers. Acknowledging his humiliation is still better than leaving what just happened unaddressed, but it takes all the courage he has left, and he still can’t do more than a murmur.
“What did she say?” Steve asks, and immediately looks ashamed of his curiosity. He blushes. “If you don’t mind sharing,” he adds.
“And it’s not just that, you know. Like, what’s the deal with your shoes? Why are they size 7? And your hands? And I feel like you weren’t this short before, even accounting for the lifts. You can’t reach the top shelf in the kitchen, even though it’s custom made, and I feel kinda stupid that I’m putting all these pieces together only now, and… What…”
They clear the table after dinner, and Steve cuts even slices from the peaches and passes them along to Tony and Stella, only now and then taking one for himself.
But being so intimately acquainted with it means that Tony knows when there’s no escape. From here, there isn’t.
He opens his arms, crucified into place by the armor forming around him from the metal bands at his wrists. It seems to appear from thin air, in little scales of red and gold that become instantly seamless against his skin.
Tony reaches behind himself, takes one of Steve’s hands into his. He brings it around his body, like he did that night on the couch while Steve was watching
They look at each other for several long seconds after they stop kissing, and Tony feels like he’s intruding in a very private moment, but at the same time he sort of can’t stop watching.
Tony hisses—he feels so sensitive and exposed and like he’s wearing his own skin inside-out. He’s hot, sweaty, and there’s an uncomfortable sting behind his navel that Steve’s cock can just barely relieve.
“You didn’t do anything wrong, Steve, okay? It’s okay. Listen. I was surprised. I didn’t think that was something you wanted.”
“Cut’s almost healed. It was bleeding a minute ago.” The connection between these two facts doesn’t need to be voiced. They look at each other. Steve has never been so angry at himself for being who he is.
, it’s all for him and him only; it’s the best part of Steve, the part that loves Tony), that helps him.
Steve interrupts himself, shuts his own mouth as fast as he can, but the damage is done. It’s like every time he’s called Tony
Steve groans when Tony’s fingers make their way past the first ring of muscle. He swears under his breath and he comes, again, while he clutches Tony’s shoulder as a warning. His thighs shudder and he pushes back against Tony’s hand, just a little bit, mindful of the fact that he’s still knotting Tony’s face. But Tony feels him riding his fingers, rolling his hips to take them deeper; he hears Steve moan his name and come apart above him.
He goes slow at first, to gauge how much Tony can take, yes, but also to look down, to fix his eyes on the point where his flesh makes contact with Tony’s, where his dick slides almost all the way out and then again in Tony’s hot mouth, to feel the head drag against Tony’s soft palate, Tony pushing his tongue up against Steve’s length while hollowing his cheeks and sucking, careful to cover his teeth with his lips.
“Again, please,” Steve chokes on the words, begging for something Tony has no intention of denying him, ever.
Steve looks at him—passed out, head hanging low on his chest in a heavy way, but visibly breathing. He’s been stripped of his armor, reactor nowhere to be seen. They took away his watch, his glasses, even his tie and his suit jacket. Everything. All his toys and anything else he could use to build something or call someone.
Steve reaches up and rests his hand between Tony’s shoulder blades. Tony moans softly, and doesn’t fight the touch, his torso slumping over under the weight of Steve’s hand.
It’s weird, to lie on a bed at night and not hear Tony’s even breathing, his steady heartbeat, the hum of the reactor in the background of everything. There’s no scent of coconut, no warmth. No white-blue light beyond Steve’s closed eyes.
“This is the one thing I can’t predict. I only have fail-safes in place in case something happens. But the scenarios, there are so many.”
Tony doesn’t know why he says what he says next. Whatever has been stopping him from saying things like this to Steve in the past few days, has disappeared.
“I thought... I thought I had to. Make him, make him okay. But I didn’t know... how. Where, where to start. I—”
He takes Tony’s hand in his own and holds it for a while. It’s so much smaller than Steve’s. Rougher, darker.
. Tony’s doing that thing with his voice, that thing with his smile and his eyes and his throat. He’s resting a hand in the crook of his thigh in a way that is studied to seem casual, but it’s meant to draw Steve’s attention to that part of his body, and Steve—
T'Challa’s nostrils flare for a moment, and it’s a deliberate warning. He has too much self-control for it to be anything else.
They head inside. Manuela puts the key to Tony’s guest house on the reception desk, and Tony takes it. He is reasonably sure he would take it from her hand, too.
, he thinks, while he feels like he’s breathing cold water that solidifies into ice inside his lungs, around his heart.
He could get up. He could go into the kitchen, drink some water, get the ice. Then sit on the couch, without putting weight on his shoulder. He could get some work done, catch up with his emails, reply to Pepper. He could take a walk. He could jack off. He could make Steve breakfast. Yeah.
Steve doesn’t know what Tony has been doing these past ten years. How often he would masturbate, or how. If he even felt the need all that often. But before, while they were together, Steve always loved watching Tony jack off on top of him, and he would ask him to do it often.
“This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard in my life. And I’ve been in Justin Hammer’s presence. Multiple times.”
Tony’s voice verges on frantic, in a way that is becoming unsettlingly familiar to Steve. It’s Tony’s fear of not doing enough, of not being able to help everyone who needs it, because
Steve frees his hand from under Tony’s thigh and catches Tony’s hand in his own, holds onto him, now, and for as long as Tony will let him. Slowly, Steve starts stroking Tony’s pubic hair, his balls, slides down to thumb in circles at his perineum, and when he feels like Tony is truly losing it, Steve pushes two fingers inside him, meeting no resistance at all, lube and his own come gushing out of Tony, coating Steve’s hand, making a mess of his sheets.
Steve bristles at the tone and answers with the most offended scowl he can muster, but he ultimately decides to let it go. He doesn’t want to fight.
The thing is, it’s just— he’s on an endorphin rush all the time. He’s not sure a sixty-year-old guy can handle all these orgasms. Not one with his heart issues, anyway.
Bucky turns to look at the floor, only mildly interested. “She’s in the shower,” he says, shrugging.
Steve opens a drawer in the dresser to take out a clean undershirt. He looks at Tony with an apology already written in his eyes: Tony will have to lift his arm; there’s no way around it.
As promised, Steve joins him a few minutes later. He’s wearing a dark sweater and jeans, and he has a book in his hand. He lies down next to Tony and reads for a while, but Tony can feel his quick, tentative glances.
Once in bed—Tony half-naked lying on top of the sheets, Steve with sweatpants and a henley under his blanket—Tony turns his head to look at Steve.
Tony glances at Steve and wonders if he should tell him, after all, but he really wants it to be a surprise. That’s different than keeping a secret. He hopes Steve will see it like that, at least.
Steve decides not to push it. Tony can decide what’s best for himself. Besides, he won’t swim if his shoulder hurts too much.
“One night, I got wasted. I was tired, I was thinking about everything that happened, about, about you, and... So I decided. To quit.”
“I can. It’s not that I can’t. It’s just not as easy. Or as fast. I kinda stay very tight. I felt so full while you were inside me, I couldn’t even…”
Tony scrunches up his nose. His eyes suddenly dilate, and surprise colors his expression. “Hey, you smell of… Wow, uh… Steve, is something wr—”
For his part, Tony isn’t relaxed either. He hasn’t stripped down and he hasn’t changed into a robe, even though he still feels too warm. He removes his tie and undoes a few buttons on his shirt, but nothing more.
He feels shitty, but he needs to do it. Once he knows this, then everything… everything will be different. Easier.
Dozens of small, shallow, little rivulets of water have carved their way on the white rocky hill over the course of the centuries. None of them are deeper or wider than a few inches. The little river beds are orange with limestone and they coalesce into a small waterfall down the hill. The sound of the rushing water is soothing, and it gives the place an otherworldly atmosphere.
He starts caressing Tony’s arm delicately when it’s almost time to go. Up and down, up and down again, from wrist to elbow. Tony stirs against Steve’s chest, a jolt goes through him, and he gives out a tired moan. He twists on the bed, stays on his back while he yawns, then turns towards Steve, burrows between his arms.
, or even apologize for not thinking about the effect that smelling the shirt up close could have on Steve. And it will kill Steve. He’d take anything, anything at all from Tony, even contempt, but not pity. Please, not pity.
Fuck. He’s not supposed to feel this bad. But it’s been ten years, and his bondmate doesn’t want him, not in this way at least. Steve doesn’t know exactly what that means; he and Tony have always been an exception to the rule. But he can easily guess where this will take him, and he doesn’t have a long road ahead of him.
He thinks about Tony’s smile, about that gravitational ache inside him that draws him to Tony’s orbit, inescapable like any law of physics. He thinks about how it felt to be inside him that night, to have him in his mouth. To have
The sun reflects on the water and makes it shine so brightly that Steve has to squint a bit, while Tony slides his sunglasses back on.
She starts recognizing his face and his voice pretty soon, and she interacts with him easily. She never cries when Tony leaves her alone with Steve for a couple of hours to get some work done in the workshop, check on a project, fix a piece of Avengers equipment.
“I’m sorry, sweetheart. I didn’t mean to wake you up,” Steve says, genuinely apologetic. Tony had an infernal day yesterday, and has another one scheduled for Monday. Meetings, meetings, and more meetings, for an important acquisition that would create tons of new jobs. Steve doesn’t understand the complexities of Tony’s business, but he does know that Tony was dead on his feet last night, restless, tense, and wasn’t in the mood for anything except taking a shower and going to bed. Which was fine, obviously. Tony needed to rest.
Stella looks at Steve seriously for a few moments. She swallows, and starts wiping down the counter. “Steve. Can I ask… what did you do to him?”
The sun catches in Tony’s hair, makes it shine, makes it look like silver, like white light. Like he’s made of stars.
“I know, I know. You know how I get when I’m thinking,” he pauses, grimaces, “I didn’t mean the stuff I said. The bad thoughts just poke their heads out when I’m tired.”
“No, it’s just a bunch of things. I think not drinking is what really makes me sleepy, right now. But being too warm all the time doesn’t help. Some of it is the reactor’s fault—can’t run any marathons. But the rest is... the chest pains, the dizziness, the weakness, the sweat, the nausea, the palpitations—”
Tony walks to the chair he used as a valet stand and slowly takes off the rest of his clothes, arranging them with care. When he is finally naked he turns to look at Steve, who’s looking at him with a raised eyebrow.
There are scratches on him, in the shape of the man’s fingernails. Some of them are infected; they’re red and swollen and warm to the touch. Tony picks at the scabs.
Steve forces himself to think about something else, because a cold shower doesn’t seem particularly appealing right now, and because he’s not sure he has the strength to bear the guilt of doing this again, of using images of Tony for his own pleasure without Tony’s consent or knowledge, because Tony is still angry with him and Steve feels sick at the thought of taking certain liberties. He probably wouldn’t, if their circumstances were different. But that doesn’t matter.
“People who didn’t even know her were there. And I wasn’t. Because I was too busy dealing with Ross and covering up your shit to go to Peggy’s funeral, or to even realize that it was happening at all!” He has to hold his left arm in place with the right one so it doesn’t shake too badly.
It’s Tony, or rather, a part of him. Of his body. From his stomach, all the way up to his mouth. It’s a close-up of all his scars, of the arc reactor, the upside-down rectangle inside the round glass case.
Tony’s nose is buried into the carpet and he’s struggling to breathe. He coughs, just once, and Steve lifts him up and moves him into a more comfortable position.
“I went to visit her grave, after. Wish I went to her funeral, though. I can’t... I didn’t go to her funeral. I didn’t go to Peggy Carter’s funeral. Fucking bullshit.”
Tony wakes up suddenly, a gasp on his lips. His breathing is ragged, he tries to get it under control but to no avail.
Instead he looks down, rubs his left arm with his right hand for a bit, then gets up and walks to the car.
The kiss is very slow at first, tentative, uncertain in a way they have never been when doing far less innocent things. Steve presses his lips to Tony’s, Tony’s scent fills his senses, makes him dizzy with desire, with happiness.
He’s in the cave. He’s at the bottom of the staircase. He can see an opening at the top of it, sunlight outside.
Jen brings him a bottle of water when he’s in the lab almost every night, and sometimes she sits at the next table with a case file Matt Murdock asked her to please look over because he’d really love to hear her opinion on it. Tony thinks it’s an excuse to keep an eye on him, but after a while, he’s not so sure anymore. Jen was recently in a coma too, after all (they could be coma buddies. Ha. Isn’t that funny?), so maybe she needs him to keep an eye on her, too, but didn’t know how to ask. Whatever the reason for her behavior, though, Tony cherishes her company.
He listens to Steve breathe, now quiet and slow, in the heat of summer, sitting in a room that feels like home.
It’s the fact that Steve doesn’t just want him because he loves him. Steve wants him because he wants
“Not even then. I talked about this with a therapist in Wakanda and she said... Bucky’s my friend, we’ve been friends since we were seven. He’s the last thing I got left from my past, Tony. I couldn’t risk losing him too, on top of everything else.”
He takes Steve’s hand, but after a few steps Tony only grabs Steve’s first two fingers instead of all of them. It’s happened before in the last few days, but Steve finds it suddenly strange. It’s not the first time he notices this, but has Tony always been this small compared to him? He tells himself again maybe it’s just that he’s not wearing lifts all the time, but how can his hands be affected by that?
“You know,” he says, “maybe your theory isn’t so far-fetched. Maybe there’s a reason we could never be just friends. Maybe there’s a reason you have to be on the other side of every argument.” He smiles, amused. “My rudder,” he says, seemingly solemn but actually joking, “steering me when others can’t…”
Steve is wearing way too little clothing to be able to hide the deep flush that makes him bright pink from nose to stomach.
Steve zips her coat up and takes a minute to hug her tight. She smells better; Tony must have already noticed too. He’s surprised the change is so rapid. He holds her for too long; he doesn’t want to let her go, but he has to. He blows a raspberry in her neck and makes her laugh and screech, and she says, “Now
“Sometimes. A bit. You get used to it. I’m glad for the light though. The first few months after they got the old one out, I would… It’s stupid, but I’d wake up at night and panic ‘cause I couldn’t see the light.”
“No… where?” Steve lowers himself to level his gaze with Tony’s, and suddenly his head is just above Tony’s shoulder.
Steve showers while Tony shuffles into the kitchen to check the oven. The turkey is in there. He texted Manuela earlier so she’d have someone bring it here already cooked. It needs to be warmed up though, so Tony turns the oven on.
“Alright,” Steve says, and moves. He removes his finger from Tony’s ass, lets Tony twist to lie on his back, and places his knees to the sides of Tony’s head.
“I love you too. That’s why—fuck, ahh, fuck—that’s why you need to do it. Because you love me and because I love you.”
He dreams of his body falling next to Tony’s, his own head a few feet away. Their blood mixing on the floor as an extreme, final act of love-making.
There’s a third one, but Tony catches himself before all the words can form in his mind. What he can’t stop, though, is feeling the way he feels, and the bout of self-hate that follows immediately after.
Then he gets up, walks to the dresser, and takes something from a drawer. He comes back with his hand open so he can show it to Tony.
But Steve just stays there, hugs him a little harder, and showers him with love and acceptance. Tony sends his own back to Steve, and he whimpers softly while the emotions shoot through him, familiar and different all at once.
“I don’t think so. But I think she was very alone. It does something to a person, Tony, that kind of loneliness. You start clinging to everything. Every scrap of memory becomes huge.”
Not that he has ever given this a lot of thought, or that any of it was particularly serious. It was like, whatever. Who knows. Maybe. Someday. Probably.
Steve moves on top of him, adjusting his grip. His dick is as hard as a rock, and Tony feels a weird tickle in his ass, a buzzing under his skin.
“And I saw the future, as you like to say. I calculated probabilities based on existing data, constructed scenarios, predicted risk and estimated damage.
Tony feels his chest give a jolt of pain that takes his breath away for a moment. He feels his left arm tremble, and tries to mask it by using it to massage the spot over his heart.
Tony thinks about Steve, his little joke about being arrested for the cherries, his sad but hopeful smile, his kind eyes, his offers to help. He thinks about what he, himself, wants from this. Spend time with Steve, see if together they can stumble back into some form of friendship that won’t end in tragedy again.
He has no idea about the state of his erections because he can’t get hard. Not here, not like this. Not with him.
One of his last coherent thoughts is that he’s pissed off—or glad?— that Tony just showered. That he stripped away all the things that make him, him. That make him Steve’s. Like this, Steve can’t find Tony’s scent in the air. Tony scrubbed himself clean. There’s no slick dripping out of him, opening his body up, smoothing the way in for Steve. There’s no—
But his erections are good. They’re great. They’re firmer, longer, he reaches his orgasm way more easily than before, when he basically had to beg the guy to stay up long enough to get to the end. His refractory period is still, like, six hours, but he didn’t expect that to change. The cock cage has been a great help. It still makes him feel so
Tony stops walking abruptly and turns to look at Steve, his mouth open as if he’d been about to say something else. Steve’s eyes go wide, and his words from last night now resonate inside him, a silent reminder that works more as cruel mockery.
“I am. I really am, I... thank you, for this.” Tony’s hand is resting on the table, and Steve covers it with his own.
Tony’s birthday feels like a new beginning in so many ways. Steve is back from his worst nightmare, Tony is back from his coma. They’re rebuilding the team.
Tony swallows, nods. “Remind me to take a pic of that later, and send it to T'Challa,” he says, pointing at the page with his equations.
“Like finding your way back home,” he says in the end, simply, as though giving an obvious reply to a rhetorical question. He doesn’t comment on the words Tony used to describe that night,
It’s just… it’s just words, Tony knows. Steve doesn’t mean them. He knows Tony can’t have another child.
His Omega instinct kicks in, stronger than any sense of betrayal. And the bite on his shoulder never fades.
Tony nods again. “I think it’s going to rain tonight,” he says, looking at the dark clouds pinned on the horizon, far away above the valley.
He rummages into his duffle to retrieve his grooming kit, and goes into the bathroom with Tony. The case is bulging with the shape of the soap he bought months ago, the box left unopened because he stopped shaving altogether. He opens it, puts the soap in its metal cup.
“Oh, Tony…” It’s only a whisper, but Steve sounds like he’s trying to stifle a sob, joy and relief so overwhelming that they gush out of him like this.
Tony sighs, and thinks of something to say in response, but the seconds stretch between them until the silence becomes too long. “Let’s go clean up,” he says instead.
“She said… ugh. Half this stuff, I had entirely forgotten,” Stella says, taking the pages from the pocket of her dress. She pushes her glasses back on her nose, skims over Mom’s compact and tiny handwriting.
He tries to get up but his legs are shaking and he can’t move them inside the suit. There’s blood that’s not his splattered across his face, seeping into his eyes and the undersuit; he closes his mouth and tries to breathe with his nose but he gags from the smell.
Their first date. Steve had been so nervous that night, the secret he was keeping from Tony scratching at the back of his mind like nails on a chalkboard. And Tony, instead, so happy that Steve had said yes when he had asked him out, his eyes so big and his smile so warm.
Steve makes him stop. He pushes his hands down on Tony’s shoulders so their hips are locked together and his knot is slotted in its proper place inside Tony.
“You wanna suck me off first? You like that, don’t you? Do it. I missed your mouth…” Tony brushes his thumb over Steve’s mouth, hooks it on his bottom lip. “Your mouth…”
Now there are little gestures too. Steve goes with Tony to one of the Maria Stark Foundation galas, because Diya from PR thinks Captain America’s presence can affect how much money rich people feel like donating to charity (she is right). The next day Steve finds a new uniform in his room, the one that yesterday was still weeks away from being ready, made of a new fabric Tony developed, more breathable but still bulletproof. A week later, during breakfast, Steve mentions that he’s out of some art supplies, but the mission S.H.I.E.L.D. assigned him to prevents him from doing anything about it at the moment. When he comes back, everything he was planning on buying is already on his desk with a note that only says
When Tony comes out of the bathroom he stops abruptly, takes Steve in: his sweatpants, his henley, his socks, the blanket. Tony looks like he’s about to say something, but he hesitates and looks away.
With his heart still in his throat, Tony notices that he’s hard. The tip of his cock, fat and wet, tents the waistband of his underwear away from his belly. There’s a dark spot on the silk.
“M—more,” Tony whispers, and Steve doesn’t know what to do except reach down with his hand and slide his forefinger into him right next to his own cock.
Tony’s smirk, almost devilish in its unadulterated sensuality. Tony’s hands, his rough fingers flying over the keyboard, fast, so fast Steve’s eyes almost couldn’t keep up. A glass of whiskey next to the screen, almost empty.
“I’m awake!” Steve says all of a sudden in the middle of the night, sitting bolt upright and waking Tony up.
She brings a hand up to cover her mouth, and sobs, unashamed of her grief, as if she were alone in the room.
Tony is standing, talking to a very tall man dressed in a suit despite the heat, with short gray hair and very thick eyebrows. Tony touches his shoulder, smiles, laughs—bares his teeth, his throat. The man rests a hand on Tony’s arm to draw him close, and they hug, friendly and warm, for longer than Steve expects. The man hunches down, slides his hand down to the small of Tony’s back; Tony goes on his tiptoes, strokes the man’s shoulder blades. Steve watches Tony close his eyes, his chin nestled into the crook of the man’s neck.
He’s here for this. He’s dreamed about this. It’s the only thing this monster deserves, it’s the only thing that will make him breathe again.
Tony slumps over, and Steve’s body is there, ready to catch him. Steve’s arms appear around Tony, holding him up. One hand caresses the nape of Tony’s neck.
“How did he,” he begins to say, but his voice trips over the sentence. His mouth is dry. “They shot him. Osborn’s men, they shot him. How did he—”
Breakfast makes Tony slip into a better mood. There’s an unexpectedly high degree of experience in his movements. Tony cuts pie and unscrews the moka pot like he solders pieces of armor together, like he writes code: sure of himself, precisely and perfectly, seemingly effortlessly.
Most nights, Tony has trouble falling asleep. When he does, he has nightmares and he wakes up drenched in sweat, and he needs to wash his face and change his t-shirt, but first of all he needs to wait for his hands to stop shaking.
Steve is fucking him so deep, it would hurt if Tony didn’t need it so bad, if he didn’t need more. Each thrust is so hard that Tony feels it in his guts, in his stomach, and yet it’s barely enough.
“This was your mother’s favorite place, Tony. We’d come here during the day, with the excuse that it was less warm than in the house, and we’d… well…”
Maybe they can heal, as Doctor Ndaba suggested. With enough time to talk things out, to explain, with the peace of mind to understand. To forgive.
“You keep something in the drawer of your bedside table, under all my drawings. I don’t know what it is, but it’s in an envelope, so I’m guessing it’s a letter. It’s blue, but it smells like dust, so it’s old. I’ve seen you put it back in the drawer as soon as I came into the room a couple of times.”
“I—” Steve focuses. He closes his eyes, lets his hearing expand beyond walls, staircases, storage rooms. “In the woods. I can hear… deer. Owls. I can smell the undergrowth. Sea’s far away.”
“I don’t know if you could ever forgive me. I don’t know if I would, if I were you. You’re stronger than me, though.”
a million times could erase all the small and big acts of violence Steve has committed (and still commits, and will commit) against him.
He lets Tony manhandle him into position (he would let Tony do anything to him, really, holy shit) and he finds himself facing the wall with his hands splayed on the white tiles, his elbows and knees locked, his legs spread apart. Tony slips under his arm, kneels down between his thighs and then Steve’s brain short-circuits again because goddammit, Tony’s
“Sorry,” Tony slurs, and lets go of the tension; Steve can feel it with his fingers. He resumes moving them inside Tony, and reaches up to kiss him, distracting him a bit, splitting his focus on something else, but Tony is great at multitasking, and he kisses Steve like his life depends on it—just how Steve likes it.
Steve is staring at him, eyes wide, lips open, holding a breath in his chest. “Tony, I— you look— you are perfect.”
Every night, after eating his dinner, the man comes inside Tony and leaves. Tony lies on the bed for a bit, shivering, then gets up and feels the man’s orgasm trickle out of him. He runs to the toilet and throws up, or at least coughs and retches his disgust into the metal bowl. Then, he washes himself with water marked as non-potable and tries not to look at the man’s come mixing up with his own blood on the skin of his inner thighs.
They step outside, walk into the orchard. The day is sunny and hot, but the ground beneath their feet is still wet and muddy in places, where the trees are too thick for the sunshine to reach.
Steve watches as he sits heavily on the bed, takes off his t-shirt and undershirt and throws them on the floor. He unclasps his mother’s necklace and places it in the bedside drawer. He kicks his shoes off.
, once, twice… seven times, and Steve really wishes his Captain America brain would just shut up for a minute, he doesn’t need to write a report about
When Maria was sixteen years old, her father decided to expand his successful business to New York, one of the most influential cities in the world with regard to fashion. His family would move there with him.
“You’ve been taking care of me for a long time. The least I can do is take care of you when you need it. Especially after—”
Howard has been very nervous lately, his work for the Pentagon is hard on his patience. Not that he's ever had much of it.
Steve sags forward against Tony. Tony’s there, sitting between Steve’s legs. He holds Steve close while Steve cries and mumbles “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” over and over again into Tony’s neck, as if that could change anything.
They sit on the little stone wall that delimits the tank, and while Steve works on his sketches, Tony taps at his phone, probably getting some work done.
He rests his hands up against the wall, pushes against it, lowering his head. The water sloshes over his shoulders, and he starts shivering.
“Alright,” he says in the end, softly, and Steve has never wanted to kiss him more than right now, here, in the middle of the most crowded street in Florence, while the sun shines inclement above them and makes Tony sweat.
“Because I’d trust him with my life, and more. And because he’s allowed on Wakandan soil. He brought the arm there, he’ll provide technical help—he
Mentoring Peter, scolding him when he fucks up, talking with him about responsibility and powers and boys (because Peter talks a lot about boys, and something makes him think asking Tony for advice about boys is a good idea), that, is one thing.
A minute later, Tony steps under the spray of the shower, letting the hot water soothe his muscles and wash away the unpleasant sweat still clinging to him. He always hates the feeling of the skin sticking together at the back of his knees, in the inside of his elbows. The cleaner he is, the calmer he becomes, until he feels a strange warmth curling low in his belly, a pull at the base of his spine.
It’s Tony, of course. He’s naked, but the drawing stops right below the jut of his hips, barely shows the initial tuft of his pubic hair. There’s a serious and resolute expression on his face, a tear on his cheek. His hair is long, but combed back, and his goatee is precisely trimmed. Tony holds his own heart in his hand, blood trickling down his forearm and dripping to the ground. His fingers dig into the heart with the effort of offering it up to someone outside the picture. In his chest, there’s a hole. It’s round, and dark with the shadows he hides inside himself. There’s a hole. It’s empty, because he has nothing left to fill it with.
Except Tony has no idea what he’s gotten himself into, because with very minimal warning Steve shoves two fingers inside him. Tony hisses, arches his back, grabs at his pillow, swears under his breath.
“Super good! I like it if we sleep all together. I mean, I also wanna sleep in my room. I like my room. But I like it if we sleep together. Sometimes. Can we do that?”
The admission feels awfully big for some reason. It makes no sense. Tony already knew this. He was there for all of it, the other half of this huge mess that is their relationship.
“Well, for your information, I am more than comfortable with being touched by people who never beat me half to death!”
The body falls on top of Tony, and he pushes it away. He kneels on the floor, heavy and ungraceful, his lungs burning in his chest.
Tony tapes the gauze to Steve’s skin. His eyes are so bright like this, just after he has cried, but Tony likes them better when they’re dry. Tony resists the urge to comb his fingers through Steve’s hair, caress his cheek.
It’s stupid, he tells himself a minute later. He wouldn’t be able to call Steve anyway from up here. He wouldn’t be able to call anyone. Even Pepper’s voice started breaking up and then disappeared as soon as they got far enough from Earth.
But Tony doesn’t say anything. He just looks at Steve, eyes a little wide, lips apart in mild surprise.
He hates the way his voice sounds, he hates how many turns of phrase he has to use to put the whole thing in the mildest tones he can think of; he hates that he can’t look at Steve right now or do anything to soothe him.
Tony reaches for his hand, and Steve grabs it, twining their fingers together while he says, “I’m sorry I… I didn’t—”
Tony nods. “You can think and say whatever you want. I just ask that we don’t turn it into a fight. I told you, I don’t handle conflict well since…” Tony presses his lips together. “We can talk about anything. Just, please—don’t get angry and don’t make me angry.”
Tony Stark knows very well that when you have as many ideas as he does all the time, not all of them can be winners.
So yeah, Steve feels like shit. Steve feels like shit in the deserted gym and the attached showers multiple times, he feels like shit on his couch and on Tony’s couch, in Tony’s penthouse against the glass wall (
And he slumps over and cries into the crook of Steve’s neck, his eyes squeezed shut in an effort not to black out because of how absolutely
Steve’s worried about him. Which means Steve will do anything in his power to make Tony’s life easier—he’ll take upon himself every task, smooth over any hardship, anticipate all of Tony’s needs.
Tony nods, but he doesn’t know if it’s because he believes what Stella said, or because the rocking motion is the only small comfort he can find in this moment.
“I love you too. I never stopped. I needed not to forgive you right away. I needed to see if I could hold the point. And I could, but… it was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. And I withstood actual torture at some point.”
Tony speeds up, but his dick is still soft and slaps against him in a way that looks painful and unpleasant and sort of ridiculous; he tries to cup himself to keep it in place, but it makes him lose balance.
Steve touches him with a hard caress, his fingers pressing into Tony’s skin, the place where his right nipple used to be, his collarbone, his neck. Steve’s hand settles on Tony’s throat with the thumb on one side and the rest of his fingers on the other, and Tony disturbingly wonders how much more pressure Steve would need to apply to squeeze the life out of him, to break his neck and finish him. He knows the physics of it, but would it even register for Steve?
The house is not big, but it is spacious and full of light, thanks to the big windows Tony had wanted. The glass blocks the view from the outside. The thick walls and the cotto tiles on the floor keep the temperature down, an ancient equilibrium Tony was careful not to disrupt in his renovations.
“You can’t sleep either?” Steve asks, and that’s when his stomach grumbles again. Tony looks at it. Steve looks down at it, betrayed.
The bone cracks back into the shoulder socket easily, and the pain cuts off Tony’s air for a moment. He moans, fisting his other hand, gritting his teeth.
Tony walks away from Steve, activates the energy field that muffles his voice, so a certain super soldier can’t eavesdrop.
One afternoon, Tony comes back from the workshop to find Steve asleep on the couch. Maria is next to him, also asleep, held in place by Steve’s arm around her. He’s still clutching the crochet whale, his nose in Maria’s hair.
How small your world becomes, when you feel so utterly alone. It reduces itself to the littlest things.
“I was still angry. Bitter. I clinged to those feelings as hard as I could, because they were the only things that helped me. Helped me hold back. I needed to hold back.
Steve surges up, circles Tony’s back with his arm and with a quick thrust of his hips he has Tony pinned beneath him, his back on the bed, and he fucks into him like he did that first time, fast and short and shallow, so he hits Tony’s prostate every time.
“What I’m trying to say is that maybe in his heart Tony has already forgiven you. But he doesn’t want it to be something that just happens to him. He wants to choose it. Maybe he’s just waiting to see if his brain can catch up or not. If he can look at you again without thinking about the betrayal first.”
“I’ve lost my strength,” he manages to say. Reinforcing the room isn’t necessary; he can’t even get up.
“Tony, I wanted to show you something,” Stella says when Tony sits back on the chair, fishing Mom’s letter out of the pocket of her dress. “Here, read this part,” she adds, pointing to a paragraph towards the end of a page she’s passed him over the table. Tony reads it.
“And I need you to check up on Stella. Regularly. Take my plane, anything. Come visit her often, Steve; don’t leave her alone.”
He may not be entirely new to his consent not being respected. And he may not like himself; he may not think of himself as worthy of some friendships, of the esteem of his colleagues, of Steve’s regard. Of that love that was just blossoming between him and Steve before Tony fucked it all up with betrayal. Tony may despise himself, but he’s pretty sure that whatever he did, he didn’t deserve
Well, maybe not strangers. They saw each other once in a while. Reluctantly, and they didn’t speak to each other if it could be avoided, but still.
It suddenly feels stupid, this thing in his hand. This little heap of perfectly arranged bits of metal and plastic, this silly tiny object that is the only thing that separates him from Tony. It’s also the only thing that would allow him to reach Tony, and the sick irony of the situation isn’t lost on him.
“You want to hold her?” he asks, and Steve nods. The way he does it, though, is as if someone is pointing a gun to his head and telling him to nod. Like he knows he shouldn’t want this.
“But I do think you’re brave. I think you’re tough, and resilient, and you’re a formidable enemy to have, Tony. You’re invincible. But you’re also an amazing friend, kind, compassionate, and the most generous person I know. You own up to your mistakes, try to make them right. And as I said this morning, I’m proud of you.”
The last time, Tony is on his back, and Steve comes all over his lap. Steve looks at him for a minute, bewitched, it seems like he can’t quite process what’s before his eyes. Tony feels used up, but in a peculiar way, in a way that makes him feel— young.
Tony blinks, swallows, taking advantage of the fact that Steve isn’t looking at him to let his excitement play freely on his face.
He feels Steve lift him up by the hips and manhandle him; he feels his legs being spread open around Steve’s hips, Steve’s hands fumbling between them, and then—
He forces himself to calm down in order to assess his own situation, but he’s not faring better than Tony. He has no cowl and no belt. No shield either, obviously. They took the top of the suit Tony made him last month, and he’s been left in his undershirt. His wrists are bound too, chained up on the wall in the same way Tony’s are, but the cuffs are different. It’s something large and bulky, covering his hands and part of his fingers, too. Reinforced with vibranium, and… something else.
And that’s the exact moment that Wade calls him, and of course he’s going to help Wade with his case and hopefully keep him from getting into the mess of the century.
He shakes his head, as much as the position allows him, and turns to hide his face into Tony’s belly, against the excess of fat there. Tony’s ashamed of it, so he tries to suck it in, make his abdomen seem toned, pretend he sometimes remembered to work out during those months he spent holed up in the workshop trying to fit his armor into two strips of metal.
“Are you alright?” she asks, and Tony nods, even though they both know it’s not true. “I want to show you a place. It’s close,” she says, and starts walking to the side of the house, down the hill, into the woods.
“Was it really you who sent Mom the tapes? We used to listen to them together, and play the songs in turn.”
He has witnessed all the small changes Tony’s body has gone through the years. His muscles have lost some definition despite all the exercise, his skin has lost elasticity and gained wrinkles, his joints make him hiss in pain from time to time. Over the years, his hair became salt and pepper at first, and then a compact and shiny gray. His goatee is sprinkled with white too, except for the mustache. He has resigned himself to his recent need for reading glasses.
Steve slumps over above Tony, falls on him gracelessly, forcing Tony’s hips back on the floor. He covers Tony’s body with his own, resting an elbow on the side of Tony’s head. Tony feels him do something with his other hand, touch the place between them where they become one thing, slip a couple of fingers into Tony and rub against his dick, stretching Tony out, reaching past the knot and then deep inside him.
It’s sugar, Tony’s voice. A caress, a dream. A night, months ago, except back then Tony never called Steve by his name.
At first, he can’t see anything, all is dark around him. He smells dirt and ice. Metal. Rotting flesh, above all.
At this point, Steve has been staring at the screen of his tablet for a good twenty minutes. He doesn’t know exactly what to make of all this new information, but he’s confused, and upset, and there are just too many things going through his mind.
It’s made with a black marker pen. It’s New York, the dark portal gaping wide over it. Tony—well, Iron Man—is a small figure, flying in a straight line into that terrible hole, holding the nuke over his back. The drawing catches Tony just a moment away from entering that upside-down abyss.
“No,” Tony’s face crumbles, and dammit, Steve keeps fucking this up, “I mean, yeah, we are friends, but I didn’t mean to say that I love you as a friend.”
He’s tired all of a sudden, but he knows it’s the bond—it’s how Steve feels. He tries to send reassurance back, but nothing changes. His mind is clouded with Steve’s distress.
Two years later, in 1955, Antonio opened his atelier in Manhattan. Before putting up the sign on the entrance door, though, he changed the family name to Carbonell, which proved to be a wise marketing move.
“Oh no, Tony, of course she didn’t regret having you! You were everything to her, everything! But your father was… he wasn’t good to you. And he wasn’t good to her.”
Steve clothes were in Tony’s closet. The book Steve was reading was on the other bedside table, the one Tony didn’t use. Sometimes, Tony would come back from the workshop late at night to find that Steve had left his sketchbook and pencils on the kitchen counter and had gone to bed.
“It’s just… I’m gonna say it the way it is because there’s no other... I think your dick was bigger the last time I sucked it,” he says, very fast. “Which is just weird, right? It’s, it’s impossible, it makes no sense. Right?”
He sits on the edge of the bed, looks out of the window for a moment. He reaches down to pick up a t-shirt from the floor, cleans himself up with it. He looks at himself, and he indulges in a minute of defeated commiseration—he even thinks,
Leaving the guest house is surprisingly difficult. He’s always felt attached to it, but now more than ever. It’s become home to him and Steve, in many ways. Maybe it even helped them heal together, offering them a place to return to every night.
Steve bites his bottom lip. He drops the t-shirt back in the drawer. “No. Looks like I don’t. Sorry, you’ll have to make do with my stuff,” he says, putting a different t-shirt—one of Steve’s own—next to Tony with a clean pair of underwear.
He smells like himself, but like a fruit gone bad smells like itself. The familiar scent is covered up by something painful, sickening, rotten.
Steve takes a deep breath, steps out of the car as slowly as possible. Tony looks at him for the first time.
Steve comes at some point, but he almost doesn’t even notice. He stays hard as a rock, doesn’t want to catch his breath—he doesn’t need to. He only needs Tony.
Plenty of places are older than Steve. Plenty of places are far older than this church. The ancient ruins in Rome, the pyramids in Egypt, Knossos in Greece. The Ziggurat of Ur in Iraq, Cuicuilco in Mexico. Qin Shi Huang’s mausoleum in China. But Steve has never been to any of those places. Steve is here, now.
different. Erogenous zones and all that. And yes, Tony looks blissed out whenever Steve fucks into his mouth, but he’s pretty sure coming inside Steve made him feel a whole lot of new different things, from a purely sensual point of view.
“I…” he says, but can’t continue for a moment. “I feel like… myself,” he finishes. Steve is about to ask for clarification, but Tony speaks again. “I’m me. Whole,” he says, and Steve understands.
. It’s not the original copy from his childhood; it was destroyed in one of the many attacks to Avengers Mansion. But he bought another. It’s old and beautiful, and he paid a lot of money for it. It has a red leather cover, and the title written in gold letters. Just the way you’d imagine a book about knights would look.
“I don’t know, Tony. I just hope you will allow me the chance to earn your friendship back. That one day you’ll look at me and see past what I kept from you, what I did to you. But to answer your question, I only know how I feel. And I know that I’m not half as good at... at anything as I am when I’m doing it next to you.”
Steve gets up, walks closer to Tony making some noise so Tony doesn’t get startled. He musters up his gentlest voice.
Tony gets back into the car. Steve must have moved in the meantime, since he’s clutching a sketchbook with a brown leather cover and a ballpoint pen in his hand. He’s holding them like they’re the only things keeping him anchored here, keeping him from shattering into pieces.
Tony wakes up with some difficulty, but he smiles at Steve before going to the bathroom. When he comes back he looks less sleepy, and his hair is damp—he must have washed his face.
He rinses his hands, places a towel on his shoulder, grabs the razor. He waits a second for his muscle memory to kick in, to remember how it’s best for him to hold the blade. He likes how it feels in his hand. Its weight is the same as it has ever been.
He clutches at his heart, feels his mother’s necklace under his fingers, trapped between his skin and the technical fabric of his undershirt. He feels all the ridges of the little sun-shaped pendant, remembers how it looked against the fair skin of her neck.
He’s always had long ruts. The average is three days, but his are longer—five days, sometimes even a week.
Silence falls between them. Steve shifts on the couch, reaches to the coffee table to take one of Maria’s toys. He presses a button on it, and it makes a cat’s call. He presses another, and it’s the cow’s.
Tony can’t say what he’s feeling. There’s pain, sure, but it also feels good, Steve touching him like this, so kind and careful. Loving.
Steve sighs, pushes his hair back with one hand, then lets his arm fall heavily to his side, defeated. “I don’t know, Tony.”
Tony shifts on the bed, closer to Steve; he twists around so he’s stomach down on the mattress and pushes himself up on his hands, near Steve’s shoulder. He stares down at Steve, who seems to have his head glued to the pillow. Steve stares back, eyes wide. He parts his lips.
“I don’t mean like a couple. Not necessarily,” Steve says, and he tries again to talk as quietly as he can. “If we were friends, if we cared about each other and respected each other, we could discuss things and even disagree without ending up in a fight. And when I say fight, I mean strictly verbal. Other kinds are off the table on principle.”
It’s like that morning in the tub, but better, because now Steve’s touch doesn’t have that grain of uncertainty to it anymore. Now it’s only love, it’s only hope.
And it’s good, to have settled things with her. Steve basically disappeared, it’s only natural that she moved on.
. Steve can’t even look at him. “I can’t stop thinking about you,” he whispers, staring at the floor.
He shifts, and Tony turns around on his chair, letting his cheek rest over Steve’s stomach. Steve cups the back of his head, trailing his long fingers into Tony’s hair.
“I like everything about you,” Steve replies, and he sits up to wrap his arms around Tony, brush his cheek against his chest. He licks Tony’s scars there, then moves slowly towards a nipple—he nips at it and Tony shudders and Steve doesn’t think about the picture of Tony pregnant and covered in bruises.
Steve doesn’t say anything. He stares at Tony for a little while, then looks at Maria, down on the changing table. She squeezes his finger with both hands.
“Yeah?” Steve says, averting his eyes and trying to sound casual, rearranging his sweaters in his duffle bag for the third time and why did he even bring so many sweaters for two days? Fuck.
Stella searches for a while, and then extracts a specific picture from the bundle she’s holding in her thin hand. She places it on the table in front of Tony, taps on it with her finger a couple of times.
So, all in all, Tony is more than a little surprised when Steve comes to the penthouse that night, drags him to the couch in front of the fireplace, and starts kissing him as if the planet was being invaded by aliens (
There’s a huge bookcase at the back of the room, and a piano next to it. Tony’s eyes linger on it, then he lowers his head back to the cat, who touches her nose to his.
When Sarah is six, Tony decides that it’s time for her to have her own room in the compound. Steve agrees.
Outside, Tony leans against the wall of the chapel and looks into the distance, cursing the inescapable heat and the storm inside his mind.
Steve likes to think of himself as a brave man. Not always, maybe; he can’t be at the top of his game all the time, but in general, and despite recent mistakes, he likes to think of himself as someone who faces problems, instead of avoiding them.
Steve eats a lot. Except during missions, because the serum kicks his metabolism into a weird survival mode that grants him enough energy from regular rations. Steve’s always been grateful for it: he doesn’t have to fight while hungry, and during the war he didn’t have to feel guilty about getting more food than the Commandos.
It feels nice, her weight in his arms. What has he been doing with his arms all this time? What’s even the point of having arms if you’re not holding a baby, a tiny baby that’s all yours, now that you’ve signed the paperwork?
“Yesterday, in Siena, when we were walking back to the car. When you weren’t, uh… feeling well. You said that. You asked me to take you home.”
Tony doesn’t say it, but he might as well have, for the face Steve makes. He feels nausea rising to his throat.
It’s tiring work. It requires a painstaking level of attention that Tony, admittedly, doesn’t always have the patience for. He wants to do it, but it always leaves him feeling exposed and nervous, a human live wire ready to crackle and snap at the first occasion. Steve is irritated but eager; he keeps his cool better than Tony and helps him focus on the ultimate goal of this effort when Tony feels like giving up.
Tony doesn’t reply. He tries to stifle a pained moan, and he’s not all that successful. Steve sighs and finally looks at Tony again. He sounds defeated when he says, “Okay. I’m sorry. You want to keep it to yourself—fine.”
They’ve done it for years. It’s all they’ve ever done. On and off, on and off. Off and on again. Off every time the world was ending and they were at opposites sides of it. On every time they started a new team with renewed hope that this time,
He inhales deeply when he enters the car. It already smells like Tony. Soap, metal. Coconut. Sweat, too, but faint.
“It’s not your fault. You know, she used to... she used to tell me stories about you. The time Dad flew you two to that HYDRA base to save Barnes. And then the Commandos… so many stories. She always had one. She always called you
“That’s the opposite of the truth. If anything, you become less and less like him,” Steve says, and when Tony scoffs, he raises his voice from the whisper it’s been so far. “You forget that I knew him. And I know you. And you’re nothing—listen to me—” he takes Tony’s shoulders between his hands and looks at him as if to drive the idea into Tony’s beautiful mind by the naked force of his stare. “You’re
. He pants, closes his eyes as he’s flooded with relief. He sits up and looks around the room to ground himself in reality, but it takes a few minutes, his mind fights against it.
changed him. And Tony never even tried to fight. He didn’t give up after a while, he didn’t attempt to rebel in the beginning and then abandoned the idea when he saw how impossible it was to free himself. He simply never tried.
“Telling you my exact volume before and after would be pointless I suppose, but I lost three inches in height and the rest of my body adjusted consequently.”
Steve drops to his knees, looks up at Tony with something that can only be described as adoration, and asks, “Can I suck you off? I need the practice, right?” and there’s no way in hell Tony could ever say no to a question like that. So he nods, instead, and Steve swallows him slowly, making sure that every inch of the way is appropriately wet.
He opens his eyes and sees Tony riding up against his barely-there knot the last few times, until slipping past the swell becomes too painful and he has to stop. His breathing is harsh and shallow, his dick hard and neglected.
Tony straightens his shoulders, lets his arms fall to his sides, self-conscious about them even more than usual now. He squints at Steve, a gesture meant to convey inquiry and impatience in equal amounts. If this is some type of messed-up courting then Steve can save it.
It’s an awful moment, the one that comes next. The possibilities are split in two even halves, which isn’t as common as people might think. Either Steve lets Tony touch him, or he jerks his arm away.
Tony takes a moment to grasp what Steve is truly asking because he can hardly believe that anyone would show him so much regard—no one ever has, really. Alphas
Steve inside him feels insanely good, slotted in with a single thrust, Tony perfectly open and wet for him, as if they were made for each other. It’s such a stupid thought that Tony twitches to dispel the embarrassment it causes him, then clenches around Steve to encourage him to move. But Steve, instead, Steve keeps stills for a long minute after bottoming out, eyes closed and mouth agape. A deep shudder runs through him, and he opens his eyes, looking at Tony now with incredible softness, the eyes of someone who just woke up after a long rest. “I’ve been dreaming of this since I first met you,” he whispers, his voice as deep as it can be, and Tony feels it at the bottom of his spine. “You’d make me so mad sometimes, but I couldn’t help but like you. I’m powerless before you, Tony, hopeless. I look at you and I come undone.”
He gets up carefully, and it’s a miracle he doesn’t wake Steve up with how hard he’s breathing. In the bathroom, the pain eases up again, and stabilizes on something manageable. Lying down for too long? Not good.
Without saying anything, Tony retrieves his pillow from the living room. He walks around the bed, places the pillow on the empty spot. “I’m sorry about before. I was… I don’t know. I’m sorry.” The more he talks, the more his voice becomes small. “I thought you wanted that. But you don’t. Clearly. Which is fine. My bad.”
Around midnight, Tony would yawn, and Steve would take it as the sign that it is. They discard tablets and reading glasses and books and pencils and start kissing. Slowly at first, tentatively, because this is still new in some ways. They take off their clothes, though sometimes only what’s necessary to get things done because Tony gets chilly and wants to keep his sweater on.
“All set up. He’ll start the first session when he’s ready. There’s an entire team of trauma experts ready to follow him step by step.”
Those are the first words he’s heard Tony say the whole day, and they aren’t for Steve, and Steve can’t even understand them.
He wants to run away, he wants to... he wants to stop existing for a few minutes, just a few minutes, until he can breathe again.
“Yeah, but you should—” Tony begins to say while his eyes still have to adjust to the brightness of the room, but he doesn’t finish his sentence when he realizes that Steve got ready while Tony was still asleep.
Steve’s mother-henning is annoying, but only to an extent. It makes him feel protected, more than anything. Safe. Held, like when Steve puts his hand around Tony’s throat and keeps him there.
Tony lifts his head to look at the TV. “Oh, Jesus Christ,” he snaps, surprised and annoyed, while an old, short, sharp-dressed man speaks. He doesn’t have a lot of hair on his head, and the little he has, he dyes. His face is a mask of makeup; his skin tone looks fake, all kinds of wrong. All of him looks fake.
Tony’s eyes sting because the truth of it is that this feels incredible, and he’ll have to do without it from now on.
It takes just this simple word for Steve to pick up the broken pieces of his pride. As bad as he is, he still helped make Sarah, who is the best, most perfect thing in the world. Something Tony and him made together. She’s
Maybe someday, yeah. It seems impossible now, but he knows that maybe one day he’ll be able to touch himself again and enjoy it, even. Being touched by someone else, though… Steve can’t even think about that. At all. It feels beyond wrong. The mere idea makes him want to throw up, so he avoids it. When those thoughts cross his mind Steve closes his eyes and touches his wedding ring and thinks about how beautiful Tony was the day they got married.
“Guess you could get on all fours. Or you could get on top of me. You’d have more control that way, if you’re the one moving.”
He holds his dick at the base, just above the place where the knot forms. It hurts so fucking much he can’t even breathe. He pushes back into the toy—at least he’ll get some pressure around it, he figures—but it feels so bad. It’s disgusting. His come is lukewarm inside the channel, the silicone is so fake. There’s no warmth, and it only smells like plastic.
“I didn’t drink any of it,” Tony says while he pours the scotch into the sink of Stella’s kitchen. He throws the bottle in the garbage.
He feels sticky. He feels overheated and raw, his skin scratched and caressed all over by Steve’s voice, ever so terrifying and gentle, ever so careful not to sound threatening or forceful, not to transform instructions into orders, but too often skirting just barely away from that threshold, the unmated Alpha in him always roaring softly, and gritting his teeth under the surface of Steve’s well-measured and pleasant exterior personality. It’s a calm and reassuring sound, a storm rumbling at the edges of Tony’s horizon, and it leads him to a place where he feels safe and alert, where he can let everything else fall away and just be one with his movements, with his body, his sweat, his skin, and Steve’s voice at the root of it all, Tony’s loneliness stripping it of all its kinder masks to leave only the nude orders, the Alpha orders he so craves underneath the pretense and the armors,
The cherries are so red that they almost look black in the dim light of the orchard. They look like a wound against the white of Steve’s skin. Like blood splattered on the snow.
Steve reaches out with his hand, circles Sarah’s waist to tickle her belly. She turns to laugh with him, and it’s the best sound in the world. He kisses her cheek.
It’s been a year, and he should start moving on, or at least make his peace with what happened. Accept it. There’s a revolution to fight for; they have to take back their country, and Steve needs to be at his best for that.
Steve sits next to him on the couch, quietly, allows himself the small pleasure of watching Tony exist. He looks tiny, all huddled up like this. His mouth is slightly open. His feet are naked, and Steve almost can’t resist the urge to touch them. He rubs his fingers together to keep the need at bay.
I’m still tall and I still have muscles. I train, so I haven’t lost them, and they feed us enough because people want a spectacle to watch, but I don’t have any of my superhuman abilities anymore. No super strength, no enhanced senses, no super speed. No special reflexes, no incredible stamina or durability or agility. No super healing. I’m just a man. Nothing special about me.
As if that is something Steve is going to do no matter what, whether Tony forgives him or not. As long as they’re both taking care of the alien threat, they’ll have to see each other, have a relationship, however distant. And Steve just said,
Steve reaches a blank page and starts drawing some lines, with not much thought behind them. Someone knocks softly at his door. He closes the sketchbook and puts it under a pillow, goes to see who it is.
Steve was supposed to leave an hour ago, before dinner. But then Maria needed to be changed while Tony was stuck in the longest phone call with the biggest asshole in the board of directors.
In some way, it’s like Tony keeps testing himself, seeing what he can handle each time, experimenting like any scientist would. It’s not really about intimacy, Steve thinks, he’s pretty sure Tony would agree that you can touch someone’s soul while sucking them off, penetration isn’t some higher form of sex act. But the physical sensations
“Survive? He was wearing—” and Steve knows before Riri says it, but he lets her finish the sentence, “—the armor in camouflage mode.”
“Good morning,” Steve says, with a clipped tone that Tony isn’t particularly thrilled about. His body is kind of rigid, and he pulls away from Tony, just enough to be noticeable.
God. Steve is an insensitive, arrogant asshole. Imposing on Tony like this, forcing his own presence on Tony while he’s trying to process his grief. After what he kept from him, Steve is here, robbing him again of peace and quiet. Preventing him from doing his healing on his own terms.
This is what Tony knows, what he has always known. Except that last part wasn’t entirely true. Maria didn’t die in a car accident. She was killed.
“It’s… like there’s a road that starts in my head and ends in yours. I can always feel you. You are always there. Like sunshine.”
He dreams of them digging a shallow grave outside, in the cold. They adjust Steve and Tony inside it—Steve still wearing his uniform, Tony still in the armor. Bucky rips a piece of cloth from his shirt and secures Steve’s head to the rest of his body while Rhodey holds it in place. Then, they place the shield, spattered with blood, over their lifeless faces, like a blanket. They’re careful and sweet as they cover their corpses with dirt and snow.
He wishes he could climb into bed next to him, hug him tight against his chest. Protect him from whatever it is that doesn’t make him sleep. Protect him from Steve himself.
“I can’t talk about this anymore,” Tony says, and he gets up, even though he’s not so sure his legs are going to sustain his weight. He staggers onto his feet and into the bathroom, every step a struggle against his heat. He feels slick trickle down the inside of his thighs and his skin crawls.
is a fleeting thought in the back of his head because he feels the heat in his belly coalesce into something electric and he barely has time to grab the base of his dick to slip out of Tony’s mouth, but Tony’s hand moves urgently from Steve’s thigh to Steve’s ass and he pulls him in again like he did earlier and Steve comes down Tony’s throat, Tony’s tongue caressing him still, his cheeks sucking all rational thought out of Steve. Tony swallows the most of Steve’s come but some of it slips through his lips, slides down his chin, catches in his goatee and Steve can only murmur, “Fuck,” against Tony’s silence.
Tony falls back on the mattress, rubs the last remains of sleep away from his eyes. He sighs and turns to look at Steve.
“In a way, yes. But maybe she didn’t see it like that. I think... you see, I knew I’d have to face people’s judgement sooner or later, because I never liked men. But Maria did. I’ve written this in the book, but… When she met Tony’s father, Maria saw in him a privileged life, with money and power. She liked him well enough, so she married him. She was practical that way. She wasn’t an opportunist, but she saw an occasion and seized it.”
Steve seemed to weigh his words. “Because it was the right thing to do,” he replied, looking down at his shoes. “Because I’m in love with you,” he added, quietly.
Sam is one of the very few people Steve has genuinely bonded with after coming out of the ice, and being separated now must be awful. Steve doesn’t love easily, but when he does, he loves hard and viscerally.
His heart pounds in his chest and fear strikes him. He won’t allow them to take Tony, Tony is his and his only, forever, he’s his Alpha and no one else can—
Steve nods and gets up. Tony sits on the edge of the bed, tries to ignore the ache in his butt. He’s too old to fall asleep on the floor.
Suddenly, she looks up at him and says, “Do you want to listen to a song?” and Steve makes the mistake of replying with a “Yes,” so he spends the next five minutes listening to Sarah sing an absurd song about a cat named Fred who only has one eye. It’s ridiculous and makes no sense and it’s the best song Steve has ever heard in his entire life. Sarah laughs so much that she has tears in her eyes when Tony enters the room.
“You don’t get to act like this after what you did. I know it seems fucking impossible to you and the others, but I actually
Her skin is fair and wrinkled, stained with age, but healthy. She’s wearing a coral lipstick, and has a bit of mascara on her eyelashes. Her long, white hair is tied up at the base of her neck in a bun, but a few strands have escaped the knot and frame her face in a way that looks like a portrait.
He thinks he feels Natasha’s hands on him at some point, she puts a fresh wet cloth on his forehead.
“I’m trying. It’s very hard... As I said, it was complicated. Many bad things happened all at once; we couldn’t keep up with them. I can’t tell you which things, Sarah, not because you wouldn’t understand, but because you would, and they’re very sad things, baby, and I don’t wanna make you sad. But just know that we were all… hurting, and…” Tony sighs. “Don’t… you don’t have to think about it,” he finishes, and Steve feels Tony’s resolve crumble in his mind, and sees Sarah’s hands shake in a way he doesn’t like.
He sits next to her, and she hides her face in his chest and cries. Tony hugs her back and when Steve is there too she explains what happened.
He dreams of throwing the shield, of closing his eyes, of his head being severed—swiftly, precisely, neatly. This, he won’t heal from.
“Your mother used to wear hers all the time. She had it on in almost all the pictures I’d see in magazines. I already used her real name in the book, your grandfather’s too. I was trying to make it not too easy to guess who she was.”
shield—just a few feet away from him, and there are so many things he wishes he could do and feel and say before everything stops, but he can’t and he knows he can’t and he wishes he could just... that he could just feel warm for one last time, that he could feel... that he could look into Steve’s eyes one last time and have the chance to tell him, to say it to him, to say—
“I didn’t want... I didn’t want to kill him, I swear, I didn’t want to kill that kid, I didn’t want Ultron to do what it did, I, I just wanted, just wanted to... I wanted you—”
They’ll be back, though. Or so Tony hopes. He doesn’t know for sure; he can’t actually predict the future.
“Doctors that can be bought. Doctors who keep records. Records that can be stolen and made public against my will. I can’t risk something like that.”
Tony could send Sam a text. Have him come pick Steve up at the airport. Take him back to D.C. or… wherever Steve will want to go. A little surprise.
There’s a long silence after the projection disappears. Thousands of thoughts race through Steve’s mind, and he doesn’t know which ones to voice.
making me late, Dad!” so Steve lifts his hands as an apology. She leaves, still smiling, while Peter calls for her to hurry up from downstairs, or they won’t have enough time to stop for breakfast.
and I would’ve ripped away my own heart to know what to say. I remember that in the end I managed to reply that it didn't matter, but I loved him for the both of us.
“Because maybe I learned something from this mess, what d’you think? I’d talk to you. I’d trust you. I can’t... I could never do that to you again, Tony, I could never do it to myself either. If we ever end up in a situation like that again... I’d do it right.”
He’d get to blow off some steam with someone he can trust not to sell the story to a tabloid the next day while also not feeling pressured to commit to a bond while he still struggles with the effects of seventy years spent in the ice. Some awkwardness for a few weeks during Avengers business must seem to him like a small price to pay for it, because well, he’s the Alpha. He doesn’t have to care about
“Tony.” The hard shadow in Steve’s tone. The angular set of his jaw. The merciless glint in his eyes.
All of it, every memory, every sensation, every gesture, coalesces deep in the middle of Tony’s chest, in that place between the arc reactor and his heart. All of it catches fire inside him, a person made into a blazing sun.
She lowers her head, the memories clouding her mind. “I don’t know how to describe it to someone else, but Maria and I… we just clicked. We were different in many aspects, but where it mattered we were actually very similar. We understood each other.”
Steve gets up, and starts walking back to the Relais. Slowly, though; there’s no rush. There never seems to be any rush here, and for someone like him it’s hard to believe that people can live like this, and not with the perpetual and frantic urgency of everything and everyone in New York.
He can’t breathe. He just wants his mother back, he just wants to feel her soft hand caressing his cheek, her lips on his nose, the way her lipstick would leave a trace on Tony’s face every time. Her voice, singing for him at night.
“Tony, he was heartbroken. Out of his mind with grief. Whatever made him move on, I’m glad he found it.”
His thrusts grow faster and harder and then there’s that split moment of stillness before Tony comes that Steve still remembers so clearly from their better days.
He breathes through his panic. It’s fine, most of the time. He barely has time to think about it at all, actually, because taking care of her is the priority.
“And I’ll need you. You all have been pretending I was delirious, or traumatized, or whatever the fuck else, but there’s something coming. Someone coming. For Earth. And I saw it. I saw the alien spaceships. I saw where the Chitauri came from. More is coming, Steve.
One of Steve’s hands slips between Tony’s thighs. He presses his fingers between Tony’s cheeks, against his hole, and only now Tony feels how wet the fabric of his pants is, and he can’t keep his humiliation from percolating through his pores.
Steve pulls the t-shirt over Tony’s head, and in a whirl of fabric he’s free from it, free to straighten up and lock his gaze back with Steve’s.
Tony tugs Steve’s pants down just enough for his cock to spring free from his underwear. He’s so hard he can barely think, and when Tony swallows him down with that warm and perfect mouth of his, Steve blacks out with how sharp the pleasure is.
“Do you remember when... do you remember the first day on the helicarrier when we... the engine was busted, and we—”
“But I looked at you. And I felt it. Right there, while you were standing in front of the car, I felt it. Forgiveness. Love.
He kisses Steve’s mouth, then. It tastes like roses and blue, just like he knew it would. Just like all of Steve.
“Mh-mh,” Steve hums while he nips his way up from Tony’s collarbone to the back of his ear, dragging a gasp out of him. He nudges Tony to lie on his side, brushes his fingers over his stomach, just below the scars covering Tony’s chest, then travels down, below Tony’s navel, rubbing his hand into Tony’s pubic hair.
“What I said earlier. I don’t want you to think I’m so arrogant that I... that I feel entitled to dispense—”
“You really do, though, Tony. People always talk about your ego, but they don’t know you. They don’t know anything about you.”
He’s done some calculations. He remembers the night it happened. Tony thought he still had a couple of days before his heat, so they didn’t use protection. But they were never that careful, truth be told, and Tony’s heats had been irregular for a few months.
Steve looks at him, earnest and open. He caresses Tony’s cheek with the tip of his fingers. “I do,” he says. His hand cups Tony’s face. “I do.”
“Come on,” Tony urges, and Steve rips the back of Tony’s pants with his fingers, pulls at the tear to make it larger.
“I thought… for a second there, today, I thought—” and he can’t continue or much less finish, but Tony knows. How it must have looked to Steve, entering that room, Tony being suddenly unable to do what they had been planning for weeks, Steve getting distracted, being knocked out by his nemesis who unexpectedly had a weapon.
“Alright,” he says, and heads upstairs to wash his face and change into proper clothes. He doesn’t look at himself in the mirror while the water takes away the dried tears from his skin.
“Ah, here they are!” Stella cheers, taking a small box from inside the bigger one. She opens it to take out old pictures, in black and white, little in dimension. Tony sees Steve perk up at the sight.
Tony keeps interrupting himself, sniffs, his voice cracks—he’s trying not to cry again and that alone makes Steve’s eyes sting.
“Don’t give me that. What’s been going on with all this sex-twice-a-day business and the prostate massages and—”
Steve’s thrusts become quick and punishing, his thighs slapping against Tony’s ass in the most obscene way and Tony feels like crying, because this,
“Is it normal that I went months without being able to have an orgasm? I may not be twenty years old or a super soldier, Steve, but no, that’s not normal.”
“No, no, I do, I just. I was just wondering. Did you notice a, uh, a pattern, let’s say, to our activities.”
He hopes that God listens to him, and grants Steve Rogers this one wish, the only thing he can pray for without feeling selfish and arrogant.
Steve huffs a small laugh through his nose, shakes his head, worry leaving his face as quickly as it clouded it; he doesn’t really need more explanation than that. Tony nods at him, a silent
Steve takes the ice pack from Tony’s shoulder. He’s careful while he does it, searching Tony’s face for signs of discomfort.
Laura was taller than Stella, bigger and thicker. She was an archaeologist, and her skin is tanned and rough in most of the pictures, with marks on her knees, little scars here and there. She had long, black hair, and green eyes. She had a big tattoo covering most of her left arm. Her clothes and makeup tended to be bolder than Stella’s, in colors and style.
A violent whimper shakes Steve’s shoulders, he squeezes his eyes shut, bends his head down to his chest so Tony can’t see his face. “If you d—”
His hands, his silver bracelets, his dark curls framing his handsome face in such an elegant way, the gray at his temples. His bright eyes, brown and deep, alive with a million ideas. His beard, peppered with white, his beautifully tan skin. The faint smell of coconut. And then his sweaty armpits, his scuffed canvas shoes. He’s so tiny compared to Steve—Steve is really noticing it only now. The way he’s shaped: muscled shoulders, curvy hips; his belly stretches the front of his t-shirt just a bit. He’s short and small and the exact opposite of weak and helpless; Steve wants to wrap him up in his arms and kiss him, keep him forever in his bed, whisper,
Steve looks at Bucky. He seems fine. Healthy, even. He’s wearing new clothes and he got a haircut. The left sleeve of his hoodie is empty. Natasha sends furtive glances his way, the corner of her lips tugging minutely upwards, as if she’s still laughing about something silly he just said. She reaches up to take a bit of lint out of his hair, and the touch makes Bucky turn towards her, smile a smile Steve has never seen on his face. He looks like all his demons have gone quiet. Like he found something he’d lost.
“I love how you’re always thinking about my old bones.” Tony jokes, but Steve sees the moment when Tony looks at his eyes and realizes that, well, okay. Time for another kind of fun.
He closes his eyes for a few minutes to think about Tony’s face, recall—with exact precision, the only one he’s capable of—the regular shape of his nose, the wrinkles under his eyes, his dark eyebrows, his thin lips. His neck, then, his shoulders, his arms—sinewy, full. His chest.
Tony came back from college a couple of days ago, and he already fought with his father more than once. Howard has been sober so far, but I fear that won't be the case for much longer. He was talking about going to the Bahamas for a few days, I should tell him I've changed my mind. This way, we'll be far away, and even though I'll spend another Christmas away from my son, I will give him a Christmas away from his father.
“Y-yeah,” he stammers, and yelps when the entire world tilts and his back hits the padded floor, Steve stretching on top of him and dipping his head in for a kiss.
“I just wanted to say, Tony… I admire you. Really. As a person, and as an Avenger. Even when we disagree. I’m sorry if I ever made you think I had no respect for you. I’m clumsy with my feelings, with words, and I... sometimes, it feels like betraying her.”
Steve notices that Tony is awake and studying him. He averts his gaze, fixes it back to his drawing while a small blush rises to his cheeks. Then, he says, “Good morning, Tony,” in such a soft, gentle tone that Tony wishes his entire life had gone in a completely different way.
“I had lunch with Carol,” Steve says. Right, Tony thinks. People who don’t have kids have time to have lunch with their friends on a Wednesday. He remembers that.
Air gets stuck inside Tony’s lungs. He feels his heart speed up; it pounds in his ears while blood rushes through him. He feels hot all over, then suddenly very cold.
Steve’s guilt and Tony’s grief mix together at the center of the bond. They transform into something else. The one soothes the other and vice versa; each of them acting as the cure for the other.
“I hate to ask, Tony, but... I need to know if this is something you want. I know I didn’t leave you much of a choice at the airport, but I need to know if you want to do this.”
Warnings: very graphic depiction of violence and blood, gore and disturbing imagery, major character death, dead bodies/corpses. ALL of these happen in the context of two dreams (so none of it actually happens), one at the beginning and one towards the end of the chapter.
“It’s not stupid. I mean, it’s ironic, really, that you didn’t consider the possibility that I looked at you like I loved you because I actually loved you, but to be honest… It’s such a
Tony wakes up to Steve hiding his face in the crook of Tony’s neck, gritting his teeth and shaking through his orgasm. Tony feels like his muscles and his bones are made of clay, he feels all— tender and soft and— squishy. Like he’s made of clouds. Of whipped cream.
Steve searches for the cock cage in his pocket, takes his mouth off of Tony just for the time necessary to put it on him. He looks beautiful, even if he can’t get it up all the way; weirdly,
“You know... after you flew the nuke into the portal, and the Hulk woke you up... I think that was when I realized how awful it would’ve been if you were dead. That I didn’t want that. That I cared about you.”
He could take another aspirin. But he knows he shouldn’t take more than one every 24 hours, and it’s definitely not been even half as long from the last one. He could look for an open pharmacy and buy ibuprofen, and screw his heart. He could probably even get his hands on some morphine, if he applies himself, but that’s a really, really bad idea.
He feels something touch his head, and through the dizziness of pleasure he realizes Tony is stroking his hair, staring at Steve’s hairline like it holds all the secrets of the universe, his bright eyes wide with wonder.
“Tony, I want you to think this over very well. It will change your relationship with Steve, profoundly and quickly. I want you not to rush into things. I want you not to regret whatever you decide to do in the end.”
There are many people in the room with him while it happens, but it’s always the same guy putting his hands on Steve. Bald, big, Alpha. Particularly gleeful about it all. He has a
Tony doesn’t remember the words at the beginning of the song, but Stella starts singing at the right point, and from then on Tony remembers all the lyrics.
He’s always been different. Since the serum Steve doesn’t fit into standards anymore, which is fine by him. But there was still consistency, before. He knew what to expect from a rut after the first few months after Project Rebirth. And after he bonded with Tony, it got better: Mated Alphas are always quieter, calmer. They’re in a steady relationship. Their ruts lose urgency to become an occasion for intimacy, a demonstration of love and affection. They’re shorter, less intense, meant to renew and confirm an already existing bond, meant to increase the chances of procreating, if that’s the couple’s inclination.
Steve sitting on the couch, his back against the backrest, Tony slowly sinking down on his cock, feeling it so deep, feeling it in the pit of his stomach, against the back of his throat.
But Tony is who he is beyond the fact that he’s an Omega, the same way being an Alpha doesn’t define everything Steve is. Tony is a protector, a caretaker. A father, a friend.
“I know how hard this is. Or maybe I don’t, but… Perhaps pretend I’m… not your mom, but maybe… We haven’t known each other long, I know, but—”
“What do they want, Tony?” Steve tries to stifle his impatience but he’s in pain and Tony smells like someone touched him.
They stay like that for a while, without saying anything. Steve being this close is a comfort and a source of tension at the same time, but Tony doesn’t feel inclined to give it up either way.
What really fills Steve with horror is the big, red, angry scar that goes from Tony’s right nipple—which just doesn’t exist anymore—to his left ribs.
Steve had hoped it’d be the same for him. But this is a mercy no god will grant him. He should’ve known.
Tony enters the kitchen a few minutes later, his hair combed but still wet, already curling at the sides. He takes some parsley from the porch, and minces it with garlic and hot pepper. It all ends up in a pan with some olive oil and the clams.
“But… I’m not gonna pretend the wait isn’t fucking me up, either. I don’t know what goes on in your head, I don’t know what you want, I don’t know what you think. I have no idea how this will end, while you obviously already do. And I don’t know what to do with that, because I need to know, too, but you won’t fucking tell me. And I’m scared.”
But him and Tony, maybe they don’t need New York right now. Maybe they need this peace, this silence, this otherworldly expanse of wheat fields and vineyards. They need a cherry tree, a blanket on the grass.
Tony is screaming and crying, he looks like he wants to say something, but just can’t; he only manages a strangled
“When you came to that HYDRA base. And it was just me, you, and Bucky for a bit. And I could almost pretend… that everything was okay. That we’d be okay, and Bucky too. I said, I said,
Steve runs into the bedroom, and he’s about to push the bathroom door open no matter what, but then gets a hold of himself just enough to knock. Tony doesn’t reply.
about Tony leaves Steve breathless. It’s not just his brain or his personality, but the small yet solid shape of him too, and all the transformations brought on by age have not changed that.
Feeling Steve this close, feeling him inside makes Tony’s head dizzy. It’s standing on the edge of a parapet and watching the tip of his shoe go over it a little, only void underneath it, his tie flapping on his chest because of the wind. Steve is the vertigo at the door of his stomach, the itch at the back of Tony’s neck that says,
“Crazy and irresponsible and possibly cause me five thousands different health issues and turn me into a murder cyborg given my track record?”
Tony grabs one of Steve’s hands, tugs at Steve’s arm until he can press Steve’s palm to the arc reactor, until he feels Steve’s body sway forward following the arm and touch his chest to Tony’s back.
Tony watches him take out the rest of the items. He’s sitting on the toilet lid, excited that he gets to watch this.
He closes his hands into fists and shuts his eyes so he doesn’t look at himself anymore, he doesn’t witness himself disappear.
“Okay,” Steve says, with his deepest and kindest Alpha voice. “We’re okay.” He sends all the love he can muster across the bond, and he sees Tony relax. He reaches past Sarah to hug him too, and they stay like that for a few minutes, basking in their new scent of family, until all the emotions quiet down, and Sarah even smiles.
Steve tries to catch up with the events. “Oh. We, we can, we could... we could look around for another place, I guess, but it’s already... If you want to eat something somewhere, I don’t know, if... We could... If it’s alright with you... I can sleep on the fl—”
“Yeah, most people think that. But no. During the 14th and 15th centuries the abbey was left in severe poverty due to famine, epidemics, a few raids. At some point a particularly stupid abbot thought,
Steve’s instead, Steve’s hands are nothing like Tony’s. They’re the opposite—long and soft, skin smooth and perfect, fair and delicate, with no signs that they’ve ever been used. Steve’s hands are new. Steve’s hands aren’t real, because nothing stays on them. Nothing proves that Steve ever did something with them, made something with them. Colors and inks wash off easily; nothing sticks to skin that rejuvenates four times faster than it should. No calluses form, no cut leaves a scar, there’s not a wrinkle on them. They tell no story.
“Hey, don’t… don’t cry,” he tries, and Tony takes a deep breath and falls silent, but the tears still roll down his face to wet his beard.
Steve changes into running clothes in the bedroom. Tony cuddles up on the couch. He looks at Steve before he walks out of the door and feels too warm just from looking at him, with his sweatpants and sweatshirt.
Tony shifts Maria in his arms, taking her from under her armpits, careful that she doesn’t hurt her neck. He kisses her cheek this time, with more decision, making a little sound with his lips too.
Steve pushes his finger past Tony’s rim, and Tony moans and arches up off the bed with the sensation. He kisses Steve, languid and sensual, plays with his tongue and bites on his lips.
He’s not feeling very well. His head is fuzzy, his limbs are heavy. There’s a dull ache in his thighs. He can only explain it with all the sex he’s been having, but he remembers it started before that.
Tony wonders what made Steve cry earlier. He wonders what his last drawing meant. He wonders why Steve sometimes still lies when Tony asks him something, despite his best intentions of making amends.
Then Tony folds his notes, adjusts them over the laptop’s keyboard, and he closes the lid over them. He places the laptop on the coffee table.
Steve waves a hand in the air, to disperse the last puffs of smoke wafting between him and Tony. “Don’t breathe it in,” he says, “it’s bad for your heart.”
Tony leans over and kisses him, just barely, on the mouth, his fingers gently holding Steve’s chin in place.
Steve catches Tony’s wrist in his hand and guides it to his own waist in a forced embrace Tony is only half-resisting. He just says, “Careful,” so Steve doesn’t get Tony’s blood on his t-shirt. Steve brushes his palm up along Tony’s neck and kisses him.
find you hot, by the way, honestly, you’re supposed to be one of the smartest people in the world and you can’t figure out just
He arrives in a part of the cave he’s not been to yet. It’s huge, and Tony wonders how deep inside the Earth he’s gone. He looks up, but can’t tell how far the ceiling is, exactly. It could be miles.
“Seriously, Steve, we’ve got this.” She uses her reassuring voice, and it actually works, because Steve relaxes his shoulders.
“Okay,” Steve says, the word catching in his throat while he stares into Tony’s eyes. He brings their joined hands up to his face and kisses Tony’s forefinger, just above the nail.
Then Steve kisses him back, grabs at his shoulders and his neck and his t-shirt, and Tony pushes on his feet to spin around and climb onto Steve’s lap and be kissed, kissed, and kissed some more by someone who doesn’t smell like the man, doesn’t move like the man, doesn’t talk like the man. By someone that merely, and only superficially, looks like the man.
The man plays a game with him, almost every day—Tony can have food and water if he first drinks whatever alcoholic beverage is on the table. Tony never drinks it, no matter what it is, so he isn’t allowed a meal on most nights.
The weirdest sensation, though, is between his legs, where his cock is tenting his underwear, so much so that the tip is poking out of the waistband. He pushes his hips forward, but stops as soon as he remembers that the warm body next to him is Steve.
“Yeah?” Steve reaches over and twists and strokes Tony’s balls until he moans against Steve’s cheek. “Wanna come all over it, sweetheart?”
What if their entire relationship was about love and truth, instead of this strange hostility neither of them really feel, but for some reason always revert to. Instead of lies by omission, with the excuse of protecting the other, with the excuse of believing they can handle it all alone.
Steve laughs. “That’s not the right number either. And the only thing that got ruined so far is my shirt.”
Tony hesitates, and he shoots a quick, timid glance at Steve. “Maybe because we hoped that this day would arrive, baby. That we would make up at some point. That thing you felt last night, the fireworks in your head? That was me and Dad taking care of our garden again after so many years. And I’m so glad we did, but it took me too long to decide, and you… I hurt you.”
“Tony?” Steve asks, tentative, keeping some distance. He’s scared of what’s about to happen; he’s never been more scared than this.
He rests a hand on Tony’s shoulder, then looks at it as though he has no clue how it got there. He takes it away, quick, like he can pretend he never did it.
“What if I hurt her?” he asks Tony, who is slipping Maria back into her onesie. He wanted Steve to try, but Steve insisted on watching Tony do it just one more time.
“I hope so. But, Tony… You shouldn’t try to take all the blame. We made this mess together, and that’s how we should fix it.”
They’re alone in the breakfast room, the other guests have already left. The owner makes them coffee with a moka pot. The croissants aren’t warm anymore, but they’re fresh and taste magnificent.
“Maybe. But I didn’t help Bucky so Nat would forgive me. I can’t pretend the thought never crossed my mind, though.”
, which has happened only a handful of times in the past, often when one of them was hurt in some way. It was never clearly forbidden, but it was always implicitly understood that Sarah couldn’t expect her dads to do certain things that regular parents would do, unless the severity of the situation required it. Stupidly, only now Tony really sees how wrong that was, how terrible it was to do that to his own kid, that he loves more than he could ever love anything else.
It’s made of red bricks, but the underside of the arch is white and black with mold. The river passes quietly below it, a bright and clear turquoise, that catches every drop of sunshine.
. “Sorry. I should’ve known. I should’ve checked on you afterwards. But I shouldn’t have hurt you in the first place because… because...”
After a few endless minutes, he manages to close his mouth. He shuts his eyes too so he doesn’t have to look at Steve, and he wishes it worked the other way around too, like babies think it works—that if you can’t see someone, then that someone can’t see you either.
Bucky drags in a deep breath, and takes his hand away. He pours a cup of coffee for Tony and one for himself. He hides his face into it for a moment, gearing up to say something. Tony can already guess what it is.
He turns. Tony is studying a part of the building with his engineer eyes, sunglasses in hand, his nose comically close to the wall. He looks at Tony until the power of his stare makes Tony look back.
And Steve’s smile, then, Steve’s smile is so luminous and disarming that Tony would give away his entire fortune, on the spot, without a second thought, for the promise of being ever again on its receiving end.
Maybe in some of them it was worse. Maybe somewhere in the multiverse all this Accords shit ended up with someone dead. Tony hopes it was him. He couldn’t imagine himself surviving the guilt of hurting Steve in the most irreparable way. For Steve, it’d be different. He could move on. Many would probably even thank him.
Tony shifts, and regrets it immediately. He grits his teeth to stifle a groan, and waits for the burn in his shoulder to ebb away.
Tony gets on his feet and lathers up his hands, then washes between his legs, front and back, while Steve averts his eyes.
“It made me think about my mother. That she wasn’t happy either, I think.” He pauses to work attentively under Tony’s jaw. “My dad died before I was born. She had to do it all alone. We were poor, I was sick all the time. Then she got sick and died, and that was it. That was her whole life.”
“Because we don’t want another murderous artificial intelligence deciding it wants to wipe away humanity, yes—”
Steve’s tongue licking Tony’s finger. His eyes darkening with something that sent a shiver to the base of Tony’s spine.
The moment they enter the guest house, Tony feels the weight of the day crash onto his shoulders. He flops on the couch, and takes deep, slow breaths, just like his doctors told him. Damn reduced lung capacity.
He screams his release and spills it into Steve’s mouth, who swallows it all, turning a bit of Tony into himself. He licks him clean, until Tony shudders, oversensitive, and pushes Steve’s face away from his lap.
The New Avengers work well. Tony isn’t an active member of the team, but he’s proud of the work they’ve done. The world is safe in their hands. Even though no threat has been as bad as Thanos yet, he knows they’re more than capable to deal with whatever the universe throws at them.
“It’s going great, it keeps me so busy, the students are brilliant and… I’m really proud of how far we’ve come, especially with how difficult… you know, they’ve cut funds again, and…”
, and his mind is a hurricane of relief and love and something quiet that falls on them both like a blanket.
“Tired enough that I can’t even joke about it. He stopped screaming five minutes ago. Nat was about to lose it.”
Steve takes him to a hospital. It seems like a S.H.I.E.L.D. place, but they tell him S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn’t exist anymore. Tony spends three days there, being prodded and tested, then calls Steve and checks himself out.
Steve comes, the knot swells, and that’s it. They’re locked together. Standing up. Against a fucking door.
“Steve, wait,” Tony says, but it’s too late. Steve has already pressed the button. “Thank you,” Tony hastens to say.
Tony tries to open his eyes, run away from it, but he can’t; his eyes are sewn shut. He’s forced to witness it all, to feel it through until the end.
“Don’t raise your voice, it’s bad for you. And yes, I know what you mean. And we better find a solution fast because I’m not gonna lead the team.”
At a party, she met Howard Stark, who was twenty years older than her, but had a brilliant mind and a clever mouth, and Maria liked both. Her father wanted them to get married.
That’s what Tony does, isn’t it? He takes care of people. He wants to take care of virtually everyone, and he’s crumbling under the weight of that responsibility, which he can’t possibly keep carrying alone.
Steve hollows his cheek, makes a tight circle with his lips, bobs his head back and forth and feels all the ridges of the cage on Tony’s flesh, tries to get at his skin as much as possible with his tongue, feels his saliva drip down his chin and into the gray hair at the base of Tony’s dick; he’s making a mess of himself, he’s making a mess of them both.
While they eat, Tony smiles at Steve more, more openly, even if there’s still a bit of uncertainty underneath the surface of his expression, and his little grin sometimes doesn’t quite reach his eyes. Still, Steve beams at him in response, encouraging, welcoming. It’s the only thing he can do.
Tony’s back looks beautiful in the dim light of the early evening, just after sunset. His skin is smooth and tanned, and his scent still makes Steve dizzy.
The memory makes Tony think of Rhodey for a moment, of the physical sensations he associates with him. If he closes his eyes, he can almost feel Rhodey’s familiar scent of almonds, like the bodywash he’s been using since before they met, at MIT, a billion years ago. He can feel Rhodey’s solidity, the consistency of his presence in Tony’s life. His unwavering love. His loyalty to Tony, his independence.
“Yes. I would’ve,” Tony replies at once, sure of himself like he’s saying his own name. “Never doubt that I would’ve, Steve.”
Maybe Steve’s right. Maybe what counts the most about this isn’t that they always fall apart for one reason or another, but that no matter what they always end up back together.
Tony hadn’t seen it coming. He’d been distracted by Steve sleeping with him every night, by Steve’s lips on his, by Steve, Steve, Steve.
“Yes. And it defines us, doesn’t it? And it may not be the same thing, but how can someone like me, in good conscience, how can I look at him and decide that no,
The new rush of guilt spreads suddenly into Steve from the nape of his neck. It makes his shoulders prickle with shame and regret. He did this. He did this to Tony.
“Hey, Tony, hey, hey, look at me, look at me, sweetheart, it’s fine, you’re safe, just breathe, okay, just—”
He’s nothing. Just broken bones and broken skin and a wilting bond in his mind that hurts more than torture.
He’s an idiot. He’s an idiot and he ruins everything and everyone he touches. He’s like a poison to Steve and to Sarah.
His hips stutter, and all the tension is released at once, in an ugly groan that he tries to stifle with all his might.
Steve closes his eyes. The light breeze ruffles his hair, it turns into gold under the blazing sun. He looks beautiful, like an angel, like a dream come true.
Tony forces himself to ignore how hurt he feels by this. “I would’ve appreciated it if you’d told me. That’s all I’m saying.”
So, yeah, there was this baby. New baby at the orphanage. Except the orphanage couldn’t possibly take her yet, because it was undergoing the renovations Tony was paying for. Space was extra tight for everyone, and there really wasn't any room for a new baby. Especially a newborn.
He’s quick up the stairs, and once in his room, he gathers Sarah in his arms and realizes that she needs to be changed.
He doesn’t want anyone to know he’s here, so he had the Stark Industries logo on the plane painted over. He let his stubble blur the edges of his goatee, his hair grow longer. He’s wearing a gray t-shirt, blue linen pants, canvas shoes. He has a duffle bag slumped over his shoulder.
It took Steve two months to finally wash the sheets. He cried into the clean pillow case for an hour after realizing that there really was no trace left on it of anything resembling Tony’s scent.
“What about how you destroyed me, though? That’s alright, huh? I don’t get anything for that.” Tony says. His voice tastes like poison, like purple, and his left arm starts prickling with the phantom pinch of a thousand needles. “I’m not even worth a pity fuck.”
The Duomo is amazing, and Giotto’s campanile is really impressive, but they decide not to go up because Tony looks a bit terrified at the suggestion. Steve spends way too much time staring at the mosaics inside the Baptistery—their shimmering gold almost seems like the only source of light—and at the sculpted panels of the doors, in such a vivid low relief that Steve can barely believe his own eyes. The interiors of the cathedral are rather simple compared to Siena’s, but Vasari’s fresco inside Brunelleschi’s Dome is so powerful that Steve squints at it with his enhanced sight until even his neck has enough of it. The Cupola itself is a work of genius; even Tony is fascinated, and Steve wonders how it must look to his eyes.
“Shh. Hey. Don’t cry. I think we’ll all be scared when our time comes. And people like us—maybe we can’t make our deaths peaceful, but we can make them mean something.”
for a perfume. Steve doesn’t know if it airs in the States, he never watches television, except the news sometimes. And movies, yes, a couple of TV shows, but the DVDs have no commercials.
Steve lifts a hand to Tony’s face to cup his cheek, but then thinks better of it. He smiles and waits for Tony to do the same.
An alarm blares in Tony’s head—his baby is crying and he’s too weak and emotional to take care of her. Stupid, useless Omega that he is.
Kissing Tony’s knee, touching his face and his hair. Sleeping with him curled up against his side, face pressed into Steve’s ribs. Feeling Tony’s hand around his own waist. Eating the food he makes, waiting for him to be done in the shower. Filling the tub with hot water and staying there with him for hours, until the skin of his hands is wrinkled and Steve’s skin still resists being changed by time and circumstance. Kissing his jaw, holding his hand, caressing his hip. Stroking his back, massaging his bruises. Shoving his own clothes in the washing machine together with Tony’s. Hanging them out to dry.
His teammates look at him with no pity, but only deep understanding and affection. He’s not the only one with something like this in his past. He wouldn't be even by raw statistics.
He turns left, into a white trail lined up by cypresses. He parks the car in a clearing at the end. He gets out of the car to open the door for Tony, but he’s already stepping out on his own.
Tony doesn’t need to poke the bond to know that Steve feels awkward. He looks so nervous, sort of jittery. Almost as if he’s trying to make himself look smaller, which is counterintuitive at best for an Alpha.
Steve stares up at Tony, completely rapt, and groans, Tony is still fucking into him relentlessly and
“Nat,” Bucky says, his voice neutral and even, “would you mind quitting this cryptic Alpha shit and telling us exactly what’s going on?”
“Did you eat something?” Steve asks after the silence resumes, ultimately proving that he cares about Tony in the Italian way too. “Drink some water?”
Tony feels his heart in his throat and the tears just won’t stop and there’s a pounding in his head and every sound is so far away and so close all at once and the world is spinning under his feet and his knees tremble and—
A wilting bond constantly at the back of your mind, not quite dead but not really alive either—a wound that doesn’t bleed but never heals, like having a shard of glass constantly lodged in the skin between your ribs. You can’t pull it out.
, and he fucks into Tony again, desperate and unable to really control his movements or his strength, until he can’t hold himself up anymore. He crushes Tony to the floor, a hand splayed out over Tony’s shoulder blades, and Tony distantly registers that now he really can’t breathe—he’s pinned in place, mouth full of Steve’s fingers.
One morning, Tony is woken up by a completely naked Steve intent on kissing his neck. He shoves Tony’s boxers down and straddles his hips.
I wonder if common people have access to these. But then again, that wasn’t a given even in my world, and I know how hard he tried to fix it.
Steve surges forward and wraps Tony up in his arms, and doesn’t let him go even if the first contact makes Tony jump, like touching a live wire. It’s too much, it’s too much. Steve is stroking Tony’s back with his warm hand and it’s just too much.
“And you are for me,” Steve says, more serious, stepping in front of Tony, taking his shoulders between his hands. “You are for me.”
“But I don’t… It’s not like it used to be. Right after the ice, I would’ve given anything, anything at all, to go back. To my time, to her… But the last few days... I don’t know, something happened in that church we visited, remember? Before we went to Monteriggioni.”
Steve feels himself smiling. He had forgotten what that felt like, the sides of your mouth stretching out of joy instead of pain, his face wearing now a mask of something that’s not just pure anguish.
Steve kisses Tony’s temple. He passes regard and support to him through the bond, and Tony is grateful in response.
I'm happy about it, naturally. But I'm also worried, Stella, because I see something uncontrollable in Tony's eyes when he talks to his father. He wants to fight, humiliate him even, and yet he also desperately tries to please him.
In Tony’s imagination, Steve enters the bathroom and shuts the door quietly. He drags in a deep breath, his shoulders rising and falling with it, before taking off his shirt and hanging it on the towel rack. His nipples would be hard and dark, and Tony imagines himself wondering how they would feel between his teeth.
The man is often rough with him, and not in the way Tony would normally enjoy. He’s violent, cruel. Selfish. Heartless.
An impossible heat takes root low in Steve’s belly, surges into him, pins him in place, makes him fade away into a white light.
But Steve wouldn’t compromise, Steve refused to trust Tony’s advice and judgement, and it only led to that look, that look of unconditional and infinite betrayal, hurt, disgust, rage all mixed together on Tony’s face, all distilled into the vicious force of Tony’s first blow to Steve’s cheek.
Steve waits on the couch, looks at Tony make notes on his project, things to do, things to check, things to finish, things to discuss with Riri.
He’s okay. Rhodey is okay, Peter and Pepper too. FRIDAY is there, J is in his phone and soon he’ll be back for real, at his side like always.
“You know when you listen to a song, and feel like it talks to you, that it’s about you in some way?”
Farm house adapted to host guests who wish to spend time in the countryside doing a variety of activities like riding horses, tending to animals, and generally experiencing life on a farm. They also can have pools and restaurants attached and get pretty fancy in some cases.
Steve finally lets himself acknowledge the two identical circles of gray metal around Tony’s wrists. The sun catches onto their surface, makes them shine.
His arm is in the sling. It makes his shoulders look narrow, his frame appear tiny. He is, though. He is small. Smaller than Steve.
Steve snorts. “Let’s go, before the girls call the police on the two weirdos standing outside their shop.”
“Great. She seems very attached to you. That’s good. Keep going. Bring her back in a month or so for her scheduled vaccines.”
“Guess that’s why Mom loved the tapes you’d send her so much. She’d listen to them all the time. Maybe they made her feel close to you, since you never saw each other again.”
, Steve can’t help but think. Bright, clever, traveling at the speed of light to places Steve could never hope to reach. But sometimes—
Tony lays him on the ground carefully, helps him sit against a tree. There’s a clearing in front of them, the Hydra base visible in the distance. It’s an ugly, gray two-building monstrosity that wouldn’t have been out of place in fascist Italy. Steve can hear movements inside, confused orders being shouted out. They’ll catch up with them soon if they don’t haul ass fast, but Steve’s legs are dead weight and he’s completely naked. He looks down at himself and everything is either bruised or covered in blood.
Tony closes his eyes against the sun, lets the memory wash over him. There’s no point in trying to stop it now.
The moment they settle into the water, the moment Steve feels Tony’s legs touch his own, the moment he can wrap himself around Tony like a blanket, hold him against his chest like the most precious thing in the world—that’s the moment Steve almost feels warm again.
Tony wishes he could stop himself, that he could stop his brain from forming this fantasy, but he’s too weak, and has a bad track record in denying himself certain small pleasures. He just wants to feel good for a moment. It’s been
Steve leans backwards, takes Tony’s face into his hands and tips it up. Tony closes his eyes, he can’t look at him right now. Steve strokes Tony’s cheekbone with his thumb.
When he steps inside, Steve can’t see anything for a few seconds; even his eyes have to adjust to the darkness, to the contrast with the blinding light that dominates outside. He watches Tony perch his sunglasses on his head, a few feet ahead of him.
Steve is going to fuck him, and he’s gonna knot him, and he’s not gonna bite him. He’s not going to claim Tony as his mate, he’s not going to form a bond with him.
He touches his belt. He lets his hand land over the pouch where he keeps his phone. He takes it out, opens it. He scrolls down the few numbers listed and stops at
James Barnes enters the screen. He looks okay. His hair is short and clean; he shaved. He looks younger, healthier. Whole, even if he’s wearing a tank top that doesn’t hide the bad scarring where his metal arm used to be.
means a whole lot of shit. It means that Steve loves him, that Steve wants to be with him in a way Tony hasn’t been with anyone since Pepper, and everyone knows what a big disaster that ended up being. It means that maybe, in some corner of all of what’s possible and, given an infinite amount of time, bound to happen in the universe, there’s also Steve and Tony hurting each other even more than they already have.
Steve is taking pictures of a little patch of grass that’s covered with daisies. He lifts his gaze, points his finger and turns to Tony to say, “Hey, look!”
“I won’t leave you again unless you want me to,” Steve says, and he hopes he doesn’t imagine Tony shaking his head against his collarbone. “As long as you’ll have me, I’ll never leave you again.”
He can’t move and there are tears in his eyes, threatening to fall down his cheeks, and he’s struggling to keep from crying because it wouldn’t be out of release or effort now, it would be just out of pain.
Steve looks at him, and his eyes wander from Tony’s face and down to his chest again, hesitate over the arc reactor and the scar, dip as low as Tony’s stomach; then reality seems to slam back into Steve, and he jerks his gaze away and up, fixing it back to Tony’s face, although nowhere near his eyes.
That’s when Steve realizes something he should’ve probably noticed earlier: The other side of his bed looks used. Tony’s sleep clothes are lying on top of the covers, which are somewhat in disarray. Sarah is wearing her Ms. Marvel pajamas.
He feels sick, gags on it, holds himself up with a hand against a tree, but nothing comes out. He coughs and coughs and coughs until his chest burns with it, his throat hurts.
Tony enters the library of Avengers Mountain one night to find Steve there. Tony’s presence makes him ill at ease—he puts down his book and stands up, then realizes that there was no purpose for that, so he remains there, awkward in his embarrassment.
He scissors his fingers inside himself, bending a bit to gain better access, and it’s too much and too soon and he doesn’t care. He just stares at the back of Tony’s head, and his shoulders, the curve of his ass. He’s kneeling on the ground, still and obedient and facing the other way from Steve.
“Oh, I’m sure I haven’t,” Tony says, and he can’t help how bitter he sounds. “Could’ve been in another room for all it was doing for you.”
Steve walks behind him, slowly. He smells of his soap and his shampoo, enticing wooden scents that complement the perpetual sweetness of coconut underneath. The shirt Tony is wearing, not too elegant but different from his usual t-shirts, is so white it almost shines against his tanned skin. The sleeves are rolled up to uncover his hairy forearms, and the silver bracelets framing his wrists give him an air of strange nobility—their usefulness perfectly hidden by their sleek aesthetic.
“Having one leader can be dangerous, Tony. We are who we are. We tend to take too much responsibility upon ourselves, we want to protect people, each other… But together…”
“Come here, lemme—” Steve whispers, grabbing Tony’s jaw with his big hand, and bending over him to kiss him, bruising and strong and not quite himself while he licks behind Tony’s ear, below it, and then again into his mouth with the same calibrated violence he displays in battle, a measured cruelty, always a hair away from slipping through his fingers, and it might, now.
Steve realizes he’s staring at him from his chair, at Tony’s shoulders shifting under his t-shirt, at the veins in his arms. The small of his back. His bare feet.
It’s like a wound you can’t stop scratching; you pick at the scab until you get the satisfaction of it starting to bleed all over again. And then you feel stupid because you knew, you fucking
“Yeah, not how it works. But it’s fine. Heat’s still a couple of weeks away. I think. It hasn’t been very regular as of late.”
His love for Tony is nothing like that. His love for Tony keeps changing and growing and taking different shapes in his mind; it’s been coming and going in waves, perfectly timed with Steve first realizing that he was falling for someone else, with his faltering acceptance that he wasn’t betraying Peggy, that it was okay to love a man, that he wouldn’t need to keep it secret if he ever had a relationship with him.
Tony relaxes his throat. He takes some time to work his cheeks and his tongue so he gets his mouth nice and wet for Steve.
He breaks the filter off the cigarette and places it between his lips. He stops with the matchstick already lit in his hand.
But maybe it will be different if they actually do it, Tony muses, since in reality there would be other senses at play than just sight. He could feel the timbre of Steve’s voice while he murmurs sweet nothings in his ear, and Tony’s nostrils would fill with the scent of his skin. He could taste his saliva, the way it would mingle with his own on his tongue while they kiss, and Tony never let the man kiss him.
It’s like a slap to the face, Tony describing in such crude terms the most wonderful night of Steve’s life. Was it really just that to him? An
Okay, no need to panic. Tony releases the clutch, puts the shifting gear in neutral, presses on the brake with his foot. He looks at Steve.
He almost wants Tony to put an end to this, one way or the other. Forgiveness would be the ideal outcome, but at this point he’d even take the rejection, if it meant stopping this agony.
Steve slides down the bed, between Tony’s legs, hooks one arm around Tony’s thigh and places the other on Tony’s groin, thumbs at his balls, and with deliberate movements takes Tony’s soft dick into his mouth.
Despite the beard, despite his serious expression, despite the sadness that still colors his eyes, despite how much Tony still relies on him—what he looks like, most of all, is young.
Steve’s hand slides from Tony’s cheek to his chest, and then over his ribs. He’s being held in place while Steve fucks him and jerks him off at the same time, and he’s about to come and Steve is still talking and everything is just too much and Tony doesn’t know what to do except stay still and take it.
But he has no such luck. Steve follows his every movement while he slips back into bed. The white around his eyes glimmers in the moonlight. Tony smells like bleach.
with him, this awkward confession about himself, this shameful and embarrassing weakness, this humiliating sign of age and change and mortality.
The armor retreats to the bracelets. Tony takes a breath, but the smell of burnt flesh hits his nostrils immediately and makes him want to be sick. It’s dark green in his mind, rotting, disgusting.
It was too enthralling. How he talked, fast, the speed of light. His arms stretched up to reach into the machinery he was working on, the dirt on his hands, under his fingernails. His body changed over the years. Maybe he thought I hadn’t noticed.
Last, that his daughter is curled up as close to him as she can without actually touching him. Someone must have been very clear about that.
He feels angry. He feels focused only on one thing. He needs to let this energy out before it explodes. There’s only one way. He swallows at the thought, because he still knows it’s wrong.
“There was no way he could’ve done it if he was still alive. I mean—if they thought he was still alive. Osborn knew that Tony would find a solution, he had tried to kill him already in the past, he just—”
“I just wish I remembered the moment, you know,” Steve says, quiet and pensive, while Tony is resting his head on his chest and cataloguing every beat of his heart. “The moment we became one again, after ten years. With all the things I wish I could forget… My mind has a sick sense of irony.”
But before Steve can drive himself completely crazy about it, something else happens. It’s almost a month after their first (
Tony is straddling him now and gasping for breath and reassurance, so Steve wraps him up in a hug and kisses his stomach and licks over his ribs and says, “I love you. You’re my husband, I love you.”
They’re a good family. Sarah is a happy kid. She doesn’t know that her dads aren’t like all the parents she sees at the nursery school, all her friends’ parents. It’s extremely rare for mates to break the bond after having a kid. And sure, Steve and Tony didn’t break it. They just…ignore it.
“Nothing,” Tony says, but it makes him feel ridiculous, lying to Steve’s face like this, so obviously. “Everything,” he tries, and it seems unnecessarily, overly dramatic, even for him. He settles for, “I don’t know.”
Tony feels strange. Drawn to Steve, tired. In need of some form of comfort he’s too afraid to ask for. He feels on edge, too. His hands don’t feel steady.
Tony wears it even if he’s still barely half-hard, places Steve’s hand on himself, and Steve feels him getting harder, but Tony has never been hard while Steve was inside him before.
“I don’t know much, actually. It was during a mission. 2009, I think? Maybe before. Some doctor, no idea who exactly... Barnes was sent to kill him. Nat was sent to protect him. From what I got, Barnes’ brainwashing faltered at some point, and Nat… she helped him how she could, I suppose. He was scared, confused. They hid in a safe house for three days, guess that’s when they bonded, I don’t know. Anyway HYDRA found them. Nat ran, but they took him. And I guess they gave him a nice mindwipe and a new and improved brainwash to put him back to work.”
