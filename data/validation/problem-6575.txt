"Not sure yet, something with chicken, but it'll be for dinner," Rhodey said looking back at the chicken, then moving to go for the pantry. "I have to take stock of what you actually have in your kitchen."
"Listen, we all know that next month is my birthday," Tony said, quickly changing topics. "And, SI has sponsored a vehicle in the Monaco Grand Prix." Mary raised an eyebrow at him over the notebook. "I want to take you and Peter with me to Monaco, to celebrate." Now Mary's eyes widened. "It's like a family vacation, kind of, thing. Those happen, right? For birthdays?"
Tony let out a couple more body shaking sobs, catching his breath. He opened his eyes, keeping his head tilted down, eyes meeting Steve's chest. Tony turned Steve's hands a little, so that his palms were resting against him. Then, he started to slide his hands down, until one palm rested completely on the arc reactor. He felt Steve tense a little, but then the fingers curled slightly around the reactor, pressing against the skin around it. Tony shivered, fought the feeling of rising panic, and didn't move.
Steve grabbed the last guy and slammed him down onto the floor, then gave a punch to his jaw before he turned at another gun shot. The shield slammed into the closed door, cracking in the doorframe and swinging open. Steve blinked, his arm drooping with the shield when he looked inside the room.
As he crossed the street to the block where Dr Strange was, Tony felt a soft tingle travel down his back. He glanced over his shoulder but didn’t see anything. When he turned back, the townhouse stuck out like a sore thumb, and yet no one paid a second, or even first, glance to it. There had to be a scientific explanation for it. Magic be damned.
“California, yes,” Tony said with a nod, sitting on the end of Peter’s bed. The car was downstairs, ready to take them to the jet. Steve had already packed up Jamie’s stuff, and everything except for Peter’s stuff had been packed in the truck of the car.
"If you don't go, I'm going to kick you," Tony told him. "But you better take lots of pictures." Tony pulled one of the prototype Starkphones out of his pocket. He had planned on giving it to Steve on the way back to the Tower, but this worked, too. "Peter will never let you live it down if you don't have something to show when you get back." Steve blinked as he took the phone. "It's got all the important numbers in there, and I got that number. I'll let you know the second something happens here." He was purposely trying to avoid things that might make Steve feel guilty for leaving, but they both knew that they were talking when Mary woke up.
“Mary,” Steve said with a choked off chuckled. “He helped save the world, and Tony may or may have told me it’s okay to just keep calling him Bruce.”
"Depends on the reaction once I replace these wires," Tony told him, risking a glance. He could see Steve's blues eyes through the helm, concern written all over them. "This is either going to shut down, and everything will return to normal right away. Or it's going to release all the build up energy at once, causing small blackout that won't last long, and then after a few hours everything else will return to normal."
“Is that so? Alright, let’s do an Army V Air Force rematch next week. Your boy and I will take you and your other boy on.” Rhodey issued the challenge, but Steve looked at Tony in confusion. Tony grabbed a tablet and had to spell it out, literally, because he couldn’t get the air to talk. ‘Rhodey Wilson vs Rogers Barnes.’
"I liked you better when you were frozen," Tony muttered. "You were silent, and not so sassy, then."
Please, continue giving your feedback, it really brings a smile to my face to see your comments, to see the kudos and likes, and bookmarks, and the views. Thank you to Everyone! Enjoy!
"How was the 'fun-vee'?" Tony let out a strangled laugh and Rhodey pulled Tony into him, concealing silent sobs, but Rhodey could feel the tremble in his body.
Steve nodded a little as he listened. “So, now we start trying to track her through surveillance cameras?”
"The couch is a pullout, Tony," she smiled at him, pushing his shoulder lightly, making him get up from the couch. She pulled off the cushions then effortlessly pulled out the mattress, the support bar coming to rest just past the coffee table, the clearance of the pullout not requiring the coffee table to be moved.
He took large steps back as Steve released his two companions, the room just big enough to fit Arcanine’s height, and Braviary’s wing span. Tony had to turn his head away, not wanting to watch the reunion, feeling like he was intruding. As he did that, he missed as the working elevator door opened. But he didn’t miss the shocked, but overjoyed cry.
"But he's not handling it," Mary fired back, turning her head to look at him now. "I already went through this with Steve, I can't watch it happen to Tony, too. He'll never forgive himself if he has an attack when Peter's around."
"I don't have a choice." Tony blinked at the gruff voice that spoke to them, surprised. The sounds of the quinjet had the man surprised this time, and he turned quickly, jumping out of the window quickly.
"Have you been good for Mr Stark, baby?" Julie asked Wade, messing with a little cowlick on the top of his head.
"Jarvis will get the information, don't worry, I'll take care of it," Tony assured her quickly. "Listen, got an idea, but gotta run it by you."
"If you were a guinea pig for the important experiments, you'd know it, Rogers," Tony said with a smirk. "If you get that excited over it, let me know when you're back, we can get started right away. I've got a couple of questionable things that Bruce doesn't even want to get near."
Peter tried to hide a yawn, but Tony felt it, his hand rubbing the young boys back. The doctor finished wrapping his wrist, giving him some order that he was probably going to ignore, and put his arm in a sling. That would probably be taken off in a matter of hours.
There was barely any information on a Sarah Mueller. Actually, there was too much information, because there were thousands of Sarah Mueller’s in the Northwest of the US alone. But, with a little digging, a search for a Hilda Mueller born in Germany with one sister by the name of Etta, that narrowed down the search results significantly.
Also, if you go to my Tubmlr page (megaranoelle.tumblr.com) you can catch some behinds the scene stuff about the fic. No spoilers, promise. Maybe you can influence the story.
He didn’t pay much attention to what Strange did that got him back to the Tower, but he was thankful as it was just down the hall from their bedroom. Steve didn’t much remember getting him and Tony back into the bedroom either, just that he found himself sitting up in the bed, and unresponsive Tony in his lap. His chest moved smoothly with his breaths. Steve ran his hand through Tony’s hair and took a deep breath.
"..... I'm keeping my promise of letting you meet my kid," Tony grumbled back to him. He wasn't about to let Rhodey know that he was a little correct. That he would feel more comfortable if Rhodey spent the night, so that he wasn't alone.
"It's for a good reason," Tony said with a soft smile. He leaned in and kissed Steve's shoulder, trailing his fingers along his side, delighting when a shiver ran through Steve's body. "Thoughts of you still rolling around my brain, and it makes me sound sappy as shit." Steve chuckled quietly. "Seriously, I should only get like that when it comes to my kid, and even then it doesn't get this bad. I have a reputation to uphold you know."
"Well, considering that Wade asked if we were having sex several months ago, I'm gonna assume he's ignored the list." Tony snorted a little. He looked down when he felt Jamie started to squirm. "Ah, someone's starting to wake up. Does Dad want to go check her diaper?"
"I'm just hoping that he won't be there hovering over my face anymore," Tony commented before reaching over to steal one of Steve's fries.
There was a soft laugh, and he finally heard a smile in the voice on the line. "Alright, I'll go." Tony smiled a little. "Thank you Mr-Tony."
Tony hummed a little and Steve’s attention was drawn back to him. “Ruby,” Tony murmured sleepily. Up above, Ruby lifted her head up. “You need a haircut. We don’t need a repeat of two years ago.” Ruby yawned with a squeak, and that prompted Tony to open his eyes. He first saw Steve smiling at him, Vee cradled in his arms, and the other Gems next to him on the couch, also staring at him. Brave let out a soft caw, that sounded suspiciously like a laugh, and Arc huffed again. Tony slowly sat up, and everything came back to him. He had fallen asleep against Captain America’s pokemon, on his Arcanine to be exact.
"He's a scientific genius," Selvig said from behind them. Mary narrowed her eyes at Barton. How dare he put her son in danger like that. "He could possibly have resources that we would be able to use."
"The second bedroom," he answered, crossing his arms over his chest in amusement. The room was packed with furniture and a couple totes, barely enough space to walk in. They could make out a new dresser on a wall by the window, and a changing table on the perpendicular wall. Those were the items that could be reached.
His screams were no longer silent though when he felt fingers start to peel back the skin around his fingers. “Stop!!” His voice cracked with pain, his body unable to move and thrash. “No! Stop!” Fingers stopped, and he struggled to take even breaths. Tony’s eyes stared up, into space, watching stars and nebulas, sharp and burning pain streaking through his hands. A strangled scream forced itself up his throat when white hot pain suddenly blossomed at the tips of each finger, pins being jabbed in. Brown eyes widened, pupils blowing wide as the view above him started to twist and move, and then he was suddenly moving past stars, other galaxies moving past him, and his own Milky Way Galaxy came closer, before stopping.
"Sir, if you are to pick up Young Master on time, I would suggest leaving soon," Jarvis interrupted Tony's incoming tirade. Bruce was silently grateful, and he thought that maybe the AI knew what was coming. Tony blew out a breath through his mouth and nodded.
"Did you tell Dad that it's because you're going to grow like a freaking weed?" Tony said looking at Jamie, smiling as she smiled at him. "Yeah, you're gonna grow super fast, and I should probably just hire a tailor for you."
"I want her moved her," Tony said automatically. "The Tower, the Manor, I don't care. I want her where I can keep an eye on her. Jarvis will be watching her twenty-four hours, and I'll be getting the best doctors in the world to come."
"Agent," Tony responded, watching peter examine the drawing table, then opening all the shelves of the storage compartments right by it.
"Peter is safe." Tony's head jerked up at the new voice, a male voice, one he had never heard before.
"Yeah, Jarvis said that it's been almost fifty hours, and it's been almost ten hours since the last time you ate something." Jarvis was so getting his code re-written after this. "And you'll have to take a break to eat, and since that has to happen, maybe you could watch a movie with me. Down here, in your workshop that is. I know there's a couch in there."
"Seventy-Six hours." Jarvis tattled. Traitor. There was that look from Steve, one that he would get from Mary sometimes as well. Like he was doing something he knew he shouldn't be doing.
“A house?” Tony raised an eyebrow at him skeptically. “Something with less space? Like, on the ground, with a yard and all of that?”
"I'll be back in a little bit, okay?" Peter nodded and Tony kissed his forehead. "Then we'll head back to the Manor once all our business is sorted."
“Train wreck?” Tony jumped, almost falling out of his chair when Steve spoke behind him. Rhodey started laughing harder.
"Dean has longer eyelashes than Mary. I wouldn't say that that's dashing." He chuckled at Tony's pout. "Don't worry, he fills out later. I saw pictures of the current season, and he looks nothing like that now."
Steve sat at the security desk of the school, looking over the security footage from earlier in the day. He saw a blonde woman walk into the office, signing out Wade, and a few minutes later the boy walked in with his bag. Steve could make out the frowned on Wade’s face before the woman was moving to take his hand, nearly pulling him out. There was no denying that it was Hilda, but he didn’t think that she would show up so soon as revealing herself to Bucky.
“I had everything worked out,” he said in a soft voice. “All those ugly technicalities that no one likes to think about, or worry about.”
"You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, Doctor?" Natasha looked at Banner, and both Bruce and Tony look back at her.
“Oh come on! You can’t even use the cool name?” Tony was far from disappointed with the choice though. “Flynn Rider, call me Flynn Rider.”
“Now this isn’t becoming fair,” Tony mumbled as he took the picture. He pat Peter’s back and he ran over to get one more pictures with both the actors as Steve walked back over to Tony, taking Jamie in his arms. She cooed and pat Steve’s cheek happily.
She turned her head to look back at Tony. “Hey there gorgeous, why the long face?” She wiggled her nose a little. “Yeah, I know. Papa’s being mean, isn’t he? He wants to send you off for the night.” Steve’s expression deadpanned in Tony’s direction. “I know you’re a good girl, though, and you can do this.”
Natasha watched him for a few seconds. "Fatherhood suits you, Stark." Tony looked up at her, frowning a little. "I've seen you before Afghanistan, and you're completely different, you're tamer, not so drunk."
"Has he said anything?" Tony asked. They had removed the mouth guard after the first day, (Tony admits that it was his own perverse pleasure after Loki had tricked him), but he hadn't said anything since then.
"Bucky's oldest sister," Steve reminded him as they headed for the elevator. Tony leaned in to press on the touch pad and the little girl was trying to lean forward when she saw the lights flash.
“Mary’s gonna take them,” he finally admitted. “Be easier to make sure we’re in the clear.” Steve hummed a little, nodding, and turning back to his daughter.
Mary and Coulson were the first agents inside the room after blowing the lock, Pepper behind them. Everyone drew their weapons, her senses on high alert. They saw a suit there, off to the side.
“She wants me to talk to a therapist.” Wade scrunched up his nose. “Why do I gotta talk to another adult? They don’t know anything about me.”
“Watch out, or I’ll take your presents back and get you a harness and a leash,” Tony threatened before turning around to face his son. He walked over and pulled Peter up into his arms. “I’ll make sure that it’s bright neon green.” Peter’s face twisted in disgust. “Yeah, that’s right. I’m your Dad, and I have all the power. Don’t you forget that.” He turned and left the bedroom, with Peter in his arms, and they headed for the living room.
Once they had crossed the bridge it didn’t take too long to get out to the apartment building. Tony and Steve had decided that it would be easier for Steve to take Peter through the apartments to get their stuff, and Tony would go with Wade to the hospital. The hospital was only a couple minutes away from the apartments so Tony and Wade would most likely be back by the time Steve and Peter were done. Tony leaned back to kiss Peter's head when he and Steve got out of the car, waiting until they were inside before heading to the hospital.
"I'll never stop being hounded until I either give a suit up, have on stolen from me, or have the walls broken down by a tank, because someone else like Vanko decides to do something." Rhodey nodded at Tony words. "So, I'm going to do what they want, on my terms." Tony smirked.
"He fell asleep a little before I did, so about two hours." Tony held the door open for him and they went for the elevator. "I would think that he should be ready to wake up anytime. I'm willing to bet that if you put a Wade within ten feet of him-"
"Daddy?" Peter called out a little as he got closer to the couch. The TV went on mute and Tony sat up immediately, turning his head to look for the little boy.
"And we have to move from subtle, to direct," Meg added. "And Gods above if the man doesn't get the direct route."
He forgot how hard it was with his own hands to get the reactor plugged in, and it didn't help that his hands were still shaking as the effects of the paralysis wore off, and his own weakness from the shrapnel combined together. He almost cried with relief, slumping over, at the sound of the click, as the reactor connected in his chest. Now he just had to catch his breath.
"Oh, goodness no," Mary said chuckling. "I'm not his type, and we're much better off as friends and co-parents." She looked at Steve and gave him a soft smile. "A lot has changed when it comes to relationships as well, for better and worse. I'm not a single mother, but I am dating someone right now, as well. Peter seems to like him, and I was kind of worried about that." There was a short jingle, and then a high pitched voice coming from Mary's pocket,
"Right, of course I'll call," Tony nodded, agreeing in much the same manner that he had with Pepper. "But, I won't need too, because I won't be alone. So that's all settled. I'll just be here, so you let me know what's good for you and Peter, cause I know that the FBI probably doesn't give all their Agents holidays off, and that's when we'll do stuff. I have a seriously open schedule, able to accommodate practically anyone." Tony eye briefly glanced over to the mini bar in the back of the workshop, before making himself get up to grab his tools.
"Brought lunch," he announced with a smile. He flipped out the legs and put the tray over Tony's lap before taking a seat across from him on the bed. Sometimes Steve would bring his food in as well and eat with him. Tony brought up his legs, sitting up a bit more, to give Steve more room. "Happy just got here to help Peter put all his presents in the car."
Tony was a natural showman, that was obvious, and Steve was unable to see this Anthony as the same Tony who was Peter's father, that loved the little boy, and agonized over not being able to him. The business man on stage didn't sound anything close to the man who had anxiety attacks at night about deep dark secrets that he couldn't leave in Afghanistan.
“One day, you might find yourself in a house,” Steve said, looking at him briefly, before looking back down at Jamie. “Not a mansion, or a Penthouse a thousand feet from the ground.”
"Let me know if you still can't get a hold of them by dinner time, I'll go out and get them myself." Tony found Peter's backpack that had been on the Hellicarrier and made sure that his sketchbook and art supplies were still inside. "I'll get them a satellite phone as well if I have too."
“Remodeling, remember?” Tony reminded him, poking his arm with his free hand. “And, I’ll remind you of who has all the pockets and pouches today, so I have-“ He stopped when Steve slipped two fingers past the ties of the doublet and showed Tony part of his phone. “They put a hidden-“
When Steve stepped out, he stopped, smiling widely, almost laughing that they had decided to wear the same three pieces of clothing, just in different colors. Steve shot him a dazzling smile and walked over to him, leaning in to kiss him softly. "You look, really, good," Tony said when they pulled back. "You cut your hair, too."
Tony walked into the dining room, smiling a little when he saw Peter and Wade huddled next to each other, books and notebooks open with their class work. Between Jarvis and Julie, the boys seemed to be very happy in their home schooling lessons. Perhaps it was that they kind of felt that they were skipping school that the rest of their friends had to go too, and that they got to go on ‘educational’ field trips with Mary, and Steve, and the Fitzpatrick’s. He and Julie had decided that they would try again with school for the high School years, letting the boys graduate together, and be able to walk with the rest of their class, getting their diplomas.
Steve suddenly felt a flush of shame sweep through his body. He had once thought that Tony was an absent father, one someone who only put in the minimum effort with Peter. He had actually thought that Peter deserved better than someone who could only 'try' to make time for their son. But, now that Steve could put all the pieces together, he saw that Tony was doing almost everything in his power to be a good Dad, without exposing Peter to the tabloid sharks. It had to be hard, and it was only going to get harder.
The woman raised an eyebrow at him, looking a little disbelieving at his claim, but there was still a bit of a smile on her face. "You listen to Backstreet Boys?"
"Makes it hard to pull even an eight hour shift," she admitted. "Wade's really observant, too, about when I'm having a bad day." She smiled a little. "He's a smart kid, that boy of mine."
"Because he was able to keep an eye on you," Steve spoke up this time. "Your routine hadn't really changed that much, I'm assuming, and maybe for a while he was content that it didn't look like you were moving on."
Tony turned the hand that had been on Steve’s chest, and laced his fingers with the hand that had still be resting there. “I hope you know that you can talk to me, too,” Tony told him. “Like what you said to me, we have to talk to each other, to keep this thing working. Not fair for me to put all my shit on you, and you not be able to return the favor.” He swallowed and pressed his head a bit harder against Steve. “And, I may seem a bit crap at all this, for a bit, and maybe a bit longer than that, but I’m trying, or I’ll really try, harder, more-“ Steve squeezed Tony’s hand to make him take a breath. “Right, but I’m serious. This is me, getting used to the fact that it’s not just me, and it’s us, and I want it to be us for a while, cause I like this. This, being happy thing, and not being alone.”
Suddenly the entire compound rumbled, shaking her balance, and she reached for her gun. She turned around, glimpsing inside of the lab and saw a bright blue glow from the edges, then silence. The silence set her on edge. Not as much as the resulting explosion and gun fire did though. Mary grabbed her phone, sending an alert to Coulson, and edged inside the lab entryway silently. There wasn't so much noise now, but she could hear soft voices, a male voice, but it didn't sound like Fury, or even Barton.
“Don’t you dare!” Steve pointed at Wade who was standing in front of him, Jamie in Steve’s lap. He was sitting on one of the benches to a picnic table while Tony had taken Wade and Peter to some of the food trucks. Steve was sure that the boys were going to be hyper from a sugar rush later, but even Steve had enjoyed elephant ears, and funnel cakes at Coney-Island before the serum.
Tony shook his head, taking one of the baskets from Steve. “Nothing big, I’ll tell you about it back at the hotel.” Tony wasn’t sure what Steve would think about it, wasn’t sure if he would be ready to not only come out publicly, but also come out publicly as in a relationship with Tony Stark. “Some people are starting to guess that it’s me, and they’re taking pictures. Low key, no mainstream yet. There are some adorable pictures out there though that I have to show you.” Steve glanced at him as they put all the stuff on the counter to ring up, Peter hanging on to the edge. “I’ve already got Pepper taking down anything with Jamie in the pictures, just in case.”
“Were you hunting down HYDRA?” Wade asked, and Steve still hated the fact that his kids new about these enemies. In a perfect world, they would have only known about them in the history books. But also in a perfect world, he probably wouldn’t be Captain America.
Steve brought one hand up, tilting Tony's head back down. His fingers were soft against Tony's skin, and Tony closed his eyes. "Did I mention that there were a lot of unfair things about you? This would be one of them."
Tony sighed a little and put the razor down and picked up his phone. Tony couldn't let this go on without retaliation.
Tony snorted, taking a couple steps back. "He was an idiot." Steve frowned a little, but didn't say anything. Tony was angry, and he couldn't blame him. "For taking on Loki alone."
, did I ever build one." He let out a hollow laugh. "That's where the suit was born. But, Yinsen, damned, brave, bastard, he saved my life again. Got himself killed in the process. He told me to get back here, to get back to Peter, he helped me make sure that I could do that." Tony swallowed thickly, and suddenly it was Steve's hands that were covering Tony's.
Mary moved from the seat to kneel in front of Tony, putting hands on his arm. "I've said it once, I've probably said it half a dozen time, but I'll say it again," Mary started, her voice soft, but confident. "You may not be a conventional father, but you are one, and you are a damn good one. Are you perfect? No, but I'm not a perfect mother either. Do you intentionally hurt Peter?" She shook her head. "You want nothing but the best for him, and you want to keep him safe. You're trying to spare him the kind of childhood that you had; trying to keep him out of the camera's eyes, which has to be extremely hard.
"Lying in a bed for that long probably didn't help either." Tony made sure that there were more pillows in her reach when she finally stopped moving. "I'll hit the light on the way-" he glanced back as her hand grabbed onto his wrist.
Tony nodded a little, snapping his fingers and pounding the flat part of his fist against his open palm in a nervous habit. "Then, I guess we can tell him together that we'll all be moving to New York."
Tony covered it up by walking over to Thor, no longer looking at The Neighbor. He was never going to use his name now. Ever. "No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing."
“Dear ole Dad didn’t want to wait for Bruce’s okay on test subjects,” Tony almost spit out. “Don’t know how he did it, but he was already trying to change me.” He could feel his hands shaking in Steve’s, and he wasn’t sure if they were shaking in rage, or denial.
"Yeah, my bed is bigger than this one though." Peter's eyes widened a little more, and Tony chuckled a little. "I'm an adult, though, I need a bigger bed!"
Tony cards his fingers through Steve's hair in bed that night, listening to his even breathing in the dark of their room. But he wasn't asleep. "You have talent," Tony said quietly. "Anyone else would think that you're asleep." Steve hummed, a low rumble spreading through his body.
"You were that small once," Tony told him, trying for a difference tactic. "You started walking for me on your first birthday, but you still needed help."
"Consider done," Tony told her. "In the morning we'll get everything settled away. Todd's really good with kids, too. He's got two girls that are around Peter and Wade's ages, and Wade already knows him."
"You know," Tony said casually, "you look a little hot in that suit!" Tony was already lifting the hoses, pressing down on the handles before Steve could get his shield back into his hand. He took a clean shot to the face, and one to the chest. Tony bust out laughing when Steve spit out a stream of water, then gasped when a jet of water hit his shoulder. Steve was grinning, shield in one hand, another hose in the other.
"Closer to Malibu, not as dangerous where you live." Tony had found a nice apartment complex, kid friendly, and not on a busy street, easy to not be spotted and recognized.
“This is why you’re my favorite, Pete!” Rhodey called with a grin, grabbing the pass from Sam and tossing the basketball to land with a swish.
“No,” he shook his head and sat on the edge of the bed. “This is Amethyst, Tony’s Espeon.” She answered with a delighted chirp, closing her eyes as Steve reached over to pet her. “He’s gone for a business for a week, overseas, and he asked if I would watch the Gems. Well, except for Ruby, his Flareon.” Vee and Amethyst both let out little calls. “Ruby is very shy, never leaves Tony’s side. And I feel more comfortable if one of the girls is with him just in case he runs into trouble. Sometimes the Iron Man suit can’t get there in time.”
"That's your ride, get in it," Tony told her. He had already shaved five minutes off of his flight time. "Start driving, immediately, get to a busy road."
"Is it true that Captain America was there?" A female this time. "Has someone else really taken up the mantle?"
Tony pressed past Steve, and this time he wasn't stopped. Tony grabbed his collar, pushing him back up against the door. "You're not getting a cent out of me. You think that you're the first person to try this with me? I will bury you in so much legal-ese and lawsuits that it'll make your head spin. I know your kind, and the demands will never stop coming."
"I've never told you my middle name." He didn't know why, but it was sometimes fun to get Meg all riled up.
"I'll tell him that it's for work, which is true." Steve wished that Tony would look at him. "It isn't a radio silence mission," he said quietly. "I just won't be around in the Tower. We can still talk on the phone, or video chat."
"Tony is a professional at conferences," Pepper stopped him. "Trust me when I say that, he can handle anything. Well, unless he has another superhero alter ego to announce." Tony snorted, smirking a little. "You'll want to keep you anonymity, Captain." She clicked her tongue a little and both men fell in line behind her like a couple of trained pups.
“I think it’s a little early to ask that,” Steve told him as they got onto the elevator, Tony hitting the button for the top floor. “Although the lobby is nice.”
“Already been contaminated!” Tony said, a little hysterically. “And you think that would be the easy part, just go ahead and use that, but no, Howard was a special sort of-“
Steve glanced at Tony, but the man was leaning against the door frame. He made a motion with his hand, sweeping it out, encouraging him to explore the room. This was obviously an office, someone office, but it hadn't been used in years. As he walked around the other side of the desk he saw that there were some folders stacked in the center, and just a few picture frames were sitting on the desk.
“I can’t expect Buck to be able to handle both of you at the same time,” Steve said, trying to hold back his smile. He shared a look with Peter. “What’s one more lesson, hmm? Plus, it’ll be good for demonstrative purposes.”
Tony hesitated, wincing at himself. Peter was almost two now. Tony had wasted two years already. "Uh, no," he shook his head. "I didn't want to be around, actually."
"You look like something's troubling you," Mary commented as she looked at Steve, standing just inside the living room, his arms crossed over his chest. Troubling was not the word she would use, but she didn't know what was going to happen.
"So, I've actually got you the apartment next to mine," she started heading for the door and Steve followed. She pulled out a key and opened the front door, holding it open for Steve to walk in. "We're the only ones on the ground floor, I thought it might be easier, and give a little bit of privacy." They passed a staircase, Steve took a second to glance up, then looked down the hall and saw two doors that were across from each other. There was a '1' on the door on the left, and a '2' on the door on the right.
He saw the Avengers, they went down in battle, they fought, like they were expected too. As Tony walked closer he saw a woman slumped over, familiar brown hair falling over her face. Mary had been reaching out to someone, something. When he saw the shield, the familiar shield, lying broken in half on the ground, he fell to his knees next to the body. Tony couldn't breathe, his hands were shaking, but he forced himself to reach out, to check for a pulse.
"But he works for SHIELD," Steve said, picking up a folder from the coffee table. Romanoff had gotten him a copy of Tony Stark's file from the SHIELD database. When he looked at the picture inside, he couldn't believe that it had taken him this long to figure it out. He should have been paying more attention.
Tony was chewing on the inside of his cheek at Wade's words. He wondered how bad the boys Mom was, what kind of cancer she had, and if she should really be out and about. He was glad that he hadn't sent her out alone, and the volunteers would have called if something had happened. But in the morning Tony wanted to talk to her, he could help her.
Steve looked at Tony, giving him a little smile, then smiled at Peter, nodding. "That's good, I'm glad that you didn't get hurt."
“I’ll make it up to you, I promise.” Steve hummed and Tony smiled a little. Tony had taken Peter’s hand again, feeling the energy coming from him, smiling more when Steve’s arm wrapped around his waist.
"What about the other superheroes that were with you?" Of course they only wanted to hear about that.
Tony let out a sigh. "One day, we won't have to worry about any of this. I won't have to worry that Peter thinks I don't spend enough time with him, or that I don't love him enough."
"I can believe it," Tony nodded. "You've been like this almost as long as I've known you. What would the world do if they knew that their paragon of virtue was not nearly as innocent as they believe?"
Wade went for Steve's suit and Peter hopped back up on the bed. "Wade, I need a comb!" Tony smirked, watching the boys work with a ruthless efficiency that Peter never even gave to his homework.
"Okay, but we're ignoring the fact that he was Loose in the Mansion last night," Tony brought up. "You'll forgive me if I don't trust a Single syllable that comes from his mouth. He kidnapped my son, tried to mind control me, and shoved a torture device on my mouth because he can't take a joke! And then I found him playing with the temperature in Rogers' room last night, because he got the wrong room looking for Me! How do we know he isn't trying to kill us off, one by one, or just me?"
"Hey gorgeous, having a good time?" Mary bit her lip a little as Steve Rogers’s voice came through the phone. He had been trying to keep it low, but she would know his voice anywhere.
"Last year Earth had a visitor from another planet, who had a grudge match that leveled a small town," Fury was telling them, managing to look at all of them. New Mexico. "We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned." Tony couldn't help but wonder if SHIELD had had a hand in getting the government involved in wanting one of Tony's suits. The Iron Man suit would be ridiculously overpowered with the tesseract. "And you're not the only threat. The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, they can't be controlled."
"Your mother has the blessing of a Saint in every religion," Tony groaned out, falling back onto his pillow.
“I can’t remove the influence on you, not while he still lives,” Loki spoke up, and Tony shot him a small glare. “As I’ve said before, and I shall say again, I can’t do much that includes the brute without the staff, and gem, back. Should I try anything, he would be able to find me, and I would be used, again, as helplessly as you have been.”
Tony had already moved Peter to his lap, a plate of waffles in front of them. "It's not Saturday, Daddy."
It seemed that the others had been able to make a family after the war, and Steve was happy to see it. Howard's wife was beautiful, dark hair and green eyes. Steve looked back at the file, reading through the file, skimming until he got to what had happened after the war. Howard had been integral to the Allies victory, but Steve wondered at what cost. Stark Industries had helped America in the arms race, making new weapons, and propelling his business. Howard had also had a son, Anthony, but there was no picture attached. Anthony wasn't mentioned much through out the rest of the file. And then something as simple as a car accident had claimed their lives. He wondered what Howard would think he was alive today, Steve wondered how it would feel to have a familiar face around as well. Maybe, soon, he might look for this Anthony. Maybe it wouldn't be too weird to speak with an old friend of his father's. Maybe.
"J, is the call connected in the car?" Tony asked, bringing his attention back to the present. He pressed his legs as close together as he could, arms tight to his side, making himself as fast as possible.
Steve was looking through some records when he heard a couple voices in the hallway a couple hours later. He walked over to the door, found the peephole in the door, and gave it an experimental look. He was a little shocked at the distorted view, but he could see Mary going over to her door, a little boy next to her, a backpack on his back, talking excitedly.
"Please, you saintly woman, you." He plopped himself in one of the kitchen chairs as she went to the coffee maker. She was still in her sleepwear, some long flannel bottoms with what looked like unicorns on them, (courtesy of Wade), and a short sleeve tee. Tony noticed that it was looking a bit loose, and knew that had lost a bit more weight from the treatments. "I'm hoping to keep it from them for as long as possible, but at least Peter will see me before he sees any reports."
Tony started to mumble Peter's name, and the man assured him that he was safe, telling him to open his eyes. "Don't want too," Tony stuttered out, fear lacing his voice. "Don't want to be back there, can't go back there, can't lose Peter."
"Yeah, I saw something on your shoulder, didn't look good." Tony moved his head back when Steve tried to move his head closer. "I wanna check your eyes, see if maybe you got a concussion."
Tony tried to swallow, tongue swiping out to try and wet his lips that suddenly felt too dry. “I’d uh, I’d like that,” he said with a nod. His own feet moved him away from the counter, a step closer to Steve. Steve stepped even closer to him, and suddenly their chests were nearly pressed together.
"Keep us updated," Steve told him, grabbing the strap as the back of the jet opened. Tony gave a sloppy salute before jumping out, the jets in his boots taking over. Steve turned back to Natasha, their comms turning on when Tony left the jet. "Do we have any other information on this group that they belong too?"
Mary had said that she warned her parents that he would be stopping by, but she took no responsibility for how they looked at him. Yeah, parents didn't usually like Tony Stark, specially old Tony Stark, before the 'incident'. Tony didn't care about what Mary's parents thought though, not when the door opened and Peter went running for him.
Tony walked out of the office and saw Steve sitting on the couch, in what was becoming his usual spot. There was a hardcover book sitting on his tight, one hand holding it open, while his other arm was down holding onto a sleeping Jamie, her head pillowed on Steve’s other leg. The secretary was always stealing looks over at Steve with his adorable mini-me, which Tony had to admit that it was one of the cutest sights. Jarvis had hundreds of pictures of these little moments on his servers thanks to Tony.
"Wilson wasn't even attempting to hide," Bucky told him, and Steve raised an eyebrow. "He still has a condo in New York, although it looked like he was getting ready to leave when I got there."
"That's all I can ask of you." She stood up, kissing the top of his head, in probably a habitual move because of Peter, and proceeded to prove him right by kissing the top of Peter's head. Tony looked back at the sleeping form of his son as Mary left quietly, shutting the door.
"That's right," Tony chuckled, heading down the hall, towards where his own, seldom used, study was. "I used to go to school with Rhodey, so we've known each other a long time. He was around when I made this room that I'm going to show you. So only Rhodey, and now you, will know about this."
“I found what room I want!” Peter called from the other end of the suit and Tony was suddenly turning on his feet and hurrying down the hall.
"Don't say stuff like that." He made a face as he looked at the diaper. "I'm getting cloth diapers tomorrow."
"And that was out of my own pure selfish need." Mary growled out. "I know Tony's past, I know the personal details, you don't-"
Tony’s nose twitched a little, and he crossed his leg over one knee. One hand slipped into his pocket, fingers wrapping around a paperclip that hadn’t been there before. Tony tried not to smile, knowing that Steve had put it there after taking his phone, knowing that Tony needed something to keep his hands busy with. “Alright, so if I go ahead and say yes to this, where are the papers we both have to sign? Like, I gotta keep myself, and all interested parties, protected. Doctor-Client privileges don’t cut it in my world. And I’m sure there’s more I have to sign? And then what do I call you?” The young woman opened the notepad in her lap, pulling out some papers. As she held them out for him to take, Tony stared at her hand for a second. “Uh, I don’t like to be handed things.”
"If you talking about the lack of alcohol, no, I have no forgotten what day it is," Tony informed her. He was going to be talking to Peter soon, and he was always very careful not to drink, the one rule of Mary's that he never broke.
Tony looked up at him, his eyes a bright blue color. "You were right, Cap. I'm not a hero." He thrust his arm forward with the scepter, firing a shot at Steve.
“It would seem that my actions over a year ago still resonate,” Loki murmured, stepping away from Steve now. “I was unaware that the connection I inadvertently created at out meeting would continue this long.” Steve thought that he actually sounded a little regretful at his words. “Strange went to help him, and now he works to keep his mind on this plane.” Steve’s eyes widened.
Steve leaned down on one knee and motioned the two boys over to him. They shuffled over, trying their hardest to look to look innocent. “We’re not telling Bucky to stop.” They boys let out a sigh of relief. “But, no more fly by night training. If you’re going to do this, we’re going to do it properly. I’m also going to talk to your mom, Wade, because it’ll make me feel better to have permission in person.”
Peter peered at Phil, not moving away from the arms that were around him though, eyes big. "Are you feeling better? I saw you get hurt and-"
True to her stubborn self, Mary was already trying to move back into a comfortable position. Tony couldn't even say anything, because he would be doing the exact same thing. He just walked in, leaned up on the bed next to her, and helped her try to slide back down without jostling her body too much.
Steve side-eyed him a little as he pulled off the gloves, then the boots and shoved them into a locker. “Do I have time to stick my sweaty body under some water?”
"So that makes him incapable of making his own decisions?" Bruce asked carefully. "And he's only about seven years younger than you, that's not much of an age difference." Tony scrunched up his face.
"How are Mary and Peter doing with all this?" Rhodey asked. He loved his little nephew, and Tony thought that he would take care of Peter if anything ever happened to Tony. He could trust Rhodey.
Steve looked at Tony. He was hiding a lot in his voice as he spoke. This wasn't an easy subject for the genius. "Since I can remember, Da-Howard always talked about you. When I was little, the stories I heard were the most amazing things I had ever heard. I wanted to go on adventures with the Captain, Bucky, and the Howling Commandos. Aunt Peggy-" Tony stopped and Steve looked at him with surprised eyes. Tony swallowed before continuing. "She told me a lot of stories when she would come over."
"Yes," Tony answered automatically. "Please, just, please be careful with what you ask." Tony wanted to control this as best he could.
Mary lounged on the couch, a couple of pillows behind her, and underneath her, watching Steve and Tony outside with Peter. The little boy was sitting on a full length lounger, at the end, listening to Steve with an intensity she had only seen applied to talks about science with Tony. Tony was laying on his own lounger next to Steve, sunglasses on, arm behind his head, and ankles crossed. Steve was sitting in the middle of his, hands and arms moving as he told his story. Phil sat down next to her and kissed her cheek.
"It sounds weird when you say it like that." Coulson narrowed his eyes a little at Tony, and he started to wrap his arm.
"Well, we want to take the high ground," Rhodey pointed up to the hills. "So let's put the biggest gun up there, on that ridge." Tony nodded and they both headed for the same direction then stopped. "Where are you going?"
"Alright, well," Obie grabbed the pizza box. "This stays with me then." Tony shrugged and let him have it, heading back for the stairs. "You mind if I come there and see what you're doing?"
person to learn about them. (They hadn’t shown up when Steve had come to retrieve his own pokemon, instead roaming the Tower to fix what they could with their abilities.)
Rachel glanced over at Tony, her expression unreadable to Steve. "You're probably right," she told Peter softly. "Let's go say hi to Mama, yeah? They say that even when people are asleep as deeply as Mama is, that they can still hear people talking to them."
"It doesn't Matter." Tony turned to look at her, then at Obie, his voice riding in volume. "We own the controlling interest in the company!" He could afford to have the stocks dip, and he could bring it right back up if they had, too.
Steve watched Tony, then moved closer when he saw the reaction to whatever Jarvis had shown him. The headline at the bottom changed from the name of the man, George Hayes, to the segment name.
"Never said I was going too," Steve replied. "I'm expecting you to help me out with that," he gave him a smile. Bucky's eyes widened a little. "That means, you're going to have to learn how to hold a baby. I know where there are two that you can practice with, I'm pretty sure you live with them."
"I already have Jarvis scanning for any bugs or tracers that you left behind." Tony's eyes narrowed a little, but not angrily.
Why couldn't he just breathe?! Why did he hurt so much? The arc reactor, it was working, wasn't it??
"Hey Mr Tony." Wade turned his head, still standing in the doorway, and shouted. "It's just Mr Tony!" He turned and left the door open for the older man.
“Of course,” his friend said, voice soft. “You two do look really happy, though.” Tony smiled, thinking the same thing as he looked at the pictures. “Do you want to send over some picture of your trip, with or without Steve, so we have something to respond with if it gets picked up?”
"Alright, let's go." Tony smiled at him, smothering his face in messy kisses, making the little boy squeal and giggle.
Wait. Allergies. Pepper was allergic to something.... Some fruit, right? Pepper had asked Jarvis to keep an emergency supply of Epipens in the house, just in case. Where were they??
"I hope it's okay that I've been picking up Peter from school lately," Steve hedged out. Tony turned his head a little towards Steve, before turning it back to look at the school playground again.
"That's right," Tony smiled at him. "They'll get the hang of it though, and we can teach them." Steve moved a little and Tony shifted to sit between him and Peter. "You were like that when you were a tiny little baby." Tony pushed Peter's nose making him giggle.
"They had a lot of items that should have been in SHIELD lock-up," Coulson said, holding the door to Bruce's lab open for Tony. Bruce glanced up from his computer and Tony put a cup of coffee in front of him. "Got away with more, and wiped their servers, those that weren't destroyed."
"My doctors are setting up in the room next to Mary's," Tony said from the back, sitting next to Steve, looking down at his phone. "The room should be all set for when we get there, and I'll transmit all information to them
"I was younger," Tony told him. "I was already in college by the time I was a teenager, so I know how hard it can be. I'm real happy he's got a friend like you."
Everyone was suited up, except for Tony. Steve had his cowl pulled down and his shield on his back, arms crossed over his chest. “Alright everyone,” Steve said, looking around at the group. “I’ve put together some scenarios to run through that should help us understand our strengths and weaknesses. I think it’s important we know this, so that no matter who answers a call out, we can put together some kind of effective strategy to adapt to whatever’s happening.” Steve motioned over towards the newcomers. “Falcon and War Machine-“
"Yeah!" Wade agreed. "I mean, we'll try our best, no promises Mr Tony," He looked up at Tony as Tony looked down at him. "It's a lot of work." Tony let out a laugh and Wade grinned.
“I can handle Peter and Wade, together, at the same time, in Disneyland,” Tony said. “I think that handling three babies, that are so close to nap time, won’t be much of a problem.”
Getting a good look at what knocked out Rhodey he saw the helmet drawing back to show Ivan Vanko, in a newly designed, clunky, and ugly, suit. Two whips dropped down, then arc with electricity, stronger than the last time, and he smirked. "Good to be back."
"I'll try my best to resist saying, 'I told you so', Sir," Jarvis said from Tony's phone in his pocket.
"Good thing you have such a good friend, huh?" Tony smiled softly at Peter, running his hand through his hair. "How about the four of us go to the kitchen, have a late night snack of some hot chocolate? Then we can all watch a movie."
"Someone has to be bank-rolling them," Tony continued. "These guys seem disorganized, jumping the gun from animal DNA to human DNA before they even know it'll work. Something tells me that they're not working alone."
Steve leaned up so he could see Tony’s face, could see how expressive it was, eyes moving until they locked on Steve’s, breath coming out of his mouth in pants. “You’re stunning, but right now,” Steve trailed off, leaning back down to catch Tony’s lips, opening his mouth with his tongue, pulling more moans from Tony.
"Tony says, what happens in the gym, stays in the gym," Steve said carefully, and it seemed that Mary caught on.
“Indoor voices,” Tony reminded him, pulling out one of the keycards. Steve caught sight of the placard outside the door that read ‘
"Mortified isn't a good look on you." Mary walked over to them, Peter in her arms. Steve followed behind. "I'm very glad to see that you managed to keep our tiny human in one piece."
"Why wouldn't the bed be safe?" Wade was still in his pajamas, but Peter wasn't with him, so he assumed that his son was still sleeping. Like Tony wanted to be.
Evelyn, as Peggy had called her, stood protectively in front of the little boy, glaring up at Howard. She remembered the older man.
"Thanks, J," Tony murmured. He got up from his seat and left the workshop, locking down the doors and decided to take the stairs, to keep moving. Upstairs he saw Mary's parents walking towards the kitchen ahead of him. Tony wondered if Peter had assigned seats again. When he was corralled into sitting next to Steve again, his question was answered.
When he walked out he had managed to change into the pants and shirt, and was slipping the black vest on. He looked at Steve and let out a whistle. “Can we just start going out as Avengers in these outfits?”
“No, you get no points, because you knew who Tony was when you started dating him.” Steve pouted a little and Mary shook her head. “Nope, nothing.” The elevators opened and Tony was the first to step out with Steve behind him. “I suppose I’ll just make sure that Peter and Wade are actually putting that stuff away?”
"It's an atom!" Tony exclaimed and Bruce blinked. "Jarvis, scan it, project it!" A hologram of the old model rose up from the physical model as Tony pulled himself up and over to the desk. He pulled out his arc reactor, and Bruce moved to pull out a fresh core for him. In the almost three months that Bruce had been at the Manor with Tony they had fallen into a routine with the reactor. Bruce would study the decay of the cores to see how fast they were depleting, and adjust the chlorophyll intake with Jarvis.
"I like to think that I'm a lot more comfortable than a wooden chair," Tony said with a smile. Peter leaned back against Tony's chest, as if proving the point. After that pancakes were passed around, Steve getting the first helping, Peter taking more than he could eat, but Tony assured Mary that he would eat the rest, since the boy was in his lap.
"Tony, the board has rights, too," Obie tried to argue. "They's making the case, that you and your new direction, isn't in the company's best interest."
"Didn't think you'd want to talk about them," Steve replied. "If what Loki says is true, and you're feeling pretty lightweight, then you have a lot you don't say."
"Yeah, but one of them has your name, oh right, and they're your godchildren." He swore he heard the little smirk in her voice.
“Yeah, but this isn’t the same suit that I remember seeing,” Steve pointed out. “This specifically isn’t the suit that you’ve been using on call outs.” He started to walk over to the suit and Tony jumped up, grabbing onto his hand.
"No tips?" Steve shot at him. As soon as he got one foot in, Jamie was taking it out as he moved to the next foot.
Steve pulled him back in for a kiss, moaning softly when he felt Tony’s tongue tracing his bottom lip. “Tony-“
What to look forward too in the next story? More fluff, more Tony and Steve interacting, and actually getting some where, more Angst, and Captain America 2. Dun Dun Dun. And of course more Peter! Peter growing up and aging.
He stopped just in front of the couch, then slowly started to rise up, much like a bad horror movie haunt. Wade froze though when he came up high enough and saw two blue eyes looking right at him, his own eyes widening.
Tony made his way upstairs not long after, no longer laughing, and smiled when he smelled the delicious scent of blueberry pancakes. He could hear Jamie making delighted sounds and saw Peter and Wade sitting in front of her. “How goes the birthday lesson, boys?” Tony asked, leaning against the back of the couch. Jamie smiled and cooed when she saw him.
"I don't know where the hell I'm going," she said quickly. "I'm from Michigan, not even one of the big cities! We're asshole drivers, not experts on traffic. I barely know my way around Philadelphia yet!"
"My teacher's tell my Mom I'm a handful." It seemed to Tony that Wade enjoyed that. "She says I'm special."
Steve shrugged a little, bobbing his head back and forth. “A little. It was good to get out, see things for myself, and not part of any kind of mission.”
"The Expo will draw attention from anything that might happen, or be happening." Fury had contacted Coulson directly. Something was happening at their facility that held the Tesseract, and he asked Coulson to get someone to go with him. Maria Hill was already there. Coulson would have gone himself, but Fury said that he wanted him here to hold down the New York office. The next best person would be Mary, of course.
Tony jumped up from his roll, reaching forward to get past the shield at the same time that Steve was lunging towards Tony. With incredible aim, Tony managed to get the nozzle shoved between the neck of Steve's uniform and his skin, setting the lock to make a continuous stream of water. At the same time Steve had managed to reach with his own hose, shoving the nozzle between Tony's hip and the belt of his pants, also setting the lock. Both men yelped loudly, (very manly, not at all high pitched), and jumped back, Steve dropping his shield, as they both grappled for the hoses. It wasn't until they were able to get the water to stop that they realized there was clapping, cheering, and laughing around them.
"Where's Bruce?" Steve asked him. "And I thought Romanoff and Barton were going to be staying at the Tower this week."
"Fine, but you said silent. So, give me the food and get in here." Steve's smile got a little bigger and he handed over the plate and mug before sliding in before Tony could change his mind. He grumbled a little, but the food was smelling very good. Steve walked to the side, sliding onto the ratty couch that Tony kept down there. Steve picked up a Starkpad by the couch and started scrolling through it, probably looking through the movies.
"Hopped up on some painkillers," Tony told him. "I had Bruce give me a shot before I left. It works wonders when Peter wanted to be carried." He leaned back in his chair now, trying to relax a little. "Where has Clint been anyway? We hadn't heard from him after everything went down in DC."
“Probably just going to sit here until either she comes back to her sense, or you guys figure out how to snap her out of it,” Mary told him. “Just focus on getting Jarvis back up and helping out Steve. I don’t like the idea of Wade being close to anything Hydra related.”
Tony had pulled on a fresh pair of sweats, and had a plain tee waiting while he worked on fixing his beard. He may have been feeling his best, but that didn't mean that he wanted to look like a homeless man. Another ping from his phone, and he glanced down, pulling the straight razor away from his face.
"You're both going to be the death of me. Fine, okay, we'll go!" Mary shook her head, smiling a little as Peter whooped, hugging Tony. He didn't even know what was going on, but all he knew was that he was going to some place with his Mama and Daddy, all for Daddy's birthday.
As the front door opened Tony sniffed the air and smiled. "You all play dirty, that's the smell of good coffee." His feet brought him to the kitchen first. "What is the baby Mama doing up in the kitchen?" He asked as Meg handed him a mug.
"It's his M.O. isn't it?" Bruce looked around at them. Tony looked at him, something feeling off, but he just couldn't put a finger on it. "I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no," he shook his head. "We're a chemical mixture, we're a time bomb."
It was the sound of soft whispers that greeted Tony back to consciousness. He was on something soft, so he figured it had to have been his bed, and his brain was working to catch up with what had happened. Why shouldn't he be in his bed? He had been sleeping right?
"I am just battle weary, but nothing that will not heal," Thor said, nodding. "But, I think that you did not come to inquire about my health."
Yinsen, that was the man that had saved his life, he was nice. As nice as could be for someone who was also being held captive. The man also had a suit on, and a little part of Tony missed his own suits from back home. Tony worked better without a suit though, clothes that could easily get dirty. But the man had hit a nerve while they were playing their game.
Tony watched the egg, waiting until the shell finally broke away. There was a little Flareon, just like the others, but she was smaller than the others. Vee was there, licking her head a couple of times before Tony reached forward, gently picking her up. “Hello, Ruby.”
"Good move." Bad move, Tony wanted to shout. No move is bad move! He registered Captain America's movement to his side.
“Is the same power source to your amulet,” Loki said with a wave of his hand to the artifact around his neck. Strange’s eyes widened slightly, then he turned to look at Steve.
"My radio's on, Sir," she told him, nodding. She knew that Fury wouldn't tell her sit out just because Coulson was sweet on her, or because she had a son; he knew that she was as good as, if not better, than most of the SHIELD agents he had.
"Tony Stark, have you settled down?" Bruce asked, and Tony launched himself for a trash can, pretending to wretch.
"Thanks little man. Is that plate supposed to be mine?" Tony held onto Peter, motioning to a plate that was sitting on the island counter, a few stools already set in place.
"Heaven forbid you and Wade should not go to the same school," Mary said, taking her key out to open the door to the apartment. Peter pushed the door open, smiling up at her, before taking off his jacket. "You can just put those bags on the table, Steve, thanks."
"He’s one step away from a dishonorable discharge himself with the allegations behind the divorce." Tony set Jamie in his lap, pulling his legs up around her. "The military doesn't like it when one of their higher ranking Officers comes back with abuse charges against a spouse and child." He lifted his head a little to look at Steve. "And I'm not convinced that Wade isn't in his cross hairs, too. I did have lawyers send over papers stating that his parental rights to Wade had been terminated, he's probably pretty mad."
“This on ‘On your left’ guy??” Tony asked, then flashed a smile at Sam. “Seriously, how many times did he lap you?”
“Steve.” The blonde twisted in the water, feeling his cowl slip off of his head, and he saw Tony in the water, without the suit, arc reactor a ghostly blue in the water. He tried to swim towards Tony, reaching out to try and grab onto him. Tony’s face was pale, dark circles under his eyes- his blue eyes. “You said you would keep me safe, that you would stop them from getting me.”
“Don’t ruin it,” Tony said with a wave of his hand, looking back down at Jamie. “Yes, Aunt Meg has good ideas sometimes, but she just needs to let Daddy have the glory. Because Daddy is amazing. Daddy.”
There were sparks and the sound of an explosions behind them, Stane on the war path. The were out the door, Stane getting stuck on the concrete behind them, and they were headed towards the cars. "Get in the car!" She shouted to Pepper. "Get out of here!"
"I was so hoping you would try something." Tony turns a glare up at the man that is standing over him. "Come now, I will give you a tour of where you will be working from now on. Hydra is pleased to welcome you to our ranks."
"Daddy," Peter's lip wibbled and threw himself against Tony. Tony wrapped his arms around his tightly, kissing the top of his head, rubbing his back, sussing softly.
“My precious little gumdrop!” Tony cooed as he picked up the little girl from the floor. “Were you enjoying your time with Uncle Bucky Bear?” Bucky growled lowly as he pushed himself up from the floor, where he had been playing with Jamie. “Yes, Buckaroo is a funny man, isn’t he?” Steve pressed his lips together when Bucky shot him a glare. “But, it’s alright, because Daddy is back now!”
"No, he does love his food," Tony agreed. "I'm making sure to put chimichangas on the list." Julie laughed. "Seriously, that is a weird favorite food."
“Told I missed a hell of a view,” Tony murmured against Steve. “Was out for most of it, but Goldilocks took me to Asgard for a quick check-up. I’m fine, just tired.” Steve kissed Tony’s head, eyes shifting to look at Thor, who gave a nod to confirm Tony’s words.
"See! Horrible!" Tony looked at his reflection, eyes still red, but not as puffy. He could hide it, but he knew that William and Rachel wouldn't call him out on it either. "Why do I put up with you?"
"They would have taken them, trained them to be killers," he growled. He was about to say more, but his head moved just enough, and Steve heard what he did. Footsteps coming. Bucky grabbed Steve's shirt and threw him into the bathroom, stepped in with him and closed the door silently as the nurse walked into the room.
Bucky’s eyes slid over when Steve nodded towards another group of three, two men and a woman. “There’s Mr Jones, he’s one the office staff. He’s talking to Mr and Mrs Dornier, whose three kids all attend school here. Mr Dornier is looking for a new job, because he works a night shift, and his wife works school hours for a Doctor’s office. They want more time to spend with their kids, and with each other. Mr Jones might have a lead for them in the school system.”
Meg snorted a little. "I have my hands full already." There was a knock at the front door and the three looked over. "Excuse me a second, it's probably just my neighbor checking on me." She walked towards the front of the house, which Tony and Steve both noted that it didn't take long in the small house. She grabbed a jacket before opening the door, and another voice was heard.
"I think there's going to be a lot in there," Tony said quietly. Tony wasn't exactly looking forward to it.
“It feels like every time you talk I still have the urge to hurt you, and I’m left with still more questions.”
“All my teachers kept saying that I had a natural talent, so I kept moving up in classes,” she said, looking between all of them. “My Aunt always paid for the classes…. Oh. I think I see where you’re going with this.” Tony nodded a couple times. “But, she always told me that they were for self-defense. I didn’t participate in any tournaments, didn’t win any awards or anything.”
"He likes having shorter hair," Steve agreed. "Mary put something in his hair to get it spiked up, like yours usually is," he said nodding to Tony, "and he kept asking for that the rest of the week."
“Are those her first words?” Wade asked carefully, sneaking his own tuft over to Jamie. Her little hands latched onto his fingers as tried to shove the cotton candy into her mouth.
Tony stole another kiss before leaning back a little, pushing himself up to his feet. “I love you, baby, but you’re going to have to get up now. I sent Peter off on a mission, and we shouldn’t keep him waiting.” He extended his arm to Steve to help him up. “You don’t have to let go of the little heartbreaker, but you do have to get up.”
"Meg had the twins," he said, running his hand through Tony's hair. He could still smell the embers from the welding machine of Tony's workshop in his hair, he must have been working in there before all the excitement.
“You’d do a better job at it,” Steve said right back. His hand settled on Tony’s back, warm and secure. “Tony, how many suits do you have?”
"He helps her, gives her medicine to try and make her feel better." Tony handed Peter his cocoa, then handed a mug to Wade, who took a drink right away. "This is really good!"
"Hey, Rachel," Tony said, taking a seat on the edge of the bed. "Is everything all right? Nothing happened with the boys, did it?"
“She also comes to spend time with you,” Steve said softly, almost like he was asking permission for something. “Would that be alright, too? If I spent more time with you? Maybe to get too know you?”
Mary opened her mouth to comment, but her phone started to ring. "Keep me updated on party details," she said as she pulled out her phone, looking at the caller ID. "I have to go into the office apparently. Try not to break anything."
"Let's be sure to send her a fruit basket, because actually humans like Peter,a nd myself, need to eat food." Rhodey rolled his eyes a little at Tony's snort. "Did Mary give you a list of things that Peter's allergic too, or foods that he doesn't like right now?" After a few moments of silence, Rhodey looked back to see Tony's slightly panicked expression. "You don't remember do you?"
"At least you were there," Steve told him. "You could have given up altogether." Tony hummed and nodded a little. "Then, I guess we learn together, on a lot of things."
Meg looked at Steve for a second, probably trying to decide if it was a good idea. Steve couldn't blame her, and he was a little glad that she was thinking about it, using some common sense. "You know what, why not. I can already hear about three of my friends in my head, saying that this is probably too impulsive, but it sucks eating alone."
"Why don't you like to be handed stuff?" Steve asked, not really paying attention to Tony's train of thought. His mind, and words, traveled faster than Steve could even think to keep up. "Must make it hard to run a company."
Tony reached up a shaky hand, thumb wiping away the tear that slid down Steve's face, feeling a bit confused. Steve grasped his wrist, pressing a small kiss to his palm. "You have your family here, Tony. You have others willing to help you through this."
“And he’s going to be like this until the scepter is found?” Steve was sure he managed to keep the note of hysteria from his voice. “He can’t stay like this! What am I supposed to tell our kids??”
"Then Saturday night we'd better have a fantastic goodbye," Tony mumbled with a smile, eyes slipping shut again.
"Hi, Mr Steve!" Peter said as he came over, having opened all the windows. Tony could tell cause there was a slight chill coming inside from the cold weather outside. "Daddy burned some of the cupcakes." Tony's expression deadpanned, but Steve wouldn't see it because of the sunglasses. "But, it's alright, because we bought a couple extra boxes."
"Yeah, and I would take the blame on that, but not all my fault now is it?" Tony smirked a little at the exasperated sigh. "That's right, when my beloved Science Bro decides to go AWOL without telling me how to contact him, I decide to take only, mmmm, Twelve Percent of the blame."
"Mary?" Steve thought that maybe he could put a voice to this mysterious Tony, but the voice that he heard was shaken, sounding vulnerable.
Mary reached her arms up, putting her hands on his cheeks. “What we’re going to do is wait for Strange to get his shit together.” This was the SHIELD Agent coming out, Steve could handle this. “We’re going to tell Peter and Jamie that Tony is sick right now and that he needs rest. We’re not going to let them see him, not right now. Jarvis is going to keep an eye on Tony, because we still have to plan Peter’s birthday party. We’re not going to let this stop that.” Steve let out a slow sigh and Mary lifted his head back up. “Don’t you start dropping on me, Captain. You’ve dealt with bigger things than this and come out on the other side.”
He had never seen Colonel Wilson in person, only in pictures, but he knew that the body on the floor was no doubt the same man. It was the small pool of blood starting to form that made something clench in his gut, and his eyes drifted over to the side, then he was moving in the room. “Wade?” He called out softly.
"Too busy taking down Nazi's to really enjoy the sights?" Tony asked, leaning past Steve to grab Peter's favorite juice.
"Good luck with that one," Steve told him. "I told her she's on her own with that one, I'm gonna stick to one series at a time."
“If that were true don’t you think he would have said something before going off to that plane?” Peggy shot back. “There was no way that he would have let any of his companions be stuck like that, even if he wasn’t going to take them with him.” Tony glanced down at Vee. “I don’t think he took Brave and Arc by choice either. He knew the risks and he never would have put them in danger like that.”
“To the car,” Steve told them, stepping closer to Peter. “Thanks, Izzie, we gotta go.” Bucky was picking up Peter and they were running back to the car. Bucky was looking around, his eyes scanning every person he could see. “Jarvis? Jarvis can you hear me?” The line was all static now.
Tony wasn't sure what he was expecting, but suddenly he was thrown into buried memories. The blue power from the scepter was wrapping around him again and he gasped for air, words and whispers sounding loud to his ears. He was reliving nightmares, the feeling of a hand with too many fingers grabbing him, holding him down. The missile headed for the Chitauri ship, the iciness of space wrapping around him again.
Tony flinched when fingers gently dragged across his cheeks. “Get us closer,” the voice whispered, hot and uncomfortable on the skin of his ear. “Lead us.”
“Soooo, if it’s my birthday, then does that mean I get to listen to whatever music that I want?” Steve asked with a smirk, pulling his phone back up. Tony groaned loudly as another song was added to Steve’s, in his opinion, horrendous playlist.
Something about Peter had said, about his Dad's schooling, it struck a chord in Steve. It was odd, but it was something he had recently read, wasn't it? Now Steve needed to get back to his apartment. He could just be overreacting, or perhaps there was something about the puzzle of Peter's Dad that was slotting into place.
“You had me worried for a second.” Tony leaned over Jamie a little to kiss Steve. “But, I was thinking that we could do that whole, normal, thing you wanted to do.”
"Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a weapons depot that was just blown up a few clicks from where you were being held captive," Rhodey said. So they did see his handy work then.
“Uh, no, that’s- No, I mean- I’m not sexist,” Tony rushed out, tripping over his words. She merely chuckled softly. “No, it definitely doesn’t have to do with your gender, or even your age. Really it has nothing to with you, at all.”
"Yeah, it's a different model, buddy," Tony nodded. From the corner of his eye he saw Peter's grandparents walk into the room with Peter's bag. They were eyeing him up, judging if he was good enough for their daughter, and their grandson. He shifted Peter to his hip and took a step forward, hat and sunglasses already off, and extended his hand to the two elderly people. "It's a pleasure to meet you, I'm Tony St-"
Steve froze for a second, looking over at Tony. The only kind of sign he could get was the little head tilt, other than that Tony’s face was blank. He wasn’t sure if he had made a mistake or not, and he wasn’t getting any clues from the man in front of him. It was also the first time he had ever heard Tony refer to her as Aunt. “Um, yes. I hope that was alright.” Steve’s face flushed a little when it hit him. “Oh! Oh, tony, I’m sorry! She hadn’t met any of the girls before. You probably wanted to do that! I’m sorry, Tony!”
"Because you can't do violence!" Rachel shouted at him. "Everyone in this house could kick your ass."
Steve could feel Tony watching him as he made the store bought frosting a bit more fluffier, lighter, and ready for the cooking cupcakes. He turned a little, scooping the frosting into plastic bags, (something he had seen in a video on the internet), and looked at Tony. "I thought that this might make frosting the cupcakes easier. Do you know what they're supposed to look like?" Peter had been given the duty of decorating the container that would hold the cupcakes, and was out at the table again.
Bucky moved to help Tony and Natasha was there to stop him from getting closer, guns holstered as she used her own martial training.
"And was it easy for Mr Fitzpatrick when he came back home? Did he fall back into a normal civilian routine?" Rachel looked at Steve, looking like she was going to refute his words, then her expression changed with understanding. "I don't know what Tony saw when he got rid of the missile, but he did not come back unscathed. All people deal with their stress and fears in different ways, and I'm not sure how it works with Tony, but he needs support as well. He's used to having Mary around to help him with parenting, and going to her for help. Tony was right, it wasn't his fault what happened to Mary, but we did catch the one that was responsible, and now we just have to wait for her to wake up. Take care of her, and Peter, that's all that we can ask you and your husband to do. We'll do the rest."
“Alright, we’re gonna try and sneak away, okay?” He said as he started to unbuckled Jamie from her seat. As he moved to lift her out something grasped his ankle and he was pulled back and out the front door. He let out a shout when the front of his head bounced against the center dash, cries of his name ringing in his ears.
Starting the F1 vehicle was nothing, he checked the screen the technicians were showing him, and nodded. He was Tony Stark, he already knew how this vehicle would perform, and he knew how he could get it over the finish line, preferably in first place. He was supposed to be watching the race with his son, but they had the rest of the weekend as well. The vibration of the vehicle all around him felt amazing, gave him a rush almost like the Iron Man suit, but it was different. He could practically feel Pepper's anger with him now, but this was his birthday, it was his time, with his family.... Possibly his last.
"I can make something small," Tony said with confidence, still looking ahead. "And if they already have some ideas, well," he shrugged a little, "it's no secret the Stark name has a lot of money. Couldn't think of something more worthwhile to throw money at." They both looked over to couch, seeing Coulson with his arm around Mary's shoulders, Peter's head bobbing up between them as he marveled at the fireworks. Steve moved a little closer, their shoulders almost touching, looking back up at the sky.
He stumbled forward a step and Bruce caught his arm, looking at him expectantly. Tony gave him a smile. "Feeling like a new man, Brucie-bear." Bruce smiled back at him, nodding.
“You can’t look at it like that,” Steve said, but he didn’t have his usual optimism in his voice. “You need to have a little bit of faith.” Tony shot him a look, and Steve almost winced. “I know.”
"I'm dropping you off with Fury," she said, walking back up towards the front. "I have another stop to make." Natasha glanced at him. "Good job, Stark didn't recognize you at all." Steve grunted a little. He put the shield down, taking a seat, and blinked when Natasha handed him a tablet.
"It was easier," she said shrugging, moving to the co-pilot seat besides Clint. "We didn't want to move him to another bed, it was faster this way as well."
"Little funny," Steve said with an easy smile. Tony rubbed at his chest a little, feeling a bloom of warmth.
"Preliminary results show that there is nothing wrong," Jarvis informed him. "I would suggest something for nausea, but I will continue to monitor your condition, Sir."
"I will keep you informed, Captain Rogers," the AI said as if he could read Steve's thoughts. "I would like to recommend that you also get some rest. Night is approaching and I believe that it will be troublesome to find a time to rest coming morning."
“It was a couple weeks ago.” Tony sat back, one arm on the back of the couch. “If they don’t need all of the Avengers then one of us will usually stay back with the kids. They were going for something a little more stealthy, I think, so Cap went.”
"Seriously, don't worry about it," Steve told her, but looked at Coulson as he spoke, too. "Fireworks are coming soon, and we celebrated most of the day. That's more than I'm used, too. Seriously, this needs to be celebrated. I'll go help with desserts, in fact."
"He's having a flashback," Mary's father said curtly to his wife. "He's not alright, and we can't let Peter see him like that either." The woman huffed a little, but didn't say anything else.
“I promise to give you a much more memorable shower later this week.” Tony smirked, leaning against the doorway between the bathroom and bedroom. Steve sauntered over, deliberately slow, black jeans hanging on his hips and shirtless. “I think you’re good like this,” Tony said, making a show of ogling his body. “You’re even barefoot, that should be illegal how good you look barefoot.” Steve rolled his eyes, smiling at him. “Yeah, you can go to dinner with us looking just like this.”
"I've got some fresh apples in the pantry." Tony nodded towards the direction of the kitchen. "And some cinnamon, too. Should be a good time." Tony tried to hide a yawn, but Mary was staring right at him as he did it. "I'm fine."
"Dancing's not a fan of me," Steve replied, looking at Tony now. "Never could get it down, two left feet and all that."
Steve leaned over the phone, picking it up to look at it. The song changed again and Steve raised his eyebrow. "Okay, that's the original Paint It Black, not the cover. Usually phones aren't able to play songs on their own, and like no one is able to hack Starktech, at least not new models."
When Mary didn't answer, he looked over to see her hand over his mouth, but her eyes were sparkling. "That's because those were his first steps, Tony."
“Don’t!” Tony shouted as he moved backwards away from everyone. “Fuck!” He turned and practically ran from the room and down the hall. Steve looked over at the others, and it was Rhodey’s eyes that he caught. There was a slight nod, and Steve was turning to follow the genius. Rhodey would take care of the now unwelcome guests in the Penthouse.
"We all know that's not going to stick," Tony said, wiping the tears from his eyes. "You're the only Doc that I trust with my life." Tony grinned at the look that Bruce shot him. Tony made himself comfortable on the bed while Bruce did what he needed to do with Mary. He eventually took the breathing mask off, and Tony moved to help get her sitting up in the bed.
“What exactly brings you to the Tower, Strange?” Natasha asked. She may have been dressed in her civvies, but she still exuded assassin.
Peggy stepped up to Tony, kneeling down to his height, and taking his hands gently. “Tell me what you saw, Tony,” she said gently with a smile. Evelyn looked between Peggy and Tony, before sitting down, sensing no threat.
"Rhodey was there," Tony said, pulling out of her arms, but not away from her. He couldn't look her in the eyes though, not yet. "He pulled me out of that hell hole, he saw me-" Tony clenched his jaw shut. "Rhodey knew most of it anyway, so I just filled in the details for him, asked him to keep it out of official reports. Even he was turning green at what happened, and he's seen action! How could I tell that to anyone else?? I still want to be able to look people in the eye at the end of the day!"
Steve had more research to do, he had to be certain on his thoughts, and not that he was jumping to conclusions.
"Who was your friend when you were in school?" Wade asked with all the innocence of a child. He was assuming that he and Peter had the exact same experiences in school.
Steve had jumped from his bed, running to the door when he heard Jarvis call his name. He saw the door to Peter's bedroom open, then saw Tony stumble out, falling to the floor. His eyes were wide, pupils were blown, and he was hyperventilating. An older man was rushing down the hall, kneeling front of Tony and Steve blinked. There was a woman in the doorway to Peter's room, watching Tony with wide, but hard, eyes.
“That’s a load off of our shoulders, but be sure to come to us if you do end up reading something you’re not sure about. But, Tony has been seeing a therapist for, well, almost two years now.”
"Get things straightened out," he said, turning back to the arm on the work table. "I'll still be down here." Steve didn't move for a second, then he nodded and took a step back. "Door'll be open, you won't need to use your code again," Tony commented. And then quieter, that his enhanced hearing almost didn't pick it up; "Didn't need to the first time." Steve closed his eyes for a second and headed for the door. He so owed Tony for this, he had to make it up to him.
"Did you really think he wasn't going to come?" He asked, pulling the hood of his jacket up when it started to snow again.
“Yeah, it’s not as muffled as it could be, but it’s warm here, and I’m gonna suffer heatstroke for the sake of wearing three shirts.” Tony was glad to see that no one had connected Steve with Captain America yet, the beard and dark sunglasses going far to help with that. Although, those that were convinced that it was him in the park was frothing at the bit to find out who the mysterious man was. “No one’s really bothered us so far, so I’m gonna take that as a good sign.”
"Yeah, I saw the exhibit," Steve said, still holding onto the tags. "They had a lot of originals as well." Tony waved a hand towards the empty displays. "All that came from here?"
"Tony!" Tony's eyes widened and he blinked, a sharp pain on his cheek. "Can you hear me now?" He nodded once. Natasha gently turned his head back to look at him. "She's alive." He frowned. "They didn't kill Meg, she's alive." Tony didn't think it was possible, but his body slumped more. Lost all form was more like it, sliding down on the floor, but in relief this time.
"So, she hasn't calmed down then." Steve felt bad for Tony. He shouldn't judge, but the only interactions he's had with the woman were her putting down Tony. Steve had already done that, and he felt bad about it, Tony didn't need that from the Grandmother of his son.
For the first time in a long time, Steve could breath in the summer air without worrying about not being able to breathe. Steve would be able to watch the fireworks without fear of being caught somewhere that he wasn't supposed to be, (because Bucky just looked for the best spot, not for permission.) Mary had told him that if he looked out towards the water, towards the Bridge to Manhattan, and he would see the best fireworks. She had told him that Central Park, or Times Square would have the best fireworks, but Steve didn't want to break a tradition, something he could hold onto here in this new time, and she smiled and gave him a lawn chair from the storage shed in the back.
“You could have just said Peter and Wade,” Tony told him. “With all their training,” he said, eyeing Steve a little. “They’re going to be practicing that everywhere.” He gently started to rock his leg up and down with Jamie sitting on it, hand around her side. “Anyway, I’m spending too much time locked away in some windowless room, and I figured we could go out and get all the furniture bought. We can take Wade with us, and then just, make a day of it.”
"That's what I figured." Tony reached out to ruffle Wade's short hair. "Don't listen to what the teacher's say about you kid. If I thought that way about you, I wouldn't let you in my home all the time."
“And now?” Mary asked. “I don’t see Steve around here, and Phil wouldn’t tell me where was, said that you would know.”
Tony woke up to something pawing at his nose, and a high pitched noise in his ears. “Sir, I must insist that you wake up now.” Tony groaned a little when he heard Jarvis’s voice. His eye popped open and he saw Vee in front of his face, pacing back and forth. Her tail was swishing wildly, and she was hyperactive about something. She batted at his nose again and he grunted.
Tony dropped his head down a little. "Snuck this bottle up here a while ago, after you left to DC. Don't know why I did it, but I knew it was easier. Peter was in school a lot, staying down at Mary's more often than not, I was either here or in the workshop and couldn't exactly leave the Tower. Only person who would really come up here would be Pepper to get some signatures, and that's easy enough to avoid if I needed too." His eyes flickered over to the side when Steve's thumb started to rub his knuckles. "My liver is still pretty shit. I once spent an entire week, seven full days, drunk. I mean, just constantly drinking, keeping that feeling going, never sleeping longer than two hours so I could keep having drink after drink."
"Yeah, he'll be good," Tony nodded, grabbing his tablet from the coffee table. "He's a resilient little guy."
"-Daddy said that he could do it. Miss Pepper wasn't happy, but she wasn't mad at him." Mary pushed the door open, ruffling the little boys hair and they disappeared inside. Knowing that it would only be a few minutes until Mary came over, Steve grabbed his shoes, and the keychain that had the keys to this apartment on them. He had changed into a plain white t-shirt, underneath a blue sweater, the sleeves pushed up, but he had kept his khaki pants on. Steve decided that still going over there would still be a good idea, besides if he was going to be spending time with Mary, it wouldn't be a bad idea to meet her son. Steve had always had an affinity for children, hoping to have some when he was older.
The damage had done more internally and there was blood on Vanko's lips. He laughed and Tony suddenly heard a beeping. "You still lose, Stark." Tony frowned.
"I told you, I'm not involved that anything that might have to do with you, unless you're directly involved as well. It just doesn't seem right." He heard Mary give a little sigh and he nodded. "I'll see what I can do."
"We'll get your boys back," Sam said as he sat up in the chair. "Both of them." Steve gave him a grateful smile and nodded. "But, we're not doing anything until the morning. Unless your super intelligent AI wakes us up."
"Forty-one steps straight ahead," Tony started to say. They'd been over for days now. "Then sixteen steps, that's from the door." This was the map that they would use to get out, this was Tony's map to get back to Peter. When they were out Tony would pay to have Yinsen's family moved to wherever he wanted, he'd get them a nice house, a car, whatever he wanted. "Fork right, thirty-three steps, turn right."
"Well, since you stole him from my basement laboratory, I guess it only right that I steal him back." Tony's words gave Steve pause. Tony already knew Dr Banner?
Tony found himself being pushed towards the door of the workshop, William behind him. "We'll work on a plan for you later," the older man was telling him. "But right now, your Doctor friend is making breakfast, and Peter is up there waiting for his Daddy."
"So, it's the end of February, Twenty Eleven, but I'm sure that Jarvis will have marked that in the file. This is, kind of a last minute decision, and since I'm basically talking to myself down here, it's kind of weird, and irking me out a little." Tony gave a little chuckled, looking down at his hands. "It's easier with an audience, because all you have to do shower them with pretty words, shiny things, and put on a show, but that's not what I'm doing down here." Tony looked up at the screen. "Right now, you're six, Peter, and you're upstairs with who I hope becomes one of your favorite Uncles, right next to Rhodey, Uncle Bruce. He's a Science Bro, and he'll be able to teach you so much more than I could, or can, depends on how this goes. I've been down here int he workshop going through some my Dad's old stuff, and for once he touched on an idea that could have possibly meant more, but I'm gonna take his idea. Recording myself, all the things that I hope I've said to you, and all the things that I might not have been able to say to you, hopefully yet."
"Don't worry about it big guy, well, at least about the Tower," Tony said with a shrug. "So, it's possible to adjust Loki's pretty bracelets, right?" Thor tilted his head in question. "I have a way to contain him, and it'll work best if I'm able to put a thin cuff around one wrist, and I thought we could hide it under his own shackles, so it's harder for him to try and get off."
Mary gasped dramatically, putting her hand over her mouth. "The amazing Agent Phil Coulson doesn't have information? Someone alert the Director! We have to shut down SHIELD!" She laughed when Coulson poked her side. "Careful, I'm your delicate fiancé."
"We've been working on sharing," Mary told him, pouring some juice for herself. "Getting him ready for school."
"Then why fight it?" Mary asked with a shrug. "Just come on over, take a seat, we'll talk and get this over with." Tony dropped his head back and made his best impression of a whale. "What are you, ten? That's not going to work on me. Get over here." Tony let out a loud sigh and went over, dragging his feet a little, and practically threw himself on the couch. Tony and Peter were too much alike.
"Without it, the reactor doesn't work," Tony replied back, taking a second to lean back in the chair. His chest was feeling better, and the drink was helping to clear his dizziness. "I'm working on it, but I wouldn't be too concerned."
"I know! It's gross when old people kiss!" Clint had slipped in the room and nabbed Peter around the waist, spinning them around once. "It's like they're eating each other’s faces!"
"Remember when Bruce and I said that AIM had been working on cloning?" Steve nodded at Tony's question. "Good, that makes this a hell of a lot easier. Steve, that's your little baby clone." Steve stared at him in silence, barely blinking.
“Plan on it,” Tony nodded. “You’re an angel, Pep. But I’m going to get back to three of my favorite people now….. Because Peter decides to buy the entire Lego store.”
“He went into the kitchen with Uncle Bucky,” he told him, and they’re attention was turned back to Jamie. Tony let out a little giggle and headed towards the kitchen.
"What's gonna happen? I can't stay at home if Mama isn't there." Tony dropped little kisses on top of Peter's head.
Tony charged up the repulsors and launched a shot in the middle of the group, trying to scatter them. It seems that the black clothing was not just fashion trend, but some kind of armor. "Really, black is not that great anymore, people, start picking different colors." He dodged another bullet and fired another shot into the group. This one came close to hitting one of them, and they hopped back. When he saw Natasha jump on one of them and bring them down with her dangerous thighs, and Cap right behind her, he safely turned his attention back to the device.
"Go ahead and bring that over here." He motioned to Steve. "Let the engineer fix this." Steve walked over with the pool noodles, his first attempt already starting to unravel. "Wet noodles are the worst." Tony shot Steve a little smirk, and brought the water toys up into his lap. Steve rolled his eyes a little, but Tony could see the smirk at his lips.
"Yes, that's exactly what I want you to do!" Mary said over Peter's laughing. "See, now it's not stuck to your leg anymore."
Tony's phone buzzed from the table, and he reached over to grab after letting out a breath. He looked at it and saw that it was the satellite phone he had given to Wade's mom. He caught Steve's attention, pointed to the phone, then the door. The blonde nodded, and went back to his pool noodle battle against Peter and Wade. Tony stepped just outside the door and answered the phone.
Mary's husband, he would have been Dad. If he were still alive, Pete would probably be his. Mary wouldn't have walked into that bar, and she wouldn't have gone home with him, both of them drunk for two different reasons.
Tony nodded to Coulson, who walked over to him. He took the forceps from Tony's fingers, looking at his arm. "Looks like you guys had some fun."
There were the twin whistles from the pool room, signaling the end of swim time. The party was coming to an end, and Tony wanted to make sure that there would be enough time to hose the kids off of the pool water and get them dry. He wandered over to where several hoses were set up and turned on the water. Peter and Wade had been some of the ones in the pool. Tony grinned, grabbing a hose in each hand. He caught Steve's eyes, who was shaking his head at him, but still smiling.
"Just because I brought pizza back from New York, doesn't mean it went bad," Obie said, still playing the piano. Tony snorted a little, grabbing a piece of pizza, as Obie decided now was the time to get up. "It would have gone better if you were there."
Tony put his hat and sunglasses on the little table in the entryway, and he and Peter both took off their shoes. Tony could wait a few hours before he needed anything from the Manor. "Alright, little man," Tony said as Peter put his backpack by the closet. "Why'd you want to stay here?" He picked up Peter, making him squeal, and dropped on the couch, bringing Peter into his lap.
“There’s a lot of different Christian ideals,” Steve told him. “I’m a Protestant,” he said with a shrug. “I’ve got different ideals than most others, including the Pope.”
"Someone just rammed the car! Shit, my classes didn't teach me how to handle this!" There was another crunching sound. "They don't prepare you for this in Driver's Ed either, and I've really only been in one accident my whole life, and that was-" The call dropped.
"You haven't seen the pictures from the Nineties," Tony warned him. Peter and Wade were waiting by the door where they knew Mary was getting ready. He leaned over the boys, and knocked twice. "Announcing four handsome men to see Ms Mary Parker one last time before she becomes something else!" Steve elbowed Tony gently, but he just grinned.
Steve jerked a little when something punched his shoulder. "I said, No Tony Stark." Steve smiled at Meg, pulling his gloves back on before grabbing the shovel again. This was the third time he had shoveled the driveway at her house, and he was half tempted to ask Tony to order a snow blower for her on his way over.
"Oh, gods, it worked!" She breathed out. "Do you know how hard it is to try and find songs that will try and get out a message? And then hope that it actually works? I mean, there was probably at least a seventy percent chance that my idea wasn't going to work, even though I know that your mind puts together a hundred different choices a minute, and you mess with his music all the time, and how else was I supposed to try and contact you on the DL-"
"He was following you last week, and he was following us two days ago," Steve told her, and her face paled a little.
"Glad to know I wasn't the only one who noticed it." Steve crossed his arms over his chest, watching Coulson grab a corsage from the desk. "Although it certainly made being stuck in the Tower interesting, while trying to avoid cameras."
Steve was searching through ebay, (with Jarvis's help), looking for some replacement Captain America cards, when Peter and Wade ran up to him. They stopped inches away from his legs, and they both stared at him, quietly, something brewing behind their eyes. Steve raised his head a little to look at them. These two were going to be troublemakers as they got older.
"Is everything alright?" Steve looked at him, then looked around Tony, being a couple inches taller than him. "I thought I smelled something-"
"Let's take a couple scans, and we'll go from there." Tony hopped up on one of the beds, pulling over a screen. For a second it looked like Steve was going to try and pull Peter away, take him somewhere else so he didn't have to watch, but Peter was faster, pulling himself up on the bed next to Tony. He took the screen from Tony's arm and held it over his injured arm. "Thanks, Petey." He looked at Steve and tried to give him a reassuring look. That's when he saw that some of Steve's uniform was torn, scratches from claws. "Hey, after you get the scan saved, why don't you help Cap clean up his scratches. I'm sure he's got some on his back that he can't reach."
“No thanks necessary,” Steve told him seriously. “I should be thanking you, actually. Yours woke me up before mine could really get started.” Tony pulled back a little to look at him. “Don’t know what it would have been this time, but when I woke up I had a familiar heavy feeling in my chest.” He ran his hand through Tony’s hair. “Helping each other, part of this whole, being together thing.”
"Where did it come from?" Tony watched Jarvis access the drive, showing him the encryption protection.
Tony smiled and walked closer to it, holding Peter on his hip so they could both face it, Mary coming over to standing next to them. "Do you like it?" Peter nodded enthusiastically. "Do you remember that new tablet I was working on?" He asked, looking at Peter. "And how it could make all those cool images show, like a movie? Well," Tony reached forward with one hand, the programming recognizing his hand, and he 'picked' up one of the ornaments.
Tony hummed and nodded as he grabbed a sauce pan. "My mom was Italian, and I fell in love with it the first time she made it for me."
Tony just shrugged again at the statement, finishing his last cup of coffee. "I propose that we move this lazy affair into a more comfortable location. Specifically one where I can recline comfortably if I'm going to have this lump sitting on my chest." There was a fond smile on Tony's face as he brought up the suggestion. Steve got up to carefully take Peter from Tony so the older man could get up, and everyone moved as a group to the living room.
“Alright, alright,” Tony said quietly. He sat up, slipping his shoes off and tossing them out the way, then pulled off his jacket. He turned, moving up a little, and was able to lay down, and curl up a little, feeling comfortably warm and covered. Tony could see how Arc would have been the perfect companion during the war when camping out in the open. Ruby climbed up, nesting in between Tony and Arc’s fur, happily purring before falling asleep. Tony pushed his face into the fur, eyes drooping shut as Arc’s warmth lulled him to sleep.
"Hi!" Tony couldn't help but smile at Peter's excited voice. "You fly today?" He asked in his broken sentences, still learning, quickly, to put together his thoughts into words. "Go bye-bye?"
Someone moved in front of Tony, and he tried hard not to open his eyes, but he almost felt compelled to do it. Loki was crouched in front of him, with a slight frown on his face. “Are you alright, Stark?” Tony grit his jaw, a fire lighting behind his eyes. Loki actually shifted back away from him. “Captain.”
"Peter wants you to have this stuff," Tony told the super soldier. "He brought up a good point that most of this used to belong to you in the first place. Some of it's at the Smithsonian, for their Captain America exhibit, but that can be pulled back if need be."
Tony threw himself up, trying to get away, but logically he knew he wouldn't get away, not in time. The blast threw his body back through the air, landing on his back. His chest Hurt, it stung, his head was swimming. Tony gripped the buttons of his shirt, ripping it open, looking at the armored vest, noting for a second that it was darkening with something.
"I'm moving Tony," Mary said with a little sigh. "It wasn't my first choice, but I kind of have to do it when I get the orders from higher up."
“Oh yeah,” Tony said with a nod. “He liked it, said it felt like a good different. Jarvis runs regular scans on it, probably will for the first year or so, just to make sure that there are no negative side effects, or that the element does fail or start to degrade ahead of schedule.”
"Daddy?" Peter called out from the dining room table, looking in. Tony landed on the ground and looked over, giving him a smile.
"We did not need the woman anymore," the man said, noticing that he was looking around. "So we dispatched of her." He spread his hands wide as Tony jerked once in the chair, clenching his jaw. "We are going to be spending a lot of time together, Mr Stark." Strucker walked over, sitting down on the cot that was against the wall. "Your friends and family will not be able to find you, at least not easily."
"I'll get you some maraschino cherries," Steve said, leaning by the bathroom door. Tony raised an eyebrow at him, but he just smiled, holding up a hand for him to wait.
"The red head." Tony's face dropped, and now Bruce's eyebrows went up. "You didn't know she was SHIELD?"
"Oh, you have got to be kidding me." Tony instantly saw where this was going. "He thought that I was making my move?" Steve nodded. "So he goes full tilt crazy ex? Some sort of 'If I can't have them, no one can have them?'"
"He missed you so much," Mary said quietly, not wanting to wake up Peter. She had a feeling that he wouldn't wake up though, not now that he was with Tony. "I didn't want to tell him that something had happened, that the news was reporting you missing, but after the first three weeks...."
Steve swallowed, pushing back the emotions that threatened to creep up his throat. He had to tell Peter, he had to bring Peter out into this. How was he going to do it? How could he go there and tell a six-year-old that not only was his Mom in a coma, but his Dad was gone? He would tell him that he had done it being a hero, but Peter already saw Tony as a hero, and it wouldn't make it hurt any less. Steve looked at the ground. This was going to hurt everyone.
"Does that help?" The voice was there again, and he nodded, not caring at first that he couldn't be seen.
"Tried using my blood to try and work on the counter measures," Tony started, looking down at his hands. "Turns out, apparently, I'm not a good test subject." He jumped down from the counter as Steve took a step towards him. "The man has been dead for more than Twenty years, and yet somehow, Howard Stark still manages to fuck around with everything."
"Yeah, hi," Banner said, a little unsure, maybe a little skittish. "They told me you would be here."
“Yeah, I’ll be nice for once,” Tony nodded, heading for the door. “I want to check on certain lab results, and then I have to go collect my boys for a haircut.”
"I'll be right there." Tony flipped the faceplate up, about to take off the helmet, when a rumble on the roof caught his attention. Stane landed and aimed his weapons right at Tony. Tony's eyes widened and the faceplate went back down, moving back to avoid the hit. How had he survived from the fall??
"What were you even doing out there?" Pepper looked like she was ready to murder him with her eyes alone. Tony glanced around, not seeing Rushman, but she hadn't been on the jet with them on the way to Monaco either. Just one more person he didn't have to explain Peter and Mary, too, to keep them safe from.
Steve frowned sadly, watching the man in front of him, still holding onto his wrists. "They're your family, too," he said softly. Steve pulled Tony's hands down a little, planting a kiss in each palm. "Go, work quickly. Peter and Mary need you."
Steve chuckled as they walked in to see that the table had already been set. Syrup, powdered sugar, and a bowl of fresh whip cream were already there, and Phil was coming out with a couple of pitchers of juice. Peter was following behind him, a plate stacked high with pancakes in his hands, focusing on their balance in his hands. As soon as the pancakes were safely on the table Peter looked up and grinned. He ran over to Steve and hugged him around the waist.
"Natasha found Barton, but they won't be coming back yet. There's so much in this store," Steve said as he looked around.
“Not at all. I’m the one that helped him find the doctor that he has now.” He could only imagine the look that Wade was giving him. “I have a therapist, myself. Have for several years now.” Steve looked down at Wade, (which with how quickly the boy was growing, he didn’t need to look down nearly as much anymore), stopping them at the door to Wade’s floor. “I’m not going to tell you if I think you should seek someone out or not, that’s not what I’m about. I think that talking to someone if you’re having issues you can’t handle on your own is a good idea. But, I’m not saying that that someone has to be a professional.”
"Thank you, Tony," she said with a smile, arms around her son. Tony nodded, giving her a little smile back. In that moment, Tony knew why he had gone so far to help out a woman he barely knew. He watched Wade and Julie, and he saw Peter and Mary.
"Mine was a through and through," he said with a wave of his hand, like it was unimportant. "No real damage to my shoulder, small bananas in the long run. Had I known it was coming, I would have actually tried to stop it...."
Tony was pretty sure he knew what the problem was, and leaned in and expertly removed Peter from her arms, letting her relax, and held his son to his own chest, arms around him. Peter made soft noise, rolling a bit as he was moved, but when his hand settled on Tony's chest and his reactor, he calmed down and fell right back into a deep sleep.
Steve laughed as he followed them at a more sedate pace. The laugh pulled a soft giggle from Jamie, and he couldn’t help but smile down at her. “Oh, you’re getting more pictures too, little lady,” he told her. “It’s all going in the scrap book, because you won’t remember your first vacation, or your first costume. I will be the embarrassing parent who shows them off to your first partner, and to your prom date, if they’re different people. Make no mistake, I can be merciless.” She tilted her head a little, then turned when she heard Peter’s voice.
"Have a nice evening ma'am." The woman blinked, then smiled and nodded to him, watching them head towards the elevators. Tony clipped his pass to the bottom of his shirt, then clipped the other badge to Wade's sleeve, making him giggle a little.
“Then teach me how to stealthier,” Wade countered. Bucky raised one eyebrow slowly at him. “Peter and I want you to teach us how to fight, too. Self-defense.”
"So, you had no idea about this Natalie? I assume that isn't her real name," Tony snorted a little. "She's fired, by the way."
"Yeah!" Pete opened the sketchbook to show him a drawing he made of his grandparents house. "It's got really thick paper, and they said that I could even use marker on it! I can use pencil, and crayon, and marker, and all sorts of stuff!"
"I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily, I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make." Steve took Tony's other hand. "Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stake." Tony swallowed, Steve's blue eyes locking onto his, feeling what Steve was putting behind the words. "And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend for us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn. We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in. I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not, and who I am." Steve rested his forehead to Tony's as he held out the note.
"If I had issue with it, would I have helped with the wedding as much as I did?" Tony hoped that would get them off that topic.
Steve was in the kitchen working on dinner, Jamie in a jumping device that let her wander around while Steve kept an eye on her. He heard the front door open as Tony and Peter came back and saw Jamie's head perk up too.
"I would offer up my memories to compare with what he had experienced during the invasion," Loki said suddenly, looking at Thor. They both had stoic, very seriously, expressions, and Tony had to wonder what they hell went on up in Asgard. Fucking Magic.
"Daddy picked me up while Mama did the boring food shopping," Peter proclaimed, smiling at Steve. "We got matching haircuts!"
“I don’t like that they were in that position to begin with,” Steve grouched a little. “But, I’m glad that they had a little of the training. I feel better about it, now.”
"If it weren't for Tony, I'm sure I wouldn't be doing this," Steve started to talk as he grabbed the socks and shoes. "The talking out loud," he clarified, mostly for himself. "Not the getting you dressed, or, taking you in. That's a bad phrase, 'taking you in.' Makes it sound like I'm doing you a favor." Steve gently pried the dress from her hands, and she made a grunt of protest, but nothing else. "I'm still technically young, you know, still in my Twenties, and it's kind of weird to think about. That's something I'll explain when you're older." She let out a little giggle when Steve pulled on her hands to get her into a standing position, pulling the dress down with one hand while the other was on her back.
“Just remember to not run them over,” Steve told him, thankful for the tinted windows of Tony’s car. He watched his boyfriend closely, saw him white knuckle the steering wheel a couple of times, before they pulled out until they were free of being surrounded. “Pepper called not too long ago.” He saw Tony glance over at him before looking back out at the road. “The picture broke online not too long ago, she’ll be waiting for us back at the Tower.”
"Not yet, but I'm betting that Barnes does. And he's not exactly the talkative type yet, not with Steve around, you know, living there." Tony leaned back in the seat, as uncomfortable as it was. "And I completely have Jarvis locking that apartment door at night right now, just to be on the safe side and we can get this cleared up. And I really shouldn't be acting as calmly as I am about everything that's happened, but I just don't know how to deal with it all." He let out a breath and actually slumped. "I've got like, two main priorities, and that's what I stick with. Keep Peter safe. Keep Jamie safe. And Steve gave her a middle name, he named her after me. Like. Me. Of all people."
“It’s Tony,” said man murmured, but didn’t complain with Steve hooked his arm under Tony’s knees and lifted him into his arms. “Just Tony.” Steve kissed Tony’s forehead and he hummed softly. “I like that.”
"No, you're kind of not," William interrupted his thought process. "But that's okay." Tony turned to look at him frowning. "You don't have to be perfect, you just have to have a plan to deal."
"I'll be nice and give you two reason." George held up one finger. "The police would take too long to get here-"
"I think it was very spur of the moment," Steve told her. "I didn't ask, I had no intention of asking."
Tony gave a soft smile, but inside he was a little disappointed, even if it was the most adorable thing he’d ever seen. Specially since his girls had never slept near anyone else but him. He let out a little sigh and turned to trudge to his room, before the air left his lung with a soft ‘woomph’, and he was falling backwards. Arc had wrapped a large paw around him, causing him to land against the fur around his neck. Ruby churred silently, padding over to them. Arc opened one eye to look at Tony, making a pointed look that told him to find a comfortable position, because he wasn’t going anywhere.
Sam Wilson. Steve knew he could depend on him, owed him after all this, too, after dragging him into this mess. Counted him as a friend. But he was going to get a swift fist to the face if he didn't let go of Steve's arm. "Think it out, Cap, you can't go." Steve growled, turning the full force of his glare on the man next to him. There might have been an actual flinch, but Sam still wasn't letting go. "We have to get Pierce, and stop those 'Carriers, and you know it. If we don't, then there won't be anyone for you to worry about getting too."
"Consider it done," Tony told them, waving his hand a bit. "Get everything scheduled, don't worry about what it would cost, just send me the bills. Jarvis can help get everything set up tonight, or tomorrow, if you want, and I've already got-" Tony stopped when William put his hand over Tony's mouth.
Steve ran inside then stopped when he saw Clint with his bow armed, and Natasha with a gun in one of her hands, her Widow Bites already charged around her wrists. Bucky was glaring at them, growling, with Meg behind him, both backed against a wall. While Meg was holding onto Bucky's right arm, holding him back from just attacking the two Avengers, it was clear from Bucky's stance that he was guarding her.
Mary walked over to the couch, doing her best to not let Peter see Meg, and leaned over the back to give Peter a hug in Tony’s arms. “I’m gonna stay here to give Steve some tech help, but you’ll be good with Daddy and Aunt Julie, right?” Peter nodded, giving her a brave smile.
“Then we should make it clear that it’s dangerous, and lots of people get hurt trying to do something crazy,” Steve argued back. “Wade just turned ten and Peter is barely eight yet. They’re young, and small-“
"We'll try containment first." Tony smirked a little as the Captain confirmed his thoughts. "If possible, back in the building they escaped from."
"Why did you take my son?" Tony asked, suddenly not wanting to continue this line of questioning. He didn't care about what happened to Loki, the madman had touched his son and that was unforgivable.
He pulled out his ear buds, taking a moment to frown and untangle them, again, and opened his playlist on his phone before starting his motorcycle. Steve had filled it with a lot of his guilty pleasure songs that only Mary knew about, (and she hadn't let him live down his choices yet), but this time when he pressed play he frowned when a song he didn't remember adding started to play. The screen lit up and he smiled gently, thinking that Peter must have added the song to his computer as some point.
"Well, not yet," she admitted a little sheepishly. "I just found out yesterday and got the boxes today. I wanted to get out there before a new school year started."
“Veee.” Vee trilled as she lightly jumped up on Peggy Carter’s bed. She grinned and reached to run her fingers through the fur of the Eevee.
Tony had pre-planned the firework show, setting up furniture up on the roof of the Tower. Coulson and Clint helped Mary to the roof, and to the outdoor couch up there. Peter snuggled up between Mary and Coulson, happily waiting for the fireworks in the sky to start. The Fitzpatrick's weren't far from their daughter and grandson, and Bruce and Clint claimed two chairs on the other side. Tony leaned against one of the power boxes as colors started to explode in the sky.
"Love you too, Daddy," the little boy murmured sleepily, snuggling in further to Tony's chest, warm and content. Tony would give away everything he had, if it meant that he would be able to stay with Peter, to keep his little boy.
"Don't know why, when I was obviously his target," Tony said as he started to lean back again in the bed. His nose was starting to itch. "That didn't change from last time. He's got some super soldier feeling punches though." Steve looked at him, eyes imploring more details. "Well, I mean, I only felt the force behind the shield, but when we had our fight last summer, and you beaned me in the head." Steve looked a little guilty as he was reminded of fighting a compromised Tony. "I remember your punches though, and the force behind them. Even with this guys’ actual arm, he was packing a literal punch."
"We all thought that," Tony told him seriously. "They were lying to us, trying to hide it, and I couldn't stand for that. So we went down there and brought him back here." Tony let a little smile escape when William started to grin. "He's gonna be fine, and the doctors say that he should be awake tomorrow. I don't want to tell Peter until he wakes up, though, because it'll be a nice surprise I think."
"Nope, I sure haven't," Tony responded quickly. "I'll be there in blue, and bells. Well, maybe not bells, I don't wanna steal the show."
"Stand down, Iron Man," a voice called out to this side. He barely turned his head, catching sight of a man with an arm around Meg's shoulders, and a gun to the side of her head. "We have the Captain's friend, and I'm sure you don't her blood on your hands."
Steve hummed and smiled. "Never get tired of that." He pulled Tony closer, kissing him back, but stopping when he felt the brush of Tony's tongue across his lips. "I think this happened on our third date. I think we should eat the food before we get distracted, again."
"Hey, buddy!" Tony ruffled his hair, making Peter giggle a little and try to move his head away. "Did you have fun with Grandma and Grandpa, today?" Peter nodded and pulled away, pulling his backpack off his shoulders.
Thanks to this new schedule, I'm actually ahead in chapters, so that means I get to shape what happens better, and Bucky is really starting to pester me, so expect to start seeing him coming up.
"Uhhhh," Tony blinked. He was quickly finding out that he didn't actually know much about the day to day care of a child. He had to give Mary so much more credit than before. Tony stepped into the pantry, blinking a little at all the different foods; cans lined one shelf, with fresh fruit and vegetables on the other side. He found a unopened jar of peanut butter, a bag of raisins, and turned to find celery. "J used to make this for me, I think he called it, ants on a log?"
“Oh, not a chance in hell,” Tony said shaking his head. “But, they probably will bring the score a little closer, and get that lost dignity back. Rhodey played basketball when were at MIT, and then with the ROTC. I didn’t have the heart to tell Cap. Although, those really were Jamie’s first steps, and I know that Jarvis got them recorded.”
"Of course not, I've got a son that needs attention, so obviously nothing is normal right now," Tony said, trying to make light of the subject. Something that was not unlike Tony Stark, at all. "I have to Watch my alcoholic intake now, Rhodey!" Rhodey couldn't help but roll his eyes a little.
The man chuckled a bit, never moving the gun, or his eyes. "And go into the monologue where you learn about our plan? While I'm sure that you'll probably die, one way or another, I'm not going to take that chance."
"Won't that be hard to pull off when I need it?" Steve asked as Tony pulled out a new leather harness. "I assume that it's a strong enough magnet so that it won't fall off during a mission." Tony nodded a little.
"Less likely to get a buzz from the champagne," Tony told her. He let out a little sigh. "It's been a long time since I've even had a buzz, much less get drunk. A hell of a long time."
An intense chill swept through his body and Tony’s eyes widened, pulling a sharp breath. Dark colors burst in his vision and he felt himself falling backwards. Deep, dark blues, and violets swam in front of him, and the living room disappeared. Softs red and yellows circled together before leaving his sight, and he saw spots of white, and realized they were stars. He was back in space. Tony sucked in a breath, then felt his arms being pulled down, and his back was pushed down against something hard. Hands pressed down on his shoulders, and there was chittering sounds around him.
Pepper must have been making some kind of case as Tony's expression softened a little. "Just pancakes, Pep," Tony said quietly. He made a noise. "Yeah, you too, Pep." Another pause. "That will be all Miss Potts." Steve thought he saw the ghost of a smile. He cleared his throat softly as Tony hung up, and the older man turned his head to look over.
“Why are you moving around so much?” Peter asked, then got up, walking over to her. He frowned and looked down at her. Jamie moved her hands from the table towards Peter. When he got close enough she put her hands on him, grabbing his shirt. “What are you doing?” He went to take her hands, most likely to push them away, but suddenly she was moving again. Her legs wobbled, and as Peter backed up a little, she pulled herself up onto her feet, leaning heavily on Peter.
"I assume there's information?" Steve glanced at the watch on his wrist. He'd only been asleep for about three hours.
"After he's moved to New York, what's the plan?" Mary asked, looking back through the window at the sleeping hero.
Upstairs Tony could smell the amazing scent of cooking food, and not pancakes. Peter wasn't up yet if Steve hadn't been conned into cooking pancakes. He detoured back to his room, opting to change his clothes and take a quick shower, before braving the kitchen and Steve Rogers.
“Mr Stark.” Tony turned from the ruined bar to Steve walking into the room. It would be big enough for his reunion. And he could see Rogers practically vibrating in anticipation.
"Where's the fun in that?" Tony swore he saw Coulson smile. Tony pressed an alcohol wipe to his arm and held it there. "Good to see you guys have all of this covered while we were gone." Tony did notice the Agent wrap the bullet up and slip it in his pocket.
“We made good time getting here, and Jamie took a nap on the jet, so we can get settled and unpacked before we have to head down there,” Tony continued. “Head to the right, Petey-pie,” he said as the elevator doors opened. “This hotel has themed suites, and I was able to book us one I think is the best for this little wayward family.”
"Hello, young Master Peter," Jarvis said as jovially as an AI could. "It is a distinct pleasure to meet you." Peter's eyes widened when Jarvis spoke, and he turned his head around quickly, looking for the person who was talking. "I'm afraid that you won't actually find me, I have no body." Peter looked at Tony with wide eyes.
"Yeah, but it's as close as a talk as you're going to get for at least a couple days," Natasha countered. "Even if he doesn't know that you heard everything. What are your thoughts?"
“Steve!” Steve sucked in a breath at the shout by his ear. He started sucking in breaths until he started coughing, lungs unable to hold a proper breath. A hand was rubbing against his chest, which he could feel again, and he felt something breathing just against the shell of his ear. Someone was trying to help him regulate his own breathing, that’s what it was. “Can you hear me now?” Steve nodded once, jerky, but he nodded. “You’re in New York, and it’s Twenty-Twelve, October. You’re up in the Penthouse, and Peter and Jamie are still asleep. You’re safe, babe, you’re safe. I’m safe, everything is alright.”
"I can assure you, Dr Banner," Jarvis spoke up then, "that should anyone try to listen in on this call will only hear the very best of the band Milli Vanilli." Tony couldn't help but laugh at the AI's choice of music.
Tony could feel his canines tapping together in thought. Sounded like Steve needed something for the day to day monotony. "Before, well, this," Steve motioned to himself, "I was always doing what work I could, if I wasn't confined to the bed. It may not have been the action of battle, but it kept me busy. Now, not so much."
"Mama!" He cried out at the same time that Pepper screamed. Mary turned, holding tightly to Peter, and stood, seeing the giant suit chasing after Pepper.
"But she's okay with you corrupting Captain America," Steve said, rolling his eyes a little. "According to the Smithsonian I'm a symbol of courage, honor, bra-"
"I know that we're not about to jump on board and defend a beater," Tony looked over at the two. He found it a little weird that he might be defending the person who had tried to kill him a couple of times, but there were more important things, people, to worry about at the moment.
"Well, he's not exactly my boyfriend," Steve muttered under his breath a little, feeling his cheeks blush a bit.
Tony watched Steve from the safety of the hallway by the elevator. Saw him talking with Wade's mom, playing all three babies, and watching Jamie start to crawl. He tilted his head back a little when he felt someone come up behind him, soft hand sliding on his shoulder.
Tony shook his head, the whispering in the back of his mind going away. He took a deep breath and turned, firing at a couple more of the chitauri. Steve had hit his head pretty hard, hard enough to bring him back, but the voice was still there. He could still feel, whatever it was, there, just at the back of his mind, too close, touching him. Was this what Loki was feeling? Was this what Barton had felt?
"They read through some of the reports and information we've collected since SHIELD fell," Steve started to explain, finishing with the preparations of the lasagna in front of him, and put it in the oven. "Apparently what they got from some of it was that Bucky and Meg were currently part of Hydra, and didn't know that they would be here in the Tower." Tony raised both his eyebrows. "They may have tried to attack them...." He saw Tony's hand grip his own arms, and his jaw twitched as it tightened.
"Then it shouldn't take too long for the cupcakes." Steve went over to Mary's pantry, and started pulling out the baking supplies, and he was vaguely aware of Tony starting to clear up counter space.
. “If we aren’t careful, he’ll tell the others, and then at an anniversary party, we’ll see Jason Mraz show up to sing to us. I don’t want to publicly hurt your friend, Steve.” Steve laughed and his smile widened.
“So, you plan on visiting the mansion after your vacation?” She asked him, and he brought the phone back up to his ear, looking around to notice a couple of teens sneaking his picture from across the store.
Tony knew he had to tell her now, before she went full on mother mode. .... Who was he kidding, it was going to happen after he told her, but better it be that way, than letting her mind come up with every horror imaginable.
"Tony!" That voice, that was a familiar voice. "Open your eyes, Tony!" There was a pressure at his arms, but they weren't forced back. "Come on, it's alright." That voice was warm, he could trust that voice. "It's me, it's Steve. It's alright, Tony."
"Fine, get in. But I'm not saying anything to Pepper, that is your own beast to take on," Tony muttered as he slipped in behind the wheel of the car.
"You speak of control, yet you court chaos," Thor’s voice was deep enough to break through their argument.
"He's napping," Tony replied, running his hand through Peter's shaggy hair. "William brought him out, so I'm not sure how long he's been asleep."
"Duh." Wade looked at Tony with a little roll of his eyes. "Peter's my best boy, I'm not going to wake him up. And I didn't actually wake you up, I just stared at you until you did wake up."
Peter giggled a little and pushed himself up to wrap his arms around Tony's neck. Tony smiled and wrapped his arm around Peter's waist, sitting up. "I've got a snack downstairs for you, and Rhodey is making dinner. How about we eat something, then I'll show you around the house?" Peter nodded, just content to being held for the moment.
“But, really, he’s just turning into the protective older brother?” Both Steve and Tony nodded. “God, those kids are all yours, every little thing just screams you two.”
Steve followed her with his eyes. Classic signs? That wasn't something that he had ever heard of back in the 30's and 40's, so how was he supposed to know. But he could admit that her advice wasn't bad, and it was something that he could do, and maybe it would give Tony the time and space he needed. Steve could help, he wanted to help, and he could put up with the press or anything else that Tony worried about. He headed for the kitchen now, his goal to make breakfast for everyone this time.
Jamie’s eyes followed where Peter’s hand was pointing once he had pulled her into his lap, and she let out a gasp as her face lit up. She reached out her arms, kicking her feet out. “Pa!” She exclaimed. “PaPa!” Steve’s eyes widened a little when she repeated herself, repeating his name, his brain finally catching up. He moved further into the room, sliding down to his knees in front of his piled up family, and obligingly reached out to pick up Jamie and cuddled her to his chest. “Papa,” she said contently, resting her head against his shoulder.
“My bad,” Tony chuckled. “Well, for dinner the restaurant is at the back of the hotel, just past the pools.”
“What does that mean for us?” Steve whispered, keeping low to the grass and looking for any movement inside the house before darting for some bushes.
"Tony," she paused, gathering her bearings, and Tony didn't like that. "You know that I would help you with anything, but I cannot help you if you're going to start all of this again."
As the baking dish went into the oven, Tony and Peter came back over to the apparent cupcake station, and Steve nodded that the cupcakes were cool enough to frost now. This was something that Tony could do, details? Easy. He had personally wired the Mark II Iron Man suit, taking a probably ridiculous amount of time to do meticulous details that might have driven anyone else crazy.
Tony Stark was,... selfish. He sat in the drivers seat of the black car, on the dark street, half way down the block from a familiar building. It was late, but not too late, but he was restless, and he couldn't help himself. He knew that he should be resting, should be at home. Jarvis had the scans of the arc reactor, and as much as he needed to make a new one, he knew the power would hold up for at least another three weeks if it came down to it. He needed to see his son tonight. Tony grabbed the box from the passenger seat, the present that Rhodey had picked up, and had even gotten wrapped. Taking one more breath, he opened the door, and stepped out, pocketing his keys and heading for the apartment building that Mary and Peter lived in.
His face was worryingly blank. Wade looked at Steve, and when he spoke his voice was even and strong. "You'll stop him from hurting anyone else, right?" Steve nodded right away. "You'll stop him from coming back?" Steve saw his jaw start to wobble a little and he reached out to gently take Wade's arms. "He hurt me and my Mom, and I swore I'd never let him do it again. When he left, I swore she'd be safe."
