Thankfully, Rhodey quieted down and Tony got up, keeping his shirt over his nose as he went back over to Steve. He patted his chest and pulled him out of the room, ignoring Steve’s petty behavior.
Tony shot him a grateful smile before turning around to bring Peter to Steve and transfer the baby to his arms.
Stunned, Tony sucked in a breath, startling Peter enough to make him shift and whimper. He hushed the baby, wilting a little under Natasha’s dead stare.
Steve rolled his eyes and moved to help Tony set up the system, which really meant holding all of the remotes as Tony flicked through them. Since he didn’t even own a television, his own knowledge of electronics was scarce, so he wasn’t much help.
He smiled when Steve managed a watery laugh, digging out a tissue from the glove box so he could wipe Steve’s face.
Once the plane stopped, Steve was up and out of his chair, crossing over to Tony to hold his hand again, despite the grumbling around him from the frantic paramedics. The world around him blurred as they started to move. He ignored everything around him, focusing only on pouring his love through their linked hands, hoping that Tony would just
He hobbled around the cell and checked under the beds, but as he suspected, he came up empty. With anxiety and worry building in his chest, Tony put a hand over the reactor, momentarily wondering if it was possible for the machine to pop out on its own from the pressure in his heart. Taking a seat on one of the beds, he put his head in his hands, taking a deep breath. He sat like that for only a moment, until he realized he had at least one advantage:
Steve snaked a hand over the side of the tub to cup Tony’s face, smoothing his thumb over Tony’s cheek.
left. Then, PJ must have known he was upset because he tried to leave, too. Thankfully, Barnes showed up and grabbed him to take him up to Steve,” he finished, slumping back in his chair.
At Bruce’s unimpressed look, Tony merely sighed and rolled his eyes, standing anyway with PJ in his arms.
Tony sucked in a breath at that, inwardly scolding himself for letting his brain go to that place for a second. He sighed and shook his head, taking his hand from PJ’s hair to rub his temples.
Thankfully, Steve gave no further comment and allowed Tony to help him, but once again grabbed his hand when he ventured to clean his skin under the water.
“I know it is awful. But I have to go next before we can get out, and you cannot be on your own. I know you, mister, and the first thing you will do out there is take your wet little self over and wake up your father,” Tony said as he hurriedly scrubbed himself down, “He likes being woken up by you, but not when you are drenched and naked.”
He pointed to the mattress on the bedframe, watching the realization dawn on PJ’s face. With as much determination as a two-year-old could manage, he dragged the sheet set over and tossed it with a tiny ‘hup’ on top of the mattress. Proud, he turned with a wide smile to Tony, eyes shining brightly.
“There we go. Such a good boy, my beautiful little bug,” Tony whispered, dropping a kiss onto Peter’s head, “We have you, darling. I promise.”
Tony raised an eyebrow as he worked at the back of Steve’s suit, pulling down the top and tying it around his waist like he had done for himself. He turned Steve toward himself, expecting to see sore and possibly raw nipples, but he gasped, eyes widening in surprise. Steve’s pectorals were swollen: only slightly, so it was difficult to tell, but they were red and nearly bruised around the areolas. His nipples were swollen and dark, smeared with a semi-opaque liquid that Tony could only assume was the milk.
Steve gently captured Tony’s hand and the bag between his own hands, a smile slowly turning up the corners of his mouth. Distantly, Tony was aware of the charm Steve was laying on him, but his Omega brain latched onto the attention and he tilted his chin up, unable to look away from the Alpha’s gaze. Steve gently pushed Tony’s hand back up against his chest and held it and the bag there, tilting his head down as if to say:
“He looks about ready to cry,” Rhodey cooed, giggling when Tony turned his head to glare at him, “What? Clearly, you have tamed the big bad wolf. He is nothing more than a hapless pup next to you.”
“Can I ask you something?” he said, and when Tony glared, he shook his head, “No, I’m serious, Tones.”
Of course, once the electronic drawing pad arrived, Steve couldn’t help but grin as he tackled his next art project, determined to best the Stark again.
“It’ll be gone in a few hours. Don’t worry about me. We need to set Clint’s leg before it gets too bad,” Steve answered, rolling his shoulders back before making to stand.
“We are not sure why or how, but Pete imprinted onto me in a way that created a… uh, like a bond. He can sense how I feel, so I have to be careful to not get too upset or the poor thing will cry. I do not know how large the distance could be, though. Perhaps he is just a sensitive baby.”
“Oh, sweetheart, it’s okay, you’re safe,” Tony whispered, “PJ, I need you to look up, kiddo, okay? Look at me, honeybunches.”
Tony stared at Steve for a few seconds before letting out a relieved breath, clapping a hand over his heart to steady himself.
Thor blinked and hurt flashed across his face for a moment, but it quickly settled into a neutral look as he translated to Steve. Tony did not want to watch, to see the anger and disappointment on that handsome face, but he forced himself to meet Steve’s eyes, holding his ground. Steve only raised an eyebrow at him, then turned to Thor, speaking again for quite a time.
“…Me? Well, I’ve been out as pansexual since my thirties. Publicly, though, I’ve mostly dated women. Men can be…”
Fondness turned into nausea, so Tony rolled over in his bed, juggling with conflicting emotions that did not have room for each other in his small chest. Eventually, he decided that whatever may come, he would do what was best for Peter, come hell or high water. Content that he had made a proper decision, Tony settled and fell into a dreamless slumber.
Looking down at the still confused and bewildered child, Tony held his palm out, letting PJ rest his hand on his again. Carefully, the trio made their way back to the living room, where Tony noticed Bruce was gone and another small gathering had begun. Frightened, PJ cried out and hid behind Tony’s leg, clutching at his pants for dear life.
He sounded suspiciously nervous. If he focused on the bond, Tony knew he could probably figure out what had the Alpha worked up, but prying was the last thing on his mind. Instead, as soon as Steve’s fingers pulled out completely, Tony reached back to yank his underwear back up and sat up, putting his shirt back into place. Hiding his arousal with his clothing allowed him to relax a little, so he crawled back into the nest of pillows he had made earlier and plopped down with a groan as he dragged some of the bed furs over himself.  He shut his eyes to the sound of Steve washing his hands and presumably cleaning up after them.
“Steve,” the other said gently, causing the Captain’s eyes to pop back open, “It’s okay. It’s accepted in this day and age, really. I mean, more than it was in the forties—”
“So she fell pregnant from unbonded Omega-Omega relations, of which one of those happens to be the Prince,” Bruce said, grimacing when Tony nodded, “Well, I would say that you may have very well succeeded in going against your father’s wishes, that is for sure.”
“Easy,” Natasha replied, concentrating on reading, “Just steal you. Or your sheets. Have you been kidnapped lately?”
Thor merely patted his shoulder, holding him steady. The carriage came to a halt and Thor jumped out, offering up a hand for Tony to grab onto. With Peter in the crook of his arm, Tony took Thor’s hand and gingerly climbed down before shifting his packs to a more comfortable position. As Thor led them into the main castle, Tony was constantly prodded on by the guards, but he could not help his dallying as the inside of the structure was just as grand as the outside. Stained glass shone colored scenes on the polished floors, just out of reach of the ornate carpet that stretched out from the door and into the throne room.
“Me?” Rhodey raised an eyebrow, “My father was the Captain of the Guard for Howard for many years before his death in the field. Tony and I grew up together because of that.”
“Okay, I will stay. Can—can we get on with the meeting?” Tony said, pulling back from Steve’s embrace.
“It never stopped,” Tony answered truthfully, shame and guilt making his bottom lip quiver, “I didn’t—I didn’t want you to worry. You worry so much, and I can handle it—”
“Come along, Mr. Barton. Let’s get you cleaned up,” he said while managing to corral him out without getting cake onto anything.
“Hey. You’re probably all sticky, and we never really did clean you off much when we found you,” Tony explained, “I’m going to guess you hate water though, so I’m going to give you a sponge bath, okay? I have to do this for myself too. I hate baths. And showers.”
Steve’s face remained passive, but the guilt seeping through their bond told another story. All he had to do was raise one eyebrow to get Steve’s facade to crumble.
“I am no weak little Omega, dripping and begging for your knot to fill me up. Your ass is mine to be taken and used,” he continued as he scraped his nails down Steve’s chest, careful to avoid his injury, “Just because you cannot bear children does not mean I do not want to fuck you within an inch of your life until you are pleading and screaming for me to let you come. I
Clint nodded and stepped away, leaving them to their privacy. Steve made a wounded noise and leaned down to nose at Tony’s neck, still distressed from his scent.
“He deserved it,” Tony said out loud, more of to himself than Peter, “He should feel guilty—right, love?”
“I can do it, I can do it, you just gotta stretch me, use four fingers if you have to, lick me out, I do not
“Tony, what matters right now is getting you cleaned up and back into bed,” Steve said patiently, stripping down as part of his plan to get Tony into the shower, “Alright? I just want you to be comfortable as much as possible, sweetheart. You just went through a traumatic experience. There is
Steve’s face flushed a pretty pink, then he slowly reached over to place a hand on Tony’s stomach. It took a second for him to understand, but when it clicked he shivered and shook his head.
Steve raised an eyebrow and looked down at the device. It seemed simple enough; two knobs, and when he turned them, a black line would wiggle across the white background.
Five years. Five beautiful, wonderful years filled with laughs and movie nights and embarrassed blushing when their rings clinked when they held hands. Five years of marriage, and Steve had never expected to see his husband be so nervous when they exchanged gifts. Usually, they tried to do something out of the ordinary, since they never felt they needed material items; Steve generally chose a charity to give money to in Tony’s name, whereas Tony gave the public school system an influx of supplies. However, this year, Tony had clearly done more than what he’d promised, as he was sitting across from Steve with a shoebox in his lap, knees bouncing and causing whatever was inside of it to thunk back and forth.
“Awe, Tony, baby,” Steve sighed happily, reaching up to press the heel of his hand to his eye to try and keep the tears back, “I’m—I’m
Tony felt his eyebrows shoot up to his hairline, at which PJ immediately started to back down, curling in on himself with shame and taking his hand from Steve.
“Idiot. He is not trying to take me from you,” Tony scolded right back, leaning back up to look at Steve, “He knows that we are betrothed and he is not stupid enough to try and break that.”
Tony sighed and slipped on his shoes before limping out to the hallway, quietly closing the door behind him. He should head down to the dining hall, but the sun was coming in through the front windows of the castle and he wanted to warm himself in the rays. It took a few minutes, but he eventually got to the front doors and let himself out, sighing happily once he could breathe in the crisp autumn air. The sun had barely peeked over the horizon, coloring the few clouds in shades of pink and purple. Tony stood there against the castle walls and watched the sunrise until the sky was almost completely blue, taking in the beauty before all hell descended on his head.
Careful of the trees, Tony swerved through the jungle as they moved, trying to lose them in the thicket. Realizing that it wasn’t working, he took a breath and angled for a line of trees, focusing despite Steve’s shouts of warning. Right before they hit, Tony shifted into third and slammed on the brakes, skidding into a 180 before shifting back into fifth and roaring off. He whooped as he watched the motorbikes crash into the trees, successfully taking down two of the four.
“You’re bouncing your leg, and if you don’t stop, I’m going to remove it and cook it,” he threatened, only to earn a smack from Natasha, “Hey! What was that for?”
Clint and Bucky walked up, the latter putting his hands on his hips as they observed the clearly guilty parties. He sighed and shook his head, dragging his metal hand over his face and mumbling expletives under his breath.
one of the nice guards can get us a blanket, yeah? And then Papa will be here soon, and he’ll be so happy to see you, I bet he’ll even kiss your cute face because he missed you so much—”
“Uh. We talked a bit. I’m going to take him to see Aunt Peg,” he said sheepishly, shrugging at Bruce’s stare, “What? It’s the least I could do. He’s been having trouble lately. I think it could be good for him. Some closure.”
“My mother was too old. I was lucky to have been conceived at all. As to the laws… my father’s bigotry outweighed any feelings toward me. He has always seen Omegas as secondary and he probably will until the day he dies.”
“Leave! God, go have your walk, I do not want to have any more of these images assault my mind,” he complained, “And in front of your son!”
PJ nodded absentmindedly, not even bothering to hide his staring at Pepper. She merely smiled back at him, happy to have his attention for a few moments.
At the boy’s nod, Tony scooted over and tugged the covers down, glad to see that he was at least dressed. PJ quickly snuggled up to Tony’s side, and once he was settled, Steve stepped up to tuck the covers around them both.
“I’m fine. How are you?” He said quickly, ignoring Rhodey’s prolonged stare, “I thought you guys got swarmed.”
Steve nodded jerkily and stood from the table, snatching up the empty plate to take with him. Once he was out of earshot and in the kitchen, Tony looked back down at Peter and pressed a kiss to the babe’s forehead, nuzzling his hairline.
Carefully, he moved over to the closet to pull on new underwear, panting softly at the ache as he moved his legs. Tony glanced at Steve and figured the Prime was still too sensitive for clothes, so he hefted himself back up onto the bed. He pulled the furs up around them and gently kissed Steve’s bruised nose, happily settling down for the night.
“--and apparently the one dude who can get a good jump on Steve since I have known the damn man,” Clint finished with a sigh.
Tony yelped as water shot out from the showerhead, completely soaking him. Surprised, Steve quickly turned it back, having to bite his bottom lip to keep from laughing at how much the other resembled a drowned rat.
“You did so well, darling, you were so good for me,” he praised softly, crawling up the rock to lay down next to the Alpha, “Are you alright? Do you hurt?”
Tony turned to look at Steve, nudging his head with his shoulder to make him look up. He searched his face for a moment, then nodded, dropping his gaze back down to PJ.
Attempting to push himself up into a sitting position, Tony let out a hiss of breath, his hand immediately going to his left side.
He froze when he felt the Captain’s lips on his neck and shoulder, suddenly very aware that they were both nearly undressed and alone by the ebbing fire. Deciding to go for it, he reached forward to press a hand to Steve’s groin, sucking in a breath when he felt his hardness, even through his suit.
“I was always interested in fire, and campfire building is just physics,” He snorted, standing up to shrug off the top of his undersuit and tying around his waist, leaving him bare-chested in the humid heat, “Alright, wanna chop down a tree?”
Tony smiled as Bruce carried on laughing, stopping them in front of an open doorway. He gestured for Tony to enter, letting them walk into the armory.
Once he could reach out to touch Steve, he spread his left palm over the center of his chest, feeling the stiff body paint shift on his skin. It flaked off and fell to the floor, immediately causing a plan to pop into his brain. Before he could talk himself out of it, Tony moved his hand to take hold of Steve’s wrist, pulling on him to guide him into the bathroom and close the door behind them.
He heard Steve whimper and he smiled, forcing himself to relax in the hopes that a calm aura would keep him sated through the procedure. Unfortunately, the cut was long, which meant that he would need at least twenty stitches, and the longer it took to stitch him the longer Steve would be at his gland.
“I thought your eyes looked familiar. Maria hosted us once at the castle when she was with child, and I must say, both my husband and I were quite taken back by her gaze. More gold than brown, no? Very unique.”
PJ crawled up onto the couch between the two of them, his elephant tucked under his arm and books under the other. He deposited the books in Tony’s lap, looking up at him expectantly.
“He is—was my best friend,” Tony explained with a wince, pretending not to watch Natasha stalk around the room, “He was my first friend in preschool, he befriended me for literally no reason other than liking my shirt, he was my first and only crush and I’ve been in love with him since he kissed me on the playground the first day I met him, god, Rhodes, he’s everything I’ve ever wanted and he threw me away for
“Oh, we’ll all get a turn. I’d love to let Bruce loose on him,” Steve said, smiling a bit at the thought.
“I guess I have to tell Steve,” Tony finally said, feeling as though a gnarled hand had wrapped itself around his heart and squeezed.
Tears leaked from his eyes, but he did not cry. He felt hollow as the acceptance of the worst fate imaginable set in his mind. No amount of petting or cooing from Steve brought him up, to the point that he began to scent strongly of sorrow and grief.
“It’s called the arc reactor. It's basically a large magnet,” he explained, rubbing his thumb over Steve’s to try and help keep him calm, “When I first went to Afghanistan it was to show off a missile I’d recently developed. When—when we were traveling between sites, our caravan got attacked. I was the only—I was the only one who made it.”
He nodded, taking a deep breath to try and keep his righteous anger at bay. There was too much going through his head to really pin down any one thought. He was worried for Tony, frustrated that he hadn’t been able to prevent another time that his husband got hurt, pissed that Fury manipulated him and forced another stumbling block into their relationship—
Not missing the flush on the Captain’s face, Tony quickly turned and pretended not to notice, smiling as PJ trotted out of the bathroom, immediately scooping up his elephant that had been left on the bed. Hugging it close, he looked up at Tony and Steve, then held his arms up. Tony glanced over at Steve, then nudged him.
“He is an infant. He barely understands the difference between his fingers and toes, let alone have the ability to remember what I am saying,” Tony said, leaning in to press a kiss to Peter’s cheek, “Okay, baby. Be good for your uncle. I will be back soon for you, alright?”
“Steve. He’ll be okay. I—I don’t know what kind of fresh hell he’ll be in, but we’ll be there for him,” Bucky said, earning a nod from Rhodey, “Once we’re wheels-down I’ll call in the cavalry.”
There in the middle of the next page was a colored polaroid, of two toddlers smushed together on the same small cot with familiar rabbit ears poking up between them.
Making a point of popping a blueberry into his mouth, Tony watched as Steve left again, only to laugh when he heard a familiar shriek from the room over. He quickly dug into his breakfast, shoveling eggs onto his toast once he realized how hungry he actually was. He was halfway through his ham steak when Steve walked by the door with PJ over his shoulder, giggling and clearly dripping with something.
“Nah, man. Steve’s favorite is strawberry,” Bucky snorted, “He couldn’t have it until after the serum because of his allergies.”
, huh? You like colors? I wish Steve had stayed for this, he would have loved to teach you colors and art,” Tony murmured, balancing the book in one hand so he could keep his other arm wrapped around the boy.
“Are you going to fuss with me, sweetheart?” He teased as he scooped the naked baby up, “You going to make me pay attention to you, one way or another? Do not worry, my love, I am all yours. Once your silly Papa gets all sorted out, we will go have a walk in the nice sun…”
“I won’t try anything,” Tony promised, stretching his arms up just to drape them around Rhodey’s neck, “I promise. Just want to hug you for real, honeybear.”
Bucky and Steve had taken the situation in stride; true survivalists, they’d set out to forage and look for water, leaving the rest of them to build camp. Thor and Hulk un-crunched the Quinjet to make a shelter, using pieces of the wings to divide the insides into sections so they at least wouldn’t have to sleep in a big group pile. That left Sam and Clint on watch while he and Natasha built a bonfire.
Tony grumbled to himself as Steve grabbed the ointment from the medical supplies, unhappy with the fact that the Warlord is right. Together, they trooped back out to the bedroom and Tony went to lay down, until Steve grabbed his arm to stop him.
Turning back to the kid, Tony tucked the elephant in with PJ before settling the covers around them and sitting on the edge of the bed.
. I told him to ask you to make him a set that will make sure he won’t die, but he got huffy and told me I didn’t know what I was talking about and then left for a mission the next morning. I keep calling, but his second keeps picking up and telling me he doesn’t want to talk.”
Tony put down the first drawing to pull out the second, a soft whimper escaping from where he nibbled on his bottom lip. That was definitely MIT Tony, just a sprinkling of facial hair but still expressive, bent over Cap’s lap, his cock trapped between his belly and Cap’s leg, leaking even in the graphite. Cap wasn’t angry, but determined, fondness in his penciled eyes with his hand raised to bring down again. Steve had even added one color, just to tint young Tony’s bare ass a cherry red.
“I do not trust him, Tones,” Rhodey said with a shrug, unconcerned with Tony’s anger, “I want to make sure I know the situation thoroughly before I decide if I approve of him or not.”
, Cyclops,” Tony snapped, earning a look of surprise from Bruce, “He is a child, and since he’s technically
“Hey, come on, this isn’t like you,” He tried, starting to feel his shirt collar get wet, “I’ve never seen you this upset, it’s—we can—shit, Steve, I’ve been high out of my mind for a year wishing you’d just talk to me again, I know I’m not going to be able to dump you on your ass like that, okay? Fuck, man. The worst year of my life has been the one where you’re not in it. I’m not stupid enough to ignore that. Alright? We—we won’t be what we were, but we can get there. I think. I need a hell of a lot of therapy first.”
Steve laughed a little at that, rocking back as he looked down at PJ. Reaching up a steady hand, he brushed the child’s curls behind his ear, humming at the patch of blond.
Satisfied that he shocked Steve into silence, Tony carried PJ out of the room and into his new bedroom. He thought about his sentence for only a millisecond, only to chalk the strangeness of it up to Steve’s inane observational skills. With a tiny huff, Tony set PJ on his feet once they were in the bedroom, looking around at the half-finished project.
“This is going to scar,” he sighed, “At least the cut is clean. It will be easy to stitch up--here.”
“Tony. He is a baby. He would cry and wail whether it be in your arms or Sam’s,” Steve said, “Plus, you would have to leave him be eventually. We want to have our own room, right?”
“I could get used to waking up like that,” he murmured, eyes unfocused and hazy, “I mean, I’d prefer it if you were kissing my—”
“I’ll break the news since I need to call Pep about a few things anyway,” Rhodey said, standing and brushing off his uniform, “Once you’re stateside, she’ll hopefully have some projections. You know this won’t end well company-wise, right?”
It hurt to let Peter feed on his sore nipples, but he did not have much of a choice; they went to bed early the night before, so the poor thing must have been starving. At least, given the force of the suction on his breast, that is what he assumed.
“It was an accident,” Tony grumbled, quickly crossing the room to take Steve’s hand, “It was a reflex. Do not let it go to your head.”
“What if it doesn’t? What if I’m gonna be like this?” Steve blurted out, “I mean, with all my stuff, maybe—”
Unbeta'd. Comments and kudos are really appreciated. Ask me questions over @avengersasssemble on tumblr.com.
“Hey, Tony, we’re right here,” Bucky’s voice came from his left as gentle arms encircled him, “Coach is calling 911—”
“What the hell happened in here?” He asked once he stepped foot in the room, seeing a half-nude toddler running around and Steve sitting in the middle of the room, completely drenched.
“If you come now, we will have to start all over again later when you recuperate,” he said in faux-sympathy, enjoying Tony’s whines as he pulled his fingers out, “Easy there, Omega. Time for the bed, no?”
“Hush, I got you, just focus on me,” Tony murmured to the boy, holding him close as he was ushered out by the guard down the hallway, “We’re going to be okay, I
Tony clapped Clint on the shoulder before heading back out, finding PJ glaring up at a very awkward-looking Steve with the sippy cup cast down on the floor. The boy turned at his footsteps, his face blotchy with what looked like tears running down his cheeks.
“I apologize. The—the not being able to understand each other is going to be amusing and quite frustrating,” he breathed, “I can already tell.”
“Irish skin. Can’t help it. Bucky makes fun of me for it, too,” Steve sighed, wincing himself as he sat up, “God, these beds are uncomfortable. With the amount of money that goes through SHIELD, you’d think they could make a fund for comfortable beds.”
“Shh. Another moment and then we can all cozy up together,” Steve’s calm voice said from somewhere above him.
Slowly, he stretched out his open palm, waiting patiently, despite having to watch the boy sob his heart out in front of him. It took a few minutes for PJ’s cries to dwindle, but once he looked up, he stuck his hand out to rest on Tony’s palm.
“Okay boys, give Mom and Dad their turn to answer,” Natasha interrupted, waving her face with her cards, “Steve, what’s your favorite ice cream flavor?”
Without looking, Rhodey’s arm snuck around Tony’s waist and pulled him in, a long-standing reflex for them. Tony smiled and leaned his head on Rhodey’s shoulder, inhaling his friend’s warm scent as Rhodey turned to bump their foreheads together so he could look down at Peter.
Discouraged, Tony stood up and did as he was told, staring at his shoes the whole time. Sliding into the seat Steve had stuck him in earlier, he figured he was going to sit by himself, only to be surprised as Steve slid into the seat next to him.
“Oh, you’re so getting it later,” he hissed up to Steve before the others would be able to hear them.
The team moved forward in practiced sync, weapons raised in case of an ambush. The first few rooms they investigated were either decorated with basic furniture or completely empty. It was not until they hit the second-to-last room that Tony put up his hand, stopping the party.
When they began the lessons, Tony had to admit he was a little bit more than confused; not only was the vocalization of the Northern language completely different from the South, but the shapes of the words on parchment were strange and blocky, as compared to the South’s soft cursive script. It was a challenge to tackle, but he eventually found his footing, and from there he sped through grammar lessons. He learned most easily through immersion, so he and Bruce often frequented the markets speaking only in the Northern language unless he wanted to ask for the translation of a word he did not know. His mind soaked up the information, and after almost two weeks of engrossing himself in language books and literature, Tony was nearly fluent and able to hold complex conversations. He thanked his perfect memory and genius intellect for carrying the heft of the work, but he knew it was all going to be worth it when Steve came back home and they could
At least, he tried to get there. His legs gave out before he could take a step, too weak and achy to support his sudden movements. He fell to his knees with a large
He stopped them in the middle of the staircase and turned to face Steve, looking up into his eyes. They were so, so blue, clouded with confusion, making him seem more like a small puppy than a Warlord.
“Alright. Widow, Hawkeye, take lead. Iron Man and I will do side rooms. Thor, you watch our backs,” Steve called out.
His voice softened and he reached up to cup Steve’s cheek, moving his fingers over to gently prod at his bruised nose. Steve hissed but did not move, pouting until Tony took his hand away.
“You look…good,” He finally said, “Perhaps I could get a cloak at some point since I tend to run cold.”
. Trembling, Steve reached into his shirt to dig out his dog tags; he pulled them off to hold in his hands and thumbed between them to get to his wedding ring. With a quiet sniffle, he took the ring off the chain and slipped it onto his hand, flexing his fingers as they adjusted to the familiar weight. Just as he replaced his tags around his neck, one of the nurses quietly approached with a clipboard.
. Since I’ve known you the longest, I’d like to say that I’m an expert, and therefore, you have to listen to me.”
Tony sighed and nodded, then grimaced at the lingering taste in his mouth. Sam motioned to Clint and caught a waterskin thrown at them, offering it to him for a drink. He eagerly swallowed down the water, mumbling a thank you when he handed it back.
Tony barely held back his eye roll. He pointed at Steve, then at the bed, reaching out to gently touch his arm to try and guide him. Surprisingly, the Alpha went and laid down, turning to his side so he could look up at Tony. After a second, Steve scooted back and patted the bed, looking confused that Tony had not moved with him.
Thankfully, his experience with a spent and handsy Tony was probably more extensive than his experience as a soldier, so Steve easily manhandled Tony into a quick shower—together, of course—and some pajamas before tucking them both into bed. He let Tony snuggle up into him with a tablet in his hands, presumably flicking through stocks or the news as he settled down.
"Sweetheart! We need to get going or we’re going to be late!” Tony called up the stairs, fumbling with his jacket zipper for a moment before finally getting it hooked and zipping up the stupid jacket.
“SHIELD will know we’re missing in a few days and will send for us,” Natasha had said once they crawled out of the wreckage, brushing dust off of her catsuit, “We’ll need to survive until then.”
“Yeah, she sure is, isn’t she?” Tony answered quietly, crouching down next to the boy in the hopes of keeping him from going into another fit, “That’s Natasha. She’s Russian. That means she’s from a really,
Steve shushed him again and hooked his fingers in Tony’s pants, carefully peeling them off and tossing them aside. He barely pulled down Tony’s underwear when the scent from his slick hit him full force, almost bringing him to his knees. Tony shifted and whined, pushing them off the rest of the way and dropping them over the side of the bed. He moved up onto his knees to fiddle with Steve’s trousers, totally unaware of how out of it the Alpha was.
“Do you have any family history of disease?” Bruce asked, pushing his glasses up his nose as they made their way down to his lab.
Beyond freaked out at this point, Steve only nodded, an aura of smallness and inferiority radiating off of him. Tony shoved the Captain down to sit on the ottoman, glaring at him before turning a gentle face to PJ.
“It’s okay, PJ,” he said quietly, trying to hide the concern on his face, “It’s okay. I’m here. It’s okay to cry.”
in it. Even though he tried to see, tried to understand the pull of parenthood, the constant nagging fear of turning out to be just like Howard settled like stones in his gut. For Pepper, he’d put in the effort, read the books, and did all he could to make himself into the person she had wanted him to be. Sure, he loved to visit with children, both out in public and during quiet nights at the orphanage, but having a charge of his own? He could barely take care of himself, some days.
“I knew that was what you had, I thought you said your favorite was strawberry since you can finally eat it!”
“No, no I did not mean—ugh, I need to learn your language as soon as I can,” He grumbled, shaking his head at Steve, “It is
“Be serious. Going feral could keep him incapacitated for weeks if we are not careful, and with the current situation with the Stark Kingdom, we cannot afford to have him down here grunting like a hog,” Sam said.
“Sleep, love. I’ll wake you up when we’re getting ready to go to the airport,” Tony murmured, carding his fingers through Steve’s hair, “Okay?”
to be good for them. Okay? Don’t—don’t give them a reason to hurt you. I know you’re scared, I know, I am too. But we just have to hold out a little longer. Until then, we have to play it safe. Alright? You’re so, so strong, I
Tony whooped again and spun the vehicle around, pressing buttons like he was playing Pac-Man to bring up and fire the vehicle’s machine guns. Thankfully, JARVIS’ auto-aim system made the fight easy, and it only took a few seconds before the riders fell from the sky.
“You okay, kiddo?” Tony murmured, spreading out their new blanket over them both, “I got you. And hopefully, the others will be here soon. Do you think you can sleep? It’ll help you feel a little better.”
A small frustrated noise erupted between them, causing both adults to look at the child. He pouted up at Pepper, his bottom lip stuck out as he semi-glared up at her. She blinked before taking her hand from Tony’s hair, sliding it into PJ’s curls. Though he didn’t relax, the pout left his face and he settled again on Tony’s chest.
“So, who told you I’m good with kids?” Clint piped up, twirling an arrow between two fingers as he watched Tony scuttle around.
He was running out of space to back up into. Just as he was about to hit the wall, arms came out of nowhere and picked him up, cradling him into a warm chest. Peter unlatched in the movement and began to cry again, which only caused Tony’s heart to ache more. Carefully, he held the baby as close as he could, turning his head into the warm chest to try and gather his wits. He soon realized that it was Thor who was carrying him, based on Alpha’s familiar scent. Knowing he was safe, Tony relaxed by a fraction and focused on keeping Peter safe in his hold until he could be put down.
“I know that an apology won’t cover the shit that’s happened to you in the last year, but I’m sorry. And I also know that’s not good enough, and never will be good enough. I’m sorry that I let you down, as both a person and my best friend. I should have—it doesn’t matter what I should’ve done, I guess. I didn’t do it, and you got hurt again, and I told you I’d never let that happen again. I fucked up, Tony.”
“I think both are viable options,” Natasha said, “But Tony, you need to recover. None of us are going to let you back into the field in your current condition, and since you are PJ’s main caretaker, he goes where you go.”
, especially since they were in a public area where anyone could walk in and see him spread out. Thankfully, the examination was quick and his pants were returned to their place, but even Steve helping him up and fixing his clothes did nothing to alleviate his shame and anger. In fact, as soon as he was upright and resituated, Tony moved around Steve and limped back to their room, growling any time the Prime tried to get close to help.
“Nothing, nothing. We merely have trouble keeping it together sometimes when you talk of your new plaything,” Barnes said, winking back at Tony.
“Sleep, little one,” he murmured in their native dialect, “Papa will not let anyone hurt you. He will soon be with us again and you can have all the attention you want from him. Maybe we can get you to say Papa by then, hm? Surprise him?”
The allure of a toy perked him up, so Tony used that momentum to get Peter changed and fed before he could upset himself. Of course, that also meant he pulled on Tony’s clothes as Tony tried to eat his own breakfast, earning a laugh and an extra bite.
Bucky flushed and grunted at that, making the others laugh. He pouted and crossed his arms, to which Steve consolingly patted his arm.
He choked on another sob and bowed his head, pressing Tony’s hand up against his face. Ignoring the tears that slid down his face, he pressed shaky kisses into his palm and down his wrist, comforting himself with the taste of Tony’s pulse under his lips.
Tony sighed loudly and ushered PJ into the bathroom, rolling his eyes at Steve’s awkward I-don’t-know-what-to-do-in-this-situation shuffle in the bedroom.
“No. I want to tell you now while I’m pumped full of the good stuff. You know I’ll just weenie out later,” Tony said weakly, “Let me? Please?”
“I hope that in your stay here, you will not have to gather such strength by yourself again. You now have a whole community to help you, Tony. We will all do our best to make you feel welcome and at home. You are a part of our family now—you
“If you say genitalia again, I’m going to jump out of the window,” Sam grunted, at which Bucky nodded.
Tony’s weak sigh told Steve he was being a little too serious, so he leaned up to kiss him, sliding his hands up underneath his grimy workshop tank to press against the small of his back.
Thor answered, but he did not quite hear it; he nodded anyway, figuring the Prime would follow them. Eventually, the castle came back into view and Tony wriggled, intending on walking by himself. He pouted when Thor refused to put him down and intended to make noise about it until he was gently placed on a cot and swarmed by Steve. The receding panic left Tony feeling groggy and unable to fight, so he lazily tried to swipe at him, only to have his hand grabbed by Bruce.
Steve, way beyond what Clint and Sam relentlessly teased them about. With that, Tony leaned over to press a kiss to Steve’s cheek and heaved himself up off the bench, jogging out to the field to start practicing for the game. He always liked to practice against Thor and Bucky, since they were much bigger than him; it allowed him to work on his footwork, weaving in and out of their legs to score goals. By the end of the practice, Tony was heaving something fierce, forcing himself to not wipe away his sweat for fear of taking off the makeup.
Thank you to everyone who has left comments and joined me on this journey. There will be one more chapter--the epilogue--and then Spliced will come to a close.
“Breakfast?” Steve asked, finally smiling when Tony’s stomach growled, “Stay. I will go make us plates.”
Steve nodded and sniffled when he pulled back, ducking his head into his shirt for a second to wipe off the tears and snot on his face. Shakily, he sat down on the edge of the bed, clutching at Tony’s hand.
“We didn’t think you were going to make it. Split your head wide open, ribs were a mess—turns out it was just old breaks breaking again, but we didn’t know that. Someone forgot to mention things were still bad in the Stark household,” He said, staring at Tony, “Blood was everywhere. They put you in a medical coma. I thought I’d seen everything, but I’d never seen Thor cry, man. We really—we thought—”
“Do you think—Bruce,” he tried, fumbling for the right words, “Should we—y’know, ask him? About what happened?”
“I know. I know, sweetheart. I’m here. I’m right here, my love. I’m safe, I’m not going to leave you,” Tony whispered, rubbing Steve’s back one-handed and tucking his face into Steve’s neck, “Everything is going to be okay, baby. I promise. Nothing is going to take me away from you. Never again. I won’t let them, my love.”
“Okay, kiddo. I know you hate water, but we need to clean ourselves up and get this over with,” Tony murmured, holding his hand out to the clearly frightened child, “You trust me, yeah?”
Steve hesitated, then carefully stepped into the room. Tony felt his eyes widen and his jaw drop, but didn’t realize he was staring until the other boy flushed and stared at his feet.
“He’s right. If Sam’s out there, he should have the best of the best, which is, of course, invented by yours truly.”
“Thor asked if—if guys can get pregnant through the b-butt,” Steve mumbled, making a face at his word choice.
Bruce offered a tight smile and nodded, bowing his head before leaving and closing the door behind him. Tony let out the breath he had been holding and tilted his chin down to kiss the top of Peter’s head, readjusting the furs around them to cover them better.
So, when the team caught him downing his third gallon of ice cream while watching Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Tony merely took the Neapolitan out of his hand and exchanged it for Moose Tracks, complaining that, “no one eats the goddamn strawberry except for me, so don’t eat the rest of the goddamn tub.”
could prepare him for the sight the greeted him when the elevator doors dinged open. Calling it a temper-tantrum was the understatement of the century, considering PJ had literally flung himself to the ground, screaming and crying and causing his face to become blotchy and red from the lack of oxygen. Really, Tony would have laughed at how ridiculous he looked, but seeing Steve curled up in the corner with his hands over his ears, he did the only thing he could think of.
“He is the only survivor,” she continued, looking up to Tony as if she had read his mind, “There were roughly ten splices per Avenger. So out of sixty—”
“I am sorry if he makes you feel jealous, darling,” Tony said, snuggling into Steve’s side to rest his head on his shoulder, “He trusts you about as much as you trust him, and you have seen what lengths he will go to to try and make sure I am safe. Though I figure that you could hold your own, I still do not want you two to fight.”
“Fuck, Tony,” Steve panted, glacially pushing in to give him time to adjust, “Y’feel so good, darling, so
He quickly schooled his face when Steve glared at him, wondering if Steve had been able to read his thoughts. With a fake cough and a nod, Tony stood and scurried out to the bedroom, waiting until he had Peter upon his shoulder so he could laugh into the baby’s cheek.
“He doesn’t,” Steve said from where he was strapped in, his head resting on his fist as he stared at the two men, “He has no idea what he’s doing. But it’s not like anyone else here knows either. It seems right to defer to the smartest in the room for the next course of action.”
Steve made a soft noise and shook his head, clearly distressed and confused. Slowly, Tony unraveled his crossed arms, placing himself and PJ into Steve’s personal space and sliding an arm around his waist. Automatically, his arms came up to encircle them, resting easily on the small of Tony’s back.
Tony tried to smirk, but it looked less cocky and confident and more wide and joyous and tearful. “Steve, babe, two things: First, this is not me ‘settling’ for you. I have dated several people before you and no one has ever been as good to me as you. Even Pepper, bless her heart, had a rocky time with all of my broken parts and ugly history. Sure, maybe ten years from now I will be successful and rich and have a big house and ten cars or whatever, but no one in the world could ever be better to me than you.”
Bucky came in around lunch, just like he always did. He claimed he liked to have some coffee while he studied but he usually ended up talking more with Steve or Sam, the other part-time worker at this shop, whom he’d really hit it off with, than doing any actual school work. This day he had his laptop under his arm and his book bag slung over his shoulder, practically dead on his feet as he sat down by the counter and rested his head on his arms.
He did find her by their lockers, but she was not alone. Another young man was standing very close to her and talking in a manner that Thor could only assume was flirting, and he would have been enraged at this had he not seen the held back anger and annoyance on his lovely Jane’s face.
Which stung, like it always did when they didn’t want to spend time with him. But Ty and these asshats didn’t need to know that.
"Of course I am! What, have you been thinking otherwise for these past few years? Huh, some husband you are." Steve playfully poked his with his fork in Tony's stomach, not hard enough to hurt but enough for it to tickle a little and it made Tony twitch and laugh as he tried to pull away from Steve's hold, only for Steve to tighten his grip around Tony's waist.
They sat like that for a while, wrapped up in each other’s arms, just being together and loving each other’s company. Then, after a few minutes of silence…
“And here I thought you liked attention. Was I wrong to assume that?” Tony shook his head and laughed again.
Toni chuckled and shook her head, moving to sit cross-legged as she watched her best friend rummage through her closet with an amused quirk on her lips. “I’ll keep that in mind for the future, thanks.” She looked over the mirror and brushed her fingers through her hair. While she wasn’t too dirty or smelly, she should probably shower before she went out tonight. If nothing else to make a good impression on him, and because she had been working in the workshop and still had some engine grease and dirt on her face, hands and under her nails.
But Steve had looked so damn hopeful when she said she wanted to give him a chance. And so happy when she'd said yes when he finally asked. If she went back in and cancelled or stood him up tonight, it might break his heart.
Speaking of Bruce, he had gotten back up from the machine’s side and was now looking over at the other machine in the room. “What do you think this is?” Thor got up from where he was sitting and they made their way over to the machine, Tony and Bruce running their fingers over the dome.
“That’s because coffee doesn’t drag me away from my work to do boring stuff.” Steve rolled his eyes again and chuckled, pressing a kiss to Tony’s temple, nuzzling his nose into Tony's hair.
It was ridiculously adorable and Toni couldn't help but find him super sweet. And his own awkward attempts at flirting back at her were equally sweet and adorable because it was so clear that he didn't know what he was doing.
Clint sat down on the bench-like seats and looked over the dome. He grimaced and looked up at the others. “Well, it’ll feel a little weird to have this huge dome in front of you if we have to eat here. You can barely see over the top of this thing.” Thor tilted his head and looked it over.
“Maybe it’s just some military training exercise or something? We should be safe here.” Bruce shook his head; his breathing getting quicker and already feeling the stress, panic and claustrophobia make him a mess of nerves and fear.
“Hey babe.” He sat down on the armrest of the couch and kissed Steve’s temple. “So, I know it’s early, but really can’t wait till tonight, so… I got you a present.”
“What’s wrong, love?” He kept his voice soft and concerned, hoping it might help Tony ease up a little, but he still stiff and didn’t move from his spot by the elevator.
“Oops, sorry Cunt, I didn’t you there. Are you okay?” His voice was very obviously mocking him and his friends laughed even harder. Clint narrowed his eyes at the nickname and the mocking before getting back up on his feet, glaring at Rumlow.
“Yeah but we have to try something, right? Or else we might be trapped here for who knows how long.” He moved to sit down in one of the middle chairs. “Let’s just have a look-“ But just as he sat down, and before he could touch or look at anything, the lights went off and everything started to beep and blink as an electric buzzing went off. Tony flew up from his chair, only a second after Thor and everyone quickly moved away from the panel as everything seemed to boot up.
“Tony? Sweetheart, what’s wrong? What happened that I need to forgive you for?” Tony squirmed uncomfortably under Steve’s gaze, the hand that Steve wasn’t holding clenched tightly. He took a breath, visibly bracing himself before looking up at Steve, a few strands of hair hanging over his face.
Steve chuckled and pressed a kiss to Tony’s forehead. “Well, I’ll buy you a new toothbrush and toothpaste before we get home then. But before that, I have something I have to ask you.” He squeezed the hand he was still holding before letting go and taking a small step back.
“But hey, camp will be so much safer than flying through space or maybe getting stuck on some hostile planet, right?” Bruce head whipped back and forth between the other kids before raising his arms and raising his voice.
He had dated other people before Steve, of course he had, but no one had ever been like Steve. Steve, who was loving, caring and kind and the sweetest and most amazing man on the planet. Steve, who was honest and sincere, utterly devoted to Tony and making sure he was happy, either by making him coffee every morning before he went to class or making sure he ate and slept somewhat regularly. Steve, who told Tony he loved him every single day and kissed him good morning and good night.
Tony laughed both in surprise and delight, wrapping his legs around Steve’s waist and his arms around Steve’s neck. He leans in as close as he can to Steve’s face, so close that their noses are touching, and whispers into his ear, “Well then, give away, soldier.”
“So, anything else you need me to help you with? Need more ego boosting? Maybe another hug or for me to march over to Steve and tell him to be nice to you, ‘cause I will, you know I will. Yeah he might be big and strong, but I’m tougher than I look! I can totally K.O him if he hurts you Toni and I will if he does!”
Clint smirked and leaned over the gap between them to hear Tony better. “Oh yeah, I sure didn’t beg my dad to go this this lame camp.” He stretched out his hand for Tony to take. “Clint Barton by the way. We go to the same school.” Tony smiled and took his hand, shaking it.
A somewhat human form appeared on the screen, with two legs, two arms and a small head, only it also had big wings that looked like big butterfly wings. And it also had a strange glow around it.
It didn’t answer any of Steve’s questions, but he just rolled his eyes before closing them. He heard Tony walking towards the door and heard him say, “Don’t let him cheat” before he walked out of the room.
“Uh, yeah, I’m okay. I just… I don’t really like tight spaces is all, I needed to breathe a little.”
“The homework you were gonna do for us, remember?” Homework? It was the last day of school, the grades were already set so what were they talking about? He shook his head and gripped his books tighter.
When Natasha opened her eyes again she didn't see the forest anymore. Or the road they had been standing on before. In fact, nothing she saw was close to where they been before. She carefully got her fingers out of her ears and started to move around to see how it looked.
Tony, while still working as a car mechanic, started to plan out starting a company of his own along with a few friends, since his father had more or less disowned him for dating Steve and rejecting Stark Industries and its legacy. It wasn’t much at the moment, just an idea, but Tony really had his goals set on working with technology and especially with green energy.
Tony ran a finger over the golden band and the diamond and then looked up at Steve again. He smiled softly at him, and then he smirked and hip checked Steve in the side. “You realize that if dad ever finds out about this he’ll skin you alive, chop your balls off and turn them into Christmas ornaments, right? He hates your guts enough as it is, probably blames you for my decision to turn my back on the company.”
“What did you do?!” Bruce came running up to him and Tony raised his hands defensively while shaking his head furiously.
Well, Tony was kind of an asshole at times, but in some weird way Bruce found himself laughing at his jokes more often than getting angry at his rudeness or his reckless antics. It was weird, but maybe he was just playing it up. Bruce had heard a whole lot of rumors about Tony Stark, but he didn’t really pay much attention to rumors. And considering the rumors that were floating around about him, he knew that most rumors were just bullshit anyway.
“I don’t regret saying yes to any of it. I don’t regret going on that first date back in high school, I don’t regret moving in together in Boston and I really don’t regret accepting your proposal. I don’t care what he has to say, I love you and that trumps him disapproving of us and everything else he thinks of me. He might think that I’m throwing my life away and that I’m just rebelling against him for the hell of it and we’ll never last for longer than a year or whatever but I know better.”
He paused and looked down at the floor, suddenly looking smaller and not quite as confident as he usually did.
“What does this mean? Have we been transported to some sort of space center?” Tony snorted and shrugged his shoulders, never looking away from the window.
But Loki was really, really enjoying the fact that Thor would be sent away for the whole summer, which meant he would be allowed to do whatever he wanted without him butting in the whole time.
Bucky just groaned and moaned “Coffee…” into his arms. “Need it now.” Steve snorted and put down his pen and grabbed a big mug and filled it with newly brewed coffee with a few drops of milk and two sugars, just like Bucky always wanted it. He also got a freshly baked blueberry scone out on a plate before placing it by his best friend’s arms.
They stayed like that for a few minutes before Tony slowly pulled away and pressed a kiss to his temple. "You hungry? Natasha said you hadn't eaten anything since lunch." Steve opened his mouth to answer, when his stomach interrupted and made a loud, dying whale sound that could probably be heard throughout the whole floor.
Tony smiled widely and raised his hands to Steve’s face, gently stroking the apples of his cheeks and tried to wipe away his tears- though that turned out to be rather futile as more tears just kept coming anyway- which made Steve’s smile widen back at him and put his own hands over Tony’s as he leaned into his touch, squeezing them tightly and pressing them to his face.
through that too tight t-shirt. His hair was golden and playfully tousled and he had big blue eyes, about as blue as a summer sky or the ocean.
“Steve, people are looking!” Not that Tony actually minded that people looked, they could stare all they wanted for all he cared, but he still couldn’t help flushing at Steve’s very open affections for him. PDA got nothing on Steve Rogers.
“Hey Tony. We just wanted to talk a little, you know, like friends do.” Tony only barely managed to hold himself back from visibly shuddering, because the way he said the word ‘friends’ made his skin crawl. It always did.
He walked over to her, trying be be suave and rested his elbows on the counter, looking her straight in the eyes. “Well in that case, Miss Stark, if I may say so, you are a quite fine specimen yourself.” She laughed softly and leaned in closer to him, her smile seductive.
“What homework?” Ross narrowed his eyes at him and turned towards him, while still blocking his way. He was also much taller than him bigger with more muscle mass than him.
"Steve, seriously-" Sam was now looking at her a lot more than at Steve and was just seconds away from making that slicing movement over his throat to make him shut him, but Steve didn't even look at him.
“Oh yeah? Well, look how the tables have turned now, Stark! Who’s the shrimp now?” They laughed and Tony kept trying to wriggle out of Steve’s grip and Steve kept tickling him or rub his knuckles against Tony’s skull.
Bruce sighed again and leaned his forehead against the window, his glasses slipping down his nose slightly.
“You drive a hard bargain Rogers. And you fight dirty, using my love for caffeine against me like this.” Steve rolled his eyes fondly and put an arm around his boyfriend’s shoulders, hugging him close.
“Uh…” Bruce looked over to the green button, finger hovering inches the button, when Steve grabbed his other shoulder.
And sure, he probably didn't make it better with his obnoxious attitude and big ego, but it was better than the alternative.
But she just smiled at him and tried to look as calming and reassuring as she could, squeezing his hand between her own. "I would love to, Steve. How about we meet up here, maybe around 7pm?"
“Right, so two of us can drive a car. And you think that you can just learn to drive a space ship just like that? If we actually say yes to this, there will be no going back. At least on summer camp we’ll still be on Earth and have contact with our friends and families.”
It was not a big dog and once full-grown would probably be medium-sized dog. But he was clearly full of energy and would be great to take out into Central Park for walks, when he went for a run in the mornings or just to play Frisbee or fetch with. He also seemed to love people, which was great since the tower was never empty and getting along with his friends and his husband was vital. Though he was still a puppy and acted much like puppies do, Steve had no doubts that he would be a very, very good dog.
Sam looked over his shoulder and saw her, paled a little and turned back to Steve with apprehensive eyes. "Steve…"
Thankfully Steve had dealt with most of the dishes from cooking before Tony had gotten there, so most of it was placing plates and cutlery in the dishwasher, dish the stuff that didn’t fit in there and putting stuff away, so it didn’t take that long. But apparently Steve got impatient after a while, and as Tony was drying the big salad bowl he felt Steve’s strong arms wrap around his from behind, his hands on Tony’s stomach and his chin resting on Tony’s shoulder.
to be more exciting than summer camp, right? But still… I can’t help but wonder what exactly this mission is about. That Watcher guy didn’t tell us anything about it other than that it’s secret and important, but that could mean anything!” He then shrugged weakly and looked over at Tony, who along with Clint and Thor was inspecting the big hair dryer machine. “Besides, I’m not exactly jumping at the thought of spending my summer this close to Tony Stark.”
Dad jerked his thumb towards the door. “Cab’ll be here ‘n a few min’uts. J’st go ‘n wait outs’de.” Bruce nodded and gave him a quick hug before going out.
Tony rolled his eyes again and swore as he tried to fix the engine while also holding up his phone for light. “Well, either way this damn hunk of junk isn’t going to be much help for us. From what I can see it would need tools to fix it that this driver thought to bring along for the trip.” He swore again and kicked at it before slamming to hood back down as hard as he could.
“You won’t have to many open spaces in space, you know. Your claustrophobia won’t like this cramped ship, right?” Bruce bit his lip and eyed the red button, but then Clint ran up and grabbed his shoulder.
"Hey Jan, you busy? Um, well you see I… uh, I kinda have a date tonight. I might need a little advice."
AC/DC was blasting from the speakers at a volume so high that Steve, with his enhanced hearing, winced viciously and almost covered his ears. Almost a year of dating and he still hadn’t gotten used to how loud Tony played his music. Or his music.
But dad had been acting very strange when he had said this, almost like he was in a trance, so Bruce had just thought that he had been on the sauce and if that was the case, it was better to not question any of it and he had gone to his room to pack. Not there was much for him to pack, just some clothes, a few books and some other things, like his phone, headphones and a small bag of weed.
Or how Tony Stark, the only kid who was more slut-shamed than her, was a virgin, just like her. Poor guy was probably the most hated guy in school for no good reason other than he was born in a rich and powerful family.
“Aw, come on baby, don’t be like that. You know I love you, but I’m not going to let you go without eating and sleeping. You should know that by now.” Tony grumbled and tried to pull away from Steve again, turning his face away when Steve tried to kiss him again.
“I think I’ll allow that. Just this once.” Tony huffed a small laugh and rested his head in the crock of Steve’s neck. Then Steve blinked and looked down at Tony. “Wait. Dodger?” Tony looked up and nodded.
“I got no business being anywhere near someone like Toni. She’s destined to meet and marry some other genius or a lawyer or a doctor or some other successful businessman out there. She can literally have her pick with anyone!”
Steve plumped down on his bed, only barely avoiding sitting on the bag he was in the middle of packing. "Couldn't you just, I don't know, come to the camp when you get well? Like, wait a week or two and come then? It's just a flu, you'll get better soon, right?"
“Oh I know, but that name’s hardly better. Would you prefer Circus Freak, you little bastard?” Clint froze up and turned to look at him, indignation quickly turning into anger. He clenched his fists and turned to look at him, holding himself back from storm up to the guy.
Steve jumped almost a foot in the air and turned around, his eyes wide and his mouth hanging open, making for a rather funny sight but she wasn't in the mood to laugh right now. She kept her face as straight as possible and hoped it would be enough to make him nervous.
Steve pressed kisses on every inch of skin he could reach, arms tightly wrapped around his waist spinning him around for a good minute before putting Tony down on his feet again, though Tony still had his arms around Steve’s neck and Steve placed his hands on his hips. He had a big, blinding smile and tears in his eyes.
a freak! Go back to the woods and fjords, you fucking Viking freak!” Then he turned tail and hurried away. And as Thor looked after him he started to hear the words Viking freak being whispered around him and other students were either laughing at him or glaring angrily at him.
He heard Clint snort somewhere around him. “Looks like you’ve got yourself a new best friend, Cap. Tony might actually have to fight him for your attention.” Steve couldn’t answer; he just laughed and scratched the puppy over the back.
mean every single word she just said. She really liked him back and, as scared as she was, she wanted to at least give him a chance to surprise her. To see if he really was a nice guy and could treat her as well as he said he wanted to.
He got up from the bed and gathered up his small toolbox and his smaller projects, shoving them into a small duffle bag. If he had to be stuck at that fucking camp, might as well bring some things he could work on while trying to hide from the 'playful raccoons' and the 'amazing fun' that they promised.
“No, I can’t stand these tight spaces! I think we’d be much safer outside!” As he spoke he found himself having yell, as the sound had gotten incredibly loud and they all had to speak louder in order to be heard over it. Natasha looked over at him, her face strained and her voice almost a yell now.
“Okay, so what we wanna do here is make you look nice but not too much so you scare him off before you actually go on the date. Since you never actually said anything about it being fancy, we’ll have to assume it’s somewhat casual. But you also want to make yourself look nice and presentable so you look like you’re taking this seriously. If you show up on a first date with a t-shirt, jeans and unwashed hair, you’ll look like you don’t care about it, which is never how you want to start a date.” She looked over a blue dress with a low neckline and a very high slit, shook her head and hung it back before going back to looking.
“Yeah? Well, while you work on that…” Then he leaned down, raised his hands gently and cradled Tony’s face in his hands, stroking his thumbs over his cheeks. “Maybe I could treat my best fella to a coffee? Maybe a treat?” Tony looked up at him with a raised eyebrow and a smirk.
"I'm counting on it, Rogers. Otherwise I'll hunt you down and drag you out with me." And then, before she could stop herself or overthink it, she pressed a kiss to his cheek before she pulled away, grabbed her bag and got up from her seat.
It was surprisingly close that Tony won, which was probably due to his head start, but Steve eventually caught up with him, grabbed him around the waist and yanked him back and gently threw him to the side, making him stumble a little. ("Hey!") Which gave Steve enough time to start running again and he got to the coffeehouse first.
Eventually Tony gently pulled away from Steve’s chest and seemed to have calmed down, though there were still a few sniffles and he rubbed at his eyes and nose. His eyes were red and still wet with tears, but he was breathing a little easier now and his sobbing had subsided.
Tony had of course not liked this. How could he? Another ten months of his boyfriend putting himself in danger and possibly dying in some morgue in Syria, yeah wasn’t that the dream of every young man in the world? But, of course, he’d eventually been forced to accept it all and had driven Steve to the airport a few weeks later, followed him to the security check and hugged and kissed him goodbye. It had taken all of Tony’s strength not to break down into a sobbing mess on the floor when Steve had placed his dog tags around his neck, like he always did before leaving for a tour, and had given him one last kiss before leaving and disappearing into the crowd, leaving Tony to drive home to an empty apartment.
And while Steve had started out being skinny and shorter than Tony, he eventually hit a major growth spurt and shot past Tony and grew muscles in places Tony didn’t know
Holy fuck, she hadn't been on a real date in years and she had very good reasons for not wanting to date and stay away from commitment. With anyone. She couldn't do this; it would only end in tears! She should turn back and say that she just remembered that had a thing tonight and couldn't make it and just never bring up the idea of a date ever again. Maybe he would forget about and they could just stay as good friends and-
Steve rolled his eyes and put the magazine down and looked up at Tony, trying to look annoyed but couldn’t help the fond amusement he was feeling. “Okay, so what did you do this time?” Tony gasped in mock offence and pulled away with a hand over his arc-reactor.
Then again, what if it did turn out amazing? What if he could see past everything others saw as wrong with her and grow to love her as she was? What if he really was sweet and kind despite every flaw and fault she had?
“Oh I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that, my hearing aids don’t pick up idiocy very well.” There were fewer snickers this time, but he didn’t really care about that, he just wanted to stick it to this asshole. Rumlow snorted and walked up closer to him.
Hulk just grumbled. “You gonna keep playing, Goldilocks?” And then the sounds of the TV and the video game started again. Steve just shook his head and a small smile spread over his face or hearing her talk.
"Sorry Buck, I hate to sound so self-pitying when you're the one who's sick and will be home alone for weeks. But it was the only good thing about this stupid camp thing was us being together for the summer. How will I survive without you there to keep me sane?"
The first few days had been torture and had spent a lot of time in bed, on the couch watching TV or sleeping through his classes at MIT. But eventually he’d been forced to get off his ass and get his life back on track. He went to his classes, got his second PhD at MIT and started to work on getting a third one while also working his part-time job as a car mechanic. He hung out with his friends one occasion, as they graduated all college and started to live their own busy adult lives. He hung out with Rhodey and helped him pick out an engagement ring for Carol and eventually try to propose (she totally beat him to it!), he, Clint, Rhodey, Sam and Thor had their Guys’ Night once a week, either getting drinks at a bar or went bowling or whatever and he bonded with Natasha over having your boyfriend overseas while they were stuck at home not knowing what was happening to their significant other. Though Tony couldn’t help but feel jealous of her, since Bucky was still home had already left the army on account of his amputated arm from his last tour.
But Steve just cut him off and his voice rose in volume slightly. "I've got no business being anywhere near someone like Toni. She's destined to meet and marry some other genius or a lawyer or a doctor or some other successful businessman out there. She can literally have her pick with anyone!"
Steve looked down at his husband, then over at his dog, which was now playing with Sam, who had produced a small rubber ball from somewhere and was throwing it around the room for the puppy to chase after. He smiled fondly and kissed Tony on the forehead.
Loki grinned and leaned back against the wall, still clutching the stuffed toy and making it wave its paw at him. “I am going to do what I have always wanted to do; spend some time far away for you and do whatever I feel like doing, without you here to drag me to play with sports or competitions or whatever you want to do. See, that is the beauty of it all. Since you have no friends and have forced me to whatever you want to do with you, and you will spend your summer away from me, I will finally be able to do whatever I want to.”
She sighed, got off the toilet and carefully got out of the cubicle and shook off the trash and water from her umbrella before drying it off and putting it back in her bag. The fact that the ‘throw-water-and-trash-at-Natasha’ thing had happened so many times over the past year that she had
“Steve.” He whispered into his boyfriend’s neck, only barely keeping his sobs at bay, though when he heard, and felt, that Steve was also struggling to hold back his own tears it felt a little easier to release them.
“I heard the end of it.” He admitted. Tony bit his lip and kept his eyes locked on his feet. Steve felt his heart clench at the sad, hurt look on his face and shuffled a little bit closer to him. “How bad was it?”
“What is this, some kind of movie set?” Natasha laughed, the laugh equally as breathless and weak as her brother’s and placed a hand on his shoulder.
A few tears finally managed to slip out of the corners of Tony’s eyes and his shaky voice was interrupted with a few sobs. “I-I… I s-swear S-Steve, I-I wanted t-to f-fight him off. I-I d-didn’t want him to touch me or kiss me, bu-but i-it w-was like I was f-fourteen years old again, I-I just… c-couldn’t. It w-was like m-my own b-body stopped w-working and I-I couldn’t get away o-on my own-”
But he barely had time to say anything before Ross and Blonsky straightened back up and started to yell at Tony for not looking where he was going and being blind and stupid and ‘did those fucking glasses not make him see what was right in fucking front of him!’ While Tony was standing there ‘apologizing’ to them, he turned to Bruce and motioned with his head at him to get going while the two guys still yelled him. Bruce mouthed a quick, ‘thank you’ to him before quickly running off towards his next class.
Steve huffed out a laugh and wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, pulling him close and resting his forehead against Tony’s, their noses almost touching. “Well, I may be an idiot but I’m
looked like a soaked cat now. He brushed some of the wet strands of his blonde hair out of his eyes, and had to keep blinking his own eyes to keep the raindrops out of them.
When the hour was up, the kids gathered around the podium again as the lights went off again, the screen reappeared and the Watcher’s strange alien form appeared in front of them.
Steve was dressed in his army uniform, sans the hat, his blonde hair was a shaggy and messy and he had grown a scruffy beard in the time he had been gone. He had no visible injuries, bruises or abrasions on his person and though he looked a bit leaner than he had been since Tony last saw him he looked fairly alright considering the circumstances, aside from his eyes and face being wet and red with tears.
"I don't think I can, Jarvis. I'm bad at making friends, you know that." Jarvis squeezed his shoulder and stood up.
Bucky rolled his eyes with another groan. “Well, I guess I’m not needed anymore. I’m gonna go check out what Natasha’s up to.” He turned to glare at his friend. “Maybe
“… You remember I told you about Ty, right?” Steve felt himself tense up for a second, his grip on Tony’s hand tightening slightly. Oh yes, Tiberius Stone, Tony’s ex from MIT. Tony had told Steve about him a few months after they started dating. He had told him that Ty had seemed like a really cool guy, smart and strong and driven, but always affectionate and caring. He had swept Tony off his feet from the first second, and Tony- being a naïve fourteen-year-old- had believed it was true love. That it was meant to be. Only to eventually realize that Ty was abusive and controlling and clearly didn’t care about Tony’s well-being or security. And while Tony had never outright said it, he had implied that Ty had forced him to have sex before he felt ready or comfortable.
“I... uh, I never got the chance to ask if you were okay from yesterday.” Bruce immediately remembered what Tony was referring to and nodded with a grateful smile.
“I’m trying to figure out if this computer can tell us what to do!” Tony glared at him from the middle chair, clutching something that looked like a big joystick.
“Come on, we need to try and get out of the way!” Tony yelled to be heard over the alarms and the robotic voice that kept repeating
“Yeah? Are you any good?” And before he could react, she reached out and snatched the napkin he had been sketching on and looked it over. Her face softened a little as she looked at his little drawing and when she looked up again she looked more genuine. “This is good. You drew this?”
“…Yes. Bathroom,” Tony repeated, a little bewildered, “It’s a room. To go. I—y’know, I’m not surprised at all that they didn’t give you a bathroom to use. I don’t know why I’m surprised.”
Finally spotting Fury exiting the craft, Tony looked down at the kid then back up, thinking of a million ways to try and explain
Steve re-opened the book and carefully looked over the diagram, noting Tony’s scrawl on the bottom corner:
“You have been holding out on me,” he purred, loving how the shirt accentuated his small waist and showed just a hint of bosom, “You look like a
“Is this about the feeding?” Bruce asked quietly, gaining an answer through Tony’s silence, “Tony, you do not have to feed Peter from your breast, but the other option is to forcibly remove your milk from your body with a type of pump—it is quite uncomfortable and more embarrassing than anything you could be put through. If you leave it be, the milk will curdle and become quite infected. We have had Omegas die from the infection spreading.”
He poked Tony’s chest again, looking up at him with wide, expectant eyes. Tony was baffled, and it probably showed, so he shook his head and shrugged.
He turned, beaming as Steve barreled into him, hugging him tightly. Tony returned the hug, burying his face in Steve’s neck for the second time.
“Whatever you say, darling. I’ll be right back. Make sure you eat the fruit, too,” Steve said, pushing the bowl of strawberries and blueberries closer to Tony.
Scooping PJ up into his arms, Tony grumbled as he slipped on his moccasin slippers, raising an eyebrow at Steve still in his bed.
He choked on his words when Peter latched onto his already sore nipple, hissing at the aching pain that shot through his chest. First, he settled into the bath, then he gently pulled Peter away, cradling the babe in his other arm and moving him back up to his chest. On instinct, Pete found his other nipple and began to feed, eyes slipping shut and small hands holding tight to his chest hair.
“Yeah. JARVIS, order books for PJ that are for one to two-year-olds,” Bruce said, returning to his microscope, “And perhaps mini learning tools, like paper and markers, blocks, that sort of thing.”
“I was required to take lessons on it, in case I ever needed to patch myself up,” he said carefully.
“I’m guessing you won’t lube your fist first? I don’t blame you,” Bucky said, propping his feet up on the bed, only to have Rhodey smack his legs, “Hey!”
“God, honey, I’m so sorry,” he whispered, reaching down to cup Tony’s cheek and brush his thumb over his scraped cheekbone, “Look at you—I should have been there to protect you, this is all my fault, if I’d told you sooner you wouldn’t be in this mess—”
He bid the group farewell and left the others standing in silence, staring at Steve still struggling in his binds. Bucky shook his head and followed Thor, then was quickly joined by Clint and Sam.
“How would you know how much cock you can take?” Steve asked bluntly, grabbing Tony’s cock to stroke roughly, pushing his thumbnail into the slit in the head just to hear Tony moan loudly, “Have you ridden others? Taken their fat cocks deep in you?”
