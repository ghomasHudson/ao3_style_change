” Bucky’s memory says, putting words to Steve’s thoughts. “
Sam also has some very persistent cousins, one of whom seems to have set her mind on Steve with a determination that is as admirable as it is disturbing. She seeks him out for conversation, although Steve knows he cannot be any great entertainment for her, and she volunteers to show him all her accomplishments. She plays the piano well, but Steve cannot find anything more than a polite admiration for it.
“But she plays the piano
Steve hears the music before he even enters the house. The tinkling notes on the air in a haunting melody that makes his heart skip a beat and his breath catch in his throat. It seems to come from the world itself, at first, and in a strange flight of fancy, he wonders if one of the fair folk his mother warned him of has finally come to take him away. There is a strange relief in the idea.
“Of… of course,” Steve says, stepping back towards the conversation.
Steve blinks, then looks up at the jagged hole in the ceiling. A grin spreads across his face.
“We have talked about this, Sam,” Steve says, making his voice as stern as he can manage. “There is no question of marriage.”
“Thank you,” Steve says.
“Please,” Steve says. “If any rumours are about, it will be because you have started them.”
“Is that what you do?” he asks.
“Certainly,” Steve says. He cannot doubt that they know Fury, and this is just like the man. To have people already in place and not to tell Steve a word of it. He takes the book and sets it on the table and watches as Mrs Romanoff flips it open and immediately sees the end paper peeling away, pulling out the documents. Mr Barton crosses over and takes them after Mrs Romanoff has examined them.
That is Tony’s groom and that is the Stark carriage.
Nothing seems to work after that, though. His ideas are faulty, his plans too complicated. He cannot concentrate.
,” Bucky’s ghost says. Steve can almost see him leaning back against the balustrade next to him. They could have come here, Steve thinks, sudden and blindingly painfully. This had been Howard’s house and he had invited them all around. In another world, in another time, he would not have been alone in the sea of strangers, he would have been surrounded by friends. His heart aches for something he will never have and he feels the loss of it all over again. That is what he has found. The grief does not go away, it merely hides itself somewhat and waits for a moment like this to seize his breath again and stab him deep once more. Every time it feels fresh, every time it makes his heart stop momentarily in his chest, as though it is trying to join the others.
“Right,” he says in a voice that suggests he does not understand at all. “Perhaps this conversation would be easier if you were to actually state your purpose, rather than telling me how you wish it were unnecessary.”
“Pompous, condescending ass,” Barton supplies. There is a laden silence where no one contradicts him.
“I cannot let this continue.”
He is halfway through when Sam walks in, taking in the scene: Steve seated on the sofa, listening, rapt, to Sir Anthony’s playing. He gives Steve a knowing look that makes Steve blush right to the roots of his hair, but he too sits down and applauds politely as Sir Anthony finishes the piece.
“I wasn’t really paying attention. They might have done. Who are they?”
“They were,” Steve agrees. “I have a copy, I should…”
“It is what you pay us for,” Mr Murdock says, another small amused smile on his face.
Steve considers this for a moment, then nods. It is possible, in an unlikely sort of way, that whatever is being smuggled is somehow connected to the wedding rings, but he’ll take that chance.
It would be easier if he liked her. He can tell from the looks Sam’s aunt and grandmother give him that he is being judged and valued, like a piece of meat. It is not obvious, but there is a sense there that he is an eligible bachelor and while they are subtle enough in their attempts to matchmake, Steve feels on display. So he hides, and Sam finds him to commiserate with him.
“Dancing, or pretending that he’s having a good time?” Steve asks before he can stop his big mouth. Her comment draws his eyes to Sir Anthony, who is now dancing with another young man who stares at him with astonishment.
Steve feels a thrill in his chest, like the flutter before a battle. This place is secret. It is different. He sets the lamp on the desk and leans down to the chest. It is locked with a heavy padlock, but Steve takes a moment to snap it open and pulls up the heavy lid. The hinges let out a low, sad groan as they are put to use for the first time in decades.
“A bit of spirit is never a bad thing,” Steve says.
“How could I enjoy myself if you- if any of my guests were not enjoying themselves? It is my duty as a host.”
He heard the movement of another fist flying through the air as he turned around and he ducked, seeing the unknown male’s fist crash into the side of the carriage with a force that must have broken bones.
” Bucky’s ghost tells him.
“Yes,” Sam agrees. “So he is looking for something as well.”
It is a silly idea, a fanciful whim, but his heart is thumping double time in his chest and - with the mask on - there is a sense of freedom, a lightness that comes into his spirit.
“I think that’s our only option,” Sam tells him, leaning back in his seat, his face screwed up in thought. Steve is grateful to see that the idea sits poorly with him as well. Steve doesn’t disagree. He has no love for the crown itself, but he does love his country. He fought for his country and for the freedom that it stands for. To have gone through all that and to return home to find it threatened from within…
will be put into dock and they will return to their lives.
“Dangerous, perhaps. But freeing,” Sir Anthony says, whirling around on him. “Do you ever wish… wish that you could throw away all the traditions and courtesies and just… run off and become a highwayman, or… something else?”
“Excuse me, gentlemen,” he says as the carriage skids to a halt. “Please keep your hands where I can see them. I don’t want to hurt anyone.” He cocks his own pistol.
“I am not sure this conversation is appropriate,” Steve says, arching an eyebrow at her. She mirrors the expression.
“No, no…” Sir Anthony says. “But I fear that sometimes the rules are less for our benefit and more a trap.”
Finally footsteps come again and Steve looks down to see Mr Jarvis mounting the stairs towards him again.
Once Steve has said yes, Sir Anthony becomes even more of an unstoppable force. The house is a flurry of activity. Servants are hired, sheets are removed and the china and silverware are pulled out of storage. Steve is at the centre of a domestic hurricane as he comes to terms with the fact that he knows nothing about housekeeping whatsoever.
Or maybe he had.
There should be children running around, getting underfoot. There should be Bucky’s warm hand on his shoulder. This place used to be lively and as bustling as a marketplace, but now it’s as quiet as a tomb.
The first email, he’d ignored. He’s got better at sifting through the more ridiculous things to find the coverups he can actually stop. Sometimes it’s a racist trying to convince him that [insert minority here] is destroying society. Sometimes it’s just a person who needs help of a more medical or psychiatric nature. Often it’s a kid who thinks it's funny to troll the ‘Iron Billionaire’ guy. But then there had been the second email. And the third. And the first phone call from an unknown number. And a second.
Steve shifts uncomfortably in his coat again, flushing a little as he turns to the tailor, who is eying up his body like a cut of meat.
“If I have to hear another word about how accomplished she is, I’ll run off with the travelling players,” Sam says.
“Oh, Nat and I go way back,” Mr Barton says. Steve’s eyebrows rise at the informality, even as Mrs Romanoff gives a long-suffering sigh.
,” Bucky says. “
Before he goes, he grabs Tony’s hand and bows as he raises it to his lips, keeping his eyes on Tony’s the whole time.
It is only a small gathering, Ms Van Dyne, her husband, and Mrs Romanoff, but the small party is quite cheerful and it is relaxing to be among people who feel little need to try to impress anyone. They pass a merry afternoon before Steve bids them farewell. Sam once again has business with the local falconer, but Steve wishes to return to his sketching, so he heads straight for Lakefield
“Things are never simple with you, are they?” he asks. Steve sighs and shakes his head.
“In my experience, that is not true,” Steve says, “I have met many wealthy men and there were few - if any - who would have given a humble soldier even a fraction of what you have given me.”
There is no rest from the thudding of his heartbeat until the militia are far away from him. He is grateful they did not bring any dogs, for they would surely have sniffed him out. He is not sure if he will be so lucky next time. But perhaps there will not need to be a next time. He looks at the bag clasped in his hand. It is possible that this is all at an end. He knows the faces of those two now, he knows their voices. He may not have got their names, but he may have seized what they were delivering, and that itself may be enough.
” and, oh, there is Peggy’s voice, calming and steady. “
Sir Anthony looks at him, his eyes are brown and deeper than Steve can fathom, looking at Steve like there is something he wants to say, something that Steve should be able to understand just from looking into those large dark eyes, but he cannot translate.
“Not at all,” Steve says automatically.
The insinuation is clear and Steve can’t help but blush at it a little.
“Magical,” Steve echoes. He has seen magic. It has never conjured the sort of awe that Captain Wilson is implying. But then, he hasn’t exactly seen it at its best. There must be something in his voice, because Captain Wilson’s eyes narrow slightly and he nods, his face becoming a little more sombre. He walks over to stand against the rail as well, leaning against the wood with a relaxation that Steve cannot find in himself.
, but they both know the words are there, caught behind his lips.
“We appear to be talking at cross purposes. We are not your enemies,” Mrs Romanoff says.
Living in a machine doesn’t sound like much of a life to Steve. He wonders how scared you have to be of dying to lock yourself into a computer.
“My… My…” Steve tries to get his breathing under control, but the dust and the movement and the whole thing is just tangling around his airway and he can’t… “pho… phone,” he manages to get out.
“Indeed,” she says. “I didn’t mean to offend you, I only wished to give advice as you are new to the area as well. If you change your mind then-”
He has never known Sir Anthony at all. All this time, Steve has been falling in love while Sir Anthony has been betraying everything.
“Did you hear anything that might distinguish them?”
“Recognised their voices,” Steve says. “One of them shot at me-”
Before they had gone to war - before Azzano, Erskine, Stark, and the lot of it - before Hydra and Peggy, he and Bucky had used to talk sometimes of making their fortunes and becoming proper gentlemen. They had planned to settle down in some country home, get married and live like aristocrats.
Sam finds his copy, as Steve changes out of the Nomad outfit. At every second, Steve is expecting a knock on the door below, or shouting in the driveway as the militia come to demand an explanation, but none comes.
Upon reading the letter, Steve sits in the leather armchair in the library, astounded and overwhelmed. To have been handed a lifeline and had it snatched away in the same breath. It seems like there is nothing left at all of what he had lived before. The grief is flooding him. Howard is dead. How can it be true? The man had not been young, but he had by no means been infirm or of a delicate constitution. Dead. And no indication given as to the cause. The letter is abrupt on the matter. A stiffness perhaps born from grief. Steve does not think he could manage to write a good letter in such circumstances.
“I was in the army,” Steve points out, but Sam simply smirks at him.
Steve settles down against the wall, his back to the cool stone, and he reads and reads.
“I don’t know,” Steve admits. “I heard them talking outside about…” He lowers his voice and relates the conversation he overheard. Sam’s eyes grow wider by the second.
As soon as they leave his hand, Steve dives to the side, twisting into a somersault and then a flip, to make himself more difficult to hit, though nothing seems to be aimed at him, so he runs instead, not looking back. No footsteps follow him.
He does not like how close the man is to Tony, though. Whatever Barton’s ulterior motives, Steve is sure that the baronet is unaware of them, and that thought sets his teeth on edge.
“Do we not at least get your name?” Tony asks and Steve turns as he mounts Liberty.
“Stane,” Steve says. Mrs Romanoff’s eyes harden for a second.
Steve grimaces. Bucky had always been the infiltration expert on their team. He had been able to sneak past an entire camp full of soldiers if he wished, and be completely unseen. He had indeed tried to teach Steve the finer points of stealth, but they had never quite caught on. Even when he was smaller, Steve had never been able to go unnoticed, although that was more the fault of his mouth than his appearance. And sneaking had never been his style. He prefers to be upfront about these things.
There are a few likely places. The road is not straight and the twists and bends allow for cover. Steve is sketching out a battlemap of the third such location when he hears the sound of hooves on the road with a start.
“Sir Anthony offers his apologies, but he is busy at present.”
“Not that either of those makes much difference to your funds,” the solicitor continues. “What is it you wish to do with the rest?”
“It’s a two day ride at a civilised pace,” Sam tells him. “And there is an inn we can stop at tonight. It’s not exactly homely, but we’ve slept in worse places.”
Steve should, but nothing is missing and he and Sam have somewhere they need to be.
But it is as if everything is just that much smaller than when he last saw it. The paint peels morosely off his windowsill, the dark bricks have crumbled a little more, and his footsteps seem too loud. Military boots, no doubt.
“Mrs Hogan,” Tony corrects. Steve forces himself away. He has no wish to eavesdrop on conversations, particularly those discussing the personal lives of strangers.
“There must be someone we can inform. The crown has people to deal with things like this,” Sam points out, reasonably.
“If you don’t want people to get hurt,” Tony’s voice says - and Steve looks up into the cocking of a pistol - “you really should find a different profession.” He gives a little grin.
“I did not mean-” he looks around the workshop, from the haphazard stacks of papers to the curious moving contraptions that whir and tick along in the background. “Clearly you are very intelligent. I did not mean to insult you.”
As Steve had noticed the first time they had made this journey, when they were newly arrived, it is a beautiful area. The woods are thick and old, so dense in places that you need to pick your path carefully or end up stranded in the underbrush.
Summer is coming to its close, the leaves beginning to fade from fresh green to crisp brown. It is a beautiful transition, and Steve takes out his paints, and settles in the music room window to try to capture the vista.
“You are welcome back at any time should you wish to make use of the piano again,” he says, before remembering the fine instrument up at the manor. “Although of course you would prefer to use your own, I am sure. The manor has a fine instrument.”
“You haven’t seen it used for war?” Steve asks. He would have thought even the airships - especially the airships maybe, with their grand aerial battles, powered by the magical cores - would have seen the savagery of magical warfare. Captain Wilson shrugs.
As they step away from Sir Anthony, Obadiah says, just a little more loudly than necessary: “his mother, Lady Maria, was an excellent hostess. Her parties were the talk of the county. But Tony takes after his father more, as I’m sure you’ve noticed.”
“The best sort of story,” Sam says and they look up to see him standing over them. “May I listen in?”
A heavy metal hand rests on his shoulder.
And whether it is Barton at all. Although Steve can think of no good explanation for Barton’s behaviour other than that. It is all very peculiar. Why had he been going through Steve’s saddle-bags? Why had he let Nomad go? How did he think that Nomad could be of assistance to him?
Sam is pacing the secret room as Steve limps in.
, Steve translates in his head, after Hydra had cut them down.
anything.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Steve tells him.
There is a whir of machinery as Iron Man crouches down and picks up the huge rock of rubble from the man’s stomach and tosses it aside as though it weighs nothing. Steve tries to nod, but he’s not sure he manages very well. He adjusts himself into a sitting position and concentrates as best he can on slowing his breathing. He’s done this before. He’s not going to survive Hydra and then let an asthma attack fuck him over. He’s fine. He just needs to breathe in…. And out… and in…
Naturally, as they are in Stark Manor, conversation turns to their host. Wealthy and titled, Sir Anthony must be considered the most eligible bachelor in the room, but it seems he does not line up with everyone’s expectations.
“If the rules or society, or tradition are responsible for harm to an innocent person, or for injustice in any form, then I have always thought it is our duty to do what is right.”
It takes Steve a moment to realise what Sam is talking about, then he recalls the rest of the letter. The bequest.
“I’d prefer to send it on myself,” Steve says, pulling it back towards himself. He may believe that they are working for Fury, but that doesn’t mean he trusts them. Mrs Romanoff appears amused by him.
“A sentiment I agree with whole-heartedly,” Tony says. “And I'm glad that I have found such good company today.”
“You’re right,” Steve says, glancing up at the sky. The clouds are beginning to gather, if they stay out much longer they will most likely be soaked. “There’s no way that would work.”
“Farewell, Captain,” Sir Anthony says, and then he is gone and it is too late to say anything.
“No need for that, either. But if you really want to thank me, you’ll take my wager that I can reach the far side of the field before you can, and you’ll let me win.”
The diagrams themselves are bad enough. He knows what they are - Tony’s latest designs for aether engines for the sky ships. He and Sam have been discussing ways to mitigate kickback for weeks. But it is the note stuffed in with them that makes his heart stop in his chest.
“If you insist,” Steve says.
“It would be a great coincidence for there to be two conspiracies going on at the same time,” Sam says, his voice thoughtful. “But while his actions are suspicious, they are not those I would expect from someone trying to cover up treason.”
No. He will not think that.
As Mr Jarvis turns at the bottom of the staircase, the banging changes to voices. Steve waits politely and doesn’t try to make out the words. He folds his hands behind his back instead and looks at the ornaments nearby.
“Mr Stane,” Steve says as they approach the threshold. “I fear we may have started our acquaintance on the wrong foot. Please rest assured that I do not mean Sir Anthony any harm and my intentions are only to support him as a friend of his father - as you do - and hopefully also as his friend in turn.”
But all these people have undoubtedly done this before.
, would not be so scared as to run away from your own household,” Sam says, as they ride out one morning to escape the furore. There is something in the way he says Steve’s title that gives Steve pause and he turns to him, eyes sharp. Sam is looking back at him, gaze steady and his mouth twisted up slightly with the smallest hint of amusement.
They arrive at the stables and Sir Anthony is greeted enthusiastically by the horse dealer. There is no standing on ceremony here, and Steve is astonished to see Sir Anthony strip off his coat and roll his shirt sleeves up as he proceeds to examine the horses himself.
“So this guy had your phone, did he have your inhaler as well?” Iron Man asks. There’s a strange waver to his voice and Steve realises that Iron Man isn’t being patronising - not intentionally at least. He’s worried. About Steve. Because Steve isn’t breathing properly. Yeah, that makes sense. He points to where he can see the strap of his bag sticking out from the rubble covering the guy.
“Whoever they are, their cargo of whatever sort has been delivered long ago,” Sam says.
“He has a point, Steve,” Sam says, unhelpfully.
“I did not wish to interrupt your enjoyment,” Steve says.
“Friends,” he agrees. The handshake is firm and strong. Steve can feel the calluses of hard word on Sir Anthony’s palm, and the strength that work has given him in his grip. But as soon as it has come, the contact has vanished and Steve is bereft of it.
“Captain Rogers,” she says with a nod. “The ladies are waiting in the parlour.”
Dinner that evening is a strange affair. Steve is keeping an eye on the clock, knowing that he has other appointments this evening, of a less pleasant nature.
“Not since I was a midshipman. Rank comes with privilege, Captain, as I’m sure you know. One of those privileges is a real bed - with a mattress as thin as a board and about as comfortable, and that you roll off given the slightest hint of turbulence.” Sam laughs. “I find it hard to sleep without the wind rocking me and blowing past my window like a banshee.”
“You cannot possibly think I should accept it,” Steve says, taken aback by the very idea.
“So soon?” Steve asks, unable to quite keep the disappointment out of his voice. The music has been wonderful, but they have had no chance to talk, and he wishes that they could.
“I told you that if you felt overwhelmed you were to give me a sign.” Sir Anthony looks away and Steve studies his profile. It would make a fine silhouette. “I would have rescued you,” Sir Anthony continues. “You didn't have to suffer alone.”
“They’re very skilled,” Steve says honestly.
we escape from the secret Hydra base,” Tony Stark suggests. “Do you need your inhaler again? You’re not looking too good.”
“Fascinating creatures,” Steve says. He holds the gaze of Tony’s warm brown eyes, which are squinting a bit in confusion.
” Bucky’s ghost tells him. “
“I’m not-” Steve realises his eyes have not yet left that place in the trees where Tony finally disappeared from sight. He drags his eyes away. “I’m not doing that,” he says.
“You may see the lights when we get a bit closer. It’s a magical sight, the golden glow beneath the clouds. Not a thing like it on the ground.”
“He’s not wrong,” Sam offers, and Steve makes a face, but can’t refute the statement. He has certainly never seen it disproved.
“Since I arrived here,” Steve says. “You have… I meant to say how grateful and honoured I was to have received your friendship and generosity, when we had never even met before I turned up on your doorstep. You have given me so much, though I have little to offer you in return besides my friendship, as insufficient as that may seem.”
“You haven’t?”
“Handwriting can be forged,” Mrs Romanoff says. “We do not work for Stark; we work for Lord Fury.”
“I'm just dressing,” Steve says, looking around frantically for somewhere to hide the mask and outfit. “I shall join you presently.”
He has finished his current books so he peruses the shelves, running his fingers over the thick leather spines. There is a peace here that grounds him.
“Of course, the more the merrier,” Ms Van Dyne says and Sam settles into a seat on her other side.
He’s uncovered embezzlement, brought about a recall of tainted medicine, and helped people get justice - and compensation - for things that should have never happened to them.
That was yesterday. So tonight Steve’s taking things into his own hands. He’s fully expecting to walk around a dusty, broken down old military base for the night. The biggest risk will probably be tetanus. Luckily his vaccines are up to date.
“Honestly, Tony. What’s the problem?” A woman’s voice asks, followed by a rumble of another man. Then there are three heads sticking out of the carriage. A red-headed woman, Tony, and another sturdy looking face of a man.
“Don’t you start,” Sam says with a sigh, going to fetch himself a drink from the decanter on the desk. “Steve, you have to rescue me.”
“It’s certainly his handwriting,” she says. “And his paper. But… if someone could have gained access to his plans, they could have gained access to anything else he has written as well.” She runs her finger along the feathery edge where the paper is torn. “This may have been part of a longer message that was torn away. We have no way of knowing. Your investigations have hardly been subtle.”
“You have been a thorn in our side for many years, Steve Rogers,” Zola says. On the screens around the centre - where Zola’s face still hangs, disembodied and pixellated - images flash of people Steve recognises, headlines he knows. They are cases he had investigated, crimes he had uncovered, CEOs he had brought down, people he had saved. There are articles from his blog as well. The contaminated drug he had stopped. The embezzlement he had uncovered. Steve stares. Zola is implying that all of those were connected? That someone organised them. That
“Scared?”
“Too much, too much,” Sir Anthony says. “Do you ever grow tired of saying the same words over and again? Captain Wilson has informed me that your wardrobe is in quite dire need of a change.”
They sit in silence, staring at it, until Sam reaches out and plucks another, smaller sliver of paper from the book, where Steve had overlooked it. It looks more like a scrap, torn off on each edge, and folded once.
“So when are we going to visit your new home, Captain Rogers?” Sam asks.
He hadn’t expected either of them to take off. But now the webcomic provides more than half of his annual income and the blog…
“Naturally,” Tony says, with a flash of a brittle grin. “I imagine it is difficult to find someone whose perfection matches your own.”
Seven years ago, when got his friend Scott to help him set up two websites, Steve hadn’t been expecting either of them to take off. He had figured that the webcomic would maybe get a handful of views and a couple of comics. The blog had really been more for him. His friends were getting sick of listening to his commentary on social injustice and someone - Steve thinks it was Peggy - had suggested he take his opinions online.
“I did it myself when I was fourteen,” Sam says as Steve places the bag down atop the desk. “I broke my arm and my knee swelled up like an overripe plum.” Steve grins. “But I can’t imagine Liberty throwing you, and you’re a better rider than most.”
Tony’s finger hangs in the air alongside the words, hoving for a moment, like he’s about to take Steve up on his offer.
“I thought you were an honest man. There is nothing simple about you, Captain.” He runs a hand across the heavy leather cover of the treatise on termites and sighs. “I have met simple people; I know simple people. You are most assuredly not one of them.” He turns back to Steve, his eyes sharp and piercing once more. The clear intelligence in them very nearly takes Steve’s breath away. It does make his heart speed up in his chest, although whether that is from fear of those sharp eyes seeing through him, or merely in response to the intensity of Tony looking at him
“I told you I would be down presently,” Steve says. The collar of his coat is sitting strangely and he tugs it away from his throat, where it refuses to sit flat.
He seems half made of sound himself, and Steve considers that he might have been right when he thought that one of the fair folk had come to bewitch him.
“You are going to tell me that it would not be a suitable match. But that does not seem the sort of thing that would stop you,” Sam says.
Steve raises his eyebrows at the comment and is amazed to see Sir Anthony look a little abashed.
“Did he give any indication of when he would be free?” Steve asks.
“Shut up, Buck,” Steve mutters automatically, before remembering that Bucky isn’t there. He shakes his head, as though that will rid the chaos from his mind. He straightens his jacket again and reaches up to knock, but before the first blow lands, the door is swinging open and a familiar face appears - the Barnes’ servant, Nancy.
Steve ignores him.
“I’m just not accustomed to society any more,” he says. “I’ll be fine.”
“I don’t think subtlety is really Captain Rogers’ strong point,” Sam says, his eyes sparkling just a bit as he smiles at Steve’s expense.
Steve draws in a deep breath, so deep it almost chokes him, but it still doesn’t seem to fill him up. He squares his shoulders and advances.
“I’ll be down shortly, Sam. You have my word on it.”
Camp Lehigh is a fair way to drive, but he should be able to make it there and back in a night. If the car doesn’t fall apart halfway. It’s shaking and rattling as he presses down the accelerator, held together by duct tape and will power at this point.
Tony takes them, but his eyes do not stray from Steve.
He remembers that same voice scolding him for stealing a cookie from the kitchen when he was a boy. Now he is taller than her, his head having to duck under the low door frame to get in. He feels caught off balance. Of all places in the world, this one should be familiar to him, but it still feels alien.
“There is nothing to deny,” Steve says.
He can remember those words in Howard’s voice.
He needs a name, something to call himself by. The highwaymen in tales always have them. The Dark Avenger, the Moonlit Rider, something with a bit of flair.
,” Peggy’s shade tells him, like she did once years ago.
“And this is why you always get to be the servant,” she says, folding her hands on her lap prettily. “We apologise for the subterfuge, but until recently, privacy was our best defence.”
“Are you alright, Captain Rogers?” Mr Murdock asks.
The thing about war, Steve has always thought, was the way things went from stillness to action in a split second. One shot was fired, one guard shouted out and in the difference of a heartbeat, order turned to chaos. You never quite got used to it, but you got better at reacting to it. Steve at least has superhuman reflexes on his side. The pair of them do not.
“I suppose it cannot hurt to look,” he says.
“Sorry to cut this short,” Steve says, putting his pistol away. “I wish I could say it had been a pleasure.”
The blanket of the cloud below them glows golden and green, spreading out softly. It is as though the clouds themselves are lit up from the inside. Steve’s breath catches in his chest at the sight of it, the sea of light.
“You feel that we should be without rules?”
“No one’s unimportant,” Steve says, his voice tight, his anger controlled. He’s not a kid anymore. He can channel it. He can make it count. “Maybe that’s your problem: you overlook the little guy.”
He should dance, he knows that's true. It is rude not to, just as Bucky has always said, but it's not something he knows how to do. When he was younger, he was laughed away whenever he tried, and no one would return the favour. Now… now he feels as if he will shatter if he takes one step towards the dancefloor and the laughing couples upon it.
“And yet I just told you that when society is wrong, then I tend to ignore its concerns,” Steve comments. He’s about to protest that Sir Anthony is a good man when he is stopped by the man holding up a hand.
“And you never shall if you do not outfit yourself properly!” Sir Anthony exclaims. “What do you do with your possessions as you travel? Do you roll your garments up in your saddle bags?” Steve does not reply as he takes in the aghast look on Sir Anthony’s face.
It may be that thought which distracts him that night, or perhaps he has just grown too comfortable with the system he has developed. He should know better. Complacence is a surefire way to die. It goes wrong from the beginning.
“Right,” Sam says. “And you’re sure this is it?” He looks at the bag.
as the door closes behind him.
Steve shifts under his gaze.
“Neither did I…” Steve says. “We should look inside.”
Steve heaves a sigh. He must not feel discouraged. This is only his first attempt. It could not be expected that the villains would be at work every night, nor that he would necessarily be fortunate enough to happen upon the people he is looking for straight away. He has only waylaid three parties on the road. Far more than that must have travelled yesterday, but he cannot lie in wait all day. He will have to vary his schedule in case they are accustomed to travelling at different times of day.
It goes surprisingly smoothly and Steve manages a fairly thorough examination of the goods and valuables they are carrying and takes a few satchels to look through - and then return - later. No one is injured and everyone goes on with their day.
Steve heads out that night on Liberty, her white blaze blackened with the soot, and takes one of his accustomed positions.
Steve had forgotten how good it feels to ride somewhere, and more than that, to ride somewhere with a purpose. Idleness does not suit him.
“I am tougher than I look,” Mrs Romanoff informs him and there is steel in her eyes that leaves Steve in no doubt that what she says is true.
“You wouldn’t-” Steve begins, but Sir Anthony starts to ride in a trot, then a canter. “-inconvenience me.” He sighs. Sir Anthony is impossible to understand and it seems that Steve has put his foot in his mouth again.
“I am recovered now, though, so I shall return to the festivities,” Steve says. “Sir Anthony, my thanks for your kind concern.” He bows smoothly and smiles as politely as he can manage at Mr Stane before stepping back inside.
Steve frowns at the reminder and bites at his lip.
“One day, young man, you’ll be getting letters from your sweetheart and we’ll all giggle at you,” the little boy’s great grandmother says.
Then the void had called back. People with problems. People who had nowhere else to turn. People who had seen things they wanted to change.
“Very well,” he agrees. “Thank you for your time, Sir Anthony.”
“I had no idea it was a pastime of yours,” Sir Anthony says. “I do not remember you mentioning it before - or my father having mentioned it when he spoke of you.”
It might be Steve’s imagination, as he finds himself disliking the man so much - though Mr Stane has done nothing to merit such distaste - but he fancies that the smile on Mr Stane’s face is concealing just the slightest hint of anger. A better man would not have felt pleased at such an expression, but Steve acknowledges the fact.
On the other hand, more people are contacting him with crackpot theories about alien conspiracies.
“My thanks for your concern, but if I am to find a partner, I should like to do it on my own initiative.”
“Liberty is more than enough for my needs,” Steve says, patting her neck as though Sir Anthony’s words will hurt her feelings. “I need no carriage.” She knickers quietly and endures his petting good-naturedly.
If that’s true… Steve feels sick to his stomach. It could be lies, but something tells him it’s not. Something about this whole thing rings true. His hands ball into fists.
Steve is unsure what Sir Howard might be contacting him for, but he does not care at this moment in time. He cuts the envelope open and withdraws the thick paper from it.
“That does seem to be the theme of this conversation,” Sir Anthony says. “Do not trouble yourself. I have made the same observation myself on numerous occasions: give a man a few thousand pounds of income and he’ll think himself quite the smartest person in the room - give him a title as well and it’s a wonder any hats will fit his head, the prodigious amount of brains that must be in it. You did not offend me. Nor yesterday.” Steve opens his mouth to protest again because he knows that he must have said something to upset the man before. “No,” Sir Anthony says. “You don’t need to apologise and you said nothing that wasn’t true. Nothing I haven’t heard a dozen times before, either. I am aware of what people say about me.”
Steve huffs out a breath, another plume of mist that disappears into the night.
“Why?” Steve asks. “You have no gun, I would have heard it.” He keeps his voice in that Brooklyn drawl.
“We have very little at present. The culprit is good at hiding their tracks,” she says. “But we are given to understand that there will be another delivery within the month.”
“And you are sketching,” Sir Anthony adds, seemingly fascinated by that fact.
“I am pleased you are getting use out of this place,” he says. “I wasn’t sure of the kinds of books you enjoyed - or if you even enjoyed books.” He strides across the room to the low escritoire Steve has been working at, peering down at the title of the top book. “A treatise on the mating habits of the termite,” Tony reads. He looks up and Steve looks back, holding his face as steady as possible.
“Mrs Romanoff, Mr Barton,” Steve says, inclining his head to both of them, his mind reeling as he tries to work out what they could possibly have to talk about. “I did not know you were acquainted.”
“Not yet,” he says. “I always feel awake after large groups of people.” It’s not a lie, but it isn’t quite the truth. “I’ll head to bed in a while. Some reading will settle me down.”
“You could say that,” he says out loud.
“You will want to be careful with Sir Anthony,” Mrs Romanoff says as they promenade around each other, hands touching lightly.
“I do, but even if I didn’t, this road will be easy enough to follow.”
“And that is why you have Mrs Templeton,” Sir Anthony says, waving the new housekeeper forwards. Eliza Templeton is a kind looking woman who takes control of the household with an iron grip. Steve cannot be more grateful to Sir Anthony for hiring her, even if he is overwhelmed by the idea of needing a housekeeper at all. His family had never been able to afford one growing up.
“If you would like the piano, Sir Anthony, I can have it sent to the manor.” Before Tony can protest, Steve quickly continues. “There is no one here to play it and so fine an instrument should be played.”
They pore over the two books, identical copies, but Steve cannot find a single difference to them on a cursory glance, or even under a more detailed inspection. He growls in frustration.
“I’m sure that is not true,” Steve says, giving Sir Anthony a tentative smile.
associated with Hydra, but had died of cancer in the eighties after decades working for the US government. It had seemed like just another routine load of nonsense.
“You’re up to something,” Bucky says. Steve looks up with feigned casualness. Bucky’s eyes narrow. “Steve.”
“What is that?” Sam asks, leaning in as well.
this hero, you’re good and honest and sometimes it’s physically painful standing next to you because you’re just too much, but then you do something like this-”
“I’ll bear that in mind,” Steve says, stepping out from behind the urn with his hands raised. Barton’s bow is lowered, and he’s surrounded by the luggage Steve had thrown at him. “Goodnight, Mr Barton.”
“I should not pay attention to idle gossip,” Steve says. There is a tone of self-deprecation in Sir Anthony’s voice that he does not like and he wishes to banish it as soon as may be possible. “You are a good man and I am proud to count you among my friends.”
“I’m sure society does not care a whit that I am gone at all,” Tony says. “In my experience, society only cares for what is right in front of it and it has a very poor memory indeed for those it has not seen recently, excepting there being some sort of scandal.”
He takes advantage of the guards’ distraction to dive for cover under the nearest bench, beneath the flickering images of his own and Peggy’s faces. He wraps his arms over his head and curls into a ball. He doesn’t know if it will do any good, but it’s better than doing nothing.
“I wasn’t intending to,” Steve says, wincing. “Sometimes I still do not know my own strength.” He looks down and sees that he has not in fact ripped the binding, but the end paper has come away from the cover, the rich swirling patterns peeling up in the corner. He almost looks away before he sees that there is something there - sandwiched between the end paper and the cover.
The guards shove him inside and follow, jabbing a finger at a button before the elevator comes to life. It moves too smoothly and looks too modern to have been an original feature of the facility. It’s clear this place has been functioning for a while. Long enough to update the facilities and brand them.
“Is that…?”
“You are not good at concealing your feelings. Your face shows them all. And whenever you are in a gathering like this, it says very clearly that you would prefer to be anywhere else.”
“No… I was… uh… taking notes.”
He is glad that they are going home, glad that he had some part in making that happen. But he can barely listen to the praise when it is directed into the ether, to some man they know only as ‘The Captain’. He couldn’t take it if they were to direct it at him. Not when he knows that he doesn’t deserve it.
“Yes, sir,” Barton replies.
“If I cannot give you anything in payment, perhaps you would allow me to offer something in gratitude?” Tony says slowly. “It would be an honour to receive the two of you at dinner this evening.”
Steve starts at the remembrance. He had forgotten about the disastrous conversation and his decision to try to reconcile today.
“Then if you do not mind my clumsiness, I can't either,” Steve says and rises to bow to her before taking her hand. He tries to ignore his nervousness. There are many other people dancing, no one is staring at him. She asked him and she will not turn him down and refuse him now.
“I apologise for the interruption,” Steve says automatically.
“I’m not going to-”
“Are you still trying to deny that there is an attachment between you and the baronet?” Sam asks.
“Coming, Nat,” Barton says cheerfully, touching his forelock with a bow that seems more insolent than respectful as he follows her out. “Your horse is in the stable, by the way. Try not to let her get away again. You never know who might have found her.”
“You’re a guest, and more than that, she likes you,” Sam tells him. “You’ll be fine. I, on the other hand…” he waits and gives Steve an assessing look. “You’re going to own the place, don’t you think you should at least take a look?”
“Excellent,” Ms Van Dyne says, clapping her hands together. “Then listen carefully, for it is a tale of woe and magic.”
“I am sorry for the subterfuge,” Steve says, his words halting, his heart pounding in his chest.
Not that there were any bodies.
He is saved from having to defend his actions by the arrival of the post. There is an invitation from Ms Van Dyne to have tea with her, which he and Sam gladly accept.
,” says the voice of Bucky’s shade.
“I am glad to know I retain at least some of my mysteries. I fear if I lost them I would lack all substance whatsoever.”
“Oh yes, if he is not travelling on business then it is said he is always down in his workshop, which no one has leave to enter,” Mr Moore whispers, clearly more concerned about being overheard in his commentary than his friend is.
People are whistling, men call out to each other. There is an air of joy on deck, but it slips right past Steve without touching him.
“You are my friend,” Sam says, cutting him off. “And travelling alone is a miserable business. I honestly can’t think of anything I would enjoy more.”
After what seems like an age has passed, the thick pile of the carpet swallowing the sounds of his footsteps, he hears the door push open and Steve turns smartly.
He can’t help but remember Sam’s words from their previous discussion. He searches Sir Anthony’s face for any sort of sign that he is less than genuine. He sees nothing, but there is still that shard of doubt in him now.
“Yes,” Steve admits. “He said as much in his letter, though not in so many words.”
“No,” Steve says. “Did you?”
“What?”
It feels a lot like Steve has stepped into the past, and sometimes he has to stop himself from saying the wrong name.
“Usually explaining why their plans wouldn’t work,” Steve says, half smiling at the memories. “Money seems to make some people think they are geniuses.”
“Are you okay to fly?” he asks, finally taking in the damage the suit has sustained. Stark gives him a wicked grin.
“I don’t miss,” Barton says. Steve’s heard that sort of certainty before - in Bucky’s voice. And when he looks at the man with that thought in mind, it’s easy to see the similarities.
Lunch passes both too quickly and too slowly. It seems as though every mouthful takes an age, but when the meal is done, Steve feels like no time has passed at all.
He pats Liberty’s neck in thanks as he lowers himself carefully to the ground, and he walks over to knock on the door.
“My mother was a wonderful woman,” Tony says, his voice tight, and Sam hurries to change the topic to lighter things.
He is ushered to the parlour, where a good number of guests already sit - though he and Sam had not been late by any means. He nods to Ms Van Dyne, who sits to the left, probably one of his favourite new acquaintances as she has just the one child, who is not yet two years old, and therefore only has interest in Steve for himself, not for his lack of a spouse. She smiles back, but before they can exchange two words, Mr Stane is leading him further on again, to the small bridge table in the corner, where two young women and a young man are sitting. Steve sighs internally, for he recognises all three as being unmarried and very much interested in changing that status. It seems that he shall not escape them today, not if Mr Stane has his way.
Steve stands and turns to bow to Stane.
He should have let Bucky actually know. At least then there would be someone looking for him. As it is, he’s not even sure if Bucky’s going to be home tonight. He’ll probably be gone until morning at least. Which means that if he bothers to look at the fridge, rather than just going straight into his hangover ritual of sleeping for eight hours and ordering the greasiest takeout he can find, it’s going to be hours before anyone even realises Steve’s gone.
“You have no idea what I would do,” Steve says, his voice a little harsh. “For the right reasons.” He wants to tell Sir Anthony right now, wants to explain it all, but he knows he can’t. He cannot believe Sir Anthony capable of treason, but even so, to tell him would be to put him in an unconscionable position. He steps forwards, almost against his will, swallowing down the truth.
it!” Steve tries to shout, but it comes out more as a gasp, pointing at the half-uncovered face of Tony Stark.
“I have been very tired,” Steve says. “And my room faces north, so I do not get the sunlight to wake me.” Sam eyes him suspiciously.
“You are welcome at Lakefield at any time,” he says. “If you still want to look at my sketches.”
Sir Anthony opens his mouth to speak, then closes it again.
It is the diary of the highwayman that Ms Van Dyne spoke of. A description of a dark time in the history of the country. The Magic Purges seem long ago now, but in the pages of the diary, they are fresh and real. Steve can feel the desperation in every line of it.
“And I am more than happy to provide,” Sir Anthony says, his smile growing.
“But I'd wager that's what he heard,” Sam says. “Do you have any plans to fix things between you, at least? Our time here could be very uncomfortable if you fall out with the man who owns half the county.”
“Sir Anthony, Baronet Stark, to see you, sir,” the butler says and, almost before the words are out of his mouth, Tony is stepping into the room. With a bang, Steve stands, slamming a book shut over the notes he’d been writing, his knee hitting the table leg.
Steve grits his teeth and concentrates hard on the clouds in front of him, the grain of the wooden rail, the broken corner of his thumbnail, jagged and uneven, barely hanging on. Anything but the stench of the dead men’s breath in his nostrils, the taste of someone else’s blood in his mouth.
,” Bucky says in his mind. Steve shakes his head, but raises his hands to the sides, the stolen cases still hanging from one, and turns around.
The ship is on course for Brooklyn. The war is over. He should feel relief. The airshipmen around him are all going home.
“I wish he’d jilt me,” Mr Moore says and the two young ladies look appropriately scandalised at the comment.
He needs to find them a way out of here. He has his phone. He can breathe again. They just need a way out. He looks around frantically. Half the screens are gone, but one is still flickering, the image of Zola’s face on it shouting wordlessly. The speakers must have been broken.
A sad smile falls across Sir Anthony’s face.
“I’m more concerned about who she might want it for,” Steve mutters.
The other guy is half under rubble. He must have been knocked down and pinned as Iron Man came through the ceiling. Steve scrabbles over to him, his breath quick and short, but there are more important things to worry about than breathing right now. His phone. He needs his phone. He needs that recording.
“He appears to have believed you close,” Sam says, gesturing to the letter. “Have you seen the property?”
and a rumbling scraping sound as he pulls. Steve steps back in amazement as the whole bookshelf moves smoothly out and slides to the side. He stares in astonishment. Behind the bookcase there is no wall, but instead a darkened room. He grabs an oil lamp from the side and steps in.
“You gave me a home, Sir Anthony. The least I can do is give you a picture of one. I regret I have no excess property lying about.” Tony stares at him for a long second, then bows his head in thanks.
If Steve had thought Tony determined to insult him before, Obadiah Stane makes an art out of it. Having failed at his earlier tactic, he chooses instead to imply Steve’s unworthiness by comparison. Tony must visit town soon, the society there is so amiable. The ladies and gentlemen so attractive, Mr Stane believes he has never seen their like, and so intelligent.
Perhaps highway robbery was not the path he should have taken. It is true that it sits uneasily on his shoulders, but he returns all that he takes - which is what he is doing right now after all. There is nothing dishonest in borrowing. Steve winces. He knows the law would not see it that way. And now he has dragged Sam - a perfectly respectable gentleman - into his madness, too.
“Yes, Steve. Take advantage of the man,” Sam mutters and Steve glares at him. He does not know why his friend has taken to being so… Steve sighs, deeply.
“I know,” Sir Anthony says. Steve walks to him and leans in, lowering his voice.
“Greetings,” he says, the persona of The Nomad falling onto him, although his heart is beating double time at the thought that he has finally found the people he has been searching for this whole time. His mission is at its end. “Sorry to inconvenience you; this’ll take but a moment.”
, he doesn’t say. It seems like half of all his conversations are unspoken now, like he’s forgotten how to speak. Sometimes he wonders if Bucky used to fill in all these gaps.
“I doubt you have ever been in need of anyone’s approval in your life,” he says. “But I also doubt there is anyone in the county who would dare disapprove of you.”
“You must have missed me,” Steve says, “I’m good at dodging.”
“Right,” Iron Man says, sounding surprised, and maybe a little impressed. “Okay, sure. That was helpful.” He blasts two of the remaining gunmen, but before he can move to the third there’s another blast of blue light that hits him right in the face.
“I liked it,” Mr Barton says, grinning broadly. “I mean, being a highwayman’s definitely got more flare than being a groom.” Steve tries not to smile, but there’s a certain energy about the man that is almost infectious, and Steve’s frown is not as hard as he would have liked.
“Why do you want to know?” Steve replies, a question with a question. It’s about forty foot to the stable and then another forty to the treeline where Liberty is waiting. He could probably make it, but not without an arrow in him, or two, depending on how fast Barton can shoot. He remembers Bucky’s speed with the rifle, and he thinks that Barton’s probably pretty fast.
“That makes the situation a little less impossible,” Sam concedes. “But you must allow that you still do not have a face nor a name. Nor do you have any idea what manner of thing it was they were transporting. What do you intend to do?”
Neither of the men is wearing any sort of insignia on their uniforms. If this is a black site, some CIA hideout where they torture prisoners, or worse, then he’s pretty sure he’s screwed.
“Ticking along nicely, Obie,” Sir Anthony says with a smile.
The letter crumples in the fist that holds it and even the sound of it, the feel of it, seems like it is miles away. Or maybe it's Steve who is miles away. Maybe Steve is still out there in the war. Maybe he never came back either.
, Steve thinks sorely.
Steve’s first instinct had been to call the Avengers. Secret Nazis really seemed more their thing. But it turned out that their system of filtering out the cranks was a whole lot more effective than his. His call to the Avengers’ tip line had got him the verbal equivalent of a pat on the head, and an assurance that his information would be passed on to the Avengers as soon as possible.
“I do not have a flair for the dramatic.”
“Well, you’ve certainly kicked up enough of a fuss already,” a voice says and Steve starts. He looks up to see Mrs Romanoff standing in the doorway, watching them coolly.
“You aren’t gonna tell the baronet, are you?” he asks. “I swear I wasn’t stealing. I just didn’t have an apple on me and I thought I’d give her a treat. That’s all, I swear.”
“Things about what Hydra was capable of, what their sorcerers can do, what they have done. I’ve seen the aftermath too. We get called in sometimes to… lift people out.”
“But on the subject of carriages, I know very little,” Steve says. “On that, I confess I will need your guidance.”
“Ah,” Steve says, before raising his second gun and pointing at her. “I warn you, my lady. I am a very good shot.”
“Indeed, I think not,” Tony says. “Colonel Danvers, tell me more of your travels. I am sure the stories Colonel Rhodes has been telling us are nothing compared to yours.”
“Weapons aren’t like fashion, you know,” Tony says, stepping out of the carriage. “We don’t just change it because we feel like it. Although, they do at least look like they’re well made.”
Steve urges Liberty into a trot and heads for home.
They are invited to dine at Stark Manor - and Steve is uncomfortably aware that he is running out of time to return the favour. There is only so long you can spend ‘settling in’ and he has been invited for tea at least to every house in a ten mile radius, with exceptional enthusiasm by every household with children of marriageable age. It's beginning to feel a little like a cattle auction, with everyone taking a look at the prize bull. Steve is surprised some of the parents have not asked to see his teeth.
“Perfect memory for voices,” Steve tells him. “Comes with the whole…” He waves his hand at himself vaguely.
It is taken as given that he is looking to marry and, while Steve has tried to deter them, it is difficult to comment without insulting someone. Sam, on the other hand, seems to be enjoying the attention, though he shows no partiality for anyone.
Hydra.
“Is it possible he has people working on this?”
“Following orders doesn’t really seem like your style.”
,” Bucky’s voice tells him. Steve doesn’t know what stupid thing he could do right now that is any stupider than what he has already done.
As their hands release, Steve sees it, catching the glow out of the corner of his eye, and turning towards it instinctually.
“I’m not the one who keeps sleeping until noon. Perhaps you should bed down with the horses yourself.”
“If your feet are prepared for it,” Steve says. “I’m afraid I may leave them bruised.”
“Sketches,” he says instead, stepping back and clapping his hands together. “That is why I am here. Sketches. Yours. You invited me over to see them and here I am.”
“Not really. We have occasional bands of opportunistic thieves, but the militia tends to deal with them quite smartly. Although…” Ms Van Dyne leans in, her eyes sparkling. “The same could not be said a hundred years ago. Has anyone told you the local ghost story?”
Steve hasn’t had anyone ask him that before.
“It is to Tony’s benefit that he inherited it,” Stane continues. “Capable of making friends with anyone, no matter how lowly their beginnings.” The entire table shifts uncomfortably and Colonel Rhodes clears his throat.
The reply is difficult to compose. Steve knows very little about Howard’s son beyond the fact that his father finds - found - him simultaneously a source of great pride and great frustration. The man is supposed to be a genius. Howard had boasted that Tony’s - Sir Anthony, now - designs were at the forefront of the army’s resources. The kind of technology that blew their opponents right out of the sky, but he was also rumoured to be a flirt and barely on the right side of scandal. How should Steve address a man like that?
It is no wonder he hadn’t heard a gun being cocked, because Barton is not carrying a gun. Instead he carries a bow, an arrow nocked and aimed right at Steve’s heart. Bows are not unheard of, mainly for hunting and sport, but in a world where rifles and pistols exist, it seems a curious choice of weapon. He already knows Barton has access to firearms, afterall, there is evidence in two small scars on his back.
“The militia was crawling around,” Steve says. “I didn’t have the time to look in bags.”
He handles every single one of them with care and consideration, talking to each one as though it is a favoured child, calling for Steve to come and see them. Steve watches as the horses are paraded out in the ring, and notes which seem splayfooted, and which might overreach themselves a little.
“Captain Rogers, I must confess I am surprised. I had assumed your business would be complete by now. Tony, I brought you a drink, the dust in this place must be drying you out.
Steve smiles to himself. Little do they know.
“I am not sure that such rumours should be repeated,” he says.
Tony’s face goes cold and blank and Steve notes the hard look in Colonel Danvers’ eyes and the way Colonel Rhodes’ hands tighten on the silverware. He shares a look with Sam.
“I know,” Steve says, and he does, because he can just imagine them all telling him what an idiot he is.
“I think staying here would be worse for my health,” Steve points out, and Stark chuckles.
Sir Anthony turns to him fully, setting down the hammer.
Steve lets out a broken laugh. No further part in this. How he wishes that were true.
“Captain, I hardly think…” Tony says, looking between them.
He throws the bags. It’s a difficult throw, the bags ungainly and not built to fly through the air, but Barton’s not the only one with good aim. After ricocheting his shield off numerous walls, throwing a few bags straight ahead is child’s play.
“Sir Anthony,” he says, the name coming out in a rush. The man looks good, but then he always looks good. “Forgive me, I was not expecting you.”
“Well, we’ll need to get a cold compress on-” Sam starts. Steve shakes his head and nods to the bag where it sits, innocent as it may please, on the desk. He hisses again as he stretches out his leg. He must have bruised it more badly than he thought when he fell to the ground.
“Captain Rogers,” he says without turning around. Steve drags his eyes away from the way the damp shirt clings to the muscles of Sir Anthony’s back and down to the papers on the nearest work surface, weighed down by a handful of delicate looking gears. They appear to be designs for some sort of cannon, the like of which Steve has never seen before.
“All three,” Sam replies promptly. “So, what did you discuss with Sir Anthony?”
The seal on the back of the envelope is familiar, but it takes a second for him to place it. In the end, it is the motto that reminds him:
Someone, somewhere begins to play a reel on the piano and Ms Van Dyne’s face lights up.
“My father spoke highly of you to me, as well, but perhaps it would have been better for everyone if he had given his good opinions to the people they were intended for. I shall leave you to enjoy your sketching, Captain. Good day.” Sir Anthony digs his heels into the flanks of his horse to urge it into a walk, but Steve steps up. He doesn’t know how to recover the moment. He does not wish to lose a friend over a misunderstanding.
Steve tries to wrap his mind around that. Some sort of facial tracking technology, perhaps? Like a Zoom filter?
“Obie, what’s the matter?” Sir Anthony asks.
Bucky glances at him and Steve thinks the word ‘normal’ as loudly as he can. Everything is normal. There is nothing for Bucky to see.
As he unfolds it, Steve’s heart is in his throat, because he recognises that handwriting, and those designs.
“It is your house, so it is yours,” Steve says, shaking his head. He could not ask for money for so small a thing, especially not after all Tony has done for him.
It’s a depressing thought. That all they had lost had only been for a temporary ceasefire. Steve might wake up tomorrow and find himself called up once more to fight the same enemy.
“Like tell the man - the rich, titled, unmarried man - who obviously has a certain regard for you that his private life doesn’t matter to you.”
The armour is hard and unyielding as Stark wraps an arm around his back to pin them together, and it’s so much bigger than Steve. It’s not as uncomfortable as he had thought, though. He’s always admired the armour from a distance - a miracle of technology and form, far more beautiful than the giant tower Stark had built in the middle of New York, but he appreciates the smooth lines of it more now that he’s surrounded by them. There are no sharp edges digging in.
That inevitably brings the conversation back to Sir Anthony and how he has been of invaluable assistance.
Mr Stane walks him to the door with a dedication that is admirable. On the way, he is careful to mention how important Sir Anthony’s work is and how it’s crucial that it not be delayed.
“Certainly,” Steve says, struggling to keep his relief from showing on his face. It's not their fault that they are lavishing their attention where it is not wanted. “My apologies, but I am sure you will find someone else to make up your number.”
He leaves Sam with their new haul and goes to return what he had stolen before. There was nothing in the baronet’s valise, or in the luggage of the Hogans that implicated them, which was as he had expected.
Tony, who looks both taken aback and amused at the compliment. The driver - Barton - is chuckling.
“I am an open book,” Steve lies. “You may put your finger on any page of me.” They blink at each other and Steve’s words hang there between them. He hadn’t meant that like it sounded.
Metallic thuds resound through the chamber and he turns to see a heavy metal blast door slam down, leaving them with three Hydra gunmen in the room, the rest locked out.
“I think I made it worse,” he says, as though the crack had been there all along. “These tables look quite old.” Steve can only hope that Sam was not paying so much attention to the table, but he doesn’t look convinced. In a transparent attempt to avoid the subject, Steve changes it back quickly.
In spite of his best intentions to fade into the background for the evening, Steve finds himself out on the dancefloor more than a couple of times. He does not, he is grateful to report, trip over his own feet, but the same cannot be said for his tongue. It seems that he still has not uncovered the secret of talking to pretty people in social situations.
“Grew up there,” Steve says.
“It is indeed,” Sir Anthony admits. “I am sorry to have polluted it with my terrible boring facts.” He bows to her in supplication. “I beg your forgiveness.”
“No, I have not,” Steve says slowly. “We never met in this country, only during the war. Howard - Sir Howard - would come to work on the weaponry. He would talk about having us stay at his home, meeting his wife and son, but we never…”
Bucky’s voice says.
It is not long before he hears the tell-tale sound of hoofbeats against the road, and he checks his pistols for shot. They are both primed and ready, though he has no intention to use them.
“Liberty is not built to pull a phaeton,” Steve says.
“Oh, I do,” Sir Anthony tells him. “And you are so polite I know you will not contradict me, because it would be terribly rude to contradict a guest.”
Colonels Rhodes and Danvers are still in residence, their intention being to move on in the morning, and Tony is full of high spirits. It is a pleasant night on all accounts but one: Obadiah Stane.
But routine nonsense didn’t lead to him being escorted by two huge guys with large, strange guns into what seemed to be an abandoned building. He’s got a black eye and a split lip, and a sinking feeling that he’s not going to get away with a slap on the wrist.
Steve pulls himself to his feet, still in the shadow of Iron Man’s imposing form, and takes a couple of deep, careful breaths. He can make this. He has to make it. He can hear the strain in Iron Man’s voice. He won’t be able to take the onslaught for much longer, and those Hydra guns are doing more damage than Steve had thought possible. If Steve can just cut them off, then he and Iron Man will have time to get out of here.
He sidesteps as Tony’s friend comes at him, reaching out and grasping the pistol to push the barrel away from him, into the woods, before disarming Tony entirely and emptying the pistol of shot and powder before tossing it to the ground.
“That is not what I said,” Steve says quickly. His words had been awkward, yes, but he had not been that discourteous.
He has not been caught. He is still fine. But now Sam is waiting for him downstairs. Steve does not believe he has ever dressed so fast in his life, and he is out of the door in less than five minutes.
A large hand with a drink in it appears from the left, inserting itself between the two of them. Steve follows the rich fabric of the sleeve up to Mr Stane’s face.
“More like she found me,” Barton says, shrugging.
“You were a rifleman,” Steve says. Barton blinks.
In the chest are also the clothes and the mask that they wore, and a pair of pistols, outdated by modern standards, but they look like they would still work.
“Got to say, I didn’t think you’d do it,” he admits.
“You didn't really think that I would not guess,” he says. “There were far too many coincidences for me not to notice. And I had my suspicions from the start, although I did not wish to say anything when you so clearly wanted no one to know.”
He finds another phone - the guard’s, he assumes, and pockets it, the more evidence he has the better - a pack of gum, a switchblade, a set of keys, and then, around the guy’s neck, one other key.
They make their way to the parlour, quietly, so as not to wake the household, and as Steve pushes the door open he is surprised to see not one, but two figures there. Mrs Romanoff is no surprise, but Mr Barton, on the other hand, is very much so.
“May I ask how much?”
“Yes, we’ve been maintaining the payments for your rent,” Mr Murdock assures him. “And deducting our own fees, of course.”
Sir Anthony turns up almost every day with some other new thing that Steve must have. He brings books and tables and an old desk of his father’s.
“He spoke highly of you to me,” Steve says.
“On the mating cycle of termites?”
Sam’s parents let them go with admonishments to be wary of bandits on the road and the pair of them set off, riding with the morning light.
“How is it that you, someone so insignificant, have managed to derail so many of my plans?” Zola asks. Steve straightens. He knows a bully when he hears one. “I had wondered if you were a mind to match my own, but I have looked into your life-” images appear of Steve, as a baby, as a toddler, at school, graduating. With his ma, at his ma’s grave. With Bucky. At his first convention, signing posters. On his twitch live stream. “You show no great mental strengths. No genius. No true vision. You are unimportant. How could someone like
“Well, then I suppose I must apologise for the comfort of my guest quarters and offer you other accommodation. I believe we have four stalls free in the stables.”
“I got a bit turned around in the woods,” he says. “I also met Sir Anthony on the road.”
Poised to do what? There is no war for him to fight here. There is no threat here. Mr Murdock sits quite calmly on the other side of the desk and from the antechamber behind Steve, there come the sounds of someone filing papers. He forces his shoulders to relax.
“There is nothing wrong with wanting,” Steve says. They still have not looked away from one another. He should look away, but he finds he cannot. Then he realises what he just said, the tone of his voice, how that could sound…
The food is simple and filling, if a little bland, and the company is good. Crowded into the small, smokey taproom, it reminds him of other places and other people. Steve half expects to feel Dum Dum’s hand slap him on the back or hear Morita arguing with the barkeep. He swallows down his resentment and listens to Sam describe the antics he got up to as a midshipman on a flying vessel.
Sam pauses, takes a deep breath, then pauses again.
“Dr Zola,” he says, looking around again. “Is this… a recording?”
“I’m glad he has been so solicitous of your needs,” Mr Stane says and somehow the words are made oily as they leave his lips, dripping from his mouth.
, and he freezes instantly. He turns to see Rebecca Barnes standing in the hall, her hair coming loose as it has always done, her teeth worrying her lip. “Did he…” she starts. “Was it… Did he suffer, in the end?”
Sir Howard - call me Howard - had not been a close friend, but the recognition of a familiar acquaintance might as well be a lifeline to a drowning man. Steve excuses himself to open the missive in privacy and as he leaves, he hears “see, I bet it is from his sweetheart,” followed by a loud
“If it is him, then he is the foremost liar I have ever met,” Steve says. He runs his fingers over the bold lines of Stark’s writing. “He found me - as Nomad - in the woods and he claimed to have no idea what I was looking for. He was very convincing.”
“All the more reason why you simply must remind them of your presence. You haven’t been since you received the baronetcy. I’m sure Sir Tiberius and Lady Frost will be missing you. You turned a lot of heads, last year.”
“It is easy to give when you have a lot to give,” Sir Anthony says.
Once the niceties are done with, Steve asks after his funds. He has rent to pay for his time overseas, and he refuses to fall behind on it. He needs to check that the upkeep has been paid as per the instructions he gave. In all her life, his mother never failed to pay her rent. Come rain or shine, she would scrape together what little money was left after his father had drunk his fill and Steve’s medicines were purchased and she would pay the rent. She had kept a roof over his head. He had wondered, sometimes, if she had ever regretted marrying his father rather than a gentleman with money, as she was expected to, but if she had, she had never let Steve hear of it.
It is a little small, but flexible enough to stretch and he can see out well enough.
Winifred Barnes and two of her daughters rise to greet him in unison, their faces wearing identical expressions of calm.
There is a moment that stretches into a minute.
“Sam.” Steve pauses. He doesn’t know how to convey just what he means. Why is it that sometimes words come so easily to him and at other times they abandon him completely?
knows his name. But not right now. Steve ignores him, struggling around the rubble to push his hand into the man’s pockets. “Are you looting the body? I mean, I get it. If there were any jars around here I’d smash them to see if there was gold as well, but traditionally body looting is frowned upon on our side of the law.
“How what, Captain?” Sir Anthony asks.
“Oh Mr Stane!” says Miss Penelope Highcombe. “I declare you have found us the perfect bridge partner. Do sit down, Captain.”
“Everything is accounted for, Sam,” Steve says, grateful that he had the presence of mind not to keep anything incriminating in the saddlebags.
Sam’s family is large and boisterous. Steve is not the only guest and the place is full of noise at all times of day. Some days it is almost enough to drown out his thoughts.
“Good day, Mr Jarvis. I trust you are well.”
“And did you receive any response?”
The moon is just a sliver in the sky, the crescent barely giving enough light for Steve to see his way to the outhouse, though the sky is full of stars, swathes of them. The metal for his shield had come from the rock of a fallen star, he remembers. He wonders what Sam must see from his airship at night. It is beautiful.
“That would be very kind of you, Captain Wilson,” he says. The words are stiff and cold in his mouth, though he means them sincerely.
“Everything going well?” Mr Stane asks.
“It would be my honour,” Sir Anthony says, taking her hand.
Steve brings it up again as he and Sam are out one day.
“Just so,” Mrs Romanoff says. “But those things alone do not make him a traitor and he is a man with a great deal of influence and power. To accuse him prematurely would lead to problems for all of us, and would only result in putting the traitor further away from discovery.”
It is possible that Steve gets a little carried away in the idea of it, but he takes the mask as a guiding point. Midnight blue and a shirt to go with it. He has a pair of breeches that he also dyes blue and some riding boots that reach almost to his thighs. A hat, of course, with three corners, the sort of hat that Steve would never wear and, to complete it, a dark blue cape with a golden lining.
captain,” Mrs Romanoff says. Barton squints at her.
“I may take you up on that offer,” Sir Anthony says, then finally releases Steve’s hand back to him. “Farewell Captain Rogers… Captain Wilson.”
“And there you go again, trying to see nobility where there is none,” Sir Anthony says. Steve opens his mouth to protest. “No, no, you cannot make a good man out of me. I will not let you. I am quite content to be shallow and frivolous.”
“If that's what you want to do,” he says. “Though I would have thought that you would have enough peace and solitude at your home. You know your way back, I suppose.”
The thought lends a sour note to proceedings, as Steve sees the ghosts of people he knew at every turn. He will think he spies an old friend in the crowd, but a blink will resolve the familiar face into that of a stranger.
“Forgive the intrusion,” Mrs Romanoff says. “But we thought it was time we spoke.”
“Fine. We shall go to Marvel,” he says and Sam grins at him.
It's almost a disappointment to reach his destination, but the stillness of the woods serves only to lend a strange solemnity to the occasion. The infrequent hoots of the owls and the cries of the foxes split the night.
“I love them,” he says. It takes a lot of effort to keep his breathing relaxed.
“And you survived the war. I’m given to believe that it’s the soldiers who view their orders more flexibly who survive the longest.”
But it’s been a long week and Bucky has a date, so Steve is counting on him being more concerned with not messing that up than what Steve’s up to.
“I don’t know what you're talking about,” Steve says and Sir Anthony laughs good-naturedly.
Steve had not brought his pistols. Had not considered them necessary for this task. He is regretting that now, while he wouldn’t shoot a man who is merely protecting his master’s property, he would like to at least have the subterfuge.
He has been silent for too long. He can tell from the expression on Captain Wilson’s face. Time is problematic now, coming and going without any pretence of regularity. He has lost the thread of it, and lost more than that as well. Steve should say something, but there are no words that come to him, he has nothing to say.
Mr Stane has made it clear that - no matter what Sam may think - Steve is not a suitable connection for Sir Anthony. In fact, it seems he takes personal affront at their friendship.
“That's what everyone does,” she gestures to the dancers. “The baronet, you’ll agree, is very accomplished at it.”
“No, I insist! The question bothers you. You are my guest. I demand you let me put you at your ease. Let me make you easy. Ask your question, I’m not easily insulted. If I were, I would never leave my rooms. Ask.”
“That’s what makes me a good spy,” Barton tells him. “But I’ve got to ask - I know I hit you that night, how on earth did you survive?”
“Glad to hear that my hospitality is not quite as terrible as Hydra’s,” Sir Anthony replies. “But do try to enjoy yourself. It is not good for my ego to have a handsome young captain out of sorts at one of my soirees.”
“I didn't think so at the time,” Steve says, but as he thinks about it, there had been no one else left that he might have called a friend. And now it seems that Howard, too, is gone.
“I think you may be correct on that point.”
“I got it,” Steve says. “It was them.”
Steve cannot imagine himself ever being home in a place like this. He has overcome some of his initial qualms about the place, but he still feels as though he will break something valuable if he looks at it too hard.
Sam sticks around, probably because watching Steve founder is the most amusement he’s had in years. But even he finds himself stymied when Mrs Templeton, Steve’s new housekeeper, and Mrs Arbogast, the formidable lady who runs Tony’s own household, come together in some perfect storm of efficiency and common sense.
“Good, good. Safe journey.”
“I am glad to hear it, Captain Rogers. You understand that I cannot be too vigilant in the matter of Tony’s acquaintances.”
Bucky’s voice tells him in exasperation. And he notices that the window to the morning room is indeed open, though he cannot see clearly into the room from this angle.
Steve tries not to look too shocked by the secret door. He’s angry, not impressed. But it is like something out of a spy novel.
He hears the man be discovered by the militia. Hears him shouting about the highwayman, pointing them in the direction Steve went, but Steve’s not stupid enough to stay in that direction.
“It is not,” Steve says quickly. “That is - I do not find it unpleasant except for in so much as the reason for my business.”
“I think it’s a distinct possibility,” Mrs Romanoff says. “We can deliver this if you-” she reaches for the diagram.
He reminds himself that there is no ghost, it is merely memories lingering on. The Bucky he hears is just his imagination.
Steve lunges for the bag, and the man puts up a token effort to keep it away. Steve pulls his pistol and aims it right into the man’s face, so he has to go cross-eyed just to look at it. He watches the man’s adam’s apple bob up and down as he swallows and holds out the bag with one arm.
Steve Rogers does not come back from the war.
“If you could throw those bags you are carrying to the side of the road, I would be most grateful,” Steve continues. He tries to keep his voice the light-hearted tone that Nomad always adopts, but he knows that some of the vicious glee that he feels thudding through his chest must be showing.
It unfolds to reveal, in a more casual hand, but still that of Sir Anthony - the same hand in which all his dinner invitations have been written.
“Oh, I know,” she agrees. “Can’t stand the game. You’ll find they settle down soon. A valiant war hero arriving in the area has set everyone off,” she says. “No doubt they were filling your ears with gossip as well. What was it this time? My scandalous marriage to a man beneath my station? Who is secretly engaged to whom?” She peers at him and frowns. “Oh no. They were talking about Tony again, weren’t they?”
“Other than this one?” Sam asks and Barton nods.
“It does,” Steve agrees. They look at each other for a long moment before Sir Anthony seems to shake himself and bursts into movement again. He stands and reaches out a hand to shake Sam’s. Then he reaches out for Steve’s hand. The touch of skin against skin is strangely charged, warm, but sending a spike of energy through Steve’s gut. He looks into the warm brown eyes that look back at him and smiles in what must be an idiotic way. The sound of the music has settled down deep inside him, like a warm cat purring in delight.
“If you keep looking at the baronet like that, the whole village will be talking about it,” Sam says, heading over to the brandy decanter to pour them both a drink. “You’ll have to marry him just to stop the scandals.”
No name is given, but it is the diary of a woman who has chosen to take action, although she knows it is illegal, and though it means that if she is captured it will mean death for her and possible ruin for her family.
But Steve is not facing Hydra this time. He is facing civilians. They may carry a couple of pistols, but it is unlikely he will get any significant opposition as long as he keeps away from military convoys.
“You think they’ll do it again?” Sam asks, raising an eyebrow at Steve and then hopping across the river from one stone to another as though rising to some sort of a dare.
“No, and I swear I was looking at the damned door all the time.”
Whatever Sir Anthony would or would not do is lost as the door swings open again, the noises of the party spilling out between them
“Speaking of that,” Mr Barton says. “The reason we came here tonight… I found a rather specific horse wandering around, I thought perhaps you might have a home for her.” Steve starts, looking up.
“More used to a hammock?” Steve asks.
He enters the parlour and scowls at the painting over the mantlepiece, its depiction of the glories of war nothing he wants to think of at the moment. He turns from it in agitation and finds that Sam is ensconced in one of the high back chairs.
Steve is getting fanciful. Sam would tease him for liking the wrong kind of novels again, he’s sure.
“That man was ready to fall in love with you from the moment he saw you and I don’t believe you’ve done anything to dissuade him.”
“True. It is none of your business, I suppose, but I gather from your words you do hold opinions. I am sorry my private matters meet with your disapproval. I am sure you have no regrettable incidents in your own past.” He steps away, turning his back to Steve and going to mount his horse. Steve has the sinking feeling that he has trampled on something fragile. Sir Anthony looks back down at him once he is again astride.
“Yes, you do! And I am offering to assist you in obtaining them, or are you refusing my assistance? I should warn you that I’m not often so benevolent, Captain Rogers. You should take advantage of my kindness while you can.” He pauses and looks at Steve askance, as though he cannot figure out what to make of him. “Usually I don’t have to convince people to do so. You’re a very unusual man.” Steve frowns at the implications of that statement, but before he can comment, Sam interrupts.
Was this a private room of Howard’s, Steve wonders, perhaps a private study that he had emptied when he left or-
Or sending him mysterious emails from non-existent addresses claiming that Hydra - the Nazi organisation - is back and they’re growing.
“We knew it was possible,” Steve says. “You said it yourself. But I was too blinded by- I was too blind to believe it.”
“No, you were quite caught up in your work,” Sir Anthony says, offering him a smile. “I can’t say I don’t understand. Poor Jarvis often has to yell at me to get my attention when I’m in my workshop, and Obie and Mrs Hogan have often told me that I am oblivious to the world when there are tools in my hand. It is good to see I’m not the only one.”
. The Living Hero of the Hydra War. We used to hear about you, how many Hydra strongholds you had taken, every valiant victory, leading the way. We heard about the last fight too. How it was all nearly lost, how you still won through. I toasted in your name that night, we all did. You won the war for us. You let us go home.” Steve opens his mouth, but Sam won’t let him. “No. Just listen. You don’t understand how
“He is in rude health, captain. Do not trouble yourself.” He leads Steve to the drawing room. “I shall inform him of your arrival. Please make yourself at home.” He bows again, then departs, disappearing into the house.
“I mean only to say that you look well,” Sir Anthony says hurriedly.
“No,” Steve says. “Don’t… I mean, you play even better than I had been told. Please, I did not mean to interrupt you, Sir Anthony. Continue.”
“The piano was his mother’s,” Steve says. “It only makes sense that he would want to play her music on it. And when he played that song, he didn’t even know I was here.”
“Are you sure?” Steve does not get to hear Barton’s response as the thunder of Liberty’s hooves carries him out of earshot and into the woods.
It shows the fine and detailed diagram of an airship, unlike any airship Steve has seen before, more streamlined, and with an engine at the back that looks like something from a dream - or a nightmare. Steve stares at it. The writing, he does not need to question, it is undeniably Sir Anthony’s: tiny, precise script with measurements and explanations and equations that Steve can only half understand, covering it, describing every inch of the airship.
“You were infantry,” Barton tells him. “I thought so. What’s a soldier doing stealing bags in the middle of the night?”
When he comes to claim Liberty from the groom, however, he finds the man with his hands in the saddlebags.
Just as he’s trying to work out what’s going on, one of the guards reaches out to press his hand against the wall and the wall… opens.
“Steve,” Steve replies and he offers his hand, which Sam takes immediately, with a smile.
“Maybe we can help each other,” Barton says. Steve’s mind switches gears, starts to reassess what he knows. Barton had been going through his bags, Barton’s a better shot with a gun than a groom should be, Barton’s voice changes when he doesn’t think anyone important is listening.
?” Bucky’s voice asks. “
“Not enough time to look in a mirror, I take it,” Sam says. Steve looks back at him, nonplussed. “Your coat is buttoned wrong. You can’t go out like that, what will the neighbours think?”
“Tomorrow?” Steve asks, but Sam is already out the door.
“If you get arrested again, I’m not coming to get you until tomorrow.”
Ms Van Dyne whisks him away on her arm and off to a chaise on the other side of the room.
Every step feels like it takes forever. Steve can’t run fast enough. His body is failing him again. His legs won’t listen as he urges them faster, and the gap between him and the wall seems insurmountable.
Sleep is a rare luxury in the weeks to come. Steve spends his days sketching and attending to the everyday business of life with Sam and his evenings on the road, holding up coaches as politely as he can.
,” Bucky’s false shade tells him. “
“I’m usually more aware,” Steve says. “I… I apologise, it is good to see you Sir Anthony.”
“I fear from the look on your face and the damage you are threatening to do to my stonework that I may need to,” Sir Anthony says. “I'm sorry if anyone said anything to offend you. I can ask them to leave if you wish.”
“It does not show,” Steve assures him. Sir Anthony smiles, quick and bright, enough to set Steve’s heart beating a little faster. He knows he is smiling back, a little too soft for what propriety would allow, and he tries to school his features back to what they should be, but it is a hopeless fight. “Would you continue? I would love to hear more.”
His brain is working at things as he daubs the paint onto the paper, frowning as the brush lines do not come out quite right. He gets his brush a little too wet and watches in dismay as the brown paint spills over, rolling down across the rest of the picture, bleeding into the green of the grass.
“I find I can do little else.”
“Excellent. Reply to the letter and I’ll go tell my family that we’ll be leaving tomorrow.”
In the bag there is a book. Steve frowns and tips it out onto the desk.
As Steve and Sam enter the room, they both turn to look at them, as though it is Steve and Sam who are the interlopers here.
The elevator stops and the doors slide open, revealing a room full of computers. Steve looks around at them. They look older than he is. He’s never seen anything like it outside of a historical drama. Dozens of old CRT monitors, all facing inwards, as though meant to be seen by one person. His friend Scott, who helps him with the website and with his less… legal research, has a set up with three screens, but this is way beyond that.
“And once again, you have the advantage,” Tony mutters, clearly quietly enough that Steve is not supposed to overhear. “Captain Rogers, every time I have the measure of you, I find myself mistaken.”
He needs a surgeon. But a wound like this will raise questions, and Tony is sure to have his people looking around for anyone with mysterious pistol wounds. He can’t go home, either, not while pursuit is still a possibility. He is only grateful that it has been a dry week so the ground is firm and will not hold hoofprints.
“I assure you that dancing is not as difficult as it seems,” she says. “You just copy everyone else and smile like you’re having a good time. A bit like the rest of society, but set to music.”
, Steve is unsure.
“Perhaps, but the chestnut seems more surefooted,” he says and Sir Anthony looks at him in surprise. “I may have been an infantry man, but I have been around enough horses in my life. The bay has the easier temperament, but the chestnut will put in the effort.”
“I daresay they have not missed a hair on my head. You, on the other hand-” he sweeps his eyes over Steve’s body in a way that makes Steve flush and reminds him of Mrs Romanoff’s words. “You have a very noticeable presence and I would-”
“Good, your ego is just fine as it is,” Mrs Romanoff says, her voice cutting off that conversation. “Now everything between us is out in the open, we might perhaps see about making your little mission slightly less…” Mrs Romanoff trails off, looking at Steve with raised eyebrows. He winces. “They know you’re onto them, that’s one reason why I am inclined to treat this evidence-” she waves towards the note “-with less credence than I otherwise would.”
Tony is mostly missing - his apologies are sent with a note that he is at a crucial stage in the development of his latest contraption. Sam will not hear of him being interrupted.
Like sneaking out in the middle of the night, changing Liberty’s markings with the soot bucket and riding out to lie in wait.
He should feel something. But all he feels is the cold and the strange echoing nothing in his chest, like he’s been hollowed out and stripped down.
“I wouldn't want to step on their feet,” he says, trying not to think of Peggy and the dance they never had.
The Wilson family is sad to see Sam go, and Steve cannot doubt their sincerity when they express regrets over his leaving as well. Their welcome has been a warm one and he is honoured that they have accepted him so generously. This is what he fought for, he reminds himself.
The woman’s shot goes wild and their horses, clearly unused to the sound of gunfire, rear up and begin to run. Seeing his chance slipping through his fingers, Steve swings himself onto Liberty just as the voices start to cry out in the distance. The militia.
He starts putting the things back into the chest and heads to his bed, heart heavy with unreasonable disappointment. The room is frigid, his sheets cold from disuse and the early morning world is a dismal grey.
“Steve,” he says slowly. “You really are terrible at this.”
Steve doesn’t look up as Bucky goes through his usual Friday night routine. He doesn’t look up because he wouldn’t usually look up, and he is trying very hard to make it seem like this is any other Friday.
“Thank you for the company. I shall be sure to remember it.”
It doesn’t sound like one of their songs, though, there is no trilling or quick-fingering that Steve can tell, it is not one of the new, fashionable jigs that get played at every outing to Stark Manor. It is a melancholy aire, with weight behind it, played with more than skill; it is played with emotion.
“Maybe I thought the better of it,” Barton says. “What is it that you’re looking for?”
“Not a chance!” Steve says. “Liberty and I will never concede a-” Sam has already urged his horse into a canter and Steve laughs as he and Liberty take up pursuit. The question of Steve’s identity fading away - at least for now.
“I have never met a man less greedy in my life, You have given me-”
“Captain Rogers!”
“Your mother’s romantic soul, no doubt,” Stane says.
“Looking for a treat to give the horse, sir,” the groom - Barton, Steve recalls - says. He is looking carefully down at the ground. Steve eyes him suspiciously.
Sam looks around.
Steve is faster than a normal man, but Barton is quick on the trigger - accurate, too. Steve and Liberty are already moving when he feels the lead ball tear into his back.
“He’s a gentleman,” Barton says. “All gentlemen are accomplished liars.”
He can do this.
“I guess magic loses its appeal when you’ve seen it used for war. I’ve heard what Hydra was doing on the front lines was…” He pauses.
“You are dead,” Steve says to the spectre. “You're dead and you'll never dance again and I am… at a party.” It feels horrific just to contemplate the idea, that he has the nerve to stand here at a party he does not wish to attend, when Bucky was the one who loved to dance, who would have enjoyed flirting with all the pretty young people looking for a heroic husband.
“Stand on my feet. You’re going to need to hold on tight,” Stark tells him. His voice sounds rough and so close it sends a shiver down Steve’s spine.
“If you don’t want the rumours, then maybe stop looking at him like that,” Sam suggests. “Otherwise, propose and have done with it. Then no one will have anything to say. Nothing is as boring to society as a married couple.”
“You too, Captain Wilson,” Tony says, smiling pleasantly. “Sorry to impose on your solitude, but Captain Rogers invited me to view his sketches and as I found myself in the area, this seemed as good a time as any.”
“I take it from your expression that you don't intend to leave well enough alone,” Sam says. “Although I have known you less than a year and already I could have guessed that without seeing you at all.”
It is somewhat of a relief, therefore, to be bound to Stark Manor, where Steve does at least know that his host has no interest in marrying him off, for all Sir Anthony seems amused by the machinations of the rest of the neighbourhood, which is probably why he has invited them all tonight.
“Then what could his purpose be? He did go through our saddlebags.”
He does not hesitate again, it is better to get this task over and done with and slip away. If there are eyes on him, he does not know where they are, and to pause would only make it more likely he is spotted.
” Bucky tells him and Steve can practically picture his eye roll. “
Then why is it that Mr Stane makes all of Steve’s hair stand on end?
.” Steve breathes out through his nose, long and calm, reminding himself that it is only his mind. Bucky is not there. This is not a ghost, except in as much as it is a ghost of Steve’s memory.
The close shave has his heart thudding in his chest, but he feels more exhilarated than anything. The question of Barton is a curious one. He would swear that Barton’s voice is not one of the two he heard that night at the inn, but if the man has the ability to disguise it, that means very little. If Barton is one of the two people he overheard, then that changes things. It would make sense. Top secret designs, orders and documents must come in and out of the baronet’s house on a regular basis. Tony is thoroughly entrenched in advancing military technologies, as evidenced by his conversations with Sam about airship design and the work Steve has seen with his own eyes in Tony’s workshop.
It is Sir Anthony, sitting at the piano and looking more at home than Steve has ever seen him outside of his workshop. His fingers dance over the keys as he moves with the music. His back is not that poker-straight upright line that most people seem to have when playing the piano, it sways from side to side, his head moving with it, like he can’t help himself from moving with the music.
“This conversation is pointless. We have to prepare for this evening,” says Steve, tearing himself away from the window.
“And which do I look like this time?” Steve asks.
“No, no. It’s quite alright. It’s good to see you again. I hope that Tony hasn’t kept you waiting too long. He’s in his workshop. A new project, no doubt.” Stane gestures for Steve to take a seat. His manner is welcoming enough, but Steve does not like the look in his eyes. “Of course, you haven’t known him long enough to know how he is. Tony’s life is a series of projects and obsessions. As soon as he finds a new one, he quite forgets what he was interested in before. He hasn’t found anything or anyone who can hold his interest for longer than a couple of months.”
“Alright,” Iron Man - who absolutely is Tony Stark, meme be damned - says and steps forwards. “How are you with heights?”
“I should imagine not,” Sir Anthony says. “My thanks for allowing me the use of the piano,” he says to Steve, inclining his head. “But I fear I have taken up too much of your day. I must take my leave.”
“One of them was trying to keep that safe,” Steve says. “More than anything else. They didn’t even check the rest of their bags, but that thing, they were clutching onto like it was more precious than life itself.”
Steve draws in a deep breath as she turns around to face him and they bow and curtsey to each other and the steps begin.
“Captain Wilson! It is good to see you. I must apologise to you as well for the invasion.”
“Thanks to you - but after what you overheard, do you honestly believe Hydra is not still lurking?”
“Of course,” she says. “Come along, Clint.”
The fact the room was locked, the fact that all of these things were locked away, that would mean that, whoever they were, they had come back. They had repacked their tools and closed the door to this room forever.
Steve sighs, looking at it.
“I’m glad to hear it,” Steve says with a nod. “I shall be on my way then. Thank you for your consideration in seeing me to the door.”
“And why should we?” the man asks. Steve smiles and cocks his pistol. The woman pulls out her own.
“Captain Rogers,” Sir Anthony greets him with a firm handshake. “My thanks for coming this evening. I know these sorts of occasions are not your idea of a good time.”
“I have seen invasions, Sir Anthony,” Sam says, “and they have never had such enjoyable accompaniment.”
“He looks away when you look back,” Mrs Romanoff tells him. “But he does look.” Steve can feel himself tense up more, his shoulders rising stiffly. “If you're interested in a brief affair, you could do far worse.”
“Because Captain Rogers is not just
