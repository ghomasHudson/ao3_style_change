‘There’s a first time for everything, they say…’ as she moved with the grace of a ballerina to face Cap.
‘Every time you got in my face after a fight. Told me I wasn’t good enough, couldn’t follow your command, my mind wandered to this. Me fucking you, anywhere really,…fuck…better than I’d imagined.’
His hips and the moulds of his ass were clearly marred by the pressure that had previously been forced there by eager hands. He swallowed the bile that burned at his throat, threatening to escape its cage.
It took him by surprise when he felt a pressure in his loins. He felt himself stir when he finally reached himself, soapy fingers lightly grazing his now half hard erection. He restrained himself, letting his glistening prick rest in his trembling palm, hesitating.
Another more predominant silhouette joined her side. Nick Fury stared into the horizon, hands firmly clasped behind his back, ’If this doesn’t make them sort their shit out, nothing will.’
Anger makes you do ridiculous things, and hopefully when all is said and done, Tony will realize that he has only himself to blame. Smut, dark tony actions and slightly humiliated cap (still headstrong though) and possibly feelings in the next chapter. Tony won't exactly be kind as he is hurt and lashing out at everything and as he as always felt strongly about cap, well desires and rage mix up! Might take one or 2 weeks until next update, life problems :) Thanks for your kudos comments and ideas.
‘Arggg ahh…W-why? We- we had a, a d-deal…I-I don’t…want...t-this. You can't.…’ Steve questioned, a hint of betrayal flashing through his irises. He knew he had the strength to topple his abuser off of him, but not without causing a ruckus.
For a moment, things settled down, until Bruce shyly raised his hand, ‘Hm, one question…’ he paused, ‘Why them?’ Bruce asked. Bruce wasn’t stupid, both men were remarkable and quite the team when they worked together. Yet, it was easier said than done.
Tears welled in Steve's blue orbs, his blood was pumping fast, fueled by anger as it pulsed through his veins, tickling his senses. Steve never wanted any of this.
His balled fist suddenly smashed the shower wall at an angle, the flat of his hand crushing the tiles, leaving wet dust permeating the air, settling at the bottom of his wet feet, melding with the water. He hadn’t restrained his strength, leaving the foundations of the room cracking.
To be honest, being Captain America never really gave him the opportunity for time off. In retrospect, Tony had been right, he was a bit uptight. Tony’s lavish life style would at least come in handy, not that Steve felt comfortable in such a way of life anyway. Some people were simply born with a silver spoon in their mouth.
Breaking Steve’s defensive guard, he aimed for his friend’s exposed chest with expert precision and stealth, startling Steve. Bucky ignored Steve’s feeble attempts at dislodging him and held strong.
‘I hate you,’ was said repeatedly like a mantra.  Each time, it broke Steve’s heart a little bit more. Holding his weight with only one hand on the bar, Steve let his arm fall to reach for Tony’s chest, only to be reprimanded with a tightened grip on his wrist. Tony might not have realized his confession, but the glare Steve received froze him at his core, like he had been frozen once again in the ice.
'Too bad, I don't give a shit what you want, Rogers. Or have you forgotten my little package already?'
For now, he would play by Tony’s rules. At least until he found a way out of this, which didn’t sound that promising.
Steve had heard that word before, from Stark’s treacherous mouth. A loud pang pierced at his heart, guilt washing over him from being so secretive.
He let his body take this burden and closed his eyes wishing for this to be over. Mixed with the pain, he felt a fleeting moment of pleasure in the corners of his belly. Steve hated himself for it.
Steve anxiously paced around, every once in a while searching for his companion. There was still no sign of Tony or Agent Hill.
Tony was roused from his thoughts by the calm voice of his fellow scientist friend, ‘Hey buddy, don’t worry about it…I’m sure Steve will come around…’
Tony cut Maria off mid sentence, mumbling under his breath, ‘Why don’t I ever get these assignments?’ while casually slurping his coffee loudly.
‘Still, Cap had a point. What do you need our skills for? Aside from Nat and I, the others aren’t really suitable for stealth missions, if you know what I mean…’ Clint spared a glance in Thor’s direction who seemed to be oblivious as to what it meant.
Tony felt his balls tightening, the head of his penis becoming sensitive. Steve was getting looser and looser by the minute. He slowed his pace to witness the debauched man before him. Steve was bruised and marked by Tony, as if he were his property, as if he had been branded with Tony’s mark.
Once more, the feeling of loneliness clawed at him. He wasn’t sure if Bucky would come back. He had pushed him away in haste. Letting raw emotions get the best of him.
‘There’s no one else here, Stark.’ He paused for a second, his gaze buried deep within Tony’s, his voice stone cold, enough to mask Steve’s apprehension.
Tony finally shows his cards and wants to show Steve who is in charge for once. His previous desires mixing with his resentment, hurt and anger pushing him to a horrible situation. Steve only has his words to fight against what tony has in mind.
‘This isn’t Seniors Night at the community center, Steve.  It’s a luxury resort,” Tony’s tone changed bit, moving just a hair towards being forceful.
The bed creaked in synch with each of Tony’s thrusts. At this point, it was a miracle Bucky hadn’t woken up. Steve had to fight this, but his mind and body were at war with each other.
For some of you, it might not be what you expected to read. Tony is going in territories he might regret later and Steve, well he tries to understand both sides and still feels guilty, even though Tony has his part to play.
'Better not lose this one…'  Steve took notice of the object discarded at his feet and quickly tamed his stupor. Tony’s chocolate brown eyes turned a shade darker, ‘I like having you on speed dial…’
‘T-Tony…It…h-hurts…Stop this!’ Steve managed to say in between angry sobs. It only edged Tony further, his dick pulsing inside.
Steve waited patiently at the helipad of the Avengers Tower, the cool breeze of the morning air lightly grazing the side of his cheek. All he had was a small, tightly packed bag that laid at his feet.
‘I see your mouth complaining, Rogers, but look at you. You like this? The…pain? The…hurt?’ asked Tony, accentuating every word rhythmically with his digits as they were buried deep in Cap’s burgeoning orifice.
But what greeted him at the entrance was not his friend. He stared at the vacant space, his eyes looking around for anyone, until his sight locked onto an ostentatious basket.
Tony’s cock went deeper, pushing Steve’s shaky form further up to the headboard. So much so that Steve had to dig his fingers in the mattress for leverage to stop his head from bumping into it. The captain tried to keep his reactions under control.
Not caring for Steve’s weak attempts at fighting him off, he angled himself better, taking his time plunging in, exploring once more the confines of Steve’s tight heat. He slowly picked up the pace, keeping the rhythm steady, careful not to spill too quickly.
‘Something like that.... Just some stuff is harder to shake off is all. Nothing to worry about, Buck. Leave it alone.’
Thor pounded the wooden table with both of his hands, startling his SHIELD brothers, his glee radiating from him, ’That is wonderful news!’
The blow was so fast, Tony didn't even have time to brace himself before the fist connected with the side of his jaw, unsettling a few bones.
Sorry for the delay, I got lost writing this chapter... My mind made Tony more cruel than expect, so I changed the tags in case.
‘Not that it makes any fucking difference to me. I’m not one to shy away from an audience…Imagine his face if he saw me balls deep in you… fuck, still so tight.’ His dick gave an appreciative twitch that made the soldier grunt.
‘That may be more difficult for some of you than others,’ as she brought her attention back to the rest of the group, ‘but we need to get to the bottom of what is going on here. It’s the perfect front. HYDRA would stand to gain a lot from a presence there.’
Again, I am not knowledgeable in the Accords very much and the likes, but if you have ideas of where this could go, I always welcome different ideas.
Steve’s insults fell on deaf ears while Tony decided to occupy himself more by ravishing the planes of Steve’s shoulder blades with bruising kisses and grazing teeth.
Steve’s knees buckled under the heavy weight of Tony’s harsh words, leaving his body a shaking mess on the floor. He was powerless.
‘How come I’ve never heard of this place before? Seems like somewhere I’d fit right in,’ he said cheekily.
It was evident from Steve's stance that he would fight back this time. Tony couldn't be prouder. It would make his victory so much more satisfying and Steve's life so much more arduous.
‘I don’t understand, why can’t we just storm the island?’ chimed Steve, running his hands through his hair and letting out a deep breath.
Tony was ecstatic. He had always enjoyed messing with America’s golden boy, but it was always meant to be in a playful manner; he had come to enjoy Steve and his presence. Messing with him was just Tony’s way of showing his affection to the man.
‘Fuck, I missed this, Steve…tight as fuck…’ Tony exhaled, burying himself in the scent of Steve’s damp hair.
‘Is that a question, or a fact?’ sassed Steve, unmoving. His eyes speaking volumes as Tony’s conviction hardened. A slap connected with his cheek, whipping his face to the side.
Steve exhaled loudly, crushing the pencil in his hands with a loud crack. All it did was make Tony’s smile broaden on his face.
After going through Tony's punishment, Steve goes back home, but now he has to deal with his conflicted feelings and how to keep this from Bucky. He needs to learn how to deal with what happened.
‘Just got us some coffee down the street and I can cover my tracks just fine. No need to bite my head off.’
He turned his back to lock the door behind him only to feel a silhouette shift in the shadows. It wasn't faint in the slightest.
Their pants mixed together, depraved and lustful. Tony was so close; his body was strained by his impending orgasm.
A meaty palm shot roughly to his mouth, stifling Steve’s startled protests as the head of Stark’s hard cock finally made it past that tight ring of muscle. Steve’s wails were effectively cut off by Tony’s hand as Tony enjoyed the warm squeeze of Steve’s clenched asshole.
A wet tongue breached his lips, demanding submission as it explored the cavernous expanse of his warm cavity. Steve moaned when he felt Tony tug at his uniform, forcing him to be bare. He could feel and hear the rips of the blue fabric under the pull of Tony’s left hand while the other hand grabbed forcibly at his tousled hair, locking Steve in place, unable to escape.
Whoever shared this space with him didn't care for subtlety at all which gave a hint to whom it was.
‘How dare you! I fuckin’ hate you! You just grew under my skin like cancer and…fuck… I let myself…’ love you, was left unsaid. Tony couldn’t finish the sentence.
Steve’s mind was clouded by a veil of uncertainty, thinking of reasons as to why Bucky couldn’t see that he was trying to protect him.
When the words left his mouth, it felt wrong saying them, but Tony brought this upon himself.  At least that’s what Steve needed to tell himself to reconcile with the fact that he had actually thought about killing the man.
‘I don’t think that’s how the saying goes…I believe it’s more along the lines of things to do, people to see,’ Clint’s eyebrows raised in confusion, curious to see what Stark had meant.
The resort looked really expensive with its vast pools and large palm tree areas. It looked like the perfect hideout, but for what?
Tony stared into the empty void in front of him, the phantom squeeze of Natasha’s comforting grip grounding him. He clenched his eyes shut, a fire ablaze within his heart. He was angry at Rogers for not trusting him.
The tiny strands of loose hair at the back of his neck were standing up in alert as he stepped foot in the dark lit room with a cautious step.
‘You should be ashamed of yourself. I hope whatever comes from this was worth the consequences. I can't...This won’t happen again.’ Steve looked up, unafraid of leaving his back turned to his enemy. Tony was slighted, Steve might have been a liar, but he knew Stark would at least keep his word.
‘As much as I loath to say it, Stark’s a genius and his mastery of technology and computers makes him a valuable asset to gather intel undetected.’
Tony’s breath hitched when the object of his affection and recently, his frustrations, stood in front of him in all of his 6 foot 2 glory, broad shoulders and muscled chest contained within the confines of his battered Captain America suit, the grey silvery star popping out of his chest.
He could bitterly taste the disappointment in Steve’s little whelps and yips through his unrelenting thrusts, but he didn’t give a damn. His compassion for Steve had been left on the cold, bloody ground of Siberia. All that was left was his lust and yearning to control the man who made his life difficult. Steve’s hole clenching around his dick felt wonderful. He was already devising a new plan to get his dick wet in the future.
‘We had two agents go missing on a simple reconnaissance mission. We had received solid intel that there was a possible HYDRA base located on a small, remote island in the Pacific. We found out that this potential base is currently functioning as a high-end luxury vacation resort…’
The hoarse voice cut through the veil of silence. Steve’s body responding to the command, his face unreadable. He paced his steps, taking his time before crowding over Tony’s personal space.
Steve stilled in front of the door, the coldness of the air reddening his cheeks, making him shiver.
It was Tony’s turn to remain quiet. It only made him double his efforts. If Steve was still this snarky, Tony figured he wasn’t doing something right.
Tony’s smile grew impossibly bigger at the challenge. His brown eyes plummeted a shade darker, a tint of red inside. His composure had left the building and only his rage fueled desires were left to take the reigns. He would show Rogers the pain he had endured at his hands while all he had sought after had been someone to believe in him as much as he did.
Tony squinted his eyes at Steve, patting his own clothes, offended Steve would even suggest such a thing.
He panicked when his teary sight zeroed in on the hands that brutally shoved his legs apart, Tony’s frame nestling in between them while holding his hard dick near his entrance.
Natasha turned slightly to face the oncoming figures she felt at their backs, while Steve kept his sights on the dawn rising behind the vast view of the city of New York.
‘Tsk. Tsk tsk...We wouldn't want your best pal to wake up, now, would we?’ He rolled his pelvis, reaching new depths within the man, his cock firmly grasped within Steve’s inner walls.
‘That’s it….yeahhh… God bless America! You feel so good around me,’ replied Tony as he sheathed himself inside that warm, welcoming heat after so long. Steve’s muscles were enveloping his cock so tightly, like a warm embrace.
Those dark eyelashes fluttered close, taking in their close proximity while Steve laid there, waiting for his next order. Something pulled at Steve; an urge to touch and hug Tony in an attempt to appeal to him, to show him how he regretted everything. Instead, all that came out of his mouth was a simple and doting, ‘Tony…’
Of course, Steve would at least use his words to keep some semblance of strength. A barrier to prove to Tony that this wouldn’t hurt him as much.
Steve finally caught on to what was happening, thinking ‘Oh no…You gotta be kidding me…’ with his mouth gaping open like a fish. As for Tony, his sparling brown eyes simply grew wide in recognition, muttering a small, 'yes!'. It was worth it simply to witness the Captain's dumfounded look.
Tony’s eyes were slowly rolling to the back of his head, the lack of oxygen blurring his vision, stinging his red eyes. A vision of him, laying motionless on the cold ground of Siberia, while Steve’s shield loomed over Tony flashed in front of him.
His body now wore the marks of Tony’s indiscretions, a canvas to Stark’s perverse fantasies. Steve perused his bed to where the sheets were tangled and in disarray.
Maria had expected some of the Avengers to be a bit suspicious as to why they had selected Captain America and Iron Man for the mission. For sure, there were better alternatives, but Nick Fury had been adamant about it.
‘I-...m-more…d-don’t st…op..fuck...s-shit…N-no,’  Steve mumbled shyly. He wanted to die for having been so physically weak.
The rim of his ass pushed hard against the bold, bulbous head trying to breach his passage. Nerve endings were stretched past his pain threshold, he never felt such pain and the super soldier had lived through a lot. He was aware that Tony meant for him to be in pain and as much as he worked against Tony, he had to stop fighting.
Without the use of his limbs, Steve was useless. If he used his strength, Bucky would hear for sure. It was getting harder and harder to fight his body’s impulses.
It was hard to shift his attention between Tony’s aggravating voice and what was slowly stretching him apart. The elastic band of his boxers was cutting into his skin, stopping his blood flow. His thighs felt numb. Only Tony’s presence afforded him a sense of reality.
His senses might have been dulled a little since his reunion with Steve, however, his nostrils had picked up a familiar scent. One that could only be from Tony Stark.
‘You call this pathetic excuse for a kiss, a kiss?’ snorted Tony, his pupils fueled with fire, ‘Don’t you dare pull this shit again, soldier. Kiss me like you mean it.’
Maria nodded in acknowledgment, divulging some details of the mission at hand, ‘That’s correct. Two of you will be going undercover to figure out what happened and if need be, intercept and stop them. It’s imperative that you go unnoticed and stay out of the spotlight,’ Maria cut the silence as her eyes locked onto Tony’s unimpressed stare.
Everyone looked at each other, unsure of how to respond. All of their gazes settled on a dumbstruck Tony Stark who was frozen in place. His fists were curled tightly, his knuckles almost white.
Steve winced, a lasting ache filling his body, making his movements sluggish as if he were made of lead.
Good call, they both thought. The last thing they needed was for one of them to slip up while hurling insults at each other.
Heat pooled at the pearly white silk collar of Tony’s expensive shirt. His delicate hand unconsciously brushing over it, tugging against it to allow himself to breathe. The nervousness pulling at him, making him uneasy. Perhaps, he hadn’t thought about this too much. However, the dark part of him crushed the hesitance underneath its boot with ease, using the man’s resentment and infatuation as tools to degrade and punish his long-time ally for his perceived slights against him.
‘Back off, Stark! You burned your bridges and I hope for your sake Bucky never finds out about this...I'm not sure I'd stop him from killing you.’
Bucky could still read Steve, even after his time in captivity. The man in front of him was running, and it irked him the wrong way. Nonetheless, he had to be patient and temper his body, lowering his stance.
It rocked Steve’s body forward, almost pushing him off balance. It was difficult to comprehend. Stark’s dick kept hitting that spot inside him that made him choke on his own saliva. He whimpered and let himself be fucked into the wall. They shook with the strength of it all. Dust particles flew around them, unsettled from their perch.
'Whatever you're looking for here, you won't get it anymore, so leave,' Steve stated, his voice clipped while his tone was threatening.
Hateful comments or anything that isn't constructive will not be tolerated. If you don't like it, or the direction it is going, you may leave.
Steve’s large dick stirred in those callused fingers, the friction difficult to withstand. Those dextrous fingers stroking at his sensitive length alongside the languid shoves of Tony’s dick were pleasant. He couldn’t help each moan that made it past his saliva coated lips.
The force in which he was pistoned was starting to hurt him, the previously self supplied lubricant was slowly dissipating under the brutal pace. The girth of Tony’s fingers was starting to burn inside him, his inner walls constricting. Steve winced and tried to shuffle his stance to avoid the pain, but Tony countered his movements, pinning him in place.
God, he loved to ruffle Steve’s feathers. Something about seeing Steve angry excited him on multiple levels.
It left him to ponder the implications of such damning evidence. Stark was enjoying his pain, his slow descent into misery.
Voilà! Hope you liked it. I love the character development aspect so much. Poor Steve, but he keeps strong! I wonder for how long? Tony is ….well.... in a very dark place and it will keep on coming. Thanks so much for the positive reviews, kudos and comments! Next chapter explores Tony's rage and plans for STeve and Steve's comeback to home...
His abs flexed whenever he felt the head of Tony’s cock brush against his prostate, sending his head flying back, his throat free for Tony to suck on. His hands automatically reached behind the nape of Tony’s neck. It felt tense and it was burning. Tony kept fucking him until all that was heard in the compound were grunts, pleas and sounds of slapping flesh.
‘You left us to die and for what?’ The buck of Tony’s hips against Steve’s hole was brutal and erratic.
Steve took the bait, standing at the edge of his seat, ready to pounce while Tony’s open stance clearly invited him to try.
His body was nearing its limit, he wasn’t young anymore and he could feel himself getting closer with every little sway of Steve’s hips to meet him. Tony’s eyes glistened, the betrayal glazing over his rival’s pupils.
His cock pulsed one last time, until white spurts of cum were wrenched away from him, coating Steve’s golden locks, currently hiding his dazed face as well as his firm pecs.
‘Consider me surprised, then!’ exclaimed Tony, mockingly. ‘I’d never have guessed. You were always flustered whenever sex was mentioned.’
In the last few days, following Stark’s ghastly visit, Steve had been out and about in the city, trying to help whoever needed it.  It wasn’t the smartest thing to do, he knew he should be laying low for the time being, but he needed to get out and clear his head.
The blissful visions before him encouraged Tony to share his dark urges while he burrowed his dick in Steve’s tight hole.
Steve let his eyes flutter closed, shame coloring his heated flesh. His cock betraying him as it twitched with each touch from Tony’s searching hands. His head lowered in irritation, his jaw clenched to show resistance.
‘A..Ai…r. T-Tony, I can’t…b-breathe…’ His blue eyes floated on salty tears before they rolled down his cheek up to Tony’s hand. Tony barely acknowledged it with a glance, devoid of feelings. It terrified Steve to find nothing there. All the light had been snuffed out, leaving darkness in its wake. For a second, Steve thought this was it.
‘That’s because one of our agents was enhanced and even with that, they were still compromised. We lost all communications. Once there, it’s a total blackout. You’ll be alone out there, without backup. This mission requires a certain skillset…’
Steve sniggered at that, ‘This might not be a bad thing after all. Stark has his shortcomings, but he might teach you a thing or two.’
Enjoy this new chapter guys, I try to keep the updates every two weeks to a month. Life stuff is happening, so in the meantime, enjoy tony been mean to steve!
There was no illusion. Tony made sure he had dug his proverbial claws deeply into Steve and Steve had no one else to run to.
That agitated the soldier more than he wanted to. Leaping forward, he closed the gap between the two grown men, his hand grasping at Tony's black shirt, bringing him closer. The billionaire genuinely looked startled for a brief moment by Steve's confrontational nature.
He was punched into submission for his trouble. The super soldier’s vision was blurred, his temple might have been hit, impairing his sight for a short moment. He pushed himself back up, only to be reprimanded again, with a pointed, ‘Stay down.’
Without preparation, it was hard for Steve’s muscles to get used to the offending girth probing him. Yet, the friction from the fabric rubbing at his now very hard cock made his body warm.
When Tony passed the transparent windows of the conference room, he saw all of the Avengers gathered around the circular table, some waiting more patiently than others.
Steve found it somewhat easy to let himself be guided, taken. There was no decision to make, no responsibility, just letting himself be used at the behest of his… friend? Enemy? He wasn’t sure anymore.
‘You know damn well why, so back off!’ Steve had no idea how things had escalated so quickly, but Tony had to understand why. Lives were at stake, here!
How could Tony ask this of him? It wouldn’t do to anger the man further, therefore he kept his mouth shut.
Steve shook his head in disgust, offended that Tony assumed he liked to be hurt. The stimuli were too much, especially to someone without any experience. He growled as he braced himself on the wall, the pads of his fingers pressing at the foundations of the building.
His hand ghosted over his fair skin as he slowly got up on wobbly legs. Super Soldier or not, the bruises were still fresh and quite apparent. Finger shaped wounds stuck to his skin.
‘What the hell, Tony!’ exclaimed Steve, his words impossible to make sense of since his voice was restricted. Tony’s hand wouldn’t budge no matter how much he tried to bite at it with his teeth. All it did was move Tony’s cock deeper within him with every struggle.
Tony looked and his face crunched in apparent disgust, ‘By the way, these last names suck…’ he finished by shoving the offending document in his back pocket. Steve mirrored Tony’s actions, his stored safely in his breast pocket.
‘More threats?… H-haven't you done enough al…ready?’ Steve asked, his pupils burning holes through Tony’s skull from the side.
‘Fuck, this shit all started when you met with Stark!’ Bucky’s worn out body was shaking now, his grip strengthening.
Steve didn’t know why, but as much as Tony had the moxie to be Iron Man, Steve just couldn’t deal with Stark’s whimsical demeanor. This man was a child. How could he be trusted to co-lead a team?
Tony’s emotions flew through his actions. He angled his thrusts deeper, ensuring the most pleasure for him and most pain for his victim. Tony wore his grief on his sleeve, it ate him up inside. The alcohol coursed through his veins making him bold. The power he currently held was exhilarating.
‘Jesus, Tony…Let it go. People are counting on us to do this right…’ Steve protested, hoping that Tony would, for once, not make a mountain out of a molehill.
‘You think this is over?! I’m just getting started here, Cap! Thanks for the fuck, but I’ll find your sweet ass again! I’m not finished with you yet!”
It was clear that Tony had no concern for his comfort. Steve’s puckering asshole made it hard for Tony to push past the ring even with the wetness that clung to his porcelain skin.
The pounding grew desperate and hectic, no rhythm to follow. When Steve tried to reach his manhood, he was quickly swatted away, ordered to grab the bar above his head instead to brace himself.
He heard the shuffle of clothes, probably Tony putting on his discarded jacket and fixing up his pants. Tony’s back was turned, shielding his expression from him.
Clint piped up, breaking some of the tension, ‘Awww man, why does he get to go?’ His finger pointed to Tony accusingly.
He tried to keep his bodily reactions in check, but his focus was crumbling miserably as he felt himself buck against the mattress for relief, since Tony’s hands were nowhere near his private parts.
Maria rolled her eyes as she started her briefing, ‘Alright, listen up…’ she began as a hologram appeared behind her as she swiped through files on a tablet in her hands. The profiles of two SHIELD agents came into focus as the Avengers settled in.
Steve slowly let his eyes flutter open, observing Tony’s closed off expression as he drilled him, back and forth, until Steve was a mess. Through his dazed state, he saw the pain that painted Tony’s face.
Her voice felt distant to the soldier’s attuned ears, ‘You’ll just have to see…’ she said taking her leave slowly but surely, her parting words embedded in Steve’s head.
After a while, hot steam began to occupy most of the small space, cozying up the room, appeasing Steve’s nerves a little.
Steve's facial features suddenly morphed to stone, his own body betraying him as a slight tremor pulsed through his core, numbing his body.
Steve let himself fall to his knees, incapable of forming a response. Tony was now the ever imposing presence looming over his defeated figure. There were no illusions as to who held all the power and Tony was drunk on it.
Steve stared at the ceiling, gathering his thoughts and his wits. He had to show Tony that whatever he had done had not broken him. He glimpsed at his unresponsive flesh.
It didn’t take long for Tony to leave the room, closing the door behind him, preparing himself for what was to come.
Oh my god! Uploading this was super complicated, but I managed. Not thanks to my VPN! Still, I found a way and surprise you have the next chapter a bit earlier. Enjoy this installment, (feels a bit rapey, but since not much violence and steve has given his 'consent' along unwillingly, I marked it dubious) Might change later *beginning of forceful stuff happening, hope you enjoy this Tony embracing his dark Steve and poor Steve trying to deal with this
The odds weren’t in their favor. He didn’t know what to expect. He was 100 percent certain Fury withheld crucial information. There had to be an ulterior motive to sending both of them there.
In his haste, Tony forgot about the hand grasping Steve’s throat and in frustration kept clenching, cutting off any air from reaching Steve’s brain. Steve started to feel faint, his erection starting to wane. He bucked his hips in an effort to push Tony off, but all it did was make Tony more eager to reach nirvana.
Steve tried the best he could to reign in his pained groan at the strain on his nape, as Bucky’s calloused fingers skimmed the phantom bruises.
‘I still don’t see the problem…’ Steve shrugged as he wondered why Tony had such a vested interest in what he was bringing to the resort. It’s not like he had much to bring in the first place, anyways.
‘Dyed it. Cut it. I’m Tony Stark, Cap, wealthy people definitely will know who that is, but that’s not important right now.’ Waving his hand quickly, dismissing the matter, his mind focused entirely on something more pressing.
Steve felt ashamed by how his dick was now standing at attention, seeking contact after Tony’s degrading words. His flesh was on fire and every cold touch from Tony burned him with uncontrollable desire. Damn the super serum for making his refractory sense almost nonexistent.
The sudden change in Steve brought a sickening curl to Tony’s lips. Clearly he was enjoying riling Steve up. He pressed on, feasting on the soldier’s anger.
For a second, Tony Stark couldn’t believe his luck. Captain America, willing to comply to his every desire. Well, the word willing was probably debatable if you asked Steve.
‘You…want this, Steve. You’ll crave this in the..e-end…This is only the beginning aha…y-yeah… so wet for me…’ Tony muttered softly, his palm dragging over the glistening head of Steve’s manhood while his hips fucked into Steve. Tony loved how Steve’s body relented to his. His hand could feel the veins popping out from the underside of Steve’s erection with every tweak of his wrist.
don’t get to do that!’ he said through gritted teeth, grinding them together. ‘You gave up on your friends, just like you gave up on me!’ he paused, letting himself breathe, observing Tony’s reactions carefully.
‘This…this is…perfect. I can’t believe this is happening… I’m fucking Captain America…ah…Damn, Rogers… you were made for this…take it!’ shouted Tony in hilarity, as if he were speaking to no one in particular. He thrusted in an unforgiving haste, his ball sack hitting Steve in the wake of each buck.
Tony hooked his hand into the hem of Steve’s pants before roughly pulling them down, forcing Steve out of them. The remainder of Steve’s dignity laid in a heap on the floor, discarded.
At least he hadn’t cum. It was a small victory, although he had an inkling Tony hadn’t wanted for him to unless he had asked. And
They stood with their backs to each other. The tension in the room could be cut with a knife as emotions ran high.
‘Clean it up,’ he said, presenting his cock, the gleaming head lingering above Steve’s puffed lower lip.  Steve’s gaze lowered and he sighed, hot puffs of air tickling Tony’s prick tauntingly.
Him and Tony worked well under duress, but this was uncharted territory for both of them and Steve was clearly unconvinced that this wasn’t already doomed to fail.
Hello, thanks so much for the support whether if you liked it or didn't. Your comments and feedback is appreciated. This fandom is way kinder than others. Thanks to my best partner AshPotter for editing my work.
Tony would have the Soldier grovel at his feet and understand his place if he knew what was good for him.
Steve hadn’t felt powerless in such a long time, and it fueled him with such rage, that his body moved on its own, ransacking the partially ripped and sticky sheets, punching his pillow, imagining Tony’s face in its stead. However, now wasn’t the time to contemplate his own conflicted feelings. He couldn’t afford to be weak, not when his nose picked up Bucky’s familiar, earthy scent from the other side of the door. Bucky would not know.
Honestly, this last chapter was real hard to bring together and I'm not super proud of the flow of it, but meh it's out I can move on.
Luckily, none got in his eyes as they were closed, his eyelashes taking the brunt of it. Steve slightly tilted his head to the side after some cum dripped down into his mouth.
‘Stevie?’ A scratchy voice called from the depths of the room, breaking the trance that Tony had unwillingly lulled a frozen Steve into.
Unknowingly, he sucked in his lower lip into his supple mouth, shifting his stance all the while, ogling the buffet that would soon be his to sample.
Then, his blue eyes skimmed past Tony and Thor, knowing subtlety wasn’t their forte. Thor was way too loud, and Tony well, he didn’t really play well with others.
As he cleansed himself, his palms roaming all over his body, Steve recalled the harshness of Stark’s prying fingers at his hips, the other man’s girth burrowing itself deep within him, plowing him and finally, the searing pain the man’s teeth had caused him when they pierced his sensitive flesh, suckling purplish bruises.
While Steve and Tony mulled things over, the others decided to voice their opinions finally figuring out Tony and Steve had been chosen when they picked on the whimsy glances between them.
Steve’s blue eyes locked onto Tony’s, ‘Why do you always have to make an entrance? Can you be on time for anything?’
'Fucking hell, Rogers. You’ll pay for that,’ Tony mumbled under his breath as blood dribbled down his chin, coating his goatee.
Just the thought of this man made Bucky’s blood boil. How he wanted to punch him in his fucking face.
‘You look pretty with my cum all over you, Rogers…’ He squeezed harder, his forefingers grinding against bones. Steve’s brows furrowed in confusion. He didn’t know what Stark expected from him. It was done. Over.
‘Shit, you’re so tight,’ Tony grunted, then went on with his taunt. ‘Nothing too smart to say, Rogers?’
Touching the Stark Pad he had left on the table, a quick flick of his wrist and Steve heard something click. ‘There, you have an hour before Ross knows something isn’t right. I’d get to it if I were you, soldier. It would be a shame if you got fucked for nothing,’ Tony taunted, licking his lips and palming his crotch.
However, at the recesses of his mind, he could feel something tug at him, telling him he wasn’t sure how long this feeling would last.
‘Don’t lie! You fuckin’ love this, don’t you? I knew you’d be a masochistic bitch,’  Tony berated the man, adding another finger into the warm, parched passage, making himself wince.
Steve fixed his posture, his stance defensive this time. His fists were barely raised to his chest when he sensed Tony rise from his seat and move past him, their shoulders brushing against one another.
‘Well, maybe I’ll listen more if you’d take the stick out of your ass, Rogers.’ Tony flung himself out of his chair.
After hoisting up his duffle bag onto his right shoulder, he peered at Natasha, his features sporting a pensive look.

As he scurried out of the room in a huff, the room was left empty, leaving behind only the evidence of Tony’s sick games.
Tony pierced his abused hole with precision, making sure he was seated deeply within Steve. A high-pitched shriek resonated in the room, bleeding through Tony’s ears.
‘You can’t hide from me, Stevie, no one can. The sooner you learn that the better it will be for the safety of those traitors. I’m Tony fucking Stark and you’ll learn your fucking place, understood?’
‘Don’t walk away from me,’ snarled Bucky, having had enough of Steve’s bullshit. He would get to the bottom of this.
ohhhh….things are getting heated. I wonder what will happen next. Thanks for your support guys. Kudos keeps me motivation and comments will make Tony even darker hehehe. I swear this is not going where I thought it would lol My mind has a mind of its own, so wicked...
The conclusion of Steve's unexpected visit from Tony. Tony is getting worst with Steve and it seems Steve is slightly more affected by Tony's vicious words and ministrations.
Steve hummed silently, turning his back to Bucky in hopes of escaping the unwanted scrutiny, but the dark-haired man wasn’t fooled.
Tony reclined in his seat, leaning comfortably into the soft cushions of his chair. A hint of surprise flashed across his eyes.
Tony coughed as he was prompted up, Steve's grip pushing at his throat, cutting off his airflow. Spewing blood all over the other's hand as he talked, Tony flashed a bloody set of teeth, his features accentuated by the dim rays from the moon filtered by the curtains.
Suddenly, Tony lunged at Steve, grasping his shoulder. Steve flinched as if he had been burned and Tony let go as soon as he came face to face with Captain America’s famous clenched look.
‘I’d like to see you try, Cap,’ Tony ignored the empty threat and paused, ‘Besides, I won’t be responsible for what happens to that piece of shit over there if you do…you’ll be.…’
The only thing that felt real now was the unforgiving pace of Tony’s dick filling him up. His ass was dripping with their combined fluids, the noise made him blush even more and Tony’s warm breath against his back made the hair on his forearm raise upward.
Tony Stark leisurely strolled down the hall of the Avengers Tower, warm coffee a-grip and whistling a happy tune.
‘Peachy, you better get your asses ready, you leave at 0800 tomorrow morning. Happy vacation, motherfuckers. Meeting adjourned.’
'Tony, how-' Steve asked. The hand offered little to no space for him to talk, but it was enough for Tony to hear him.
When he finished, he couldn’t help the rush of adrenaline that coursed through him, the note pulverized in his unmovable grip, thrown hastily into the bin.
He smirked evilly, willing Steve’s body into submission. When would Steve understand he had no control over his fate? He had made his choice, now he’d have to lay in the sea of its consequences.
Steve had dealt with enough and turned around to glare at his once close friend. The man who had made his way into his heart at one point. His heart was hammering in his chest, he needed to make his way out of here, save his friends, shower, go home to Bucky…
‘So, this is how it’s gonna work big guy,’ Steve braced himself, listening carefully to Tony’s dark timber of a voice, echoing in the desolated room. Tony continued on, ‘You do what I tell you, exactly as I tell you without putting up much of a fuss. After all, I really can’t expect you to not fight me a little, right?’
‘Come on, it’s alright… Was it…nightmares again?’ questioned Steve’s long-lasting friend, concern written all over his face when both men stared at the overturned bed.
His eyes fluttered closed once again, barring his mind from reality, trying hard to focus solely on healing, on the pleasurable sensations of the water cascading down the moulds of his plush ass, down to the curve of his lower back only to finish its descent along his muscled calves.
And just like that, all that was left behind was the Winter Soldier’s persistent afterthought and the vacant, desolate space as Bucky walked out the door, never looking back.
The continuation of Tony's latest tryst with Steve despite Steve's constant pleas for him to stop. Tony is a man on a mission with a thirst that cannot be quenched, until trouble finds him.
Shivers traveled through his body as the sensations it brought back were none too pleasant as it reminded him of Tony Stark’s searching fingers, digging at his flesh.
7h59 a.m. Leave it to Tony Stark to show up literally just on time.  He couldn’t have spared another minute.
Tears streamed freely down Steve’s face when suddenly, his body was flipped over, breaking the trance.  Tony was now staring deeply into the eyes of the object of his most recent carnal obsession.
As much as Steve wanted to blame Tony for fucking with his life, perhaps he’d done this to himself, he had made those choices. To protect himself, he had lied, once again, but to his best friend. He couldn’t begrudge Bucky for never answering his messages, no matter how worried Steve was.
‘Ouch…S-low…down… ishh…y-your hand….b-burns…T-Tony…let…go,’ he pleaded, his bucking only encouraging Tony more, blinding him to Steve’s discomfort. Or simply ignoring him.
Tony broke the uncomfortable silence with a snarky remark meant to humiliate him. A large digit, probably a thumb, grazed Steve’s entrance with promise. He tried to clench his ass tighter, but it didn’t deter Tony from his goal when he probed harder. It felt way too dry until he heard a gross rattling only to feel something warm dribble down his crack.
Seeing Steve’s painful gasps of air and his pained features, Tony picked up the pace as he took his pleasure from Steve’s submissive body while his nails marred the sensitive flesh of Steve’s hips. The mattress creaked as the legs of the bed shook lightly with every thrust.
It stung, a whimper was coaxed involuntarily from his lips as Tony’s head pulled back lightly, only to slide back in, enjoying the resistance. Even with the lube, Steve’s unprepared entrance had trouble accommodating him. Tony reveled in Steve’s contorted face, currently imprinted in the pillow.
In a rare feat of tumultuous rage, he swept the basket off the table with his forearm, still clutching the phone tightly in his grip, leaving the fruits to stumble and scatter all over the floor in a mess.
Steve took a slow exhale, exasperated by Stark’s antics, ‘What’s wrong with my clothes? They’re very comfortable and allow for easy movement.’
The Winter Soldier’s hand clamped onto the other man’s shirt, twirling him around near the cheap wooden bathroom door, Steve’s large back forced into the weakened wall.
‘Are you ready to make it up to me, soldier?’ antagonized Tony, the pad of his thumb pressing and searching at Steve’s bottom lip like a promise.
Tony was taken aback by the harsh tone, surprised by the force behind the words. His brow arched in amusement, but inside he felt the turmoil of being yelled at.
Tony didn't seem fazed by his act, which infuriated Steve even more. Tony had fallen deeper into madness than he had previously thought if he didn't understand that what he had done was beyond acceptable.
Something felt wrong with the air, with his friend’s guarded posture and Bucky took notice of it. While calmly sipping his coffee, the Winter Soldier’s eyes narrowed at Steve’s bed, suspicion clawing at his head.
Unknown to him, the wave of panic that constricted his chest had spread to Steve’s glistening blue eyes. The Super Soldier puffed out his chest in a last ditch effort, gathering whatever was left within him to push Bucky off of him. As much as he didn’t want to hurt his newly found friend, he had to keep this silent. And for now, that meant pushing the other man away from him.
Tony finally gets to have his piece of cake while Steve tries hard to keep up with Tony's antics. Poor Steve, sexy time ensues!
Wide blue eyes quickly followed Tony’s line of sight where Bucky was sleeping, noting the threat. Steve knit his brows in anger, his jaw clenched tight as he twisted to get a good look at his assailant’s face. A low growl escaped Steve’s throat.
‘Like hell I do,' Tony scoffed, his voice hoarse, while he glared daggers at the looming presence above him. ‘There's no stopping me, Rogers...'
‘Enough!’ Steve pleaded, his tone raised in alarm, his balled fist shadowing over Stark’s crunched face.
‘Don’t what? You want this… you filthy little shit…’ His words were as heavy as his thrusts. Steve arched his back when his prostate was hit once more. Stark’s cock was opening him up, squelching sounds filling the air.
‘What’s wrong with my bag? And what happened to your hair?’ Steve probed, defensive at first, but then noticing that the billionaire playboy had done…. something…to his hair.
Tony had had enough of hearing the traitor’s voice fill his ears with lies once again. It was time to show the Captain the world of hurt he had promised. He removed his fingers haphazardly, leaving Steve’s gaping hole slightly open. Steve’s chest heaved in surprise, his body feeling empty.
The dark-haired man reeled back, his feet buckled under the force. The wall shook when it connected with Stark's lean, muscled back, antiquated picture frames falling next to him as  glass shards exploded upon impact. Tony nursed his battered, bleeding face with shaky fingers, feeling the damage.
‘You must see how absurd this is. We can’t even be in the same room together before we start yelling at each other. I’m not even sure he likes me, and I can’t even blame him for that.’
Also, Steve was a liar. Stark was far from stupid, he'd known how Steve had enjoyed and came from his dick.
This shouldn’t be rushed. It hadn’t been long since the last time the billionaire had penetrated him, so he was surprised by the tightness. This was even better, and Tony had to admit that seeing Steve’s twisted, pained features were an added bonus.
‘I don’t know why you should cum…This ain’t about you. It’s all about me and getting you under me for once, doing what I say!’
The fair skinned man couldn’t believe his ears. He had agreed to any perverted acts he might have to do, but this was beyond punishment; this was pure humiliation.
Well, he observed Tony flirting with Steve on several occasions, without any sort of response from the older man.
‘Eyes on the wall,’ harshly ordered Iron Man. He didn’t know why, but in this instance, Tony couldn’t stand the soldier’s pitiful look. He didn’t deserve to look at him like that, not after everything that had happened.
Secondly, I wanted to say sorry for the time it took me to update. I hope you still like the story and curious about what will happen next. Hopefully, I do not disappoint and this leaves you with a bit of introspection on the characters.
It’s not that Steve hated Tony. Actually, he found the man could step up when he was needed. He just had a problem obeying Steve’s command and that could be costly on the battlefield. That left the two spies, however, if one enhanced human couldn’t do anything, the Captain wasn’t sure how their skills would fare if taken by surprise. They had no idea what they'd find on the inside.
‘Ladies…’ Maria Hill’s strong voice resonated through the walls, cutting their petty argument short to everyone’s disappointment.
‘I-I’m not a-’ Steve attempted to dislodge the offending hand, only to be rebuked by Stark’s other hand pinning him by his neck, the pressure cutting off his breath against his headrest.
‘You don’t know anything, Buck. You can’t understand… There’s nothing you can do, alright?’ Those last words fell through his lips like a soft plea to leave things be.
Tony’s chest was so close that he could feel his thumping heartbeat through his rib cage; their heartbeats out of sync. One palpitating in excitement while the other beat in unbearable embarrassment.
‘Hmmm, you aren’t a very good boy, Rogers. I think I might have to punish you!’ Steve gasped, a sudden flash of red painting his exposed chest and nipples.
A loud clap brought the Captain’s eyes back to Tony’s, out of his reverie. Tony clasped his hands in front of himself and judging by the forming bulge he sported down his trousers, Steve had an inkling of what was going to happen.
Steve gasped, his breath short and ragged. His lungs were out of air, he was heaving heavily, taking in every puff he could. His eyes were watery with tears filling them. His burning cheeks were wet from a few tears leaking, the pressure too much to take.
It seemed everyone was aware of this… complicated situation with Rogers. All except for the man himself.
The Super Soldier wondered who’d have the qualifications for the job. Hulk would be a flight risk. As for himself, he was obviously out. Steve couldn’t lie to save his life.
He hated himself for falling prey to Tony’s dark, meticulous scheme. He took pride in his iron clad control, but now it failed him.  A slave to his biological urges, he wanted to puke for being so weak.
‘SHIELD has how much money…and these are the best fake identities you could give us?” Tony asked with a perplexed look on his face as he quickly flipped through the pages.
Tony allowed himself to shut his eyes, basking in these newly felt sensations. Tony had experience with men and women alike, but no ass had felt this divine. He had to stop himself before he’d find himself cumming already. His dick quivered, waiting for what was to be his. Steve’s body acquiesced to his length.
‘No, god no…I-Just…I don’t-’ he sputtered out, in an undignified manner. His body was shaking violently, sweat gleaming in the faint rays of Tony’s reactor.
Something ate at him, though. As the Captain, he had to appear confident, but this mission made him squeamish. He would never tell Tony this, but he counted on his partner to know how to handle things.  It killed him to admit that Tony held the destiny of this mission in his hands.
‘Come on… Say it…You fucking like this!’ The sensations were so much for Steve, he was overwhelmed on all fronts. Tony’s attention, although unrequited, was making his body tremble, his shoulders tense and his dick pulse. His ass was sensitive, his cheeks swollen and red from the hand holding him in place. He rocked back, seeking more.
Steve’s body tensed at the thought, questioning his body’s intentions. As soon as the words passed through those smirking lips, Steve’s hands timidly moved in front of his perky nipples and his well defined abs to afford some protection.
The bruises weren’t wholly visible, but Bucky had seen the oddly shaped marks protruding from the Captain’s exposed skin, as if Steve had been subdued.
Steve and Tony pack up and get ready for their mission, unware of Fury's true intentions behind their pairing up. Someone talks some sense into Steve and Stark can't help being all over the place. Obviously, they can't keep their mouth from insulting each other whenever they can. Or perhaps they are just flirting with each other...
Steve’s jaw nearly hit the floor.  Here came Tony Stark in all his beach bum, retiree, mid life crisis glory.
‘Steve…this is my last warning,’ replied Tony. ‘You’ll call me as I’ve asked or this deal is over. Understand?... That’s an order,
After what felt like an eternity in heaven, Tony Stark finally picked up the pace and started bucking his hips forward.  He fucked Steve in earnest, his fingers finding hold of the meat on Steve’s stagnant hips.
Tony screamed at the phantom of the recently departed Rogers, his smile incredulous, as once again, like many times before in his life, he was all alone, drifting dangerously closer, veritably tip toeing the line of insanity.
Steve cycled through his old worn out clothes and put them on until a knock on the door reeled him in.
With a harsh shove, Steve freed himself and scurried for the bathroom door, leaving but an inch to peer through to finally lock his pained, yet resilient gaze with Bucky’s fiery one.
‘Fucking you isn’t enough for what you did to me!? Why?!’ Tony bellowed as he gripped Steve’s sweat drenched locks.
It made things so much simpler to believe it could have worked between them…He could believe…. Steve could at least…
He renewed his pleas, while his flesh remained posed. He had promised Tony anything, and he would go through with it, but he was afraid of the lasting damage. He couldn’t do anything if he ended up dead.
He could heal fast, but this type of injury he couldn’t afford. His friends needed him sharp to help them, so he allowed himself to relax, feeling his muscles relent a little.
‘Ah…I’m….I can’t….I’m…fuck… I don’t even….w-want…Jesus…Don’t make me…please, don’t….’ babbled Steve incoherently, half of his sentence muffled by the unforgiving hand at his throat. It brought an evil curl to Stark’s lips.
He removed his wet thumb replacing it with two long fingers. The squelching sounds of saliva coated fingers pounding relentlessly now against the walls of his insides made it so lewd that Steve’s skin glowed pink. The harshness made Steve’s knees buckle, angling those fingers in deeper, brushing against a bundle of nerves that sent his head spinning. His throat let out a raspy moan that made Stark smirk widely.
'I do have to admit that those pictures from our first time together....hmmmm. fucking hot. With you blowing me like a damn whore…I swear, gets me hard all the damn time. I'm sure Ross would love them, maybe even give yo-'
‘I have my ways,’ Tony answered breathlessly, his hand now at Steve’s chiseled jaw, his thumb trailing on Steve’s Adam’s apple seductively.
‘But...hummm, if you're asking if I’m a virgin...then, I’m not. I-I laid with a few dames back in the day and had a couple of...uh...handjobs with some fellas in my time. After the serum, of course, I wasn’t much to look at before anyways...’
'No,' Steve said defiantly as he took calculating steps forward, his march decisive and threatening. 'I don’t ever want to see your face near Bucky, our friends, or me again, you understand me?"
‘You can’t stand it, right? My fingers stretching you wide… How you open so good for me. You’re lucky I don’t want my dick chafed and I’m taking the time to prepare you, otherwise I’d have rammed it in already, fucking you into the wall until you begged me for forgiveness,’ Tony said, as he fingered the Captain with one hand while the other had searched for the back of his subordinate’s flushed neck, squeezing hard, leaving hand prints on the porcelain skin.
Well, hope you guys had fun! Next part, Steve's inner demons and coming to terms with how he reacted to Tony. Also, a look into Bucky's perspective, did he hear anything? Does he remember? Will he suspect anything? Stay tuned!
‘Jesus, Buck, you know we have to stick together, you can’t ... what if he....’ Steve’s mouth clamped shut.
‘Where do you think you’re going? Leaving again, you coward?’ yelled Tony at the top of his lungs. There was a glint in his eyes, like he was hurt once again. He only had himself to blame.
Sorry for being so late, I was very sick and had a hard time making the time. Also, writer's block! But hey, here's another chapter to quench your thirst!
Steve thrashed his head to the side, forcing Tony to readjust his grip. The nerve of this man. Steve was livid.
Steve wasn’t sure if he was impressed by Stark’s forwardness or put off by him calling his clothing choices less than adequate. He loved his clothes.
Bucky took a second to seize the room and flashed him a comforting smile still, while his eyebrow arched, wondering about the sudden hostility.
Steve let himself be guided by this stream of consciousness, his mind conjuring scenarios in which neither of them had lied to each other. One where both were honest and had opened up about their feelings. If only Tony hadn’t resented him for his father’s shortcomings and his inability to feel worthy…
Tony didn’t miss the impatient taps coming from Steve Rogers’ long fingers as he pushed the door open and he announced himself in true Tony Stark fashion.
Tony’s face fell at the news. He’d never battled without his armor. He didn’t know how to feel about that. His sight settled on Steve who studied him like a book. Steve’s expression was blank, yet he could see the wheels turning in that head of his.
‘Do your worst...’ Lifting his head to meet the face of his tormentor, the super soldier paused for momentum. When he knew he held the other’s attention, he clenched his teeth through a vicious smirk and growled lowly,
‘We’re supposed to be on vacation, Rogers… What exactly do you have in there? … Two pairs of boxers and a tooth brush?’ Tony chided with a toothy grin.
‘Seriously, Cap, why are you so against this? I thought you liked showing everyone how it’s done,’ Tony retorted, crowding into the soldier’s space. There was such a huge gap in height between them, he noticed.
‘Why do I feel there’s a but coming…’ Natasha asked. Maria’s eyes fluttered close and forced a light smile, gripping her pad firmly in her grasp. This was the part she dreaded.
Maria shook her head subtly, ‘Too much collateral damage. Also, they might be onto us, destroy any evidence and leave. This is HYDRA we’re talking about, we need to move forward cautiously. If we can figure out what’s going on at this location, maybe we can gather more information as to why people keep dropping off the grid without a trace.’
His vision was fuzzy with white spots appearing, he was choking for air and none was coming. His face was turning red, his lips losing all of their warmth, tainting them blue like ice. He searched for Tony’s gaze. He couldn’t die here.
‘Ahhhh..’  Steve’s raspy voice replied, his throat dry. He felt himself starting to fill, all his blood rushing down south.
‘This isn’t a vacation people; you need to get your shit together.’ Nick Fury retorted. ‘You,’ he said looking at Steve with his good eye, ‘I expected better of you. You’re the damn Captain of this team, and I expect you to know better and to do what you’re told. I don’t give a shit about what you motherfuckers want. There’s a reason why you’re both on this mission and you’ve gotta trust me to know what I’m doing. You do the mission, get the intel and get the fuck out. Are we gonna have a problem here, Captain?’
