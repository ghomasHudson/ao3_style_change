“Something like that,” Steve said with a deprecating laugh.
At some point in the middle of it all, Steve got out his sketchbook and started to work on the piece inspired by Metropolis.  He’d been struggling with it for what seemed like ages, but now, the lines and swirls came easily into definition.  Tony talked, and Steve drew Maria, the robot creation they burned when they lost control. He didn’t quite remember what she looked like.  She was one of the before-memories, slightly muddled and waxy in his mind.  In the middle of it, as he sketched her slanted eyes glowing fire and listened to Tony talk about his robots--listened to him be
“We are both of us quick to grant each other an absolution we cannot seem to grant to ourselves,” Tony observed, then fell quiet for a long moment, eyes fixed, staring at nothing.  “You would see the best of me, and I can’t even bring myself to correct you. Not really. I want it far too much, selfish bastard that I am. That night,” Tony began again, then stopped himself and took a deep breath, turning to look at Steve with an unwavering gaze. “You don’t know—you don’t know what I’m capable of. When it comes to you, anyway. That night… I thought you would be better off away from me. I still think that might be true. I see it. Every day, I see
“I’ll…have that,” Steve told the waiter.
Anto learned this was a smile, though it, too, had other names sometimes, and it meant that you were happy about something, and the opposite was a frown, which meant you were sad or upset or angry.  When Anto tried to make the faces Steve made, the noise Steve made was a laugh. Anto laughed too, as much as he could. He wasn’t sure when he would be able to laugh again, and it was the most wonderful feeling, except the times when Steve laughed with him, which were better somehow.
“I’ve kept you from your drawing long enough. My apologies,” Tony said, slapping his hands against his thighs, then standing up.  “That’s Barnes, isn’t it? I haven’t seen you draw him in a while. It...pleases me to see it. He looks happy there,” he added, nodding down at the sketch.  Steve blinked up at him, caught off-guard by the sudden change in conversation, then looked down at the sketch in his lap.
He could barely pick out the top of Tony’s head from his position in the carriage, but as soon as the Castle gates opened, it was clear where he was.  A throng of people a dozen deep waited outside, letting out an uproarious cheer as Tony emerged, a hand in the air with a practiced wave.  Flowers cascaded through the air in rainbow arcs and dotted the stone path where the horses trotted and guards walked, three abreast, as they made their way through the street lined with more guards acting as a bulwark against the excited crowd.  They love him, Steve thought, though it was no surprise.  Peace, prosperity and a handsome King to rule over it with an easy hand, what was there not to love?
That was the thing. Everyone had someone. Maybe you didn’t find that person, but they were out there. No matter who you were or what you did, there was someone who would love you.   Sure, it didn’t mean eternal bliss, even if you found that person. Real life wasn’t a fucking storybook, and bad things happened to good people, and people were still selfish and cruel. Finding your soulmate wasn’t a cure for the human condition.
After New York and the Mandarin and Bucky…somewhere in there, Steve had learned to tell when Tony was teasing him good-naturedly, which was most of the time, it turned out, and when Tony was actually being unkind, which was surprisingly rare.  And God forbid anyone else tease Steve or make any ‘Man out of Time’ references.  At first, Steve had assumed Tony was just annoyed he hadn’t been the one to think of it when a reporter or whomever would make some crack about Steve’s presumed lack of knowledge about twenty-first century pop culture, but he’d long ago realized that Tony was actually rather endearingly protective when it came to the Avengers.
Steve ran a thumb up and down over the ridges of the bottle and across the plastic label.  It was the same kind they had at the facility, in one of those big jugs on top of the dispenser with the cone-shaped paper cups next to it.  Cone-shaped, so you couldn’t set it down somewhere.   Wouldn’t want to get rings on the tabletop or leave the place looking a mess, he supposed.   Had to keep up appearances.
Since he didn’t really have much of a choice, he followed Coulson back to the elevator, which took them down two floors to what served as the Medical wing for the base, cheerily decorated in post-apocalypse dystopian-edition chrome and the utilitarian line of beige, lighter beige and this-won’t-show-barf-beige.  Charming.
, and nearly forgot how to get his tongue to form words. He coughed his first attempt at speech into his fist and tried to regroup.
“When he left, I had to let him go,” Nasha said, her voice holding an echo of sadness. “He wanted to make a Journey. I could not have stopped him even if I wanted to, and I didn’t. It was who he was. But, having you back, you have brought him with you, Steve. He is home now. For that, I thank you.”
“I've...heard something about that,” Steve replied, because he had heard of Edwin Jarvis, though not the way Tony likely suspected.  The man’s name came up several times in the files on Peggy Carter, then Peggy Carter Sousa, who was now patient P. Carter at the Arlington Memory Care facility, who sometimes asked for Steve like he had never been away.  He could feel his hands curling into fists, the knuckles whitening around the rod, and forced himself to breathe out through his nose and relax his body.  Count backwards, his therapist had once suggested, and Steve had laughed out loud at that until he thought he might have been crying, and she suggested a tranquilizer instead and then suggested Tony.
“Right behind you,” Natasha said, scooting her chair back and grabbing her plate as she followed Clint out of the room, but not before giving Tony a quick nod and smile on her way out. Steve was still eating with quiet efficiency, eyes focused on his plate, shoulders hunched inward as if he could somehow make himself less noticeable that way.
“No,” Steve replied.  “No, it isn’t.  I wish that were it, Tony.  I really do. Cam was not my assistant, or anyone’s assistant.  That night you met him, when you called him from Lord Stane’s party to help with your machine,” Steve said, voice faltering a bit as he went.  He did not want to be the one to do this to Tony, to tear that blindfold away from his eyes when he knew the bright light of truth would only bring pain.  And what would it do to whatever it was between them?  Was it not the one who tells the unwelcome news who bore the stain of it forever?  He shook his head.  There was nothing for it.  Tony had to know.  Maybe Steve had to know, too.  How Tony would react.
Tony twisted around and rolled over into the warm hardness of Steve’s chest.  He laid his head over where the scar would have been, if Steve did normal things like scar and listened to the muted thwump-thwump of Steve’s heartbeat echo in his ear.  He tucked his hands up between them and grasped the dog tags in his fist, closing his eyes as he held them and let Steve hold him.  Maybe not so separate, he thought blearily, opening his eyes and looking up at Steve.  Steve’s face was curved into that soft, gentle look he got sometimes when he looked at Tony, his eyes crinkling at the corners.  Steve ran a hand over Tony’s hair, smoothing it back where sweat had left it in curly clumps against Tony’s forehead.
“Perhaps.  In some cases, perhaps.  But, not, I dare say, to Captain Rogers.  If anyone would understand about having your life dictated by your body’s limitations, it would be Captain Rogers,” Dr. Reese remarked, which made no sense.  Tony wasn’t blind.  That body had zero limitations, except perhaps finding shirts that fit.  “Here.  Take this.  When you get low, let Agent Coulson know, and I’ll send more along,” Dr. Reese said, holding the bottle out towards Tony.  It hung there between them for a long moment before Tony reached up and picked it out of the doctor’s grasp, pocketing it without a word.  “Good.  Agent Coulson will see about the rest of the things you might need.  If you have any questions—about anything at all—my number is on the bottle.”
“Responsible and fair,” Steve corrected.
“I could just tell her I really, really like press conferences,” Tony suggested, crossing his hands over the pillow that covered his lap. Steve covered his mouth with his hand to hide his smile, though Tony just shot him a disgruntled look and swatted at his shoulder.  “Your fault,” he mouthed at Steve.
“You’re saying Mountain Dew is like those weird Swedish symbols that change the meaning of words from, I don’t know, bear to nuclear waste, and I think that’s a gross misrepresentation of the power of the Dew,” Sam protested, waving his beer bottle in Rhodey’s general direction.
“I am,” Steve said firmly.
Then Tony was leaving, barreling past Steve with hunched shoulders and his eyes on his boots as they ticked off the steps to the door.
“Anything else we need to talk about?” Tony asked lightly, grinning lasciviously as he started to press small, grinding bites along Steve’s hipbone, laving each one with his tongue when he was done.
“In my defense, it was a prototype, and was used one time about ten minutes ago.  You know,
“Fine,” Steve interrupted, cutting off what probably would’ve been a truly epic tirade. Tony could only imagine what was going through the poor guy’s head, but if it got him to agree, all’s well that ends well. “I’ll do it. But what about the license? They’re going to want to see that.”
Not being total idiots, apparently, the two of them scrambled towards the door, dragging Rollins up with them and half-carrying him outside.  Steve glanced up at where Brock was lying in a heap, his head lolled to one side.  He let out a pain-filled moan, blinked down at them, then closed his eyes and promptly passed out.
“Shhh, don’t tell them,” Tony admonished lightly, tugging the corner of his lip between his teeth.
“Huh?  Oh, no.  Thank you,” Steve said, glancing down at the envelope in his hand.  “Wait.  Um.  Tony, ah…”
At that, Tony grinned, “Hi, yourself.”  Tony stopped for a moment and seemed to be taking him in, looking him up and down in that way that he had of focusing so intently on Steve that it managed to make him both incredibly self-conscious and a little turned on.  More than a little.
.  Maybe that was a lot more universal than Steve could have ever realized.  Shellhead stared at him a beat longer, then dropped his eyes and turned, slipping off into the sea.
“Are you sure you are not unwell?” Cam asked again, tipping his head to the side as he pulled away from the window and regarded Steve with sudden interest.  “You are very pale, Raj’Inama.  You should eat something. It will make you feel better, you will see,” he added, reaching for the larder chest.
It was nearly two weeks after the semester ended when Steve saw the email.  He didn’t recognize the sender and almost deleted it until he saw the subject line.
“No,” Steve cut her off sharply. “No, it’s fine. It’s…ah, I can’t say exactly, but, um, I might be here a couple of days,” Steve explained. Or tried to. Mr. Murdock had been very specific about what to say and what not to say, after Steve had argued that there was no way his friends would believe that he and Stark had actually gotten married out of some kind of love at first sight thing. This whole plan was paper thin to begin with, but they only needed to buy a few days, or so Stark said. Wouldn’t do for Steve’s friends to start talking to the press about how something was off about the situation and expose the whole charade for what it was.
“Um. So,” Steve began, then immediately faltered under Tony’s scrutiny.  It wasn’t like he was any good at this in a normal situation, let alone...whatever this was. Not normal, that was for sure.
That was the thing that was off, Tony realized with a start, watching as Howard looked at Steve with a searching, numb expression.  For the first time in God only knew how long, Tony wasn’t the one struggling to figure out what the right thing to say, the right expression to hold, the right way deal with events that were out of his control.
“Don’t do it, Tones.  I’m telling you, this isn’t your issue,” Rhodey reminded him, tapping his fingers on the steering wheel for emphasis, though he mostly just sounded tired and wrung out.
“Your little whore just bends over for you so his vegetable of a mother can get clean sheets and a bath a day,” Stane said lowly, leaning in to Tony’s space, sharing the secret he’d been hoarding until the worst possible moment.
“Great—that’s…hang on, I’ll just—let me give Happy the head’s up so he can meet us downstairs.  You need to stop anywhere on the way?” Tony asked.  Steve shook his head as Tony tapped a quick text to Happy.  “He’s in the garage. Did you know there’s a chauffeur’s lounge?  He’s excited because they have free peanuts.  There are…I literally have texts that are just part of his forehead and a bowl of peanuts,” Tony said, shaking his head with a smile.  “Should have the car pulled up by the time we get down there.”
“Yeah… yeah, I’m good, Buck,” Steve assured him.  He couldn’t resist a quick glance at Tony.
“Why not?” Tony answered, taking the bottle of water out of Rogers’ hand and pulling the chair he’d been gripping like a lifeline out from the table.  After a beat, Rogers sat down next to him, though he pulled the chair back far enough to give Tony some extra space.  “So,” Tony said when the silence stretched out too long for comfort.
He couldn’t let that happen. Desperation welled up inside him.  He ran forward, ignoring Steve’s shout, and dropped to his knees in front of Tyber.  Head bowed, he waited, breath coming in pants. He could hear them shuffling about, and could almost feel Steve’s eyes on him, boring into his back, though he hadn’t come any closer, thankfully.  Finally, Anto felt the familiar tap on his shoulder.
“Bring the car around,” Tony told him.  “Steve needs to get to work.  We overslept, and—“
“Well, good thing other people telling you what to do always goes so well,” Steve intoned evenly, eyebrows raised.
It went on like that until they reached the bottom of the stairs, where Lord Rand waited next to his son and some of the other visiting nobles.  At least Cam’s chatter provided a welcome distraction from the way the gold chains shifted over his body as they walked down the steps, Steve thought with a grimace. There were a number of new faces, Steve noticed, who must have arrived just for the tourney.  Their party followed Lord Rand and his son to the large box in front of the tourney field where a high-backed wooden chair with a cushioned seat and crest mounted above it waited for Tony. Next to it, a tufted ottoman was clearly meant for Steve, so after Tony and the Lords Rand sat, he sank down onto it and spread his robes around him.
The alien made some kind of noise, high-pitched, chittering, and sonorous at the same time, like if you combined a whale song, a bird, and a dolphin and maybe threw in some electro-dance beat.  Tony winced at it, frowning, and it hummed at him, soft and low and...soothing? Yeah, soothing, Tony decided. Tony found himself missing the contact of the alien’s hands, though the feeling of being at ease lingered, warming him, making him feel languid and weightless, the way he did when he was flying.  He had a distant thought that it was odd, this feeling, but it was so good, so easy to just fall into, he couldn’t seem to latch on to the question.
“Does everyone get to look at my service record now?” Steve asked with an edge of exasperation.
This man would stand out anywhere he went, and surely, if he was from around here, Steve would know of him.  He would be all people would talk about, even more than Mister Beatty, who owned the mill and had three wives into the grave and had now taken up with the widow Martin, and Steve was supposed to close his ears at that point, but he knew it was shameful and the Lord was probably going to put a pox on him and make his manparts shrivel up and fall off, which sounded to Steve like a hugely unfair punishment just for living with someone when you weren’t married.
“I thought I was leaving home,” Steve replied.  “I didn’t know I was going to it this whole time.”
“I can’t believe I’m doing this,” he said again, though it all felt oddly right.  Settling--no, comforting--in a way that Tony couldn’t quite capture in his mind. Just a feeling.  Some deep understanding. The whammy. That was probably it, he thought hazily, but a part of him wasn’t sure.  He just
Tony stared at the phone for a second, then shook his head.  Damn it, Rhodey.  Now, I’ve got something in my eye, he thought, a strange, light feeling running through him that he thought might be joy.
The Internet wasn’t offering much help in ideas for things Tony might like, so Steve thought through the things that had been in Tony’s room when he...well, when he snooped, he remembered with a stab of guilt.  He shouldn’t have invaded Tony’s privacy like that, though, all in all, recon on his Omega’s room seemed like the least of his offenses, all things considered.   If he was honest with himself, he knew what Tony liked the most, and that was being left alone and having nothing to do with Steve.  Apparently, anyway, he thought somewhat bitterly before he pushed the thought aside.  It wasn’t like any of this was Tony’s fault. He had agreed, true, but Steve was fairly certain he had just somehow managed to rise to the top of some list of bad alternatives in Tony’s mind.  He was also fairly certain that Tony wasn’t entirely wrong in his assessment.  Not that it mattered now. Tony was his, and he was Tony’s, even if Tony didn’t want him.  He could still be Tony’s in his head.
Steve ground his jaw in frustration and let out a huff of air.  He was silent for a long moment, watching as Tony looked out the window at the passing walls of rock, his eyes unseeing.
But, it wasn’t like he’d thought about it.
“It’s a public place,” Stark shrugged.  “Free country, all that.”
“Tony, are you okay?” Rhodey called out.  “What the hell happened here?”
Stone took another pull of his cigarette, dropped it to the ground and crushed the tip under his shoe.  As he did so, Tony felt the man’s groin brush against his hip.  It was the kind of thing that was supposed to be accidental.  Tony knew that.  He wasn’t sure how he knew that, but the rule was, it was an accident, and he was supposed to ignore it.  Except, it wasn’t an accident, and they both knew it, and this was some game they were playing, but Alphas had made up the rules, and the rule was:  It was an accident. Ignore it or…or something.  Something bad, Tony’s mind shuttered, closing in on itself.
“Right. Uh-huh,” Rhodey replied, one hand going to rub at his chin. “I can tell how fine it went.”
He’d told Tony about his inexperience with the idea that he could manage expectations. For, like, that night.  But Tony…Tony Stark…of all people, had apparently decided to treat Steve like some Victorian maiden and court him.  Which was romantic as hell.  And sweet.  And probably great for their relationship.  It wasn’t doing much for the punching bags in the gym though.  Had kind of been hell on them.  When he’d destroyed the eighth one, Tony had come down to the gym, stared at it for a long moment and raised an eyebrow at Steve.  Steve had thought finally, finally, that was going to be it and found himself scanning around the gym for a relatively soft surface when Tony had asked him if he wanted Mexican or Thai for dinner.  Clint shouted from the rafters that he thought Steve probably wanted a little Italian, earning a glare from Steve and ending up with Tony ordering enough pasta for an army.
. He is a vile, abhorrent man who would have been rotting in a prison cell had he not bribed the magistrate years ago when I first heard reports of his cruelties.  Or had I followed up, as I should have, but I trusted it to be done, and—well.  That is—that is neither here nor there for now,” Tony stopped, rolled his lips together, closed his eyes and let out a puff of air.  “Do you remember that night when I had you touch yourself?  After you’d left me, all alone in my bed with only my impure thoughts of you to sustain me?” Tony asked.
“That what this is now?  Validating my feelings?  Should I get my dream journal and some tea?” Steve scoffed bitterly, definitely not slowing down.
“I guess I could do that.  If you think Howard and Obie’ll go for it,” Tony said finally.
“You’re, you know.  ‘Murica and all that,” Tony offered, as if that explained anything.
“Turn around,” one of the robed men said to Steve as soon as the shackles fell from his hands and legs. “Face the table.” Steve turned.   “Bend.” Steve bent forward until he felt the cold stone of the table against his chest.  “Good,” the man said, then spread Steve apart and thrust two oiled fingers inside.  Steve let out a sharp grunt, hips jerking.  He let out a hiss of breath and told himself not to move.  The man worked him open, stretching and pulling at his hole.  A third finger, and the burning pressure worsened.  Steve bit his lip.  Tasted blood.  “Give me the….yes, thank you,” the man said from behind him.
He was about to argue more with Ms. Romanov when she cut in, “In fact, Stark didn’t care about anything to do with the money, not the exorbitant amount I quoted him or anything else. The one thing he did care about…was, in fact, quite insistent about to say the least, was that I was not, under any circumstances, to send you to Hammer.”
“Thanks, Brucie-bear. He turns into a giant green rage monster, by the way, so we’re probably going to need to kick him off the team, just to be on the safe side,” Tony told Steve in his best conspiratorial whisper.
“Ah, you always did. Don't apologize,” Steve replied with a shrug. “Get you going on something and you'd talk yourself into fixing whatever it was. Used to love to listen to you. Figured, if you could make someone like me understand, you could probably sell the idea to anyone. Like that...what was it you called it? Smart landmine?”
“That bad, huh?  It sounded bad when I said it,” Steve admitted, then grinned, earning a rueful, hard-won grimace of a smile from Kirk.
“Very nice,” Tony said admiringly.  “You’re incredibly talented, you know? Better than many at the Academies, I would think. Don’t look at me like that, I can be objective.   Your tutor thinks you quite gifted, as well.”
He had this. He totally had this.
“I once allowed my own pain and rage to overcome reason, compassion, my commitment to justice, the very things that my father embodied, and nearly took the life of an innocent man because of it.  Something all the good works of a lifetime could not have undone,” T’Challa replied evenly.  “Agent Carter helped prevent that from happening.  I owe her a debt,” he continued with a slight tilt of his head.  “As I do you, Captain.
“Truly.  Traders bring it over land all the way to Etta, and then it sails here, along with spices, cloths, and other diversions we can’t make ourselves.  Speaking of luxuries, I heard you visited the baths at Zola’s,” Tony remarked, seemingly nonchalantly, making Steve start with surprise.  “Did you enjoy yourself?”
“Too many,” Peggy said, a weary sadness in her voice that Steve knew from experience was the thing you didn’t want to call acceptance.
The thought that it was no place that Steve belonged flitted across his mind before he could stop it.
you is okay,” Steve said, throat bobbing around the words.  “One of them, he helped you.  Saved you.  When I couldn’t.  How can I sit here and tell you not to try to do the same for them if you can?”
“Mechanical Engineering.  Physics.  Electrical Engineering. For the moment,” Kirk told him.
“You’ll come back, right?” Tony asked, almost reaching out as Jarvis started for the lowly rumbling car where Happy waited behind the wheel.
“Your Highness,” Steve said, bowing his head.  Cam jumped up and pumped his fist in the air with a loud, exhilarated whoop, then started clapping enthusiastically, though he slowed and looked around, somewhat awkwardly, when he realized the rest of the room had gone silent.
His mind filled with images, one after the other, like a endless ticker tape of them. Tony, curled up against him. Tony, smiling up at him, soft and sleepy-eyed. Tony, with his head thrown back, face a rictus of ecstasy.
Really should’ve gone with Hallmark for that, mom.
“He’s good, Tony,” Rhodes said lowly, one hand cupping his chin.  A frown marred his face, though to Steve it looked more like confusion than concern for Tony.  “Real good.”
“Night, Cap,” Happy shouted.  “Good to see him back up here,” Happy said with a small nod in Tony’s direction. “Hasn’t been right, you two bein’ apart so much.  Haven’t seen him lookin’ so down since I first drove him up here with that Coulson fella acting like he just stepped off the boat, you know?  Here’s how you order food, here’s how you pay for things, here’s Wikipedia, but don’t trust it,” Happy recalled with a shake of his head while Tony shot him a confused frown.  “I know, right?  Damnedest thing!”
He’d meant to add a few more slides to the presentation and head back to his own apartment.  That was the last thing he remembered.  Getting up and gently leaning Steve over onto the bed’s flat pillow and pulling the faded quilt over his legs.  Turning out the light and scrolling through the slideshow one more time.  He should have left then, but there was something familiarly calming about working next to Steve like that.  Shitty apartment, check.  Radiator that barely functioned, check.  Steve’s soft, comforting snores punctuating the night while Tony powered through whatever project had his attention, check.  Except, he wasn’t nineteen anymore, as his back reminded him with a pang.
Tony hesitated, holding the cloth just above the fire.  “Life is unpredictable,” he said, without looking at Steve. “Perhaps.  Perhaps, we will meet again.  When you are an old man, alone in  your bed,” he continued, glancing over at Steve with a small, sad smile, “if you should discover a traveller at your door on that last, long night, invite him in.”
Tony studied him for a moment, one eyebrow raised in question.
“That’s actually sort of what I’m here to talk to you about,” Coulson continued.
Bucky and Nat could do with some help, too, though he figured they were too proud to take it.  And Bucky’s parents...Steve still owed them so much for how much they helped after his mom died, not that they would ever suggest there was any kind of debt to be repaid there.  With that kind of money, he could pay off their mortgage. Maybe even send them on that trip to Florida that Mrs. Buchanan had been talking about for years.  He could help Wanda get her brother’s Visa.  Send something nice to Clint and Laura when the baby was born instead of another stupid painting for the nursery, though he appreciated they always hung up the ones he sent the kids, even if they weren’t that good. Of course, if any of them knew how he got the money…
He followed Fury to the elevator, watching him surreptitiously as Fury’s voice authorization for the isolation floor was accepted. When they reached their destination, the doors slid open into a rather sterile looking environment, a large room with a few seats and a window that offered a view into a similar room on the other side.  Fury went to stand by the glass, peering inside, then nodded, as if satisfied and stepped back.
His words, his thoughts, his feelings, these were the only weapons left to him at the moment, and Steve knew that he had wielded them to hurt Tony. Because he was angry, because he wanted Tony to taste a little of the powerlessness that crawled over him like a second skin, burrowed down into him until giving up seemed like a choice he wanted to make instead of something that only happened when there was no choice at all.
“How?” Tony responded, shoving his hands in his pockets and curling  them into fists.
“James!  I didn’t know you were in town,” Pepper said, shooting Tony a disgruntled look as she got up to hug Rhodey warmly.  “It’s so good to see you!”
“Yeah, Tony,” Coulson repeated again.
“I am a selfish man,” Tony began, eyes hard on the wall where the fountain streamed water in a steady cascade.  A denial jumped to Steve’s lips, but he held his tongue and waited. “You are mine, now, and I can’t deny that I am glad of it, however it came to pass,” he said, voice tight. “I shouldn’t be.  I know it.  But, you are here, safe and free from want, and I—”
“Gloves,” Tony said, since it was the first thing that came to his mind that didn’t involve outright begging.
“It’s the pinpricks, the tingling when your foot hits the ground.  That’s what you are.  What this is,” Steve continued.  “A part of me wanted to tell you to just go away.  Leave.  Let me…let me go back to sleep.  Let everything be fine again.  I can handle fine.  But…last night and today…it’s the most awake I’ve felt in a long time.  And it hurts.  Not gonna lie, Tony.  It’s hard.  You talk all the time, and you want to solve every, single thing, and that’s…a lot of pressure.  And you…you care.  You care so much, and I—it’s like I’m hard-wired to want to make you happy.  You weren’t wrong. What you said on the stairs.”
Steve sighed and rubbed a hand up and down over his face, trying to get his mind to clear.  He let his head dip to his chest for a moment, watching his boot scuff a streak in the dirt that covered the wood floor, disrupted now by their movements, making the place look like one of those how-to dance instruction sheets with the little feet making the steps all over the page.
The rest of the letters were largely the same, at least until about three years in by the dates at the top, when the tone started to shift, the letters getting longer and longer, filled with everything Steve was seeing over there, the frustration slowly ebbing to anger, exhaustion and fear leaking out of the words like a gaping wound, until the last letter, which was two sentences long and said more than any of the others.
Steve swallowed, or tried to, and stood up, bumping a knee into his easel as he did, nearly knocking it over before he caught it.  Long limbs, a sculpted torso and narrow hips, hair a little too long on top over a perfectly trimmed goatee that held a smirk.  Dusky, dark pink nipples set against tan skin with a smattering of dark hairs circling them.  Steve sucked in a deep breath.  Kirk was all lean, sinewy muscle and angles on his arms and hips, and soft, round curves down his back and legs, with a deep divot in the center of his chest that Steve could already imagine shading the strands of muscles where they crossed over his ribs.  A thin trail of dark, curly hair edged down from his navel to his groin where his cock sat against his thigh, thick and longer than Steve would have thought…if he’d been thinking about it, which he hadn’t…had he?  No, he wasn’t—poses.  He was thinking about poses.  Steve swallowed thickly and made a pretense of fussing with his paints, though his hands suddenly felt too clumsy and big to do much of anything, let alone paint.  This was such a great idea, Steve thought with a sigh.  How did he get himself into this?
“I know,” Steve said.  He did know that, he realized.  Through everything, right until the end, Tony had only ever wanted to keep them all together.
Steve had no answer for that.  He looked back over at the bedside table where Anthony’s picture glowed with an eerie blue phosphorescent light from the digital clock.   He remembered hunting for plumes of light like that just off the coast of France, where German submarines sometimes disturbed the bioluminescent plankton and gave away their positions. He remembered giving the orders to send those men to a watery grave and wondering what it must be like for them as the water poured in.  How terrified they must have been to see it and not be able to do anything about it. Knowing that they were a few breaths away from their last. Tossing the pillow to the floor, Steve lay down flat on the bed and stared at the ceiling.
“You’re so beautiful, Tony,” Steve whispered, dotting kisses against his cheek, the bridge of his nose, even his chin.  “So damned beautiful.  I want to draw you.  Like this.  How you look for me.”
Tony worried about the company, about the new direction he wanted to take it in, and Steve may have absolutely zero knowledge of corporate transitions, but he knew about feeling responsible and having to make choices that were going to affect people who depended on you.  Which was exactly the kind of circular thinking that got back to Bucky’s point.  He was all his mom had, and he couldn’t forget that this thing with Tony was ultimately a transaction.  Tony wanted him, not his problems.  Sure, Tony would talk to him and laugh with him and argue over just about anything with him, which Steve swore sometimes was only for Tony to see if he could get a rise out of Steve, but at the end of the night, Tony wanted Steve in his bed.  That fact that Steve enjoyed being there was something he should probably be thankful for, but it seemed to just complicate matters all the more each time Ms. Romanov handed him that fat envelope of cash.
“I don’t deserve you. But,” Tony sighed, “I am a selfish bastard,” he finished after a moment, almost as if he were speaking to himself.  He sounded sad, and Steve didn’t like that, nor the words themselves.  They weren’t true.  Whatever…whatever this was between them, Steve knew they weren’t true.
“Agent Coulson isn’t mad?” Tony asked after a moment.
“Okay,” Tony agreed.  “I will. Take care of yourself.”
“But months, Pepper.  Months.  He thought---he thought that I don’t, but I would, I mean, I do—I…” Tony stammered.  She hadn’t seen Steve’s face.  She hadn’t seen that, and she hadn’t been the one to put that there.
“We all are,” Steve replied, a rough, choked sound that was almost broken, because it was true, and that was the hardest part.  When they made a mistake, innocent people paid the price.  You could talk yourself through good intentions all you wanted, but the job meant risk, and you weren’t the only one taking those risks.  What they were up against, it demanded that of everyone, whether they agreed to it or not, and he knew that, he did, but damn if it wasn’t hard to see it happen and know there could have been another way but they’d picked the wrong door.  “But Tony, you can’t shut me out because you don’t want the argument.  It’s just going to get harder, you and I both know that.  These choices…we have to make them impossible.  That’s the way they should be.  Wrong or right, we’ve got to earn them.  That’s the only way we’ll be able to look at ourselves when this is over.”
“Steve,” Tony said quickly. Steve looked over at him, holding up one hand in the universal signal to wait just a minute, but a sickening pit of realization had opened up in Tony’s stomach.
His whole body had gone taut.  He was pushing his teeth together, making his jaw ache.  But, that was somehow keeping him rooted to his seat instead of running off down the hall for his room.  Flight or faster flight, he thought, somewhat hysterically.  His throat was dry and sticky.   Should’ve stuck to Tesla.  Or the ‘bots.  Always had to push, didn’t he?  Couldn’t leave well enough alone.  He forced himself to swallow, and almost choked on the saliva when his throat wouldn’t cooperate fully.
Steve stared at him for a long moment, then swiped a hand over his mouth and looked away.
“Yes,” Steve replied.
Steve did laugh at that, though he brushed his hand over his mouth to cover it.
“Well, How--my dad, he thought it was kind of a dumb idea, which just kind of made Jarvis want to do it all the more, but since he couldn’t really go around my dad, we ended up down at this little pond at Will Rogers Park. You can’t actually fish there, not for real, but I was like five, so I didn’t know that, and Jarvis, he made me this fishing pole out of a broomstick and some string, and he hung a thing of bread on the end. All the fish came up and nibbled at it. I thought it was
Friday’s voice echoed in his head.
“Fine. But, you could have come to us, or even the Feds, but you didn’t. Thought you’d solve all this right on your own,” Fury sighed, spreading his arms wide to seemingly indicate the insanity of that plan.
After a few shallow breaths, Tony looked up.  There was a sad, knowing look on Steve’s face that was almost as bad as a blow.  Hurt.  In a different way, but it hurt, landing somewhere in the center of his chest with little pinpricks of shame pushing deep inside.
A tipping point was coming, Steve could feel it. Soon enough, they wouldn’t need Thanos to wipe out half the planet, because someone was going to decide that the only way to stop something terrible was a preemptive strike with something they deemed less terrible.
“I’m in a cab on my way over,” Pepper replied, sounding harried.  “I texted Deborah. She’s doing a Fifth Avenue brownstone, but she’s on her way, too.  And I had David pull some folks off the Tower job, so we’ve got people. He wants to know what the hell is open in Brooklyn all night that has drywall.  He has an architect friend who does small spaces.  Caught him at the end of a dinner date, so he’s on his way over, too.  We’ll take care of it.”
His eyes stung and he blinked back the wetness, wiping at them with the back of his hand.  Then he remembered that the man’s eyes leaked sometimes, too. At least he knew that wasn’t something wrong with him.  The Stranger had given him that much. He was a healer, and he had a task, and if that was all there was, then so be it.  He pushed his shoulders back a little and made his way up to the cave. The man stopped his attempts at walking and raised a hand in what Anto had come to recognize as a greeting.  Anto did the same. The man bared his teeth again, then his face turned a bright red. Anto rush over and put his palm on the man’s forehead, though he couldn’t feel any warmth. He cupped the man’s cheeks and felt just below his jaw, but there was no sign of illness.
“That is not what happened,” Steve said firmly.  “That is not what Zola meant. Tony, Zola is not who you think he is.”
“So, okay, yester—no, two days ago, Coulson—SHIELD Agent guy, very bland, can probably kill you with a paperclip—shows up and he has this letter,” Tony began, the words rushing out of him.  “It’s from MIT, and says that I’m accepted into this pilot program for Omegas, which is apparently created just for me because Steve called the President.  Of the United States.  About…so that I could go to college.”
He wasn't sure why it bothered him. Steve was perfectly capable of doing whatever the fuck he wanted, and if that currently involved being an emo-astronomer, it wasn't Tony's problem. At all.
“I didn't hear that,” Mitch said quickly.
“Tony,” Tony corrected him.  “I go by Tony.”
“It’s late, so I won’t get an A, but hopefully, a good enough grade to pass.  I guess then I’ll bring it back here.  I don’t know.  Goes to the Pile of Misfit Art Projects over there,” Steve said, jerking his head towards a row of canvases facing the wall.  “And you wish you got a gold star.  Math geek.”
“Billionaire, genius, playboy, philanthropist,” Steve reeled off quickly.
“I don’t know, Justin, I’m feeling really good about this.  All of it, Danny,” Tony said, pushing the entire pile of chips in front of him towards the center of the table.  Steve couldn’t calculate it, but it had to be upwards of fifty thousand dollars easily. “Come on, baby, hit me one more time,” he told the dealer, who gave him a dubious look.  Probably because there was a jack and a four already showing in front of Tony.
So, that happened.
Steve was, objectively, hot as hell, Tony acknowledged to himself as they drove away from Caesar’s.  So, yeah, Tony had gotten a little carried away back there, though that was mostly Hammer’s fault for being a giant douche.  Important to be clear about that, but still, no reason to go throwing fuel on the mushroom cloud just because he didn’t like how Hammer had looked at—because he didn’t like Hammer.   He was supposed to be playing this safe, after the fuck-up with Stern, if nothing else.  Publicly mauling the person playing nice with their little plot was probably not on Pepper and Matt’s to-do list for him.
Steve breathed out, watching the shadows play over the tent while he decided what he wanted to say. Bucky knew him far too well to simply let this lie. “I don’t want to fail at this,” Steve finally settled on.
“Ah, well…the, um…the Revengers?” Steve replied.  “It’s stupid, I know.”
“Some things…” Steve began slowly, still staring with the same blank expression at the screen where the Humane Society assured viewers that no animals were harmed in the production.  “Some things…some things are too powerful to be used, even for good.  Even by people with the best of intentions,” Steve said in a hard, low voice, like his jaw was forcing the words out one clipped syllable at a time.
“Okay,” Steve said after a moment. “I’ll stay.”
“Thank you,” the man said. He swept in past Steve and took off his coat, tossing it somewhat carelessly over the back of a chair where it dripped a small puddle onto Steve’s floor.
“The Tower has a lot of extra security features.  Not all of them obvious.  I can go through them with you.  Again, I mean,” Tony offered, trying not to sound overly excited at the idea of explaining everything again to an avidly-listening Steve who kept telling Tony how amazing everything was.  Sure, that was nice in a…life-affirming sort of way, fine, but he only listened to the recordings those few—ten—twenty--whatever, times.  “Besides, like you said, comes with the hero territory, and if they’re going to come at us, better we’re together, right?”
“Stark-Rogers,” Tony replied.  “But, in a general sense, yes.”
“Probably,” Tony acknowledged, giving Bruce a quick look.
“Howard—” Maria started.
“What, ah…what was it that they did to you? Do you know?” Tony asked. His eyes had finally adjusted enough to make out the now much smaller shape of Steve sitting in the corner of the cell, uniform rolled up on bunches around his arms and ankles.
“You’re not, though.  You wouldn’t say...dumb things like that,” Steve argued.
“Uh, so, I might have done something a little rash,” Tony began.
“Bruce got it in eighteen,” Tony argued.
Steve walked over to stand in front of Tony, his hands going to circle Tony’s waist, thumbs dipping below the waistband of Tony’s trousers to brush against the warm skin there.  Tony’s hands darted out, fluttering over Steve’s stomach, heat and pressure coiling and settling there only to seem to snake out to every part of him that Tony touched.  He was already half-hard, cock jerking forward like it was searching for Tony’s hand.
Many of the patrons turned out to be veterans, which didn’t surprise him, not exactly. He knew Steve well enough to know what would draw him here, and he knew the statistics.  But, it was different when someone stood in front of him, wearing fatigues and a cap bearing the name and insignia of their unit, talking easily with Steve about Army food or sleeping on the ground, joking about the size of their Waldorf latrine papers in comparison to the smaller British versions used by their counterparts.
“Hello,” Tony tried, voice cracking a bit as he pushed down on the talk button, then winced at the sound of his voice.  “Uh, anyone copy? Over.”  That sounded better.  Less amateur.  The radio hissed and crackled with static, and for just that flicker of time, that one, expectant moment, it held so much possibility.
It felt to Steve almost as if each word carried a small push behind it, so that it filled Steve’s mind with a scattering of thoughts and images. A sting of emptiness in his stomach.  The food, how good it looked, how nice it would be to have a full belly and dine on a meal such as this, which he almost never got, even when his mother had been alive, except maybe at the holidays, if they were lucky, which they almost never were. His last meal, potatoes with a side of more potatoes, with a bit of salted butter.  The pleasurable warmth of a full belly.  Looking in the window once at people eating at the guesthouse down in Gulleytown.
“Sure,” Tony replied airily.  “Steve—I call him Steve, of course. He’s really understanding.  About most things. Crazy protective, though.  Us newly Bonded and all.  I keep telling him, Steve, baby, calm down, you know?  Chill.  It’s not a big deal, but, well, I mean, you know what he’s like.  So old fashioned sometimes,” Tony said with a dramatic sigh.  Next to him, he heard Coulson let out a small cough to cover a surprised laugh.
Is it?
Tony was watching him, his mouth slightly parted, his expression unreadable. The regard, the intensity of it,  made Steve want to squirm where he stood, though he held himself firm.  Just a man, he told himself.  Just a man, like any other, he repeated, though he could hear the lie in his own thoughts.  He glanced over at the balcony again where no wind billowed the curtains despite the castle’s height.  He should go.
“Huh—” Tony started, then had to clear his throat where it had tightened to the point he couldn’t quite get enough air. “Hi, you.”
“As well as could be expected,” Tony said, with a resigned, but not unhappy, sigh.  “Most of the Board was supportive, if not wholly convinced.  Others are terrified the stock will crash and not recover when we announce.  I was…well, I was surprised that Obie wasn’t more enthused.  I thought I had him onboard.”
“Tony. Come on. Don't. Don't do this. I'm sorry, more sorry than I think I can say, that you thought...what you thought. But, it's not like we were ever going to grow old together in the first place,” Steve said in a quiet, steady voice that drove something sharp into Tony's chest, pounding it deeper and deeper with each word, because this was Steve at his most sure, most certain, the point when he'd made a decision, and each word just ratcheted up what was already inevitable in his mind. “I'm—I'm glad you didn't do the, the thing. I'm glad you didn't mean it. What you said then. But, you weren't wrong, Tony. You and me, we never made sense. Everyone knew it. We knew it, too. Look at how easily we fell apart,” he pointed out, probably in a reasonable enough manner, but Tony couldn't hear him over the rush of static blaring through his ears.
Steve wasn’t sure what to say to that, but whatever response he might have formed left him when Tony brought his knees up, clenched them around Steve’s hips, then let them fall open.  Steve pushed himself up to his knees and stretched across the bed to open the nightstand drawer and grab the tube that sat inside next to an assortment of pens, notepads and other odds and ends.
“I’m not bowing out of anything, Tony,” Steve said, harsher than he’d intended, but he was still reeling from the mention of Gulmira.  “Why do you keep doing that?  Trying to give me an out?  It’s like you want me to walk away from this, but you’re the one who pulled me into it in the first place.”
“I told you to stay in our chambers.  For this very reason, dammit!  What if—” Tony broke off, turning away and wiping a hand over his mouth.  “If you choose to behave like a child, you will be punished like one.  Go back to our chambers and wait for me.  Now.  I’ll deal with you as soon as my duties to my guests are done.”  He turned and stalked off, angry strides carrying him across the garden as Steve watched.
“Just A Rather Very Intelligent System,” Tony explained with a huff of a laugh.  “My A.I.  A bit of an homage to the man.”
“I’m not—I’m not really supposed to,” Tony began haltingly.
“Tony, Captain America is busting my ass out of prison.  I’m living the dream, man,” Rhodey grinned back.
“Still thinking about robots?” Steve asked.  He barely sounded winded.  Tony shot him an annoyed look over his shoulder. Well.  Mostly, he turned his head from where he was grinding his forehead into the mattress and drooled in Steve’s general direction, but whatever.  He felt he made his point.  Steve laughed then, and sped up his thrusts, giving quick, hard snaps of his hips that soon lost all sense of rhythm.
“He never should’ve gotten a bad conduct discharge. Not for that,” Steve cut in.
“At least the truth will finally come out, though, I guess,” the man said with a light shrug. “That’s something, right?”
There were records though, if you knew what to look for and where to look for it. You had to read between the lines. Mingi, the cursed children who brought bad luck to some tribes in Ethiopia. The lost ones, they were called by some of the indigenous Pacific Islanders. Changelings in Irish folk tales. Filipino stories told of Aswangs, who sicken and die quickly. Around the world, cultures seemed to have some lore about it, these children who were born wrong. It probably didn’t happen all that often, but it must have happened enough to scare people, to make them create these explanations for something they couldn’t control and couldn’t understand. To give them an excuse for why these children were shunned, hated even. Worse, sometimes.
Everything else just hurt and was over and done with, but the questions, ah, the questions, they hung on, clawing their way out whenever they could find a handhold, whenever they could remind him that maybe this was the thing, or this, or this could be the thing, too, you never knew. It was an endless loop of never being sure of anything, and it sucked worse than grabbing his ankles ever had. He'd learned that well enough over the years. This...this lull, if that's what it was, was temporary, it always was. Best not to get too comfortable.
“I have always wanted to see the interior of the Hoover Dam,” Steve chuckled, nipping at Tony’s ear.  “Someone once told me there were a lot of Art Deco touches in there.”
“In the military, we refer to this as your basic SNAFU. You sure about this? When I told you I'd chase him down with you again, I didn't figure you'd have to take me up on it,” Rhodey amended.
He shook his head, frowning at the stray thought.  Why was he thinking of that all of a sudden, when he never thought of that night, not even when his mother pressed for answers in the days after, when his father didn’t come home and Steve secretly prayed it would stay that way?   It was just a derelict old castle. Malevolent as it may look, it was likely little more than an abandoned ruin that no one remembered except in stories told in the dark to frighten children into obedience to their parents and the good book.
“Still no response from your friend?” Tony asked.
“Uh, yes,” Steve answered quickly.
The memory of the cave, small and round and littered with the bones of birds, muskrats, rabbits and other small prey, beneath a stone canopy carved cracked into the mountainside when the earth shook eons ago with markings older than words, came to him.  He shivered, remembering the holy man’s words as he gave Steve the draught. One is life, one is death.  Steve had thought the man meant the potion, and hesitated.  Which one is this, he had asked.  Each of you are both, the holy man said, then cackled with a strange, almost childlike laugh that unnerved Steve moreso than the ritual, and left him there with the firelight from the single torch casting shadows on the grooves of a story that…had it made sense at some point that night?  Steve thought it had, but it was like trying to remember a dream.
Oh.  Steve felt his cheeks warm and knew he would be red-faced, which would please Tony, who reveled in his reactions, so he pulled back enough to catch Tony’s eye and was rewarded with a soft smile and the stroke of Tony’s hand through his hair again.  The thought of cleaning Tony up like that rolled around in Steve’s head for a moment, then seemed to sit at the front of it, growing larger in scope the longer he thought about it, until it seemed to block out anything else, and somehow sinking down, lower and lower, sitting firm and tight behind his cock.
“No, no, it’s fine,” Steve rushed out.  It was.  Completely fine.  He stared at the pile of clothes that had a moment ago looked like a gift and now looked a lot like payment and felt a hot spike of humiliation crawl inside his stomach, and suddenly, he wanted to be anywhere but here.  “I’m going to see mom this morning.  They moved her to the new facility and already started rehab.”
“I really am proud of you, Tony,” Steve said, bringing his hands up to cup the sides of Tony’s face. “You worked so hard.  I know it wasn’t always easy, being the only Omega. All that pressure.  Having to be perfect, all the time, so they wouldn’t have any excuse.  You did it, though.  You showed them.  All of them. Everyone out there who thought this was some crazy stunt or just me indulging you, you showed them that you belong here, just as much as anyone else.  More.  But, you’ve always been more, haven’t you?  Always.  So much more than they want to let you be,” Steve said, his voice gentling, eyes going soft and crinkling at the corners, the way Tony liked.
“Tony,” Steve said.  Tony’s eyes slowly lifted to his, wide and dark, catching the light from the television in twin pinpricks.  “You don’t have to go.”
Speaking of, Tony thought with a glance over to the tan, pleather couch, where a slightly smashed pillow was stuffed between the cushion and the wooden arm.  There was still a depression in the seat, waiting to pop back up once it sucked in more air, which meant Rhodey had apparently handed off the baton not too long ago.
tried to get him to not do something once he sets his mind to it?”
He coughed again, not as badly this time, and wiped the spittle away with the bloodied rag.  His stomach ached with a sort of sour emptiness, and he supposed he should try to drink the tea, but couldn’t quite bring himself to.
“I know,” Steve replied.  He scrubbed a hand over his face. He was so tired.  She took his hand in her own and held it, warm and solid.  Steve thought about Tony.
The battle, such as it was, ended up being mostly clean-up from that point.  Hulk and Thor had taken down the bulk of the Doombots, and Hawkeye, Widow and SHIELD handled whatever made it outside the perimeter Steve had set.  They all gathered when it was over, gave brief reports to Fury.  Tony tried to apologize for his earlier behavior, but everyone just kept congratulating he and Steve and patting him on the back.
The morning crept up on Steve slowly, and for a while, he refused to allow himself to actually open his eyes, just enjoyed floating there in that space between full sleep and actual wakefulness. He was sore, a hot, achy sort of tenderness deep inside that made him flush a bit with remembered pleasure and a sharper dry, raw kind of tenderness on the outside of his body that jolted through him when he shifted on the bed. It felt good. Satisfying in a strange way, like the pleasure-pain that he felt when his muscles protested after a long run. Like he’d accomplished something, a good kind of earned discomfort stretching his skin and making his nerves tingle, like he was inside out and they were suddenly too close to the surface of his skin. He could feel everything with so much more intensity than usual, each brush of his fingers across his skin sending gooseflesh in its wake, the slight wave of air from the cooling unit enough to make his nipples pebble. He was warm, but not unpleasantly so, the sweat-soaked need of the night before just a strange, hazy memory. Everything was just…more. He usually felt wrung out after a Heat, but this time, it was like he had too much energy, his body practically vibrating with it.
“Shall we?” Tony asked, sweeping a hand towards the now empty doorway.
“You won’t be a problem here, now will you?” Zola asked, lifting his eyes up to Steve’s.  Steve returned the gaze as defiantly as he could.  To his surprise, Zola grinned, seeming pleased.  “Oh, yes.  Yes, good.  You are definitely interesting, aren’t you now?  How long was he at the port?”
“Gotta admit, this whole defend-my-honor thing is a definite turn on,” Tony said as they slowed under one of the lamplights next to a metal bench with a physically improbable suggestion scratched into the peeling paint on one of the back slats.
“Aww.  You sunk his battleship,” Tony said with mock sadness, tossing a small wave at Barnes, who frowned in return.
“What’s our ETA to the Tower?” Tony asked.
Of course, Steve thought with a slight grin, Bucky would say that was
He stopped and looked away, towards the sun where it hung low in the morning sky. The waves were starting to pick up. He could feel their motion shift the bottom under his feet.  He looked back over at the creature, his mouth pulling into a curious smile.
“I want to keep you safe.  Protect you from the world.  I’ve always wanted that,” Steve said, bringing his hand up to trace the barely there white line that cut across Tony’s check.  “But that’s not how you were made, is it?  Not what you were built for.  A safe life.  You never were.  You were always, well.  More.  More than anyone I ever met.  Someone who could handle being with me. That’s what I told myself.  I didn’t get it, not then.”
“Mr. Stark made some upgrades to the armor that I want to try out,” Tony said.  “Better torque on the joints.  Going to be a lot easier to throw you at things.”
--he realized it didn’t matter.  It’s Tony, he thought with a start of surprise that didn’t quite feel like surprise, so much as remembering something he already knew.
It was one of those questions that wasn’t really a question, Tony noticed, as the doctors and nurses quickly moved to clean up and file out of the room, dumping blood-covered gowns and gloves in the appropriate containers.  Someone picked up the kidney-shaped metal bowl that held the few tiny bullet fragments, so innocuously small, making them clink and roll against the sides.  The noise grated on Tony’s ears, making him grimace.  Nails on a chalkboard, he thought, though he had never actually heard the sound.  He imagined that was what it would always feel like from now on though.  Bullet fragments, rolling around in metal bowl.
Tony drifts off before midnight, with his head on Steve’s shoulder.  Steve waits it out, silently counting down as the ball drops on TV.  He kisses Tony’s head, brushing the hair aside and whispers “Happy New Year, Tony,” against Tony’s forehead.  Sometime later, after Ryan Seacrest is off the air, Steve carries Tony to bed.  Tony burrows himself into Steve’s chest and sighs happily, making a pleased, humming sound.  When he wakes up the next morning, Steve is in the kitchen making pancakes and listening to the news on the radio (which he likes to do, the weirdo), but there is a small, rectangular package by the bed wrapped in silvery paper.  It’s a journal.  Leather-bound in blue and serious-looking, with an elastic band around it.  When Tony opens it up, he sees the pages have dates at the top of them for the upcoming year.  An odd gift, Tony thinks, until he flips a little further through the pages and stops.  There’s writing there already.  Tony recognizes Steve’s neat, curling letters.
“They are,” Tony agreed with a nod, his face softening.  “I’m just saying.  He isn’t a bad guy, not really.”
“I...I don’t think I’m the right person to do that, Tony,” Steve protested, shifting uncomfortably in his chair.
“Yeah. Yeah, that’s what…that’s what I’m doing,” Tony insisted.  “Thinking.”  The words felt heavy.  Everything felt heavy. The room. The walls.  Coulson.  The letter.  It was all too much, pressing in, pushing down on the center of his chest, flattening his heart.  This is why they call it flatlining, he thought, feeling a laugh that wasn’t about anything funny well up from somewhere deep inside.
“Mr. Jarvis,” Steve began, leaning forward in his seat.  Tony realized he was holding a lump of cold potato salad on the end of his fork, hovering between his plate and his mouth, and slowly let his hand fall back down to the table.  “Have
“Jesus.  I can’t believe—fine, fine,” Barnes amended when Nat nudged his shoulder.  “He’s gonna kill me.  Okay.  So, he likes how smart you are.  You sometimes used to try to keep a lid on it, like you figured maybe he’d feel bad or somethin’ ‘cause you’re you or whatever.  But, see, Steve, he likes that you’re crazy-smart.  Thinks all the stuff you can do is just, I don’t know, amazing or whatever.  God, I had to listen to him read that stupid paper of yours over and over.  Doesn’t know what ninety percent of it says, but you wrote it, so,” Barnes finished with a shrug.  “Your turn,” he said pointedly to Rhodey.
them, not about Nat… and he wouldn’t, if Nat wasn’t maybe really into it one night or something… obviously, Bucky would want that to be good and he’d make sure things were okay, like Tony did, and not--
“Ah—“  Steve started.  Damn.  Right.   He could do this.  “Yeah, ah.  Just married, in fact.  A bit, um, bit of an unplanned thing, so,” Steve finished, holding up his ringless hand when he saw her eyes dart that direction.
“Oh,” Steve managed, his throat suddenly thick with an emotion he didn’t quite want to name.
It felt divine.  And like not nearly enough.  Steve groaned plaintively, earning a low chuckle from Tony.
“Yes, Friday?” Steve replied, glancing up out of habit.
“There’s a plate in the oven for you,” Ana said.  “You go on to your room, now. I’ll get it for you.”  She stood up then and rested her hands on Tony’s shoulders, daring anyone to protest.
, he thought, somewhat breathlessly,
“Well,” Howard said after a moment, his voice hard enough to make Tony go still and silent.  “That isn’t an option.  Since we’re being upfront with each other, I’ll tell you what your options are, how about that?  You go, make nice with the Captain, get him to Bond and have a nice life as the Omega of someone important.  Or, you keep on with this…this unnatural defiance that you seem to take great joy in spouting…and the Captain decides he’d much prefer some sweet, little thing who doesn’t mouth off or get it in his head to build a reactor in the basement on a whim—“
His eyes were bright and hard, his jaw set tight, though he just leaned back against the table and watched as Hammer knelt at their feet, scooping up his chips.  This was for me, Steve realized. This was all because of what he had told Tony earlier. Tony had lost God only knows how much money, deliberately, all to get to this moment.  He wasn’t sure what to think or how to feel about it, but he loved the man standing next to him. Fiercely. Deeply. Passionately. It hit him with a brute, blunt force, nearly knocking him backwards.  It was petty revenge, beneath both of them, really, Steve knew that, but satisfaction hardened in his throat and chest like a vice. He couldn’t help it. It felt good, like the world was balancing out, just a bit, and that night so long ago was a little less terrible for it.
“Yours,” Steve whispered, and let himself fall.
Tony had always thought there was so much of Steve he kept tucked away, hidden behind persona and uniform, but maybe it had been Tony who was hiding from it, he reflected as they thanked the Director and Tony shoved a check into her hand.  Had he wanted to see the part of Steve that talked in hushed tones to a grizzled, wiry-haired old man about the sounds of shells whistling through the air, or worse, the feeling of waiting for them, constantly being on alert, never able to relax?
“How is it that I make high-tech weapons in my basement, get kidnapped by terrorists, build a mechanical suit to escape and you still have better work stories?” Tony asked with a laugh.  He took a drink of his wine, dropped his eyes down to the salmon he was picking at, then lifted his gaze back to Steve.  “Speaking of your…work.  As we are.  Are you going to tell me how come a nice up-and-comer—wow, after the porn talk, everything sounds dirty.  Anyway, how’d someone like you end up in a place like that?”
“In time for what?” Steve asked.
“Lord Stone…he was…someone important to the King?” Steve asked.
He felt heavy. Ponderous with bloat. Crammed full of whatever these things were. They jostled slightly if he moved, but the feeling wasn’t unpleasant.  Just odd. Like being overfull with the pressure and push of it against his insides without the discomfort that usually accompanied it. He had, in his life, tried a great many things with his body. Some that were truly...inadvisable, he recalled with a grimace.  Admittedly,
By the time they made it to their suite, Tony had calmed down considerably.  Well, he didn’t want to shoot Clint anymore, at least.  It seemed like such effort, and Steve was here and he was running his hand up and down Tony’s spine and oh, bless him, he was still holding onto the sofa cushion.  He really was the best Omega ever.
We’ll have the band play something slow, Steve thought, holding back a choked-off sob. He closed his eyes, then slowly opened them again.  He looked at the glass. The windows just held empty chairs and round orbs of fluorescent lights superimposed over the afternoon sky.
The door jerked open, and a man stood there, hair unkempt and a scruff of beard over a grey t-shirt that said Army on the front and was slightly too big for him.  Oh, and he was missing an arm. So, there was that.
Bucky just shrugged his shoulders.  “Whatever you need.”
“Your Highness, please, I—“ Steve began, lifting his eyes to the King’s again, a plea there that he couldn’t quite put into words.
.  A nervous sort of jitteriness hit him seemingly in an instant, making his heart jump inside his chest at the same time the pressure pushing down on his shoulders began to seep into them, tensing the muscles until it felt like someone was trying to pull him apart.
.  How do I go out into the light again without something?  Something between me and that happening again?  No answer came to him, not this thousandth time he asked any more than it had the first, lying there in that hospital, still tasting the grit of sand in his mouth while Steve cradled him in his arms and told him this terrifying thing Tony made burned like a star.
“Yeah,” Steve answered.
“More pictures?” Steve groaned, but a smile broke through it.
“Go off the very responsible and completely vetted schedule Pepper has so carefully laid out for us?  Sounds not at all advisable,” Tony pointed out, clucking his tongue and shaking his head.  “Naturally, I’m in.  But, I will be blaming you. Feels only fair to tell you up front.”
They talked through the rest of the toast and two more cups of truly awful coffee. At some point, Tony resolved to have a new coffee maker delivered to the place out of a sheer sense of duty to the caffeine gods. Steve’s eyes finally flicked up to the clock behind the cash register, and he gave a quick little grimace that he tried to hide around the last sip of his coffee.
The bedrooms were pretty much as Allen had described them, one slightly bigger than the other, and each with a small closet lined in cedar.  The furniture was chunky, wooden and slightly off, like the pieces were made by the same person, but years apart.  The bedroom walls were bare, though someone had left a truly hideous painting of a wagon wheel leaning against a stump on the wall in the hallway.  Steve looked at it for a moment, then shook his head and huffed out a low laugh, wondering if someone had purchased it on a humorous whim or if it had simply come with the cabin and no one had the courage to risk whatever release of dark energy was sure to follow its removal.
He was down the stairs and out the door, greeting Happy with a genuine smile.  Happy opened the back passenger door for him and he climbed in, sinking back into the deep, leather seats.  The ride back to Tony’s place was pleasant enough.  He made small talk with Happy from time to time, wondering briefly how odd this must be for the chauffer, but mostly just watched the world go by.  He’d missed most of it last night, but much of the drive down the coast was stunning.  They pulled into Tony’s driveway, the gate swinging open for them automatically, and arrived back at Tony’s house in what seemed like less time than last night’s trip had taken, but that was probably because last night’s drive had been a bit of a blur.  He hopped out of the car on his own, nodding his thanks at Happy and trying to walk nonchalantly to the front doors.  Standing in front of them, he searched for a doorbell on the flat walls, but nothing was obvious.  Feeling rather stupid now, he was about to knock when a disembodied British voice announced, “Welcome back, Sir.  Please come in.  Mr. Stark will be with you momentarily.”  With that, the front doors opened on their own, because of course they did, Steve thought, smiling a little.
“Tony, none of that stuff had anything to do with you.  Not even you can stretch your guilt complex that far,” Rhodey huffed.  “Spill.  Come on.  Did you sleep with him?  You slept with him, didn’t you?”
“Come on, Tony! Think of it! You’re talking about the most powerful force on Earth,” Bruce reminded him. “It starts and ends wars, it makes people do the most extraordinary things, the most terrible things…the worst of ourselves and the highest expression of humanity, all in one. To be able to understand that…but, okay, sure, I can wax poetic about the science of that kind of love all day long…why are we talking about this? Didn’t think this was really your kind of thing.”
“First, ‘strong no’ does not cover it,” Tony began when he opened his eyes again.  “Second, oh my God, get this baby death fruit cleaned up before Steve gets down here,” Tony shouted, pointing at the bits and pieces of watermelon.  “Jarvis, seriously, I know what I said about not listening to me about anything to do with solid rocket boosters for the next couple of weeks, but I think this calls for some kind of override. Third—“
“They always do,” she said softly, knowingly, with no small amount of what Tony knew was hard-won understanding.  “And the next thing I know, I’m watching this—this creature try to pull your arms off like petals on a daisy, and I—I can’t, Tony, you know—” she stopped and sucked in a breath, running a hand over her forehead and smoothing back her hair.  “You know I can’t.”
“James,” Steve answered.  “His name was James.”  Weirdly, Tony’s first thought was that Steve was lying, which made no sense, because why would anyone lie about that?
He checked down the hall again, but nothing had changed. Well. He couldn't just stand there in the kitchen all night, he thought with a frustrated grimace. Picking his steps carefully as he went, he passed Steve's door, and made his way into his room. He stood there on the threshold of his room, feeling foolish as he rocked back and forth on his feet, unsure whether or not he should shut the door.
He hadn’t meant to sound that way.  To let himself sound that way.  The sherry sloshed against the rim of the glass.  He set it down on the marble-topped table and walked over to stand in front of the cabinet.  He could see his reflection in the silver plate.  Jarvis always kept everything in here so shiny.  The way she liked it. The way she liked all her things.  Beautiful and gleaming and perfect.
“You are exquisite,” Tony told him, walking over to stand next to him.  Steve felt a hand splay over his lower back, steadying him, and he realized he had been rocking.  Like a ship, he thought, nonsensical though it was.  The hand was good.  Not pushing him, just there, with enough pressure that Steve could feel it on the ridge of the bones at his back, hard and sure.  Tony’s other hand came up to catch Steve’s chin and turn his face to Tony’s.  “Trust me, beautiful one.”
“Cap, Steve, please, please, nghhhhh,” Tony moaned, the rest lost to incoherence.
“Good. I called Nat, by the way.  She knew something was up after the little impromptu dinner party the other day.  Said she was this close to coming down to the Tower and finding out what the hell was going on,” Rhodey informed him.
The group slowed in front of Daniel, who, of course, brought up the rear, then surged forward, almost as one.  The camera fell, clattering to the dock and resting on its side, so the whole image tilted.
somehow.  He felt it, the way they looked without seeing, the way they took something without asking.  It felt like they were saying something he didn’t want to hear, but wasn’t able to avoid.  Just had to grit his teeth and take it.
Big and ugly and stupid, that was him, Anto repeated to himself as he walked.  Except…the Stranger looked like him. Not exactly, of course—he was dark-haired and dark-eyed and his face was smooth, the way an Omega’s was supposed to be, though he could grow a beard, unlike the clan Omegas, who were all bare-faced, though he kept his face carefully shaved.  But the basic features were the same. And Anto didn’t exactly think the Stranger was ugly anymore. Just different. Sometimes, when he thought about it late at night as he lay in his furs, sometimes he even thought the Stranger was pleasing to look upon, with his water-eyes and hair the color of the sun.
“More of a wormhole kind of guy than actual worms,” Tony replied, his mouth twisting into a grimace.  Probably better to get everything on the table up front than face whatever might result from Rogers being disappointed later.
“Ready?” Steve asked brightly, holding up the basket.
“Think I’ll head to bed,” Tony said dully.  “Guess the night got to me more than I realized.”
“Just about a year ago, I reckon,” Happy replied.  “Maybe a bit less.  Long before he had you, that’s for sure.  Alphas, they’re not right without their Omegas, are they?  Never seen nothin’ quite like that, though. I’ve driven for some weird folks over the years, between Hollywood and the government, but gave me the willies, the way Cap just stared, all quiet-like, I’ll tell ya that right now.”
“Good.  You may come if you can.  Or not, if you can’t. It is of no matter to me.  You may say your word, but that’s all. Otherwise, you will not speak until I speak to you. I can’t have you distracting me from my letters,” Tony said.
“We assigned him a therapist,” Fury said.  “Doctors. Everyone cleared him for duty.”
“Good man.  Don’t screw this up,” Barnes said, then went back to poking a cocktail fork at a plate of caviar.
“That, I checked on. They’ve requested six more to test at Walter Reed and Brooke, but you’re holding out, demanding they commit to a big order,” Rhodey added.
(See the end of the chapter for
But Steve might as well have wrapped himself in raw meat and gone sauntering through a pack of rabid dogs, despite all the momentary camaraderie with the press his words seemed to have sparked.  The pond scum that made up the paparazzi didn’t work that way, not in even the vaguest sense of the long-term, and Tony would like to put it down to simple naiveté on Steve’s, except that he didn’t believe that for hot minute.  Steve had known exactly what he was doing, which made absolutely no sense, unless you just discarded rationality and self-interest completely, which, sure, Steve seemed like a good enough guy even with his clothes on, but still.  People didn’t just put themselves out there for a virtual stranger without there being something in it for them.  That didn’t happen.
Steve was quiet for a long moment, then couldn’t hold it in any longer. “Are you mad?”
“He was—he was
“We will,” Tony corrected. “I don’t know how to…how to think of this place,” Tony gritted out, looking down and away from where Steve stood next to him. “What was done here, in my name.  It is almost too horrible to comprehend, yet it brought you to me, and I cannot reconcile those things, except to say that both are true.  Life and death.  If those things have a home, this is it.  An end and a beginning.   At least, I hope that is what it will be.  That is all I have to offer, pitiable recompense though it may be.”
“I did, and son, I have to tell you, I don’t appreciate being pulled off my boat because the God-damned Army thinks it can deny Sergeant Barnes here his due as a soldier injured in the line of duty,” Phillips replied.  “Maybe you can explain that one to me, because the way I remember it, we made a promise to our boys, and call me an old fart, but I think Sergeant Barnes has more than paid his due to his country, as Captain Booker over there can probably attest, so you’re going to have to explain to me why,” he continued, punctuating each word with a pounding of his hand on the railing in front of him, “you think this man who I trained and who I personally vouched for as one of the finest soldiers I’ve ever had the honor of sending out into the field was deserving of a bad conduct discharge and losing his benefits all because he punched Thaddeus Ross’s little flunky over getting too handsy with a lady?  Please tell me that is not the kind of Army we have nowadays, Thomas, because if it is, then I think some of our commanders need to march themselves right back to Basic and get a nice reminder of what exactly no man left behind means.  Well, son?  I’m waiting.”
“So, you know.  If you want to keep them.  The checks.  You can,” Steve finished, each word sounding like it was being slowly and carefully formed. Maybe it was.  He had one hand clenched around the backpack strap and one wrapped around the front, hugging it to him.
“I’m setting it up. Saturday night.  I’ll tell you when and where after I talk to Nat,” Pepper added, then dropped her hands to her lap, clutching the phone. “If you really don’t want to…”
Karma is a bitch, isn’t that what they say?  Tony stared at the elevator doors, waiting for them to open, his distorted reflection staring back at him.  Maybe it was fair.  Fitting.  Steve was the price Tony would pay in forfeit for his mistakes.  He could live with that, he supposed, he told himself, looking down at his hand where the simple band gleamed from the third finger.
“Tony?” Steve asked, brow furrowing into a pinched frown as his eyes darted just beyond Tony long enough to realize Tony had come alone.
“I know,” Steve replied.
Maybe out here wasn’t so very different from in there.  Maybe it was.  But, maybe it didn’t have to be.
to.  This was his best chance to escape, perhaps his only chance to ever make it home again.  But wanted to come? No. No, he hadn’t
“Ah,” Jarvis announced, then went back to fiddling with the kettle.
“Are you--” Tony began.
“Fuck that.  You need to talk about it.  Besides, I’m your husband.  Communication is key to a relationship, they say,” Tony tried, then felt his face fall flat.  “The weapons…the shells, the anti-aircraft stuff, that was SI, wasn’t it?” Tony asked, mouth twisting into a thin, hard line.
“Well, that’s certainly true,” Tony snorted.  “Sure.  Why not? It’ll be fun.”  Coulson started walking back the way they’d come, though Rogers hung back a bit, standing next to Tony.
He didn’t.
.  His nostrils flared, and he sucked in a breath, and thought for a moment that he could taste him again, the way he had that night, musky and salty with sweat and slick with oil. The hairs on his arms and the back of Steve’s neck stood on end, the way bales of hay sometimes leapt with small bursts of lightning and would catch fire if you didn’t wet them.  His cock throbbed and pulsed at the thought.  He could feel the thread of moisture spurt out of the tip and watched Tony’s eyes drop down.  His tongue came out to wet his lips, and Tony’s eyes followed the movement, going dark and heavy-lidded.
Steve opened his mouth, as if to say something else, but he snapped it shut instead, dipped his head to his chest with a quick, firm nod and turned towards the door. He had one hand on the handle when he stopped. Tony could just see his own reflection in the glass of the door next to where Steve stood, soft and whited out under the too-bright lights. He looked like a ghost. Maybe he was. Maybe he was jus seeing that now.
“You mentioned there was a payment to Mr. Rogers upon the dissolution of your marriage?” Mitch asked.
Stark.
“Whoa. Totally meant to do that,” Tony said quickly, as he reached out and steadied himself on the desk.  He grinned up at Steve, biting his lip a bit and eyeing Steve up and down with an open, brazen curiosity.
“Tony, come on, don’t do th—“ Rhodey began.  Tony hit the end call button before Rhodey could finish, then stared down at his phone.  It buzzed in his hand, Rhodey’s picture lighting up the screen again. Tony sighed and hit the answer button.
Thank you all so much for reading and enjoying this little bit of insanity.  They do finally make it to the island next chapter.  It is partially written and pretty much all porn.  Go me.  I intend to do a Steve POV after that and then probably a final chapter of some kind to wrap this one up.
Actually, he understood perfectly.  Quite frankly, the idea of not having to talk to Howard was a gift in and of itself.  If he made a list, it would probably be 1) Four More Inches in Height; 2) Firefly Back On the Air; 3) Not Talking to Howard; 4) World Peace (mostly because this would annoy Howard); and 5) Personal Acknowledgment from George Lucas that Han Shot First.
“Beautiful,” Tony murmured, then sat down in the chair in front of Steve.
Where had that thought come from? Steve blinked and shook his head, trying to clear it, then brought the heel of his hand up to grind against his forehead, as if he could root out the errant thought.  He wasn’t supposed to think those things about Tony.  He’d gotten over that a long time ago.  Made himself stop and moved on. Pushed those kinds of thoughts aside.  Sure, sometimes, there would be the odd, fleeting moment when Tony would brush up against him, smile at him in that bemused sort of way Tony had that made Steve’s stomach do somersaults or clap him on the back after a battle or—or nothing, he reminded himself.  Because there wasn’t anything and there wasn’t going to
“You said you took the money. From Howard,” Tony choked out, the words seeming to stick in his throat as his body vibrated with tension, like his skin was stretched too tightly around his bones all of a sudden. “Is that—was that true? Did you take the money? It wasn't in the pre-nup...was it some side agreement with Howard? It's okay. I understand. I mean, we were kids, right? So, its okay. If you took it. I just—I just need to know. For the lawyers,” Tony added, swallowing around the lie.
“You’re him,” the woman said.  “The Raj’Inama.  The one they’re all talking about.  Look, Almec, it’s Tony’s special little pet, do you see?  Isn’t he divine? Of course, he would be.  Tony always had good taste.”
“I’m sorry, Tony,” Steve replied, eyes stinging, because it was too easy to see now, after the tapes, when he knew what a four-year-old Tony looked like when he was scared and knew what he sounded like when he said Captain America was a hero.
“I’ll still make it,” Tony replied.  “It’ll be fine.  Can’t go wrong giving people money.  They’re generally going to clap and check the excellent box on the survey. Eleven out of ten broke college kids would recommend to friends.”
“That’s—no, that’s fine.  My fault.  I knocked.  I was knocking.  Going to knock.  I—you were in there a long time, so I just…” Steve trailed off, swallowing audibly.  There were patches of bright color blooming on his cheeks and down his neck towards his chest and disappearing under the V of his t-shirt. Not that Tony was looking.  At Steve’s chest.  Because, he wasn’t.  Looking.
He stared at the phone, then slowly put it in his pocket and turned around, walking on unsteady feet back to the garage.  Steve was hurt.  Badly enough for Coulson to feel obligated to call.  Tony was supposed to sit here and wait for an update.
, Steve,” Tony shot back, turning to face Steve with a flurry of irritation.  “I don’t do that. Not anymore.  Not since you…”
“Why don’t you tell me about your stars,” Steve suggested, ignoring Tony.  Tony felt him twist to crane his head to look over to the window.  He pointed.  “Which one’s that?”
“I think…there’s no such thing as a weapon that works that you only use once,” Tony said, voice faltering  a bit as he frowned.
Hole fifteen was Steve’s downfall, which Tony handled with gentlemanly grace.  Except, not.
“Jarvis—“ Tony started.
“You could say that,” Kirk drawled, then blew a puff of air through his lips.  “He finds me disappointingly familiar.  You get along with your parents?  You do, don’t you?  God, you probably have ringtones for them.   Something cute and catchy for mom that’s very middle America kind of eat-your-hot-dog-don’t-think-about-what’s-in-it. Taylor Swift?  Dad gets Johnny Cash, clearly.  Or, maybe it’s some post-ironic thing like Cat Stevens?  You still get together and watch the Superbowl in matching Patriots jerseys.  Mom tells you how much she likes Bland White Girl on Dancing with the Stars.  I think I’ve seen your family in an ad for car insurance.”
Steve hadn’t expected the joy.  That was a surprise. Still surprised him.  This thing that happened when Tony was around, where he laughed more than he should and listened longer than he thought he could, and felt more than might be right.  It scared him sometimes, how easy it was.  Everything with Tony was easy, and nothing was ever this easy.
“I think I might actually like you, Rogers,” Tony said, grinning madly at the sight before him.  Steve smiled a wobbly smile that made his heart skip a beat.
Steve woke with a start, coming to that kind of instant, heart-pounding wakefulness that leaves your whole body feeling off kilter.  Everything was wrong, was his first thought, then his mind caught up and he realized he was on Tony’s sofa with his head pillowed on Tony’s lap.  Steve looked up to apologize, and saw Tony’s head lolled to one side, eyes shut, mouth slightly parted in sleep.  He looked young, Steve thought.  Softer, somehow, the usual lines of worry smoothed away by sleep.  Vulnerable in a way that Steve didn't usually associate with Tony, though he knew a lot of what Tony presented was by careful design.  Tony’s hand was halfway through Steve’s hair, as if he’d been in the midst of running it through when he fell asleep.  There was warmth and safety and a strange sense of certainty that flickered through him as he watched Tony sleep.  Steve lay there for a long moment, still and quiet, and let himself bask in the feeling, fleeting though it might be.  Tony was a lot of things, but there was little certain about any of this, Steve was well aware.
Chitauri, Steve mentally repeated the odd-sounding word.  He felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise and suppressed a shiver.  A rabbit ran over your grave, Steve Rogers, his mother would say, an old saying, but one that felt truer now than ever.
nothing, where Steve signed away anything of value he might have gotten from his marriage to Tony.
Of course, none of those things were the thing in the room that his gaze snapped to as soon as the door closed.
do, like it or no--those are often very different things.”
Waiting. He had no idea how that would go.  Okay, well, he had
Fear twisted his gut, souring his breakfast.  This couldn’t be happening. Not like this. Not in the day, he mentally pleaded to whatever deity might be listening. This was bad. It had to mean something was wrong with him, didn’t it? This, combined with the strange dreams that plagued him of late, something must be wrong with him. If anyone found out…well.  He didn’t know what would happen, but it likely wasn’t anything good.
“So, Pepper and Rhodey loved your—our—idea about how to work the Board on the arc reactor project.  Pepper’s making graphs.  Rhodey’s going to find a guy from the Corps, but thinks it would be better if we somehow referenced the inherent superiority of the Air Force.  Admittedly, I’m not sure how that’s related, but you can’t say the guy doesn’t offer valuable input,” Tony announced as he made his way towards where Steve stood under the glass bus stop enclosure.
“It wasn’t the armor.  Well, not--not just the armor,” Tony protested.  It sounded weak, even to his own ears.   He hadn’t been able to leave until the armor was finished.  Even for them, even for this.  He hadn’t been able to leave. “There was the investigation thing, and the company is obviously—there are issues, Obie’s trying, but the Board…they’re not happy.  Obviously,” Tony said, shaking his head.  He could feel the familiar frustration grinding through him.  Like gears turning.  Not turning. Tightening.  Tony looked up at Steve again, then pulled a face, craning his neck back and grinning widely.
When he heard Steve's heavy footfalls pad away in the direction of the bedrooms, he lifted his gaze and watched Steve's back as he walked down the hall, until he disappeared into the larger of the two bedrooms and shut the door with a soft click.
Hope.  Such a small word, Tony thought.  Just over a month of hopeful optimism, a month of looking toward the future, a month of conversations interspersed with name choices, a month of Steve driving him crazy with don’t-lift-that and let-me-Tony, and then Steve had been the one who had to take it all back when Tony couldn’t handle it.  He had kept one thing, the little brightly-colored plastic gear toy that lit up and made noises when you turned them.  Explore and Grow Busy Gears.  One of the gears had a smiley face on it.  He kept that one, the one that said Steve imagined their child and saw someone like Tony, tucked it into the back of the closet in box and told himself maybe one day.   Steve didn’t ask why he kept it, though Steve didn’t say much of anything for a while that spring.  The lilies were always there, though.  Even when Steve went away on missions.  The lilies, fresh and vibrant and looking for the stars, showed up.
, which was--it was amazing, that was the only word for it.  If he were honest with himself, talking to Tony about the various projects SI was working on had been almost as exhilarating as the sex.  Almost.  He missed being a part of something like that.  Once upon a time, Sam had tried to entice him to come work down at the VA center or do something with one of the many contacts Sam had at his disposal, but then, there had been school and Brock, and he’d had such a hard time with just keeping a regular job with Mr. Nguyen… plus, he hadn’t heard back from any of the other places he applied, so it hadn’t felt like anything more than a pipe dream to think he could work at one of the places Sam suggested.  Maybe after he got his degree, though…. maybe.  He could at least try.  Rollins giving him a pity job had been nice, but it wasn’t exactly fulfilling.  Not the way hashing out things with Tony had been.
“Should they ever decide to do more than pillage and plunder their neighbors, would they come this far north and threaten a kingdom defended by an army?” Tony asked, looking over at Rhodes.
“Yeah,” Rhodes sighed.  “My first commission, right out of university, I just wanted to do well,” Rhodes said, making Steve frown at the seeming change in conversation.  “Show everyone what I was made of. Serve my country. Make my family proud.  Make my King proud.  Earn my way to knighthood, kneel before him and offer my sword.  That was all I wanted,” Rhodes told him, mouth tight.  “We’ve known peace here for a long time. Few have the might to attack us, and fewer still would dare.  But, the borders still draw skirmishes at times.  We were sent to put down some self-styled warlord who’d gotten a little too powerful and kept causing problems with some minor Lord’s holdings. Burning the common folk’s homes, stealing food and cattle, that kind of thing.  I thought it was beneath me, to tell you the truth,” he said, shaking his head.  “Why send Crown soldiers to do what the Lord’s militia should be able to handle?”
Steve jostled the key a bit more in the lock, then released his hand, flexing the fingers wide for a moment before twisting it again. Nerve damage.  Tony had forgotten. Well, not forgotten.  More like, not wanted to think about for a long time.  IED.  Same one that had taken Barnes’ arm.  Not that he’d hacked military medical records or anything.
at the pushing away thing.  Like, truly, deeply terrible at it.  You just can’t help yourself.  Let’s face it, your hobbies include: loving me, making me happy, trying your best to take care of me, finding me adorable, and--stop me if you’ve heard this one—doing the exact opposite of pushing me away despite what occasionally comes out of your mouth.”
Tony groaned, equal parts desire and relief, and his hands came up, butterfly-light, and wrapped around Steve’s hips, roaming up his chest and over his back.  Tony’s fingers scraped over his nipples, the peaks becoming taut, down his stomach and through the sparse line of wiry hair, then back up and over his shoulders, his arms, down his thighs where he rocked lightly, cock jutting out proudly between them.  Everything was hot. His skin, his cock, inside him, everywhere. His mind was hazy and slow, and at the same time, focused with absolute clarity on everything Tony was doing. On the display of emotions that flitted across his face. Desire. Amazement.  Worry. Want. Hope. Tony’s face was an extraordinary canvas, painted in bold, brilliant strokes with everything he always tried so hard to hide. It was, Steve thought, probably one of the most humbling and gratifying moments of his life that Tony let him see it.
, Steve thought, stomach whooshing in a freefall, the air leaving his chest like it had been punched out of him.
Steve had not meant to sleep.  That he would had not even occurred to him. He had watched the King depart, with the two statue-silent guards on his heels, then lain there on the bed, body thrumming and tightening, like a key twisting in a lock just before it finally catches.
“Sorry. Can’t be too careful, you know?” she offered by way of an explanation.  Steve thought it was all just rather sad, though he understood Stark’s need for precautions.  Especially for...this kind of thing.  “The keycard will get you into the suite,” Ms. Potts was saying. “Just swipe it over the elevator’s security panel then press the button for the thirty-fourth floor. That will be the Empathy Suite, where Mr. Stark is staying.”
Tony stopped dead at the top of the stairs, looking at Steve with a hard expression that Steve couldn’t place.
“Glad you’re finally starting to deal with that.  Knew bonding would be good for you,” Happy replied.  Huh?  What the hell was Happy even talking about?  He clearly didn’t understand.
“Then, I would say you’ve had far too much of this wine,” Steve said, tipping at the top of the bottle with one finger.
“Is it truly so very terrible here?  Do you suffer so very much in your servitude?” Tony demanded, voice hard with bitterness and exasperation.  “I would give you anyth—” he broke off and looked away, hands curling into fists, almost as if he were trying to hold on to something.  When he looked back at Steve, his face was a shell, empty and brittle.  “There are other laws,” Tony said, voice low and rough, face etched with something that in another situation, Steve would have called grief.  “Rules that must not be broken.  Recalcitrance—true disobedience--will not be tolerated.  Wielding a weapon is forbidden.  Running away, of course…I am sure you know the punishment for that.”
A guard opened the door and stepped back to allow them to pass.  The room was much the same as Steve remembered it from last night, though this time, he spared a moment to look around.  He had Lord Hammer’s chamber to compare it to, now, and this was…different.  Far more lavish in many ways, with its fine fabrics and beautifully done furnishings, but, Steve noticed, nothing was for show, the way Hammer’s room seemed designed to showcase whatever it was Hammer hoped to convince people of.   It was a chamber fit for a King, and, had he had anything of value, Steve would have bet that the King hadn’t chosen a single thing in there.  The antechamber, though, that told a different story, Steve thought as he followed Zola in that direction.   This was where the King lived.  You could see it in every corner and pile, in the way the walls hung with bits and pieces and tools of every sort Steve recognized and then some.
Tony took a sip of punch and caught Sugar purse her lips and exchange a look with Rebecca as a trio joined their group.  An older, rotund man with salt-and-pepper hair, who looked slightly over-inflated, like he had insulted Harry Potter’s parents, plopped down in a barrel chair across from Tony, and a blond man around Tony’s age with wide-spaced gray eyes and thin, delicate features, and a stunning woman with golden hair that fell in waves around a movie-star worthy face took up the empty space on the sofa next to him.
Fine.  So, he should work out more.
“Did you…enjoy your bath?” the King asked, curling his lip into his mouth before he could smile.  His eyes lit up, crinkling at the edges.  “I hear those are very good for relaxing.  Was it relaxing?” Steve turned slowly to look at the man in disbelief.  He was…teasing him.  The King was teasing him.  About last night.  Steve glared at him.  The King threw back his head and let out a bark of laughter, then clapped his hands together and pointed at the table in front of them.
“MIT,” Kirk said.
should be.  But, certainly, nothing like this should be here.  He wasn’t even sure if it should exist at all, so unnerving was the realization that it might have been here his whole life. Longer, even, by the looks of it.  Protected from prying eyes up here in the far reaches of the mountain.  In hiding, he thought, feeling a chill course over his skin that had little to do with the air.
“I can’t ask him to Bond with me without knowing—” Steve protested.
“I did,” Steve replied.  “That was…wow, Tony, that was amazing.  What you did.  I sent it to my doctor friend, and he’s going to take it to the R&D department at the hospital.  He said it was a real breakthrough.  Something that could change lives.  You really…just did that, huh?”
“Whatever it is, you know you can tell me, right?” Tony said.  Steve looked away with a grimace.  “Steve?”
“In Clint’s defense, he was very, very drunk,” Steve commented, smiling at the memory. “Probably not quite as drunk as Bucky though.  When Bruce found them, they were both sitting in a puddle of mud and donkey piss, laughing like loons. There was a chunk of skin missing from Clint’s shoulder—he still has the scar.  Bucky insisted it was a love bite and kept telling Clint he had a better chance with the donkey than Phil.”  Tony was bent low over his saddle, laughing into Audi’s neck while the horse walked placidly along, picking its way over the path.
“No problem,” Steve replied.  He went to the refrigerator and took out a bottle of water, drinking it down with the door open, light and cool air wafting out.  There was the bottle of ketchup sitting accusingly on the top shelf, Tony noted with a glare. Damn judgmental condiments.  He’d tried.  “You going to work on your robots today?” Steve asked, turning back to face Tony.
“Hey,” Tony said, raising his hand to rub gently at the side of Steve’s head.  “C’mere,” Tony urged, pulling Steve’s head down to his chest.  He could hear it now, Tony’s heart, and his own, still pounding with the rush of feeling.  He stayed there until the beats subsided to something approaching normal, then sighed, shifted and then slowly pulled out of Tony, feeling Tony’s long, deep sigh as he did.
For wanting to have everything, even if it was built on a lie.  For not
Steve was going to take him right here in the driveway of his parents’ house, Tony thought with a dazed sort of longing.  He was falling.  Or that was how his mind decided to process the rush of terror and exhilaration slammed through him at the thought, making his heart skip like a pebble on a pond.  This was crazy, insane.  They couldn’t possibly—not here, now—it wasn’t—
Steve’s eyes traced over him, then locked on Tony’s gaze as his hands went to the fly of Tony’s jeans.  It was all Tony could do not to push his hips up against Steve’s hands.  Tony took his swollen bottom lip in his teeth and watched Steve’s whole body give a stuttering jerk in response.  The sharp, grinding metal sound of the zipper being pulled down drowned out every other sense in Tony’s head.  Then his jeans were being tugged down over his hips, the open V at the center scraping down the length of his hardened cock through his boxers.  Tony hissed, then groaned and let his eyes fall shut. He couldn’t do anything about his hips canting up, trying to chase the sensation.    His boxers were soaked through.  The rush of air made the spots cold against his skin, and he shivered as the feeling warred with the heat flaring inside him.
One day, after he was gone, Tony would find someone else. Someone he could truly share his life with. Someone who wasn’t Steve. Would that someone care for Cam and Peter the way Steve did? He hoped so, though that hope was tinged with a bitter resentment he knew he had no right to feel.
“Steve said you might be by with the, ah, lawyer stuff. Here,” Neighbor Guy continued, reaching just inside his door, making a jingling sound as his hand dug around for whatever it was he was looking for. “You can wait inside. Steve’ll be back soon. Clockwork, that guy, am I right? What's Steve need a lawyer for anyhow? You're not scamming him, right? Doin' this pro boner or somethin'?”
“Did she say why Peggy wanted me to have this?” Steve asked, frowning down at the case for a long moment before handing it back to T’Challa and pocketing the drive.  “Seems like it should go to Tony, really.”
“I do.  Okay, I don’t,” Tony corrected at Steve’s look.  “I’m learning.  Whatever it is, though, Steve, we’ll get through it.  Together.  We will.  I know, it’ll be hard, but--”
“You don’t want to fail him,” Bucky corrected. “What do you call this, then? Steve, the only way you’ve ever failed him is by running away from letting yourself love him. I see you do it, and I understand it, I do, because I’ve done it. I’ve done it, and it frustrates the hell out of me to see you doing the same damn thing, because you could have so much more. You want to keep this part of yourself away from him so badly you’ll hurt him to do it and call it protecting him. You’re not protecting shit but yourself. You gotta stop,” Bucky repeated. “Or you aren’t going to be able to walk away one of these days, and you’ll look around and everything you once wanted will be too far away, and that’s a half-life, Steve, a part of yourself you can’t get back once its gone. You think I want that for you? You’re all—damn it, Steve, you’re all I have left! You’re the only one who knew them! You held them, you touched them, you
“Yeah,” Steve replied.  He sighed and ran a hand through his hair.  His stomach swooped, then twisted.  “Hard to believe it’s real.”
“You like that about present company,” Tony pointed out.
Tony smiled then, soft and sure, the nervousness seemingly gone or at least held at bay for now.  He leaned down, putting one hand on each side of Steve’s head and dipped his mouth down to capture Steve’s.  At first, the kiss was sweet, almost chaste, but quickly turned into something far different as Tony flattened his length on top of Steve, moving in slow, sinuous motions, rubbing and grating a wondrous friction in all the right places.  Steve’s hands wound their way under Tony’s arms and splayed over Tony’s back as the kiss deepened.
when they looked at him.  At least, right up until he offered to buy me for the night, Steve snorted out a low laugh, then looked guiltily over his shoulder, though Brock was still snoring softly.
“Tony—what??? What are you—wait.  You mean, there’s…there’s some kind of signal that I could…and you would…” Steve’s voice trailed off.  He looked off towards the swath of trees in front of them. “Just like that. Just—just like that. Wow.”
“Me? Why me?” Tony demanded.  “If anyone, it should be Natasha.”
“Nope,” Steve replied, then ran a hand over his mouth and started laughing.  “Not a clue.  But, I like hearing you talk about it.  I’m glad you had fun.”
Pushing himself up to his knees, Steve took each of Tony’s feet in turn and removed his shoes, then his socks.  Tony watched with a sort of detached fascination.  His heart was fluttering, hummingbird-like, in his chest, and there were creeping spots of bright red warming his skin, but he was calm. Centered.  Steve would take care of him.
“Huh? Oh, no.  No, nothing like that,” Tony assured him.  He didn’t want Steve to worry. “Though with all the honeydew they put in those things, it wouldn’t surprise me.  What?  It’s a filler fruit, everyone knows that!”
We have to fix this, or they’ll come after you, Shuri—
“But…you will leave, you said,” Steve repeated.
“Is—is Pepper your—do they call them ‘Madams’ now?” Steve asked with almost doe-like curiosity, as if the words pained him to say. “I-I don’t want to get you in trouble or anything. I mean—if you—if you need to stay longer or something…I could—I could maybe make some coffee or…?”
“Retirement has been something of an adjustment for both of us,” Rebecca admitted.
“Wasn’t wrong, but if that got me out of my...unfortunate incarceration in Turnbury’s dungeon, I’ll not argue the point,” Bruce said.
It wasn’t a good kiss.  Even Tony knew that much.  It was teeth clacking together, noses bumping, lips sliding against each other, and all around probably terrible, but Tony kept his mouth on Steve’s, and God, it wasn’t a good kiss at all, but it felt like heaven. Steve’s whole body was hard and unyielding, coiled tight with tension, but his lips were soft against Tony’s, warm and pliant.  Tony’s mind helpfully supplied the image of Steve chewing on one of his charcoal pencils while he sat in the garage with Tony, that plump bottom lip of his folded around the curve, and Tony heard himself groan into Steve’s mouth.
Stane shifted slightly.  “If he touches him again, you can shoot him,” Tony said almost lightly to Happy.  And for the first time, Steve noticed that there was a bulge under Happy’s evening jacket, a reminder that Happy was, after all, Tony’s bodyguard, and for the first time, actually looked the part.
“Your Highness, if you would but look—“ Zola started.
“Flattery will...likely work very well, I must admit,” Tony replied.  “At least from you,” he added, bending over and placing a quick kiss on top of Steve’s head.  “As for you,” he continued, eyeing Cam, “I know your game, Small Hands, but the attempt is well met, nonetheless.”  Cam grinned at him and went back to shoving food in his mouth.
“I know things have been a lot harder than we thought, but it’s going to work out, Brock. Come on, you never let a few setbacks stop you when we were trying to dig out that pit for the wall around base camp--remember that? God, that was a mess.  But, we just kept at it and got it done somehow.  Same with this.  You’ll get there, I know it,” Steve told him.
“Me, too,” Tony said quietly, catching himself as his voice shook a bit.  He cleared his throat, trying to shake the lump loose.  “I mean, I’m glad, too.  No one ever picked me.  Before, I mean, when I would meet them.  The suitors.  They thought I was too much to handle or not…not right, you know?  I was always kind of glad, or I told myself I was, even if Mom and Dad…worried,” Tony trailed off, picking non-existent lint off his pants.  “Then I had a Heat, and I think they panicked because no Alpha.  Obie—he’s our CEO, remember?  He offered to, you know. With that.  But my parents didn’t want to, because some Alphas, it’s—they want, with someone who hasn’t—so, more options, I guess,” Tony stopped, catching Steve’s look.  “You’re not going to throw our CEO off a cliff, are you?”
is what a mountain view looks like,” Tony said sarcastically as he walked up to stand slightly behind Steve, who seemed uninterested in obeying the spirit of sign number two and was way too close to the railing for Tony’s comfort.  “Seems a bit off the tourist route,” Tony observed, shoving his hands in his pockets and looking from one side to the other. “Kinda nice, though.  Quiet.  In a…completely different way than the place we live is quiet.”
Look at me.
“I don’t know. I didn’t, not like this. But, this…I mean, God. Just--what if…”Bruce started. “Bear with me here, but…if you were meant to be together, all of this with Steve and the serum and the ice…maybe…maybe the Bond formed, but you weren’t born yet, so there’s no mark to give Steve, and since he doesn’t have one, you can’t, so…I don’t—I mean, it’s
By the time they made it down to the kitchen, Natasha and Clint were already at the table, burning through the crepes and French toast Tony had made. Ordered. Paid for, whatever. They both glanced up when Tony walked into the room, Steve following closely on his heels.
Steve could feel a grimace forming and let out a sigh, scratching at his forehead to give himself a moment to look away from Natasha’s knowing gaze.
now, and close.  Closer.
“Oh.  Oh, Tony,” Steve breathed out as he worked his hand up and down Tony’s cock, spreading the pre-cum around to ease the friction.
Steve blinked at the shafts of light that cut through the canopy of trees as they walked, and dropped his gaze to Tony’s back.  There was noise all around them, drowning out their conversation, which Steve suspected was not mere happenstance. Creatures skittered, the wind shook through the trees, and leaves crunched under their feet as they meandered through Lord Ellis’ forest.  Peaceful, Steve thought. It felt like they were leagues away from civilization, though Ellis’ massive keep wasn’t actually that far from here. Nor were they truly alone. If he cared to look, he knew he would see Tony’s guards surrounding them on foot and horseback, keeping a respectful distance.
“Figured you’d say yes to at least one of these,” Steve said softly.
“You’re incorrigible,” Steve told him.  He reached out and stroked his thumb across Tony’s cheek.  “Incredible.” Tony opened his mouth as if to say something, then closed it, blinking up at Steve instead with eyes suddenly awash with something a lot different than the humor and innuendo that had been there a moment ago.
? How…unanticipated,” Tony said drolly.   Matt was being cagey as fuck and Barnes was right, he was far too confident, which meant he was up to something.  Probably something he didn’t exactly want Tony to know about.  At least not the details.  Tony suspected the words “plausible deniability” were stamped on the front of Matt’s brain.
“The big gun? Consider it done,” Rhodey agreed.
“Do we?” Tony asked, his voice weary and heavy.  “Do we really need to talk, Steve?  What do you have to say that I could possibly want to hear?”
“I mean, you look nice.  With the—the tie and suit and all,” Steve stammered.  “The different suit.  Than the one from earlier.”
“What?  That’s…I mean, Tony wouldn’t…he’s nothing like…that” Steve stammered.
“Please.  Please, I need, nguh, Tony,
The moon nearly covered the sun.
“Better,” Steve replied, pulling Tony closer. He brought his hands up, one still bound with Tony’s, and cupped Tony’s face in his hands.  Tony’s own hands covered Steve’s, holding him there.  Steve glanced around him at the soldiers, the pile of stones in the distance, his friends and family surrounding him, and Tony.  Tony, most of all.   Tony, who made it true.
of, though.  I’m sure your lance will be just fine the next time you need to, er, put it to use.”
“Um…yes.  Please?”  Steve said, laughing.  The shower was amazing.  He didn’t want to leave, but felt it would probably look bad if he spent too much time in here after…well, after.  Stepping out and grabbing a large, incredibly soft towel from the shelf, he dried off and started to reach for his clothes.  Then stopped himself.  Tony liked looking at him, he thought.  Tony liked looking at him a lot.  Tony was probably out in the bedroom now, most likely dressed and waiting for Steve to leave so he could go to bed or do whatever it was that he did at night.  Steve realized that he didn’t want this to be the last time he saw Tony.  He wanted Tony to ask him to come back.  Without letting himself think anymore on it, he wrapped the towel around his hips and picked up his pile of clothes.  Walking out to the bedroom, he put the pile of clothes on the bed and dropped the towel to the floor.  He couldn’t bring himself to look up, but he knew without a doubt Tony was watching him.  He hoped his hands didn’t shake too much as he dressed.  Thankfully, the buttons on his shirt were bigger than the buttons on the dress shirt last night.  He didn’t think he could have managed that.  When he was finished, he headed out the bedroom doors, sparing only a glance about the room as he left. But it was enough.
“No, no, he’s, ah. He’s right here, actually,” Steve was saying.  He mouthed ‘Bucky’ at Tony.   “Well, either I’m being kidnapped or we’re having dinner.  Either way, send help,” Steve said with a low chuckle.
“Slowly,” Steve warned, though Tony ignored him, of course, and ended up spluttering around the water, coughing against the back of his hand as he tried to swallow.  “Alright,” Steve said, after Tony caught his breath.  He nodded at Tony’s hip and uncapped the syringe.  “Ready?”  Tony just eyed him steadily as Steve pulled down the undersuit enough to plunge the shot into Tony’s hip. It was probably a mark of just how much pain Tony was in that he didn’t make some kind of innuendo, Steve thought, as Tony stiffened at the jolt.
“Not high. Not where it would be—shit.  Ice.  I should’ve thought of that. Ah, well, note to self.  Anyway, just a quick spin, nothing fancy,” Tony offered.  “Then, we could…doctors said it’s fine.  If you wanted.  I mean, we haven’t since…” he said, waving a hand in air.  “We could even—we could try again.  Not now, obviously.  But, one day.  I haven’t had a Heat up here since, well.  In a long time.  Could be, you know.  Kind of nice. I’m already a bit off-cycle with the tests and the timezones and all that, so…”
“Judge?  Judge says bullshit,” Tony replied smoothly.  “Take your time.  I think Bachelorette Number 3 is probably going to hurl her tiara at you if we don’t hurry, but I got all night.”
“You’re not wrong,” Steve told him.
“Are you sure? We don’t have to do this,” Steve pointed out, leaning down to whisper the words into Tony’s ear.
The rest of the journey faded together into a long, slow haze.  He knew they passed through villages, past large swaths of fertile farms, then towns and even small cities that dotted the region along the river.  In the distance, he could sometimes see the larger keeps that formed the outer defenses, held by lesser Lords and vassals.  They got bigger as the days passed, looming large on the tops of mountains and along the river where massive stone towers spanned the breadth of it and churned water through giant wheels that whirred and rushed as they turned.  They were going to the capital, Steve knew.  The Lord mentioned the low road, and even Steve knew what that was, the long road that ducked and twisted along the shores of the capital, where the ships came in with their goods and the sailors came in looking for ways to spend their pay.  You could buy anything and anyone there, it was said.  To hear the other slaves talk, no depravity was unknown on the low road.
certainly wasn’t calming, Tony thought, almost snorting before he caught himself.
is shoved in a box.  You have to try.”
He tried to think back to the last thing he’d said to Steve, but it was blurred by too many years of trying not to think of it.  He’d like to think it had been biting, caustic, something to turn around dramatically and slam the door on, brilliantly final words that could prop up the shred of dignity he’d been able to muster at that point.  He suspected it was none of those, and that was why he couldn’t quite muster the memory.
“Yay!” Tony shouted gleefully, then signaled up to the jet. A door opened in the back and the armor headed for him. “Be right back, Snack-size, don’t go anywhere!”
“Ah,” Rhodey said, mouth flattening into a thin line.  “Tony, you’re sick.  Everyone gets sick.  Everyone misses class.  It doesn’t make you weak, and anyone who thinks otherwise is an idiot.”
Tony, of course, didn’t want anything like that, not from Steve, anyway. He wanted his garage and his privacy and his pills, and so Steve would make sure he had that, because that was--that was the thing he could do today.  That, and just buy the damn things on the list.  Come on, soldier, Steve told himself, a breath of frustration leaking out.
“I could take you flying.  If you wanted,” Tony blurted out.
“Is Tony excited for MIT?” Peggy asked, drawing Steve’s wandering mind back to the screen.  “I didn’t get a chance to talk to him at the party last night.”
Tony, to Steve’s surprise, didn’t rise to the bait, and actually flushed a bit and demurred with a dismissive shrug and flat-voiced, “Nothing much, really.  Just the…uh…the armor.  And stuff.”  Okay, then.  Tony not wanting to share was definitely different.  Steve wondered if Tony’s reticence was payback for being ignored the past week, but quickly dismissed the idea.  The man had many faults, but he wasn’t petty.  Tony poked at his food, leaving silence between them.
“Of course, Sir,” JARVIS replied.  The screen flickered and the image from Pepper’s phone popped up.  Tony lifted his head and chewed on his lip for a moment as he stared at the screen.  Well.  It wasn’t like he wasn’t going to admit to having a
“I know,” Natasha replied, running a soothing hand through the top of Tony’s hair.  “You’re no help to him if you pass out, Tony.”
“Wait for wh—“ Tony broke off as the door behind them opened and four Hydra goons plowed through, guns drawn and pointed at Steve and Tony. Tony stepped forward and put his hands in the air, placing himself in the line of fire in front of Steve.
“Come on,” Tony said, tugging at Steve’s sleeve just below the shoulder.  “We can look at the Cezannes and you can tell me why these paintings of fruit bowls are vastly different from the one we have in the kitchen.”
Sam made a noncommittal grunt and went back to the one, slim window in the bedchamber Steve had been given to use before the ceremony, glancing up and down the street out of habit.
“That true, boy?” Phillips asked.  Steve, who looked a bit like a deer in headlights, opened his mouth, then closed it and gave Tony a helpless look, trying to cover his laugh with his hand.  Phillips’ gaze finally settled on Tony, giving him a once over. “Good. ’Bout time. That seat’s taken,” Phillips said, turning around to stare at Barnes.
Like the time the broken axle on the wagon was replaced overnight, and they hadn’t had to sell their last cow, who was old and didn’t produce much milk these days, but had been there as long as Steve could remember.  Or when the village’s harvest somehow doubled in the storehouses just before that terrible winter set in.  Or best, though Steve hadn’t actually been around for it himself--he just liked the story, even though he suspected that the old folks who did remember it were maybe stretching the truth a bit--when a whole army came right up to the borders of their valley, made their camp and then were just gone the next morning.  All of them.  Gone.  Not the horses or the armor or the wagons or even the tents and cooking pots, some of which supposedly still had stew in them.  Just the soldiers.  Completely gone.
He had literally no idea what to do with that information.  It just sat there, at the front of his brain, waiting for a ticket to ride.
to it,” Tony said.  “Nothing that can’t be rationally explained, but...our perception of time seems to work differently here.  You may notice when we return that it might seem as if no time has passed or our guards may be frantically searching for us, which given how nervous this place makes them, I’m betting on the latter.   Or, perhaps nothing will seem amiss at all. And, supposedly, people have disappeared. Which happens in these forests, you can get turned around in no time. But, the really interesting stories are about the ones who
Tony leaned back in the chair, scooting himself down until he could rest his head on the curved back, staring at the recessed lights in the ceiling until a bright spot appeared in his vision.  “It wasn’t just angry sex.  Not after that first time.  Maybe not even then.  I don’t know what it was.  But, it wasn’t that.”
“To set his mind at ease,” Josiah nodded formally.
Steve thought for a moment. His own patch of dirt paled next to the wonders they had seen on this journey, and yet… “It’s beautiful,” Steve told him. “The part where I’m from, it’s got hills and streams and lots of farms,” he said, warming to the topic. “The earth is rich there. My mother would say that you could bury a table and it would grow chairs. There are mountains not too far away. And the sea. I know, it doesn’t sound particularly impressive,” he acknowledged, “but it’s the people, I guess, really. All these people who came looking for something better, and we’re trying—it’s not perfect, not even close—but we’re trying to make something… something better than just the sum of each of us, I suppose.”
“Sorry, got caught up.  Habit,” Daniel said hurriedly and the camera dropped in a rush, showing the floor, with its homey faux wood and lines of cables and wires.  “I’ll edit it later.”
It felt like a young thought, some distant flash of memory from childhood, folded over with the slightly embarrassing feeling you got when you remembered thinking maybe you could live in a boxcar or go through a magic wardrobe even though you knew it wasn’t real.  You knew, but the line between real and not-real was still thin enough to have it feel like believing wasn’t so lost.
“Steve, God, yes,
“You already wore that one last week,” Bucky said, barely glancing from the video game he and Clint were currently engrossed in long enough to eye Steve’s third shirt option.
Tony let out a low, long, and very satisfied-sounding groan.  “Holy
“Good.  Okay.  Good,” Cam said, picking a bit off the top of the bread, though not eating it, just rolling it around between his fingers.  “I’m scared.”
He watched the star.
“Working on it,” Tony argued in a smooth, placating whisper.  “Wow.  Double date with Nat and Barnes….and Rhodey.  Just like old times.”
What the hell did he even mean, that Tony had been right? Obviously, probably true, but about what? What was so damn important that he needed to write about it from a world away, at a time when Steve was clearly struggling and scared, and dammit all to hell, there was an image to keep Tony up nights.
“Ah,” Steve replied with a slight quirk of his mouth. “Is he—“ Steve started, then stopped as everyone not currently holding a giant animal by thin straps of leather dropped to one knee with murmurs of “Your Grace” as they bowed their heads.
Steve felt an embarrassed rush of heat creep up his neck and cheeks, followed by a rush of calm relief. Tony knew him. Understood him. Sometimes, maybe better than Steve understood himself. He would know what Steve needed. And Steve needed this. Wanted it. Whatever questions he had about why fled his mind as soon as Tony entered the tent. He just knew it would be alright. Tony would take care of him. He could almost feel the doubt, the shame, the questions all fall away as he looked up at Tony.
“I asked you not to,” Steve reminded him.
“Yeah, well. This is a bit more than a battle scar,” Tony told him with a tight grimace.  He looked down and then made short work of the top few buttons of his shirt, pulling it apart with an almost brutal quickness, like he just wanted to get it over with.
“Go!” Tony hissed, turning to look at Steve, before quickly bowing his head again, but it was too late. Tyber had heard him speak the word of the Others.  He expected it, braced himself, but it still hurt when Tyber grabbed him by the hair and shook him so hard he thought he would come apart. His medicine bag slipped off his shoulder and landed in his lap.  My bag, he thought, just as Tyber’s fist smashed against his jaw. He flew sideways, sprawling on the ground. Someone shouted. His ears were ringing too much to hear what it was. His medicine bag landed next to him, the contents spilling onto the ground.  All his pouches, with their carefully done knots so he would know what was in them by sight and touch, emptied onto the ground.
“So, was it as good for you as it was for me, is that what you’re trying to say, or--wow, okay, wow.  Gift that keeps on giving, huh?” Tony’s mind blanked as he felt the alien’s finger stroke over the crease in his ass, just behind his hole, pressing lightly. A whir of sensation raced through him.  Heat thrummed low in his belly, then surged down the length of his cock, pooling at the head. The alien’s face was tight with apparent concentration, though his mouth was open in a soft, wondrous look, his focus on Tony’s face as he rubbed at the delicate skin there.
“Tony, it’s important.  What you’re doing for them.  Amazing.  You should be proud,” Steve said, shaking his head at the brittle tone under the words.
“You really didn’t know it would be me, huh?” Stark asked as he slipped the phone back into the pocket of his jacket.
“I’ll give you a key,” Steve offered.
“Steve’s the tactician,” Clint responded, then caught Tony’s glare.  “Look, we can’t just stroll down to the doc-in-a-box to let someone look at him.   Let Bruce take a look.  See what Cho says.  Thor will do whatever it is he does on Asgard when Loki does his shtick.  Right now, that’s all we can do.”
“I thought the creature far more discerning than you credit it,” Thor remarked lightly.
A young boy held out a small bouquet of wildflowers for him, which Cam took and replaced with a coin from the purse at his waist and made the boy grin with delight.  Emboldened, more children followed suit with eager, outstretched arms full of fresh-picked flowers they held out in offering as Steve swept past the parted crowd and into the inn.
“I am not going to die in someone’s low-rent X-files fantasy,” Tony muttered in the strange sun’s general direction.  He grimaced, laid his head back, and tried to calm his rioting nerves. His heart was beating way too fast. He knew from experience that accelerated the palladium, not that it had kept him from doing things that made his heart rate shoot up, but still, couldn’t be a good thing.  That’s right, Tony thought with a derisive snort, the real problem here is my heart condition. He needed to calm down and
Not some guy, his mind supplied unhelpfully.
“What--what is this?” Tony demanded, though he could hear the tightness in his voice, the way his throat clicked around the words.  He didn’t mean it to sound like an accusation.  Or a plea.  A spike of embarrassed hurt knifed through his chest as he stared at the sender’s address envelope.  This was a joke. This was someone’s idea of a joke, and it hurt.  It hurt way more than it should.
“Yeah, I’ll bet he’s just crying into his billions,” Brock shot back. Steve could hear the sneer in his voice, but chose to ignore it.
“Ah,” Tony coughed, like his throat had gone dry.  “Are you—“ he swallowed, “Are you sure?”
Understanding the motivation didn't exactly take the sting away, that much was true enough. A trip to Best Buy being more interesting than a lifetime with Tony was probably always going to leave a bitter taste in his mouth, but he could, at least, see how it must have been for Steve.
“I would never make things up just so you would stop being stupid,” Cam protested, side-eyeing Steve from his place on the bed.  “He misses you.  He would welcome you back to his bed, you know this.”
Tony was staring up at him, mouth opening and closing like he wanted to say more, though he didn’t, just spread the chain apart and let Steve’s dog tags fall over his head where they hung down to the center of his chest.  Steve tried to swallow. He watched Tony wrap one hand around them, holding them there in his fist. It was almost like his own skin was heating up like the metal inside Tony’s hand. Close enough, close enough. The thought was warm and candle-bright, flickering across his mind like a chant.
“What?  What are you talking about?  Because he asked me to come back, all of a sudden you think he has feelings…that…that makes no sense,” Steve said, shaking his head.
His attitude about the wolf had changed a lot since Tony came across the cub injured and near death a few days after they left the camp where they wintered after their harrowing departure from Clan country on the heels of dark looks and a stilted, awkward atmosphere that seemed like a branch being pulled at both ends, ready to snap. Tony was glad to go, even if it meant a long, fraught journey back to Steve’s people.
“You don’t have to order fishing gear just because I mentioned going fishing, Tony,” Steve continued after a moment.  “I know it isn’t your thing.  We can do something else, if you want. A movie or--or you could tell me about your stars, or…” he trailed off.  “Or you could work in your garage some more.  Whatever you want.”
“You would just follow me,” Steve said, remembering Bucky’s words. A smile started to curve his mouth at that, what had once seemed impossibly absurd having the air of the inevitable now. Tony would do it, too, Steve thought with a surge of fondness. But, he shouldn’t have to follow. He would let Steve lead, but he would always see the world from a vantage Steve knew he could not. I will walk the path, Steve though, but Tony was made to fly above the world, and you can only truly see where you are going when you have both.
Tony was quiet then, and Steve could almost feel the other man’s muscles going liquid as the morphine took effect.  Tony slumped a bit against Steve’s chest, like he’d been trying to hold himself up a bit and finally gave up.  “Anything,” Tony said, and it took Steve a minute to catch the thread of conversation.  “You could say anything, and it would be fine.  If you just, you know.  Wanted to talk.  Or something.”
“So,” Tony began after the limo had pulled away from the hotel and maneuvered into traffic, “when we get back to the hotel—our hotel.  Our other hotel. Uh. Anyway, when we get back, there’s something I want to talk to you about. Rhodey—I think Rhodey, he, ah, he has something…he probably wants to talk, too.”
“It’s nice to have the team together.  I’ve been looking at some of the reports from the last couple of years.  We seem to have…difficulties…on our own,” Steve observed, seemingly oblivious to Tony’s discomfort.
“Do you guys…I mean, this is going to sound crazy, but…do you guys think that…this…” he waved his hand vaguely at the nearly empty construction site, “has something to do with Tony?”
“I’m naked and doing what you want, what’s not to love?” Kirk shot back.
“Whatever it is that’s needed.  I want to hear it. Come on, you two have seen this first hand, and I know Rhodey wants in on the action, so go.  Let’s hear it,” Tony replied. Steve glanced over at Bucky, who shrugged slightly, then took a swig of his beer and wiped his mouth with his good hand.
The murmurs stopped.
“Nah, not me.  But, it happens, sure,” Kirk said.  “Well, one time, this guy did get a little in my face, you know, but, I have…security measures.”
to. He wanted to, and that was...such a strange thought, he realized, turning it over a bit in his head.  He wanted the man’s help, that was all, of course, he did.  Why wouldn’t he?  The man was offering to help, and you shouldn’t just reject a kindness, should you?
“You do, indeed,” Steve agreed with a grin.  A table in the center of the room was set with food.  Steve’s stomach rumbled, as if awakening from a deep sleep, and he realized he was, in fact, starving.  He used the privy and took a quick splash bath from the basin of warm water Cam had helpfully provided, then wrapped a simple cotton robe around himself.  He and Cam rushed through the meal, though Cam still managed to use more words during the course of it to discuss their impending adventure than Steve had probably uttered in a month’s time.  When they were done, Cam rang one of the bells to have the table cleared, and set about placing items on the bed for Steve.
“No idea what you’re talking about,” Tony replied carefully, because the thing was…yeah,
“Something like that,” Tony agreed, mimicking Steve’s words, as he let his hand fall back to his side.
be doing, and—”
His therapist had a term for how his mind went from socks to this point, he remembered with a flat grimace.  He didn’t know what she would call the pattern that got him from cartoon robots to finally drawing something real for the first time since he got back, but he had.  At least, he started.  He thought maybe he could finish. He could give it to Tony.  Maybe.  It probably wouldn’t be good enough, but he told himself he would draw it for Tony, and that made it easier to do, somehow.
“That,” Tony said, yawning again as he gathered the comforter around him and slid off the bed next to Steve in a heap of white down.  “Is not how this works anymore.”
“I hope so,” Steve agreed, leaning back against the sofa.  “Are you sure, though?”
“Steve—“ Bucky started, then let out a startled oomph as Steve barreled into him, wrapping his arms around his friend and hugging him close. Steve squelched his eyes shut, aware of Tony watching them, but couldn’t quite keep the choked off sob inside.  “Ah, Stevie,” Bucky said, patting his hands against Steve’s back.
“I’m here. I’m not—I’m not going anywhere.  I’m right here, Steve,” Tony soothed.  “Everything’s fine. Docs say I check out.  Nothing to worry about.  Hey, you always said I was practically part robot, now it’s kinda true. Bit like your Metropolis girl, huh?”
“Whatever they called themselves has been lost to time.  They worshipped the stone gods, and the Deep Illum was a sacred place, or so the stories go,” Tony replied.  “There was a stone circle there, inside the mouth. Lost to a cave-in several centuries ago. I think the miners were rather happy to see the last of it, to tell you the truth. The old Lord Rand, he used to tell stories he heard at his grandmother’s knee about all manner of strange happenings in the tunnels.”
“You’ll live,” Bruce commented dryly.  “We found your shield, by the way,” he told Steve.
“So...nanotech on steroids, then,” Tony said, scratching at his chin as the implications ran through his head.
Naturally, he’d managed to nick a couple spots on his face, but he pulled off small dots of toilet paper and stuck them to the drops of blood that welled up.  The ‘naturally’ part of that was mentally added when he pulled open the bathroom door and found Steve standing there with one fisted hand raised mid-knocking motion.
Steve cleared his throat, unsure what he was supposed to do now that he was here.  He’d spent all afternoon thinking about this and now that he was standing here…he was at a loss.  He shifted back and forth on his feet nervously.  Seeing Tony again sent flashes of last night through his mind, the things he’d felt, the things he’d done.  He felt an embarrassed flush warm his cheeks.  God knows what Tony must think of him, rushing back here a mere few hours after leaving last night.  Should he take off his clothes, like last night?  He wasn’t sure if that was expected now.  It was still light out, the big windows affording a gorgeous view of the sunset.  Any other time and it would have made his fingers itch to sketch it, but now, now he felt exposed by all that glass and light without the cover of darkness to offer any sense of privacy.  But, he’d come here.  This was the deal.  He knew that, and he’d still come, so now was not the time to decide to be a prude about it.
“It was Stane.  God, Tony, how can you be so--It was Stane, and he’s going to try again. He won’t use Mac.  It’ll be someone else, but he’ll try,” Steve replied, hearing the frustration in his own voice.  They’d had this argument so many times, he felt like it was on loop, like if he could just find a cassette recorder, he could push play and go to sleep.  “Look, you have to careful.  We’ve been over this, Tony.  Why can’t you just admit—“
He thought of Fury putting the shield into his hands and asking him to inspire men to die in a war they would lose.
Tyber, to his credit, ground to an abrupt halt. So did everyone else.  They knew what this could do. Before his banishment, Jhrvis had insisted he demonstrate his skill with it.  He had thought, at the time, it was done to shame him, but now, he thought maybe Jhrvis understood a lot more than Anto had ever imagined.
She cleared her throat and walked over to the dining room table, laying a black clothes bag over the back of the end chair.  “I took the liberty of getting you something to wear back to your hotel.  I’ll handle your suit from last night.  I’ve also ordered room service for you.  It should be up shortly.  I wasn’t sure what you liked, so I just got a bit of everything.  If you want anything else, just ask.  The suite is yours until about two, so feel free to stay and enjoy.  When you’re ready, just dial the concierge button on the phone, and they’ll ring Happy to bring the car around for you.”
“JARVIS!  If Cap said it like that, I want a recording,” Tony called out, glancing around.
There was sadness there.  Regret.  Something deeper that Tony couldn’t quite place.  You chose the one they burned, Tony thought, then hated how it sounded almost like an accusation.
He shouldn’t have said anything.  What had he been thinking?  Tony was the King, of course he wasn’t going to fall in love with his concubine, no matter the fanciful terms of endearment he liked to use.  That was for…what they did in here.  It wasn’t real.  Steve knew that, and yet, last night, he had been so happy, bound and chained, yet free, somehow, as if each chain that held him was keeping some tidal force at bay.  All the worries, all the reasons why not, everything that stood between them seemed to fade away in that moment, and it was completely clear to him. He loved Tony.  No matter what came to pass, that much was true.  It wasn’t a lie, and he didn’t want it to be a secret.  He wanted to share it, shout it, paint it, sculpt it into being, let it leave some mark on the world long after all of this was over, that he had loved Tony, and been loved by him.  Let them at least have that.  Of course, Steve should have known that was not to be.  He shook his head, trying to clear it.  Tony had asked him a question.
Steve performed the same ritual over the rest of Tony’s limbs, then over his chest, carefully running the heated cloth around the reactor and tracing it over the spider-webbing of scars that marred Tony’s chest. He could feel the hitch in Tony’s breaths as he went, the heated weight of his gaze as he watched Steve go about his ministrations. Tony rolled over to let him cleanse his back, working his fingers deep into the muscles until they felt soft and languid under his hands. Tony shifted over again, and Steve took the last cloth to wipe gently over Tony’s face, over his lips and eyes and down his neck until he was clean and relaxed.
“More what?” Steve pressed, leaning forward a bit in his seat, a furrow forming in the center of his brow.
“It was a long time ago,” Steve found himself saying with a grim sort of morbid humor dancing around the words in his head.
Steve frowned in confusion.  “I told you that I did, I--”
“Oh, and remember how I said TMZ has the marriage certificate?  Well, now they have an Elvis impersonator who claims to have been serenaded you two as you walked down the aisle,” Ms. Potts finished, ignoring the interjection.  “Who knows what they’ll dig up next.”
“Can you believe all this?” the man asked, not looking up or, seemingly, expecting an answer. “First, actual Nazis, hiding right there in plain sight. Now all this,” he frowned down at his phone screen. “Apparently, the government was behind the Hulk. No shocker there. Still, I mean… Jesus,
Something about the way he said it didn’t particularly inspire confidence that it wasn’t going to end up in the nearest trash can, but there wasn’t much of a choice.  If he just mailed it, it was probably less likely to actually make it to Tony.  Someone like him probably got tons of actual fan mail.  And weird people leaving proposals, suggestions, threats, and all kinds of things for him at the front desk, Steve thought with a sigh.  Of course there was a system.
“Do you?” Rhodes asked sharply.  “Really? Your Free States are how old?  Not yet a full generation behind you, and how well did you fare when Schmidt’s armies attacked, and all you had was a bunch of farmers?  No standing army, no navy, no stores,
“Hey, guys, maybe we call it night, huh?” Brock said soothingly over Steve’s shoulder, putting a hand on Steve’ lower back to steer him towards the table.
“Workshop,” Clint responded.  “Been down there all day.”
“Use your words, Steven,” Tony admonished lightly, a teasing grin forming as he reached for the last onion ring.
He had known it when he was boy, paging through the faded issues of propaganda comics. He had known it when he papered his walls with images of Captain America and called it a sanctuary. He had known it when he watched those old movie reels and let them comfort him, soothe his pain and make him feel worthy, even if just for a little while.
It means…it means he was coming home.  To me.  It means when he thought about me, he thought about coming home to me.  Whatever else I am, I’m home. And that was…that could be enough, right?  It could.  It was a lot more then he’d ever thought he’d have.
Tony wasn’t sure what woke him.  He must have fallen asleep on Steve’s loveseat, he realized with a start.  There was a spring pushing its way through the thin fabric like it was trying to get frisky with him without so much as buying him dinner first.  The room was quiet, except for the hiss of the radiator.
“Oh, yeah, no problem,” Tony replied quickly to cover the disappointment that welled up in him.  Something had opened there for a moment, and then slammed shut again, and he didn’t have the first clue why, except the feeling that he’d said something wrong.  Again.
“When you were four, you asked for a friend for your birthday.  Your mother arranged some kind of play date with the daughter of a friend.  The Van Dynes, I believe.  Cute little girl,” Jarvis remembered.
“Um, yeah.  Yes.  I mean, yes, I did, I am,” Steve managed to get out, and
“Don’t move!” they all shouted in unison.  Well, technically Hulk roared and hurled a watermelon into the piano, but whatever.  Steve got the point, going instantly on alert and looking around, probably for tripwires or lasers or something because he was quick-thinking like that, but really, he just needed to sit down.  Ooooh, Tony thought, grabbing a sofa cushion and tossing it to Steve, who caught it one handed.  Wow.  Pillows really did solve everything, he thought, shaking his head in satisfaction.
Steve brought one hand up and wrapped it around Tony’s wrist, then tipped his head down to where Tony’s hand curled into a fist around the dice.  Tony felt the barest brush of Steve’s lips over his knuckle, then a pulse of warm breath across his skin, and who knew the knuckles were erogenous zones?  Tony felt the hairs on the back of his neck bristle, his whole body seeming to contract, then loosen, almost too loose, like he was being liquefied part by part, admittedly, starting somewhere in his groin.  Steve was looking down at him through truly ungodly long lashes, and what had been a joke, because he could, because this was the kind of thing he did, teased and talked and made it a game because that way there was some distance, had become something else entirely, though damned if Tony knew exactly what.
. Wrong in a different way that the thing that happened back at his house had been, though he couldn’t say why.
Steve hummed his agreement and leaned in for a somewhat chaste kiss.  It was nice, though. Tony was warm and solid, and the din of voices in his head was muted the longer Steve was with him.  “Let’s go back to the room and make out,” Tony suggested.
“You are truly beautiful like this,” Tony murmured.  “Beautiful always, but this…this is gift you gave to me, do not think I do not know it, my treasure. And you are all the more beautiful for it,” he said, finishing the last with a hum, before he popped the clamp apart and let it fall away from Steve’s nipple.  A sharp gasp escaped Steve, and his hips jolted, canting up trying to find some answer to the sudden sensation.  Prickling jets of pain shot through Steve, deep down in his stomach and the head of his cock, which twitched and went even more rigid.  Then, Tony’s mouth, hot and wet, was around his nipple, sucking lightly, long laving over the taut peak.
Turning, he checked the road behind him, fear snaking down his spine and settling cold into his stomach, making the mix of blood and bile sour.  He could have sworn that he heard footsteps right behind him, getting closer, the crunch of leaves under heavier feet than his own, the snap of branches where someone crashed through them, but now, there was nothing. The road was empty.  Quiet, though it did little to calm his rattling heartbeat.  He spat again, coughing a bit and trying to catch his breath as his gaze darted across the road, toward the forest, then behind him--up, toward the mountains, where a harvest moon hung low and bright. He stared at the twin peaks for a long moment, some of the terror that had driven him into the night slowly ebbing as he watched thin, gray wisps of clouds drift by.
“Then I suppose I should be grateful that we have the world we do,” Tony replied in a dull, flat voice.
“There’s…there’s no subletting,” Steve answered.  Which, Tony thought, was about the most Steve thing possible to say, so he grinned and pulled out his phone, hitting the first contact on the list.
“It wasn’t as simple as you expected,” Steve guessed.
“I didn’t mind,” Nat said with a small shrug.
Tony had just stared at him, then shook his head and scrubbed his hands through his hair leaving it in that ridiculous state of disarray that Steve liked.
“It’s beautiful here,” Natasha said as she trotted her mount up to sidle along next to Steve’s.
Anto privately thought the Stranger’s eyes were beautiful.  He would never have imagined a person having eyes the color of the sky when the sun was at its peak and all the clouds had drifted away.  All the clan eyes were brown, like his. Not exactly like his, of course. His eyes were weak, too. Sometimes, they leaked water. No one else had eyes that did this.  No matter what medicine his mother gave him or how hard he tried to stop it, his eyes refused to completely heal. She said they probably never would, but they served him well enough, so he would have to make do.  The Stranger’s eyes leaked, too. Sometimes, when he slept, he called out for someone, and his eyes leaked water, just like Anto’s eyes did.
“Why does no one tell him, then?” Steve ground out in frustration.  “All these things that—he should know.”
“Best money I ever spent,” Tony said, clapping a hand on Rhodey’s shoulder and nudging him forward.  “Thanks for bringing dinner, by the way.  And inviting me.  Or, telling me about it, whatever,” Tony said to Nat and Barnes.  “Anything we can do to help?”
Steve huffed out a short, languid hum of a laugh, then looked over at Tony, who leaned around to capture his gaze.
“Maybe not.  But, that’s not the way people will see it. You know that, Cap.  Maybe it isn’t fair, but that’s the way people are,” Fury added.  “That’s just how it is.”
Tony shook his head, turning back to Bruce and starting to stroll through the forest again. “No, not really. Lord Rand mentioned something about it,” Tony replied, chewing on the inside of his cheek. “He suggested an alliance. His son’s of age, but that’s a bargain I would be on the short end of,” Tony said.
“Politics,” Tony interjected, slashing a hand through the air in front of him.  “That’s just…it’s politics, Steve.  It’s a good match. It doesn’t...mean anything.  It doesn’t have to
“I do mean it. Look at how you are with Cam. And with--with Peter,” Steve managed, the child’s name catching in his throat.
“Certainly not.  However, I will strongly urge you to do so,” Jarvis replied.  “Tony,” Jarvis said, reaching out a hand to grab Tony’s wrist as he brushed past.  “You see that you were rejected once, and I’ll not deny that your…arrangement with Captain Rogers is highly unusual.  But, if you wonder what acceptance looks like, you have only to look around you.  Perhaps it is not love.  Or, not the kind you are hoping for. Not yet, at any rate.  I shall leave you to judge that for yourself.  Though, I would wager it is a lot closer to it than you think.”
“Is that what we did, Jarvis?  All those years.  Figured it out?” Tony asked, craning his neck around to look at Jarvis a long moment before going back to studying the car.
“Looking good there, Boss,” Happy said as Tony slid into the backseat.
“I saw an ad in the paper about working down here. For Stark Trading.  Adventure on the High Seas, it said. Make your fortune. Bunch of---I mean, I knew it wasn’t like that, of course, but, I don’t know, I just--I couldn’t stay there any longer.  In New York. It was like I was suffocating. Bucky, my friend, he was in Andersonville prison and--we got him back, but--I just needed to not be there. Pretty damn selfish, huh?” Steve said, shaking his head.
The Ul kept his eyes on Tony as he sucked lightly on the pipe. His son, Steve saw, watched the exchange with wide, dark eyes darting between the two men. “It is fortunate, then, that our peoples share such a longstanding bond.”
By the time he caught up with Steve, his throat was raw from the cold air and his lungs hurt, but the twin bursts of strain did manage to drive away the crush of helplessness that had taken over while he was listening to Steve spew out his frustrations and fear.
“And what of your people outside the protections of the walls of a city or castle?” Steve demanded.  “Should their suffering not count towards your assessment of the risk of battle?”
“Well, God knows, his tutors certainly didn’t know what to do with him,” Maria huffed.
“Come for me, baby,” Steve said, tearing his mouth away long enough to plant the words into the soft skin of Tony’s ass with feather-light kisses.  One stroke.  Two, and Tony was coming in huge, jerking spurts of thick, white across the bed beneath him.  His vision whited out.  Spots danced behind his eyelids. Stars, he thought, somewhat crazily.  I see stars.  “There you go.  Look at you.  You’re so beautiful, Tony.  So beautiful.  You have no idea.”
that was good.  A second finger probed at his entrance and then was pressed slowly in, and he definitely felt the burn with that one as it stretched him open.  He hissed out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding as Tony moved his fingers around, hooking them deeper and then scissoring them in swift motions.  Steve let out a moan that was part pain, part need and then felt a third slick finger added, and okay that was less fun, but then Tony was moving them, pressing them deeper, stretching him wide and then a quick, sharp upward jab and Steve felt the breath leave him and his vision blacken and he was sure he shouted, but he had no idea what.
“That’s not what that says,” Steve corrected him, though he was smiling through it as the waiter set down a salad in front of him.
Bright lights hummed overhead, and shoppers veered around Steve, giving him a wide berth, though Steve suspected the haggard parents feeding snacks to children strapped carefully into the carts like birds delivering dinner to their young or the myriad people with their faces glued to their phones were barely aware of what they were doing. There were easily thirty types of soap lining the grocery store shelves.  More, if you counted what were called body washes, according to the brightly colored labels that promised some version of floral, tropical or vanilla scents. The future was sometimes a cacophony of choices, Steve thought.
“I hate you all,” Rhodey said, leaning over and putting his head in his hands.
“Your mind is more focused. Clear. At ease?” Tony continued, ticking off each description like he already knew the answer.  Steve frowned. Maybe he did.
“I don’t think Tony will care,” Steve said.  They sat there for a while, Bucky randomly scrolling through the hundreds of TV channels, most of which wanted to sell things to them, and ended up on an eerily fascinating commercial for some special kind of mop on mute.  “Do you remember him from Bagram?” Steve finally asked into the silence while the woman on the screen squeezed out the Super Mop to show just how much dirt and grime the thing had picked up.
“I know this is a lot to take in,” Tony started, choosing the words carefully.  His gaze was locked on Steve, but his eyes were soft. “You don’t have to process everything tonight. Bruce is going to give you some of his sleepy-time juice.  Just a small dose, but it should knock you out. If you want. It’ll help with the headaches.”
