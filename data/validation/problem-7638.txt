“Not to mention all the baby photos I need to see,” Rori joked, grinning widely at Anne as Harry complained about bullying.
“You didn’t really think that was all you were getting, did you?” Tony scoffed, already standing and pulling Rori to her feet. “Come along everyone, the gift is downstairs.”
A nurse had come in half an hour later to escort them to Aurora’s room and the rest of the team had headed home. Tony, Steve and Harry were slumped in uncomfortable plastic chairs at Aurora’s bedside when she finally awoke from the anaesthetic.
It was a sunny day in late October and Rori was on her way home from classes at Columbia. Since she had no reason to be in a hurry, she had opted to walk home through Central Park, which would take about an hour instead of the 20 minute subway ride she usually took to reach Avengers Tower. She had her sunglasses on, headphones in and music blasting as she strolled through the park. As she walked, her music cut out to be replaced by her ring tone, and instead of pulling her phone from her pocket, she raised her hand glancing at the screen of her StarkWatch. Her managers face displayed on the small device and she quickly answered the call.
“I love you, kiddo,” Tony sighed. “You know I’m just worried about you.”
“Yeah,” Liam sighed. “It feels wrong, but we’ve got to keep moving. We might never really know why he did it, but we’ve just got to work with what we’ve got now and try to make it work.”
“They’ll probably thank you,” Rori laughed. “They’re honestly the weirdest. They’re always trying to convince me to go to parties and be young or whatever. I mean they were troublemakers their whole lives and then they had this shy 16 year old land on their doorstep and they’re baffled by me.”
“Absolutely not,” Steve replied. “You’ve been looking forward to this summer for months now. Go enjoy yourself. You deserve to spend some time with Harry and to get out there and see the world. Besides we’re not gonna be home much.”
and they were working out the arrangement to add Aurora into the song.
Steve felt himself stiffen as she described the same scenes that have kept him from sleep for the past 2 weeks. In his nightmares he hears her begging for her life but by the time he reaches the library she’s bled out on the carpet and he holds her while he cries, unable to save one of the 2 most important people in his life. Now sitting in her room, holding her while she cried, his heart broke to know that she had just dreamt the same horrifying scene.
“I promise I will introduce you,” Rori told her best friend. “Just give me a month or two to get used to the idea myself. Trust me I’m just as overwhelmed by the idea as you are. I mean I’m kind of freaking out about tonight.”
“A likely story,” Tony laughed. “So, what’s the next one?” he asked, turning his attention away from Harry and back to his daughter.
Following the afterparty, Aurora ordered an Uber for Ella and then headed back to Harry’s place with him. As soon as they got inside, she kicked off her heels, leaving them in the entry hall and squealed when Harry scooped her up in his arms, carrying her upstairs to his bedroom. He set her back down on her feet once they made it into his room and attached his mouth to hers in a desperate kiss.
“Then what are you looking at?”
“Alright, we’ll let Harold finish his speech and then I’ll walk out there with you. Sound like a plan?”
“Yeah kid,” Sam sighed. “I’d be shocked if you didn’t have it after what happened. It’s nothing to be ashamed off, but it won’t help you if we ignore it.”
Once the jet finally touched down at the airport, Aurora took a cab to the stadium. Before she climbed out of the cab, she quickly pulled her long dark hair back in 2 braids, covering her eyes with a large pair of sunglasses and tugging a baseball cap down low over her brow. She joined the queue forming outside the venue, chatting with some of the fans already in line, smirking when none of them realised who she was at first. Eventually a few of those standing closest to her in the line recognised her but she shushed them and swore them to secrecy. “I just want to experience the show like any other fan,” she told them. “If you want, we can take some selfies together, but could you wait until tomorrow to post them?” They’d agreed and she had enjoyed spending the majority of the day chatting away with them while they waited. When the doors finally opened, Aurora ran with her new friends into the venue, staking out their position against the barricade next to the catwalk section of the stage about halfway along. Once the lights dimmed for the start of the show, Rori finally took off her baseball cap and pulled her hair out of the braids, combing her fingers through them and tossing her hair back over her shoulders.
“I always wanted a sibling to get up to mischief with,” Rori confessed. “He kind of feels like the big brother who’d buy booze for you and your friends when you’re underage.”
“Do you ever wish that’s what you got to do?” Aurora asked.
“It’s just a dream,” Tony soothed from behind her. “It’s not real. You’re safe. It’s just a dream.” His hand continued to rub along her spine, avoiding her injured shoulder as he tried to calm her panicked breathes. “We’ve got you. You’re ok.”
“You didn’t get there in time,” she whispered through her gasps for breath. “You were too late.”
“The assassin that just tried to kill you?” Aurora said with a shocked gasp. “Are you insane?”
She had spent the last 3 years writing, rewriting, practicing and perfecting this song and she knew it better than any other song she had ever performed before. It was the first song she had ever written, the one she had kept to herself for so long. It was so personal that it was only years after she had first composed the chorus that she had shared it with Mark, confessing that she had never even let the band hear it. It was this song that had convinced Mark, and in turn Aurora herself, that she should pursue a solo career. Aurora thought of her mother as she sang of her grief, the raw emotion evident to everyone listening, either in the audience in front of her or watching at home.
“Missed you too,” Rori replied, “and Pops.”
Harry felt that Malibu was the perfect place to spend the weekend, renting a beach house for the pair and Aurora spent the days lounging beside the pool and soaking up as much sun as she could. Given their usually hectic schedules, the young couple revelled in the free time. The opportunity to waste away hours by the pool, without the constant demands to be somewhere or do something was intoxicating. Harry was happy to set himself up on a banana lounge with a book and a glass of red wine, enjoying the relaxing sounds of the nearby waves and the view of his beautiful girlfriend laying nearby in a bikini. Likewise, Aurora was also enjoying the calming sound of the waves, and would cheekily request that Harry refill her drink, if only to watch him walking around in a pair of boardshorts slung low on his hips and nothing else. Before long, their mini vacation was at an end and Aurora headed back into the studio, spending three days filming the 2 covers and then helping with the beginnings of the editing process. After what felt like no time at all, the pair said goodbye to their new friends with promises to catch up again in the future before heading to LAX to fly up to Toronto for Harry to start the next leg of the bands tour. By the time they returned to the States on Monday, the two covers were posted on both Aurora’s channel and Our Last Nights, much to their fan’s excitement and praise.
“No one you know.”
“What’s got you grinning?” Harry asked, taking in the excitement lighting up her face.
“Aurora!” she cried, already rushing around the end of the bar. Rori pushed forward, the two women colliding in a hug as Tony and Steve finally walked through the door. While Rori and Helen continued to hug each other tightly, the men looked around the small pub, they had been there once before, the previous year and from what they could tell nothing had changed. Yellowed lights still hung from the low wood-panelled ceiling and rickety chairs and tables still filled the floorspace, while the same old patrons perched at the bar nursing their drinks. It was rundown and old, nothing like the types of places Tony usually found himself in, but Steve liked its charm and could easily picture a little Rori running around, dodging between the tables and getting up to mischief. The two women finally pulled apart from their hug as Helen’s husband Greg joined them. While Greg pulled Rori in for another warm hug, Helen turned to Steve and Tony. “It’s so good to see you two boys again,” she told them, already herding them towards a booth against the side wall. “Have a seat and we’ll get you something to eat. What would you like?”
“I saw this flyer at school,” she began to explain, “there’s a band looking for a singer and a keyboardist and I’m trying to decide if I should text them or not.”
“Go shower and get into something comfy,” Steve told the pair. “We’ll come get you when dinners ready.”
“Don’t be silly,” Aurora replied. “I’m getting so bored around here, it’s nice to have an unexpected visit. Besides, you know I always love seeing you Mark.”
“God, I love you,” Aurora replied, kissing Tony’s cheek and returning her head to lean against his chest, her cheek resting beside the Arc reactor again.
“I was trying to brush my hair,” she eventually whispered. “And I dropped the brush and it was so loud when it hit the floor that I just freaked out. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
“Well good luck with college and I know that I won’t be the only one eagerly watching to see what is next in your career,” Letterman said. “Thank you for joining me this evening Aurora and thank you as well to those watching at home.”
“Harry get away alright?” he asked to which Rori nodded, her face still pressed into the fabric below her. “You wanna watch a shitty movie and eat crap food that will make Steve disappointed in both of us?”
of June. The day of the first show, Aurora was sitting in the green room, waiting for the boys to come back from one of their many media obligations. She was drawing while she waited, periodically picking up her phone to see if any other critics had reviewed her show. It felt weird for her to not be there for the final two weeks, but she wanted to be there with Harry. She’d spent months looking forward to her chance to spend the summer with him and the boys and she knew she’d made the right choice to come on tour now given everything that had happened at the end of their last set of shows. Her art was in safe hands and she trusted Pepper to coordinate its safe return to the tower after the show came to an end, so she decided to put it aside in her head and focus her attention on being there on tour and present in the moment.
“I love you too. God, I don’t want to get on that plane,” Harry said. “I want to stay here with you and never leave again.”
“Of course,” Harry agreed, snuggling his head against her shoulder and Rori laughed deeply, always enjoying how clingy Harry was when he was drunk. She placed soft kisses along his hairline as he hummed, and Nick excused himself to go find someone to dance with him back out on the deck. “Couldn’t find you,” Harry murmured, “got worried about you.”
The day after they arrived in town, Tony and Steve headed off to see Peggy Carter at her nursing home, while Rori caught the tube out to Hampstead Heath for lunch with Harry. She had her beanie pulled low over her forehead and scarf wrapped up around her chin to ward off the cold weather and combined with her large sunglasses, she was left completely unrecognisable as she entered the small café. She spotted Harry already sitting at a table in the back corner and swiftly made a beeline for him through the tables. The place was fairly empty given that it was midday on a Thursday so there weren’t too many curious eyes watching when Rori removed her hat, scarf and sunglasses, smiling warmly as Harry stood to kiss her cheek and pull out her chair for her.
“I just got off the phone with our management and they think we should wait,” Harry said. “It’s just a twitter theory and it’ll probably blow over.”
“I’ve been thinking about what you said a few weeks ago about a solo album,” she said, jumping straight to the reason they’d organised to get together. “I don’t think I’m ready for that yet. I mean don’t get me wrong, the response to
“I don’t want to leave you alone when you need me most,” he admitted.
“Please don’t scare me like that again kiddo,” Tony begged, his own tears welling in his eyes as he gazed at his daughter. “We can’t lose you, ok?”
“It was so personal,” Rori admitted. “I knew I could never let anyone else sing it and before Dad’s wedding I’d never sung any of my original songs myself. I’d only ever done covers and I think I was just a bit scared of it. But then once I decided to sing,
True to his word, Tony did find Spider-Man and after showing up unannounced at Peter Parkers front door 2 days later, he invited the teenager to the tower.
“You look beautiful,” he told her softly, earning a beaming smile in return. “Car should be here soon.”
“I like it!” she agreed. “SkyFire.”
they all began to push forwards towards the stage, causing those against the barriers to become crushed against the metal. Louis noticed the problem moments before the nearest security guard, immediately signalling to the band to cut the music and drawing the security teams’ attention. “Is everyone alright down there?” he asked, his accent thickening with his concern for the fans. The other boys turned towards Louis trying to catch up to what was happening, and the moment Harry noticed that Louis was standing in front of Aurora’s section of the crowd he sprinted across the stage towards her, panic clear on his face. By the time he reached Louis’ side, the security guards had already managed to pull several of the girls over the barriers and Louis was instructing the fans behind to calm down and stop pressing forward. Rori quickly joined the few fans standing between the barriers and the stage and as soon as she was out of the crush she looked up to find Harry crouching down on the side of the stage in an attempt to get closer to her without leaving the stage and causing a bigger crush from the crowd. “Are you alright?” he yelled in concern, visibly relaxing when she nodded and smiled reassuringly back. He stayed kneeling at the edge of the stage until the situation had been sorted and just before Rori was ushered away to a different part of the crowd, Harry signalled to the guard by her side to wait. By the time he jumped down from the stage, a camera had already been tracking the situation and a large percentage of the crowd was already aware that the girl with the black hair was in fact Aurora Stark, so when Harry swept her into his arms the crowd around them erupted into screams with the confirmation of the rumours that the two were dating. He turned to the waiting guard as they pulled apart, insisting that he make sure she was taken backstage to watch the remainder of the show in safety before he quickly climbed back on to the stage.
“What’s with the shit eating grin?” Clint called out, throwing a pillow across the room, hitting Rori in the head. “You’re missing the movie.”
Rori frowned in confusion as she took in the lack of tree or decorations surrounding her and decided to go find Tony to uncover the reason. She found him, unsurprisingly, in his workshop.
“You know sometimes I’m really glad that you get all of this. I’m not sure how I’d deal with this otherwise.”
Unlike the previous night’s show, Aurora watched the second show from the side of stage with the rest of Harry’s family, dancing with Gemma to their favourite tracks. Following the show, Harry and Aurora headed back to the hotel with the rest of the boys and in the morning Rori joined the band as they travelled north for a midweek show in Edinburgh before heading to London for 3 shows at Wembley.
Harry didn’t realise he’d been holding his breath until he heard Steve say that Rori would be ok. He let the air rush out of his lungs as a sob burst from his lips. Steve placed a comforting hand on the younger man’s shoulder as he finally let out all the built up emotion that he’d been desperately holding back since he’d first seen the photo of Aurora ,unconscious and blood-drenched in her father’s arms. His sobs echoed around the room, filled with all the fear that had been building for hours and the relief that his worst nightmare had not become a reality.
“Obviously.”
As always, please leave a comment either here on AO3, or on the tumblr chapters, Instagram posts or send me a tumblr ask. I's really love to hear what you all think about this story.
“Third,” she mumbled.
They spent the next few days swimming in the ocean, reading or watching movies in the evenings and revelling in the opportunity to spend time alone together with nowhere to be or no one demanding their attention for one thing or another. On their last evening they were curled up on the porch swing, looking out over the moonlit waves, a blanket thrown over their laps to ward off the cool breeze blowing up off the ocean. Harry had a glass of wine in one hand, his other resting around Aurora’s shoulders as her head lay on his shoulder.
“The rest of that day was such a blur,” she explained. “Manhattan was in pieces and our home was trashed and so many people were dead.”
“And the test came back confirming you are his daughter,” David concluded after Rori paused in her story.
“I did,” she agreed, blushing as he leaned in to kiss her cheek.
Aurora took a shaky breath to calm her nerves, smiling more genuinely in response to his assurances. “Thank you,” she replied. “This is all just really strange to me still. Dad’s made a lot of effort to try to keep me out of the spotlight since people found out who I am last summer.”
“This going to have to be a duet,” Gary said, before sitting down with the lyrics and working out where to split the song between the two of them. In the end, Gary took the first verse and Aurora took the second, while they sang the chorus’s together, layering their voices together as the song built toward the final chorus, following the same arrangement they’d sang the first time round and then Aurora played out the final few notes on the piano. After practicing the arrangement a few times, they called it a day and agreed that when they came in the next day they would get in the technician to record the song in full since Aurora only had 2 more days left to work with the boys before she had to drive the 2 hours up to Cleveland to meet back up with Harry and the tour.
“Of course,” Tony replied instantly. Steve stepped up to stand behind Tony, wrapping his arms around the shorter man’s shoulders as the teenager approached the piano, taking a seat on the bench before lifting the fallboard and hovering her fingers over the ivory keys for a moment. Both men watched on in silent awe as Aurora closed her eyes and played. The music filled the large space, breathing life into the room and Steve began to sway to the tune, forcing Tony to move with him. Slowly the song morphed from one to the next as Aurora revelled in the freedom of playing again, and after a few simple pieces she forgot completely about her audience, beginning to sing.

“Yeah Me too,” Harry replied softly.
“It’s ok Rori,” Liam replied, smiling softly as he wrapped his arms around her. “We’ve got to be able to lean on each other, right?”

“I’m sorry babe,” Rori said, rubbing her hand up and down the length of his back. “I just got a bit cold, so I came inside to warm up.”
“Mind if I come in?”
“Hey kiddo,” Tony greeted once he answered the call.
The finalists performed first to open the show, then they went to an ad break and Ella immediately turned in her seat to face Aurora. “Thanks again for inviting me along Rori,” she said.
“Thank you but trust me, he made it easy for me.”
“God, I love you too,” Harry replied. “More than anything. I love you, you’re safe now. I won’t let anything else happen to you. I love you.”
“Are you ok?” the guy asked, offering his hand out to help Aurora off the ground. Before Aurora could even thank the man for saving her, she heard the unmistakable sound of repulsors charging up to fire.
“Ready to head out kiddo?” Louise asked her daughter once their giggles had died out.
Aurora reached for her StarkWatch on her wrist, scrolling through the menu to pull up the panic button Tony had shown her when he’d first designed the product, the same button she’d used the previous year the night that she’d almost been mugged in central park and first met Peter. She hit the button, knowing that JARVIS would alert any Avenger in the state. “J activate Eyes and Ears protocol,” she whispered, ensuring that the AI was now recording everything that the microphone picked up, while muting any and all notifications so as not to draw attention to herself. “Send the following alert to Avengers; There’s a shooter on campus. I’m in the library and they sound like they’re close to…”
“I guess it’s my turn to be embarrassed now?” Harry asked timidly, pulling her attention back to him.
“Oh no, you’re probably way too cool to be into them,” Rori chuckled. “And there’s this one guy in the band that I’ve got such a thing for.”
“We’ll go to her,” Tony replied, squeezing Steve’s hand in a silent request. Steve squeezed his shoulder in reply, leaning down to place a kiss on Tony’s temple. Of course, he would go with him to meet his daughter.
“I thought I recognized that laugh!” Louis shouted, jogging down the hallway towards the couple, wrapping his arms around Aurora’s waist and lifting her into the air. She laughed as he spun them around. “Missed you love.”
“There you are,” he cheered as he stumbled over to her and she could tell that while he wasn’t completely trashed yet, he was well on his way to drunk and she laughed when he fell onto her lap as he attempted to sit next to her. “Sorry love,” he drawled, sliding sideways, his leg still hoked over hers as he sat beside her, his arms wrapping around her waist, “The boats a bit rocky and I don’t think I’ve got my sea legs yet.”
“Aurora Louise Stark, I love you so much,” he began softly. “Loving you and being loved by you has made me the happiest and the luckiest man on earth. I’ve wanted to ask you this for so long now and I was waiting for us to be together again at Christmas to finally ask you, but things haven’t gone the way any of us expected. I spent 8 hours on a plane fearing that by the time I got here I’d be too late, and I just kept thinking that I couldn’t lose you. I couldn’t imagine my life without you, and I don’t ever want to find out what that would be like. I want to spend every minute of every day of the rest of our lives making sure you know how much I love you. Rori, will you marry me?”
over the course of a few days and after Gary sang the song through with Joe and Jay accompanying him on the guitar and bass, and Aurora playing the piano, all four of them were grinning from ear to ear with excitement.
“Recovery,” Rori echoed, nodding to herself at having a plan. “I can do that.”
“Nothing to be sorry about,” Sam replied, his voice still calm and slow. “We talked about how this might happen, remember? I’m guessing you didn’t mention it to Harry like I suggested given how freaked out he was when I got here.”
“Last year, the city was rocked by the Battle of New York, which of course was when we saw the creation of the Avengers. I’m curious as to what that situation was like from the inside.”
Harry stood up from where he’d been sitting beside Rori on her bed, kissing her on the temple before leaving the room and closing the door behind him, offering the pair some privacy for what was sure to be a difficult conversation. Aurora was propped up against the headboard with a mountain of pillows surrounding her and she gestured for Sam to take a seat on the bed beside her. He sat down near her knee and offered her a soft smile before speaking.
“Me too, love. Me too,” Harry replied, smiling broadly down at his girlfriend as the party continued on around them.
“Well of course you’d agree with her, Mr I’ll just crash this plane into the ice!”
Harry met her at the gallery space in the afternoon, the day before the opening night, watching on as she instructed staff as to where each of the 18 pieces should hang and he felt so incredibly proud of her. She’d worked so hard on each painting and to see them all hung together allowed him to finally see the theme she had running through the entire series that she had been explaining to him for the last few weeks.
“Louis can’t help throwing out the strong Big Brother vibes,” Harry agreed. “It’s like he spent so many years being the eldest sibling that he skips the friend’s stage and goes straight to sibling mode. He did it with all of us when the band was put together, and it looks like he’s tucked you under his wing too.”
“It’s so good to see you again, Love,” he said once they were both seated, and Aurora quickly agreed. They fell into easy conversation, much as they had over text or phone calls during the past month, staying in the café for a few hours until their third round of coffees had been finished. “How about a walk through the heath?” Harry asked as the café started to fill with the after school crowd.
“He’s sleeping kiddo, but we’ll call you when he’s up ok?”
After they’d both rinsed off and stepped out of the shower, they wrapped themselves in large fluffy towels and Aurora set about drying and styling her hair before getting started on her make up. By the time she was finished and slipping into her skinny jeans and lacey blouse, she turned to see Harry walking out of his large walk-in closet, black skinny jeans hugging his legs and a black button up short open at the collar.
“When you talk about your dad and that time, you mention Captain Rogers a lot,” Letterman pointed out. “The world was obviously quite shocked at the end of last year when they announced that they were not only in a relationship but were also engaged. What is your relationship with Steve like and how did you adjust to them being together?”
“It was on silent and we’re in the middle of binging Community,” Rori replied somewhat defensively, still scrolling through the notifications. “Do I even want to know what’s happening?”
“No,” Madz and Rori replied in unison.
Tony busied himself pouring a cup before turning to face Sam. “What are you doing up?”
“Me too, but I feel guilty too,” she admitted. “Why did I survive? What made me more worthy than anyone else that day?”
“No. I just thought it might be nice to get to know each other a bit.”
“I know,” Rori giggled. “It doesn’t seem real when I think about it like that.”
“Do you want to do Christmas this year?”
“I’ll be on my summer break by then, maybe I could come visit.”
“I think it’s a Dads job to worry, so I don’t think you’re doing too bad,” Rori said, still leaning against his chest. “Just maybe dial it back a bit.”
She kissed him deeply, his hand reaching for the zipper at the back of her dress, but when he started to pull it down Aurora froze in his arms and pulled away from the kiss.
“I don’t think my profile really needs any more of a boost at this point. Everyone and their dog seems to know who I am.” As if summoned by her words, Rori noticed a group of girls looking her way and attempting to take photos of her on their phones.

to Aurora towards the end of the first week and she made some suggestions to the unfinished song, writing a section to slip into the song about 2/3rds of the way through.
“Harry Styles invited you to games night at Louis Tomlinson’s house?”
“Feeling better?” he murmured.
“I don’t really know what to say Sam,” Rori admitted. “I keep trying not to think about it.”
“Why’d you never share it with your band or family or anyone?” Harry asked, leaning forward to grasp her hand once again.
“What?”
“Good thing you’ll never have to find out,” she replied, smiling warmly up at the man she loved before kissing him. “When are you going to announce it?” she asked softly when they pulled apart.
“Every year I think it’ll get easier,” she whispered, “but it never does. It always hurts so much.”
“I think you’re right,” she agreed, lacing her fingers through his long curls and tugging his face up to kiss him again. “I’m feeling more like myself every day.”
“A new Iron Man suit,” Tony replied. “Did you need something?”
“I know you can, and you know I’m here whenever you want to talk. Some days you’re gonna feel like everything’s good and then it’ll hit you out of nowhere. PTSD’s a bitch so don’t let it make you think you’re weak or that there’s something wrong with you, ok?”
“Sounds great,” Rori said. “Thank you, you made it far less intimidating than I thought it would be.”
Aurora was sitting in the living room, binge watching Community with Thor and Bucky and turned in her seat as the elevator doors open and Mark walked out. “Hey Mark,” she greeted happily. “Sorry boys,” she added, turning back to Thor and Bucky, “Gonna have to bale on you. Fill me in when I get back.” She got up from the sofa and walked over to Mark who pulled her in for a hug. After the hug, they walked down the hall towards a sitting room far enough away from the living room to offer the pair some privacy.
“He makes me so happy too, Anne,” Rori promised. “I don’t know what I did to deserve him.”
“Absolutely,” Rori grinned in response.
“Sounds perfect,” Aurora agreed, and both stood, shrugging into their coats and pulling on their beanies and scarves. The winter air was crisp and biting as they stepped out on the footpath and Harry offered his arm to Rori as they walked the short distance to the sprawling heath. She looped her arm through his before tucking her hands back into her pockets and she pressed herself into his side as they walked along the wide paths in the sunshine. There were plenty of others walking nearby but nobody seemed aware of the two celebrities passing them by for which both were grateful.
“It was your grandmothers,” he said softly. “It only really gets played when there’s a party.”
Author note: I’m adding a week break after the 3 London shows of the Where We Are Tour in June otherwise assume the real life timetable.
In the end, neither Steve nor Aurora had the chance to tell Tony about her going on stage before he saw it plastered across the internet. After a couple of fans tweeted about it, every gossip site or trashy news paper like the Daily Mail was running with the story. The boys were busy all day with multiple radio interviews for the release day of

“From everything Harry’s told us, I knew that you’d be a wonderful woman,” Anne said. “We’re excited to have you join the family.”
“You alright love?” he asked.
“Tony,” Steve interjected softly, having stayed out of the argument until that point. “She’s right. It’s only 10 minutes to LaGuardia High and no one knows who she is. She’ll just be one of countless students walking those streets. She’ll be fine.”
“Now Aurora,” David continued, “There’s not much we know about you so why don’t you tell us a bit about yourself? How is that the world was unaware of you for 17 years?”
“Like you? They love you,” Harry laughed. “You and Louis together are gonna be a pain in the ass. I can already tell.”
“I love you too kiddo,” Tony sighed, wishing for the millionth time that his daughter had not inherited his stubbornness. “Enjoy your dinner, and I’ll meet you at the airport when you land tomorrow.”
Steve watched his daughter walk away from him, his face softening at the skip in her step and he knew that no matter how angry Tony was going to be, it was worth it to see her excited about anything again. The smile on her face was worth it and he decided to wait to tell his husband until afterwards, when he would have videos and photos to help explain why she needed to do this.
“Could I?” Rori asked softly, looking back over her shoulder with a shy smile.
Jay wrapped her arms around Aurora and hugged her tightly. “It’s so good to see you again Darling. You’re looking more yourself then when I saw you last month.”
“I’m glad. I was hoping we’d get a chance to talk,” he said, pulling up another stool next to hers. They chatted for almost an hour about anything and everything before the conversation returned to the awards ceremony earlier in the evening.
Aurora had wanted to surprise both Harry and Louis with her arrival, so she had contacted Niall to help her organise everything and he sent a car to collect them from the airport. The blond Irishman bounded out of the back entry to the O2 Arena when the car pulled up, a bright grin lighting up his face as he opened the door and pulled Rori through the door and into his arms. “God, I missed you Darling,” he said as he hugged her tightly. “How you feeling?”
It wouldn't be a SuperFamily fic without the Spider-Son. Here comes Peter!
“Doc said the surgery went really well. They want to keep you in for a few hours until the anaesthetics completely out of your system and then we can go home.”
“That’s very kind of you, and him. Are you ready to start?”
“I do,” Rori said, “and I love you too.”
“Your pops and I are gonna go track down his old friend Barnes,” Tony explained.
“Not mad at Steve either,” Tony refuted.
“You’d be bored,” Rori joked, pulling back from the hug and pecking his lips one last time.
“I got invited to the after party,” she told them, “and I promise I won’t drink, and I’ll be back to the hotel by a reasonable time.”
Ooof this one is looong
Aurora was crying softly when Tony walked back into the hospital room and at first, he didn’t say anything. He just sat down next to her on the bed and let her lean into him, his arms wrapping around her and holding her gently as she gasped for breath. By the time she pulled herself together, Tony’s eyes were shut, and he was humming softly, his lips pressed into her hair.
“Of course. Dad’s always said you were his favourite interviewer so when I had to decide, you seemed like the best option.”
“I am,” she whispered softly. “Sorry.”
“I love you,” she told him, pulling her face back from his neck to look into his eyes.
“He’ll get over it,” Aurora replied, smiling with excitement. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to go work out what I’m going to wear.”
“Will you marry me?” he asked again, voice quiet and nervous, almost shy which was a term Rori had never used to describe the man she loved.
“I spoke to them and I really don’t think you have anything to feel bad about.” Mark reached out to place a comforting hand on her shoulder before he continued. “You’re the only one who gets to decide how you handle this Rori. No one else gets to decide for you or tell you what the right way to process everything is.”
[Harry,
“How you feeling love?” Louis asked watching with a soft smile the way she leaned into Harry’s side and he instantly wrapped his arm around her shoulder.
“I had nothing to do with it,” Harry laughed, raising his hands in mock defence. “She cooked up the idea with Lou and they’d decided they were going long before I invited myself. I was just tagging along and figured I’d get something done while we were there.”
“I understand that,” Sam said. “Mind if I give you some advice?”
“I’m a big fan,” Harry added. “Love your channel and the song you wrote for your dad’s wedding was fantastic.”
“Groggy,” Rori mumbled.
She continued listening and reading and she had only 2 tracks to go when her phone lit up with Harry’s grinning face. “Congratulations baby!” she cheered when she answered the call, hearing him chuckle.
– Aurora –
Finally, after near an hour, Aurora drew quiet and sank into Steve’s embrace. Her breathing evened out as she fell asleep and he leant himself back against the headboard to get comfortable as she buried herself into his chest. The two men shared a meaningful look across their daughters’ head and then Steve closed his eyes, settling himself in for the rest of the night, his arms still wrapped around Rori’s body.
“As I’ll ever be,” Rori replied. There was a brief pause while the crew finished their final checks on the camera’s and other equipment before signalling for Letterman to begin his introduction.
“No, I don’t mean leave for the tour. I mean leave me,” she continued, her voice quiet and full of fear. “I’m broken Harry. I might never be the same ever again and you deserve so much more than this.”
“Umm,” she began, nervously looking between the two men. “I just wanted to remind you that the boys are giving their final performance next weekend in London.”
By the time the end credits began to roll, Aurora was asleep with her face pressed against Tony’s shoulder, his arm wrapped tightly around her shoulders. His shirt was damp from the tears she had silently shed about halfway through the film but now she slept peacefully. Steve gently pulled her up into his arms, carrying her to bed and tucking her in.
“We’re all exhausted,” he explained. “None of us have gotten the chance to see our families or live our lives for more than a few weeks at a time in years. We’re in our early 20s and we’ve been working non-stop for the last 5 years. Zayn leaving just made us realise that this isn’t healthy for any of us and we decided we should take a year or two off now before any of us burn out. I don’t want any of them to leave like he did, I can’t do that again. If we all take a break now, we can make sure that doesn’t happen. I just hope the fans don’t hate us for it.”

“I don’t think we’ll stay too much longer either,” Harry promised.
“A bit cold?” Harry chuckled. “It’s bloody freezing out there.”
“I know it’s silly,” she said. “It’s only 2 weeks but I’m so used to sleeping next to you every night.”
His lips traced the wounds before his hands returned to the zip, pulling it down the rest of the way until the dress fell to the floor, leaving Aurora standing in only her bra and panties. He dropped to his knees in front of her, his fingers tracing along the scar above her left hip, his mouth following their path. He heard Rori suck in an unstable breath and looked up at her. Silent tears were rolling down her face as she looked down at him and in an instant, he was standing with her face cradled in his shoulder, one hand stroking calmly along her spine while the other held her head to him.
“I swear if either of you get yourselves hurt; I’ll never forgive you.”
“Congratulations then,” Harry said, smiling widely.
“True,” Steve agreed. “But what little I’ve learnt about you so far, I’ve liked.”
“Really? He always seems like he’s terrified of talking to me for too long.”
“Fuck the show!” Louis shouted, causing everyone in the room to jump in response to his outburst. “Get him on a plane, we’ll deal with the show later.”
20 minutes later, Harry found Rori and Louis sitting in the corner of the room with their heads together conspiratorially whispering and writing something down. When he peered over their shoulders, he saw that it was the lyrics for
“Well I talked to your surgeon before you left the hospital the other day,” Sam replied, “and he said the abdominal and upper arm wounds should start to heal up in about 4-6 weeks and the clavicle and shoulder blade will take another 2 weeks after that. I’d say recovery is your next step. 2 months of healing and physical therapy. Once you heal up, we’ll focus on the hand and all the other stuff.”

The pair lapsed into silence and after a few moments Rori turned her attention to her sketch book. The two sketched side by side for hours until the sun started to set, and the studio started to darken with the lengthening shadows.
“Not at all,” Rori said. “This is my partner, Harry by the way.”
“When your reaction stops being this good,” Rori chuckled, leaning up on the toes of her stilettos to kiss him again.
“But what do I do now? The thought of going back to school makes me sick, and I might never play the piano again. What do I do with my life now?”
Letterman turned away from the camera as the director called cut and the crew busied themselves around the set. “That was great,” he told the young woman. “The team will edit it together and we’ll send you the final cut before we air it next week.”
She took another deep breath before lifting her head and offering a small smile to her rescuer. Her smile froze on her face when she caught sight of the man next to her.
“You weren’t kidding about being a fan,” he finally said once his laughter had died down.
“Love, what happened?” He asked gently as he knelt down on the cold floor, pulling her up and into his arms. She didn’t reply at first, simply pushing herself closer against him as her breathing stuttered.
“She’s gonna be ok,” Steve promised, wrapping his arms around Harry and hugging the young man again. “Our girls a fighter.”
They all clambered to their feet and followed the pair into the elevator. The doors closed at the lift descended, the doors reopening on the floor that housed the workshop and Steve’s art studio. Instead of heading straight towards the workshop’s doors, or left towards the studio, Tony led the group towards the right, throwing open a set of double doors with a dramatic flourish. Rori froze as she took in the space, unable to speak in the face of such an overwhelming gift. Tony turned towards her, his face falling as soon as he caught sight of the tears falling down her cheeks. He quickly rushed forward, pulling her into his arms and holding her tightly against his cheeks. “Don’t you like it?” he asked, anxiety thickening his voice.
Aurora looked between both of them in confusion. “You two are the weirdest parents ever,” she declared, to which they both just shrugged with another laugh.
“You’re not pregnant, are you?” Clint asked, causing both Tony and Steve’s heads to snap towards their daughter.
“Not at all,” Rori said, a smile still stretching across her face. “Your mum was just filling me in on how much you and Harry missed me.”
The second week of Aurora’s stay in Columbia, she and Gary put their heads together and wrote
“Hey babe,” he said when she wrapped her arm around his waist. “Having fun?”
“I’ll join to in a minute,” Rori said when Anne asked her if she was coming with them. “Just waiting on one more person. Save me 2 seats next you?”
“I don’t drink,” Rori replied simply.
Tony fell silent, all the wind taken out of his argument.
The pain was excruciating, beyond explanation as blood ran down her arm, pooling on the ground. A second wound blossomed across her lower abdomen, quickly soaking through her pale grey sweater. More gun shots continued to ring out as Aurora’s vision became hazy and she fought against the desire to rest. She slumped backwards on the floor as still more blood continued to pool around her, a lot of it her own, but more still coming from her friends.
“It’s big,” Rori said. “It’s really big. Are you sure that’s a good idea?”
And I
“Yeah, I’ve been thinking about that. Maybe when you arrive before the show in London, we can both post a photo of us together and just confirm it on social media?”
“We love you too bug,” Steve chuckled softly.
“I think I’d really like to do that.”
“That I was going to hurt them,” she admitted. “I knew how much it would destroy them if I died.”
“I thought I’d never see you again,” she sobbed.
After hitting send, she looked back up at her father. “Well there’s no going back now.”
“Chaotic,” she said. “We had to have the tower rebuilt and then everyone wanted to know everything they could about the Avengers and about me. It was all so overwhelming, and that entire summer seemed to last for years but also somehow passed in the blink of an eye at the same time. Before I could really process it all, we’d moved back into the tower with the rest of the Avengers moving in as well and then I was starting my senior year. Dad had designed an entire floor for each member of team and I had entire wing of the penthouse to myself but we all spent so much time together in the main living room that by the time I went back to school we were this crazy family of assassins, scientists and soldiers and it was just such a chaotic but happy place to be. I’m so glad we had that environment otherwise I’m not sure how we would have dealt with the aftermath of that day.”
“Thank you,” Aurora replied, her matching smile lighting up her face.
“Absolutely. Between them and my mum I was always encouraged to explore art. I became obsessed with the piano. By the time I was 11 I’d gotten good enough that I was allowed to play during happy hour and every Sunday the regular patrons would make their song requests and I would spend all week learning them and then play them on Thursday and Friday evenings. It was around then that I started singing and I guess I never really stopped after that.”
“I’ll go with her and make sure she’s safe,” Steve continued, ignoring Tony’s snipe. “We’ll take the jet, go for a few days and then come straight back.”
“Oh, beautiful there’s nothing wrong with you,” Harry murmured. He placed kisses across her hairline while his hand gently ran up and down her uninjured arm. “You’ve gone through something so horrific. It’s only natural for you to be on edge.”
“Yeah, I don’t really know how to do this either,” Tony admitted.
“Yeah, I did,” Tony replied. “I wanted him to feel like this was his home as much as it’s mine. Same goes for you.”
Aurora nodded quickly and focused on the rise and fall of her fathers’ chest to match her own breathes to his. By the time she calmed down, the nurse returned and began to wheel Aurora from the room and down the hall towards the OR.
“I love you too dad,” she replied.
“It’s a little overwhelming right now but I think I will after I have a chance to get used to it all.”
“You won’t kid. The song is incredible and so are you. You’re going to kill this.”
Joe picked up his guitar when she finished singing and started to put together the melody, asking her to re-sing certain sections, and then Jay was joining in with the bass line and Gary started piecing together another verse. They spent a few says working on the song until they’d finished
“They’re the best,” Rori grinned, finally shaking off her nerves as she talked about her family. “They were always spoiling me. When I was 6, they brought me my first art set for Christmas and always proudly hung my paintings and sketches in the bar and then when I was 7, I came home from school raving about how I’d got to play on the piano in music class. My music teacher had been talking about how the school would be running a private lesson program and I begged my mum to let me take lessons. I was pretty obnoxious about it now that I look back on it, but of course my mum said we couldn’t afford it and she apologized to me over and over again, but the next day not only had Helen paid for my lessons but one of the regulars at the bar that had heard my pleading brought in an old second hand piano that he said was taking up space in his house. I was allowed to play for an hour every day after school before the crowds started to roll in for happy hour and I could play for as long as I wanted in the mornings on the weekend before the lunch rush.”
“I really thought I’d be ok,” she said. “Last year was so much easier with you and your family, but this year I feel like I can’t breathe.”
“Oh, nothing much,” Niall shrugged, before turning both boys around to face Rori. “Just this!” he announced with a flourish.

Steve and Tony called back later that night. It took Steve over an hour to convince her that he would be absolutely fine, and in a few days all his injuries would be completely healed thanks to the serum. “I think I should come home,” she said at one point of the conversation.
“Remember that conversation we had a few weeks ago?” Rori asked. “You know the one where you promised to try and stop controlling everything? If the shooting hadn’t happened, you wouldn’t have had any problem with me flying out for this show on my own.”
“It’s too much,” Rori explained, finally stepping back from the hug and turning to once again look at the recording studio spread out before her. “I don’t know what to say.”
“I love you Rori,” he whispered. “Don’t know what I’d do without you in my life.”
this chapter contains the events of Captain America: Winter Soldier which you can assume happens in this story the same as in cannon, and since the movies never address why the other avengers didn’t come help Steve and Nat out then I won't give it a lot of effort. We're just gonna go with Steve asked him not to get involved. I don’t know, don’t think about it too much.
After the show, Harry rushed to his girlfriend's side, pulling Aurora into a hug and spinning her around as soon as he reached her. “I can’t believe you’re here,” he yelled excitedly. “I thought I wasn’t going to see you for another week.”
“He’s not my boyfriend,” Rori mumbles, not enjoying the attention from the group who had completely forgotten the movie. “We’re just talking.”
They stayed at the Golden Stag for most of the afternoon, allowing Aurora to catch up with what she had missed in the year since their last visit, and while they had plans to catch up with old friends while in town, they all promised to come back for dinner on Aurora’s birthday in a few days’ time.
“Well we’ve got all night,” Harry replied.
“What’s wrong,” he asked, he’s brow furrowing.
Most of the Avengers were sprawled out in the living room when they got back, excited to see the boxes of donuts in Harry’s hands. While Anne and Robin joined them on the sofas, Harry turned to Tony. “She downstairs?” he asked, expecting Aurora to be in either of her studios as she usually spent her mother’s anniversary.
“If you’re not ready for me to see that, we don’t have to do anything tonight,” he murmured, ever the gentleman she fell in love with.
Harry’s face dropped a little in response to her words before quickly schooling his features. “Yeah, of course,” he replied. “It was really nice meeting you.”
“Yeah, he’s getting there,” Tony answered. “He was still a bit confused when we finally tracked him down but he’s already getting better. I mean don’t get me wrong, he’s got a long way to go but he’s been doing really well in therapy so it’s just a matter of time really.”
“It’s a 10 minute walk!” Rori countered.
and then before Aurora could really believe it was all over, the song ended, and the boys pulled each other into a group hug. She let a few tears drip down her cheeks as she watched them take in the screams of their fans one last time and then it was done, and they made their way off the stage. The rest of the show passed by in a blur and Aurora didn’t even really get to enjoy Adele’s performance as she was so eager to get backstage with the lads. As soon as the cameras were off, Aurora, Ella and the rest of the families were quickly escorted backstage by security and led into the boys dressing room. Aurora hugged each of them, first Liam then Niall, she clung to Louis for a long time and then he passed her off to Harry who squeezed her tight, dipping his head to bury his face in the crook of her neck and she felt her skin damp with his tears. She didn’t say anything, instead holding him a little tighter while he pulled himself back together.
“LaGuardia?” she asked. “I’ve read about it. It’s unbelievably good but the audition process is brutal apparently.”
“Just needed a minute away from the noise,” Aurora whispered, finally turning to face him and showing him the silent tears rolling down her cheeks. “It was all just getting a bit much.”
, their first song achieved 12,000 views within the first week.
“How about I chuck the kettle on?” Anne asked the room. “Who wants a cuppa?”
A few days after Christmas Aurora, Tony and Steve made their way to JFK and boarded the Stark private jet, bound for London, where they had plans to stay for two weeks before flying home to New York in time for Rori to go back to college. After arriving and checking into their hotel, Tony organised for a car to pick them up and they headed south of the city towards Wimbledon. Aurora was bouncing with excitement once the car finally pulled to a stop out the front of the Golden Stag pub, and she was already opening the front door by the time either Tony or Steve had left the car. She stepped into the pub, familiar scents and sounds washing over her for a moment before Helen looked up from behind the bar, her eyes lighting up as soon as she saw the younger woman.
“You knew then that Tony Stark was your father?”
A few days after
Aurora wasn’t at all surprised by the surprise party that she walked into when she stepped out of the lift and into the penthouse with Harry by her side. The scene that greeted her was so perfectly Tony, that she felt herself grinning widely. There was a banner strung across the living room that read;
“This one’s good,” Jay said.
“Thanks Aurora,” the newest Avenger replied. “Not sure what I’ve gotten myself into with this one,” he gestured towards Steve, who rolled his eyes. “Should be good fun though.”
“Surprise,” she giggled, gripping his face in her hands and kissing him deeply. “I missed you.”

“Yes, you will,” Rori agreed with a genuine smile, dropping the conversation as Steve returned with Sam in tow. “Welcome to the madhouse, Sam.”
“Hey,” Tony greeted her softly. “How you doing kid?”
“Your father is going to kill us,” Steve mumbled.
“What would you have done if you were still in London?” Tony asked quietly once it was clear that she was not going to add anything further.
“Not at all,” Rori said, smiling as he reached out for her hand, threading their fingers together.
“Oh,” Tony replied, “Um… yeah, ok. What do you want to know?”
“I started writing it like 3 years ago,” Rori explained. “Not long after my mum died, just the chorus at first and then over the years the verses have fallen into place and then I’ve been sitting on it for about a year. Nobody had ever heard it until I showed my manager a few months ago.”
birthday, Rori smiled brightly as her mother continued to talk even though her mouth was full of waffles and Rori could barely understand half of her muffled story. When they had both eaten their fill, they leaned back in their seats, hands resting against their overstuffed stomachs, matching grins gracing both of their faces. To the other customers in the nearby booths, they must have looked like two friends hanging out together on Christmas eve, as despite the 19 year age difference between them, Louise still retained her youthful good looks and with her long blonde hair and wrinkle free face, she did not look old enough to be the mother of the young black haired girl sitting across from her. The only physical characteristic that hinted at the fact that they were related was their identical pairs of piercing blue eyes.
“Yeah, they’re famous,” Rori replied, scrunching up her face in response to the word.
“I remember watching the news coverage,” Letterman added. “We’d just watched Iron Man’s miraculous survival and then all of a sudden there was this schoolgirl running towards the Avengers and then she was on the ground and Captain America was hugging her and no one knew who you were or what was happening.”
“Technically this is my third chance,” Aurora explained. “My second chance was when mum died and I survived. This is technically my third chance.”
“Have fun,” Rori replied, “I’ll talk to you later ok.”
She looked towards the ceiling as she uttered the final line, the tears she had felt building throughout the performances finally falling down her checks as the song came to a close and she was met by a loud applause from the hundreds of guests.
“Missed you,” he murmured in her ear as he set her back on her feet.
“Ok I’ve got half of something,” Rori said one morning after they’d piled into the studio. “Just a half assed melody and a verse and chorus I came up with last night.”
“Steve. Not sure how he got my number, but he called yesterday to invite me, and I suggested bringing the rest of the band too.”
“It never is.”
, a song that she had written with Harry late one night when they’d stayed up in the studio after the others had turned in for the night.
“You are very welcome.”
“Actually, that’s not half bad,” Xav replied and he looked over at Rori to find a smile stretching across her face.
Aurora was nervous when she entered the recording studio in North Hollywood. Mark had sent her the address the previous week and told her that the four members of Our Last Night would be expecting her at 9am, so there she was walking through the front door, with Harry’s supportive hand on her lower back.
they alternated the next four lines seamlessly, Gary singing first and then Aurora.
“You’re a Stark now, kid. That name opens up a lot of doors if you want it to.”
“So, there’s something I need to tell you before we get back to the tour,” Harry said, breaking the comfortable silence that had stretched around them in the summer night. “Something the boys and I have been talking about for a while now.”
“I love you too. See you in 6 weeks,” she said.
“It’s at Louis Tomlinson’s house.” The other people in the bar turned to stare at the girls as Ella squealed. “I thought I said you couldn’t freak out,” Rori chided.
“I’ll set it up.”
Harry turned on his heel and walked back into the house, leaving Rori to approach the circle of friends sitting around the fire pit, taking one of the two empty seats. “So everyone, this is Aurora,” Louis announced, before pointing to each person and providing Rori with their names.
but they all headed out for dinner to celebrate the album and to finally be able to celebrate Harry and Aurora’s engagement now that they were both in London together again. They were halfway through the entrée when Steve’s phone rang, Tony’s name flashing across the screen.
“You get whatever you needed?” Rori asked her boyfriend, watching as he stepped up to stand between the coffee table and where she sat, but instead of sitting down next to her like she expected him to, he dropped down on one knee. Rori’s breath stuck in her throat as Harry held the ring box open in front of him, a soft smile stretching across his face, making his dimples pop and his eyes shine.
“Don’t mention it,” Sam replied with a soft smile, patting her knee gently. “You’re family kid.”
The morning after her birthday dinner, Aurora met Harry for Sunday brunch at a trendy café in east London. While they knew they were risking being spotted together, neither could say they really cared, and they decided that while they wouldn’t publicly announce their relationship, they also wouldn’t actively try to hide from the world either. Luckily no one seemed to pay them much attention as they ate, chatting happily and nocking their feet against each other under the table. Aurora had often felt herself marvelling at the normalcy of talking to Harry. In the 6 weeks she had known him he had never once acted like the majority of famous people she’d encountered since moving to New York. He didn’t flaunt his wealth; he didn’t name drop other famous people he knew; he was just like any other 20 year old guy Rori might meet at university. They talked about sports, movies, books and other normal things that normal couples talked about, but most of all they talked music. Aurora found that they had similar taste in genres, although Harry didn’t understand her fascination with American country music, no matter how much she tried to explain the appeal of the storytelling and simple chords in her favourite songs. Louise had introduced her to a steady diet of 70s and 80s pop and rock, and she and Ella had obsessed over 90s and 2000s pop, but it wasn’t until she’d moved to the US a few years earlier that she’d really encountered country music. Now her music taste was so varied her go to playlists would jump from the Beatles to ACDC, Lady Gaga to Rascal Flats, Backstreet Boys to Linkin Park or Mayday Parade. As she’d told Harry, she firmly believed that enjoying every genre of music made her a better song writer.
Rori loved being in a band and the twin brothers, Madz and Xavier, quickly took a shine to the young brit. They spent most lunches in one of the schools many practice spaces, jamming away or just sitting around getting to know each other. Just like Rori, the boys were Juniors and Rori was in the same English Lit class as Madz. After showing them her YouTube channel shortly after meeting them, they had all decided that they would post their first cover to a new channel and share the video to Rori’s existing fan base to help jumpstart the band. While settling on the first song that they would cover had been an easy decision, coming up with a name for the band had been anything but.
All three ordered some food and Aurora couldn’t wipe the broad smile off her face as they relaxed into the plush booth seats. Steve let his eyes wonder, spotting a photo of Louise and a young Rori hanging on the wall behind the bar, as well as Aurora’s old piano over on the other side of the room, evidence that even though she had left London, Rori was still very much remembered here.
Christmas Day in Avengers tower was loud, and the penthouse was crowded. Having grown up with only her mother and her unofficial family from the bar, Aurora was surprised to find that she absolutely loved the crazy, bustling madness of the ragtag group assembled around her. Thor, Clint and Natasha was piling their plates high while Bucky and Sam bickered over crackers. Tony and Steve, with Peter’s help, continued piling more and more plates of food on the already full table, while Rhodey, Pepper, May and Happy were laughing cheerily as they took photos in the paper crowns from their own crackers, and Bruce was chatting with Anne and Robin. Harry sat by Aurora’s side, one of his hands on her thigh as the he dug into his food with the other, a bright smile lighting up his face and making his dimples pop. They all migrated to the sofas once they were all full to bursting and spent the rest of the day lounging around enjoying each other’s company.
“Oh,” Rori said, surprised by Steve’s admission. “I guess that makes sense.”
“I miss you too. Can’t wait for you to be back here. My family is excited to meet you. My mum won’t stop talking about it.”
“Just looks a lot worse than I thought it would,” Rori replied. “And they’re gonna slice into me again and again and it’s just going to look worse each time.”
Harry was interrupted from replying when Louis appeared at his shoulder, a pint in hand. “Oi Hazza!” he cheered loudly. “What are you doing hiding over here? You’re missing the party.”
It was much later in the concert, towards the end, when things changed. The smiles, winks and kisses that Harry had been directing towards his girlfriend all night had the fans surrounding her riled up into such a frenzy that during
“It was Christmas Eve 2010,” Aurora explained. “Every year we would go get waffles after her shift. It was one of my favourite things, and we’d walk home, full to bursting, looking at all the Christmas lights and singing carols the whole way back to the pub, but that year when we were almost home…” Her voice faded out, her eyes starting to gloss over with tears as her memories pulled her back to that night. “There was a drunk driver,” she continued, before David could ask if she needed a break. “He drove straight through the red light while we were crossing the street. It happened so fast. One minute we were laughing and then the next thing I knew I was flying up over the hood of the car and there was breaking glass and my mother screamed out my name. By the time I woke up in the hospital the next day she was already gone, and Child Protective Services was there.”
“It’s ok,” he replied. “Let me rephrase then; Any idea how you’re gonna use this third chance?”
“He went down there to run a few ops with Nat over the summer. She’s got his back, so we’ve just got to trust that he knows what he’s doing. He’ll be fine.” Aurora could tell that Tony didn’t really believe the words that he was saying, and she didn’t believe them either but they both silently agreed to keep pretending they did. If either of them allowed themselves to truly worry about Steve, they knew that they would crumble. For now, fake confidence would have to get them through. “I love you Rori,” Tony added.
century he is still very old fashioned in many ways and he felt it was important to make sure that I was on board before he asked, which of course I was.”
“I’m glad you’re happy,” Mark admitted. “You deserve it.”
“I love you,” he whispered, lips brushing lips.
As had become their tradition, Steve and Tony left Aurora alone for the most of Christmas Eve, only seeking her out later in the evening to watch The Santa Clause and have waffles for dinner. The rest of the team made themselves scarce for the day, allowing her to process the day in her own small way.
“I painted the proposal,” Rori explained. “Steve down on one knee in the rooftop garden at the top of Avengers Tower, and then I posted the video of painting it which slowly revealed their faces. At the end of the video they both appeared on the screen and announced that they were engaged and very happy together.”
“Exactly,” Rori said, letting out a deep sigh. “Good thing neither of us are normal.”
“They’ve got a private waiting room set up for you guys,” Happy told him once they reached the correct floor. “It’s the second door on the left up there. I’ll go take your things to the tower and then I’ll check in with Pepper.”
“Don’t we?” Rori asked him. “I’m not going to say anything in front of Pops because he deserves this, but I don’t trust you Bucky. Maybe I will someday but not yet.”
The sun was sitting as they left the airport and turned south, Aurora’s hand was resting on Harry’s thigh and she watched the clouds turn salmon pink in the sky. It was dark when Harry pulled his landrover into the driveway of Anne and Robins house, and Rori smiled warmly when she climbed out of the car to find Anne stepping out onto the front step.
“Then thank you,” Rori replied softly. “It’s incredible.”
“I want to help you get through this.”
“I’m sorry this is all so complicated,” he sighed, and she could imagine the pout on his lips.
“And?” Tony asked, his brow furrowing.
“I really am sorry, H,” Aurora said after Sam left.
“I’ll leave you kids to it,” Sam chuckled. “Have JARVIS let me know when you’re ready tomorrow and we’ll have a chat, yeah?”
“I thought I was gonna be too late,” Harry confessed when he finally regained enough composure to speak. “I was terrified that by the time I got here she’d be gone.”
And then they sang the last chorus together, occasionally alternating lines, dipping in and out of the lyrics, watching each other to read which lines to take and which to leave for the other.
“I don’t want to go home tomorrow,” she said, looking up at Harry. “These last 2 weeks have been so incredible.”
“What the fuck?” Rori mumbled, turning back to her father to see the faceplate retract.
She was disorientated at first, groggy from the anaesthetic and confused by the harsh fluorescent lighting. All three men surged forward out of their seats as she started to wake, rushing to her side immediately. Her eyes flitted from her fathers to Harry before she burst into tears. Harry reacted quicker than either of the other two men, gently wrapping his arms around her, cautious of her injuries, and pulled her against his chest as she gasped for breath.
“And you started writing songs for other artists around the same time?”
Harry was instantly worried when he walked into the bathroom leading off Aurora's room a few days after her chat with Sam. He walked in to find her curled up on the tiles, her face red and blotchy, her chest heaving with her sobs.
For your eyes only,

A few moments later, Ella arrived, her excitement clear from the moment she walked in the room. “Rori!” she shouted, launching herself into her best friends’ arms. “God, I missed you babe!”
A few days after she returned home, Tony and Steve were scheduled to appear on the Late Show for the first night with the new host Stephen Colbert, and since she didn’t have any classes the day they were needed at the Ed Sullivan Theatre, Aurora decided to join them for the day. Having appeared on the Late Show a couple of times when it was hosted by Letterman, Aurora somewhat knew her way around the theatre, although it was interesting to see the subtle changes that had been made for the shows soft reboot with a new host. She’d watched Tony and Steve’s interview from the green room, smiling softly at Steve awkwardness and Tony’s absolute calm in front of the cameras and the audience. Colbert asked them about the team, about leading them together and of course he asked about their relationship. Tony took the lead with most of the answers but when they were asked what it was like having your husband next to you in a fire fight, it was Steve that answered first.
Little snapshots looking back on Tony, Steve and Rori adjusting to becoming a family
They sat for a little while longer before ordering two large hot chocolates to go, and shimmying back into their coats, scarves and hats before venturing back out into the cold night air, arm in arm. The streets were quitter now that it was closer to 10pm, there were only a few other people on the footpaths and very few cars driving by. The ground was damp due the rain that had fallen while they were thankfully inside and Rori laughed as Louise slipped in a puddle, barely managing to avoid falling and dragging her daughter with her. They were both still giggling as the pedestrian light turned green and they began to cross the street, the warm glow of Golden Stag beckoning them from a block away.
“I’ve been walking to school on my own for years,” Aurora argued as she stood in front of Steve and Tony in the living room.
“I have no idea sweetheart,” Tony replied. “Your pops sent me a message that they’re safe and he said they’ve got it under control, and that I shouldn’t head down there. I can’t reach him now, but it’s gonna be ok Kiddo.”
“What passed through your thoughts when the portal closed and all the Chitauri were dead?” David asked.
“We used to get waffles every Christmas Eve,” Rori explained as they ate. Neither Tony nor Steve replied, but they both moved a little bit closer on either side of her.
“S’ok love,” Harry murmured, his hand rubbing along her spine. “Just wish I’d known how to help you.”
was incredible but I just don’t think I’m ready to do an album or a tour or anything on my own yet. Please don’t be mad.”
“First of all, it was an industry party, but yes I did go to it with Harry, but we actually caught up the day before for lunch. I swear to god you better not shriek again but he asked me to be his girlfriend.” Aurora rolled her eyes as Ella clamped her hands over her mouth to muffle her excited response. “You can’t say a word to anyone El,” Aurora said. “Please, you know what the Directioners are like. We just want to keep it out of the media for now.”
“Glad to be here too, Mumma,” Aurora replied with a soft smile, neither woman missing the double meaning in their words. Anne pulled back from the hug, grabbing the younger woman’s right hand to inspect the diamond ring with a smile a mile wide.
“I’m guessing the fame and fortune of being a Stark has taken some adjusting too…?”
“Now that I'm not around,” Gary sang with Aurora echoing the line.
“Absolutely!” Aurora yelled back enthusiastically. “Want us to bring you back anything Helen?”

“Not cool, Steve,” Tony said once the elevator doors closed behind her. “Very not cool.”
“Aurora,” she whispered.
“That doesn’t make what they’re saying ok,” Tony said, already itching to respond to some of the nastier comments but knowing that would make things so much worse.
“God it’s good to see you love,” Louis sighed, placing a kiss to her temple. “You gave us all quite the scare.”
Harry agreed and Rori quickly moved his arm around her shoulder and held on to his waist as they headed back out onto the deck. She managed to keep her tipsy boyfriend on his feet as he stumbled along and was grateful when she quickly found Louis and Niall amongst the dancing party guests.
“They’ll love ya,” he promised.
“Just gotta keep taking it one step at a time,” she said, echoing the phrase Sam repeated often during their chats. “And today’s step is to enjoy watching you boys perform, and then finally getting to take this one home with me.”
“It’s still there,” he admitted. “I’m not sure it will ever fully go away, but it got better when I talked about it. Wilson’s offered to help. You know he worked at Veteran Affairs back in DC helping soldiers with PTSD?”
The pair spent the rest of the afternoon catching each other up on the last month and simply revelling in being together after weeks apart.
“What happened?” he asked, following her into the kitchen and watching as she set about making a cup of tea to settle her nerves, shaking his head when she gestured to a second mug. She explained as the kettle boiled and then took a seat at the island bench, her mug clutched in her hands. “What were you thinking walking home on your own this late?”
“No, I need to say this,” Tony interrupted. “I’m Iron Man. It’s literally my job to protect people and I couldn’t protect you. I love you Aurora, more than I thought it was possible to love another person and when I saw you bleeding out in Steve’s arms, I thought I was going to lose you and I couldn’t breathe. Somehow, I got a second chance to keep you safe and the only way I know how to do that is to keep you close. I’m so sorry I yelled at you, kiddo.”
The Gallery show opened 3 days later and Aurora felt an immense sense of pride in her work as she watched people walk around, taking in her paintings. Her dads were both walking through the crowd, talking with guests about how great the paintings were, as were the Harry’s 3 bandmates. Aurora was feeling incredibly grateful for how supportive her friends and family were and she felt herself getting quite emotional. Harry, who was standing next to her, noticed her starting to sniffle and placed his hands on her shoulders, turning her to look at him.
birthday. Helen and Greg were there of course, as was Ella’s mum Rebecca, the Stag regulars Tom, David, Mick and Jim were also there, but it was the unexpected addition of the 5 other men amongst the small group that surprised Rori. Harry’s smile split across his face as their eyes locked, Liam, Niall, Louis and Zayn standing next to him. Helen ordered everyone to pull up a seat as she began dishing up hearty servings of the best looking Sunday roast Rori had ever seen, but before she could take the seat left for her at the head of the table, Harry was by her side.
“I didn’t want to worry you,” he admitted, “and I was ashamed. I shouldn’t have been, but I was. I thought I should have been stronger, and I was scared to let you see me be weak.”
Harry threw a smirk towards his girlfriend, his expression clearly saying, ‘
Harry chuckled into her neck. “I know this year was bad but 2016 is going to be good for us.”
“I’m good,” Harry replied, kissing her temple. “But come back here once you get yours. Miss you.”
Begrudgingly Harry let go of Aurora and allowed Louis to pull her into his arms.
“No,” Tony replied. “Last I saw she was in her room.”
Much later in the evening Aurora caught sight of the time, noting that it was well after midnight, although the party showed no signs of winding down. “It’s getting late,” she pointed out. “I should probably be heading back to my hotel before my parents start to worry.”
“I’ll only agree if your surgeon signs off on it,” Tony conceded with a deep weary sigh.
“Spit it out Pep,” Tony replied, “You’re starting to worry me.”
“Makes sense,” Sam agreed. “You’re a parent. It’s natural to want to protect your kid from everything but you can’t protect her from what’s in her head.”
“Any news?” he asked.
“What?”
“Thanks Hap,” Harry said, offering the man a tired smile before slowly walking down the hall.
“Aurora Borealis?”
“Good to see you too Jay, and I’m feeling more myself.” She smiled brightly back at the older woman. “Feels good to be back with the lads.”
“Who exactly is everyone?” Aurora asked.
She nodded in reply, a small smile pulling at the corners of her mouth as she remembered. “He was shocked by the news, as I’m sure anyone would be to learn that they had a 16 year old kid. He got straight on a plane and flew to London to meet me. I think my foster dad nearly had a stroke when he answered the door. We had dinner together and he asked me all about my life and I told him about my mum and living at the pub and the accident. It was awkward at first but within a few hours we’d just hit it off and then when I asked him about signing the forms he refused. He invited me to come live with him in New York instead, at least until I was 18 and then if I didn’t want to stay, he said I could move wherever I wanted. I agreed and we flew out a week later after the courts signed off on it.”
“I know!” Mark laughed, “How incredible is this?”
“They love it!” the 15 year old cheered.
“Steve said you were smart,” Bucky replied, seemingly unaffected by Auroras blunt words. “Glad to see he was right. I don’t trust myself completely either but we’re working on it. I’m doing therapy to help with the brainwashing and your dad is fixing my arm. I’ll earn your trust.”
“You’re going to be performing at the AMAs next month.”
“Yeah ok,” Rori said. “It’s more than just a bit cold.”
It all happened very fast. One moment the two women were giggling and slipping on the wet road, the next the screech of tires had them both turning towards the fast approaching headlights careening towards them. Aurora didn’t have the chance to react before her mother pushed her slightly and then all of a sudden, she felt herself bouncing up and over the hood of the car, the sound of a scream ripping through the air, accompanied by breaking glass and crunching metal.
A few days after the day she spent in Steve’s art studio with him, Rori made her way downstairs to Tony’s workshop. She asked JARVIS to announce her presence outside the glass door, watching Tony stare intently at the screen in front of him before he snapped his eyes up to look at her, a smile stretching across his face as he spoke, clearly telling JARVIS to let her in as the door slid open a moment later.
“I love it,” Gary said, singing it through a few times for smiling widely. “Inviting you down here was the best idea we’ve ever had.”
Jay watched the two with tears in her eyes, always emotional to see the family her eldest had built for himself amongst the band and their families. She knew that the hiatus would be good for them all and looked forward to having her only son home more, but she found herself feeling a little sad they wouldn’t all be spending as much time together over the next year and a half.
“Now I’ve got to head back to my seat before the lads think I’ve done a runner, but please tell me you’ll be at the after party?”
“Knew you would,” he replied.
Shortly before midnight, when almost everyone had left for the night, only Nat, Clint and Bruce remained in the living room of the penthouse with the Stark-Rogers family and Harry. After refilling his drink in the kitchen, Tony walked past where Rori was sitting, lifting her wine glass to her lips to take a sip. “What is that on your wrist?” he asked, pulling his daughters attention away from a conversation she was having with Bruce. She paused for a brief moment before following Tony’s eyes to the inside of her left wrist.
“What does that look like for me?” she asked. “What is my next step?”
“Yeah, that makes sense,” she said, reaching out to push open the front door. Aurora froze on the threshold as a chorus of

“What?” Rori gasped. “How? What happened?”

played out she took a deep breath, running her fingers through her hair to push it back out of her face as sweat beaded across her body from the dancing and the swelling crowd surrounding her. She was leaning against the barrier and looked up with a goofy grin, watching Harry and the other boys walking back towards where she was standing as Niall spoke to the screaming girls about the upcoming song. By some stroke of luck, as Harry took a seat on the central apparatus built into the stage he looked out over the crowd and spotted her standing only a few metres in front of him, freezing in place in shock as their eyes locked. The girls around her started screaming hysterically in response to his stare and she shot him a cheeky grin and a little wave that caused a huge grin to break out across his face, exposing his dimples.
In mid-February, Aurora was sitting in her favourite on campus café at Columbia, with her laptop, notebook and art theory textbooks spread out across a small table in the corner. She’d been set up there for most of the day, attempting to get her head around her latest research paper, a steady stream of coffee refills, muffins and a sandwich getting her through the hours. A little after lunch she was joined at the table by her manager, Mark. She attempted to push some of her books to the side to make space for him to rest his coffee on the table, offering him an embarrassed apology.
“PTSD?” Aurora asked.
“I can’t forget it,” Rori said, pulling herself back from his hold to look at his face. “I don’t want to forget it. This last week has been so intense and I think I just got overwhelmed by it all. Ask me again.”
Harry nodded and they both increased their pace to a light jog, soon reaching the edge of the park and crossing the street. They both sighed in relief as soon as they stepped into the welcoming warmth of the lobby, smiling at the receptionist before heading towards the bank of elevators. Rori blew warm air onto the tips of her fingers, while Harry rubbed his hands together and they both laughed at each other’s bright red faces. When the elevator opened on the penthouse, they stepped out to find everyone exactly where they’d left them two hours ago.
“Sounds perfect.”
“Because it was a last minute idea,” Rori said. “Besides, I had fun dad. For the first time in weeks I had fun, so don’t you dare ruin this for me.”
“It’s certainly never boring,” Harry joked.
“Are you crazy? This is going to be incredible for your profile.”
“You did?” Aurora asked. “I didn’t know that.”
Aurora broke into a fit of laughter at that, her head falling forward to rest against his shoulder as she gasped for breath.
“Thanks,” Steve replied with a warm smile, “I wanted to be an artist when I was a kid, before the war.”
“Mind if I join?” he murmured, pressing himself against his girlfriend’s back, taking the loofa from her hand and finishing scrubbing the body wash across her stomach and back. Rori chuckled as she turned in his arms, kissing him deeply as he tipped his head under the water to wet his shoulder length curls. She pulled back from the kiss to rub shampoo into his hair, smiling happily as she recalled seeing online that the fans had been calling it his Prince Harry hair.
“Just feels weird, doesn’t it?” Rori whispered, her eyes also glancing to the others, not wanting to upset anyone. “I still don’t really understand what happened and it just doesn’t really feel right that he’s not here.”
“How’s everyone doing tonight?” Harry asked, causing the crowd to roar in response. Harry chuckled before continuing, trying to soak up the feeling of being in front of such a large crowd, knowing it would be a while before he’d get to do this again. “Well I just wanted to take a moment to thank you all for spending your Tuesday night with us, and for being so incredibly supportive of everything we’ve done over the last 5 years. I know we were all meant to be here last month, and I just wanted to take a minute to thank each and every one of you for be so understanding and letting me drop everything to fly to New York. I love you all. The lads and I were talking last night, and we thought you deserved something special to say thank you, so we thought we’d add in an extra song tonight off the new album that’s out tomorrow.” Harry had to pause his speech as the crowd screamed with excitement, having already noted the extra mic stand and stool behind him they were anticipating his next words. “We’re gonna need some extra help with it though so I want you to give a warm welcome to our special guest.”
“I need to go to him,” she told them.
“It was a beautiful video, and a beautiful painting,” Letterman offered.
“Weren’t expecting what my love?” he asked.
“I’ve figured out the perfect way to debut your first solo single,” the older man said in lieu of a greeting.
“Should either of those names mean anything to me?” Harry asked with a chuckle.
“I’m glad,” he said, breathing a sigh of relief at her admission. “So, is art what you want to do with your life?”
“I can reach out to people for you,” Mark said. “Get me a list of people that you’re interested in working with and I’ll see what I can do.”
“I better go help put out the fire,” Aurora muttered to Harry before leaving the table. She followed Steve out of the dining area and into a service corridor. He was pinching the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger as Tony yelled through the phone.
“What about Sky Fire?” Madz offered, “like a play on Aurora Borealis?”
“Do you want to do it?” Mark asked when she fell silent.
“Good thing you’ll never have to find out,” he replied, a soft smile on his face as he lent in to kiss her again. “Happy New Year Rori.”
“We’re almost back,” he said. “Want to jog the last bit?”
“What did he say to you?” Letterman asked with a gentle voice.
When she awoke from the anaesthetic, Tony was sitting beside her bed once again, his hand wrapped around her hand, the other sweeping her hair off her brow.
“And unfortunately, that’s made people even more curious about you,” the older man said sympathetically.
Tony had been banking on the doctors agreeing with him that Aurora was nowhere near healed enough to be flying to another continent only a month after surgery, so he was fuming when they agreed that her abdominal incision was healing nicely, likewise her bicep injury was fine and both her clavicle and scapular were well on the way to mended. Aurora had smirked at him when the doctors had given her the all clear to travel, providing she take it easy and use the painkillers prescribed to her as needed. He had only ground his teeth together, clenching his jaw in annoyance, but knowing that he had no choice but to agree to the trip. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust his daughter, or even Steve for that matter, it was that he knew she was a selfless person and even if she wasn’t up to the trip she would do anything for the people she loved and right now that meant flying to London to ensure Harry wasn’t blaming himself. Despite his objections, he drove the pair to the airport and hugged his daughter tightly on the tarmac before both she and Steve boarded the StarkJet.
“Please let me do this for you,” Tony asked as he watched her internal debate play out across her face. She looked up in response to his tone, and her decision was made when she saw the expression on his face. It was clear as day that he wanted to be able to do something to help her adjust to her new life and feel good about leaving behind everything to live in a foreign country with a stranger.
“Don’t mention it,” Steve replied as they all stepped out of the lift. Steve made a bee line for the kitchen, while Tony and Rori headed to the sofa, piling pillows and blankets together to form a cosy nest for the three of them. The waffles didn’t take too long to prepare and before long Rori was sandwiched between the two men huddled beneath the blankets as the movie began.
They fell quiet as Caroline and Ollie returned to the stage and danced in their seats as Coldplay performed, followed by the two finalists with their winners songs. Before long the hosts were introducing the boys to the stage and the crowd went mad.
“It’s a tattoo,” she replied, holding her arm out so that he could see the fresh ink clearer. “Pretty cool, right? I got it about 2 weeks ago.” The image on the inside of her wrist was of half of Steve’s shield and the right half of the Iron Man helmet, joined together in the middle. “Harry, Louis and I went to this great little tattoo parlour in Philly.”
“Can you get Pops on the phone for me please?” Aurora requested, already chewing on her thumbnail as she continued scrolling through twitter nervously.
“I don’t know, love. I’ll never understand how someone could hurt so many people but I’m just grateful you’re still here.”
“I know dad and I love you for it.”
“Not really,” she sighed. “Sam has me working on this one step at a time thing, so I’m not really looking too far ahead at this point.”
“I’m so glad you get along with the guys,” Harry continued. “It’ll make it so much easier for you to join us on tour.”
“Now Pops and I were in the middle of a very fancy celebratory dinner with the lads so I’m going to hang up the phone now and we’re gonna go back to that. I’m sure Pops will call you back when we get back to the hotel later. I love you.”
I'm so excited for the next chapter. It's the first thing I wrote for this story and it's what started this whole thing so I'm so excited to have finally caught up to it :)
“I’ve been writing a lot,” Rori said. “So, I think I could probably start churning out demos a lot faster than I was last year. Might need you to find me a guitarist and drummer.”
She didn’t respond to his words, but he breathed a sigh of relief when he felt her body relaxing against his, the tension draining from her muscles.
. She smiled as she scrolled through tweet after tweet of fans gushing about their love for not only the album but also for the 5 boys. She felt so much pride for what they had accomplished, having been present for much of the writing and recording of the album she knew just how hard each of them had worked on every single track. She knew they deserved every piece of praise they were receiving now. She texted Harry once she was about halfway through the album.
“You look like something’s bothering you,” Liam said, sitting down beside her and casually throwing an arm across the back of the sofa she was curled up on.
“It’s kind of insane how much everything’s changed in the last 5 years, isn’t it? I mean you and Harry are engaged!”
“I can’t imagine what he’s gone through,” Aurora agreed. “But at least he’s out of it now.”
I'd be coming right back home to you
“Like I was going to wait until morning for the album release. I wanted to see how all the Brit fans were reacting to it before the Americans wake up.”
“Please don’t,” she begged helplessly, raising her left hand in front of her as if it could shield her from what came next.
“Well you have fun on twitter babe, I gotta get back to the interviews.”
They followed Matt further into the building, finding the other members of his band sitting around the studio space. Introductions were made and the rest of the day was spent working on the arrangements for the 2 songs they had already decided on covering. They had been emailing back and forth for much of the last week and the band had already done much of the work, so it was simply a matter of putting the final touches to the instrumentals and by the end of the first day they were ready to start recording. The band invited Aurora and Harry back to Trevor’s house for dinner and they gladly accepted, already enjoying the company of the 4 men. Aurora spent most of the evening with Trevor’s 1 year old perched on her lap until the baby was put to bed. They didn’t stay too late and made plans to meet back in the studio earlier the next morning. Over the next few days they recorded the instrumental tracks for both covers, leaving only the vocal tracks left to lay down for their covers of the Chainsmokers
“Nothing,” Harry answered, his voice tight as he fought back his own tears. “There was no rhyme or reason to why you made it and they didn’t, but I thank God you did. Rori I meant what I said this afternoon; I can’t live without you. I love you.”
“Missed you too El,” Rori replied, gripping tightly to the energetic blonde.
“Sounds wonderful,” Rori agreed, heading over to her chest of drawers to pull out her thick Christmas pajamas and then grabbed Harry’s from his case before joining him in the bathroom. The room was already warming up as it filled with steam and she quickly stripped out of her hoodie and active wear, as did Harry and they both sank into the hot water of the bath. Aurora situated herself between Harry’s legs, leaning back against his chest as his arms wrapped around her waist. She left the brace strapped around her hand and opted to rest it on the lip of the tub instead of taking it off. While she’d shown Harry the scars on her stomach and shoulder, she had yet to show him, or anyone, the mess that was her hand and she still wasn’t ready for him to see it. He hadn’t pushed her, but he had noticed the way she never let him in the bathroom when she went to shower or any other time she needed to take the brace off, and he hoped she would realise soon that he would never be horrified or disgusted by what was under the brace, just as he hadn’t when she’d finally shown him the rest of her scars two weeks ago. As if in answer to her silent fears, he placed soft kisses to both her shoulders, paying special attention to the golf ball sized knot of scar tissue on the back of her left shoulder from the exit wound. She lent her head back against his chest, relaxing into his arms in the warm water.
Aurora kept to herself for most of the day on Christmas Eve and both Tony and Steve gave her space to deal with her mother’s anniversary in whatever way she needed. A large portion of the day was spent in Steve’s art studio and then at the piano playing the same song over and over again, a tune neither men recognised. As the sun began to set, the 16 year old changed into her favourite ugly Christmas sweater and went in search of the two men. She found them in the workshop, Steve sitting on the couch, while Tony flitted from one project to the next, not really able to focus on any of them. They both snapped their heads up upon her entrance.
“Never apologize,” Harry replied. “This was a wonderful surprise and we were going to announce it next week anyway so who cares. I’m just glad you’re here.”
“I guess I’ll forgive you.”
“Well we already set up something with the Maria Stark Foundation to help cover the medical costs of the survivors and pay for the victims funerals,” Tony replied.
Despite missing a member, the tour was a success, continuing on much like the previous one had and after the first few shows, Aurora found that it felt just like old times. They travelled across Europe and along the west coast and into Canada, recording and finalising the new album. Aurora even recorded the piano track for
“Course, kiddo,” Tony replied. “What’s up?”
They stayed at the pub for another few hours, chatting and laughing before Aurora had to leave to go back to the hotel to get ready before dinner. As they were leaving Greg popped out from behind the bar to give both girls a hug goodbye and reminding Rori that he would see her on Saturday night for her birthday dinner with himself, Helen and Rori’s dads.
“And she’s already got plans to see him once we get to London next week for New Year’s,” Tony said.
“Director Fury’s dead and Pops and Aunt Nat have just been declared enemies of the state.”
“I’ll come give you a hand,” Rori offered, earning her a smile from Harry. He kissed her cheek before heading over to hug his stepfather and then throwing himself onto the sofa beside his sister. Rori followed Anne into the kitchen and watched as the older woman filled the kettle under the tap and then put in on to boil.
“Holy shit,” Rori said. “Holy shit. Holy fucking shit Mark!” She placed the call on to speaker, opening up twitter and scrolling through her mentions until she found the one she was looking for.
In the days between Christmas and the New Year, Aurora and Harry spent many hours in the conservatory off the back of the house, watching the snow softly fall in the back garden. Harry would occasionally pull out his acoustic guitar and entertain Rori while she sketched the scene, or they would simply cuddle up under a blanket and talk. The sense of time standing still enveloped the house and allowed for the young couple to remain wrapped up in each other, revelling in the cosy winter atmosphere. On the afternoon of New Year’s Eve, Harry loaded up the car and they said goodbye to Anne and Robin before driving down to London. They arrived well after sunset and while Harry carried in their bags as soon as they arrived at his house, Aurora headed to the bathroom to shower and wash her hair to get ready for the party they were both attending later that evening. She was mostly finished, her hair washed, and legs shaved, when the glass door opened, and Harry joined her under the warm spray.
“I’m pretty fond of him too,” Rori admitted. “You raised an incredible man.”
“See you tomorrow.”
“Thanks, El,” Rori replied, smiling brightly back at her best friend as the show returned from the ad break.
“What was this week’s video again?” Louise asked, never able to keep up with which project her talented young daughter was working on at any given moment.
“He pouts?” Rori laughed, her heart swelling to know that her boyfriend and unofficial big brother had missed her while she was home recovering.
“I love you too,” he said.
He surprised her by asking his own question instead of answering. “What’s your opening line?”
“You don’t have to apologize,” Tony said softly. “I’m just glad nothing happened. Although I can tell you right now, tomorrow I’m gonna find out who this Spider-Man is because if he’s gonna be out there doing the crime fighting thing he’s gonna need a real suit and back up or he’s gonna get himself killed.”
By the time the last song came to an end, Aurora made her way out of the crowd and towards the backstage tent, throwing her arms around Harry once he made his way of the stage.
“Aurora Stark, 5 minutes.”
“I’m talking to Aurora, Lou,” Harry explained, drawing his friend’s attention to the girl sitting next to him.
Tony pulled her back into another hug. “Merry Christmas Kid.”
Something she often did with tracks she wrote for other artists was to record her own version and a few months after they released their track, she would release her version on her YouTube channel; a series she called
The three Manzano brothers arrived the following morning and within the hour, the four of them were already set up in Aurora’s studio downstairs. As with her collaboration with Our Last Night, much of the work had been done via email over the previous weeks, so they got straight in to running through the arrangements for their covers of Zedd’s
“Are they famous?” Ella asked, “because I know that I’m the only one you stayed in contact with after you moved to the states so it’s no one from school.”
“You did? How come I never knew?”
“Did I tell you how beautiful you look tonight?” Harry asked, leaning in the suck on the skin below her ear.
Aurora smiled brightly, turning back to face the stage, Anne’s arms still wrapped around her as they stood side by side. Towards the end of the song, Harry passed by their section of the crowd and after spotting them together he blew a kiss, happy beyond words to see his mum holding onto his girl and keeping her safe.
“Can you too stop sucking face so we can go?” Louis asked with a laugh, interrupting the couple’s reunion.

“Love you too, Rors.”
“Boys, what a performance,” he said when he reached them. “Are you sure you don’t want to change your mind and tour the new album?”
“Miss Stark, Mark Hill is on his way up to see you,” JARVIS announced.
“You and Harry might want to discuss getting out in front of the dating rumours,” he told her, holding out his phone to show her a tweet thread from one of Harry’s fans.
“Please don’t apologise,” Harry replied. “Not your fault.”
“You too,” Ella stammered, before Aurora took pity on her best friend and took her around the room, introducing her to everyone and helping to smooth out the awkwardness. While they were all sat around in the green room, Aurora tucked into Harry’s side as he talked with Zayn, her phone chirped and she fished it out of her pocket to see a text from Mark.
, a security guard came to escort Aurora backstage. As the song came to an end there was a lull and while Harry stepped out towards the front of the stage to talk with the crowd, Louis went jogging off stage towards where Rori was now waiting in the wings.
The Instagram posts for this chapter will be combined with the next chapter :)
“Right away sir.”
“Yeah,” Rori agreed. “I’m exhausted but it’s too cold to stay out any longer.”
I've made another fake Instagram post for this chapter so head over and check that out
“Yeah, I know J, I already saw that online. I’m looking for more specifics.”
“Me either,” Rori agreed. “But honestly I just had so much fun, so thank you for inviting me down here.”
“I’m not sure how to break this so I’m just going to say it,” Dan said, his gaze nervously flitting to Harry before he looked away. “The news is reporting that there’s been a mass shooting at Columbia University in New York.”
“Just as long as you don’t forget to have a life of your own while your managing mine.”
“Quit hogging her mate,” Louis complained after a few minutes. “I want a hug too.”
“Right,” Sam nodded. “You did good Harry.” He reached out to touch Aurora’s shoulder, but she flinched away, burrowing closer against Harry. “Rori, it’s Sam. You’re safe. There isn’t anyone here who’s going to hurt you. You’re safe Aurora.” His voice was low and level, calmer than Harry knows he was when he was trying to soothe her before Sam arrived. “Harry’s here,” Sam continued. “Can you hear his heartbeat? Can you feel his breathe? I need you to try and breath with him kiddo.” Sam looked up at Harry as he spoke. “Need you to steady your breathing too, Harry, otherwise this isn’t going to help much.”
The couple climbed out of the car, joining the other 4 boys as they walked towards the front door of the house. Harry squeezed his girlfriends’ hand in his while Liam knocked on the door. Anne threw open the door with a wide smile, welcoming the boys into her home. Harry bounded forward, sweeping his mother into a bruising hug. “So good to have you home, love,” she murmured into her sons’ curls.
Aurora’s knee bounced nervously as the van pulled up out the front of Harry’s family home. He reached across to place a comforting hand on her thigh, stilling the anxious movement. “Just be yourself,” he whispered in her ear as the other boys climbed out of the van. “They’ll love you; I promise.”
Harrys stayed for the rest of the week, enjoying spending time with Rori without the pressure and constant scheduling of being on tour. He also enjoyed spending time with her family. He would sit with Rori while she sketched on the sofa in Tony’s workshop, watching her father and Peter working away on whatever project had their attention at any given moment. He’d chat with Rori while she drew, her feet perched in his lap and one of his hands resting softly on her thigh. Sometimes she’d be sketching Tony and Peter, sometimes it was Harry and sometimes it was a landscape she could see only in her mind. They reminisced about the tour, recounting the funnier stories for Peter who lapped it all up eagerly. Every morning the couple would head downstairs to the gym, where Rori would run on the treadmill and Harry would use the weights. Steve would join them most mornings and there were always other members of the team floating in and out of the space. On the Wednesday, Rori started back at Columbia and Harry caught the subway with her, wandering the campus and grabbing a coffee at one of the small cafes while she attended her two classes for the day. When she was finished, the pair walked back to the tower through Central Park, taking their time in the autumn sunshine. Eventually Harry had to leave for California, and while Aurora tried to pretend she wasn’t upset to see him go, she lasted only until he was standing in front of the lift with his bag slung over his shoulder. Happy was waiting with the car downstairs and they had agreed to say their goodbyes in private, both knowing that if Aurora went to the airport with Harry, they would be on every gossip blog by morning.
“If you two would like to stop eating each other’s faces,” the blonde chuckled, “the rest of us are ready for cake.”
“JARVIS?” Tony said, “que up The Santa Clause in the living room please.”
“I’ve wanted to do that all night,” he whispered against her lips when they pulled apart, foreheads resting against each other as their breath mixed together between them.
“Love you too.”
“So, I just saw twitter,” she said in lieu of a greeting.
She was ushered to her seat during the next commercial break and both Steve and Tony pulled her into crushing hugs, with matching grins of pride stretching across their faces.
“and then they asked for your help to announce their engagement?”
Harry smiled widely. “Just remember that and you’ll be fine,” he promised.
Tony nodded his agreement, placing his arm around his daughter and pulling her against his side.
“Thank you, Mark. I think I needed to hear that today.”
On the 2
“You know if you want to convince me to stop be so overbearing maybe don’t remind me of the other time you almost died.
“Should I be worried about what’s going on over here?” he asked, wrapping and arm around their shoulders.
Tony turned in his seat to watch them pass by the living room. “Just going for a run in Central Park,” Aurora explained.
“Dinner and a games night apparently.”
“God there’s nothing better,” Harry agreed, only peeling his eyes away from his girl when they were joined by another exec wanting to wish them well.
While he was talking, Aurora scrolled across a tweet about her and she quickly read it out to Harry.
Aurora nodded in agreement. “Did you read all the responses?” she asked him.
Not to be needy on main but please leave comments, I'm really enjoying this story but writing can be a bit of a lonely endeavour so it really helps to know that people are liking the story
(I feel it, I feel it)
Aurora nodded a let Harry lead her out of the room.
Aurora pulled him in for a quick kiss, tucking one of his curls back into place and wished him good luck one last before taking Ella’s hand and heading towards where Anne had saved their seats for them.
“I’m good,” Rori replied with a small smile.
“I’m gonna reply,” she said.
Harry’s smile grew bigger somehow in response, before leaving to find the rest of his band in the crowd and Aurora went in search of her dads.
“Thank you, Mumma,” Rori replied, blushing slightly when Anne kissed her cheek and ran her hand along her right arm. “You and Harry wrote that together?”
“No,” Rori replied again. “Enough. These are all rubbish.”
“With all the songs that you’ve written, that other artists are now starting to have success with, why is it that your band have never recorded any of them for yourselves?”
“Hydra infiltrated SHIELD and they’ve been pulling the strings since the beginning,” Tony explained. “Steve figured it out and they tried to kill him for it, but you know your Pops, he’s too stubborn so now Hydras done.”
“Always need you,” he murmured in reply.
“I don’t even know how to process this,” Rori said, not sure if she was speaking to Harry or Mark or just speaking out loud for the sake of it. She was freaking out and started scrolling through the replies to the tweet.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I hope you’re right,” Rori replied nervously.
“I was wondering if we could maybe a watch a movie together?”
Louis tried to smile innocently. “Not sure what you’re talking about mate.”
“Just a little overwhelmed by the response,” Rori replied, taking a deep breath to calm her emotions. “It doesn’t feel real.”
I think I might give up everything, just ask me to
After quickly slipping on some work out clothes, they both pulled on their hoodies and headed for the elevator.
“Huh,” Nick replied, sipping at his own drink and the conversation turned to other things.
There's another series of fake Instagram posts for this chapter
“Joining a band seems like a pretty good way to fit in at a school filled with performers and artists,” Tony pointed out.
“I love you Harry,” she continued. “I love you so much, I was so scared.”
She returned his smile, adjusting her headphones. “Let’s do it,” she said, clearing her throat before the familiar sound of her keys filled their ears.
After the meal was long gone and the team were exchanging stories over empty glasses, Aurora excused herself to go to the bathroom. Harry began to worry when she’d been gone a little too long and went off in search of his fiancé. With JARVIS’ help, he found her in her art studio, sitting on the bench seat against the window staring out over Central Park and the setting sun.
“I think he’s just trying not to overwhelm you… or himself,” Steve replied. “He doesn’t want to come on too strong and have you run away.”
“It’s gonna break their hearts though,” Harry mumbled. “Hate the thought of hurting them after they’ve given me my dreams.”
“Sometimes I wonder,” Tony laughed in response. “Go have fun kiddo. You’ve earned it.”
“You’re not going to start building a sleeve like Harry’s next, are you?” Steve asked, joining the conversation and sitting down next to Aurora on the sofa.
“I think I’d genuinely die of shock if you ever arrived anywhere on time,” Aurora replied when they both pulled apart and sat down at the table. Greg appeared a few moments later with a coke for Ella and a sprite for Rori, the two girls too predictable for him to need their drink orders. “Thanks Greg,” Rori cheered, taking a sip of her drink.
“I’d love that,” Aurora replied while the boys both tried not to sigh at his comments. “You know I always dreamed of auditioning when I was kid.”
She nodded in agreement, pressing her cheek back against his chest, finding comfort in the soft hum emanating from the Arc reactor lodged next to her ear. By the time Harry and Steve returned, Aurora was sleeping soundly, and Tony was reading up on PTSD treatments on his phone. Steve passed him a coffee, placing a kiss on to his temple before slipping into the seat next to him. Harry sunk into the empty seat on the other side of Rori’s hospital bed, pulling out his own phone to update the boys on Rori’s condition and letting them know that she was being discharged later that afternoon.
“Hi,” Rori echoed, “It’s nice to meet you Louis.”
Aurora nodded and ran her right hand over the white blouse she was wearing, smoothing it out. She’d taken off the sling, while her hand remained in its bulky brace and tucked against her ribs to keep her shoulder or collarbone from hurting. She took a deep breath and turned back towards the stage to watch as the crew set up 5 mic stands in front of 5 stools and Harry’s voice filled the arena.
Harry pulled her in for one last desperate kiss before turning and walking back to Niall. He didn’t turn back this time and Aurora held her breath until he disappeared from view. As soon as he was gone, she let the sobs break through her chest, slowly walking through the terminal towards her own gate. She waited in the private lounge until her flight was ready and then made her way on board, settling into her first class seat. She put on her headphones and shuffled
“What part of take it easy translates to an arena performance for you?” he yelled when Steve answered the phone.
“He was brainwashed by Hydra but he’s breaking out of it,” Steve replied, “and besides I’ve got your dad for backup this time.”
“Nah, but in all seriousness, he’s a great bloke,” Louis told her and before she could reply he was quickly distracted by someone passing by and he walked away without another word. Aurora was a little shocked and stared off after Louis as he disappeared into the crowd.
“I think you’re already doing it,” Sam replied calmly. “You’re there when she needs you, reminding her that she’s not alone.”
“You doing ok?” Tony asked softly.
more glimpses of life in the tower and Rori at school
“Do you feel comfortable talking about what happened to her?” David asked gently. “How is it that you finally met your father and moved here to New York?”
It had been 5 weeks since Aurora had moved into Stark Tower and while the three of them had quickly adjusted to living together, today was a disruption to the easy going atmosphere that usually settled over the penthouse.
“Just look around.”
was always an emotional day. They headed back to the tower after lunch, stopping at Aurora’s favourite bakery along the way to pick up donuts for everyone and an apricot Danish for Rori.
“I grew up in south London and the reason the world didn’t know about me is because for most of my life I’ve been no one,” Rori began, chuckling nervously before continuing. “I lived with my mum until I was 15 and I didn’t know that Tony Stark was my dad and he didn’t know I existed until I was 16 and I moved to New York.”
“I got so used to see you every day,” she admitted, her face pressed into his neck. “I don’t want to say goodbye.”
When the boys returned to the green room, she was struck again by how weird it was for there only to be the four of them now and she frowned. The entire time she had known Harry it had been him and the four boys, but now for Zayn to be gone, she still didn’t quite understand. She remembered when Harry had called her from the road, the night that Zayn had walked out on them. He’d been in tears and her heart had broken as she stayed on the phone with him for hours, promising that it would be ok. That no matter what happened with the band, that she would be there, and he would be ok. They had talked about restructuring songs, splitting up Zayn’s parts between the four of them and after they’d hung up, she had cried. While she and Zayn had not been best friends like she was with Louis, and they hadn’t gotten along quite as easily as she did with Liam or Niall, she had still grown to think of him as her brother, as she had with all of them. He was always quieter than the others and sometimes when the chaos of the tour had become just a little too much, the two of them would hide away somewhere quiet to relax and decompress. She’d tried to call him a few days after he’d left, but he’d ignored her call, probably assuming that she would have sided with Harry, like a child having to pick which parent to live with after the divorce. In truth she’d just wanted to make sure her friend was ok. It had been months now and she still hadn’t heard from him. She’d sent texts and twitter dm’s, trying to explain that she just wanted to talk and that she missed him, but it had all gone unanswered. The only contact any of them had had with him since March had been when Louis had argued with him on twitter in April. All of this was running through her head as the boys piled into the green room, flopping down on sofas and attempting to relax before they were needed on stage in a little over an hour. Harry placed a kiss on her cheek as he walked past her towards where Lou was waiting to fix his hair for the show.
“It was your dad’s idea,” Harry replied, reaching out to take one of her hands in his, playing with her fingers absently as they spoke.
“I don’t know,” Rori said, looking to Harry hesitantly.
“Probably not,” Rori said. “But he’s worth it. I like who I am with him. I don’t have to worry that he’s only with me because of my name, he’d feel the same way about Aurora Bennett as he does about Aurora Stark.”
Aurora looked up at the man leaning in the doorway to her bedroom, knocking gently on the exposed wood.
“OK well I’ll reach out and see if we can lock down a time for you to fly to Ohio. You don’t have a lot of free time though. You’re still planning to join Harry on tour as soon as classes finish?”
Aurora's solo work for the rest of the fic -
“Aurora Stark, you’re on in 10,” a voice shouted and Rori felt her heartbeat accelerate in response. She was so caught up in her panic that at first, she was unaware that someone had sat down next to her on the floor.
“Just like her dad,” Steve murmured in his ear.
“Is he there with you?” Aurora asked, “Can I talk to him?”
“Really?” Rori gasped. “But the school year starts in like 2 weeks.”
“Sorry I’m late,” the blonde yelled as she barrelled into the pub, a hurricane of energy as always. Aurora laughed as Ella rushed toward her and she stood just in time to catch the other girl in a hug.
Following her parents advise, Aurora tried to put any thoughts of Hydra or Sergeant Barnes out her mind and enjoy her summer, so at the end of the week, she and Harry flew to Sweden as planned for the European leg of the tour. July saw them take in so many cities across Europe that Aurora had never visited before and she went out exploring as much as she could while Harry and the boys were rehearsing. Harry tried to join her whenever possible, but the fans made it difficult for any of the boys to take in the usual tourist attractions and Aurora found herself very grateful that while she was recognised every so often, most people didn’t know who she was and for the most part the fans didn’t really care who she was. After Sweden they had travelled through Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and Portugal. They left Europe in mid-July and with 2 weeks off before the North American leg began at the start of August, most of the band headed off to see family while Harry joined Aurora in LA.
“But you did experience something pretty traumatic.”
“It’s so nice to meet you all,” Rori offered, “Thanks for inviting me.”
“Thanks Harry,” Mark said. “Anyway, you too enjoy the rest of your day and I’ll talk to you in a few days Rori.”
“You’re not allowed to freak out, Ok?”
“I don’t know how to talk about it. I don’t even want to think about it.”
“Aurora,” Pepper replied. “Aurora Bennett. She’s 16 and living in foster care after her mother Louise died 6 months ago. She says she doesn’t want anything from you. She doesn’t want money or to meet you or anything, all she asked for was that you sign a few forms to officially relinquish your parental rights so that she can be emancipated and get out of foster care.”
“It appears that SHIELD has classified them both as fugitives and they are wanted on charges of domestic terrorism and espionage.”
At first, she couldn’t speak, still gasping for breath as she shook her head no, trying to answer her fathers panicked questions until slowly her hysteria died down enough for her to stammer out an explanation.
“Study hard. Goodluck with your exams.”
“You ready to deal with all of that?” Mark asked.
“Yeah,” Rori smiled. “Exactly what I needed. Bit cold out though.”
She stayed by his side as he chatted with people for the better part of an hour, occasionally joining in on his conversations when she knew the person, or sometimes holding her own conversation with someone else. Louis was never far from her side, enjoying hanging out with his bestie. After a while Simon Cowell arrived at the party and made his way over towards the three of them.
“Which one?” Rori asked.
“I think I’d like to plead the fifth your honour,” she replied. “But if it makes you feel better, you were my mum’s favourite. She used to say you seemed like you’d be a wonderfully polite young man.”
They continued to chat, laughing as they filled each other in on the Christmas’ with their families until Niall finally arrived a little over half an hour later. The boat pushed from the wharf around 10.30 and the party was swarming on the decks as the clock neared midnight. Since she wasn’t drinking, Aurora was feeling the chill of the winter wind blowing up off the water and headed into the spacious cabin for a while to warm up, knowing she would want to go back out when the fireworks started at midnight. She was sitting on a bench seat along a long bank of windows looking out at the city sliding past on the riverbank as she slowly felt her hands warming back up when Nick Grimshaw sat down next to her.
with a small crowd of her friends and family assembled underneath it. The crowd included the Avengers, Pepper and Happy, Peter and May, her parents and two new faces; one of which she recognised from photos to be Bucky Barnes, while the other she assumed to be the newest recruit to the team, Sam Wilson. Rori quickly found herself sandwiched between both of her fathers as they threw their arms around her, crushing her in a warm group hug. She laughed as they finally let her go. “I missed you too,” she chuckled, allowing them to lead her further into the room to be passed from one hug to the next as everyone took their turn to welcome her home.
Harry chuckled again, lacing their fingers together and tugging her reluctantly back into the main room. Louis and Liam wolf whistled as the pair re-emerged, causing the blush to return to both of their cheeks. “Yeah alright,” Harry said, “lay off.”
“Excited,” Rori replied, pulling back from the hug with a matching grin on her own face. “Missed you too, Ni.”
“Thank you,” she replied.
Anne started tearing up as she wrapped her arms around Aurora. “I’m so glad you’re here.”
The moment the door closed behind them; Aurora burst into tears. She’d been holding it in until that moment, knowing that if she cracked in front of any of the three men hovering over her, she would only cause them to worry and she knew that they had worried enough in the past few days to last a lifetime.
“How about we take it one day at a time? Don’t get yourself worked up about the maybes and just focus on putting one foot in front of the other.”
They stood around chatting for a little while before Anne looked at her watch and decided that they should go find their seats and say hello to the other parents before the show starts.
“Missed you too Liam,” Rori whispered back, returning his tight hug before pulling back and walking over towards her finance and their best friend. Niall had already walked over to them ahead of her and thrown his arms around their shoulders.
The stage was dark as she stepped out to stand before the microphone stand, a cellist and violinist sitting behind her over each shoulder, the final member of her backing band sat at a beautiful grand piano off to the right of stage. The lights lifted as the opening notes rang out and Aurora allowed herself a brief moment to look out across the crowd before she began the opening line. Harry’s advice proved to be correct; as soon as she made it through that first line the rest of the song poured out of her.
And the song SkyFire performed for Rori's Maid of Honor speech was I'll Have You by Andie Case, who is my inspiration for Rori's music career https://youtu.be/F4DL31uxPIU
“Hey,” Tony said, placing a hand under her chin to lift her eyes to meet his. “One step at a time, remember? Now just breath with me.”
At first Tony didn’t respond and instead he simply watched is daughter, trying to read her expression and gauge what her response would be to his reply. “I didn’t want to go all out,” he explained. “I didn’t know if you’d want to celebrate it to be honest.”
“How about we take it slow?” Harry suggested, his hands returning to the zipper while his eyes locked with hers. She nodded and he slowly lowered the zipper until the dress fell off her shoulder. As the navy blue material slid aside, Harry’s eyes roamed over the exposed skin, a long thin scar followed the curve of her collarbone for about 6 or 7cm leading up to a sunken divot in her shoulder, no bigger than a dime. He lent forward to gently press his lips to the edge of the now healed wound and Aurora shivered. “Is this ok?” he murmured against her skin.
Right now I'm completely defenceless
“I was nervous to meet you,” Aurora admitted with a small chuckle. “I should have known you’d be so welcoming.”
“Thanks,” Rori whispered. “I like you too.”
“Should I be worried?” Rori asked, lifting her head up to look into his eyes.
“Ok,” Harry said. “Today’s probably not the best day to tackle those fears so what do you say we go for a run. Just the two of us. We can run until we’re dead on our feet and then curl up in bed and watch The Santa Claus.”
Don’t forget to leave a comment :)
Pepper looked across the table to where Rhodey was watching the pair gasp for breath, Rori reaching out to grab onto Tony’s shoulder as if to steady herself. As if sensing Peppers gaze on him, Rhodey looked up and the two shared a soft smile at their friends’ joy. They had both been a part of Tony’s life for such a long time and had seen him at his lowest point, so to see him now, with a family that brought him such joy, was the best Christmas present either of them could have possibly received.
“But you’re still here,” Sam reminded her. “You didn’t die, and they still have you here.”
“Tony she’s right,” Steve mumbled, causing his husband to level him with a glare.
“I can make them if you want,” Steve offered, earning a soft smile from the teenager.
“Holy Shit!” she said, pulling Harry’s attention away from the romcom on the screen.
“Let’s agree that we’re both lucky?” He chuckled against her lips. “Now shush. No more talking, just let me show you how much I missed you.”
Harry had spent the morning of Christmas Eve taking Anne and Robin to the holiday market in Union Square. He was happy to spend time with his mum and stepdad, but also wanted to be able to give Aurora her space, knowing that December 24
Following the show, everyone headed back to the green room and drinks were flowing as they all just hung out. After a while, Steve decided to leave the kids to have their fun and made his way across the room to where Rori was sitting on Harry’s lap happily chatting with Louis while Harry was talking with a member of the crew.
“Then why are you crying love?” he chuckled.
A section had been roped off at the front of the crowd for all the family member and Steve and Rori were in amongst them for most of the show. Steve found himself smiling at how much fun Aurora was having dancing with Louis and Harry’s sisters, and they were all singing along loudly as the boys whipped the crowd into a frenzy. Towards the end of the show, just before the boys started singing
“Fans,” she began, “fans have been posting videos from the last few shows and Harry’s a mess. He’s hurting and it’s my fault.”
“You’re my little girl,” Tony sighed, taking her hand and leading her over to sit down on the sofa. “I know you were a fully functioning 16 year old by the time you showed up in my life, but in my head, you’re always going to be my little girl and I’m supposed to protect you.”
“They were sucking face but still fully clothed so we’re all good.”
“Stop googling the answers.”
Rori chewed on her bottom lip for a moment before quickly unlocking her phone and copying out the phone number at the bottom of the flyer.
Don't forget to leave a comment :)
“That would be really nice,” she replied. “Thanks Steve.”
“What was that summer like for you personally?”
started to play. While the song filled her headphones, she opened up new tabs, logging into Twitter to see how the fans were reacting to
“I’ll get a meeting organized,” Pepper promised. “Do you want to fly to London, or shall I have her flown here?”
An hour before the show was set to start, the boys’ families started to arrive, coming first backstage to wish them all good luck and then heading out to take their seats in the audience. Aurora hugged each of Louis’ sisters when they arrived, before his mother pulled her aside.
“Oh Harry,” Rori sighed, wrapping her arms around her boyfriend and pulling him tightly against her. “They’ll be upset but they’ll support you guys no matter what happens. So will I.”
As everyone began to shout out the countdown, Harry spun Aurora in his arms so that she was facing him, kissing her deeply as the countdown reached one, and everyone screamed out wishes of happy new year. Harry blocked it all out, focused entirely on the beautiful woman in his arms. They were both so swept up in their kiss that neither realised that the fireworks display had started until they pulled apart. “Happy New Year my love,” Harry murmured in her ear as he quickly spun her back around. He heard her giggle as she moved and he returned to his previous position, holding her tight with his chin on her shoulder. The fireworks burst against the night sky and Aurora’s laughter died on her lips. Due to the way his was pressed against her from hip to shoulder, he instantly felt the change when she froze, her breathe sticking in her throat as her heart began to thunder in her chest. Before he could ask, she was spinning around to bury her face in his chest, her chest heaving as she gasped for air and trembled in his arms. It took him a brief moment to realise what was happening but as soon as his thoughts caught up with him, he bent down, scooping Rori into his arms and rushing from the room. As the elevator doors closed behind him, the sound of the fireworks was muffled but he didn’t stop until he reached the soundproof booth of the recording studio, dropping down onto the sofa in the corner of the room, Aurora still cradled in his arms as he attempted to calm her.
Reluctantly Harry had agreed and followed Steve out of the room and down the hall.
Christmas in Avengers tower that year was a big event. It was the second Christmas the group was spending together and as such they were very comfortable around each other and excited to spend the holiday as a family. Aurora, Natasha and Bruce had put up the tree on the first weekend of December and everyone had helped with the decorating over mugs of hot chocolate. JARVIS provided a steady stream of festive music throughout the month and there were bells, garlands and boughs of holly strung across every surface of the penthouse. Throughout the entirety of December, either Aurora or Steve filled the kitchen with the smells of gingerbread cookies, pecan pies, yule logs, mince pies and Christmas puddings. In the final week leading up to Christmas Aurora sat her first university exams, feeling utterly relieved when they were finally over. She and Harry had been texting and FaceTiming constantly since meeting the previous month, and she was growing more and more attached to the pop star.
“No, you’re not,” Liam pressed, his eyes flicking around the room to make sure no one was listening to their conversation. “Talk to me.”
“Happy New Year Harry.”
As soon as Louis ended their hug, Aurora found Harry’s arm instantly around her waist and it remained there for most of the next 3 hours until the boys took to the stage. Aurora watched from side of stage, a huge grin on her face for the entire show, secure in the fact that she had made the right decision to be there as she watched Harry smiling and dancing across the stage. Gone was the haunting look from his face that had been present in every fan video from the previous shows and back was the man who loved performing more than anything else in the world.
“Enough of that, spill. Who is it?”
Harry joined them after a few minutes more of conversation, pulling Aurora against his chest with an arm slung low around her waist and they spent the rest of the afternoon before the show chatting with everyone and catching up. There was no sadness in this being the last show, and instead everyone was simply enjoying celebrating the last 5 years of friendships.
“Tony?” Pepper asked softly as she took a seat beside him on the sofa. “There’s something I need to talk to you about.”
“Sorry to interrupt your afternoon,” Mark said when they took a seat. “Probably should have called ahead.”
“Not in New York, you haven’t!” Tony retorted.
They did as they were told, heading down the hallway towards Aurora’s room and the large bathroom leading off from it.
“9 weeks,” Harry whispered. “9 weeks and I’ll be back.”
The nightmares started the first night after Harry left to finish the tour. Aurora woke up screaming and JARVIS immediately alerted Tony and Steve, prompting them to rush to their daughters’ room. She was sitting up in the middle of her bed, drenched in sweat and sobbing in the darkness, her bed sheets tangled around her legs. At first, she jerked away from their hands, before realising who they were and throwing herself into Steve’s arms. Tony ran a gentle hand up and down her back as the pair attempted to sooth her.
Tony eased himself off of the bed and made his way down the hall towards the kitchen, startled to find Sam sitting at the island bench with a mug of coffee in front of him. “Just made a fresh pot,” he said, gesturing the coffee machine nearby.
Tony was quiet for a moment as he looked at her. “What’s making you hesitate?”
Aurora cringed, mouthing an apology to her father who waved it off before standing and leaving the room, knowing that his husband would want to yell and rant for a bit first before he was ready to listen to reason.
“Get away from her,” Tony warned, his voice low and terrifying as he trained the suits weapons on the man in front of her. Aurora scrambled to her feet, throwing her hands out in a peaceful gesture.
“Aurora?” Harry gasped, frozen in place for a brief moment before quickly closing the distance between the two of them. He pulled her into his arms, cautious of her injuries, but desperate to hold have her as close as possible. She buried her head in his chest while he placed kisses to her hair. “God, I missed you,” he sighed. “Can’t believe you’re here.”
Harry flew back to New York with Rori on the 16
“You were so incredible up there kid,” Tony said, pulling away from the hug as Rori settled into her seat. They enjoyed the remainder of the awards show and as they stood to leave at the end, Rori turned to face the two men.
“Merry Christmas sweetheart,” Anne called out once Rori closed the car door behind her and crossed the small front garden to greet the older women. Harry joined them a moment later with Rori’s bags in his arms and Anne lead them both into the house. Even though they’d only been outside for a few moments, Aurora’s nose was red from the cold and she gratefully removed her coat, hanging it on the hooks in the entry hall. They continued on towards the kitchen from which Aurora could smell the roast in the oven. Robin was standing in the kitchen, waiting for the kettle to boil as he prepared cups of tea for the four of them, and he happily hugged Aurora in greeting before turning back his task. Once the tea was ready, they all sat down around the kitchen table, catching each other up on everything since Aurora had last visited during the summer.
“Ask me again,” Rori repeated, smiling back at him through her teary eyes.
“Of course you don’t,” Harry chuckled. “It’s getting late, love,” he added, turning to face Rori. “And by the looks of it, tomorrow’s gonna be a busy one so what do you say we turn in?”
“Can you believe we’re back here again?” Ella asked. “5 years later and this time we’re backstage.”
“Thank you, love,” Harry replied. “I think we all feel really grateful, you know, but I should be the one congratulating you. I mean it’s not often someone debuts their solo career on national tv.”
Aurora had an incredible night; unlike the previous year she was able to enjoy the evening without the crushing anxiety she had been under with the pressure of her first performance. Instead, she was able to play the role of dotting girlfriend, a role she absolutely loved. She cheered loudly when the boys won each of their three awards for the evening, kissing Harry when each win was announced before he made his way up onto the stage with the other boys to thank their fans. When they performed Night Changes, Aurora sat in the front row in awe, her eyes glossy with unshed tears and her face full of the love and pride she felt for the man she was lucky enough to have called hers for the last year. When the show finally came to an end, Harry and Rori said goodnight to the others as the boys headed to one of the afterparties. The young couple chose to skip the party and headed back to the hotel instead to spend some much needed time together before Aurora flew back to New York the next day.
“Don’t be embarrassed, love.” Harry reached forward pulling her hand from her face, not letting go as their joined hands rested in her lap. “I’m flattered.”
“Missed you too Lou,” Rori replied. “Sorry I scared you.”
Harry chuckled, tucking her hair behind her ear. “How likely are your dads to kill me?”
“Lou…” Harry began, a warning tone in his voice.
“No, no, no, no,” she stammered, “He didn’t attack me. He saved me.” She could imagine the look of confusion she would see on her fathers face if it wasn’t shielded behind the Iron Man faceplate.
Aurora looked up from her plate, glancing around the table to see everyone’s eyes on her, expectant. “Uhhhh,” she mumbled. “I just wanted to talk to you all at the same time, so I didn’t have to repeat myself.”
She was barely holding onto consciousness when Steve found her. He hadn’t even taken the time to suit up when the alert rang out through the tower, sparing only enough time to grab his shield before he was running for the balcony, Tony meeting him there in the Iron Man suit. They flew together, covering the distance in mere minutes, arriving on the campus to hear the discharging of an automatic weapon and the screaming of victims. The police arrived hot on their tales and the couple shared a brief moment to coordinate before heading into the sprawling campus. Tony would seek out the shooter, while Steve would head for the library to find their daughter. The live broadcast from Aurora's watch was playing out over their comms link, so Steve could hear the injured wails surrounding his daughter. His heart had lurched when he’d heard her beg for her life, a sound he knew he would hear in his nightmares, but since then she had been silent. He tried not to think about what that meant, pushing his muscles to the extreme as he sprinted across the campus.
“I just keep waiting for you…” she said eventually.
“I could warm you up,” Harry offered, lifting his head to kiss up along her neck towards her jaw.
“I’m sorry, they’ve what now?”
“You just need time, love,” he soothed. “It’s only been a week. You can’t be so hard on yourself. Talking with Sam seems to help, so keep doing that and I’ll speak to management about getting out of the interviews we’ve got scheduled for the rest of the year. I’ll finish out the shows and then come straight back.”
“We can stay here as long as you need,” Harry promised, kissing her hair as he felt her relaxing in his hold.
Aurora laughed loudly, letting him lead her into the venue, Steve following in their wake with a soft chuckle, glad to hear her laughter again after the last month. When they reached the green room, Liam saw them enter the room first and his eyes quickly flicked towards where Harry and Louis were chatting, facing away from the door. He smiled widely, running forward to quickly hug her, trying to remain quiet so as not to ruin the surprise and whispered in Rori’s ear. “So good to see you. I missed you.”
As the final notes of
“You got it sweetheart,” he said. “So, what’s the plan then?”
Aurora flipped open her notebook to the page she scribbled on the previous night and began to sing what she had, humming when she didn’t have the words to fill the gap.
“But after the AMAs they’ll know you as Aurora Stark; Solo Artist, instead of Aurora Stark; Daughter of Tony Stark,” Mark explained. “You trust me, right?”
“You’ll be so busy writing number 1 hits that you won’t have time to miss me,” Harry chuckled, trying to brighten his girlfriend’s mood.
“I don’t know,” Rori shrugged. “I’m still the new kid and trying to find my feet. I mean it’s hasn’t even been two months and I haven’t really made many friends yet or anything.”
“I probably would have gone to the pub,” Rori replied softly. “None of my foster families really cared whether I was there or not, so if I was still in the system I probably would have had Christmas lunch with Helen and Greg or maybe at my best friend’s house instead. I’m not sure. ”
Following the well wishes and goodbyes, the boys performed
“I want to show you Harry,” she whispered, “but no one outside my medical team has seen it yet and it’s just a lot. I’m scared.”
Aurora stepped into her father’s workshop a few days after returning from London, kindly asking JARVIS to turn down the deafeningly loud music. Tony head snapped up from the project he was absorbed in, his eyes meeting with his daughters across the workshop.
“Oi!” Harry yelled with a laugh. “Get your mitts off my girl.”
“First as a solo artist,” she replied, finally feeling her breathing begin to steady. The conversation with this stranger successfully snapping her out of her thought spiral and helping her to collect herself.
“I can do that,” Tony chuckled. “Any idea how you’re gonna use this second chance?”
for the shows Summer Concert series and since it was scheduled to be filmed in Central Park, a mere stones throw away from Avengers Tower, it made sense for them to stay there instead of booking hotel suites for all of them.
he mouthed, to which she replied by shouting back a joyful, “Surprise!”
“I love you too Rori,” Tony murmured, kissing her head and giving her a gentle squeeze.
She made her way off the stage, wiping away her tears, and finding herself not as surprised as she should have been that Harry was standing almost exactly where she had left him.
“What made them stop?” she asked, her voice barely more than a whisper but hope clear in her tone.
“Here at the Late Show we are no stranger to billionaire Tony Stark, who has appeared on the show countless times in our 20 years on the air. In recent years we have come to know him as Iron Man and last year, in the wake of the tragic Battle of New York, he shocked fans when the tabloids broke the story that he had a 17 year old daughter. Since then the Stark family have remained tight lipped about the mysterious young woman, but tonight I am joined by Miss Aurora Stark in her first public interview. Aurora thank you for joining me this evening.”
“He wanted to come,” Tony said, “But things are a bit crazy back home.”
