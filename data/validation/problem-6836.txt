“Stark” Nat says cheerily to Tony who smiles, and to everyone else in the world, it’s just a smile, but Steve knows him, better than anyone and he knows that’s just his awkward and “I want to run away” smile he gives every time he is nervous, like that time in highschool when a girl he was seeing, made him meet his dad at the school door when he came to pick her up, and Tony wasn’t even sure they were dating. He had to shake the man’s hand and smile politely and make small talk before the blond girl hug him and they left. This is the same smile. And honestly? What is it with this facade? Is getting ridiculous.
“It’s going fine, it’s just.. well, you know me, I never really like anything I draw” Nat rolls her eyes.
“I’m going to pretend that you are using that tired tone cause we are on the stairs and not because you are tired of my problem.”
“Hey” he says surprised, he doesn’t remember seeing his friend since the begging of last night’s party. He didn’t ask himself where Steve was, but he was sure he was sleeping in some other bedroom of the house. So it means he came to check on Tony. Even tho he looks like he just woke up.
gets drunk at parties and they kiss people. Girls are all the time kissing each other in truth or dare games or just so someone could snap a video. It’s… part of friendship, Tony guesses.
Aaron ads with a meaningful look and then grins when Tony rolls his eyes. Yeah, he doesn’t know what that pet name was either, he got nervous for some reason. He never uses pet names unless he is being sarcastic or flirting.
that it meant that he likes him? He thinks about Steve laughing, or making that serious frowny face he makes while he draws, or wearing that blue hoodie that Tony loves so much on him, and his heart
“Hi” Steve says but he doesn’t look at him. He looks tired and like he is also having a hangover. But Tony knows Steve doesn’t
“Clint Barton is asleep outside, Bruce Banner is in one of the bedrooms upstairs and I believe Steve Rogers is in the kitchen, sir”
Aaron makes a groaning sound. “Aaron come here” Tony realizes that he is sounding needy and that he is slurring the words a little but well, he is going to let the embarrassment for when he sobers up.
“No! Bruce pay attention would you? If he doesn’t remember and I ask him, then he’ll know! First I have to see if he is acting weird or if he says something that proves me he remembers”
he is going to get mad at him too, so he doesn’t have to be all mad with himself. Aaron and him can share the blame. He is a mess, he is literally a mess. And he has to fix this, he has to fix this crap. He hopes he hadn’t ruined his friendship with Steve as he walks to the campus.
“Oh I remember you! You are the girl who was yelling in the morning! The one the boyfriend cheated on, right?”
"Alright, now get out," Steve says, pushing at his shoulder, gesturing towards the elevator, and it's like someone poured a bucket of cold water on Tony. He blinks at Steve, trying to figure out what he's done in the last ten seconds to fuck this up when he was so overjoyed that he hadn't, and Steve takes pity on him.
Tony parks and it's a pretty great spot- probably nabbed it right after someone left work, maybe this 5 o'clock dinner thing isn't so bad after all- and he holds the door for Steve going into Keens. Steve nods his head in thanks, and Tony gets to look at his ass in those damn burgundy pants. Win-win.
Steve just does without answering and then he says it went straight to voicemail. “It must be out of battery somewhere.” He says but Steve twitches his mouth before looking at his own phone again and Tony knows that he is thinking that someone probably stole it 'cause the house was full of strangers. Tony rolls his eyes as the machine starts working and Steve side smiles cause they never really needed much words to know what the other is thinking.
“Thanks Jarvs” Tony gives him an apologetic smile as he starts walking towards the kitchen. It’s seems pointless to put the now empty glass of water in the sink while there’s so much mess going around but he leaves it there. Steve is pouring himself a glass of cold water from the fridge, and shifts uncomfortably when Tony walks in.
There’s just Steve in his room right now. Sitting at the end of his bed, staying far away from Tony’s puke. Is just them, and the mess of course.
Steve seemed fine when he talked to him in the kitchen wasn’t he? Everything was fine between them right?
“Stark… you are the man” he gets close to Tony to do a fist bump and give him a quick hug and Steve just looks amused at the whole scene. It’s obvious that Clint is happy cause he got laid last night.
Bruce starts to sit up straight. “Tony they are friends. They have been friends since they are kids. You are hallucinating”
, Tony was drunk, completely drunk and Steve wasn’t all that much, so he was supposed to stop this right away. But, Tony had both hands on his face, and when he stopped the kiss to just look down, Steve panicked, thinking maybe Tony did it 'cause he recognized him, but there was no light and it was impossible Tony was seeing him.
“Great party sir” he approaches him and almost attacks him with a glass of water and an aspirin. “Looks like everything went down like you intended to”
So everybody leaves, and as the cleaning service started, Jarvis took care of kicking out every person who was still sleeping somewhere in the house. So Tony decides to go to his parents bedroom to sleep for a while, cause it’s the only one that is clean.
Tony and Bruce are in the lower steps and Steve doesn’t want to look but he does a couple of times during the whole lecture. He pays attention but he founds himself looking at Tony from up there. He is sitting way too close to Bruce, they whisper with each other from time to time, and Tony takes notes and scratches his neck one time and Steve’s cheeks turn red cause he remembers that hand on his face. He promised himself he wouldn’t think of that anymore, ever again, but Tony has this messy hair, and red hoodie, and a coffee on his desk that Steve is sure is not his first one, and God, he can’t keep it out of his head.
There’s people sleeping in different parts of the house still, like the couch in the living room, the bathroom and surprisingly the backyard too. And Tony is sure it rained at some point during the night.
So it’s supposed to be fine! Why is he panicking? Steve is not the kind of person who would make out with a friend just
No, they are best friends since childhood. Steve said a couple of times they were like brothers. Bucky is even more heterosexual than Steve, sometimes even more heterosexual than
Tony kisses his friends but only when he knows everything will be fine afterwards, like, when he is sure there’ll be no awkward moments later or explaining to do. The night he kissed Bruce, it was fun and for a game and they were normal after it, laughing about someone doing something stupid in the game they were playing right one second after that kiss. And nothing was ever uncomfortable. They never wanted to kiss each other again either, it was just for a drinking game.
, you just wait until he goes back to normal. What is Steve going to say anyway? It’s not like Tony ever listens, and he doesn’t want to argue with him, and… certainly
They walk to the classroom and Tony looks over the grandstand and sees Steve in there, with his open book and a pencil ready on his hand. Steve sees him too, but Tony freezes and feels weird for a second so he just looks away trying to find a sit for him and Bruce without waving a hand or smiling or giving Steve time to do it himself. Steve frowns but keeps his attention focused on the teacher coming through the door.
“I need a second coffee” he mutters to himself and walks to the cafeteria instead of his first class.
for God’s sake.There were a thousand alarms sounding in his brain but when tried to push Tony off the part of his brain that was supposed to do
“Exactly! What if they are? Why do you care so much? They will still be our friends, nothing changes. Cut it out. If they are dating
“I guess I want a cup” he leans against the counter and takes his phone out of his pocket. That’s when Tony remembers that he didn’t found his.
So, the mansion was going to be alone for one night and Tony decided to throw a party, the whole college was invited to, and for the looks of it when he comes down the stairs,
It’s a sunny morning. They been sitting in the grass of the campus park studying for the past hour. Natasha is studying business, and Steve is going for the art mayor. He never gets entirely satisfied with what he does even if his teachers always congratulate him and try to make him see how great his technique is. Bucky and Natasha threaten to kill him every single time he hesitates over delivering some work or every time he wants to throw something to the garbage can, so he obeys.
“I kissed him at that goddamned party and now… I can’t get it out of my head”  He is almost hyperventilating. How did he not know about this? How did he not know he liked Steve? The heart racing he got when he thought about kissing Steve, is not new. That heart race is always there when they are standing too close to each other, or when they are about to meet. They’ve known each other for
He washes his teeth with disgust and washes his face again before going out. This time walking a little better.
“Yeah, sorry about the mess, I… couldn’t find the room and then the bed”  He whispers and laughs a little, bearing his face in the pillow. He is laying now, but the room is spinning.
“Sorry for leaving you alone at the party.” He speaks a bit more steady this time and if it weren’t for the lack of light in the room, he would be staring straight into Aaron’s eyes.
The whole house looks like it’s been attacked, or robbed, or both. And he is grateful for the cleaning service he hired anticipatedly for today’s afternoon. There’s some people leaving as he walks down the stairs and there’s also Jarvis, standing there waiting for him like if he
He keeps rubbing Steve's shoulders until his breathing evens back out after what he's said. He has to fix this. He thinks he can. He hopes he can. "Easy, sweetheart, easy," he soothes, and Steve seems to respond positively to the affection, going looser under his hands, "It's okay, that was good. We're going to wake you up now, nice and slow... I want you to remember what happened, remember what you told me... it's okay, we'll just talk, I want to talk to you, okay? So I'm going to bring you up now. Ready? One... Two..." Tony snaps, and Steve blinks awake under his hands, tension running through him like a live wire.
Tony smiles at his phone in the lab, then blushes and he's glad he's alone. Is this a date? It feels like it might kinda be a date. Shit. Where's he gonna take Steve? Is that gonna affect how things go? His brain starts spinning out on him, then he gets a hold of himself. Maybe he should answer the damn text before he has a full blown anxiety attack.
Steve looks up, smiles at Tony weakly. "Hey yourself," he says- and that's when Tony figures it out- Steve came in here because he's lonely. Nat and Bucky were out on a mission doing whatever really hot Russian ex-murder spies did, Clint is off on some SHIELD opp, strictly need to know shit, Bruce is cleansing his soul at some Doctors Without Borders outpost while there's no impending doom for the Earth, or at least Manhattan, on the menu, Wanda is training with Strange, Sam was back in DC working at the VA, and that just leaves... Them. And the Tower could feel real cavernous when there were this few people in it. At least Tony had his lab to keep him occupied, Rhodey or Pepper if they were free, FRIDAY to chat with, tweak code on. What did Steve have? Graves to visit? Parks to sketch sadly while he sips a coffee? Fuck that was depressing.
Steve's face smooths back out and he sighs, nods. "Yes... There's something I haven't told you..." he says slowly, and Tony feels white hot anger flare up in him. He thought Steve trusted him now, thought they were friends- thought maybe they could be more.
Steve blinks and shakes his head, clearing the remaining cobwebs. "Wow, Tony... Mmm, I feel much better. Thank you."
Steve's eyes widen at the prices on the menu and Tony immediately shushes him before he can even protest. "You did me a favor, I'm spoiling you a little. Be glad I didn't drag you to Le Bernardin. And don't go trying to pinch pennies on me, order anything you think sounds good- that's an order, soldier."
Tony figures that's a good a sign as any to take him deeper. "Okay, Steve, we're going to count down together, down from 5, and with every number you're going to fall deeper and deeper into this soft, relaxed feeling until we get to one, and then your eyes will shut and you'll sleep for me. Understand?"
Steve laughs at him, and a lot of the darkness leaves his face, the burden on his shoulders lightens some. "Alright Stark, don't wet your pants. If we try this, and that's a big fucking if right now, there have got to be ground rules, understand?"
"I know you elderly people like to eat early in the evening, how's five sound?" There, a joke. Tony's smooth. He's still got it.
They're almost up there when Steve breaks the dense quiet. "Hey Tony, this backdoor thing... to put me back like that. It only works for you, right?"
Steve sighs, grumbling to himself, something about "Better not welch, billionaire," and Tony laughs, goes back to work- but his attention is on Steve.
Tony's heart breaks and he feels guilty, but he swallows hard. He needs to know. What if something is wrong? What if Steve is sick, somehow?
Steve looks like he might be struggling, just a little, at first, and then he stops, and his face smooths out, serene, blank. "Yes... Want to listen..." he murmurs, and his head sways a little.
Steve rolls his eyes, but he doesn't complain any more, and when the waiter comes to check on them, he orders an appetizer and a drink- Tony's glad he took him to heart. He does the same and their cocktails come quick and cold, just how he likes them. He loves this place.
Steve looks as though he might cry, briefly, but then he smooths out again, the sadness in his voice the only giveaway for his turmoil. "Don't... Don't wanna hurt the team... Everything's so good now... Don't wanna be selfish..."
"Two, almost there, so deep for me, Steve, so relaxed, you can feel it pulling you, irresistible, you can barely keep your eyes open now, they're so heavy, your body is so soft and tired..."
Tony parks and it's a pretty great spot- probably nabbed it right after someone left work, maybe this 5 o'clock dinner thing isn't so bad after all- and he holds the door for Steve going into Keens. Steve nods his head in thanks, and Tony gets to look at his ass in those damn burgundy pants. Win-win.
Steve holds his hand up, and Tony stills, quiets. "First, don't you ever fucking do something like that to me again. If you want to ask me something, just ask. We're friends. Maybe more. I understand why you did it, I do, fear can be a powerful thing, and so can power, but if you ever take advantage of me like that again, I won't even look at you, let alone date you."
Tony smiles and resists a laugh- if it was a matter of determination, Steve could level Mt. Everest with a solid glare. He thinks he'll benefit from this now.
Steve looks up as the elevator opens and smiles, wide and open at Tony. "Was starting to think you'd forgotten about me," he says, teasing lightly, but Tony can see the shadow of real worry lingering there.
A wink emoji? Tony is going to die. Maybe Steve doesn't know what that means? No, he definitely does- despite all Tony's jokes, Steve is frustratingly tech literate for a centenarian.
"Jeeze Tony, I'm sorry... I didn't mean to make fun if it's something serious. I thought it was something you were just messing around with... y'know, as a gag," Steve says, and he's so contrite Tony almost feels bad.
They head back together, and stand a little awkwardly in the lobby, neither of them quite sure what to say. Finally, Tony starts to say, "Would you want to-" just as Steve says, "Hey Tony, d'you think-" They both stop and blink at each other, then laugh.
"Relax. I'm just not going to take you to bed right after our first kiss. I ain't that kinda girl, Stark," he says, and it shocks a rough laugh out of Tony.
"Stay in this deep, warm, safe place with me," Tony says, rubbing his thumbs over the backs of Steve's hands. Steve nods and sighs, content. "You know you're safe here, safe with me. Is there anything you want to tell me, Steve? Anything you're hiding?"
They're chatting as they sip their drinks and eat their appetizers, salad for Steve, charred shishito peppers for Tony, just casual back and forth; the team, the weather, sports- Steve is a rabid baseball fan, to Tony's amusement- then they order dinner, and when the food comes, even the easy back and forth largely dies off as they both dig in. When Steve puts the first bite of mutton in his mouth, he groans softly and his eyes slide shut and wow if that doesn't go straight to Tony's dick.
"Second... This can't affect the team. If we try this, and it doesn't work out, we need to be okay with each other. Okay?"
He nods again, and looks almost wistful, like he doesn't want to wake up. Maybe Tony is imagining things- projecting. He likes seeing Steve relaxed like this.
Tony's snapped out of his thoughts when Steve's fingers ghost across a tablet screen, causing a spiral to light up on it when it wakes. "What is this, Tone?" Steve asks, picking it up, "You thinking of starting a stage act? The incredible hypnotic Iron Man and his lovely assistant Pepper?"
"I'm going to snap my fingers one the count of three, and you're going to wake up. Okay? Ready? One, two, three," Tony says, and he snaps, a loud click of his fingers, and Steve is blinking owlishly, awake and aware like nothing happened.
"Steve I'm sorry, I just-" Had a moment of weakness so I dug through your brain like a kid looking for marshmallows in Lucky Charms? What the fuck does he even say?
Maybe Steve will call in his dinner soon. Maybe seeing him in person instead of in these shadowy imaginings will help. Remind him that his friend is a person, and not a plaything, or an experiment, no matter what these dark fantasies croon to him. He hopes so.
"Just letting you know... Natasha found out I saw Snow White and Fantasia before the war and liked them, so she made me watch the rest of the Disney movies with her," Steve says, and Tony cocks his head, trying to figure out what the hell that has to do with anything.
Tony is late- only a few minutes, and he got distracted, it could have been worse, he'd forgotten entire evenings out in the past- and he exits the elevator to see Steve fixing his cuffs in a black sport coat, a neat white shirt with the top three buttons open, show a tantalizing flash of chest and throat, and well fitted burgundy slacks, his hair slicked back. Tony feels his mouth go dry.
"Two," Steve breaths, his eyes sliding shut and dragging open desperately, the faint look of a man barely hanging on.
Steve pulls back slowly and he's smiling like the cat who got the canary. Tony raises a hand to his lips and touches them gently like he's trying to make sure that really just happened. Steve laughs at him gently, and it doesn't bother Tony one bit.
Tony has a dark flash of insecurity, thinking back to Bucky and the fight that had nearly torn the Avengers apart completely and he thinks well... What harm can a question do? It's not like Steve will remember, anyway.
"That's a good idea. Familiar surroundings," he says, and Steve nods. He hits the call button for the elevator. They get in together and stand in silence on the way up, slightly more tense than in the car.
"Well... I did say I would try, and I guess I have to do it the right way for me to see if it works or not," he says, and turns his attention back to the swirling image on the tablet, settling under Tony's hands.
Steve goes back to looking at what's on the table at the question, grimacing slightly. "I'm fine, y'know, just thought I'd maybe see what you were up to, ask if you wanted to.. I dunno. Get lunch maybe, show me some cultural touchstone that it's clearly a sin against God that I've missed," he answers, bouncing back from his discomfort with banter. Ah, that was good at least. Tony could maybe work with that- maybe they could watch... He didn't know, maybe Top Gun? That was a homoerotic classic that wouldn't be awkward at all. Nope.
Steve shudders, and Tony is terrified for a second that he's going to wake up, but he goes limp, like he's accepted everything. Tony grins, relieved, victorious.
"Third. Um. Hmm. I guess we'll come up with other rules if we need them. But those two are non negotiable." Tony nods again, and Steve smiles shyly, the last of the thunder leaving his expression, and Tony feels his heart swell. He didn't fuck this up irreparably. He has a chance.
They're chatting as they sip their drinks and eat their appetizers, salad for Steve, charred shishito peppers for Tony, just casual back and forth; the team, the weather, sports- Steve is a rabid baseball fan, to Tony's amusement- then they order dinner, and when the food comes, even the easy back and forth largely dies off as they both dig in. When Steve puts the first bite of mutton in his mouth, he groans softly and his eyes slide shut and wow if that doesn't go straight to Tony's dick.
"How could I forget about you, Red, White and Beautiful?" Tony shoots back, and the light blush that stains Steve's cheeks is deeply gratifying, makes Tony feel a little less like jumping out of his skin. Still got it, Stark.
He laughs, not meanly, but Steve still winces, colors darkly with embarrassment and shit, Tony didn't mean for that to happen at all. "No Steve, it's fine- please don't- don't think i'm being mean. I'm just- I was surprised, that's all. So you really liked it?"
Steve looks up as the elevator opens and smiles, wide and open at Tony. "Was starting to think you'd forgotten about me," he says, teasing lightly, but Tony can see the shadow of real worry lingering there.
He's not ignorant of his flaws. And sometimes it's a gift, when he turns something over in his head so many times and looks at it from so many angles that everything finally slots together and makes sense in a perfect way that would be unattainable by other means.
Tony rubs gently at Steve's shoulders and feels him relax even more at the touch- very promising, he would have to write that down- and then he starts speaking again, still rubbing.
Tony smiles at his phone in the lab, then blushes and he's glad he's alone. Is this a date? It feels like it might kinda be a date. Shit. Where's he gonna take Steve? Is that gonna affect how things go? His brain starts spinning out on him, then he gets a hold of himself. Maybe he should answer the damn text before he has a full blown anxiety attack.
Tony feels arousal curl tight and hot in his belly. "You want to feel like this again. It's the most relaxing thing. You feel so good and soft here. It's the only way you can relax properly, here in the trance with me. And you want to listen to me when you're in trance. It's only fair to listen to the person who makes you feel so good, isn't it?"
Steve looks up and there's anger in every line of his face. "No, you shouldn't have," he says sharply, "Fuck, Tony, I'm not a toy or a puzzle for you to play around with or crack open."
"Actually, do you think maybe you could be my guinea pig? It might help you relax, and it would do a lot for my research- could help a lot of people."
They're almost up there when Steve breaks the dense quiet. "Hey Tony, this backdoor thing... to put me back like that. It only works for you, right?"
"Sure," Tony says easily, and he leaves enough cash on the table for most of the staff to be able to go on vacation, "Your chariot awaits."
"Sure," Tony says easily, and he leaves enough cash on the table for most of the staff to be able to go on vacation, "Your chariot awaits."
Steve's brow wrinkles, and Tony keeps up his patter, soothes him. "Easy Steve, remember, you're safe, it's open, you can be honest. Relax, let it out. You'll feel better once you get it off your chest, and you already feel so good, so safe and warm and soft..."
"Steve," Tony says softly, and his eyelids flutter, like he's trying to pay attention, and Tony goes back to stroking his hands, soothing him, "Easy, shhh, easy... You're safe here. No more talking about that. You feel good, don't you? Relaxed?"
about what happened. Steve doesn’t know how much time Tony is going to need, but he hopes they can get over this soon.
Steve, makes his stomach jump, his heart race and the sensation of wanting to hide his face between his hands in embarrassment. He can’t hide it. It wasn’t a normal drunk kiss that you will give to anyone on a party, it wasn’t something that you could move on from. It wasn’t meaningless and he can’t pretend anymore that is fine when it’s not. He can’t pretend that it felt the same as kissing any other of his friends because he wants to do it again. He keeps wondering what would be like to kiss Steve being sober and paying all the possible attention. He wants to feel Steve’s hands on his waist again putting him closer. And that’s why it hits him.
“No! Why would he...? Never mind. I don’t know if he punch me, I think I kissed him but I can’t remember”
was just a couple of stairs away? Okay maybe he was tired. Maybe they fell asleep watching a movie. It was okay.
“Okay I deserved that.” Some people laugh as he groans and she walks away angrily pushing a couple out of her way.
and Steve replied with sarcasm. Right now, he is sure Tony was right. And he is also sure of why, people always cling to Tony. Being kissed by Tony Stark, is way too good like to don’t want to repeat it again.
On their way to Steve’s bedroom (the one he shares with some korean boy who pretends not to know english so he doesn’t have to talk to Steve) they run into Tony and Aaron.
“Shut up” Bruce bites his pizza and gestures to Tony to grab a bite at his. So Tony does, even tho now he is less hungry than ever. Bruce takes his phone to look at something in the screen and show Tony. “So anyway, look at this -“
Some people greet him, congratulate him for the party or some others just flashes smiles to him as he walks, except for one girl who looks at him like he wants to murder him.
“That was really awkward Steve. Would you talk it out?” Nat says once the pair is gone. Steve tightness his jaw.
God, there’s an unbearable amount of daylight in the room and the floor is a mess of mattresses, sheets, pillows, clothes and even beer bottles. He threw up right in the mattress under his bed, but no one was there anymore
There’s no hate messages on his phone from Rogers or a “we need to talk” message so that’s fine. Not like Steve would decide to talk things out 'cause he
Steve rolls his eyes playfully at the nickname. Ever since he told Nat that his teammates called him Captain when he got to be lider in a project, he teases him with that. The whole group does.
“Yeah he is nice, but he is a dick too” He says, and it’s not real. I mean, he is not angry with Steve, he is just… avoiding him for a while. Until things are not so awkward. So from where that insult came from?
attracted to him and I’m straight, but you need to think about this. You two are friends, you can’t screw up this friendship if you just want to… fuck him”
they are at a party. And Steve always looks disappointed when Tony tells him about what he did at some party or when he sees him kissing someone random at the club. And now, NOW, Tony kissed him. And he fears the friendship is over or that Steve would be mad or… disgusted.
exactly is sleeping in his room, but he only knows Aaron is sleeping in his bed. And there’s where he is trying to get.
“His boy- wait, what? Steve doesn't have a boyfriend” Tony makes the most confused face ever and Aaron keeps staring at the damn pink poster on the wall.
so no, there is a big “it will never happen” sign in there. But he couldn’t… No, he has to shake it off his head. Bucky and Steve are friends, family, and that’s it. But what if…? No.
He needs a shower, an aspirin and… three days of sleep. The cold water wakes him up a little and his reflection in the mirror looks back defeated, with dark holes under his eyes. “Yeah, any other good ideas?” He asks himself and his voice sounds raspy like he smoked ten packs of cigarettes. Maybe he did.
“Okay, so… we were leaving” Tony offers and Aaron smiles weirdly and keeps standing there like the blond dumb doll he is and Steve shakes his head. Anyone could’ve notice that Tony was trying to get them to move. Tony grins and grabs him by the arm “Come on baby”.
From Bucky, delivered at 21:50: i see you got into deep conversation with that hottie [smirk emoji]. nat and i are gonna leave with a bunch of people and go to my place, alright? feel free to join us if you want to, and i don’t mind if u bring her along
he’s satisfying the alluring craving and want he had bottled inside him for a whole week. Toni bites his lower lip gently, then passes her tongue over it.
Peter was too nice to tell them off, so Toni took the matter into her own hands and hired a PI named Jessica Jones. Every one of the bullies had a dirty secret - drugs, nudes from someone who didn't consent, nudes from someone who did consent but is a minor - that got them expelled. Toni felt like she just thoroughly cleaned a bowl of toilet that had years of dirt and bacteria sticked on it.
“Nah, wasn't to erase the image of my father, if that's what you're asking.” She pauses. “I saw people getting killed, but not just anyone. They were people who I designed the weapons to protect, you know? They were innocent citizens and innocent soldiers.”
With the help of Nat, who’s a self-proclaimed fashion connoisseur/expert, Steve settled with a light blue button-up shirt, dark khakis, and to top it off, an expensive watch.
“Why, thank you,” Toni replies with a sheepish smile. “Come, I’ll show you my penthouse. There's a kitchen there, if you're hungry.”
They zigzag through the crowd and sink deeper into it, even though the dance floor really is everywhere. Near the busy bar, Toni spots a number of skilled strippers gracefully spinning around poles - that she bets are coated with bacteria - with men drinking alcohol gathered around their mini-stages.
His concentration is snatched away when Toni suddenly looks down. Steve, startled, copies her and sees their still-laced fingers. “What, are we already in the holding-hands stage?” Toni comments with a raised eyebrow.
10 minutes later, Steve’s already climbing back on his bike. The more time passes, the more his anticipation rises up, but so does his confusion, considering how unbendingly Steve was certain Toni wasn’t interested in him like... that. He hasn’t stopped questioning himself what the cause of her strange change of mind could be. Well, he isn’t about to complain, either.
En tout cas, je serai votre serveuse pour ce soir. Pesez sur ce bouton,” she points a small button on the edge of the table, “quand vous serez prêts à commander ou si vous avez besoin de quelque chose. Mon nom c’est Noémie.
From Toni, delivered at 1:45: no, i couldnt tell under the mass of hotness and muscles you muster [heart eyes emoji] you could pass for a 20 years old
From fave beefcake, delivered Thursday at 8:30: If you reply right at this second, I will reveal the title of my upcoming film
“I don't know what to say. It's going to sound repetitive at this point, but you are an effin’ genius. I mean it.” Steve holds Toni’s hips tentatively and approaches himself. “Thank you, Toni.”
announces the time and weather, all the while the windows’s colouration somehow clears up. Steve recomposes his posture and mentally calls himself ridiculous for having been startled by Toni’s impressive AI.
Steve wishes he could deduct things as accurately as Clint does, but he knows that Clint is more reading people like books than doing pure guesswork. But again, how does one gather from a person’s face the conclusion that said person ate what food while watching what movie genre?
But he doesn’t move, disloyal to his words, because Toni’s gaze isn’t leaving him. She approaches him almost shyly and says, “I’m sorry if what I texted you earlier left you uncomfortable. I didn't mean to. I’m just kind of an impulsive and weird person,” she tries with a smile.
“Your hair looks so messy after wearing that. I kinda left your jacket where it was, in the penthouse, by the way.”
There are no more than a third of the amount of workers on the job during the day who are present at night, so a great deal of the lights in the public spaces are closed, even though the tower runs on self-sustainable and clean energy.
“First off, why are you putting up the quotation marks? He is a hot piece of ass. You should’ve seen him, shame that you were busy with a convention that day.”
The kid doesn't always listen to her, when all she wants is the best for him, which annoys and worries Toni, but they still care about each other. He started out his singing career fine on his own and didn't truly need Toni’s financial support, but Toni still forced him to accept her money so that he could get himself more sophisticated equipments and a better manager.
From Stane, delivered at 8:20: Hello, Toni. I’ve been contacted by a private military company a week ago about an offer that even my lawyers think is too good to be turned down. I’ve spent days dissecting the whole contract with them and they explained to me that their deal has the potential to up Stark Industries’ stock points by 2 dollars. Listen, I know how you feel about making weapons, but we’ve got to discuss this in person. Answer my calls.
Steve isn't convinced, so he pushes. “What’s up? Don't say it's nothing.” It's now clear that he didn't get kidnapped or anything, but there has to be a reason why he called five times in the last 24 hours. Did his Instagram get hacked? Sam is still a small actor and doesn't have many social media followers - the most he had was 50k on Twitter, at lest during the last time Steve checked - , so he never bothered to get his accounts verified. Unfortunately, that makes them easier targets to hack into.
He doesn’t feel a twinge of sadness anymore when he thinks about his most recent ex-girlfriend, Sharon Carter. They knew each other long before feelings got involved and fell deeply in love after Steve rescued her from a murderous mugger who must’ve also been dement, because he wore a grey bodysuit with a horrific robot-looking yellow mask.
Toni could be talking about what she ate for breakfast and he’d be somehow captivated. Or, better: she could be talking about how gas turbines used in fighter jets worked and he’d still be hooked at her words. Maybe it’s her extremely pleasant voice, maybe it’s her relentless gape; her eyes almost never stray from Steve’s, whether she’s the one talking or the one listening.
“Don't give me that look, Pep. Anyways, when have I ever taken less than 20 minutes to shower? This shouldn't come as a surprise.”
When Steve lays his gaze on the woman, he takes notice of two facts: 1) He doesn’t think he's ever seen her before. It's rather unsettling, considering he is currently at a party thrown by a very famous actor (Charles Xavier) and his equally famous boyfriend (Erik Lehnsherr), which means that basically all the guests are celebrity. 2) She is, by far,
From fave beefcake, delivered at 10:37: He shaves it after he reunites with his soulmate. Remember, the cute boy with the goatee?
He doesn’t realize he was feeling a tad bit of annoyance/jealousy, until he breathes out a sigh of relief at the sight of Rhodes kisses another woman, who was waiting for him at the bar. He looks at the familiar face of Rhodes’ lover. Extremely short, straight blonde hair and a face with sharp features? It’s Carol Danvers, an actress whose popularity blew up after starring as the main character of some superhero movie.
Steve feels his face heat up. Should he reveal that he’s a bit of a creep and knew because he was stalking her from afar, a couple of hours ago?
With that said, Toni puts backs her phone on Pepper’s office’s transparent bureau (the one with the obnoxious kinetic sculpture) and leaves.
Steve proceeds to do as JARVIS said and arrives in a hallway. There's a framed image hung on the wall, and opposite to that wall is a panel made entirely of glass. He peeks into it and sees what is essentially an immense garage of some sort. There are three cars parked diagonally - one cobalt blue, one orange and one grey.
Rhodey pats Toni’s back, accompanied by an attempt to massage her shoulders. “Do you want me to carry you to the couch?”
"Think about the spiral, Steve, picture it in your mind. Like a soft, swirling vortex, pulling you deep into its center. In the center, it's so quiet and peaceful. There's no thoughts or discomfort... Just sweet, soft contentment, soothing peace... You can feel it pulling you deeper and deeper... And the deeper you go, the quieter it is, until all there is is my voice. No thoughts clouding things up, no resistance... Just easy, pliant, pliable...  It's so easy to listen to me in the quiet, so easy to obey my voice when it's the only sound... You want to listen to me, don't you? You want to keep feeling good, here in the quiet with me?"
Tony was working in his lab, music cranking, sparks flying, just the way he liked it when someone entered. He'd told FRIDAY to autolower the volume when someone came in so he was tipped off before someone stood around waiting for him to realize they were there- which had the dual bonus of having him be able to avoid being startled, and seem more considerate. Double points. He turned away from his project and smiled when he saw Cap standing there, fiddling with assorted scraps and half finished projects on the bench further from Tony, clearly not expecting to be paid attention to right away. Tony watched him; he looked... tired. Not physically necessarily, no bags under those baby blues, but the way he was holding himself, the quiet sadness in his face when he thought no one was looking that Tony had caught more than once. After a minute, Tony cleared his throat, waved. "Hey Cap," he says, voice friendly, easy. They'd patched things up some, worked out their differences by and large... He and Bucky were never going to be friends, and frankly, he was less than comfortable sharing space with him, but Tony could be cordial. His mother would be proud- the chilly politeness of a society girl. And he and Steve... They were alright. They danced around each other some, but friendly, now. Especially for two people that had tried to murder each other.
Those dark fantasies Tony had ignored during his initial research? They're all through his thoughts, pushing aside other, useful, less perverse thoughts about his friend, because Steve is his FRIEND, he reminds himself, sometimes viciously, trying to push back the onslaught of images in his head.
"Can you hear me?" he asks softly, and Steve nods. It's almost spooky- his eyes are closed, his breathing is even.
It's wrong that Tony thinks it's hot. Whatever. He'll shame himself later; he's only doing what Steve asked.
"You can't relax without it. You'll feel yourself get more and more tense until you come back to me to relax. Understand?"
"So where were we? Oh yeah- You were looking deep into the center of the spiral for me. Following the swirl down down down into the center, pulling you in, irresistible, like the tides, soft, soothing... Wearing away at you. You're so tense, Steve, but you can feel yourself loosening up, feel all the tension and tightness bleeding off as the spiral draws you down, down to where your mind is quiet and it's safe to let go and relax..." He pauses and looks down at Steve, and his eyes have started to go glassy, his mouth has dropped open, just a little, relaxed from the tight way he held it so much of the time, and his shoulders, usually upright in that military posture, were relaxed under Tony's hands. But even in the short pause, he could feel Steve starting to stir, so he went back to his patter, hoping to take him the rest of the way down.
Tony soothes him right away. "Oh yes of course. Only when I say the word, Steve, no one else is getting to short circuit you all of the sudden."
They drive to the restaurant together in companionable silence, just a bit of tension there, but nothing unbearable. Tony looks over at Steve at a red light and catches Steve doing the same and they both laugh and look away like teenagers.
He nods again. "Why?" Tony asks, and he goes back to rubbing at Steve's shoulders- that seemed to have helped put him under, maybe it would help him stay there.
Steve looks down at the carpet. He's still kind of angry, but he looks... contemplative. "Maybe..." he says, slowly, "Maybe you didn't. If we talk this over."
Steve looks around at the dark wood, the historical tidbits around the lobby. "Wow, Tony, this place is really nice... We could have just gotten a burger or something, you know I'm easy."
Steve shifts on his feet, looks down at the floor. "It helped, like you said it would. I felt calm and relaxed for the rest of the night. Slept well and everything," he says shyly, and it sounds a little like it's costing him something to admit all this. Tony is strangely touched Steve is telling him. "I'm sorry I treated it like a joke at first, Tony. I think you're right, that it could- it could really help people. And yes, also I... I liked it, yes."
"Shhh, sweetheart," he says, and he settles Steve's hands in his lap, goes back behind him to rub at his shoulders like the first time, reinforcing the connection between touch and safety, between the both of those and trance, "You can tell me. Everything is safe here. You can say anything, and it'll be okay, I promise. All safe and easy..."
"Yeah, I know you have feelings for me and I blew it like a jerk off. No surprise there," Tony says bitterly, angry at himself.
Steve stretches and stands. "Well... thanks for helping me relax I guess. I don't want to take up too much of your time, since you're working," he says, and if Tony's a little disappointed at the brush off he keeps it to himself.
Tony walks around to the front, just to look at him. He looks so soft and small like this, most of the presence Steve carries with him smoothed away by the trance. He looks... vulnerable. Human. Tony squats in front of him, takes his hands in his.
Steve flushes dark to the tips of his ears and the maitre'd tells them their table is ready, escorts them over. "Enjoy your meal, gentlemen."
Steve's eyes widen at the prices on the menu and Tony immediately shushes him before he can even protest. "You did me a favor, I'm spoiling you a little. Be glad I didn't drag you to Le Bernardin. And don't go trying to pinch pennies on me, order anything you think sounds good- that's an order, soldier."
Tony draws back like he was burned. "Disgusted? What are you, fucking crazy? Captain America has feelings for me? I'd scream it from the rooftops if I hadn't just blown it to smithereens."
They head back together, and stand a little awkwardly in the lobby, neither of them quite sure what to say. Finally, Tony starts to say, "Would you want to-" just as Steve says, "Hey Tony, d'you think-" They both stop and blink at each other, then laugh.
Steve cuts in. "Hypnosis? You? You gonna try and make a supervillain bawk like a chicken with a hypno-beam in your suit?"
Tony offers him a reassuring smile, and the doors open. Steve goes to sit down on the couch and Tony stands behind him, warm gentle hands on his shoulders, just like the other night.
Tony smiles, laughs. "Wouldn't have been the first time I'd forgotten a dinner. But I'm trying to be better, more attentive in my old age. You want dessert?"
"Three, four times as deep as when we started, so tired, so relaxed, so soft for me, Steve. You can feel yourself sliding downward..."
He keeps rubbing Steve's hands, "Easy Steve, it's alright... breathe... soft and slow, so deep for me... What is it that you haven't told me? Why haven't you told me?"
Tony offers him a reassuring smile, and the doors open. Steve goes to sit down on the couch and Tony stands behind him, warm gentle hands on his shoulders, just like the other night.
Some of the tension in Steve's shoulders lets go, and he huffs out a sigh. "Oh, okay. As long as it's you. I don't mind so much then."
"I dunno, Tony... It's pretty weird, and I'm supposed to be resistant to that kind of thing," he says, but his eyes glance down at the tablet, "What would I have to do, exactly?" Got him.
Tony offers a smile, drops Steve's hands, stands up straight. "Sure, Cap. Any time. You let me know if you want to do it again."
"You alright?" Tony asks, and he can do this- can try to offer compassion to a friend of his, even if feelings give him hives.
"That's a good idea. Familiar surroundings," he says, and Steve nods. He hits the call button for the elevator. They get in together and stand in silence on the way up, slightly more tense than in the car.
Some of the tension in Steve's shoulders lets go, and he huffs out a sigh. "Oh, okay. As long as it's you. I don't mind so much then."
Tony walks around to the front, just to look at him. He looks so soft and small like this, most of the presence Steve carries with him smoothed away by the trance. He looks... vulnerable. Human. Tony squats in front of him, takes his hands in his.
"Yeah, Cap, you went right under with a little help from yours truly," Tony says with a smile, and Steve blushes, ducks his head. That's... interesting.
"Casablanca," Tony says softly, and Steve has a second to blink before it drags him under like a wave, his eyes sliding shut and his body slumping forward, a puppet with its strings cut.
Steve bites his lip, looks up at Tony hopefully. "If that's okay. Do we have to go back to the lab?"
Steve sighs, long suffering, and sits down on Tony's padded work bench. "Fine. But you owe me lunch for this."
They drive to the restaurant together in companionable silence, just a bit of tension there, but nothing unbearable. Tony looks over at Steve at a red light and catches Steve doing the same and they both laugh and look away like teenagers.
Tony soothes him right away. "Oh yes of course. Only when I say the word, Steve, no one else is getting to short circuit you all of the sudden."
"Okay, Steve, we'll count to five together now, up from zero where it's safe and quiet, back to being awake and aware. Zero, still so deep in the spiral, dark, quiet, but waking up some. One, starting to come up, back to the waking world with me. Two, feeling the sleepiness leave you, feeling your thought come back. Three, more than halfway now, almost up for me, four, back with me, blinking, shaking this off, and five, awake, aware, back with me."
Images like Steve staring into the spiral so deep and so long he never comes up... Steve on his knees for Tony, eyes glassy, those pretty pink lips parted...
"No no, I'm good with my steak. Besides, if you like it that much, I wouldn't want to deprive you." Steve smiles, warm and a little shy, and goes back to his plate with gusto.
That's when Tony gets an idea. Maybe he can help Cap feel better- and test his new interest at the same time. "No, I'm sorry, I'm a little edgy. It's just something I've been researching is all-"
Steve frowns, but Tony knows it's at himself, for not making more effort and being a better sport. He recognizes the expression.  "You're right. I'm not giving it a chance. You know how stubborn I can be. I'll try to take it more seriously," he says, and now there's a stubborn set to his brow as he locks his eyes on the spiral on the tablet, like he's going to make it work by sheer force of will.
Tony nods furiously. "I'm all ears. Rules, I love rules," he says, a half desperate grin curling on his mouth, hope blooming in his heart like a weed.
"I guess they had hypnosis in the Stone Age, silly me to think different," Tony snarks back, a little defensive. He had been looking into alternate methods of relaxation for himself- crawling into a bottle was no longer an option, therapy made him itch, he was a paranoid stoner... Mostly he used breathing exercises as best he could manage, but hypnosis had been a very interesting, and surprisingly fruitful vein of research. Especially when blended with his tech, it could help to revolutionize therapy, the medical field, help people with PTSD and anxiety safely and with less medication- he had gone pretty deep down the rabbit hole in his excitement. And there were other, darker fantasies there too, but they were just that, fantasies, and Tony had put them aside to focus on the real positive scientific potential for what most people would write off as New Age gobbledygook.
Steve shifts uneasily, but Tony's pretty sure he's convinced him- if it's for "the greater good", Steve is just about always a sure thing.
They manage to mostly avoid each other for a couple of days, really only bumping into each other by the kitchen, then Steve texts Tony- "How does tonight work for you?"
Steve flushes dark to the tips of his ears and the maitre'd tells them their table is ready, escorts them over. "Enjoy your meal, gentlemen."
"No, I insist," Tony says, and Steve blushes again- Tony thinks maybe he could get used to seeing that, causing it.
"Wow, a Stone Age comment. Been a while for one of those. I touch a nerve with what I said?" Steve says, raising an eyebrow at Tony, the light from the tablet cast over his face as he looks at him.
He clears his throat and Steve flushes. "Uh. Sorry. It's really, really good. You want a piece?" he asks, immediately going to cut some for Tony. He waves him off.
After a while they both finish and even Steve, with his super soldier appetite, is patting his stomach. "Wow. That was a lot. And very delicious," he says, giving Tony a wide, genuine smile, "Thank you Tony. This was really nice. I'm sorry I ever even hinted that you might back out."
Steve shifts again, looking faintly uneasy, but mostly anticipatory. "Well we could... we could go up to my apartment then I guess. The couch you put in there is nice," he says, and Tony nods.
"I think maybe you just want to see me earlier in the day. ;) But five works for me. Meet you in the lobby?" Steve is flirting. That's definitely flirting. Right? Tony's going to give himself a heart attack by lunch, forget dinner.
"So uh. Ground rules all laid out and all... I'd um... I'd sure like to kiss you, everything out in this open."
"Good, Steve, that's good. We're going to take you down deeper, to a soft, quiet place where you want to listen to me, to make it easier for you to come back here, make it feel even better. So relaxed for me, right? You remember the spiral, don't you Steve?"
Steve's face smooths back out and he sighs, nods. "Yes... There's something I haven't told you..." he says slowly, and though fear and anger flare up in Tony, he gets a hold of it, forces it down. He and Steve are friends now, much closer than they had been back when that whole mess had happened. He'll just... convince Steve to tell him, coax it out of him, and they can talk about it from there, if necessary.
Steve bites his lip, looks up at Tony hopefully. "If that's okay. Do we have to go back to the lab?"
The door dings and the elevator opens behind him. He steps in, mind reeling, already thinking about how he could project the spiral app into a staff like Maleficent's. Steve smiles at him. "Good night Tony," he says, and Tony waves absent mindedly, the doors closing in front of them.
"Casablanca," Tony says softly, and Steve has a second to blink before it drags him under like a wave, his eyes sliding shut and his body slumping forward, a puppet with its strings cut.
Steve's brow wrinkles, and Tony keeps up his patter, soothes him. "Easy Steve, remember, you're safe, it's open, you can be honest. Relax, let it out. You'll feel better once you get it off your chest, and you already feel so good, so safe and warm and soft..."
Steve sighs, and some of the anger drains away, replaced with resignation. He laughs weakly. "Tony Stark at a loss for words. Someone alert the media," he says, and it would be funny except for all the ways it isn't. He sighs again, rests his elbows on his knees and leans forward, running a hand through his hair. "Well. I guess at least you know now. Surprise."
He laughs, not meanly, but Steve still winces, colors darkly with embarrassment and shit, Tony didn't mean for that to happen at all. "No Steve, it's fine- please don't- don't think i'm being mean. I'm just- I was surprised, that's all. So you really liked it?"
A response pops up right away- Steve must have been waiting for Tony's answer. Maybe he's excited too? Tony bites his lower lip. "Whenever, Tony, my schedule is open. But I know you're a busy guy ;)"
"Yeah... Safe with you... Trust you," Steve says softly, and Tony stops dead, almost feels guilty for using Steve like this. But he's helping him, he rationalizes- he's never seen Steve relaxed, not in all the years he's known him.
Tony winces, draws back. He deserves that. "No I know, Steve, I'm sorry. You're right. I... I don't know what to say."
"I'm sorry if it makes you uncomfortable-" Steve starts and then he stops, blinks. "Wait, did you say you blew it? You're not mad? Or disgusted?"
"T-three," Steve repeats, and Tony sees his eyes flutter, like it's a struggle to keep them open, and his face is slack, open.
"You're incorrigible," Steve tells him, but he still holds the door open for him, so he figures he's not really in any trouble.
He watches Steve watch the spiral diligently, brow furrowed, but he doesn't seem to be relaxing at all. Maybe a little, just at the edges, but not much. Tony finds himself getting up, and he comes to stand behind him, placing his hands gently on Steve's shoulders. Steve starts and turns to look at him, but Tony just smiles. "It can be easier with someone to guide you. I usually have FRI help me, but I know you're not always comfortable with that, so I thought I would offer," he says, and Steve seems to relax slightly.
The door closes behind him and Tony leans back against the wall, wondering how long Steve will wait before he comes back to him.
Tony has a dark flash of insecurity, thinking back to Bucky and the fight that had nearly torn the Avengers apart completely and he thinks well... What harm can a question do? It's not like Steve will remember, anyway. Maybe his impulse control isn't the best after the lack of sleep, but he should be fine. It'll be fine.
He clears his throat and Steve flushes. "Uh. Sorry. It's really, really good. You want a piece?" he asks, immediately going to cut some for Tony. He waves him off.
"Okay Steve, when you hear the word..." Tony wracks his brain to think of something he would never say by mistake, or in passing, "When you hear me say Casablanca, you'll come right back to how you feel now. Understand?"
"You're incorrigible," Steve tells him, but he still holds the door open for him, so he figures he's not really in any trouble.
Tony resists pumping his fist in victory. "Just sit down, get comfortable and watch the screen. I've designed it so it should take you in with little effort on your part, as long as you're not actively fighting against it."
“Tony. I’m glad to have met you though. I know it’s dangerous running into people, but I can’t help but be happy to see someone else survived.”
Steve always came back minutes before the sunset. It always made Tony restless, and he wondered every day whether Steve would make it. Some days he was afraid he wouldn’t, and he would be left alone. Other days he wished for him to never return.
Around the metal fused into his flesh, grotesque in its brutality, the skin was shredded and bloody. Deep gauges cut diagonally across what was left of his pale shoulder, and Tony remembered the bloodied hand of the creature that had stepped out of that basement door, fingers dripping red.
When a shadow moved past him, he didn’t dare breathe a sigh of relief. It was never just one. They usually hunted in packs, like wolves or hyenas.
Tony allowed himself a moment to enjoy the warmth filling the room, the subtle smell of steaming water. Even after weeks of being able to bathe again, he didn’t think he would ever be able to erase the previous months of living in filth. He sometimes felt like the grime had soaked into his body, and he could feel it slither beneath his skin. In those moments he had to wash himself again and again, scrubbing until the trickles of blood wiped him clean again.
Steve hadn’t explained much about their water supply, the need to conserve it obvious enough. But Tony found himself letting the water flow freely into the large tub. It came out hot and steaming, courtesy of the wood boiler in the house.
“Steve. Listen. I can - I can help you. I know I don’t - don’t look like much right now, but I’m probably the smartest person you’ve ever met in your life.”
Tony sighed. “You’re an idiot, Steve. And I’m the bigger idiot for believing you. But ok. Ok - you’re right. We do need to move. So just go do your thing.“
The intricate wiring at the end screamed of neural circuitry and made Tony’s fingers twitch. To think he had been in this room for this long with
“Jesus Christ, Matt, I swear even I can almost smell it. Whose fucking brilliant idea was it to pick this one?”
The flashlight was illuminating a misshapen pile of fabric, stained red and dripping slowly on the stone floor.
“I didn’t mean - I’m not throwing you out! You can stay here as long as you want. Just - he is more dangerous - more than I thought he would be, and - I wanted you to know you can - should leave if - if you want to.”
wouldn’t be enough to hold it and Steve’s underlying certainty that he would stand there on the other side until the very end, and went straight to anger.
He had a moment’s spike of panic every time Steve shifted, aware of all the other uses he might find for him now that his function as a sedative had proved ineffective. While the creature downstairs instilled a primal terror in his very bones, Steve scared him in the way someone fears the depth of a frozen lake. His words earlier had been both baffling and terrifying. He could see now the deathly grip Steve had on his own sanity, and how tenuous that grip was.
Afterward, he quickly put on the clothes Steve had given him, unwilling to face the sight of his naked body or the feeling of vulnerability that consumed him.
He registered the movement of a body in his periphery. The room seemed to brighten, and he vaguely registered the single light bulb hanging overhead, now unobscured by the shape leaning over him.
After Steve had waited for him to get to his feet and ride out the first wave of dizziness, he had led the way to a nearby tube station. He had made no move to touch him or nudge him along, simply walking ahead, trusting Tony to follow. Down into the darkness, he had magically produced a flashlight, not acknowledging Tony after his first reassurances that the distance was short and that food was already stashed away.
Thin rivulets of blood were still seeping from the pulpy mass of his shoulder. He touched the cloth to the ravaged mess, but not a second after a hand clamped on his wrist.
Tony needed 5 full seconds of mental coaching before he gathered the will to move a muscle. He got to his feet with all the grace of a centenarian.
He sat heavily down on the mattress. He knew he should be glad for regaining his awareness, but sometimes he missed the blanket of numbness. His chest hurt, and he wrapped his arms around himself and held tightly until the tears came again. Heavy sobs that constricted his ribcage.
Steve startled. He looked at him with an intensity that would have been intimidating had Tony not been at the end of his fucking rope.
The look the man was giving him now was not cold or angry, but speculative in a way that made him wary. Tony wondered if he could smell the pregnancy on him, and if so, if that was more or less likely to get him hurt. Pregnant omegas gave off a scent which was supposed to engage protective instincts in others, encourage empathy and nurturing. But who knew if such biological mechanisms still had any sway over men hardened by war and loss.
He couldn’t see anything in the dark, the light from Steve’s blowtorch blinding him to the surroundings. Tony felt panic rise in his chest. And Steve…
Tony kept his eyes on the steps - partly because after everything he had been through he refused to die of a broken neck - but mostly because he couldn’t bear looking at him. He raised his head only when they reached the top.
When he walked out of the bathroom, Steve was sitting next to a window. The shutters had been pulled up, and a soft sunrise was beginning to bloom on the horizon.
There was only one table, near a window covered in a material that looked so dense it might have been metal.
“Was that it? Is that why you brought me here? You think just because I used to be a Stark I deserve whatever happens to me?”
He did smile then. And it was possibly the most human expression Tony had ever seen him wear. A touch embarrassed, a touch nostalgic. It was warm, but it still didn’t manage to thaw the sadness that always enveloped him.
Steve turned towards it and his large unyielding body seemed to fracture as if something was crushing him from within.
The quiet was deafening. Steve’s hand had begun trembling where it was holding Tony’s shirt, and his nostrils flared. His eyes were too bright and didn’t look entirely sane.
“I don’t know what to do. You were always so sure of yourself, so calm. Nothing ever surprised you, nothing ever daunted you. I wish you would tell me what to do.”
Tony could imagine him like that, sitting on a floor next to a shuttered window, his temple leaning against the wood. His own voice the only sound in the room, his breathing the only fracture in the still air, the rhythmical metallic thud of a door the only measure of the years that slipped by.
It looked disconcertingly normal, and Tony realized that he hadn’t walked into a place which even vaguely resembled a home in years.
When he turned to leave, the light spilt down on the floor around the door. The blood and dirt there were smeared in even streaks as if something had swept over them.
Tony almost took a step towards the boxes containing their food supplies, but when he looked down and prepared to let him go, the dried streaks of blood running up his only arm gave him pause.
with both hands until his captive fingers were only inches away from the Alpha’s face. Slowly, he stretched his fingers back until he could feel the warmth of his breath. Tony waited another second, then dissolved that last bit of distance, the backs of his fingers catching on the tender skin of his lips.
He had been prepared for violence and giving away parts of himself, but the creature he ended up facing tapped into a fear so instinctive and overpowering he had completely lost any lucidity.
Then he came towards him, and Tony made the conscious decision to stand his ground. But Steve stopped an arm’s length away from him, his gaze unwavering, and offered him the bag.
Tony pressed his body tightly against the wall, his palms against his ears. The sounds were permeated by such stark despair that they were too agonizing to listen to.
When its arm rose again, Tony pressed back into the wall and tried to dodge to the left. But his muscles barely registered the signal to
Steve was out again, looking for a new place they could hide away in. And Tony was down there again, sitting on the wooden steps and thinking about how he shouldn’t judge Steve for how mental he was given his own obvious lunacy.
He came back and nudged Tony through the hole, into a small damp room. A wooden staircase to the right. A basement then. A door to the left, metal. On the -
It was so unnaturally quiet that for a second Tony had the irrational certainty that he had been already buried. That he would turn and there would be no door. No way out.
“I can stand.” The words were faint and painful to get out, but he was relieved to hear his own voice outside his head. As if he had a hope of filling the void around him, even by a drop.
The table was partially covered by a piece of dark cloth, which instantly caught Tony’s eye since it was the only object in the entire space which looked even vaguely untidy. It looked like it had been haphazardly thrown over a misshapen lump cluttering the table. Tony couldn’t see what it was from that angle, but he caught a glint of metal in the shadowed electrical light.
Tony didn’t move from where he was curled up on the mattress, facing the wall. The mattress was wet and cold beneath his cheek.
… Get away from me. Why did you bring me here? And where is it? I can smell it. WHERE THE FUCK IS IT.”
He tried to make another run for it, making a wild approximation of Steve’s position in the dark and darting past him. All he got for his troubles was a hand clamping inexorably on his arm.
He took a step closer and waited for a reaction. When none was forthcoming, he continued, the words more a comfort to him than anyone else.
Tony ended up taking the mattress. Steve had retreated to a far corner of the room, insisting Tony be comfortable. After deliberating on whether or not he should point out that Steve’s regard for his comfort had become irrelevant the moment he had dragged him in the path of his slavering boyfriend, Tony accepted.
He didn’t offer his hand to Tony or try to approach him again, something Tony refused to feel grateful for.
Tony turned his head and looked at Steve. There was a cut high on his brow bone, but the blood looked odd, like it had already congealed. The wound was disproportionately small to the amount of red smeared on his face.
When it leaned forward, its hot breath a brand on Tony’s pulse and its hand starting to slip down towards his chest, Tony felt himself slip under.
In this Godforsaken world Alphas were a threat. But a feral Alpha was a danger beyond words. Unstable, unpredictable and savage, those who had the misfortune of falling into this madness used to be put down before the war. There had been no cure for the bloodlust coiled in them. A creature ruled by instinct, who knew no emotion or reason.
There were never any other sounds, no growls or banging. It seemed calm when just Steve was there, allowed him inside and back out without a fight.
He began making a routine of it. Every time Steve left on his little recon missions, Tony would wait for the sound of the metal door closing and then another hour after that. Then he would go down, carrying a candle and a blanket.
Steve set his jaw and didn’t respond.  Tony wasn’t sure whether Steve’s increasingly obvious self-awareness was making him feel better or worse.

Steve was still staring at him, his gaze turning anguished. He reached out and very lightly pressed the back of his fingers against Tony’s cheek.
“I’m sorry I put you through all this, Tony, I really am. But I would do it all over again and I will probably keep doing it. Because there is nothing in this world that means anything to me anymore. Before there had always been a battle and people who needed me, but now everything I can save is an old ruin. It’s like everything faded. I’m not sure if it’s my memory or my eyes or just my hope. But the only things I see are him and the dust. And If I do lose him, nothing will remain.”
