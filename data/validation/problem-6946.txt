kiss him again. And Steve seemed to come back to his senses for a moment. He used the chance to pull Tony's boxers down, and grab a very determined handful of him and return the favor, turning the tables. Tony's eyes flew closed and his knees went week, and Steve's hand on his cock felt like searing heaven.
naked. He's handcuffed himself to the head-post with the specially fortified handcuffs Tony had sent him, along with the instructions.
was body conscious? Tony found himself taken aback, but, in a way, it made perfect sense. And there was something about this admission that felt terribly, horribly important.
Steve shrugged apologetically. "Well, there's a reason I quit teaching, back home." He thought for a moment how better to explain it. "Nat, these aren't cadets. They're practically draftees. We have one ex-hacker and one ex-smuggler, for gods' sake. And now I'm supposed to turn them into pilots? Sure, why not. But what I want to
Tony had turned and walked away, but, to be completely honest, so did Steve. It took Steve a fraction of a second to turn his head and look back. Nothing. Then, a heartbeat later, he looked again. Still nothing. He stayed locked in that silly position for a little while, and
Friday saved the day, as per usual. "All done, boss." And with a click, the door opened magically. Once inside, Tony had to calm down, try to do something right for once, try to talk his way through this.
The thing was, I didn't want to change any part of his life, even if I could. What would I do, go back to 2014 or 2015, back when he wasn't with Pepper at the moment, and convince him to take a chance on me? Create a separate timeline, so that I could take away his potential wife and daughter from him – from
It was perhaps an hour later, when Tony stuffed his sweaty running clothes into the laundry chute, wrapped himself in a towel and stepped out of the showers. It was then he noticed the hum change.
our timelines diverged – were the things we did the cause or just the consequence? – but we did find out that the progress of Tony and Pepper's relationship was one significant difference between our universes.
They were passing by the Atkinson house, all bedecked and lit up like a stage. Everyone said it resembled a brothel, even though Steve wouldn't repeat that. But the lights spilled onto the road like a river of red and gold. Fitting, Steve thought. And he studied Tony's profile for a moment, the quirk of the mouth that looked unexpectedly self-deprecating, and those dark eyelashes that dusted his cheek every now and then. Stark had been attractive on TV, in a distant way, but now he was real and close, and pensive underneath all the jokes. Steve felt inexplicably protective of him right then.
All of a sudden, Cap froze. Immobile as a pillar. Judging by his face, this was exactly where the blurring stopped and the lines became hard again. Oh well, if Tony didn't push at the boundaries, he wouldn't know where they were located. Rogers's lips had gone thin, and Tony could have sworn he'd blushed a bit, although he might still have been flushed from the run.
"Oh god, I can't," Tony grunts, and then his other hand is opening his own zipper. He fumbles, pulls himself out frantically. Steve's gaze is plastered to his cock, red and swollen. Tony grips it, strokes himself roughly, once, twice, fighting for breath.
"There's a door here," Steve said. Which – yes, that would explain the section of the dividing wall on his side that seemed newer, way more sloppily plastered.
I nod, so that he'd have an excuse to fuss with plates and bread and things while he figures out what he wants to say to me. Because I can see he wants to say something.
And in a sudden burst of lucidity, it seems to Steve he's too far gone, he can never reach his peak like this. It's just over-sensation, building and building, with no relief in sight, and while a part of him wants to be suspended like this, tormented like this into infinity, he desperately
I shook my head mutely and felt a smile tugging at my lips. My first, incoherent thought had been that I'd been sent here just for a minute, just to see him. But, coming to think on it, that made no sense. Why would the Ancient One do that? No. I was now coming to believe I was here for good. I did say I wanted a life. And she said she could help me with that. It made sense.
It was. He knew Tony had a certain affection for him, and there was definitely a physical attraction between them – something that Tony never acknowledged in any way when he was sober. Steve didn't know what to think, and up 'till now, out of a desire not to spoil their friendship, Steve had held back. But this was indeed his last chance, and he knew he was going to regret it for the rest of his life if he did nothing. They had both been drinking some, but unlike before, when they'd had their moments, Tony now seemed awake and alert. Well. Steve was going to tell him – talk to him – and Tony could then say what he waned, if he wanted anything.
, wall to wall, like a zoo animal or any honest prisoner in a decent cell, but putting any unnecessary weight on his bad leg seemed silly, and, besides, hopping and limping this way and that would probably look totally ridiculous. He settled for tapping his good foot in an erratic rhythm.
"Yes, I know," Steve said, and he was right in front of Tony. Now he put his hands on Tony's elbows. Tony hated that he could feel the touch only vaguely through the thick garment. Still, the touch was there, and it made him swallow a lump in his throat. Steve wasn't finished speaking, though. "I know who you are, Tony, but I don't mind, I swear!"
that stance of his. Then finally, finally, his eyes rested on Steve’s face. It wore a slight frown of consternation.
I did my best to smile at her, and I had no idea what to say. Two people who had loved the same man for a long time, we still had nothing in common. When I came over, I usually played with Morgan, and Pepper was grateful for a bit of time for herself.
That's more realistic. Tony wouldn't call unless something went wrong, would he? Or perhaps Steve might call.
Tony wasn’t checking him out, he really wasn’t. Just a moment of aesthetic appreciation, he told himself as he looked away. One single glance along his upper arm, along the biceps emphasized by the tight undershirt that Steve – unfairly – wore. It was difficult not to be appreciative of Steve’s looks. So, since the early days, Tony consciously didn’t indulge in looking. At first, because he didn’t
Steve gave his semi-amused nod, and Tony thought it was probably worrisome he could identify Steve's semi-amused nod. Also, the semi-amused meant only that there was another 'semi' in there, and that 'semi' was quite serious.
," Tony said bleakly. "Holy fuck, I'm getting a cardiac arrest from laughter, over here. Listen, when we get out of here..."
Steve half-listened, and thought: the way Tony ran to save him today, the way he leapt in front of Steve to protect him,
, but... They must have talked. Occasionally, at least. Tony said they'd been friends. Did they do friend things, I wondered hungrily? Like what? Lead the support group together? I could hardly imagine that. Played basketball? Cooked dinners for Natasha and the others? (Oh, Jesus. I couldn't think about Natasha now, either. I couldn't.)
We spent most of that day in conversation. First we sat in the kitchen for a longest time and talked, then we went for a walk and found a place to have lunch, and then we came back home for coffee, and it was as if we would never run out of things to say to each other.
authorities? But no, it was just like Steve to try and do this all alone. And as much as Tony tried to be angry at him for it, it seemed that he had no anger left, just this wet, sloppy, sugary feeling that threatened to overwhelm him unless he put a hard stop to it. Leaning on Steve suddenly wasn't such an utilitarian experience any longer. Maybe it hadn't been to start with either, but he'd done his best to overlook the fact. Tony's hand on Steve's arm burned with desire for
"We're going," Tony says. "We're obviously the best choice. The power couple and all that. Now that that's settled, let's talk New York 2012. Natasha, do you think you could..."
"Okay, great." Tony rubbed his hands together. "You go lie down for a bit, you still need your rest. I'll get to it. It will be ready in no time – well, not exactly, but we can have a late supper, in any case. You just go on."
Tony: No. I'm going to come over. To Wakanda. Right now. Give me a couple of hours. All right? Are you going to be okay in the meantime. Go be with Nat, okay?
Tony seems to be reading his mind. "I wish you could see yourself right now," he murmurs at Steve. "If we had a mirror, I'd make you look at yourself."
Tony: And if I say try not to beat yourself up about it, well, it's not going to help any because you're going to do it nevertheless.
"Him." The man gestured to Steve with his chin (his hands were tied). He nodded towards the remains of the smashed hard drive. "You saw why. You..." He shrugged. "You were just bait."
Slowly, the cold had started sinking in, the creepy crawly chills that began all quiet and then proceeded to wreck his body, slowly at first, and then stronger and stronger.
Tony: On to more cheerful topics. I just got a word of Ross. Have you heard anything about him, by the way?
. I often sit back and just think I don't know what I did to deserve so much happiness in one lifetime. I can't believe I got to hold his hand every day for forty years straight.
Tony felt a tiny pang of regret, perhaps: for them, for what they'd had, and what they hadn't had; he couldn't help but think that, had their timing been more attuned, they might have understood each other better. In all probability, it wouldn't have helped, not in the long run. Still, maybe they'd have had some more good times together. Oh well. That ship had sailed off into space long ago, and all Tony could now manage was a brief bout of nostalgia that served to get his mind off other things and other people. They were better as friends anyway, Pepper and he.
Tony couldn't look away from the door. "You know what, it really is."  He still had Steve's art in his office. He'd tried putting it away, after he'd returned to the Compound, and then he took it out again. Pepper thought he was using it to punish himself, but that wasn't it. Putting it away didn't make it any less
It was like poker, really; when someone raised the stakes, you either followed or you left your money and went home. And Steve had been raising and raising the stakes since yesterday, somehow, and
Steve's eyebrows going all the way up. Also, the slight grin in his voice. Tony thought the banter may have been a tad forced, but he had to respect the effort. He was surprised to detect relief in his own heart. At least it wasn't so awkward now. Perhaps they'd waded  through the awkwardness, all the way to the other side. Perhaps that was the easiest answer: to fall back into their old patterns. (Tony had lied; he
Tony hid his jerk of surprise well, but Steve noticed it, he felt it in his bones: a stab of regret, black and inconsolable. Because Tony seemed to be asking him why, why are you being like this to me, why now? What did I do? Which was a perfectly understandable question, really, because Tony considered him a friend, and he had done nothing wrong, and Steve's feelings were his own private hell. He should try to keep them that way.
And not all of them were comfy, sentimental, artsy-fartsy, lovey-dovey, full of longing and regret. There was this one – a recurring one – in which (and Tony could barely wrap his thoughts around it) Steve slept and dreamt
Steve doesn't think he is either, and he feels apprehension tug at his gut, and he wonders if he should just put a stop to this, just go and jerk off in the bathroom and forget the whole thing, because this is too crazy, it's too...
Instead of Chief, he spotted Stark and found himself mesmerized once again. Wherever the man went, he made ripples. He certainly wasn't a one to stand in a corner and have a quiet drink. Men gravitated towards him, laughed at his jokes. Stark himself was cordially dismissive.
everywhere. He'd went overboard, as he usually did, with the kid-friendly Christmas snacks, healthy and not so healthy ones– oh god, all the cheese reindeer and the banana snowmen and the Santa hat jello shooters (with no alcohol, obviously) and all the other atrocious things Morgan would have loved. It took him almost the whole day yesterday to make them all, and there was still a ton of ingredients for the dinner he had been going to make and the easy cookies he had been going to bake and decorate with Morgan.
“C’mon on, Cap.” Tony took his hand and started dragging him towards the shore with that new-idea-look on his face, but it seemed just a little forced, just a little too cheerful.
Banner's hand on his forearm kept him from saying something even more stupid. The reply that died on Tony's lips was: What's a pretty guy like you doing at a place like this,
The disappointment in the pit of Steve's stomach was acute; not because he needed a confirmation of Tony's identity, but because he'd been hoping to see his face as he drank. Just a glimpse, after months of separation. He imagined he could see a glint of brown eyes through the visor slits, but it was just that – imagination.
Steve was here. Tony himself had this amazingly idiotic way of showing it, but having someone share the darkness with him was almost exhilarating at times. At
Tony: I'm always overtly kind, you ass. Everyone knows that. It's just that you are learning to decode me only now.
It was mostly stress. He knew that, because it was that helpless, stupid kind of laughter that, with him, always had tears lurking somewhere close in the background. One could turn into another at a drop of a hat. Like opening a dam. He was not going to cry in front of Steve. He
Disappointment was there, alive inside me, despite myself. Of course he didn't. He always loved other people. Why did I think it would be different here? But then – there must be variables too. Why did the Ancient One send me here, after all? Was this perhaps the only timeline where Tony was alive? No, impossible. So, maybe something else differed.
Tony didn't want his voice to go raw. It did, though; it scraped at his throat, and it was too much. Steve patted his hand, unexpectedly; one moment not touching him, the very next moment all warm and
. We were good friends who shared an occasional fuck, for fun and comfort." It sounded so natural, the way he said it, and also entirely impossible. He paused, gave me a concerned frown. "You all right, there?"
This makes her roll her eyes. She peers over the edge of the fort, surveying the situation, then ducks back. Tony gets the impression her heart is not really in the snowball fight. "You could have dropped by anytime before, you know" she says. "Even when you weren't screwing Steve."
Tony didn't even blink at that. "No, but I figured. And seeing you flying over in that piece of junk made it clear enough. And I'd
(Even more restless, all of a sudden. Pacing back and forth. Trying to read the book spines, but words not reaching further than his eyes.)
He grabbed a shovel and cleared out a path to the main house and the driveway as much as he could, even though it was still snowing with crazy enthusiasm.
"The diner is closed, remember?" Tony said. And then Steve was wriggling out of his jacket and pushing it at Tony.
"Well, then," the kid said, without showing any intent to get up, "we can play triad for the bed the minute he gets out."
And this was the second time Steve pulled this 'you wouldn't believe me' shit. Tony was suddenly, unreasonably pissed off, a little bit at Steve, and a whole lot more at himself because no, he hadn't figured it out. It hadn't even crossed his mind, not even when Steve offered to kick down the fucking explosive door for him. Oh no, he'd managed to concoct a convoluted theory instead, about them both being kidnapped for some nefarious purposes, to be pitted against each other or who knew what.
Which is when Steve grabs him around the waste and practically turns him around. "Quickly," he hisses. "Kiss me."
Bruce sat up in bed. He looked up and down the rows of sleeping pilots and shrugged. "I have my connections in medical," he said dryly. "I'll bribe someone into letting me pass."
Tony: Nah. Don't think so, at least. Okay. So, I promise to talk to you more in future, if you'll give me something in return, how's that?
Steve allows himself to discover a glint of happiness, somewhere inside. He knows he'll be punished for that.
We both stayed on our respective ends of the bench, obviously, but just sitting so close to him was glorious enough.
Rogers, he told himself very firmly. (Not that he'd mind if something happened, odiously; Rogers was pretty hot.) What he wanted was to make him
for them. That's when you get a hand on your cock. Two for prostate, three for cock. Yeah?" Tony shrugs his metallic shoulders. "So let's see if you can come on my fingers alone, or how desperate you really are, because," and he wiggles his three fingers again, gives a cheerful wave, "I don't think even you are crazy enough to try this."
Tony: I had to deflect the PR crisis that was Lagos and to put out the political fire. No one else was doing it!
When he'd finally sent the young woman home to her grandmother, Steve turned to Tony, and to their table, and to their ice-cream, now melted. It became apparent to Steve in a flash: something was changed. Tony's stance was more guarded now. His expression smiley but glassy. Closed up, all of a sudden. He seemed to be rapidly retreating behind his barricades.
It felt unreal, like a scene from a movie. It was as if brain fog had descended on Tony's thoughts. And then it all swam back into focus, and suddenly it was real.
. So, you yell at each other for a bit and let all the steam out at once or you bicker and let it out gradually. And we didn't really allow ourselves that outlet. It felt incredibly ungrateful to gripe at him because he forgot about a lunch with friends because he couldn't be bothered to tell Friday to remind him. It was trivial. Unimportant. Who cared about lunches when we somehow got reunited, defying death and laws of the universe. So we put those things aside.
Tony leaned closer to both of them, almost pulling them into a huddle, and shared a piece of gossip. It was harmless, funny, so why did it rub Steve so wrong? An unexpected laugh escaped from Sharon's lips, jingling and surprised, and as she turned her eyes on Tony in mock-reproach, Steve felt a stab of hot jealousy again, even though this time,
"We got them at a flee market, actually," Steve muttered, but the responding amused snort brought him back to his senses. "We need to concentrate on the mission now," he said quickly, curtly, trying to cut this off because it was so easy to sink into chatter. It was somehow even easier now that Tony wasn't right by his side, with that mocking curve to his mouth and those eyes that always kept Steve on edge.
In the classroom, Stark, it seemed, wasn't doing anything. The board was meticulously wiped already. Tony just stood next to it, apparently deep in thought. So deep, as a matter of fact, that it appeared contrived. Almost as if he were waiting.
Rhodey meant well – well, of course he did, it was Rhodey. He just wanted to make light, get Tony to relax a little. Still, Tony failed to laugh. His heart constricted in his chest for a moment, no matter how much he tried to pretend it didn't. Anxiety? Anticipation? Both, really, hopelessly entangled in his mind. He touched the phone in his pocket, a knee-jerk reaction; refrained from pulling it out.
and all that. A modicum of respect will be enough. And I do know these lines tend to get blurred this far out in the Black. And I know you and your fellas are no soldiers – yet. But, from you, at least, I'd expect to know better. So don't step over that line. The demerit on your first day – that's quite an accomplishment, by the way. It stays for now. It means..." Cap paused.
But after he got back from Siberia, Pepper was there for him. They got close again, but they weren't together.
Tony: Does it always have to be like that? With us? Always locking horns, no matter how much we try?
"What date was it?" Tony asked quietly. "When they got you. Do you know?" Because it was a pretty innocent question, and not too personal, and Tony really wanted to know. He
Tony considered. It didn't really need any more consideration, but cursorily, he checked his feelings. There was nothing there any more. "I did," he said quickly. "I don't."
He's just a superior officer, so what, Tony tried telling himself. He had no idea why he was being this nervous. Nervous, yes, but also a little pissed, because... did Cap really have to come down here in order to bust him? Now, on his first day? What was the big idea, to kick him off the force before Tony even started?
Darryl being Darryl, he did seem tired but not overly perturbed. He clapped his hands twice, but since people (being people) didn't exactly fall silent, he just started speaking, briefing anyone nearby as to what was going on, giving terse instructions. He sounded mildly dejected, of all things, and spoke in his typical monotone.
"What I mean to say is," Thor said, leaning forward, so that only Tony could hear, "when that happens, you need to recognize it." And then, abruptly louder: "I still cannot fathom that the fair lady was partial to the dauntless Captain Marvel, but would hardly even look at me twice. I am, after all, the deity of her ancestors; I should think I deserve some notice." This was just a tad too booming and convivial to be genuine. Thor's attempt at diverting attention, then; because, Tony saw, Peter was coming over – all knees and elbows and awkward angles in his fancy new suit Tony had helped him pick out. And Tony was suddenly grateful, whether to Thor for changing the subject or to little Pete for inducing the change, he couldn't be sure.
Steve pulled himself to his full height. He had a determined slant to his mouth. "You already know what I think about wasting time and not making a good use of the moment I am given. And not kissing you tonight would be a waste of time." He kissed Tony again, then, and this time it was deep and thorough and not shy at all.
Tony is off him in an instant, and with a coldness in his gut Steve wonders if he's just going to walk out – just leave him like this and go. But Tony is just reaching for the lube Steve had left on the bedside table.
He knew his voice was going to be croaky even before he started speaking. "Tell me I'm crazy," he said. "Tell me there's nothing going on here and I'm just crazy."
The conversation with his newly acquired man of intrigue had taken a depressing turn, but they were entering the postcard town already. It occurred to him that Steve would get out now, soon, and vanish from his life forever. The hole in his stomach couldn't be stemming from that fact. Could it? Well, could it?
find it admirable, the way Steve faced his fears without rushing headlong into danger in order to prove them nonexistent. But he couldn’t just say that, could he? It was difficult to gauge what a proper reaction would be, so: “Kudos to you for that.” And then, a beat later: “No, I actually mean it. But I bet you’d have liked Malibu better. Beaches and all.”
took in survivors. There was suddenly enough techs for three full shifts, and the old common room was pitifully small.
Steve's hand was still clutching Tony's arm, and if Tony didn't have a bruise from it tomorrow, he'd be damned. His own fingers clenched into a fist,
He could have supplied half a dozen acerbic responses Tony could have had to that, but Tony seemed uncharacteristically quiet. Steve finished the veggies and transferred them neatly into a bowl. He looked up.
He looked tired and overstimulated, so I dragged him off to a nearby park and made him sit down on a bench. It was early evening already, the air was warm (it was early June there, I found out later), and I had Tony with me; for the first time that day I thought: I could do this.
But then, even before the ship quite touched down, the ramp opened, and a stream of people, armed and ready, started swarming to the ground. His heart leaped at the familiarity of shapes in their mismatched body armor, Coulson and May and Quake, Hill and Clint, and also others. And there was Fury in a long black coat, standing at the ramp, a megaphone in his hand, cool as if he's just stepped out of a bath, and yet managing to be intimidating somehow. The man would probably be intimidating in his bathrobe. "Nobody move!" he shouted. He didn't sound particularly invested in it, but then again, he didn't have to be.
Tony was his subordinate and this just... couldn't happen. It was all in subtle hints, all a suggestion, an undercurrent, barely there at all – but it still couldn't happen. Steve kept skirting the lines when he should keep firmly away.
"Tony? It's you." Steve's voice sounded sluggish, slurred, but when Tony looked him in the face, the blue eyes seemed better focused.
It seemed that, since he decided not to do this any more, things just got harder instead the other way around.
figure it out in the end, by which time it was almost too late. We changed the plan on the fly. And besides, who can tell what the best course of action is in those circumstances. What were we supposed to do? Give up on public protection, let the Hydra assholes lay destruction on the city and deal with this? Or let superserum go, and do damage control. We tried to do both. And it was a partial success. We controlled the damage in part. A lot of damage was still caused. People were hurt. We caused some too. We tried to save as many people as possible. We did capture the serum, but we cannot be sure it was all there was of it. We're not even sure it's the working serum; it's been around before, a few times that I know of – another thing I shouldn't be releasing to the public, I guess. These serums never really worked exactly the way they were supposed to, but they tend to cause havoc either way.
Tony: Listen, I want the coordinates. Of where you go. Next time you are on a mission. ALL the next times.
Tony: Look, you don't know until you try. I never said they didn't work. I said I wasn't happy with the side effects.
And then Tony was there, smiling genially, kissing Sharon on the cheek, chatting politely for a minute. And Steve could do this, he could. They were... Give or take everything else, they were friends, and he couldn't let his unchecked feelings ruin that. But then Tony sneaked a look at him, one of those searing hot looks under his eyelashes. Steve's stomach clenched painfully. The anger surged back, then, because what business did Tony have, looking at him like that. Let him look at Peter Quill like that. (Steve didn't have a problem with Peter, he told himself, repeatedly and not as convincingly as he might have wanted; he had a problem with
It wasn't that he hadn't forgiven Steve. He had. They'd both explained; they'd both understood. People screwed up. It happened. He'd wanted to move on, yet he hadn't been sure how to. He hadn't wanted to lose all contact, he had known that much. But the how, the why – it was easier to push the questions away and to work on everything else. Steve's request had felt like an ultimatum.
Tony: It's going live tomorrow. Exclusively on Everhart's network for 24 hrs, then I'm putting the whole bulk of the thing on the net.
Very intensely, Tony didn't want to say it back all of a sudden. Because missing someone was wishing for them to be
He let me do what I wanted for a few minutes, and then, as if he'd had enough of my fumbling, he pushed me back against a closed door, and proceeded to kiss me thoroughly, now nipping at my lip, now tilting my chin up so he could kiss a trail along my neck. I just closed my eyes and let him. Fireworks in my chest. Mist in my eyes. I'd never been much good with metaphors. But I, inconsequentially, remembered reading a book called
Tony meets Natasha's eyes as he and Steve break apart. Natasha deadpans. "Whatever," she tells him. "Just don't break Steve."
Steve's hand flew to his own face, for all the world as if a strange alien life form had sprung up on his face. And the beard didn't look
I leaned my hip against the kitchen island and looked at him intensely. Probably too intensely, in all honesty. "Yes." I can be very verbose when I want to, you see.
A nod. Then, since Tony felt a better explanation was in order, he added: "I have a mother and a father of all colds, thanks very much for asking, and the electricity's out too."
Throughout this rendition, Peter’s face grew redder and redder like he was about to explode in protestations or laughter.
, I'm getting over my dislikes pretty fast," Steve says, and his voice is low and husky and Tony knows Steve is just poking fun at him, but it still sends a shiver through him. And really, what's with all the handsiness today?
Less reluctantly, Banner moved away to make some space for Tony, then turned his book around, showing him the title. "It's just a medical journal."
Impatiently, Tony slipped a hand down Steve's boxers, and grabbed hold of him. Steve produced something between a gasp and a whimper; a part of Tony that wasn't completely drowned in sensations though, half coherently:
“Well,” Tony considered. “I’m back at being able to form a sentence, apparently; but I’m still Cousin Boneless.”
Steve barked a laugh, just once. But in his eyes, something sparked; Tony could have sworn he saw the flecks of green flash inside the blue. And in one single stroke he pounded the rest of the way in. Tony sucked in air through his teeth. The stroke hadn’t been hard, nor angry, but it was forceful.
"Tony," Steve said. A gust of wind blew inwards, showering Tony's feet with whiteness, making him shudder. He wrapped the bathrobe tighter about him and sneezed again. Fished for a handkerchief in his pocket.
Tony: Yeah, with you. In private. At one in the morning. When I'm too fucking exhausted to worry about showing vulnerability, ffs.
"Yeah, running feels really good when you get used to it, doesn't it?" Cap was now saying. "I just wanted to tell you that, if you felt any pressure from me to keep doing it – don't. You're all right. Don't.. er. Don't overexert yourself."
. He wasn't sure where he wanted this to go, but a bit of impulsiveness and adventure never hurt anyone, right?
– and sometimes it was peaceful and warm and sad, and sometimes it was turbulent and jagged, but never too little, never cold or indifferent
Steve's face felt stiff and frozen, like a piece of solid ice. "Excuse me," he said curtly and fled back into the corridor. Was Stark doing this on purpose?
"Hey," Steve said. His voice sounded a bit watery. Tony nodded to him, because voice was just a distant possibility at that point, and in some part of his brain that wasn't completely clouded over he figured he wouldn't want to sound all high-pitched, would he now. That would be totally humiliating.
"It's good to know, you know," he commented after a bite. "That somewhere out there I beat you to it." The show of impudence was barely holding together, but Tony was giving it his best shot. His hand was frantically toying with the salt shaker. Here, his nervous ticks were showing way more; either he didn't care to hide them, or this was all too much for him. It was almost too much for
Tony: Well, he left what amounts to a suicide note, so not really. He wanted to try the new serum, which worked beautifully, in case you wanted a hulk – apparently it was the batch acquired in Madripoor, so basically your story is now officially confirmed. You should see how quickly everyone is washing their hands of this. One would think Ross went over there himself, alone, on foot, and bought the thing with his own pocket money.
making? I don't know, and Strange would probably tell me it's for the best that I don't. I sort of agreed to it tacitly when I came here, didn't I? He strongly implied that Tony needed me, and I jumped. I had my misgivings. Still after seeing them spend some time together, today, I'm beginning to think perhaps Strange did it simply for Tony. To comfort him. And if that's the case: hell, I'm game.
Tony: No, actually no, I really don't. But all the other options were way worse. I literally have no one to put in charge, I have no one who is both capable and, you know, trustworthy. So, yeah, shut up. Knight to c3.
"Perhaps the stable hands down in the yard will have seen something..." the other man began, but a glare from Tony cut him in half.
He thought he detected a jerk of irritation in Steve. Tony wasn't doing it on purpose, not exactly – whatever he was doing. It was just that his mind was racing million miles a second in every tangential direction imaginable, and he could feel his feet vibrate with the urge to do something, anything.
"Steve," Tony says again, willing him, forcing him to focus. His strength is gushing out, his voice weakening. "I need to tell you. I never told you."
to, and he has to screw it up by lashing out? He wanted to reverse it, erase it. Once in his life ignore a burn and just move on. He wanted to plan! He wanted to know how Steve had got caught, and what he was doing in this part of the world anyway, and what he saw on his way in, while he still could see anything. The number of attackers. The lay of the land.
Tony: Well, everyone has their reasons, eh? I can think of at least two Avengers who volunteered for a similar type of experiments for reasons all their own, Steve.
. And now all he could think about was the smile that brightened up Steve's face at the misconceived idea Tony
Tony slumps on the bed. "Okay, you've proved your point. I'm sorry. Even if I hadn't been earlier, I'd be
it could be, if only Steve felt the same... But he wouldn't let his mind go down that lane, not now. Just a few minutes later, a packet of lube in hand, they were kissing again, and then Tony prodded Steve to turn around. Steve put both hands against the wall and bent forward.  The outline of his back, his ass, the back of his head – it made Tony want to scream with wanting, with need. He wanted to
"And would you also care to explain that?" Tony said, then heard the way he sounded. He ran a hand over his face, shook his head. "Sorry," he said, and Steve nodded. "Long day. Just... long day."
Things were happening relatively fast as Tony sat there, musing. Soon enough, Steve sent the girl home with a stern talking to and a slice of pie. He was, Tony reflected, completely and utterly unbelievable.
. He had himself neatly convinced he simply had a huge soft spot for the guy, even though he tended to push all of Tony's irritation-buttons, enthusiastically and repeatedly and all at once. In the last year or two, Tony had even thought he was mostly cured from his non-feelings. Leipzig and Siberia had proven him spectacularly, hilariously wrong. It was a miracle, how good he was at burying his emotions into these tiny shit piles in order to hide them from himself. They were probably glaringly obvious to anyone else who cared to take a glance.
don't." He looked a little frantic, to Tony. His hand was resting on the door-handle, but Tony couldn't tell if he was anxious to get out or if he was holding the door closed, so to say.
"We should get back inside," Steve said crisply, and just like that, he seemed to relax. His whole body changed. And something sharp that had been there disappeared from his face, his eyes.
you? Steve, they don't have another captain of the air group, they don't have another flight instructor, and they most definitely don't have another battle leader, they..."
"Well, I... figured you probably needed your sleep," Steve went on. "I'm, ah, I'm going to get up now."
Tony told himself what he felt was impatience. Definitely not jealousy. That would be ridiculous. Daisy was a very pretty woman, though. And it seemed everyone
Our eyes met, and for a moment we just stared at each other, almost amused despite everything. It was the two of us, the way we always were when we weren't at odds. In that moment, staring into his eyes, I thought my heart would explode. It had thought it wouldn't experience an easy moment like that, with him, ever again; it hadn't been ready.
. Probably one of the biggest lies in the history of space travel. He made himself concentrate, made himself brief Hope, analyze the situation and formulate a plan. (He'd always worked well with Hope, Hope was probably the best engineer on the team anyway.)
The mop-wielding, broom-brandishing men and women were invading the space around them now. Tony promised himself to send a dozen cleaning bots to the chief of palace staff, as a thank-you-sorry-amalgam.
He swallowed. He kept it in check. Before he quite knew what he was doing, he zeroed in on Thor. You could talk to Thor without too much preamble, thankfully.
"I hope so, Steve. I hope so," he said quietly. He did hope that. Out there, in the infinity of worlds, anything was possible, right?
But then the cruiser he was on – supposedly safe, guarded by a squadron of gunstar grade battleships – had been intercepted by a large Cylon force. That was almost three months ago. It seemed like three lifetimes. Anything before the battle had an unreal quality to it in his memories. The battle itself had been a nightmare. Aftermath was... like waking up, in one of those old science fiction novels Tony liked; you realized your whole life had been a virtual reality, and you were
Well, this was like that, only he was the object of unwelcome desire, this time around. Steve probably hated the fact he was attracted to him. And he was better than Tony at controlling it. His righteous ass probably never even considered hate-fucks an option.
Her eyes look haunted, which I notice only because she allows me to. Of course, if Natasha is alive here, it must mean Clint is dead. She must have figured out from my reaction it was the other way around where I'm coming from.
Tony: As established previously, if all of us had talked more, lots of this could have been avoided.
"Yes," she says firmly. "And it's been twenty years," she adds with a touch of dry amusement, just to distract us all, I think. "You can stop calling yourself a
"Wait," Steve said as a sudden inspiration for a change of topic hit fortuitously. "You're picking up young highlanders. I heard it on the grapevine. So where
Something pierced Tony’s midsection. An acute awareness that he’d fucked up, although he couldn’t quite understand how or why. It was a sickly feeling and Tony hated it. “I remember now,” he said gently. “
"I got that," Tony replied, but it sounded too curt and dry even for him, so he tried again. "Me too, buddy. Look, I do know. You've been punishing yourself enough. You need to stop."
now (but a good sort of too much!). And he never stopped moving inside Tony, now with choppy, short jabs. Tony opened his eyes, to see Steve’s face contorted  above him, as if in pain. And Steve jerked one more time, shuddered, and his whole body went stiff; stayed like that for a moment. And then he collapsed on top of Tony, panting wetly. It sounded almost like sobbing. Tony put both his arms around him, pulling him closer, rubbing his back, the back of his neck. He lifted his own head and placed a small kiss amid Steve’s hair. The sweet warmth that rose in his chest pretty much equaled the orgasm in intensity.
inside him. And the sex had been exactly like that too, thrilling and intense and risky, like Steve had always imagined it would be with Tony.
Tony laughed, more in relief than anything else. “Oh, that’s okay, you’re okay, Rogers, don’t worry.” And he wondered at his own sense of relief, and he wondered at his own overly dramatic reaction to every word Steve said, as if they were all pregnant with emotional meaning, as if even the most innocent comment was a missile they shot at each other. And he knew, he
Just for a moment Tony wants to stop the time, to dream, to pretend it's all real, that this is what they are to each other.
A snort, that somehow didn’t sound too amused. “Nothing. You never showed up. So I left.” He fished one hand out from under the blankets and absently ran his fingers through Tony’s hair, just the once.
happen in Madripoor. What didn't happen was, the Avengers didn't interfere. What didn't happen was, the Avengers didn't enter another sovereign country without an explicit permission from the said country [mutters indistinguishably]. What didn't happen was... [quietly: who wrote this shit anyway?]
Everything happens somewhere. There is an infinite number of timelines, an infinite number of possibilities; the forks in the road are innumerable. The point isn't that a butterfly wing here may cause a hurricane there. The point isn't that a coin, randomly dropped on the street, may change history, or
He leaned over the passenger seat to open the window. And he wasn't crazy either. He was in the middle of nowhere, alone, at night. He had one hand on the suitcase that could easily turn into his Mark V suit. He was prepared, even though the said hand was a bit quivery with exhaustion.
He's pushing words out by sheer force of will. "Do... three... Put three... fingers... in me." He hears Tony's words in his head again:
Tony stared at it for a time. His lips moved almost mutely, and if not for the serum, I wouldn't have been able to hear his faint whisper:
And now, afterwards – he went on, tormenting himself –  he would cover Steve's shoulders with tiny, soft kisses, like snowflakes, and maybe give him a back rub, and let his hands roam freely, now that the initial urgency has been sated. And – god, he had to stop this, he had to.
His eyes closed, he lay there for a time, wondering why anticipation felt so close to apprehension, and, when he’s at that, why apprehension felt so close to dread, and why thee fuck it was so difficult to discern between the three. In that company, happiness was certainly an uninvited guest, and still, the cheeky thing was there, snaking through his stomach, warming him from the inside, no matter how much he tried to ignore it.
Tony: I conveniently forgot you and Natasha did something of the sort a few years back, honestly, so I thought you were going to go all judgy on me.
He took Steve by the arm and guided him towards the bed behind a folding screen. He sprawled on his back. He took a few shuddering breaths that didn’t do much in the way of calming him down. “What,” he forced the words out. “What do you want to do?”
We hang out, Tony and I, and it's nothing like that period when I arrived in my Tony's timeline and we became inseparable. This time around there is less ice-cream and cuddling and quiet talks long into the night. Well. There is basically none of that. Instead, there is bickering and challenging each other and pointed questions and discussion. But, oh my god, we talk, and it's Tony, and I feel strange excitement surge up in me whenever he says: "Nonono, Big, wait a
(he had always been  prone to swagger and bravado, really); but Steve had insisted they should continue king Arthur's legacy, and a well-known and well-honored name should be the first step. The two of them had gone on arguing about it and yelling at each other even though they basically agreed, until Thor came up with the compromise.
And then – impossibly – there's the harder pressure again, against his sweet spot, the soft circles being rubbed into the prostate wall just where the piquant promises turn into the red heat, but
They walked towards the elevator, side by side, bumping elbows, and Tony was saturated in warm glow, a golden feeling, as if this was going to lead somewhere, somewhere good and right, and not stay frozen mid-motion forever, the way it had to.
He was nodding along, but seemed too impatient to let me finish. "Yeah, yeah, I had my meltdown and stormed off, and then you fucked off to kill Thanos, much good it did, but whatever, you got back, we proceeded to fuck each other's brains out that night, and then tomorrow, we came here for shawarma and actually talked, and we reconciled for good, and then...
"I love you," he says, still drunk from the kiss, and it's like a crack in a dam, and a trickle turns into a flood, and then it's unstoppable. "I love you, and oh god, we're so fucked up, and I have no idea if we can work it all out or not, and I've no idea
else, Tony would have ascribed this to the darkness around them. But this was Steve fucking Rogers, and thanks to the serum, he had not only superhearing and a wide array of other goodies, but also a type of dark vision. Tony had always been a bit envious of that. Now the memory just made him feel worse.
Except for Tony. Because, everything began and ended with him, and him Steve missed always, and he couldn't tear his gaze away.
.) "I'd have thought you'd be out of here by now, honestly." It seemed almost like a question, almost as if Tony was expecting something from him, an answer, an explanation, but of what? And the terrifying realization that Tony saw
Tony: The only advice I can give you right now is what Pepper told me this morning. Because we actually talked, which is good news.
He was pretty sure he heard Steve gulp. "Yeah," the man whispered, barely audible on the other side. "Yeah, okay."
The longer Bruce spoke, the more Tony's face darkened. Natasha had just decided to somehow step in before he could rush off without having acquired all the necessary information, when Clint slipped into the room.
this had to carry a hidden significance, but try as he might, he was drawing a complete blank. “Really? I have no memory of it whatsoever. What did we do?”
dislike. Or maybe... He had no idea, and he had even less idea as to why he cared what Captain thought, but somehow he did. Whatever it was, it was driving him crazy. Tony had managed to drink a lot in a short time, and this stuff was motor-oil strong; he could feel it burning in his gut, making his tongue run loose. The subtle desperation of the people around him was both infectious and suffocating. The beat of it in his ears was louder than the white noise of general chatter.
I'd expected I'd be all quivery when I started talking to him, but he was the one that looked shaken. My focus seemed to have returned to me after
Tony wasn't sure if he could handle seeing him strip any further, now that it would – essentially – be just for fun.
"Okay," Steve whispered. He also sounded weary, and just a little broken somewhere below the surface. He drew marginally closer to Tony.
Tony turned the headlights on, started the car carefully, and glanced Steve's way – now that he could see him a bit better – arching an eyebrow.
," Tony commands him, and Steve opens his eyes forcibly. Watches the tails caress his cock for a moment, making it twitch, strive to feel more than the tickling of leather. Then Tony raises the flogger again.
Steve didn’t even nod. He just closed the distance. Their faces were inches apart. Steve breathed Tony’s air for a second, then touched lips to his.  Tony closed his eyes. He was aware of the press of lips in a careful, boyish kiss. His thoughts moved down. Their hands, holding onto each other, now trapped in a burning furnace between their stomachs. Lower yet. Their erections pressed tightly against each other, pulsing in unison. Steve’s arms weren’t around Tony, and Tony’s weren’t around him either. There was nothing holding them so close, apart from the desire to touch, to finally feel the other with your whole body. They had both pushed their pelvises out, longingly, desperately, belying the innocence of the kiss.
The landing bay wasn't small, and Tony wasn't in an overly great form any more, honestly. Well. Ten rounds every day should certainly help with that if he didn't collapse first. But he suspected that wasn't the point; he suspected the point was the tiny humiliation – being seen running around, by the techs in front of whom he'd been insolent to Rogers. Well, he probably deserved it, and what's more, he could rock it like he rocked everything else. He never really minded exercise either.
"I mean," he says, "that we were on the team together for like two seconds, all in all, years ago. And then I left, and then you left, and then, with Thanos, we were mostly on different sides of the world, or worlds. Bad timing, I don't know. I just..."
I've tried  living my life quietly, here. I've tried to fade into the background and stay there. The problem with that is that it's
Unexpectedly, something is pressed into his perineum, firmly, almost too hard. Steve recognizes the pommel, twisting, turning; digging in at the very edge of actual pain, at the very edge of too much. But then it's like a whole new orgasm rushes to the surface in the middle of his old one, and it floods all his senses and his body is shaking violently, and his prostate sings.
An unexpected snort of laughter escaped Steve, and it seemed to break the spell, Steve grabbed him by the waist, pulled him closer, his palm now a solid presence at the small of Tony's back. Their chests were touching, and the stomachs and groins were burning against each other. His thoughts fled for a time, as he turned his face up to capture Steve's lips. The kiss was white hot and solid and so full of heart Tony thought he would cry. If he wasn't in Steve's arms he might have slumped to the floor, which, on second thought, wouldn't have been so bad either.
"You do love this place," he commented. I nodded. I was a bit sentimental perhaps, but what I actually loved about the place was the current company, and that's the plain truth.
"What?" Steve asked. He located what looked like a chemical fire that could easily be the source of the thickest, blackest smoke.
"You kept them," Steve managed, tearing his gaze away from Tony and looking around the office, at the drawings that still lined the walls.
She'd been by his side nearly every day for the past twenty years. "Steve, it's incredible. You were sent to us like a..." She trails off, probably not wanting to sound corny.
the voice breezed through the room again. Well, if nothing else, the war and the aftermath had worked beautifully as a matchmaking service.
Steve leaned closer to his face, hovering over Tony a little. Surprised, Tony made as if to pull back, but he didn't exactly have anywhere to go. He just slowly blinked at Steve, momentarily frozen in place.
of it, evidently" the medic snapped. "I'm letting this air out a moment, then I'll dress it. Better to be on the safe side."
Tony had been inching in the general direction of his horse ever since Steve first addressed him. Now he waved one hand towards the animal. "I should, ah, be on my merry way before it gets really dark."
." It was just possible he thought Steve had pointed at him, but Steve somehow thought that wasn't the case. Most likely he wanted to show off. Stark paused, however, reconsidered, and then he mellowed down his tone. "It doesn't need to be aerodynamically shaped for space flight," he explained. "For space flight you don't need the tail, the elevons, the rudder. You don't need wings." He gave a mock-apologetic shrug, looking back over his shoulder at the rest of the cadets. He grinned. "No drag." The other guys actually chuckled at that.
Why was it so easy to believe Steve? When Tony tried telling that to himself, it never worked, but once Steve put it to words, it was like a charm taking hold.
Being dismissed wasn't an overly pleasant feeling, but it was a very Tony thing to do. He was starting a project. In such situations, he usually expected people around him to magically disappear from view and let him work. But this wasn't one of Tony's intrinsic designs, this was just dinner, and while the way people turned raw ingredients into delicious food still mystified Steve, he didn't think he needed to make himself scarce in order to let Tony cook. If he thought his presence was making Tony uncomfortable, he'd be out of the kitchen a million times already, but Tony was being warm and expansive and flirty, and appeared to be genuinely enjoying Steve's company. Steve didn't want to spend the evening dozing on the couch instead.
"Yeah," Steve repeated, for lack of something better to say. He thought this whole training thing was going to turn into a big old disaster pretty fast. "I'm not sure that's going to be enough."
aloud; bites his lips hard instead. Still, a harsh breath on the verge of a moan escapes his lips, uncontrollable, as Tony pushes them as deep as they would go –
Tony forced himself to step back so that Steve could come in. Steve, however, seemed frozen at the door.
Tony rolled his eyes, but obediently turned to Peter. "Just ‘Tony’ is fine, Pete. I've told you that before." Then his grin turned evil. "Or you can call me Papa Tony, if you want."
"I just meant, the places where you live tend to be more... well, modern?" Steve said, seemingly caressing the timber walls with his eyes.
Two steps towards Steve, like in a  haze. The coldness in the pit of his stomach and the scorching need in his cock finally met, and mixed, and the results were... interesting. He felt his eyes finally drawn to Steve’s, fixed on them. The passionate, stubborn intensity of Steve’s gaze couldn’t be replicated, no matter how much Tony started at the photos sometimes. His eyes were boring into Tony’s, face still frowning as he tried to get a read on him. Steve’s breathing was audible, or perhaps Tony’s mind was zeroing in on anything of Steve’s.
Tony: I don’t want to be smart about this. Everyone gets to be silly about things like this. I hate smart.
winter gear, but with a different function in mind. A function of hiding his face. Only then did Tony notice a gun. It was so out of place in the whole Hallmark movie setting that its presence simply couldn't fit into his head.
Steve nodded. "I thought it was a drug, but now I think it was a drug plus some kind of serum suppressant." His voice was emotionless, flectionless. As if he was briefing Tony on something completely emotionally unrelated. "Later, I was partly aware of something being poured into my eyes. Oh, and they took quite a lot of blood samples before the injection."
, after all these years, and this was far from all Steve wished for, from him, but it was also more than he could have hoped for.
"All the profits go to charity," Steve said slowly, resignedly. "I just sign the papers. I don't really look at the designs."
of a jerk.“ Because it was true, and he could outjerk Steve any day, he could outjerk him ten to one.
Steve was silent for several seconds. "When I told him to go for a run, it was almost a joke," he said. "I didn't think he'd keep it up this long."
Tony used to be angry at Steve for what happened between them, in Germany, in Siberia. He's not any longer. Now he's just... resigned to the fact that Steve doesn't care one bit. That's what used to hurt the most, before Tony made his peace with it. It doesn't, any longer.
The simulator was forgotten. Tony moved a nanometer forward. Then another. Were seconds passing at all? Minutes? Or did they enter some kind of a weird time loop? Were they moving toward each other at all? Would the parallel lines ever cross, somewhere far ahead, in the planes of infinity?
"Yeah," Tony says. "You should have. And also, I love you too. You figured that out, right? Because it took
want to know if he's fitting in? He's – don't give me that slow smile, for gods' sake – he's older than the others, and different, and he's unused to authority, and I don't know what to make of him. So I wanted to know what you thought. He's good – he's very good, actually – but is he going to stay good, once he's out in the Black? Is he going to panic? Is he going to be rash, like the elder Quint brother was?"
Tony just nodded. See, this worked marvelously too. Just let him squirm. He didn't have to say anything, even. "Uh-huh," he made himself say anyway.
"You've been sitting on this for twenty years," I say, and it might seem as if I'm talking about the shield, but I'm really not.
To his left, someone who could be Darryl, although it was impossible to tell because of the smoke and the suit, was, with a few other people, pulling someone from under the viper and
; and he'd spent most of the time after Siberia hoping he could just avoid seeing Steve again, for good, and forget about everything. That was only
Steve sighed. The air hurt in his lungs. Why did Tony have to come here to torture him like this? There's your
Tony: so heres something for you to chew on. i let you walk away. i was pulling my punches. that's my biggest regret. because i coulda turned u into a fucking 4th of july firework if id wanted to
panic. And all Tony had to do to close the distance between them would be to drop his face a little lower...
"Start from the beginning," Steve said firmly, just as Tony was opening his mouth to say something useful, and – Rogers, his mane is
"That's fine," Tony said quickly, increasingly reluctant to jeopardize this peace they'd finally found, this companionable snugness they were now sharing. "We could try planning for what to do next. Or, even better, you should try to go to sleep, or else we won't be able to do anything." And Tony could just lie there, next to him, and be aware of every moment that passed, and that would be quite all right with him, thanks.
And we did watch a movie. I picked a modern drama that Tony secretly enjoyed even though he shat on it all the while. And I didn't tear up at all, not even once. I considered it a victory.
In the middle of the road, in between the two extremes, lay honesty, undistilled and unspiced with sarcasm, and more naked than Tony was comfortable with. So he rushed to get it over with.
"What did he mean I was just bait?" he asked again, once they were at the top of the stairs and they stopped to rest for a minute. Although Tony could guess the answer by now, he had to ask, wanted to hear it from Steve.
“Yeah, it’s working because I’m all emotional because I’m having a meltdown from the stim. And the circumstances won’t be so easy to replicate since I’m not metabolizing that shit ever again.”
. Steve felt Tony's hands on him then, sliding up his arms then aback down, an unmistakable caress. There
Steve swallowed. "We could play cards or something," he managed finally. "If you want. You could be lying down," he added.
Tony fought a smile, gave up. "Not bad," he commented. They were still leaning against the railing, side by side, shoulders touching, and it was so
"Yeah, well. The guy was imprisoned for fifteen years, and we're supposed to believe he stayed moderately sane? I can barely do ten days without cracking, now."
Scarlet Witch and Steve Rogers are the only ones among us that have any kind of, what you would call, powers. I mean, Steve is just very strong, but whatever. The rest of us here are just normal guys, with a lot of training and good tech. I have no special powers. Natasha – Black Widow – doesn't either, though that's hard to believe. Neither does Sam. We just... we just use what we have to the best of our abilities. To try and do the damage control here, and to hunt down the bad guys.
when he realized that – no matter how much he told himself all he wanted was to make Steve eat snow – he’d been well aware of where this was going, or he should have been. And they were looking into each other’s eyes, lying there in the snow, and Tony was hyper aware of Steve’s hands at the small of his back, and he realized how delightfully weird but also natural this felt. Who could have imagined it last night? But today had changed something, thawed something. And although the last night’s almost-kiss on the brow had felt like a goodbye to Tony, he knew he wasn’t rational about any of it, at all. What if it had been a hello instead? It now felt as if they’d scrapped everything that had gone before and were back at first impressions, somehow. As if a million new options suddenly were opening around them, which was obviously a cause for even more panic, but it was a
Tony gazed at him, just for a moment, and their eyes met. Steve's face was smudged, his white shirt yellowish-red with dust, and he sported an array of scratches and what was going to turn into bruises – later – around his face and forearms. And yet – blessedly unharmed in any major way.
"So you decided to move the car out of the way?" Tony said dryly, because everything was weird, and this was his way of dealing with weird. A thank you might have been nicer, he knew. "You're a, what, a park ranger or something? Striding around the woodlands at night, protecting hobbits, freezing to death?"
He realized he was sort of glaring at Steve, who was looking at the items on the table, and then back at the sweets still left in the kitchen. Back and forth. Deliberately, Tony looked away. This was weird. One moment he wanted to pick up Steve, wrap him in blankets and ply him with hot soup until every trace of what happened to him faded, and the next moment he was about to pick a fight with him over something Steve
"I said I'm not sleepy," Tony cut him off before Steve tried to give the blankets back, as he probably would out of stupid nobility, and limped away to the other side of the cell.
The next time he went in, it was to bring Tony chicken soup. He'd found a can in the kitchen, poured it into a pan and warmed it over the fire in the sitting room. (That pan will never be the same again. Steve hoped Tony wasn't too attached to it.)
"What?" Tony said, eyes on Sharon. "Old friends, new acquaintances, all that. You can laugh at all the silly, stuck up people." And Sharon said something in response, but all Steve was aware of was Tony's hand o his shoulder, burning like a supernova, his fingers curling ever so slightly into the fabric of Steve's jacket. Steve wanted to push the hand away, angrily –
A few months back, he'd moved out of the Stark Tower to avoid remembering the time he'd lived there with Pepper. He moved back now because the memories of Pepper and the breakup seemed positively healthy and happy and bright in comparison.
, Fury had said. Well, Steve hoped so too; he intended to try. With a firmer hand, maybe, or... He had to keep his distance and try different approaches, try kindness, maybe, too. It worked with many people and it took least effort of all, for Steve.
Then – when it was beginning to look as if they would eventually turn to stone – with a considerable effort of will, Tony got up and walked over to the place where Steve stood staring at the book spines, his eyes vacant.
to him – he doesn't even want to know what, doesn't want to imagine it, just wants it to be something Tony wants,
Today. Today he'd let himself go. He was careless. It was as if he turned his rational self off and a stupid brainless Steve had taken over. A disaster almost happened. No, a disaster
He seems to snap out of it then. He raised his eyebrows in that way of his that looked more like a frown. "Yeah, no. Pepper and I are not together for a good reason. In this timeline at least." And you can't recreate people, stupid, he didn't say; very loudly so. Children are not bowling pins. They aren't interchangeable.
Since people have definitely noticed them, continuing with the game looks like the only way to go. Sighing inwardly, Tony smiles and snuggles closer to Steve. And just because he's aware that, for him, it's not just a game – well, not exactly, not with being this hyperaware of Steve's solid torso right next to him – Tony is beginning to feel self-conscious and ridiculous. With him, that never ends well. He's pretty sure there's a wave of hysterical babbling coming on, so he strikes a preemptive conversation with a guy in front of him, the one wearing a super-dentist T-shirt. With a Superman 'S' on the back.
. He saw the charred arm of the suit, the scorch marks all along his right side. And then the medic was pushing something at Steve, and Tony saw it was an oxygen mask. Something untwistable in his guts twisted. Before he realized what he was doing, he was hurrying over.
Still, we're not getting any younger. I'm perfectly aware of that. We play chess more often than we spar; or have sex. We cuddle or just sit next to each other far more frequently. We do go for a lot of walks, just the two of us or with Natasha. I know where this journey is headed, but for as long as we can string it along, we will. I can't think about what comes next or how the world is going gray around the edges and how we are slowing down, a little more with each passing day. I can't.
"Eh," Tony said, trying to hunt down his words and put them in proper order. "Burgundy, yeah. So. Hi, Steve. You all right?"
"He was in the first class I taught." If he didn't know better, Steve would have dubbed the look on Fury's face as fleeting melancholy. Thankfully, it passed in a moment. Fury shook his head. "I had him kicked out of school within two months."
). Steve sleeping – that had been more of a sensation, a color, a smell (it made no sense!). The drawing itself, however – Tony remembered the drawing in glaringly vivid details.
Tony: Both Rosses are in communication over this, as far as I've been able to discern from what I got. And a number of their satellites, minions, cronies and the like. Do you want names? I can give you names.
A sudden smile split Roger's face; he quickly looked down and hid it behind his hand, but it was unmistakably there. Tony was mesmerized. He found he couldn't look away. His lips stretched wryly in response to his own reaction. Well, he could count this as a win, he supposed.
wanted in turn: get to know him, it said. This is not your Tony, and if you want to have an honest relationship, romantic or platonic, with
Still, Tony's knuckles lingering on his cheek, and that soft, intense look in his eyes – Steve knew he hadn't been imagining that. And then they dried and fed the dog together as if they'd been doing such things every day for years. They were comfortable next to each other, without much need for words to understand what they needed to do. And okay, it was toweling a dog dry, not saving the world, but it was... something.
And maybe the truth was stupid too, but it was the truth, and you can’t pick your truths, and that was all there was to it.
It couldn't have been more awkward if they'd actually had sex, Tony thought. Steve started doing his stretches. Watching him work out felt like a violation of some kind now, although Tony had seen him exercise hundreds of times. Still, he found his gaze repeatedly drawn to him. The powerful moves and the deceptive ease he preformed them with. The familiar outline of his goddamn shoulders. Tony had missed this. And that stupid slash down his front wasn't helping either, but he wouldn't let his mind go there.
"I'm going to make it good for you," Tony promises, and realizes he somehow isn't worried about life and death situation so much as about pleasing Steve under the circumstances. "But you have to tell me what you want, as we go" he says. "You have to tell me what you
Tony: I imagine you should tell me what happened, if you can without breaking any confidences or whatever.
"That's exactly the same thing," Tony concluded, slowly warming up to the game. Because just listening to a voice that wasn't his own made it less cold, less dark somehow. The fact that it was
"Who's that? Who are you talking to?" That was Tony's indistinct, crackly voice over the comm. Steve'd forgotten to turn the mick off.
It was all surreal, since he woke up, but perhaps most surreal of all was running into Howard's son in a car by the roadside on Christmas Eve. Steve was trudging back home after
"Where to?" Tony asked. "I'm just passing through, but I can give you a lift to pretty much anywhere in the hood. As long as we don't end up in a snowdrift."
them, but somehow not like this. The fact cut his gut in half, and that was the moment he knew he was in deep shit.
wasn't so well equipped when it came to medical supplies or gear. The doctors had to improvise, and many wounds had to be waited out and infused with a lot of hope on daily basis. "Volstagg wanted to know all the details about the
that Steve thinks: he must be inside the armor. He must. And still, the idea, the image of Tony, somewhere out there, in his lab, directing the armor from afar, and
They were standing on the porch, and the moments were ticking by, and Tony was looking at Steve, and Steve was looking at Tony. The night was dry and starry and nearly bright, and the cicadas seemed louder and louder with every moment the two of them kept silent.
," he said. "I'm sure you're very used to throwing yourself into near-death situations routinely, but I don't have the stomach for watching you do that any more."
" I was tired and, ridiculously enough, overwhelmed with sharp nostalgia for our life from two minutes before, before I'd said something immensely stupid that now couldn't be unsaid. I missed the easy, unthinking touches that suddenly seemed unattainable. I couldn't have them back. Even though barely a foot separated us, Tony was a million miles away.
. Captain's face stopped him in his tracks. It effectively killed off all of Tony's attempts to make light and charm his way out of this one.
, it's just Steve getting back at him for today. It's not a real come-on. Not that Tony would want it to be. Definitely not.
It was worth it, if only to finally see Natasha speechless for once. "Uh," she said, "So I can stop trying to set you up with cute marines, then. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say now. Did you like it? Is that what I should ask?"
Tony: Because when I say shitty things to you, with your probable depression, I go wondering what's going on, what's going through your head afterwards.
He wanted children. I could go one way or another with that, but I was always supportive. We did talk about adoption many times, but in the end we never did it. Still, it was a charmed life. We did a lot of things in those years, despite the fact we'd decided we'd done enough and we were going to just kick back and enjoy. We did retire from the Avengers. We came out of the retirement when we were needed, and Tony restored his Steve's shield for me, for that occasion. It made me feel like my old self, and I both liked it and didn't. Then, a bit later, we retired again. We did rebuild the compound. We also trained and raised at least two full generations of new Avengers. We moved house a few times. We even lived in the cottage by the lake for a decade and a half; Tony had always wanted to, and I thought it was sweet, that he still had those ideas of idyllic life. Me, I loved every place we lived together; in the end, it was as simple as that.
Tony wanted to breathe, but at the moment that goal seemed unattainable. Looking at Steve's stoic, calm face was an impossibility. Tony turned away. Limped over to the cell door. Put both hands on it and leaned over. Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Across the room, that had been slowly filling for the past half hour, his eyes met Tony's. Snapping together, like two poles of a magnet. Steve felt his heart falter for a moment, unsure whether to stop or to start beating faster. Suddenly it was all too much. He remembered this one conversation with Tony, years ago, when they'd stayed up late at night, drinking very black coffee, in that short, happy time they had all stayed in the Tower together. Steve sometimes wondered if that time ever happened. It felt incredibly short, while it lasted. But now, looking back, it seemed to stretch indefinitely, like memories of childhood: every evening was like a year, every sentence seemed to bear significance.
"You seem like a sensible person." She tossed him two small packages. "Wipe your hands with a disinfectant, then apply this crap to his burn. You're not doing anything anyway. I'll be back in a jiffy."
Tony: You don't have to reply or anything if it's making you anxious. Because it can make you anxious. I know. In any case, don't worry
He’d never admit that, but he’d been a little nervous about this piste to begin with, even when he thought it was still an actual
"No, no," Tony interrupted him quickly. Bluntly. "I have to go. Sorry." Then, as an afterthought. "Your majesty."
"Yeah," Steve said thoughtfully. "That's pretty much the impression I got. Will you keep an eye on him for me?"
And then it was just him and Steve, outside on a balcony like back in the old days, and the sun was shining for once, and Tony found himself at a loss for words. Which was unacceptable, obviously. "Yeah," he said. "So that’s Peter."
Steve. Looking out for Tony, as always. But, then again, Steve was simply like that; he'd try to protect everyone, anyone. That was one of the reasons Tony just couldn't possibly look away whenever he was in the room. That, and the way his hair fell into his eyes; but just a little bit. Really. You'd have to be crazy to think this was about looks.
to believe him, it seemed too fanciful: that story, how his ship was attacked, and how Tony propelled himself in a shuttle and crashed on this... little moon, as Fury called it, even though it didn't seem quite so little to Steve. It
Tony: I'm just, if this is being shut down, I want to do something about it. I've had enough of being sidelined. I need to do something. And not just uncensor the vid. Something real.
"Nice to meet you," Steve responded automatically, then hesitated a second. But it seemed the decision was already made. If he were going to say
loved you. Back then, he and I were the same person. And when our timelines diverged... He and I are still enough of the same person for me to know, by all these" – I indicated the drawings – "that he never stopped loving you."
Steve gave him an earnest look. Raised his arm as if to pat Tony on the shoulder, blushed slightly and jerked his hand back as if burned. "Thank you very much," he managed stiffly, to Tony's growing irritation.
with all the stubbornness you can muster. I never really lacked in that department. Neither did Tony. We're not exactly know for giving up. But, you know, most of it was good. Most of it was
Steve cleared his throat. "You, er, Stark. The left hand corridor." That was the one that lead to the landing bay and the storage area and the side engines.
Tony did care about the question of the multiverse, he did. Honest word, all that crap. But all he could think of right now was the light touch around his waist, and the warmth of Steve's body on the left side of him, searing his hip and side and arm. He turned around a little bit more (a little bit closer! every inch counted); Steve made as if to let go, probably thinking Tony was trying to untangle himself from him.
"He wouldn't shut up about what he called... Kyrumption, I think? Two heroes, meeting on the field of battle, coming together..."
He sighed, felt his lips quirk to one side, unhappily. "Look, Cap, to be completely honest, I'm probably not cut out for this." For the first time in forever, he actually felt 40.
One night, Tony lay awake, thinking about this. Things were coming clear in his mind, and they made his gut go cold. Embarrassment? No, it was worse than that.
Tony had been increasingly restless on the way, and I couldn't stand to watch him fidget any longer. What I said was: "I think I'm going to call it an early night. See you in the morning?" What I meant was: "Go, fiddle with your quantum GPS. Try." The relief on his face when I said I was going to sleep stung for a moment. But this was Tony. When he gets an idea in his head, he can't help it. He can't keep away.
"He's got both distal and proximal fractures on his right forearm", said a hesitant but mildly dry voice at the door. "Not to mention a dislocated left shoulder. I don't think he'll be playing cards anytime soon." This was when Tony first noticed the young doctor that had been traveling on the cruiser together with him and Hammer. Doctor Banner, he remembered. At first he was drafted into the medical personnel of
way better than I ever got to know him. I talk with you. I spend every waking hour with you, more or less. How could I not fall in love with you?" I was speaking more and more vehemently, but then I decided to shut up. "I'm sorry, Tony," I added with some defiance, "but that's how it happened, and there's nothing I can do about it now. I..." I wanted to say we could perhaps go back to the way we were, but, I thought, we probably couldn't.
This was frustrating. And had this been a Timely night like any other, Steve might have gone home, the way he always did.
It felt like whining. It was true, though. Have a talk, clear the air. They still had things to say to each other. He wasn't sure what exactly – as for himself, he'd said his piece in a long voice message, and Tony had heard it. He'd responded. That was it, that was all. So why did it feel unfinished? Like there was something there, left between them, either unspoken or broken (Steve couldn't tell). Perhaps this was it, and it couldn't be fixed, and it couldn't be mended or bridged, and he just needed to accept it. Maybe there was no coming back from certain things after all.
Steve pumped his fingers a few times more, for good measure. But his motions were choppy, hurried. Tony saw him bite his lower lip so hard it went white. The grip of his other hand on Tony’s thigh was fierce, almost bruising. And his eyes, when his gaze met Tony’s, were night.
We discuss the nature of the multiverse, and cooking (I'm still horrible at it, but after watching years' worth of cooking shows with my Tony, I at least know the theory), and politics, and history, and gardening, and what's the best detergent. It's a constant back and forth. It's as if it gives him new life.
for surprise. Using a hand-operated lift, Darryl and two techs were pushing the viper up, up, ever so slowly. Smoke was sloshing around their shins like a ghostly gray ocean. At normal gravity, it wouldn't have worked. The craft was too big, too heavy and unwieldy.
A few months later, I'm reorganizing Tony's bookshelves, mostly out of boredom, when he brings me the shield. He's holding it like an old, dear enemy he's reluctant to let go of. And here I thought I got rid of that thing when I gave it to Sam.
Tony: See, you know what you're doing there. With the light and shading and all. You make it look like a painting, almost.
Like in a dream, slowly, he raised his right hand and touched his fingertips to the biceps of Steve's good arm where it bulged from the gray top. It was a slightest brush, a ghost of a touch, almost not there at all.
because Steve didn't want to see him now, didn't want to hear his voice, to know, couldn't stand to look into his eyes (warm and beautiful and so expressive...
is talking, all right? That’s all I meant, that’s all I want. Not some... whatever you’re thinking. Just...
He sits down on his bench, and now I can see his profile from where I'm standing. The familiarity of the outline equals pain. He has a chess set with him on the bench, and for a moment I wonder if he was playing with Morgan. But he barely looks at it. He looks at the Morgan's disappearing back for as long as he can see it, and then he just sinks down. His face crumples into something way more tired and way more sad. I haven't seen him like this – maybe ever. But this is a different Tony and I don't know his story.
, the idea of Tony... fooling around, he supposed... with other people... That made his stomach curl into a fist and there was this tightness in his chest he couldn't stand. What was he supposed to do, how did people do this? Was he just old fashioned? No, he wasn't, he was simply wired that way, that was all.
Nebula hints – in her own weird way, that is more like a hit on the head than a hint, really – that the pair to go to Vormir should have some kind of emotional attachment to each other. An emotional connection. She glances at Natasha and Clint as she says this, then away. She seems unsure about something. But Steve and Tony exchange a look. They don't even need to discuss this.
He’d have expected Steve to be a relaxed sleeper, like big people tended to be, to sprawl over the bed in all his length, arms and legs everywhere. The first (and the last) time they’d shared a bed, at Clint’s, Tony had woken up in the middle of the night, only to find Steve curled tightly around his own midsection in a corner of the bed, muttering in his sleep. Tony now opened his right eye and peeked. Steve was in the same fetal position, both palms pressed tightly together and tucked under his left cheek. The blanket was bunched around his middle. He was facing Tony, frowning in his sleep, face slightly scrunched up. Curled up as he was, there was something deeply anxious about his appearance.
Hope was already on the job, though; as she disappeared down the corridor, Steve hurried to take over her fire extinguisher.
Steve pulled out, relatively slowly, maybe a quarter of the way, then pounded back in. Tony felt himself sliding perhaps two inches across the bed; he grabbed onto Steve’s upper arms for purchase and held on with all he had. Something clenched in his stomach as he stared up into Steve’s face from so near. A keen hunger mixed with tenderness so fierce it could be expressed only by digging his nails all the way in; and Steve took hold of his shoulders in turn, holding him firmly in place. Pulled out, again not too far, then in, all the way, to fill him, to fuck him, to give him what he wanted.
"He's..." Steve made a show of glancing at the file again, even though he remembered the data quite well, "...39." Too old to learn. Oh, yes. Steve gave the commander a stubborn look.
“Yeah,” Tony whispered. The rest of what he was going to say got drowned in a gasp when Steve rotated hips his again, touching all new spots, lighting them afire.
He makes himself open his eyes, unaware that he's closed them. Tony is sucking – very softly – on the head of his cock. Steve can see the side of his face – it tugs at his heart, painfully, the way Tony's sweaty hair is falling into his eyes as he begins his slow descent.
"...different," Tony supplied with a private half-smile. "But no, I kind of do like it. Makes you look scruffy." There, he'd managed to say something halfway normal to him.
Tony felt a corner of his lips twitch into something wry and not particularly happy. Decided – yet again – to try and let it go. He won't bait him today.
Aboard a ship of the gunstar class, pilots had their R&R and the marines had their own, on their deck. In the normal circumstances, however, techs were much fewer in numbers – just the necessary maintenance personnel. War changed this. Repairs planetside became fewer and farther between, and the number of staff grew by necessity. These numbers became further inflated after their impromptu fleet jumped over the Red Line and
What Steve didn't say was this: here's Tony Stark, the playboy, the industrialist, the billionaire, the person who was on his way to meet with the ruling council of the Twelve fucking Colonies when our fleet was attacked. Now, out here, they were all nobodies, they were the hands-on skills they had, nothing more and nothing less. No reason to play Stark's status up; he probably had a too high an opinion of himself as it was.
It took Tony a few seconds to respond. When he did, his voice was hoarse. "I've never believed in 'too late', you know. I believe in leaving shit behind you and moving forward. So if you'd be interested in that, ah, maybe we could try to figure this thing out." He paused. "Together."
Desperately mortified, he crossed the small distance between them. Expecting to feel hands on his chest any moment, pushing him away, Steve threw his arms around Tony stiffly, awkwardly, as if he'd never used arms before, as if the purpose of limbs in general mystified him. And he plastered a stupid, dry, wooden kiss in the middle of Tony's forehead of all places.
Honestly, he had no idea. But what he knew was, he kept acting like an idiot where Stark was concerned. He couldn't find a balance. It was either too much congeniality on his part or chilly stiffness. Stark just made him feel out of sorts.
, his gut suggested mercilessly.) And if it was aimed at him, than it would have to be some kind of flirting. After the last rejection and the subsequent coldness, that would be weird. As if they were back at the game. Only, this time Tony somehow felt like a mark.
"The game of perseverance," she said dramatically. "The battle of wills. Who will hold out and who will fold? He's very determined to win."
He stared at his cell. He stared at the skies. He hoped Pepper was not crazy enough to try and drive in this weather.
Something like that. Try to figure things out. I want to... Do you know the principles on which the BARF is based? Never mind. Look, I want to create a shitton of memories,
Steve sighed, got up, made a few steps in her direction. She was now standing at the door as if she could disappear at any moment and he'd better hurry if he wanted to get anything out of her. He compressed his lips in pure self-irritation. Why was talking so difficult? Even with Natasha? He'd known Natasha since he was 19, so almost 14 years now. They'd been close since they first set their foot into the Academy.
Steve blushed a little, just a rosy tint to his cheeks, but he grinned insolently. "If it would embarrass him, then yeah, I'd say go for it. But I think he would just smile and nod happily, so that kind of spoils the fun."
"Let me see that," Tony said briskly, half-pushing Steve out of the way to get to the elevator control panel.
how careful Tony is with him, how gentle - mindful not to go too far - and it makes Steve's heart flutter warmly. But at the same time, he lets himself indulge in fantasies about how Tony is denying him pleasure on purpose, just because he can, just because he wants to, and
Her touch on my cheek surprised me. It felt more as if she was flicking away a breadcrumb than anything else, but for a moment it was there, and it felt solicitous if you squinted. She said, "You're tired. I understand that, you know. I'm tired too." It sounded brisk and matter-of-fact. "Tell me, Captain, what would you want? If you had a choice?"
Steve made as if to turn back, round on him, but then he just shook his head and pressed on. "Cut the chatter." He sounded exasperated.
As he rolled the window down, icy air hit his face like a hammer. It had started snowing earlier, but in the warmth of his car Tony hadn't been aware the temperature had dropped this low. No, really, what's the lumberjack-type doing outside in this weather? Well, lumberjacking, probably, but still.
Santa Cap," Morgan had specified, and so Tony was now calling Steve Rogers, to whom he had barely spoken in three years, and the said three years had come right on the tail of the two years of not speaking at all. And that... sucked, but that was simply how things were between them, and that was that. They'd both screwed up, and there was no coming back from that. On a few occasions since the Snap they'd had to work together on big rescue missions, but that had been strictly business.
a fever dream. But it didn't end there. When Tony touched his cheek, Steve's chest had lit up with hope.
He nodded quietly. And then, after a pause: "I'm going to try and get over there nevertheless, though."
"So, it's all right  for you to hop around the multiverse, but for me it isn't? Don't get me wrong, I'm glad you decided to hop over to here."
"I should be going," Steve said, as amiably as he could, raising to his feet. "We should appoint a new judge, and there's a lot of work to be done."
Just the way to crush Tony’s heart into tiny, squishy bits. He stared at Steve because he couldn’t possibly look away. Steve stared back. This was that one moment; afterwards, people always said they didn’t know who closed the distance, who initiated the kiss, they said that their lips just melted together on their own accord. This never happened in real life, in Tony’s experience. At least not when you were sober. Someone had to take the initiative. And all two of them did was gaze into each other’s eyes, fixed to the spot, stock-still, and the moment prolonged, and became uncomfortable, and Tony was beginning to feel stupid; and the worm of indestructible skepticism in his heart wondered if he’d misinterpreted absolutely everything. But no, the tenderness in Steve’s eyes, the faint blush along his cheekbones, the...
If things were falling against Tony's ceiling, it meant that something big and heavy was also falling against the
He was going to throw it out there, offhandedly, nodding towards the char marks on Steve's suit. He choked on the words. They just wouldn't come out.
Tony: Well, technically speaking, there’s nothing stopping us from still texting then, if that’s what works, right?
Captain let the towel fall to the floor with a tiny splash, then looked at Tony and sighed. "At ease," he said.
"The real trouble," Steve admitted hesitantly, as if he was spilling a dark secret, "isn't that. Well, it is, which is why I'm so upset. But what made it so bad was the fact that
And yet, despite himself, he had to admit the strained relationship with Tony stung. They were still extremely uneasy around each other. Steve told himself he was over this. He'd been trying long and hard. He told himself it was just the fact that he didn't like any kind of discord within his ranks, and as a captain, it should be his job to keep things even and working. If he were to ever work well with Tony – and, given their numbers, he'll have to – he should try to build some kind of team spirit and a working relationship. They didn't need to be friends, exactly; they probably couldn't be. They were so vastly different. But, he thought, he should try
all in good fun. What I said. Also, I don't feel so great about it," Tony interrupted. "I was being an asshole for no particular reason. I do that sometimes." He looked at Cap again, up and to the side, still not moving his head. "So, what's the usual procedure for that?"
I shook my head. This Steve looked like some giant to me, some hero, not... myself. And at the same time, I remembered writing all those earlier entries. It had been me.
Tony: Only, somehow you'd be able to make it look like a healing, wholesome family experience or something. And you would have sympathy of thousands.
, Steve realized. Tony was just too blustery to admit that. Maybe he'd be able to focus better if Steve kept him up to date.
"Well, as I said, my motel is nearby," Steve began. Then  he flushed bright red, as red as Tony's sweater. "I didn't mean... All I meant..."
"How can I thank you for the ride?" Steve asked, seemingly reluctant to touch the door, as if the door-handle would burn him, as if that act would disperse the last of the magic. Or... no. That was all in Tony's head
a small part of him added, the one that remembered more of that evening than Tony cared to admit. But how much did he care, in what manner? If he knew anything in life, Tony knew one thing: he would never ever ask.
but it was too late and his consciousness somehow melded back into Steve's); and Bucky said something about liking, and Steve said: "I do like him, he's just so, so Tony sometimes. He's loud and reckless, he burns bright and fast, like a falling star..."
. The groups had shared battle wounds and hospitals and scars and the aftermath. "Steve and Natasha and the guys have mostly been doing undercover work for Fury. I've been... busy on the other side of things. That's all." Yet, they were still
stopped in his throat because it would have been a big lie. He knew perfectly well. He'd known for a long time now.
He arched an eyebrow at me and, without waiting for my answer, dug something out of the back of a drawer. The box was small when he stuffed it into my palm. It took me a moment to fumble it open.
Tony: Also, thank Natasha for me, some of the info she sent was moderately useful. She thinks the serum got reverse engineered from the blood samples and the bone marrow of the dead super-soldiers in that base in Siberia, do you think that's possible?
Tony had no idea. Thor's arrival saved him from having to think of something remotely non-brainless to say.
. That was what made the game interesting. It was just like these night time conversation, the game. If two weren't playing it together, if they weren't doing the dance, then it wasn't fun any more. He wanted a response, a feedback, not to badger at someone who felt mildly nauseated by his efforts.
"Basically yes. Exactly. I need your capacity for eating everything in the vicinity. So, that's a yes?"
Natasha made a non-committal face. "Child-like is the world you might be looking for. Insofar as children are silly and often cruel and have no grasp of the consequences."
, the readings were more or less stable. The heating appeared wonky, in this part of the deck at least, and the lights were flickering, but for now, if the in-built detectors in the suits were anything to go by, the air was still breathable. Steve promptly tore his helmet off. Tony started to do the same, but Steve just shook his head at him. Tony opened his mouth to protest, but: "Just do what you're told for once," Cap ordered before he could say anything. Tony could practically see he was already regretting he'd let Tony come along.
, Cap," Tony said, but, to make everything worse (or better), he didn't even sound annoyed. He took another gulp of soup. "Just super bored." He gestured at his tablet morosely. "I've no concentration for anything serious. But I think I'm feeling a little better, actually." Belying his words, Tony scrunched up his nose and sneezed. Steve arched an eyebrow. "Dust?" Tony said with a tiny smirk. His eyes were too shiny, though, and a little watery, and when he shivered and wrapped himself tighter in his bathrobe although the air was dry and warm, Steve needed no other confirmation.
"Two weeks," I said dully. There were the eleven days between the battle and the funeral – the funeral actually being laying of the ashes – and you could give or take a day or two spent in the quantum realm, taking the stones back to their proper locations, etc.
"Stand still," Tony tells him, and then he is behind him, prying his asscheeks open with the handle, dragging the pommel through his asscrack, down, all the way to the perineum, with a bit more pressure than before, then back up. It stops at his entrance, circling, pressing, lightly. And then Tony twists it sharply, and Steve draws in a convulsive breath.
Tony: Hell, I don't know, Steve. We are the folks that used to hang out with a Norse god, who once went to seek enlightenment in a mystic pond. I mean, why not this? Whyever the hell not? Eh?
They exchanged a few words only, all in all. In retrospect, Steve could barely remember what they'd talked about, apart from asking after each other's health. It felt like more than that, though. It almost felt like something you thought about right before you fell asleep, something you allowed yourself to bask in; and then, tomorrow you ordered yourself to
"So... We've been talking. A bit. Texting. I don't know, sometimes I think..." Tony trailed off, unsure of what he thought.
, his thoughts added, cruelly, and he felt his chest ice over. "I gotta go check the engine, because apparently no one else is doing it."
There was a trickle of chilliness in Tony's voice (someone who didn't know him, might not have noticed). He sounded deceptively offhanded. "You having regrets, big guy?"
He reflected over this as he awkwardly wriggled out of his jacket. It was an old garment and the zipper didn't open all the way, so he had to pull it off over his head. The inside of the car was piping hot. Steve still had chills but they would pass in a minute. Most of it was in his head anyway. Besides, Steve was wearing a warm sweater underneath.
"Well," Steve said matter-of-factly, "I don't think it's going to stay that way for much longer." Whatever had happened between them in the past, Tony thought he could hug him at that moment, just for the sheer, stupid sass.
"I know that, of course," she said, and then she said, "What if we up the volume slowly?" So that everyone and everything can gently float back to what used to be the floor.'
His legs bent at the knee, Tony lay back. He closed his eyes, drowning, sinking into the feeling of Steve’s lubed up fingers ghosting their way from the sensitive spot at the root of the spine, through Tony’s cleft. They lingered at his anus, circling it once, twice. Then just  the tiniest of pressures; on the verge of sinking in, but no, they were on their way. They reached the spot just behind his balls, and decided to stop there, massaging, harder now. Tony felt the burning echo of the touch
The moment is there and gone. And then there is no reason to look into Tony's eyes any longer. There's nothing there now.
"Not... exactly," Steve said, and Tony tried not to let his heart sink, because it had been a stupid notion, of course it hadn't been like that, not with everything that had happened between them. But: "I got some anonymous info," Steve went on, seriously, earnestly. "I analyzed it, picked it apart. Found some contacts. Found more info." He snorted. "I knew it could be a trap, but I thought I was being so smart."
It slowly stops being fun, tormenting Steve. In the cab from the airport, they both sit in the back, but as far from each other as humanly possibly. This is by mutual tacit agreement. For the first time in hours, Tony's hands aren't on Steve for one annoying reason or another, and it's suddenly weird.
He'd forgotten about their surroundings. In his mind, the two of them were an island in the sea of white noise, but now he again became aware of where they were. The sea melted back into a multitude of people, milling about, doubtlessly doing very useful things, even though, for all the world, they looked as if they were aimlessly ambling from spot A to spot Be for no apparent reason.
"And you're here," he finished for me, gently. That seemed to give him another idea, though, and in that he was also exactly like my Tony – one moment he could be pensive, and all of a sudden, an idea later, he was all action, all at once. He lit up with a sudden onslaught of inner energy.  "How
Steve blinked into the darkness. No, he wasn't, of course he wasn't. He wasn't going to waste his last hours with Tony like that. Yet, he expected the other man to start snoring lightly, the way he usually did when he drank. Steve hadn't thought he'd get talking so soon, but then again, that was his own mistake. This was Tony Stark. Of course he was going to talk.
Then Steve rolled to the side, propped himself up on an elbow. Tony felt his gaze like a caress, up and down his body. He couldn’t help but stretch languorously, then moved closer. He could feel a tired, satisfied smile invade his face.
Steve had answered the phone almost as if he'd expected someone else to call him from Tony's number. And no wonder.
, but retreat to somewhere else in a grandiose manner, at any rate. Very sedately. He cleared his throat. "Now that you know my dirty little secret, can you keep it to yourself or are you going to rattle it off to the tabloids?"
And then a powerful smash and an explosion of wreckage, and if no one came running at this, they were either dead, drunk or having wild sex on one of the upper floors.
Time was slipping away, and Steve knew he had to do something, but he was frozen in place. So many years had been leading up to this point. For so many years he'd been trying to turn himself to stone, and now he was supposed to turn himself back, all at once, to feel what he had been trying not to feel, to hope when he had been doing his best to extinguish all hope.
"No, no. Let's say that was exactly what you meant. It makes me feel better, so let's just leave it at that."
level below ground it turned out leaving the lab techs alive, or at least conscious, had been a mistake. Not that they could have done anything else, really, since cold blooded murder wasn't exactly their style. Tony and Steve had taken and disabled their phones and any other visible ways of communication with the outside world, just like they had done with the goons in the cell, but they must have missed a silent alarm or something like that. Because this many heavies suddenly advancing into the building couldn't have been a coincidence.
was important. His chest swelled, his heart skipped and danced, and it beat loudly in his ears. Because, disregarding everything else, all he could think was that Steve had had no light perception earlier, and now he evidently did, which could mean only one thing: he was getting better. Whatever had been wrong, his body was somehow repairing it. "Erskine, you fucking, lovely genius!" he blurted.
Tony's stopped moving his finger in and out for the moment; he just lets it sit there, against Steve's prostate, titillating in its promise. And then, a tiny wriggling, very subtle, barely perceptible, so Steve closes his eyes, to focus on it, to catch the uncatchable sensation, to...
"Oh you're the one to talk," Cap shot right back, and it shouldn't have felt so good, but it was so close to Tony's ear that it made him shudder. He let himself indulge the impulse just for a second. Cap was so near – hunched over the panel, and Tony – still apparently looking for the  recording from yesterday. "Tera from the mess hall said you keep bothering her, begging for coffee." There was a hint of laughter in his voice.
I grabbed the ring with my shield on it. I also grabbed his left hand in mine. "Tony," I said, trying to burn my way into his head with my eyes, "do you take me as your husband?"
It had started at the new cadets' orientation meeting. No, actually, it had started back in the tech dormitory, when Cap overheard his catty exchange with Hammer.
"You don't have to tell me," he said calmly, soberly. "About the academy. But if you ever wanted to, I'm interested to hear the story."
It seemed he wasn't alone, because Romanoff turned. She seemed super serious. "Guys. Leave the nuggets alone." She said it too coolly to sound exactly exasperated. A miracle of miracles, the others did fall silent. "Doc, take whichever bed no one is sitting on at the moment. Anyone got a problem with that, they can come talk to me." All of a sudden, everyone seemed to be busy with something. So. Natasha's the scary one around here. Interesting.
He sipped the familiar hot beverage. It was vile, and it burned his tongue, and it helped him focus.
Steve straightened up. “You’re the one who should be wrapped in blankets!” he stated, and – to Tony’s feeble, unvoiced protest – started to take them off, only to reflexively pull them back around himself as a new shudder shook him. It was too much for Tony. In an instant he was next to Steve, wrapping both arms around him – around his solid back, and around his knees, hugged so tightly to his chest; and he let his forehead sink against Steve’s shoulder. He had no strength left in his limbs, but he held on.
"How come we're not talking about the fact you promptly sent Thor and me away so that you could risk your pretty neck all by yourself, oh, crap, this is inappropriate, isn't it, I went too far with this, didn't I?" he finished, failing to smile.
, he thought, but he had an impression that wasn't something Tony wanted to hear right then. All that saying those words would accomplish would be to unburden Steve himself, and thus it would be an innately selfish act. Besides, Steve had tried apologizing about it, before; never worked.
, it was two fingers now. Pressed carefully together, to make them as small and narrow as possible. Tony swallowed, willed his muscles to relax, and they were
Still, the spell seemed broken for the moment. With a worried expression, Steve pressed so slightly it was almost imperceptible, slid in barely half an inch, then stopped again, casting an anxious glance at Tony’s face. Then again.
his approach. "So that you don't get in trouble." His own breathing sped up. Forcibly, he held it under control.
"So good of you to RSVP," she says dryly, but her eyes crinkle and sparkle in welcome. Or so Tony imagines..
following the rules, because if he was seen waving them off, everyone was going to wave them off; and the situation they were in, it was in a precarious balance, and sometimes following the rules was what actually kept you human when it would be so easy to break down and become something less than that.
It was weird, Tony reflected; he regarded this glade almost as his own brainchild. He had discovered it, true, when he was twelve; like hundreds before him, probably. But, as he wound between the branches heavy with snow, he couldn’t help but marvel at how there was no one around, ever, to revel in this quiet, brilliant beauty. Here, the water was present in three different states of matter at the same time – ice beneath his feet, the heavy, wet smell of snow and pine in the air around him, and the slow drip-drip-drip that shouldn’t be audible in the mountains, not this time of year, but on a southwardly exposed slope, at noon – it was. Three states of matter, three worlds meeting where they shouldn’t, like something out of a Norse myth. Each individual drop seemed to reflect a different ray of sunlight in a haphazard direction on its way down. If those had been lasers, not even Natasha could have snaked her way through them.
? With me too? Or maybe just me? See where it goes? Instead, his throat suddenly went dry, and what came out was: "I saw you with Peter..." He heard how that sounded, stopped.
invited him; well, she'd sent a Facebook invite, and Tony wasn't sure if he was supposed to be insulted or touched.
"It feels like you've just been shown what kind of physical preparedness you might need to actually do this," Sam responded in dry tones.
Steve wasn’t to be distracted from the course, though. “I‘m not saying let’s dwell on the past,” he said. There was some desperate courage there, as if he wanted, needed to get  things out, no matter the consequences. “I don’t want to tell you again all the things I’ve already told you. I just...” It was his turn to sigh audibly, probably at the way Tony wriggled in his arms, suddenly uncomfortable. “
"What, same thing, different name?" That was Daisy Johnson, who was also there. A very quick student, but prone to playing it down. "That's confusing." Tony was pretty sure it wasn't confusing to her at all. "Can't we just ditch both and call the thing something simple like... Dave?" Daisy grinned up at Rogers, who allowed himself to snort.
Tony's head snaps back to look at Steve, and then the arm around his waist steadies him, and a hand sneaks up, firmly but gently, to cradle the back of his head. Steve's lips on his own are warm and firm, familiar, and if this had happened a few years back, it would have felt pretty awesome, actually. Even now, despite everything, it's a little nice. Tony hadn't kissed anyone since the thing with Pepper blew into his face the final time. He stares at Steve, wide-eyed. Steve's own eyes are closed for a second, but then he seemingly remembers what they are supposed to be doing and why; they snap open and start darting around, although he's still not taking his lips away from Tony's. He's even lightly massaging his scalp, which is, Tony thinks, really not required at this time.
We did all this in a mostly platonic manner. We did touch more than friends usually do, and infinitely more than I ever did with the Tony from my timeline. If one of us grew sad, hands on shoulders became a staple. While we watched movies, we'd sit quite close together. Still, all of that came gradually, and it took time. It began with our elbows touching on one of our movie nights, and then, suddenly, it was the knees too. It was magnificent. Flustered, I tried to apologize and scoot away. Tony just rolled his eyes at me and said, "Whatever you want. But don't try to tell me it doesn't feel nice."
old, in truth. I felt ancient before I came here. Ancient and useless, and without a place in the world. Here – well, we are in our seventies, and we feel it. Yesterday Tony finished  the new model of the suit with better joint support; you have to start thinking of things like that at some point. But we still got some fight left in us.
"Listen, though," he said. "Are you in a hurry? I mean – what are you doing here? Are you on a mission or...? Did you need me to do something for you?"
I know nothing about chess. Nothing. So, basically, I'm stealing a famous game from here: http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1011478
, something wild and urgent and burning. Now he wanted to memorize the way Tony felt under his palms, to memorize the feeling of his lips under his own, to commit every little detail to memory. If this was all he was going to have, then yes, thanks, he was going to make it last as long as he could. His heart hurt, perhaps, but then again, his heart
The shape that emerged from the cloud of dust was painfully familiar – his powerful frame, his broad shoulders – but something there was out of place. Tony felt it more than he really detected it with his eyes. He hadn't seen Steve since Siberia, and he had wondered what the meeting would look like; because it would happen eventually – it had to. The world would force it on them. Tony hadn't envisioned it like this. He hadn’t thought he'd be struck speechless, desperately wishing for his suit, either of the metal or the cloth variant, anything; hell, even sunglasses would do. A layer of something to put between himself and his surroundings, a buffer, a screen. It wasn't necessarily bad, what he felt. It was too complicated to be either good or bad. It just felt too raw, like hot sand on irritated skin. He felt his breath hitch in his chest. He pulled the blanket tighter around him.
"Thank you very much," the guy said again, and he sounded so nice and polite that, by Murphy's law, he surely
"Cap, mind the piss!" Tony called after him over the frog in his throat, but Steve was already jumping over a puddle, and his back disappeared into a side corridor.
Tony: Also, now you get to legit be unnecessarily jealous over Christine fucking Everhart, and I get to be jealous about you going on dates and things, right?
He wasn't cut out for this. Not to lift the wreckage off of people who might be living or dead under it. Schrödinger's techs. Well, fuck that.
And seeing all of them, together like that, was as if the other half of his life slid into place, a missing piece he wouldn't let himself miss properly until it was already there, because it would have hurt too much otherwise.
He opened his mouth to say something, although he had no idea what it would be. Tony, however, decided to break the silence first, probably because it was suddenly over-saturated with something like mutual understanding. It was a little uncomfortable.
Maybe there was enough emphasis in his tone. Maybe Steve could read his face better than Tony supposed. The man snorted. “Yeah, I could,” he said. And: “Let’s go, then. We’ve wasted the best part of the day.”
"Because... If you'd wanted to, I think you probably could have, in all these months. Or at least you'd have found me. And, anyway, I just don't think you'd do it."
She put the weight on the stand and jumped up.  "That's the dormitory effect for you," she stated. And: "Well, that's it for today, as far as I'm concerned."
this? He didn't. It was so clear all of a sudden, and there was something like a guillotine cutting straight through Tony's midriff.
And Tony very much didn't want it to go away. Oh, god. He had fallen for former Captain America in under an hour, and he had fallen badly.
Steve went very still for a moment. Tony could feel his muscles tense up and wondered what was wrong.
Tony was, he told himself, just trying to make sure he was not imagining the whole thing, so he decided to continue with the experiments.
"You think I don't know that? So what?" Steve is showing a bit of a temper, now, and compared to his expressionless eyes, the way they were at the start of this convo – this is a balm for Tony's heart. Well, almost. "I mean, if you, in your own heart, considered me a friend, and I considered you a friend, then..."
The locals knew Steve, sure, but most anyone else would have driven off rather than let an unknown, burly guy into their car at night. Which was, well, wise, generally speaking.
Tony: Looking back at it now? For the most part, a mess of unfortunate circumstances slapped together, and no one really talking to anyone else.
And for all of Tony's posturing, the moment the tent flap closed behind them, he was upon Steve. He tore off his own helmet and tossed it aside, and then his lips were on Steve's, softly insistent, almost pleading. "Good god, Steve, I missed you so much," he whispered, kissing Steve's mouth, his face, his eyes. "I missed you so much, you stupid idiot."
Out of breath, he found the landing bay in a far better state than he expected. The smoke was fully cleared by now. Tony didn't know what it had been like, really, but he’d, pictured an impenetrable cloud, a wall, a sea of smoke. Medics were already there, he saw, and the marines. Everything seemed well organized.
Tony was also lying on his stomach now. He shifted marginally closer. Steve didn't move. Their shoulders were almost touching.
"We'll figure it out," Steve says softly. "I promise." And then he reaches out, and touches Tony's chest right next to the arc reactor. That's the spot that often goes numb, that still hurts when the weather is about to change. It's not numb now. And Steve splays his fingers and rests his palm against it, gently. "I know it's tired," he says. "But it's really not sucky."
Tony gave him a long, speculative look. "You know, I tended to agree with you, but now I don't really."
Tony turned to him, then – pleasant, always pleasant, pointedly including Sharon in the conversation – one hand on Sharon's shoulder, one on Steve's...
"Hello?" Steve's voice sounded weird and convoluted, but it might have been the cell signal. It was never the way it should be near the lake house, and with everything he had to do, Tony never really got around to doing something about it.
"There's something you haven't told me," he echoed, as if that was exactly what he was going to say anyway.
, did it? What if Rogers just – saw everything? Saw Tony put an effort into this, saw what he was doing – and didn't want it? What if it just made him awkward and uneasy, not in a good, hot, titillating way but in the
Tony: Yeah. I mean, it's okay now. I sicced my legal team on them. They can suck my big legal dick. She was obviously let go.
Steve wore an insecure half-smile and no beanie (the idiot). Snowflakes played in his hair. If he stood there much longer, he would probably turn into Olaf. He held his skis in his left hand like a foreign body of  undisclosed loyalties.
"Because," she says patiently, "you just got out of a painful divorce, and you are bound to be in an emotionally wobbly place, and, it's not
"Yeah, I'm not either," she says. He can see she's hiding hurt, though. Natasha is easier to read these days. Maybe she's losing touch in the aftermath of the Snap, or maybe it's that she's quite drunk. They both are.
"This must be a grav field malfunction, right?" Steve asked. Of course Steve had figured it out; he was smart. Tony had listened to his lectures. He was an intelligent guy, and he knew his science too.
Apparently, this was some kind of a coat room, probably for the guests, since it was on the ballroom floor. Silent racks of overcoats and raincoats and jackets, almost identical in the gloom, like rows upon rows of mute auditors.
"I died, didn't I?" he asked then. "In your time." He must have read the truth in my eyes, because he nodded to himself. "How?"
Steve lingered there. He seemed to be weighing something in his head for a minute, then evidently came to a decision.
And that was, what, four years ago? And before that? I went to Monaco for a weekend and got attacked by a Russian psycho who had a bone to pick with my dad, so go figure. And then I decide to come here, after more than two decades, and I catch a cold? Really? Sue me for self-pity, but I just want one day,
I did indeed know it, and I said so, so we got up and went that way, because, "I can't process this without food," Tony said. It was so like him, again, that I could barely cope with the happiness that hummed inside me. It immediately made me feel guilty.
that, intensely, but it drew his gaze. And then, sometimes, when Tony was at the lectern, explaining, or while listening to Steve's tactics lessons and scribbling in his notebook (actual, paper notebook, which he kept complaining about) – a different Tony emerged. That one wasn't all ready charm and flashy grins. There was a glint in his eye, a thoughtful smile, an endless fascination with his subject; seemingly unending patience when he needed to explain something for the fifth time. He never seemed to grow bored. He never put the other cadets down directly. But then he'd go and spoil it all by saying things like 'dumbing the matter down for the kids' to Steve. Steve couldn't decide if it was genuine, deeply rooted arrogance or just Stark's mouth running faster than his brain.
saying. He supposed they had a lot of talking to do if they wanted to try and patch up their friendship. Or whatever the hell this was.
he thought, pissed at himself. A small private cell tower would have solved it, but it was too late now, anyhow.
Steve's arms rose as if he was going to grab Tony and pull him close. Then they fell back down. "Yes, Tony," Steve said softly. "I find you very attractive."
"Do you really have to stay?" Tony shot back, on the offense now, without allowing Steve a moment to take a breath. His eyes were ablaze, as if he were saying
Steve felt like he was balancing at the edge of a knife. What he wanted was to get closer to him, get to know him. What he felt he needed to do here was keep his distance. He imagined he managed to fall somewhere in between, a middle of the road, but after what happened today, he thought he was more like a pendulum, swinging wildly between the two points. He wanted to just bury his face in his hands and stay like that, but there lay another road to darkness, so he didn't.
He was sure Steve was going to protest, say something reproachful, but the man just laughed incredulously, breathily. "How are you so...?" he began, sounding almost giggly, and didn't finish; instead, he started searching the coat pockets from the opposite end.
On the next day, during his class, he started setting traps for Cap. It was fun. Tony kept going through his teaching plan normally. He would look at every recruit in turn as he explained the reactions that, basically, made the ammo go boom even in near-perfect vacuum. And during all of this, he
Stark looked so pitiful that Steve felt a nagging obligation to make sure he was all right. He also banished all thought that the man might be after him. He was Iron Man, sure, but had he decided to come after Steve, he sure wouldn't do it out here, alone, looking like this. And as they exchanged a few bantering sentences, Steve thought: he's nothing like on TV. Sure, he sounds like it, more or less, but if he's willing to pick up an unknown guy out here at night, he must have a bit of a heart underneath.
Natasha arched an eyebrow. "Steve, whatever he's like, he's a fellow pilot, or near enough. I'm not your spy."
I think it was a barest whisper, but he must have heard me. I saw his eyes snap open. He tore the sunglasses off, staring at me for a barest second, and then he was jumping to his feet. Getting into my face.
"Yeah," Steve said, desperately wanting for Tony to say something, but Tony was uncharacteristically silent.
on a gala in a royal palace in Norway, to the amusement and disbelief of the surrounding people; she had always been cool, really.
Tony couldn't smile. It was as if he'd been hit with a spell, his muscles wouldn't obey; and all he could do was stand there with an expression that, at best, looked impassive, and at worst like fear. He felt a stone in his mouth, pressing his tongue down.
Then a sudden thought occurred to him. Was that what Steve wanted? Did he want Tony to make that decision for him? Relieve him of the responsibility? Was it why he was here?
. Then he pointed out of the huge ballroom they were in, in the direction of one of the smaller drawing rooms... And Steve didn't really hear the rest of the directions, because he was politely interrupted by T'Challa, hand in hand with Storm, and then they all had to chat for a while. Rhodey still kept sneaking glances at Carol. Steve wondered what that was all about.
The ideas they came up with weren't overly brilliant. Steve suggested Tony should try and get his arm out through the kitty door and disarm the explosives. That was sound and utterly undoable. It had been the first thing Tony had tried. Other ideas included opening the valves, letting the water flood the cell and waiting for someone to open the door because of the flooding. Another option was ripping the toilet bowl and the flush tank out and hurling them at the door, then ducking, hoping it would get the explosives to go off.
They wolfed down the food she generously refused to take any money for (Tony stashed a huge tip under the menu, though). Tony's hand wasn't close to his any more. He carefully hid it on his lap. Steve understood. He stepped back and didn't push, but he didn't have the energy for small talk either. They were largely silent, back in their own, individual glass cages. Just strangers that had met on the road. Steve's chest felt empty, but hey, that was the usual state of affairs anyway.
Tony decided to ignore this. "How are you feeling?" he repeated for the third time, more gently. "Steve. Please."
Tony: And I'm glad you enjoyed your apple jacks. It's... good that in your head they connect to good memories. Even if it hurts a bit. Because I've been there before, and the worst thing you can do is close off all the emotions completely, even the good ones, because everything is painful. It takes a longest time to come back from that place. So.
"You okay?" This from Tony; that concern again, that made Steve's heart clench just a little bit. It was normal concern, concern for a fellow soldier, it didn't need to mean anything else. And even if it did, that would be even worse, wouldn't it?"
STARK: What didn't happen was... [glances at his notes] The real Avengers are law abiding American citizens that... [studies his notes, frowning] We cannot take responsibility for the action of anyone that has renounced this country and... its values... [mutters to himself for a moment] Okay...
"My king?" Tony's voice was muffled under the helmet, but it was unmistakable. Slowly, he turned around, and while the courtesy required him to at least lift the visor, he didn't. Of course he didn't. Only, Steve wondered if it was just the usual Tony-like rudeness or if he still hoped to escape recognition. Did he really believe that would work? Even now, up close?
He drives to the Compound. It will be awkward, he knows, but he doesn't care right now. He's wrapped in the fact that he can go see Steve and Steve will want to see him right back. The rest of the word seems vague and irrelevant.
"I stole it for you," Tony says with some pride. "From the amusement park. Don't worry," he adds quickly, before Steve can say something or just give him a reproachful look, "I left a compensation."
Still, the warmth of Steve's back was seeping into him, and Steve's words about missing him, about being happy to see him – somehow, it all made the feeling die down. Something had become evident to him by that time: this wasn't just loneliness speaking, not just the fact that he wasn't alone in the dark any longer. No, they were finally talking to each other, and because of that everything suddenly seemed a tad less bleak, a tad more life-like. Hope.
Jacobson almost laughed. It looked weird on him." Everyone causes trouble," he said. He suddenly looked infinitely exasperated – with life, with the military, with himself, with the war and Cylons and the Red Line and all of creation. It was the most reaction Steve has ever gotten out of him. "But unlike some of the others, he was useful enough." He said it as if 'useful' was the best compliment a man could give another man.
talking at the exact same time. The din helped drown the buzz in your head. Tony suspected this was why everyone came here to unwind. The buzz in your head could get rather loud if you allowed yourself to think about the immensity of space, about the flimsy engines and the thin walls that kept the outside at bay; to think about how you had no idea where you were and how you probably won't see the real civilization ever again. Alcohol helped burn the deathly fear out of your stomach too.
Tony did. Steve could understand that, could understand that what was enough for Steve – a quiet (or not-so-quiet) life in Timely – wouldn't be enough for someone like Tony, whose imagination and experience could reach the heights Steve couldn't even dream of. Tony had been forcibly held down for long enough. He should be allowed to fly free.
As he looked around the room, his eyes were piercing, vigorous. Still, whenever they lighted on Tony's face, all of a sudden they seemed set in stone. Tony could feel almost visceral dislike there, thinly covered up.
He knew it as it happened. He knew it while the words were escaping his mouth, stupid words, he’d always hated words.
the voice of the gala announcer drifted languidly through the half open door of the waiting room where his group was assembling.
"And I," Fury said in a deceptively light voice, "hope you can handle him if he does. Good luck, Rogers."
And all the intimacies, even the hand-holding – it could be explained away, easily. Kindness. Warmth. A desire to help someone, to soothe, to offer comfort. It didn't have anything to do with... with attraction, and Tony was being an idiot.
"Why should I care," Tony says. Still, his voice has gone so hoarse that he's not very convincing at all.
people, all of them. Probably better than me. As people, I mean. I'm just more handsome and charming, so you like me better.
Tony: I was having my regular drinking and crying session. You interrupted. It was a really bad timing.
Tony let his hand wonder up Steve's back. It felt wonderful and the experience was spoiled only by the invasive presence of fabric. "I was
Steve couldn't feel the blast of heat through the suit, but he knew it must have been there. The surge of air threw him off his feet and all he could do was cling onto the fire extinguisher and try to land as well as he could. It wasn't a big explosion, really, but it did knock the air out of him.
, he told himself. This didn't amount to enough. The evidence was inconclusive, the symptoms, as Bruce would probably put it, still subclinical. He couldn't be sure.
biased, either. It was his friend, asking the hard questions, like she tended to. Steve leaned over and kissed her on the cheek. "That's something to think about. Thanks, Natasha." She seemed a little surprised, but just shrugged.
"Have you been to see Carol and the others today?" he asked just to say something. The injured pilots were still in the med bay. If anything significant changed on that front, he'd be updated.
Tony slams his finger in again, this time far off the mark, at an angle that's almost painful. He turns his eye-slits toward Steve then. "I said
Tony: And one who experimented on himself. Although that's a time-honored mad scientist practice, so.
Vipers were small, single-pilot spacecrafts, a primary means of defense and attack on the larger battleship, and right now most of them were in good repair and standing idle.
stare. The warmth was spreading through his chest, so intense it made him shiver, which made absolutely no sense, he figured; if it was warm, you shouldn't shiver like this. At the same time, it felt like a hug. Just from
that edge, and with each stroke he was infinitesimally closer, like decimals stretching into infinity and never quite reaching their goal.
"I assume you haven't got a packet of lube on you either?" Tony said. "Well, statistically speaking, someone has too have one."
Of course. Steve's new life was here. He'd picked this shitty town, and its inhabitants, and now he was worried someone would see him holding hands with Tony... Or – and Tony was horrified this had never crossed his mind – maybe Steve had someone, here. Someone who mattered to him a lot. What was happening with Tony was... probably not what Tony thought, coming to think of it. He must have read Steve wrong. What are the
sorry, dear," the receptionist says regretfully. "We do have one, and no one ever wants it – it's a bit pricey, you see – but it
Tony ignored him. "Before I do anything else," he said, "I need to get my hands on that serum suppressant. Well, the drug too, obviously, but the suppressant first of all. I need it. Once we get out of here..."
Some time passed. It was weird how cold it sometimes got down here. He tried doing a few stretches; it didn't help much. They were a few floors underground, or at least he thought so. Shouldn't the temperature be pretty stable, due to thermal inertia? Yes, yes it should. "Fuck you, thermal inertia," he muttered again. Still, the building was old, and there were all kinds of weird drafts at weirder times here, and he could sometimes hear the wind howling from somewhere above, through the antediluvian air-vents, high under the ceiling. (The vents were too narrow to escape through; he'd checked.) He knew cold southeastern wind was pretty prominent this time of year in this part of the world. So hence the cold, maybe. Or perhaps it was all in his head. It was dark, and he would get tired of darkness, and after a time the chill would creep into his bones, and no matter how much he huddled under the blankets, he couldn't get any warmer. And then, a few hours later, it would pass. Maybe it was just really, really cold overall, and from time to time his heart simply got tired of pumping so much blood. (It was tired of so many things, really.)
"For some version of me, at any rate," he shoots back. He's only half serious; I know him well enough to know that.
"What can you tell me about Tony Stark?" Steve asked without much preamble, after they sat down on two crates facing each other. He knew Darryl Jacobson only superficially, but, he mused, everyone knew Jacobson only superficially.
As far as Tony could tell, Steve did his best to stay on the sidelines, to help where help was still needed and possibly to slip away. But there were too many people who wanted to thank him and shake his hand or whatever. Only Natasha seemed to be giving him a hard time, only to keep casting worried looks at his back when he wasn't looking.
Tony: With Bruce gone, and all of you gone, I'm pretty much the resident expert on this. And, technically speaking, I'm now the head of the nonexistent superhero force in the U. S. And thus, Ross now kind of falls under my jurisdiction, by right, or as good as.
"I think I'm going to doze off now," Tony proclaimed, then turned to lie on his side, his back to Steve.
And so the conversation strayed and meandered on, away from Natasha's question. The crisis was averted. Tony wasn't in the mood for heart-to-hearts with anyone, honestly. Well, maybe Rhodey (definitely Rhodey), but Rhodey was still stationed on the other ship, and Tony still had no means of contacting him outside of an emergency. He highly doubted his moping would be considered an emergency any more than what they were wearing under the fatigues could be called panties.
And yet, he was making an effort, Tony had to admit that. Cap was trying to be nicer to him; Tony should probably try back, he thought guiltily.
"I just asked for a little advance on today's portion," Tony said, and smiled for a moment. And: "She complained? Really? And here I thought I was being perfectly charming." Gods, he should stop chattering, he should just shut up and try to survive this intact.
, judging by his own inner barometer as well as by Cap’s eyes, that looked way too vulnerable for a moment there, then went all glass-apples on him again. Steve looked away, as if trying to get a grip. Then he got up, walked over to a bookshelf. Tony let him. Silence stretched.
When the time came for the preliminary exam in basic flight, Tony wasn't particularly worried, and despite the Cap trying to play a hardass, Tony passed. Of course he did. He even got a curtest, tersest "Well done, cadet." He couldn't resist but bow his head graciously and drawl: "Why, thank you, Captain." He regretted it immediately. He didn't have to sweat it much, though; they both pretended he hadn't said anything.
The battle had been slaughter. Their small flotilla – two civilian ships and their military escort – had jumped away a relatively short distance through space, in order to regroup and perhaps join with a bigger Colonial force, only to be ambushed again and again. The gunstars were picked off one by one. In the end, the remaining army ships and both civilian crafts had jumped off – a long way off, to a completely different sector of space. Tony wasn't exactly sure what happened there. He was just a bright aviatic engineer with a lot of money and a few saucy stories to his name; he wasn't on the need to know list. The rumor, however, had it that the Cylons had infiltrated the command navigation program, that they had infiltrated the whole Net. Rumors, he had come to realize, were as thick as the subliminal fear on a battleship of any sort. But if the story was true, then the Colonies were, mildly put, fucked in a very ugly way.
Even later, Fury rose and said he had some work to do, and as soon as he was two yards away, Tony turned to Steve and in what seemed like a completely sober voice, said: "Walk me home?" Which he'd never ever asked so openly before.  "I don't think I can stand up straight."
Tony: because hell, Steve, with all the dick jokes and all, it was really beginning to feel like you were actually flirting, or flirting back, or whatever.
Desperately, Tony looked around. Yep. A number of people was in various stages of undress, or sat there wrapped in blankets, while even more of them waited to be further harassed by the medical staff.
. There was this reasonable voice in his head, and it sounded a little bit like Jarvis – the real Jarvis. And he was probably right. It was just a moment, it meant nothing in the long run. They had talked. They had texted (
"You could make this a study in hormonal effects on human behavior," he whispered, tugging at Bruce's blanket, hard enough to make a point, but not hard enough to actually pull it off the bed. "That's what you used to be interested in, back home, isn't it? Endorphins from running, adrenal fatigue from moving through vacuum in a tin bucket: How do they mesh?"
And then Steve is turning around, pulling Tony in, and Tony is running his hands all over his chest and shoulders and back, wanting to touch everywhere, feeling as if he's been robbed of something and now he desperately wants  to compensate.
. Fury's words from twenty years back had been ringing in Tony's ears ever since his application was first disqualified. It had to be it. Fury had to have put a stop to it.
Tony pulled his sock back on. His head was reeling. It was all too much. Days – who knew how many – of nothing but darkness and resignation, and then all these feelings, simultaneously tearing through his insides.  "Cap, are you
Tony listened to the report as he poured hot water from the kettle. The blood pressure was almost back to normal, and arrhythmia seemed to have subsided completely. Steve was still chilled through and shocky, but perhaps this wasn't a medical emergency anymore. Awesome news.
), who started conversations – or, well, what passed for conversations between the two of them these days. And he
Tony: Also, there was nothing she could tell them even had she wanted to, which she didn't, obviously. She wouldn't have, even if we hadn't smoothed things over recently.
The bed was old, and he had a slight crick in his neck, but he was warm and snug, all wrapped up in blankets. The wintry freshness on his face, as a contrast, let him know the fire had died down during the night (crap, he’d forgotten to bank it), and now he’d have to get up and light it again. In a minute. He delayed opening his eyes. Savored the fact he could postpone the beginning of this day for a bit longer. If he didn’t open his eyes, there was a 50% chance he wouldn’t have to deal with anything.
"Uh-uh," he replied, resolute to say nothing. It lasted all of four seconds. "I want to ask you a million things. But I get a feeling you don't want me to. So, ah, I guess I'd better not."
The moment of closeness had effectively erased all the thoughts from Tony's head, and now all he was was capable of was a resentful:
There was more to that sentence than the simple sum of words. Steve’s eyes went to meet Tony’s, as if some kind of chemical affinity drew them together. Tony couldn’t look away either. His breath hitched, but hey, who needs breath anyway? Aware he sounded strangled, Tony managed: “Okay, maybe you’re enjoying the day, but that’s not the same thing,” he said, and an attempt at nitpicking made his heart resume the previous rhythm. He breathed out, some of the composure returning to him. “You’re here with
one more time. Nine days of Thor... well, okay, so Thor was mostly calm and collected, but that was just him mentally preparing to get his hands on whoever was responsible for this. He did mutter darkly to himself a lot, though.
. With less urgency and more... intimacy, he supposed. But, he reminded himself, it wasn't as if Steve exactly went around lusting after him every day. Tony forced himself to stop for a sec, tear his gaze away. "You're sure about this, right?" he asked, a bit sobered up. Then: "Steve?"
But that seemed like a discussion for later, when he had his breath back. Instead he gave him half a smile and shrugged. "Want a beer? It's cold."
"If I ask you how you are feeling, are you going to get all weird again? Because I need to know it for strictly practical purposes of getting us out of this shithole."
Tony: They can't keep her confined. Look at the public outrage. They don't have anything to keep her FOR. They don't have anything to threaten her with either, not for real. To blackmail her with. Don't worry, dammit, I'm handling this.
Why Avengers? I mean, the former Avengers? Because we had the intel and there wasn't time, and we informed the police, but we couldn't offer much in the way of proof, and besides, excuse me, but everyone and their pet chinchilla know Madripoor police is corrupt, and even if they weren't, they wouldn't be equipped to deal with this kind of threat.
"You actually showed up." Tony is not moving away from the door, he just stands there, like a door post, like a statue. Looking at Steve. Maybe. (All Steve can say is that the front of the helmet is turned in his direction. The eye-slits are shiny.) Then: "I wasn't sure if we were actually playing chicken or what."
hear it from Steve's lips. As if that would make Tony understand. As if it would make Tony care to try...
I couldn't stand to see him in pain. "Maybe, if you called Pepper and talked to her, maybe you could still..." I began, clawing my heart out from my chest, tossing it in the dirt and casually stepping on it so that Tony wouldn't notice it was there at all.
But now he was unusually out of sorts. It was just that kind of night. He went through the conversation on autopilot, not even cursorily trying to be charming.
Steve spared him a sideways glance. "It messes with the visibility; I need the visibility," he said in a tad milder voice.
Another salve of polite laughter around them; Tony barely registered it. Everyone knew Iron Man and Captain America were such good friends, right,
And this is the one option Tony didn't exactly dare to hope for, and now that it's in play, he's frozen with terror.
Steve sighed. Smiled slightly, but it wasn't a happy smile. Tony could tell he was trying to put his thoughts into words. Tricky, that, when emotions are involved.
And sometimes the world was so horrible he just wanted to bury himself in Malibu sand and stay there forever.
And then Steve was reaching over. Tony had no fucking idea how in the name of hell the man could stay upright in this velocity, these turns. He was leaning against the back of Tony's chair now, and then his hand was right on Tony's shoulder, gripping for real – no hesitant brushes of fingers now. He was leaning over, putting his hand over Tony's on the control stick, steering together with him, guiding him, faster, ever faster. He wasn't saying anything, but Tony could hear his heavy breathing so close, felt the fingers digging into his shoulder, felt a fist gripping his own, warm and dry and big. Herd his soft laughter intertwined with Tony's whoops as they steered together.
anyway. It even has a jacuzzi," she adds in a loud, suggestive whisper, and when had it become okay to insinuate this or that about people's private lives? It's highly unprofessional.
me sorry," he adds reproachfully. "Also, those people down there are absolutely unbearable, and you just had to egg them on did you."
(Because it would almost be better to just let Steve go altogether than to have yet another relationship with a failed start after failed start, dragging into infinity. And still he couldn't say no if Steve asked.)
Still woozy, but more or less awake, Tony fumbled for a cup of drinkably stale coffee and glanced at Steve's real-world art that was still lining the windows of the office in the Compound. Yep, the same style; the same hand, evident in every stroke. The straight lines, the sharp angles. He had been looking through Steve's eyes, in the dream; so, the following thought might have been his, or Steve's. All the boundaries had been blurred like a chalk outline someone had stepped on.
He had to get out of here. He had to... "We need to talk. Like, now," he muttered at Steve, almost a whisper. Because this was insane. The music was getting louder, and the dancers were whirling away, not so far from them now, and maybe no one was paying attention to him and Steve any more, locked as they were in their silent battle, as per usual. Still, it seemed they were going to end up yelling or snarling at each other (probably a healthy combo of both) – even though it had been the last thing Tony wanted, merely half an hour ago – so at least they should do it away from all these people.
Tomorrow morning he emerged rough-haired and wild-eyed, so I of course figured he hadn't gotten any sleep. I'd just been cooking some eggs for breakfast, hoping to trick the sick feeling in my stomach into thinking it was just hunger. I'd woken up, alone in the penthouse, and started thinking it had been a mistake to come here, and how Tony surely didn't want me to stay.
Steve obeys, shuddering, blushing, and Tony starts pumping it lightly. Just an inch in, just an inch out. It's not even especially uncomfortable, except perhaps for the woven leather of the handle dragging across Steve's lips with a bit of roughness. But the fact that Tony is fucking his mouth with a handle of a flogger makes his cheeks redden, his cock twitch. The sudden coldness on the tip of his cock means precum is trickling out, and his insides contract with a mixture of shame and pleasure at the thought of how incredibly turned on he is by this.
Looking at Tony, Steve now felt like one of the random no-names in the audience. And his throat constricted. He looked away, so that Tony wouldn't get a chance to do it first.
"It's weird," he said, seemingly inconsequentially. "Everything's happening at the same time; yesterday was crazy. You sure can appreciate that, right?"
"Your brain is receiving and internalizing Berger waves, which shouldn't be possible – hell, it shouldn't be possible to emit them in such quantities as your pal does, let alone..."
