Peter stared directly into Tony’s eyes, as if searching for sincerity. He seemed to find solace in what he saw there because his face relaxed a little. Tony pushed on.
“I’m ready for everyone in the jet to receive medical attention.” Bruce added.
“He asked me too.”
“Don’t lie to me. I know what I saw.” Now Tony was furious. How dare Peter lie right to his face.
As Bucky walked to his room, he was approached by Natasha. “I have a spray that would keep it from smudging for longer, do you want some?”
Steve pulled at Tony’s shirt. Tony leaned back, but Steve was persistent. “I’m fine now. It was just an allergic reaction. Calm down and climb into bed with me.”
“Well it’s a good thing he’s not your son so your input doesn’t matter then, doesn't it? Like you said ‘Richard and Ben and May and me’ made sure that he grew up safely, not you.”
“What the hell?” Tony yelped as he stubbed his toe on something large on the floor of his bedroom. He’d just come back from a mission almost half a day earlier than expected which meant he’d arrived in New York in the middle of the night. He’d planned on slipping into his room and into bed with Steve. He’d FaceTime’d with Steve a few hours ago so he knew Steve would be sleeping deeply: they were always able to sleep better after talking to each other.
Tony’s mind went blank. What was going on? Why didn’t Peter kiss him goodbye? Wait, that wasn’t the main problem. Why was Peter so awkward at the mention of the party? Why did he leave so quickly? That was clearly an excuse. Didn’t he like spending time with Tony? Tony’s mind spun for a bit with questions and insecurities about his relationship.
“I love you Bucky. That isn’t changing. I don’t care that you’ve changed. I’ve changed too. Can I touch you?”
Here are my oneshots for the Marvel Fandom! They’re all ships between established characters in the Marvel Universe!
Tony cautiously sat down on the couch. He left a good six inches of space in between himself and Steve. Steve scooted closer. Tony scooted away. Steve sighed and pressed play on the remote.
Tony stared at Bucky with wide eyes. His expression was so shocked that Bucky realized immediately that he had misread something.
Right on schedule, there was a knock on the door and two cartloads of food were brought in.
“It does what?” Clint turned toward Thor in disbelief.
Peter frowned, “I’d just call the suit. You were the one who added that feature, remember?”
“Hi,” Steve whispered, “Did you need this?”
But he couldn’t bring himself to leave.
“Captain America was off gambling and drinking in brothels during the war?” Sam teased. “I always thought you would be the bad influence.” He looked at Bucky.
Steve shrugged, “Habit, I guess.”
“It’s just the explosions. They’re too much to take.” Tony arches an eyebrow at Peter’s response, “You don’t like fireworks?”
“Okay?” Steve was a bit confused at Tony’s strong reaction but settled back in. “That’s alright. You don’t need to rush.” He quickly found himself dozing off to the humming of Tony’s arc reactor and the swell of his chest as he breathed.
Today was awful. Bucky had to go to the doctor for a physical this afternoon and Steve wasn’t there to sit with him. He hated doctors. He hated needles. How could anyone know what was in the shots they were getting? Were they scanning your head or messing with your brain? Is the medicine they prescribe even good for you? It’s not like you would be able to tell without an advanced degree in pharmacology and a handle on medical jargon. Honestly, most of his suspicions came from his time under HYDRA. He knew that Tony wouldn’t let him see an evil doctor. He knew that he had friends to keep him safe. Sam, as much as they fought, even went with him to the appointment and gently talked him through everything they did. He respected Bucky’s boundaries and asked the doctor to slow down, stop, or leave whenever he noticed too much strain.
Then Steve reached for the TV remote. He usually put the news on as a sort of background noise when they were in the living room.
“Hey baby, buy you a drink?”
Peter winced as he slowly rubbed his neck. While he was distracted by evacuating an old woman from the bank, the robber had landed a solid punch. A large bruise was already starting to form.
Steve stood in silence for a minute. Tony felt like he was going to throw up. He wanted to bolt but willed himself to stay because Steve deserved it. He wasn’t expecting it when Steve pulled him into a passionate kiss. “Thanks” He whispered and motioned toward the door. “If you haven’t eaten since you’ve been down here, do you want to go to dinner?”
It felt right.
Steve accidentally butt dials his boyfriend, Tony, at the pet shelter which results in misunderstandings.
Tony choked on his coffee.
“He’s definitely your son Cap.”
“Face masks!” Peter exclaimed “MJ gave me some clay ones after finals finished. She says she thought I could use them, which I’m hoping wasn’t an insult. Do you want one?”
Once they got the lodge, the team practically sprinted inside. They haphazardly claimed their rooms and threw their stuff down before grabbing skis that Tony’s robots had designed to be the perfect size for each of them.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to wake you up. You don’t need to do it for me.”
“Is the pool heated?”
“Me neither” Steve’s eyebrows furrowed in concentration.
Steve’s shoulder sagged in relief and he beamed at Tony. “Maybe someday I’ll build up the nerve to do something in public, but for now, can we continue where we left off?”
“Thirty seconds starts now.” Bruce announced checking his watch.
“We have to get out. Just look at my hands - they’re all pruny.”
“You’ve done this before?” Tony was losing it now. He wanted to think about new information logically, but his imagination was filled with scenes of the two gorgeous super soliders having sex.
“It’s just a nick, you really don’t need to.”
Steve thought for a minute before nodding. “Okay, I can try. Thanks.”
He smiled at the message from Tony and typed out a response before heading into the bathroom. The hot shower felt amazing on his sore muscles. He already could feel himself healing from the night’s injuries, but they still hurt. Once he was clean, he got into comfy lounge-wear and flopped on the bed. In minutes, he was fast asleep.
WARNING: References to Historical Homophobia
It’d been a couple weeks of flirting around the tower and going on a couple of dates when Tony almost ruined it.
Steve would wake up to Tony just staring at him from the edge of the bed. Tony kept trying to get him to nap and was constantly offering him soup. He appeared out of nowhere every time Steve so much as sighed when he shifted his weight. If Steve tried to lift anything more than fifteen pounds, Tony would wiggle in and take it from him. And then Tony would disappear, possibly after a conversation but nothing more.
The team must confront their worst fears in Asgard. Steve's brings up one of Bucky's deepest insecurities.
Tony’s thoughts were interrupted by Bucky eagerly rustling the papers and beckoning Steve over. “Doesn’t this look like Charlie?”
Luckily, Steve didn’t seem to care. “No, I’m still getting used to being back in my body. I thought I was a bit taller, but I guess not.”
“Yes, sir.”
“Calm down kid. Everyone’s going to shower and have some time for R&R before dinner. We’ll do all the sightseeing you want tomorrow.” Tony began to wearily make his way up the stairs. Him and Sam were pretty beat. The other three, given their enhanced healing, weren’t as worse for wear. By dinner time, Bucky, Steve, and Peter were waiting in the lobby for Sam and Tony to get ready.
After the hike, Peter was going to go for a swim. “I’ll be down by the beach for a bit.” He kissed Tony, who was stretched out in a hammock, exhausted from their morning hike, and made to move away.
“There’s nothing wrong. It’s just well...Um, in my day two fellas couldn’t just kiss in a public place.” Steve ran a hand through his damp hair to relax a bit. “I’m really sorry I pulled away. I still want to date you. That was just a little scary.”
After that fiasco, everyone decided to retreat to their own rooms and sleep off the tiredness they all felt.
“This is definitely going to happen. Who should represent the Avengers?” Pepper leaned over Peter’s shoulder, reading the article he’d pulled up on the trend. “Probably Captain America or Iron Man. It’d make sense for one of the most public figures to go.” She focused her attention on Tony, “You are the one providing the money and the one most directly connected to Stark Industries.”
"This sort of thing has happened before?"
Cap didn't say anything to that, just continued to tear at the napkin, and Tony watched him a few moments before he grabbed a tablet and a stylus and began to work out some more specs for the Mark… It had to be the Mark XVII, right? Wait, already? How many had he gone through in a month?
Now, Tony had been naked before. Tony had been naked in front of Steve before. But the body he possessed now was not in anywhere near as good a shape as the one he'd woken up with that morning, and as Steve went to explain where he was taking Olivia, Tony ducked behind the door because…  Because…
"Anyway—"
Bruce just blinked and stuttered out a few words like he wasn't quite sure where Tony was going with his questioning.
He reached out to the table and grabbed the remote. "Sure, kiddo," he said and handed it over to her. "Have at it."
"That is the second perfectly good slice of extra cheese that you've wasted. Who's going to eat that?"
bad? I know what you've done; I know what you're capable of—"
Steve tore his eyes away from the tablet and glanced down to him. "Hey," he said softly. "What's brought this on all of a sudden?"
Tony raised an eyebrow at him, and Barnes went just a little glum, shoving his hands in his pockets and hanging his head some.
Olivia looked up at the ceiling, face pinched, and muttered, "Friday woulda gotten it," and Rhodey snorted a laugh and said, "I can do a run. What kind of juice is it?"
Olivia."
Steve went over and held the door open for him, and he nodded his thanks and disappeared outside. "Who was that?" Steve asked Tony as the door swung closed.
"Yeah," Steve said with a sigh as he sat down as the island, Olivia's highchair beside him. She turned her head and smiled at him when she saw him, gurgling and babbling non-words at him.
"Well," Tony said and ran light fingers through Steve's hair, "they're assholes like that."
"I wasn't done with that."
Pepper just stood there staring at him, and about the only thing she could say to him was, "Well, you ramble like Tony."
Steve arched an eyebrow, and Tony rolled his eyes. "They think I'm
Tony shook his head. "Nothing. Never— J? Look, ordinarily I am perfectly fine with sharing information with my husband, but he was being a bit
"What?"
"Tell him to come up here," he told Natasha, not tearing his eyes away from the table. "I don't have stirrups, but I have a table we can use."
Tony turned to Steve for confirmation. "That's her name?"
Steve merely shook his head, his gaze focused on the TV. "It's just a series of rape scenes and bad lighting. Do people actually enjoy these things?"
Tony watched after them, staring, confused, and after the elevator door had closed behind the last one, he turned to Steve and said, "What the hell was that?"
Disappointment?
Hey, he was getting better about it. Poor Buck still stared up at the ceiling like it was watching his every move. Which it...kind of was, to be honest.
"There is
"What? Why?"
"I was mistaken," Thor said, sounding a little too sure for Tony's liking. "I had thought perhaps it was simply a timed spell, but it was not. It was one that has done exactly as was intended."
"Huh?"
No!" He nodded his head at Steve. "It's totally his."
Tony just 'hmm'ed at that but said nothing, and instead, he picked up a small piece of what looked like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and said, "Livvy, baby, come here and eat something halfway decent."
Steve went to reach out to touch him but then pulled back at the last second like he had thought better of it. "You didn't give me a chance to—"
"Yeah," Steve said and shoved a fry in his mouth.
Tracy rolled her eyes. "He's your father. He raised you and took care of you, which is more than you can say for that asshole sperm donor."
He motioned for Rhodey to follow him over to the elevator, and they went down to the workshop, Tony taking a seat at his workstation while Rhodey sat down in the free chair on the other side of it.
"Yeah, like someone else I know," he said and fired a few more shots.
"That's not the point. Clearly, either you're not telling me something or—"
"What?" Steve asked, genuinely curious.
He squinted at the watch face and tried to make out if he was reading it the right way. "Why are you awake this early?"
"As opposed to 'make love'?"
— but it's been seventy fucking years for him, Steve. He's spent more of his life as the Winter Soldier than I've fucking been alive!"
"Well, that's…terrifying," Tony said as the reality of what that meant hit him. Multiple unconnected and uncoordinated Hydra factions to contend with. Fuck, they were really going to have their jobs cut out for them going forward. "What did they want?"
"As I have said many a time, it is the bond that they share," Thor said, but that was all Tony heard. He leaned forward into Steve, his hands on either of Steve's biceps, and opened his mouth, allowing Steve to sweep his tongue in. He moaned a little at the force with which Steve pressed in and plundered his mouth, taking and claiming him for his own like he had so many times in the past, and it wasn't until he heard the tiny burp of a baby that he was startled back to reality.
," Steve murmured in that
"Good," Steve said, unable to stop a grin from spreading over his lips. "Because I like to be the big one."
The call cut out, and Tony heaved out a breath and dug the heels of his palms into his eyes. Fuck, what was he going to do when Cap came back? How was he going to explain this?
But Natasha just looked at him and said, "He didn't mean it that way."
" he yelled as his interface shorted a bit before it rebooted and came back online. He lost sight of what happened with Steve and Barnes, but the pressure of the steel against his suit lifted, and he saw Steve straining as he pulled the girder off of him, and once he'd got it lifted high enough, Tony was able to use the jets to blast his way away from the steel and into the open air.
Pepper just smiled a little and nodded like it now made perfect sense to her. "I see." She considered this a little longer then said, "No girl's name?"
on screen!"
Who's
implied that there might very possibly be
" he cried.
Barnes snorted a laugh but said, "Yeah, well, if Steve really fell for you when you were a fella, then he's not completely changed. Told me the serum fixed 'im, but I knew he was full of shit. I saw the way he looked sometimes. I saw the way he looked at that Peg Carter, but I saw the way he looked at the guys, too. It wasn't just 'anatomy studies' or whatever the hell he used to call 'em. Just glad he found…someone that isn't gonna hurt 'im. Was always afraid he'd get in over his head someday, and I wouldn't be able to bail him out. Somehow, I think he found someone more stubborn than himself."
"—for teaching our child something like that—"
"And deep down you know I'm right," he added. "Honey, I know. I get it, and I know, but you can't just expect everything to go back to the way things were before… Not immediately. Not yet. Not right now. It's going to take time. You know how you had to figure some things out when you came out of the ice? Imagine how he feels. Your life passed you by. His life… His life hasn't entirely been in the service of all that's good and just like yours has — and that's through no fault of his own."
Steve just squeezed his hand a little tighter. "It's not going to kill him. He's not dying," he said, but Bruce just frowned at him.
Steve took another step toward her. "You ever do this to him again without his permission, I'll break your neck."
"Yeah?" Steve said, and Tony heard the note of challenge in his voice. "She tries anything like this again, I'll snap her neck. She does not lay one finger on you without your permission."
Tony, through the twisting and thumping going on in his abdomen, smiled at Steve, a little teary and said, "Goddamn it!" and pulled his hand away from his drink to reach up and dab at the corners of his eyes. "Why do you always do this to me?"
"No," he murmured and gave the bump some consideration. He ran a hand over it, inquisitive and yet protective, the flash of his diamond and sapphire wedding band catching in the light, and turned to Steve. "I just can't believe— I mean, this is really happening."
"Hang on! Hold on! Well, that's not right. What if something, god forbid, happened to you? How are we supposed to explain you getting fried by a Hydra laser?"
"Hydra killed your parents, Tony, not Barnes. Barnes pulled the trigger, but Hydra was the one pulling his strings. They're the enemy here, not Barnes. Deep down, you know that. What you're upset about is even more personal than that. You're afraid if Barnes comes back into Steve's life, you're going to lose Steve to him. You're afraid you won't be the most important person in Steve's life any longer. I can't even say that's probably hormones talking because I think we'd still be having this same problem even without your…current situation. Only, in that case, you'd probably be down in your lab blowing yourself or the building up instead of crying into a tub of gelato."
He made it across the club with no sign of the table or the other three, and he rolled his eyes and glanced around. What the hell? Wasn't it back this way? The lights were down, so it was kind of hard to see, and the thumping music was so loud as to be distracting.
"No," he said earnestly. "Just saying." He glanced down to his right to see Olivia holding the receiver up to him. "Oh, my turn, huh?" He took the receiver from her and pretended to put it up to his ear. "Yes? What's that? Tony's grumpy act is all for show? He's actually got a gooey marshmallow center? Well, stop the presses! Looks like we've got a new headline to print."
"No, just…did some thinking," he replied as the headlights hit upon a darkened cabin up ahead. "That's all. How 'bout you? You feel any better?"
She just grinned at him, like she was fighting to keep a secret but wanted him to know she had one to keep. "That when we next meet, I am allowed to say 'I told you so.'"
"It's been building. I get it."
Steve just looked at him, and Tony swallowed but knew he had to be the cocky, optimistic one here.

they found him dead?"
He snorted a bitter laugh. "Only one way for me to ever be happy again, babe."
"No," Tony said, "
until Rhodey got the time to introduce them to whoever it was he claimed to have been having some thing with over the course of the past year or so. Well, if this...whoever-it- was was even real and was not a) a figment of his imagination or b) inflatable. But he had a whole host of stories about Rhodey that he could not wait to embarrass him with.
So, he made a 'hmm' sound but said nothing to that, and he went back to relaxing in his seat as Steve zipped them up what had turned into the Henry Hudson Parkway, enjoying the comfortable silence the drive afforded them.
but actual, legitimate truth.
"That I'm preg—
"Ah-ah-ah!" Tony cried. "Nope! No, don't want— Don't need— Keep your crazy little magical mystery tour to yourself. You've already caused enough trouble for one lifetime."
He opened his mouth to protest, but it just came out as a resigned sigh and he shook his head.
"You just told them whatever they wanted to hear, didn't you?"
"Steven, give me my baby."

before there's even been a wedding. It— It just feels like tempting fate to me. Look, I'm not saying we can't eat someone else's rejected wedding cake tomorrow after the ceremony, just…" He made a face and scratched his forehead. "I just don't think we should do it tonight," he finished, a little weak, like he wasn't comfortable with sharing what was probably some sort of old-fashioned and outdated rationale for not wanting to eat the rejected cake.
, Olivia."
Steve just smiled a little and reached out and rubbed his back, and Rhodey chuckled a little and said, "No, I mean it. Everything we all say about how disgusting and pathetic you are, you two really are cute together, and you're good for each other. And you make each other happy. I think that's all anyone that cares about either of you could ever ask for."
Rhodey, of course, was there to tell tales of Tony's stupid college endeavors (somehow forgetting to mention that
He jumped up from his chair. "Nope, I've made my decision! I'm going to become so feminine you won't know what hit you!"
But Wilson just grinned as his purchase evidently completed, and he glanced up at Steve and said, "Yeah, I get to learn all these really neat things about you."
"Tony, I don't have those drugs on me—"

"Tony," she said like she was trying to contain herself, hands fisted at her sides and teeth clenched, "get her away from me,
"I'm sure they would have liked to," he said and stuffed some more paper into the bag. "But the city's not going to clean itself up."
Bruce sighed and ran a hand over his face. "Yeah, you're probably right," he murmured and glanced around for anything that would entertain a four-year-old until her father's — her
like this, were they?
"Hmm…yeah, honey, that's sweet, but about the only way you can stop them from doing that is for us to fake our deaths and go into hiding, and even then, they could probably get about six months' traction out of insisting our deaths were caused by something I did."
"So?"
Still, there was something almost comforting about the movement, something that told him he wasn't completely alone, and he reached down and rubbed a gentle hand over his abdomen, pausing to poke back at a jab of movement against his right side.
Tony nodded at Barton. "Steve, hit him."
expected from life.
Bruce seemed surprised. "You think that's what it is?"
body I did have that whole thing with palladium poisoning, which I did not see listed as an option anywhere on any of the forms, and I had an arc reactor jammed into my chest for about five years, which, again, I did not see listed as an option anywhere on the forms. Then the various surgeries associated with that, etcetera, etcetera, which I didn't list because, again, different body. I don't seem to
"Oh, god, he makes a good point," Bruce murmured, but Steve just continued to give Tony that flat look as he said, "Sam's not into fellas, either. Just because two fellas bicker with each other doesn't mean they secretly want to make love to each other."
Tony just shrugged. When he said it like that, it did sound pretty fucking stupid. To think Steve had no other choice but
"But that doesn't mean that you aren't the absolute most important person in my life, and I swear on my life, I will make you believe that or die trying. Because it's the absolute truth. Because I've never met someone that could get under my skin the way you did from the moment I met them. I've never known someone that I could just share a look with and they'd understand every single thing I was thinking. I've never known someone that can read my mind the way that you can."
condition?"
"Yeah, but—" Steve began, rubbing his free hand over Tony's back and tightening his arms if that was at all possible, "—this is amazing. This is— This means so much to me, and I don't know how you did it, but…
"Yes," Tony said, "it's a portmanteau of 'Steve' and 'Tony.' Gossips like to do it a lot with celebrity couples. Not sure why it never caught on with us except with this clown—"
He could only imagine the look of surprise on her face when she realized her rejected cake had gone to Captain America and Iron Man. It would be doubly delightful if she was one of those reactionaries that detested the very idea of Captain America being in a relationship with Iron
She blinked and stared at him, silent, almost like she was equal parts relieved that the question was out in the open and she was mortified that she had been the one to bring it up.
Tony grimaced a little, his muted reflection staring back at him from the steel doors of the elevator. "Uh oh. I thought he knew that's where we're— What the hell are you doing?" he asked and turned to watch Natasha type away on her phone, her fingers working furiously over the screen. "Warning the other two about me?"
He was just wiping the sweat off his neck when Thor showed up in the room, and after he boomed out a jolly, "Hello!" he asked if Steve would want to run through some practice maneuvers with him.
"Figured it wasn't worth it. I had already waited twenty-five years to find the right partner. What was another twenty-five?" he reasoned then smiled at Tony, soft and intimate. "Or seventy?"
He cut off abruptly, and Steve tried to meet Tony's eyes to ask him to finish his thought, but Tony was too busy pressing his thumbs against the screen as though he was typing something onto it.
"'Kay," she say and let him lead her down the steps, grasping a tight hold of his hand (or however tight a four-year-old could hold) and holding onto the railing like she'd been told. He led her down into the living area and she ran over and plopped onto the couch face-down and then flopped on the cushions until she'd gotten herself comfortable, and as Tony snatched up his tablet again and sat back down, she said, "Papa, when c'n we bake Christmas cookies again?"
"Good. Don't need Captain America charged with assault and battery of some fucking paparazzo that deserves whatever shit he gets."
Wait, Tony was a woman now, or in a woman's body, and Tony was measured at five-eight (five-
He bit into the bagel and chewed, cream cheese gathering at the corners of his mouth, and Natasha went into the kitchen for a moment before she reappeared with a napkin and held it out to him.
Too late. Steve and Barnes were making their way back into the living room, and Barnes was taking the chair once again while Steve sat on the couch, this time on Tony's other side so that Tony was sandwiched between the arm of the couch and Steve. Steve crowded a little into him, and he put his arm around Tony's shoulders and pulled him in to give him a kiss on the cheek and said, "What're you doing?"
Contrary to popular belief, I am aware of the fact that the map does not end at the Hudson River."
"What? Really? You're doing this?" Rhodey asked but still let Pepper take hold of the baby.
But she did nothing but smile at them and say, "Do you have any questions for me?"
He heard Natasha and Pepper Potts greet each other, and then Natasha was introducing Pepper to both Bucky and Sam. Tony still hadn't said a word, and maybe he wasn't actually there because he himself hadn't actually
understood except he'd been given the exact opposite gift. He'd been shown a glimpse of what his future could be like, and instead of depression and misery it was…kind of nice. Really kind of nice. Everything he'd ever dreamt of but never really let himself imagine could actually happen. It was warm. Safe. Secure.
"Because I took her down to the workshop last night.""What? To show her the Iron Man suits?"
"Yeah."
"Is that a come-on?"
"Hmm?" Tony asked and turned to him, a hint of a teasing smile on his face. "Well, the little round things filled with liquid are called 'mugs,' and the—"
Thor nodded and began to lead away, and Steve kept his hands on Tony's face until Thor had gone too far, his fingertips falling away, though not before Tony was able to get in one last kiss against the pad of his finger.
"Eh, maybe it wouldn't be such a good idea to go out?" he said after a moment's deliberation. "Last time that happened, I ended up getting caught on camera admitting to being knocked up with Captain America's love child."
They both shook their heads, and Tony sighed and said, "How 'bout a Disney movie? What's a popular one? Snow White? Cinderella? Little Mermaid? J, we got any of those—" He rolled his eyes at the sad little look on her face. "What? What's wrong with Disney movies?"
"You know, we could just go with 'Virginia Margaret' and be done with it."
, Tony realized last night that, to some degree, nothing beat pleasuring yourself with your own hand.
don't finish that thought!"
"Why not? I'm not some slave you can order around."
Steve nodded and took his words at face-value, but Tony startled and said, "Wait,
"I'm an idiot," Steve said and began to serve himself, "but I'm not

"Did you want

"Told you," was all Wilson said before Barton turned to the assembled group and said, "Well, I guess now's as good a time as any."
Tony didn't have an answer, and he just shook his head a little and said, "She's probably not even mine, anyway."
only because you belong to me and they can get their own goddamned quick-learning super soldier."
it. Deep inside him, he didn't
all yours," he said, his tone flat. Steve saw this more as a compliment than the slight exasperation that Rhodey intended it to be, and, with one arm around him, he hugged Tony close and pressed a kiss to his temple.
Esmeralda nodded to the infant in his arms. "And wouldn't you have come to regret your choice if you had?"
"Hurt? Fuck you, Steve. I'm more protected in this tin can than you are with that flimsy suit."
"I want this."
"What? What don't you know?"
Rhodey rolled his eyes and went back to his dessert, and Steve murmured a quiet and knowing, "
Tony shrugged. "What's the point? We don't need it."
No, the one thing he would change was that he would somehow —
Tony shoved a spoonful of the mixture into his mouth. "You know, it's really not that bad," he said around a mouthful of food, and Rhodey rolled his eyes and got to his feet.
He went to make his way back to the elevator, but Steve ran ahead of him and cut him off, blocking his access.
"Nothing," he said and sat up, cradling Olivia against him, "I'm babbling. It's late. I'm tired. I'm going to go put this one to bed."
She frowned a little. "Is that the stuff they put in dried walls?"
"What do you mean I'll come to find out? What are you talking about? I'm from Mid— I'm human. I have the same life expectancy as anyone else from Earth."
"It's really a pain anywhere in the city," Bruce said. "I guess Steve's right and we could have just walked."
rain on his and Steve's wedding day, and that was supposed to be good luck, right?
Tony suspected Barnes's words were actually more than about Steve's hairstyle. As Barnes had changed, evidently, the part of him that remembered the war and before realized his little pal Stevie had changed as well. But it was easier to tie that to something superficial like a hairstyle than anything deeper.
"Yeah, anyway," Barnes aid and turned his attention to Tony. "Is he blaming himself? Yeah, but that's the kind of guy Steve is. Does he think this is all his fault? Yeah. Does he think all of your pain and misery can be traced back to him? Sure."
"It looks good on you, Tones," Rhodey said, nodding his approval. "Very—" He cut off and glanced from Steve to Tony and asked, "Is it OK to call you 'pretty'? I don't know what the—"
But Steve reached down and put a gentle hand to Tony's shoulder. "
built up. I don't— I don't even have a picture of my parents. Kinda wish I had at least that."
Steve moved his hand from Tony's hair to cover Tony's mouth. "Don't even. You're a good person, Tony. Maybe you haven't always done good things, but you're a good person."
"—my dignity, my right to privacy, control of certain...functions...but I did

Tony thought about this, tapping the tip of his knife against his chin. "Hmm…a whole weekend, just you and me and a big, empty house. Whatever could we

"Do it again."

Yeah, OK, so maybe he had been closer to falling asleep than he'd thought?
Well, he wasn't thinking about
"Not in this situation it's not. I think it would be better for you to understand what's going on and what to expect." Steve shot him a knowing look. "Pretending it's not happening isn't going to make it go away, you know."
"Evidently," Barnes said, and Natasha made to swat at him again while Tony rolled his eyes. "What?" he asked. "He's been at it a while. You don't see the kid falling out of him, do you?"
The car arrived in the lobby, and they pushed on with about half-a-dozen other people that had crowded behind them in the time they had been waiting, and Steve kindly held the door for everyone then hit the button on the panel for each of the floors requested, which, of course, just meant it took them longer to get to their floor, but whatever, wasn't like he wanted to go to this stupid thing, anyway. Bruce and JARVIS were both totally capable of handling everything for him no matter what Bruce said.
money. They feel real, don't they? Like I was born with them." He shook his head. "I wasn't."
"I didn't want to hurt him," he all but whispered.
you made plans."
Steve still didn't look at him, but he smiled a little and let out a noise that sounded like an exhaled laugh.
Tony moved his mouth from Steve's jaw to the pulse point in his neck. He sucked at it a bit then said, "Can't teach an old dog new tricks."
"No," Wilson. "No, no, that's— That's totally—" He looked between Steve and Tony. "I demand a recount."
"Didn't sound like it, from what I could hear," Wilson added.
" she asked, and Tony could hear the click of heels like she was walking somewhere. "
He looked down at his belly, covered by the thin, colorful material of the teddy, and he put his hands there and rubbed it.
Steve Rogers was an anomaly.
"OK, calm down," he said. "You know more about this stuff than I do, so…" He heaved out a sigh. "So, what? We just let something that awful happen?"
Stark gritted his teeth like he was trying to keep himself from falling over the precipice and giving into Steve then ground out a stubborn, “I’m going to my union about this.”
He hit the button to pop the trunk, and he heaved out a breath and got out of the car, slamming the door shut and wincing as he used his right hand to do so. He looked down at his wrist and saw the ugly red and purple bruises that had already formed, and he rubbed it a little and went over to the trunk to grab his bag. Fuck Steve's bag. The bastard could grab it himself if he ever decided to come back home.
" he whined, forgetting himself for a moment. Wasn't Steve trying to play as a 'Roger' for this stupid exercise?
He rolled his eyes. "One
Three perplexed sets of eyes stared at him — Rhodey was still busy with his phone — and he glowered and said, "Romanoff, don't even try it. I know for a fact you've shed a tear at that movie."
"Uh, yeah. Who'd you think it would be?"
"Bleeding. Are you— Have you noticed, when you go to the bathroom, is there any...blood? Like a slight pinkish tinge?"
Tony scoffed and waved him off. "I'll be fine, babe. I can handle myself— And besides, this kid isn't going anywhere. He's way too comfortable where he is."
"Oh, fuck, you know what I want? Gelato. I need chocolate peanut butter cup gelato like
"But I don't understand how—"
fucking weight to put on my shoulders, especially considering that if anything happens to this petulant little sea monster I'm growing inside of me I'm shit-out-of-luck."
Tony raised an eyebrow. "I notice both of those you mentioned were for cigarettes." Steve shrugged.
"She says JARVIS sounds like someone she knows called 'Vision.' She talks about a Wanda and a Sam. She even knows who Hank fuckin' Pym is. But she has not once made any mention of Cap."
think Steve and I are the exception to this, but
Tony groaned. "You're such a fucking boy scout!"
"That's 'cuz Daddy's not home. You don't eat when Daddy's not home."
"Don't call him that! Don't allow him that! He's a fucking murderer is what he is."
Tony frowned. "Wait, I'm not an Avenger?"
"I don't know about good parents," Steve said then added, "and language."
"Tony—" he started to say, and Tony turned to address the group again and said, "Good lord, you try to attach one eggbeater to a drill, and suddenly he thinks you're out of your mind."
Welch hummed in thought then said, "Well, at least the Captain there," he said and nodded his head at Steve. "Until they can find a way of replicating the serum that made the Captain the perfect weapon that he is, they might as well
"Because the order's important to you."
Steve gave him a funny look, partly-bemused, partly like he wondered what in the world Tony had just said, and Tony put his hands up in defense and said, "Hey, I'm just trying to speak your language, old man."
"Did think you would," Tony said and made a move to assume a position then stopped abruptly. "Right, you don't— OK, so you're probably going to want to be the one to lead, yeah? So, you'll want to—"
"No," Steve said, shaking his head some, nose brushing against his hair. "No, it— Don't act like it was 'nothing.' It wasn't 'nothing.' It was— This is amazing, Tony. This is—
Tony lay back down on the table, making sure to keep his legs together, and the doctor chuckled a little and said, "You can relax your legs."
"Sure, and
She twitched a small smile at him. "I don't think I should test them out on teammates."
Bruce sighed out a breath and said, "Tony, I don't think you're giving yourself enough credit—"
in light of certain falsehoods that, again, were never proven."
"Mmm… It smells like you."
"What are you—"
" was the answer from the kitchen.
"What? Why not?" Tony asked, quickly and on the defensive.
come first, no matter what."
Tony stared at him a moment, quirking his head as a bemused sort of smile stretched over his lips. "You know, that may just be the most insulting thing you've ever said to me."
Barnes's mouth fell open, and his eyes went owlish like he knew exactly what Tony was going to say. "Oh, god," he muttered.
Steve just dropped his head at Tony's rather blunt explanation, but he picked himself back up and met Tony's gaze again.
It was no secret amongst the castle denizens that the King liked to be
As marriage ceremonies went, it was quick and painless if utilitarian in nature. Tony had always thought he'd throw a big catered affair if he were ever to get married — really just an excuse to have a big, huge, expensive bash that he could invite all his friends to — and maybe if things worked out the right way and Tony went back to being, well, the way he was, they could have a big affair sometime in the near future. As it was, they were stuck with the intimate little ceremony, which was nice, he supposed. It did what it was supposed to do, and it was nice that it was just Tony, Steve, and their friends…
Tony was quiet a moment then said, "It— If I tell you, you have to promise not to get mad."
Tony relaxed back into his chair and said, "That was also a thousand years ago. Things change. I'd say we also have FM radio now, but we're already up to satellite, so who cares about that?"
Steve woke up the next morning to Tony snoring in his ear.
"Yeah, well—"
"Yeah, well, I didn't agree to marry either one of them, J, and I am not currently pregnant with the spawn of either one of them, either. Um…for future reference, let's maybe not inform Miss Potts about how flippant I was about not agreeing to marry her."
Bruce just shrugged some and turned his attention to his drink, and Natasha said, "You don't even have anything picked out just for fun?"
"Your moles do," Steve said and glanced over to him pointedly.
"You love us, Stark," Barton said and picked up his orange juice. "Don't even pretend you don't. You didn't want us here, you would have sent us packing a long time ago."
birthday. Pops open when you're turned on — are you
about it?"
Tony nodded. "Mmm," he agreed, "they did beat up Santa Claus."
A daughter. A baby girl.
"As cool as it would be to get married in the Iron Man armor," Rhodey said and piled a slice of toast with eggs and bacon, "I think the Cap might see that as marrying 'Iron Man' when he really wants to marry Tony Stark."
"Then…how long do you have to stay like this?"
"Why what?"
The other half was because it was a fucking gorgeous ring, and he wanted it, damn it!
Tony thinned his lips into a flat line. "Turns out it wasn't a dream. Guess what day it is."
Tony sighed and put the glass back to his lips again. "OK, got it. Don't die unless Steve goes first. You know, that is a
"It's a cellphone — well, a brand of cellphone. My company makes them."
He pushed himself away from the glass and strode back over to the chair, and he collapsed back onto it and said, "Cut the lights, J."
Steve nodded then stopped short and said, "Uh, are— I mean, are we really going to see you again then?"
"Not like that. I mean like this. Like us." He motioned amongst the three of them, Olivia now back to playing with the toy telephone, banging the receiver against the base. "Didn't I get married after the war?"
"I don't know. Like a flutter of some kind. Sort of like a muscle twinge but not quite. Steve, what if it's—"
him?"
"It's…it's all right."
Thor just smiled at him, and he heard the click of heels against tile. He turned to see Natasha and Bruce coming toward them, a bouquet of colorful hydrangeas and alstroemeria in Natasha's hands. He rolled his eyes and said, "You really didn't have to do this," as she passed the bouquet off, Rhodey taking the phone from his hands in the exchange, but she just smiled and said, "You can't get married without a bouquet. Besides, we have to find out who's getting married next."
"Yeah!"
"Nat doesn't own a car."
Tony's back was screaming in pain from how he had slept bent over the table, and his chest felt a little tight from how the table had pressed against the reactor for several hours of exhausted slumber, and as Olivia excitedly chirped about shield waffles — whatever those were — and tugged on his hand, he groaned and sat back in the chair and said, "Whoa, wait a second, short- stack. Let Papa work the kinks out of his back first."
“Brucey-bear you can be as filthy as you want with me.”
“Can you repair it?” The consultant asked,
Peter didn’t even look up when a message came from the office, not until his teacher called his name and told him to get his things and go directly to the front office.
“Because I can hear someone in there, they sound like they’re in pain.” Peter said, his urgency increasing when the moaning grew louder and more piteous, “MJ Please!”
Matt had been to the Police and explained the situation, hanging over the evidence. The detective wanted to speak to Tony the following morning, to get his statement for the investigation.
“Nothing, I’m fine. Now let’s get this show on the road!”
“Surface level and this is, sub basement two, of course, it couldn’t be just one flight of stairs could it?”
*****
“I not be ins… insborbent.” He babbled, “Promise, I be good.” He looked at Tony, “Promise Mamma, I be good.”
“Alright,” he said with a nod of his head, “Start the ball rolling, set the wheels in motion, and other words to that effect.” He grinned, “And what do you think about it, Lily-Bee?”
Peter did so without difficulty and did the same with his legs which satisfied the Doctor that he had not suffered paralysis or brain damage. Especially when Peter recounted what had happened at Oscorp without difficulty.
“They are great kids.” Steve said placing a kiss on Tony’s head, “You’ve done a wonderful job with them.”
“No thanks necessary, Cap.” Tony said with a slightly forced smile, “And you haven’t even met all my Kids yet, you’ve got to meet the boys.”
“When did my Petey-pie grow up from a cute little munchkin into teenager that worries that hell out of me by jumping off ceilings and has hormones and wants to have sleepovers with his friends but doesn’t want adults around?”
“I think my (Younger Brother) as you seem to be calling him, is suffering from shock at no longer being an only child!” He said, giving the cameras smile, “He and I are very different though.”
Tony smiled at the interaction, impressed by the way Steve had handled the situation. There was no guarantee that he and Steve would have Pups together, there was no guarantee that his fertility hadn’t been permanently damaged by the palladium, but if one day in the future they should have a litter, Tony would not be upset by the prospect.
“You had a choice, you and your brother had a choice.” Sam corrected her, “No one forced you to undergo experiments, you chose to do that. You and he could have done anything with your lives, worked hard, put yourselves through school, become Doctors, or lawyers. Hell you could have climbed into the backs of lorries and gotten out of Sokovia, made a case to be asylum seekers in another country. You did not have to do what you did, so do not pretend that you were without options, maybe not easy ones, but you still had them.”
“Missed you Mamma!” He declared,
“Hmm looks like they’ve both decided to remain silent for the time being.” Tony said grinning at Steve, “I don’t know how long this positive opinion of us will continue but lets enjoy it while it lasts.”
This brought a genuine grin to Tony’s face, “That is very true.” He slipped back into Steve’s embrace, his chin resting on Steve’s shoulder.
“I only…”
It was odd, most people would think that you would never get sick of fast food, that living off take away pizza, burgers, and other junk that can buy quickly and easily would be a dream, but the truth was after a few days your palette grew stale. You grew sick of taste of too much salt, the feel of grease on your tongue, you started to crave something fresh, something wholesome and nourishing.
This isn’t happening. This can’t be happening. He can’t be losing Tony, he can’t, he can’t.
Clint made a face, “She’s an icy bitch at the best of times, a stickler for the rules. But that doesn’t mean she’s in bed with a Nazi organisation.”
“Really?” Steve snorted, “You make it sound like I’m keeping a battalion in my pants!” His eyes widened and a breathy gasp escaped his lips as Tony’s hand stroked over his crotch.
“What will happen now?” Peter asked.
Fury gave Tony an impressive glare, “Carry on Stark and I’ll bend you over this table and make damn sure you can’t sit down for a month!”
“Well I got there eventually.” He offered.
“Stay still.” Bruce admonished him, “You have a severe concussion and smoke inhalation, you are not leaving that bed for at least twenty-four hours, probably longer.”
“It’s not you,” Tony said, cursing himself for how lame that sounded. “You are in a really bad place right now, you are vulnerable and hurting and… it’d be wrong of me to take advantage of that.”
Tony gagged and spluttered, he thumped uselessly at the man’s chest but it felt like he was hitting solid metal, the grip tightened and stars exploded before Tony’s eyes as the blood supply to his brain was cut off as well as his air, he wouldn’t last long like this, a few seconds at the most and the last thing he would see were soulless eyes staring at him as his throat was crushed.
“I just wasn’t expecting……it’s not every day you meet a celebrity.” The woman said, “I feel like I should ask for an autograph.”
It had been decorated with balloons and a welcome home banner, the Bots had been brought up from the Lab and were beeping and booping and jostling each other to be the first to get to their creator.
Tony jumped and whirled around, glaring at Steve, “Don’t do that.” He snapped, putting his phone away.
“Taller.” Tony said, “And much broader.” Tony said, “I’ll show you some pictures if you’d like.”
“We’ve got a Chicken burger over here for the munchkin.” Tony said, “And the single cheese burger.” He and Zach were sat besides the window doing maths together. With Zach out of school for the time being Tony didn’t want to neglect his education so he was educating his Son himself, today he’d been learning times tables and arithmetic, subtraction, and division.
Pepper informed him of this when he arrived back at the tower, once she was done yelling at him for getting himself hurt, and then hugging him and making sure he was alright.
At any other time Tony might have found it funny to have Steve making a reference to a sex toy, but right now his humour completely lost.
“How about we have a lazy day watching movies?” Peter said, “We can stuff our faces on junk food and help catch Steve up on the entertainment he’s missed.”
The man snarled and lashed out, he kicked Steve in the face and his hands suddenly became vices on Tony’s gauntlets, the metal groaning under the strain which added pressure to Tony’s already wounded arm, his grip on the man loosened which he used to his advantage dropping down and using his body weight to drag Tony down with him then hurled Tony hard against the piler, the brickwork cracking and the suit caving in on one side.
“I’m not getting into that argument again.” He paused and considered things, “Maybe you should stay here with Bucky instead of coming to the UN with me and Rhodey.” Steve looked up from Lily with surprise,
“Not put out on a first date?” Tony asked,
These remarkable individuals have come together to risk their lives and protect us against threats that no one else could face. We have seen them in action, we have seen what they are capable of when working alone and when working together. We know them to be incredible people of unimaginable bravery.
“A custom made terror threat.” Clint spat in disgust. He’d seen some sick shit in his time, too much really, but this was beyond belief. That someone could be low enough to become the face for a terror organisation just to get drug fixes and a few expensive gifts was unbelievable.
He started when a hand clasped his shoulder and he looked to see Sam standing next to him, “I’ll be alright Cap.” The Sergeant said encouragingly, “Tony was in his suit and Peter is enhanced, they’ll survive this.”
*****
“We know sweetie.” Steve said patting his shoulder, he cleared his throat, “I think it would be best if you show us these ships Director.”
“Hey did you know #CaptainDad and #SuperDadSteve are trending?” He laughed, “People are loving you more as a Dad than they already do as Captain America.”
“We’re fine.” Rhodey said, “We’re getting down to you, is Rogers there?”
Peter looked to Steve, “Dad, make him be reasonable.”
“And Tony?”
The host nodded, “From what the world has seen of the boys they are very well behaved and friendly children.”
“I wanted gourmet burgers but Pepper refused to allow them on any menu.” Tony said, “Apparently burgers aren’t classy enough no matter how fancy they are. Like is anyone too good for a cheese burger?”
“Are you nuts?” Steve demanded.
“You have no right to be here.” He spat at Steve, “You don’t belong here. If you are as much as soldier as you claim then you should have stayed in your world and fought on like a man, not run like a coward. You say it’s to protect that kid, Lola or whatever her name is, but she’s not even yours. She’d be better off without you, we all would.” He kicked Steve in the face, momentarily stunning the prone man, giving Rogers the chance to go for his shield, but turning his back was mistake, as Steve freed himself from the widow bite and leaped onto Rogers back, forcing him to his knees as he delivered punches to his kidneys.
“Let her come up.” He said, carefully putting Zach down onto the sofa. Zach had awoken but he was still sleepy and would soon drift back off to sleep.
“Is this even going to be made public knowledge?” Tony asked, “Are the people Shield are proposing to protect going to have a say in this?” He knew the answer without Fury saying anything and scoffed, “No wonder Hydra found such a cosy home here.”
*****
With Steve’s help Tony managed to bring the armour into Sam’s condo and rested it in a corner.
This of course meant the pair or rather Steve, at Peter’s insistence had to try and prove Tony wrong, so the pace was increased so they could search in the woods for decent sized branches on their way back to the lake.
Steve was getting a lot of attention from the Omegas and female Betas despite everyone knowing that he and Tony were a couple. He didn’t give any sign of even noticing the flirtation though, his focus was on Tony, whom he never let out of his sight and never more than two metres away from his side.
“Oh man I’m gonna get to fly with Iron Man, so freakin’ awesome!”
A week later Tony held a sobbing Peter against his side as the boy wept for his Uncle and Aunt. He pushed his face into Tony’s side as the Priest said the final prayers over the coffins and threw dirt down onto them.
Likewise Natasha had no qualms about being filmed practising her knife throwing and shurikan throws, happily demonstrating the deadly art as she impaled dummies and targets with grace and deadly accuracy.
“Is Steef gone be our new Daddy now?” he asked Peter, “Him and Mamma have goned on a dot.”
“It must have been harrowing for the poor boy, he was what four at the time, five?”
They all got an early night, knowing that Zach would be up early, his excitement would have him up practically at dawn and then there would settling him until after he’d seen what Santa had bought during the night.
Recovering himself, Tony lay a hand on Steve’s shoulder and spoke to Zola, “Hydra’s plans, what are they, what do you mean when you say humanity will hand over their freedom?”
Peter shifted, trying to get comfortable in the crappy hospital bed, "Did everyone else get out okay?" He asked, "MJ, Ned?"
“Then don’t tell me you understand, because you haven’t a fucking clue about what I am feeling right now.” Tony shouted, “That bastard nearly murdered my son. He performed a vivisection on him while he was conscious. Do you have any idea how painful that is, because I damn well do.” Tony leaned forward over the table, getting into the detectives face, “I was conscious in a cave in Afghanistan when open heart surgery was performed on me. I was awake when my breast bone was cut into, the bones snapped and separated so the doctor could get at my chest cavity. I could taste the blood at the back of my throat, I wanted to scream but I couldn’t get enough air into my lungs to do so.” His voice lowered to a dangerous whisper that matched the dark glint in his eyes, “I killed the bastards who put me through that, I set them on fire and watched them scream as their bodies were engulfed in flames. What makes you think I will do any less to the asshole who just did the same to my Son as was done to me.”
“That’s not… we can’t, I can’t!” Steve stammered, “He’s Tony, Tony Stark, Genius, Billionaire, Mother, Philanthropist. What am I?”
“You let us die.” Pepper accused, She and Happy stood behind Sam and Rhodey, their flesh flapping like loose cotton in the wind, their bones clear to see beneath the sliced flesh.
“Morning people.” Peter said as he came into the kitchen, he stopped dead when he saw the leaning tower of pancakes that Clint was making a start on, “Um, why is Clint trying to give himself heart disease?”
“Is he…?” Clint began, getting out of the sea with Natasha.
Steve braced himself for the pain of his bones breaking but it never came, instead there came a blast from one of Tony’s repulsors and Bucky was thrown back, freeing Steve who coughed and spluttered, looking to where Bucky had fallen.
“You can’t shoot Norman Osborn Tony, we’ve been through this.” Steve said, “And Pete, I can’t think that a bit of name calling and trash talk being enough to make you lash out.”
“Oh!” Steve was slightly taken aback by that; although he didn’t know why, Tony was an Omega; he had heats, it was only natural that he’d be going into one.
Thor took to making sand castles with enthusiasm and soon he and Zach not only had a sand castle, they had a sand palace, with a sand fort, a sand mote and bridge, beyond the bridge on the other side of the sand mote the two of them created a sand town with different sized sand castles.
From the air Rhodey fired at Proxima who screeched in rage, firing her own weapon back at him as she set hyena like creatures on Hawkeye, whom Falcon lifted into the air out of their reach as he rained arrows down on them.
Avengers, Iron Man, and Tony Stark fans swarmed the tower, and the hospital, bringing flowers, cuddly toys, hand drawn cards and pictures wishing Tony well and offering him support. Social media was blowing up as people posted and tweeted their hopes, wishes, and prayers.
Horror stories of things that had been done to people unfortunate enough to end up in those places were rife through Steve’s youth, and still provided material for horror movies in this modern world.
Steve scowled at him darkly, “We were married.” He corrected, “Had been for a number of years.”
“Good morning.” He said, looking his fill at Tony, who was pouring batter into the frying pan,
Steve inhaled sharply looking like he would crumble to pieces, “He didn’t recognise me, didn’t know me at all. I was nothing but a stranger to him, my best friend…and now I’ve left him again.”
“This is insane.” Clint said, getting up from the couch and going to the drinks bar, he ran his fingers over the bottles until he found a tequila and then got a shot glass and some salt from the counter, he poured himself a measure and sprinkle the salt on his hand, licking it off he took the shot and grimaced, “Needs lime.”
*****
He had freedom, something that he thought was a good thing, it seemed like a good thing, he hoped it would be, and maybe, given enough time, he might figure out who he was and just who this Captain America was to him too.
With his throat still raw and head still spinning, Tony staggered from the car and fell to his knees, crawling to the back and popping the trunk where the suitcase armour lay, swiftly he opened and activated it having to bite back a cry of pain as his wrist was jolted.
“Among other things.” Natasha muttered. Fury looked pained, Pierce had been a “Friend” of his, finding out that he was a likely traitor, had been all along, or at least for a very long time, hurt him, both his pride and his heart.
“I’m going to get a few hours sleep before it hits.” Tony said, getting himself comfortable.
“Just because they are enhanced, no other reason?” The host clarified.
“If we can take the readings while you are in REM sleep both in normal REM sleep and when you suffer one of these nightmares, then we can get a more accurate reading and be able to determine if they are natural or supernatural.” Bruce said,
“Mamma?” Zach asked approaching the bed, his Mamma put the tablet down looking startled to see Zach.
He updated his will, Zach would inherit everything at twenty-one, save for some generous bequests to Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, and the Maria Stark relief foundation.
Harley was beside himself over the new workshop that Tony provided for him along with a Potato Gun Mark II that could store additional ammo so Harley would not be without a weapon once he had launched one spud.
“Rose Hill!” An unimpressed voice shouted.
“Palladium…you were dying?”
Curien swallowed hard and wet his lips. It was guaranteed protection, he knew the avengers wouldn’t go that far for him, not after what he’d done, but it was more protection than just a new identity and location which Ross could easily find.
“Can we try and seen some tonight?”
“You’ve beaten your addiction, you’ve been dry for over three years haven’t you?”
“No, I absailed sixty floors, I’m going to have to climb sixty floors to get back into my room.” Peter said really not looking forward to doing that.
“You look beautiful all flushed and sated.” He growled and Tony laughed helplessly, feeling rather like a boneless fish.
“I don’t know.” Tony said, he sounded exhausted, he was exhausted, the emotional trauma and the fight had taken all the energy from him, he was staying on his feet through sheer force of will.
A river of it had spread under his body in Sokovia, pooling beneath him and spreading out as he’d lain prone on the ground, unable to move or even to draw enough air to cry out.
His stomach was churning, acid heartburn had been plaguing him for days. He felt bloated and fatigued, his back was aching, and all he wanted to do was burry himself in his bed covers and sleep until he felt better.
“Our first team portrait, it’s it great?” Tony said holding it up for the others to see.
Tony looked up with a grin, “Well I do try to impress!”
Tony paused and looked at him with a frown, “D’you want to?”
“Can you repair it?” Steve asked.
“So you’re a whore, what else?” Natasha snarled, grabbing the back of his collar and twisting the material so it was cutting into Slattery’s throat.
Natasha however had her narrowed eyes focused on Tony, “What did you say about Hydra?” she asked recognizing the name.
Just as unspoken of were the back street abortionists, Omegas and Beta Women, already unable to feed the offspring they had sort these people out, desperate to put an end to yet another pregnancy, knowing that there was just no way they could cope with another mouth to feed.
“Well I’m going for another swim.” Clint declared, “Nat?”
“Uh, TMI Birdbrain.” Tony protested, he tugged on his cuffs, “Are we doing something here or were you dumbasses just looking for some strange house ornaments?” His humour dried up when Maya Hanson came down into the dungeon.
“So long as it has some effect.” Steve said, “And no more kids get bullied.”
“The howlies.” Steve said with a smile, “Peggy Carter. They accepted me for me, just Steve Rogers. They weren’t interested in the enhancement beyond what I could do in the field, when we were in the base they gave me as much shit as they did each-other, played pranks, cheated me at cards, just treated me as any other man.” His smile broadened, “They for me were what Ned and MJ are for you. Those two are for keeps. They aren’t the sort that are going to judge you for making mistakes, or treat you badly because you are different.”
“Of course.” Strange said, opening another portal which took Tony to Pepper.
“Now get your feathered ass into a shower and get yourself dressed in that gorgeous Armani suit Tony bought for you.” Natasha ordered him.
“The party.” Tony said heading for the War machine armour, “I don’t wanna do it. I want to be with my family, the people I love, not some spoiled asshole looking to get wasted on my dime.” Breathing deeply to try and fight the nausea he was feeling, Tony gave the War Machine face plate and pat, “You know, I’m in the mood for Lord of the Rings, and in the spirit of Hobbit culture, I’m going to give away gifts instead of receiving them.” He turned with a bright grin and beckoned Rhodey over, “My gift to you. War Machine.”
New York
“And that is why Pepper forbade you from make the decision.” Natasha said.
“No.” Peter whispered swaying dangerously as the Doctor stood up, he tried to coordinate his limbs, tried to stop the guards from taking hold of him, but everything was becoming fuzzy and he was so tired…. “Mmm’sorry Mamma.” He slurred as he was roughly dropped onto a gurney and strapped down, “So sorry.”
Steve ejaculate three times before he knotted Tony and the Omega finally came, tears shimmering on his cheeks and sparkling in his eyes, his face flushed and body quivering as the first wave of heat passed. The two traded a few kisses and lay quietly in each-others arms waiting for Steve’s knot to deflate so he could move and eat while Tony slept until the next bout arrived.
“We have to come back here again.” Peter declared around a mouthful of fresh trout later that evening, “We can bring fishing equipment next time and rope and stuff so we can make a sturdier raft.”
“I’ll help him dispose of your body.” Natasha said her voice devoid of any emotion as she stared at Killian, “Acid should do the trick, right Clint?”
Not far away was Thor, his skull beaten in and his brains spilling out across the ground, Mjolnir laying near his side, just out of reach of his lifeless fingers.
“I was, now I’m here, saving your sorry behind again.” Rhodey drawled sliding the face plate back up. “Good to see you Tony.”
Strucker doubted that the weapon had even been legitimate Stark Tech since it had failed to go off, and there were plenty of fakes sold on the black market to those who couldn't afford the prices of going through legitimate channels. The Bomb might have been old Howard Stark technology, there were still plenty of his weapons floating around in the world, being bought and sold by black market arms dealers. Either way it didn't matter to Strucker and he did not correct their belief that Tony Stark had killed their parents, in fact he encouraged it, fuelling their hatred for Stark and implanting a hatred for the Avengers within them.
“It is Sir.” Jarvis said. “I am uncertain as to how I can help him, but perhaps you can.”
“Shame it wasn’t your tongue, we’d have some peace and quiet then.”
“May I take your drinks order?” The waitress asked,
Natasha’s eye twitched, “I mean Shield. We’re not all bad.” She her tongue as Tony exploded in laughter at that statement.
Taking pity on him, Tony agreed that Zach could come in the shower with him, Zach could do with a hair wash anyway so it would kill two birds with one stone.
“Slash, fanfic?” Steve asked confused.
“Oh my God!” Grace cried in horror as Zach sped across the garden laughing gleefully, nearly tipping off as he was turned left and sent zooming towards the house then almost sent head first into the wall as the breaks were hit, then he came backwards, his legs nearly going over his head as the breaks were hit again and finally he zoomed towards the adults, Peter managing to break just in time or he’d have crashing into their shins.
So why did he feel attached to this Captain and why did he remember that?
Steve’s shoulder made short work of the door and he burst into the bathroom, Bruce, and May behind him, looking concerned.
“I’m sorry.” Tony said, “I’m so, so sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you, if I’d had any choice in the matter I wouldn’t have done that. But if that missile had exploded then I would have been dead anyway, and so would you, and Happy, Zach, and God knows how many others. It was a Nuke, Pete, the idiots sent a nuke and it would have destroyed the whole of New York and irradiated the East Coast. The deaths would have been in the millions. I couldn’t let that happen.”
They settled onto the boat, getting the Captain’s cabin to themselves and their pick of the ships supplies, Pietro grew bored after the first day and began to help the crew with their daily chores while Wanda contented herself sunbathing and examining the minds of the crew. She took pleasure in finding their fears and exploiting them in dreams, taking care not to push them too far, they didn’t need any suicides to slow the journey down.
That was Steve’s voice, Steve was with him. Tony tried to move again, tried to make his body work but he was growing weaker by the moment, all he could do was try weakly grip at Steve’s fingers and try to apologise to him for doing this, for leaving him and the boys in this way.
“Yeah I know, I guess that sort of thing was kept more private in my day.” Steve said thinking of the past and of conversations regarding sex back then. People had talked, Alpha’s and Male Beta’s like to brag about their conquests, but only with one another and only in hushed tones over a few pints of cheap beer, never out loud in front of Omega’s and Female Beta’s.
“They are.” Fury said, he glanced at Tony, “Your suggestions for the engines have sped up making them operational.”
Steve and Bruce having a pancake flipping contest with several pancakes ending up stuck on the ceiling made it onto film, as did on of the pancakes coming unstuck and falling straight down onto Clint’s head!
Steve and Thor ran to where Hulk had landed finding the Iron Man laying prone on the ground, Steve tore the face plate off revealing Tony’s lifeless face.
“Are you lost miss?” The police officer on the door asked, his eyes fixed on her cleavage and not her face.
“Mamma!” Peter protested his cheeks flushing at the nickname.
Steve’s eyes burned with the need to cry; but, at his feet Zach was starting to whimper and let out the first choked sounds of what was bound to become a crying fit. Steve blinked back the tears and pulled himself together, this was no time for him to break down and start sobbing; he had two children depending on him right now, children he’d been entrusted with and he would be damned before he’d let them down.
Tony ignored him, telling Jarvis to save the power for the turn up to the portal.
“We have to stop them.” Ned hissed to MJ, not looking thrilled at the prospect of trying to break the fight up.
Ned looked down at his feet, “I’m sorry.” He whispered.
“You need to keep that opinion to yourself,” Natasha cautioned him, “You don’t have to like it, but do not speak openly against homosexuality. It will only bite you in the ass in the long run.”
The team that Tony had described did not sound like the dysfunctional family that he had known in his world. Family really had been the best way to describe them. Tony had been equal parts the Mum and eccentric Uncle, depending on his mood and the amount of sleep he’d had.
While she did not believe that the two of them had acted upon it, she could see the way they interacted with each other, the way they looked at each other. The sexual tension was thick enough to cut with a knife in those photos. They were all but devouring each other with their eyes!
“Honestly, I’m not sure.” Steve admitted.
“Where are you going?” Peter asked getting plates and cutlery for the table.
Steve wasn’t sure which terrified him more.
Steve only just resisted putting his fist through the hotel TV screen, since Tony had awoken, he and the boys were staying in a suite at the hotel nearest the hospital, as were the rest of the team, save for which ever pair had quinjet duty. They were rotating that between them so that everyone got to sleep in a real bed and didn’t get over tired of bunking in the jet.
“Can I go, please say I can go, please, please, PLEASE!” Zach yelled bouncing up and down in his excitement.
"I shouldn't have let him go on that school trip." Tony said in a dull monotone, "I should have kept him home."
*****
“I know you will.” Tony said, “I would trust you with them otherwise.”
Tony gave Pete a little more leeway in schooling, he’d wanted Pete to go to the same school as his friends so his life wouldn’t be any more disrupted than it had been by his Uncle and Aunt’s deaths. Plus, Happy had given Pete some basic self defence lessons, and Pete carried with him a custom made alarm that not only screeched 130 decibels, it also sent an emergency alert to Jarvis with a GPS, so Tony could act in seconds if anything ever happened to him.
“I see you have noticed Sir’s change in behaviour.” Jarvis pointed out as he drew Steve out into the corridor so speak quietly while Tony spoke with Zach and Peter, helping them both get on with some school work that had been emailed to them.
*****
“Eh, what’s money but boring pieces of paper. What d’you say, Munchkin? Wanna move back to the East coast?”
Depression.
Tony shook his head at the Beta, “You’re tip-toeing big feller, you need to strut.”
Injury. Hospital.
“Get him something.” Fury said to Sharon who looked like she was about to protest but as Fury glared she went to do as she was told with only a little muttering under her breath.
“Smart or not, it still wasn’t your fault.” Steve said, “You did nothing wrong, so don’t blame yourself, and you are doing a wonderful job with Peter, he clearly adores you and little Zach.”
Wrapping his webbing on the rim of the skylight, Peter lowered himself down into the lab and turned on his adventure cam so he could film what he was seeing.
“No, Morgan Hannah works better.” Steve said, he unfolded one of his arms from behind his head and reached down to play with Tony’s hair, “How about you, which do you want, a boy or a girl?”
Zach also promised to draw a picture of himself in costume for Peter the following day and gave him an extra long hug before going to bed.
“That won’t be my name.” Peter said hoping it would not become a nickname but had a horrid feeling it would.”
Steve marched down to the lab, for once ignoring the bots who greeted him with enthusiastic beeps and went straight into the bathroom and opened the cabinet in there. There was the usual stock of plasters, disinfectant, bandages, and some painkillers, but also a box containing prefilled syringes.
He met Steve's gaze, and he smiled innocently and said, "Love you, babe."
Still, he also didn't want to spoil his children, and so he straightened his spine a little and added, "But if we're not careful, she's going to end up completely spoiled with—"
Steve didn't waver. "But you tried to take his gelato."
God, one of them could be as creepy as the other sometimes. If there really
try being told by some crazy witch from space that you're pregnant and you can't get rid of it without killing yourself."
Steve just blinked and thought about asking Tony what that was, but Tony was gone into the foyer by that point and making headway up the stairs, so Steve just pushed himself to his feet and gazed around at the clutter of paper and toys.
It wasn't his childhood crush coming back to him. It was something more — something he felt in his bones, something that electrified his nerves. It was almost like being with the Cap and being around the Cap gave him new life, renewed his energy, made him see things in a different light. Yes, he had thought about the Cap going down on him, but he'd also given a great deal of thought to doing the same for the Cap, and just the idea — just the very idea — that there existed a universe in this crazy plane of existence that something like that could even have happened…
"Fifteen seconds. You're wasting your time."
She looked up at him, and Tony met her gaze. Her lips parted just the slightest, her resolve fumbling for a moment before steely determination slipped back over her visage, one perfectly- sculpted eyebrow raising as she gave him a look like he was worrying over nothing.
Steve's face went a little hard at that. "Tony.
like this had ever happened to him.
Tony stared at him a moment, and Steve shrugged like it was no big deal to him, but Tony knew he was full of shit because Steve was an old-fashioned sap with a romantic streak, and Steve had been romanticizing dancing from the moment he'd realized his dick was more than something to just piss and play with. The height of romance for Steve was dancing with his best fella, and so Tony inhaled a deep breath through his nose and said, "Yeah, all right.
"Yeah? Then what are you doing here?"
"No, the kind that can't stop flirting with each other for two seconds."
And to drive his point home, he snapped his fingers loud and theatrically before sitting back in his chair once more.
"More about your relationship with Nat than I ever wanted to know."
to be obvious, they'd been even more obvious than they might have been regardless?
Barnes just turned to Steve in confusion, like Tony had started to speak a completely foreign language, and Steve did nothing but hand a paper napkin over to Tony.
Steve stroked his fingers over the baby's head a few more times then reached up and kissed Tony's cheek. "You're amazing," he murmured. "I could never do this."
Tony hummed in thought then said, "Prevailing theory is it's rooted in that, but that's not what it means nowadays, no. And I
Only because of the burgers. Not because there was a part of him that thought…
"It's… It's not a
"You said it was my choice, and you said you'd support me no matter what I chose, right?"
do this forever, and yet, his pride wouldn't let him accept anything else for himself. Yes, he was married to Tony, and what was Tony's was now his, but Steve Rogers was a man of principle and honor and had grown up in an era when pride was everything. Steve's pride would never let him be a kept man no matter how much Tony was ready, willing, and able to provide for Steve's every need, whim, and desire for the rest of their lives.
Tony stood there, meeting the gaze of the lost soul that
Where Steve and Barnes sat, the kitchen looking like a bomb had gone off and the two of them digging through what looked like bags from McDonald's.
Only now was he able to sit back and think about it — regret the fact that Steve hadn't been there with him. Steve hadn't been the one to see him through it. Steve hadn't been the one to look… down there…when he was pushing his child out of him. He was thankful he'd had someone there with him — someone to help him through it — and he was thankful that Barnes and Natasha hadn't both run screaming the other way when it had all gone down but had stood there beside him and held him and told him how well he was doing—
," Steve muttered, scoffing at the word. "Can she be reasoned with? If we talk to her, can we reason with her?"
"Is it bad?"
"Yeah, well, look, it was your first romance, and who knows what they're doing at that age, you know? It's fine. Water under the bridge. No big deal."
"Pretty much."
what they say."
Steve frowned at her. "What?"
Tony snorted a laugh. "You don't say?" he mused, and the guy dug his fingers into Tony's hips almost like he was trying to claim him. He gasped out a breath and put his hands to either of the guy's shoulders and said, "Yeah, I don't think so, buddy," and tried to push him off.
"You're doing well, Tony," Natasha said and somehow reached her hand up from where her arm rested supportively against his back to pull damp hair back away from his face. "You're doing so well. Just a couple more pushes, OK?"
Tony grinned and went back over to his workstation, and he put the apparatus back on and dimmed the lights to pull up the interface and said, "OK, let's go freak the others out."
"Conceivably?" he asked and arched an eyebrow.
far from the worst thing. And it's definitely… It's been kind of interesting discovering a completely different side of myself that I didn't even realize was there, but I'm kind of digging now. Plus, and I probably shouldn't say this to complete strangers, but let's just say I'm married to a man that loves me and is
— conducted secret little group-chats without them, Barnes looked over the tablet that was currently displaying Tony's 'artist's rendering' of the cake he'd ordered for Steve from that bakery in Brooklyn that had done their previous cakes, raising an eyebrow at it before he said, "Are you really doing what I think you're doing with that cake?"
He just hugged her, tight, squeezing his eyes shut and letting the tears slide down, and she hummed a tune and rocked him back and forth then patted his back and said, "OK, come on. Lay down on that bed and take a nap. You need one."
By the time Tony got Olivia back up to the penthouse, she'd fallen asleep again, and with her head on his shoulder, he carried her into the living area and looked around with a sigh. He wasn't sure he could handle letting her sleep up in his bed. That was a little too… The corpse of his relationship with Pepper was still kind of fresh, and that almost felt like dancing on its grave. But he suddenly wasn't comfortable with letting her out of his sight, so he set her down on the couch again, her head resting upon the pillow he had tucked beneath her earlier, and draped the blanket over her once more.
Steve exhaled what Tony took to be a relieved breath, but Tony said, "That's good, right? That means she's good."
Steve — deserves this more than anyone I know. And that he and you are, technically, the same person…"
He groaned out a moan as Steve hit a particularly pleasurable spot, Steve's hands on him as they found their rhythm, and Tony leaned back into Steve and reached and arm back to hold Steve by the back of his head, to hold him close, to feel his mouth, his hands, his everything on him.
Steve just inhaled a breath through his nose before he said, "I hear 'sucks' used a lot — I guess to mean something bad? Doesn't sound like it has anything to do with 'sucker.'"
"No, it's fine, I get it—"
"Yeah, but…we have them. Like in that— Like whatever I saw," he said, and Tony watched as he swallowed like he was on the edge of allowing himself to accept whatever he'd so desperately wanted in the past as fact. And then, like he'd found a hole in the story, he added, "We don't have a house upstate."
went back to the way it was supposed to be because, as it turns out, I kind of got, er— OK, look, this probably isn't the sort of thing you want to hear, us having the history we do with each other, but let's just say my current paramour and I maybe kind of experimented with, uh, traditional, male-female missionary style sex — and other positions as well! God, we're old, but we're not that lame — and, um…it turns out I was a
— voiced the quiet 'no' that was threatening to bubble to the surface, but instead, he rolled his eyes and said, "Uh, have you
Steve just raised an eyebrow at him, tossing the towel aside and then gently massaging the ache out of Tony’s arms. “She’s teething. She’s miserable.” He grimaced a little at his own ache that was now going to have to wait and heaved out a breath. “I think there’s a teething ring in the freezer.”
Steve's eyes hardened and narrowed at that. "Yeah. There is."
"Not particularly, I don't think." But he leveled him with a pointed look and said, "You can think I'm a useless relic. That's your prerogative, and honestly, you might not be entirely wrong—"
"How are you—?"
“Tony! Oh my God, you’re finally awake. How are you feeling? What can I do? Let me go get a doctor!” Steve moved to rush out of the room.
“Tony- ahem- Tony, can I kiss you?” and there were no words to describe how Tony felt at the words Steve had said.
“Come lie down again. You’re sore, and you shouldn’t be on your feet.” Steve pulled back the blankets on the bed and made a space that looked too inviting to turn down.
“Yeah, uh, I learned on this beat-up old piano when I was a kid. I couldn’t do a lot because of the asthma, but I could play the piano. This is so much better than the one I had, though. It’s beautiful,” Steve tried to move on from the topic of his childhood. It wasn’t something that he likes to think about often.
“You should try and get some more sleep. Nothing else we can do.” Steve finished his bottle of water and sat on the couch.
That was quite the statement. Tony wasn’t sure how to feel about it, so instead, he took a moment to really look at Steve.
“Sir is just gathering a few items from his bedroom; I am sure that he would not mind if you met him there,” Jarvis told Steve.
“How long have you known?” Tony tried to pull back at that, going to deny it, but Steve’s arms tightened, keeping him where he was.
“Close your eyes, doll. It’s ok.” Tony heard and then felt a gentle hand rest on his head and nudge it to rest on Steve’s chest, just below the shoulder. The hand slowly made its way down his neck and resting on his arm, rubbing up and down it. The movement was soothing that Tony didn’t even question the position he had found himself in, just letting himself be in the moment.
“Tony, we gotta slow down. You’re still hurting, and if we keep going…” Steve bit his lip and looked Tony up and down. “Let’s just say that I have plans for us.”
“Steve, I fell for you too, and I was just content to stay friends, but I think we are past that now, aren’t we?”
When he plays the last chord written on the sheet music, Steve looks over at Tony. He finds Tony sitting quite still, eyes closed, with a small smile gracing his face and a single tear rolling down his cheek. They sit in silence for a few moments, neither one wanting to break the magic that has been created. However, after a while, Tony clears his throat.
“Anything. Something that will make me continue to fall wildly in love with you.” Tony batted his eyelashes while Steve rolled his eyes.
“We’ll be good here for the night as long as you’re OK. You are OK, right?” Steve moved closer to Tony; their thighs pressed together.
“I am unfortunately unable to do so. As of right now, you have a temperature of 101.8 and it looks to be still climbing. Coupled with your other symptoms of headache and nausea, I would say that you have the flu.” The information Jarvis was giving him wasn’t surprising at all given how he was feeling.

“Right, ok. You’re right. Who knows when the team is going to be able to get out here. I think I saw a structure back before we got hit, so if we walk back the way we came, we should be able to find it. A couple of miles out, I think,”  Steve said, turning in the direction of the crash.
Tony drank about half of the glass of water before he could feel his stomach getting upset again. He was able to breath through it until the feeling went away. Not wanting to risk it, he put the glass down and laid back on the bed. He closed his eyes and let his mind drift.
“Um, I don’t know wha-” Tony started to question but Steve stopped his train of thought.
There was no mistaking it. Everyone knew how this worked. You say the full name of a person, feel the tingles and your mark fills in with colour.
“I’m happy to fill in, help you practice some more, not that you need.” After Tony spoke, Steve cleared his throat and looked away.
As the movie’s first scene starts to play, Tony finds himself settling in next to Steve. He could feel the heat of Steve along his side, and the comfort of having another person so close to him was doing wonders for calming his mind. With the people’s soft sounds on the screen talking and the warmth rolling off Steve, Tony soon found that his eyes were struggling to stay open. Each time he blinked, it was a struggle to remember to open them.
“Right, well enough of that. Stop paying attention to me and pay attention to your adoring fans. I’m sure some people would die for a dance with you.” Tony was just trying to end the conversation so he could get back to sulking.
Tony must have snuck in when he was playing, and Steve didn’t hear him. He was sitting on the couch in one of Steve’s sweaters, which was even oversized on him, and a pair of sweatpants. He looked so comfy, which stood out against the modern backdrop.
“Plans? Ever the boy scout, aren’t you?” Tony teased, trying to release some of the tension that had built around them.
The concern on Steve’s face would have been touching if that feeling didn’t scare the hell out of him.
“I can walk! I’m a strong independent Iron Man.” Tony heard Steve huff slightly in what sounded like an attempt to stifle a laugh.
“I’m not going to let you talk your way out of this one. You had no reaction when I said your name, which means that you already knew.” His tone was uneasy, like he was afraid of the answer.
He hadn’t been alone, though. Someone was with him. Who was with him?
Steve pulled the bench away from the keys and sat down. He sat his hand on top of the keys and hit foot over the pedal, and began to play.
Oh. That was something new. Tony felt like a teenager, a giggle trying to break out of him, which he promptly shut down.  He let himself be pulled out onto the dance floor, not fully comprehending what was happening.
His fingers flowed over the keys like it hadn’t been years since he had played. The muscle memory was taking over and guiding his hands in a way that surprises him. The soft, muted melody flowed out of the piano, and he closed his eyes and let the music wash over him.
"I figured as much," Cap said. "I'm sorry. About what happened to your parents. No one deserves to die like that."
"OK."
that came with him as well — as though Steve's place was with this man wherever that might be. His mind again postulated that perhaps this wasn't some nefarious Hydra plot after all. Maybe Tony was telling the truth. Maybe he had somehow woken up in the future, and future-him was married to Tony and they had a daughter and a house upstate. How he'd even got to the future was anyone's guess, but would it really be the weirdest thing he'd ever seen? It could happen. It wasn't just that he
"There's no way he survived that," Barnes said with a shake of his head. "Not even Steve could have survived that. I know he's— Look, I know Steve's stubborn.
That stopped Steve cold.
Steve didn't even blink.
Steve just swallowed and nodded, pursing his lips and blinking as he did so. Then he shrugged a little and added a simple and factual, "Who was me."
"Yeah," Tony said with a bit of a sigh. "I guess I am. Like I said, it's not like I have any insecurities about this at all, so please, let's continue talking about it."
"Within reason," Tony countered.
surviving by leeching off of me."
Tony just glanced up at Steve and said, "These are pornographic."
"Yeah? I don't see you popping one of these out and letting it latch onto your tit. Incidentally, if you do, get the drugs. Holy shit, get the drugs."
"What?
Barnes grimaced. Tony would go so far as to say he wasn't convinced Tony's 'surprise' would be a good thing. "What kind of a surprise?" he asked, not even trying to hide his hesitance or unease.
He pushed his chair back and struggled to his feet, but Steve snagged his wrist and pulled him back before he could get two steps away from the table.
"It means," Jim said, and Steve turned to him, "that they're fighting over your kid like a couple of toddlers fighting over...whatever the cool, new toy of the season is."
"You know," he said as he cleaned her off, her eyes closed and her head turned to the side, "you're going to be doing this for me someday. Me and Papa, actually. I promise I'll try to make it easy for you. I make no promises about him."
Tony wasn't turning back into a man any time soon.
Steve gave him a lopsided smile and drawled out, "I don't think you do."
" Happy asked.
"Doctor Bann— uh,
"Honey, you've got to give him time. He's not going to snap back to his old self overnight. Hell, he might never snap back to his old self."
"What?" Tony asked and cut into a bagel.
"That sounds like a
"It was the Audi, I know it was," Steve said like he was more talking to himself again rather than Tony. "The car we took to…Starbucks, I think it was. And then to the Chinese restaurant later that evening — Spring Palace, I think it was called."
Not something he needed to mention to Steve, though, as Steve wouldn't take well to it, and as they approached their destination, men running, arrows flying, lightning flashing, Wilson…doing whatever it was he did, Steve yelled to him, "Is he in there?"
He swirled his diabetes-inducing concoction with one of the cheap flatware spoons that had been folded into a paper napkin, and Steve folded his arms on the table and said, "You're more sensitive than you like to admit."
"Ready as I'll ever be, I guess. I mean, I've been doing this shit my entire life. You think I'd be used to it."
He smiled a little at that, and against his better judgment, Steve found himself cracking a smile in response. He didn't know why. Something about Tony brought it out of him.
Hill reached out and patted his shoulder. "I'll explain later," she said and motioned him toward the door. "Come on. Nat's out there by herself."
"What, Steve? What's wrong? You did it right.
Wanted to mark. Had marked.
Steve and Tony exchanged glances before Tony just scowled and Steve shook his head gently. "No," Steve replied. "We don't see a need to."
," he snapped under his breath. "Whoever it is is following us."
"Together," he muttered.
"What are you so afraid of? Why are you so afraid that this could be what you've wanted—"
"He'll also think you've lost your damned mind bringing Stark along," Barton said. Steve just scoffed and rolled his eyes. "No, he won't."
But then he thought of a little ball of fire with big, dark eyes and long, blonde hair and an outsized attitude for such a small body. He hadn't thought of her in so long — hadn't let himself think of her in so long, a brief snippet of a thought at the doctor's office the other day aside — that little girl that had come into his life for a handful of time and had changed him, for better or for worse. The little girl that had looked at him like the sun rose and set with him, like he was her entire world, like he could do no wrong. Papa. Her
And she'd loved him.
opportune moment? Maybe when the right chime was sounded? Maybe when the right series of words was whispered? Maybe Barnes himself didn't even know? Maybe Barnes himself was laboring under the delusion that he was safe, that he'd been freed from Hydra's clutches only to have actually had his agency and his humanity stripped from him long ago without him knowing it?
But he couldn't stop the tears, and instead, he let them flow freely as he rubbed his belly — an action that made his libido sing when Steve did it but he was beginning to find merely gave comfort when he himself did it. He cried, and he lay down on the couch and curled up on himself and pressed his face into the pillow, soaking it with tears of remorse and tears of worry.
Tony stared at him a moment, seemingly perplexed that Bucky would even have to ask that question, before he huffed out a breath and shook his head and said, "You people are ridiculous. No, it's not something weird. For god's sake, I have standards."
Hill smiled like she was trying not to laugh. "I'd think the 'man with the plan' would want to know so he could plan accordingly."
"The bad one you were in."
"Please don't use that sort of crass terminology in front of my impressionable daughter," Tony said as the rest of the gang piled onto the elevator, Thor, for whatever reason, bringing Mjölnir along.
Tony's concentration was on the raw cookie dough he was rolling out, carefully adding flour when needed but not too much so as to spoil the recipe. His hair was a little mussed and his face a little flushed from the heat of the kitchen and the exertion, dough and flour covering his hands and a determined concentration on his face as he rolled out the dough to a thin enough consistency. Steve was sure he could have stood there for five minutes unnoticed, but Olivia had been, for all intents and purposes, a noise box ever since she'd realized she could make noises, and she squealed and babbled and smacked a hand against Steve's face, and as Steve jerked his head back in slight surprised from the smack, Tony looked up, a disgruntled twist to his lips.
Steve was silent again, and there was some stupid, fucking Olivia Newton-John song playing quietly on the radio. Tony went to change the station, but Steve started talking again before he could, and the thought went right out of his head.
Steve considered this for a moment, fork poised to dig into a container of pork fried rice. "My ma wouldn't know what to do with herself."
Rhodey sighed out a breath. "Well, whatever, man. Just don't tell Pepper about this, all right? It's not something she needs to— What? What's that face? What's that look for?"
Steve had a strong personality, sure, and he could be tough and stubborn and uncompromisingly opinionated, but he was also a softie and a huge dork with a wickedly dry sense of humor. And more than that, Tony felt
"Yeah! I mean, what, I'm not attractive enough?"
Thor had left immediately after their conversation to seek out the Goddess Esmeralda or whatever the hell she called herself, and the excitement of the day had left Tony drained of all his resources. He'd tried to make his way down to his lab, but Steve had steered him in the direction of the bedroom, insisting he take a hot shower and try to settle down. Tony asked if Steve wanted to join him, practically leering as he did so — even if he actually didn't really feel like doing anything like that at the moment, it was always nice getting soapy and wet with Steve — but Steve looked like he was about to be sick at the very thought of it, and Tony…
Even if he had to seduce the prince to do so.
"No," Cap said, but Tony could tell his thoughts were still somewhere else, "just, uh, thinking about a dream I had once. I think it was a dream, anyway. It's not anything… Um… You mind if I ask you a question?"
She left with a smile and closed the door behind her, and Tony stared after the door for a good, long minute before he said, "
"—so you can't really
"Yes, Steve, I know I've got a gorgeous set of tits. You can look at them later. Anyway —
"Uh, why not? What else am I supposed to call him?"
"What, why?" Tony snapped, not in the mood for Steve's fucking rationality at the moment, and it wasn't until Steve rolled his eyes that Tony remembered they had an audience—
Tony opened his mouth to reply in the affirmative when Wilson said, "Aw,
Steve turned, wide-eyed as though he'd been caught doing something he shouldn't have. He tried to cover it up and harden his face to blank passivity, but the damage had been done. Tony, standing beside him with two steaming cups of coffee in his hands, frowned and said, "What's wrong?"
Sam gave a little shrug. "I mean that you've spent the past how many years trying to convince yourself that you did the right thing. I've seen people have to talk themselves into and out of stuff before, but you? You put them to shame. You loved him. You were happy with him. He was happy with you. He loved you. He would have done anything for you. Ask anyone. They'll agree with me. The fact that it's been how many years and we're still rehashing the same shit?"
He sighed and flipped to the next section of papers and groaned when he saw it was
"Tony?" came the muffled voice from the other side of the door.
Steve sighed and turned away from his magazine to look at the sheet. He was quiet only a moment before he said, "Roger Stevens. July four, nineteen seventy-six."
Tony nodded and said, "OK, J, we're ready— But don't send it 'til I get back here with the tablet. I'm thinking this is something Steve and I want to find out together."
I am and the man that murdered his husband's parents, he chooses the murderer."
"Well, clearly aliens aren't the only things that come out of wormholes," he said and got up from his seat, deliberately pushing the idea of a wormhole to the back of his mind. "Evidently, future or alternate universe children also fall out of them, too. Probably alternate universe."
"They look fantastic, El," he said and nodded around at the various prints that lined the gallery. "I think you'll get a big turnout for this."
"Oh, isn't that sweet," Tony said and snatched the box out of Steve's hand. "You're already going in on gifts together."
"You knew what you were getting into," he said, and Tony matched his smile.
"Why?" Bruce asked. "The '65 blackout—"
Steve turned his head some so that he was able to rub his face into Tony's side, and he murmured, "I get that feeling, too."
"—say 'shit' or 'fuck' or 'Jesus Christ, Steve, learn to load the fucking dishwasher' because you know what—"
She pressed her hands together in a triangle shape and then set the shape atop a quarter of the sandwich. "That little."
Tony made a face then said, "I'm sorry, are you not happy for me—"
Tony smirked up at him and said, "You know he meant it as a compliment."
or something."
"Did you really make it?" Barnes asked after a moment.
"Yeah," he said, the word slightly gravelly, "yeah, they're—" He cleared his throat. "I just—" He turned to Tony, and Tony saw the tears had already wet his eyelashes. "How did you even find these?"
— time in his life.
Tony harrumphed a little but didn't make a move to pull away from Steve's embrace, and Steve tightened his arms around his little family just a bit more. God, he loved them. He loved them so much and he didn't know what he would do if he ever lost them.
It was almost like he'd been engineered to appear as the perfect woman. Almost.
Steve froze as the candy bar dropped down into the trough. Shit, shit,
"Touch that to pull up some crap video about Electro the Garbage Man and you can show yourself out of my building."
The baby moved inside of him, almost like he suspected Tony needed the reassurance that he wasn't alone, and through it all, Tony choked out a laugh and loosened his arms some to rub a hand over the swell of his abdomen.
occasions that he'd lowered himself to actually looking stuff up online about his condition, he'd stumbled into a pregnancy forum discussion post where the posters were sharing disheartening stories of completely disinterested partners that were either completely removed from the pregnancy or seemingly put off by it. Not for the first time in his life, Tony thanked his lucky stars for Steve Rogers, eternal boy scout, do-gooder, and worry-wart, who was more interested in and excited by this whole thing than he was. He didn't know how he would have survived this whole thing without Steve there right beside him to pick him up when he stumbled, but then—
Steve was so damned sick of being cold all the time. There was a little girl with wispy blonde hair and brown eyes that had squealed in delight when she'd laid eyes on him and called him 'Daddy.' Steve always hoped, deep down, he would have the chance to have a family of his own.
He handed the fork to Steve, and Steve took it and examined it a moment before he went back to eating.
"Oh," Tony said, more awake than he wanted to be at this time. "You mean at the ass-crack of dawn? Yeah, I don't know if you're aware of this, but I've got the spawn of a super soldier growing inside of me—" he gestured at his abdomen at this, "—and the super soldier spawn seems to have the same gargantuan appetite that the super soldier father has. Honestly, you stick a side of beef in front of me at this very second, I would polish that baby off in twenty minutes tops."
Unfortunately, Bruce didn't want to play along and instead sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose as he said, "
It didn't make sense.
"Look, man, I'm just calling it as I see it. Pepper's great. She's a great girl period. I just don't think she's the one you spend the rest of your life with. I think you two kind of fell into a relationship because you thought you were supposed to. I just think you're better off as friends."
Steve raised an eyebrow at him.
Barnes's face went a little pinched in thought. "Who's JK?"
Bucky shrugged. "Didn't seem important. You'd already made your mind up about what was best for the two of you. He moved on, you moved on, thought it would be the end of the story."
"He doesn't live up to his name?" Tony mused.
"What?
He jumped up from his chair and went over to the toaster, and he jiggered the handle to get it to pop up. The toast wasn't exactly burned, but it was getting there, and he grabbed a fork from the flatware drawer and used it to pull the pieces out without burning his fingers.
Then again, maybe that was the right measurements for this Tony.
And was he really surprised Hill still seemed to have contact with Mad-Eye?
Tony took the last cookie off the sheet to set it on the cooling rack then smacked the spatula down on the counter and muttered, "Fine."
with that gentle demeanor, "why would you think that? It's not about making an honest…
"I know. I'm sorry you couldn't save him. But…aren't they kind of like your children? You made them. They're imbued with your personality and your intelligence and your wisdom."
"Just want you to look your best," she said with an easy smile.
"About four months ago—"
Sam nodded. "That's them."
"That's Ma's handwriting," he said then turned to look at Tony. His eyes had gone a little red in addition to being watery, stubborn droplets clinging to his long eyelashes, and he choked out a laugh as he looked at Tony and said, "You really— You found these for me?"
She eyed Tony as she set Steve's license down to the side of her then began to look over his cards and passport. Only the passport, the license, and the Avengers' card had photos on them, all three photos of a serious-looking Tony Stark that did not quite resemble the woman that was sitting in front of the clerk. She took all the IDs and began to inspect them, glancing between the photos and the Tony sitting in front of her as she did so.
Tony nestled closer to him and rubbed his cheek against Steve's shoulder.
"Well, I'm not sure how comfortable you girls are with sharing that kind of information with each other."
Bruce just stopped in his tracks as he came out of the kitchen with a granola bar in one hand and a mug of tea in the other, and he blinked and looked from Steve to Tony, who was rolling his eyes so hard he almost detached his retinas and said, "I'm knocked up, Steve. I'm not mute."
"How'd you sleep after we, ah…?"
'his' Tony; if 'his' Tony even existed, it was somewhere else in time and space) — had said to him just as he was falling asleep.
Sad-eyed, Steve just leaned in and pressed a kiss to his temple as he put a hand to his back and gave a few soothing rubs.
Tony didn't have to see Steve's face to know it had gone pale. "I— I didn't—"
, but he flushed a little in embarrassment at the mere thought of going into an elevator — where anybody could be — without even a pair of underwear to show for it, and he wrapped the towel back around his waist and tucked the corner in, hoping it would stay as it was at least until they got to the penthouse.
I did wrong. Because everyone leaves me, Steve. Everyone always leaves, but you… I thought you were different. I thought you were for keeps. I thought you would stay. But you left, too, and if you left, then what does that say about me, huh? What's so wrong with me that everyone leaves?"
Bruce snorted another laugh. "Papa has a way with words. And don't say that word, Olivia. It's not nice."
"I didn't say that—"
to happen, but…with you staying like this…we could always have more."
He glanced down at the table he was sitting on, and he thought back several long months before to that infamous battle downtown, the one they'd never fully explained to the public, the one that had ended with him being transformed against his will.
, too. Make it a triple feature."
like what happened to you seventy years ago happens again, I will not rest until you're back where you belong — even if I have to storm the gates of Hell to get you back again."
, Tony," he said, squeezing his eyes shut like that could somehow block out this horrible turn of events. "Could you
"How did you get these photographs?" Tony asked as Other Tony continued to talk about… something.
"Huh?"
Tony waved him off, the motion lazy. "No, not now. But again. Soon."
"Well," he said and swallowed, "my daddy wasn't as…nice as your daddy."
There was something almost new-age-y playing from unseen speakers, and a handful of assorted people were already standing around pointing at photographs and making quiet conversation to one another. There was a thin woman with a dancer's body standing with one pair of guests, her flaxen hair pulled back into a tight bun, and she turned when she sensed more people had arrived and smiled when she spotted Bruce by the entrance to the show. She excused herself from the conversation then made her way over, her clothing sleek but somehow flowy — was she wearing a poncho? No, it wasn't called a 'poncho' in women's fashion. Was it? — and she held her hands out and said, "Bruce! I'm so glad you could make it!"
"About what?"
"What happened?" Steve asked. "How did she—?"
"Blab about what?"
"You spend every other column demanding the government round us up and lock us up in the Raft," Steve said, his voice as sharp-edge as his face was steely.
" he called and ran out of the kitchen. "Olivia, honey, where'd you go?"
"Work."
"Hmm?" he asked, gaze still focused on his computer. "What? Yeah. Definitely a woman." He looked over, his eyes zeroing in on Steve's fully-erect dick, and he sucked in a breath before he said, "Well, if my ass can take it, I'm sure a vagina can, too."
"I didn't say
His better angels overrode him, and he took the olive branch.
The clerk dropped his pen.
"Esmeralda, undo this hex!" Thor bellowed, but she just shrugged.
"I know. He's old," she said like this was something she had heard from someone else and had taken as gospel truth, and Tony assumed it was him — or alternate universe him — when she added, "but we love him."
Steve gave a derisive snort. "All your life? You've got to be at least twenty years older than I am."
bad," Steve said, the words coming out in a slight pout.
The Wurlitzer was playing some doo-wop song as they passed it on their way to the door, and Tony leered at him and said, "Care for a dance?"
"I don't trust him any further than my ninety-pound asthmatic self could throw him."
Because maybe, deep down, he was terrified, too, but he knew he had to be strong for Tony and he wanted to be strong for Tony. Because he loved him, and because he wanted to do right by him.
Steve understands that, but you're not my Steve. Yet."
"That's not true," he said and swiped at another screen. "That's not true. Case in point: Pepper."
," Steve said with a groan, but still put his arms around him to hold him.
"I'm sure you weren't—"
Tony groaned and rubbed his hand over his face. "Yeah, that…"
He reached out and grabbed his phone from the table, though Rhodey just pinched it between his fingers and took it from him. "Uh," he said and turned to his oldest friend. "Who said you could do that?"
no one around for miles."
He nodded but said nothing.
"Whatever," he muttered as the doors finally slid open and he stepped into the car.
"And not only did she pop in from an alternate universe but she showed up from a
Pepper bit her lip as she raked her gaze over Tony's face, but she frowned and said, "I don't know, Tony. I don't know if I can fight an injunction—"
OK, maybe not the first. He was sure there were others that had looked Steve's way before he, for whatever reason, settled for Tony. And he did. Settle. How could it be anything but? He was Captain America, and Tony, as he'd been assured many times over the years, was not.
"Dry remarks and old-timey phrases. Also inducing guilt. You're, like, a pro at that."
Was to be sick.
— go again, and I'd be so full of it, so full it would hurt, and you'd make me hold it, make me keep it inside me, like you were trying to mark me, and you wouldn't let me come, and you— and you—"
"Good. God, you're so good, Antonia. So good. You're so beautiful. I wish you could see yourself here. You look so fucking beautiful. The glow. The sheen of sweat. That look of desperation on your face."
Tony waited a moment — until Wilson had felt it safe to drop his hands and open his eyes — then added, "He's a bit of a biter, too. In fact, he's really into nipple—"
Steve scoffed and sat back in his chair. "Doesn't matter. It was just a joke, anyway. He didn't mean it. He probably wasn't even talking about me. He probably doesn't even remember me."
up here. There's
He opted to say nothing, which seemed to be answer enough for Natasha.
"What?" Tony replied, breezy and light. "A little birdie told me you always wanted to learn how to dance. I just thought maybe—"
"Doesn't mean she'll follow in yours either."
"I mean
"It's…easier to clean up in here."
It was nearly ten minutes gone before he noticed someone familiar making his way over to the table, and he sat up as Steve approached, smiling appreciatively as he saw Steve had chosen to wear (or had been told to wear by Sam) a charcoal-gray suit with a maroon dress shirt and burgundy tie, both of which matched his dress to the point that it looked like they had color- coordinated. After waiting for the kitchen door to swing closed again, Steve took the chair across from Tony and said he was fine with ice water for now when the host offered wine.
So, one by one, the couples went around the room and introduced themselves and their unborn tax exemption (by name — always by name) and told the story of how they'd come to be so blessed to be able to conceive their child. Some had been trying for years, some for months, and then there were the ones that Tony was convinced by their demeanor viewed it as a last-ditch attempt to save a crumbling relationship. Some had done it the old-fashioned way, some had used IVF, and some had even had to use things like thermometers and mucous testers (what in the

to ask me—"
"OK, babe, shoot. What do you want to know?"
"The married-people flirting," Rhodey explained, still happily cradling Olivia in his arms. "It's…really annoying. Like super annoying. Like I'm-going-to-have-to-stop-hanging-out-with-you- because-it's-giving-me-diabetes annoying."
"Do we have any idea where they might be headed next?"
"Oh," Tony muttered. "Yeah, that's you and the brat. Took that the other day when we were trying to bake cookies for the party. Yes, I bake. Shut up. It's awesome, and I'm fucking awesome at it. It's because it's fun; it's not because—"
"It's true. I couldn't. I know I couldn't. God forbid, I lost seventy years of my life again? I couldn't. I couldn't do it. I have so much now I didn't have then — a job, friends,
Tony shook his head. "Nothing. Just…a lot on my mind."
"Yeah? And where are you sleeping then?"
could fix this for him — when the crack of a bullet just grazed past his temple, and he heard the telltale slump and thump of a body hitting the ground behind him, presumably the son-of-a-bitch that had stuck him with the needle.
Tony just raised an eyebrow at her, and she smiled a bit at him. He really didn't have anything against her except the fact that he was ninety-nine percent certain Natasha had tried to set her up with Steve right around the time he and Steve had started dating, and there was still a very small but vocal part of him that couldn't help but wonder if Steve would have been better off in that case. She cleaned up nicely, she was smart, she was tough, she was pretty, she seemed pleasant enough, and she was, as far as he understood it, a damned good agent.
Oh, Tony. You weren't fooling anybody.
He struggled to fall asleep every night because he could never seem to find a comfortable position unless he was lying on his side with a pillow shoved between his legs, and those times he was able to catch a few winks, he drifted off with the naïve hope that he'd wake up the following morning back to his old self. But every morning, he woke up disappointed because he was still a woman, still nauseated, and therefore still pregnant. Well, maybe 'disappointed' wasn't the right word to use. So fucking despondent that there were times he thought about throwing himself off the roof of the Tower and taking every precaution imaginable to make sure JARVIS wouldn't send one of the suits after him.
He might have gotten a little rough with Steve's uniform armor upgrades. He might have shredded the prototype uniform instead of actually repairing it, but whatever. Evidently that version was a piece of shit, so hey, live and learn. And he was so immersed in what he was doing that he didn't bother to listen to JARVIS announce anything or anyone or even note he'd been down there for several hours without a break.
her, anyway? Yeah, OK, she was kind of cute, but she was a rambunctious and opinionated chatterbox with an ego the size of Texas.
"I'd rather they not use you to—"
"Ugh, I'm starting to rethink my life choices," he muttered as Steve brought his other hand around and rested both on either of Tony's hips and began to toy with the straps that connected the bustier to the thigh-high stockings he wore. "Marrying nonagenarians is bad for my health, no matter how fucking hot they look in their service uniforms. I did tell you how fucking

you. Doesn't your kind have a saying about not looking a gift horse in the mouth? Stupid expression, but I think it fits here."
DUM-E beeped and whirred in response, and Barnes looked at Tony, disbelief and perplexity written over his face. Tony just shrugged. "I told you. He likes Steve the best."
Tony just rocked once, twice, in the chair, pushing back gently so as not to disturb the feeding baby or the ache between his legs. Well, evidently Barnes wasn't wasting any time at all in righting the wrong of not telling Steve everything he could about the Winter Soldier. "Uh, not sure. I don't know. Did he happen to say
"Are you asking me or telling me?"
As battles went, it wasn't all that noteworthy. Go in, get the bad guys, get whatever tech they might have, hand them over to the proper authorities, and hop back on the plane for late-night pizza.
Tony sighed and pulled the spoon out of the glass. He stuck the spoon in his mouth to get the few drops that had collected there then said, "You know, I'm really not sure how to take that, to be honest. I mean, I love Steve, and you know how much I love Steve, and not that I'm actively

He liked Peggy. He could even see himself falling for her. He could see himself marrying her and maybe even having a family with her. She was beautiful, she was smart, and she was filled to the brim with moxie. She was everything he told himself he'd ever wanted in a dame— broad —
He let Natasha work at his shoulders a few more minutes before he nodded his head at the TV where the talking heads were debating something they couldn't possibly know the answer to and said, "You know, I really thought Steve would have been back by now. How long has it been?"
, but that didn't mean he couldn't secretly cherish it 'til the end of his days.

"Yeah," he said after a beat. "I guess it does."
He made grabby hands, and Barnes just looked at him and said, "I don't
Steve just nodded, ignoring the 'alien' line as he handed the ring back. Tony slipped it back on his finger.
"She doesn't bite, and she very much enjoys having her daddy scoop her out of her crib."
Natasha shot him a knowing look and said, "Well, it's a good thing I'm not Steve then."
" Tony asked, slightly insulted.
"Is this 'bickering' or 'married people flirting'?"
"Yeah," Bruce chimed in from the back, "they don't really like to do them unless they have to, though."
Tony smiled and leaned into Steve, resting his head against Steve's shoulder, and he felt Steve kiss the top of his head. He stared at the muted TV ahead of them a few minutes, and when what looked to be a serious scene turned yet again into a rape-fest, Tony rolled his eyes and said, "J, I don't care what you put on, but find
Barnes murmured something under his breath in Russian, which got Natasha to snort out a laugh that she attempted to cover up by clearing her throat, and Wilson turned on him and said, "Oh! Oh, no! We discussed this. You talk smack about me, you do it in English!"
"I could choose to be insulted," Tony said, "but instead, I'll take it for the backhanded compliment it is."
"Not really. Doesn't take a genius to figure out the guy probably prefers to take it that way." "But you seem…awfully detailed about it. Like you've definitely thought about it before."
"I know that," he said. "I mean what's with the whole..."
He huffed and rolled his eyes again and said, "Fine. But I'm telling her that letting her starve is all your idea."
"He loves you. Trust me. He loves you."
Anyway, she was clever and aware enough to catch onto it, and yeah, honestly, he and the Cap probably weren't the best actors. They probably couldn't fool a four-year-old that had known only that her entire life. She hadn't raised too much of a stink about things being different since her arrival, but that seemed to be because she placed all of the blame on that 'bad man,' the one that had no doubt had sent her there in the first place. He had taken her toys and her clothes and changed the color of her bedroom because he was mean like that. Something told Tony if there really was such a 'bad man,' his aims weren't as benign as all that, and he thought for a moment that the crazy shit that had happened in that other universe could totally happen here in this one, especially after what had happened with Loki and the Chitauri only a month earlier. But he pushed that to the back of his mind and decided to worry about that later. Right now, he just had to focus on getting her settled and comfortable.
Steve nodded and was quiet a moment before he said, "Uh… Didn't you say there's another one?"
She pointed to his left ring finger. "Your ring. You and Daddy gots matching rings! You always wear that!"
OK, so alternate universe Romanoff was married, and evidently to someone named 'Bucky,' whoever that was. The only 'Bucky' that came to mind was the Cap's old pal from the war, but unless that Bucky somehow either survived the fall from the train or didn't even fall off the train to begin with, that was next to impossible.
"What?" he muttered. "What, big guy? What's wrong?"
" and pointed to the Iron Man.
"It'll be annoying."
Tony hummed again and relaxed further into Steve, only realizing then that Steve was still buried inside of him and was still partially hard.
"So," Barton said, his back to them as he cooked up eggs at the stove, "baby names, huh?"
"No, but—"
"Anything we need to be concerned about?" Steve asked, and it surprised Tony that he hadn't said one word about the coffee.
"But I just gave her—"
in that way. He knew it wasn't about that. But it was about getting back a life he felt had been stolen from him, and letting go of a lesser life he'd been given in return. Because that's all this life could ever be. It was a replacement, and a shitty one at that. It was about getting back to the war and his pals and

…that you two act around each other, and I can tell you right now, Tony, neither one of you is a good enough actor to fake that kind of thing to a kid that takes its very existence in her life for granted. Or what about the sister she claims to have? That she's never going to see again?"
— I'm gonna be a dad."
Tony snorted a laugh. "Well, now I know you're lying."

Tony gauged him a moment, looking him over and judging whether or not it was worth keeping him out in the field — yeah, his tower had turned into a 'field' whether he liked it or not — where some asshole Hydra agent might try something to bring out the Winter Soldier, but satisfied in knowing that the easiest means of doing that was, as far as they knew, last seen in Siberia was good enough for him.
New Yorkers cared about something like this, because he and Steve and Bruce all went over together, and from the safety of his dark-tinted sunglasses, Tony could stare point-blank at anyone he thought was staring at them a little too long.

"A shower?"
"I also wouldn't call him more fun than a barrel full of monkeys," Sam replied.
He watched the doors close before he turned back to Esmeralda, who was eyeing her surroundings with interest, and she threw a glance at Steve and said, "A gift from your bonded?"
"Yeah? The hell you don't."
"I'm the one taking your best pal away from you."
. His old pal,
Barnes was once again as uneasy about this as he was, but there was little choice in the matter. There were no other Avengers there, Hill was busy tending to their hundreds of guests and trying to keep in some kind of contact with the others, Pepper was on the other side of the country, and Steve was, if the media was to be believed, fucking
Tony, to his credit, didn't seem surprised in the least, and he put the Styrofoam cup to his mouth and took a sip before he smiled a little sheepishly and said, "Hi."
He blinked. Oh, good god. Oh, good lord. It wasn't— They weren't— She wasn't—
say he should sell them! So he can give the money to hungry organs."
It was quieter down here, the sounds of the public areas upstairs not even a distant echo. There was the buzz of the overhead lights and the hum of the snack and soda machines, and he exchanged pleasantries with one of the afternoon janitors that had probably been working here since before Steve was born. He went into the lunchroom and stowed his bag in the fridge that hadn't been cleaned out in probably five years or more, and he spotted Bucky's lunch on a shelf with a yellow post-it attached to it reading
"Stop what, peach pit?"
"Something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue?" Bruce asked.
He still wasn't sure if he believed that.
" Happy said from the phone, and while Rhodey turned away and Hill bit her lips to keep from laughing, Tony went over to him and slapped his arm and said, "Figure of speech, big fella. Steve's just afraid I'm going to back out." He stopped cold and pulled back a little. "Why? Is he backing out? Is there someone in there with him to make sure he doesn't run away?"
. Like I said, is it a date if there's no actual date or time or place established?"
Damn, it
Bruce just shot Tony a questioning look, and Tony nodded and said, "Yes, this is what I live with every day of my life."
Steve chuckled, nuzzling against the side of Tony's neck and said, "OK. Sure thing," and positioned Tony for the best angle of access. "Ready?"
in this—"
"But I see it's crossed yours once or twice."
"I can do more than boil stuff," Steve grumbled but still took a seat at the other side of the island.
"Snooze ya lose," Sam replied with a shrug.
"No shit."
it? Which do you like better?"
Tony eyed him over and hummed a little like he was considering the earnestness of Bruce's words before he said, "Whatever," and pushed away from the table, the lightheadedness having abated. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find something to eat before this parasite tries to mutiny or something."
"Freedom."
He groaned and rolled his eyes, and he tossed the arrows that he was working on for Barton onto the table. "Goddamn it, we are not on
for sex. Not because he needed it so desperately. He'd gotten Pepper that needy and desperate once, but he had to admit that her voice had never sounded as wrecked as he knew his own voice had just a second ago when he'd almost choked on the words.
"Isn't that a coincidence?" he muttered then turned back and exhaled a breath. Jesus Christ, he was not in the mood to deal with this. Again. He tried to find his way through the crowd and tried to remember which stupid level of the club their table was on, but he could
"What words?" Natasha asked, gaze focused on the screen, her finger hovering over something on a tablet.
"Because she's a fucking lunatic and thinks Steve and I are soul mates, and she thinks that because we're soul mates, we're supposed to want this. According to Blondie, this is kind of her MO. Nothing really out of the ordinary about it. Pulls this shit all the time, just not normally on humans."
Tony flexed his fingers around the headboard, digging in desperately as he tried to control himself. But he was panting, and Steve was thrusting and stroking, and he couldn't even think straight from the nerve endings that were electrified by his touch. He sucked Steve's fingers, the digits gone ridiculously slick, and he half-expected Steve to pull his fingers away and shove them into his only unfilled opening, but he just kept them there, forcing Tony to suck at them, forcing him to keen and shiver and lurch and twitch and clench with all the feelings of wanton desire that were thrumming through him.
Tony glanced down and saw where his sheer-stockinged foot rested versus where Steve's leg was, and he figured he could probably swing the angle if he needed to. He wasn't sure how his ass would feel about it, but he could still swing the angle if needed. "Yes," he said as Steve continued to stroke his hair.
Though there was still an element of playfulness there, a sliver of something hard and dark and maybe even a touch domineering slipped into the guy's gaze. "Maybe you're just a troublemaker," he said.
. You were like that for a week. There was more than one occasion it could have happened."
by JARVIS," Steve said without looking up from the book.
But he smiled tightly and took the beverage when it was handed to him, and he sipped it and scowled as he burned the tip of his tongue, and it was then that he realized Pepper was staring guardedly at the door, like she was watching after something she didn't trust.
"Steve, are you picturing other me dressed up like this?"
"Really."
"No," he said with an exhale of breath, "but it's a hell of a lot safer than going out on the street and getting nabbed by Hydra or AIM or whoever's got their eye set on world domination this week."
He sat there with the fucking polish and a rag and worked at those damned things for a half-an-hour like he was some old-timey bootblack getting paid for it."
The man snorted a laugh. "I see Barton found his new arrow set. Hope the fucker realizes he's not getting any new ones until after New Year's, so he'd better hope no one tries any shit until the holidays are over."
"All right! OK! I'm jealous. Just please stop talking! That's not an image I need in my mind!"
fallen in love.
Steve let go of the counter, and he put gentle and tender hands at Tony's waist and moved him away so they could better face each other.
Tony nodded at the sonogram picture that now sat on the table. "You might want to put that away before someone sees it."
He stepped into the kitchen, Steve right behind him, and saw all of the others gathered around the island, coffee, bagels, and tablets out as they tried to figure out what was going on. Bruce was sitting off to the side, nursing what was probably a soothing cup of herbal tea but was still evidently listening to the discussion around him. Barton and Wilson were sitting at the island, slathering bagels and discussing possibilities. Thor was interjecting questions, trying to understand exactly what a 'power grid' was and why it was so important. Barnes was just sitting there beside Barton, watching and listening but not saying anything. Hill was seemingly communicating with someone in the Department of Defense while Natasha was just finishing up a call with someone unknown. She turned when she saw that Steve and Tony had finally arrived, and she was all business as she said, "Sorry, I know you two have other things you'd rather be doing at the moment."
"I won't ask how many. I probably don't want to know."
"I forgot how well you know me," he said and squeaked a little as Steve reached up and, Tony's spend on his tongue, crushed their mouths together, forcing his tongue into Tony's mouth and forcing Tony to taste himself more than he could ever hope to get off his fingertip.
Tony glared at him as Steve took a gentle hold of him and pulled him to his feet. “What else would you call it, Steve?” he asked as Steve worked at untying his arms. “She is blocking your cock from being in my mouth.”
get cleaned up so we're not stuck to the sheets come morning?"
Tony groaned and rolled his eyes, throwing his hands up in the air. "Why do I even bother?" he asked the sky. "Why?" He turned his attention back to Steve. "Who the

"I'm not short!" he said and went over to Steve. "I'm five-eight in this body. The average American woman is something like five-four or five-five. I'm
anything. I will fix this."
"Don't say it like that! We don't— It's more than that, isn't it?"
He huffed and sighed and sat back in his chair, and Barton sat down at the table with him and said, "Well, you look very pretty tonight, Stark."
"It's not that," Steve said as he sat back down in his chair and watched the monitors. He flipped through a couple and tried to find the trio, but they seemed to keep stepping out of view just as he hit the right camera. "It's just…it would be weird, all right? Especially after that joke of his from last night."
Tony smiled some, thankful for the distraction Steve's complaint had provided him with. "Why? Come on! It's your birthday!"
That had not gone over well with Tony.
is what you call a suspiciously specific denial."
"All right, look, I just assumed if I ever had a kid — and not that I was thinking of ever having kids — but if I ever did, if I ever had a daughter, I'd name her after my mother."
"What do you mean 'someone'?"
Tony sighed heavily when he saw they weren't in the living room where he'd last left them, and calling out Steve's name got him nothing but silence in return.
"No, baby," he said because he was content to let her believe she was where she truly belonged a little while longer. "We're not. Anyone wants to take us away from him, they're going to have a fight on their hands."
child, a child we made together — in my arms surrounded by all of our family and friends and a ton of crap they all bought for us for the care and wellbeing of our child. Does it look like I give a shit if, by some weird twist of fate, we're both technically too old for the other one? No. Clearly, this is the way it had to happen for us, and honestly, I'm totally OK with that. Now, undo that knot in your stomach that got all tied up the moment you started convincing yourself you're too old for me and go over and grab that nice, big box Pepper and Happy were so kind to bring with them — even if I have a feeling it's actually been sitting somewhere downstairs for the past two months — and bring it over here. I don't know why, but I have a feeling that might be the swing I picked out."
She shrugged. "Nate's younger 'n' me 'n' he lets him play, too."
tight ass. You could bounce a fucking quarter off that thing. Literally. You can bounce a quarter off of it. I've done it."
"What?"
"It's really not that bad," Tony replied. "You get used to it."
"Huh?"
She just grinned. "But there
about starving."
"Are you happy now?" she asked in lieu of answering.
Steve snatched it off the table and stuck it into his shirt pocket.
," Steve said, a warning tone in his voice.
Tony seemed to find what he was looking for, and he set some controller-like thing down on the table and turned his attention back to the toddler that was busy pulling bows off of elegantly- wrapped packages beneath a large evergreen festooned in tiny white lights (what in the world kind of lights were they?), ornaments, and garland that was either silver or gold depending on how the light hit it.
Well, two, to be honest. He had his Avengers family — those people that fate (and Nick Fury) had thrown together in what — if he was using the term correctly — was a 'Hail Mary' pass attempt to save the world. On the surface, they all seemed to have nothing in common, but time spent together — starting with that shawarma Tony had suggested — proved otherwise. Tony had opened the tower to them as a place to stay and a base to work from, and they'd started avenging in earnest — first sanctioned by SHIELD and then as their own entity once SHEILD had...ceased to be. For reasons.
He snagged a cookie from the container on the coffee table and crunched on it then reached down and began to ball up piles of torn paper and ribbons. He wasn't joking when he said this whole thing was a waste. Christmas wrapping paper was expensive. His mother had never wrapped any of his presents in anything but old newspapers. Tony must not have made his fortune himself if he was keen to just throw his money around like that. Probably came from a father or a grandfather — which was odd because Steve couldn't imagine an 'old money' type like that being, well, openly homosexual. Weren't they expected to marry into another wealthy family and produce the next generation of heirs?
"Come on," she said and gave him a tug.
Tony sucked in a breath and settled himself onto the bench. "Sure," he said then grumbled and reached into his pocket. He pulled out that little black cellphone and looked at it, and his lips twitched in amusement at whatever he saw there.
For the first time in his life, Steve decided to be a good soldier. "Right behind you."
Tony jumped up at the offending name. He glared at Steve, got right up in his face, and snapped, "I swear to
And so he clamped his mouth shut and swallowed, nodding his silent acquiescence before he turned to leave, and as he did so, Bruce called out, "Hold on, I'll go with you."
"What happened to him?"
"Pretty much."
"Yeah," Steve said as they came upon the doctor's suite. "I do."
He didn't dignify that with a response; he just typed back,
But Barnes just shook his head a little then turned to Steve and said, "This would be the kind of thing you'd stumble into."
Tony stopped cold, and he watched as the line of Avengers sitting at the island all groaned and murmured various whines of 'Why would you say that?' But Tony turned to Thor and said, "I'm sorry. What was that?"
"Yeah, I'm slowly coming to terms with that, and I'm trying to figure out if that means something."
Cap frowned at him a bit, like he was perplexed. "Thanks?" he said, confused. "I mean your…your parents. They, uh…"
"Thor doesn't really get in on it, but based on things I've heard him say, he's seen you do it. It's usually phrased more elegantly and old-timey than how we describe it."
Thor nodded. "She sensed that our Man of Iron was bonded to another, and I believe she sensed to whom it was. It is why she cast her spell the way she did."
"You hold onto the headboard and nothing else, understand me? You are not allowed to touch yourself. You are not allowed to talk. You are not allowed to moan. You do everything I tell you and nothing else. Do you understand? Say 'Yes, Sir,' if you do."
"Asked if I needed to get my ears checked 'cause I was getting old." He stopped mid-stir and looked point-blank at Rhodey. "Seriously, the brass balls on that little brat!"
She nodded and chewed. "Yeah," she said around a mouthful of bread. "Papa's a good cook."
Tony Stark. Now, give me my license."
"You've
Steve gave him a half-pointed and half-sympathetic look. "Unless you would rather have surgery to…you know…"
"Daddy does," she replied like it was obvious.
"He should probably go to a hospital," Bruce said.
Jesus, he was just shy of forty-two. He wasn't
Stark whined some more.
Steve rolled his eyes but didn't do anything with the pile of laundry on the couch. He couldn't dump it on his bed, not if one — or both — of them was going to sleep there tonight.
"Probably wouldn't be too happy I got myself a fella, no matter how rich he is, though."
"—because, what, the city wouldn't pay for a new stadium? What was wrong with the old one? It was fine, last I saw it. Better than those bums deserved."
"Are you supposed to? I've been trying to ignore it."
Olivia pursed her lips and put a finger to her mouth. "It 'pends." She began to count off on her fingers. "Sometimes it's 'Steven.' That's when you're telling him stuff and you think you're right. Sometimes it's 'honey' when he's bein' 'xtra stubborn 'bout stuff and you think he's bein' stupid. Sometimes it's 'babe.' That's usually when he comes home and you two
Tony tried to parse through Steve's words, and when he thought he'd finally gotten it, he said, "Oh! This is an old-fashioned superstition thing, right?"
He wracked his brain for
must have smarted in your penny-pinching ass."
Tony glanced up to the half-hard voyeur that was doing nothing to hide his obvious attraction and said, "You heard what the lady said."
But Steve didn't waver from that steadfast seriousness, and he said, "I mean it. You always come first, and I will do everything and anything in my power to protect you and her."
Tony startled a little at the sincerity of Steve’s words. “Uh…” he said, blinking, like he wasn’t sure how to take what Steve had said.
Steve just nodded, his face taking on a sort of faux-serious contortion like he was merely humoring Tony. "Sure," he said then cupped Tony's face in his hands and stroked his thumbs over Tony's cheekbones. "If you say so, honey."
Tony stayed quiet a moment, and when the traffic passed, he motioned for them to cross. Steve led them, slipping only the slightest in the middle of the intersection, and when they got to the other side of the street, Tony only said, "You'd be surprised."
Tony had wanted to kill him before the emotion of the moment took over, and he almost burst into tears. He'd thought then it was just that he was feeling ill. Looking back…oh, it was for another reason entirely.
Barton just shook his head and mouthed,
She muttered something in Russian and rolled her eyes then said in English, "Half the fun is seeing what works on you and what doesn't. You want to 'wow' Steve, right?"

But JARVIS didn't have time to respond, as there was suddenly a weird hum followed by a crack and a flash, and Tony jumped back as an amber-colored portal opened in the middle of his lab, and a child with blonde hair shot out of it like something had pushed it through. The kid hit the floor and slid back toward Tony's worktable, and as the child lay there dazed a moment, the hum stopped, and when Tony looked back up again, the portal was gone and the weird crackle of energy had dissipated.
If this was the way he was going to act, then fuck him. If he was too disgusted by Tony because of something that he had an equal part in bringing about, then fuck him. Tony didn't need him. He'd figure this fucking thing out on his own.
"You are more important to me than anybody has ever been in my life," Steve murmured into his neck. "I know you think you're in some kind of competition with Bucky over my attention, but you're not. Buck's my oldest pal, yeah, and I owe him a debt I don't think I can ever repay, but
"Yeah, you always want to hear your husband talk about how
He turned around to model off the ensemble, and Steve nodded his approval and said, "It looks good. Very summery, actually. But still tasteful."
"Don't even start with that bullshit, Bruce!"
that Steve was still alive. "I don't know. It's…hard to explain."
Steve opened his eyes and glanced back and, in the passing streaks of light, watched as Olivia grumbled and pushed her feet against the back of the seat.
"I'll buy you another one," Tony said and pushed the maroon fabric away from Steve's broad shoulders. Steve was the type to wear an undershirt, and as he finished pulling the dress shirt away, Tony ran his hands underneath his white t-shirt and felt up to Steve's pectorals, grinning a little as he played with Steve's nipples and earned the quiet moan of want he'd been looking for.

Tony nodded at Olivia. "What you saw. What happened to me. It's true. It has to be. I don't see how it couldn't be."
"Excuse me?"
Tony looked from the bottle to Steve then said, "You are
