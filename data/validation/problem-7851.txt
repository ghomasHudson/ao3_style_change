Steve nodded. “Yes.”
Tony shifted up to fourth and let the ‘Cuda ride at sixty-five.  It was cold but dry.  The roads were clear.  She had a lot more under the hood--a
about Steve.
“I know.  He thought you’d made a big deal out of getting it yourself.”
“You’re not supposed to be up here,” Tony said. He kept his voice reasonable. Dodger seemed like a reasonable enough dog. Tony was sure if he explained the situation again--that no one of the four-legged variety was allowed on the furniture--that he would hop down and walk away. “I specifically said no dogs on the beds. Remember? You were there. You heard me.”
Steve shrugged one shoulder, but he looked happy. “I just dump it in and turn it on,” he said. “Same as everybody.”
like it? Like the idea of being tied up here?"
John turned out to be a pleasant, level-headed guy who seemed enthusiastic about what S.I. could deliver in terms of clean energy. He asked clear questions, and was very eager to talk about the details, which would have been fantastic, if it hadn’t cut so much into Tony’s evening plans.
“No,” both Peter and May said together, and they all laughed.
It was still running when Tony fell asleep.
“It’s supposed to be touching.”
“Noon, huh?” he said idly.
Sam laughed. “Do you listen to anything I say? Am I even here? I know you really only listen when loverboy is--”
Wouldn’t he?
one of us--will be here with you until we get this figured out.  Okay?”
“Uh-huh,” she agreed. She picked up another crayon. Twirled it like Steve had done. Then she looked at him. Finally looked at him. “Maybe you should sleep in Daddy’s bed some more. Then you won’t have bad dreams.”
“Yes, I do.”
Tony had been far from idle after he found out about Steve’s incarceration.  He’d kept up his work with the Avengers, but on the side, he’d worked on this too.
“Me too.”
Steve finally looked at the bed.  It was the same.  Tony hadn’t changed that.  Or any of this room.  He still felt it was sacred space.  Their own private sanctuary.
Tony put his hand on Steve’s arm, pressing into him just the slightest bit. “Good.”
Home.
Steve leaned into him--would have been lying on top of him if not for the arms of the chairs keeping them separated--and kissed his neck. Tiny, incessant kisses that drove Tony not only to distraction, but almost insane with charmed want, until he could no longer stand it and had to shove him playfully away. He immediately pulled him back, though. He
"I'm Steve Rogers," he said.  "Tony Stark was brought in earlier, um-" He stopped, ran a hand through his hair, unsure of how to continue.  Nat had been tearful and frantic on the phone, repeating
“Majorca?  Since when are you going to Majorca?”
Tony latched onto Steve’s arm and shook it with gleeful joy.  “I knew it!” he crowed.  “I knew you thought of him as our baby.”  He drug Sir Purr over Steve’s lap and into his own arms to cuddle him.  “Did you hear that, Sir Purr?  Daddy
alright.  That would be the opposite of alright.”
He sighed.  “I can see I’m out-numbered.”
Tony lay quietly against his side, feeling the deep rumble of his voice reverberating in his chest.  He could see the keychain in his mind’s eye.  Could almost see the kid himself--young, blond, skinny but fit, a shadow of teenage acne still on his cheek.  He would have looked up to Steve Rogers.  Would have been honored that
Steve bit his lip and stood up straight. He’d been leaning casually against the railing, but those words put him on alert. The thought of Tony’s bright eyes and flirtatious little laugh went through his head like a soft breeze. “Whose is he then?”
On the landing, Steve turned to Tony and put a finger to his lips. He pointed at the door and mouthed
“Sure,” Steve said, and this time when he held his hand out, Tony took it. Shook it. Let it go.
. But there was no stopping it. Not now, while he had Steve Rogers curled up against his side, his head on his shoulder, the comforting weight and warmth of him so enveloping, so enticing, so
“Was that a fight?” Steve whispered. “Were we fighting? I don’t want to fight. I don’t want to, Tony. I don’t want to fight.”
“Gorgeous,” Tony said truthfully.
. It’s not all day yet, Daddy. The sun is still up!”
was the one who got to experience those things.
She kissed Steve, then looked at him levelly. “Are you sure you’re okay?”
“I want to watch the sharks, Daddy.”
(See the end of the chapter for
His eyelids dropped closed.  “Tony?”
He tossed his bags and briefcase down onto the couch, and scrounged an old pair of jeans and a stained t-shirt from the floor of the attached bathroom and changed. He was still a little wired from his encounter with the watch salesman. Or angry. Pissed off. He’d let it simmer all afternoon, trying to shake it off, but not quite able to, and that made him jittery and on-edge. Of course, the fact that he had dumped extra espresso shots on top of it all probably didn’t help.
Oh, but it hurt to think of Sam.
Tony was nodding before Sam even finished speaking. “Yeah,” he said, “Yeah, I do. I’m coming, okay? I’ll be right there.” He paused. “Wait,
Tony closed the door, turned to Pepper, and spread his arms.  “Come on,” he said.
She kissed his cheek and released him.
“Thanks.”
, Tony.  Sometimes the dream
Steve was silent, letting Tony take control, letting him lead him like a kid down the hallway toward his office. He just put one foot in front of the other, following Tony’s lead with his head down until Tony ushered him into his office and closed the door behind them. He kept his head down even when they were inside. He kept his head down until Tony said, “What’s going on?” He looked up then, and Tony fell back a step, struck by how old he looked. How hollow.
The blush deepened across Steve’s cheeks.  God, Tony adored that pale, Irish skin.  “You fell asleep on the couch while we were watching that dumb movie, and I just sort of did it.”  He looked down at their linked hands, then back up at Tony.  “I knew I shouldn’t, but I just...wanted to.”  He fixed Tony with a glum expression, looking like an eight-year-old with his hand caught in the old proverbial cookie jar.  “I’m sorry.”
“What are
He drew in a lungful of oxygen-less air and tightened his fist in Steve’s hair, holding him in place. “Yeah, peanut?”
Then Tony had smiled at him, and Steve felt warm all over.  He’d seemed to hear a melody then, but it hadn’t had anything to do with Alice or her Chains.
Tony’s brow furrowed and those eyes got darker, even more intense. Steve couldn’t look away now if he tried. He was held in their thrall. “But that’s not the same thing, is it?” he asked. “Is it, Steve?”
Tony.”
Tony leaned closer to the wall, looking at one last picture he’d missed the first time through. “Is that your dad?”
“I told you to watch your mouth!”
“Tony.”
Steve was sitting in the hospital cafeteria. Sarah’s chemo treatments took a long time. Six hours. Thank god they were almost done. Just two more, and then they were through. Steve knew they would never be completely in the clear, but Dr. Mickelsen was extremely optimistic, and that made Sarah--and, by extension, Steve--feel optimistic too.
Steve closed the door then leaned against it. “Is that not okay?” he asked stiffly.
Steve’s smile faded and he sighed.  “I guess I just want to make sure you want to be with me.  You never did get your two weeks to think about it.”
Tony sank his teeth gently into the smooth skin of Steve’s jaw. “
“Not the same thing, Cap.”
Steve laughed and squeezed him. “I think I might take it over for myself,” he said. “It does sound nice. The promises. I’m sorry I didn’t give them to you more often.”
Steve squeezed Tony tightly. “I kind of like this position.”
He was turned away, but he’d know those shoulders anywhere, the line of the back, the dark-blond hair just long enough to touch the collar of his jacket.  This guy was standing--
“They kept it up,” Steve said, his voice pained.  “When I went to The Raft.  They just dosed me more.  Every day.  Except when Doctor Strange was coming, then they stopped.  After he left, they’d start again.”
look?”
“Okay, I’m finished.”
He went to the side of the bed and sat down. Tony’s lashes lay smoothly against cheeks that were flushed pink with sleep. His lips parted slightly. Curled up, his dark hair such a contrast to the white sheets surrounding him, Steve thought he had never in his entire life seen anything more perfect, and his adoration for him pounded through his veins, making him weak.
Steve shrugged, lifting his shoulders slowly and letting them settle back into place. “I don’t care, Tony,” he said quietly. “Just not here.”
Tony kissed him again.  “Don’t be so cynical,” he said.  “People care, baby.  They do.”
Steve bit the insides of his cheeks at the angry flush that colored Ross’ face.
“Tell me how it’s going with the walker.”
“Wanda?”
She cocked an eyebrow. “How do you know that?”
“Maybe he has to,” Steve said.
Natasha sweet-talked her new bartender friend out of a bottle of champagne and two glasses, and she and Steve rode up the elevator together in companionable silence.  When they reached the common floor, Steve stopped in the kitchen.  Tony’s chicken was on the counter.  Steve took the bucket.  He left the sides, though.  He wasn’t cruel.  Now he and Nat were sitting on his bed, the bucket between them, now mostly empty, the bottle of champagne fizzing it’s last on his bedside table.  Steve had kicked off his shoes and taken off his dress-shirt and tie.  Nat had stripped her dress unceremoniously over her head and rummaged in his drawer until she found a t-shirt.  It was huge on her, hanging down almost to her knees.  In it, she looked like a little girl, and it made Steve glad to see her like that.  He had a feeling she hadn’t been allowed to look like a child even when she’d been one
Tony felt his pulse quicken.  He’d been aware of the low heat in the pit of his stomach since Steve’s thumb had pressed into the jut of his hip bone, aware of it slowly building as he applied the razor to his skin.  But now, watching the deliberate, meticulous way he maneuvered it around his jaw and lips, Tony felt his arousal growing dangerously.
“Yeah,” Steve said, encircling Tony’s waist and burying his face in his neck. “I’m home.”
Steve breathed out a laugh and shook his head.
“Well…” Tony said finally.
“It’s been a long time since I was my own boss, Tony,” Steve said softly.  “Since I didn’t have to ask somebody’s permission.”
Steve turned his head just enough to kiss the underside of Tony’s jaw. “Somebody like you."
“I love you” in code.
Steve smiled and slipped closer to Tony, resting more fully against him.  He rubbed his cheek against Tony’s shoulder, then kissed it and closed his eyes.
Steve shook his head. He could feel the stump beneath him, knew the good, solid earth was under his feet, but for some reason, it felt like it was crumbling away. Like everything was crumbling away. It scared him. He hadn’t been scared for a while. Not since Tony had come and sat beside him in the cafeteria all those months ago, but he was scared now. He could feel that void that had mostly closed beginning to yawn open again. He didn’t want to fall, though. Not anymore. Because if he fell, he wouldn’t have Tony. He’d be alone, falling through that darkness. Tony wouldn’t be with him, and he didn’t want that.
Steve shifted closer to Tony and laid his head on his shoulder.  Tony rubbed his back in soft circles.  “Oh,” Steve said.  “That’s a little sad.”
Outside the window, they could see Steve and Bobby unloading a moving truck.  Jasmine was directing them where to put the boxes, having them stack them by room for easy organization later.  Steve followed direction without question. He was still a soldier at heart. He knew how to follow orders.
“Are you kidding?  I’m crazy about you.”
Tony laughed again. He couldn’t believe he’d been actually worried about tonight. About Steve not wanting him. Steve, who was now lying naked in his bed, pouting, demanding, begging Tony to do things to him. How did that happen? How did
go crazy.  He knew that.  So, he shut off the thinking.  He could do that. Over the years, he'd
“Me too.”
“Why couldn’t I remember?”
“She can help with that.”
“I wouldn’t have let you leave.”
Tony pressed against him and tongued the spot below his ear.  He’d claimed it as his own once.  He was going to reclaim it now.  “It’s okay,” he said.  “You don’t have to.  You just talk.  I’ll take care of the rest.”
Dodger wagged his tail again. His tongue hung out of his mouth, grinning at Tony in a happy way that Tony might would have found cute--okay, fucking adorable--if he hadn’t been on the bed.
“What have you got so far?”
He smiled sleepily up at Steve. “Hey,” he mumbled.
“They wanted to push him.  See how much he could take.  They wanted to see how far he would go before--”
Tony cocked his head. The solemnity was still there in his eyes, simmering with something else. Something greedy and hot. Steve could almost feel it. Feel it washing over him like tangible, physical need. “What are you saying?”
“That’s fair.”
“Steve--”
Steve shook his head.  “How?”
“You kiss your mother with that mouth?”
“Pick up your Legos first.”
Steve shook his head. Ridiculous. Insane. Obadiah Stane was his mission here. Watching the apartment when Stane wasn’t home. When it was empty. Noting the comings and goings--if there were any. Position three. Not position one like he was used to. Not even position two. Position three. Because this was his down time. His time to recover. His time to regroup. Still working, yeah, because even though it was the most boring job he’d ever had, he was still technically
He squeezed her hard. That relief was back. That happy feeling that he’d had all morning. “He really is, Mom.”
gonna make sure of it. All of us. Our family.”
“I’m sorry I wasn’t awake when you did it.”
“Of course, you can.”
Afterward, Jeff clapped Steve on the shoulder.  “Thank god tonight was only a practice.  Ouch.”
Steve nodded automatically. “Yeah.”
send other letters...for a while. But as the weeks went by, it got harder to come up with things to write. Tony’s were so full of hope, of optimism, of happiness, and what did Steve have to write about? Being tired all the time. Moon Dust everywhere. Waking up to the sound of distant gunfire. Or screams. Being cursed at and spit on. Getting friendly with a couple of the locals only to discover them suddenly missing one day, their shops boarded up or simply abandoned. Finding a dying dog on the side of the road and wanting to take him home. Wanting to take care of him, nurse him back to health, keep him, and train him, and love him, and take pictures with him to send home to his mom. He didn’t do those things though. He couldn’t. He squatted down and pet its head, feeling sick as its big, brown, trusting eyes rolled up to look at him even as the blood pooled beneath its open mouth. He said, “It’s okay, big guy. It’s okay. I’ll take care of you, ‘kay? Don’t worry.” And the dog thumped its tail weakly against the ground even as Steve put a bullet in its head.
Rhodey finished off his own beer and put the empty bottle on the table next to him.  He glanced at Tony sideways, his hands in his lap.  “He asked me to come get you, you know.”
on his side. And that was a pretty fucking good feeling.
April:
“I can’t,” Steve whispered, and shook his head. “I don’t...I can’t think of...words. Right now.”
Wow. Here we go. Finally. I haven't written anything in about 3 weeks. At one point, I opened my writing program and it told me my last edit had been 9 days ago. And I'm pretty sure that "edit" had been when I opened it, took away one comma, then closed it again. I can't even blame it all on work, even though November and December are our busiest months. I've just fallen down a rabbit-hole of trash tv and laziness. Sorry. For anyone who was wondering if I ever planned on posting again, sorry. Anyway, here's another chapter. It's not the greatest, but we're getting to the end now.
“I’m sorry it took me so long to find you,” Steve whispered.
He sighed.  “I know.”
“Guess we’re both just going to have to deal with it, huh?”
He entered the clearing, glancing up as Steve had done at the birds twittering overhead, and came to where Steve sat on the stump. He looked down at Steve’s feet, at the little designs he had made with his toe, and the corner of his mouth ticked up. “You always draw,” he said. “Why do you always draw?”
What did that mean? Did that
SEPTEMBER, SUNDAY 1:30 AM
Vague grumble in Russian, then silence.
Steve looked at him doubtfully. “I don’t think your clothes will fit me.”
Steve sighed, tightened his grip.  “For a minute, maybe.”
Not that it mattered.  Not right now, anyway.  Right now, all that mattered was Steve’s proximity and his eyes and his silly little joke.  Tony stepped closer, slotting one of Steve’s knees between his legs.  Not touching him, oh no, god, not yet, but making both of them very aware of the other’s presence.
“No, really, what did you say?”
Steve laughed. “Yeah,” he said. “I know.”
“I know,” Steve said. “I don’t even really need to talk to him personally. I thought...I thought I could just leave him a message or something. Can you-”
Fury sighed angrily.  “You need to stop interrupting me when I’m trying to help you, Rogers.”
“I will.  I love you.”
Tony pressed his lips to Steve’s chest.  It didn’t have to be a kiss.  Not if Steve didn’t want it to be.  “Probably not.  I’m an old dog.  No new tricks for me.”
He shoved that thought away. Fast.
He finished his coffee, went into the bathroom and cleaned up a little, then went to the kitchen. He could hear their voices--his people’s voices--Morgan’s high and twittering, Steve’s a low, pleasant rumble, and then there they were. And Steve’s eyes lit up when he saw him. Tony didn’t want to make comparisons. He never wanted to do that. But nobody he’d ever shared a morning with--including Pepper--had ever looked at him like that.
he thought.
Just some guy staring at the sun.
“Didn’t he ever tell you about the farm, and his nightmare, and...stuff?”
“Hello, Captain Rogers.”
Eight miles from home, thunder crashed over his head.
Tony considered.  “I think that depends on what you say next.”
Tony gave him a critical eye.  Jeans, sneakers, dark blue button-down.  The cuffs were unbuttoned and rolled to the elbow, exposing sinewy forearms, the collar open just enough for a white t-shirt to peek out.  His face was smooth, his hair, dark blond and thick, touched the collar of his shirt.
.  Right now.  I’ve got a situation.  Tell him I need a portal and I need
“Do you think you’ll ever forgive me?”
“Yes,” he said slowly, “but I’ve wanted to call you for months.”
Steve indulged him a little longer, then pulled away.  He sat up, straddling Tony’s hips, and pulled his own shirt off.  Tony reached up and ran his fingers over the hard abdominals.  “God, you’re perfect,” he whispered.  And he was.  The lamplight burnished his skin in gold.
“Tony--”
Tony.
“You’re not supposed to pray for someone to get a boyfriend, Mom,” he laughed. “I’m pretty sure that’s not what Father Callahan has in mind when he’s standing at the pulpit.”
I pet your dog?”
Steve tilted Tony’s face up to his so he could look him in the eye.  Icy blues met warm, liquid brown.  “I love you,” he said. “I love you so much I can’t breathe, I can’t move, I can’t--god, I can’t do anything.”  He shook his head helplessly.  “You’re all I think about.  You’re everything I ever...You’re everything, Tony.  You’re just--you’re everything.”
“Bring him in, Nat,” he said.  “This is his home, too.  More now than ever.”
A silence fell between them, comfortable and warm, broken only by the lapping of the lake on the beach, and the cat’s rusty purr.  Tony put his hand on the back of Steve’s neck and brushed through his hair.  Steve sighed in contentment.
“You’re not alone," Steve pointed out. "Morgan’s there.”
Steve laughed in his ear. Tony’s favorite one. The low, soft one that came from the back of his throat. “That doesn’t happen much.”
He started to crawl forward, his hands and knees gritting in the snow and sand and rubble. “Barnes! Fucking report, right now!”
Nat was right: arrogant pricks all around, alright.  Strange just seemed to bring it out in him.
Tony ate a little.  He wanted to wolf them down--good?  They were fucking
“I don’t like the way he talks to you. It scares me.”
Steve kissed him one more time, just a soft, tiny kiss, then called, “Coming, Mom.”
“Hey!  You came!”
“Where are we going then?” he asked, annoyed.
“You don’t
“Ross.”
“Meeting the parents?”
“So, you drew the short straw, huh?”  Tony said.  He was smiling a little, wondering how this was going to go.  In a way, he felt bad for Bruce.  If socially-awkward had a poster-child, it would be him.  But he was a good guy, sweet and innately kind, in spite of his big, green counterpart, and Tony tried to be gentle with him.  He just wished teasing him wasn’t so much fun.
It was 11:43. He should have been here at eleven.
Howard would be more than nice. It’s be a fucking revelation.
Steve snapped his head towards him, his face a swirl of emotions, humor, pain, not knowing which one to feel.  Tony smiled at him, and Steve smiled back, clearly relieved.  “Same old Tony,” he said.  “Always a smart-ass.”
“We never had any
Tony nodded.  “He says he doesn’t have puppy dog eyes.”

“You were asking me to dinner.”
instead of just watching the apartment.
"No," she said.  "It's Tony. He's been shot."
Steve nodded at them.  The boy dropped the ball on his toe, and the girl covered her mouth, rocking in her chair, giggling.  Tony shook his head.  “God, were we ever that young?”
Tony thought, and giggled.
“It was nice to see you again, Steve.”
“Are you going to take my clothes off this time?” Tony asked. “I miss that. You taking all my clothes off.”
a next time. If Tony and Morgan didn’t just decide to leave him at the proverbial altar. He wouldn’t blame them if they did. He sucked.
He felt like he’d barely seen Tony at all for days.
“I’m very okay with this.”
Tony let Steve lead him into the apartment. “No. I’m not hungry. I just kind of want to lie down.”
“You really know how to talk some trash, don’t you, Rogers?”
“That’s not our decision to make.”
“I can do that.”
“No, I don’t want you to throw it away, but I don’t want it to be the only thing you think about, either,” Pietro said, his voice rising. “Sometimes it feels like all you think about are the last ten years.”
They fell silent, looking at each other in the dim room. All around them the party was going on, but here it was quiet, the space between them heavy with all the years they had, both together and apart. Out of the corner of his eye, Steve could see Tony’s girlfriend talking with Natasha and Bucky. He could see how pretty she was, how happy she looked, and his heart sank even lower.
owe you.  You gave him back to us, Tony.  Thank you.”
He got to Bleecker street at ten a.m. and knocked on 177A at 10:20.  He spent the twenty minutes alternately meditating and screaming internally.  He didn’t want to do this.  He had to do this.  Fuck you, Stephen Strange.  I need you, Doctor.
“It doesn’t matter anymore, Mom,” he said tiredly, and hung his head. “It’s done.” And the finality with which he spoke seemed to zipper her lips together. She had no argument for that, it seemed. She tried, but her mind--grieving her own loss, screaming its pain like a caged jungle cat inside her--simply would not let anything else out. No words of comfort. Or admonition. Or anything else except “Good-night” when he stood, kissed the top of her head, and walked away from her, closing the door to his bedroom gently behind him.
(See the end of the chapter for
written on them in either his mother’s or Tony’s handwriting in black Sharpie. Others were still in the process of being filled. He saw a bunch of his clothes stuffed into one of them. A bunch of papers in another. It all seemed a little haphazard to Steve, who would have done things differently, going methodically room by room and stacking things neatly one box at a time, but this, this whirlwind of activity made him happy. It was Tony’s way. All Tony. And the thought of that, of Tony doing all this just so they could be together, filled him with a peace he had never thought he would be capable of finding.
He glanced at Tony again, but he wasn’t looking this way anymore. He was looking at his boyfriend. Talking to him. Steve looked away. He didn’t want to see it happening with Tony and this other guy.
“Oh,” he said. “Your wife. Right. I forgot you were married.”
“Come to bed,” she said.
The moon was still in the window, but it was lower.  The shadows in the corners of the room were deeper, almost velvety in the remaining light.
"Or maybe the simplest explanation is the correct one. He had pages of notes on Steve and his PTSD-related drug use.  He gave those to the local police. They arrested a drug-dealer in your town who says he might have dealt to 'a guy like that' when they questioned him."
Tony turned and came back.  He stopped in front of Steve and looked up at him with his rich, dark eyes.  “You’re right,” he sighed, and punched Steve in the jaw.
Natasha laid her hand on his cheek.  “It’ll be okay.”
feel good. Right? Steve?”
Tony kissed him. It was all he could do. There were no words in his head, no words on his tongue. Rarely was he stripped so completely of the ability to speak, but it was gone now, lost in the abyss of whatever this was that he was feeling. He didn’t dare call it love. He wasn't sure anymore if Steve would want him to, but in his deepest heart, he knew that’s what it was. Love. The simplest, most profound emotion available to the human heart. And he was, once again, overwhelmed by its strength. Its beauty. Its terrible, frightening fragility. He kissed him. He kissed him and let his body say what his voice could not.
That's kind of a pointless story, but I thought it would be fun to share!
Steve shifted, his muscles tensing even more. “I would if I had to,” he said.
“No.  Steve.  He’s back.”
Steve bent down. “I, uh, I left him with my mom,” he said in a low, conspiratorial tone. “I thought he might get a little jealous if he saw me petting stingrays instead of him.” Tony snorted. Steve ignored him. Or tried to, anyway. “You won’t tell him, will you?” he asked.
“FRIDAY?” he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.  “I don’t know if you can hear me, FRI, but I wanted to say I’m sorry.  I screwed up.  I know I did.  I hurt him.  I hurt you.  I hurt everybody.  This is my fault.  I’m going to try and fix it, I promise.”  He swallowed, trying to get past the lump that was suddenly in his throat.  “I know I don’t deserve a second chance, but...I need one.”  He pinched the bridge of his nose, wiping away the gathering tears and waited.  When she didn’t speak, he nodded.  “It’s okay,” he said.  “It’s okay.  I understand.”  And he did.  That was the worst part.
Tony sighed, his mind on the box in his pocket. “Me too.”
--that compares to you.”
Clint pointed, almost imperceptibly, with his pinkie finger while he put another chip into his mouth. “Cap,” he said.
“The frosted ones?”
Steve leaned against her, and she ran her hand through his hair again. “Thanks for letting him stay with you, Mom.”
Steve ran a frustrated hand through his hair. He was blushing again, too. “That was
“Okay,” Steve said. He didn’t let go of Tony’s hand while he locked the door and turned off the lights. He held onto him, and Tony let him hold on. He let him lead him through the apartment to the bedroom, and Steve was glad he let him. Tony knew the way by now, of course, but Steve didn’t want to let go of him just yet.
Tony huffed out a laugh and dropped his head onto Steve’s chest. When he lifted it a moment later to look into Steve’s eyes, his own were dark and solemn even as a smile played around his lips. “Yeah, baby,” he said quietly. “I promise.”
“That’s difficult to say,” Strange said carefully.  “He
“Nope. Just an extremely happy coincidence.” He sucked a bruise onto Steve’s skin, then licked the same spot, soothing it. “She’s very taken with you,” he said. “She never acts like this with new people. She’s usually very reserved.”
It wasn’t cold--thank god for summer in the city--but it was very wet. Steve, Sam, and Sarah got out of the cab she had hired. Sam held an umbrella while Steve got his bag out of the trunk of the car. Sarah clutched Sam tightly. She had held onto Steve’s hand for the entire car ride from home, but when he got out of the car, she held Sam’s instead. She had to. She needed a tether. She was afraid of what would happen if she didn’t have it. Sam didn’t mind. He held her back just as tightly. He was not shipping out for a couple more months--his birthday wasn’t until September--so he was saying good-bye too. His heart was breaking almost as much as Sarah’s. He felt like he was losing his best friend.
“I was curious.”
And after they talked about his boss, maybe Tony could get him to talk about
Tony was in surgery for four hours.
He heard movement at the end of the hallway, and he leaned against the sink, waiting. He didn’t even try to make it look like he wasn’t. Why should he hide it? He’d been waiting for fifteen years.
Tony didn’t say anything.  He just came down the steps and fell into warm, friendly arms.  Rhodey caught him.  He was good like that.
“Steve?” he murmured.
Steve cocked an eyebrow. “Celebrate? Is that what we’re calling it?”
He touched Nat’s arm, soothing it with it with gentle fingers.  “Shh,” he whispered, “it’s okay,” and she subsided against him once more.
Let me do this.
“Bye.”
be their regular time to sit down at the table.
“Not angry, exactly,” he said, thinking about Pepper’s elegant face, her eyes darkening, her brows contracting a bit.  “More like...pity.”
“Stark!” Strange yelled, and this time, it got through.
Steve bit his lip. Sergeant Rogers had retreated back into his place inside Steve’s head, leaving Steve to deal with this himself.
“Hey,” Tony said, grinning, “how’s my two favorite people?”
“I didn’t say you weren’t an idiot.  You can laugh at idiots without consequence.”
Stupid fucking heart.
Tony stole another kiss. “Could have fooled me.”
with him?
“I’m a good multi-tasker,” Tony said, reaching for Steve’s waistband.  “I can jerk you off and listen at the same time.”
He wanted so very badly to go to Tony, but he couldn’t.  He settled for saying his name.
Steve shook his head again.  “Well, you’re a little scruffy too, but I still like you.”
Tony took him in his arms and held him.  Steve curled against him, head buried against  his stomach, arm around him, hand clutching his back.  “It’s okay,” Tony said, running his hands through Steve’s hair, rubbing soothing circles against his back and shoulders.  “Hey, it’s alright.  Don’t, baby, it’s okay.”
“Report on the status-change, Rogers.”
“Before what?” Tony asked hollowly.
"No. Really. You give me too much already."
Steve’s breathing got rougher.  His hands jerked, balling convulsively.  He moaned again.
his returned.
“He says he’s ‘too busy’ for this,” Tony said, quirking his fingers into irritated air quotes.
Tony looked at her, his brows drawn together.  “Is that why he’s doing it?”
Steve pushed suddenly off from the edge of the pool, twisting away into the middle of the water.
“Just worried.”
wanted to be the one kissing Indy on that boat.”
Dodger whined a little, almost in apology, and Steve pet him again.
“Do you need help with the boxes?” Pietro asked, breaking out of Steve’s embrace.
“No.” He laughed a little and traced one finger along Steve’s jaw. “I was a little pissed earlier.” Steve opened his mouth to apologize again, but Tony put his finger across his lips. “Not at
“Our little insurrectionist pals over there. FRIDAY clocked them when they came in and alerted me.” He leaned into her hand a bit, taking the bait without even realizing it. “I had it all under control until I saw you two over-achievers getting ready to go all Colonel Sanders on their asses.”
“It won’t be,” Tony assured him, tracing the straight line of his jaw. “I might not look it, but I’m pretty tough.”
Steve grabbed the remote control and turned the music off. He looked flustered suddenly, that intense concentration gone. He shoved his brush into a cup of water. “Tony,” he said. “Hey. Umm. You’re home early.”
“I said, he likes you.”
, those pecs sparkling with water were a fucking wonder to behold--and take that from him too. “You won’t even come near me right now. You’re staying clear over there, as far away as you can-”
“Yeah,” Steve said, snuggling into Tony’s side. “He’s tough, though. Toughest guy in the unit.”
“It has to be, Steve.  Because we need him, and we need you, and we need you together.  We’ll all die if you aren’t.”
“Yeah.”
“Oh yeah,” Tony agreed.  “That’s my assessment, too.”
“Oh god, Steve,” Tony panted. “God, baby, you’re so good. So beautiful. So-” he heaved in a sudden breath as Steve’s hand found his balls and squeezed softly. “Fuck. Oh fuck.” Steve cried out in soft protest when he pulled out of his mouth. “Turn over, baby,” Tony said, grasping his hip insistently. “I want you. I want to be inside you.”
Steve looked down at his feet. He couldn’t bear to look at Tony anymore. To look at that face and know he was leaving, going back to that house with that man. He nodded silently.
Bucky stared at him, his face set, eyes hard and questioning. They were sitting in his apartment. Natasha was at work, and Bucky and Steve were here,

Steve watched Tony as the song changed, but Josh kept looking at
Tony clutched his chest with his free hand. “
"I'm here," he said.
Questions rose up in his head as he let her hug him.
Maybe one more chapter?...
“I said, I’m not going to say no,” Steve answered.  His face was still blank, but he leaned closer to Tony, his eyes touched by fear and resignation, an uneasy combination that hurt Tony clear down to his soul.  “I hate it here, Tony,” he whispered, and though the others could plainly hear what he said, they all knew Steve’s words were for Tony only.  “I feel weak just being here.  I wanna go home.”
. The Tony he thought of was short and wiry, skinny, with an air of mischief in his eyes.
to go to the lab.  Or to the kitchen, or the garage, but
“What am I gonna do with you?” Steve asked.
“Is that really legit?”
“I don’t want you to hurt yourself.”
“Would you like a refill, Mr. Stark?”
“What?” Steve asked, confused again.
He crossed the short distance from the ‘Cuda’s bumper to the door of the warehouse.  The ground was mostly dirt out here.  Rich, dark, fertile earth.  Even now, in late winter, tiny green shoots of underbrush were peeking out of the ground, creating a soft carpet for Tony to walk on.  In a month, it would be a riot of green with wildflowers and the beginnings of ivy climbing the side of the warehouse.  It would be beautiful.  The lush urgency of nature overtaking the manmade structure, covering it, growing over it, bringing it to its metaphorical knees.  There was some kind of lesson there.  Tony knew there was.  Just as he knew that Steve would grasp it immediately.
“You left it on the ground,” Tony said.  “
Steve splashed his face with hot water, then took the brush and worked the soap into a rich lather.  He didn’t look at Tony, didn’t falter under his scrutiny, just used the brush to apply the lather to his face in small circular motions, then picked up the razor.
He looked angry. His face was red, which was nothing new. You couldn’t spend thirty years with your head in a bottle without facing some capillary-bursting consequences at some point. His eyes were shot through with blood, his mouth turned down in a solid line. Sitting there in the silent gloom of the darkened room, he seemed like a harbinger of some frightening future Tony didn’t want to even imagine let alone aspire to.
“I got him. Get Jonathon.”
The bedroom was right down the short hallway. Steve could feel the tension in his shoulders ramping up, felt himself catching his breath and holding it until he pushed the door open and saw him there--saw his home, his life, his entire world--lying on the bed. Then everything was better. Everything was easier. His shoulders relaxed. He could breathe again.
Tony came into the room and opened the lid of the pot on the stove, inhaling rosemary and garlic and beef. “Holy shit. That smells amazing.”
“Come here,” Steve said, and pulled him closer, into his arms. Tony came and melted immediately against him, tucking his head under Steve’s jaw, letting him wrap his arms around him, letting him hold him close and press a kiss against his temple. “Hey,” Steve said again, running a soothing hand up Tony’s back. “Really. What’s the matter?”
“Hey.”
“Yes please, Mrs. Rogers.”
Tony sighed, as if realizing, just the way Steve had done, that July was something that would not happen. Not this year, anyway. Maybe never.
“Maybe we could go get something to eat?  If you wanted?”
Steve shrugged and puffed his cigarette, his eyes never leaving Tony’s. “Uh-huh.”
Would he, himself?
“Dodger,” he said seriously, and propped himself up on his elbow. “I’m sorry. You seem like a very decent dog. But-” Dodger perked his ears up, and Tony deliberately schooled his features into a stern countenance, “-you shed. That’s nothing against you. It’s not your fault. Dogs shed. All dogs shed. Tha-”
“Tony?” Steve asked, pulling back a little.  “You okay?  You shivered.”
“They’re beautiful, honey,” she said, kissing his cheek.
Steve breathed his name as Tony nibbled on that sensitive place beneath his ear, and scratched his nails up and down Tony’s back with one hand, while the other slipped along his thigh.
“What?”
had a giant green rage-monster living inside of him, he’d like the feeling of a little space, but he didn’t. His own monster was a little smaller. A little quieter. More like something with sharp, evil teeth gnawing at his insides, than something as gorgeous and grandiose as the Hulk.
Steve shrugged. He had no argument.
Steve laughed as Tony pinched Rhodey’s cheek.  “Aww.  Ain’t he the cutest?”
Tony grinned triumphantly. “Good,” he said, and then his hand slipped off the cuff of Steve’s jacket, and directly into Steve’s. He folded them together expertly, as if he had been doing it his entire life, as if he just knew how they fit together. And they did. They fit together perfectly. Like magic. Like fate. “Wait ‘til you see my room, anyway. It’s a fucking disaster.”
And he did. Right after kissing Steve goodbye, shutting down his projects, eating fruit and
Steve frowned. “My work?”
“Looked pretty serious from over there.”
“Yes.”  Tony gripped him through his pants, and Steve sighed harshly.  His head fell back against the metal wall.  He closed his eyes.  “Go on, baby,” Tony said, and traced his finger over Steve’s growing erection.  “Talk.  I’m listening.”
“Are you serious?” Tony asked. “I mean, are you--are we--seriously doing this right now?”
“I-I’m just excited.”
He took a step back now under the cold weight of those eyes, but then he stopped.  Every fiber, every molecule, every atom that lived within his skin told him to run.  These men and women were heroes.  He had no place among them and the very idea that he ever actually thought he had, defiled them.
Happy looked a bit less than as he scanned Tony’s face nervously.  “This isn’t a problem, is it, boss?”
“Activating Protocol 713-B.”
Tony unlocked the door and opened it.  “Come on in, Thad,” he said, and Ross stepped inside.
“Sergeant,” Dugan said, kneeling next to him. “Juniper…”
Tony glanced up at him and Sam flapped a hand.  “Of
At first, none of the others heard him.  They were still trying to figure out who’s dick was bigger.  That’s what Tony would have said, anyway.  It was probably true.
Thor scoffed.  “She will be fine, as well,” he said.  “She and Natasha each had four.”
Now she lifted her head, and she lifted it high, looking Steve in the eye, and the pride in his own face was brilliant, blinding.
It was. Tony knew it was. Theoretically, it was perfect, but for his purposes it just wasn’t quite right.
“You didn’t get hurt, did you?”
Steve laughed under his breath. He looked like he was enjoying this just as much as Tony was. He hadn’t even reached for his drink for a while. Not since they had really started talking. Tony felt an intense and immediate satisfaction in that. “It was one time,” Steve said softly, still smiling that little, enigmatic smile. “I think he felt sorry for me.” He shrugged again. “Or, you know, he was just being polite.”
“Thank you,” he said, and ran his hand through Morgan’s hair. “And thanks for helping with Morgan.”
“Did the others get off okay?” Steve asked after a while.
“You’re welcome.”
“Yeah. That’s what my girlfriend says anyway.” He tipped his head from side to side. “She mighta been talking about all her old boyfriends, though.”
He woke up again at seven.  He’d left the bedroom door open, and this time, when he looked out, Steve was gone.  Tony panicked only for a moment, though.  His jacket was still hanging on the back of a kitchen chair.  His ruck-sack still sat by the door.  He hadn’t gone far, then.
“I don’t know.”
“Hi, Steve.”
Tony studied it--a tall guy, blond, with blue eyes. He wasn’t as broad as Steve, his jaw not quite as strong, but he had the same look of
Or didn’t do.
“Do what?”
“Yeah.”
sure,” Steve said.  “This?
“I’d never say that,” Steve whispered, casting his eyes downward.  “I’d never
“Did I see coffee in your hands, my dear?”
Quick word about timelines: Those of you who have read my other stories know I kind of play fast and loose with timelines. I try to keep stuff vague on purpose, just dropping a few hints to sort of get a feeling of about where we are, even though it probably doesn't really matter in terms of the stories themselves. We're probably mid-nineties here for anyone who cares.
Steve fell through the door.  The smell of bacon was driving him mad.
Tony shrugged.  “What about you?  What are you going to do?”
“Can I ask you something?”
, his brain supplied helpfully. “I’m sorry,” he managed. “I don’t understand why you’d want to do that?” He gave the last word a little uptilt in inflection, turning it into a half-question.
Tony reached for him, barely touching him before Steve wheeled back.  “I think I’ll go shower,” he said.
He hated the sad, pathetic way it sounded, but he did want to know.  In fact, right now, it was the only thing he really wanted to know.
“And?”
Tony thought of him in the bathroom before his first appointment, beautiful in his jeans and simple button-down, asking Tony if he looked healthy.  “Mental-healthy”.
Steve’s eyes hadn’t left his drawing during the entire conversation, but now they rolled heavenward.  “I didn’t deserve it then, Tony,” he said.
Steve looked back with wet, puzzled eyes.  He wiped his nose again. "What? I sneezed.  So what?"
“You’d better not be,” Tony said, and tugged on his coat. “Come here, Steve. Let’s just do this, ‘kay? I don’t want to waste time being weird and awkward.”
Steve brought his thumb up to his mouth and chewed.  He still hadn’t lost the habit even though his nail was practically non-existent by now.  Tony so wanted to take his hand and hold it.  If he was holding it, Steve wouldn’t be able to chew on it.  Tony could kiss it instead.  Try and take the hurt away his way.
“I’ll try, Nat,” he said.  “But if I can’t...if it looks like I’m not going to be able to…” He looked into her eyes.  No, there was no green.  Just clear, crystal blue.  “Don’t let them move me, okay?  If I’m going to die, I want it to be here.”
.  If anyone else knew about it, they deliberately left it alone.  Neither Steve nor Natasha would have told people to stay away, but it would have changed it, and eventually they, themselves, would have abandoned it.
“Please don’t.”
Sam looked up when he came out and sat down. “How is she?”
Sometimes it wasn’t okay.  Like when Steve had a nightmare while napping on the couch and Tony went to comfort him.  Steve threw Tony’s hand away, yelled “I’m none of your fucking business, Tony, remember?” and stomped off.  Or when Tony heard Steve and FRIDAY speaking to each other in a soft, gentle way, like old friends--old
He froze.
“It’s not okay.”

shy?”
“No, you don’t.”
“Nowhere,” Tony assured him. “I’m just stepping across the room for one second, okay? Just wait here. I’ll be right back.”
“I know.”
It was fine.
“Fine.”  She turned back to him when she got to the door.  “Sort yourself out, Tony,” she said bitterly.  “You’re a mess.”
Afterward, they took turns in the bathroom, showering and changing. Steve had never thought about the bathroom before. He’d seen those home-improvement shows where they had giant bathtubs and shower stalls big enough for two, and thought they were ridiculous, but now he wished they had one. He wished he and Tony could both fit in there together. But he just hurried really fast instead.
“Your mom’s keeping them all day,” he said. “I’d planned on keeping you
He went into the bathroom and showered, brushed his teeth, pulled on some sweats, then went back into the bedroom. Tony hadn’t moved. Steve put the tablet aside, then bent to take Tony’s glasses off his nose. Tony flinched, his hand rising automatically. His eyelids fluttered, and he smiled when he saw it was just Steve.
“Mm,” Steve sighed.  “Now,
Steve took in a deep breath, then let it out as Tony’s mouth traveled over his throat. “Tony,” he said, and his voice was a husky whisper. “Come with me.”
“And nothing,” Bruce said.  “He wouldn’t say anything.  At all, Tony.  He just sat there like a wax figure until they finally woke him up.”
. And it wasn’t like he’d never been hit on before. He had, and he knew how to turn that around, quickly and efficiently. It was part of the training. He didn’t really need training to turn people down, but it was nice to have anyway. He liked training. He liked rules. Rules. Guidelines. Policies. He didn’t need them to tell him not to date, though. He’d never really dated. Hadn’t had the time to. Hadn’t had the desire to. But now this kid. This kid and his full mouth and dark eyes. This kid who was
sitting around in the park, and hanging out at your house, and listening to music with you, and talking to you. I don’t think about ‘other people’ when we’re together, Steve. I don’t. All I think about when we’re together is you.”
Steve sat the flowers carefully down on the countertop and touched Tony’s forehead with his warm fingers, feeling for a temperature. The gentleness of it made Tony feel like crying. “Do you feel alright?” Steve asked. “You seem weird all of a sudden.”
Again. Customary.
He swallowed around Steve’s softening erection, sucking him through his orgasm, then pulled off.  Steve slid to the floor, breathing heavily, dazed and drained.  Tony took some time tucking himself away.  Had it been fifteen minutes yet?  He didn’t know.  Didn’t really care.  All he cared about right now was the tiny tilt of Steve’s lips, that look of satisfaction that always appeared on his face in the afterglow.
No answer.
“Are you sure he said Howard Stark?” he asked, the fact that he had asked his own mother almost that very same question three days ago, not lost on him.
“Anyone...special?”
“I should go,” he said.
Tony closed his eyes, listening as Steve went into the bathroom. He heard the shower start up, and allowed himself to drift while he waited for Steve to come back. It wasn’t difficult. It had never been difficult here. This had always been such a comfortable place. So easy. So warm. He had always felt good here. Like the person he wanted to be, and he wanted to feel that way again. He wanted to feel that way with Steve.
Steve stood up reluctantly. “I really am sorry.”
Tony reached up and curled his fist into Steve’s blond hair.  “That sounds like very important information that I need to have.”  He tugged the golden strands a little.  “Tell me everything.”
“Yeah?”
He’d been sitting here for a while now. Just sitting. Not thinking. Not dwelling on the fact that the folder filled with papers over there signalled the end of his marriage. Not dwelling on the fact that all of his shit was sitting boxed up in the front foyer waiting for tomorrow morning and the slew of movers who were coming to truck it away to a storage unit. Not dwelling on the fact that his daughter wasn’t here with him right now, and that was good, because if she had been, he would have had to put on a happy face to
Then he looked back at Tony. “Son. It’s time we went home.”
“When’d you turn into a fortune cookie?”
He felt better. He was still tired, still worried, but not about Tony. Not about their future. In fact, now his worries about that seemed totally unfounded and a little silly.
And if there was ever a time Tony thanked god she liked Steve better than him, it was right that second.
Steve swallowed.  “Just the one other thing.”
that Tony had suggested.  Just his name.  As if they were equals.  As if they were
“Tony,” he began, then cleared his throat. His eyes were downcast, almost shy. “Tony, will you stay?”
“Yes, we were excruciatingly civil and used only our words, right, Cap?” Tony said, tipping Steve a wink.
“Yeah,” Tony said, “but what does that
“It’s not that I don’t want to tell you,” he said, as she walked away.  “But there are legalities involved.  If he was staying at the Sanctum, I’d just tell you, because he’d be there as a friend and a guest in my home.  But this is a hospital.  I don’t own it.  Technically, I don’t even work there.  I’m just a consulting physician.  They have their rules and regulations they need to follow.”
“You do?”
Tony got to his feet and walked to where Bruce and Sam stood, watching the two on the porch.  No one spoke, not even a bird cried, as if knowing this moment was sacred.  It was peace, love, friendship defined, and even when Natasha rose up higher on her knees and kissed him, Tony did not feel jealous.  Instead, he felt uplifted, honored to be here to witness this coming together of two people he loved so much.
“Nope. It was Mays. No question.”
Steve’s eyes met his in the mirror.  He cocked an exasperated eyebrow at Tony’s reflection.  “Still, Tony?”
He loves me.
I knew you were crazy, but I had no idea you were stupid.  No wonder Erskine gave up on you.”
Tony closed his eyes, put a shaking hand to his mouth and rubbed his lips.
He stripped his clothes off and got into bed.  It was a spartan room.  Tony had tried the TV last night, and it didn’t even work anymore.
Tony stepped closer and tipped his finger at Steve’s face. “You’re a blusher. It happened earlier too.” He laughed again. There was nothing mean to it. It was friendly and sweet, with a flirtatious lilt to it that made Steve feel a little weak in the knees. “I wasn’t trying to shock you, I just had to see it again.”
My boss is the most sweet-tempered man in the world, but I think even HE would have to fire me if I started saying "Fuck you!" to customers trying to get my attention, no matter how nicely I said it.
Sometimes.
At least it wasn’t raining.
Tony shook his head.  “Hey.  No, no, no, baby, that’s not going to happen.  He can’t take anything away from us.  Okay?  Nobody can.  Nothing we’re not willing to give up.”  He shook him softly again by his hair.  “And I’m not willing to give
“Pfft. That sleepover is not optional. It’s mandatory.”
“I don’t know,” Steve shrugged. “Morgan thought pancakes were yucky.”
Steve slid his arms around Tony’s waist.  “Come on,” he said, nuzzling the base of Tony’s throat.  “It was a little funny.”
Bucky’s brow furrowed.  “You sure?”  He took a step closer, lifted his head a little, unconsciously--and symbolically--baring his throat.  “It’s okay, you know.”  That little smile again, but this time it stayed, sad and understanding.  “I deserve it.  And no one would ever know.”
Steve fell back a step, taking in shallow, shaky breaths.
“Perfect.”  Tony signed the twenty with a flourish and gave it to the kid.  “There.  Now you’re not accepting money, you just got an autograph.  How’s that?”
Steve cracked an eye open.  Tony was looking at him, his glasses flashed with reflected light from his tablet.  Steve rubbed his eyes.
“Yeah. You are.”
help?”
He exhaled as he did his countdown thing.  One.  Two.  Three.  Four.  Five.
“Hey.  Hey, big guy, you gotta let me up.”
“Yeah,” he said, squeezing her hand. “Yeah. Tony. And Morgan.”
“I don’t think that’s true.”
“I know.”
“Here he comes,” Steve said, and Tony nodded.
Tony smiled a little.  “Just curious.”
“Oh, fucking
“So much, baby,” Tony said, drawing him down to kiss him again. “I want you so fucking much.”
, it's sexy," Steve muttered, but he lifted his chin a little, giving Tony easier access to his neck.
Tony put his arm around him and squeezed his shoulder when Steve leaned into him.  They both missed the sly, knowing look that passed between Bruce and Clint.
Steve looked at Tony’s hand on his arm. Touched it absently. “Thad,” he whispered.
Tony watched the exam, watched him take blood, then listened as Strange lectured Steve on vitamins, exercise, and diet.  Steve didn't mention that when he'd overdone it, then tried to take a pre-dinnertime walk the week before, he'd almost passed out on the side of the road.  Tony didn't mention it either. In fact, he kept silent through the entire appointment. He just sat, holding Steve's hand when he could, trying to concentrate.  It was harder than it should have been. He kept finding himself distracted by hating Stephen Strange.
He stopped as his eyes cleared, as they lit on Tony.
“Uh-huh,” Tony said, getting to his feet. “I see how it is now.” He nudged Steve in the shoulder. Right where his lips had been only a few minutes before. “You’d better be planning on making this up to me later.”
“And Fury wanted blueprints for...something?”
happy.”
And still no answer.
One a.m.
“Pretty baby,” Tony murmured, then pressed on his shoulder. “Lie down for me, huh? Let’s get you comfortable.”
At first, it was gentle. Just their mouths. Just a soft brush of a hand through silky blond hair. A parting of lips, then the shy touch of a tongue. It was different than anything Tony had ever experienced. Partly because physically, Steve was just
But then Steve was looking at him.  Steve was breathing his name, and he smiled.
And then he was breathing deeply and steadily again, sleeping against Steve’s chest, his heart matching Steve’s beat for beat.  Steve stayed awake for a little longer, enjoying the sensations of Tony’s breath, his minute movements, the smell of him, the feel of him.
“Yes,” she breathed.  “Thor and Carol and Tony, they brought down lightning and repulsor blasts, and whatever it is that Carol has.  Steve channeled it with the axe and aimed it at
The couch was fairly low to the ground, and he slid on and off it with the ease of any man, impaired or not, doing the same task.  The bed, however, was higher, the table set at an awkward angle.  Tony had planned on asking Steve about it when they’d gotten here, having him try it out, then decide what he wanted done with the furniture to make it the most comfortable transition possible.  But when WWIII and the Great Living Room Decampment happened, it had become a moot point.  He wished now he had just moved the table out himself.
“No.  But, I have to, FRI.”
“No. I don’t.”
Clint sighed and lowered his arrow.  “Why do you have to be so fucking reasonable?”
“But I wanted you,” Steve went on softly. He touched Tony’s head, ran his hand through his hair. “I mean, I always want you, but I

"If you think we should tone it down a little-"
thought about it.  I’ve thought about it a lot, actually.  And do you know what I really think?”
"If he dies, I swear to god I'll kill you," she said, and Steve nodded.
Steve tore his eyes away from the portal and hugged her tight.  “Let Tony take care of you, okay?  Eat Thai food.  Play Xbox.  Listen to his stupid stories.  Okay?”
“You’re shaking.”
--that all their lives had just
"The three of you worked this out?  When?"
“You--”
“I guess.”
“Promise me, Steve.  I want your word.”
All of a sudden, he hated it.
Tony gave her a smile, glancing at the mirror himself. He’d been right. The girl was no longer occupying her own chair. She’d taken up residence in her boyfriend’s lap. “The food was fine,” he said, then gave Bruce a nudge. He looked at him, startled. “The in-flight entertainment was even better, right, Bruce?”
Tony smiled.
every time they were together and didn’t think about at all when they weren’t. And later, when they were in bed, and Steve was holding him down by the neck and fucking him into the mattress just the way Pietro liked, and Pietro was saying his name over and over, Steve tried so hard to convince himself--again--that the next ten years were as important as the last ten. That he had something to look forward to that equaled his reasons for looking back. Telling himself that the reality of Pietro was as important to him as the memory of Tony.
Tony sat up and ran a hand through his hair.  Regret was not a cure for desire, but they didn’t mix well either.  It was like oil and water coursing through his veins.  “Steve,” he said.  “Wait.  Don’t go.”
The Grand Canyon was everything. Sarah cried when they looked over the edge.
“You don’t need to be there for that?”
“It looked like a good date.”
Tony slipped his arms up around Steve’s neck and pulled him closer. He kissed him softly, then put his lips next to his ear. “Do you want to be inside me?”
“I’ll take some of the credit,” he relented, “but she really is mostly Pepper.”
He was checking the fridge for half-and-half and eggs when there was a knock on the door.
too into this superhero shit.”
Steve laughed in the back of his throat. “Is this about Clint? You know he was just joking, right? He’s happy for us.”
He didn’t really have the words to say that, though. It seemed too hard, too strange a question to ask someone--
“-you a cab?”
Even sitting in his bed wearing ridiculous flannel pajamas with a monogram over the pocket--the Rosses seemed very fond of the old monograms--he looked like he was at a board meeting.  “No,” he said.  “I don’t see what that would gain me.”
“I’m not a member of your Stark Tower frat house, Tony.  You must have me confused with someone else.”
“That science-y shit could save your life some day,” Tony said.
Steve laughed.  “You’d better not forget.  Four pints of your blood, was it?”
“I love that story,” she purred against Steve’s chest.
“Doctor Strange,” Steve said, standing to shake his hand.  “Thank you.  You’ve done so much.  Thank you.”
“Just another minute.”
Steve eyed the addition, lingering over the two storeys, the glass walkway.  “You’ve been busy.”
“Tony.”
Why did Tony have to just
“You don’t think much about being happy when you’re a kid, do you, Stark?” Bucky asked.  His eyes had taken on a sort of cloudy look, dreamy.  Tony could almost see him replaying some childhood memory behind those eyes.  He wished he could see it behind his own.  “You’re either happy or you’re not, and you just go with it because that’s what kids do.  They adapt.”  Bucky looked at the floor.  “But when you get older, sometimes it’s
Sam fiddled with the closures on the suit, his face constricted with worry.  Steve muttered, twisting his head.  The pulse in his neck jumped and stuttered.  “How do you--?”
aware of what he is.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he said, turning away, turning back into the shadows. He picked up her glass of champagne and threw it back, coughing at the bubbles tickling his nose and throat. He retreated further into the corner. It was dark here. Safe. he closed his eyes.
he frowned on them, although Steve remembered a time when he had thought it was sexy. A long time ago now. He still kind of missed smoking. But that was okay. He’d rather have a happy Tony than a cigarette any day.
“No way. You’re not getting out of it that easily.”
Steve ducked his head. “Sorry. I didn’t mean it that way.”
Steve put his head on Tony's chest, held him tight.  His tears were hot and steady. He cried for a long time, and Tony sat with him, his arms wrapped around him, loving him through it, thinking about how much he loved him, how much he'd always loved him, how much he
They both did.
Steve shrugged, a small, disappointed lift and fall of his shoulders, a pout lingering around his mouth.
Then an image flashed in his head.  “Daisies,” he said.  “We keep daisies on the table all the time.”
Tony stood and helped Steve to his feet. Steve didn’t let go of his hand as Tony opened the door and led him inside the apartment.
“We’d all fit.”
He looked up as Tony came nearer and sat on the side of the bed. Tony brushed his fingers over Steve’s cheek, touched his neck. “Feeling a little better?” he asked.
“I’m not throwing him-” Tony began, then reconsidered. “Okay, maybe I was a little. But you saw him tonight. He was acting all weird.”
“Are you sure?” he teased, putting his fingers back to work, letting them trace Steve’s full mouth again, letting one of them breach his lips, then slipping back out before Steve could do more than tongue at the pad. “I mean, I can go out and get laid by somebody else first, real quick, if you want.” He arched an eyebrow. “You
He woke up to Steve wiping his stomach with a warm, damp cloth. He kept his eyes closed, humming a little as Steve bent and kissed him, then when the bed dipped beside him, Tony automatically rolled toward Steve and curled up against his side. Steve put his arm around him, holding him.
Tony put a finger under Steve's chin and lifted his head just enough to look into his eyes. "I really am happy, you know," he said softly.
Thor eyed him speculatively for a moment, then shook his head, breaking the spell that had seemed to hold them both in thrall.  “You’ll join us in the morning, yes?” he asked.
Sam’s voice was laced with concern, but it was firm.  “Sorry, Tony, but did you?  He came over here today, and there’s something wrong.”
Tony nodded.  Suddenly, he was tired too.  He had a bad feeling he’d done something wrong, and he wasn’t quite sure what it had been.  Sure, coming to pick him up had not been the plan, but surely Steve had known somewhere inside that head of his that Tony would show up.  Sure, he wasn’t supposed to know, but he found things out.  Nobody could keep anything from him.  Steve knew that.  Sure, it probably wasn’t what he’d had in mind when Tony brought him here to the home they’d shared, but Steve had to have guessed he’d end up here.  Right?  And that Tony had changed it all while he’d been gone?  Right?
was a wonder to behold.
Tony shoved that thought away fast.
“Yup. Birthday-sex is traditional couple stuff. You know that.”
“No, I wasn’t,” Tony agreed. “But Bucky was. He told me.”
He had a dimple. Just one, on his right cheek. Steve wasn’t sure what to think about it, but the guy was pretty determined to show it off--he kept smiling at Steve like he really did think he was funny. Or something. He smelled kind of good too. Not like Tony. Nobody smelled as good as Tony. But good. Like citrus and sandalwood, and when he leaned closer, Steve breathed it in, unable to help himself.
Tony shook his head, ran an incredulous hand through his hair. “Do you have any idea who you sound like right now?” he asked.
I’m--we’re--divorced.”
Just some guy.
; Tony didn’t even pretend to reach for the check--paid and they left.  She laid down a fifty for the tip, hoping that would soothe at least some of the hurt feelings.
Another half-chapter. Because I can only seem to do things half-way lately:(
“Yeah,” he answered.  “Yeah, Tony.  I always do.  You were still mostly asleep, but yeah, of course, I did.”
“Incapacitated at the moment.”
His voice was quiet, his eyes moved restlessly, picking out mundane things and turning them into something fantastical.  She was silent, and he was just getting ready to ask again, when she spoke, her voice as hushed as his own.  “Captain Rogers is in the bedroom.  Be careful, boss.  He isn’t himself.”
“Could have fooled me,” Tony said.  “You never answered any of my letters.”
He drummed his fingers on his thigh.  It was so
Steve started to say yes, then changed his mind. He wasn’t hungry. “No. Just coffee, I guess.”
Maybe just one more time. Just in case.
the same thing.”
thing you’ve got in your head. Not happening.”
He smoothed his hand down over his abdominals, feeling the ridges of muscle under his fingers, ran his nails up Steve’s side, then paused before brushing his nipple.
“Twenty-nine, sir.”
“No,” Steve said, and leaned back against the bar. He flicked his gaze to Josh, then back to Tony. “You go. I’ll just watch you.” Tony’s hand was still on his arm. Steve had not touched him, had not even made an attempt other than the prematurely-terminated hug, but now he let his thumb graze along the smooth, delicate skin on the underside of Tony’s arm. Tony drew in a sharp breath at the touch, but he didn’t move away. “I’ll be here when you’re done.”
He called her number from memory. He’d seen Bucky call her a lot, and it stuck in Steve’s head, filed away with Mr. Barker’s and the pizza place he and his mother had ordered from so many times over the years.
“I’m not being a drama queen.  It’s just before the serum, before
Tony frowned. “Your date…?” he said, then closed his eyes, letting his head fall back. “Oh, fuck.” Tony’s arms were still around Steve, but now he loosened his grip enough to try and catch his downcast eyes. “You’re talking about me, right?” he asked.
Tony nodded.  “Is that a problem?”
“Complete deactivation sequence, please.”
could tell, too.  Apparently, he has an issue with the gay-thing.”
Steve nodded. “Yeah,” he said, his eyes far away. “I remember that night.”
“Well,” Tony said in a voice tinged with sadness. “It’s a nice thought, anyway.”
“What else?  Has anything changed?”
Steve huffed out short laughter. “That’s because it was
“Sometimes.”
He smiled as he washed his hands at the sink.  That idea was always a good one.  Appealing.  Enticing.  Hot.  They’d done a lot since that first time, using their hands and their mouths to get each other off.  They still hadn’t gotten to the main event, however.  Steve was getting better, stronger every day, and Tony was okay with waiting.  He wanted to be able to fully enjoy it when it did finally happen, without worrying that Steve was in any kind of pain.  And he wanted Steve to enjoy it.  Wanted his first experience to be perfect.  Wanted to build on the beautiful, heady, hot foundation they’d already laid.  Not like Tony’s own first time.  Not like the drunken, alley-way fuck behind a Chinese restaurant in mid-town with some nameless preppie frat-boy who could barely get it in and smelled like beer and Old Spice, panting in Tony’s ear, “You wanted this all night, didn’t you?  Wanted daddy so bad, didn’t you?”
alone.”
Steve was frowning a little. Just a little. Like he was worried about something, worried, maybe, about just what the fuck Tony was doing here. “Hey?” turning it into a cool, polite question.
“You’re right, sir.  I’m sorry.”
“Fine,” Tony said, throwing the bit of paper back down onto the table.  He picked up his coffee.  It was almost gone, and if his hand shook the tiniest bit, no one would ever notice.  “You don’t want to take ‘em, don’t take ‘em.”
“Yeah.  Now get over here.”
“Thanks, Bruce.”
“Yeah.  It’s been a month.  It’ll be good to see him.”
Steve sat up, rubbed his face with his hand. “I don’t know. Mom just said he was here.”
“I didn’t break in,” Steve said breathlessly.  “I used my code.  Bend your knee again, Tony.  More.  Right there.  Don’t move.  If you didn’t want me to use it, you would have deactivated it.”
“I mean he needs a friend.”
He dreamed of Steve.
“Get outta here,” Steve said, and Tony did. Easily slipping over the rail and climbing back down the side of the building. Steve watched him go, not even thinking that he should have invited him in through the window to just go out his door. Because
“There now, was that so hard?”  He shook his head, laughing under his breath.  “If that’s how you ask someone out, no wonder you’re still single.”
“Tony,” Pepper said evenly.
She laughed again as he walked away.  Tony rolled his eyes.  “That guy is such a dick.”
the ones I’m afraid of.  Because none of you will open your eyes.  None of you will see.”
“You okay?” Tony asked beside him.
"What the fuck was that?"
“But, I was just thinking about what I said earlier,” he said, and Tony slid off his lap with a groan. He collapsed on his back on the couch, arms spread wide, defeat writ large on his face. Steve laughed and grabbed his arm to haul him back up. “As I was saying,” he began, and Tony groaned again. “I know it’s your birthday this weekend, and you’ve probably already got plans, but-”
“Steve?” Awake now. Just like that.
Tony thought of Ross.  Of the one other thing they had agreed to.  The one truly personal thing that Tony had insisted upon before their deal was complete.
Maybe completely and utterly different was exactly what he needed.
“No,” he said firmly.  His voice was rising.  He didn’t want that.  Didn’t want to yell at poor, sweet, mostly innocent Bruce.  But, he couldn’t help it.  “
," he said through gritted teeth.  "But ‘doctor’ does not equal ‘hospitalization’ anymore, Steve.  Millions of people see therapists.  I see one.  I’ve been going for years, twice a week, Tuesday and Thursday 1:30 pm.   And if he hasn’t put me in the hospital, you’re definitely in the clear.”
and any kind of future together.  He’d deactivated Steve’s access code, and then he’d hibernated for two weeks.  When he emerged, it was April, and the promise of spring had become the reality of it.
“That’s ridiculous,” Strange retorted.
He let him have the good seat next to the window in home-room because he heard there was a dog running around out in the parking lot and he hoped that Tony would see it.
He turned on his side and grabbed his phone off the bedside table. He had programmed Nat’s number into it after the first night they’d had dinner, and a moment later her phone was ringing in his ear.
“Please.”
“You sure? You look like you just saw a ghost.”
have a good memory.”
He stopped when he heard a giggle from the doorway.
“I know.”
Tony’s shoulders slumped.
Howard squeezed his nape gently. “Is this about the Rogers boy?” he asked.
“So, there’s this thing called paper.  And these
“That’s probably true.”
Tony slipped his arm around Steve’s waist and pulled him closer, until they were pressed together, his other hand still on Steve’s cheek. “What can I do?” he asked.
“And that’s why you
“Steve, what happened back there, it’s--”
He woke up feeling groggy and still tired. He hadn’t slept much. His dreams had been plagued by a still very naked Steve, only this time he wasn’t taking a casual dip in the pool, but lying in Tony’s bed, eyes half-closed, lashes fluttering against his cheekbones, hands fisting in the silk sheets, moaning, the sound coming from someplace in the back of his throat. The same place his little laugh always came from. The laugh that put Tony on his metaphorical knees every single time he heard it. And speaking of being on his knees...that seemed to be exactly where dream-Tony was. On his knees, between Steve’s thighs, taking him deep in his throat, and if
“No,” he said. “No, don’t. Everything’s okay, remember?”
Tony bumped his shoulder against his arm again. “That’s more like it.”
Steve laughed again and gave him a shove. “Get off me,” he grumbled, a blush starting to crawl out of the collar of his sweater.
Steve pulled away from him. He bent over and grabbed Tony’s t-shirt from the floor. “Put this on,” he said gruffly and scrubbed a hand over his face. He didn’t look Tony in the eye, let them hover only as far up as his collarbone. “Let her in.”
last. It couldn’t. There were too many other things. Too much of the other stuff. The outside stuff. Stuff that had little to do with
Steve laughed, ran his hand through Tony’s hair, down his side, and grabbed the blanket. He pulled it up over both of them. “Yeah, but maybe not right now. You’re asleep.”
Steve’s face softened at that, and he took a step closer to Tony. Placed one large hand on his hip. Tony almost swooned in relief.
Steve had another lapse after lunch.
He looked up, his eyes blazing, and Tony drew in a sharp breath and closed his teeth over his lip. A flutter of fear and deep, hidden want shivered through him, but he shoved it down, back into whatever hole it had come from. “That-” he began, then let out a breath, wiped his mouth, and tried again. “That’s not what he meant, Steve.”
She stepped forward, letting go of Tony’s hand and looking shyly up at Steve. “Can-” she began, then paused, and started again. “
you got your toothbrush?”
Ross stood up.  “Captain Rogers, nothing would please me more.”
“Yes, sir.”
Tony knew what he probably looked like.  Mud, dirt on his clothing, hair a mess, blood covering his face from the mean, but shallow cut across his cheekbone.  Bruises in the shape of Steve’s large, well-loved hands, hands that had held him, stroked him, loved him so many times, beginning to show up on his throat.
“I don’t know,” Tony said lightly, running the length of the tie--that goddamn red
“Did I wake you, Mr. Stark?”
Tony snorted.  “I think this is a much more appropriate venue for this chat, Thad.”
“I don’t know,” Tony said, and he hoped he sounded more convincing than he thought he did. Because he knew exactly what he would have said.
Steve shook his head, smiling the fakest smile Tony had ever seen. Well, almost ever. The one he’d flashed him at Nat and Bucky’s wedding still held that top honor. “We’ve kept you too long. It was nice seeing you though.” He reached out and touched Tony’s arm with a light touch. Just the lightest, softest touch. “You should go see Mom,” he said. “She’d love to see you.” He glanced at Morgan. She smiled up at him. “Meet your little girl. Your...wife.” He nodded. “Yeah. She’d like that.”
“All you can drink.”
“I’m fine,” Steve insisted. He wasn’t. But Jack didn’t need to know that. He could fake it. He could
He did smile at that, and his heart felt a little lighter. “I don’t give a damn what they think.”
with somebody. I knew,” she sighed, “there would never--
“Tony-”
“It would have been a hell of a lot easier on him if he’d just walked away.  But he didn’t.  He stayed.  And he kept sticking up for me, and he kept protecting me, and when my mom--he was all I had.”
a little, okay?”
“Come to the office.  You don’t have to pay me, but I’ll let you buy me lunch.”
“Daddy, I can’t sleep.”
They went out and got into Tony’s car. It wasn’t the same car, but it felt the same having Steve sitting beside him. So much the same, that he almost reached out and took his hand. He didn’t. He caught himself at the last second. But, it felt strange
He balked when Steve tried to pay him.
“Thanks,” he said.
“I think we should reactivate Captain Rogers’ access code.”
Tony’s heart stopped, then skipped ahead, almost missing a beat.  He laughed helplessly.  “Did you just say what I think you just said?”
Steve came down to the shop later. He had his laptop under his arm, a stack of books in his hands with a bowl of sliced fruit balanced on top.
“Lots of stuff.”
Tony kissed his cheek and patted his arm.  “I don’t kiss and tell, baby,” he said.  “It’s tacky.  Rhodey!  What’s this I hear about you threatening to shoot my door down?”
Tony let it spin out, then spoke again.  “Are you okay in there?  Can I get you anything?  A glass of water?”
“Okay?”
“They’ll have more information for you outside, sir.”
“No, Tony. No. Let me finish.”
,” he said.  “I know you hate it when I say that, but it’s true.  Don’t you see that?  You come from here, you belong here, your problems are ones they know how to deal with.  What doctor knows how to deal with me, Tony, huh?  How do they help a guy who was dead for seventy years then brought back to life and told to fit in?  Everybody I know is dead.  Everything I know is either gone or completely different.  It’s not even fair to ask a doctor to try and help me.  It’d be like asking a ten-year-old to do brain surgery.”
Steve sniffed, wiped his nose with the back of his hand.
“I get it,” Natasha said, her voice a little broken. Steve tightened his grip on her. “Sometimes it’s best to just keep it to yourself.” She turned to him and smiled a brave smile. “Isn’t it?”
Steve laughed a little, but kept the frown. “I don’t know. After how I acted at the coffee stand, I didn’t even know if you’d show up today.”
Tony coasted to a stop, and Steve opened the door and got out. He looked around at the tall trees, the meadow of wildflowers just getting their full bloom in this late-May morning, the sandy beach, the dock leading out into the lake itself. Steve didn’t think he had ever seen anything quite as beautiful in his entire life. He’d been out of the city a few times, sure, but this felt like another world. A quiet, peaceful world that was sacred and soft around the edges. A world where no one hurt, and there were no wars that needed to be fought. No angry, condescending parents. No worries, no fears, just a chance for harmony and the gentle lapping of the lake on the beach.
Then he left.
Steve shrugged.  “At least we got here.”
Steve thought wildly--from the city outside, from the very air he breathed.  And from himself.  Because it was his thought, too.  More than a thought.  A knowledge so basic and yet so divine it was as if it was carved into his bones.
They rode up the elevator to the common floor.  Once there, they’d go their separate ways and the night would end.  Tomorrow, Pepper would be back in town, or Rhodey or Sam would come over.  There’d be a mission--or two, or ten--that needed to be fought.  Clint and Natasha would come back, Vision and Wanda would show up.  In short, life would go on just like it always had.  And that would be good, but this, this quiet evening with just the two of them had been good, too.
Tony nudged him with his shoulder.  “Do I have a car here?” he chided playfully.  “I’m not some fucking pedestrian, Steve.  Come on.”
He watched as Steve was guided away.  As the sheriff opened the back door of his cruiser.  Ross stood off to one side.  He looked rather pleased with the whole situation, watching the show like it was a tent-pole movie premiere and he was the star.
He understood that reference.
“I didn’t think…” He kissed him again--comfort like a wave--then laughed softly into his mouth. “I’m sorry,” he said. “I’m sorry I made you feel like you were reading the signals wrong. I’m sorry I didn’t realize
Tony groaned and pushed himself closer to Steve’s chest. “You have never been hotter than you are right this second.”
“Yeah,” Steve said, his head now moving up and down, unconsciously. Funny. He hadn’t
Steve.  He didn't even remember it.”
afraid of that.
“It wasn’t really a compliment.”
“Don’t worry, honey,” Nat said.  “There’s nothing to be nervous about.”
“I asked if you’d heard anything from Nat.  Can we count on her?”
”  He closed his eyes.
Steve leaned up and kissed Tony’s mouth softly.  “Thank you for saying that,” he said.  “But I still don’t want it.  I just want to forget it.  Please, Tony?  Just...Just get rid of it.”
Tony had seen a couple of Steve’s history test-sheets before, but usually they were bloodied with his teacher’s merciless red pen, hacking away at all Steve’s wrong answers. It had seemed gleeful in a way, all those red slashes and hastily-scribbled words like
something harder.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed, and a huge weight seemed to have lifted off his shoulders. He glanced back at Steve, then squeezed Sam’s shoulder and let him go. “I’ll see you later.”
Steve lifted the cigarette, looked at it dully, then lowered it again.  “Yeah.”
blank.  If he thought, he
,” Steve said, the corner of his mouth lifting into a tiny smile. “I meant, Tony,
At the end of the path was a little wooded area where Dr. Banner sometimes took his classes. He said it was to study the natural world around them, and maybe that was part of it, but Steve kind of thought Dr. Banner just liked being out of the classroom. He always seemed a little calmer when they were out there. A little easier in his skin.
Steve laughed, not even minding the “Rogers”.  It sounded different when Tony was this close.  “Super-serum, super-memory.”
When his movie-watching eye started to droop, he turned it on his friends instead. Clint was in the chair, and Tony was gratified to see that he was almost asleep himself. Nat was curled up on the couch with Bruce beside her. Her head was resting comfortably on his thigh, but in spite of that, and the soft blankets and pillows around them, he looked very stiff. Very formal. Tony frowned. That was weird.
carrying an umbrella, so it didn’t do much damage.
Tony drug a patio chair close to Steve’s and plopped down into it, propping his feet up on the railing.  “You should have come and gotten me.”
Tony let his head fall back. He knotted one hand in Steve’s hair. The other scrabbled uselessly, thoughtlessly against the wood of the door behind him. He felt like all reason had deserted him. All higher functions. Ego? Superego? Fuck ‘em. He was all id now. Cavorting and clamoring for instant gratification, shouting out its desires in full voice.
“No,” he insisted, and slipped his arm around Pietro’s waist and pulled him closer. “There wasn’t anyone else. There wasn’t. I told you. I would never do that to you.”
Steve tugged him. “Come here,” he said, and Tony came. He was reluctant at first, but as soon as Steve put his arms around him, he melted against his chest.
,” he whispered, stroking his sweat-damp hair.  “I’ll always love you.  It’ll always be you and me.  No matter what happens.  I’ll never love anyone the way I love you.”
Tony folded Steve’s letter and slid it back into the envelope he’d put it in, and set it on the nightstand.  He put his tablet next to it, and switched off his lamp.
Sarah held onto Tony, grasping his arm tightly. She held Dodger’s leash in her other hand.
doing this--I don’t want to be on the fringes of your life. I want to be
He sighed out a breath, and pushed himself against Tony a little more before stepping away. “Yeah,” he agreed.
"Closer."
Steve laughed, his thumb began to move, slipping across his hip in soft, small arcs.  “Same old Tony,” he said.  “You’ll never change, will you?”
else.  Steve had to do it his way.  He had to keep that goddamn soldier’s pride intact.  Nevermind that Wanda had come thousands of miles.  Nevermind that Nat had compromised her relationship, and Bruce had compromised his standards and his reputation.  Nevermind that Tony was falling apart.  At least Steve had his pride.  At least that was still whole.
Steve had parked the car down the block, and when they reached it, Tony automatically went for the driver's seat. Then he remembered, and retreated to the passenger side. He wasn't in the driver's seat tonight. Steve was. And he still looked pissed.
"Tony."
“Yeah, but there’s a lot going on in the world. The Middle East. What if you have to go to war?”
He still puttered around the house a little.  He did the dishes, and made breakfast, and at night, would watch tv for an hour before going to brush his teeth, but mostly, he was outside.
Tony drank his coffee, then shook his own head.  “That’s not true,” he scoffed.  “I hated you when we first met.”
Tony laughed.  “Baby, I haven’t come that hard since I was thirty.”
“See?” Steve said. “That’s what I mean. The best thing in the whole world. And you never would have broken up with me, would you?”
--in common. That hadn’t meant much when they were kids, but it meant something now. Now, it meant a lot. It meant the world.
Steve sat up, stripped his shirt over his head and tossed it into the corner, then helped Tony take his off. When it was gone, he leaned down and kissed his chest, tongued his nipple, bit into his side.
, Steve belonged to
apologizing to
“Really? You don’t want me to…?”
Steve ducked his head further, but he was smiling, his pale Irish skin, pink.  “I don’t know.  Maybe.”
Tony stopped again.  “Watch?  Your sessions?”
Tony smiled to himself.  He hadn't been fishing for a compliment, but he wasn't going to turn it down, either.
Rhodey slid behind the wheel of his car and put his sunglasses on.  Tony ran a finger over the curve of the hood.  “Nice ride,” he said as Rhodey turned the key.  The engine purred into  life.
“No.”
“Yeah. It is,” Steve said. He broke off another piece of his muffin, but he didn’t put it into his mouth. He just crumbled it onto the napkin it was sitting on. “Why are you here? I've never seen you in the treatment room," Steve said, but now that they were up close, Steve could see that hollow look around his eyes. Could see now, that his hair might not technically be his own. Steve wasn't
“Don’t look at those,” Steve said in a bashful way that made Tony cock an eyebrow at him.
“Of course, I am.”
he was his best friend--and Steve didn’t want to upset him. Didn’t want to hurt him. “Sorry,” he said. “Sorry, Sam. I’ve just got a lot on my mind.”
Sam laughed. “Dude. Don’t. I’ve got chemistry, and trig, and physics to deal with this year. I’m pretty much fucked no matter what I do.”
“Don’t know if I want to talk about it right now,” he said finally.
Steve sighed in relief. “Are you sure?”
When he jerked awake the second time, he didn’t hesitate. He just rolled toward Tony and fit himself around him, holding him against his chest. Tony hummed pleasantly and reached back to touch him.
She slammed out the door and was gone.
“Yes.”
“Did you ask
Tony nodded again but this time, he lifted his head. He cupped the back of Steve’s neck, and brought their mouths together in a gentle, lingering kiss. “Okay,” he agreed.
Steve drug one eye to half-mast. Tony’s skin was silk beneath his cheek, and he really didn’t want to lift his head, so he didn’t. “I’ve been hated by somebody or other for the better part of a century,” he rumbled, kissing Tony’s stomach. “I’m used to it.”
Tony sighed and smiled sadly.  “I’m really not.  You know, I get that you don’t want to feel like you’re one of my ‘causes’,” he said, looking into the sea-blue depths of Steve’s eyes, “but the thing is, baby, I kind of like being one of yours.”
“Daddy’s cooking,” she said into his stomach.
Tony turned helplessly to Wanda.  “Do something,” he said.  “Do it.  Work your magic, witchy woman.”
“He’s not coming back.”
Steve shook his head.  “Goddamnit, Tony,” he muttered.  “I deliberately didn’t make anything because you said you’d bring dinner.”
“Thanks,” Tony said.  “Call me, or come over, or whatever.  Pepper’s access code will get you in.  I’ll tell FRIDAY.”
“‘Bout how it felt the other night when you kissed me,” Steve said, his hand moving over his cock, teasing the head with his thumb, using the gathering wetness to ease his way. “How your mouth tasted. How much I wanted to get down on my knees right there in the kitchen and taste you again for real.”
say?” Steve asked sharply, leaning forward over the table.
looked like scribbles.  He tapped Steve’s book.  “But I still want this.  Okay?”
“I love you, too.”
“Colonel Rhodes is asking for you in the 60th floor conference room.”
“Yeah,” Steve agreed. “You can talk to me until I fall asleep.”
The car slowed--115.  110. 100. 90. 80. 70.  An almost sedate 60. It was still way too fast to take the curve, but he did it.
Steve let out a breath, relaxing under Tony, sinking into the mattress.  “Yeah,” he said.  “That’s better.”
“Everything,” he said as if that said it all. Maybe it did.
“Hey,” Tony said in his ear.
“Come on, Steve, we should do our part--”
They stood looking at each other in the dim light, both of them thinking of someone else.
“Yeah,” Steve said bitterly. “Real fucking smart.”
“I don’t wanna take pills,” Steve said, his voice firm.  “You said it was just talking.  Nobody ever said I had to take drugs.”
“I don’t know why you’re surprised,” Steve said, hiding his smile in Tony’s hair. “
?” he asked through gritted teeth.
“It’s alright,” Steve said without missing a beat, and Tony wrapped his hands lightly around his throat, shaking him the slightest bit.
He thought Steve must feel the same way. Tony could feel him trembling.
“Oh yes, he does.  And they’re--”
Steve settled himself on the old black leather sofa against the wall. He spread his books on the coffee table, and situated his laptop directly in front of himself. He sat a couple of notebooks right next to the laptop, and laid three sharpened pencils on top of them. It had the air of ritual, and Tony, who stood watching, knew that was exactly what it was. Steve had always had his rituals. Going back to his Captain America days. They all had back then. Seeing Steve setting up his work station with such solemnity and formality tugged at Tony’s heart in a way nothing else did. Not that he wanted to go back to those days--he was happier now living this quiet life with Steve than he had ever thought he would be capable of--but the nostalgia was intense. The memories that nostalgia brought back, even more so.
“Okay,” Steve muttered and ran his hands through his hair. His desire for a cigarette was starting to become an intense
And that weight--that hand in his hair--that was real too.
you go.”
“Let’s find out,” Tony said, and gave him a playful shove.
Tony shrugged.  “Whichever one bans microwaved pizza.  I’m flexible.”
Steve stood up, and brushed his hands on his jeans. Not like it mattered. His jeans were as wet as Dodger’s fur had been. Dodger looked up at him, dancing on his paws, and Steve jerked his head. “Go on,” he said, and Dodger barked once and ran away, Morgan following, laughing and calling him.
Steve stepped into him, just like he'd done the night before, except now there was no door to stop them. They were heading in the right direction this time, Steve’s mouth on him, Tony swinging the door closed, but not stopping, letting Steve walk them to the bedroom with easy confidence, as if they had done it a thousand times before. And maybe they had. In Steve’s head, maybe they had.
Stane grunted again, but it seemed affectionate. Steve watched the exchange between them. He wasn’t the best at reading personal interactions, but theirs seemed familiar, genuine, and fond, like there
He wasn’t sure what roused him from sleep, all he knew was that he was grateful.  Asleep, he couldn’t feel the heavy, sweet weight that was Steve Rogers encompassing him.  Couldn’t feel his arm around him, his leg over him, trapping him in the most divine way imaginable.  Couldn’t feel Steve’s breath on his neck, slow, steady, even.  Couldn’t revel in the riot of happiness that existed inside just to be waking up in this bed with him still sleeping peacefully beside him.  That hadn’t happened in a long time.  Too long.  So, whatever had woken him was now his new hero.  His new best friend.
Steve’s arm came around him, his hand settling onto its old place on his hip.  Tony could hear the smile in his voice when he said, “I don’t have to pretend.  I like you.”
“Maybe he’s tired of thinking.”
Sixteen days. Sixteen days, and he still missed him.
“Boundaries?  Are you kidding me?  I can’t even count how many times you’ve burst in on me in the shower to show me cat videos or climbed into my bed in the middle of the night to spoon me.  Don’t talk to me about boundaries!”
Tony tried to ignore the sudden lance of pain through his heart.  Tried not to let it show on his face.
Steve let out a breath and took his foot off the gas pedal.  He'd had her at 120. He'd been sure. So fucking sure…
Steve flinched at the sarcasm that dripped like bitter honey from Tony’s words.  Hurt and guilt and shame rolled over him in waves.  A moment ago, he might have thought the answer to that question was edging into ‘yes’ again.  Clearly, he’d been wrong.  It wasn’t the first time, but at least if Thanos had his way, it would probably be the last.  Right now, that was almost a relief.  Right now, that was almost a comfort.
Tony smoothed his thumb under the delicate skin beneath his eye.  “Steve, baby, I’m sorry.”
“Always prepared, aren’t you?”
“I was at work-”
“Night-night,” she said, eyes already slipping shut, mouth growing slack with sleep.
Steve fell beside him, his knees squelching in the blood-soaked earth, eyes frantic but assessing, seeing the way things were, seeing everything. The blood, the seared flesh around the place where his arm had once been, the anguish on his face, the burns that covered the left side of his body. The blast had scorched his skin, singed his hair. His voice was loud, monotonous, his eyes squeezed shut as the pain ripped through his body. Steve saw it all. Everything. And he was sick. Sick, because his artist’s eye picked it all up, just as it had the mountains a moment ago--
the thought of private school. He knew he was destined for the Ivy League after graduation, and he wanted to spend as much time being a regular kid as he could before he was set on the path of the Ivies, followed by Stark Industries, followed by...death. Fifty cold years and three heart attacks later, if he was to follow in his father’s footsteps like the old man wanted.
“Seriously, Pep, like a hundred bucks a day?  Just to put up with me?  I’ll even give you weekends and Wednesdays off.”
He glanced at his own front door, but didn’t stop. Tony had been staying with Sarah upstairs, and that’s where he went, finding one last burst of energy to take the stairs two at a time.
There was a silence on Nat's end, and Steve let it play out.  Let her interpret it however she liked. If she wanted clarity, she'd ask.  At some point--maybe in a day, maybe in a year--she would ask, and he would tell her.  They'd done it for her too, after all. Her, and Bruce, and everyone else. The family.
She kissed his cheek. “See you soon?”
Steve pulled back, his fingers travelling to the button on Tony’s jeans.  “Three o’clock, huh?”
“Try explaining that to his wife,” Tony shouted, throwing his hand backward to where Jen was currently dancing with Sam.
Steve’s face wrinkled into a disappointed little frown. It was a double-edged sword, that frown. Because despite how sad it made Tony to see it, he thought it was absolutely adorable. Something that was half-pout, half-tease, and Tony was afraid he could get very attached to that. Might do things just to bring it about, not only so he could see it again, but so he could make it up to him afterward. Take him out. Buy him pretty things. Get down on his knees and beg for forgiveness.
“You’re lucky you’re hot.”
Tony led him down the hallway.  He’d had to jostle past Clint or Bruce or Rocket to get down this hall once.  He and Nebula had held intricate conversations about her mad father right here outside Thor’s door while the god lounged in the doorway, sometimes removing his artificial eye and wiping it carelessly on his shirt before popping it back into place.
“You have to keep it sharp.  It’s more dangerous when it’s dull.”
“She was asking about the light bill, and--”
Well, almost never.
Tony shifted until he felt his other instep against Steve’s foot.  “We’d had a fight.  Shocking, right?  It was totally my fault.  They usually are.”
to do anything, do you?  I’m on a hair-trigger all the time.  I'm like a goddamn teenager again.”
“Is it still snowing?” Tony asked.
“Whoops,” Nat said.
Tony smiled, and that was better. Better than better. “Okay. Good.”
“Why don’t you just go talk to him? Weren’t you guys friends?”
He bent and kissed her cheek.
The corner of his mouth lifted in a small, cat-like smile of satisfaction. “You’d find me again. Wouldn’t you?”
Clint raised his fist and gave him a happy thumbs-up.
“No,” Howard said and held up his hand. “No, Steven, please don’t apologize. It doesn’t matter. The party doesn’t matter. I-”
The corner of Steve’s mouth lifted in a tiny smile. “Arrested for what?” he asked.
Tony grinned.  “Who the fuck knows?”
Tony tilted his head from side to side, considering.  “I kind of think the Fifth covers that question too.”
Tears, all unbidden, filled his eyes, and he nodded. “Of course, I will,” he said. “I’d love that. I’d love to talk to her.”
he demanded, and then it was. Torn from his body, just like he’d wanted, one button flying across the room to ping against the closed window, the others hanging on, but not stopping Steve from stripping it away and dropping it like it was nothing but a scrap of fabric from an old dish towel. His undershirt went next, and then Steve’s hands were on him, moving over his chest, thumbing his nipples, digging into his sides, pulling him tight against Steve’s own bare chest while Steve finally tore his lips away to latch onto his neck, sucking on it, leaving an unmistakable mark in the shape of his mouth.
“I’m not shy,” Tony protested.  His mouth was dry.  He was hard.  His face flamed.  “I’m just not sure I want to get off in front of a whole room full of people.  Even
Steve rested his head on her shoulder. “Yeah,” he said. “I know. That’s how I got so good. Trying to learn how to beat you.”
Steve lay still, letting his thundering heartbeat slow to something approaching normal. He could hear Tony breathing in his ear. Could hear the sound of him moving on his bed-sheets. “I wish you were here,” Steve said softly. “Or I was there.” He paused, not wanting to go too far, but needing Tony to know how he felt. “I wish I could feel you right now.”
Steve laughed a little.  Softly. Sadly. "No, Tony.  That's not what I want for you.  Or for me. I was frozen once. I don't think I could do it again."
“Sleep,” Tony agreed. “Just sleep. We copulate this weekend.”
needed the Cayman Islands when they had Steve Rogers’s eyes so readily available?
Sam nodded again, and Tony got the distinct impression Sam knew exactly what he was feeling.  His dark eyes were kind, but there was also a touch of amusement in them.  Tony hated him a little, but felt his stomach flutter, too.
Steve shook his head. “No. No. I don’t want to be here. I want to go home.”
Steve had signed his name at the bottom.
Perfect face. Perfect body.
“I can’t,” he said, and Tony shoved him away.
They all sat at the conference room table, talking it out one last time.  After tonight, there would be no more talk.  The time for talk was over.
And maybe Steve had somehow caught his thought, because just then he glanced Tony’s way.
Tony laughed, but it wasn’t the laugh Steve was used to hearing. If you could call something that hadn’t happened in over three years--and even then just barely--something you could be
“Yeah,” he said. “Music.”
, Steve thought, and was thrilled in that moment that he thought things over before he said them. That would be cruel. Too cruel to do to Tony. To anyone. But especially Tony. Because it
He sat down and dialed in.
“I’ll get better.”
"We've known each other for-"
The tie flirted down the line of his back. “We could tie you up.” The silk tightened around his wrists. “Which would be good. Right? That’s what we talked about before, isn’t it?”
Steve stood with his shoulder pressed against his locker, history book in his hand, shuffling through the pages with quick, nimble fingers.
“Ich-Ich Nehme dir--” Wanda said, and Tony’s blood ran cold.
By the next morning, Tony knew what he had to do.  The fact that he had actually known about two minutes after Steve told him about the light, and he just suppressed it, pissed him off.  But he’d do it.  For Steve, he’d do it.
Sam squeezed his shoulder. “He’s right. If they’re offering her another night, take it.”
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and tucked his face into his neck. “I’m glad.”
Steve grunted, but kissed his hand again, letting his mouth and tongue linger over his fingers.
But here he was.
A couple days later, Tony woke up to an empty bed.
Tony nodded in agreement.  He wasn’t wrong.  “What are you doing down here anyway?” he asked.  “You never used to come down here.”
Steve nodded, pressed his forehead against Tony’s. “I will.” He touched Tony’s chest with his hand, felt the edge of his own dog-tags beneath Tony’s shirt. “I promise.”
, and then himself say,
He poured another cup of coffee and drank it down. By the time it was gone, he could hear movement in the bedroom. Tony had taken his suit coat off and hung it on the back of the chair. He took his tie off now too, and put it on top of the coat, then went back down the hallway.
It was finally happening.
Tony nodded.  “I do know that.  So, mutual hand-jobs it is, right?”
He didn’t say anything about it, but sometimes he wondered if Tony could hear it too. He wondered if that’s why Tony did it. He hoped so.
who would hurt her. Like
“Looks like the blood didn’t stain it too bad,” he said.  “That’s good.”
god had in mind.  Or whoever.  But that’s the way
“Nat told me you and your girl broke it off.  I’m sure this Jeff’s real nice.  That’s good.”
Tony drew in a breath.  “I wish to
The humor slipped out of Steve’s face.  He was still smiling, but now it was sad, tinged with nostalgia and regret.  “Buck,” he said, and Bucky was shaking his head before he said another word.
Steve breathed a laugh against Tony’s neck.  “You think that’ll work?”
.  Once.  They both had.  But seeing him here in the window, told Tony once and for all that neither of them really belonged here anymore.  But here they were.  They hadn’t been together in this room since before the final fight.  Since before Steve died.
He held her tighter. “Thank you for that,” he said. “Keeping my room the same? It always felt good to know I still had that here.”
Hot, hungry want ran its rampant course through his body.  He could go up there.  He could climb on top of him, punish him, fuck him until his brains came out of his ears.  Tony could almost see him on the bed sheets beneath him, head thrown back, eyes lidded, sweaty, gorgeous, thoroughly wrecked.
Thor closed the compass with a gentleness that bordered on reverence.  “Here,” he said, handing it back.  “Keep it next to your heart.  Ever have the warriors of Asgard ridden into battle wearing the favor of their beloved upon their chest.  It reminds us of why we fight.”
He spent most of his time by the water
“‘Kay. Be right out.”
Strange bowed his head, thinking.  Tony and Pepper exchanged a look.  Tony mouthed the words “Thank you”.  She mouthed “You’re welcome” back.  His love for her was boundless.  It always would be.  But he was glad they weren’t together anymore.  Who would have taken care of Steve if not for him?  The team would have rallied around him, but that wasn’t the same thing.  A team is great, but a partner is heaven.  Especially if it’s the right partner.
Tony shook his head. “My god, you and Steve are just alike, you know that?
Tony looked at him, eyes shining. Sparkling. “You can do it again. In the morning. Right?” he asked, and Steve knew he wouldn’t say no. How could he say no? How had he
Tony dropped his head onto Steve’s shoulder. Made a disappointed groaning sound in the back of his throat. Steve laughed softly.
A cold finger of dread pressed against the base of Tony’s spine.  “Are you saying it isn’t worth it?”
Howard tipped his head in a way achingly like Tony. “No. I have a private room.” He gestured vaguely at his midsection. “Colon,” he said. “They caught it during an exam. Surgery, now chemotherapy.” He smiled, just a tilt of his lip. “It seems as though your mother and I have something in common after all.”
, exactly?”
In a way, it was almost like when they were teenagers.
"Is it about racism?"
Steve laughed helplessly.  “Do you think Ross wasn’t keeping tabs on us, Tony?  Don’t blame Dr. Wilkes.  He’s a good man.  He’s as much a victim as we are.  Ross has people everywhere.  Eyes everywhere.  And he’s got more money than he knows what to do with.  When he knew you were looking for a doctor for me, he just put Baxter into play.  It was easy.”
“Patience is a virtue, Clint.”
He was going to throw up.
Tony kissed him hard. “I fucking love that you just said that,” he said, “but mostly I just want
Tony closed his eyes and ran a hand through his hair.  “The Accords,” he said.  “The fucking Accords.”
“I know.”
. I don’t know. I just-I’ve been hard on you. I know. With the Thad stuff, and everything else. And now we hardly ever even see each other, and-and I’m worried, I guess.”
Steve glanced around the house, taking in the cozy room, the fireplace. The bedroom door stood open. He’d hoped they’d end up in there today. Lying together. Doing things to each other. Making each other happy one last time. But, no. Not now. That wouldn’t happen now. It couldn’t. He wiped his eyes with his forearm. Swallowed back the last of his tears. “I don’t want to be here anymore,” he said. “I don’t want to fight here.”
rerun or something instead of going out with Sam for a beer tonight. If he’d just stayed home, he wouldn’t be in this situation at all. He wouldn’t have met Thad Ross tonight. Wouldn’t have had to hear him call Steve a fucking little slut, and wouldn’t have watched in fascination as his fist flew out and hit him right in the face.
feel different. Glorious. But different.
“I’d love to.”
Her eyes were dark and still hollow with sleep as she looked down at him. “Honey, you need to get up. Both of you. Tony’s father is here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve let out a startled laugh and opened his eyes.  They sparkled.  Tony didn’t think he’d ever actually seen eyes that sparkled before.  It made his heart beat faster.
Tony’s eyes flew open, understanding hit him like a freight train even as Steve surged forward.  Tony planted his feet, putting himself bodily between the group and a pissed-off, hot-blooded Steve Rogers.
. I just told you I’m going back to bed.”
“Okay,” she agreed, and started away. As she passed the kitchen, Tony met her.
Thad blinked in surprise. “What are you doing?”
Tony cocked a brow. “Sure?”
Steve sighed as he watched them sway together, Tony’s hands in Josh’s back pockets, holding him close, and his jealousy slipped away. He wasn’t jealous anymore. He wasn’t. Now he was just sad. Sad and lonely. He glanced across the bar. Bucky and Nat were gone. It was okay. It really was. In fact, it was as it should be. Hadn’t he started out alone? All those years ago, before Tony, before Sam, before Bucky? He’d been alone then too. It was just the fate of some people, he mused, as he watched Josh press himself close to Tony’s chest. Some people were loners. Solitary. They might have people around them sometimes, but they were destined to be alone. He was one of those. He was just meant to be alone. And sometimes it hurt, but wasn’t that part of it? The loneliness? It was. He knew from experience it was. You just learned to deal with it. You just got over it. You just
“Are you okay?” Jack asked, brushing Steve’s cheek with his fingertips.
The door opened.  “Hi, I--oh.”
I decided to do one more short sappy chapter before the finish. I'm having a mood lately, and I might be a couple hours late, but it WAS Steve Rogers' birthday on the 4th, so I feel like I'm justified.
Tony missed him.
He glanced almost nervously over his shoulder, then back at Steve. “There’s someone here to see you.”
“Fuck.”
“Not bad.  They broke my arm in four places.”  He touched his head.  “This’ll be healed tomorrow.”  He grinned and lowered his head, looking up at Tony through his lashes, a blush creeping up his cheeks.  “They, uh, dislocated my hip.  So, I guess I really am an old man now, huh?  Once the hips go, everything goes, right?”
Steve’s eyes gleamed in the dim room. “Yeah? With bubbles?”
Thank you for reading and for all your comments! I always love reading them and interacting with you guys. It's part of what makes this worthwhile!
“What then? It’s not like it used to be. No one would care.” She spoke in a gentle but firm way that made him feel very good. He’d called her a friend for a while now, and right now it really felt true. But she was wrong.
“That does sound nice.”
“Let’s go!”
Steve texted him again at 11:30, just a quick,
“Well, we’ll talk about that later,” Steve said.
“Yes, it is,” Steve insisted.  “Yes, it is, Tony, your mother would still--”
“Coats on the bed,” he said, kissing the top of her head.
Tony smiled at him, but it seemed cautious, tiny lines around his eyes crinkling. “Do I shake your hand, or...?” he asked.
Steve took in a deep breath. “Me too, Tony,” he said. “But really. Wake up, okay? There’s something-” he let the breath out in a rush.
Lightning lit up the night sky like a flash from a god’s camera.
Tony snorted. “She did not.”
Steve stepped back. “I have to go, Nick. I’ll call in tomorrow.”
She looked over her shoulder at Bucky laughing in the corner with Clint. “For him,” she said.
“I said I’m fine.”
“Well, thanks for the message then, messenger.”
She looked at him seriously.  “I’m putting a moratorium on that phrase.  If you want to be my friend.”
“Are you sure?  Shuri said they might last for a while.”
Tony leaned a little closer, and Steve felt a thrill of heat jump from nerve-ending to nerve-ending inside his body. He willed himself not to shiver. It would be bad if he did that. Very bad indeed. He held his breath, waiting.
Nat touched his shoulder, drawing his eyes back to her face. “You saw Tony?” she said, nodding in his direction.
Tony laughed.  "I still like Hermione better, though."
“Too many fights. Too many late nights. Too much fucking around.” He ran a hand through his hair. “Me, not her. But you knew that.”
“Yay,” Tony said, and Steve could hear the smile in his voice.  Tony snuggled closer.  “I want a black one.”
Steve laughed.  “Sit down, okay?  It’s nothing.  I’m healing fine. The nurses say I’ll be better in a few days.”
Steve laughed, his breath warm against Tony’s stomach.
. Bruce nodded and rolled his eyes heavenward.
It was still cold.  Mid-February was always a sodden, frozen bitch of a time in New York, but under the cold, existing just beneath the surface, was the promise of spring.  It would be here soon.  It’s rampant, verdant, green energy revitalizing everything.  He’d missed it last year.  He had been here, but had spent most of March holed up at home trying to rid himself of February.  And then he’d given up.  Given up on Steve, given up on himself, given up on
“Take your time.”
He leaned in to kiss him, sucking Steve’s bruised bottom lip into his own mouth, then sat up.  One hand still touched his chest, ghosting lightly, so, so lightly over the skin, the other stroked Steve’s cheek until he opened his eyes.  His pupils were huge, eating up nearly all the blue, turning them into black pools that were almost too deep to look into.  It seemed dangerous, like one glance into them would make a man fall.  Fall and drown.
He started out the door and Steve stopped him with a hand on his hip.  The touch was light but insistent, the meaning clear:
Steve’s eyes shifted to the little blonde at the next table.  She had put away her crayons, and was now looking at a picture book.  There was a little red cup of Cheerios beside her.  “You should find somebody else, Tony,” he said, his eyes still on the girl.  “Get married.  Have a family.  It’s not too late for that.”
Tony sat forward.  “Steve, I--”
“That’s my one-year coin,” Howard said. “I’ve got a few more hanging around now, but that’s the one that means the most to me.” He smiled a strange smile, dark yet hopeful. “Well, they
that. Not with Steve.
Tony didn’t get home until almost eleven.
Tony couldn’t stand it anymore. He reached out and put his hands on Steve’s sides, under his jacket, grasping handfuls of his shirt. Steve was still taller--that hadn’t changed either--and Tony tilted his head up to look into his eyes. “But what about you?” he asked, trying to keep the urgency from his voice. “I want you to be happy too.”
was happy. He smiled, settling further against Tony’s chest. Tony kissed his temple, scratching his nails over Steve’s bare chest, circling his nipples, making him squirm. “I’m going to make you feel good too, baby. Give you everything you need.” He trailed hot kisses down Steve’s neck, fingers caressing smooth skin. “Make you forget everything bad that happened today. I can’t have my baby feeling bad, now can I?”
"Waiting for what?"
“No,” Steve said quietly, glancing around at the other soldiers. “That’s probably not the best idea.”
he was thinking about.
“I saw a guy through a window of a cafe,” he said. “I just caught a glimpse at first, but something made me stop and look harder.” He sighed. “He was slumped in his seat. Shoulders down. Hair a mess. Sunglasses on. And I thought, ‘God, that guy looks exhausted’.” Steve kissed him again. Just a small one. Sweet. “And it made me...I mean, I felt...connected to him. To that guy. That guy who looked like the whole world was pressing down on him. Like he didn’t have anything to keep him steady. Like he was teetering. Right on the edge of something. Like if he moved just a little, he’d fall over.”
Tony swallowed past the block in his throat.  As much as he loved what just happened, he knew it wasn’t real.  It wasn’t for him.  It was just muscle-memory.
“Uh-huh.”
Nat nodded, seeming very satisfied with the response. “Good.”
“Oh my god,” she said softly, “I thought that was you.” She put her arms around him and hugged him firmly, and over her shoulder, Steve’s eyes met Tony’s at last.
“I drew it for you.  It’s yours.”
Tony continued running his hand through Steve’s hair.  “Yeah.  I do wish Nat would have told him sooner, though.  Bruce rewrote his four times before he found out he didn’t need them.”
He didn’t want to.
The water turned off in the bathroom and Tony shook his head to clear it.  He went into the kitchen and put the rest of the dishes away, waiting for Steve, waiting to see what he’d say about Rhodey’s visit.
“He has his moments,” Steve agreed, then opened the door. He stepped to the side so Tony could go first, waited while Dodger slipped past him, then went inside himself, closing and locking the door behind him.
“What would you have said?” Steve asked. “If we’d talked?”
Tony fidgeted with his spoon.  He was in the kitchen of the Tower.  Barefoot, sitting on the counter with a bowl of cereal.  He’d been here two days.  Two days alone in this place that used to house everybody.  It was a little lonely, if he told himself the truth, but it was still better than the cabin.  Here, he missed everyone.  There, he only missed Steve.
fighting?”
But first…
“Are you okay?” he asked, the confusion/amusement still paramount, but concern edging into the equation.
for twenty minutes. He could do this too.
He and Steve had been like that.  Tony swore to himself they would be again.
Tony rolled his eyes.  “
That was the answer.
Mostly, though, it was quiet, quiet and peaceful, and Tony felt a huge sense of contentment as he wandered from room to room making sure everyone was alright, seeing if they needed anything, an extra blanket, a glass of water.  Everyone he asked was fine, but there was one person he did not encounter, and, he realized, he had not encountered him for quite a while.
“I’m saying that’s what I remember,” Steve answered carefully.  “I’m not saying it’s true.”
French, again.
Steve nodded.  “Rough enough,” he said, and looked back out at the lake.
“Uh-huh.”
“Oh my god.”
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Steve asked, not lifting his head.
“That’s it,” he murmured, pressing Steve’s prostate with his finger. “Talk to me, baby. I wanna hear it. I wanna hear you. Let me know how good you feel.”
“Nat-”
Sitting here now, Tony knew Strange had been right to stop him from out and out murder.  He didn’t like it, but he knew it.  However, he wasn’t sure if the plan they had come up with was right, either.  He wasn’t sure if, when he had the chance to think it over later, if Steve, himself, would approve.
Tony and Sam exchanged a look, as if they’d been doing it for years. Part of Steve was thrilled to see it, but another part of him groaned internally. They were ganging up on him. He could see it in their eyes.
That most of all.  The fear that he’d last seen in Tony’s eyes as the shield came down, shattering the arc reactor in his chest, putting out its light.  The fear he’d seen as he showed Tony his dark side, at last.  And the realization that his dark side was too dark.  That his dark side was an ebony pit that no one could bear to look into.  That there were things in that pit that were restless and writhing and desperate.  The realization that Tony was right to be afraid.
Steve smiled a little. “Well. Not at my pay-grade anyway.”
,” Tony breathed in his ear, and Steve laughed helplessly. “Where did
“What the hell are you doing?”
“Where are the seats?”
Tony sat on the edge of the tub, then slid backward. His back banged into the far rim, and he hissed in a pained breath.
“Uh-uh.”
Steve started to wheel after Tony, then stopped.  “Chuckwagon,” he said.
wearing a hoodie.  Tony knew he’d be a hoodie-guy on his days off.  Tony, himself, was not.  He tried not to let it influence him.
“It would have bothered Howard, though.”
The guy laughed like Steve had made a joke, and Steve’s eyebrows drew together. “You’re funny,” the guy said.
Tony cupped his cheek with the hand not on his back.  Steve closed his eyes, leaning into Tony’s touch.  “Tell me what’s wrong.”
ever--change that.
He’d been living a pretty solitary existence for the last couple months. He had a very definite routine. He got up in the morning at five. He checked his e-mails and messages, took his vitamins, did two hundred push-ups, then went for a run. It was a short run--only five miles. He’d calculated the halfway point from his apartment the morning after he moved in, and now he ran to exactly that place, turned and ran back. He never ran it fast. Never as fast as he could go. It was actually more of a leisurely jog for him. He usually clocked himself at about nine minutes per mile. It took him forty-five minutes. He could have gone much faster, but he didn’t. He liked the cool morning air on his face too much to take it too fast. He generally spent most of the day inside after that, so he relished this time out in the open air. He felt like it replenished something inside of him. He didn’t want to rush that.
“She was real happy you sent it. It meant a lot to her.
They sat in silence together, watching the water, watching the sky.  They were both gray and gloomy, but the warmth between the two men counter-balanced it, made the afternoon cozy instead of cold.
“Like this,” he said, glancing around the room. “It’s kind of boring in here.”
you’re fifteen minutes late, then you tell me you want to break up, then you ask me ridiculous, self-serving questions, and
“Advice?”
be, yes,” he said. “But a certain someone spent the whole night shooting daggers at him across the bar.”
be great dads, Tony,” she said, and he glanced up at her. “That’s what you’re getting at here, right? That’s why you came over here today?” She shifted the baby so she could sit up and swung her legs off the side of the couch. “So are you looking for my permission, or just my blessing?”
. And that would be nice too. Very nice.
?  Adonis?  Steve put them to shame.  With his head thrown back, his bottom lip between his teeth, his pale cheek tinted pink, he was perfection.  And he was Tony’s.
“And tell him where I am.  I mean, if he’s going into the living room and I’m there...I don’t want to startle him.”
Tony thought.
“This guy is supposed to be good.  I even asked Dr. Wilkes about him, and he said he’s only heard good things.  He’s like a doctor, and a research guy, all kinds of stuff.”
