Project Rebirth, as Steve soon learned, was a super secret experiment funded by a even more super secret organization. Basically, Dr. Erskine, with the help of another scientist that remained unnamed, had created a special serum that could give person injected with it super human abilities. Steve would be bigger, faster, stronger. He would become the ultimate soldier and he would be contractually obligated to work for SHIELD for the next ten years of his life, at least.
Peter ignored his laments and turned back to the rest of the group. “Ok, it’s obvious what just happened. Loki is messing with us”.
“So, we can contest the validity of the will?”, Steve asked the lawyer, Matthew something, while squeezing Tony’s hand at the same time.
He heard a loud crashing sound, as if someone had just dropped something very happy, and then suddenly… Was that… beeping? Tony turned around, confused, and saw it. Looking at him like a child who has finally found his long lost father, was none other than DUM-E.
“No, I’m not mad. In fact”, he said, turning to the people who were sitting down behind them, “great job, everyone, time to party”.
Tony moaned softly, an indecent sound that should definitely be illegal in Steve’s humble opinion. “Yeah, the coconut one was just perfect”.
Steve nodded and got up, going straight for his room. He took his clothes off and lay down on his bed, checking his phone. No messages from Tony.
under his breath. He passed the bloody keycard on the wall, right where Jarvis had said the control panel was, and immediately dropped it when said wall started to slowly move to the sides.
“Until what’s over?” Cap asked once more, but the workers seemed to have grown tired of them. They all slowly sat down again, staring ahead as if in a trance.
Tony woke up in pain. He blinked against the light coming from the uncovered windows and, as consciousness came, so did the annoying ache in his jaw. Moaning loudly, he took his hand to it, feeling it around. It felt… weird. He ran his tongue along his teeth, with his mouth still closed, and noticed that they didn’t align. Yeah, definitely something weird going on.
And so the years had passed as she watched the abused bestowed upon her godson. Anthony, however, never once lost his natural glow. He stood his ground, staring at his father in defiance, never once wavering. Margaret could not be more proud of her darling boy. But as Anthony grew, his sense of self worth diminished. He thought of himself as unlovable. After all, if his own parents did not care for him, then how could anyone else? And no matter what Margaret or Jarvis or Ana did, they could not convince the young boy that he was loved and it broke their hearts a little bit more every day. As time went by, Jarvis passed away, Anna soon following him. Anthony was sent to a boarding school, where he spent every holiday season alone. At first, he would call his godmother every day. After a while, the calls became rarer and rarer until one day they simply stopped coming. And Margaret wept, unable to do anything but watch her boy from afar. She sent him cards and gifts for him birthday and Christmas. She called frequently, although Anthony rarely answered. She had expressed just how proud she was of him when he joined MIT at fifteen and stood there in the middle of the crowd, applauding him when he received his diploma, his parents nowhere to be found. She was there to hold his hand as people from all around the country paid their respects to Maria and Howard Stark.
“Tony Stark! Yes, of course. Who doesn’t know Tony Stark?” Reed exclaimed, enthusiastically shaking his hand, “It’s a huge pleasure to meet you again. The last time we spoke, you were talking about creating an Artificial Intelligence. Any luck with that?”
“Come on! You said Tony was it, right? That you felt like you two were just meant to be together! So let’s do it. If they really like each other, they’re not gonna give us the time of day, but if they don’t…”
“Look, your plan sucked, ok? So we came up with a better one!” Barton complained, “And I’m pretty sure Steve only passed out because he was getting his memories back!”
There’s a sudden look of surprise in Steve’s face as he finally understood what Tony was trying to say.
"I don't wanna...", he moaned in a very loud, dramatic tone from Natasha's bed, "So... How was the mission? Fun?"
“Wow. Scratch that, you’ve gotta be the worst spy ever”, Tony laughed, rolling his eyes, “Seriously, does Aunt Peggy know me at all? I’ve just been kidnapped. And then suddenly there are two guys showing up everywhere I go! I’m a genius, you know”.
“My darling boy, you are the reason half my hair has gone white”, she said with a smile and tears in her eyes. Anthony smiled back at her.
Minutes passed. Tony continued to stare at the photos until he felt Steve’s hand on his shoulder and heard his worried voice.
, leading Jessica inside the house. His wife wasn’t home ― she was currently visiting their daughter at Harvard, as her Facebook status proudly showed. Jessica sat down on one of the armchairs in the living room, cell phone in one hand already discreetly recording the entire conversation.
“It’s okay. We’ll get them back later. For now, I just want to love every inch of you. Is that okay?”
“Hey. There was a slight issue with the program, but don’t worry, everything is fixed. My friend Rhodey is ordained and he’s gonna marry you guys. So, chop chop, it’s time, lovebirds”.
The beeping was soft. Reassuring. Every beat making it easier and easier for Tony to finally breathe again.
“Mogan!” the baby girl screamed, laughing out loud when Steve picked her up in a swoop, drowning her in kisses.
“JARVIS is the one thing keeping Stane from accessing the Jericho. I’m the only person that can activate it, get it to work”, Tony confirmed, “and when all of that happened, I created JARVIS to protect it from him. The reason no one can crack the code is because he’s an AI. He is always rewriting himself”.
“What do you mean, revenge?” Tony asked, keeping the man’s attention to himself. Natasha nodded at him, walking slowly and quietly towards the man.
“Why is it so hard for you to believe that someone could actually love me for me and not for my money?”
“I don’t have anything to say to you. You want to discuss business? Talk to my lawyer”, Tony said and moved to close the door on his godfather’s face.
“You can give interviews and statements right here where you are safe. Going back to Malibu will be like poking the bear with a short stick, Anthony!”
“I don’t get it, why is he so invested in this? I mean, he doesn’t even knows us!” Bucky whispered his complaint to Steve while they both greeted the guests for the rehearsal dinner.
“I know you think I didn’t choose you. But, you know, ma used to tell me that sometimes we’re too blinded by the world to actually see what’s right in front of us. So sometimes fate helps. And I think it really was fate who made you cold enough to steal Sharon’s sweater. Because, honestly? I can’t imagine what my life would be like without you. And I thank fate everyday for knowing better than I did. I may not have chosen you that day, Tony, but I swear I’m gonna choose you every day for the rest of my life. Because I love you. I really do. Can you please give me another chance?”
She sighed yet again, “Look, Mr. Rogers, I understand you’re worried. It’s your first child, isn’t it?”
Natasha took the device from her ear, putting it back on her purse, and sighed. She’d have to warn those three idiots about the imminent threat. She didn’t even want to think about what exactly Peggy Carter would do to them if they failed this mission.
The robot in question let his shirt go and raised its claw ― or was it its head? Maybe it was both ―, opening and closing it as if he was blinking at Steve.
“It was fine at first. But then, something happened, I don’t know what. Tony wouldn’t tell me, refused to even talk to me the whole way back”.
Steve slammed his hands on the wheel, shouting some words that would’ve made his ma wash his mouth with soap.
"You sure? 'Cause I know you enough to see that there's something wrong", Clint insisted, pushing himself into a sitting position, "Coulson said you were acting a bit weird too after Stark fired you".
“You’re… Shit, listen… I’m… I’m in love with you, Tony, I really am. I never met anyone like you in my entire life and you make me so happy and all I want is to make you as happy as you make me. But… I can’t tell my friends. They don’t know I’m…”, he stopped talking all of a sudden, looking around like he’s afraid someone might hear him, before whispering the last word, “…gay”.
“Sir, we can’t get into contact with the other facilities. They’re not responding”, the Private said just as the radio came to life.
“Dude, I’m following the plan, remember?” Bucky replied, rolling his eyes, “We need to make this breakup look real, dumbass”.
And as they waited for the procedure to begin, Steve and Bucky talked about their lives, their fears and their expectations. When Erskine appeared, accompanied by none other than Howard Stark, the boys said their goodbyes and good lucks and went their separate ways, each to a different room, knowing that whatever happened after the procedure, at least they would have each other.
Hope you like this ending! There's another fic I'm working on, check it out! It's supposed to be super fluff and funny and perfect for everyone who has watched the movie and needs a break!
Tony turned and smiled at Natasha and Clint, who were standing in his doorway, looking thoroughly confused.
“Ok, first of all, it’s called the Spider Sense. And second of all, no, I felt nothing, and I don’t have my web shooters so we’re on our own”.
The engineer lay down on his bed, phone still in hand and a big smile on his face. The last four weeks he’d spend with Steve had been some of the best of his life. Steve was sweet and funny and everything Tony had ever wanted in a partner… and he was also very much against the idea of dating Tony.
“Pete can turn into animals! He could turn into a cat, go down there and open the cages with his tiny claws”.
he thought to himself); or maybe Steve would find out about the relationship and be disgusted by it and never want to see Tony again. So many possibilities, it was honestly driving him crazy.
“I have some papers for you”, the woman said, somewhat apologetically, leaving yet another pile of documents on Natasha’s desk.
He stood there for a minute, breathing in and out, trying to calm himself down. Steve walked slowly towards him and opened his arms, as if inviting Tony for a hug. The mechanic looked at him and smiled with watery eyes before ending the distance between them with a few quick steps, falling into Steve’s arms and felling his body relax as strong arms held him tight and close.
Steve was pretty sure he had broken some kind of record with how fast he took his clothes off in that moment.
“I bought him from Stane. And I don’t think it was just a coincidence. I think he called me to his new tower today for this exact purpose. I think he knows where you are and what you are to me, Tony”.
Immediately, the room got quiet. Pepper and Rhodey, who were both very aware of Steve and Tony’s secret relationship, turned to look at Tony, who looked like someone had just punched him in the stomach.
“It’s not weird at all”, Steve said, smiling down at him, “This was your life, before, your whole childhood. It’s normal to feel like that, because all of this is familiar”.
Steve had to admit, that hurt a bit. They hadn’t started their relationship in the best way, but they had been together for two years now. He really thought they had reached a point in their relationship where they could be completely honest with each other.
Thunder once again exploded outside, making Tony jump. He tried to calm himself, tried to get his breathing under control, but it was useless. He hated storms, always had, ever since he was a little boy. Although, back then, he’d had Jarvis to keep him company. He closed his eyes and smiled, remembering the old butler. He’d make hot chocolate with little marshmallows in it and talk to Tony about anything and everything, distracting the little boy until the storm outside had passed. It was one of the few cherished memories he had from his childhood.
“Pretty sure they still have the cartoon shaped hole in the wall right there”, Pepper added, snickering.
“Steve… Listen to me, because if you want this friendship to continue, I need you to understand this… Han Solo
He forcefully let go of his face, throwing it slightly to the side, before taking something out of a small suitcase on the table.
Later that night, Tony watched Steve snore softly, the movie completely forgotten.  He smiled and wiggled himself closer to the bigger man, feeling Steve’s arm tightening around him, not letting him go. He closed his eyes and for the first time in a very long time, he thought to himself…
Tony took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. He felt Natasha’s arms surrounding him in a hug and let himself go, crying and returning the hug, not really caring if the others were watching.
Again, Tony didn’t answer. He couldn’t. The truth was too embarrassing. He pointed to his jaw and then to Bruce, who was watching the exchange between him and the ex-assassin while holding a huge plate of pancakes.
Only, when Steve opened the door, he didn’t immediately invite Tony in, which was odd on itself. He kept the door somewhat closed and, when he smiled, it looked more like a grimace than a actually “happy to see you” smile.
“Tony”, he started to say but shook his head and got up, exasperated, “Why didn’t you tell me? Hell, why didn’t you tell your Aunt Peggy? She is literally the director of the biggest secret organization in the world”.
“Yeah. I’m going to get myself another drink. I’ll be right back”, he replied, leaving before Clint could say anything else, but not before throwing another glance at Tony and Thor.
And with a final nod, Natasha grabbed Bucky by the shirt and pretty much dragged him to the car parked nearby.
In that moment, Steve went down on one knee, taking a small black box from his jacket and opening it to show a simple, silver ring. The brunette stood there, completely paralyzed, brown eyes staring into blue ones full of love and hope.
fault the boy escaped”, Stane said before slamming his phone on the desk, touching his forehead with both hands, feeling one hell of a headache coming.
“Mr. Rogers, as I told you not even five minutes ago, we still don’t have any new information. You will be informed as soon as we do”, she said in a firn, but very tired tone.
“No. I’m okay. I need to prepare myself for the fallout that is definitely coming after we expose Obie… Stane”, he corrected himself with a firm tone, “Actually, there is this Italian place a few blocks from here and it’s amazing. You think you could maybe go there and get us some food?”
“Shit, no. I mean, I love expensive things. Who doesn’t like chocolate that melts in your mouth? Or fast cars and awesome food? Who doesn’t like to be showered with gifts? I like expensive shit just fine, it’s just… I don’t know”.
Stane stayed silent, glaring at Tony. The mechanic, however, continued to smile at him. He took one step forward, standing tall in front of his godfather.
, Natasha intervened, looking at them disapprovingly. Clint had face timed her earlier, hoping she would have a better solution than Steve’s (“we run to Mexico and we stay there until Peggy Carter dies”).
, they would say and Anthony would nod, trying so very hard to hold the tears that threatened to fall from his big, brown eyes. Despite her best efforts, Margaret was unable to shield her darling boy of the horribleness of the world and she hated herself for it.
“Thor never once in all the years we’ve known each other asked me to dance, but he did tonight. T’Challa, who’s always more than proper and knows every single thing there is to know about the etiquette of every single country in this planet, just took a bit of frosting from my lips with his finger and then licked the finger. But none of that was as weird as Maria Hill very loudly telling me that I looked delectable tonight”.
“POPS!” Peter shouted, dropping his half sandwich on the plate and jumping down from the stool, running towards the living room as fast as he could.
“He’s not thinking straight”, Tiberius Stone replied from the floor, “He’s… Look, I wanted to get back at Tony for leaving me, but I’m not insane. I don’t kidnap and kill people, alright? But Stane was acting weird these days, like nothing mattered anymore”.
“Are you… Are you going to say something? Because I’m really trying to be all quiet and understanding, but I’m kinda dying over here, Steve”.
Between the four of them, they had to make two trips to take all the containers to the table in the living room, where everyone was waiting. JARVIS, by Steve’s request, turned off the videogame, making both Clint and Sam complain out loud.
“That’s not really my problem, pet”, he whispered and, without a care in the world, took both of his suitcases and disappeared down the stairs. Tony stood there for God knows how long, trying to wrap his head around what had just happened. It wasn’t until much later that the tears finally came.
Days passed before he saw Natasha again. As it turned out, her parents had decided to enroll her in the same school as Tony, hoping that she would feel better if she knew at least one person there. The entire day, the little girl stayed as far away from every other child as possible, avoiding any contact with her classmates. Some children didn’t really mind and didn’t much care to have the strange new girl in their group of friends, so they merely ignored her. But, of course, there were some other children who took Natasha’s behavior as a personal offense. It was lunch time when Justin Hammer and his little gang found the red headed girl in the playground, eating an apple, all alone. Anthony was sitting over at the bench, eating his delicious peanut butter and jam in peace when he saw what was about to happen. He watched with wide eyes as Justin knocked the apple from Natasha’s hand and called her names. And then, without realizing what exactly he was doing, he marched towards the boys and kicked Justin’s knee as hard as he could. Of course, that was a big mistake, because a) Tony was small and thin and very weak and b) Justin and his entire gang had now turned their attention to Tony instead of Natasha. One of the boys punched him so hard he fell to the ground, immediately grabbing his own nose, trying to stop the blood that was coming out of it in oozes. He closed his eyes, readying himself for the kicks and punches that would soon follow… but nothing happened. Instead, he heard a few painful grunts and a very high pitched scream. When he finally opened his eyes, he saw all four boys lying on the ground, moaning in pain, and Natasha standing over then, a furious look on her face. She suddenly turned to look at Tony, who was staring at her like she was superhero, and smiled at him, offering her hand. Needless to say, they all ended up in detention and Natasha and Tony became inseparable.
“Your father… He destroyed my family. He destroyed us. Stane knew. Stane needed to pay too, but he hated your father and he helped me get revenge. So I spared him, gave him a little while to live. But he needed to pay”.
. God, why did he have to tell his friends all those things about not ever being chosen? Now they knew how he felt AND they knew Steve had never really liked Tony, he was just being polite, like always. And
“You sure? Some of us are going out for drinks in a few. You should come with us”, she offered with a gentle smile.
Tony turned his eyes towards the door. Maybe Bucky would hear Stane talking and come over. Maybe Steve would arrive with the food and come tell Tony that it was time to eat.
“You asked him out and he said ‘sure, I’ll just bring my girlfriend along’? Bucky asked in between laughs, “Stevie, I knew you sucked at this romance thing, but holy fuck, man!”
“Excuse me? Hold the fuck up, Mystery Inc.”, Clint said, raising his hands to his chest as if surrendering, “Have you guys never watched a fucking horror movie in your lives? You don’t split up, that’s rule number two!”
“You listen to me, Captain, he is alive. Tony did this, he escaped. I don’t know how, but he did. So we’re going to check the surrounding areas or so help me God you fuckers can walk back to the fucking base and I’ll do it myself, do you understand?”
eager Tony kissing his way down his body, they’d had a very frank talk over breakfast. Steve had opened his heart to the mechanic without fear or hesitation. Tony, on his part, had listened intently with a smile on his face and, when the blond was finally finished with his speech, had simply replied with a very emotional
For the rest of the day, Steve thought of nothing else. He even made a list with all the pros and cons of each decision. If he said yes, he would become better in every way: no more asthma, no more colds, no more tiny, sickly Stevie who got his ass handed to him by a tall asshole in the movie theater. He would be able to fight his own fights. Hell, he would be able to protect people who couldn’t protect themselves! Plus, he’d have enough money to help his mother. Working ten years of his life for a somewhat shady sounding government agency seemed like a small price to pay.
“Steve, I know you and Bucky were never together. I know Bucky and Natasha are the ones dating. And I knew you were lying”.
“I checked your records. It said you’ve been at MIT for two years, but that’s bullshit. MIT has cameras everywhere and they keep the video records for at least two years so I hacked them. My AI reviewed all the footage and he didn’t find any trace of you guys. You just got here and you’re pretending to be a student so you can keep an eye on me. Am I wrong?”
He sat on the floor, in the middle of the kitchen, the box of cookies on his lap. He ate and cried and thought of a family he’d never had and of a father figure that he’d never see again. He cried about all the marks, the visible and the hidden ones, that were left in his body by Howard, by Tiberius, by the Ten Rings. And on that night, as tears ran down his face, he made himself a promise: they would never hurt him again.
“I don’t want to punish people, or kill them. I… I want to protect people. And, to be completely honest, I want this so I can help my mother. She’s sick”.
“So, not only you’re accusing me of being in love with Tony, you’re also calling me dumb?” Steve asked deadpanned.
DUM-E’s sound boxes were not exactly the best, so the voice sounded a bit off, but it was still unmistakable.
It was past eight when Steve finally managed to leave the office, tired and angry. His meetings had been a complete disaster and his head hurt from spending so much time with such egotistical, selfish people who cared about nothing but money. It never ceased to amaze him how awful these rich types could be.
Tony grimaced and sighed, looking defeated. He murmured something in reply, but Steve couldn’t hear him.
“Why were you talking?” Sam asked, crossing his arms with a menacing look on his face, glaring at Stone.
“All I’m saying is we shouldn’t jump to conclusions. Something bad might have happen, yes, it’s possible, but it’s also possible that something good came out of it”.
“Tony Stark is not going to send you to jail for sending him a fake wedding invitation, you morons”.
It was like the world suddenly came to a stop. Steve stared at a smirking Tony with wide eyes, and found himself completely lost for words.
“Let me help you. You don’t have to do this alone”, he said, walking towards Tony and sitting beside him, waiting for an answer.
The woman smiled at the night guard as she exited the elevator, biding him a good night. She walked towards her car, the clicking of her stilettos echoing through the empty garage. Natalie Rushmore disappeared as soon as she entered the car, giving way for Natasha Romanov to appear with a tired sigh. She took a small device from her purse and put in her ear, pressing it just as she began to drive away.
“We can’t use the documents right away, though”, Tony intervened. They all looked at him, confused, so he explained, “If word gets out that the CEO and majority shareholder of Stark Industries has been double dealing, he’ll lose his shares and SI’s stock value will plummet. Thousands of people will be out of a job, all the charities SI supports will lose their financial support, and I’ll never get the company back”, he explained, “We can only use those documents after I get the company”.
But Tony’s eyes were soft and his smile was genuine when he answered, “Of course you can sing to her”.
“The point is I designed it and I have a very good memory. I’ll need some materials, but I can use JARVIS and my holographic technology to recreate a full 3D model of the tower, with every entrance, every exit, every room”.
“Your father’s lawyer”, Natasha explained, “He died five months after your parents. Robbery gone wrong, according to the police reports. They never caught the guy who did it”.
She watched as Toomes arrived in an Audi and got out of her own shitty car, walking slowly towards him.
“She’s…She’s controlling them”, the Dr. commented, taking a step closer to the monitor, “My God, Thaddeus, she’s turning the dead into marionettes!”
“No. But still, it would be nice to be warned. I’ve worked here for ten years, Steve, and not ONCE were you late for work. As a matter of fact, you’ve never even called in sick! So forgive me for worrying!”
Took me some time to write this, sorry guys! Hope you like it! Next chapter will most likely be the last one!
The name and face of the Director of SHIELD was such a well kept secret that it had become a bit of a legend amongst the agents. Some said he was a military man who had singlehandedly fought against the enemy’s forces and emerged victorious, saving Fury in the process, who had lost an eye during said battle. Others said he was, in fact, the President of the United States and SHIELD was just a cover for the government to do in secret things it couldn’t do in public. And then there were the agents who thought the Director was actually Nick Fury himself and he was just trying to create some sort of mystique around his true identity. Steve had heard all of these theories in the last five years he’d worked for SHIELD. He had even created some himself when curiosity got the best of him. Maybe it said something about him that not once, in all these years, he pictured the fearsome Director of SHIELD as a beautiful brunette wearing bright red lipstick.
“You don’t like it?” Steve asked, confused, “It’s just like the one you broke the last time we fought the Wrecking Crew. It took some time because they no longer make this kind of watch. I thought you might like it”.
By the time dessert came, Tony couldn’t hold himself still. He couldn’t wait anymore. He picked at his cake, glancing at Steve.
In a fit of rage, he flipped the desk with a scream. Tony winced, closing his eyes for a second. It was difficult to breath. He had been desperate, not thinking clearly, when he decided to run towards the danger. All he had been thinking about was Natasha and how she could be in danger, all because of him. Now, though… Now he was thinking clearly and holy shit, he was a dumbass. Luckily for him, the man had decided to walk towards the other side of the corridor. Tony sneaked his head out again, watching the man walk away, when he saw it… Someone coming out of one of the offices. Someone with read head. Natasha!
Suddenly, many windows appeared out of thin air, all around Steve. News about the LGBTQ+ pride parade, about the legalization of same sex marriage in many places, even pictures and videos of said marriages.
“You guys never looked at each other’s dicks? Really? Rhodey and I used to walk naked around each other all the time. By the way…” Tony said, making a wide space with both his hands, “… huge prick”.
Natasha bit her lower lip, trying to maintain her composure, even though her fingers were already touching the phone in front of her, desperate to send a message to Bucky and Steve.
“There’s nothing I can do”, Dr. Strange said, turning his head to look at the Avengers, who were all standing inside Steve’s room, clearly going against the hospital’s visiting rules.
Tony whimpered softly when he heard the loud noise of something being thrown on the ground. He didn’t have a cellphone, he didn’t have a weapon. He had nothing to protect himself. All he could do was hide and run, like an animal trying to escape a hunter.
Clint feigned ignorance. “I don’t know. But, I mean, I don’t blame Thor for trying, you know. Tony is a very handsome guy”.
“Sorry, sorry. I don’t know what came over me, I…” he turned his eyes back at the couple on the dance floor once more, “Are Thor and Tony together?”
Tony looked around the table. Clint and Phil were staring at him intently, clearly waiting for an answer. Sam, on the other hand, was looking down on his drink as if it was the most interesting thing in the world. The young mechanic felt trapped, like a wild animal locked in a small room. Before he could answer, though, Steve showed up and, probably sensing the tension, cursed loudly, glaring at his friends.
There were six bodies on the floor, all torn to pieces; arms and legs laid around in pools of blood, and heads smashed in. The whole scene was enough to make even Steve gag. He took his eyes from the violent scene on the floor and looked around, just noticing the weird blood marks on the walls, as if the victims had been slammed from one side of the room to the other until their heads cracked and their limbs came apart like they were nothing more than some poorly made ragdolls.
“It really is”, Steve agreed, standing right next to Tony, “you’ve been doing a lot for us, Tony. You really didn’t have to”.
He immediately woke up, sitting at the bed, while rubbing his hands on his face, trying to put himself together.
“JARVIS, how did you do this? How can you be inside DUM-E’s program?”, Tony asked, curious and astonished with his creation.
“Nat went to the workshop to get Tony”, he heard Clint say, probably answering someone’s question. Tony was about to open the door when he heard a sigh.
. Tony took a deep breath, trying to get himself ready to face the day, and walked down the stairs, straight to the kitchen to have some breakfast.
he thought angrily to himself. He slowly put his head out, trying to listen to the man’s steps or screams. He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself.
“Very well! You won’t regret it, Stark”, he said with a wink before allowing his wife to pull him towards another couple that had arrived, waving at them as he went.
“What are you guys even complaining about? This is awesome! We’re basically our characters! And I’m guessing we’re in a far away land, ready to live an adventure! This is the best day EVER!”
“I see”, and with that, Thor hugged the smaller man, pulling him even closer as they danced, “I am not good with words of comfort, my friend, but I have been told sometimes an embrace from a loving friend should be enough”.
Steve came home a week later, followed by Sam and Bucky, after taking down yet another secret Hydra facility. JARVIS had informed them upon arrival that everyone was at the communal floor, so the three Avengers quickly made their way up there. Tony was already waiting for him when the elevator doors opened, throwing himself on Steve’s arms as soon as the soldier opened them, welcomingly.
But he didn’t have to say anything else. If this could help his mother, then he’d do it, no matter what it was. Besides, these papers were only to find out what exactly the solution the doctor had mentioned was. If it happened to be something Steve wasn’t comfortable with, he could just walk away and never mention it again. Without a second thought, he got up from the chair he’d been sitting, taking the pen from Dr. Erskine’s hand and promptly signed the papers.
The workshop, as Miss Potts had called it, was like something out of a sci-fi movie. Steve couldn’t name half the things in there.
Quill stared at him, turning his head slightly to the side, “That sounds scary. But I like the thought of being free again! I’ll give it a go, yes!”
“Agents Barnes and Rogers will be accompanying you in your trip. You are not to step foot inside Stark Industries without my say so and you will leave the airport and go directly to the mansion, do you understand? Do not try me, Anthony”, she warned when he frowned at her stipulations, “It’s either this or I will put you in a cell until this whole matter has been resolved”.
“Thanks for the help”, Natasha said sarcastically, walking with purpose towards the door, quickly taking her high heels from the floor on the way.
“It’s an RPG”, Cassie replied, and then immediately explained after seeing the trickster’s blank look directed at her, “A Role Playing Game. We each create a character and use these special sheets of paper to write down their relevant characteristics, background story and abilities. Then, the Dungeon Master sends us an adventure on a far away land”.
“Stane told me to distract him. He saw the agents, he was going to make a run for it”, he whimpered again, closing his eyes, “So I distracted him. But someone hit me from behind and… Where’s Tony?”
“I did. I’m going to be honest, I thought about ghosting you. Not because of what happened exactly, but because… There’s a lot about me that you don’t know, Steve, a lot that I’m not willing to tell yet. I’m dangerous to be around. People I love tend to be hurt”.
“I still can’t believe it, you know”, Tony whispered, biting the inside of his cheek while holding his cup of coffee, “No one ever picks me. I’m always the second choice, the ‘can’t have the best, might as well have this’”.
, he thought to himself. He closed his eyes for a moment and, when he opened them again, he was in full armor and ready for the fight. He smiled at Stane.
that you took from me. My company, my house, my money… And when I’m done with you, you’re going to spend the rest of your life in jail and no one will even remember your name”, he said in a low tone, taking yet another step forward, making Obadiah take a step back.
“You know what that means, right? That’s where they keep the really freaky stuff”, Barton said, crossing his arms.
As it turned out, he didn’t quite have a chance to talk to Steve the next morning. He was woken up by a call from Pepper, telling him he was needed at the R&D department immediately and that Happy was already waiting outside for him. He quickly got dressed and sent a text to Steve from the car.
“Yes. If he’s involved with Stane, then you can bet he is the one responsible for Stane’s security. And that complicates things”, Tony explained with a sigh.
Tony threw him a small smile, “Nothing all that interesting. What about you, Cap, what have you been up to?”
He smiled, turning the smaller man so they could be face to face. He took a step closer, pressing his whole body against Tony’s, and lowered his head until their lips were only inches apart. Tony moaned softly when he finally noticed Steve was only wearing a towel around his waist and nothing more.
Steve loved his friends. They were his family, the only one he had. They had been together for years now, always helping each other through the tough times and celebrating together when life was going right. He loved them, he really did. But Steve also knew them very well, he knew just how protective they were of him and he was terrified of what they’d do to Tony when they finally had him at their mercy. He knew they meant well, but… God, Steve liked Tony. In fact, he was pretty sure he was very much in love with the mechanic already. Even the thought of losing him made his insides twist in an agonizing way. The uncomfortable feeling must have shown on his face, because he soon felt Tony’s hand softly touching his leg.
“Yes. Let’s start with your name, shall we? Because we checked with some friends and Tony Carbonell doesn’t exist”, Natasha replied, looking untroubled as she sipped the rest of her drink.
Tony waited until they were far enough before turning to Steve, “Do we tell Natasha the mission is a go?”
“That’s hard to believe”, Tony replied, closing the menu and looking intently at his date, “You’re every man’s, and woman’s, wet dream”.
“A pleasure to meet you, Miss Potts”, Steve nodded and followed her to the private elevator. They rode it in complete silence. When the doors opened minutes later, Steve couldn’t help but look around with wide eyes.
Something was wrong. Something was definitely wrong. Steve looked behind him, finding a warning on the wall.
“Well, they have us. So we’re going to fix this for them”, Bucky replied, putting the chain in his pocket, “But first, we need to come up with a plan”.
overprotective and how he was absolutely terrified that they would somehow manage to scare the mechanic away. At the time, Tony had reassured Steve time and again that there was no way in hell anyone would be able to scare him away. And he had firmly believed that because nothing in this world could be worse than the life he’d led before coming to NY. So, when the day arrived, Tony put on his rich boy mask, the one he hadn’t used since his last encounter with Ty a good year ago, and got ready to face wherever Steve’s friends could throw at him. The thing is… He was expecting something else entirely.
“Yeah, sure, pasta sounds good”, Bucky replied, sitting down on the kitchen aisle and watching his best friend cook, smiling as if nothing was wrong, completely unaware that he had lost the love of his life for the second time.
“I understand you’re nervous and worried… but all we can do right now is wait. Why don’t you go to the gift shop and buy your husband something, huh? It’s common for fathers to give their loved ones a gift right after the baby is born”.
Steve immediately turned back around, rushing to Tony’s side. He was holding his belly with a frightened expression on his face.
Tony stared at his hands for a long moment, looking deep in thought. Then, he raised his head, looking into Steve’s eyes before smiling, determined, a fire burning in his brown eyes.
“Still, I was never someone’s first choice. So it’s nice to know that Steve picked me, you know. He never dated anyone before me and he picked me! It’s a nice feeling, it’s all”.
“Yeah, it was”, Steve replied, with a huffed laugh, “But I get it. You spent two years hiding for me, Tony. Two years pretending and trusting that I would get the courage to come out one day, and then you find out I went out with some girl. I get how much that hurt you, because if it was me in your place, and I heard you went out with someone else, I’d be devastated. But I need you to know this. Nothing happened. I swear. We ate, we talked, she went home. We didn’t kiss, we didn’t even hug. I just did it so Natasha would leave me alone, you know”.
Peter closed his eyes once more and scrunched his nose in concentration. Suddenly, in the blink of an eye, a small white cat was standing in the boy’s place. He looked at his own tiny paws and then shook his butt, as if preparing to jump. He meowed to the rest of the gang, ignoring their comments on how cute he looked, and turned to the clearing, going down the small hill and towards the cages with dexterity. He was careful enough to hid in the nearby bushes whenever a goblin passed by and made his way slowly to the biggest cage, where a big, brown bear sat, looking very sad. He got as close as he could, observing the bear. It had just occurred to him that, if he let the bear go, he’d probably attack not only the goblins, but his friends as well.
The extremely hot days and excruciating cold nights were driving him crazy. Well, there was also the whole torture thing going on, like how they water boarded him every single day for hours as he desperately held to his car battery, trying to keep it from getting wet like his life depended on it ― and it did. Yeah, the torture thing didn’t help his mood, but honestly, it was all the desert’s fault. Stupid desert.
“Here”, Natasha said, giving the man a small earpiece, which he promptly put in his ear, “All communications go through this and nothing else. From this moment forward, you will be Lieutenant, understood?”
Steve thought to himself. Both the doctor and Tony himself, not to mention the very annoyed nurse, had told him the delivery would take a few hours due to the preparations, so he might as well distract himself while getting Tony a balloon or something.
"If you're both level 7 then you've been here long enough to know that you shouldn't be discussing these things in an elevator, where anyone can hear you".
“The computer Obie uses is a private one. It doesn’t have a connection to the internet and it’s not connected to the other company computers. JARVIS only found out about the weapon deals because Pepper hid a camera inside Obie’s office”.
“Because Tony spent a lot of money on this, okay? And if we break up tomorrow before the wedding he might get suspicious. Or worse, he might think I’m still hang up on you and he won’t want anything to do with me”.
“You, on the other hand, definitely let yourself go, Tiberius”, Tony replied, without so much as glancing at his ex, his eyes focused on Obadiah.
Tony looked away for a second and then back at Natasha, looking more determined than ever before, “we have a week before the charity ball. That’s more than enough time for me to create a program that can hack through anything Ty might have put in Stane’s computer”.
“Oh, don’t worry, he’s gonna get it as soon as he leaves the room. How could you all be so irresponsible? Your little plan could’ve killed Steve! Or it could have made his memory loss even worse! Or even turned his brain…”
“I’m starting to sense a little threat in your words, Stane, and I gotta tell you, I don’t do well with threats. So you should measure your next words very carefully”, Steve replied in a warning tone.
Natasha rolled her eyes and ignored him. “… Steve, Tony thinks you’re the greatest thing that has ever existed and wants to get married and have tiny ripped genius babies with you. Tony, Bucky said Steve’s had the biggest crush on you ever since the day you met and has drawn you so many times he’s had to buy three more sketchbooks just this month. You’re both idiots. Now, if you’re excuse us, Bucky and I are going back to our place to have some sex and I suggest you dumbasses do the same. Good night”.
Steve faltered for a second and looked at Tony. He didn’t look angry or upset, he just looked... confused. The mechanic didn’t know what to do. He was terrified that they would find out his secret, but he was also afraid that, if he didn’t come clean, Steve would leave him, and with good reason. And so, in that moment, he made a decision.
“I can do it”, Natasha suddenly said, carefully grabbing his jaw and turning it from one side to the other, examining it, “It’s just a bit dislocated. All we need is some muscle relaxants and maybe a local anesthetic so you won’t feel any pain”.
Originally, I planned for three chapters, but I couldn't finish on this one. I have two endings in mind, a happy one and a sad one. So, which one would you guys prefer? The sad one? The happy one? Both? Let me know in the comments!
Neither of them talked as they made themselves breakfast, although Steve would sometimes glance at Tony. He finally broke the silence after a long sigh.
Steve forced a smile. “Yeah, I’m okay. Just nervous”, he replied without taking his eyes off the road.
Natasha and Tony jumped at the scream, turning their heads to see what was going on. Steve was on the ground, clutching his head and crying out in pain.
“It was gas, okay? It was just gas! I made you bring me to the hospital because of farts!” he exclaimed, his cheeks reddening from the utter embarrassment.
Tony was looking down. He took a deep breath and nodded, looking up to meet Steve’s eyes. “I trust you”, he whispered.
Tony shrugged. “I thought it would be better that way. Anyway, could you give him back the dog tags?”, unable to stand there any longer without completely breaking down, Tony took a deep breath and started walking towards the elevator, “Thanks, terminator, I own you one”.
Tony snorted. “I’m sorry, didn’t I just watch you put a slice of pizza inside a taco shell and eat it?”
Morgan immediately raised her head at the word ‘cookies’. She turned around and, using Steve as her support, got herself up. She looked at her feet and then took a shaky step forward.
Tony shrugged, smiling. “At first I thought maybe you were embarrassed of me. You know, introducing the mechanic to your rich friends”.
“Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to try and get some work done so I can leave early to go beg Tony to forgive me”, he said, turning back to the computer, but not before glancing at his cell phone, where the screen was still empty, with no new messages.
Matthew nodded. “Alright. I’ll get in contact with Hogarth and request a copy of the will today. But, be warned, as soon as I do, Stane will be notified of it”.
Tony laughed. “Oh, yeah. He congratulated me on my upcoming engagement and offered to teach me a few tricks for the honeymoon”.
Bucky and Sam didn’t reply, choosing to giggle between themselves like children. The door suddenly opened with a bang, making both men jump. Steve smiled and kneeled down, opening his arms wide.
A few minutes later, a knock on the glass called his attention. He waved for the girl to come in and smiled at her.
“We need to find her first. Come on, Jarvis has already made a copy of everything. We should meet up with Nat and Clint, see if they found anything”.
Tony took out his phone and put it on the table in the middle of the room, “JARVIS, can you hear me?”
“Yesterday, after the meeting, I stayed behind for a while because I lost my pen; you know that one that Rick gave me? It was under the table so I went to get it and Mr. Stane walked in and he didn’t see me there. I was going to show myself, I swear,” she promised in a tone that very much told Natasha that Evelyn had had no intention whatsoever of doing that, “but he was talking on the phone with someone and he sounded really angry”.
He kept repeating it again and again and again inside his mind, in an endless, horrible loop. He couldn’t tell them the truth, not the real truth, but Steve was right there and he was looking at Tony with such a confused and hurt look. So he spilled the story. He told the truth where he could, carefully omitting the things he knew would get him into trouble. And when he was done, he felt awful. It was like reliving all of it again… Finding the evidence, the phone call, DUM-E trying to protect him, running away… He needed to leave. He needed to be alone, away from everything and everyone. And so he left in a hurry, leaving behind a very distraught Steve.
“Why the ever loving fuck would we do that?!” Bucky asked, “Pal, we already have a plan, a perfectly good plan, a plan that doesn’t involve me marrying your sorry ass!”
“My father had the best lawyers in town”, Tony said, confirming Matthew’s words, “I remember the name of the firm, if that would help. They were from NY”.
Things weren’t so different on the other side of the table. Tony and Steve had gotten so close together, their legs were touching. They talked about movies, about class, about their summer plans. Tony smiled at every word that came out of Steve’s mouth, touching his knee and moving a bit forward every time he laughed. When their orders came, they shared their food, feeding each other pieces of parmigiana and pasta.
One step closer, their noses touching, “I can fight for you all day. I can fight for you all my life if that’s what it takes. Because you’re worth it”.
“Stevie, come on”, his best friend replied, licking the frosting off his fork, “You’d have to be crazy to dump a hot piece of ass like me. It just wouldn’t be believable”.
“I dislocated my jaw that night you were here and Clint told them it was because I was giving you a blow job”.
“Actually, I was about to go there right now, so, Tony, what’s your poison?” Sam immediately chimed in, getting up.
They walked up the stairs in uncharacteristic silence. Steve and Tony walked ahead while Natasha and Clint stayed a few feet behind them, bow and gun at the ready, in case someone decided to attack. After a long walk, they finally arrived at the building. Steve pressed the button near the gate, but nothing happened.
“No, I’ll call a cab. I’d like to be alone tonight. I’ll talk to you tomorrow”, and with a final wave, Tony left the bar leaving a brokenhearted Steve behind.
“Where are you, Stark?” the man screamed, turning away from the body and kicking a nearby chair, “This what Starks do, huh? Hide like cowards! Your father was coward too!”
The brunette nodded with a small smile and eyes full of tears before burying his head on Rhode’s neck with a soft cry.
He took the elevator to Steve’s apartment and opened the door with a smile on his face. He couldn’t wait to see Steve and hug him and kiss him. Tony had had boyfriends before, but none of them had been even remotely like Steve. He was sweet, kind, understanding. Sometimes, Tony just had to look at him and his heart would fill with so much love and happiness he actually felt like he might explode. And being able to see him, everyday, to sleep and wake up in his arms, it was just the best feeling in the world. He was amazing.
“Well, it was one year ago and we were sitting in this exact table, all of us. Well, expect for Rhodey ‘cause he had explosive diarrhea”.
“I don’t know, I mean, I guess we thought you would be a little freaked out over this. You know, marriage, commitment”.
“That’s DUM-E”, Miss Potts answered, having suddenly appeared with a tray. She gave Stane the glass of scotch and offered Steve the bottle of water, which he politely accepted. And then suddenly, it hit him.
There were in the kitchen when it happened. Pepper, Rhodey and Bucky were opening pizza boxes and getting paper plates, and Steve was sitting on the counter, drinking a beer while talking to Tony, when Natasha showed up.
“That’s right. The general, who never ate anything other than meat and potatoes, that very night decided to try some local cuisine. He spent the night throwing up and called Mr. Jarvis for help. I was tasked with cleaning up the room. And that’s how we met. Fate”.
“I guess saying ‘hey, we experimented on your kid and they ended up going crazy and killing themselves’ doesn’t have the same light tone as ‘they died honorably while killing innocents overseas’”.
“How did you find him?” Tony asked, letting go of the robot. DUM-E, who was apparently already over the whole reunion thing and very curious about his new home, rolled away to the lamp nearby and started pressing the button, turning it on and off and on and off again nonstop, beeping excitedly.
“I know you two. You’re way too overprotective. You’re going to use this date to dig dirt on him and psychoanalyze him and scare him away. I like him, Bucky”.
“NO”, he shouted, grabbing the corners of the intercom like he could grab Tony through it and pull him into the apartment, “Please, come up!”
“So, Steve, I just talked to Sharon. She said she had a great time. Are you taking her out again or what?”
Steve narrowed his eyes, clearly not believing a word out of Clint’s mouth, but he didn’t have time to argue. He turned back as soon as he heard the familiar
“You put on a metal armor, flew to a town controlled by the most dangerous terrorists in the planet, fought them, destroyed the weapons that Stane sold them under the table, was hit by a missile and then almost killed by the US Air Force… I am the worst bodyguard ever”.
The benefit felt more like an after party for the Oscars, in Steve’s opinion. Everyone was dressed to the nines, in fancy, expensive suits and dresses, glasses of champagne in hand as they talked and laughed. The whole thing felt fake somehow, and Steve couldn’t help but wonder if even half of these people gave a shit about the cause behind the benefit. He felt Tony’s hand slip from his and watched as the younger man walked purposefully towards Obadiah. Steve saw a flash of annoyance in his face before he smiled at Tony. He couldn’t hear what they were saying because the screams of the reporters and the people surrounding them, begging for an autograph and a picture, were just too loud, but he could see their expressions. It was obvious Obadiah was trying to mask his surprise, but there was something else in the way he looked at Tony… Steve just didn’t like it. The conversation between the two, however, was brief and soon Tony walked away, Steve following closely, glancing one last time at the CEO before turning his whole attention back to his ‘date’.
“Right, yes, of course”, he said, shaking his head with a grimace, “I promised I’d behave tonight. No shop talk, you understand”.
And that was exactly what Tony did that night, after sending a quick, very sarcastic, text back to Steve. He just closed his eyes and thought of Steve’s smile, his eyes, his big, strong hands, completely unaware that Steve was doing the exact same thing a few blocks away from there.
The newly engaged couple laughed and authorized Jarvis to open the elevator doors. Immediately, Clint jumped out.
“Hi, Steve. I’m great. Thanks for the flowers and the chocolate, by the way. It was very thoughtful”.
“I kind of upgraded the furniture”, Tony said with a shrug while Steve smiled like a fool behind him.
“That might not be the right file”, the blonde tried to reason, trying not to show just how terrified he really was.
Matthew nodded. “Yes. They’re one of the best firms in the State, if not the best. One of our clients, Danny Rand, used to be their client before he decided to come to Nelson and Murdock”.
“Gross”, Sam chimed in, rolling his eyes, “We’ll be around if you need us. You two try to have fun”.
A very special thank you to Cat__Astrophe, ExistencialCrisis713, QueenE, Tcnystcnks, Ditasitepu35, Annnguyen04 and everyone else who took the time to leave a comment on this story! 💗 Thank you all so much!
So Tony got it. He did, really. The fear of coming out and not being accepted, of losing the people close to you because they can’t accept this very important part of you. And he really did like Steve. Like he never liked anyone before in his life. So he made a decision.
“Yeah, sure, an exploding goblin head is the same thing as opening up a dead frog. Okay”, Cassie complained, looking very green.
“Focus”, Natasha said in a loud tone, making Clint cross his arms in annoyance, “You can all gawk at the pretty toy later”.
“I don’t know, sir”, the younger man replied, looking at the big screens around them, trying to find the culprit.
Clint asked through the earpiece and, even at a distance, Steve could see he was smiling as he swept the floor with an old broom.
“Yep. Pepper is bringing Happy, Nat and Sam went shopping for something, can’t remember what, and Clint and Coulson said they will be a little late but they’ll be here”.
And with that, Steve grabbed Tony’s ass, pulling him up as the mechanic put his legs around his waist, both of them stumbling up the stairs amidst moans and laughs.
“We were drunk”, Bucky continued, “and we saw this thing on the internet, right, about how these billionaire have personal assistants who probably go through their mail, right, and how it would be incredibly easy to like send a wedding invitation to a billionaire and the assistant would probably send a dope gift even if they don’t know you because they probably wouldn’t even bother to try and find out who you were, right”.
“Only you would think dislocating a jaw while sucking dick is better than while eating an entire hot dog in one bite”, he said. The elevator doors opened once more, revealing the penthouse. Tony stepped out and looked back when Steve didn’t move.
Game Night happened once a month, on a Friday. Basically, Harley, Ned, MJ, Cassie and Peter would get together at the penthouse, order lots of junk food, buy a shit ton of candy and play board games until one of them passed out from all the sugar. Lately, though, they had found a new passion: Dungeons and Dragons. Shuri had introduced them to the world of D&D the last time she was in town, helping them create their characters and coming up with the most amazing and intricate adventures to send them to. They had loved it so much that even after the girl was long gone, back to Wakanda, they continued to play every month without fail, using Mr. Stark’s holographic technology for the maps while Shuri did her job as Dungeon Master through a video call.
Because he was Tony Stark and Stark men were made of iron. And the fucking Ten Rings would regret the very day they decided to mess with Anthony Edward Stark.
“I could take a look at that for you”, Tony offered, making Bucky freeze on the spot. “Improve it, if you want. My PhD is actually in robotics so…”
“No threat here, my boy!”, he said with a booming laugh, “No threat, just a business opportunity. Think about it… SHIELD could be the next CIA”.
A soft melody started to play as soon as the doors closed. The Avengers stood there, awkwardly, as they descended. Finally, after almost a minute had passed, the doors opened again.
“My relationship with the target will not affect this mission, Soldier”, Rhodes promised, and then continued explaining, “They were attacked around here”, he pointed at the map, “a few miles outside Kunar. All soldiers in the convoy were killed in combat. This was the target’s last known location”.
“I don’t know. I guess I’m just going to tell him that I’m not… interested in something more. I don’t know, maybe we can be friends”.
Bucky watched the elevator doors close and, when they finally did, looked down at the chain in his hand, completely lost. He caught some words on the inside of the ring and raised it closer to his face, reading it.
“Calm down, my boy, it was just an idea. I have some new tech I need to show you”, he said, typing something on his phone, “The engineers should be here in a minute”.
The words felt like ash in his mouth, but he didn’t let it show. Steve looked at him for a moment, thoughtful, before smiling and nodding.
Right under the saying was a drawing of a football field with many players. On the side, there was a small brunette cheering and, beside him, a robot (who looked very much like DUM-E) holding a sign that said “Go Team”. Tony smiled.
“I would like a dance, Man of Iron. As you know, since my Jane left me, I have not had the pleasure of dancing with anyone. I very much enjoy this activity and know you enjoy it as well”.
“And this kid showed up with flowers and a note, saying they were from Steve and that he wanted to meet me under the bleachers. The note said he was in love with me and he was too embarrassed to tell me in person, but he hoped I felt the same way and if I did, he would be waiting for me”.
, the kind that would laugh obnoxiously while talking about their trips to Europe and then discuss the newest scandal involving some politician’s daughter and another clueless millionaire between flutes of expensive champagne. And so, the mechanic was expecting to meet someone like Tiberion, who threw money around in order to show everyone just how rich and powerful he was, or maybe someone like Justin, who monopolized every conversation, always talking about how great he was (spoiler alert, he really wasn’t). He was most certainly not expecting to meet a bunch of very down to Earth people in a karaoke bar, drinking and eating onion rings and, basically, just having fun. They looked so normal, so
“By God, Howard, how you can live in this godforsaken place is frankly beyond me”, she had complained, taking her shoes off at the door and graciously accepting a towel from Jarvis.
“You and me both”, Steve replied, filling Morgan’s glass with water, “By the way, sweetheart, we need to buy more oranges, we’re all out”.
“You passed out at the party. We brought you to Medical so the doctors could check on you. How are you feeling?”
Everybody turned to Natasha, who was typing on her laptop, staring at the screen as if it had personally offended her.
The question made Tony stop immediately, hand still on the handle. He recognized the voice. It was Steve.
“No, thanks”, she replied, even though she definitely felt like having one, “The police report said that you claimed the camera stopped working that night. I think that’s bullshit”.
He had woken up that morning with a smile on his face, thinking about his date with Tony. In fact, he had gone to sleep the night before thinking about the handsome mechanic and, even though he didn’t quite remember dreaming, he would bet half his fortune that Tony had been on his mind all night long.
“Sure. But I have to say, I have a feeling there’s gonna be some loud sex happening at your place tonight as well”, Tony said in a very soft tone, biting Steve’s lower lip and pulling it lightly, “All… Night… Long”.
“Morgan”, Nat called, ignoring Sam and Clint’s bickering, “You’re an expert on desserts. What’s your favorite?”
“Basically, you’ll become a special agent of SHIELD. And the pay will be enough to care for your mother’s medical needs, I’m sure. But I’m afraid, until you sign those papers, that is all I can tell you about it”.
Natasha just stared at them, arms crossed in front of her chest. “So tell him it was a joke and that you two turn into the stupidest people in the entire universe when you drink”.
“Yeah, who you think the cops are gonna believe? The dumbass who looks like a homeless person or the guy who owns the biggest technology company in the world?” Clint supplied, calmly.
Those fifteen minutes had felt like fifteen years for Tony. He stood there at the helipad, walking from one side to the other, unable to stand still as he and the medical crew waited for the quinjet to arrive. When it finally did, and its doors opened, Tony felt his legs give out. There was blood. So much blood. Natasha and Sam were covered in it as they pushed a stretcher across the lawn, screaming at Cho to
They smiled at each other and exchanged one last kiss before walking, hand in hand, towards the kitchen, where part of their beautiful family awaited for them.
“A watch”, he explained, still confused with the whole thing, “Remember, Tony was really upset over losing his watch on that fight with the Wrecking Crew, and the company didn’t make those anymore, so I pulled a few strings and I got him one. An exact replica. I thought he would be happy, but apparently not”, he finished in a bitter tone.
When Steve finally realized the phone calls wouldn’t work, he started sending other things. On Friday, he sent flowers with a note.
Not knowing what else to do, Steve and Bucky just nodded and turned as the doors opened. The music started playing softly on the background as they walked down the aisle. Sam and Nat took the front, with Clint and Wanda right behind them. Steve was sure the whole scene looked beautiful for anyone watching, but he, well, he just felt like throwing up.
A man suddenly appeared on his line of vision. He looked at Tony with semi closed eyes and a frown, his lips pressed thin against each other. He said something in another language, something the young engineer couldn’t quite understand. Another voice filled the room, replying to whatever the man with kind eyes had said. The man looked regretful for a moment, turning his eyes to the scalpel in his hand and then back to Tony. He sighed.
“Thanks, Tony, I needed to hear that. You know what, I’m going to call her right now. Thanks a lot!”
“I know, I don’t get it either. Maybe we should just come clean”, Steve replied, shaking the hand of a person he was pretty sure he had never seen before in his life, “who are all these people anyway?”
“Yeah. You can ask Bucky, I told him all about it”, he kissed Tony’s nose, smiling softly, “I love you”.
Tony looked down at the box in his hands, with the tiny pair of shoes inside, and sniffled, “I’m… I was going to tell you… I found out today”, he looked up and stared at Ty with tears in his eyes, “I’m pregnant”.
“I’m kind of hungry. How about some pasta?” Steve asked, already taking out a pot from the cupboard.
“Matt thinks that we have a real chance with the will, sweetheart”, Steve said in a soothing tone, getting up and hugging Tony from behind.
“The Lieutenant Colonel was the one who brought it up, ma’am. But he doesn’t believe the leak came from the soldiers or anyone in the Air Base”.
The man smirked and said, with a heavy accent, “I’m the man your family destroyed. And now I destroy you”.
, which Sam had given him last Christmas as a gag gift for their Secret Santa. He thought about changing quickly, but the soft knock on the door told him there wasn’t enough time. Resigned, he opened the door with a sheepish look on his face.
“I know how much you hate when people keep interrupting us. I thought maybe we could have the whole night for ourselves”.
Later that night, Bucky and Steve were sitting at a table, watching Tony and Nat laughing in the middle of dance floor.
Tony turned his attention back to the screen, typing away for a few seconds. “No can do. The feed is being blocked by something”.
“Blue Ferrari”, Tony completed at the same time Sam said it, “I know who it is. His name is Tiberius Stone”.
In his self imposed isolation, Tony went through all the possible outcomes for the Loki incident, as he was calling it inside his head. Best case scenario, Steve would get his memories back and they would resume their relationship. Worst case scenario, his partner would never remember their relationship and Tony would spend the rest of his life alone. And then there were the other options: maybe Steve would remember him but realize he didn’t actually love Tony, so he would leave him; or Steve would never get his memories back, would find out about his previous relationship with Tony and fall in love with him again (
“Should we really do this?” Tony interrupted them. All eyes turned to him, confused. He felt Steve’s strong arms encircling him and let himself melt on them, as if all the stress had suddenly left his body. “Obie… Stane is powerful. He’ll fight this with everything he has. And if he’s done these things, if he’s really capable of murdering people to get what he wants…”
was lying, bloodied, unmoving and dangerously pale. They took him straight to the surgical room and Tony tried to follow, but was stopped by a set of big, strong arms, who held him back as he fought and screamed and cried Steve’s name over and over and over again between sobs.
The man, Tony suddenly noticed, was carrying a small shoulder bag and was taking something out of it. For a second, Steve’s voice filled Tony’s head ―
It was raining outside. Correction, the world was very much ending outside. Lightning lit up the sky every once in a while, followed by the booming sounds of thunder right after. Tony sat on his couch, hands holding his stomach protectively, and closing his eyes every time the light filled his living room, waiting with a grimace for the loud noise that would soon follow.
, he’d said, earning himself a glare from his friend every time. Steve knew he wasn’t far from the truth, though. There were situations that really did make Steve burn from the inside, a flame that engulfed his mind and made him reckless most of the time. For Steve, rage was loud as a thunder, burning red like a flame inside of him. He’d thought that it was like that for everyone, until earlier that night.
, that Tony didn’t even notice his mask slipping, dropping his guard a little bit more with every word exchanged. And, of course, that had been his doom.
“Dude had his eye taken off with a spoon by his best friend, I think he’s entitled a bit of paranoia”, Clint defended the older man.
Tony knew the whole interrogation debacle hadn’t been Steve’s fault. The blonde had spent an entire week trying to convince the mechanic that they shouldn’t go. At first, Tony had been sad, thinking maybe Steve was embarrassed of introducing a nobody covered in grease to his rich friends, but the thought had been quickly dismissed after his lover spent forty minutes explaining how his friends were
She pushed the little bear in a pink tutu closer to Steve. He took it from her hands and examined it with little interest. It was cute, no doubt about that, but it didn’t feel like something Morgan would like – not that Morgan was old enough to like anything just yet. He looked around, trying to find something more appropriate when his eyes fell on it. He smiled and pointed at it.
The corridor it showed was painted with blood and filled with the bodies of fallen soldiers. A shadow like creature suddenly stepped into view. It walked slowly, seemingly unaffected by the carnage surrounding her. It stopped in the middle of the corridor and looked around before making an unusual gesture with its hand. The bodies around it then started to move. Slowly, the got on their knees and then on their feet, as if nothing had happened, as if they’d been merely waking from an afternoon nap.
Peter did as he was told and very soon the animals were hoarding the remaining goblins into a corner. Harley, taking full advantage of it, put his sword back on its scabbard and turned to where the goblins were. Suddenly, smoke started to come from his nostrils and the rest of the gang watched, astonished, as he opened his mouth and fire came out of it, burning the desperate goblins until they were nothing more but a pile of ashes. Harvey turned around, looking at his friends with absolute pride in his face.
Tony could hear Bucky and Rhodey snickering from the table. He turned his head and glared at them, before turning back to finish Peter’s peanut butter and jam sandwich.
“Congratulations, my friends! There is no happier occasion than when two mighty warriors decide to share not only the battlefield, but also their lives”, Thor offered, almost taking Steve off the ground with his hug.
The next morning, Steve came over. Tony met him outside of his building while he was getting out with Rhodey. He told his best friend to go along without him, that he and Steve needed to talk. Rhodey wasn’t happy about it, but left anyway, although not without giving Steve the nastiest look first.
Margaret entered the mansion without as much as a greeting to whoever had opened the door, marching purposefully up the stairs and straight to her godson’s bedroom. From the end of the corridor, she saw Howard banging his hand on the door of said bedroom, screaming obscenities, a bottle of scotch securely on his hand. He barely had time to turn his head towards the sound of clacking high heels on the wooden floor before he felt his nose break under Margaret’s fist. Howard fell backwards like a sack of potatoes and did not move anymore. The maid standing behind him screamed, hands on each side of her face, eyes wide in terror.
“We’ll take care of everything. Just show up, would you? It’ll be good, man, a good distraction from all this crap”.
“You mean your hobbit feet?” Steve teased, giving Tony the spoon so he could lick it, which the engineer gladly took.
“Check this out, Cap…”, he said, opening a folder that contained several documents, “Subject 04, male, 34 years old, 8 days”.
The nurse smiled at him and nodded back. Steve sat down in one of the uncomfortable chairs and took his cellphone from his pocket. He smiled sadly at Bucky’s message.
“You don’t know him. He’s not like any other civilian. He…” But whatever he was, they would never know because Rhodes was interrupted by a sudden loud noise that sounded an awful lot like an explosion.
“Well, yeah”, Clint replied, instantly defensive, “I mean, you’ve been together for two years, pretty much ever since you got defrosted like an overgrown chicken on steroids, and you always talk about how you’re going to spend the rest of your lives together. It was a safe assumption”.
Bucky laughed. “Stevie, you jump out of planes without a parachutes and used to pick fights with people ten times your size. I’ve always thought you were crazy, man”.
Carefully as to not call attention to himself, Peter used his very sharp nail to open the lock on the cage ― something he was certain he’d never done before in his life, not even in his human form. Upon hearing the click, the bear opened the metal door with his head and roared in delight, walking out of the cage. The goblins, finally realizing what was happening, froze in fear as the gigantic bear glared at them. He huffed and roared again, and took off after the goblins, who panicked and desperately tried to get away from the huge beast.
“It’s true. Even with you guys. I wasn’t your first choice for lab partners, Rhodey, you were stuck with me. And Pepper wanted to do the business class project with Bruce, but ended up with me. And Nat, when coach May paired me with you on PE, you were so angry you literally threw the ball so hard you broke one of the benches”.
“Payback for all those times you two idiots got drunk and almost gave me a heart attack. Also, everybody else was in it too”, she said, gesturing to Clint, Sam and Wanda.
“When we both know you actually dislocated it while trying to put an entire Supreme Hulk Hot Dog in your mouth”.
The workers exchanged a very confused look amongst themselves and turned their heads back to Iron Man.
“He looks the type; had a criminal record, a daughter starting college and was about to lose his house. He was an easy target. But anyway, it’s your call. He did give me some new information, though”.
“Crystal, ma’am”, Steve whispered, terrified, ignoring the loud snort coming from Bucky’s direction.
Bruce gave Steve his own glass ― he never drank at these functions anyway ― and the soldier gulped the entire glass.
“So, the charity ball is in two days. I already talked to Reed and asked him to talk business with Stane, to keep him occupied”, Steve said, playing with Tony’s hand as he spoke, “Greg and his men are going to be there, just as a precaution”.
Tony didn’t turn, nor did he acknowledge Natasha’s presence in any way, keeping his eyes focused on the suit in front of him. Natasha sighed.
Steve couldn’t decide what was worse: the fact that he had feelings for his very pregnant friend or the fact that Bucky –
They’d arrived at the restaurant not too long ago and Steve had promptly ordered a basket of garlic bread with cheese and some mozzarella sticks. When Bucky looked at him, as if asking what the hell he was doing, he just shrugged, blushing, and said that Tony loved those. It didn’t take long for Tony and Natasha to arrive.
“Shit”, Bucky swore softly under his breath just as Natasha exhaled, her shoulders suddenly going stiff with tension.
Steve let him go and took a few steps towards the kitchen, where Bucky most likely was. Tony watched him go, taking a long look at his boyfriend’s behind before turning and going to his father’s office. He had a lot of work to do.
Steve touched his earpiece, still in awe. “Yeah, I found him”, he let go of it and put his gun back in place, walking slowly towards Tony, “Are those… Are those bullet holes?!”
He spent the night sitting in a very uncomfortable chair beside her bed, all the while thinking of ways to get the money. As the night went on, his ideas got crazier and crazier, going from “selling everything they owned” to “robbing a bank”. By the time the sun finally showed up outside, Steve had made a decision.
Tony walked closer to the computer once again, sitting in the chair and making a disgusted face when he saw the blood on the keyboard. Still, he started typing once more, opening files just as Steve stood right behind him.
And the world stopped. He felt the cold glass beneath his hands as he pressed them against the window that separated him from the love of his life. He felt the tears streaming down his face as he stared at Steve, lying there, unmoving. He felt the Earth stop moving and saw the colors disappear from this world, slowly and gradually, turning everything blurry and gray. The sound of the heart monitor was the only thing he could hear. He did not hear Thor gasp. He did not hear Clint’s soft
Steve frowned, thinking. “Last thing I remember is making breakfast and eating it before leaving for a run. I made pancakes”.
“Tony”, Natasha said, kneeling down in front of her teammate, “you know he didn’t really mean it like that, right?”
Tony looked to his side, brown eyes meeting blue ones for the first time in three weeks, watching as his boyfriend smiled at him. And he wept.
They kissed for what felt like hours before finally resurfacing for air, keeping their foreheads together, noses almost touching.
He ran after him and grabbed his arm, trying to stop him from leaving the house. The others ran after them, stopping at the door, while Clint, Bruce and Thor, who were at the couch playing videogames, stopped and looked at them, confused.
Tony suddenly blushed furiously, which was very unlike him. Natasha snorted and Bruce whispered a soft
Jessica left Toomes’ house several hours later, feeling like shit. Talking to people really wasn’t her thing. She got into the car and took a second to decide whether to go straight to the fancy hotel Romanov had put her in or to go get something to eat. Her rumbling stomach made the decision for her.
“Come on, dude had surgery in the middle of the desert with no anesthetics. Can’t be worse than that, right?”
It took them no longer than a minute to clear the room. The now headless bodies were once again scattered across the floor, unmoving.
They stayed silent all the way back to the tower. Steve tried to get Tony to talk, but the brunette would only answer his questions with a nod and a curt reply, all the while with a smile that Steve knew he reserved specially for the press.
Steve suddenly stopped. He opened and closed his mouth and then frowned, as if measuring his next words very carefully. “I went through a growth spurt”.
“He’s not the only rich people around”, Steve joked, kissing his boyfriend’s forehead and pulling him to his chest, “You don’t have to be afraid anymore, Tony. You have an army now. We’re going to get you justice. We’re going to avenge you”.
“And then you stole a letter of transit and was almost court martialed for her”, Tony replied, grinning.
But Tony did not have time to answer him because, at that exact moment, they heard Bucky’s shout coming from right ahead.
under his breath, covering his mouth to stop the giggling from getting out. Clint, on the other hand, threw his head back so hard to laugh that he ended up falling from the kitchen island.
The files were then suddenly replaced by a folder named ‘Subject 0’, containing various documents and videos. Tony clicked on one of them and started reading aloud, so Steve could listen as well.
Days passed with no news. Natasha was growing more and more frustrated every day and it was noticeable by the way she sounded angrier every time they talked about the Beesly issue. There was no evidence that the man had actually run away – no credit card trail, no car, no sign of him on any of the city cameras. Natasha was sure he’d been killed, his body disposed off somewhere untraceable, and she was determined to find out where and how the poor man had died.
They sat there in silence for what seemed like hours, just eating ice cream and staring at nothing at all. When the carton was finally empty and the cookie dough gone, Tony turned to look at Steve.
“He’s trying to take Tony out of the game. A death right now would be thoroughly investigated, so he’s trying to gain time, keep my godson out”, the Director explained. She stayed silent for a second before sighing, “We need to bring Tony in on this. He’s the only one who can hack Stane’s computer”.
They made their orders and talked. And as they talked, Natasha got closer to Bucky. She bit her lips, sensually, before smiling at his stories. She threw her head back and laughed when Bucky told a joke. She ‘accidentally’ touched Bucky’s hand and arm constantly. And, most surprising of all, she found herself enjoying the conversation. She had been ready to fake smiles and laughter, but there was no need for that. She truly found him funny and was unexpectedly pleased with his stories about his older sister, Rebecca, and his niece. He showed her pictures upon pictures, and Natasha felt her heart flutter every time she heard the tone of pride in his voice. Soon enough, she had forgotten all about the plan.
“About that…”, Steve said, walking closer to Tony and taking his hands, kissing one softly, “I think I know who you are, Tony. And, if you let me, I think I can help you”.
Tony didn’t know how, but all at once his legs started working again and he quickly followed the medical crew, desperately trying to get close to the stretcher where Steve
. He was talking about Rogers. Stark had been paying a crew to search for the Valkyrie for years, ever since it had disappeared into the ocean, taking the man he loved with it. And now, they had found it... They had found Rogers... and SHIELD had his body... and Stark didn't know.
“You file an injunction. But to do that, you need actual prove that this dumb kid is not suitable for the job, that he actually poses a danger to the company, that he could cause irreparable harm to the company. And how do you do
"We're very sorry, Agent Romanoff. It won't happen again", one of them replied while the other nodded his agreement.
“Perhaps the spell did not merely erase the Captain’s memories, but did something else as well? Maybe it blocked something inside the Captain’s mind, making him incapable of falling in love with Mr. Stark again”.
Once again, Tony moved his hands and, with a snap of his fingers, a red line appeared on the hologram, showing everyone the exact path Natasha would have to make.
Tony took yet another breath and closed his eyes hard, before opening them with a determined look. “I want to stay and fight”.
When Happy, his driver, finally arrived, Steve already fancied himself half in love with the mechanic. The rain had stopped, so Tony walked the blonde outside, standing on the sidewalk as he got into the car.
It was strange... these emotions running through her body. It was none of her concern, not really; and besides, she worked for SHIELD. She was an agent; she was the Black Widow. She didn't have feelings... she had the mission. That was it. So she couldn't understand why she felt the need to warn Stark, to help him... He meant nothing to her. And yet, a part of her couldn't help but think about everything Stark had written in that diary, hidden away from everything and everyone.
There was a faint light coming from a small TV, but no sound. The room was poorly lit, but enough so that she could see the many newspapers stuck to the walls.
Steve discreetly looked around the table, trying to read his fellow agents. The red headed woman sitting next to him seemed unfazed by Fury’s introduction of the Director at first glance, but Steve could swear he’d noticed her eyebrows going slightly up for a moment before she schooled her features once more. The man on her side, however, had no such reservations. His eyes were wide, mouth hanging open, and he stayed like that for a few good seconds before the red head not so subtly kicked him in the chin, as if trying to remind the poor sap to be at least somewhat professional about the whole ordeal. Steve didn’t need to see Bucky’s face at all; his soft
“He was manipulating you; lightly calling out the abuser so it would seem he was on your side, but never doing anything to fully stop the abuse you suffered; playing your weaknesses: your need for parental approval, which is pretty typical on abused children, and your desire to protect those you loved, like Rhodey”, Natasha replied, looking away with a sigh, “I know something about being manipulated. When you’re surrounded by violence, it’s much easier to accept whatever kindness is bestowed upon you. It’s easier to just believe them”.
He didn’t know why he was so worried. Tony wasn’t his friend; he was just an attractive guy at Walmart, that’s all. However, he couldn’t get him out of his mind, nor could he convince himself to just walk away. So he stayed there for what felt like hours, even though he was pretty sure it had been only half an hour, pacing around like a lunatic, worried about a man he didn’t really know and a baby that wasn’t his.
“Uh”, Tony replied, confused, before huffing a laugh and saluting him back, “at ease, soldier. So, what happened to your friend?”
“I’d rather not talk about the skull in my workshop while I eat, thanks”, Tony replied, opening a container of food and moaning as the smell hit his nose.
Steve was waiting for Tony in the communal kitchen. Natasha, Clint and Thor were sitting at the kitchen island while Bruce cooked. The captain kept sneaking glances at the elevator, absently touching the pocket on the inside of his jacket. Every time he did it, Clint would squeal quietly, earning himself a slap from Natasha. When Steve turned to look at his teammates, he found them all staring at him with knowing smiles.
Looking very confused, Bucky got up and followed Natasha towards the bathrooms on the back. At that moment, Steve and Tony took a second to look around and finally noticed that the restaurant was virtually empty.
“He just… forgot he had something to do and then he remembered it and he ran… to do… the thing he forgot but remembered”.
“We could always get a divorce, right?” Bucky asked right before they stopped in front of a very well dressed man, probably Rhodey. Rhodey, who was ordained. Rhodey, who was going to marry them. Bind them forever in the eyes of… Well, everyone.
“What, eating dinner? It’s very easy, you take the food with the fork and put it in your mouth, then you chew and swallow”, the mechanic joked, looking at Steve over the menu he held, smiling.
With yet another deep sigh, Tony got into the elevator and pressed down, on his way to meet the good doctor. Maybe he would be able to help.
“Hey, hey, Mr. San Bernardo, quit getting my nice clean floor all wet”, said a voice in front of him in a joking tone.
The rest of the morning went by without too much trouble. At first, he tried to concentrate on his work, but failed miserably and quickly gave up, focusing all of his attention on making sure his date with Tony was the best the mechanic had ever had. He made reservations to the best and most expensive restaurant he could find. Then, he called Happy and told him to buy a box of Swiss chocolates. Steve was in the middle of deciding whether he should rent a limousine or not when Bucky came in, looking sly.
Natasha, as it turned out, was much less angry about the whole thing than they expected. She remained silent while Steve and Bucky told her everything that had happened during brunch and didn’t say a word, not even when they finished talking. Needless to say, they both just sat there, terrified, thinking of all the ways Natasha could kill them. After a while, however, she merely nodded.
. They tasted like late nights at the kitchen, where a little boy ate chocolate chip cookies and drank warm milk. They tasted like a long conversation about robots and space and science. They tasted like the loving hug of a butler that was more a father to him than his own blood father. They tasted like home, the home that Tony had desperately wished for as a child, and only got glimpses of.
wasn’t in the mood for a party. And he knew that, if they threw one, Steve would probably want to bring his new girlfriend and Tony really really
“Definitely”, Steve said, taking a sip of his glass and looking at Bucky, “At least this time nobody woke up in the middle of a corn field with no pants on”.
Steve’s face went red and he opened his mouth, probably to deny everything, but thought better of it and just groaned, covering his face.
“Fine”, he managed to get out in a somewhat sane voice, “I don’t think you’re Bucky’s type. Or Sam’s, for that matter”.
“I’m fine. And for the record, when I said I was into some pain, I was thinking more like a spanking or something”.
“Well”, Wanda started, thoughtful, “He may not have the memories of Tony, but he should still be attracted to him, shouldn’t he? Attraction has nothing to do with whether he remembers Tony or not”.
Overall, Steve could not be happier. Everything was working perfectly in his life. His boyfriend, who he loved very much and who loved him in return, was starting to trust him enough to share more and more about his previous life. His friends not only accepted his boyfriend, but also welcomed him to the group with arms wide open, treating him like he was one of them. And, of course, the cherry on top: Steve and Tony had confessed their deep feelings for each other and were now officially a couple. Life could not be more perfect, which was probably why destiny decided to throw some rain on their parade.
Tony’s mouth fell open. “You’re in the tower? How the hell did you manage to do that? The Jericho wasn’t connected to any networks, that’s not possible”.
Jessica stood there, not really believing what she had just witnessed. She looked around once more, as the pieces of the puzzle slowly fell into place. Anton Vanko had worked on this arc reactor thing with Howard Stark before being discovered as a spy and sent to prison. Apparently, his son, Ivan, hadn’t taken this very well. It was obvious the Vankos had a grudge against the Starks. And it was even more obvious that Ivan had become a bit… unstable after everything that had happened. He hadn’t killed the Starks for money, he’d done for revenge. He’d kept the evidence of his crime and kept it on repeat on the shitty TV so his dead father could watch it again and again and again.
Tony looked at him as he laughed and smiled, really smiled, for the first time since his conversation with Tiberius. And in that moment, laughing along with the man he’d literally just met in a supermarket, Tony finally felt like maybe things would be alright again.
“He’s a 6 feet tall sack of muscles with blond hair and blue eyes. He could be fucking Scrooge and I guarantee Stark is gonna climb him like a Christmas tree”, Clint replied taking a bite of his ham and jam sandwich, making Bucky wrinkle his nose in disgust at him. Steve, on the other hand, turned into a deep red.
“Nice to meet you, Tony. I’m Clint and this is my husband, Phil”, the blonde man introduced himself, pulling his husband, an older man with brown hair, by the shoulders.
Tony stopped for a second, coffee mug still in hand, trying to process what he had just heard. He felt as if he’s insides were slowly freezing, his body going cold and numb.
Natasha had called as well. She apologized for setting Steve up with someone else, berating herself for not noticing anything was amiss before. Tony forgave her, of course. It wasn’t her fault. It was his. His fault for believing in Steve, for thinking he could have this. That he could actually be happy.
“He’s been getting these weird calls lately. Something about a deadline. He gets jumpy every time, scared even. I don’t know what it is, he wouldn’t tell me, but I know it’s bad. It’s gotta be bad to scare a guy like Obadiah”.
“I forgive you”, Tony replies, smiling, “There’s nothing to forgive, but if it’s so important to you to hear it, then I forgive you”.
“And Jones told me she has a lead. She’s going to get it checked out soon”, Natasha offered with a nod.
“Magical friendship bracelets?” Clint asked, putting his hand up and showing the Captain the weird looking watchband in his wrist, “Yep, got them”.
The house was full, as it usually was on weekends. Bucky and Natasha were sitting together on the couch, his arm around her shoulders as they talked with Pepper and Rhodey. Clint and Sam were sitting on the floor, playing videogames, shouting at each other when the other tried to cheat, while Morgan cheered them on. Thor and Bruce, the newest members of their little family of misfits, were in the kitchen, helping Steve and Tony organize the many containers of food.
“Cool. So,”, he started talking but then stopped, looking down at Steve’s notebook and then taking it from Steve’s hand,“…Wait, is this… Is this me?”
They talked until their orders were ready and then they talked some more as they ate. Steve thought he might actually die when Tony started moaning after every bite. He knew he was absurdly attracted to the brunette, but that was getting ridiculous.
“Look, Buck and I, were friends. We’ve been friends ever since we were kids and sometimes we get drunk and we do stupid stuff and we got drunk and thought it would be funny to send you an invitation to our fake wedding so maybe you would send us like a gift or something and then you called and you wanted to pay for the whole thing and I kinda wanted to spend time with you so we didn’t tell you anything and then it just got bigger and bigger until we couldn’t tell you because you were spending a shitload of money on this and we felt so bad but I can’t marry Bucky because I’m pretty sure Natasha would cut my balls off and I kinda really like you and I wanted to ask you out and I wouldn’t be able to if I married Bucky and I’m just SO SORRY”.
He stumbled, landed on his knees, and forced himself to get back up again, gritting his teeth. He was fairly sure it wasn't a bad hit, but with his hands caught behind his back, he couldn't put pressure on the wound, so it was bleeding freely. That really wasn't a good thing in carnivore country. Not good at all.
"Oh, I'm much too busy for that, don't worry. Thank you for your time," Steve said, as politely as he could. "I can show myself out."
Steve walked over to her, and the other two had gathered there as well. She was still sitting on the floor, looking past them, her eyes wide, worrying her lip. Whatever it was that she was seeing, it clearly wasn't good.
"There's no need for that. It's no more dangerous than any of the traveling we've done so far," Tony assured him. "You just focus on enjoying the rest of your trip, and I'll see you again when you get back home."
"The costume?" Tony frowned. "I wouldn't mind having you out of it, but there's no hurry. I love the costume. I'd love to—oh."
This was getting ridiculous. Steve crossed his arms and took a step forwards, glowering. He didn't know what his face looked like, but considering the physique of his frame, he assumed it would be suitably menacing. "Just tell me already," he growled.
"Do you really have to go? I'm sure Sam's family would be happy to host you, too," Steve said, not even trying to hide the pleading tone as he hugged Tony closer.
"You gave me hope. That's something I hadn't felt in ages," Seren said, as if she could guess what Tony was thinking. "If only I could give you some of it back now that you need it."
Tony kept going, speaking of the passionate affair he'd ended up having with her, which Steve couldn't help but feel slightly envious about. But some time after they'd left Venice and Tony ended up on a tangent about foreign politics and how he'd eventually found himself in Siberia, Steve lost track of the story, lulled to sleep by Tony's voice and the sound of his heartbeat mixing with the thrum of the ever mysterious repulsor pump.
In the early morning light, the scene around them was like a reproduction of that warehouse fire where Steve had first met Tony: an expanse of burned rubble with a few sections of walls left standing, with broken timber and bent metal everywhere. The smell of smoke lingered in the air, overpowering the scent of the sea. Steve kept expecting that just like last time, he'd hear a sound from the middle of the wreckage, see some movement, and witness Tony rising from the ashes again. Instead, there was only silence and stillness.
“So I’m stuck in here with him. Terrific,” Tony complained, exaggerating his annoyance to cover how nervous the situation made him.
He grabbed the first bottle that happened to be on the shelf, not bothering to look at the label. It was his bar. Only nice things in it. The really expensive stuff was stashed away on the higher shelves so he wouldn't waste it while on a binge.
"If James shows up again, I'll try to grab the keys from him and throw them to you," he tried again. "I don't know if I'll manage, but I promise to do my best."
Tony let go and just grabbed hold of Steve's pecs instead, massaging them. "Nothing to apologize for. No particular reason why it would be. From my perspective, it's all top-notch, still."
"Okay. I can stick around a little longer." Steve pats Tony's hand where it's resting on top of the covers, and settles into a more comfortable position in his seat.
Instead of the back door that they'd used on Steve's first night, they went for the front entrance to the workshop, a garage door opening to a small side street. By the time they got into visual range of the place, it was obvious the battle was long over. There were several police vehicles parked close by. Looming tall and dark among them and the smaller figures of SI drones were several SHIELD drones. There was smoke rising from the front door, which had clearly been blown open.
Stark hung his head, too, heaving out a shaky breath that was loud enough for Bucky to hear from several paces away.
Steve caught one last glimpse of Tony, on the ground, leaning on one hand, the other splayed over his chest. He was still glowing, but not as brightly as the sea of flames around him.
Tony settled down half sprawled on top of Steve, his head on Steve's shoulder, lacing his fingers with Steve's where the sticky mess of their come coated Steve's stomach. They stayed there in silence for several long minutes, content, letting their racing hearts settle. In the afterglow, all the warmth surrounding Steve was beginning to grow stifling, but the thought of moving didn't even cross his mind.
He focused on his breathing for a few seconds, on the noise of the car around them, the seat behind his back. He knew the memories weren't real, and this was. He was okay. He'd pulled through. Things would be better now.
"I can't fill in those gaps for you, not really," Tony said, at length, breaking the quiet. "I don't remember."
Steve really didn't feel like coffee. "Tony texted me," he went on, replying the question Sam had refrained from asking. "He thinks we're soulmates. Had it tested, too, and sent me the numbers to confirm it."
There was no quick answer this time. Instead, there was no answer at all, although he waited for five minutes, then ten, and fifteen.
Steve couldn't quite bring himself to believe what he was hearing. "You're not there anymore, though. Why not swap frames?"
That gives Tony pause, his previous misgivings rearing their ugly head again. "Then shouldn't you be exploring all this with another android instead of me?"
Nothing would surprise Tony anymore, not after everything they’d gone through in the past months, from megalomaniac alien conquerors to magic and alternate universes. They’d been through a lot, and they’d worked side by side to survive it. Tony and Steve had shaken hands and smiled in front of cameras and told the world that the band was back together. They’d gotten very good at pretending everything was at status quo again, with ‘pretending’ being the operative word.
The mysterious Maya. The person Steve had had even less luck finding than Tony, who might hold the key to everything. For once, Steve was in the right place at the right time. He was so curious to hear what she'd have to say to Tony that he didn't even feel bad for eavesdropping.
Steve raises his eyebrows in surprise, and yeah, Tony probably doesn't seem the type to be a history buff. Which he isn't, he just used to admire some heroes of the past when he was younger.
"So, all that stuff in your magazine, it really happened?" Bucky had to ask. As much as he knew the others' stance on talking to the prisoner, he was too curious not to.
As soon as Rhodey was entirely out of his armor, he started sorting through its pieces, assessing the damage to see if he could repair it. Pepper sat down, resting against a wall, her eyes glazed over; Steve wasn't sure if she was skimming the news feeds or just weary and sad. Happy had started pacing again.
The Mayor's living quarters, which Bucky hadn't seen before, were as impeccable and carefully decorated as her office. The furniture was all very stylish and not overly ornamental. There were paintings on the walls showing bustling cityscapes that seemed reminiscent of the outside world—Bucky could've sworn one was a depiction of Manhattan at the turn of the century.
Two of the men closest to Tony suddenly burst out in flames, completely engulfed. Another window shattered, and inside the warehouse behind Tony, something exploded, making the ground tremble.
Looking around, he spotted Bucky to his left, closing manacles around the wrists of someone who must be the guard he'd taken down. To his right, in the far corner, was Pearly-eye.
Looking down into the next valley and the hills beyond, Steve still doesn't see any sign of a single living soul. He descends the slope all the way to the valley floor and turns around in a full circle, scanning the surroundings. He doesn't think Tony's shout could've carried much further than this, but the landscape is as still as ever.
He keeps going through the day and well into the twilight, pausing only to drink and to eat the rest of his brunch bird, until the gathering clouds turn the landscape dark in spite of the midnight sun. With so little light left, moving in the often slippery and rocky terrain turns perilous. Gaining more headway over Tony isn't worth chancing a broken ankle.
Even if Tony had changed, there was too much of a resemblance. It would take an incredibly talented actor to pull that off. The thought that he might be an impersonator hadn't even occurred to Steve before Pepper's mysterious words. Steve knew a long life would inevitably change a person, and that sounded like a far more likely explanation for what had happened to Tony.
When he came across a more lively-looking street, he slowed down again. His expensive frame and clothes would make him stick out like a sore thumb wherever he went. That made it all the more ironic that he actually had no money available; accessing his bank account would mean giving out identity information that would be easy to trace.
The figure wasn't wearing a featureless uniform, but a SHIELD one, and the face beneath the helmet was familiar. Rumlow.
They'd been at it for hours. Whatever it was that made Tony run as hot as he did, it also seemed to give him stamina to match Steve's. He hadn't thought he'd ever come across someone like that. It had been incredible. Thinking back to it, it felt unreal, making him wonder if it might've just been a vivid dream, after all.
It's that night, at the gala, that Tony hears of his weapons being used by terrorists in an ongoing hostage situation. He doesn't stop to explain to his two bodyguards why he's suddenly in such a hurry to return home.
They'd been through this several times before they'd left Cornucopia, Natasha telling them all they needed to know about the North and its people. It was a relief to have someone around who not only knew the situation well, but was willing to discuss it in depth, now that the first shock of her revelation had settled.
Randall looked away and blinked, and the wall closest to Steve turned from clouds to a mirror surface.
"Okay. If you feel you're up to it." Steve gave Tony's hand a pat, then let go and sat up straight, clearly steeling himself for what was to come, full of trepidation.
Tony grabbed it and and passed it to Seren. "Go," he told her. "Hurry." She'd know what to do. The other dinosaur prisoners depended on her.
The sight of Tony pulling off his helmet and grinning at Steve, his whole face alight, his hair mussed, was like out of some commercial. "Damn, I need to build myself something like this," he said, combing his fingers through his hair. "Just need to finish that suborbital drone first."
"Huh. Still the same song. I was actually wary of you, you know? Those SHIELD bigwigs thought so highly of you, I was worried thawing you would turn out to be a mistake. Instead, you're just another pathetic, emotional loser. A perfect match for him, I have to say," Stane taunted him. "I was going to kill you right away and be done with it, but maybe I'll keep you around a little longer. Let you watch him die, first."
"Nothing so far, but she's probably with Stane. He should be awake in the new clone by now, but he'll need time to catch up," Steve said. "Do you have any news?"
"I didn't think she would, but I didn't expect her to ally herself with the mob, either, nor to lie to them multiple times," Tony said. "But no, I don't think she did, not really. What she's saying makes more sense. I can imagine myself in that scenario, going for the last resort when there's nothing else left."
"I was wondering how he figures into all of this. Do you think he's in league with Hydra?" Steve asked. The very idea sounded utterly wrong to his ears. Even if Tony had had his character flaws, he never would’ve joined ranks with those villains—but Steve couldn't claim to know him that well anymore. Maybe he would, now.
The first and oldest, of course, was booze. He didn't think he had a problem, not really, but Jarvis had started nagging at him, citing that the added cardiovascular risks from drinking didn't play well together with the added cardiovascular risks from the arc reactor still lodged in his sternum. He couldn't really argue against that. Then again, he also didn't care very much. If he ended up living a few years less than he otherwise would've, what did it matter?
"He has, though," Miss Potts said, her voice as soft as Steve's. "A lot has changed while you were on ice, Mr. Rogers."
"I'm sure he would've, if we hadn't been covering for you. See, we've been broadcasting a false signal matching yours since you left the station," Natasha explained. "I saw the specs for your frame. We know what surveillance Tony's got on you."
"He's originally a combat model, but for now, we'll just see how this goes," Tony adds, on the off chance that Rhodey might know more about military androids and have some information concerning Steve's enigmatic background.
His bike, a third generation H-D Wingless Light Aircycle, was his most prized possession. It was the product of an era when personal off-ground traffic had been new and exciting, and he would never trade it for the sheltered flying cabins that most other people rode these days. It had been a part of his cover on an early assignment, soon after he'd become a full Agent, and he'd negotiated a deal to buy it for himself later.
"That good?" Tony asked when he let go. "I can tell it's not skin, definitely, but the texture's very nice."
Tony feels his heart skip, slow down, the pauses between beats growing longer and longer. The air feels too thin.
He got out of bed, crossed the quiet building to the gym, and started pummeling the punching bag like if he just hit it hard enough, he'd a rip hole in the fabric of the multiverse and bring back the man he loved.
Steve generally tended to assume the best of people, and always gave them the benefit of the doubt. Tony's opposing attitude of considering everyone an idiot unless proven otherwise had always been among his main character flaws. Still, when it came to Justin Hammer, Steve was inclined to agree with Tony's assessment of the man just based on his first impression.
"You should probably start slow," he told Stark in English as he handed him the bowl of stew and a full jug of water. "Don't want to make yourself sick."
"No. Back then, he wouldn't have." She looked as if she had more to say on the topic, opened her mouth, but then pursed her lips and shook her head. "You'll find out."
Tony hadn't worked with amoromics software in years; after the early days, he'd gone back to engineering, leaving the bioinformatics to the top specialists he'd recruited. Still, a quick online search and scrolling through a few pages were enough to remind him of the basics. Checking a single pair of subjects for INCS was a non-standard task, but not a particularly difficult one. Being drunk and out of practice wouldn't stop Tony from doing it.
Steve counted the seconds in his mind, from sixty to zero and then upwards again. He didn't quite get up to ninety.
It was clear that Tony, just like Ultron, thought there was more to Steve's day than what he was telling, and no wonder. He knew his tracking data for the day would look suspicious, with glitches and discontinuities here and there. There wasn't anything he could do to fix that, so he'd just have to hope Tony wouldn't push the matter. Later, if he managed to gain Tony's trust, and learned to trust Tony himself, maybe he could reveal the truth about what had happened. Unfortunately, the one brief conversation he'd had today already made him think he might've been overly positive about that.
Pepper was still looking decidedly uneasy, but she bit her lip and nodded. "All right. Bend forwards."
"He has to. They're faster and more maneuverable. We won't stand a chance," Rhodey cut her short, his voice firm.
"I can't begin to imagine how you feel after everything that you've been through, and I sympathize, I really do," Obie says, and gives Tony's shoulder a squeeze. "It's just that the stock market doesn't."
The initial shock starting to settle, he realized that no gunshots or additional explosions had followed the first one. Hopefully, that meant someone had just wanted to scare them and to block their path instead of hurting them.
"Why do it at all, though? You hate me so much, you'd risk your life to get rid of me?" Steve asked. The raw emotions radiating from him were overpowering, but difficult to name: the anger was still there, but also other things, despair, longing, maybe fear?
"Right. You start the timer and hop on your steed here. I'll go ahead and open the door for you, and we leg it like our lives depend on it," Bucky summarized. "Hopefully your clawed friend from the cell is close by, because we won't have time to wait for her."
Pepper raised her eyebrows in surprise. "She did. She was in the rival team I mentioned. How do you know her name?"
"I'll try not to, from now on," Tony said, his voice soft but warm. He let go of Steve's hand to wrap his arm around Steve's shoulders in a loose hug. "Thank you for telling me that. I appreciate it."
Tony pulled away his hand, sudden shock and confusion clawing at his chest like some glitch in the repulsor pump. Everything had been perfect, but somehow, he had ruined it, and for the life of him, he didn't know what it was that he'd done.
"So, where do we go from here?" he asks aloud. He doesn't expect Steve to have an answer, but he does. The man with a plan, as always.
Tony was sitting down in one of the chairs, his body still looking like the one that had died. Steve wouldn't have expected anything different; minds tended to default to what they were used to, even when they weren't in a frame. Tony's clothing was familiar, too. Not something fancy that would've fit the surroundings, but a faded old T-shirt and jeans.
He was going to do the rational thing and wait until the afternoon before going back to Brooklyn. For now, he drove over to the police headquarters. If there had been any fires during the evening or night, Bucky should've found out by now.
Steve stayed by Tony's side, watching the older man. Around Bucky, the others were offering their assistance to the dinosaurs, binding wounds and handing out food. They also asked Bucky if he needed anything, but he shook his head.
"Many experts think they might be much more common than that," Howard returned, as if he'd completely missed the point Steve was trying to make. Knowing him, he was doing it on purpose. "If we knew more about the phenomenon, it could be different. If we could understand why some people match, then maybe we could find all the matches that go undiscovered—it would change everything. That's why studies like this are important." He picked up the journal, shaking it at Steve.
Steve tried to twist his head and to squirm away from Tony, but Tony moved over to straddle his thighs. Somehow, his weight was overpowering, pinning Steve down as effectively as a set of restraints. One of Tony's hands pushed him down by the shoulder, and the other went to his throat, closing around it, not quite tight enough to choke him. Not yet, though the promise was clearly there.
While he generally performs the menial tasks he's given without overt complaint, Steve bristles when Tony once happens to mention it feels weird to have a combat android serving him his morning coffee.
"Seems to me like you know exactly what you're doing," Steve said half accusingly, ruffling the hair at the back of Tony's head.
"The only monsters on this island are you!" Paola yelled at him, eyes full of anger unlike Tony was used to seeing on the Dinotopians' faces.
Pepper got up from the couch as well, her eyes still on him. "So, that's your solution? You're just going to ignore this and drown it in liquor?"
He remembered how he'd felt when he'd gotten the email about the matching results, and the exact words on the message:
It seemed like another wordless message to Steve. "You want me to show you? Tell you how I like it?" he checked.
The first thing Steve did after he'd showered, dressed and breakfasted was to take one of the limos to pay a visit to the police station and see if they had any news. Of course, he could've just called, but that would've defeated the entire purpose of this trip. On the way, he asked Ultron about his access restrictions, and got the answer he expected.
"You're not what I expected," Tony commented, in such a startling parallel to Steve's thoughts that he let go of Tony's leg and sat back to face him.
"Mr. Kamski sent me to you," Steve repeats, still standing up, hands behind his back so that his shoulders look even wider and his waist even narrower.
Tony insisted that they order a meal at his expense from some fancy 175th floor place offering fusions of cuisines that Steve hadn't even heard of before. Steve tried to say that he could afford to pay his own half, but Tony wouldn't hear of it, arguing that the least he could do after giving Steve a weird fit instead of a good time was to buy him a nice dinner, ignoring Steve's repeated reminders that said weird fit had been just about the best time he'd ever had. Tony could be just as stubborn as Steve, when he set his mind to it. In the end, Steve gave in—this was just food. He didn't want to turn it into an actual argument.
"Fine!" Steve barks, his hands raised in fists. Tony does his best not to shrink back, even if the look is undeniably intimidating. At the back of his mind, he sees Steve crouched over him, shield raised. "You want to get rid of me? You want to deal with everything yourself?" Steve goes on. "Fine. Have it your way. Enjoy the outdoors, Stark."
The dingy little police station suddenly made more sense. It was a hideout, or rather, a way of hiding in plain sight. "You're the resistance?"
They'd taken him to a mid-level hospital that Fury had picked, promising that the staff were good people with no loyalty to SHIELD. The doctors there hadn't wanted to put Tony in cryo because of the added risk of complications involved in freezing and thawing his brain without a backup. They hadn't wanted him conscious, either, because while no one knew what state he'd wake up in, it'd certainly be highly stressful for him. Until Tony's identity was officially verified, he was still penniless and paperless, outside the system, which meant that the costly operation to get him out of his failing body wasn't an option. That left him stuck on external life support in an induced coma, which the doctors promised should keep him alive for at least a month.
Steve stood up, feeling desperately like he needed to do something, anything, to make things better, right there and then, even though there wasn't anything he could do.
"Is this really worth the risks?" Tony went on. "There's no telling if he can really help me keep myself in check. His powers might be similar, but they're a result of science gone wrong. Mine are, well, who knows what. We're not the same."
Tony hummed, his fingers clenching and releasing the fabric of Steve's slacks. "What's it like?" he asked, again in that more hesitant way, his voice sounding fragile. Unfortunately, Steve had no idea what he was talking about.
There go Tony's hopes that Kamski might miss the anxious thud of his heart. Of course he doesn't, considering how his fingertips are resting over Tony's ribs.
That doesn't sound too bad; Steve is sure he could cover the distance in a day, if he knew which way to go. He's not sure if Tony could've spotted the town with whatever he's got on that kite. Even if he has, Steve doubts he would've chosen to go straight for it without checking out the hut, the weather being as bad as it is.
Tony's hand loosened its hold, his mouth slipping away from Steve's cock with a wet sound. "Steve? I don't want to hurt you, okay?" he said, giving the impression that he was having second thoughts, too. "I don't mind how tough you are, you'd better tell me if it's too much."
He told himself it was just a combination of the adrenalin of the fight starting to fade and of Tony's uncanny resemblance to Howard. Looking at his face was such a strange experience because of it: there was so much of his father in there, although he actually looked older than Howard had when Steve had last seen him. It was the most palpable reminder of the time that had passed that Steve had yet come across.
The view zoomed out to reveal the rest of the VR chair he was in and his torn and bloodstained clothing. Next to him stood the younger version of the very same frame, uninjured, in an immaculate suit and an all-too-familiar smirk on his face.
One turn brought him to a wide but very empty stretch of street with the unmistakable figure of a drone only around fifty meters away from him. He froze in his tracks. After the first second of panic, he realized that although the design wasn't too far off, this was much taller than Ultron's drones, and matte black in color except for the gray SHIELD logo on its back. Hoping that this drone was on a regular patrol or after some street-level criminals instead of looking for him, Steve backed away as slowly and noiselessly as he could and picked another direction. As soon as he estimated he was out of audiovisual range, he took off at a run again. Every corner he rounded after that had him expecting the worst, but there were no more drones, neither SHIELD's nor Ultron's.
He wouldn't have a lot of time, so he only considered for a few seconds before going for it. As noiselessly as he could, he moved to the edge of the bed to pick up Tony's coveralls from where they'd ended up last night, bunched up on the floor. He'd noticed three pockets yesterday: one at the breast, two at the waist. He quickly checked each of them. He found nothing unexpected: a wallet with a rather disturbing amount of cash, a bunch of keys, and a big, fancy Swiss Army knife.
Hoping with every cell in his frame and every bit of data in his mind that he wasn’t too late, Steve picked Tony up from the floor and hurried for the exit.
She must be referring to the New York University campus, maybe fifteen minutes' walk away. That gave Steve a new direction to pursue with his investigation: contact the university and ask around to see if anyone there could tell him more about Maya.
He hasn't visited the CyberLife Tower before. Its gleaming glass silhouette looms over Detroit. Honestly, he thinks it's ugly, and entirely ridiculous; it's clearly made to look expensive. It's like someone set out to design the most futuristic thing imaginable, and was then told to make it even taller and shinier. Maybe that's to be expected from a company that sprang from nothing to a household brand almost overnight.
"Of course. Anything's possible, as long as we have nothing solid. Occam's Razor would suggest otherwise, though. It's been years since anyone last tried to off me, and now twice within two months? I'd say it's more likely there's just one culprit."
The stairs leading to the loft would be challenging to negotiate while carrying someone, so Steve went for the easier and closer option instead. The sheepskin rug was only a few steps away, and looked soft and inviting. Moving very carefully, Steve crossed the floor to it and set Tony down on the rug, where he lay down on his back.
Steve didn't want him to go. Their shared trip across Dinotopia had been perfect, almost dream-like, with new wonders to discover every day, and the man he had fallen in love with by his side. Starting off from Tony's house close to Volcaneum on the west coast of the island, they had traveled through the Hadro Swamps, listening to the duck-billed dinosaurs' hoots in the dusk, to the fairy-tale magnificence of Waterfall City. They'd followed the waters of the Polongo river down to Sauropolis, the capital, with its bustling streets full of both humans and dinosaurs, and visited many picturesque small villages in the foothills of the Forbidden Mountains.
With the combination of Tony's skill and the sensations that were skirting the edge of almost too much, Steve didn't last very long at all. He grabbed handfuls of Tony's coveralls as he started to come, the back of his head thunking against the wall, his back arched away from it. He expected Tony to stop, but he didn't. He kept going, licking and sucking even more intensely, as if he wanted every last drop of Steve's come, swallowing it down.
Tony took hold of the other one as well, his fingers pinching tighter. When Steve still didn't react, he kept increasing the pressure, but that was all it felt like: pressure, without any excitement to it.
Since Steve now has shelter and even some food, he decides that he might as well wait at the hut for a while, let his clothes dry, and see if Tony shows up, just to set his mind at rest.
"SR100," Steve replies, holding his head a little higher. "I'm a prototype. Only three were ever made. The other two are no longer functional."
"I'm not looking for a fight," Steve told the two. Strictly speaking, that was true, even if he would've welcomed more action. "I just want some answers. If I let go, are you going to behave yourselves?"
Tony settled down in front of Steve, a relieved smile on his lips. "Definitely. Better than for ages. You? I hope that rough wake-up wasn't a sign of how your night was."
This hadn't exactly been Steve's plan, but he had to admit he was quite proud of himself. He ran his hand over the warm, sticky mess, some of the last droplets landing on his fingers. Tony shuddered, relaxing into the cushions as if he were trying to sink into them.
"Would if I could, ma'am," Ultron still resisted. "See, if some blockhead hadn't shot at the control wiring, this would be a lot easier. I
At first, Steve wondered if he'd misunderstood the code, because that didn't make any sense. He found himself staring at his extended pinky finger, considering for the first time what a bizarre way of communicating this was, when it struck him what Tony was trying to tell him.
"Aren't there some ruins in the Rainy Basin, where you're going?" Steve asked, shifting the topic towards something that had been weighing on his mind.
The weapon touched his temple, and everything flared up in electric agony again, his body convulsing on the concrete, but this time, it only lasted for seconds. Then, there was nothing.
Steve couldn't contain a sharp, surprised breath at what he was hearing. Just as he'd been thinking, earlier today, about how he would've prefered something deeper and more serious than what they had—but he'd also been thinking about the many reasons why that wouldn't work between the two of them, the fundamentally different ways he and Tony saw the world. Really, considering how shallow Tony's take on everything around him seemed to be, Steve hadn't expected to hear something so emotional from him. He'd had no idea that Tony might care for him beyond the attractive frames he donned.
He had to be wrong about this. Iron Man couldn't be flirting with him. He couldn't be offering what Steve thought he might be. Suddenly, Steve's heart was pounding, and he found himself wishing he wasn't naked, because the mere thought of Iron Man, still mostly armor-clad, touching him in a completely different way was a turn-on like nothing else Steve could imagine.
"Very good, that's very good," Randall said, offering him a smile that might have been cute if it hadn't looked so practiced. "Now, I would like you to go through a set of exercises for me, so we can establish that all the neuromotor connections are correctly mapped."
Tony grinned at him, making that fluttery feeling in his gut even more intense. Things were moving much too fast, and Steve was having trouble thinking straight.
"Not long enough, if you ask me. Less than an hour. You need time to recover." Jarvis's hand caught Tony's wrist, no doubt to take his pulse. "You're at our camp by the shore, not far from Crabb Castle. What do you remember?"
"Let me do the work," Steve suggested. He took hold of one of Tony's worn sneakers and opened the straps.
"I've—" Stane stammered, then turned towards Steve, eyes flashing. "You tricked me! You were wired!"
It occurs to Steve that it's a good thing he was too dispirited to even try CPR when he first found Tony. Considering how he's hanging by a thread, a well-meant attempt at chest compressions might have stopped his heart. As it is, his condition is obviously critical.
'Iceland announces plan for nationwide, publicly funded soulmate screening initiative,' the title said.
"I thought my clothes felt itchy against my skin, but I seriously didn't realize it'd be like this. Whoa." Tony ran his own fingers down his front, letting out a sigh, his eyelids fluttering.
He unzips Tony's hoodie, revealing his tank top, with the glow of the thirium reactor shining through the white fabric.
Bucky had decided to stay as impartial as he could when it came to Stark, but he still couldn't help feeling intrigued watching the man work. Currently, Stark was cataloguing every piece of technology in the large room, from huge silvery armor plates to the tiniest cogwheels and bolts, rearranging them into more or less ordered piles and writing down what he'd found on the piece of parchment he'd been provided with.
The first combatant Steve reached looked identical to the rest: dressed in featureless fatigues, a mask covering most of the face. Steve caught a glimpse of dark eyes with long lashes and heavy eyebrows before the person in question pulled out two knives and slashed at him. The movement was so quick that Steve was barely able to dodge, even with his post-human reflexes. He struck back as fast as he could, his trademark shield aimed at his opponent's midriff, but he was too slow, missing by a good half a meter.
"Not sulking," Steve said, and stood up by the table, taking a commanding stance. "There was something I wanted to tell you all before we head out. It's about this mission. I have reason to suspect that it might not be what it seems. Unfortunately, I don't have anything more concrete than that to give you, but I'd like to ask all of you to take extra care out there today."
"It's very much what I want," Tony said. He opened the buttons on Steve's pants, pulled them down to his knees, and crouched in front of him to nuzzle Steve's cock through his shorts.
After a few more strokes, Tony followed, his head thrown back, moaning wantonly. His come burned like hot wax where it landed on Steve's skin, and Steve's hand went to it on reflex, relishing the feeling of it while the aftershocks of his own orgasm shook his body. It was pain, danger, excitement and pleasure all together. It was Tony, and he enjoyed all of it.
Tony found himself holding his breath when Steve got back, unsure of where they would go from here. Had the amicable relationship they'd had so far been irrevocably shattered by embarrassment and misunderstandings? Would their days from now on be full of forced normalcy, their nights spent with an even larger rift between them, with the fear of accidentally ending up too close again?
He'd thought Tony had died, not long ago. The memory of seeing the news, the image of Tony's Malibu mansion as a smoking ruin, was still fresh: how he'd tried to feel something about it, prodded at the idea of Tony being gone like testing an injury to see how bad it was. All he'd gotten was numbness and disbelief. It hadn't felt real. When it'd turned out Tony was, in fact, alive and fine, the relief had been equally underwhelming. He'd not seen Tony since. Considering that Steve was now a fugitive from his own employer, he wasn't expecting to, either, not anytime soon.
Now that Tony put it like that, he understood Tony's reasoning. He'd only ever had the one face; he'd see things differently from Steve, who was used to wearing many. He simultaneously cared less about the particular frame he was in, but also held his birth body, his original face, in a special place in a different way. It wasn't so much the face that he needed to wear to feel like himself, it was the face that connected him to his past and to his family.
Saying goodbye to Thor and Steve outside the shiny new Avengers complex, he felt more relieved than anything else, even if it was mixed with some nostalgia from Steve. That had to be all Steve's. Tony wasn't nostalgic.
"The people I talked to told me he was brought in around three weeks ago," Natasha confirmed. "No one had seen him since, but there are rumors that he's building something for the Northerners."
Steve didn't want to push Tony. He was surprised enough that he'd gotten this far, and that Tony didn't seem angry at him anymore. Instead, he looked resigned and sad, gazing into the distance, eyes unfocused, like he wasn't really seeing the lovely landscape in front of him.
Steve grimaced, not liking the sound of those words. "Start with the bad. Better get that over with."
A big, heavy hand landed on his shoulder, and as he turned his head to look behind him, he saw that it belonged to an equally massive mobster, half a head taller and nearly twice as wide as him. "Not so fast, buddy," the big man said.
Kamski casts him a dubious glance over his tea. "Surely a man of your intelligence doesn't need help for something as simple as that."
"How do you—wait, you said you were there, that night. You heard the whole story when Maya told it?" Tony asked.
It had definitely been before that fateful night, then. Steve sighed, some of his excitement fading, and picked up the wallet to go through its contents. Like the receptionist had told him, there wasn't a single bill inside it. In fact, it was almost empty, except for a handful of business cards for Anthony E. Stark, with the Stark company logo, Tony's phone number and address.
Steve read the article several times, but a lot of the terminology in it was completely unfamiliar to him and only served to confuse him further. After several searches and a lot of reading, it all slowly began to make sense, and yet, he still couldn't quite wrap his mind around what he'd learned.
"You expected something like this to happen, didn't you?" Tony asks. He's been suspecting it ever since Steve's awakening: that Kamski set them up, like an experiment, since he knew of Tony's complicated feelings towards androids and of Steve's potential.
He'd made two rounds and was on his third, at the point furthest away from Steve, when the cars arrived. Three of them, black Jaguars, that parked close to the edge of the water. Tony stopped in the headlights, raising his hands in fists, as people started filing out of the cars.
"Yeah, I can see how you might," Steve says, and offers his hand to Rhodey, any trace of animosity gone.
There were still no drones in sight, neither on the streets nor in the air. Were they somehow banned from the lowest floors? Was that why Tony had been so fixated on keeping him above the 50th? Whatever the explanation, he wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth. This meant that he still had a chance of staying free.
Steve couldn't blame them. Life had always been hard down here, and by the looks of it, things hadn't gotten any better in the time that had passed. More like the opposite. Unfortunately, he didn't think they'd listen to him if he tried telling them that he understood.
Although the can of tomato soup someone has left on a shelf is awfully inviting, Steve steps outside again. The rain has stopped for now, but the sky still has a thick cloud cover, promising more showers soon. The lake next to the hut is beautiful in a melancholic way, with the grays and browns and greens of the bare hills blurred like an aquarelle painting by the lingering mist. The earthy scent of soil after rain fills the air.
"Tony! So, so nice to see you again, and in one piece, too," Hammer said, shaking Tony's hand and patting him on the bicep.
Following his best guess for where the voice came from, Steve heads to the wilderness again, his concern driving him to run as fast as he can. He thinks he would've been able to spot Tony if he were anywhere within line of sight from the hut, so he makes his way to a vantage point halfway up a hill where he can see the next valley.
Out of curiosity, he asked Ultron about Tony for a change; about the difficult times that Natasha had mentioned and the losses he'd suffered. As unpleasant as Ultron was, he still obeyed direct requests like this, and provided Steve with the relevant media coverage to browse through.
The drone that had been restraining Steve stepped back, releasing its hold. Steve slid out of the chair right away, but didn't move beyond that, waiting to see how the situation developed.
"That's not a fact, it's a hypothesis, and one we can't prove," Tony countered. "Besides, we still don't know what happened at Jan's party."
He couldn't quite make himself say aloud that he was in love with Steve; that would be too much, too soon. He didn't think he even knew Steve well enough to claim that. He loved some idea of Steve. He'd had a desperate crush on Steve since the day they'd met. He wanted to learn more about Steve, wanted to get closer to him, closer than he'd ever been with anyone, because thanks to the match, it would be unlike anything else he'd ever experienced.
Hoisting Tony over his shoulder would feel disrespectful. Instead, Steve picks him up gently in his arms, and starts his walk back. The despondent thoughts that he can't escape make the distance seem endlessly long.
"Right, that makes sense," Steve said with a nod. He then got up from the couch. Time to move on; he had several other places to visit today. "Thank you very much for contacting me, Miss Potts. If you can think of anything else, don't hesitate to call me again."
"So, what kind of power output are we talking about here?" he asks right away, because he knows enough to put two and two together.
"Are all dinosaurs really as evil as everyone says?" he asked the others thoughtfully over their meal. Most of the group around him were locals, born in the north of the island: Mona and a few other young people Bucky had been sparring with regularly.
An unsafe virtual reality link could definitely be one way to insert any number of things into a target's mind. Steve wasn't fit to judge if it was a more likely explanation than suicide. He simply didn't know Tony well enough anymore. Was there a chance that this callous facade was just that, a facade, and that deep down, Tony was troubled and vulnerable, depressed, even? Maybe Steve had jumped to the wrong conclusions about him. Not that he wanted Tony to be unhappy, but he'd almost prefer that explanation to the more likely one, which was that Tony had just turned out to be an unpleasant person.
Tony seemed to appreciate it, too, glancing up at him from the floor and licking his lips. "Would it be bad if I said I really like this body?" he asked, placing a tentative hand on Steve's calf.
The police officer knew who Steve was. He'd been expecting drones and not the local law enforcement, but this wasn't much better. He had no intention of going anywhere with this man.
That was the problem, wasn't it? He didn't like the idea at all. He didn't want his love life to be determined by some genetic anomaly. He'd hated the concept when he'd thought it was nonsense, and he hated it even more now that there were reasons to believe it might be science instead.
The days following the confrontation at Stark Tower seemed longer than any Steve'd had since waking up in the future. Possibly the longest in his life. Sure, several of the previous days had been so action-packed that they'd felt like they'd lasted much longer than twenty four hours, but compared to this endless, anxious, uneventful wait, they'd passed in a rush.
Chloe, might not be the same one—walks in, holding a tray with two steaming cups. "Your usual, and a black coffee for Mr. Stark," she says politely, and sets the tray on the table between them.
"I think I've done enough damage for now," Tony went on. "Better go and lie low for a bit. Maybe I should get a secret hideout like Barton's. Just minus the kids and the matched spouse."
"If you must know, the problem is that I've actually met my match, and I wish I hadn't," Tony said. It came out as off-hand and distracted instead of the dramatic revelation it could've been, because he had the nagging, tip-of-the-tongue feeling of an idea that was starting to take shape.
"We found it, Al and me, before Tony's group got there," she went on. "We wanted to know if it was the real thing, so we had someone drink from it. One of yours," she glanced at the Kingpin. "His name was Mallen."
Maya didn't even say anything, just nodded, looking dazed. She crawled to the edge of the pier and over it. Steve attached the shield on his back and jumped after her, just as another, even bigger explosion shook the ground. With a deep rumbling sound, the wall of the warehouse behind Tony started to collapse.
After Rhodey's attempts to find non-saurian steeds had proven fruitless, the rescuers had settled on hiking. They had also stood by their original decision to keep the party human-only. Some dinosaurs had volunteered to join them, such as the Horn-heads, the two triceratopses who were Natasha and Pepper's companions on the road. Although the ceratopsians could've helped them carry more supplies, they would've also slowed down the group. Due to that and the dangers faced by any dinosaur in the North, the group had deemed that it was better for them to stay behind.
"There's one more thing." Tony blinked his eyes open to glance at Steve. "The Accords, Siberia, all that."
Toweling himself off, he was still trying to decide if he could live with himself after asking Tony to stay because of ulterior motives when Tony solved that issue on his behalf.
Tony takes down the bad guys and rescues the civilians, and afterwards, he does actually feel better about everything; like maybe he could live with himself if he did this on a regular basis. It makes him feel in control. He can make a difference, and change things for the better. Even if it's too little and too late, at least it's something. He's trying.
They had to wait for a few minutes for Pepper to join them; she apologized profusely for it, but Tony waved it off magnanimously. "Never mind. We might as well be fashionably late. Justin can deal with it."
"Reporting for duty, sir," Ultron's voice rang in the air, and each of the drones raised their cannon-arms in a salute, perfectly synchronized.
"You won't remember me, but I was working for SHIELD at the time. Just a junior file-shuffler, the kind of person no one pays attention to," Fury went on. Somehow, even though he was currently sitting in an office, Steve had a hard time picturing this man as a file-shuffler, but then, it had been a long time ago. "Most of the things that took place then didn't touch me at all, but I heard enough to piece together that it wasn't right, and that I didn't like it. So, I stuck around and tried to figure out what was going on. Later, when I realized I knew too much and I was going to get into trouble for it, I left."
Tony was sitting at a table in the far corner, still wearing his coveralls and flat cap. There were two glasses in front of him, one of them empty, the other with amber liquid—whiskey of some sort, probably—still left at the bottom. He clearly wasn't too drunk to stop paying attention to the room around him, since his eyes met Steve's right away, his eyebrows going up and his lips turning to one of those radiant smiles.
Tony sighed, crossed his arms, looked at the ground, and then at Steve again. "You'll really just leave me be, if I do? You won't bring in the police and the Invaders and the National Guard and try to put me behind bars for the rest of my life?"
"The company owns plenty of buildings, and normally, I'd think he'd just hide in one of the labs, but I don't think he's doing that now. Not when he doesn't want to involve anyone else," Pepper said thoughtfully. "He might just be staying in a hotel, somewhere convenient."
The way things had gone down between them, something very, very bad must've happened for Tony to contact him. All that he'd heard of Tony during the weeks he'd spent hiding in Wakanda had been from occasional news items and the few reports Natasha had sent from home.
Tony raised his hand to feel around his skull, making his already tangled hair stick up even worse, then shrugged. "I don't know. I don't think so. No headache, and I don't have any bruises, either."
Tony retreats to the workshop. At least this unwanted day off means that he's got plenty of time for repairing his armor.
The call instantly brought back Steve's earlier worries. If Pepper was concerned as well, it seemed more likely that his fears hadn't been misplaced. He chastised himself for not going after Tony at the bar right away, so that he might've at least gotten the registration of that car.
The expression on Stark's face shifted to what looked like a different kind of anguish. "Someone very dear to me," he replied, his voice sounding slightly better, hoarse as it still was.
So, the 'shop is the sanctuary where Tony retreats in the afternoon, because he needs to catch his breath and bring down his blood pressure before he gives himself an aneurysm. Unfortunately, he doesn't actually have time to properly settle down before JARVIS alerts him back upstairs.
"Did I say I was?" Tony complained, although he knew he might as well have. The conversation was starting to get beyond what he could handle. He stood up, feeling shaky and nauseous. There was a deep ache beneath the arc reactor that he knew no painkillers would touch, because there wasn't really anything wrong with him, even though everything was wrong. "God, I need a drink. Or ten."
Sleep took much longer to come than it should've, his mind stuck between regretful feelings about Tony and unease about tomorrow.
As for family—he didn't think he'd be any good with kids. His dad had been terrible, and he doubted he'd do any better. Still, he would've liked to have a family. A group of people around him that looked after one another. He'd thought the Avengers could be one. For a brief, happy period of time, they almost had been. Almost, but not quite, mostly because he'd always kept that distance between him and Steve. And now he was about to drive away from it.
Most of the team would've still be in prison if Steve hadn't broken them out. Now they were on the run, who knew where, and they all hated Tony's guts.
Maybe he should let Tony go and talk to Maya, but be there as well, to observe what happened, and step in if necessary. Now that he thought about it, that seemed like the best course of action. He'd need to go home to change into his costume, but he could get to the Lower East Side and from there to Red Hook in less than an hour.
Restless, Steve steps outside and walks around the hut, scanning the hills for any signs of movement. There are none, not even birds or reindeer, and the only sound other than rain on roof tiles is the howling wind.
Still held in Rumlow's grasp, Stark made a guttural noise that didn't resemble the dinosaur's roar very much, but neither was it like any human language Bucky had ever heard. It definitely wasn't the common language of the island he'd been taught, which was the first language of most people in the Resistance, and which Stark and the rest of the caravan had also understood.
He realized that he couldn't hide the truth anymore. This was the moment he'd been dreading, and he knew it would not go down well, but he had to do it, anyway.
As it happens, he does know better. Not like Tony would've passed up the chance to get it on with a guy who looks nice and is on the single-digits list of people on the planet who are as smart as he is. Definitely not back when he was still busy getting it on with anyone who was even vaguely interesting.
Steve swallowed, his throat feeling tight all of a sudden. It was both out of sympathy and disbelief that Tony would berate himself like that, and because Tony had no idea what he was talking about. Just like everyone else, he'd put Captain America on a pedestal. Especially coming from him, it was completely undeserved, after what Steve had done.
Sam has looked already, and it's not good; it's like Steve's mind has shut down, leaving nothing but the minimal required brain activity to keep his body alive.
"I am Tapio," the man introduces himself, and clambers out of his tent to offer Steve his hand. He's as tall as Steve and dressed in garb well-suited for the weather: rubber boots and an oilskin coat. "Honor to meet you. Big surprise, too."
Steve seemed to be consciously letting go of the anger and anxiety; Tony could feel it in the slow deep breaths Steve was taking, that Tony was subconsciously mirroring, although Tony's had a slight unhealthy rattle that Steve's didn't.
"Yeah. It's the first time we'll meet in person since that whole fiasco, too. Bring popcorn, I'm sure it'll be a proper show," Tony said.
The man held out his free hand, projecting a badge in the air above it. "Clint Barton, NYPD," he announced. "I don't care about your bar brawl. I'll forget I saw anything if you let Mr. Rogers here come with me."
Even though Steve probably does deserve some gratitude, Tony can't help lashing out at him. "Well, thank you. Thank you so much for meddling in my affairs and completely screwing them up."
"Did you tell all this to the police, too?" Bucky asked, looking awed, when Steve had finished his summary.
Steve could tell Tony wasn't really buying it, and the truth was, he probably wouldn't have bought it himself. Still, he decided to stick to the cover he'd picked, as unconvincing as it was. "Not at the moment, no. You've got one, I suppose? At some auto shop?"
"They did it because it served their purposes. It gained them another soldier for their misguided cause," Stark countered. Although he spoke softly, there was a determination in his tired voice that sounded so honest and somber, it was very difficult to believe it could be an act. "Can you name one person here who's ever even tried to have a proper conversation with a dinosaur? They're treated like animals, even though they're just as smart as us. Good people don't do that."
"Yeah, you're off by just a few decades," Tony said. "This is the body you knew me in. The only one I've had."
Steve had to admit that Tony was half right. The quinjet was partly buried in sand and almost entirely non-functional, including the communications array. With a quick glance towards the cockpit, he could see that Natasha and Clint had opened several panels, trying to work on the computers. Unfortunately, Steve knew their chances of repairing any of the damage within a reasonable timespan without Tony’s help were low.
He took off Tony's socks, too, so he could hold one foot between his hands. He kissed the top of it to give himself an excuse for a closer look. Tony's feet were warm, like the rest of him, and not at all sweaty. His sole was as soft as a baby's under Steve's fingers. Not what he would've expected from someone who'd recently returned from a month-long expedition into the jungle that must've included a fair amount of trekking over rugged terrain.
He'd never know how it felt to have a soulmate, and how all those descriptions he'd read held up to reality, not past the reluctant glimpses of shared feelings he'd experienced. He'd never know how it would've felt to hold Tony close and feel their bodies and minds fall into step with one another.
"I'm against killing people in general, but in this case, I'm going to make an exception," Steve said grimly.
Tony proved those doubts wrong right away. He gave Steve a sultry look. "I thought you might want to do it."
"I believe we can trust them, Tony." Steve reached over the table to place his hand on top of Tony's. "And I hope you can trust me."
The room wasn't filled with treasure, although what he saw was as pretty as any jewelry: metal carved into intricate shapes that gleamed in tones of gold, silver and copper. Clearly, these were parts of machines, but they were unlike any technology Bucky had seen. The thing that resembled them the most was the construction of his metal arm, which he suspected must be inspired by these creations. None of the contraptions looked complete, but a few had enough parts left to see the general size and shape of them, which resembled dinosaurs of some kind. The countless smaller pieces also looked like parts of living beings, like fins or vertebrae, except that everything was made of metal.
"Ha ha, very funny." Steve was well aware from observing his scrawny birth frame through many different pairs of eyes, that it didn't fit any definition of good-looking. "I come here because it keeps me grounded, okay? I spend more time in borrowed frames than in my own, these days. I don't want to forget who I really am."
"I could use that, but that's for later. There's a reason why I wanted to have this chat right now," she said. "I wanted to warn you, Steve. Your assignment tomorrow? There's something not quite right about it. It came up on a short notice, and it doesn't make sense to me. You remember that illegal cloning facility you're supposed to take down, don't you?"
Seren lifted her head to address Steve directly. "Your mate is a good man. I know many don't see him that way. I'm going to tell them they're wrong."
"Yeah, that was pretty stupid, now that you mention it." Out of habit, Tony tried to hold a casual, cool front, even though he knew Steve would see right through it.
The big mobster's fingers tightened around Tony's shoulder, his hold bordering on painful. The two others shifted to more threatening stances, Knuckles raising his fists, and Holster pulling out his pistol.
Steve tried tugging back, and got a set of insistent pulls in return from Tony's end. It almost felt as if there was a pattern. It took him several long seconds to recognize what it was, and that Tony wasn't just yanking at the thread at random. There were longer and shorter tugs: a code. Morse code, which Steve had memorized during the war.
"Okay, yeah, that's probably true," Tony said, with a deep, steadying sigh. "Maybe we should get on with it, then."
He ignored the voice at the back of his mind reminding him that psychological trauma would carry over and wouldn't magically vanish in frame space.
Pressing himself close to the wall, Steve observed the surroundings carefully to see if there were any other guards around, but the walkway seemed perfectly quiet. He started following the walkway towards Natasha's direction. When he heard the sound of footsteps, he froze in place, holding his breath. The footfalls were very soft and cautious, so much so that anyone with regular hearing might not have picked them up at all. He risked a quick glance at the approaching person, and to his relief, found it to be Natasha.
Happy raises his eyebrows at Tony, and Tony shrugs. "Sorry, that's just the way it is. Chain of command and all that. I am the boss, after all."
He didn't want to think about the reasons for his lack of sleep. Bucky knew about his affair with Tony, of course, and he was hoping they could have a chat about it later, maybe help Steve figure out what he really wanted. Just not now.
He coughed and gasped for breath. Too loud—they needed to stay quiet while Bucky dealt with the guard—but he couldn't help it, because he'd failed to stay above the surface, and he was drowning.
Steve patted Bucky on the back, a fond look in his eyes. "I don't think he needed to learn that from anyone."
Steve fought like he hadn't since he'd left behind the war. Luckily, these weren't skills that he would easily forget, and his strength and agility gave him an advantage over everyone. He, Sam, and Natasha did their best to hold back the enemies, giving Pepper and Rhodey room to keep working.
It hadn't occurred to Steve that Tony might not have been aware of Captain America's presence at the final fire, but that was what it sounded like. It did make sense, considering that Steve had only joined the fray after Tony had already been pushed into the sea; Tony hadn't really been himself after that.
The solution to the situation came from Fury, who had an alternative offer: Steve could keep working for SHIELD, and they'd arrange a proper apartment for him, instead of the quarters he'd had so far. The only catch was that he'd be stationed in Washington D.C.
"Come on, it's just a thought experiment," Howard said, when Steve still hadn't answered his question. "Imagine there was a way to know for sure whether you've got a soulmate, and who that is, if you do have one. You'd be curious, wouldn't you?"
While he's considering his immediate future, Steve's eyes land on a flock of grouse-like birds sitting on the slope ahead of him. He'd been thinking of fishing for breakfast, but this could be a much faster solution.
"Shit, Steve, you—that was too close. All of that," Tony said, his voice stifled with emotion. "That was too much. He could've killed you."
"You really care for him so much you'd bargain your freedom to buy him a little more time?" Stane spoke up, standing right behind Steve now. "He'd be lucky to last longer than a few days, weeks at best, even if I were to take your deal."
Overall, he hadn't felt like he usually did when he was around Tony. The more he focused on it, the more conspicuous it was that he'd only felt regret that he was saying no to Tony's offer and sadness about missing out on spending more time with his fellow Avengers. That inexplicable, anxious urge to get out of the situation hadn't been there at all.
Steve was sitting down on the old couch, looking straight ahead but not really seeing anything. Tony sat beside him, in a very uncharacteristic silence, waiting. The sound of his feet constantly hitting the floor was starting to irritate Steve. After a few seconds, he grabbed Tony’s knee, still looking straight ahead.
Because, see, Tony did not have many happy memories of his childhood. Even the good ones were often tainted by his father’s awful behavior. He hadn’t been a happy child, he was very much aware of that. He could not remember a single occasion where Howard had complimented him. He could, however, recount every single time his father had screamed drunken threats at him in the middle of the night as the little boy hid under his covers, tears streaming down his face, terror clear in his eyes. He could not remember a birthday in which his father had been present and, even if he was there in the mansion for the celebrations, he’d always spend the entire day in his office, talking on the phone about things that were much more important than the birthday of his only son. He remembered every cutting word, every insult that had been burned on his skin, never to be forgotten. So it was easy, at times like these, when he was feeling lost and scared and sad, to drown in these awful memories, to feel the rejection that still screamed inside his chest, the inadequacy, the shame. So, every time that happened, every time these feelings became too much, every time his brain became too loud to bear, Tony would do the only good thing he knew to deal with his pain: he’d eat.
“Look, I know I’m probably not what your friends are used to, but I can play the part with the rich kids. Trust me”, Tony said in a mocking tone, although Steve was sure he could hear some apprehension on his voice.
“What do you mean? There was an investigation, there were CCTV footage reviewed. Obie made sure…”, but then his voice faltered as he stared at the pity looks everyone was sending his way, “Obie… You think Obie had my parents killed?”
It had been a Wednesday and a very busy day when the call came. She had been so focused on her conversation with Agent Fury that she’d almost missed the call. She quickly answered the phone, apologizing to the young agent for the interruption while assuring him it was too important a call to miss, and almost passed out with worry when she heard her darling boy sobbing on the other end of the like.
“So… Not exactly how I planned on telling you my feelings for…” Steve could not finish, however, because Tony had grabbed him by the collar and pulled him down, smashing their mouths together in a kiss. Steve quickly held his waist, pulling him even closer as he deepened the kiss, feeling Tony’s hand slide from his neck to his hair.
Steve retrieved a little black box from the inside of his jacket and put it on the table in front of Tony, smiling.
“We use codenames only in missions like this, Lieutenant”, Steve cut him off midsentence, “These are Black Widow, Hawkeye, Winter Soldier and I’m Captain America”.
“Calm down, Man of Iron. Your Midgardian doctors will help the good Captain now. But you must calm yourself”, he heard Thor’s voice in his ear.
With a nod, Hill left the office, closing the door behind her. Steve, then, took his phone from his pocket and quickly sent a text to his mechanic.
“We need to know everything that’s happened since the target was taken, spare no details”, Steve informed him.
Tony closed his eyes, feeling exhausted. Without him even realizing, his mind started to wonder… He pictured a big house, in the middle of nowhere, with a big lake and a tree and a swing… and kids; running around, laughing and playing. Ty chasing after them, his own laughter echoing in Tony’s ears as he caught them and they all fell on the grass. He could see them from the porch, a boy and a girl, cheeks red from all the running. He smiled. It was a nice picture. It felt right somehow. A family, something he’d never had. A family just for him. And he would be a good dad. Goddamn it he would be a wonderful dad. He would go to every recital, every science fair, every soccer game. He would help them with their homework and teach them math and love them like every child deserved to be loved. He’d break the cycle of shame that Howard Stark had started. He was going to be a good father.
“First of all, we’re not accusing you, we’re informing you, you dumb dork; and second of all, we love you, man, but you are really dumb when it comes to relationships and stuff”.
“No, no”, the mechanic immediately said, trying to reassure Steve with a smile, “I’m sorry, I was just surprised. Come on, let’s eat”.
Hope you guys enjoyed it. We're almost done. Two more chapters to go, I think. Again, sorry for the delay in posting this and leave me comments and kudos cause I love those! lol
“I agree. The Ten Rings were too well informed. I believe someone very powerful paid them to eliminate my godson. I have my suspicions, but I can’t be certain”, she said with a thoughtful expression, glancing to the room where Anthony and Rhodes were, “Did Anthony see your faces?”
“Tell me, my dear. Who are you working for? Is it Lermentov, per chance?”, the little man asked, nodding at the man on her left. The man in question took hold of Natasha’s chair, dipping it backwards, towards the big hole behind her. “Does he think we need his permission to move
“So, let me get this straight… You all decided to go against the only thing I asked you to do and threw a party with the sole purpose of trying to make Steve, who doesn’t even remember me, jealous?”
“We’d also have to wait for him to open all those documents right in front of the camera. It’s just not practical”, Tony completed, “Not to mention… Obie is a lot of things, but stupid isn’t one of them. He most likely has different kill switches to make sure everything disappears if the authorities are alerted”.
“All I’m saying is that SHIELD trains the best people, Captain. You’re not just training security agents, you’re training spies”, Stane said in a soft tone, “Yes, I know about your friend, Miss Romanov, is it? She was KGB, was she not? And now she trains your people”.
“Own, you think I’m hot?” Cassie asked, mockingly batting her eyes at Harvey, who blushed like crazy and was ready to retort before being interrupted by Peter.
He was about to pull the trigger when suddenly the lights became unbearably bright, blinding him. He hide his eyes with the same arm that was holding the gun for a quick second before extending it again and shooting. But Tony did not wait. Finally able to move, although not with as much agility as he usually had, he rolled out of the way just as the bullet hit the desk that had seconds before been serving as a backrest. He thanked JARVIS in his head and considered his options quickly: Whoever the man was, he was between Tony and the elevator; there was another one, however, on the other side of that floor. Determined, Tony got up and made a straight line for the long corridor filled with offices. He heard the man shouts and another shot fired, thinking
Bucky shook his head, laughing. “Yes, punk, no limo. And don’t shower this guy with gifts either. You remember what happened the last time, right? With…”
“Would you like to come inside?” Tony asked with a hoarse voice, his eyes full of desire as he looked at Steve.
“I’ll stay forever if you want me to”, he replied, unable to stop himself from putting his arm in his shoulders and pulling him closer, leaving a soft kiss in his forehead.
He only realized he was already at the gift shop when a very happy looking young woman called his attention.
“Gentlemen! I’m glad you came, I know how busy you must be planning that wedding, huh? Please, sit down”.
Tony threw away the note and gave the plushie to DUM-E, who happily took it to his charging station and kept it there.
“So… Any chance Harley is the beast we have to slay?” Cassie asked while Harley threw her dirty looks.
He looked around, trying to see through the heavy rain. He couldn’t call his driver to come pick him up, so maybe he could find a payphone he could use or hopefully some store that was still open. He squinted his eyes, trying to read a sign that he was pretty sure said ‘mechanic’ not too far away from where he was. Resigned, Steve looked down at his expensive Armani suit and sighed, getting out of the car.
“They throwing a benefit with my name on it and no one had the fucking decency to send me an invitation. The reporter was saying the reason I wasn’t expected to show up is because I have PTSD, Steve”.
“You have a bit of sauce here, hold on”, Tony said with a laugh, using his thumb to clean the corner of Steve’s mouth and then, without breaking eye contact, put said thumb in his mouth, sucking it lightly. Steve just stared at him, openmouthed, his eyes slightly widened. He cleared his throat a couple of times and blushed furiously with a shy smile.
She turned the helicopter around and smiled. Sure enough, there he was, with a shirt wrapped around his head, swinging his arms. The man fell to the ground just as Rhodey jumped out of the chopper, running towards him as fast as he could, Steve and Bucky right behind him. Rhodey fell on his knees right in front of his best friend, the biggest smile on his face.
