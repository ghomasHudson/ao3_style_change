Steve almost choked on the bread and felt himself going red, the hot flush starting on his cheeks and spreading down to his neck and chest as Tony cackled. "I'm not even sure it's safe for me to sit next to you on this wagon," Steve managed after a moment, climbing in next to Tony. "If God smites you I don't want to be collateral damage."
“Come in,” Tony called out as someone knocked on the door to his office. He checked the mark on the candle, then frowned when he realized that it was far too late in the day for whoever was knocking to be here for an appointment, but it must be someone Tony knows for Brother Peter to let him through without asking first. “How can I…” The words died in his throat when Sir Rogers came in, his hair a burnished gold against his snowy white surcoat, chainmail gleaming in the candlelight. Once he was inside the office, whatever courage had driven him here seemed to falter, because he stopped just inside the door as if he were contemplating leaving. “Sir Rogers,” Tony greeted with wary curiosity, tilting his head to once side as he studied the knight. He put his quill into the inkpot and sprinkled sand over his letter before setting it to the side, leaning back in his chair and steepling his hands in front of him thoughtfully. “How can I help you?”
“I’m sure now that Tony is feeling better, Steve will make sure he’s on his knees praying for something all night,” James said, and Tony could feel Natasha’s shoulders shaking with laughter as Steve turned bright red but didn’t deny it.
Steve suppressed a sigh and took another sip of wine, already regretting his decision to come. More intrigues and political maneuvering; it was enough to make him wish to be back in the Holy Land.
“Yes, Your Grace.” It was so hard not to turn his face towards Stark; every part of him seemed to be reaching for him like a lodestone. He ached for his taste and the feel of him under his hands, to pull off those crimson robes and find the body beneath. His hardness was a throbbing pulse in his groin, the mortification of his confession mingling with the sharp stinging of his back to create an unbearable pain of fever pitch arousal.
Tony had asked him once, and at the time Steve hadn't known the answer. Bucky clearly hadn't had the same problem, and his conviction made the answer seem so clear. Like Alexander cutting through the Gordian Knot, Steve felt like the tangled knot of conflicting emotions that had been living in his chest had been cut right in two, leaving something clean and pure in its wake.
“You think I should go with him? For the love of God, why?” Tony pressed his fingers to his temples.  His conversation with Rodgers had left him with a headache and a heavy heart, but his sympathy for Rodger’s pain wouldn’t last long if he started in with his moralizing when Tony wasn’t in the mood.
“Fuck you, Stane,” Tony said, curling his lip. “You can cut the shit. I’ve got what you want. Bring him in,” he called out, and on cue his men dragged Steve in, filthy and covered in blood. As he hung limply in the arms of the soldiers, Tony fisted a hand in Steve’s hair and dragged his head up so Stane could see his face. “This is the one you were looking for, Sir Steve Rodgers. We left his face mostly untouched so you could see it was the right man. You were right, after all,” Tony said, letting Steve’s head fall back down. At a gesture from Tony, the soldiers dropped him and left him lying limp on the floor. “He trusted me enough to come running when I said I knew where his friend was.”
“So I gather,” Stark said dryly.  He sat back in his chair, still wearing his richly embroidered dressing robe instead of his raiment and ran his fingers over the vane of the feather quill in his hand.  “You may go, Brother Peter.”  As the young cleric bowed and left, giving Steve a glare on his way out the door, Stark called out, “It’s probably time for you to leave as well, Jean-Paul.”
Steve waited for the current song to be over before he asked for a new one; the singer bowed as the front of the audience cheered at the request, and immediately starting picking out a tune that was fast and energetic and had the crowd clapping along. As he turned to head back to the table, his heart leapt when he saw a stranger sitting in his seat. He made his way back through the crowd as fast as he dared, hoping that the man had word of Bucky.
"There's no need for you to be sorry, I was never asleep to begin with. I gotta be honest with you, cupcake. You are the most caring, generous, amicable, attentive, kind and gentle man I've ever met. How can someone like you even exist? I'm so fucking touched. You are so God damn special because you're very unique and one of a kind.
Howard cried Tony's name out loud, while running toward him. He was shaking in fear when he saw Tony's body covered in blood.
Steve nodded. He gently put the anti medicine. He didn't the pain, his mind was list somewhere else.
"Thank you for informing me, J.A.R.V.I.S" Steve thanked the A.I with a smile and walked inside the elevator. He really liked J.A.R.V.I.S, after all Tony was the A.I's creator. From day one, Tony has programmed J.A.R.V.I.S to help Steve in any way that he can to make everything easier. Especially, with technologies 'cause Steve literally sucked at that. Steve had always felt so welcomed by Tony since day one. He absolutely loved that feeling.
"Do you hate me that much? Did you actually think that you avoiding me will, make this break up work? I told you before, you can't end things between us, Tony." Steve reminded him.
He put a small amount of the gel on his hand and rubbed it on Tony's ass, slowly inserting his middle finger inside Tony.
"I don't have one." Steve bluntly replied. Well, it was the truth, he was never interested in having a girlfriend to begin with, he was far too busy for that.
On the way to his chamber, Steve gave a small tutorial around the castle. Tony was rather amazed, he asked countless of questions regarding the castle and the royal family.
Steve clenched his fist. He was frustrated. But, not at Tony, never. He was angry with himself for losing control and hurting Tony.
Bucky was dumbfounded by Tony, as his eyes grew bigger. How was this even possible? How did Tony know everything? How did Tony know him inside out, even though they've just met yesterday?
Tony gently rubbed her back with his hand, trying his best to calm her down. "It's okay, Pepper. I'm right here" He whispered. Tony was at the edge of completely breaking down, he fought the urge of not to end up crying in front Pepper. He wanted Pepper to be happy, he can't let his emotions be in the way, never. He can't be a burden to her, not again or ever.
The red eyes always reminded Steve how inhumane he truly was. As a child his iris changed colour frequently, it scared the crap out of everyone, except his family.
A single tear ran down his cheek. The pain in his heart was unbearable, Steve clutched his shirt tight. His mind was going blank, his vision became blurry.
Steve knew he has good looks. If he wanted to he could've got a girlfriend with the snap of his fingers. But, he didn't. He wasn't a playboy and never intends to be.
Bucky put both of his on his face, covering his mouth. Oh Dear Lord! He was actually in love with Natasha all this time. How was he so blind not to notice that? Bucky was dying of embarrassment.
Steve was desperate for someone to say that to him. "Bucky, thank you, that means a lot." He whispered, his tears streamed down his cheeks.
Steve didn't want to disturb him, the guy looked very serene. He decided to let the man rest. He gently put his arms underneath his legs, whilst the other hand behind the man's back and carefully lifting him off the couch into his arms.
Steve wrapped his arms around the man's waist and pulled himself up. He sat on the cold wet ground with the man sitting on
Steve saw the terror on Tony's face, he stepped back and suddenly there was nothing, he was standing in air. In a blink of an eye, his body dropped down.
Steve stood there. Tony had said the same thing, when they'd first met. Both of them were staring into each other's eyes, without blinking. Like they were in their own little world.
He was scared, as his lifeless body had fallen into the deep ocean with a big splash. The cold water devoured him completely, leaving his body frozen to the core.
Steve literally didn't have a clue on what possessed him to potray such act. It was as if his body was moving on it's on, like an invincible force pulling him in.
He looked at Tony in his arms, he looked so peaceful in his sleep. Steve wished he could get rid of Tony's sadness and make him smile.
Steve noticed how Tony was a little tensed. "Are you sure you're ready?" Steve asked, just to be extra sure.
He hated living here by himself, especially without J.A.R.V.I.S. God knows where he even dropped his phone. Everything from yesterday night was blurry as fuck.
"W-what, I wasn't implying you, Stevie. Calm you're ass down." Bucky said, he had a huge grin on his face.
This time he heard the voice clearly. "- why can't you just tell Bucky that your madly in love with him, Nat?" Tony asked with a light sigh.
Steve's tears dripped down his cheeks. "B-Bucky, I lost him before I could've even had him. I love him so much, I lost him Bucky. Know his alive but the news. I don't know what to do, It feels like someone had ripped my heart open, it hurts so much." Steve whimpered between the sobs.
"Why do I care so much about you, Tony Stark? Why?" Steve muttered underneath his breath. If only he knew the answers.
Steve weakly smiled at Bucky, not knowing how to respond him at all. But, Bucky already knew the answer to that. He's known Steve when both of them were in diapers, obviously he knows Steve from inside out. "Oh wait, don't tell me you didn't realize
He snapped out of his thoughts and threw a pillow at Bucky, which fell right on his face. "I know my sexuality very well, thank you very much." Steve replied with a fake smile, as he glared at Bucky suspiciously.
"Anyway I should get going. My friends are probably looking for me, Thank you so Mr Stark, I really appreciate you helping me" Steve said.
Joseph was afraid this was going to happen, but Tony was not to be blamed for. "What! Why? After all you guys been through? What did Anthony say?" Joseph asked, he needed understand the situation first, then maybe he could comfort his little boy.
Tony looked a little flustered, Steve couldn't help but think how cute Tony looked. His heart was pounding nonstop. Who would've thought, the crown prince shared his first kiss with a boy and that too with Tony Stark.
Instead, Steve decided to go out and freshen his mind. He wanted lighten his mood up, so he can then apologize to Tony with a cool headed mind, that way he won't lose control in front Tony again.
Steve rushed getting up, but he was to clumsy and fallen back down, thankfully he placed down his hand first. Steve was on top of Tony, their faces were only an inches apart. Both of them stared into each others eyes without saying a word.
Both of them couldn't stop laughing, they laughed until their stomach hurt. Since that day, they're friendship grew stronger.
"I'm so glad to hear that, I know a really great night Café just 5 ride minutes away from here." Steve knew he was smiling, he felt so relieved.
Steve quickly stood up. “I thought you said we were soulmates when we had first met? And soulmates are meant to be together in every alternative universe. So why are you leaving me, Tony?" Steve growled in frustration, he was too blind by the anger to notice that he was shouting at Tony.
Tony rolled his eyes, these two were literally giving him a fucked up headache. Why couldn't they just forget about Steve, already.
"Well, it's part of my charm. Now that Steve and I are friends, I can easily make him laugh anytime."
Tony burst into laughter. He patted Steve's shoulder. "Oh, Steve you have a great sense of humour. I love it." Tony some how managed to speak without laughing.
Tony gave him a confused look. "Urm, Steve. What do you think you're doing?" He asked, while getting inside.
Bucky snapped out of his thoughts when someone had bumped into him. He smelt a faint scent of something sweet; it was aromatic.
Steve's mind went blank, he didn't know how to respond to that at all. He felt his heart beating in a abnormal rhythm, all he could hear was his heart drumming in his ears.
Steve yanked Bucky, smashing their lips against each other. No matter, what Steve had to steal back Tony's kiss from Bucky. Tony's lips only belonged to Steve. His heart pounded at the thought of Tony being his. Tony belonged Steve. No one, literally no one can steal him away from. His mine!
Steve stared right into Tony's hazel eyes. Somehow, all the nervousness seemed to have disappeared. His body was moving on it's own, he was actually dancing.
"-I'm Antonio and yes I'm half Italian." Tony cringed at his choice of words. Talk about awkwardness, he literally just blurted out everything he was thinking. Especially in front of a really hot guy.
Steve let out a loud laughter, he couldn't stop laughing. He knew Tony was trying make him feel better and it worked. "You what! You blew up a science lab!"
Rhodey froze there, he hadn't seen Tony cry like that in a very long time. Rhodey gently patted Tony’s back, trying to calm him. He held him in his arms for a few minutes.
Bucky pulled him into a hug. "Thank you for saving my life, Tony. I won't ever forget what you did for me." Bucky said, he moved his body from the hug.
Tony faked smiled and stood up,"sorry no can do. This meeting is boring as fuck. I couldn't care less about my safety. All I need is to find that motherfucker. So are guys willing to help me or not?" He pressed both of his hands on the table and leaned forward.
"Thank God! Your okay Tony, you nearly gave me a heart attack" Rhodey sighed in relief. He hugged Tony tightly, "I won't forgive you, if you die Tony." Rhodey warned in a dangerous tone of voice.
The man looked down for a moment, pouring himself a drink and bringing the alcohol to his soft lips.
His eyes began to close, he had tried keeping them open but his eyelids were too heavy. He was almost out of oxygen. Just when Bucky was about to give up, he heard a splash. Someone must've jumped into the water, he could hear the faint sound of people screaming.
Steve hadn't failed to notice that the man was incredibly beautiful, when he first laid eyes on the man. He knew the man looked stunningly handsome, even in the rain the man looked so God damn sexy. Steve had to admit the man  was rather a dishy looking guy.
Steve tried to hide his smile, but he failed. He knew Bucky was going to tease him about Tony. Somehow, Steve didn't mind being teased about Tony, in fact he liked it. "Shut up, Bucky."
"Bucky, are you that oblivious about your own feelings for Nat?" Tony asked, lifting his right eyebrow up.
Tony gave him a warm smile. "Unless, you want to go out with me? I'm warning if you get bored and end up ditching me, I'll ruin you're life, Rogers. So, chop-chop make you're decisions, I'm waiting." Tony suggested.
He had lost Tony before, he can't lose him again. No, never! There is no way in hell, Steve would ever let of Tony again. Tony solely belonged to him, he was Steve's.
Steve didn't expect that at all, you can't blame him for losing focus. He completely lost his balance. He tripped over his feet fell on Tony. Both of them fell crashing down into the floor.
Steve ran his fingers through his hair and took a deep breath before starting to speak. "I didn't know it was him, until now. I know for sure that it was Tony Stark that saved me, it was definitely him."
Tony went near Bucky, he gently patted his cheeks. "Bucky! You're safe now.” Tony reassured him, his voice trembled, as it sounded so broken and weak.
His lips curved into a smile. Tony ran toward Nick and hugged him. "Oh Nickie, I always knew you cared about me. But hearing it from your mouth makes it more meaningful."
"Aren't you afraid, that if anything were to happen to me, you'd get into trouble." There sadness to his tone.
Bucky tilted his head toward the side, he saw Natasha and Tony. The next he knew, Natasha had cupped his face and crashed her lips against his. Her lips were extremely soft. After a few seconds, Natasha parted her lips away. She hugged Bucky, tightly. He could feel her body trembling against him.
"Today, Nickie tried hiring a personal bodyguard for me. Can you believe it? Even though, Pepper tripled the amount of security guards then before after that incident and having a personal bodyguard is too much for me.
"Honeybear!" Tony called out loud. He ran toward the man and jumped into his arms, gently embracing him. "I've missed you so much, Honeybear!"
Just before Steve could wrap his arms around the smaller man. A group of people came rushing down here, the splashing noise of them running around pissed Steve off. How dare they disturb his peaceful moment.
"But in our universe soulmates doesn't exist, what a shame. If it did then we'd be soulmates. That would be so awesome, I'd treasure and love you for eternity. I know more stories a about soulmates, but I'll tell you later, if you're interested."
Bucky suddenly chuckled. "Stark, I didn't expect you to make a ship name for us this quick, actually I didn't expect you to even care about something like that. But I really do love this side of you, Stark" Bucky stated with a smug.
The man unconsciously placed his hands on Steve's shoulder for support. He was startled by Steve. "Ah fuck!" He muttered underneath his breath.
The first thing that came into Steve's thought was that the boy was simply beautiful and that his name suited him perfectly.
He put more pressure in kicking his feet, paddling faster. He swam and swam. Just in a nick of time they'd reached to the surface of the water; he guessed luck was on their side.
Steve reached out his hands out to shake the boy's hand, but the moment their hands touched each other, they both received an electric shot. Tony immediately took his hand away, steve mirrored him.
As he was washing his face, he suddenly recalled something; a pair of beautiful blue eyes. But he wasn't sure whether it'd happened or it was just a dream?
"Steve, how are you feeling? Are you uncomfortable? Do you need something? You must be hungry, c'mon you need to eat to stay healthy." Steve's mum Sarah asked.
"Nooo! Fuck my life " Tony growled, covering his face with a cushion. Fuck! This is so embarrassing.
But, for now he had to keep his true feelings for Tony as secret. Steve didn't want to rush into anything, like he said before, Steve wanted to start off as friends with Tony, even if half of the times, he was tempted to kiss the life force out of Tony.
“look, Tony. There's a reason why things turned out like the way it did. Your relationship with Pepper didn't work out because you probably belong to someone else. There is someone out there who loves you unconditionally." Rhodey explained.
Tony didn't want Steve to see his chest, especially because he had an arc reactor inside the middle of his chest. It wasn't that Tony was insecure about his heart condition.
"You can rest assure dad, Stark men are made of iron. That's why I'm gonna aim for the top." Tony had a smug on his face, he was confident and brave. Tony was completely opposite of Steve.
Steve started moving his finger, in and out of Tony's warm tight hole, causing Tony to moan between the kisses. "Ah! Fuck, Steve!"
Steve gaped at the billboard screen. It was the first time, that something had caught his eyes; in which, where an Ad was played in the big screen of a man.
The warmth he had felt all night suddenly disappeared. Steve shot his eyes wide open, he was shivering. His body was so cold. Steve felt gutted when he didn't see the man sleeping beside him.
Rhodey immediately pulled him into a hug. "Stupid, why are you apologizing for? When I should be one saying it."
"That's absurd. I work for no one but myself." Steve scoffed, rolling his eyes in annoyance. He felt insulted being compared to those low ass mother fuckers.
Tony's arms were on the man's neck, whilst the man's hand were on Tony's waist. Tony and the man were making out in public.
Steve had woken in this world again, just to discover that he has Hypothermia; which meant his body temperature was seriously low then average. No matter how many times he tried, Steve couldn't keep his body warm at all. His body had always remained freezing cold, he felt inhumane.
Pepper was waiting for Tony in the reception, "Tony, is the kid okay?" She asked with a frown on her face.
Bucky felt so relieved, as he was in control of his body. Oh how he missed his sense of touch and moving his body freely. This was too good to be true, but the truth was this was real.
Steve was cut off by Bucky. "What I'm trying to say is, if you go now. There might be chance of you seeing him again. And this time, you might be able to thank him. "
He quickly took a shower and got out. He wrapped a medium size towel around his waist and a small towel around his neck. Steve removed the waterproof bandage off and walked inside his bedroom.
Today was the day, that Tony had to leave. His parents had already arrived to pick him up. Everyone was in the courtyard, whilst Steve was on the rooftop, watching them laugh, clearly they were having a great time.
Tony smirked and looked at Natasha. "Nat told me so much about you, that I could easily notice it's you. She told me how you look h-" Natasha cut him off,
These past two weeks were very hectic for Steve, as being the leader of The Aven Clan. Not to mention, the endless paper works, as well as missions. God, it was literally so tiring. But, Steve loved his position, he loved leadership because that was the only way he could look out for his fellow clan members and lead them.
A sudden clicked noise came from outside, causing Steve to snap from his thoughts back to the tight situation he was already in.
Tony had a warm smile on his face. "Pep, Honeybear. I really appreciate the effort. But, it not like I'll see Steve again." Tony let a low sigh.
He wanted to open his eyes and see the expression Tony had made, but no matter how hard he tried he couldn't open them at all.
Tony stood there not knowing what to do. His eyes never once left Steve. "S-Steve I-" Tony stuttered, he was loss of words. He didn't have a clue to how he was going to explain this to Steve.
"Are you for real? Wow! Okay, I didn't expect that at all, out of people, it had to Nat's man. But, I guess it just shows that I'm fucking awesome. I mean seriously, even Bucky admires me, WOAH! I'm such an amazing role model. Bucky, I must say, you have a great taste in liking things. I feel very honoured." Tony stated, with a huge smirk on his face. He was clearly showing off his talent.
"I guess this is goodbye, for now Tony. We'll meet soon. I promise, sweetheart." Steve muttered to himself and put his helmet on. He got on his motorcycle and rode off to the nearest building with a rooftop helipad.
Steve had never thought about that. Just great, now Bucky had planted this thought inside his head. Steve kept replaying the moment Tony had kissed him on that day in his head. He couldn't help but think how soft Tony's lips were. Let's be honest, Steve hadn't expected a guy's lips to this soft and smooth.
But, Steve gripped him by the wrist and twisted it behind his back. It was impossible for Tony to break from Steve's iron grip. Steve got his face closer to Tony and gripped his jaws. He licked his lips and slowly went down to his neck.
Steve felt his face burning up, he knew he was blushing like crazy. Thank God! He had his helmet on. Otherwise, Tony would've caught him blushing and things might have gone awkward between them two.
Both of them weren't able describe their feelings with words. Steve was curious to know how the story was going to unfold, he didn't realize he was already reading half way through the book.
Tony felt a sudden tingling feeling inside, it was his first time hearing Steve call him by his first name. The way Steve said his name sounded so right, especially because of his deep voice.
"I don't want you to leave, Tony." Steve spoke, looking up at Tony devastated. He wished Tony would stay with him.
Steve wondered how it felt to be warm again. He reminisced about the good old days, he felt home sick. Steve didn't belong here, why was he even alive?
Tony! Steve shot his eyes wide open. He was welcomed by the most beautiful pair of hazel eyes. He knew who those belonged to. There was not even a single day, where Steve could forget about that day. It was that day, he felt so much alive, maybe that was because he was at the edge of dying.
"We'll start from moving side to side. slowly. You need to make sure to make eye contact with your partner. So, look me in the eyes, Rogers."
Tony played the music and faced toward Steve. "Since this is an romantic song, I'll show you a couple dance. Since I'm slightly shorter then you, I'll play as the girl. Just follow my lead."
The door was wide opened, Steve heard a voice speaking, but it sounded muffled. As Steve got near to the door. "-please Happy, wake up." A familiar voice spoke, the man had a sadness and desperate tone to his voice.
He and Pepper had broken up. They loved each other, but it just wasn't working out for them. Tony couldn't be a burden to Pepper anymore, she deserved someone way better then him.
A person in a black suit walked toward him and greeted him with a smile. It was his private secretary.
Even though it hasn't been an hour since he met him, Steve felt comfortable around him. There was something about the man he just couldn't put his fingers on it.
All of a sudden Steve's breathing weakened, he couldn't breathe properly. He reached his pocket to get his blue inhaler out, but it wasn't there, he must had left it at home.
"Well to be honest, I also love them and I just hoped that you loved them too and you do. Seems like we both have so much in common." Tony held out his hand again. "Let's be friends." To start a new friendship.
He parked his motorcycle and took off his helmet. Steve turned to Tony and they both started walking to the Cafe.
But, tonight he was free. So, there he was in the hospital. He asked the receptionist of where his mom was, the lady replied with a door number. Steve quickly thanked her and walked to the elevator.
Ever since that night, Steve spent most of his time doing portraits of Tony. Every time he closed his eyes, he'd always see Tony's beautiful smile.
Steve didn't budge an inch. He was way too strong for Tony. His hand still remained on his waist. "Why, why are you doing this to me, Tony?" He asked, his voice sounded so broken. "I thought you loved me?" He whispered.
Tony gently cupped Steve's face and fully focused on him. "Steve, I know you think, I'm being a jerk right now, not that I blame you because I totally am. But, soon you'll realize that our break up was bound to happen. Believe me, I didn't want to avoid you, being with you only made it harder for me to completely give up on you. I wasn't avoiding you for what happened that night, although you were kinda scary.
“That’s a yes. Thank God for that at least. So are you going to do something about it?” When Steve stayed miserably silent, staring at the floor, Bucky groaned. “Goddammit. It’s because it’s a sin, isn’t it?” Steve nodded, and came to sit down on Bucky’s bed, resting his head in his hands. “You know," Bucky said, "I’ve always thought that the Church has you so twisted up inside that you can’t see God for the scriptures."
“Leave?” Steve repeated as he reached for his surcoat and armor, throwing them over his head and fastening them with practiced hands even as Bucky’s agitation was making his heart race. “What’s happening?”
“A message from Brother Scott reached me when I was on my way.” Natasha glanced up at Steve, who was watching them intently. “I know where Barnes is, and it’s not good.”
Tony understood what Ana wasn’t saying. Even if Barnes lived, he might never walk properly again, or hold a sword. “Is there anything to be done?”
“It’s fine, Tony,” Steve muttered. The room was starting to feel too hot and close, just like the tavern had, so he opened the shutters to the cool night air.
“You only have yourself to blame for that one. Watch your ass, Cardinal,” Natasha said as she threw a leg over the windowsill.
Eventually, inevitably, Edwin’s horse brought them to the gates of Tony's manor, its thick walls and crenelated towers reflecting in the broad waters of the river Maine.  Few in the city spared them a glance as they wound their way through the city and up to the gates of the Chateau. “I am Lord Antoine Stark,” Tony said when the manor guards stopped them. “I am here to see my father.” The guards, recognizing him despite the cassock, waved them through without comment. Strangely, the one on the left gave him a sympathetic look as they passed, which made Tony's eyebrows draw together as he urged the horse forward, suddenly getting a bad feeling unrelated to the general dread of seeing his father.  As he drove up to the front door of the main house a groom came up to take the reins; he absently ordered the man to take the cart, along with Steve and Barnes, around to the chapel that also served as the infirmary as he climbed the stairs to the front door.
“Yes, Your Grace,” Steve said, swallowing thickly as his heart kicked in his chest. He couldn’t look away from the thin, unassuming length of braided leather, heart racing and mouth dry with want. He dragged his gaze away from it to look up at Stark, whose eyes were dark and heavy-lidded as he studied Steve, gaze lingering on the hardness between his legs. “It’s a whip,” Steve managed with difficulty; words seemed thick and hard to find. “For- for the mortification of the flesh.”
“Non nobis, Domine, non nobis, sed Nomini tuo da gloriam,” the man said in a low voice, making the sign of the cross.
“As you wish,” Tony said. He stroked the leather over Steve’s cheek and jaw, then let it unfurl against the bare skin of Steve’s chest, the chill of it making goosebumps race across his skin. “Then it is time for you to confess your sins.”
while he pressed hot, open-mouthed kisses on Steve's neck. Maybe – maybe Tony would use his mouth on him, Steve thought, breath catching; Bucky said that women would do that sometimes – then he was coming with Tony’s name on lips just from the thought of that warm, wet heat on his cock. He slumped against the tree, panting, knees weak as he shivered through the last aftershocks of pleasure.
going to hell for using a pillow,” and laughed when he felt said pillow hit him in the back of the head.
“This should be it,” he said, stopping in front of a stout wooden door. Sure enough, the hinges and latch were new, as was the lock keeping the door closed. Natasha lit a candle of her own and vanished around the corner while Tony handed Steve an iron crow. When Steve raised it to smash the lock open, Tony grabbed his arm and shook his head. “The hinges will be easier and make less noise,” he said, and Steve nodded sheepishly.
Steve looked down at the Templar cross on his chest and felt a bolt of terror that this might be the last time he would ever wear the crest of his Order. He looked back up at Stark and he must have seen what he felt in his eyes because he came over and put his hands on Steve’s shoulders.
“Oh, no. Don’t tell me my father is at the manor right now,” Tony said with dismay as he sat down at the table. “He’s usually in Paris this time of year.”
“I went to the Captain of the King’s Guard and pointed out that if the Templars had truly been practicing heresy, then the Templar keep was unholy ground and his men were risking their immortal souls by being inside.”  The corner of Stark’s mouth curled up in amusement as he cut a bite of chicken.  “He, of course, knew that this whole thing was political and that the heresy thing was nonsense, but it put a stop to the looting post haste.  My priests and I were able to go through the keep and gather up everyone’s personal belongings as well as some of the more, hmm,
“The Iron Cardinal protects people around here, so they tend to defer to his judgment,” Tony said vaguely. “I could arrange an introduction, if you want, but he’s in Paris.”
“Fine,” Steve said grudgingly, trying to put Cardinal Stark from his thoughts. Back at the Tower, Steve followed Bucky back to the Grandmaster’s office to report on his meeting with Cardinal Stark.  He was given new instructions then dismissed, but when he returned to his chambers he was too restless to read or meditate, so he collected his sketchbook and some charcoal pencils and went for a walk.  There was a park along the Seine that had beautiful flowering trees this time of year, so Steve set his feet in that direction and tried to clear his thoughts.  It worked, for the most part, until he caught a glimpse of a profile that seemed familiar crossing the street.
“Oh shit.” Bucky paled. “Stark- he’s not…you don’t think they-” Bucky started, but Steve was shaking his head before Bucky could finish.
Tony barely resisted the impulse to sigh again. "I'm fine," he said shortly. He really should warn Steve about the family drama that he was about to walk into, but the last thing Tony felt like doing right now was talking about his father.
He slowed and came to a halt in the middle of the road, heart racing less from the exercise than the turn of his thoughts. He raked his fingers across his scalp, hoping the sting would distract him, but finally a groan, he gave in and stepped off the road in search of privacy.  Finding a small stand of trees, he fumbled with his robe and unfastened his braes, pulling out his erection. He was guiltily aware that he was barely hidden from the road, braced against a tree with his breath was sawing roughly in and out of his lungs as he stroked himself, but he was already too far gone to stop. He closed his eyes and bit back a curse at the toe-curling pleasure as he took himself in hand. He imagined going back to the inn and finding Tony still lounging in tangled sheets, eyes heavy-lidded.
“Uh, yes,” Steve said. “I was just making sure we weren’t forgetting anything.” Even though Tony studiously avoided meeting his eyes as he climbed into the back of the cart with Bucky and didn't say a word, Steve felt better than he had in days.
Bucky snorted and rolled his eyes at that.  “It’s not as if he’s public about his peccadillos.  I think most of the gossip I hear about him is that he lets the wine flow a little too freely at his dinner parties and that he has half of the government in his pocket.”
“Don’t be so dramatic,” Tony said, rolling his eyes. “I just need an hour or two, not the whole night.”
Steve made a noncommittal noise at that. His eyebrows drew together as he tried to imagine Tony as a simple pastor, delivering sermons, blessing babies and giving last rites. A week ago he would have dismissed it as impossible, but now... He turned his head to study Tony, running his eyes over Tony’s short hair and clean-shaven jaw, realizing that he seemed so much younger and more open here than he ever had in Paris. Which was the real person, he wondered: the dissolute Cardinal Stark, or Tony with the stars in his eyes?
Steve frowned. “I’m sure I don’t…” But then he realized what Bucky meant. A social gathering held by Cardinal Stark would likely have all the most important people of Paris there, and fortunes had been made and broken at such dinners. Bucky would have been on the fringes of such events as the Grand Master’s aide de camp, but this event would effectively thrust him into center stage. “I’m not sure how much help I’ll be, but I’ll do my best,” he said finally. “I’d rather face a hundred Saracens in battle than have dinner with a dozen nobles.”
“I’m surprised Howard wasn’t able to dig up a distant cousin to take it. Though I suppose if he had, he would have made sure that I knew about it.” Tony honestly hadn’t put much thought about what would happen to the duchy and the attached land and assets when Howard died, mostly because he expected to have a few more years time before it became an issue. Traditionally, if a nobleman died without anyone to inherit, everything went to the crown; since Tony was a Cardinal, the lands would belong to the Church. Which wouldn’t be the worst thing, except that since the estate was outside of Paris, Tony wouldn’t be the one in charge of them and the idea of giving up control of his family’s ancestral estates was intolerable. “If Howard wasn’t so concerned about it, he shouldn’t have made me take my vows.”
By the time Tony had packed the trunk and was ready to leave in the morning, he could see Rodgers was already leading the horse out to hitch it to the wagon. Tony held the horse’s head as Rodgers fastened the straps of the harness, trying to figure out how to apologize for teasing him last night. “Steve,” he started, but lost his courage when Steve looked up at him, blue eyes remote. “Do you want breakfast?” he said instead.
“Yes, Your Grace,” Steve mumbled, wondering if he sounded as delirious as he felt. “Thank- thank you,” he said voice stuttering as Stark slid his thumb inside, tugging on his rim while he pressed his fingers against the sensitive stretch of skin between Steve’s hole and his balls, putting pressure on something that made Steve’s cock release a spurt of wetness. Stark continued to take his time, one hand sliding over Steve’s body as if enjoying the feeling of his skin while the other continued to slowly work him open. Time stretched as Steve felt drugged and strung out on sensation, both wanting this thick pulse of pleasure to last forever and ready for the bright cleansing fire of release. When his body had adjusted, no longer offering any resistance to the glide of Stark’s fingers, the fingers disappeared and were replaced with a larger, blunter pressure against his hole.
Tony scowled. "In part," he admitted grudgingly. Steve waited a moment, clearly inviting him to continue, but Tony stubbornly kept his mouth closed.
Stane pulled a folded piece of paper out of an interior pocket of his coat and handed it over. Tony’s blood ran cold when he flipped it over and saw the seal, the wax red as blood stamped with a many-headed serpent.
The bells of Notre Dame were ringing midnight when he reined his most recent horse to a stop in front of the Church. He pushed his way past the night priest and headed towards Tony’s quarters, looking for someone who could take him to Sister Natasha. He didn’t know how she found out he was here, but he was turning a corner and found her in front of him, hair covered by a simple scarf rather than a wimple from where she had dressed in a hurry.
Tony shook his head. “Hassam, if you want to help, we need someone to take word of the Hydra to Paris. I will tell you how to find the Iron Cardinal, and if you tell him what you know he will know what to do.”
Tony looked at Bucky. He let out his hand in front of Bucky, waiting for an hand shake. "You must be James Barnes!" He said. Bucky took his hand and shook it.
Tony was too drunk to get startled by him. Steve's eyes met with his, he felt a stab in his heart, he saw nothing but pain in Tony's eyes. Oh how he wished he could take away all of his pain, with a snap of his fingers.
When all of sudden someone had bumped right into him. The smaller man's face was buried into his chest. Steve could feel the man's lips touching his skin  through his tight shirt.
Steve must've be dreaming. He must've heard it wrong. Yep, his ears were definitely deceiving him. Steve was lost in his thoughts, debating whether this was real or just a dream.
After a quick shower, Tony got out. He wore a small towel around his waist and stepped out the bathroom into his bedroom.
Even though, the rain was pouring down on them, Steve was able to feel the man's body heat, it was so fucking warm.
Just before he could even take the first step, a warm hand held Steve's hand stopping him from leaving. "Where do you think you're going, sweet cheeks?" The voice that Steve thought was asleep asked.
Tony was wet and so opened for Steve to take him already. He couldn't stop from moaning, all Tony felt was pleasure.
"Ahem!" Tony cleared his throat, to get their attention, as they were too busy in their own world. They were both startled by the sudden voice, they turned toward Tony.
Bucky gasped. "You're a psychic, aren't you?" He eyed Tony suspiciously, not that you can blame Bucky for thinking that. What other possible explanation could this be? Yep, Tony was definitely a psychic and a genius.
Steve placed his arms around Tony's waist and pulled him into a tight hug. He buried his face into junction of shoulder and neck.
"-Honeybear, don't be like that" Tony pouted like a child, he was being carried on the back by a man.
Peter noticed that there was something about the way his dad said that. Wait a second, did he care about Tony? One way to find out.
"How is it going Ana? What happened to Jarvis, is he alright...I see. Tell him to rest and get well soon. Take care Ana." With that Howard ended the call.
During the meeting Tony's eyes kept on drifting to Steve. He couldn't help but wonder why Steve looked so God damn familiar. Had they met somewhere else before?
Tony's eyes sparkled, a big smile formed on his face. "No way, your first was with me. The crown prince's first kiss was with me. My first kiss was with the prince. Oh God, tell me I'm not dreaming."
“You seem terribly concerned with what happens in my bed, Rodgers,” Stark said silkily.  His dark eyes glittered in the candlelight.  “Why is that?”
“Good,” Tony said with relief. “Now, I believe we both need our sleep,” he added, hoping to forestall Steve’s usual request for a kiss. As much as he craved them, he feared that Steve would hear the wheeze in his breathing and feel the slackness of his skin if he came any closer.
“Chatellerault,” Stark repeated thoughtfully. “Good swords come from there, I took a tour of their blacksmith shops a few years ago. I know the Vicomte, too, he's an old family friend.” He looked down at his robes ruefully and passed a hand through his shorn hair. “I don’t think I’ll be calling on him this time, though. But that’s a good place to start, I think a former knight would blend in well in that town.”
“Yes, Your Grace?” His eyes fell on Steve with confusion but he didn’t have time to comment because Stark was already giving out orders.
Stark didn’t turn, but he did tilt his head in acknowledgement of Steve’s apology. “If you are insisting on this mad quest to find your friend, we will leave the day after tomorrow,” he said. “I have arrangements to make.”
Tony watched as she climbed back onto her horse with a tired sigh, leading the other two by their reins, finally turning away when she was out of sight. Inside, he found Steve standing awkwardly outside the door of Ana and Edwin’s spare bedroom, watching while Ana and her servant bustled around Barnes. Barnes’ filthy clothes were already in shredded rags at the foot of the bed and a kettle was starting to burble over the fireplace in the kitchen.
Stane studied him thoughtfully before sitting back. “Very well,” he said. Tony sat back as well, trying to cover his uneasiness with a sip of wine; he couldn’t tell if he’d convinced Stane or not. “But there is a good chance that these relics will end up in the hands of the Church, and if they do, I would expect you to make sure they come to me instead of being locked up in a vault in the Vatican.”
Steve nodded in agreement. “His color is already better,” he said. He pressed a hand to Tony’s forehead, which was already noticeably cooler. “I think it’s working.” He took the grail from Natasha’s limp fingers, studying it with wonder. “You were right,” he said to Bucky, voice thick and eyes damp. “Thank you.”
“Yes, I see,” Stark said after a few moments. He put his hand on Steve’s shoulder and squeezed. “You may stop.”
“I swear on the Cross, Tony.” Steve leaned forward in his chair like he was trying to look Tony in the eyes. Tony shifted so that his face was in shadow, praying that the dying light of the fire wouldn’t betray him. “I’ll do exactly as you say.”
“Thanks,” Tony said dryly. He had no doubt that rumors of his affliction had already spread like wildfire amongst the staff, because they were being so solicitous that Tony had finally had to order them to go away and leave him in peace.
“Allah yameek, my friend,” Sam said as he closed the chest and relocked it. “May it save the Iron Cardinal, I would very much like to meet him again.”
“Thank you for waiting,” Tony said as he entered his study, polite smile firmly in place as he accepted the glass of wine Stane had waiting for him.
“He wants to expand the church at the Castle to house some relics we brought back from Jerusalem, but he needs approval. He was hoping I could put out feelers to see how people felt about it before he approaches people more formally.”
“And Stane sees an opportunity to have them all for himself,” Tony finished. “And unfortunately for Barnes, he runs straight towards the architect of this whole mess."
“Right,” Tony said with a nod, and stared down at the clothes he discarded as if wondering what they were doing on the floor, then stooped over to pick them up as Steve passed him to go to the bedroom.
Tony fled back into the inn and returned after a few minutes with eggs, toast, and a few rashers of bacon. He loaded their chest into the wagon as Steve ate, the silence between them painfully awkward. “I’ll drive,” he muttered when they were ready to go. If he didn’t have something to do with his hands right now he’d go mad. Thankfully Steve just nodded and climbed into the side seat. Unlike the previous two days, the silence between them today was agonizing; Steve was sitting next to him, stiff-backed and staring straight ahead, while Tony hunched defensively over the reins. Tony must have thought of and discarded dozens of potential conversational topics, things he wouldn’t have hesitated to bring up yesterday, but every time he saw Steve out of the corner of his eye he ended up deciding that discretion was the better form of valor.
“Have you always been this naïve?” Stark said sharply.  “Or has the past few week of idleness rotted your brain?”
“His Excellency has many urgent matters to deal with right now.” Steve could see the alarm in the man’s eyes, but he was otherwise unmoved. Steve would commend him for his bravery when he ever got to speak to Tony; it wasn’t many that would stay fast in front of Steve in a rage. He was strongly tempted to move the man and find Tony himself, but knew that was probably the last thing Tony would want. If he hadn’t come to check on Bucky, it was because something important was keeping him.
Tony gave him a sympathetic smile. This morning he looked tired, the lines around his eyes deeper than normal and his shoulders slumped like he was carrying a heavy weight, but his smile was genuine enough. “Yeah, there’s a lot of that going around. Can I see your hands?” When Bucky offered him the closest one, Tony gently unwound the bandages and carefully inspected the broken bones that Anna had set. They were still swollen but to Steve’s relief the skin wasn’t hot or red, so there didn’t seem to be any infection.
Tony shook his head. “He’s gone, he doesn’t suspect anything. I think.” He opened his mouth like he was going to say something else, but apparently thought better of it because instead he just took a swallow of wine straight from the bottle.
After Rodgers had went back to his room, face drawn and pale, Tony went in search of Sister Natasha, eventually finding her in a corner of the nave conspiring with Sister Virginia, their heads bent together as they whispered.
“No." After glancing around the room with interest, she hopped up to sit on the bed and pulled out some tightly folded and sealed sheets of paper. "Sister Virginia has been wanting to know how you were doing, stuck here with Rodgers,” she said as Tony broke the seal and started reading. "So I thought I'd come myself instead of sending someone."
Tony’s face went slack. “What? But-” He glanced between his glass and Stane’s, who drained his wine smugly. Tony held his glass up to the light and saw with dismay that there was a film on the inside, smudged and missing in places where he’d put his mouth. Tony’s stomach twisted with fear and nausea as Stane set his glass on the table and took a small cloth pouch out of his coat. Reaching in, Stane pulled out a small, round, waxy pill, rolling it between his fingers.
“I have been speaking to innkeepers for the past two weeks of travel, and they all say that no one will buy my alcohol unless I get permission from this Iron Cardinal to sell it. I cannot tell if he must give it his blessing because distilled alcohol is
and I thought it must be a sin because I wanted you so badly. And it was easier to blame you than blame myself, so I took it out on you, and hurt you, and
Natasha slid an engraved disk with some sort of symbol on it across the table to the ironworker, who made it disappear before he slipped out the door of the tavern into the night. “So, you know where we’re going?” She asked Tony.
Yep, Steve's father was the king, so that made Steve the crown prince, the once and the future king of Americ Kingdom.
Those wounded scars that was left in his heart when he had woken up 75 years in the future, teared him into pieces. Every one he ever cared about vanished from existence. His mom, dad, Bucky and Peggy.
Sarah felt delusional when she heard that the man not only saved her son and bought him gifts, he even paid the full treatments and medications for Steve.
He wrapped his arms around him and hugged him. Steve felt so happy. He loved seeing Tony in his arms.
Tony stared at Pepper, slightly squinting his eyes. "What did I do to deserve you in my life, Pep?" He asked, as he gently flicked her forehead with the tip of his fingers.
Howard got out of the car and looked at his best friend in defeat. He didn't what to dodo. “My wife and I have go to this business trip for 2 weeks, but the person who was supposed to look after Tony, suddenly fell ill. He was the only person I could trust to watch Tony for us. But in a short time like this, I can't find a nanny that is trustable to watch over Tony in our mansion all alone. "
Tony gasped, his eyes widened. "Wait, what! No fucking way. I thought you'd be two or three years younger then me." Tony said. "Damn it Rogers, now I feel insercure about my visuals when standing next to you." Tony pouted.
Tony blinked in confusion. "I only said that 'cause I thought Steve might've be uncomfortable. Especially, with someone he only just met." Tony replied. "I didn't mean it in a rude way or anything, Steve. I just wanted to let you know that, it's okay to reject, even if it's a Stark." He said, while looking at Steve. Tony had a frown on his face.
"Please forgive me, Steven. I promise when the day you finally remember, I won't ever come in between you and Anthony. I know how much he means to you." King Joseph gently caressed Steve's hair and gave him a peck on his forehead.
Steve jumped out of bed and searched for the man. He needed Antonio, he was the only person that was able to warm him up.
Steve felt as if the time had froze with him. A sudden pain rushed into his heart like a sharp knife that had constantly stabbed him right in the heart, tearing him down piece by piece. It was slow and painful.
Especially those beautiful glacier eyes of his, Steve could've sworn the man's eyes were glowing in the moonlight. He was captivated by those alluring eyes.
Steve didn't want to say goodbye to Tony. He suddenly felt desolate, as the air around him was filled of melancholy.
Ever since that night, Steve only thought of Tony. He wanted to see him. But little did Steve know, he was going to meet him this soon. Out of all time in the world, it had to be during a mission.
"Not that I blame you, after all Stark is an attractive guy, even straight guys fall for him" Bucky replied with a smirk. He stood up and walked near Steve.
Rhodey parted his body away from Tony's, he had an weak smile. "Yeah, but not until you are old, do you hear me Tony" He replied, while messing up Tony's hair.
Steve desperately hoped the man was in the bathroom doing a shower, but the bathroom was empty. There was no sign of the man, he was gone.
Howard let out a chuckle. Steve was at edge of bursting into laughter. Somehow, he held it in. It's hasn't even been 5 minutes and Tony was already making him laugh without even trying.
Well, It's not like he was actually lying about his name. Anthony could also be pronounced as Antonio. His mom had always called him by Antonio since he was born.
It sounded like a threat, did this man actually dare to threaten Steve? Steve tried moving, but the grip was iron tight. Okay, maybe Steve wasn't putting enough pressure, he was aware of his inhumane strength and it scared him; that's why he restrained his true strength.
Steve was so tempted to go there and pull Tony into a tight hug. He wanted to tell him that it was going to be okay. Steve felt breathless, it was almost as if he had forgotten how to breathe properly.
He walked to Steve's side of the table and sat beside him. "Don't tell me you're a virgin?" Tony playfully whispered into his ear.
"If that's the case, Why don't you just produce an heir, that way a royal blood will inherit the throne and you can have Anthony back. " Joseph added. He had a point though.
Steve couldn't believe his ears. Tony actually did care about him, even though they've only just met. Steve felt a great sense of joy after hearing that. The smile on his face grew bigger.
Bucky gently rubbed his back. "I'm sorry Steve. Tony Stark will never back down without a fight, so don't u dare to even think for a seconds his dead. He is one of the smartest, bravest man in the world. He is a Stark, and Stark men are made of iron. Just don't give up on that hope, you need to stay strong, so you can protect him. Your Tony, Steve, his yours. Don't you ever lose hope." Bucky had meant every words he said. He'd never deceive Steve by saying lies, Never.
"I-I'm so s-sorry Steve, I..." Tony stuttered. He didn't know what else to say other then how sorry he was.
Two guys hugging in the rain, especially this late at night. There's no way they wouldn't be mistaken for a couple. PDA tends to make anyone feel awkward, even  scumbags like those mother fuckers.
Tony moaning his name, sounded so perfect on that mouth of his. For some reasons it had turned him on. Steve slide another finger inside him without any struggle. Tony seems to had open up for him.
Steve's eyes drifted back to the painting in front of him, a smirk appeared on his face. "I can't wait for the day to make you completely mine, Tony." He whispered softly, making a promise to himself.
Tony groaned in frustration, he ran his fingers through his hair. "What the fuck! That doesn't explain anything."
Steve looked at his hand. Tony had cleaned his wound and bandage it so perfectly. "Thank you, Mr Stark, sorry I had wasted your time"
He felt a rash of panic, when he realized someone was at the door and was just about to enter inside. Steve cautiously crept to the kitchen and hid behind the counter.
But now that he was out of the man's embrace, his body began to freeze all over again. He felt like he was in the ice, he was trapped all alone.
Steve let out a chuckle. "Why does it sound, like you have a thing for Stark?" Steve asked as a joke.
Bucky always wanted to meet him; he admired Tony. He was dumbstruck about when he'd found out how young Tony was when he'd became a CEO.
Steve, barely even managed to stand straight. He was at the edge falling onto the cold concentrate ground, but he felt his body against someone, it felt so warm and comfortable.
Steve felt angry, he felt betrayed. Tony didn't want to stay with him and knowing that hurt him deeply. If Tony were to leave today, Steve probably wouldn't see him for another decade, just like his father and Tony's dad.
"Shit, Pep he's burning up, we need to take him to the hospital." Tony panicked, as he took him in his arms and carried him to his car.
Rhodey and Pepper looked at each other and smirked. Tony knew that face, they were definitely up to something. Tony gulped, that something can't be good. Dear Lord, Tony didn't want to know. He already knew what they're going to say.
Tony's voice was a medley to Steve's ears. Something about Tony made him let his guard down. Steve felt safe next Tony, he felt comfortable. Even though, Tony and him barely even had a conversation together. Then why was it that Steve felt this way about Tony?
"No way! He's my second favourite character too. Looks like we both have something in common, other then good looks." Tony chuckled.
Tony gave him a puzzled look. "Knew what exactly? Actually don't say anything 'cause I've got a feeling that I'm gonna regret it later." He said, while putting his hand in front to emphasise to stop.
Steve felt a sudden pain in his cheeks, Tony had pulled him by the cheeks. "See, you felt that didn't you, it's not dream. So, do you want to be friends with me? " Tony's hand was still waiting in the air.
"Sweetie! You do realize you're blushing like crazy " Pepper stated, while trying to move the cushion away from Tony's face.
Soon they were out of condoms and finally decided to give a break to their body. Soon they both fell asleep.
"What were doing when you noticed Steve?" Rhodey asked, even though he already knew the answer to that.
Tears streamed down Tony's face, as he realized something. "Oh- G-god...w-wh-at have I d-done!" He stuttered, as his voice trembled.
"N-nothing" Tony stuttered. Why was he even stuttering? Wait, could it be that he's embarrassed? But why? Tony's mind was full of questions.
Tony's eyes lit up in excitement. "WOW, It's exactly like the movie I watched. But, this time it happened in real life. " Tony moved closer to Steve and held his hand and intertwined them tightly yet gently. "Do you know what that means? It means we're soulmates."
“I’m just glad you’re okay.” Sarah cupped Steve's face and placed a kiss on his forehead. "I'll get you something to eat." With that said, she exited the room.
Steve let out a deep sigh, there no point in asking J.A.R.V.I.S. Tony had obviously programmed the A.I not to tell Steve about his whereabouts. Not that he blames Tony for that.
Bucky hugged him "Awww! Stevie that's adorable, I still can't believe Tony Stark stole your heart. You just need to win him over. But, don't give up, in the future he might be all yours." Bucky cheered brightly, as a smile formed on his face.
The guy wrapped his arms around Steve's neck. "How about tonight, you make me all yours." He suggested, while biting his bottom lips, clearly seducing Steve.
Bucky felt apprehensive about being in this situation. This wasn't the time for him to be panicking, no matter he had wake up from this odious nightmare. It was as if he was trapped in a place that was full of darkness.
"Captain, finally had the chance to meet you, Nat told me so much about you" Tony greeted with a smile and shook Steve's hand.
