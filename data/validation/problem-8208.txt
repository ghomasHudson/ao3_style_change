“I call people weird names all the time,” Tony protests. “How about snookums? Honeybunny? Sweetcheeks? Okay fine,” he concedes at the return of the Sullen Steve Stare. He swallows around the rest of the babble bubbling at the back of his throat. “Steve it is.”
Tony sits up, letting the sheets pool at his waist as he looks around the room, spotting Steve’s neatly folded pajamas at the foot of their bed and briefly wonders if Steve went out into town. He’s thinking maybe he should text his husband to ask where he is when he sees a tray with a closed silver cloche and a thermos of coffee on their little table in the sitting area. Steve must’ve ordered room service before he left.
Thor’s enormous shoulders are heaving with sobs where he sits next to Bruce, and to their side is an empty chair left for Nat. Clint is on the other side and Tony sees Bucky bury his face in Sam’s shoulder next to him. Scott is openly crying next to Hope and a scowling Hank Pym. Somewhere towards the middle, Carol and Valkyrie are grinning with bright joy. Wanda has a hand covering her mouth, her eyes crinkled by her smile as Vision holds her tight against his side. Strange is sitting with his wizard friend Wong, and T’Challa and his Dora Milaje. Pepper is sitting with May and Happy, next to Morgan, Peter, and Harley at the front. Even from the distance, Tony can see their beaming happiness and eyes glimmering with tears.
He had some choice words for the oafs standing menacingly in front of him, and after the second time they called him a fag, he had yawned and calmly asked, “you got anything more creative than that, you singled-celled diatoms?”
Good night
“Tony, hey, Tones, you with me?” Tony nods slightly and Rhodey takes the glass from DUM-E’s arm, patting him on the head and pushing it gently into Tony’s hands. He sounds upset and Tony instantly feels guilty, lord only knows what time it is… Tony’s probably gone and woken him up with some stupid shit. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on how you look at it, Rhodey knows him far too well and has already figured out what Tony’s about to say before he speaks. “It’s 4:22 AM, JARVIS asked me if I could come help you out because you weren’t responding to him.” Tony groans inwardly at that, or apparently outwardly because Rhodey frowns. “None of that, this is literally why I’m here. I told you if you need anything now that he’s back to call me. There’s absolutely no reason you need to be doing this alone. Besides, you’d do the same for me.” Rhodey’s right, obviously. He usually is. “Are you sure this is a good idea?”
“What year is- oh my god that’s an awful joke you’re awful.” Tony sits up to glare but it doesn’t last very long because Rhodey is making some stupid face and he has to laugh a little at that.
“It’s fine don’t worry about it, wasn’t much else you could’ve done.”
After the meeting is finally over Tony walks slowly back to his room, he’s not entirely sure what to do. Steve had gotten stuck back in the conference room, talking to Sam and Nat. He’s almost glad for it, it means he doesn’t have to figure out what to do just yet. He’s opening the door when he hears footsteps again, and he turns to look up at Steve, his arm partially outstretched, reaching. He lets out a breath he didn’t know he was holding and walks into the room, leaving the door open behind him.
Rogers,
You know I really am jealous that you’re in Wakanda, if I could just see their tech, talk with some of their engineers. God I could learn so much from them, I’m going to have to bother T’Challa for a tour one day, I don’t actually think he’d let me in for me to have one but I can dream. I know his sister makes a lot of his tech I’d really love to talk to her, god she’s probably already surpassed me but it’d be fantastic to talk to her, get some ideas. I don’t think they’d ever let me touch their tech either, they seem pretty protective of it which is fair, I know the feeling. Gotta be nice weather there too, its been raining all week here. Don’t get me wrong I like rain but when there’s no one around and its just that miserable cloudy grey weather…  you know how it is.
“Well I’m not letting you go back to that apartment, you’ll break a hip or something and I’ll have to get you Life Alert. Your room is already set up anyways, it’d be a waste.” Both of them know Tony is deflecting but too bad, that’s what he does best, he’ll deflect all conversations about his feelings and then one day he’ll die and he won’t have to worry about it anymore. The elevator door opens, mercifully bringing the conversation to an end. “I don’t think I have to give you the grand tour, oh aside from the fact that JARVIS is back. Say hi J.”
I’m not sure how I feel about you moving in, I know I said you could, and I meant that, but part of me thinks I’m being too hasty… but only part of me. I thought I’d be more angry at you, or at least more upset? I don’t know… all of today just felt, so familiar and I’d be lying if I said I haven’t missed it. Missed having you around… It won’t be okay right away, it still isn’t okay now but I think, I think I trust you. I’ve had all this time to think and write and I was so worried it’d all fall apart when I saw you. I mean I did freak out a bit at first but… after that first day, it was just such a relief to not be upset. Its so exhausting to be upset. I think you already know I forgive you… and that I’m sorry for what I did as well. I don’t know if either of us will be able to move on right away, and I think that’s okay, but I know I’m doing a lot better than I was a few months ago and I’ll take what I can get.
“You know, saying it is probably gonna bite me in the ass but I can’t help thinking…”
Extra details: Dates for the letters are October 17th, 18th, and 21st. Steve arrives on the 25th which means October is almost over, I think this is the longest month in the world. Nat made a salad with roasted chickpeas and grilled chicken, it's probably not going to be as good tomorrow he really should've just eaten it.
“I still have, well, I have a place back in Brooklyn that they gave me a few years back. So I’ll be out of your hair, I won’t bother you at all so there’s no need to worry about that.”
“Okay I’m gonna put a movie on for a bit then, I’m thinking Little Mermaid.”
“This is nice.”
Now, now its so quiet. JARVIS puts music on whenever I’m awake so I don’t get so wrapped up in my thoughts and it helps, a bit. I talked to Bruce last week… He’s doing good but he’s staying of the grid which I don’t blame him for. I miss him… I haven’t heard from Nat in a while but that’s kind of par for the course, she can’t do deep cover so well after you two put all that info up, neither can Clint, but she’s keeping busy, working.
Tony reacts instantly, or doesn’t, depending on who’s perspective you’re looking from. To him, it’s a full body reaction. He freezes, staying absolutely still on the ground, his mind completely blank, and not in any pleasant way. There’s alarm bells going off in his head, he can hear them distantly but there’s nothing he can do about it, not now. He can feel the cold in his bones, Steve is going to kill him. Somewhere, deep in his mind Tony is okay with that, it’s better this way, sure he’s angry at him but it’s better for the world to lose Tony Stark than Steve Rogers. Not that he would’ve killed Steve, not that he was trying to, he’s not sure if he would’ve been able to if he was, but it was better like this anyway. Time seems to be moving in slow motion, he focuses his vision and he can see Steve’s face. It’s concerned, very concerned. Why is he concerned? He’s supposed to be angry. He notices distantly that he’s not in the suit, that’s unfortunate, he’s definitely going to die then, he really should’ve worn it, to be honest he thought he did. As he looks up at Steve again something is even more off, he’s not wearing his suit either, that’s weird, he’s so sure he was just wearing it, he just saw it… Steve’s mouth is moving and Tony tries to make out the words, they might be important, he’s not sure why but it feels essential that he tries. He really can’t though, he lets his eyes unfocus, it’s too difficult to try right now, he just wants this to be over. Unfortunately, it seems that Steve has other plans.
Rogers,
Hopefully this chapter being longer (like over double the usual length lol) makes up for the lateness! I've been trying to make them a bit longer lately, I feel like they're too short and I can never finish my scenes in a short enough time anyways.
Oh thank god October is finally over. We've made progress! Yay communication!
Dinner is a quiet affair but not silent, both Nat and Rhodey are good at distracting Tony and they manage to drag him out of his whirlpool of anxiety for an hour. As they’re leaving the restaurant his phone lights up, “Looks like the gangs all here then. There’s going to be a short briefing about the plan for the weekend and then we’re left to our own devices for the rest of the evening.”
Tony’s mouth feels dry and his voice is hoarse when he speaks. “Yes, yeah. It’s fine, I’ll be fine. It’s just, it’s just gonna take some getting used to is all.” Rhodey continues to frown.
I hate how quiet it is here. Rhodey and Pep come to visit sometimes, but, they’re busy people you know? That’s part of why I used to throw so many parties, I don’t really like being alone… After Afghanistan, well I didn’t mind so much then, I had so much to do and so much to plan and organize… it was all consuming… After New York, well I protested a lot when people started moving in but I never really meant it. It was good to have people around, people I cared about.
(See the end of the chapter for
I missed your smile.
“Uh, thank you for the uh,” Tony raises his mug again.
“I really think things are gonna be alright.”
Dawn of the second day of the anxiety conference. Will they actually talk to each other? Maybe! Will progress be made? Kinda! Are either of them good at this? Dear god no!
I can’t believe endgame destroyed my headcanon of Steve being a decent cook, what did I ever do to you! (No I will not be discussing this movie, I live in the past now, where things don’t hurt and I can rot my teeth with dumb fluff.)
I don’t hate Barnes. I’m not so sure about you.
Like all the government facilities Tony has had the unfortunate pleasure of spending a great deal of time in, this one is lit with shitty fluorescent lights. Lights that he knows from years of experience make him look terrible and drawn and honestly, you’d think they could afford better lighting in here. These shitty lights however, do nothing to detract from the way Steve looks when Tony sees him for the first time in almost six months. Steve-Rogers, Tony tries and fails to mentally correct, is still unfairly beautiful, he looks tired, still strong and imposing, and all, leadery, but tired. He’s still trying to decide how he feels about the beard when Steve looks away from whoever he was having a conversation with, Tony honestly hadn’t bothered to look, and makes eye contact. Tony’s heart stutters for a second and he has to look away, shit, he thinks, this is not going how he planned.
“You disgust me Barton.” Clint attempts to retort but instead chokes on said mouthful. Nat, having somehow entered the room at this point, whacks him on the back. Cereal gets on the floor and Tony looks at it in horror. “What did I literally just say. This house is a nightmare, I can’t believe I don’t make you people pay rent.”
Next week may be a little late as well unfortunately as my sister is coming home for a visit this weekend but I'll have a good amount of time to write next week!
This weekend has been a lot to handle… I’m glad it all happened but I’m gonna need to go home and hole myself up in the workshop for about a week. Except I can’t because everyone’s coming back and I need to make arrangements. It won’t be too much work though; your rooms are all pretty much how you left them before people started moving out to the compound. I’ll have to get personal effects moved back to the tower. In some ways I feel a little guilty that I don’t want to go back there, it took a while to get that place up and running and I designed it pretty well if I do say so myself. I don’t know though, I never really lived there and it’s not like its going to be empty. All the new blood, Rhodey says he might be moving out there to help out but I don’t know how much of that he said to spite me since he keeps turning down my invitations to the tower. I think it’d be good for him though as much as I would like him closer. He’s good with the kids and they respect him pretty well, they need someone a little more mature to help out and keep things together. No Sam and Bucky do not count.
my friends around me, I think I'm allowed to want that.
His awareness comes back slowly, first he realizes he’s warm, and that doesn’t make sense, and he’s in a bed and that’s not right at all. Steve seems to be gone too, where did he go? Did he leave with Bucky? He looks around, he’s in his bedroom… he’s in his bedroom, oh Christ. It’s at that point he sees Steve standing by the door, his posture tight and anxious. He’s not looking at Tony, he’s talking quietly into his phone, brow furrowed. Tony is sitting on his bed, hunched over, knees to his chest. He lets his head fall to his knees and closes his eyes. He’s still a bit shaky but he knows where he is now and what’s really happening and somehow that makes it worse. He feels so fragile and useless and ridiculous and he’s clearly upset Steve which fucking sucks.
Okay so school kicked my ass a lot harder than I thought it would this semester, thank god for winter holidays. I've actually written ahead a bit so I might be able to get another update out before school starts back up. Also this chapter is the proper length, yay! Hope you enjoyed!
Extra notes: Days are October 26th, 28th, 29th and 31st. Full guest list for the party is: Steve, Tony, Nat, Clint, Pepper, Rhodey, Sam, Bucky, Wanda, and Vision.
Fucking nightmares. They’re different now, they used to all be about Afghanistan, about drowning on land, then they were about watching everything I love die. Now they’re about Siberia, sometimes I die in them. I don’t know if the ones where I die are nightmares at all though, nightmares aren’t usually peaceful. You probably don’t know this but I had to reinstall the reactor again. Turns out if you slam someone in the chest with a shield and they already have a shitty heart it doesn’t go so well. Extremis didn’t fix me completely the first time and I don’t want to risk it again. I know it’s stable, I did the calculations myself, but its better this way. I did kind of miss it in a way, I got so used to having that light, it was odd to live without it. Not that I missed the pain, definitely not.
Me: *gets a full time job*
“I left it mostly as it was yes, too much of a hassle to redecorate. I should actually let you know that some of the lower levels have changed a bit, damages and what have you. JARVIS can fill you in on anything you need to know.” His phone rings, perfect timing, he pulls it out to look at it with a sigh, “I’ve really got to take this but feel free to make yourself at home, Nat and Rhodey are around somewhere.” Steve just nods, still looking around, as Tony gesticulates. He takes that moment to make his rather swift exit, down the hall, to the team elevator, workshop level, lock the door, darken glass, music, loud.
He opens his eyes again; Nat and Clint are bickering over space on the couch and he feels something warm in his chest. He really did miss these ridiculous people he calls friends. “What are we even watching, this looks inaccurate and terrible.”
Steve – Thank you for the heads up, I’ll talk to him
10:03 AM
Rogers,
The weather is getting better, it’s still cooler than usual which I actually don’t mind too much. New York isn’t always pleasant in the summer. The rain has stopped which is the main thing, and its harder to feel bad when its beautiful outside. Not that I take a ton of notice in the weather seeing as I mostly live in my lab these days. JARVIS makes me come up when he can and Pepper drags me out for the meetings I have to go to in person. Well not usually physically, she’s far too busy for that but she will call and threaten me which is close enough to get my ass in gear. SI isn’t doing anything too exciting right now unfortunately, I don’t have as much work to get lost in as I’d like.
So he closes his eyes and dreams.
“Fine. But this is going to suck for both of us and I want to sit down properly for it.” Steve nods, and they walk over the couches, sitting across from each other, the coffee table a wall between them. “I’m not going to go into the gritty details because honestly I don’t think that’s necessary… but I can give you the gist of it. What happened in Siberia really fucked me up, you know that, I know that. I already have, issues and it did me no favors there. I get flashbacks sometimes, have nightmares, it’s been getting better but having you around has made it a little more difficult.” Steve’s face is pained and Tony just knows he’s about to suggest he leave again so he holds up a hand before he can open his mouth. “No, and let me finish. It’s going to take a while for me to work through but it’s like immersion therapy, I have to learn how to deal with it, and I will. Sparring was a bit of a dumb idea, of course fighting you was going to trigger a flashback. Don’t go blaming yourself for that either, I suggested it so it’s my fault. I want you here okay? I want things to go back to the way they were, It’s going to take time but I think we can do it.”
I really hope they like everything I have planned… I think I know them well enough that what I plan will be something they’ll love but, y’know you always worry, at least I do anyways. They deserve this so much and I want to do my best to make it perfect for them. Happy was in an accident a few years back, I don’t know if you know, he was hurt pretty bad. It was my fault too, he was just trying to do his job and Killian and his cronies put him in a coma. He recovered, thank god, but, I still blame myself for that. Not to mention he’s my oldest friend apart from Rhodey and I’m happy to make him happy, heh. There’s still a lot to do before tomorrow so I’ve got to get on that.
(See the end of the chapter for
“How long was I out?” Steve turns back to glance at Tony, with a look of surprise and quickly ends his call.
What time is it? I should sleep, or start working on that armor… Ugh okay okay, Rhodey’s standing outside the door and giving me a look. Sleep then, I’ll start on it tomorrow, I wonder if I can do something about the power drain from the chest repuls-
“Ever the comedian,” he says pulling back. “You should take that routine of yours on tour. How are you?”
There’s a plate of food outside the door with a note, ‘Nat made dinner, figured you’d probably be hungry.’ It’s not signed but it’s in Steve’s handwriting, and even if it wasn’t, he’d know who did it. Not that no one else ever brought him food but, Steve was the only one who ever did, and also the one who wasn’t always let in. Rhodey tended to bring more sandwiches or pizza, things Tony could eat when distracted, and JARVIS always let him in. Pepper usually dragged him out instead. He brings the plate in and closes the door, staring at it. Nat made it, which means it will be pretty good, she’s an efficient cook.
The meetings go on much the same as before, changes are made, whole sections are thrown out, but Tony is sitting beside Steve now and that helps. Natasha gives him a look when he sits down beside him but he just shakes his head imperceptibly and mouths “later”. Rhodey just rolls his eyes. Now whenever Steve starts getting too jittery Tony can make a dumb comment about one of the advisors or other Avengers, and whenever Tony starts to get anxious or bored Steve can pass him little notes and drawings. It’s familiar, and Tony can feel everyone around them relax just a little. He supposes they didn’t really know how they’d both react when they saw each other again, even Tony hadn’t known. But this, this is something they used to do during Fury’s meetings before SHEILD shut down and during briefings after that. It makes him think that this just might work.
Rogers,
Rogers,
“Just about,” he laughs a little.
Rhodey grins and hugs him back, “I get to take a break from desk work and go on a free vacation, I’d be crazy to pass that up. Let’s go down to dinner, Natasha’s probably waiting for us already.”
“I’m gonna go ahead and call bullshit on that one Rogers, you look like you’re a million miles away right now.” Steve fidgets awkwardly and looks back down at his hands.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve pauses at that, his voice hopeful and quiet as he responds. “I guess not, pretty hard to with this bunch,” he smiles, looking down.
He doesn’t want to eat it. He takes two bites before placing it in the minifridge. The note, the note he almost throws away. He doesn’t want it, doesn’t want this yet, can’t handle it yet. He can’t throw it away so he puts it in a drawer instead, out of sight, out of mind, hopefully. He’s yawning then, it’s getting late and he probably shouldn’t get back to work or he won’t sleep at all. JARVIS turns out the lights upon his request and he goes to lie down on the couch. Going back upstairs means he might see someone however unlikely that may be, and he’s not really interested in speaking to or existing around anyone for at least a little while.
I'm really sorry for the lateness of this chapter, I got a second job last week and there's been a lot going on. I ended up writing the vast majority of this today since it was my first real day off in a while. Anyways I hope you enjoy the first chapter with actual dialogue and scenes!
and you call us losers?”
Tony almost laughs. He's reminded sharply of the first day he met Steve, on the first week of their freshman year. Tony was the new spectacle at their school, the infamous Stark Industries heir whose name constantly appears splashed across tabloid covers with equal parts outlandish rumors and news of innovative tech projects.
“Tony, is everything okay?” Steve asks, his brow furrowing in confusion.
Tony pales when he sees the envelope in Loki’s hand. That cannot be what he fucking thinks it is.
“Hey, it's not so bad,” Rhodey says as he pulls away. He squares his shoulders and takes a deep shuddering breath. “It's only Boston, Tones. There's always FaceTime and Skype. In fact, I’ll call you as soon as I get there. Will that make you feel better?”
Tony steels himself, wrapping his heart in every layer of armor forged from Howard, from his mother, from everything he’s ever known. He pastes on his best press smile and straightens his spine. He’s going to make this easier for the both of them, a parting gift. He will not fall apart in front of Steve.
sounds on his phone, but he knows he can't ignore Important Stark Industries Business. He sighs as he opens his email, walking into the kitchen so Steve and Sarah won't see his expression when he reads it.
Steve smiles and reaches over to wipe away some sauce from the corner of Tony's mouth. He either doesn't notice or pretends he doesn't notice the way Tony freezes with his breath caught in his throat as his thumb strokes over the curve of Tony's jaw.
bad. “Can we Seamless the pie or do they still live in the nineteenth century?”
now, and that’s a thought that will never not take Tony's breath away) perusing every colorful little shop they pass in hopes of finding the perfect gifts for their (
The first time, it was childish puppy love, an innocent little trifle. But this time, this was—is real. Tony is stupidly, deliriously in love with Steve. This is something that marks his soul, carves itself bone deep inside of him, and twines around his heart entrenched deep in the cavity of his chest and becomes a part of him. He doesn't know if he will ever recover from this, not when he feels so shattered and broken.
Between one moment and the next, there is a rush of wind, but that is impossible, the study has no windows, and then there is a sickening plasticky crack. Tony watches in horror as his bot tumbles to the ground, breaking into five pieces, the fingers he worked so hard to build now crooked and twisted. He looks up numbly with wide eyes to see his father's enraged expression and upraised hand.
“This,” Steve says, following the path down his prosthetic arm, skin warmed metal and gently humming circuits, “is your brilliance. Your incredible mind and your perseverance. Nothing can stop you.”
They’ve been through midterms and drunken nights and endless projects. They’ve been together through joy and heartbreak and loss. They had seen each other at their lowest points and at their highest, at their worst and at their best. Whenever Tony had looked, Rhodey had been steadfastly at his side. When he got the news about his parents, and when he refused to cry at their funeral. When he took over Stark Industries too young and too naïve and too unwilling to see Obediah Stane’s betrayal blackening his legacy. When shrapnel ripped his chest apart and he survived the darkness of a cave in Afghanistan to fall to his knees in the desert praying the helicopter in the sky wasn’t a mirage. When he argued with the Senate, when he was dying of palladium poisoning, when the Accords tore the Avengers apart, when they fought aliens and monsters, when his marriage crumbled, when Tony built a new life from scratch all over again. Rhodey held his hand and had his back through all of that.
“I'll be okay, Pepper. But you're just amazing and wonderful and I don't even deserve you—”
The diner Tony asks Steve to meet him at is a little hole in the wall in Brooklyn, a real neighborhood joint. It’s the one that Maria had taken him to a couple of times during some of her good days. The shabby rundown little coffee shop is the same as it was years ago. Everything is still beige and the floors are still stained and the vinyl booths are still cracked.
Tony watches as Steve scores again, intermittently turning to look back at Tony and completely ignoring the small crowd vying for his attention. His eyes are alight with a glowing smile as he gives Tony and Nat a little wave.
Happy looks between them for a long moment before asking, “You gonna be alright, boss?”
Tony takes a deep breath. “First, I would like to apologize for accosting you in the hallway yesterday. I was in a state of panic and I didn't know what else to do and the last thing I want to do is hurt Pepper and Rhodey.” And Pepper and Rhodey say he needs to work on owning his mistakes. Character growth, happening right here.
There, Steve stands military straight dressed in white and silk, the colorful hints of his tattoos peeking from beneath the cuffs of his sleeves. Tony barely registers the cut of his suit and the intricate vest tucked underneath. He focuses only on the gleam of Steve’s wobbly smile before his own vision blurs and everything shifts out of focus.
Tony shakes his head and pointedly takes another bite. “Wow,” is all he manages to say, hoping fervently that Steve doesn’t notice how much this is affecting him, but Tony is sure that he can probably hear his heart trying to pound its way out of his chest. He turns away so Steve won’t see how fast he’s blinking.
“I have a bit of Saturday afternoon free.”
She understands.
“Nope,” Tony replies, fluttering his lashes. “Only you.” He leans over to smack a big wet kiss on Pepper’s cheek, and Pepper gracefully takes it, quietly sighing in exasperation.
“I always thought if we had enough time,” Steve continues, “we could’ve gotten past this thing between us and maybe one day I could earn your forgiveness. But then—you didn’t come home. We had no choice but to think the worst.”
The whistle blows and the game starts. It's a brutal game that starts with a jarring clash. It starts off well enough and neither team gives an inch throughout the first half but by halftime their team is crushing the opponent, Steve leading them through each coordinated play.
“Oh darling boy,” Jarvis says thickly as he wipes the tears from Tony's face with his fingertips. “I'm not a fool, nor am I blind. I've seen the notes Steven wrote for you and I've seen the drawings he made of you. Yes, they are of you. And no one who is not in love with their muse will ever draw them so beautifully. There is affection in every stroke of his pencil, and it is plain as day for anyone who sees them.”
Cling and Bucky both make gagging noises as Sam grins and makes the second throw, a handful of popcorn hitting Tony on the cheek. It sparks all out war.
Tony looks over at him askance, pausing in the middle of licking his fingers clean. “Don't know what you mean. I've been great all day, honeybun.”
There’s a sharp inhalation from Steve as Tony resettles on top of him and his hands immediately fly to the crest of Tonys hips. His thumbs make slow circles against the slip of silky fabric he finds there. When he looks up to meet Tony's grin, Tony can see the flame in Steve’s eyes burning out the blue irises.
After that, with Steve’s hands at his waist gently guiding Tony, they settle into a slow rhythm that slowly stokes the burning blaze between them. Tony bears down on Steve’s cock as Steve thrusts up into him, grazing against that starburst spot with each stroke. Tony can feel the pleasure building even without touching his own cock as he clenches around Steve’s dick, the weight of it heavy inside of him, filling him so full he can feel Steve
“I can take it,” Steve says bravely.
“I'm sure your driver will appreciate the day off,” Steve says as he pulls Tony further and further away from the correct direction. “I'm going to show you something I'm seventy-eight percent sure you've never seen before.”
Sarah is already puttering around in the kitchen when they join her. Steve presses a quick kiss to her cheek she returns with a smile as he moves in to snatch the colander of vegetables from her hands.
Tony pays dearly for his laughter when Steve kicks off his skis and tackles him into one of the snowbanks. Before Tony can react and push him away, Steve is shoving a handful of snow down the collar of his jacket. Tony gasps as the ice cold snow melts against his warm skin, feels the unpleasant trickle of melted water running down his back and soaking through three layers of thermals and sweaters.
And just like that, Tony's mood sours and he's only vaguely aware that he's crushing the bag of popcorn in his hands and there's a rip at the bottom now and the kernels are falling out, they’re going everywhere, spilling onto the ground in front of him and Tony—Tony just wants to go home.
“I woke up this morning without my husband next to me,” Tony says, playing up the pout and throwing in some puppy eyes by staring up at Steve from beneath his lashes for good measure.
doesn't care, he's had enough of a night already. He smiles tightly and waves off his friends but Natasha takes one look at him and feigns tiredness too. She takes his hand with a soft, “Oh,
The grin grows wider and Steve squeezes his shoulders softly. “I know a place,” is all he says as he leads Tony through the halls and up to the front entrance.
“I'm going to give you the world one day,” Tony promises, tucking the pen behind his ear for safekeeping as he gulps down the rest of his coffee.
“Point is you don't have to,” Tony says. “It's an archaic and silly dick measuring contest and I'm not some bride parceled up with a dowry about to go to my new husband's village—”
“Maybe,” Tony echoes.
, they say.
“Jesus Christ,” Tony manages to croak past the lump forming in his throat. “I didn't realize you were such a poet, Rogers.” He pinches lightly at Steve’s side.
Tony immediately pulls away from Steve, cold settling at the base of his spine when the gravity of what he's done sets in. “
Steve tries to slow Tony down with a tighter grip on his thigh but that only encourages him to play dirty. When Steve is momentarily distracted by Tony sucking on his tongue, Tony reaches a hand down to take them both in his grip.
the gala. Good thing we’re not going anymore.”
Tony can barely get any air into his lungs, all of his blood flowing south and down and everything is electric and warm. “Y-yeah,” he manages to choke, feeling his cheeks heating pink when he looks down at the open softness of Steve's expression.
Pepper and Rhodey had tried earlier in the week before he turned off all notifications to get him to go out for New Year's Eve. He tells Pepper and Rhodey he’s fine, deflects their questions and sure, he’ll take a break and come out for the night. They’ll have a great time, go to one of the parties in the city, or book a hotel room and have their own, drink the last vestiges of the year away. Yeah, of course he'll come out.
“So I just assumed you wanted me around only as a fuck buddy but then there would be little moments that gave me hope. I thought you finally got it on New Year when you saw yourself in my drawings but I still should’ve said something. And it clearly left doubts in your mind.”
Nothing was ever real
Steve laughs softly, shifting them both to lay more comfortably on the narrow cushions. “You clearly do. Stop pouting.”
Loki doesn't say anything for a long time, and Tony hates the look he sees on his friend’s face. It's one part pity and two parts sadness. “Oh, Stark,” Loki finally sighs, and really, those two words say it all.
Steve is at the door again. Tony tells Jarvis to send him away. Jarvis tells him Steve sat on the stoop for four hours this time. Tony tells him he doesn't care.
Later, when Tony is asleep tucked up against his arm, Steve watches the rise and fall of Tony’s soft breaths and trails gentle fingers through his husband’s dark curls. Tony is still in his sleep like he never is awake, the furrows in his brows smoothed and the tension in his mouth gone.
It’s the Friday after their senior trip when Tony finally makes up his mind. He’s all jitters and bouncing leg throughout the day, and Steve writes him sweet little notes filled with tentative worry. Even Bucky sneaks him looks of concern from the side of his eye during lunch, but Tony’s mind is made up.
“It seems like I have no choice, do I?” Tony snarls, crossing his arms. “You're standing in front of the only exit.” He makes a mental note to add more fucking doors to his fucking lab, he needs to be able to escape in emergencies.
The next drawing was, well, pornographic. Steve and Tony in bed, clearly naked and sweating, Tony staring up at his lover with a breathless smile. Having drawn an excessive number of erotic sketches in his time, and of Tony in particular, Steve had decided in the interest of delicacy to censor the bottom half on this one – they were covered in a flimsy sheet from the waist down – but there was no plausible deniability left at all on what they were doing.
It was a simple drawing of the two of them, Steve in uniform and Tony wearing his Iron Man armor with the faceplate up. Steve had his arm around his teammate‘s shoulders and they were grinning at each other. It was harmless enough (especially compared to so many of the other sketches Steve had drawn of the two of them over the years), but he was still afraid that his heart lay plainly on this piece of paper.
They attend the same camp again the next year, Tony's last year of freedom before his life will belong to his father's company. Despite the year apart, their friendship is much the same and Janet is exactly as he remembers. The only difference is, Tony thinks he might be a little bit in love with her.
“And who’s that you got with you, Steve?” Ben asks, his smile turning curious.
The nights on the train make Tony feel as though they're in a bubble of time and space. There's probably a theory of relativity applicable there, but time feels both infinite and far too short when they have the train car to themselves. That's when they talk the most, in susurrating murmurs and soft voices, and Tony is the most honest when he's on those train rides with Steve, tucked in the curve of his arm.
They all sprawl out on one of the bearskins by the fire and Clint leads them through a verbal horror story roleplay, a simpler version of the elaborate D&D games they play at home. It's almost midnight by the time Tony is finally killed in a broken ship floating in the nothingness of space, and the story ends.
Of course Steve has got him, he always does. He always takes such good care of Tony. Steve who is so tender and gentle and loving as he worships every inch of Tony’s old and scarred body, reminding him these scars were the price of saving the universe, Steve is so proud of him, he always will be, he loves him so much.
“You don't have any bad sides,” Tony had retorted affectionately with a derisive snort.
Steve frowns but doesn't push anymore.
Tony doesn’t ask about his room again. He supposes he has no right to question Steve about whatever is in there, Peggy shrine or serial killer trophies or otherwise. If Steve doesn’t want to show him, there’s no reason for him to feel hurt about it.
Fuck it, they’re not going
“What the fuck,” Tony whispers, chest heaving as he flops back against the couch to stare at the ceiling.
It feels a lot like heartbreak when Rhodey hugs him goodbye with overly bright eyes and trembling arms. Tony swallows back his own tears and puts on his brave face, even as he struggles to keep himself from begging his best friend to stay.
“Lucky me,” Steve agrees, his shaky inhale sounding a lot like a sigh of relief. His grin spreads slow and warm on his face, lighting up his eyes and it's the most beautiful sight Tony's ever seen.
Homework falls by the wayside as the evening progresses. They give Dostoyevsky a real effort, they do, but an argument about the original series versus the new Star Trek reboot means
All of their friends are seated in the chairs, and the Avengers all turn in unison when Tony steps out onto the rooftop. He can feel dozens of wide and surprised eyes focus on him as he stands at the open patio door but his friends’ stares fade into the background when his gaze focuses on the person waiting for him at the end of the aisle.
“Hello, sweetheart,” Steve murmurs, his voice a rough low timbre, soft and intimate, words meant only for his ears.
But to have known Howard as a man like this, someone who had loved her so much and to have once been good and soft and loving, Tony thinks he would've wanted to cling to the memory and live in the past too. He now understands the
Tony convinces Steve they’re pretending they’re running away together on grand adventures, riding giant locomotives across the country. Steve laughs and indulges him, doesn’t see the sad truth in Tony’s eyes, wishing he can really run away with Steve.
He cheers every time Steve makes a particularly good throw and when Bucky or Clint makes a touchdown, shouting encouragement whenever Thor makes a particularly brutal tackle and when Sam makes an especially dexterous pass.
“Of you?” Bucky asks incredulously. “Nah, I would never let Stevie get close enough to me to do that. You look like you've been mauled by a wild animal.”
“And what makes you think I'm any different?” Tony asks, thinking of how he's going to intern at Stark Industries in a couple of years with a sick twist in his stomach.
“This relationship,” Tony clarifies. “I know it’s been a rough couple of weeks for you, with all of the extra scrutiny.”
“They don’t know the half of it.”
,” Tony breathes. He wriggles back against Steve’s thick cock, feeling heavy and full. He swears he can feel the shape of Steve inside him when he presses his hand against his belly. There are warm puffs of air against the nape of his neck as Steve breathes against him, pressing soft kisses to the top of his spine, and he arches back, encouraging Steve to move.
lays forgotten on the coffee table by chapter two.
“No!” Tony gasps between bouts of laughter as Steve relentlessly tickles him. He's trapped between Steve's chest and the couch and Steve clearly has the upper hand and a distinct lack of mercy, but that doesn't mean he's going to wave the white flag. Stark men are made of iron, and all that.
“Jealous when I call out another man’s name in bed with you?” Tony laughs and obediently raises his arms as Steve slides off his shirt.
“I had to almost fistfight Maria because she was really insisting that grey and black were a good color theme for
Tony sighs.
Tony keeps his mouth shut as Howard begins to start his tirade on how worthless Tony is, how slow his progress, how little he’s doing for Stark Industries, what a failure he’s going to become, how poorly his prototypes are performing, he’s so disappointed, he really expected more of his heir. It’s the same spiel as always. It’s nothing new.
By the end of it, they have three large cartons of old things Jarvis is going to take to Goodwill in the morning, and Tony can actually see his floors again. Huh, look at that. He had forgotten there’s carpet underneath all the junk. Maybe Nat is right. He does feel kind of better.
The first thrust always feels like too much as Steve’s dick stretches him wide. Tony moves his hand away from his own cock and reaches back to where his rim is open around Steve, feeling desperate to touch where they’re joined. Steve is barely halfway inside of him, going slow and gentle as always, but Tony has had enough. He sinks greedily down the rest of Steve’s length even as Steve’s hands tighten to bruising around his hips, and pulls him in for a wet and messy kiss.
„Ah.“ Well, that actually made sense.
His identicard beeped, making him jump. With shaking hands, he pulled it out.
„What?“ he said stupidly.
„What are you doing?“ Steve would have thought that taking something as crude as nails anywhere
„I think...“ Tony said slowly, putting his sandwich back on the plate, „I think you‘re trying to
„Sorry,“ Tony said, grimacing apologetically around a mouthful of sandwich. „Didn‘t mean to surprise you.“
„So, what can I do for you?“ Tony asked.
Steve stood there feeling like a wave had broken over him. The whole exchange had taken less than two minutes but had given him a veritable adrenaline boost. He sat down gingerly and took a moment to get his breathing back under control.
about it. To let him down gently.
Tony looked away and licked his lips. „I remember.“
Tony‘s grin widened. He always seemed to enjoy making people uncomfortable. „It‘s a Mark 6. I‘m not gonna use that one ever again. But its outer shell‘s got the same composition as my current model, and I thought it might be a good idea to test the resistance to various types of force on it.“
This might be the end of… everything.
At this, Tony raised his eyebrows and a slow grin spread across his face. „Since when do you care about Starktech software?“
He wasn‘t sure if that last one was too much.
were too much.
In the next drawing, they were sitting on the couch of the mansion‘s main living room. Although the object of their focus was out of sight, it was probably the TV. Steve was gesturing wildly at it in obvious annoyance, while Tony, his side pressed against Steve‘s and his arm around Steve‘s shoulders, seemed to be trying hard not to grin.
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath before looking at it properly.
amazing.
He really hoped Tony liked them.
„Uh… sure,“ Steve said, bewildered, thinking that at least Tony had forgotten about his sketching again.
„What do you want?“ Tony said breathlessly.
„I, um, I‘m gonna go for a run,“ Steve said, jerking his thumb towards the exit. „See you later.“
Damn it, Steve thought. He had hoped Tony had forgotten his initial question. „Nothing,“ he said. „But isn‘t the release of Starkpad 5 supposed to be next week and wasn‘t there an issue with the, uh, uplink of the camera software or something? Shouldn‘t you be there when they try to fix that?“
„For the drawing,“ Tony clarified. Was it Steve‘s imagination or were his ears going slightly pink?
Steve set his jaw defiantly. He knew what Tony was seeing in the picture, but he could still hold out hope that Tony wasn‘t actually
Heck, he wasn‘t sure if
What had he done? Tony was going to look at these sketches and
„Please?“ Tony said, and damn but there was no way he could resist Tony Stark pleading.
Two days later, he knocked on Tony‘s workshop door with seven paper sheets in his hand.
„Oh,“ Steve said. „Oh. Um. I…-“
Emboldened by the fact that he wasn‘t the only uncomfortable person in the room anymore, Steve ploughed on. „So I thought of some other scenes you might like, and I made you some more drawings.“ He held out the pieces of paper for Tony who took them with a confused frown. „Just, uh, tell me which ones of these you want.“
Well, Captain America was nothing if not brave bordering on reckless.
„In a minute,“ Tony waved a hand at him dismissively. „First let me see - ...oh.“
Then he blushed.
„Sure,“ he said numbly. „Yeah, of course.“
Steve swallowed.
If he was lucky, it was only a supervillain burning down DC.
currently didn‘t seem like a viable option. Instead, he felt more like walking home in a long, meandering line, possibly mapping all of Manhattan before facing Tony at all. Or ever again. Or just sitting on a park bench for the forseeable future. That seemed like a good plan.
The next was a close-up of the two of them kissing. Tony was not in the armor in this one, instead wearing a simple shirt and tie and a lovely blush on his one visible cheek. Their eyes were closed. Steve had one hand in Tony‘s hair, Tony had one hand curled around the back of Steve‘s neck. Once Tony reached this one, the case was probably settled. But Steve hadn‘t been able to resist producing just a few more scenes. For variety, he told himself. Nothing else.
, let me.”
“That was how we got into this mess in the first place,” Steve reminds him.
going to deal with this. He figures maybe he can call Rhodey now and cry and start heading for Boston. He's not running away. He's not! He's just going to see Rhodey. Yep. Rhodey, his bestest friend in all the world.
Excitement is buzzing through the gathered masses in their seats as everyone eagerly waits for the game to begin. The sun has long set and the sharp October night air is inky crisp blue. The stadium is washed in bright white halogens, enormous spotlights that cast everything in cutting clarity with sharp shadows on the edges and there’s a wet breeze in the air that promises rain for the upcoming weekend. The brass band is already playing as the cheerleaders hop and jump and somersault across the field.
Loki finds him in the labs early one morning before his first class. Tony barely has the presence of mind to do more than grunt in greeting and make grabby hands at the coffee Loki is holding out for him before going back to tinkering at his robotics project after taking a hearty sip. He barely notices that Loki looks a little bit uncertain and uncomfortable of all things, until he suddenly does.
“I guess,” Steve says quietly. “Peggy always said I was a really bad boyfriend. She says I didn't pay enough attention, and I never did any of the little small romantic things for her. I was too focused on the grand gestures. But—”
Tony nods and he consciously tries to loosen his fists where they’re curled into the sheets. “T-that’s good,” he says. He doesn’t ask why he still hasn’t seen her, or where she is now.
“Gee, thanks,” Steve replies with an equally fond smile in return, and he’s gladdened to see some of the joy returning to Tony as he stares back at Steve, the shape of his mouth a soft curve.
“I'm sorry,” Tony manages past the lump in his throat.
He stops trying.
“We can’t miss another event,” Steve murmurs, even as his hands are sliding up underneath Tony’s suit to grip at his waist. He leans in closer until his nose is pressed to Tony’s cheek, his beard tickling Tony’s chin. “Aren’t you supposed to be giving a keynote speech tonight?”
“I know you're only going because Thor is playing,” Tony says. He’d still stalling for time, but the more he thinks about it, the less he actually minds going to the game. Steve isn't the
And there's the earlier mood, returning with a rush of relief that warms Tony down to his toes. It's so easy to talk to Steve, alarmingly easy, but he knows if Steve really peels back the layers, he won't like what he finds. No one does when they look closely enough, not even his parents (
is there, TS for Tony Stark, the letters proudly worn by his husband). The buttons on the shirt go all the way up to his throat and cover the sacred heart that belongs to Tony too.
be clutched in Loki's hand now, mocking him that of course, his computers would never fail him but something as simple as
“I don't want to go,” Tony says, not petulantly at all. “I didn't wear my team gear. Didn't take you one to be so eager for football either. Wouldn't you much rather go host a seance or something, Hocus Pocus?” He gives Loki’s wide brim hat and all-black attire a pointed look. Loki is wearing a dress and pointed boots to a football game and they call
Steve winces away from Tony’s ice cold fingers and wraps them between his own sleep warm hands. He pulls them forward to press soft kisses against the knuckles.
Steve, they’ve been together all day, but the ache of being even an inch from his husband is too much to bear sometimes. Every kiss feels like coming home, warm and honey sweet, made new with every second they’re not pressed together as two halves of a whole. If Steve’s soft exhale is any indication, Tony knows he feels the same way too. It’s taken them over a decade to be here in this moment, and every second together is hard fought and earned in blood and war. But no time to be maudlin now.
Steve’s concerned face is enough to calm his rabitting heart slightly, and he presses a shaking hand to his chest. Tony doesn’t even realize he’s gasping for breath until Steve is rubbing his back, murmuring in a soft apologetic voice barely audible over
The Thor thing was over a month ago, and sure Loki holds a mean grudge, but even he's not this petty. He would've retaliated long ago, if he was going to do so. Usually Loki’s revenge is swift and harsh, and then Loki forgives Tony and they move on.
“Unless you have a guest room I don’t know about, yes, Steve,” Tony says slowly, waking up a bit more. “Don’t be a blushing virgin now, you’ve slept over at mine several times now. You already know I snore but I won’t grope you in my sleep.”
“Her and—” Steve stops. “Oh.”
Howard had been very unhappy to find Tony worshipping his mother long past what he had deemed “an appropriate age,” and immediately dissuaded her from allowing Tony to spend so much time with her the moment he turned seven. Howard was worried he would grow up to be a sissy if he keeps letting his mother paint his toenails.
He flees, scrambling from his bed to get away from Natasha and runs for his lab. That's all he's ever good at. Running.
Steve’s brow is furrowed and his eyes haunted. Tony doesn’t expect anyone to take their own deaths lightly. It must be painful to hear all of this, and he wonders if he should continue when Steve nods, asking silently.
“Tomorrow,” she insists. “And tomorrow, you're also going to talk to Rhodey. He's been really worried about you, wondering why you haven't been answering either of our calls.”
“You never came back,” Steve whispers, his words sounding guilty like a confession.
“Are we making fun of Steve?” Sam Wilson asks with a wide grin as he drops his tray down next to Thor. “My favorite activity!”
There’s no reason for Tony to feel any way about seeing Steve with Peggy, and it’s certainly not his place to be upset or angry. He definitely has no right to feel as though he’s been kicked in the chest, his heart shattered from the force of the blow.
Tony.”
“That’s right,” Steve says. His tone turns serious when he adds, “Tony, I don’t know how the serum is going to affect my aging process. So far it hasn’t been anything extreme. It’s not like I look twenty-seven fresh out of the ice anymore and I will be there with you through all of the aging milestones, for the rest of our lives. We said til death do us part and I mean that. I will
Natasha disappears for a week and comes home with Clint. His presence is a happy surprise but wholly unexpected, and Tony has long since thought maybe—maybe he didn’t make it. But there he is cradled protectively in Natasha’s arms, looking for all the world like a different man. His once sharp eyes are shadowed and his clever mouth clenched shut. Heavy sorrow dogs his steps, and Clint walks like he’s lost the world.
Maybe especially now because he hates how
“Yes, a non-disclosure agreement,” Tony says mildly, tapping his pen against the tablet screen. “Absolutely no one else must know this relationship is not real. None of our friends, none of our families, none of our pets, I mean absolutely
for us, to give the world a fighting chance.”
,” Tony breathes, the realization barreling into him like a punch to the gut. He's not usually the last in the room to know something, and the realization that he's missed something as big as this because he's been blinded for so long is humbling. “You actually counted.”
“I’m going to prom with my fella,” Tony replies with a soft smile. “We’re goin’ steady.”
Tony gets his first clue from Loki and he should've had the foresight to leave school then. Leave and run as far away as possible and never come back.
“Not a word out of you, Rogers,” Tony growls as they finally step off the train somewhere deep in Brooklyn. Tony's legs are feeling just the slightest bit wobbly and he might or might not feel like he's going to throw up all over Steve's shoes any second now. Steve only smiles and holds out his hand for Tony to take as they climb the steps out of the station.
Tony laughs, the sound ugly and wet. “You don’t have to be nice to me just because I’m sad.”
“Unnecessary,” Tony repeats under his breath. “When I take over the world, I'm going to overhaul that facsimile of a viable infrastructure and make it actually functional.”
“I really like dinosaurs,” Tony blurts out, sounding way too eager to be talking about a pile of old bones, because apparently his intelligence is at an all time low when Steve is touching him in any way.
Tony briefly assesses his locker to see if he can fit inside of it (he cannot) and pretends to closely examine the contents, ignoring the call of his name. It's not until he feels a hand on his shoulder before he flinches and slams the door shut a little too loudly. The clang of metal echoes in the empty hallway. He doesn't want to turn.
your job to spoil him, so this is good so far. Because my best friend deserves the world, Steve, I'm sure you know that.”
The urge to cry swells up from deep in Tony's belly again and he wants so very badly to tell Pepper everything. He doesn't deserve the genuine joy he sees in her eyes as she smiles at him, doesn't deserve the happiness she feels for him thinking his farce is a real relationship. He swallows down the truth and forces a smile on his lips.
,” Tony moans as kisses trail down his jaw to his shoulder and further still to his wrist. Tony had never really given much thought to his hands as erogenous zones but he quickly realizes just how sensitive they are when Steve brushes soft little kisses along his knuckles and drags his lips along the calloused webbing between his fingers. He drops a final kiss to Tony's palm before coming up again to press his mouth against the column of Tony's neck.
Steve rejoins him in the parking lot after he showers and changes out of his gear and Tony can't resist running his fingers through Steve's still-damp hair as they settle into the backseat.
Distantly, he hears Rhodey clear his throat and begins the ceremony as their officiant. Tony is ashamed to say he hears none of Rhodey’s words. He only has eyes and ears for Steve who is staring back at him with the same expression of open joy, wondrous disbelief, and warm love. Eventually, he feels the subtle prod on his elbow as their audience chuckles. That’s his cue.
Of course the song that I ended up stuck was out of complete randomness (even if Bruce insists that it was chosen ‘cause it strongly relates to how I was feeling at the moment)
He looks at me, unimpressed, as he takes out the bandages from the first aid. Cradling my hand gently, he disinfects the wound and wraps it up. Steve's hand is warm to the touch, somehow it makes the silence more… comforting.
“In my time, things weren't so… easy, people weren't so accepting. I had to fight tooth and nail just to survive. Until the war I only really had Bucky. Then the war came, I meet Peggy and she was the first and last women I ever loved romantically.” Steve shifts his head robotically to the side.
It started maybe an hour (give or take) into fucking around with the ‘bouncy boom-boom' arrows that Clint (that shithead, disrespecting my craft) had asked for when the Avengers alarm went off and with Cap being a no show, that left the remaining Avengers to be sent out to deal with the villain of the week. If only it were that simple.
Steve puts his finger on my lips, “If you told me that a week ago, I probably have punched you but I- I've done some soul searching.”
Again, the sincerity of his words shocks me to my soul. “Steve, don't put so much blame on yourself.”
“Do you really lo-like me?” blue eyes pierce my soul, warmer than his hand.
“Oh… yeah. So, I heard about how the attack went down in Times Square,” Steve's eyes make a valiant effort to avoid mine, “And I… thought you might need to talk. Umm, yeah?”
“Well, maybe!" he stops in his tracks, slightly delirious, “Maybe if you weren't such amazing person in the first place, I wouldn't have fallen in love with you!” slamming my fist onto my table… hitting the cup of coffee, shattering it.
The moment stretches longer then it really should, the cracked glass litters the floor while hot coffee stains the papers scattered about, the smell strong. “Shit,” The pain from the glass puncturing my skin finally registers in my mind; I start laughing.
“But then I woke up in a new century, all I knew was gone. Then I meet you,” he looks at me straight on, “And I think…” he takes a deep breath, “I love you too,” His skin going noticeably red.
“Steve, it's okay if you're uncomfortable. We can just be fri- "
“And maybe if I had been ther-.” Anger reaching his voice, though I don’t think it’s for me, for once.
“What’s there to talk about!?” I immediately regret how harsh I come off, far too protective of myself, “Nothing happened, period,” I managed to subdue to my tone a bit.
“Look, it’s just been a really long day, I’ve have been forced to accept some really deeply buried emotions and out in front of literally the whole world and-" Steve starts to turn his body back to me, “It hasn’t been the greatest. So, I’m sorry I blew up at you like that.”
, villain had a
“Yeah, I see. Thanks,” A warm smile working itself onto my face, his shoulders loosing up a bit in return.
exciting topics. God, Bruce was such a gossip).
bit biased ‘cause I may have been hit with it and it's whole reason I’m in this situation but still!
“So-" he cuts me off, only to realize, with a slight grimace, what he did.
“Tony-"
“No-" Steve tries.
Except our,
fears of rejection in
That’s why I’m currently sitting in the corner of the workshop on total lockdown, no access (not even Pepper or Rhodey), contemplating the life choices that have led me down this road. And nothing would convince me to move out of this humid as shit room (certainly not a certain super soldier). Just me, myself and I, alone with my thoughts, and well managing to
“You said it out loud.”
The pure sincerity behind the words is really what shocks me. So, I risk it, quickly raising my head to catch a glimpse of his sky-blue eyes… only to have that glimpse quickly turn into a stare. “Umm… wha-” I articulate gracefully.
“You go first!” he attempts to recover, if a bit loud.
Now that I’ve got that out my system I can continue. Anyway, so once breakfast was done Steve went on his daily morning run, which was late (again odd but, yeah, I don’t have an excuse) and I headed down to the workshop to work on some arrow upgrades for Barton. I guess you could call that the metaphorical calm before the storm.
“So, is that all you’re here for?” I follow up on my previous statement, a slight tinge of cold anticipation shots through my body also I lean towards him in my chair.
“Just please, if you really want to blame someone, blame the actual villain and get that self-righteous bullshit out of your head.” I stand, leveling myself to him.
As after our little moment of ‘normalcy’ everything went to shit.
“Most of my life I was ostracized for being different, I was skinny, I was asthmatic, I was Irish, I was an orphan. No matter what, people found some way to hurt me. Eventually I let it get to me. Even though I tried so hard to be happy with myself, I hated myself because I was different. Managed to Believe I was, what do they say today, a hundred percent straight,” he develops a blush, gripping my hand tightly.
“No, you're right, I should have been there,” Steve says, oddly confident, “I left you guys all alone and you ended up paying the price.”
Okay, so maybe I have done stuff which could be comparable to that, but this is taking a bit too fucking far! Maybe I’m a
“Just don’t go!” I manage.
Remembering that we have a respiratory system, we finally break apart. Surrounded by broken glass, coffee stained plans that I will no doubt have to redraw, blood stained bandages, while looking into his hopeful eyes. His perfect, lighter than a blueberry, eyes, his hand in mine. My hand screaming in pain. There wasn't a more perfect moment in my life.
grown ass man!
‘I Won't Say I’m in Love', with the present Avengers (Dressed in white robes, due to some bullshit pseudo-magic/science. I swear I’ve had enough of magic to last me a lifetime) acting as the muses.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, tensing, as he turns around, heading to the door.
So, I’ve kinda kept it a secret, not like I’ve really been in any long-term relationships (other than Pepper and that didn’t end well), just a couple one-night stands with some randos in college. Sure, there were rumors (there’s
“Shit,” Immediately he rushes over to the first aid kit over by the door, while simultaneously agreeing with my earlier comment.
“Well, when you’ve locked yourself down here for several hours that it becomes a danger to your health?” his hand stroking my sore back, rubbing away the aches of being in the same position for hours, “
I’ll never admit it but while I was bursting out in full musically number, just for a moment, everything was… right. And maybe falling into the arms of that memorial statue of Steve made my heart flatter. It was, for lack of a better term, fun and seeing Hulk wearing a white robe while he gracefully shouted, “When you going to own up that you’ve got, got, got it bad!” while the others cheered him on will probably be the best thing I will ever see (and best blackmail ever).
“You sure?” I nod my head swiftly reply, “Okay… well, I brought you some coffee and a sandwich, Shellhead,” He points toward the cup and plate next to me, his tone sounding a bit unsure of itself.
“Wait!” I say, “I didn’t mean to- well I did but, God!” Why did this have to be so goddamned difficult, I’ve literally spent all this time processing this shit so why can't I communicate it!?
God, you know it’s always like this. I can't have one normal goddamned day. For once I thought it was seemingly normal day when it started (as normal as a day for the Avengers could get), I woke up, ate breakfast Steve (was there something the man wasn’t good at?) had made, watched Clint and Thor fight over the last Poptart (the god obviously winning, Legolas stood no chance. Serves him right that little shit) and discussed the mechanics of there being alternate universes with Bruce (and other
. Who the fuck just thinks, “Oh let me just use all this potential genius, not to make something of actual value or use but instead just to fuck with people?
Faster than I realize, a quick burst of anger rushes through me, “Yeah! And where were you Mr No-Show!” my voice harsh, unrepentant.
You see, a normal day! Well… except Nat was out on a mission but other than that all was normal. I mean, I guess Steve was acting a bit off but who doesn’t occasionally have a odd morning, right? I guess I was too busy
The laughter is what seems to finally break the tension in Steve. “Ar- are you okay?” If I was a bit more delirious from the pain, I might've missed the slight bit of humor in his tone.
That's really all the initiative I need. Taking his hand off my lips I close the distance between us.
Tony feels like throat closing in one part panic, and two parts fear. “No, I don't,” he lies. “What you see is what you get.”
“Steve,” Tony says, feeling a little bit irritated himself. “You refused my nice comfortable car and driver so we can take the subway? Why?”
Tony can feel his heart squeezing tight in his chest when Steve holds up a blown glass bauble and asks if Tony thinks Nebula would like it, and he can’t help the warm feeling that gushes up from his belly and fills his chest. His face aches from smiling so much and he gently plucks the glass dolphin from Steve’s hand to pull him in for a soft kiss, uncaring of the people surrounding them and the paparazzo across the street who had been tailing them all day.
“Tony!” Steve cries out after him, but Tony ignores him, walking faster. He bursts out of the school doors and all but runs towards where Happy is parked, desperate for a quick escape. Happy is waving cheerfully at him before he sees the expression on Tony’s face, and he immediately switches to protective mode, moving around the car to get the door open.
“Rogers—”
We sat like that a moment, hands touching. He grinned.
Thankfully, Howard is away on a business trip and Tony only has his mother to contend with, and true to form, Happy, the traitor hands the note directly to her. Maria scans the little post-it quickly and looks at Tony with soft sad eyes.
Tony’s words die on his tongue as he turns around to the vision of Steve as he steps out of their bathroom in a cloud of billowing steam. He drags his eyes along the very tall and very broad length of his husband, savoring the sight of a smiling half-ready Steve that knocks the breath from his lungs.
Tony wonders. Steve deserves to be happy, that much he knows, because Steve has only ever been good and righteous and strong. But Tony himself has done more than his fair share of harm, and he doesn’t know if he deserves to ever be absolved of the guilt and pain and the weight of his own consequences. He sighs and raises his arm, palm upturned.
Tony shakes his head and he presses his fingers against his mouth until his lips stop trembling. “He doesn't, J. He probably never did. I was just a means to an end, and I have no right to be upset about this. I agreed to it.
“How's that?” Steve's voice is a deep bass rumble that Tony can feel beneath his cheek.
Tony leans his head on Pepper’s shoulder and refuses to stand as their team is announced. Pepper takes one of his hands in hers and squeezes softly.
Tony's smile widens and the butterflies settle a little more. “Wow, a twelve. Thank you, offspring. You can keep your inheritance after all,” he says, pulling Morgan in for a loud smacking kiss as she protests loudly about him messing up his newly applied lip gloss.
“As I was telling you,” Rhodey is saying to Steve where they're chatting on the couch, cups of hot cocoa in hand, “Tones is delicate.”
For a tense moment, it looks like the ball might not make it all the way to the end of the field, the opposing team players leap trying to catch it but it flies through their fingers, until finally,
“Hey, are you free this weekend?” Steve asks suddenly on one such day. It’s a perfect late October afternoon, warm for so late in the year, sunny and golden crisp.
Rhodey is laughing as the first trickle of tears begin to track down his face. “No, Tony, you can’t buy MIT. I’ll see you soon.” He smiles through his tears as he begins to walk away.
By the time playoffs roll around, everyone is abuzz with excitement and the halls are decked in blue and red. The whole student body always attends the first finals game. It's just one of those things and even Tony isn't immune to such a stupid tradition, not when Loki is dragging him bodily along.
“How’s your morning now?” Steve asks, a lazy sated smile adorning his face.
“It's also part of my job as your best friend and big brother,” Rhodey says, ignoring him, and Tony does
Tony can’t help the quiet laugh that escapes. He holds up the two halves of the Cartier in his hand and the little gold screwdriver alongside them. “Help,” Tony pouts.
“So then why did you let me believe it was fake?” Tony demands. “Why did you let me think it was only to make Peggy jealous?”
“If I were your husband, I would treat you the way you deserve,” Steve says, his grin wide now.
“Hi mom,” Steve says, his voice flat with dread.
“I think,” Loki says slowly, his tone spelling trouble, “you're just trying to impress Steve.”
“Are you sure this will work?” Nebula asks, looking concerned and dubious. Her eyes flicker to the fuel readout on the dash, dangerously low flashing reds.
Tony rolls his eyes and tugs Loki forward for a hug. Loki sighs dramatically before wrapping long arms around him. “Of course,” Tony says. “I'm obviously still in love with you. Always will be.”
“Then I got that letter, and I got too hopeful, thinking I had a chance,” Steve says on the next breath, sounding as though he desperately needs to blurt everything out, “but I was too late already because you don’t feel that way anymore. And then we started—doing all of
Tony wasn't sure whether the tone he had heard in Barnes’s voice was simply shock or if there was a hint of disdain as well, but he figured at the time it was far too early in the game to antagonize Steve's best friend. He had supposed Barnes wasn’t one for Twitter, or he would’ve seen the photos of their relationship by now.
Thank you to everyone who’s stuck by this fic and gave it a chance! Here are a couple of little trivia things I can share now that the fic is done:
“Pepper told me they would help smooth out the line of my pants.”
who jogs up to them with wild disbelieving hope in his eyes and tears shining on his cheeks highlighted by the wane moonlight above.
“Forever,” Tony echoes, surprised at the rush of relief that floods him. He knows Steve loves him, but standing here now, words to describe the emotions he’s feeling escape him, but all of them are warm and
like the tone of his voice at all, “to tell Steve how glad I am you're both finally together. Anyways, Steve, did you know Tony has had a crush on you since—”
tonight, not if Tony has anything to say about it.
“Jealous, Barnes?” Tony teases.
“Are you calling me old?” Steve squawks indignantly.
Tony would've found it severely annoying had he not been swept up in the excitement too. He attends all of Steve's practices, sometimes with Loki and Nat for company, but more often than not alone. It's getting far too cold to sit outside for long periods of time, but like hell Tony is going to miss any of the free shows.
Tony shrugs, feeling his pout curve upwards into a grin. “We’ll see,” he jokes. “He's brand new. I’m still giving him a trial run.”
“Wow, you really didn’t know,” Tony mutters. “We’re both so fucking stupid.” Steve makes a noise like he's about to protest but Tony gathers his nerves, steps closer to Steve and shuts him up by kissing him.
“We’ve suffered enough,” Steve says. “We deserve this. We deserve to be happy, even if it’s for a second in between everything else.”
Steve looks startled. “That's not—”
The sun is setting by the time they make it back to their hotel. They watch the last of its descent from their balcony overlooking the Aegean Sea as the sun sinks behind the cliffs on the horizon, coloring the whitewashed stone walls and blue domed roofs around them pink and purple. The last rays shine bright across the foam capped waves crashing below them as the last light disappears and stars begin to dot the sky. High above them, constellations that inspired astronomers and wrote myths sparkle against a velvet black sky. Tony cannot think of any place he would rather be than here with Steve’s arms wrapped around him and his belly full of good food and sweet coffee.
His heart was hammering in his chest.
Steve frowned. This was a curious reaction to a simple drawing. His artistic skills weren‘t
The last picture was harmless in comparison. They were both much older in this one, their faces lined and Tony‘s hair going decidedly grey (so was Steve‘s, probably, but it wasn‘t like you could tell in a black and white drawing). Sitting at a breakfast table, a gently sloping countryside just visible in through the window behind them, Tony was reaching over with a fork to steal some scrambled eggs from Steve‘s plate.
A man who had never entered an engineer‘s workshop might not have recognized these words as „come in“. Steve was not such a man. Sure enough, the first thing he saw when he opened the door and entered was Tony kneeling on the floor next to an upright Iron Man armor with nails in his mouth and a hammer in his hands.
Tony hummed and sat down on the couch next to him, setting down the plate with the other half of his sandwich on the coffee table.
His feet had carried him along his usual track into Central Park without his conscious thought. Now that his heart had slowed to a more regular rhythm, running didn‘t seem so important anymore. The anxiety, no longer a jittery restlessness, suddenly felt like a leaden weight on him instead. He slumped down on a park bench, wondering where he had ever found the energy to run at all.
He slowed.
Tony‘s smile was dazzling, if a little embarrassed. „Thank you!“ He looked back down at the sketchpad and something in his face softened. „Thanks,“ he repeated quietly. „Wow.“ He delicately pried the top page away from the rest of the pad, which he set down on the table without looking, his eyes and smile still fixed on the piece of paper in his hand.
But if it had been just that, why would Tony be so obviously embarrassed about it?
Friends kept pictures of each other. Heck, he still had a picture of Bucky on his wall.
It was time to take a risk.
Several heartbeats passed in silence as Tony stared at the sketch and Steve‘s tactical mind was running through possible scenarios and possible responses to them.
an Iron Man armor would constitute a capital offense to Tony.
His stomach plummeted. Trying to read Tony‘s face was making him more nervous than Panther tanks ever had. „Uh, well. I was thinking about the drawing I gave you the other day. You know. The one of the two of us.“
„Give it back,“ Steve said, slightly desperately. He was vividly reminded of his youth, when the bullies at school had taken one of his comic books, or a marble, or an apple, or whatever else he happened to be treasuring that day.
Tony shrugged and took another bite. „I skipped school, mom. Too boring if you know all of it already. What are you drawing?“
The next picture was of them fighting back to back. Steve was swinging his shield upward to knock out a masked Hydra goon, his teeth gritted with the exertion. Facing away from him, Iron Man fired a repulsor ray from his left gauntlet.
The next sketch had them sitting in a café of sorts, across from each other at a small round table. Two identical tall glasses of milkshakes between them, they were sucking their drinks through identical straws. Steve‘s hand was lightly touching Iron Man‘s gauntlet as he smiled at the impassive faceplate.
„All right,“ Tony said slowly.
He fled.
But nope, it was a message from Tony.
The question caused a minor heart attack. Steve had been so engrossed in his sketchpad and the accompanying daydreams that he hadn‘t heard the footsteps until Tony was already in the room and mere feet away from him.
he told himself firmly.
Steve blinked. That was a terribly loaded question. „Um.“
„What are you drawing?“
But if so, why then would he be so intent on keeping the drawing for himself?
„It‘s okay,“ Steve said, trying to discreetly tilt the pad further towards himself to make sure his drawing wasn‘t visible, „I should have heard you coming. I guess I was lost in thought.“
He could picture him raising his dark eyebrows at the first couple of drawings and then letting his jaw drop at the last ones. He would be shocked.
„Since you‘ve been talking about nothing else for a week,“ Steve retorted easily.
Maybe it wasn‘t even too late yet? Maybe he could run home, burst into Tony‘s workshop and take the sketches back before Tony even got a look at them? The trouble was that with this dead weight pressing down on him,
“ He lunged across the couch so quickly that even superhuman reflexes were too slow. By the time Steve was aware of what had happened, Tony had already snatched the thing and jumped up from the couch with a triumphant grin.
, I consider that an emergency.”
thinking about the possibility of alternate universes (dammit Brucie, you had one job) to have noticed, yep, no other reason. (I swear he gets that much more gorgeous every time I look at him).
“Language, Cap.”
And when sung by a man, sounds very much like someone deep in the closet. And well the thing is, as much as I’m out to my friends, I’m not out to the public. Like
“Look Tony,” Steve says, standing his ground, like a firm, gentle giant. “I know this whole situation kinda, for lack of a better word, crappy with the whol-"
“Damnit Stev- “
“Those codes are for emergencies only; you do realize that?” my voice finally breaking the silence.
Hearing the sounds of a door opening or footsteps approaching me should have probably alerted me immediately, but of course at this point I’ve kinda been in the workshop for several hours (stopped bothering to count after being down here six hours) so exhaustion had its foul clutches on me. Maybe even after the sound of a cup being placed next to me. Only after feeling the large, encompassing hand covers my back do I finally make come to three conclusions:
would have ever allowed his only son (and heir to the only thing he actually loved) to be openly gay, hell, he'd rather his son be a child alcoholic than gay. Sure, the man is… dead but I guess I never really got over his whole… him.
There are no fireworks or burst of heat. No soaring guitar solos or backup singers to sigh hopefully, just Steve and me in the moment. Steve and his passionate personality, unwavering goodness that, once upon a time, helped end a war. Steve, who lost everything he cared about, who seemed to have fallen in love with me, the beautiful bastard. Steve, a stubborn idiot who didn't know when to stop for his own good, who I'd fallen in love with. We stay like this for a while.
