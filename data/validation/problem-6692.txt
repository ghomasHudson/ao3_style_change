His face has been on the cover of every mag, every news brief, every advertisement for augments. He is
if he’d intended to break up with him, right? He leads Steve into the penthouse suite, through the kitchen to the living room. He grabs a couple of fancy microbrew beers Rhodey had brought him on the way and they sit down together on the couch.
It’s over in an instant. Tony looks away, eyes down on the floor, his whole body tensing, and Steve realizes this had been another moment. Not just a
Then there’s something slick and hard at his hole, and Tony is pushing his cock in, slow and steady, until he’s pushing in and the head breaches him, and Tony is thrusting shallowly, just the head of his cock pressing in and out of Steve’s hole, and it’s maddening, teasing.
“Have some,” Tony says, lifting a heavy hand and waving it somewhere in the vicinity of the chocolate in Steve’s hands. Steve blanches.
"Thought about fucking you all day," Tony says, the words broken and choppy as he fucks hard and fast. Steve cries out, already so close he can barely stand it. "Thought about how needy you'd get, looking at all my pictures. Can't – oh, fuck, honey, you're so tight – can't last long like this, can you, baby? Me either, muffin – you go ahead and come when you're ready, okay?"
The first thing he’d seen when he’d woken up had been Rogers’ smile, but he doesn’t tell Pepper that. He also doesn’t tell her that his first thought the next time he’d had a medical emergency had been of that smile.
“The dildo,” Tony says, pushing it in, pulling his fingers out and brushing them along the stretched, puffy rim, “until you come again, or the dildo and my cock until you come?”
Of course, after the passage of so much time his skin is vibrating with need, with the tension of discomfort and imbalance. He hasn’t gone down into subspace for nearly a year – it’s difficult to find a dom who’s able to adhere to an NDA
His opportunity to broach the subject of his feelings – and Tony’s avoidance of them – comes as a surprise.
The corner of Steve’s mouth quirks up just a tic, and Tony recognizes that as Steve’s ‘I’m humouring the crazy person, let’s see where this goes’ expression. “It’s Christmas Eve.”
Steve pauses for another moment, as though giving Tony time to voice any objections. “I’ve read your intake paperwork, I know your limits,” Steve says. His voice seems to drop an octave. “I know how hard it must be for you. To be here. But I’ll take care of you, Tony.”
Tony starts slow, up near Steve’s tense shoulders. He watches raptly as Steve’s skin starts to redden, lines starting to raise right away as Tony’s wrist flicks the leather tails across his skin. He keeps up a steady rhythm, moving his arm around to make sure he’s warming up the skin on all of Steve’s back. Steve is panting, not quite ready to cry out yet, but that’s okay. Tony’s just starting.
“We’ll start slow,” Steve tells him, holding up the dildo. “Lay your head down, so you don’t hurt your neck.”
“I thought my life was weird enough,” Tony says, sounding a little hysterical. “I’m trapped in 1970 working with my own father, that should have been the top of the weirdness scale.”
“Open your mouth, sweetheart,” Steve murmurs, a finger caressing Tony’s jaw as his other hand cards through Tony’s hair to hold his head up carefully. “Open your mouth, but don’t suck. Just let it happen. You’ve been so good for me, you don’t have to do anything more, okay? Just feel me, let me do this.”
They don’t worry about the apartment, about the meager possessions they’d bought, or about the fake IDs or their jobs. They stop long enough for Steve to shave and collect the tesseract, and then they suit up in the protective suits Tony had designed, putting the vials of Pym particles in their proper compartments.
Steve licks at him for long minutes, until Tony is wet with saliva, his muscles loose and trembling.
Steve shifts onto his knees, manhandles Tony’s body again until he’s rolled onto his side, and then scoots closer to Tony’s head, bringing it into his lap gently.
“We have team Christmas dinner tonight,” Steve tells him, looking ludicrous with his hands still up in front of him and speaking slowly as though Tony is a very small, very confused child. “As a matter of fact, I’m pretty sure that’s actually
Tony grins, and it’s devilish, then straps the collar around Steve’s neck. It’s not tight – Tony can fit his whole hand in between the fabric and Steve’s throat, and it still doesn’t feel tight, so it’s good. Then Tony uncuffs Steve’s right wrist, putting it into one of the collar’s cuffs immediately. He does the same with Steve’s left wrist, then pulls a rope with a D-ring from the centre of the headboard, and attaches it to the ring on the collar strap.
Tony pushes forward again, and takes hold of his cock to tug it up, giving Steve his balls. Steve moans and licks, sucking one into his warm mouth before releasing it and moving to the other, tonguing and kissing and moaning against the sensitive flesh. Tony slides his fist loosely over his cock a few times, just because it feels good and Steve is so gorgeous.
Steve reluctantly relinquishes his grip on Stark’s cock and pulls his fingers free, then steps around the massage table to the end table. He opens the top drawer, gratified to immediately find a box of Trojans. They’re a little on the small side for him, usually, but he can make do. He tears open the box, pulls out a foil packet, and steps back to the table.
“I love you like this,” Tony says, keeping that crooning note in his voice. They’d tried it other ways, before – Tony had called Steve a slut, a whore. They’d done the humiliation thing, the ‘mean dom’ thing, and it hadn’t sat right with either of them.
Steve is like a furnace around him, hot and tight. Tony’s cock throbs, and he swears he can feel the pounding of Steve’s heart – of both their hearts – at the sensitive tip.
Steve’s hand squeezes the bulb at the same time his other hand squeezes the head of Tony’s cock, twice in quick succession, and Tony groans loudly at the stretch inside him.
A whole-body shiver goes through Steve, his eyelashes fluttering a little – though he doesn’t break away from Tony’s gaze. He knows better than that.
Steve walks into the boardroom with his back straight and his shoulders back. It's not his first meeting with the World Security Council – these days it seems like he's having to talk to them every couple of weeks.
Tony lifts himself off Steve’s legs, turns, and wraps cuffs around Steve’s ankles. It’s only when Tony is finished, coming back up to place his mouth over Steve’s, that Steve realizes Tony had tied his legs down straight. He can bend his knees up a little, there’s enough slack for that, but he can’t spread his legs, and he doesn’t know how that’s going to work.
It’s only days later when Pym cracks the particle. It takes Steve and Tony a day to work out a plan to get them out of the lab – security is a little better since the
Steve resumes fucking him, rocking and grinding his cock deep into Tony’s body, and then he reaches down and hits the quick release on the cock ring and wraps his big, warm hand around Tony’s cock. He jerks him off hard and fast with the rhythm of his thrusts, and Tony howls, crying out and trembling. His whole body jerks wildly as he comes, clenching and spasming around Steve’s thick cock as he fucks him, and Steve can’t hold on anymore, not when Tony is so good and tight and easy for him, and he grinds in deep as he can, yelling in triumph as he comes deep in Tony’s body, filling him, spurting again and again.
Clint glances at him from the side, and stares for a long moment. “Yeah, okay. Completely oblivious.”
Tony’s brain runs a mile a minute, coming up with excuses. He has a million things to do in the workshop, there are repairs to make on the armour, there’s paperwork to sign.
Tony makes his way through that one, finding himself face to face with a woman seated at a desk. She has bouncy blonde hair, styled in waves, and she’s smiling kindly up at him.
Steve moans, coming again already, head thrown back in ecstasy as Tony fills him. They’re writhing together, shuddering and crying out as they’re both overtaken by pleasure. Steve is grinding his hips down again, and Tony is grinding up into Steve’s body, until they’re both wrung out and gasping for air, When it’s over, Steve slumps over Tony’s chest, panting and sweaty. His cock is softening, his whole body wracked with aftershocks as he comes down from his orgasm. Tony reaches up clumsily, petting a shaky hand down Steve’s back a few times, gulping in air and trying to remember his own name.
“I’m sorry, Tony,” he says one day. They’re watching a rerun of The Brady Bunch, and while neither of them is really paying attention, Tony has a half-smile on his face every time Cindy Brady has a speaking line. Steve is sure he’s thinking about Morgan.
“Tony, don’t go,” Steve says, and he stares into Tony’s eyes for a long moment. Fear, humiliation, and there, a flicker of hope.
He winks. “Thought you might want to take a shot at America’s Ass,” he grins. He can feel his cheeks flushing, but he keeps the grin in place.
There are viewing areas outside each section of the room, setting them up like little amphitheatres. He can’t see past the first one, but once his eyes focus on what he’s seeing, his brain short circuits and he can’t think past the first wall anyway.
A slow smile spreads across Tony’s face. “Don’t worry, honey,” he says. “That’s the plan. Lie on your back on the bed. I promise, it’ll be so good.”
Tony whines again, pulling against the rope. Steve flips to a new page in his sketchbook and starts drawing again, head tilted to the side as he examines Tony’s body. Tony shivers a little; being on display like this, like a fucking fruit bowl Steve is trying to draw, is pulling at the thread of desire low in his belly. He
Having control of the blowjob makes Steve heady with power, but it’s balanced by the fact that he can’t really move, his limbs tied together, holding him where Tony had placed him.
“Please,” Tony says. “They gave it to you to give to me, right?” He puts a hand up to hold Steve’s wrist as Steve tries to press another small square against his lips. “So I can do with it as I like. And what I’d like is to give it to you.”
“Don’t move,” Steve says, voice low and commanding. Tony knows what’s coming, but he still startles a little when Steve uses his big hands to spread Tony’s cheeks, then begins gently lapping at Tony’s hole with his tongue.
“You might have come, Tony, but you’re going all the way down for me tonight,” Steve murmurs against the inside of Tony’s damp calf. “Now, when you’re ready, one more to go.”
When the SHIELD employee contingent of the Avengers comes back, they’re a little beat up. Natasha has a big old shiner, and Clint is limping, but Steve looks none the worse for wear. He’s quiet, though, heading straight up to his rooms without much more than an absent wave.
When Steve has him on his back, he presses Tony’s hands back up and secures his wrists to the table’s attachments again, then pulls out a leather strap.
Steve pulls away, then leans in and brushes a gentle kiss across the edge of Tony’s jaw, brushing against his goatee. “I won’t tie you down again, then,” Steve says, keeping his voice low. “Not tonight. If this is going to work, if we’re going to bring you all the way down, you need to be able to trust me.”
, just wants Tony to know, that after everything that’s happened, everything Tony has taught him about himself, that’s what’s left – Steve’s love for Tony.
Tony’s cock is hard and straining, so close to Steve’s hole, and Tony stops resisting; he pulls the dildo out, then presses his own cock forward into the blazing heat. Steve moans at the difference, at hot, hard flesh inside him instead of the toy, but Tony only fucks into him a couple of times before he grits his teeth and pulls out, shoving the dildo in and using it to fuck Steve again. He only lasts a few thrusts, though, before he needs to feel the tight heat of Steve’s body again, and pulls the toy out and replaces it with his cock for another few moments.
“Shh, okay, I got you,” Tony says, pressing those two fingers in slowly, slowly, all the way in. He twists his wrist a little, and then the pads of his fingers are pressing against Steve’s prostate, rubbing and pressing and teasing as he slides his fingers in and out.
Steve slicks the dildo up before gently, slowly pushing it inside Tony’s body. It’s longer than the glass one had been, longer than Steve’s fingers, and Steve pushes it all the way until the slightly narrower bell-shaped end is caught on Tony’s rim. The dildo won’t slide out easily, and Steve now has his hands free while the toy stays in Tony’s body.
Steve isn’t completely unaffected — he’d fucked Tony’s mouth fast and hard, earlier, and Tony had been able to look up at him, at the way his cheeks were pink and his eyes were dark.
His perfect, round bubble butt is right in front of Steve’s face, and he gives in to the urge to lift his head and bite at the fleshy globe, chest warming at the laughing yelp from above him.
"Love you, too," Steve mumbles into Tony's skin, staring at the cool blue light of the arc reactor in his chest.
Tony wonders idly what Steve could have done, and decides he doesn’t care. The Dom had been kind to him. More than kind. Steve had made him feel special and beautiful, and had brought him down into a subspace so deep he thought he’d be there forever.
Steve laughs into his mouth, then pulls back and gets up onto his knees, straddling one of Tony’s thighs. He pulls his shirt up over his head, tossing it off the bed, and Tony grins up at him. “Nice,” he says.
Steve lays the toy down beside them, takes hold of Tony’s leg and gently lays it down on the bed, slides out from under Tony’s hips and reaches up to gently tease Tony’s fingers from around the wrought iron bars at the head of the bed. He pulls Tony’s hands up and brushes kisses across Tony’s knuckles, and Tony is floating dreamily, the deepest he’s been in years, but not all the way down. It’s comfortable, though, soothing, and if this is as far as he gets it could be enough.
Steve is heavy, a wall of solid muscle atop him, but the pressure is grounding. His entire back is warm from Steve’s hot skin, and he can feel Steve’s partial erection in the crease of his ass, but Steve doesn’t move. He simply lays there on Tony’s body, breathing slowly and deeply.
Tony floats in subspace for a long while, completely trusting in Steve’s arms. Steve pets him and holds him, letting them both bask in the feeling of it, of Tony’s surrender, of Steve’s power and strength.
Without thinking too hard about it, and shoving down any trepidation he might have, he reaches up and loops his finger around the elastic strap and tugs the mask off his face.
He forces himself still, and he’s rewarded with Tony taking his hand away to dip his fingers in the jar of vaseline.
Steve groans, but it chokes off into a low laugh as Jarvis does as requested. The slideshow of filthy sexual poses, of Tony in panties, appears on the ceiling again. Each picture is only up for a few seconds, but it's enough to rekindle Steve's arousal.
He begins to lick and suck and kiss in earnest, then, letting his mouth do as it will. When Tony’s hole is slick and wet from his mouth, he starts pushing at the opening with his tongue. He darts his tongue in and out, in and out, over and over again as he licks and sucks at Tony’s rim, until Tony’s muscles have loosened, and then he starts working even harder, pushing his tongue in as deep as he can make it go.
Steve’s heart beats hard in his chest. The mischievous grin on Tony’s face makes him want to kiss it from the man’s face, to crush his lips over Tony’s and kiss him until they’re both out of breath.
“Well, sure,” Tony says with a grin. It doesn’t quite reach his eyes, though. “We’ve got all the time in the world.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, glancing around guiltily. The small waiting room is empty, but he’s still paranoid. “Tony Stark.”
As though he can tell, and as though he’d been waiting for it, Steve slides down Tony’s body, down the table, spreads Tony’s legs and lays on his stomach between them.
Steve knows better than to suck before he’s told, so he just stays where he is, mouth open and wet and warm, as Tony slides his dick over the slightly rough texture of his tongue. Steve looks up through his eyelashes, doing his best to look up at Tony’s face the way he knows Tony likes.
“Do you want to be on top for a while?” Tony asks him, still thrusting in alongside the dildo. “You can take what you need?”
Steve just grins at him and rolls onto his back, dragging Tony along with him for a cuddle. “Save it for morning. We’ll see if we can’t break that record again.”
Steve snorts a half-laugh. “I’ve got leftover takeout in my fridge at the Tower. We can eat it after.”
, and Steve is crying, really struggling now, gasping “green, green, green, please, green,” so Tony drops the crop, reaches for the lube and squirts it viciously over Steve’s hole. He squirts it on his cock, the cold temperature shocking him but making him needy at the same time, and he shoves a finger in Steve’s hole to work the lube in. He’s tight and hot like a furnace, but there’s no real resistance, so Tony works the lube over himself and then lines his cock up and presses in.
) and keeps rubbing his prostate, and Steve’s throat vibrates as he cries out his orgasm and it pushes Tony over the edge.
He’s very tall. His chest is broad, shoulders huge, and his waist tapers into a neat little V. His feet are bare, and Tony finds himself staring at the pale, slightly crooked toes for a moment before his gaze travels back up the man’s body. His lips are plush and pink, his jaw strong, and his hair a dirty blonde.
Tony’s mind was in emergency mode. He actually had fantasied about asking him several times, but he never had the courage to actually act on his feelings. Steve was always so hard to read, and honestly, way too harsh when he rejected something. Tony had never seen him reject someone romantically, but he was so afraid of humiliation that he had buried his desire. But now? It was all out in the open. Posted on public for everyone to see. It felt good, actually. For Steve to make a show out of it.
“And what are you going to do about it?” asked a masculine voice from the other corner of the room. Startled, Tony turned to it.
Afraid he’d lose a finger (or something worse) in the process, Tony tried to gently wake up Nebula. She jumped in her seat like she had been poked in the ass with a needle, and in less than two seconds she had the tip of her sword pinching his throat.
“You feel like your legacy will fade into oblivion.” It wasn’t a question. “What are you going to do about it?”
She seemed charged with fury. "What are you going to do, pick them up with a shovel and a broom? There’s nothing left.”
Of course, they were the illusions of a child. He would never see them again, but not by his own choice.
After two more corner turns, Tony found their ship. He quickly entered the hangar and parked next to the ship, that was very evidently not finished in repairs. Still, it looked in better shape than it was when they had arrived. He ran to the landing ramp and Nebula followed him, still euphorically high. The creatures of the shop were screaming at them from the bottom, but Tony didn't care. He ran to the cockpit and sat on the pilot seat, concentrated on getting them the fuck out of that shithole. He screamed at Nebula to get on the laser cannons and start shooting back at the bastardas that were wrecking the ship, one blast at the time, but she didn’t listen. She stood in front of the main computer’s terminal and established a course for who knew where. Tony focused his attention on getting them on the air, but the engines were taking fire. They had to run, fast.
Nebula sat at the bar and ordered a glass of something thick and acid. She gestured him to the back of the room where the door to the restrooms were. Tony resigned himself to his fate and went to the nasty alien bathroom.
“I'm in position,” said Stark from the comms. “I see the leak. It's going to take a while to fix, maybe ten minutes.”
Tony started checking the answers. People were going crazy, answering with insults and laughter, but the vast majority were supporting Steve in his mission to fight homophobes.
Another bizarre thing to scratch from the bucket list, apparently. His life, man. It was ridiculous.
Tony didn’t care if she had a hangover, was sleepy, or generally irritated at the universe. They had a situation to attend.
Tony tried a small smile. “Oh, right. My eyes can't perceive wavelengths of such low energy, but I know of it. I just can't see it.”
“Your welcome, by the way.” He observed around the pile of bodies. “You seemed pretty helpless without me.”
He wandered around the facility, his mind lost. He felt like a wandering star, burning too brightly, consuming itself. Steve was a man of simple principles, and every single of them had failed him. His entire belief system had been burned to the ground. And he was too exhausted to pick up the ashes.
Nobody was paying attention to the alley where Nebula easily and quickly got rid of her attackers one by one with her swords. Tony watched in awe as she ducked their pathetic attempst at catching her, and cut their kneecaps, thoats and arms off their bodies with fluid movements.
“You need to do something about this, Tony. You’re going to die,” protested Thor while Tony was busy vomiting the bile from his empty stomach for the third time that day.
Without a second to hesitate, Tony shoot him with a repulsor blast, blowing his head clean off. Nebula turned to him with her sword in the air, and visibly relaxed when she recognized him.
The ship was in bad conditions. After a couple of hours where Nebula just naped on top of the copilot controls, Tony decided to do a check-up of the general state of the ship. What he found was alarming.
It wasn't like the thought hadn't crossed Tony's mind. In fact, he was talking to a physical manifestation of his own subconscious. He knew he should be doing more, but he had reached rock bottom.
“Tony…” she said like a warning while picking her stuff from the table. While she was leaving she passed her hand through his hair, and he sighed.
The tavern was packed with creatures of all kinds. It was almost surprising the amount of races of aliens who were anthropomorphic. Tony was yet to find a classic little green alien. But they all seemed not very friendly, so he stayed close to Nebula. She seemed like she knew her stuff anyway.
Tony elongated his arm, clumsy, trying to reach the first aid kit that the blue girl (Nebula was her name? He couldn’t remember clearly) had separated for him and left in the table next to the bed. Trembling, he picked up the surgical scissors.
“Tighten your seatbelt,” she said, and that was about the last comprehensible thing Tony was able to hear. The sky was getting brighter and brighter, the temperature hotter, and the pressure on his body was rasing. At some point, he turned his head and vomited on the ground.
“FUCK!” she screamed, and typed furiously to the computer. Error messages started to pop up everywhere. She kept cursing, seeming to get more hysterical by the second.
It was that what Bruce had been up to the past two days? And Steve had just been weeping on the park, feeling sorry about himself?
Tony smirked a little, bitter. “There’s no alternative. I’ll use one of the oxygen suits, what’s left of my armor, and that’ll have to make do.”
Still, they were armed with laser weapons and all Nebula had was a sword. She still had to dodge the fire and manage to not lose a limb in the process. It was eight against one, and she was unstoppable. But she was also drunk as a skunk.
Tony remained sceptical. “Yes Steve, that's how it works. I still fail to understand how any of this is relevant.”
“And what if I am?” she screamed back, already taking out her sword. Tony observed as the men rapidly took out their weapons and pointed at them. The situation was escalating way too quickly for his liking.
Five laser guns were pointed at her head. “Say that again,” dared he one of the men. Tony was regretting every life decision that had led him to this precise moment. And Nebula was so fucking drunk.
“Was he your son?” asked Nebula out of the blue, while chewing on a small ration bar. It was the only thing they ate per day. In less than a week they would run out of food.
Steve stared at the global map intensely, Natasha by his side. She hadn’t said a word to him in an hour. The numbers of missing people kept rising.
“Isn’t “up” and “zenit” kind of redundant?” asked Tony, turning the ship on one side to avoid fire from the ground. The entire ship trembled with each blaster fire that reached them. He flew them up on a forty degree angle. Nebula glared at him.
“Can we know where?” he insisted. Natasha studied him, insolent, and seemed to decide he wasn’t worth the effort.
He had begged, the poor and miserable boy. He had begged to be exempted, he had clung to life with despair. Peter had embraced him with the terror of a little boy who learns for the first time that death is real and inevitable. And in just a few seconds, he was gone.
His head felt heavy, like a water balloon. If he moved too fast he saw the stars. His stomach accumulated dust, and soon it would begin to eat itself. His throat was constantly burning, dry.
Tony cleared his throat to announce his presence. Nebula ignored him. Rolling his eyes, Tony walked towards her and offered her the plate with fruit.
Cold dread settled in Tony’s bones. He allowed himself exactly ten seconds of complete and utter panic, where he covered his mouth with his hands and tried to breathe properly. In, and out.
“What do you see, then?” she asked, serene, turning to look out of the windows. Tony knew they were moving at an incredible high velocity, probably close to lightspeed, but space was so vast and the distances between stars were so impossible to conceive for the human mind that it looked like nothing was changing.
Without needing another word, she jumped the men and attacked them with all her strength. For the second time in that day, Tony was taken aback by the sheer might and ferocity of Nebula. She fought with Natasha’s ability and grace, Steve’s brute force and strategy, Clint’s surgical precision and Bruce’s neverending rage. She was a force of nature.
Then, everything in Tony's mind clicked into place. “A computer that's entangled with Stark Industries main server on Earth.”
He found a basket with fruit. It was unlike any he had seen before on earth, but it seemed innocent. He put a pair of it on a plate and walked to the cockpit, balancing both plates. There he found Nebula, sitting in one of the seats, staring at Titan's dirty, dry, and infertile soil through the windows of the ship.
Nebula didn't change her expression, but something in the silence that lingered suggested to Tony that she hadn't considered the possibility of his eyesight being different to hers.
Nebula had parked the ship on the outskirts of some kind of shop. She paid a small creature with tentacles on its head and said something in a language that was completely indecipherable for Tony. The creature went to the shop and came back with a jerrycan of something. Tony assumed it was fuel for the ship. He watched the creature walk up to the Benatar and open a compartment behind the right wing.
"You want that, Steve?" Tony asks him in real time, voice low and rough like whisky. "Want to wear something pretty for me?"
He presses a soft kiss to the swell of Steve’s hip, then slides off the bed and starts digging in his bedside drawer. He’d checked his supplies ahead of time, and everything is where he’d left it. There’s lube, there’s a vibrator, and there’s the dildo he’d picked out special, just for this.
Tony groans, grinding his hips down, and Steve squeezes harder. Tony’s ass is gorgeous, and Steve had never thought he’d get to feel the perfection of it in his hands. He can feel his own cock harden more in his jeans.
Tony is trembling, hands fisted and arms straining slightly against the cuffs over his wrists. “Yellow,” he croaks, because he’s not ready to safeword out but he
“It’s hard to get,” Tony slurs, stating the obvious. Steve breaks off a small square and touches it to Tony’s lips. Without thinking about it, Tony obediently opens his mouth, and Steve places the sweet square on his tongue. Tony closes his lips and lets it rest there for a moment, melting and spreading sweetness across his tastebuds.
Tony’s cock throbs, his heart stutters, and he tries to hold on. He does, he tries not to come, wanting to last as long as possible for Steve, but he’s so gorgeous, so wanton, and he’s asking
Steve opens his mouth instantly, pokes his tongue out to lick and taste, but Tony doesn’t push forward yet, just lets Steve lick at the head, tasting pre-come and clean skin.
“Fuck, yes,” he gasps. “That’s why I booked you, handsome. Didn’t think you’d be so fucking hot from your ad, but, god, yes, please give it to me,” Stark bursts out.
"I think you're missing the point of this, Steve," he says, one eyebrow quirking in a way that's both teasing and precise. "I tried calling you multiple times. I sat up here and
“Yeah,” Steve says after a moment of self-scolding. “I am. Thanks, Tony.” He says this last with a grin, popping open the cardboard takeout container and taking the taco out. It smells delicious, like spices and beef and salsa and lime. He picks it up and takes a bite, trying not to blush as the shell cracks and a little bit of the beef slips down his bottom lip.
Steve meets his eye, stares back, but doesn’t say a word. After a long moment, a hesitation that makes Tony wonder if Steve is feeling this too, Steve stands, taking a step back toward the table along the wall.
Steve whispers as he works – nonsensical praise, telling Tony how good he is, how sweet and beautiful and gorgeous he is like this. How he’d been so, so good for Steve. Tony basks in it, his head lolling as Steve sits up against the headboard, arranging Tony to sit with his back against Steve’s chest, hips situated between Steve’s spread legs.
“And we know he was working with Bill Foster in 1975,” Tony tells him around a mouthful. “So some time in the next five years, he cracks the formula.”
In his darker, bitter moments, Tony knows he’s the face of progress in a world where most are left behind, left to fend for themselves or turn to crime or substances or
There’s the snick of a plastic cap opening, and then cool oil dribbles over Tony’s back. He gasps at the suddenness of it, cheeks flushing when Steve lets out a low chuckle. Then Steve’s big, strong hands are spreading the oil over his back, his shoulders, skimming over his ass and down his legs, spreading the oil all over him.
Steve whines at the praise, but he still can't seem to make his mouth form words. He moans a little, hoping Tony will understand his gratitude, his love.
Steve’s steady stroking on his cock has Tony’s toes curling, even as he sinks another step into subspace. Steve lets go of the bulb and takes hold of the dildo in Tony’s body, pushing it forward and pulling it out a little, stretching Tony’s rim further around the wider part of the toy before pushing it back in, deep, pressing it against Tony’s prostate.
They’re necking on the couch, Tony laying on top of Steve and kissing him, hands roaming. Tony is kissing him deeper and deeper, grinding his hips down, but Steve can feel the difference. Steve’s got an erection, how could he not? But he can’t feel any answering hardness in Tony’s pants.
His favourite is the night Tony sucks Steve off while Steve opens him up, then Steve fucks him through orgasm after orgasm, until Tony is full of come and leaking. They hop in Tony’s ridiculous shower to clean off, and Tony goes down on Steve again under the hot spray, jerking himself off on his knees as Steve comes all over his face.
Tony shifts up onto his knees behind Steve, eyes flicking back and forth between Steve’s head hung between his arms, and his ass stretching to open up for the toy.
Steve doesn’t like the emptiness of it, but he knows he’ll feel full again, feel Tony inside him in just a minute.
Tony steps forward and pushes the head of his cock into Steve’s mouth, and Steve sucks gently, before pulling back slightly to kiss it. He tilts his head, pressing loving, open-mouthed kisses around the head, halfway up the sides, as much as he can reach when he can’t push forward. Tony shifts forward a few more inches so Steve can kiss down to the base, nibbling and licking along the side of Tony’s cock. Tony sighs happily – Steve is very good with his mouth, and when he’s loose and easy like this, his lips and tongue are hot and wet and soft and heavenly.
In the next photo, he's got the panties hanging off one ankle, and laying on his back with his legs up in the air, holding himself spread open by his knees. As Tony flicks through the photos, they get more and more risque. Steve can't help but be aroused by them, but he laughs at some of them as well, because every once in a while Tony had thrown in a ridiculous pose – in one of them he's hanging upside down from Steve's chin-up bar in their personal work out room. At least it hadn't been the communal gym.
, but what he sees on Steve’s face isn’t blame and disgust, it’s just the usual awe of meeting what, in the world they live in, is the closest thing to a celebrity he’s ever shared air with.
His hand, of its own volition, starts at Stark’s ankle and slides up, slick with oil. Up his shin, up his thigh, up to his hip and under the towel, and Stark makes a punched-out sound of arousal.
. So it only takes a few nights in bed with Steve (in quick succession because apparently Steve has some pent-up sexual tension and has been relatively celibate since the ice, and Steve and Tony are
When Steve gets into his head like this, there’s only one way for Tony to pull him out of it, and that’s by bringing all of his focus into his physical body, into his skin and his muscles, pulling him out of himself.
After a moment’s consideration, Tony steps forward and pulls the release on the leg sections, pulling Steve’s legs wider apart, stretching his thighs open. He does it slowly so as not to strain Steve’s hips, but he doesn’t stop until Steve’s thighs are pushed up and wide, like a frog in the middle of a pond, preparing for another push forward in the water.
Tony freezes for half a second, but then his hands are up, gripping around Steve’s face, fingers digging into Steve’s beard as Tony kisses him back, lips sliding and tongue hot and dipping between Steve’s lips to explore his mouth.
They’re having the same conversation they’ve had countless nights before. They’re eating dry meatloaf and boiled potatoes (it had been Steve’s night to cook, so at least they’re not eating underdone omelets) at their small kitchen table.
“Nat has my black card,” Tony tells him, stepping out into the street to flag down a cab. One stops immediately, because he’s Tony Stark and no cabbie in New York wouldn’t recognize him at a glance. “She’ll get the tab.”
Tony cuts off the proclamation by bringing the crop down hard and fast on Steve’s ass, already a deep cherry red from his work with the paddle and the flogger, and Steve screams, whole body spasming, cock throbbing, so Tony does it again and again, leaving new marks, crisscrossing his way up Steve’s beautiful ass, down the backs of his thighs, up to his lower back, until Steve is letting out a low, continuous moan, jerking helplessly against his bonds.
“You’ve been doing so well,” Steve says, turning his head to the side so he can kiss the inside of Tony’s shin. “I’d like to try this, if you think it won’t hurt too much.”
Steve doesn’t elaborate further, cheeks burning red, and the wheels in Tony's brain start turning and he finally catches up. “You… are you saying that the serum did something to your… refractory period?”
Steve’s eyes are closed, his eyelashes fluttering with pleasure with every thrust down. Tony strokes him harder, faster, loving the way Steve’s body takes him in.
He doesn’t break the kiss as he swings his leg over, climbs up and straddles Tony’s hips. Once he’s there, he does pull up and straighten his back, and then he grabs the jar of slick and puts some on his fingers, reaching behind his hips to take hold of Tony’s cock, spreading it over the hard flesh.
Tony walks around to the front of the bench, and runs his hand through Steve’s hair, where it’s flopped down over his eyes. It’s soft and shining in the low light of the room, like gold in the flickering candlelight.
“I’m not a sex worker,” Steve blurts out, and Tony’s eyes snap wide. “I’m not a – I’m just a regular massage therapist, I’m not
Tony shifts, turning his body and swinging his leg over Steve’s lap, and he kicks the popcorn bowl and popcorn goes everywhere, but Steve doesn’t care because Tony Stark is straddling his lap, fingers digging into Steve’s face, body warm and heavy and solid on Steve’s thighs. Steve has to tilt his head up now, and Tony is guiding the kiss, driving it deeper and harder and wilder. Steve slides his hands down to wrap around Tony’s waist, and his hands feel big and clumsy and ridiculous around Tony’s middle, but Tony shifts and rolls his hips a little, wriggling, and Steve just wants to touch and touch and touch.
Tony lowers himself down, thighs resting on Steve’s chest, and he’s finally, finally in reach, so Steve stops wasting time and uses his hands to spread Tony’s cheeks apart, and begins to kiss and lick at the tender, hidden skin. He slides his tongue up Tony’s crack, circling wetly around his hole. The texture is rough, tight, but it feels hot against his mouth.
Steve groans as he gets Tony all the way into him, shifting his hips back and forth a little to put pressure on his own prostate. Tony feels amazing in him.
. He can use his hands, he can spread Tony’s cheeks apart for his mouth, do a proper job of it, but he’ll still be tied down, there for Tony’s pleasure, only able to move if Tony decides he can.
"How many times you wanna come tonight, honey?" Tony asks, then. "You want me to make you come now, and then fuck you when you're sensitive, when it hurts, until you come again?"
Steve slides down the table, pressing warm kisses against the backs of Tony’s thighs and knees and calves as he goes, until Tony is alone on the padded surface again.
Tony moves over to the toy chest, running his fingers over the various canes and floggers and whips, trying to decide what he’s going to use to mark Steve’s skin today.
But he can’t wait much longer to sort out the morality of it. He’s past the point of need by now, and he can’t bring himself to try another matching app, to risk what private or desperate doms need to do to him to bring him down, to get what
“God, Steve, you drive me crazy,” Tony grunts, watching the dildo and his cock disappear into Steve’s stretched hole. Steve’s cock is still hard, still bouncing and slapping between Tony’s belly and Steve’s.
“You’ll count to 10 for me,” Steve tells him. Instructs him. “When you count, I’ll pump it once. We’ll go at your speed, but we’re going to go all the way to 10.”
“I love you,” Tony murmurs again, into the skin of Steve’s neck, lips brushing against the deep red collar.
“That’s it,” Steve murmurs against the flesh of Tony’s ass cheek, his breath warm and damp against the skin. “That’s so good, Tony.”
Steve gently massages Tony’s arms and legs as he unbinds him, checking for abrasions and any facial expressions that would indicate pain or discomfort. But, no – Tony is floating in subspace, completely relaxed.
‘Indentured servant’, technically, is the term they prefer to use. And the people who work here, who are kept here – they’d sold themselves into that arrangement. Tony knows that, that they had technically made a choice.
He takes a small square of chocolate and, sitting crosslegged to face Steve on the bed, holds it up to Steve’s lips. It feels strangely, dangerously intimate.
“Oh, you’re gonna pay for that,” Tony promises, shifting back a little more. He spreads his knees, and now Steve can see a hint of it, the furled skin of his hole, pink and clean and tight. It looks amazing, he wants to see if it feels just as good.
Tony whines, tensing his core to try and tilt his hips, hoping he can maybe bend enough at the waist to rub the head of his cock across the sheer fabric of the chemise floating over his belly. But he can’t move enough — Steve is nothing if not particularly skilled at rope play. Tony is completely immobile, suspended several feet in the air. He desperately tries to move, to try and get some friction on his cock, but he can’t get the leverage. Not that it would matter that much — Steve had made sure to put a cock ring on him before they’d even started that evening.
The door opens behind him, and he looks up in the mirror to meet Tony’s eyes. Tony is grinning, and he reaches out and grabs Steve by the sleeve of his suit.
After another few calming breaths, Tony hauls himself up to standing, and then gently, carefully, helps Steve up as well. He gives them both a moment or two before he starts to guide Steve to the bed – the playroom bed, not the bedroom bed, because Tony isn’t sure he can walk them that far – and helps him lay down on his side.
“Oh, you’re so good for me,” Tony sighs, brushing the backs of his knuckles down over Steve’s sweat-dampened cheek. He steps forward and brings his cock to Steve’s lips, though he doesn’t push in just yet. “I want you to worship my cock,” Tony tells him. “But don’t make me come. Can you do that?”
He thrusts the dildo in, fast and hard, and reaches for the lube beside him. Steve cries out in rhythm with the toy, his prostate probably so sensitive it’s right on the edge of pain, and he moans when Tony pours lube over the place where his rim is stretched around the silicone. Tony drops the bottle and rubs his fingers over the skin, letting the dildo push some of the slick inside, and then he pushes up on his knees, bringing his cock close to that filled hole. He tips the base of the dildo up and presses the head of his erection against the rim as Steve gasps.
the ceiling, he’s everywhere, and there’s absolutely no reason to look up when the Avengers are talking to him.
“I’m all right,” Steve tries again, but the argument is bringing Tony up faster than he’d like. On the other hand, he’d been brought down so wonderfully that the upswing is smooth, and there’s no subdrop looming in sight.
“Call me Tony when you’re fucking me,” Stark gasps, laughter in his voice. “Fuck, your cock is huge, call me Tony.”
“You sensitive here?” Tony asks him, fingers moving a little faster, putting on a little more pressure. “Feel okay?”
Steve moves around to stand in front of Tony, and Tony looks up at him, eyes wet and trusting. Maybe Steve will give Tony his cock to suck again. That would be good. Steve knows what Tony
The pleasure rushes over him suddenly, a wave of white noise and darkened vision as his whole body tenses. His ass clenches, making him that much tighter for Tony, and Steve revels in the sound of shocked pleasure that Tony gives then. Steve's balls are pulsing, his cock jerking in the air and spilling come all over his belly. It's pulsing out of him; this kind of orgasm, coming untouched like this, is always more intense, but it's always less explosive. His whole body convulses, his cries raise in pitch, and he shivers, writhing in pleasure.
The kiss takes a while to slow down, to cool off, and when it naturally ends, when they’ve caught their breath, Tony reaches up and pulls at Steve’s wrist cuffs, slides the buckles undone and then massages his wrists as he frees them. Steve shivers, sated but needful, then wraps his arms around Tony’s back and kisses him, kisses him until they’re both breathless again.
“Oh my god,” Steve moans, the words a mumble as he holds the chocolate on his tongue. “This is… I’ve never tasted anything like this.”
“Tony,” Steve says, and he can see it in Tony’s shoulders, the way he’s hunched in on himself. Honestly, Steve would have expected him to be a little more confident, a little less unsure, but last night had thrown them both for a loop. “Tony, I’m not… Peggy is married. She has kids. She’s… she’s moved on.”
Steve’s face relaxes, and he smiles a little, locking onto Tony’s beautiful brown eyes. “Yeah,” he says. “I’d like that.”
"Captain Rogers? There a problem?" Fury asks, tilting his head back so he can study Steve down the length of his nose.
Steve lets his hands roam over Tony’s back, down his sides, up his chest and over his shoulders. He can’t get enough of touching Tony, actually. And, now that he thinks about it, actually – Steve lets his hand slide down Tony’s back, all the way to his ass, and squeezes the full, round curve of it.
“Well, for Nat and I. She said she’d go with me. I don’t expect anyone else to go, but my favourite part is the turkey buns, so I wanted to have one before church.”
Steve moves down the table some, then climbs up onto it. He kneels straddling Tony’s legs, leaning forward to run his hands up Tony’s spine. The change in position drags Tony back up a step, and he feels his body tighten, the hard-won drift into subspace interrupted.
“Pep and I – we’re not actually together anymore. I mean, we live together, and I guess every once in a while we – but we’re not married. We ‘uncoupled’, it’s all the rage, but we’re not – we’re still
Tony reaches down and wraps his hand around Steve's cock, palm hot and calloused. He brushes his thumb through the drop of fluid there, then brings it up to Steve's lips. Steve can't lick it off, he still has the panties in his mouth, but Tony just swipes his thumb over Steve's full, stretched bottom lip, coating it with his own pre-come.
But, as a smart guy, Steve manages to work out that Tony is using sex to avoid talking about their feelings. He’s just not sure how to approach the subject.
Tony moans – his body jerks up a step further from subspace, a consequence of the surprise, but he sinks right back down when Steve’s tongue begins to work at him, teasing and slicking the furl of skin between his cheeks.
Steve keeps sucking, bobbing his head in a smooth rhythm, working on taking more and more of Tony into his throat. He gets a little bit more down each time, and he’s almost at the base when Tony pulls back, breathing hard and shaking. His cock is wet, glistening with Steve’s saliva and his own pre-come, and Steve can’t help it, he leans forward, chasing after it, because he wants it back, wants it in his mouth, wants to keep pulling those pleasure noises out of Tony.
from Tony’s mouth, and maybe he shouldn’t have put it there. On the other hand, Steve is all up in his space, so that’s not exactly a deterrent.
Steve thinks about it for a moment before he answers, and the pleased look Tony gives him tells him that was the right thing to do. “If it won’t choke me, I think it would be okay.” He thinks about that for a second, and maybe he – other people like that, sometimes, maybe he would want it, would like it. “I mean, I don’t – I don’t know if that’s –”
“Not arguing,” Steve gasps into his mouth, and Tony rolls off in one quick movement, and they’re both reaching for their own flies, working their pants off and down. Steve hooks his thumbs into his socks on the way down, half-sitting up and half putting his legs in the air to speed up the process, and sees Tony doing the same thing. It’s not a sexy pose for either of them, but it is efficient, so they’re both nude in no time.
They talk about the last mission. They talk about the team. They talk about the news. Steve starts talking about a restaurant.
“It can be a lot,” Tony tells him, mustering up the strength to roll onto his side so he can face Steve. He lets the dildo fall to the bed, he’ll worry about sanitizing it later. “I don’t… I don’t want to have pushed you too far.”
He brings the stiff crop over to Steve’s bench, proud of the way Steve stays facing forward, not craning his neck to look over his shoulder at Tony. Trusting in Tony, that Tony will bring him what he needs, what he wants, even if Steve can’t articulate it.
“Don’t bite down,” Tony warns him. “That belt is expensive, I’ll be annoyed if you ruin it with teeth marks.” It’s a complete lie – Tony couldn’t give less of a fuck about the belt, but Steve will
He rolls the latex down over his cock, and steps forward, pumping another couple of tablespoons of the (thankfully) internally safe massage oil from the bottle strapped to his belt. He pushes the bottle to the side so it’s out of the way, and rubs the oil over his cock, thrilling at the taboo of what he’s doing. He swipes the remainder of the slick fluid over Stark’s hole, then steps forward until the front of his thighs are touching the back of Stark’s.
Steve rolls his eyes. “I know your assistant has your entire calendar downloaded onto every piece of technology in this tower, and I’ve even got a paper copy in my suite in case of an emergency,” he says. “You definitely know it’s Christmas Eve.”
His eyes go wide, then his eyelashes flutter closed. A soft sound creaks out of his throat, and Tony can’t help but feel his cock twitch a little at it. He’s spent, couldn’t get it up again if he tried, but the sound Steve makes is pure sex.
,” Steve had said, after, when he’d called Yellow and they’d stopped, Tony wrapping his arms around Steve to hold him close. “You would never
Tony looks up at him when Steve is laughing, and his face changes – it softens around the edges, and Tony’s eyes do that thing they do, where they’re huge and beautiful and Steve can’t stop staring at him. Tony’s smile fades, but he’s not frowning, he’s just looking up at Steve, and Steve is looking down and he’s not laughing anymore, either.
“And what are you putting on it now?” Tony asks, coming closer and leaning over the counter to watch.
“You’re so sensitive,” Tony murmurs against Steve’s jaw, letting his finger press just lightly against Steve’s hole. His rim twitches, then the muscles relax and soften, letting Tony dip the tip in. He doesn’t go far, it’s too dry, but Steve moans again and spreads his legs. His jeans tighten over Tony’s hand, trapping him, so Tony pulls his hand out and back, pushing at Steve’s shoulders at the same time.
“Steve?” Tony asks, eyes flickering in the low light from the television. The sound of it, the audience laughter, fades away.
There’s a naked man tied down to a bench, his head and wrists locked in a pillory. He’s on his belly against the leather bench, legs spread wide and shackled to the floor. There’s a mirror in front of the pillory so Tony can see the man’s face even though he and Coulson are situated behind him. His hair is dark with a peppering of grey, curly and clinging to his forehead with sweat, and he is, inexplicably, wearing glasses. As if there’s anything in front of him he needs to be able to see clearly right now. No, the interesting part of the show is all in the back.
Oh. He’d been saying that out loud. He blushes, and Tony strokes a thumb over his cheek, still smiling.
“Oh, jesus, seriously, you’re a menace,” Tony gasps, wrapping his legs around Steve’s waist, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck.
Steve is panting with the effort as he fucks into Tony’s body roughly. He’s not making any effort to hit Tony’s prostate, but his cock is big enough and Tony’s hanging at the right angle so that every thrust slides across that sensitive gland with every wild thrust. Steve grunts as he fucks, and Tony’s head is floating so deeply into subspace, down and down with every thrust. He’s made for this; made to be a hole for Steve to use, because Steve has needs, and Steve needs to get off, needs to come somewhere warm and wet and welcoming, and Tony can be that for him. His own pleasure doesn’t matter, it never matters, as long as he’s hot and tight and perfect for Steve.
Tony stares for a long moment. Neither of the men are wearing one of the face masks, but everyone watching them is. That, and the fact that Coulson had told Tony their names, means the two men are staff.
Finally, Steve unbuckles the ring gag and gently takes it out of Tony’s mouth, watching as Tony closes his lips and licks them, smacking his tongue almost drunkenly. Steve takes a moment to massage Tony’s jaw, and Tony moans a little at the sensation. He picks Tony up in a bridal carry and takes him over to their bed, dressed with soft, clean sheets and soft, fuzzy blankets. Tony always loves the different sensations of soft fabrics when he’s down.
But Tony had been dating Pepper, and they’d been working together, and Steve still wasn’t 100% comfortable with navigating relationships – let alone queer ones – in modern times, so he’d let the moment go. Pushed down any feelings, and told himself that Tony was his teammate and friend, and that was it, and that was all he could ever be.
“That’s good, Tony,” Steve praises him, and Tony sinks deeper into the bed, into subspace. “Just like that.”
“I asked Jarvis what your favourite dessert was,” Steve admits when he pulls out a couple of dough balls wrapped in plastic from the fridge. “I started the dough a couple of days ago.”
He twists his wrist again, knowing it’s futile but not yet willing to give up the fight. The silky red rope rubs against his skin, but it’s not altogether unpleasant. It’s almost grounding, feeling that pinprick rawness on his wrist. His hand is clenched hard around the round bell. Steve had told him, if he needs to safeword, all he has to do is drop the bell.
Tony pauses for a couple of beats. “Um. It’s nice. This is nice. A nice way to just, you know, be close to – to someone.”
“We aren’t – they were very clear when they gave me the instructions. I was only to give it to you if I thought I’d gotten you all the way down, and it’s worth at least three months of my contract –”
Tony keeps one hand in Steve’s hair, and brings the other up to swipe his thumb along Steve’s full lower lip. It’s dry, and his finger drags across the pink skin. Steve just holds his gaze, breathing deeply in through his nose.
Steve blinks, catching on right away. His cock hardens in his slacks, and he doesn't miss the way Tony's hardens under the lace of his panties.
wanted to have sex with you. I mean, I thought it was just going to be a rub and tug thing, too, but you’re so hot, I just… I mean it. I won’t report you, and it was really, really good.”
But then what? How else can he quiet the chaos in his head, the anxiety and pain in his chest, clawing to get out and begging to be brought down to the serene safety of subspace?
Tony reaches out with one hand, thumb swiping under Steve’s lip to wipe away the spill. He freezes, his hand inches away from Steve’s face, and his eyes go wide.
Tony cries out, gasps, “Five,” and grips the wrought iron bed frame tightly, listening to it creak as Steve lets go and squeezes the bulb, the rubber cock inside him inflates further and Tony feels his head swim, feels the drop take him lower still, and whispers, “Six.”
Tony’s chest and belly are heaving with the effort of sucking air into his lungs as the wide dildo opens him, presses into his body and stretches him to a fullness he’s never felt before.
He steps back and continues down the walkway, trusting Tony to follow him. So, his scene won’t be with the redheaded dom, then.
“Yeah,” Steve says, then leans forward and kisses him again. This time, it’s slower, but he deepens it quickly, using his tongue to try and taste every inch of Tony’s mouth.
Steve blinks, turning the phrase over in his mind. The ad is new, he’d just put it online yesterday, and Tony had been the first client to call for an appointment – one which he’d asked for the same day. Steve needs the money, of course, so he’d shuffled some things around and fit him in, and… oh, god. Now that he thinks about it, the ad
“That’s Clint and Natasha.” Coulson’s voice has taken an almost wistful tone, and Tony tears his eyes away from the scene to look at him. Coulson is watching the two raptly.
The meeting starts as they all do – with a brief summary of the last few weeks' worth of SHIELD business. They touch on some Avengers missions, but Fury does what he can to keep the WSC out of Avengers business. Steve's only here because of his unique position as the leader of the Avengers and his position in the SHIELD Strike Team ranks.
They're spread over one half of the table. The other side of the table has no chairs for anyone to sit – instead, there are holo-pads lined up along that side of the room, and the projectors around the room are all shining in their direction to project holograms of the members of the WSC so it seems they're in the room.
He takes his hand back as the screen reads the results. He is, in fact, still Tony Stark, and his blood test is still clean. No STIs, no bloodborne diseases. He finds that comforting, actually – he’d known his results would still be clean, but it’s nice to know the brothel’s policy ensures everyone else that comes in here is safe and healthy as well.
It stretches his ass cheeks open, and his hole is exposed to the warm air of the room, twitching as he clenches with the humiliation of it.
“Tony, Tony, god, Tony, please, fuck,” Steve is gasping, nonsensical and frantic. Tony moves to his side so he can see Steve’s face – his cheeks are red, damp with sweat and tears, his eyes closed tight as he cries, as he comes, and Tony keeps hitting him through it.
“And for them, we’re only going to be gone a minute. We’ve been here six months, Steve, but we’re still going back at the same time we’d planned. We’ll arrive back in 2023 and they won’t even know I was gone.”
“It’s very early in the morning,” Steve says, voice measured. “And I sort of had most of my brain cells fucked out of me last night, so I’m going to need you to be very, very clear about what you’re trying to say to me right now.”
But had they, really? The thought niggles at the back of his mind. What if they’d been manipulated into making the choice? What if the choice had been this, or die on the streets? Was that even any choice at all?
“Let me say it,” Steve says, whispering, begging. “Just once, before you put the walls back up, okay?”
“I’ll give you anything you want,” Steve says, and for the first time, Tony feels the hardness of his cock against Tony’s own thigh. He’s large, larger than Tony had expected, and rock hard, leaking wetness onto Tony’s thigh. Steve’s voice is strained, the first time he’s sounded anything other than in complete control, and that knowledge,
Tony grimaces. “And he made it into the LGBT section? How’d that go?” Tony almost doesn’t want to hear the answer. His bisexuality is common knowledge to the public, but that doesn’t mean Steve knows about it. And Steve’s from the 40s – Tony knows from personal experience that most people he’s met born before 1960 have a lot of things to say about sexuality, and none of them are anything he wants to hear from Steve. And yeah, Steve’s ass is,
“Pants off,” he breathes, when Steve makes a sound of disappointment and the break in contact. “Pants off, then hands and knees. I’m going to make you scream my name,” Tony promises.
Steve thrusts into his mouth again and again, salty bitter and warm with sweat, and Tony doesn’t suck, doesn’t swallow, doesn’t lick. He just lays there, lets Steve move his head, lets Steve use his mouth and fuck him, and if he could come again he would. It’s amazing, and he spirals down into subspace so fast he’s almost breathless with it, and by the time Steve pulls out and comes on Tony’s face, marking him and owning him and taking him, Tony is the furthest into subspace he’s ever been. His mind is quiet, thoughts passing by slowly, and he barely notices when Steve uses his thumb to swipe up the mess of come from Tony’s face and scoop it into Tony’s mouth. He doesn’t suck it off, but Steve presses the thumb against his tongue, and Tony tastes him. Steve is rumbling praise again, soft and gentle, and Tony’s not even listening, but he can hear it in the tone of voice, that Steve is saying things like ‘good boy’ and ‘sweet’ and ‘gorgeous’, and Tony lets it float by because nothing matters.
Tony speeds up his thrusts, putting a little more force behind them, and Steve cries out in pleasure.
When Steve finally pulls back, his cheeks are flushed and his lips are glistening, but his eyes are twinkling with happiness. “Merry Christmas, Tony.”
good with his hands, and when he decides to fuck Tony with his fingers, he can make Tony come over and over, dry, tears streaming down his face at the onslaught of sensation. He’d fingered Tony open for the vibrating plug, using those long, thick fingers to scissor Tony open for the toy, and he’d dug his fingers into Tony’s hair while he’d fucked Tony’s mouth a few minutes ago. Or hours. Tony can’t tell how long he’s been here, floating above the ground both figuratively and literally, but it feels like only seconds or years.
Tony runs a hand down his spine, and Steve shivers. Tony’s fingers caress his ass, teasing at the top of his crack.
“We’ll be taking the long way around so I can give you the tour,” Coulson says, turning his head to speak over his shoulder. “It’s quiet today, but it will give you the opportunity to see what other services we have on offer, should you decide to visit us again.”
“I don’t just mean the sex,” Steve says. “Tony, the sex is, wow, beyond amazing. There aren’t even words for how good the sex is, but it’s not just about sex.” Steve reaches up and tips Tony’s chin up so Tony has to meet his gaze, which is when Tony realizes he’d been avoiding it. He looks up into piercing blue eyes.
“Fuckin – huge goddamned cock –” Tony is choking out between thursts, and it’s enough to push Steve right to the edge of orgasm. He jerks Tony’s cock harder, slick and tight and fast, and then Tony cries out, his whole body tensing with pleasure and urgency.
“Sure,” he says, sidling up close to Steve, so close he can feel the heat of him through their clothes. “What’s first?”
Tony is fucking him harder, grinding and thrusting wildly, which means he's about to come, too. Steve barely has his wits about him, but he does what he can to help Tony along, wrapping one leg back around Tony's hips to pull him in, still keening and shuddering through the orgasm that seems to last forever.
So Tony moves the Avengers in. Barton tends to fuck off on his own a lot, and Romanoff is in and out on SHIELD missions. It doesn’t take long for her to start taking Steve with her, and then it’s just him and Banner and Thor. Thor spends a lot of time in London, though, where his girlfriend (and it’s not lost on Tony that Thor is the only one of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes with a regular lay, somehow) is doing some fascinating work with Einstein-Rosen Bridges. Tony would really like to get his hands on some of her research, but every time he asks Thor to put in a good word, Thor laughs at him and tells Tony “Jane is too smart for the likes of you,” which, hey. Not nice.
“What about the rest of them?” Steve nods his chin down the street to the restaurant they’d snuck out of.
And he’ll be damned if he lets this one go by him again. Tony had nearly died in space, they’d both nearly died countless times, they’d been through so much. And Steve is tired of not taking chances.
“I’m trying,” Tony says, shaking his head and slurping his spoon. Steve is trying to keep his eyes off Tony’s mouth but it’s not going all that well.
things. He notices that whenever he initiates any kind of touch with Tony, Tony turns it immediately into sex.
A bead of precome forms at the head of his cock, and Steve swipes his thumb over it, using it to further slick the slide of his hand up and down. Stark cries out, and Steve can’t help himself - he curls his middle finger, deep inside Stark’s body, rubbing the pad of it over where he thinks Stark’s prostate is.
“Excuse me,” he says, looking down at his dish of blue foam. He’s never eaten anything this colour, and he needs a breather already. “Be right back.”
Steve pushes the elastic waistband of his pants down, under his cock and balls, and tears the condom package open with his teeth. He pulls the rubber ring out and pushes it down over his cock, hissing between his teeth with pleasure as his own fingers remind him of the sensitivity of his own hard-on.
A crinkle, plastic and paper and foil, then Steve is holding something near Tony’s face and he can smell chocolate. Sugar and milk and something unlike anything else, there under his nose. He moans slightly, too far down to even be embarrassed. Where had they gotten
Once they’ve swallowed the sweet delicacy, Tony leans back and stretches his arms up, feeling the burn of muscles that had tensed and then intensely relaxed during their scene.
Steve produces the lube and the cloth bag he’d had earlier, though Tony doesn’t remember him bringing it over to the bed when they’d made their way from the table. Steve takes Tony’s leg, the one closest to him, and pushes it up, up, up and drapes Tony’s knee over his shoulder, leaving Tony completely exposed and open to the room’s warm air. Steve takes the bottle of lube, squirts a generous amount on his fingers and adds to the slickness of the lube on his hole from earlier, then slides two fingers into Tony, fast but not rough.
free,” Tony says, reaching for the drawer beside the bed. He digs for a moment, then comes up with a new apparatus. It’s all black, and the first thing Steve thinks when he sees it is the
“That’s good too, sweetheart,” Tony says, before he squats down into a crouching position in front of Steve so he can meet his eyes. Steve’s eyes are deep blue, his pupils dilated. If Tony peeks under the torso bench to the other end, he can see Steve’s cock hanging there half-hard.
Rhodey would move in, he says, if he wasn’t still on active service. He’ll swing by, though. When he can.
“I think he’s getting close,” Tony says one night over dinner. It’s soup, because Steve still hasn’t learned to cook much, but they’re both tired of meatloaf.
“Not tonight,” Steve says. It’s not placating, not trying to feed Tony a line. Just a simple statement. Steve brushes a smudge from Tony’s cheek with his thumb, gives him a small smile and leans down to kiss Tony’s cheek where his thumb had brushed.
“I mean, I would have thought the serum would have done something about that, but I’m not exactly in a position to know, am I?”
“This is awkward,” Tony says after a beat. He just can’t help himself from getting a dig in at Steve’s expense, after all, if for no other reason than to make sure Steve doesn’t notice the way Tony can’t keep his eyes off the other man.
“Go to sleep, Stark,” Steve whispers against his mouth. “Or I’m gonna end up needing you to fuck me again.”
“Nope,” Clint agrees. “But you know that look he gets on his face? Where if you argue with him, not only will he be disappointed in you for the rest of his time on earth, but he’ll also probably make you regret it?”
Sub,” Steve says, not answering the question. “The way you gave yourself over? The way you let me… God, Tony. It was gorgeous. You were so perfect.”
“Oh, god,” Steve gasps, and then he raises himself up on his knees and thrusts down, setting a fast pace, fucking himself down on Tony’s cock as Tony strokes him, fingers hot and tight and lightly calloused.
“Steve. It’s important that you be honest with me, here. Please. I don’t want to do anything you don’t want to do. That won’t be good for me, I promise.” Tony looks so earnest, so serious.
“When I couldn’t see you, after the Accords, couldn’t talk to you – it was horrible,” Steve says later, into the skin of Tony’s belly. “And then I almost lost you. I never want to do that again.”
Finally, Steve slows, letting his body rest a moment draped over Tony’s before he pulls out and back, fingers pinching the base of the condom around his softening cock.
Watching his face as the two cocks push inside him, stretch him open, is like a religious experience for Tony. Steve’s cock is hard and leaking as he presses himself down, filling himself up, all the way to the base. Then he starts rocking his hips, thrusting up on his knees and back down, slamming himself down on the cocks wildly and fucking himself.
Then Steve is pushing his cock in between Tony’s wet, slack lips, and the taste and weight on Tony’s tongue is ambrosia. Steve pushes in until his cock teases the back of Tony’s throat, but Tony doesn’t choke, his whole body too relaxed. Being used like this, being told to do nothing but allow Steve to pleasure himself using Tony’s mouth, has his whole body shivering even as his mind floats, sinking further and further down.
Steve lets out a snort of a laugh. “If there’s one thing you’re good at, Stark, it’s wringing me out,” he says.
His hole is still spasming around Tony’s fingers as Tony pulls them out, reaching for the dildo and pouring lube over it. Steve lets out a high-pitched whine – either overstimulation or desperation, Tony can never tell and Steve doesn’t seem to mind either way – as Tony presses the thick, solid head of the large dildo against his relaxed hole.
Steve shrugs one shoulder, wiping the last of the gloop onto the bird and then moving over to the sink. He puts his hands under the faucet, and Tony moves forward on autopilot to turn the tap on for him, getting close enough into Steve’s space that he can smell sage, pepper, and… is that mayonnaise?
He can’t focus, his eyes rolling back in his head with pleasure, and he sinks further and further down into subspace, and he hasn’t been this far down in years.
Tony pulls back and drives back in, fingers digging cruelly into Steve’s waist as he fucks him, hard and fast and brutal, and Steve cries out with every thrust, babbling as Tony does his best to angle himself over Steve’s prostate with every push.
With as antsy as Steve had been all day, he thinks he should use something with a little bit of bite. But he also knows that Steve will respond better if they start with something a little broader, heavier, less sharp. So he pulls a paddle out of the box. It’s long and broad, with a comfortable handle and made of a deep cherry mahogany wood.
The doms need something out of it, too, he knows. They need to take that control, to push a sub down and own them, to feel that wicked power. Even Pepper had struggled at times, had warred with trying to appease her own dominant nature and give Tony what he needed at the same time. It hadn’t been why they’d broken up, but it had been why Tony hadn’t felt comfortable asking her to continue to dom him when he’d needed someone – making her be something she didn’t want to be had never sat right with him.
Tony moves back down his body and stares at the dusky pink hole he’d kept bare this whole time. It’s twitching as Steve’s body clenches, and he can’t help himself – he angles the crop properly, softening the blow a little (but not that much) as he cracks the crop over Steve’s hole, between his magnificent asscheeks, and Steve
, and Steve had agreed not to be overbearing in the field, that they all have to take stupid risks, but had informed Tony, quite soundly, that he was still going to worry and that was never going to stop.
He flips it in his hand a few times, refamiliarizing himself with the weight of it, and then, without warning or hesitation, he brings it down over the thick, muscled meat of Steve’s ass.
“Remind me of your safe word,” Steve says, and Tony can tell from his tone that it’s a test, a check-in, that Steve certainly hasn’t forgotten.
“Well, a future where Zola and Hydra are embedded inside SHIELD doesn’t turn out all puppies and rainbows, either,” Steve tells him, jaw twitching.
“Don’t hold your breath,” Steve orders, and Tony lets out the air he’d been holding without noticing. The order itself causes that same feeling of centering that the praise had only a few moments ago, another step down into quieting the noise in his head.
Another squeeze, and Tony feels his cock twitch, feels himself get harder and fuller and stretched wider.
“And while we’re at it, why don’t we save Barnes? We might be too late to save the Beatles, but you never know. What else can we fix? I mean, it won’t change
Through the meeting, Tony texts Natasha, Fury, and even Hill, all with messages along the same lines: Tell Steve to look at the pictures I'm sending him.
Steve reaches over and picks up a bottle of water, unscrewing the cap and holding it up so Tony can take small sips. A little bit drips down Tony’s chin, but then he seems to realize how thirsty he is, and he begins swallowing properly. Steve takes the bottle away after a few sips, then reaches over for the little warmer beside their bed and pulls out a warm, damp cloth. He uses it to first wipe the drool and tears from Tony’s face, then down his chest, and then over his belly where there’s come keeping his sweet little chemise stuck to his skin. Tony moans, spreading his legs a little, but Steve doesn’t dip the cloth down under his balls to his ass. He likes that Tony is messy and wet with his come.
“You’ll wear that any time you’re in any of the viewing rooms, or walking in any of the common areas. You can take it off during your private session if you like, but it’s not expected. No one will ask you to remove your mask until you leave.”
“Take your clothes off,” Steve says, voice suddenly full of steel, and Tony twitches before hurriedly complying. When he’s standing naked in front of Steve, hands awkwardly covering his crotch, Steve steps around to examine him. He walks around Tony in a slow circle, then gestures to a padded table on the other side of the room. It’s at about waist height, and fairly wide, but narrower than a single bed. “Go lie on that table. Face down.”
“You okay?” Tony asks, remembering his manners even if he is having trouble with the English language.. “Sore?”
Nothing happens. He takes the little vial of Pym particles out of the compartment at his belt, shakes it, puts it back in, and hits the dial again. He looks up at Steve, reaching up to hit the retraction button for his helmet, eyes meeting Steve’s with trepidation.
Tony works hard at SHIELD every day – doubly hard, as he tries to keep from advancing them too far scientifically, having to see his father every day and lying about who he is, having to work with Zola, and still trying to keep an eye on Pym so that when he manages to perfect the particles, they can steal them and be on their way.
Tony looked up and saw her retreating from the room, slamming the door shut. Tony felt guilt sink into his stomach. Or maybe he was just hungry, it was hard to differentiate.
After a couple of hours, which Steve took advantage off by taking a brief nap -a wakandan nurse had forced him to take sleeping pills after a week of finding him wandering around at three am-, they reached the outskirts of the Avengers compound.
Nobody did, thought Tony. That monster had been a father. There was a special place in hell reserved for those who mistreated their children, and the punishments there were probably too kind for someone like Thanos.
Running out of excuses, Tony walked to the landing pad of the ship. He had enough of the nannities of the suit to be able to use both rocketboots and one gauntlet. The rest of his body would be protected by the oxygen suits.
The fatigue, the pulsating agony of his wounds and the the swarming nest of his mind finally defeated him, and his eyes closed.
“Hey,” they heard steps behind them and turned around to see Rhodey entering the room. “That thing just stopped doing whatever the hell it was doing.”
“You never stop being an alcoholic, kid,” had answered Tony after Peter’s kind insistence. “I just stopped drinking.”
Fortunately, Tony's pants were still in condition to be worn, so he simply borrowed a red shirt from Quill. It was big, but it was comfortable anyway.
sound. He collected all his fear and desperation, put it inside a box, shoved it to a corner of his mind, and closed it with three locks.
When Tony was a teenager he fell in love with the stars. He took an astrophysics and cosmology course at MIT, and dreamed of building his own rocket and exploring the skies. He had big plans: to reactivate the space race, to begin sidereal colonization. He would start with a scientific base on the Moon, then a colony on Mars. If he was lucky, he would move there himself. He would form a family and he would never have to see his parents again.
She returned to concentrate on her food. Tony looked at his hands, dry and full of small wounds. Nebula seemed to regret her outburst.
She was standing very still, probably evaluating the pros and cons of beheading them one by one, but alerting the entire market of her presence.
“You haven’t showered in a week, Steve. Supersoldier sweat it’s not a very pleasant smell to coexist with.”
With his body trembling, he sat at the edge of the bunk bed. He released a little moan of anguish, and taking a deep breath, he brought his hands to the wound. The nanoparts had cauterized the skin around it, preventing him from losing more blood, but a huge part of the armor was still inside his body.
A weird looking stall that was almost inside a narrow alley had a table full of apples on display. Fascinated, Tony approached the bright pink lady who was attending the shop.
After what it seemed like an hour, but it was probably just an instant, Nebula activated the hyperdrive and they jumped back into hyperspace.
He explored the rest of the room and found clothes that had probably belonged to Quill. Wearing his clothes without being able to ask for permission filled his mind with bitterness. Quill had shown himself capable and quick, but impulsive and extremely childish. He did not deserve to die. None of them deserved it.
Well that was uncalled for. Tony rolled his eyes and started marching towards the direction of the ship. He kind of remembered the path they had taken when they first arrived to the market. The town was small enough that he couldn't get lost.
“What if it’s not Stark,” said Thor. “What if it’s another enemy and we’re opening the door to them.”
Seeing the shield over there, mocking him, was the physical manifestation of everything that he had lost. He had failed so many people. His friends, who he had dared to call family. He had failed Tony, most of all, and now he was dead. And even pissed, Tony had kept his shield safe on his office. He had respected his space, while Steve had been unable to respect anything Tony had ever provided. Not his intelligence, his job, his home, not even his family. Steve’s attitude had gone well beyond pulling Tony’s pigtails. And even after everything, Tony had still preserved this space for him.
Once they were inside the main building, everyone scattered. Natasha left to the armory, probably to shoot a poor manikin into oblivion. Bruce sat in the lab, wanting to jump back into action, but unable to shake off Tony’s ghost from his mind. Thor went to the kitchen and decided to drown his sorrows on cookies and bread. Rhodey was the only left standing in the entrance hall with Steve.
Tony would come closer, scared shitless. He would know before it happened. The wind would take all of them with it, along with the rest of the ashes in the sky.
With terrible difficulty, he walked to the chamber with short steps. He sat on the edge, trying to catch his breath, and slowly layed over the surface of the pod. His entire body was screaming with pain and fatigue. His mind was like a nest of furious bees, disoriented and indecipherable. The glass top descended over his body and a white faint light illuminated the chamber.
Tony did not believe in ghosts, but he was not willing to discover the concept of haunted for an alien either. Besides, she was right. His heart burned at the thought of leaving Peter there (but there was nothing to leave, he was no more than ash.) He needed to return to earth. It was ridiculous to think that the day before he had been walking in Central Park with Pepper. It felt like years ago.
Before he realized he found himself inside his old office. Strangely enough, most of his stuff where exactly like he had left them the morning before parting to Germany two years ago. The only things that were different were some papers on top of his desk and his shield, that was leaning against a cabinet, collecting dust.
Peter was an open wound in Tony’s chest. One that probably would never heal. It sat there, agonizing and bitter, along with the wounds that his parents had left. Or Jarvis’, who had been his father in all the ways that mattered.
Several vendors approached them immediately, speaking fast in dieverse alien languages, bouncing their products on their multiple arms or appendices, trying to get them to buy. Nebula ignored all of them and kept on walking. She reached a corner where two streets met, and she turned give Tony instructions.
Of course, Tony thought fondly, everything is a competition for him. But it fell good to have someone to take the punches with.
He didn’t regret it. He needed Nebula. She deserved to live. He wasn’t going to let her be killed by some random bountyhunter.
Soon they realized food was going to be a problem. The cupboards in the kitchen were practically empty, and the food they had brought from the market consisted of ten rations and nothing else. They rummaged the entire ship up and down and only found expired treats and some junk food half eaten, half rotten.
He found the shower and let the water run through his punished body. The dried blood began to stain the water under his feet. The water was cold, and he shouldn’t waste much, who knew how much the ship's tanks had in reserve, and how scarce was the resource in space. He rubbed his skin carefully, and closed his eyes.
Nobody said much else after that. When they were finished eating, each one retreated back to their respective corners of the facility. Steve decided to visit the dock. He sat in a bench, staring out at the water.
Slowly, carefully, he used the laser on his right gauntlet to access the broken tank. He would have to seal the leak manually.
Steve nodded. Pepper smiled at him, always the gentle soul. Steve was sure he didn’t deserve her kindness. Maybe that was why she was so perfect for Tony, because of her forgiving heart.
Nebula used her internal computer to calculate a new path. They would have to circumvent the star half a rotation and change the angular momentum enough to use that impulse to jump to a more energetic orbit, a hyperbolic one. They would need the energy boost, and without a working engine...
He rummaged through the cupboards, looking for food. Quill was human, so something edible for Tony must have been there. He found a box that under inspection looked similar to cereal. Deciding that it was low risk, he poured himself a plate. He would had to eat them dry, because he definitely did not trust alien milk.
Tony’s heart stopped for a full minute. He stared at the screen, stunned. Did… did Steve just ask him out? And come out on twitter?
She turned around to go back to the conference room, but stopped in her tracks at the presence of a woman standing in the hallway. The stranger was a tall blonde who was dressed in a red, blue and gold combat uniform, and she looked pissed.
They quickly walked out of the room to find Bruce staring at the pager. “Whatever signal it was sending, it finally cracked out.”
The computer was reading a tank half full. The interior of the ship was illuminated by the blue hue of the star, and it was getting brighter. She heard a labored breath and approaching footsteps. Her remaining organic skin was starting to sweat.
Killing had always been an unforgivable crime. How many times had he taken a life  under the excuse of justice and the greater good? Too many to remember.
Nebula crossed her arms in her chest, one of them clearly hurting her.  “That doesn't matter. Can you do it or not?”
He ripped a piece of his destroyed shirt, folded it and inserted it inside his mouth, biting in. Tony moved the scissors closer to the skin and started to open up the wound, ordering to the nanoparts to remove themselves through the gap, slowly.
Tony contemplated deleting his account altogether for a couple of minutes. Nervous, he looked around the notifications section, and noticed one in particular that caught his attention:
Luck was never on his side. If it was, Thanos would have been more effective while stabbing him and would have aimed for his chest, finishing the job. But destiny was cruel, and vicious. If things had been easier he wouldn’t have to be agonizing on a dying planet, desperately trying to remember his first aid training, knowing it was useless while trying to perform surgery on himself.
Tony moans, his hips shifting, and Steve shivers with pride at the knowledge that he’s responsible for the reaction.
"I think that's quite enough for today," he says, packing up his papers and tablet in front of him. "We've all got a fair amount to consider after this."
his mouth, big hands wrapped around Tony’s waist and fingers digging into his flesh. Steve’s whole body is pressed up against his, and Tony can already feel the thick, solid erection under Steve’s jeans.
When it’s over, Steve’s whole body relaxes, and with a deep groan, Tony pushes forward and slides in all the way, into that welcoming, warm, slickness.
Steve’s lips are warm and dry and soft, and the kiss is barely a brush of skin before it’s over, and Tony wants it to go on and on and on.
“Maybe that’s what he wants,” argued Natasha, who had only appeared to judge him. Not even in the comfort of his own mind he was able to confront Natasha’s intimidating personality.
Darkness evolved Tony like an ocean, dragging him to its depths. The view was fantastic. But he needed to break to the surface and breathe.
She was tense, lining up the tools on the table in perfect and obsessive order. She stopped a second to stare at one of the screwdrivers.
She reached out and picked up the plate, accepting the peace offering. Tony suppressed his sigh of relief, and sat down in one of the seats next to her, cautious.
Tony’s never been able to find a partner that’s right for him. Other subs have it easier – they want to be tied down and beaten and told what to do, they want to give up control and slide down into subspace, be teased and hurt and used.
, thought it wouldn’t be like all those other times, thought maybe, just maybe, this time he could get what he needed without having to give up pieces of himself.
Steve takes a deep breath in, then nods, looking only slightly less miserable. Tony tries to push down the uneasy feeling – Steve wouldn’t have kissed him like
He wails, the sound muffled by the mask, and then breathes hard and fast through his nose, his lip tickling as a line of drool dips down his chin. His cock twitches, the plug vibrates inside him, and he can’t
“She is,” Coulson agrees with a nearly imperceptible sigh. Tony imagines Coulson would like to be in that particular scene, though he can’t figure out whether Coulson wants to take Natasha’s place or Clint’s. Or both. “So is he,” Coulson continues. “He’s one of our most sought-after subs.”
"What, is my punishment going to be to have to watch you jerk yourself off until you come in your own panties? You're gonna have to do better than that, Stark." Steve tries to sound unaffected by the sight in front of him, but he can't quite hide the note of strain in his voice, because Tony looks delectable like this.
"There, now," Tony says, resting back on his haunches enough that Steve's erection is cradled in the crease of Tony's ass. "That's better, isn't it? I could hardly hear myself think."
They don’t have enough cash for the long haul, so they both manage to pick up odd cash jobs – sweeping front stoops, unloading packages at the docks, Steve even spends a day on a fishing boat – until they have enough cash to rent an apartment. They find one for a good price in Midtown Village in Philadelphia, because it’s cheap, and none of the neighbours is going to look twice at two guys sharing an apartment, according to Tony. Steve blushes when he says it, but he can’t help but notice that the pairs of people they see on the street tend to be same-gendered, so he knows Tony is right.
"I don't know if I can wait," Tony mutters, curling his slick fingers inside Steve, pressing them against his prostate. "I've been waiting all day, after all."
, to pleasure, to whatever his Dom wants from him… it had brought him to a whole new level of subspace, a level he hadn’t known existed. And now, as he slowly rises out of it, he knows he’ll never be able to go back. Now that he knows what it’s like to sink into subspace like the comfort of a warm blanket, he doesn’t know if he’d ever be able to get there through the more
“Don’t move,” Steve commands him, and Tony whimpers. He hadn’t been, at all, but the order still has the same effect on him, and he lets out a deep breath as Steve’s hands trail up to his shoulders and start working his neck and shoulders and upper back.
There’s rock music, the rhythmic sound of slapping flesh, and moaning. Tony almost turns around and bolts down the stairs, but he doesn’t know what he’ll do if this doesn’t work, so he stays put. He
This time, Steve's laugh is a little more breathless, a little more strained. His cock pulses, a bead of pre-come gathering at the tip.
Then he’s pushing down on the small of Steve’s back, and Steve spreads his legs, his knees going out wider and he arches his back, doing what he can to make his ass look as enticing and inviting as possible, and Tony groans behind him.
Steve shivers as the last few spurts dribble out of him, over Tony’s hand, still gently stroking him through it.
A low rumbling chuckle from Steve, sweet and doting. “I was surprised when they gave it to me, too,” he says softly. “You must be – I mean, not all our clients are treated to chocolate.”
But he doesn’t need to tap out. It’s torture, it’s brutal, it’s just on the narrow line of not enough and too much, but it’s also
Steve meets Tony’s eyes, and together they hit the dials on the units strapped to their hands. Tony keeps calling it a Time GPS, but Steve thinks it deserves a weightier name than that.
looked at. He slides his thumb across the screen slowly, flicking through a couple of pictures. Each seems to get even more pornographic than the last. In one, Tony has his cock pulled all the way out of his panties, stroking it. In the next, he's on the bed on all fours, with the panties pulled partially down onto his hips so that he can pull his buttocks apart and show the tight pucker between his cheeks.
Tony bursts out laughing, and Steve feels flooded with relief. “Oh my god, I always forget what a troll you are,” he says, dropping his forehead to Steve’s chest as he laughs.
He hides in the workshop for a couple of days, rebuilding the suits that had been destroyed in that whole Killian mess. He hasn’t showered, and has been licking his wounds fueled only by coffee and spite, when Rogers comes down to the shop with a paper bag full of cheeseburgers.
It’s a long time before Steve helps Tony sit up a little, and dribbles sweet, tangy orange juice against Tony’s lips. He swallows obediently. The room is quiet, nothing but the sound of their breathing and Tony swallowing the juice.
“They know we’ve gone,” Steve says, sliding his phone away and choosing to ignore the text – and its implications – in favour of pulling one of the taco containers out of the bag on Tony’s lap. The Taxi takes off toward the tower, and Steve takes a big bite.
Steve pulls away completely, moving off Tony and tucking his underwear back into place before sitting back, on the far end of the couch.
Tony rains blows down until Steve’s ass is hot and red and twitching, until he’s used to the blunt thudding, until he’s grunting in time with each blow as though he can anticipate the rhythm.
Steve holds the rubber bulb in one hand, and reaches his other one up to Tony’s face. He gently brushes the sweaty curls from Tony’s forehead, looking partly proud and partly stern, as Tony watches him. Steve’s hand slides down his jaw, down his throat, flicks at a nipple and slides down Tony’s trembling belly until he can wrap his hand around Tony’s cock, still hard and leaking slightly.
His arm is starting to get tired, but he has no intention of finishing any time soon – instead, he’ll take a break.
“I love you,” Steve says back, bringing his arm up to press his palm against Tony’s chest. “You’re perfect, I love you.”
Tony doesn’t know what else to say, so he says nothing. He simply walks toward the door to the room and leaves, closing it behind himself as he makes his way through the corridors – echoing with sex and cries and slaps of flesh or leather on flesh – and straight out onto the dingy, dark street, toward Happy and the car and home. He’ll
He moves back over to the turkey and starts shaking containers over it, dusting the white-glooped bird with savoury smelling herbs, salt and pepper.
with it, but it’s not something he’s done, and not something he intends to do. He’s a massage therapist. He’s taken all the anatomy classes and the kinesiology classes and he’s all about the musculoskeletal relationship of pain and nerves and muscles and
by Steve has Tony tumbling down further into subspace, the descent this time rapid and dizzying, so fast Tony almost doesn’t realize how far under he’s gone.
“It’s better that you don’t need it,” he says, after swallowing a mouthful of cheeseburger. Tony hadn’t realized that taking the proffered burgers from Steve meant he’d have to
Steve laughs a little, leaning in close for another kiss, which, of course, Tony gives him. “I dunno. I like watching you blush like that.”
“Okay! Okay, sorry, I’m just… a little upside down right now,” Tony says, pushing himself up and away into a sitting position. He pulls his shirt off, and Steve glances down. He likes what he sees – the scars from Tony’s arc reactor are faint, but he can still see them. Otherwise, Tony may not be the ‘peak of human perfection’, but Steve still feels a swell of arousal low in his belly.
“Are you close?” Steve asks again, picking up the pace a little. He’s still slick, and he’s satisfied, but he wants to feel Tony come, wants to make Tony feel as good as he does right now.
He notices the reactor’s gone right away, and he stares at Tony’s chest for a long moment after he divvies up the burgers
“Rest, sweetheart,” Steve whispers, and Tony is in no shape to argue so he does, lets himself float at the bottom of his subspace, his mind quiet and empty and perfect.
“Look at you, darling,” Tony croons, his voice warm and full of love. He’s always in awe of Steve like this, the way he’s desperate for the submission, and yet his body hesitates, pushes back. “You’re beautiful.”
He holds Tony’s cock steady at the base, shifts his hips and then he slides down onto Tony’s cock in one slick slide.
Tony is lying on the bed, on his side. He's got his head propped up by one hand while the other is in front of him, fiddling with a tablet.
Tony’s heart feels heavy and light at the same time, overjoyed at Steve’s simple praise. Tony loves being good for Steve, being what Steve wants and needs.
Tony can’t think of anything to say, but it doesn’t matter because Coulson keeps up both ends of the conversation on his own.
He scoots back and leans down, licking at Steve’s stretched rim, his tongue pushing inside, and Steve moans. Then Tony pulls back, rolls and lays on his back, watching as Steve shudders once more, then twists, lifting up and swinging a leg over Tony’s thighs. Steve looks down at him, and he looks utterly debauched. His lips are pink and wet, swollen from biting them. His cheeks are flushed, his hair is damp with sweat. His eyes are wide and dark with desire. He looks like a filthy, beautiful dream.
Tony moves his hips, giving shallow little thrusts between Steve's lips. Steve keeps his lips slack and soft, letting Tony guide their speed and just flicking his tongue around the head of Tony's cock when it's in his mouth.
"Okay, honey," Tony says, pressing a kiss into Steve's hair. "Have a little sleep, we'll get up and shower in a little bit."
“I just lost a bet with Tasha, that’s all,” Clint says, sliding his empty plate into the dishwasher and heading out of the kitchen. “Dammit.”
Tony lets his wrist speed up, bringing the flogger down with a little more speed and sharpness. “Look at how you writhe for me.”
Tony does, resting his face in the opening. Steve moves over beside him, and Tony hears the lube bottle opening with a dull sound, then cool liquid is being poured into the crease of his ass, still wet and slick from Steve’s mouth.
, he knows he can’t be in 32 suits at once. He feels lonely when Romanoff and Rogers are off on a secret mission, comms dark, so he tries going out to Malibu, but he doesn’t sleep there, either. And then there’s the Mandarin, and Killian, and somehow Pepper gets roped into all of it even though they’re not even
He feels itchy and stiff in his suit, out of place at the immaculately dressed table. The table is intimate, and he’s surrounded by his team, but he feels like he doesn’t belong. He doesn’t know which fork to use. He has never in his life eaten blue foam, and he doesn’t intend to start now.
"You only beat him here because I dragged you from an earlier meeting and kept you locked in this room for 20 minutes," Coulson says mildly, not looking up from his paperwork.
“Bruce, there, is a sub,” Coulson says mildly from beside Tony. He keeps his voice quiet, almost an undertone, so as not to disturb the interested spectators. “The other one is Thor. He’s mostly a switch.”
“You are, baby, you’re so good,” Tony whispers against his skin. “I want – I need to untie you, Steve, so we can get to the bed, is that okay?”
And then, after the battle when they’re trying to transport the Tesseract and his arc reactor shorts and his heart stops, Thor uses his magic lightning hammer like a defibrillator and Loki disappears with the Tesseract, and the first thought Tony has when he’s able to breathe air back into his lungs is not of Pepper but of Steve Rogers’ glowing smile against the skyline of a bruised-but-not-broken New York, Tony knows he’s in trouble.
“You decide, honey,” Tony tells him. “It can be a lot, I know. But if you want it, Steve, I want to give it to you.”
Tony shrugs. “Better this way. We’re better at the friend thing anyway. And the most important part, the part where we’re Morgan’s parents, well, that’s never gonna change. So it’s good.”
Steve moans, shifts a little and widens his knees, giving Tony better access. Tony rewards him by nipping sharply at the top of Steve’s ass cheek, and Steve cries out, his cock throbbing in Tony’s grip. Tony chuckles low in his throat, then moves behind Steve’s body, spreads his cheeks apart and licks delicately at Steve’s hole.
Tony holds it up for him, and now Steve can see that it has three loops in total, not just one round collar, and he’s even more confused.
His appointment is supposed to last three hours. Happy is still in the car, half a block down the street. Tony is tempted to walk back, get in the back seat and leave. Happy won’t ask questions.
Steve imagines it. Some silly little lingerie, something made for a girl, and he'd be so big in it. It would stretch across his muscles and his shoulders and his chest, and it would be obscene.
Steve blinks at him. “That’s not what I was doing. Meaningless flattery, or whatever. I really do think that,” he says. “That you’re beautiful. You are. You’re lovely. That I got to do a scene with you is just…”
Steve smiles at him, and it’s that blinding, sweet, no-one-else-in-the-room-but-you smile, and Tony’s powerless against it, even though he knows he shouldn’t want it, shouldn’t crave Steve’s attention the way he does.
time they’d stolen vials from Pym’s lab, but Pym at least trusts Howard Potts enough to not worry about leaving the man alone while he runs down to the main gate to deal with a visit from a General Grant Stevenson, who is apparently ‘quite irate’ over the phone. Steve had had fun with that one.
Tony’s cock twitches, even though it should be completely spent, and his head rushes with lust. God, trust Steve to completely undo him with one question.
Tony reaches back and grabs a towel, wrapping it around his waist before stepping closer to Steve. “Seriously, that part was great,” he says. “I’m not going to, like, report you or anything. I
, Steve’s whole body tenses and braces, holding completely still for a few moments. Then he’s exploding to his feet, dropping his pencil and sketchbook, stripping off his shirt even as he steps forward within touching distance of Tony.
wants to ruin it after all these months, but he also kinda likes Steve as a friend, and the last thing he wants is for Steve to be one of
Tony's grin turns smug, and then he's pushing the panties down over his own hips. He takes his time, drawing out the action so that Steve gets a good eyeful. He steps out of the panties, hanging them from one finger as he knee walks up onto the bed, shuffling closer and closer until he can swing a leg over to straddle Steve. "But I know just how to shut you up."
Without warning, Steve’s cock jerks and spurts, a sudden orgasm that has Tony’s own balls drawing up desperately, but he maintains control and keeps hitting Steve through it as Steve wails.
Steve can’t even breathe, but he stills his hands, a punched-out groan coming from his chest. “Condoms?” he asks, shocked at the sound of his own voice. It’s like sex and whisky and pain and desperation.
“I want to make you come,” he allows himself to say, and Steve moans. “Over and over again until you can’t stand it anymore.”
“I should have explained it while I was doing it,” Steve says, petting Tony’s hair and holding him close. “I wasn’t going to hit you. I said I wouldn’t, and I meant that. The strap was to hold your legs up, Tony, that’s all.”
“Ex-wife,” he says. It sounds creaky, and he clears his throat and tries again. “Ex-wife and daughter.”
Tony knows his face is recognizable. After all, his company holds the sole government contract for nano-augments, is the leading designer of cybernetic augmentations, and is the main provider of clean energy in a world where nuclear energy has too many ghosts to be used anywhere but the poorest towns.
“Okay,” Steve says, handing him back the soldering iron. He heads for the workshop door, and the elevator. “So, tomorrow at seven. JARVIS said your calendar’s clear.”
Tony grins down at him, then crawls over to the side of the bed so he can root around in the drawer for condoms and lube.
Tony snorts, mutters “Bossy little sub, aren’t you?” and turns away from Steve, straddles his chest, backs up and tucks his calves under Steve’s bent elbows.
Tony laughs again. “Actually, now that I know you didn’t have sex with me just because I paid you to do it… Guess that means you wanted to have sex with me, too?”
“Finally, god, you tease,” Stark groans, bending the knee of his other leg and lifting it up, spreading himself open. Steve is a professional. He is a therapist, he is careful about how he acts and conducts himself with clients.
But today's meeting agenda is a long one, and he knows he's going to be tired by the time it's over. So he straightens his spine and he walks into the room as though he owns the place, just like Tony's taught him.
Tony lifts his head from the table, arches his neck and looks up, meets Steve’s eyes. They stare at each other for a long moment. It feels charged, Tony feels… something. A connection, but that could just be because this is the closest he’s felt to subspace, the closest he’s felt to quieting the storm in his mind, in so long. He feels like he should say something, but he can’t think of the words.
His body relaxes. His cock is still hard and leaking, and the toy is still vibrating in his ass, but all his muscles go slack as he puts all his trust in the ropes holding him up, the ropes
They’re in Tony’s bed, after a lovely dinner out and somehow managing to avoid the paps again. Steve is grinding his hips down into Tony’s, their erections hard and straining beneath their pants as they kiss, wildly and warmly and wantonly. Steve has one hand buried in Tony’s hair, the other clenching in arrhythmic spasms on Tony’s hip. Tony has one hand on one of Steve’s deliciously full pecs, fingers tracing the tiny bumps of his areola, and the other down the back of Steve’s jeans to squeeze and knead the muscle.
“Jarvis?” Steve says, glancing up at the ceiling – no matter how many times Tony has told him Jarvis isn’t
Tony grins back at him, glad the conversation has turned away from feelings. “Anytime, handsome. I dunno if you were counting, but you came six times. New record.”
Tony brings the paddle down again, this time on the other cheek, revelling in the way Steve’s skin goes immediately red, instantly marked under Tony’s ministrations. He’ll heal fast, but at least for the time being, Tony can lay welts and bruises where he likes.
Hot, wet, silky suction, and Steve can’t do anything but moan and redouble his efforts and shove his tongue as deeply inside Tony as it will go. It’s an echo chamber, a reverberation of pleasure – Tony sucks Steve’s cock, it makes Steve moan and lick and suck, which makes Tony moan and suck, and Steve knows, he just
Steve kisses him back, winding his arms around Tony and pulling him close. He wants to say it. Wants to tell Tony he’s amazing, that Steve can’t imagine his life without him, and that he has feelings, even if he can’t quite find the words to describe what those feelings are.
Steve's moans are short and fast now as he cries out with each thrust, and Tony's not laying a hand on his cock but like this Steve doesn't need him to. Tony usually needs more, he can't come just from being fucked alone, but Steve can – and, fuck, he's going to –
Tony takes a few more deep breaths, collecting himself and thinking of baseball stats, and then he carefully, slowly pulls back partway. He looks down, watching Steve’s hole drag along his cock, watching the skin stretch over the dildo. Then he pushes in at the hip, thrusting back inside and watching his cock push in alongside the toy.
Tony actually feels himself dip down again, just a little, at the praise. He’d thought he was all the way up, but apparently not. He’s still floating a little. He’s got mental clarity, he’s up far enough for that, but he’s still smooth and sated and satisfied.
“Well, then,” Tony smirks. He leans back a little and presses another kiss to Steve’s lips. “Guess we know where we stand.”
Then the glass dildo is at his entrance, pushing in slowly but steadily. It stretches him, past the rim and into his body, deeper and deeper until Tony can feel Steve’s fingers brush against his skin.
But. It might be nice, sometimes, to just hold Tony on the couch in the evening without it turning to sex. To just have that intimacy.
“You’re not too far off. The educational system does what it can, but that’s not the same as experiencing it,” Coulson says. They get to a door at the top of the stairs, and Coulson looks back at him. “It’s also useful for our dominant clients with a voyeuristic streak. Everyone behind these doors who isn’t staff is a client. Our clients’ privacy is sacred.”
They’ve been dating for months. It’s been so good – they’ve only had a handful of fights, and Tony has even apologized a few times, when it was unequivocally his fault, and Steve has apologized
He goes down to his knees at the side of the bed and kisses Steve, soft and slow and loving, trying to pour his feelings into it. Gratitude and love and pride, all rolled up in the press of his lips and the sweep of his tongue. Steve moans into it, so Tony lingers there for a long moment.
“You could keep yours,” Tony says, grinning at him lasciviously. “Gotta admit I don’t mind beard burn on my thighs.”
Tony moans again as Steve flips his page to a fresh one and starts sketching again. He wants Steve’s
Coulson checks the message, but he doesn't show it to Steve. He doesn't show it to anyone. He just types back a quick response, still listening studiously to Councilman Yen's impassioned but ultimately boring speech. His phone buzzes again, and Coulson reads the message. One corner of his mouth twitches almost imperceptibly, which, for Coulson, is as good as a belly-laugh. He types again, then turns his phone face down on the table.
Steve shifts experimentally. He can make fists just under and in front of his chin, but he can’t do much else with his hands.
Tony’s not even making sense, just gasping filthy nonsense words as his hips jerk and hot streaks of white come land on Steve’s chest. Steve shivers, knowing he should be embarrassed, that he should feel humiliated that Tony had called them ‘tits’, but his body desperately tries to react with desire or orgasm or both. It can’t, it really can’t because he’s spent, he’s so spent all he can do is lie there and let Tony come on him, claim him and mark him and
“I insist,” he says. “I’m the client, we’re here on my dime, and I insist.” He grins to take the sting out of the words.
They spend hours cooking. There’s nalysnyky for Natasha, green bean casserole for Bruce, and cranberries and stuffing for Clint. They hadn’t been able to replicate any Asgardian recipes for Thor, but Steve had managed a beautiful pork belly dressed in pineapples and maraschino cherries that went in the second oven a couple of hours after the turkey.
Stark turns over, and Steve’s eyes flick to his face. He’s got his eyes closed, thank god, but his mouth is slightly open, his lips pink and slick and glossy. His throat bobs as he swallows, and Steve drapes the towel over Stark’s hips, and nearly chokes on his own tongue at the sight of Stark’s erection tenting the terry fabric.
Steve sighs, and this time it sounds less like he’d like the earth to swallow him, and more fond, and Tony knows how to take a win. “Three or four,” Steve says.
He sat next to her and with a knot in his chest and opened his twitter account, where less than a couple of minutes ago he had furiously announced to the world that he was bisexual. And in the most
Hours later they were all reunited around a holographic table that displayed a map of the entire world. The numbers of missing people (dead, they were dead) were rising by the second on the screen. Bruce had taken the pager and connected it to a powerful battery, making it repeat it’s message again and again.
After half an hour, Tony decided he had had enough. He walked out of the cantina and leaned against the outside wall. It was getting dark, and the sky looked a greyish green over the horizon. The atmosphere of that moon probably had a higher concentration of phosphorus rather than oxygen. It was fine. He was accustomed to the 20-80 ratio of nitrogen and oxygen on earth. He should be able to breath fine, right?
Nebula didn’t care. She laughed at the poor fucker’s face. “I didn’t kill your bitch,” she mocked. “Collect your debts with the creature who owes them.”
He probably would never admit it, but Steve though Tony was an artist. Yes, he was a brilliant engineer and scientist, but what he could do with a sketching pencil and some paper? or maybe just a holographic display? That was pure art. Engines, buildings, computers, planes,  even parks. Tony was a designer, and a very good one. His armors, fuck. Just thinking about them made Steve’s heart flutter. The hard exterior, the shining surface, the perfect curves, the smooth finish. And most importantly, the man on the inside.
They had barely enough fuel to power the life support systems. The main computer was fried. They had jumped on a path to earth but they didn’t have enough fuel to make the entire way there. They hadn’t really moved that much at all.
To say the Wakandan people were angry at them was an understatement. To the eyes of the civilians, their arrival on their country had only meant death and destruction. They had lost their king, their princess, countless soldiers, and half their population.They were invaders, destroyers of peace.
He was so tired. He hadn’t felt truly exhausted since the day he had been injected with the supersoldier serum. But these days, after everything had been lost, he felt like his body was a prison. His mind run on autopilot, stunned, frozen on a single moment in time and space. Lost.
“You really are blind, Stark,” said Nebula, but not unkindly. She seemed curious, probably trying to imagine the picture he was describing.
She stayed there with him for some minutes, staring out of the horizon. All they did lately was stare out of the window and wait for his imminent death.
Bruce and Thor were as quiet as the rest of them. Steve was sure he had never seen Thor so out of it in all the years they’ve known each other. He was a completely different man. Gloomy, introverted, sad. He was broken.
“HEY, THAT LITTLE PIECE OF SHIT STOLE MY WALLET,” screamed Tony into the crowd. Around five or six different individuals immediately started to run in different directions, pushing people and causing unrest. People turned around their heads, looking for the source of trouble. Some of them started heated arguments. A couple of vendors started a fight in the middle of the street.
“I told you to stay close,” she reprimanded him. Tony followed her with clumsy steps, alarmed. She dropped her grip on his arm and pulled the hood of the cape over her head. They walked a few meters until they reached a small market. The trading post. An endless line of small shops and tents with different kinds of products of the most bizarre things Tony had ever seen in his life. Alien food, clothes for creatures with numerous extremities, furniture with a sort of radioactive glow to it, strange tech that seemed centuries more advanced to anything on earth but ancient at the same time.
“I’m not an idiot, I know this is a worst case scenario. But I was going to marry Tony Stark,” she whispered. “It’s not like I wasn’t prepared for the worst. Have been for years.”
“A tea, maybe?” asked Pepper. Steve shook his head. Rhodey nodded and left to the kitchen. Pepper then sighed. “He thinks I’m deluding myself. But I know what I’m talking about. Tony isn’t dead.”
He was sure she didn’t mocked him because she was too concentrated on the ship’s controls. Or maybe she was already starting to warm up to him.
Maybe it was true, what he said about the balance. Maybe you can only get so much power if you are incredibly foolish.
Maybe sitting on that bed had been a bad idea. Memories of Tony and him laughing and messing around like two teenagers in love flooded his mind, and Steve almost drowned on them. He had been so foolish then. He remembered thinking that was the begining of happiness, that was where it all began. Things would only get better from then on. But that wasn’t the beginning, that
Seconds later, she activated a shield behind his back, protecting the oxygen of the ship, and slowly opened the landing pad where Tony would exit into fucking outer space. Neil Armstrong his ass.
He felt bad, invading the compound like this. The place he had once called home, for a brief period of time. But now, everywhere he looked he saw Sam, laughing in the common room at Natasha’s jokes. He saw Wanda, painting her nails in the kitchen, keeping Vision company. He saw Tony, back from the city after a busy week, inviting him a drink with a wicked smile.
He was starting to sweat. Soon the temperature would be unbearable to his human body, and he didn’t have enough of the armor to cover him entirely.
Nebula looked towards the window of the ship, away from him. Tony understood her need not to show vulnerability at any cost.
After using the toilet he stayed in the bathroom for a few minutes, looking at himself in the mirror. Confronting himself.
“Hey, you, bitch!” screamed one of the men from the corner, and Tony froze in his place. Nebula turned to them baring her teeth, feral. “Aren't you one of Thanos’ bastards?”
Steve didn’t have the heart to explain to her that even if everyone’s odds of surviving had been fifty-fifty, Tony’s were probably much lower. He had gone to utter space to fight Thanos, and Thanos had clearly won the battle. If Steve knew Tony at least a little bit, he knew he had done everything in his power to prevent that from happening. Thanos’ arrival to Earth could only mean one thing.
Tony took advantage of the chaos and jumped right to the speeder bikes parked a few meters away from them. He jumped on the first one and looked for any indication of an activation mechanism. He couldn't find anything. If he had to guess, the vehicle probably worked with a specific code to be able to start the engine. It was time to solve it the old fashion way.
The ringing of his phone woke Steve from a nightmare. He wasn’t very pleased, it wasn’t like the real world was a better reality. He growled and turned on his bed, tapping on the bedside table to find the hellish device. He picked up without looking who was calling at four am in the fucking morning.
They reached their point of desperation two days before water would run out completely. Nebula was more talkative than ever, but Tony was completely unable to understand her or register her words. They were going to die, and there was nothing he could do about it.
“There’s a jump point forty degrees up zenit,” Nebula indicated him when they finally started to ascend.
Like memories, dreams had no beginning. Maybe an image was already there. A little boy, cheerful and bubbly. His face covered with a plastic mask. An Iron Man mask. Tony would fall on his knees in front of him, his eyes filled with tears. With shaking hands, he’d take off the mask from the kid’s face.
Nebula exited the cantina by kicking the door with her boots, staggering around until she reached him. She smelled like alcohol poisoning. She somehow seemed angrier at his general existence.
She had to restart the computer. There was a very strong possibility that it wouldn't turn back up again, and that would certainly mean the end. But she had no alternative.
His anger would morph into sadness, fast like lightning. He would hide in one of the ship’s cabins, he would cry for hours on end. Then, he would fall asleep for an entire day, but never enough to regain energy. He was always tired. And the cycle would repeat.
Steve had no idea what to respond to that. She petted her skirt with her hands, probably trying to soothe herself.
Tony had never considered a different sky, with different colors or different stars. The sidereal space was one of those concepts that you never consider change being a part of it. Even when learning about astronomy, times of change were so incredibly slow on a human scale that considering different stars to the ones he knew or could see were just part of his imagination. Or a computer simulation. Never
Nebula seemed like the kind of creature that enjoyed silence. Her posture was always stiff, her expression twisted in a permanent aggressive gesture. But her eyes were sad. There, behind her mean demeanour and cold exterior, Tony could see the kind of sadness that accumulates for decades, rotting the insides of her.
There were hundreds more like that. Some were indecipherable for Tony, but he got the positive vibe from the majority of the replies. The deep anxiety in his gut didn’t fade away, but he did feel relieved. He looked up and found Pepper smiling at him.
But what he had just done? Political suicide. There was no way to recover from this. Humiliation poisoned him inside.
One afternoon, he had this realizing thought. Nobody on earth would ever know what had happened to him. He would be lost in history, like a sailor who had set sail on the high seas and had never returned.
The ship crossed the atmosphere and Tony saw the jump point straight ahead of them. They crossed the jump and the ship entered hyperspace.
Nebula activated the engine and hit the gas to maximum impulse. They shifted the angle, and the acceleration was so strong Tony’s body was compressed back into his seat.
“I had other things in mind,” he supplied as excuse. Natasa smiled at him, slowly, entirely lacking joy.
His heart was beating a million kilometers per hour. His fingers felt cold and trembling. The pit of his stomach began to tighten with vertigo. The severity of what he had done slowly dispersed in his consciousness, like adrenaline rushing through his veins.
In the same way that growing up on the spotlight had transformed him into a circus act, dominating the political field from the shadows had been something his father had been expert at, but never Tony. No, Tony was a showman, pragmatic. Politics and bureaucracy were very far from his interests.
“Are you going somewhere?” asked Steve, worried. Natasha ignored him. He sighed, tired of her attitude.
Tony sat up straighter, and his entire field of view spun around like a rollercoaster. “I’m alright.”
Some of them had their blasters out, pointing at Nebula’s head. Shit. They had probably recognized her.
He closed his eyes, and for a moment, allowed himself to hate her. Just a second. Then, he smiled to her.
“Peter…?” would ask Tony, holding the little kid’s hands. He felt lost, holding an imaginary friend from his childhood. He would understand then: that small and brave kid from the Stark Expo all those years ago. His path had always been intertwined with Tony’s. Loving him like his own had been simply fate.
“You could try sending a message,” said Bruce. Tony smiled, and tuned to see him sitting by the copilot seat, more relaxed than he had ever seen him.
When he finished closing his wounds, Tony left all the instruments on the table and closed his eyes. He needed to go to the regenerating chamber, that according to Nebula would heal his internal wounds. He thought about Helen and her miraculous cradle, and asked himself if she would still be alive. If any of his friends was still alive: Happy, Rhodey, oh no,
Being born in a golden cradle had opened infinite doors, given him the opportunity to get up one day and decide that he wanted to build a colony on Mars and virtually no one could say no. But the power that money gave him was a double-edged sword.
. Using the laser to melt the metal was going to end up in flames. He couldn't use tape to seal a fuel tank, they were going to need a reliable fix if they were to ever jump back into hyperspace. He needed a material that would hold up the temperature and the pressure difference….
Tony knew all the constellations. He had his favorites: Orion and his companion dog, Canis Majoris. Bright and protective of the winter sky, they made the perfect company.
That would leave him defenseless. What if Nebula decided he was too much of a liability and sliced him in half with her swords?
He allowed himself a moment to get his shit back together, and then went back to Nebula. She was waiting for him in the entrance of the alley, looking bored.
Tony dropped his knees to the ground and inspected the speeder’s engine. He fidgeted around with cables and tubes until he found what he was looking for. He took out two specific cables and pulled them together by the ends, trying to make the circuit start. He tried a couple of times until he heard the hum of the engine starting.
He cleared his throat to make his presence known, and they turned to look at him. Pepper smiled at him, sweetly.
After a long fight where Nebula almost tore Tony's head off, they ended up deciding to stop the course of the ship and reserve the last of the emergency fuel. They would continue on course for a few more light-years, product of the inertia of the ship, but after a few days they would inevitably stop product of the forces of radiation and gravity pulling on them from every direction.
Steve nodded, understanding. Rhodey went down to the garage and left, effectively leaving Steve alone.
That seemed to wake her up instantly. She sat up straighter, blinked a couple of times, and quickly began typing on the computer’s terminal. Diagnostics run through the screen and Tony tried to gather information from what he was seeing.
But Nebula was already walking away. Tony used those seconds where she had her back to him to look back to the mess of bodies and silently mourn for his outburst. He didn’t regret killing that man and saving her, but
Maybe this was what she needed, after all. A little bit of fire, danger and adrenaline. And she was also piss drunk.
“Two things: it’s 2018, the political morality is dominated by allies of the LGBT community, and the internet is the domain of the community. If you had said this at a press conference, the result would have been different, because you would be giving the media the monopoly on how they build the narrative. But on twitter?
The temperature was raising. At least two Kelvin degrees by the minute. That meant they were getting closer and closer. Time was running out.
He rolled his eyes and sat down next to her. She turned her nose away from him with a grimace, and Steve had the decency of feeling ashamed.
It would be weeks before some pirate ship of random Nova Corp passed them and noticed them. They didn't have weeks.
Dreams were confusing. Tony couldn't remember most of them. They felt like an access to a different reality, one were he was only a mere spectator of his own sins. Dreaming felt like being in free fall: liberating, filled with adrenaline and joy, terrifying. The entire universe was within his grasp and yet, he was insignificant.
“A hundred credits!” the vendor said encouragingly. Tony almost choked on air. Fuck he missed being a billionaire. He never thought he’d miss his Amex gold card while stranded on an alien moon. But before Tony could start to consider the investment, a movement deeper inside the alley catched his attention.
He was amazingly young, and beautiful like a blooming flower. His eyes shined like newborn stars. There were a couple of teeth missing on his charming smile.
Very quickly he calculated the estimated velocity they had to be moving and the relative distance to the star taking into account the interdimensional distortion of the hyperspace lane. He had learned a lot from Jane Foster’s papers on interdimensional travel, Asgardian technology and hyperspace. He assumed the same principles were applicable.
Nebula indicated the ship’s computer to make the jump and come out of hyperspace. The jump was rough indeed. Tony almost flew through the cockpit to the ship’s main hall, but managed stay on his feet by grabbing a pipe.
He wished he could return the sentiment. Not because he wanted her dead, not at all, but because it was hard for him to feel anything besides defeat, guilt, and sadness.
It was Tony, Steve was sure of it. Pepper had been right. This was a signal. He had left something behind to be contacted with. Now they just needed to find him.
Tony ran the palms of his hands over his wounds. The agonizing pain had stopped, his internal organs no longer felt on fire. The scar on his abdomen would probably last forever. One more for the collection.
“Tony’s smart, Steve,” reminded him Rhodey, who had been silent until then. “He found a way to come back from the death twice already.”
Tony went back to the bar and saw Nebula chugging  aggressively her third drink, judging by the two empty glasses by her elbow. Poor girl, though Tony. Drowning quicky down that path. He walked to the bar and sat next to her with a sigh. She ignored him and ordered another drink.
Tony would sometimes get angry: he would hit the walls with his fists, furious. He didn’t have much energy inside of him. He ended up breaking a couple of fingers. Furious with himself, with his pathetic body, with his useless legs, with hunger, with thirst.
Steve was there, standing in all his glory. He was wearing a white button up shirt, comfortable jeans, and he was barefoot. His hair was a little long at the front, and he was clean shaven.
Steve had made peace with his feelings for Tony years ago. He was aware that his opportunity had passed. But sometimes he couldn’t help but wonder what would have been like, if he had said yes. If he had just said fucking yes, that lazy night when Tony, sleepy and satisfied on top of his naked chest, had asked him if he wanted to take the next step, make their
“There was…” she drifted off and read more of the information on the screens, clearly experiencing difficulty articulating a complete sentence. Tony had never seen her like this.
He couldn't stop thinking about Tony. He was everywhere he looked. That place, that beautiful wooden platform by the shore of the lake had been personally designed by him. Of course it was. Everything Tony designed was beautiful.
“Coffee?” offered Bruce, placatory. Steve nodded and sat down next to Thor, who only looked at him briefly to acknowledge his existence.
“That's it! Quantum entanglement is instantaneous! If you alter one of the paired particles the change on the other is instantaneous no matter of they're on the other side of the universe!”
He had been learning about addictions in school, and he was a smart kid. He had figured out why Tony always opted out for a soda when Pepper, Rhodey and his Aunt drank wine on their small family dinners.
. With a sigh, Tony fixed the hood of his cape over his head and started to walk the market, looking for a food stall. A group of kids ran past him, knocking him around, and he covered his pockets. When he finally found a food vendor who wasn't too sketchy looking, he picked up a dozen of those ration bars that looked similar to those that he had found inside the Guardian’s ship. Satisfied, he started to walk back to their meeting point.
After she was finished with her bag and got up from the table, Steve addressed Natasha again: “Are you going somewhere?”
His field of vision was getting lighter and lighter. Tony turned around one second and regretted it immediately: the star was close enough to burn itself on his retinas.
Tony lifted both arms in the air in surrender. She glared at him, clearly pissed off, and put down her weapon.
“Good luck,” he wished Natasha, and there was something in his godly voice that made that sentence feel like a blessing. For the first time in weeks, Steve saw Natasha smile.
He could feel the other’s stares on his back. Steve knew they thought he was delusional. He understood now how alone Pepper must have been feeling.
They left Titan behind with his heart in his stomach. Nebula put them on course in a hyperspace line on the way to who knew where. She had told Tony that they needed supplies and fast, so they were probably going to some trading post. When the course was stable, Nebula got up from the seat and went silently to the ship's cabins. For once, Tony appreciated the loneliness.
After a couple of hours, Steve went back to the main building. On his way upstairs, he heard voices coming from the living room, so he made his way towards them. He found Rhodey and Pepper, sitting together on one of the couches, talking agitatedly. The closer Steve got, the more he noticed some details. There was a box of books, pictures, and some papers on the coffee table. Rhodey looked like he hadn’t slept in days. Pepper’s eyes and nose were red, like she had been crying very recently.
There’s the night Tony ends up with a hand cramp from fingering Steve, two fingers deep inside him and playing his prostate like a violin, and Steve’s only come 3 times before Tony has to switch hands. He’s ambidextrous, though, so they make it work. By the end of the night, Tony is fucking Steve’s throat while he sucks Steve down in a 69 position (Tony’s definitely too old for 69s but the feeling of Steve’s mouth around his erection is divine, and he’s not ready to stop making Steve make those little moans of pleasure and desperation so what
Tony leans down, presses a kiss against Steve’s back. Steve pushes back against him, and Tony bites the muscled flesh. Steve clenches and thrusts back, and Tony kisses the bruising bite, knowing it will be gone in no time.
“Oh, honey, yes,” he breathes, very deliberately putting the lube and condoms down beside Steve’s elbow. “I can do that, if you want me to.”
Tony nods, not at all doubting Cage’s ability to remove him, or anyone else, from the premises. The guy is huge. The thought gives him a brief respite from hysterically wondering how uncomfortable the strange dom he’s about to see is going to feel trying to fulfill his requests. He tries to shake it off – he’d filled out the questionnaire, filled in the special request form. Whoever he’s booked in with already knows the deal.
“That’s it, sweetheart,” Steve murmurs, leaning forward and resting his forehead against Tony’s. Tony sighs happily at the heat of Steve’s skin. “That’s it, you’re beautiful like this.”
He curls his fingers, rubbing against the tenderness of Stark’s prostate, loving the way Stark’s cock throbs in his other hand and the way Stark’s whole body jerks on the table.
"That's better, isn't it, baby?" Tony lies down beside Steve and sighs in his ear, letting his breath out hot and damp. "Don't you wish you'd answered your phone?"
Steve somehow blushes harder. “Yeah. It’s kind of… It’s a lot to deal with, is all I’m saying. And I just want you to know that just because I’m, you know, still… I just don’t want you to think you did something wrong.”
Tony swallows, and stares at the dildo with a mixture of hunger and concern, even as he feels his mind quiet, settling a little further down into subspace.
“Thank you,” Tony says, finally, after a beat. “This was… I’ve never had this before. Never made it that far into subspace, and never gone down so easily. You’re very… talented.”
Sure enough, Tony is true to form. He stands at the foot of the bed, staring at Steve, looking up and down his body as he reaches into the red panties he's wearing and starts to touch himself. He starts with teasing strokes, at first – a loose grip stroking up and down, then letting go of himself to massage his balls. Steve watches hungrily as Tony's cock responds to his own touch, hardening and plumping, the head slipping out the waistband of his panties as he grows to full erection.
“Fuck, yes, please,” Stark moans, and Steve fucks into him with his fingers, stroking and pumping at his cock with his other hand. Stark’s whole body bows off the table, arching and tensing with pleasure, and the sight is gorgeous to Steve. He can’t keep his own moan of pleasure in while he fingers Stark and jerks him off.
Tony moans, pushes closer until their hips touch, until their erections are pressed up against one another, until every grind and shift of his hips is a tease to Steve’s cock.
Things are just starting to not be at all interesting when Steve's phone vibrates, rather loudly, in his pocket. He's glad he'd remembered to silence the ringer.
like this. His toned muscles, his smooth skin, the way the light of the reactor highlights the dips and valleys of his body. His hips are turned just enough to give Steve a hint of his gorgeous, perfectly rounded rear.
“She’s very good,” Tony says, wondering if she’s the one he’s supposed to have an appointment with. He’d put on his intake form that he didn’t like pain play, and that he wasn’t particular about gender, but maybe Natasha had other talents. Tony imagines she could put nearly any sub deeply into subspace, no matter their preferences.
“Please, please,” he murmurs, eyes squeezed shut. His hands wring around the iron, the pebbled texture of it digging into his palms.
Tony starts a gentle rhythm, thrusting deep into Steve’s body with each slow thrust. Steve sighs in pleasure, cock swinging hard and full under his belly. Each thrust slides Tony’s cock over his prostate, and Tony keeps leaning forward to pepper kisses across Steve’s back, his hands sliding over Steve’s hips and waist.
Tony moans loudly when Steve’s hands dig into the meat of his cheeks, pushing and massaging at sore muscles there.
There’s a ring of padding at the head of it, and Tony knows that’s where his face is supposed to go. He doesn’t know what’s going to happen. The forms had been thorough, so there are a lot of possibilities. He moves over to the table, cheeks flushed, and lies down on it, resting his face in the opening. The table is very long, and Tony’s feet don’t come anywhere near the end – there’s probably room for a whole other person there.
They were adrift. Without direction, without current, without a map. Maybe it was time to accept that they had been lost for weeks.
“Don’t we all,” she sighed and reclined back on the couch. Steve followed her movement with his eyes. “You should rest. I know you haven't been sleeping.”
“He would make us fight each other. Every time I lost he would replace a piece of my body. And Gamora won
…” she kept saying, and he looked at her with resentment. Tony knew she was right, but he’d never admit it. “I have to go to a meeting, please do not provoke another scandal before we clarify this one, yes?”
“Going blind on three, two, one-” she hit enter and all the lights on the Benatar turned off. “Good luck.”
“We have a problem,” he explained. “We have to fix the tank right now, or we’re going to lose all our fuel in less than two hours.”
A group of men were surrounding a hooded figure, laughing among themselves. They seemed excited about something.
He shifted and started to apply the same treatment to the open wound of his back, practically blind. The intense burning of the wound guided him like a lighthouse at sea, but he was scared of hurting healthy skin anyway.
Pepper was a wonderful woman, and in more than one aspect, she was everything Tony needed. But Steve was sure she wasn’t everything he wanted.
“We have a couple of hours until we can collect the ship from the shop,” she informed him. “Is there anything you feel it’s absolutely necessary before we go? It’s a long trip.”
The fruit in question looked so red, so big and vivid that Tony was sure it had been genetically modified. It looked photoshopped, straight out of a commercial. Like the perfect GMO.
He extended the hand covered in a gauntlet and covered the fuel tank with it. He ordered the nannities to seal the gap.
Tony knew she was right, probably more than she realized. He had been blind about everything. He had been arrogant, and selfish. He had let his own hurt dominate his path. A
And treacherous. The sky that was visible from the windows of the Guardian’s ship had different stars. Constellations of another civilization. He felt like a foreigner, lost with a map in another language he didn’t understand. Far away was his beloved Betelgeuse, the proud Sirius, the furious Antares. Or maybe they were very close. He would never be able to know.
“I was just bringing some of Tony’s stuff to Bruce,” she explained, gesturing to the box full of mementos. “He said it could help him find Tony faster.”
Tony got up from the chair abruptly, walking in circles around the chair. He approached the huge picture window of the apartment, and observed the city somberly, feeling like a movie character, brooding into the distance. The city was noisy, chaotic, gray, familiar. An entanglement of circulations and crossed roads, high walls to the sky, eternal itineraries. Chaos in its purest state, chaos from which creation is born. He had rarely thought about the longing for anonymity, the idea of being one of the bunch.
It wasn’t the first time and it probably wouldn’t be the last. But after what happened, after what Thanos had done, after everything they lost. It felt like an unforgivable crime.
“You’re human, and I’m the daughter of Thanos. You’re food to most creatures here, and there’s a bounty of a million credits for my head,” she said, like someone who chats about the weather. “Probably more now, after what happened. Keep your head down and stay close if you want to keep it.”
Nebula rolled her eyes, but gestured him to follow her. She guided him through the crow for a couple of blocks until they reached a nasty looking, hole-in-the-wall bar by the edge of the town. Without preamble, she entered with firm steps. Tony was sure he had seen nastier places back in the day, when his liver was twenty years younger and his self preservation instincts were strictly non existent.
She looked ready to jump him and choke him with the seatbelt for his insolence. Luckily, she seemed to decide against it, and simply rolled her eyes.
There was no denying it, Tony was scared. He had been in the act for years, he was not ready to let go. No, that was a lie. He had been ready for decades, but he did not want to face reality and the consequences of abandoning it.
Love was a muscle. One that needed constant exercise. Jarvis had taught him what unconditional love felt like, and part of that was why he resented his father so much. He had been blessed and cursed because he had an actual parameter of comparison. Every time Howard ignored, scoffed or insulted his mere existence, the pain felt ten times worse because thanks to Jarvis, he knew how a good father should behave.
Tony hopped on the speeder, made the engine roar with acceleration, and screamed: “HEY!” at Nebula, who was currently stabbing two men at the same time with her sword. She turned around, pulled her weapon from their bodies, who dropped to the ground like rag dolls, and ran to him. Once she was behind him on the speeder, Tony released the brake and they flew on a straight line over the sandy road of the market.
Tony turned around, startled. Nebula entered the cockpit with heavy steps and obvious difficulty. She sat on the floor in front of him, and watched Tony closely, almost rudely.
Tony threw the scissors on the table and looked for the stapler. If it was inside a first aid kit that should mean it was for surgical use, and he hoped it was biodegradable because the last thing he needed was metal poisoning. He curved his back so the position of his body could allow to join the edges of the wound. He put the stapler against his skin, and closing his eyes, he pushed.
Clint started to laugh with joy. Bruce shook his head, smiling widely. Natasha amd Thor had already vanished.
Rhodey had been on the phone the entire flight. He had said he needed to make some arrangements, and then proceed to ignore them the entire time. It was him who had been able to negotiate their return to american soil. It had seemed like an easy task, now that half the government officials who hated them were gone. But maybe after their failure, they had actually doubled.
She stared at him for a moment, then shook her head. She arranged the papers she carried in her arms and sat down in the chair next to Tony’s computer.
“Because,” whispered Thor, and his voice reverberated on Tony's chest, “the Mark 50 is equipped with a quantum computer.”
Hallucination Steve had a point. Tony had spent the last decade reshaping his legacy into something he could be proud of. But there was nothing else he could do, stuck in a broken spaceship, adrift into interstellar space.
They had launched themselves on an interstellar trip without enough fuel. It wasn’t like they had another alternative either. They didn’t have much food, nor did they have much water. Both of them were injured, frustrated, depressed.
“Tony, you have 85 million followers on twitter, you must know your audience!” She rolled her eyes, but her smile was fond.
“We need to divert the trajectory in a wide enough angle so we fall into a hyperbolic orbit-” started Tony, and Nebula nodded along.
He had been scared, then. Dates and years would say differently, but Tony was a good fifteen years older than him. He was decidedly on a different stage of life. He had wanted to settle down, get married, have a kid, even if he wasn’t able to admit it to himself then. And Steve had been terrified of that. He hadn’t figured out what he wanted to do with his own life, less alone what to do sharing one with someone else. And Tony wouldn't wait around for him to figure it out.
The wakanadan fields extended over the horizon. The sun kissed the vast plantations and the trees danced along with the whisper of the wind. For the second time in his life, Steve felt like an invader on a sacred place, violating the peace with his mere presence. It had been three days since the battle. It felt like a century had gone by.
Sometimes Tony dreamed. Most of the time he slept in silence, his mind calm in a state of white noise. But sometimes, a dream consumed him until there was nothing left of him except for his bones.
“Get food supplies. Terrans can digest most standard ration bars, so buy those.” She reached into one of Tony’s cape’s pockets and dropped a couple of credits. “Don’t talk to anyone, don’t look anyone in the eyes, don’t breathe too loudly. Don’t die.”
The lights turned on and illuminated the inside of the ship. Nebula jumped to the computer and entered the calculated flying path for the new orbit.
“Fury did,” sentenced Natasha. “Tell me the second you get a signal. I wanna know who’s on the other end of that thing.”
Maybe they would have lost anyway. Thanos was like a natural force, absolutely inevitable, and apparently impossible to stop. What frustrated him the most was not understanding. How could such a stupid being come to possess so much power? Were there no laws in the universe that prevented it? His plan was simply stupid. Humanity had reached seven billion inhabitants in only two hundred years, reducing them to three point five billions would only delay the same process a hundred more. And if overpopulation was a universal problem, then the patterns of population growth were also. Thanos was just kicking the problem forward for a few years instead of offering a real solution. And committing genocide in the process. The Mad Titan. Thanos, the genocidal.
After a while, Steve left. He retrieved to his quarters and sat down on his bed, exhausted. He hadn’t done anything physically demanding, but he felt tired deep in his bones.
They zigzagged around stalls, people, and moving vehicles. Tony could hear the men behind them, following them on their own speeders and shooting at them. He maneuvered around a corner, trying to duck the fire. And strangely enough, Nebula was laughing.
Never in his life had he felt so ashamed. The defeat, the anguish, the humiliation, were like regurgitating acid at the bottom of his stomach. His mind kept turning, if he had done this and that differently, if he had planned things better, if he had been smarter, less arrogant, faster...
Tony, strangely, thought of his mother. Trapped in an unhappy marriage, with a son who didn’t value her enough, lonely by the corners of a giant  and empty mansion. Guarding a nest that would remain empty for all eternity, after pushing out her child far too soon. Tony wondered if she had known how much he had loved her, despite the bitterness and resentment.
Tony shook his head. “It’s a risk we’ll have to take. We’re close enough to be already trapped by the star’s gravitational pull. We need to be able to see where are we going and how are we going to fix it.”
“-so we use the kinetic energy to be blasted back into interstellar space,” she completed. “Genius.”
Pepper insisted strongly before he could interrupt her. “Take a second to read what most people, your fans, are responding.”
“Not biologically, no,” the constant state of dullness in his head allowed him to speak without fear. It was like being drunk: he understood the words he said a second after they had left his mouth. He had no control or filter, but he was not ashamed either. “But I loved him like he was.”
