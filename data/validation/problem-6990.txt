“Oh baby that’s perfect. Thank you.” Steve was nearly sobbing as Tony started to work him over. Pure pleasure shot upwards from his hips to his spine, adding to the sensations of playing with his nipples, it made his Head spin
Tony ground his hips again, breath hitching with how good it felt. He kept this up for a bit more, and then uncuffed Steve.
Steve’s jaw dropped, and he scrambled to find his phone. He had to hear from Tony, he would be okay, right ?
“Where am I? Why did you bring me here?” Tony demanded to know. The man put a tray with bread and water in front of Tony.
Steve couldn’t hold back a whimper at the thought of the other guy working himself open, as if Steve was really going to be there to fuck him.
“I saw posters for a theatre show on the way, do you want to go and see if we can get tickets?” Tony proposed.
“Hmmm, taste like bubblegum.” He smiled, short from hopping up and down his chair. He then grabbed a waffle and dipped it in the whipped cream, Steve following his lead.
“Not really, well... It is my business, but mostly that of my boyfriend. “ Tony said, and when Loki just stared at him blankly, he looked over his sunglasses.”Steve Rogers, the artist?”
"I thought my good boy deserves a treat." Steve grinned. "Oh, yes yes yes yes." The brunet said, eyes wide.
Another slap to Steve's ass, tearing a moan from his throat and making him really push down Tony's throat now, feeling the burning hot coil in his stomach grow even hotter and tighter. He chased his orgasm, hips hammering against Tony's face, until he came with a gasp, until Tony shuddered through an orgasm , moaning around Steve's cock.
“Hey handsome.” Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck. A large hand trailing up his thigh and squeezing at that pert ass.
As if agreed upon before meeting each other, they started heading inside together. Tony led them to the penthouse and poured them some whisky, then he started to talk.
“Not if they put the company in a bad light, like so many times before, and now he’s spotted with a guy!”
Tony  couldn’t stop smiling, and he giggled as he offered Steve a chocolate covered strawberry on the way home. Earning him a kiss and a strawberry in return.
“Of course you will Steve, he's gonna get home safe and sound, just you wait.” He whispered to his best friend.
“It’s the best.” Tony  gushed.”it’s every flavour you could possibly want. Ice in every colour.  It’s huge and it’s glorious.”
‘I’m leaving for a business trip but I wanted to give you something to look at during the hours I ‘m in the air so…’
Oh, so Steve had been aroused by one of his models, and the poor guy was obviously embarrassed by it.
He was awoken the next morning by his phone pinging multiple times, he tiredly rubbed his eyes and grabbed his phone.
“Very well, maybe you'll think differently after not having eaten for a few days. “ the man said, taking the food before he left the room again.
Tony had been acting jittery and out of it all week. It had Steve worried, especially since he never seemed to be able to get Tony alone for some... Stress relief...
“I’ll take that as a yes.” Tony said breathlessly. Steve smiled and cupped Tony’s cheek, gently caressing him with his thumb. He felt Tony lean into the touch.
“Even though the sex was more than great.” Steve said with half a smile.  Bucky rubbed calming circles into Steve’s back. “But a relationship? No way.”
Tony pressed another kiss to those rock cut abs , before wrapping his lips around the head of Steve’s cock.

“I get that you need a distraction, Steve. But why don’t we go out tonight and hang out , huh? Just take a break. “Natasha  proposed.
“i know you've been worried and all that but I was kinda hoping we could play? Really get my mind of things...” he curled into himself, arms around his body and head low, as if he didn’t know if he could ask for it . (of course he could, Steve’d do anything for Tony at this point.)
“I see that hit a nerve, are we willing to work along now, Mr Stark?” the man smiled, tipping Tony’s chin up.
Tony sucked in a breath, because these  piercing emerald green eyes and raven locks certainly were beautiful. He could totally see how Steve would get aroused by this gorgeous man, hell, Tony was intrigued too.
When he had perched Steve onto the bed, the brunet happily got his surprise from the nightstand, before crowding into the blond’s space .
“Not weird, I think it’s beautiful and a great idea.” Steve said. “Let’s do that, Tony. Once all my stuff is put away, let’s go see our parents.”
“i’m so giving you the best blowjob of your life once we get into the shower.”he promised, making Steve laugh.
Steve groaned when Tony’s cock slipped in right as he gently placed a hand over Loki’s nek. Loki moaned loudly and shivered, his hands flying up to grab Steve’s wrist.
“hmm how about we play with the dildo, huh?”  he grinned teasingly at Tony. The genius returned the grin with a mischievous glint in his eyes.
Tony hung up, and an instant later there was an incoming video call. Steve took the time to look at Tony, he had a split lip and a bruise under his eye and on his collarbone.
“Sweetheart?” tiny kisses on his cheek. Tony shuddered, feeling sensitive all over, but that could be because Steve was playing with his nipples too.
“hmmhmm never happened before.” Tony nodded, and Steve couldn’t help the goofy smile taking over his face. All right, maybe he was a bit smug for making Tony feel so good he’d slipped into another language entirely.
“Begging for it , huh?” Tony grinned, gently blowing on the head of the erection. The cock twitched and Tony chuckled as Steve moaned.
“Why didn’t you tell me you were an adorable little baby?” Tony asked, sitting up and holding out the book for Steve to see.”look at those sweet blues.”
“Well, they had to find out eventually, let’s see what the damage is.” Tony sighed, threading a hand through his hair and looking up when a sleek, black car stopped in front of the alley.
Art by the amazing eriot, if someone can show me how to add it to the chapters I'd be extremely grateful
‘Hmmm look at that lollipop, I’d lick it real good for you😉.’ Came the reply. Steve flushed and almost chocked on a blueberry he was eating.
“But Tony, think of how horrified your father would be.” One of the eldest board members said, and that made Tony feel cold to his core.
“Iced tea, please.” Steve ordered. The girl nodded and left them alone, leaving them to choose between all de dishes on the menu.
Tony was impatiently pacing the lobby of stark tower. Awaiting the U-Haul that would bring Steve’s stuff over.
What followed was the most mind blowing orgasm Tony ever had (and that said a lot, since Steve managed to fuck Tony’s brains out every single time), and he was glad for the soundproof walls and floor of the penthouse, because he’d defenitly screamed while his eyes rolled back into his head and white splattered his stomach.
Steve chuckled and put his phone away. He focused on his painting and hummed along softly to the radio. The workday passed in a comfortable haze, after which Steve went to do the groceries.
“Just imagine, you have me pushed down on the backseat, music is playing, maybe we’re even driving through the city? You could fuck me while taking in the sights .”
“Agreed, chocolate covered strawberries will be even better if you feed me by hand, preferably when we’re both naked.”Tony nodded. They kissed again and then Tony made a swift call and then led them back to the car.
“Harder.” Tony demanded, and Steve obliged, picking up the pace. He balanced himself on one arm and stroked Tony's cock with the other, slamming himself into the genius.
Fuck, how could this have happened? How did he manage to text the wrong person and not realise? Was the real Jeffrey still waiting for his text?
“Good because I’m feeling like ice cream and waffles, and I know just the place. I also need to take you to the best restaurant I know.” Tony beamed. Steve smiled and held him for a minute longer.
“Get up you lazy bum, it’s Friday, we were going for a run with Sam, remember?” Bucky scolded his friend. Steve sleepily sat up and rubbed his eyes.
“It was great, I went parasailing, you know how I wanted to be a pilot for all my life.” Sam said, Steve did indeed know.
“Well I’m all up for habituation therapy” Steve said, threading a hand through Tony’s hair and nudging him closer so they could kiss again.
Now, Steve couldn’t have that. His hand tightened around the base of Tony’s cock, making the engineer yelp and preventing him from coming as Steve’s thursts got even harder.  He was now really hammering into Tony.
“Yes, of course, please.” Steve breathed, and apparently that was all Tony needed to come closer and smash their lips together. His hands roaming through Steve’s hair, tugging it lightly and making Steve gasp. Tony used Steve’s mouth opening to skilfully slip his tongue inside. Steve moaned against Tony’s lips and his hands grabbed Tony’s hips and just lifted the tiny brunette to get him closer. Tony gasped.
Steve grinned and opened the camera, he pointed it at his chest and teased his nipples with the piercings, a moan escaping his mouth. Then he sent the video to the man.
When he woke up again, Tony was still fast asleep in his arms. The smell of fresh buns and omelettes came wafting towards them from the bedroom door.
“Then we’ll have to, ah, persuade you...don’t we?” the man said, pressing a button on a tiny device. Tony’s first thought was ' please don’t let them have Steve, Rhodey or pepper, anything but Steve, Rhodey or pepper.
The waitress returned and took their  order, promising them the food would be there soon. She handed them their drinks while they waited.
“Why don’t you go home and rest for a bit, Stevie? “ Bucky said. “ Tasha will drop  you off so you can  sleep for a bit.”
“Steve, oh, you’re here.” Tony all but threw himself into Steve’s arms, and Steve understood Tony must have dreamt about the abduction.
Tony watched in satisfaction as Steve’s lips opened to let a pant eescape. He asked about the colour again (green, as expected). Then he ripped the shirt Steve was wearing, and eagerly pulled down his own pants as well as Steve’s, before yanking of his sweater and resuming his position on Steve’s hips.
“I can hold off kissing you until we get back if you’d prefer…” he started. Tony shut him up by kissing him.
“Believe me when I say I’m just as desperate to bring Tony home as you are. What do they want for ransom?”
“Don’t worry about it, big guy.” He smiled, pecking Steve on the lips.”I’m the one who got you in my bed, aren’t I?”
“kitchen.” He read aloud, before heading towards the kitchen island and putting the box there. Tony took one labeled ‘books’ and carried it towards the living room.
Steve bucked his hips unconsciously, enjoying Tony's soft lips on his manhood, but he didn't want to be the only one getting pleasure tonight. So he reached back into the drawer and got the lube and Tony's favorite vibrator, feeling Tony's lips leaving his cock with a soft 'pop'
Apparently, Tony got cuddly after sex, because as soon as Steve laid down next to him, Tony plastered himself to Steve’s side. A tanned leg was thrown over Steve’s own and tony buried his head in the crook of Steve’s neck.
“That was so great, thank you for taking me here , Tony. “ Steve said sincerely, pecking Tony on the lips. “best date ever.”
“Well, what do you want us to be, sweetheart?”Steve asked, throat tight and  heart clenching at the possibility of losing Tony because he had told him he loved him.
Jarvis announced the arrival of the elevator to the penthouse and Tony happily skipped over to welcome Steve home from work. He was in no means prepared for the searing kiss and wandering hands that were laid upon him as soon as that elevator opened.

“I’ve always wanted to share a rainbow cup with someone.” He beamed, and Steve couldn’t help but think how cute Tony was right now.
“sweetheart, you okay?” Steve cautiously placed a hand on Tony’s knee, which caught the engineer’s attention
“I had, until she passed away seven years ago.” Steve said, and he could see the guilt on Tony’s face.
“She would have loved you, especially because you make her son happy.” He pressed a sweet kiss to Tony’s cheek.
"Beautiful, honey, give me more." He carefully started moving his finger when Tony had sagged back into the cushions, watching the brunette trash and whrite around. Fighting against his bounds.
“My name is Steve Rogers ma'am, Tony and I had a lot of contact the last few days. Any idea where he is?” Steve asked hopefully.
"Oh honey. Yesss." He breathed. "You were made for this, weren't you? Your mouth is goddamn heaven."
“No. You better not come until you’ve made me cum.” Tony said, grinning devilishly and kissing Steve. “So I’d work for it if I were you.”
“Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck ...” Tony was crying out in bliss and Steve felt his own orgasm approaching like a train.
“Steve, you’ve seen me naked, of course kissing is allowed, but eh, maybe we should be careful just in case y’know… Papperazzi is everywhere.” Tony swallowed and Steve felt a pang of guilt.
“J, lock the door and tint the windows, make sure we're not disturbed. Oh and noise cancelling , just in case. We don’t want rumours.”
“ah, but my dear papa isn’t here anymore, now is he?” Tony said, voice sharp and agitated. “It’s Mrs Potts who runs the company now, and let’s all just be glad she cares more about me than Howard did.”
He didn’t tell Steve how he’d asked Jarvis to request an urgent meeting with a certain Mr. Loki Laufeyson as soon as Steve was asleep.
Loki looked beautiful, his raven black locks spread out over the pillow, fisting the sheets and tossing his head. Green eyes wild and unfocused. Steve couldn’t believe he was the reason for that.
"I'm going to wreck your mouth baby, fuck the sass right out of it." He promised, and Tony's eyes widened.
“Steve?” Bucky's voice rang through the apartment, he had let himself in using the spare key Steve had given him in case of emergencies.
“I’m afraid not, Steve. I’ll let you know if there’s more info.” The woman said, before the click told Steve that the call had been ended.  Steve threaded his hands through his hair and rubbed his face.
Tony gasped when the first finger was pushed in and trembled slightly. Steve bent over and kissed Tony’s cheek.
Steve found Tony’s prostate and made sure to push that sensitive spot each and every time, smiling when Tony didn’t hold back his moans of pleasure.
“fuckfuckfuckfuck STEEEEEEEEEEVE.”the brunet screamed through his orgasm. Steve could feel his own approaching like a train and twisted his nipples.
“Why don’t you play with them while I do this?” Tony started kissing the chiselled abs and made a trail towards Steve’s rapidly hardening cock. The blonde was already panting in anticipation, and when Tony firmly grabbed his hands and placed them on Steve’s own pecs, he played with his own nipples.
The blond was finally moving in officially, and Tony couldn’t wait. He had cleared some space in his walk in closet, bought an extra bathroom cabinet for Steve and cleared some shelves for Steve’s books and trinkets.
“Yeah, and I could formally introduce Steve on an event or press conference.” He mused. “Pepper has been asking me to do that for a while now, claiming that I light up the room when I’m with him.”
“Anthony, I must say that we had never expected you to be... Well...”said one of the board directors uncomfortably.
Two gorilla sized men came in and loomed threateningly over Tony. So, none of his friends was in danger? Then Tony could manage.
Steve chuckled and grabbed his second sandwich, chatting with Sam.  He had another session with Thor planned for the afternoon, some rich lady was willing to pay big bucks for a good painting of Thor’s golden locks and electric blue eyes. Steve was happy to provide the goods.
“Of course, Tony, I’m all yours.” Steve promised with a peck on the lips, before stretching out next to Tony. ”Explore all you want.”
“So, I know we should probably talk about the whole sexting and wrong number, then me getting abducted thing. But have been waiting to kiss you for forever now, and I… Can I?” he asked, unsure.
He was absent during dinner, mindlessly poking at his food without really eating. Too deep in his own thoughts to notice Bucky and Natasha’s worried gaze on him. They offered him to spend the night at their place, but Steve didn’t want to  impose.  So, he climbed the steps to his appartement and crawled into his now cold bed.
“Well you better move in quickly, then, so I can steal more of them.” He quipped, shashaying towards the elevator. Steve’s laughter accompanying him, and making the morning just a little bit better.
"You know what I want to do to that pretty mouth of yours?"He asked, his breath ghosting Tony's ear. Steve chuckled as he felt Tony shudder.
“I could buy you a gallery, and then you could just move in with me, no more flying back and forth, no more sleeping apart.” Tony said, still very much huffy.
“Add another finger sweetheart, go ahead.” Steve told him, and Tony immediately obeyed. His moans got louder and Steve groaned, hand pulling at his cock. His eyes fixed on the screen before him, other hand playing with his piercings.
Next up was the yellow ice cream (bananas) and the green (pistachio), they also had plain vanilla and stratiatella. Steve grinned when he discovered the rum and raisin one, that had been his mother’s favorite and reminded him of his childhood, he told Tony this.
“Hi Pep. Yes, I’ve seen. What? A board meeting right now?” Tony groaned. “all right , fine. I’ll send you my location. See you soon.”
“You sure you want to do this? You don’t have to.” He tried. The gorilla just grinned and stomped Tony hard in the stomach, making him fly backwards.  The engineer slid down against the wall.
Steve snapped a picture of the painting he was doing. A lady with ruby red lips, perfectly curled hair and a red dress.
“A nude portrait, Tony, he wanted a nude portrait.” Steve half moaned.”and he was gorgeous, almost in the same range as you.”
“You are , Tony. You so are.” Steve assured him with a loving gaze. That made Tony blush even more and his eyes drifted shut again at a particular deep thrust.
‘You’re a heathen. Woops gotta go, my secretary is scolding me for leaving the plane waiting, I’ll text you after the flight.’
“You’re a menace.” He said fondly, kissing Tony. The other man melted into his arms , and an awkward cough made them realise that they were not alone.
They both blushed and were a bit shy all of the sudden, Steve’s hand falling away from Tony’s cheek as Tony’s left his arm.
Steve scrambled to find the app and entered the code, after which he found himself with complete access to the intensity of vibrations of the brunet’s plug. Oh, this was going to be fun.
“I’d brace myself on one hand and fuck you good and hard while I jerk you off. “ Steve said, voice low and lust lacing through his words. Tony pushed the dildo in faster and with more force and jerked himself with the other hand.
“it won’t be. It’s been a week, some people don’t get found for months!” Bucky said, that made Steve cry out in desperation.
“Yes, just please... Please ..” Tony begged again, Steve groaned and turned the vibrations all the way up.
“I am telling you that Steve gave me a very nice evening after meeting you.” Tony said, leaning back in his chair, waiting for Loki to catch on. He could see Loki was trying to fight a smirk, so that son of a bitch had done that on purpose?
“green. So green.” Steve hurried to assure him, and so Tony went to town, lifting himself up and down and rocking his hips to give them both pleasure.
“You’re so sexy, Steve, I just want to eat you up.” Tony growled and nipped at Steve’s hip. Instinctively, Steve’s hips bucked. Tony just tsk’ed and continued kissing and licking Steve’s abs, feeling the blond squirming under him.
Tony was still slick from the night before, and Steve slid two fingers in while Tony sucked his cock to full hardness in his position underneath the desk.
“Oh darling.” Steve moaned, hands flying up to his nipples and twisting the piercings they found there. Tony’s moans got louder as he bounced himself up and down, his eyes closed.
He buried his head in his pillow, heart beating rapidly. His phone started buzzing buzzing again on the nightstand. Steve turned his back towards it and willed sleep to take him.
“you all right there, sweet thing?” Steve smiled at him, before pulling his shirt over hi head, and oh now Tony wanted to lick those abs. He would definitely have to tie Steve down sometime and try that. Yup, that had to happen as soon as possible.
“Go on, try it.”  Tony smiled, and Steve took a piece of the fried squid, closing his eyes as he savoured the taste and let memories wash over him. He made a little appreciative sound and then took a bigger bite, combining it with his mashed potatoes. He might have moaned softly, because damn it was so good, then he heard Tony’s fork clatter. He opened his eyes again, only to see his date staring at him wide eyed.
Steve pulled back and Tony stuck out his tongue to show he had swallowed everything, Steve dove in and kissed him sloppily.
Steve got into bed and settled down, ready for whatever the tanned beauty had in store for him. Soon enough, his phone pinged.
‘Maybe… What will you do about it?’ came the cheeky reply. Steve cleaned up the breakfast table and got on the couch, where he pulled his pants down and took a picture of his hand on his cock to send to his cheeky correspondent. The answer was immediate.
“Damn now that’s an ass I’d like to bury my face into .” he said, making Steve flush as he grabbed his phone back.
“I don’t know yet, they’re tending to him on the way here. I just know they’re bringing him back in, the man had built a location signaller from some scraps. He’s a genius. There were bruises according to Rhodey, he seems shaken, but not severely hurt.”
“Ah, yes. Big, blushing and blond. But I still don’t see it, what are you saying exactly?” Loki asked, sipping his latte and looking at Tony from over his sunglasses.
Tony didn’t give up the next day either. Steve’s phone started ringing while he was doing the finishing touches on the Thor piece.
Tony positively beamed at that, planting a sloppy kiss on Steve’s mouth.  Before stretching out and leaving the bed, giving Steve a welcome view of his naked body.
“Is the new Davidson painting done?” she asked her boyfriend. Bucky curled an arm around her petite waist and pulled her close to him.
“1000 dollars?!” he shrieked, and then shook his head again with a smile. “Have a good night, boss.”
“All it takes is someone sucking that gorgeous cock, do you say that to everyone you take a tumble in the sheets with?” the brunet joked, but Steve shook his head.
“Okay, sweetheart?” Steve asked, afraid he’d crossed a line. Tony had given him some sort of consent, but consent would always be key. He waited, not doing anything more until he got the okay from his lover.
Steve played with Tony’s fingers and tapped the palm of Tony’s hand in tune with the music, which made Tony’s heart flutter.
“you’re not burying your face anywhere other than between my legs.” Natasha said as she came walking by. She flicked Bucky’s ear.
Art by the amazing eriot, if someone can show me how to add it to the chapters I'd be extremely grateful
“We’re both clean, so throw that condom out and make a mess of me.” he challenged Steve, his eyes full of lust. Steve just kissed him again and soothingly rubbed Tony’s hip as he pushed in. He had, after all, no doubt about how big he was.
“I love seeing you in my clothes.” Steve blurted out when he saw Tony in the large shirt, and Tony couldn’t supress a smile when he saw that Steve’s eyes had darkened.
“Of course, oh honey I’ve been waiting to hold your hand.” Steve said, kissing their joined hands. Tony smiled and then typed something in his phone.
“anthony Edward Stark. Get in the car, right now.” Pepper said curtly. Tony sighed and looked back at Steve , before getting into the car, which sped away.
The most beautiful butt he’d ever seen, all golden tanned skin, a leaking cock trapped between toned legs. Steve groaned as he came, imagining his cock sliding between those bubble butt cheeks or even fucking into the tight hole between them.
“Oh my darling.” Steve said, hand threading through Tony’s hair. He started to hum a lullaby his mom used to sing to him when he was little, and to his surprise Tony slowly relaxed.
“Hello sweerheart, welcome home.” He jumped over the back of the couch, straight into Steve’s arms. Steve smiled at his lover fondly, before kissing him tenderly.
“I’m so sorry Tony. I just panicked. I should never have ghosted you.” Steve said softly. “almost losing you , this was the worst two weeks of my life.”
He looked up when there was a ping on his phone. A picture of Tony’s ass that made Steve surge with want and mine mine mine.
When Tony came skidding around the corner, followed by a ten or so cameras flashing, Steve knew their plan had failed. His first instinct was to protect Tony, so he started running along with him.
He found his completion not much later, Loki’s lips wrapped snugly around his cock, Steve watching them both in awe. Tony’s last thought before everything went white was how cute Steve was when he got something but didn’t quite seem to believe he was allowed to have it.
“your legs will be under the desk. She won’t see your cock is in my ass.” Tony said, lifting himself up and sliding himself down Steve’s cock with a content sigh.
It was a few minutes, and Steve was washing the dishes, when the promised photo came. Above that glorious ass, which was filled with three fingers, he could see a bronze back and dark hair. Hmm so a brunette then?
Then came the rapid fire of text messages, an incessant pinging that made Steve bury his hands in his hair.
“As if I want to bury my face anywhere other than between your miles of legs.” Bucky kissed his sweetheart.”hello babydoll.”
“Ahw honey. Don’t be cross, you just blush so prettily, I can’t help it.”Tony said with an apologetic smile, right before the door opened again.
“Doesn’t he look pretty like this?” Tony’s voice sounded. Steve nodded dumbly as he took in the pants and Keens that only got higher as Loki moved his hips trying to take Steve deeper.
“i see ...” happy said, deciding to not question his boss when he looked so happy. He beat a strategic retreat.
“Maybe we could watch a movie?” Steve offered. “Or just walk? I’m pretty sure I’m up for anything as long as it’s with you.”
“I can see that.” Tony said softly. Finger caressing the neat handwriting of Sarah Rogers, then he looked up at Steve, insecurity in his eyes.”Do you think she would have liked me?”
“Ta-ta!”  he called over his shoulder, not taking in the stunned expression and the fond headshake his driver gave him. He also missed the gasp when the money was counted.
Steve didn’t reply and just kissed Tony senseless again, directing them to the bedroom and proceeding to absolutely pound Tony through the mattress.
“Hey Buck!” Steve gave him a hug and then made to walk towards his easel. Bucky following him close by.
Tony sat up and trailed his hands all over Steve’s arms, Steve flexed intentionally, just to show off for this gorgeous man. Tony bit his lip as his hand trailed further towards Steve’s chest and stomach. He flicked the nipple piercings which made Steve hum appreciatively.
He turned the vibrations up and immediately got a snapchat, moans revibrated through the room, a faint buzzing heard in the background. Steve grinned, oh this beauty was completely at his mercy, he turned the vibrations all the way up and the next snapchat was the curvy brunet screaming in pleasure.
When the show ended, the actors received a standing ovation and Steve and tony walked out feeling excited and elated.
He started slow, kissing Tony and telling him how beautiful he was and how much he loved him over and over again. He well and truly made love to him, and Tony was blushing so prettily and trying to hide behind his arm and hand (which he couldn’t, Steve wouldn’t allow it). Steve pried the arm and fingers away every time and kissed Tony again and again.
He gave Tony a sweet kiss on his temple and ruffled his hair affectionately, and that made Tony smile again. The brunet kissed the blond on the mouth this time.
When Steve got home early as Tony requested, he was prepared for a lot. He had never expected, however, to find Loki and Tony laughing together in the salon.
Lunch had lengthened into watching football, which had led to pizza night on the couch, and Steve woke in the best of spirits when his alarm rang. He gathered the last of his stuff and went to the spot the Heli would pick him up.
“oh my god this chocolate ice cream is amazing. “ he gushed, scooping another spoon and holding it out for Steve to taste. It was indeed delicious and Steve smiled again.
Art by the amazing eriot, if someone can show me how to add it to the chapters I'd be extremely grateful
They were led to a secluded room in the back of the restaurant, romantic music playing and roses and candlelight on the table.
Tony pressed some money in the stunned drivers hand, before pulling Steve with him towards the elevator.
Tony seemed to be back asleep, his grip in Steve somewhat weaker, and Steve closed his eyes as well. The warm body in his arms and the faint smell of Tony’s shampoo made him relax and he drifted off not much later.
“It’s because Tasha and I don’t give a fuck about what other people think of our bedroom activities. We just like exploring a bit and it brings us pleasure. I know about grinder because I’m bisexual and proud, Steve. It’s not because a dame managed to tie me down that I have never looked at the fellas.”
“Billionaire and technical genius Tony Stark has gone missing. During one of the showcases of his latest model, the lights went out and people heard a fight. When the lights went back on , Stark was gone and a letter of ransom was found. There have been no indications as to where Stark was taken.”
Steve couldn’t help a grin at the ramble he got in reply and lazily stroked his cock for a few minutes. Then his phone pinged again and good lord, Steve was not prepared. Not in the slightest.
He wrapped his arms around Tony and latched onto that delectable neck while hammering up into the tight heat surrounding his cock.
“Now, what did you manage to catch?” Bucky grinned and made a grab for Steve’s phone. Steve dodged the attack but it caused his phone to fall to the ground. Bucky made a dive for it and had already unlocked it before Steve could catch him. He whistled when he saw the pictures of last night.
He slid in a third finger and curled them to put pressure on Tony’s prostate, making the brunet scream. Steve dotted Tony’s neck with kisses  while whispering sweet nothings.
Art by the amazing eriot, if someone can show me how to add it to the chapters I'd be extremely grateful
“To be gay? Well I’m not, I’m bisexual. Educate yourself.” Tony said, glowering at them. Another board member laughed breathlessly.
Steve let himself be led inside by Tony, who was immedeatly recognised by the girl at the reservation counter.
Steve bit his lip and pulled his shirt up in front of the mirror. His pants rode low on his hips, showing his Adonis belt and treasure trail under his chiselled abs. He angled the camera so his face wouldn’t be visible.
“You... You want me to move in? Do you want us to live together, sweetheart?”Steve asked cautiously, and now Tony’s eyes widened too.
The next morning, Steve went for a shower and then went to the art gallery he worked at. He greeted his colleagues and went to the back, where the painters worked.
“You look happy today.” Bucky whispered in his ear. “is it because I told you to install a certain app and you finally did so?”
“You're gonna get jealeous if someone else was to see me, touch me?” it sounded breathless. Steve hummed in agreement.
“Yes, come for me, sweetheart.” Steve groaned, hand flying over his cock. Tony came with Steve’s name on his lips, and that pulled Steve over the edge too.
He put his phone down and went to the kitchen to make himself some snack. Soon enough, he heard the tone that told him he'd gotten a message. His eyes went wide when he opened it, a tan wrist disappearing into dress pants, obviously pleasuring himself.
‘Hmmhmm so good, unless you prefer naughty boys, of course. I could be your little heathen.’ A picture of lips drawn between teeth, a hand under the chin. Steve could see some of the view over the shoulder of the man, who seemed dressed in a suit.
“Now then hurry up so I don’t have to wait all day.” Bucky teased . Steve chuckled and made his way to the bathroom with his running clothes over his arm. He changed quickly and then had a coffee before heading out with Bucky.
“My little heathen.” Steve said fondly, kissing Tony again as his orgasm took over and he filled Tony with a big, creamy load. Tony moaned and rolled his hips as he was being filled.
Steve smiled and shook his head as he watched them walk away. They were cute together and good for each other. He turned back to his easel and got to work.
“Let’s say I hope you aren’t too fond of this shirt, hot stuff.” Tony whispered hotly into the blond’s ear, before lightly nibbling on it, making a shudder run through Steve’s body.
Tony licked the underside of his shaft and Steve jolted like there was electricity running through his body. Then Tony found that sensitive spot close to his balls and started placing with his sac, and Steve didn’t even have the time to warn Tony to pull off.
‘Okay, the message is clear...I’m heading to my presentation. Would really love to hear from you, but I’ll stop bothering you... All my love, Tony.’
Their food arrived , then, and the waitress shot Steve a worried glance. He just asked for a glass of water, which she instantly brought. Steve took big gulps as Tony still snickered and the waitress hurried away to fetch their food. He gave Tony a look.
“Yeah, since yesterday. He’s doing okay, we video called before bed. “ Steve told his friends while they stopped to drink a bit of water.
“Buck.” Steve said quickly. “not everyone is as open about their sex life as you and Tasha are. By the way, how did you know about Grindr?”
“you’re going to sleep. “ she commanded him.”and Bucky and I will pick you up for dinner and drinks tonight. “
They stumbled into the elevator and Tony laughed softly as Steve just stood there, turning his head but not seeing anything.
Smiling, Steve undid his pants and shimmied out of his boxers , pulling his shirt over his head too.
“That means both of us, oh and for the record: Even though I’m sore, I absolutely love shower sex. “
“having fun, honey?”he asked, unable to stop a smile because Tony was so cute like that. Wriggling his but and scissoring his feet in the air.
It had been a week since Tony went missing and Steve hadn’t heard from Virginia Potts yet, despite her promise. He was a nervous wreck, every day that Tony didn’t come home was a day where he potentially lost his life. He couldn’t focus on his work and it showed in the quality. Bucky and Natasha saw their friend crumbling before their very eyes and decided to do something about it.
“Hmm yes, I’d like to see you in my office. Gives me something to dream about during work.” Tony mused. “let’s do it.”
Tony nodded and slipped into faded jeans and a shirt that he had stolen from Steve after he’d worn it. If he couldn’t have the real thing around, might as well have his smell around him like a hug for comfort.
“These are my toys, anything you want to see me play with?” he showed the box to Steve, and Steve’s eye Immediately fell on a big dildo. He felt guilty for the surge of arousal, but he knew Tony wanted to get his mind off of things and so he let himself slip into that familiar headspace.
“Would you... Have you considered ....”Tony started, a finger tracing figures on Steve’s pecs. He swallowed, eyes downcast.

“It was kind of funny, you still sure you want to do this? She could be back any minute.” Steve anxiously eyed the door.
“Show him our arguments, boys.” The man said, and gorilla number one grinned as he cracked his knuckles. Tony swallowed heavily.
“You’re all flustered, sweetheart.” He pecked Tony on the nose. “we should get going. The heli’s waiting.”
Steve waited for the confirmation from Friday, before allowing Tony to finally touch him. Meanwhile, he reached into the bedside table for the cuffs and the rope.
“Gonna come, sweetheart?” Steve panted, hand flying over his own cock. Iron man whimpered and nodded, sinking through his elbows so the plug reached deeper.
Pulling his shirt over his head to throw it in the hamper, he decided to draw himself a bath to relax further. He sighed as he let himself sink into the water.
The touching ceased, but the warm presence next to him stayed, as if Steve knew exactly what Tony needed. The brunet caught his breath for a moment, before fully opening his eyes. Feeling like he had come down enough to face reality again.
“Hey, it’s not fair, but we have each other. I’ve got your back, Tony. I’m here.” Steve caressed Tony’s back and kissed him again, right as a flash went off.
‘look at all that empty place waiting to be filled, sigh...’ read the caption. Steve smiled and send a picture of the bulge in his pants.
Steve grinned and reduced the vibrations to the lowest setting, soon he got a video call through snapchat, he chuckled as he accepted it.
“No, no. I want you to kiss me.” To emphasise this, Steve was kissed again, and fingers laced through his.
“Well, I was a very sickly kid, so I don’t remember much of my childhood.” Steve admitted.”my mum documented a lot of it for me.”
He didn’t see the shock on Steve’s face until the blond was quiet for a tad too long. Then he looked up from his hiding place and saw the look on his beloved’s face.
“Thor’s brother came in for a portrait today.” Steve started,”and he’d specifically asked for me, since he’d seen the pieces I did on Thor and he loved them.”
Steve got up from the couch, another shower it was. He felt light headed and as if he was floating. The gorgeous brunet had once again blown his mind, and he wanted to know the person behind the perfect body and soothing voice better.
“A little birdie told me he loves being choked.” Tony’s sultry voice sounded in his ear, as he let his fingers slide out of Steve’s body. “Why don’t you try it?”
It was a picture again, this time of a obvious hard on in swimming trunks, an inviting pool and sauna in the background. Steve swallowed.
“Wow, you’re a lot…Beefier in real life, I mean I knew you got muscles but daaamn.” Tony whistled. Steve barely heard a word, he was too busy admiring the man currently feeling up his biceps.
“Oh my god, that was so sexy. It’s even better in real life!” Tony said, wide eyed and trembling a little. Steve needed to regain his composure.
“It’s just no fair that in order to keep you safe, I have to hide you. Also, the board would probably have my head if we became public, homophobic old turds that they are.”

“No, I love your sharp wit, your intelligence, how you love your robots. I love that you always manage to make me feel better.” Steve had inched closer and the last words were barely a breath against Tony’s lips. “You're gorgeous inside and out, and I want to call you mine, Tony”
Steve smiled and passed his address, before focussing on the conversation with his friends. Tomorrow he would go and see the man that held his heart.
She patted his shoulder and left. Steve stripped to his boxers and got into bed.  He slept until Bucky came to wake him up to go for dinner, but he had slept fretfully , dreaming of Tony.
“I am.”  Steve had had the brains of going to the clinic to get tested, he grabbed his phone and showed Tony the proof.
“I know you wouldn’t, Stevie.” He said, and hugged his friend close. Steve buried his head into Bucky’s shoulder.
Thus, as Tony stumbled through the common room after yet another difficult meeting or negotiation, Steve took matters in his own hands and scooped the tiny genius up.
"All right captain, out with it. What do you want?" He demanded to know, and Steve turned even redder.

A ping made him smile, so, his sexting buddy was out of the sauna, then. He opened the message and smiled at the video of the bots playing with a tennis ball. Whirring and zooming around .
“Yeah, you want breakfast, honey?” Steve smiled, and tony opened his eyes. Humming appreciatively while his eyes drifted over Steve.
“So much can still happen.” Steve agreed, cupping Tony’s cheek and gazing into his eyes tenderly. Then the car arrived and Tony waved Steve into the car with a big smile.
Steve laid back in the bath for a while and then went to brush his teeth before crawling into bed and promptly falling asleep.
“I don’t even get a kiss first?” Steve smiled, and of course Tony dove into his arms, kissing him hard before repeating his request.
Of course, their picture was on the gossip sites in minutes, front page. Tony sighed when he got a call from pepper.
The pace they had built up to was quickly increased as Steve felt Tony's hand on his thigh, sneaking up to his ass to give it a slap: the sign he wanted more.
Steve couldn’t believe they were doing this, having sex in semi-public. He'd never pictured himself the type for that, but Tony .. oh Tony made him do and feel things he'd never felt or did before.
“I’m so sorry about lunch, sweetheart.” He said, bummed that the press had ruined his romantic lunch plan.
‘let’s test that when you get here, sugar 😉’ was the answer. Steve smiled, he was feeling giddy and nervous. He looked out of the window and not much later, in his eyes, the heli veered towards a tall building and started to land.
“of course, honey.” Steve would do anything to see that smile in person. Even if that meant he’d have to walk to where Tony lived. He’d get there.
He took the picture and sent it to the guy he met on Grindr, his ears burning with shame and arousal. He’d never done this before, but he had to admit this was easier than picking someone up in the club.
“So.” Tony smiled, gently rubbing Steve’s hip as they snuggled after their post coital nap. “What was that?”
He had just done it again, when all of the sudden he found himself with a lap full of  Tony, his lips occupied by kissing those plump lips back and the taste of wine on his taste buds. Steve kneaded at Tony’s ass.
“good boy.” Tony whispered in Steve’s ear, the praise made him shudder.” do what he says. I know you can do that for me.”
“Come on babe. She was oblivious and talking to you about me while you were having your cock sucked by me. It is kind of funny. “
“Yeah and it’s going to make me sad, so you should stay here in my bed and cuddle me some more.” Tony demanded, firmly pulling Steve’s arms back around him.
She led Steve towards  her car and drove him to his appartement.  She made him take a shower and ushered him into bed.
He returned home in high spirits, excited for the snapchat date. He had dinner in a rush, longing to hear his brunet again.
He was sure he looked dumb, being so in awe of the man beneath him and the man next to him. He just couldn’t help it, and Tony’s fingers pistoning in his ass and brushing his prostate probably didn’t help matters.
“Moi?” he asked, daintily perching his hand on his heart and sitting back, placing his butt right over his lover’s erection. “you wound me, Steve.”
Another picture popped up on Steve’s screen. The other had orgasmed too and sent Steve a picture of the result.
Tony had lost track of time, he didn’t know how long they had him here already, because there was no indication of time passing. The lights never went out and there wasn’t a window or clock to be seen  . The gorillas occasionally returned to give him another beating, and always left him bruised and hurting.
“I tend to have that effect on people, yes.” Loki admitted. “i suppose you’re here to tell me to back off your boyfriend?”
Steve looked from one brunet to the other in confusion. Loki chuckled and wriggled his eyebrows at Steve.
“I did. “ Steve confessed, feeling the panic rise again. What if Tony didn’t want anything to do with love? What if this was more of a friends with benefits situation?
He nodded and lubed up his fingers, shuffling off Tony's shoulders and in between Tony's legs. He teased Tony's rim for a bit, getting it nicely wet and lubed up, before carefully working his first finger in.
The lights dimmed and Steve took Tony’s hand in the dark. The brunet smiled and rested his head on Steve’s shoulder as the opening number to ‘the Addams family' played.
Could he trick his kidnappers into thinking he was working along? Well, at least he'd have a bigger chance of escaping if he had some tools.  He nodded, having made up his mind.
“Boyfriends?”he asked, voice soft and insecure. Steve's face was taken over by a big , goofy grin. His body felt ten times lighter and the knot in his stomach resolved itself.
Tony spoke Italian? Now that was something Steve didn’t know he was into. He could feel his cheeks heating up at the delicious accent, though. His hips pistoning into Tony, shoving him upwards and almost against the headboard.
Steve hit the dial button and his call was Immediately answered. A breathy moan and panting coming over the speakers.
“Yeah maybe. I wonder what the press will think of that. “ Tony mused, still rolling his hips. Steve bit his lip to hold back a whimper.

“maybe I could go with you?” Steve proposed, not wanting to miss out on spending time with Tony now that he was here. Sure, he would move in in a month or two, but quality time with his boyfriend was ever the priority.
“Woah tiger.” He chuckled breathlessly. “not that I’m complaining, but what’s got you so hot and bothered?”
“Making sure you were coming down okay was more important.” He said, and Tony felt a surge of warmth running through him at these words, shuffling closer to Steve.
“Steve? We've got him. We're bringing him home.” Virginia Pott's voice sounded, and Steve’s knees gave out beneath him.
“Tony!” Steve said quickly, red as a tomato. Tony chuckled and leaned back in, sipping his wine as he admired the flushed cheeks and bright blue eyes of his date.
He took a deep breath as he settled in the Heli, in half an hour he would see Tony. His Tony, for the first time.
"I want to fuck your pretty throat." Steve repeated."and I'm going to make you drink my load. What's your colour for that, baby?"
“Hey sweetheart.”Steve reached out to swipe back Tony’s hair, and Tony noticed Steve’s erection still going strong.
Steve dotted kisses to Tony’s back, and tony hummed in approval. The hands of the blonde left their position to wander for a while as Tony slowed to a delicious grind of his hips.
They met again in a tiny diner, and started their lunch with milkshakes.  They had scrambled eggs and bacon with toast and Steve texted Tony about it.
He slid the vibrator into Tony and pushed the on button, making Tony orgasm instantly.  Then he turned the toy to the lowest setting, allowing Tony to come back down a bit , because what he had in mind required for Tony to be a bit more present.
“We can donate to stonewall or to other foundations that help LGBTIQ persons.”Pepper proposed, and that didn’t sound half bad, to be honest. Tony nodded, this plan could work.
Loki, apperantly, was a screamer. His voice almost feminine as he reached his peak. Steve finished not much later with a grunt that sounded from deep within, as if they’d pushed the air out of him.
Art by the amazing eriot, if someone can show me how to add it to the chapters I'd be extremely grateful
“I’d like that.”  He said, pumping the artificial cock in and out in the rythm Steve had in mind. “What’d you do next?”
When Steve came back after hanging his clothes, he found Tony on the floor, giggling to himself as he watched Steve’s bare baby butt splash around in a tub.
They kissed longingly and messy , while Steve 's hand expertly found Tony's wrists and tied them up.
“patience is a virtue, Steven.” He teased him. Steve jolted when the ping of the elevator announced their arrival on their destination, and Tony grinned as he led Steve through the corridor and into his bedroom.
“Come for me, sweetheart. “ he panted, slamming into Tony a few times more before the genius came all over his hand and shook through his orgasm.
Tony moaned at the praise and bobbed his head even more eagerly, eliciting the first moan of his captain.
“I... I love that idea, Tony. I really do, and I love you so much. Let’s see if we can plan this properly, okay?” Steve smiled.
‘I bet you would make me feel safe. Enjoy your lunch, text me the address later and I’ll make sure the Heli is there at 9 tomorrow morning.’
“Pep got this. Let’s go unpack.” Tony grinned, pulling Steve towards his private elevator and heading up to the penthouse. There were already a few boxes put down there and Steve grabbed one.
“Tony I swear I would never cheat on you, and I think you’re the prettiest man on earth.” Steve looked stressed and miserable, and Tony kissed him.
“No, I’m pretty comfortable around you too.”  Steve told him. Tony smiled and pecked Steve’s lips again.
“You’re simply gorgeous, darling.” Steve breathed, reaching to cup Tony’s jaw. ”absolutely breath taking.”
“Excellent choice.” He grabbed the dildo and the lube and settled on the bed. Hand already lubing up the big thing.
Now, Steve started really pumping his hips, hearing Tony gag just a little bit. The two pinches to his thigh (their non verbal sign to stop) didn't come, and Tony looked like he was happy having Steve's cock stuffed down his throat.
Steve opened the app and searched the given user name, he quickly found it. He added it to his friends list and quickly got a text from Iron man.
“Beautiful.” Steve groaned, burying himself twice more into the tight channel that was clenching around his cock, before filling Tony with a big load.
“Yeah, you like?” Steve smiled. Tony didn’t answer, but instead bent over and pulled  the ring lightly with his teeth. Steve moaned and arched into the touch.
“Of course you can.” Steve allowed him, and Tony grabbed the big toy, before easing it slowly inside himself.
“Tony, sweetheart.” Steve whispered, as he put Tony down again. “Maybe we should take this slow, right? You deserve slow and meaningful.”
“So ready.” Tony reassured him with a bright smile. They went back to the lobby together, where pepper was already directing the movers towards the penthouse and telling them to please be careful around Tony’s very expensive things.
“Indeed he wouldn’t, so now we're kind of waiting for the kidnappers to get in touch to negotiate other ransom.” She sounded stressed out.
Steve didn’t know what to start with, his entire plate looked like an artwork, far too beautiful to eat.
“Au contraire, Mon Ami. I am a giver, and I like to spoil my guy. So if it’s you he wants, it’s you he gets. With your consent, ofcourse.”
Steve chuckled and took another bite, taking care to not make a sound this time. He liked teasing Tony, though, so he occasionally let sounds escape, especially when he had almost finished his food.
A picture of a toned stomach and proud morning wood graced Steve’s screen, he groaned and wrapped a hand around himself.
“Thanks!” Tony smiled and then pushed the chair a bit further from the desk, before starting to ride Steve hard and fast.
There was someone waiting for them on the roof of the building , and Steve’s heart started beating faster as the heli touched down and he was allowed to get out. The man hurried towards them.
“Shit... Oh...” he tossed his head and his hands abandoned their spot at his nipples to bury themselves in Tony’s hair, and tony went deeper, and deeper. Steve was going crazy. Tony hummed around his cock. Seemingly happy with the cock stuffed down his throat.
“Hold out your hands for me, darling.” He breathed against his lover’s lips, Steve did as he was told and Tony slipped the padded cuffs around Steve’s wrists, before giving Steve a gentle push, making him lie down and enabling Tony to attach the bound wrists to his headboard.
“Ah, Steve!” Tony moaned. Steve started dotting kisses on Tony’s body while the engineers eyes rolled wildly behind his eyelids, sounds of pleasure escaping his mouth, until.
“No need to ask, unless I safeword you’re free to do whatever you want.  My safeword is obadiah.” Tony said. Steve nodded and kissed all the left over bruises from the abduction and then lifted Tony’s legs over his shoulders.
“First date selfie “ Steve agreed with a smile. They put their heads together and Tony snapped the pic, sending it to Steve.
The blond just smiled and let himself be pulled inside the parlor.  Tony was all smiles and happy and Steve couldn’t keep his eyes off him.
“Hmm you like that?” Tony smiled, Steve smiled and nodded, then gasped as Tony bent down and flicked the rod with his tongue. He moaned as Tony tongued his pierced nipples in turn, clever fingers playing with the one not occupied by that sinful mouth at that moment.
“Mine.” he decided, before planting his lips on Tony’s again. His hands started wandering over the naked body of the other and he kneaded at that perfect ass.
“hmmm, got new piercings, I see?”Tony smiled , toying with the gold coloured rings through Steve’s nipples.
“Okay, babydoll, sure, we can do that.” Steve agreed. Tony whispered a thank you and leaned over to pull something from under his bed.
“Well duh, no better place, believe me.” Tony said, clenching his channel again and making Steve grip the armrests to ground himself.
That made Steve flush and Tony flashed him a satisfied grin, leaning back in his chair and musing to himself.
The blond settled over the brunet's head and fed him his cock slowly, moaning as the velvety walls of his lovers throat encased his cock once again. He slowly rolled his hips and Tony hollowed out his cheeks, making Steve sigh in pleasure. Then Tony canted his head and Steve slid deeper into Tony's throat, making him hiss in pleasure.
“hmm good, I like thinking that only I get to see you this way.” Steve rumbled. He could turn on the filth as well as the next guy, and with this particular man it seemed to come naturally.
“Steve, honey. I know. Just show me.”He said tenderly. Steve fished his phone from the pocket of his jeans and unlocked it. Heading to Facebook and poking around for a minute before handing Tony the phone.
Tony was wrapped around him like a koala , and Steve would enjoy it immensely handn’t his boyfriend (?) been in obvious distress.
“Promised I’d make you feel good, baby boy.” Steve smiled, scratching Tony’s scalp lightly. Tony hummed appreciatively.
Steve got up to get ready for work, pleasuring himself in the shower before he got dressed. He had a quick breakfast and then headed to the gallery.
Tears were streaming down Steve’s face at the last three text’s, Tony’s hurt was clearly seeping through the words, and now Tony was abducted and Steve couldn’t tell him how he really felt. Might not get the chance to ever tell him how he felt.
“I’m done with sitting here and listening to you insult me. I’d have you fired in a moment, but that’s up to Mrs Potts. I’m going upstairs, to my boyfriend.” Tony slammed the door behind him and went straight to the elevator. Texting Steve he better be ready to hold him as soon as he stepped out of it.
“doesnt matter. Are you okay?” Steve asked, looking Tony over for injuries or the likes. “I followed you because I didn’t want you to go through this alone. I don’t care if they know about us, Tony. I know you want to protect me, but I just want you to be all right.”
"Well, you know how much I love your mouth, right?" Steve asked, and Tony hummed in acknowledgement. He did notice Steve loved his mouth on him.
Steve had asked for a show, and boy did he get one. Tony was whriting on the bed, two fingers buried inside his ass.
“So, Tony. Thanks for the file and I will see you on the charity event tomorrow. Feel free to bring Steve, could be your first big outing as a couple. “
“they’ll have a field day, as usual with you.” Pepper smiled fondly.With these words, she turned around and walked out of the office. Tony slammed his laptop shut as soon as she was out.
“Devo venire, per favore fatemi venire.” Tony begged. He was pulling his hair, panting and keening. Steve stroked Tony’s cock. Once, twice.
“Oh, oh so now my sexuality is an idea, an invention? Like the inventions I made, and have patents on, patents that could force you guys to stop making them, I might add.”Tony sneered. He calmed down a little when he felt pepper’s hand on his.
“Hmm raspberry!” he fed Tony a spoonfull and tony followed by some of the brown ice cream and moaning.
As soon as the door was closed, Tony shot Steve a grin and dove underneath the desk. Steve immediately got with the program as Tony opened his trousers, and let his hand slide into Tony’s underwear.
“I don’t care, and I would never betray someone’s trust like that.” He said softly. Buckys eyes turned soft.
“Hey, you gonna keep texting Tony or actually accompany us for the run you promised?” Bucky asked teasingly. Steve grinned and shot Tony an okay text before catching up with Sam and Bucky.
A surprised 'oh, ooh' and a moan signalled the orgasm of the other man, and for a while there was only panting until Steve grunted as he creamed his pants. There was silence on the other side of the line, until…
Tony nodded, thought about it for a moment. He was torn, because he knew lots of people would probably be in danger if he helped his kidnappers, but ... Steve, Rhodey, Pepper. What if they got hurt, because of him?
Steve had convinced Tony to go out for lunch today for their three month anniversary. He was wearing shades and a cap and he had a stubble, so people wouldn’t really know who he was. Tony would wear a disguise too, he had promised, so they could be together out in the open without anyone recognising them.
Steve’s phone pinged a few hours later, and he was curious who'd text him at work. It was the new number.
“I think I will, Bucky and I always bought fried squid and French fries on the pier of Coney Island when we were young. We haven’t done that since he got together with Tasha two years ago, but maybe we should.”
Tony looked miserable there, and Steve couldn’t have that, so he pulled Tony close and kissed him deeply.
“Well then, boyfriend. Let's shower before breakfast.” Tony said, feeling Steve’s gaze on him as he shashayed towards the bathroom.
Tony grumbled and dove deeper into Steve’s embrace, hiding his face in his boyfriend’s neck so he could take in the mix of Steve’s smell and the faint remnants of his cologne.
“ Is it something we can play with, sugar? Is it a toy?” he asked eagerly, and God, Tony was so in love with this man. He was sure that , had Steve been a puppy, his tail would be wagging now.
“that good huh?” Tony chuckled. Steve just wrapped his arms around Tony and kissed him , needing to hold the gorgeous man close.
“Hey, you think we can visit our parents graves together one day? I think I would like introducing you to my mama. Is that weird?” Tony asked softly. Steve shook his head.
“Hey Pepper. Tony is using the bathroom for a moment.” Steve said, trying to keep a straight face because Tony kept sucking and that wicked tongue of his did sinful things.
He came with Tony’s name on his lips, hands tightening in Tony’s hair and keeping Tony down there. His ears were ringing and he saw white, it was intense. And then he was floating, just feeling warm and fuzzy and like nothing could hurt him. He could hear Tony chuckle , and that just made him even more at ease. He happily surrendered to the feeling.
“And that’s scandalous in which way?” Tony quirked an eyebrow. “really, I don’t see why your nose is in my business...”
