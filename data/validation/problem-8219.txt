“Yes. Yes, it's good.” Tony says, dragging in a long inhale of breath. Steve shifts beneath him, going in for another kiss. Tony meets him eagerly, tangling their tongues together and groaning as Steve braces his palm across the small of Tony's back, beneath his shirt. His hand feels hot, branding, as if Tony will always feel it there. Steve nips at his lips, slipping his other hand up Tony's back to press between his shoulder blades, and then Tony finds himself being flipped down onto soft couch cushions in a move so artful it could have been pulled from his own seduction playbook.
They were the first new clothes he’d acquired in this new century, other than his uniform and the sweats Tony gifted him that first night in the mansion.  He was setting down roots, building a home.  The drawers in his room were beginning to be filled with his belongings.  He wasn’t going back to the forties, he was staying in the present, and he was finally beginning to accept it.
Nothing could have prepared them for Ultron's return.
That night in the half aware spaces between true wakefulness and sleep anything seemed possible. Tony isn't back though, is never coming back. His grief then was swift and sharp. Sitting on the floor cradling broken shards of blue plastic without even the energy to care his hands were bleeding Steve felt something within himself shatter. In many ways he feels like that breaking is still happening-cracks snaking deeper, stretching further like the runs in Peggy's stockings. Things he's lost, people he will never see again, the red of Peggy's lips, the promise inscribed on the interior of Tony's wedding band. All gone but for the snapshot of his memories.
“What's eating him?” Steve asks, slipping his arm from around Tony's waist to get the biggest wok they own out of the cupboards. He's ravenous, even moreso than usual.
“Steve.” He laughs, tugging him towards the shop “Stop being an ass and come eat your weight in yogurt.”
“Oh, oh God no.” Tony laughed, blessedly oblivious to Steve’s spiraling thoughts, he thunked his head back on the couch, then stood up to walk over to a set of counters and cabinets set into the wall. He rifled around briefly, then returned with a pizza box that had been resting on a warmer in one hand, and a bottle of water in his other. He passed the pizza over to Steve, then sat back down. He took a long sip of his water, then turned to face Steve again, tucking his legs up under himself on the couch. “No Steve, um, that’s not why. I can’t um.” He cleared his throat, took another sip of his water, “You’re the sweetest thing I’ve ever seen babe, but I can’t have kids, long story, but, that's not why I stopped taking them.”
“Yes, Tony, more than, having so much back, It’ll mean a lot to me, make the place seem like home, ya know.” Home, a place he could belong. It would feel all the more real once the things from his past arrived. The mansion was more than he ever could have dreamed of, but with this, it felt like the last piece of the puzzle slotting into place.
an Avenger. Against him, Hammer won't really stand a chance, that seems unimportant when he sees the covetous gleam in Hammer's eyes. H
Steve would bet dollars to donuts that Happy is behind the wheel. The other Avengers are grouped off to the side watching them. Steve mouths a quick
“Well, uh, I'm glad you approve, and it shouldn't be too terrible for you if we ever get whammied.” Tony tries to sound as reassuring as possible, he even pats Steve's hand. There, no harm done, hopefully Steve won't be too upset by their mutual inconvenient arousal. Even if Tony's is completely inappropriate. He had just wanted a kiss and then Tony had to go and make it
A short span of minutes passes before Iron Man is stepping into the room with him. The slump in his shoulders is gone, a new reactor glows brightly out of the armors chest. “You alright Shellhead?” he asks, but Iron Man doesn't reply, stepping close instead to adjust the icepack on his arm before speaking.
“Yeah I've heard about this Doom thing. Here's the thing, he thinks you're too good for him. He thinks he doesn't deserve you.” Rhodes says matter of factly. Steve fights down the hysterical laugh building in the very depths of his soul.
“Gosh Tony, we didn’t have indoor heating in the forties, we just put hot rocks in our beds.”  He said earnestly.  Tony pursed his lips, but he was clearly trying not to laugh.  His eyes sparkled.
“Why do you reach?” Tony's head whips around.
He became an icon seemingly overnight, doors that had always been closed were opened to him with a glance.  Realizing he was being flirted with was a revelation, not that he really reciprocated at first.  People looked at his body covetously, but that wasn’t what he wanted, not by a longshot.  Still, it was nice to be desired, even if it wasn’t really Steve Rogers that they wanted.  All of that could not balance out the way he felt after missions.  He never spoke of it, but the serum had changed him in ways it took some time for him to understand.  The rush after a fight, where once it had ebbed away, it stayed, and stayed.
“Lie? About what?” Steve feigns ignorance pretty well, but the gambit doesn't seem to work.
“Yeah, that's...that's the tradition, gotta, can't mess with tradition, it's bad luck. You'll turn into a turkey, or even worse, Justin Hammer at midnight or something-” Tony's is looking everywhere but Steve's face, but his eyes drop shut immediately when Steve bends the slight distance between them to seal their lips together.
good.
“Hi Steve.” Tony's greeting shakes him out of his reverie, and he somewhat guiltily drags his eyes away from where they had fixed on Tony's behind.
He was early, but not early enough it would have seemed.  In the classroom, gifts were already numerous atop Russell’s desk.  Little packages of brightly colored wrapping paper, letters on finer stationary than his own, jars full of homemade gifts, and one box Steve could tell was jewelry.  Steve put his hand in his pocket, pressed his fingers against the letter with his heart in it, and turned away to sit down at his own desk.  He stared fixedly at the woodgrain of his own desk, feeling his heart in his throat, until Russell himself walked in.
“Uh, if you like frozen yogurt that much then I can get a froyo machine delivered, you can have it anytime you like.” Tony murmurs, blinking as Steve darts in to steal a kiss.
“Of course, what are bodyguards for but to keep their charges safe from all manner of harm?” Oh the sarcasm.
A few moments later they clamp power dampener cuffs on Doom, the villain seems almost relieved to be out of the Hulk's grasp. He's sitting on the floor, shaking his head as if to clear it when Tony comes sauntering over; an enticing sway in his step that translates even with his body encased in metal. Steve tracks his path over with rapt attention, gaze drawing up to the faceplate when Tony flips it back to smile at him, brown eyes sparkling with mischief.
“Oh, honey, you're so hard, that is delicious.” Tony all but purrs, but he's taking his hand away a moment later, crawling back and making room for himself between Steve's knees. “Here, help me get your pants off so I can get a taste.” Tony hooks his fingers in the waistband of his pajamas, and Steve helps him, shifting around and tugging at the material until it slips off, and Tony slings the pants across the room.
“Good, thank you for being so clear.” Tony lowers himself then, stretching out across Steve's body, urging Steve to really relax back into the pillows. He straddles one of Steve's thighs, rubbing himself along Steve's body as he speaks. “You know I'm not fragile, darling, but I know you worry. So just lie back now and let me do delightfully wicked things to you, hmm? What do you think?”
“Okay, got it, you're not gonna tell me. Still, I'd like to help him get to a bed.” Steve tries not to think of that as an innuendo. It's a good thing Clint is not around to hear him saying stuff like that.
“I want-” Tony says slowly. “I want you to come in me then, make a mess of me.” Steve can't believe him.
Tony can't hold back the relieved laughter. It seems like everyone is in on this, he may as well.
“Well, hold onto your faceplate Shellhead, we have a bet to win.”
“For the road.” He says, drawing his hand away slowly.  Tony purses his lips, looking down at the muffin then back up at Steve.
“Couldn't sleep, JARVIS said you were up so I came looking.” Steve whispers, afraid somehow that if he speaks loudly it will startle Tony away.
“Okay,” Rhodey says, drawing out the word slowly, “that's not surprising at all, what's your crisis here? Because all I'm seeing is the natural progression of you two making goo goo eyes at each other all the time.” Tony resists the urge to remind Rhodey about his own so called goo goo eyes at Carol, that seems uncalled for, especially given he does
“You would do that?” He asked quietly. He had never seen Natasha with her gloves off, never seen her touch anyone on the team without them.
Steve can only manage a sort of garbled groan at the thought of that. Tony has to know the image that evokes. He's always so put together, so gorgeous and polished. The sight of him all mussed up and covered in Steve, the way it looks on him.
difficult to try to be casual in a full suit of armor, but Tony thinks he's pulling it off.  “Yeah, what was that?” He says, hoping he sounds less guilty than he feels, he doesn't think he's entirely successful.
“Ah, he seems very intent that you do so in a timely manner, as he states the likelihood of your teammates returning within the next hour and a half is quite probable.” JARVIS rarely sounds amused, but Steve catches a hint of it this time. He freezes, mulling over the meaning of JARVIS' words and flushing all over when they register. Carefully he packs away the few frozen goods before all but hightailing it over to where Tony is waiting for him.
“Happy holidays Shellhead.” He murmurs, leaning down to kiss Tony's forehead. Tony tips his head back and smiles, eyes sliding shut.
“Um. Wow.” Tony chokes out, brown eyes wide and shocked when they finally open again. “Good morning to you too-I've got to go...debrief. Need to. Rhodey's calling.” Tony stutters out, staggering off towards the Avenjet almost at a run. Steve watches him go with a deep frown.
“We're...not going to talk about what I just said. Ignore it, morning Tony is bad Tony, listen to nothing he says.” Tony mutters, resolutely refusing to meet Steve's eyes.
“Well. That happened.” Says Tony bemusedly. Steve grunts, still glaring in the direction of the carriers.
be his. Tony seems to be stunned speechless for once, but he turns towards Steve once Doom is safely within SHIELD custody.
are incredible.” He blurts, before he can reign himself in.  Tony gapes at him, mouth opening and closing speechlessly.
“Don’t you start with my meat again, Stark.”  Steve says, laughing despite himself, pulled from his melancholy instantly.  Tony shakes with laughter against his back, pressing apologetic kisses against his neck, which is lovely, and more than a little distracting.  Still, he finishes his assigned task in what he estimates to be a decent window of time.
“Mmm, long enough.” Tony moans when Steve presses the heel of his palm against the plug, rocks it inside him. “Steve, quit
“Did you feel that?”  Roy said nervously, and then all Hell broke loose.
“Stay?” Tony says quietly. He can't mean that, and Steve's not going to take advantage of someone clearly not in a fully conscious state of mind. He sighs, running a hand through Tony's hair and leaning down to just barely brush his lips over the top of Tony's head.  His hair smells softly scented, Steve wants to rub his cheek against it, wants to stay, maybe if Tony was fully in his faculties, but he's not.
“I got flowers, I am the prettiest, fanciest person here.” He thinks about that for a moment. “No scratch that,
Chamomile-patience
“Huh. Guess we'll have to share. Mine is big enough for two people anyway.” He feigns abashment, hoping he's put enough regret in his tone to not be as transparent as a window.  Tony just stares at him when he joins him in the tent.  “Unless it makes you uncomfortable, in that case you can take it and I'll go grab a blanket from Natasha's car.” Steve offers, mindful of Tony potentially not being on-board with this sleeping arrangement despite previous suggestions of the contrary.
Tony comes awake to light kisses on his shoulder blades. He cracks one eye open. The lights are drawn down, but the holo-clock floating on his darkened window tells him it's six in the morning. Steve smells damp and shower fresh as he leans over Tony's back, and Tony angles his head for a soft drowsy kiss. Steve must have gone on one of his ridiculous four am jogs. Apparently rolling around in bed for an hour the previous night had done nothing to cut into his exercise time. Tony sighs, mumbling sleepily as he's turned from his side onto his stomach. Broad hands work down his flanks, strong thumbs press into the dip of his spine, working out tension and soreness.
“You're sure?” Steve is looking into the faceplate intently, as if he could glean more truth from it by doing so. “There's no one hurting him?” The 'no one I can punch' seems implied. Tony allows himself to feel a little warm at the thought of Steve jumping in a time machine and punching some of his bad decisions.
“JARVIS has been real helpful adjusting, but in the end it's you. It's always you that shows me how the future is full of beautiful wonderful things. But I don't think it would be half as beautiful-” He kisses Tony's hair. “I don't think I could find it so beautiful without you.”
“Yeah, you like it?” He asks, pleased he's made Tony feel good.  Tony flushes a little in response, rubbing his cheek against the fabric of Steve's shirt.
“Oh my god Steve, really?”  Tony says incredulously, but he sounds a little breathless too.
As much as his blood was spoiling for a fight, he still had to plan, and have a few hours of rest at least. Even with rut burning hot in his veins, he knew he had to reign it in. He’d be no help to anyone if he ran off to Mamula half cocked. He considered telling the team, but this was his fight, his score to settle. He couldn’t endanger them. He could hear Bucky calling him a fathead from beyond the grave, but he didn’t have any room to talk. Back in the war, Bucky’d been notorious for the wild risks he took, and Mamula was always somewhere both of them had wanted to be sent to. Bucky would come with him in spirit, even if they were never able to tear down the walls while the war was on, Steve could do something about the piece of trash glorifying the horrors of a past that had made Mamula what it was.
“Can I?”  Steve asks, indicating Tony's cock with a glance; so hard and enticing where it juts insistently from Tony's body.  “Looks like you got something for me.” He wants to do something for Tony. Maybe suck him? Tony always loves that, and he's done so much for Steve, so much.  He wants to please him, to be the cause of those noises Tony only lets slip when he's really feeling good.
Steve smiles, tearing his gaze away from Tony's face to look down at the piano.  “I don't have a problem with you leading . Just don't get too cocky-I'm old and set in my ways, you might leave me behind if you go too fast for me to keep up.” Poking fun at himself is worth it when Tony laughs, but he soon goes quiet, directing Steve through the first few notes of the piece. His movements are smooth, sure, without any hesitation. Steve feels as much as hears the music come together, able to predict some of the notes before Tony plays them. The touch of his hand-cool despite the heat of his body-the warm press of him along Steve's side. It's almost enough to wholly distract him from playing, but play he does, letting Tony guide him through notes he has heard but never thought he would be able to reproduce. It feels like just yesterday he was a poor skinny asthmatic kid, but now he's sitting next to the most gorgeous fella he's ever seen, living in a mansion, and he might even have a
There is no time here, nothing to mark the steady march of the years, but he is vaguely aware that time it is passing. He knows it is dark where he is, dark and cold, that he rocks to and fro as if held in the arms of his mother.
what happens to people who kidnap him?” Tony can be soft, sweet and welcoming, but the man
busy.
“You're picturing it aren't you?” Tony says with a grin.
“Oh, you're
Tony turns in Steve's arms, his insides flipping over unpleasantly. No, he's not hiding things to hurt Steve, but he's certainly not doing this to help him. He's so fucking selfish sometimes, but he doesn't want to stop, can't seem to when it comes to Steve.
“Tony-” He laughs helplessly, gasping as clever fingers creep into the front of his pants.
“Tony.”
“Yeah babe, that’s right, I’ve got you.”  Tony whispered, helping Steve take his own tactical gloves off, because his fingers were too slow and stupid to do it alone.  “You needed this huh, I thought so, I’ve noticed, but you never asked.”  He was petting Steve’s hair, and Steve sobbed, tucked his face against Tony’s neck, pressed his cheek there against warm skin that smelled like vanilla, he tasted Tony’s scent too, this close it was like drinking a sip of hot spiced tea and the crunch of a sugar cube between his back teeth.  The way he’d had tea in a tiny Turkish cafe outside London during one of his few periods of downtime in the war.
The hand rubs there for a long quiet moment before stilling-as if registering suddenly that he's being carried. Tony's head comes up. Wide terrified eyes meet his, and Tony leans back in his arms, bracing his hands against Steve's shoulders. It takes a surprising amount of strength not to fumble his hold.
“So is that a yes on being my fella then?” Steve asks, joyful with the possibility, and Tony laughs, the sound bright and warm.
“I did say that, would you like to?”  Tony’s hand doesn’t still in its petting, but he does sit up further, gaze roving over Steve’s face, expression curious.
It was easy to order anything these days, hell, if he’d wanted to, he could have bought a car online.  Steve navigated to a page he’d seen advertised on commercials while wandering around town.  It was a company that sold water bottle pillows.  Big plush pillows in the shape of animals with chambers meant to hold hot or cold liquids.  It seemed a hell of a lot better than a water bottle wrapped in fabric behind enemy lines.  Sure it was expensive, but it wasn’t like he was paying rent these days.  Steve ordered two of them, one in the shape of a happy fat cat, and the other in the shape of a big carrot.  He thought Sarah might have gotten a kick out of that one.  Next day air too, it was some God-awful sum for the shipping upgrade, but Steve ticked it off anyway.  It would be worth it, if he could finally get some rest.
“I know you don’t know us, and you have no reason to help us, but, if you’d like to lend a hand, if you’re who I think you are, well, we would sure appreciate it.”  He placed the shield in Steve’s grip, and then went running from the room with steps far less loud than they should have been with all that metal.  Steve stared down at the shield.  If they had been hostile, he highly doubted they would have been so willing to pass the shield back into his keeping.  The rush was still there, buzzing under his skin as if it had never left.  Steve took a deep breath and charged after Iron Man.  There would be time for explanations later.  This he could do.
“JARVIS is loaded up on all of your tech devices, if you need anything go through him, he knows what's should be safe for you to see. Avoid watching television, and heavily crowded spaces.” Natasha is rattling off from her checklist.
“Get a room!” Clint cat-calls, tossing a piece of popcorn at Steve. He catches it, and Tony laughs delightedly, sitting up to curl against Steve, throwing an arm over his shoulder and wrinkling his nose in Clint's direction.
"Yes, definitely, very much go, green, verde-" Tony says, nodding so much he feels like a bobblehead. His heart is pounding in his chest as they walk out into the hall. Through the little porthole of a window he sees Natasha walk into Hammer's holding cell. He almost feels sorry for the guy. Almost, but not quite. A few SHIELD agents start to say something to Steve as they move through the halls, but the look on his face seems to stop them in their tracks, and they back away, leaving Tony to be tugged along at a speed just shy of urgent behind him.
“You're planning something.” Steve says, tone accusatory but it's clear he's trying not to laugh.
“You know, if you ever quit your day job you'd make a great race-car driver.” Tony yells over the wind, Steve laughs, dropping one hand down to rub over Tony's forearm, giving his wrist a squeeze.
“You should eat double too.”  Steve grumbles under his breath.
“Sir, Captain Rogers approaches, he states he has a gift for you.” As if on cue, there are five precise knocks on his door. Tony swallows, going to look at himself in a floor length mirror, before allowing JARVIS to let Steve in the room.
“Please,” He says “Please, yes, please show me”
The others puzzle him. checking on him constantly, as if they're afraid he will slip through their fingers like smoke, like the water he can see in the distance when he closes his eyes and really concentrates. Part of him desperately wants to reach for it. Another part of him is happy not knowing. Something tells him he has reached for it before.
“Oh.” Steve takes stock of their position, curled around each other in the east corner of the debriefing room, Steve's arms wrapped around Tony like protective bands. His face flames hot with shame, and he lets Tony go as if scalded, opening his mouth to apologize.
“Always have time for you Cap, don't tell anyone else but you're my favorite.” Tony whispers conspiratorially in the way only those on their way to being soused can.
“Hey!” Clint says suddenly. “I thought I was your favorite.”
Andy was in far worse shape, sure he was busted up less than Steve, but he was crying something fierce.  Steve scowled, refusing to feel bad about the whole mess.  If Andy wasn’t such a big palooka of a bully, none of this would have happened.  Who picked on babies?  A guy looking for a sock in the kisser, that’s who.
feel. Tony, God, Tony, you, just looking at you makes me feel out of control.” Steve sounds wrecked already, his lips are kiss reddened, his hair disheveled from Tony running his fingers through the soft blond strands. He looks gone on it already, as if having Tony red faced and aroused on his lap is everything he's ever wanted. He's panting, eyes almost glassy as he leans up to steal another kiss. It's scorching hot, devouring, making his stomach flip with how quickly it spikes his arousal. “I've been trying so hard to hold back but you...can I touch you, can I?” Steve grits out, skimming his teeth over Tony's bottom lip, his hand pressing right
Tony runs, hand reaching towards the only other occupant in this place. Sunlight filters in, the ends of blond hair seemingly catch fire. A wreath of light about his soulmate’s face. Blue, blue eyes, bluer than the sky, bluer than the lapis powder his soulmate grinds into paints with shaking hands. Tony knows those hands even if his body is unfamiliar. Tony knows the color of his eyes, knows the shape of his lips. He runs, and the ground tilts beneath his feet, the windows shatter, and then the ocean is there, dragging him under as it always does. He’s sinking, falling, pushed backwards as if by some massive force, the skeleton of a plane, ghastly and terrible serving as his prison. He’s pulled back against a strong chest, lips on his, sharing air, and Tony isn’t afraid of drowning any longer.
It was a fast fight, but no less furious in its intensity.  Steve found himself falling in easily with these strange new allies.  They were brave, intelligent, moving with an experience with each other which spoke of their bonds being green, but still tested and true.  In the end, he knocked Namor’s diamond hard head with the shield hard enough to make his eyes roll.  Their eyes had met, and recognition had shown.  Namor had some choice words for him, but Steve knew him well enough to know when he was being thanked.  Steve had a feeling whoever had mind controlled Namor into attacking them was about to be in a world of hurt.
“I would, something slow, I’m not much of a dancer, two left feet.”  Steve answers, following Tony after he rolls up to stand, and leads them over to the living room.  There’s quite a bit of empty space, but Tony situates them atop a plush rug that feels incredibly nice on his bare feet.
“Oh my god. Steve,
“What about it-wow you're already starting to heal some.” Iron Man sounds distracted, but Steve presses on.
“Yeah okay.” Tony mumbles.
“That was really something.” Tony murmurs, hissing under his breath with overstimulation when Steve pulls out of him slowly and traces around his hole.
Bruising. Tony Is bruised all over. These are not small accidental bruises from bumping into things unthinkingly. These are deep, painful looking. Purples and blacks mottling otherwise smooth skin-save for a few tiny white scars peeking out from the edge of the sweater.
“Well. I like being touched.” Tony grumbles, a hint of obstinance creeping into his voice as he hunches down in his seat.
“Badly. That's putting it lightly. He doesn't
“Hey what's, oh god, shit, okay...” Iron man is at his side, Steve starts, realizing he's been hunched over his knees staring blankly at the wall for God knows how long gulping in air with long wheezing drags.
relax, chill, you're all acting like this is a matter of national security instead of-well whatever this is.” Silence meets his words.
“Oh I have plenty of
"How about your missiles, did you tell them about that?  Or the fact you killed your big daddy-o because you wanted a bigger piece of the pie.  All that pie, all that sugar, and you wouldn't share with little ol' me,"  Hammer continues on with all the plaintiveness of Oliver Twist asking for more soup.  It's ridiculous and disgusting, but Tony still feels torn, usually he would just bat it off with some innuendos of his own, but Steve is right there, hearing about all the worst parts of his past. Steve had said he loved him, but Hammer is detailing some of his more sordid history now.  His sexual past he's not ashamed of, not at all really.  That ship has long sailed, nothing to be ashamed of there.  It's the other things.  His history making weapons, who he'd been once-and how can Steve ever look at him the same way again. This is it, the bullshit straw that breaks the camel's back. Steve deserves better, deserves someone that doesn't have a list of very public bad decisions trailing him, Steve is-
“Polio never left. There's parts of the world-” He sighs, looking away and rocking on his heels. “Parts of the world not as lucky as us. It's still there, looming like a monstrosity in the water. Treatment's expensive though, too expensive.” Tony's gaze flicks down.  “This is a way to undo the damage that has already been done. It won't wipe the slate clean, but that's why we need better protection for water sources, clean treatment centers. Even here in America there's places the water is just fucked and that's ridiculous. Water should be a human right, but instead.” Tony cuts himself off, his cheeks coloring up, like he's said too much and he's gone all bashful.  Steve is breathless.
“You are good enough. No, no, no arguing, Rhodey time now.” Rhodey says, ignoring Tony's sputters and pointing to himself imperiously-the great big dork.  Tony feels unaccountably fond, despite that being tempered by a bit of indignance.  “You listen to me Anthony Edward Stark. I
“Nothing, nothing, they're still in merry old Brooklyn, right where they should be. Nothing to see here, now whassa matter, tell old Shellhead all about it.” He babbles, eager to change the subject as quickly as possible; Steve has enough things to be upset about without adding the loss of his home team.  He gets a suspicious glare for his efforts, but Steve seems to have bigger fish to fry.
“Yeah. I do love you.” Steve sighs in mock defeat. Tony's smile is both sharp and soft, all contradictions, just like the man himself, but it softens further-melts into something sweet and mellow. Sticky sweet like toffee when they kiss again, gentle this time. Steve cups Tony's face between his palms, chasing the fresh taste of mint until Tony pulls back to rest against him. The heat of his hand radiates where it rests over Steve's heart. Tony curls his fingers in the soft fabric of his shirt, lashes dipping when Steve holds him tightly, one palm splayed over the small of his back.
“Hey, that's, that's not true.” Tony mutters.
“ETA, two minutes to sight, what have we got?”  Widow asked when he boarded the shiny hovering plane waiting for him on the landing pad.
He is running through a field, chasing a specter he no longer remembers the look of when he sees him; an indistinct shape far off on a verdant hill, standing in front of a towering mansion. Blue eyes. He thinks, as his shape begins to take form. Blue eyes and hair darker than the sticks of charcoal he uses for sketching. Steve turns away from that specter, away from the past, and he reaches, pulling away from the broken wreck of a plane around him, he reaches towards this familiar yet unfamiliar face, bright, so bright, like a lit candle wick on the darkest of nights.
“I’m the pack mule in this equation, Tony, ‘sides, this stuff isn’t even heavy.”  It wasn’t, he wasn’t lying about that.  He knew Tony probably had all sorts of tech in his bags, but all of it was about as light as air, and his clothing didn’t rate much weight either.
“Where were we?” Steve slides his hands up his thighs, leaning in to press quick little kisses to Tony's lips. Tony likes where this is going, and where it is going seems to be right into the realm of Tony's fantasies. Never let it be said that a young Tony Stark had not entertained many a fantasy about Captain America and what he might get up to in the backseat of a car. His fantasies then had not included how fantastic Steve's hands feel cupping his ass, nor how absolutely intense Steve's kisses are when he's aroused and interested. God, Steve is going to be the death of him.
“Steve,”  Dr. Erskine paused, flipping Steve’s folder open, smoothing the pages down with practiced ease.  “I am certain you have already noticed that this is no regular recruitment office.”  He smiled crookedly, and Steve looked around, offering a tentative smile in return.
“Uhhhhh.” Points for intelligence Stark. Steve is starting to hunch in on himself, and that is just not on. “Is that Tiramisu?” He asks for lack of a better starter.
Loss is something he knows intimately. Losing Tony is not an option though, he can't accept it. Despite the work Doctor Acharya has begun putting in, it's still far, far too soon, his mind shies away from even contemplating a reality without the man he loves. He would do anything to keep Tony at his side, now if only he could get Tony to believe that. Loving Tony Stark is absolutely a bad idea, but then again letting the government inject you with experimental super steroids probably wasn't the best decision either-but hey, he can't complain too much about how that all worked out.  Steve is not one to shy away from taking risks. The fact that Tony loves him back is more than he thought to dream of. They haven't spoken of it much since their mutual heated confessions in that unused SHIELD room, and later during that terrible debrief about Stone-but the awareness of it simmers between them with every look, every bit of contact no matter how minimal.
Tony is everything he's ever wanted, and everything he never knew he wanted all in one fascinating and sometimes infuriating package. He loves him, he wants him, and it all seems doomed because for all Tony flirts, he seems utterly unable to understand that when Steve flirts back it's in the utmost sincerity. Steve
“So, pick a number, any number.” Tony says, indicating his cars with a wave of one hand.
Steve isn't one to nap.  Being a supersoldier makes that particular necessity all but obsolete.  Here though, with Tony warm and dozing against him, atop him; he finds that it's easy to close his eyes, to let himself relax.  Tony's breaths count out like a metronome, and the soft reassuring gust of his breaths reminds Steve that they're both here, that they made it through another battle, another week.
“Couldn’t afford it, maybe one day, after the war is over.”  Steve was aware that his survival was anything but assured, but relentless optimism and perseverance had gotten him this far.  It was a nice thought, having both the time and the money to attend a university, to sit and learn about the old masters.  On his own, he had read about history and art voraciously, but it would have been nice to have a degree or two.
“Yeah, whassa matter with it?” he asked, plucking at the material of the shirt. He supposed he was a little sweaty.
“No time to plan Cap. Everyone with superstrength, we have a Ferris wheel to stop from achieving lift off.” Then he's streaking off, Cap confirming and shooting off more orders as they all descend on the caped menace.
“Are you talking to me from my phone?” He croaks, voice thick with the swell of emotion held back.
”  Tony growls, all big brown eyes and affront.  Steve sets his feet on the mats, but even his strategically inclined brain is not prepared for the sight of Tony flipping his shirt up beneath his underarms, baring the whole of his chest to stroke over his own skin.  “Look at my nipples Cap!” Tony crows, and Steve really is looking, but instead of offering an opening for Tony to get a hit in, it just ends up encouraging Steve to tackle him back onto the training room floor. He goes down with a loud 'ooomph', struggling in Steve's grasp immediately; all that warm skin pressed up against Steve far too enticingly.
“It's good Steve, feels good, you always feels so good.” Tony finally manages. The words sound dredged out of him. He sighs when Steve shifts inside him, reaching back to pull at soft blond hair, twisting his torso for a kiss-which Steve gives him eagerly; their tongues meeting and breaths sharing as Steve slowly begins to move. The first thrust makes Tony whine, the second makes him gasp, pulling away from their kiss to drop his head back on Steve's shoulder, letting Steve hold him up with a hand splayed over his belly, and the other on his chest. He's spread wide open, right knee up on the desk, and Steve reaches down, touching over where they're joined, then getting a hand around Tony's cock to stroke him off.
It's difficult to remember that with the way Steve's eyes are locked on his mouth, particularly when he presses his thumb against Tony's kiss swollen bottom lip. Tony lets his eyes close, let's his head fall back against the couch when Steve's hips settle between his thighs.
“Tones, what have you gotten yourself into now.” Rhodey murmurs almost to himself. Tony huffs, dropping the comforter from around his shoulders to return the hug one armed. His cocoa runs the risk of spilling, but hugging his friend-his
“Dirty, Captain, who knew.” The little hitch of Steve's hips against his does not go without notice. Tony hums low in his throat, undulating against Steve in a way that's gotten him soundly fucked many a time, but Steve just lets a little huff of breath out against the place he's been determinedly sucking a hickey, leaning back to fix him with a searching stare. His lips are kiss reddened and shiny. The kick of arousal in Tony's gut hits him so strong and powerful it takes all of his mental faculties not to whimper.
There's too much banging around in his head. Ideas and inspiration warring with his mortal terror of this uncharted territory with Steve. In the end he knocks out bent over his worktable, head pillowed on his arms, a coffee mug resting by his left elbow. He dreams of blue eyes and a warm hand resting on his cheek.
“Thank you.”  he said again, and he meant it.
“Dramamine won't work on me. Not motion sick.” Steve has been poked and prodded with enough chemical concoctions to know it's pretty hopeless.  Iron Man seems to slump; compartments closing up all along the armor as he abandons his search for the medication. Steve opens the food pouch and dutifully pops a few strips of fruit into his mouth. More to appease Iron Man than because he's really hungry, and also to give his hands something to do. Something other than balling into such tight fists that he can hear his bones creak.
“Are we all friends?” He asks, later when he's had a nap and changed clothes. Natasha pauses where she's tossing clothes into suitcases.
“Shellhead, how long have you been feeling-let me help what can I do?” Steve takes an abortive step closer only to be stopped as Iron Man raises a hand.
He doesn't wonder if his body will hold out anymore as he clutches the medal in his hands much later in a camp behind enemy lines. His mother is long gone, and his old body with all its aches and pains is too. Still he keeps her gift to him close. “Thank you for keeping me safe.” he whispers to the shining medallion around his neck, tucked beneath his mail shirt.
His feet trace a path to a huge sitting room with floor to ceiling panoramic windows; muscle memory leads him unerringly. Beyond tall glass doors there is a deck, and New York City glitters with thousands of lights below.
The tracks wind through the beautiful scenery of the Great Smoky Mountains. Steve would be more inclined to appreciate a hike, but that's neither here nor there. People have been losing things along this path for weeks-watches, laptops, packs of batteries. It all seemed rather benign-Thor suggested fae folk, Steve smiles at the memory-but just recently an entire train full of people went missing. They appeared back in town days later, speaking of a strange creature
“Well,”  Steve said, sitting back in his chair, “I think you did the right thing, telling him off.”
, please Steve, fuck I'm so close, please, Darling, please I need it-need you, love you..” He babbles, as if he's lost control of the words spilling from his mouth, thighs splaying wider between them when Steve covers his body with his own to take his mouth in a deep kiss.
what sleeping with Steve would be like.
me Doom. What. What the hell?”
Tony blinks intensely, closing his eyes and swallowing thickly to hide the way his eyes may have gone just a little bit wet with Rhodey's whole I love you speech. Tony feels nauseous, undeserving. He takes a sip of his drink instead of finding a nice couch to hide under for the foreseeable future.
“We’ll sway then darling, it’s only us here, we can take this as slow and simple as you like.”  Tony says warmly, taking Steve’s hand in his. “There we go, now, just sway with me, put your arm around my waist.”  Tony does this sort of thing all the time. He instructs, and at first Steve thought maybe he was being patronized, but Tony never means it that way with him.  Everything he says comes without a shred of judgement. Steve doesn’t think he’s ever been with anyone who was so excited about the prospect of making him happy.
“Delicious, thank you Steve.” Tony murmurs. Steve nods dumbly, unable to speak for the next few minutes while tony settles against him and snuggles close.
“He has a chip on his shoulder you can see from space.  He got jealous because I brought you muffins one time.” Jan says, somewhat lightly, but the anger on her face is plain to see.
“Hey.” Tony huffs, poking him in the side. “Hey I didn't say that was a bad thing, lift up a little bit-” He says, coaxing Steve to shift atop him.
that hot tight place Steve has wanted to push into, wanted to show Tony how good it can feel, how amazing it feels to have Tony inside him like this-and Tony is letting him, guiding him inside with a sure grip and Steve can only shake, and shake and try to stay still.
” Tony grits out no sooner than Steve has put the lube within easy reach and stepped up behind him, the playfulness before draining away into something just shy of desperate.
“Okay.” He forces out thickly.  “Okay, let's go then, I'm guessing you all came in the quinjet.”
“Fury is full of shit a lot of the time, but he wanted you to be part of this team, even when SHIELD had some say in it. You know that.” Her words are sincere, her red, red lips turning down, and the grip she has on his hand tightening as she pulls him around so they're face to face.  “You do know that don't you?” She asks, eyes narrowing when Tony sighs, raking a hand over his face and shaking his head.
"Reveille, reveille,”  He said with a smile, but it quickly dropped off his face when he noted Steve in his sweatpants and shirt.  “Did I wake you?  I can come back later, sorry-”
“Steve.” He whispers, glance darting around to the other Avengers spread out all around them as the jet hovers up from the helipad smoothly. None of them seem to be paying them any mind, except Clint. Natasha turns in her chair, clearing her throat, and he hastily makes a show of looking out the window, whistling as if nothing out of the ordinary is going on.
“So alright, yes, I'm...I'm good, c'mon, please.” Despite Tony's obvious confidence in his ability to take him again with nothing further, Steve still drips more lube along the spaces between his fingers. Better safe than sorry, Steve would hate to think he hurt Tony while doing something like this-something that requires so much trust. Still, he can't deny Tony when he rolls over onto his back and pulls Steve close.
“You're right,” he murmurs, leaning down slowly, watching Tony's eyes grow wider the closer he gets, “wouldn't want my fella feeling neglected.” With that he drops a gentle lingering kiss on Tony's cheek.  “Have a good day sweetheart, don't work too hard.” It feels like the rest of the room has faded out when he draws back. Tony's eyes are closed, body swaying forward into Steve's space as if in anticipation of another kiss. Steve reaches out, interlacing their fingers and tugging Tony close to rest their foreheads together. Only to jerk apart when reality reasserts itself harshly via the loud blaring of rock music Steve knows to belongs to Tony's phone.
“I'm not going to Strange, he'll probably suggest a naked moonlight ritual or something.” Tony pauses, expression brightening. “Actually, you know what, I feel a kind of kinship with him, maybe he's onto something, and he
“Alright there Shellhead?” He asks, staring worriedly down at the reactor where more tiny hairline cracks have appeared on the glass.
“Sweet talker.”  Steve said, walking around to the trunk to grab his and Tony’s bags.
“Why me though? I mean-” Tony puts his hand up, staving off whatever Steve was going to say for the time being. “I didn't even know you were uh, okay with the thought of sleeping with another guy. But um, why not Natasha, or-”
“Go brush your teeth, Tony,” says Steve, standing to turn Tony towards the doorway, giving him a little swat to propel him into the hall.
The pale blue lights from the screen reflect in the futuristic looking lenses Tony has perched on his nose. Tony explained them earlier, along with the nifty little device spanning the palm of his flailing hand. Something about tactile holograms and their application to finding weak points in submerged structures. Steve had been fascinated, but what's new? Steve knows he has been in a near constant state of
Pink camellia- longing
It all fades away far too soon, but Steve dreams of him again, and again. Sometimes he is standing beside him as a silent sentinel, watching slim shoulders bow beneath the words of a man who must be his father. He is a dark shape, smoky and swirling with seething words and reeking of drink. He longs to wrap his arms around his soulmate, to comfort him and tell him the poisonous words spewed at him are not true, cannot be true. Steve knows his soulmate, knows his soul, knows the incredible brilliance of his mind, and he knows with unshakable certainty that his soulmate is better, and more, so much more than the man trying to mold him into something unrecognizable.
After the authorities arrived, and carted away the Masters of Evil, the team stood in the street, there was still Adhesive X everywhere.  Some of it was even on Iron Man’s back.  He didn’t seem to care, and seemed far more concerned about the state of the bridge.
There's a moment where he thinks he almost has it, but then black is rushing up to cover his vision, his ears ring, distantly he feels himself shaking, as if he's seeing this all play out from a long ways away. His muscles scream with tension, and somewhere someone is screaming, funny it sounds a lot like his own voice.
“Yes, although I can desist if you prefer.” JARVIS sounds almost hesitant, as if the idea doesn't appeal to him at all. Steve finds he dislikes the notion of not having JARVIS around even more. He knows the AI isn't a flesh and blood person, but he's certainly capable of compassion. Steve doesn't think anything but the feeling of love could explain how carefully the AI led him through getting his creator into a bed. Maybe it's all a program, code, but JARVIS really seems to
“God, Steve you don't even know how much. But I...” Tony looks so miserable that Steve wants to go down to the gym and break a punching bag or three. “I don't know if I can. Have this that is.”
“Do you really think this is a good idea, this thing with Steve?” He asks quietly, and Rhodey sits back in his chair fixing him with a steady stare.
That night when he finally drags himself into his room the events of the day are almost enough to distract him from the vast empty space of the bed. Logically he knows the room temperature sits at a comfortable level. Logically he knows with the serum there is no real reason for him to be cold, but cold he is. Holding a warm sleepy person in his arms seems to have broken the dam, and he wants, wants
“No idea about what?” He croaks, following Tony up when he rolls to his feet with one fluid motion.
“Happy I'm sweating, do I look sweaty?  Smell me.” He says faintly, words trailing off when Steve comes right into his space and tugs him into a sweet kiss by way of greeting. Tony throws his arms around his neck and makes sure to show Steve just how pleased he is with this kind of hello. It's nothing like the frantic clutching kisses they shared earlier in the workshop, but it still makes his body light up like a live wire. Happy's seen worse, he can deal.
“Yeah, hot stuff, touch me.  Here,” Tony slips his hand away from himself and pats around the bed for the bottle of lube, popping it open with a click, “Get this on your fingers, honey, make sure I'm all nice and still open for you.”
Steve felt he needed to show some initiative as well, figure out a little more about the team he would be rooting for, and the number on his new shirt.  The game wasn’t for another week, so Steve went to get his new tablet out and looked up the names of all the players on the Seahawks.
“Yes.”  Steve said.  That creeping feeling of unreality after a rush faded almost as soon as it had begun to come on with Dr. Erskine’s words.
“Yeah, how's the arm, mobility good with the splint? How's your pain, Iron Man told me about your little painkiller problem-” Tony looks like he's gearing up for another twenty questions, so Steve steps closer, crouching down beside the cushion nest to take Tony's hands in his, rubbing his fingers over skin that's still cool despite the heat being given off by the fireplace.
“I know, we're Avengers, we don't give up, I'll find a way back to you Steve, honey, I promise.” Tony sounds shaken. He hates being alone, truly alone-no bots or AIs to keep him company. Steve shuts his eyes tightly, turning the covers back and stretching out on the bed.
He lost track of how long he spoke about Sarah, but Tony listened raptly anyway, seemingly content to just let Steve ramble for however long he wanted. When he had to leave to take a call from one of the scientists in the technology division, Steve set about placing Sarah’s painting in the easel in the corner of his room. He would find a better place to hang it, but for now it was the best place for it.
“Stop looking guilty oh Captain of my heart, I'm fine.” Tony mumbles, cheeks pinking when he realizes what he's said. “
“Hi Steve.”  He said, smiled wide, and then looked up, past wherever he must have set his phone to make the call.  “Bambi, I don’t care if Wilkins got the memo or not, the plant looks absolutely dismal, how are my people supposed to work in those conditions?”  He looked back down, the smile was back on his face, he took a sip of his coffee.  “Sorry, there’s  rash of stupid going around and I need to remind some people that I don’t just barely scrape by safety regs, anyway, I didn’t call you to bore you with all that, I called you to tell you all about the wonders of indoor heating.”
“That’s because you’re sweet, and generous.” It was true too, he’d never met someone like Tony.  Someone so dedicated to making sure everyone around them was taken care of. Even the little things they might not have thought of themselves. Like the heated floors in Steve’s room, or the special groceries for each Avenger delivered every week.  He knew omegas were said to want to provide comfort and a sense of peace, but Tony really went above and beyond.
“You all really seem to like him, and he built the suit, why isn't
It doesn't fix everything of course. Tony still hides away sometimes, closes himself away from everyone, but he does it less and less. They're not flawless at communication, and there are things he knows Tony may never tell him, secrets he holds onto so tightly they may as well be part of his DNA.
“There,
“Then you be a good man, huh?  You show them how sweet you are, no one can say no to that, now what do you say, you want some soup?”  She moved closer, kissing the top of his head, stroking her strong, slender fingers through the mop of disheveled gold.
“Tony-” He gasps out, feeling his cock jump within the confines of his pants.
“What, right now?”
“Mhmm, yes, very convincing.” It should be against the law for Captain America to sound so knowing when Tony's trying to lie, really.  Tony manages to unstick his face from where it's been pressed against his personal space heater and gives Steve what he hopes is a very stern face. Steve smiles though, so he guesses it's not frightening.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Jan is his favorite.” Widow says, jumping out of the way as Hulk goes charging by to tackle doom to the ground. Dirt and grass flies up everywhere, Doom's cry is loud in the park, Steve has a feeling their early morning workout will be coming to an end soon-no matter how much Doom is ranting to the contrary.
After he finished eating, he bid Tony goodnight, and trekked back to his room.  Tony had looked like he might have wanted to say something, he told Steve he would be out of the country for a week or two, but that he would be back soon as he could.  He’d left a card with his number, and a tiny little glass square he called a phone, along with an instruction manual.  Unable to sleep after tossing and turning in his bed, he sat up and pored through the manual.  This little device could call people, he could watch movies on it?  Steve stared a little harder at the words in the booklet.
“Good morning Steve.” Tony says, a brilliant smile on his face that's still a little shy despite what he knows the man is capable of. Steve smiles back, rolling on top of Tony to give him a real kiss. It's tradition after all.
“Disregarding how wrong you are, and how much I do not care about the press and what they have to say about you-when you look at him what do
“That's his name on the sign Shellhead, don't be rude. I'm going to win him for Tony, what do you think?” Steve is already paying for a few game tokens though. The girl manning the booth watches him apprehensively, handing him a baseball to throw at a row of tin cans with rubber ducks stacked atop them.
Tony however, wasn’t gone for long.  He reemerged a few minutes later looking utterly hangdog and miserable.  He sat back down on the couch, his lips twisted downwards in a frown.
“Don't mind me, I'll just be here leaching your body heat.” Tony's words are slightly muffled against Steve's shoulder.  He presses closer when Steve launches them off the ramp and out into the street-and Tony doesn't like being driven by someone else, but this, this is nice. Steve is so warm against him, guiding them through the streets without hesitation. The wind whips all around them, car horns blare, the city is alive with activity, but Tony just rubs his cheek against Steve's shoulder, closing his eyes and clinging tight until they pull into the parking lot of an honest to god train-car diner.
“Yes. He'll only be
“Fine doesn’t give a supersoldier dark undereye circles, babe.  I’m a pro at not sleeping, I know what it looks like.”  Tony wasn’t looking away, this close Steve could see the flecks of darker blue in his eyes.  He smelled like metal, and the spicy, woodsy scent Steve had come to associate with him.
“Gonna go get the cookie dough for Clint, can't disappoint tweety bird by showing up empty handed.” Tony laughs, but it sounds a little wet. He swipes at his eyes with the sleeve of his jacket, waving at Steve when a familiar black Rolls pulls up to the curb.
for the art in this chapter.  Please go shower with love!
Tony nods, swaying close when Steve cups his elbows to draw him in.  “Goodnight Cap, no more punching bags tonight.”
Oh god Tony's blushing, how does this keep happening?
“Coming down?” He asked, his teeth were starting to chatter, the cold seeping in through the blankets felt amplified beyond normal levels, even with his ma’ warm and right there next to him.
“Cap,”  Iron Man said, walking over with his smooth mechanical steps.  Steve could barely hear him over the ringing in his ears.
“Here, let me help you out there, I hear it’s trickier with gloves on.”  The gloves Tony wore were a thin, supple leather, perfect for fine detail work, but he still let Steve take his hand.  They were standing so close Steve could smell the fresh mint on Tony’s breath.  He could have counted every individual inky black eyelash ringing Tony’s lids.  Tony smelled good, spicy, clean, and very faintly, a little sweet.  His hand trembled a minutely in Steve’s grip, and Steve realized his pulse was rabbiting away unsteadily.  That was strange, maybe too much coffee.  He breathed in deep when Steve fixed the first link in place, then placed his other wrist in Steve’s hand, easily, like he trusted him implicitly.  Steve imagined fixing jeweled bracelets around that wrist, the kind you might gift after bonding.  They’d sure look good on him.  Not that that would ever happen.  With that thought reality reasserted itself.  Steve let go of Tony’s hand.  The cufflinks glimmered at his wrists, they looked good there, like they belonged.  Tony was staring up at him, his mouth slightly open.
“God, fuck, I'm so sorry, sorry, fuck, fuck, but it's done now, all done. Does that...is that any better?” Iron Man sounds incredibly agitated, as if this is the worst possible outcome. Steve feels a sense of deep fondness melt through him even as his arm throbs in the splint.
“Little deeper, just, just...gentle, feels good, but you have to work me up to it, not a supersoldier.” Tony says, spreading his thighs a little wider on the bed and laying his head on his arms as Steve steadily works his fingers against Tony's prostate.  “Oh Jesus, Steve, okay...that's..” Tony groans, one of his legs kicking against the mattress when Steve slips three fingers into his wet hole and rubs at that tender spot while he teases the patch of skin behind Tony's balls with his other hand. His hips buck upwards into the pressure, and he practically writhes on Steve's fingers, blowing out a hiccuping gasp when Steve leans in to lick a stripe up the flexing line of Tony's back.
“I didn't wake you did I? Sorry I... Stuck on something, sometimes playing helps to knock the brain into gear.” Tony sounds regretful, and that just won't do. Steve shakes his head, stepping fully into the room and coming to stand beside him. The piano really is beautiful, but it's nothing compared to the man playing it. Tony's eyes widen as Steve reaches down to stroke a hand over his cheek. It's strange to think of someone like Tony, someone who flirts like they breathe, being unaccustomed to touch, but small touches like these seem to take him entirely off guard. It just makes Steve want to touch him all the time-gently, carefully.
I love it..please, want you so much.”  Steve groans, pinning Tony to the mats with his hips, drawing back to stare down at Tony. Steve knows he could come like this; grinding down against Tony with those sweet sounds in his ears, but what Tony said before has been rattling around in his head until it's the only thing he can think of. Tony seems to understand the look on his face somehow, because he reaches up, curving his hand around Steve's cheek and gazing up at him with an expression Steve never thought he would see on Tony's face.
“It is the twenty ninth sir, your date of birth, as Captain Rogers said.” Comes the quick answer. Tony blinks slowly, but doesn't offer anything up while Steve cleans them both up and tosses the wipes in the waste bin with perfect aim.
“Soon, honey, oh-soon,” Tony sounds breathless, and he's so, so hard against Steve's hip where their bodies align, the tip of his cock hot and leaking a trail of precome. Steve groans, turning his head to press a kiss to Tony's cheek. Tony shivers, arching his neck in invitation, and Steve kisses him there, bites gently the way he knows Tony loves. He feels the breath quiver in Tony's stomach, and kisses Tony more, reveling in the way Tony has begun rocking against him, rubbing his pretty cock over Steve's hip, smearing precome over his skin. Steve feels himself leaking in response, so incredibly turned on by this all he has no words. Tony turns his head, and Steve kisses behind his ear, nosing against the dark hair curling there. His hair is still damp, smelling of his shampoo; something woodsy and citrusy and expensive enough to make Steve balk if he went to buy it himself.
“Like Andy.”  Steve muttered under his breath.
His new body was tireless, he could run without losing his breath, scale walls, perform feats even the most highly trained military operatives would never dream of.  With Dr. Erskine’s death and the loss of the serum, the military knew it needed another way to sway public opinion into full support of the war.  There was still an alarming amount of support for the damned Nazis in the states.  Support Steve set about destroying with the movie pictures made based on his missions.  They were dramatic things, full of patriotism and bravery, Steve found them more than a little overblown, but they did their job, or so he heard.
.' Tony licks his lips, closing his eyes to pull himself together.
“Well um. Well. I.” His mouth snaps shut when Steve stands, coming over to link their hands together. The rest of the Avengers are silent, but he hears Thor sigh somewhat dreamily and pointedly ignores it. If someone had told him he would meet the Norse god of thunder-and that said Norse god would end up being obsessed with romance novels he probably would have had a few choice words for them. He's seen Thor's library though, the man has enough material to fill a book store.
“Usually three or four if I uh-have really good inspiration.” Steve says, feeling mildly embarrassed by the admission.  His refractory period since the serum took effect has been the source of a lot of frustration.  Tony looks more than a little impressed, but also more than a little smug.
“You want a kiss here?” He asks, brushing his lips over Tony's cheek. “Here?” He continues, kissing the tip of Tony's nose, laughing quietly when Tony's eyes cross trying to track the motion.  “Or here?” He taps Tony's lips, just barely managing to contain his smile when Tony's eyebrows shoot up in surprise.
“What?  Come with you where?  Not to a game in New England I hope.”  Steve grumbled when Tony began nodding and started speaking quickly, undeterred by Steve’s grousing.
He gunned it all the way to their destination, with Tony laughing and windblown beside him.  When they arrived and hopped out of the car, Tony’s hair was a riot of disheveled curls, his suit was still perfectly pressed, but Steve thought he looked even better than usual a little messy.
in private. Surely those freakishly large mutated arms of yours are good for something other than ruining my beautiful plans.” Steve looks down at his own arms critically, before shaking his head. He must be desperate if he's even entertaining this ridiculous conversation.
“But you're showing it to me?” Steve says, softer than he usually manages to be.
“I want in, I want a piece of the pie. Obie was dealing, and you might be playing house with superheroes or whatever the hell it is you do to keep your conscience clean but I
Moving through the mansion is second nature now, there's no need to look up. He's so engrossed in the article that he almost drops the magazine when JARVIS welcomes him into the workshop. Glass doors slide open with a soft whoosh of cool air. Steve
He knows of course that Steve is not perfect-the man lost seventy years, he has demons of his own-but Steve is just so
In the dark, Steve dreamed at times, and at others there was nothing.  There was no concept of how much time passed as he laid in suspended animation within the ice.  The only constant was the cold when he dreamt.  He dreamed of trudging through snow, of missions in the bitterest of winters, of campfires with the Invaders that did nothing to warm any of them.  Bucky was sometimes with them, but more often than not, he was slipping through Steve’s grip, plunging down into freezing cold waters.  He dreamed of fire so hot he could not distinguish it from the burn of the cold, and blood, and explosions so loud they were all Steve heard sometimes for what felt like days on end.
fought some incredibly strange villains in the past.
“I..I-” Tony stammers out. Steve shakes his head, kissing him again, gently, carefully.
“Yeah? Watching me do this sort of thing gets you all hot, huh?” Tony murmurs with one of his characteristic smirks. Steve huffs, sweeping his palms down Tony's shoulders, and kneading the firm muscles at the small of back. Tony groans, dropping his head down and pressing against him with a hum.
are also a hero. Shall I replay the footage of you saving that busfull of people and receiving your current injuries because you were playing human shield? Or perhaps we should ask those hostages you freed last week whether or not they consider you to be worthy of such a title.” Wow, JARVIS sounds annoyed, that's difficult to evoke.
“Still with us, no more memory loss, who's the president?” Steve asks, and Tony groans.
“That was George Washington.” Steve sighs with fond exasperation, sitting down on Tony's thighs and running his hands over all the warm olive skin laid out before him. Tony shivers, but continues speaking undeterred.
“Steve.”
“Well I figured you wouldn't want to try this right in front of the windows shellhead.” Steve still sounds a little shaky, so Tony steps closer, reaching up to stroke his thumb over Steve's cheek, then down to rest both of his hands on Steve's broad chest.
A cold breeze drags icy fingers over his face, and something tells him that's not right, his face shouldn't be exposed like this. Bright spotty afterimages flash behind his lids when he blinks, and the smell of smoke and burning metal is so overpowering he nearly blacks out again. Where was he before? Someone is leaning over him-speaking to him, blue eyes, blond hair, a face that Bernini might have sculpted brought to life. Explosions rock the ground, no, the street he's laying in the middle of. Something about the billowing clouds of smoke makes him cringe with half remembered terrors, the ringing in his ears makes his breath ache in his chest, and his fingers itch for a gun that's not there.
“I thought you knew, I,”  He brushed sweaty strands of Steve’s hair back from his face, “everyone knows, I just thought you didn’t want me touching you, the rest of the team asks and-”  He looked distressed suddenly, he held Steve’s face in his hands, “I thought you were getting what you needed some other way-Steve you’ve been dealing with this alone, how long, how long have you been feeling like this?”  He sounded almost frantic, Steve couldn’t imagine why.
He thinks with an air of inevitability.
Steve hopes he does too.  Rhodes goes back to the icebox after that, grabbing a few things, putting together a dish full of food he clearly intends to eat on the way to wherever his plans take him. Just before Rhodes exits the kitchen something he said truly registers now that the imminent danger of being decked by the War Machine has passed. Steve feels his body go tight with anger so quickly it almost leaves him breathless.
Steve thinks with resignation. They were going to go on another date. His glove is fully off now, dropped carelessly to the floor. Low heated words breathed across his skin make goosebumps break out all over when Steve registers what's being said.
“You think your boss would like one of those?”
“Tony, your feelings aren’t stupid, I did something that made you uncomfortable, that’s not your fault.”  He wondered who’d made Tony feel that way in the past, if someone had convinced him he needed to put up some kind of front.  He supposed that might be the pot calling the kettle black though.
his beard before pulling him into a kiss that's sweet and dirty and utterly ruinous to whatever composure Tony has left. Who allowed Captain America to kiss like
JARVIS takes particular amusement in showing him the stranger of the conspiracy theories, as well as the veritable flurry of activity that follows any appearances of one of his winter sweaters. Even the occasional hoodie seems to stir the pot. Tony frowns at himself in the floor length mirror near his bed as he does up the buttons of his shirt.

“So sweet, so eager, you're going to make me feel so good, honey, I know it.” Tony murmurs lowly, turning his head to brush a kiss over Steve's lips. He's pushing Steve back a moment later, reaching above himself to grab some of the pillows that had served as Steve's just moment ago. Those he props under his neck and shoulders, before fixing Steve with a gentle but expectant glance. “Grab my hips, sunflower, pull me up onto your lap, yeah, just like that,” Tony trails off, biting his bottom lip and sucking it between his teeth when Steve easily pulls him up, tucking his own legs beneath himself and kneeling up to give Tony a solid place to rest on.
“Go go, try it on, go.” Tony shoos him.  Steve jumps, grabbing the gear from the table and going to change in the bathroom Tony points him in the direction of. He feels giddy with possibility, Tony has given him permission to court him, in so many words. Steve is going to put his all into it, he has to.
anyone else to see it either. If people knew this side of Tony he would never get any peace. Steve understands the necessity of the masks he wears, even if he wishes it wasn't necessary.  He has masks of his own after all, for the press, for times when he needs to project calm and confidence even when he has none.
small. I am
“And who's fault is that, hmm? It couldn't be innocent, Captain America's doing, now could it?” Tony says, laughing when Steve ducks his head and squeezes him against his side.
“How much I want you, how much I want this.” Tony steps close again before he can respond, winding his arms around Steve's neck and pulling him down until their mouths meet again.
One morning Tony wanders into the kitchen bleary eyed and sleep mussed, and he looks so soft and warm that Steve can't resist giving him a kiss on the cheek. Tony blinks at him confusedly, a slight rosy flush stretching across the bridge of his nose. He doesn't protest though, so Steve starts making a habit of it; giving Tony a kiss on the cheek first thing in the morning-or whenever Steve sees him first. Sometimes that's the middle of the night, but tradition is tradition. Tony always looks faintly bewildered and pleased by the act, but after a fashion he returns the gesture of affection. Natasha thinks it's the sweetest thing she's ever seen, but she also makes it clear she thinks they're both hopeless. Steve can't really argue with that assessment, but he's
Steve huffs, pressing a kiss against the palm covering his lips. Tony's eyes crinkle at the corners, but the look of deep worry is still there when he speaks again.
“The world must never again make the fatal error of mistaking compassion for weakness, and while I live it won’t.”  it didn’t feel like a victory, not really, but it felt like something.  As the Avengers made it to the warehouse he had beat Zemo back to speaking of their own victories, it felt like belonging, like a team he could truly be part of, a world he could be part of, even if it still hurt.
“Not to be rude, but what the fuck is in my chest?” Tony grits out.  A round of swearing meets his question; the source of which turns out to be an unfairly gorgeous blond who also happens to be built like a tank. Actually everyone in the room is entirely too good looking. They also all look a little like someone kicked a puppy. Tony licks his lips nervously, eyes darting around the room. He feels like maybe he should be apologizing.
There were pictures of him too, with little accompanying press blurbs.  Pictures of him with other alphas, though he seemed to favor betas, but it meant maybe, just maybe he had a chance.  Or at least, he wasn’t entirely averse to stepping out with another alpha.  That didn’t change the fact that Tony Stark was a man of the future.  Beautiful, charming, with a megawatt smile that could give a fella chest palpitations.  The likelihood he would even want to make time with an old soldier, an old fossil like Steve seemed fanciful at best.  He could feel the drop approaching, but he ignored it, choosing instead to take a look at what the shop had on offer.  There were stones of every color, pictures of happy couples and triads exclaiming over their gifts, promises of love and bonding wherever he turned.
“A long time Cap, a really really long time.” Even through the voice modulation they sound sad for him.
“Show time?” He asks.
Some warnings here for:
Someone is singing a distance away, the accent escapes him, but he remembers this song. Pancakes, the blue eyed man makes them and sings when he thinks he's alone; old soldier's songs painful with memory and longing. He knows he pretends not to hear, because they are friends, and these wounds are still healing.
“All yours, god, do whatever you want, you're amazing, so amazing.” Tony pants against the pillow beneath his head, jumping just a little bit when Steve spreads his cheeks apart and lays something there.
Their voice trails off as he approaches, and he sees his soulmate there, bright, shining, clearer than he's ever been. His hair is a windswept riot of curls, blowing to and fro as he leans over the railing of the ship. Moonlight spills across his Saint Christopher's medal hanging from the opening of a dark winter coat, and Steve has no idea how his soulmate has found it, but the ocean is rushing in his ears, and Steve knows. He's so close, so close now, he can feel it suddenly, as surely as the tides battering the ship, as surely as the ice encasing him down in the dark. He reaches out, closing his hand around the swaying disk of gold, and his soulmate jerks, eyes wide and round.
“It will be dangerous, you may not survive it.”  Maybe another man might have asked more questions.  Maybe another man might have heard that and thought to himself that the price was too high, but Steve felt he had waited lifetimes to hear that, to see the look in someone’s eyes that Dr. Erskine directed at him.  Dr. Erskine had seen something in him, this was his chance.  Steve took a deep breath, and stepped closer to Dr. Erskine, to his future, and held out his hand.
“I don’t give a damn who you are, now give me back that bag or I’ll make you give it back.”  Steve said, the words coming out with far more bravado than he truly felt.  You always stand up.  He could hear his mother’s words, and he stood up straighter, took on the stance Lorenzo had taught him.
Next week. He thinks; watching Tony gleefully accept a shower of confetti and tinfoil thrown all over him by Jan. Next week he's going to lay it all on the line.
There were others after that, nothing serious, just two people taking pleasure and enjoyment from each other.  It was nice, and not something Steve ever thought he would get to do.  He tried his best to show his partners the best time he could, even if he’d very likely never see them again.  It helped to keep him from getting too sleep deprived, and it kept him from taking up the valuable time of the omegas working in military hospitals.  It was good, it was working, it was fine.  Except for the fact of course that he was still in the states.  The war was raging in full now, Steve read the papers whenever he could get his hands on them.  He got the feeling General Phillips was going to start pitching typewriters at him the next time he inquired about being sent overseas.
Steve sighs, but he nods, leaning in to brush his lips over Tony's cheek.  “Okay, just don't disappear for too long, fella. Everyone will be sad without you around, and I miss you.” Steve has that smile on his face again, the one that makes Tony want to write him soppy love letters. He lets Steve hug him again because there's nothing he can possibly say to that without sounding fucking pathetic. It's so nice to be touched gently, so nice that he almost doesn't want to leave the circle of Steve's arms.
“I really need a shower, and I've got some stuff in the lab, there's a lot I need to work on-” He trails off; Steve's getting a look on his face Tony knows so well. “But I'll come take a few minutes to eat first. Well. After the shower. Didn't Thor manage to make spaghetti yesterday? Or was that some terrifying fever dream?”
That was just the tip of the iceberg of course.  Every day brought new discoveries, new mysteries.  Jan helped him figure out the television, and taught him how to work Tony’s fancy dishwasher, she was sweet, tiny, and smelled strongly of alpha.  Her partner, Hank Pym was a beta, and didn’t seem too enthusiastic about anything other than insects and science.
.” Tony's moan is dirtier than anything he's seen in a blue movie, as is the arch of his spine, the line of his throat, and the bitten redness of his kiss swollen mouth. The light of the arc paints him in blues, reflects off his eyes, catches on the angular highlights of his face. Steve has never seen anyone still clothed look this debauched, he's also never wanted anyone this badly.
“Hi, welcome to Pinkberry, what do you want?” Says the woman behind the counter.  Tony doesn't think that's the corporate approved greeting, but he doesn't really care. The girl clearly doesn't recognize them, and that's so rare that it's worth its weight in gold.
“Thank you Jarvis. Where is he now?”
“I'm sorry.” Steve whispers, brushing their lips together one more time before pulling away.
beautiful. His own cock is so hard it almost hurts, smearing precome against the back of Tony's thigh in an pearly trail, but that hardly seems important with Tony writhing around practically riding his fingers.
“Yeah man, you're a regular hussy.” Both of them are laughing now, and it feels so good to be talking to Rhodey that Tony almost forgets his earlier anxieties.
“You said we would dance in the living room.”  Steve says suddenly, before he can lose his nerve entirely.  Atop him, Tony stills in surprise, a slow wide smile pulling across his face.
“Yeah, I'll stay, it's cold tonight, I'd love to.” Steve says, watching the flicker of Tony's long lashes as he fights to stay awake.  Tony makes a sound of contentment, rubbing his heel over Steve's calf where their legs are pressed together. His lips part on a sigh when Steve kisses his cheek. “We're just gonna sleep though, so no hanky panky.”
“I feel warm,” Is what he manages, it comes out soft, earnest, “so warm, I feel, good. I feel so good Tony.” He takes Tony's hand, pressing his face into that warm callused palm, mouthing kisses there. Tony sighs quietly, almost inaudibly, leaning down to nudge Steve's face with his nose so he can draw attention from his hand to his lips.
“Hulk trying to sleep, be quiet!” Comes the sudden bellow, both of them jump. Steve hears the other Avengers hissing various invectives at Hulk, but it's too late, the moment is broken.
“Yeah.” Steve says, kissing him again. “We are.”
Steve had been with other alphas before, he knew his cock was too big for it to be really all that comfortable for another alpha.  Back in the war there were several he’d spent the night with, and more often than not when he’d dropped his trousers, he was met with trepidation from his alpha partners, and most of the betas as well.  So he’d bottomed, and it had been good, it had been great, truth be told.  He liked it, the feeling of something inside him, hand on his hips, or his shoulders, anything, the way his partners talked to him, praised him.  It wasn’t always the easiest thing, but he could take it, he would take it for Tony, God he’d give it up the best Tony had ever had.
He drinks and it does nothing to quieten his mind. There is no time to properly grieve what has been lost, nor even a body to bury. Bucky is gone, and even the taste of his favorite alcohol brings Steve no comfort.
and he's probably not even aware Steve is there, half asleep as he is.
“Summit Diner, didn't think it was still open, but JARVIS found it for me.” Steve says, helping him off the back of the bike.
The dreams that night are warm.
Clint Barton was also a beta, as he figured out while sparring with him in the training room.  They had gotten up close and personal while Steve wrestled him to the ground, and the scent of clean water and rosemary hit his nose.  He’d gotten a talking to about being too big for his britches that left him grinning for the rest of the day.  Clint was a mouthy fella, he felt like Bucky would have probably gotten along with him.
Still, he takes the time to arrange his new plush carefully atop the chest of drawers opposite his bed; fiddling with it until it can stand on its own leaned up against the wall. Behind him Steve has gotten up. He slips up behind Tony, tapping his shoulder to collect on his goodbye kiss. Tony really doesn't want to leave, but he has an appointment to make.
“Of course. I'm a monogamist now, only the best for my Rhodey bear, pookie poo, pumpkin pie.” Tony coos to a stony faced reception.  Rhodes glares, but he looks used to this sort of behavior, and the corners of his lips twitch tellingly. Steve feels his face go a little pink. He wouldn't mind it if Mister Stark had a few sweet names for him.
He felt good, purposeful, working towards an objective. Time flew by up at cruising altitude, the rush of rut honing his focus in on the task at hand, until Mamula came into view in the distance. The sun was just beginning to rise, providing a cover for Steve to angle the plane into, something for the stealth reflector panels to mimic. He went for a landing close to the shore, bringing the quinjet down so that the sound of the landing gear was masked by the crashing of the surf.
“Stop sassing me, I have watches wherever I like.”  Tony sauntered a little closer to Steve, he wondered how he did that, fully armored as he was.  It was sure nice to look at though.  “See you soon.”  He said, dropping his voice lower, only for Steve’s ears.  Steve felt himself turn a little red, beside him at the table, Natasha piled his plate with food, she didn’t say anything, but she looked a little worried.
“I’m going to bed.”  He announced to the room, like a bozo.  Tony looked up from his tablet, clearly startled.
“The question is, what do you want.  Why did you chase those two men?  They surely could have killed you had it gone wrong.  Were you hoping for a reward, here, have this.”  The man reached in his pocket to draw out a crisp twenty dollar bill.  Steve felt anger flare hot and bright once more.
Steve shuts his eyes in relief. That's definitely not a no.  “Let me show you then. Can I, can I try?” He steps close, gaze moving over Tony's face searchingly.
“C'mon guys, let's get back, Cap has a date.” Jan's voice disrupts his train of thought. Steve's ears pink slightly, but they're beneath he cowl, no one will ever be the wiser. He clips the shield across his back before piling into the quinjet with the rest of the non-fliers.
“So Tony, what about dessert?”  He says when his plate is thoroughly scraped clean, their wine bottle empty.  Beneath the table their ankles brush, and Steve grabs Tony’s wrist on impulse to press a kiss over the back of his hand.
“Tony, Tony, look at me, hey, come back here, fella.” Steve's face swims back into focus when he opens his eyes. Funny, he doesn't even remember having closed them.
“You forget your entire life, but you still remember that, man I have the worst luck.” He says, shaking his head, but there's a wide smile breaking out across his face. “Call me Rhodey.”
“Wait, you didn't mention Cap in that list.” Sam says, all of them have stopped to watch Hulk toss a screaming Doom around like a rag-doll.
“That so, and here I thought a futurist like you woulda seen this coming.” He means to, well he doesn't really know what he means to do. The sight of Tony all hot and bothered beneath him with his shirt rucked up into something more like a necklace than a piece of clothing registers with sudden clarity in his mind. His creeping fingers gentle against Tony's stomach, the touch becoming featherlight over the firm muscle there. Tony stills, making a soft questioning sound when Steve touches over his hipbones, then further up, ghosting over heated flushed skin. Tony sucks in a sharp breath, goosebumps breaking out everywhere, and Steve bites his lip as he feels a shiver work through the body beneath his.
Not good enough for you, no matter how hot you looked in them.” He says, and Steve can feel a rant coming.  Steve just lets him go, all flailing hands and big expressive eyes. He's such a spitfire.
“Right,”  Tony said, and licked his lips, Steve felt himself go hot, the still lingering rush was not helping matters at all, “well then Steve, come on down to the kitchen, I was talking to Jarvis, and we thought maybe you might like some soup, but if that’s a no, then I’ve got a basket full of delivery menus you can look through.”  He turned as Steve released his forearm.  Steve was immediately sad to lose the warmth of him, but he stayed by Steve’s side while leaving the gym and getting into the elevator.
Steve put the cufflinks away in his nightstand, nestled atop the box holding the chains.  His teeth chattered with imagined cold.  Steve kicked his boots off, stripped off his uniform and put on the sweats Tony gave him that first night in the mansion.  The shivers persisted even as he climbed into bed beneath the mountain of covers.
Tony comes out of his trauma fueled dissociative engineering fugue a few days later. He's cocooned in a soft blanket, curled on his side on a cot in the lab. The bruising around the reactor is a distant faded ache, but his clavicles still pop uncomfortably when he rolls over onto his back to pat around the blankets for his phone. It's still unlocked when he grabs it, the messages displayed indicating he's spent the last while excitedly rambling about a thousand different ideas to a combination of Rhodey, Pepper, and surprisingly Thor. Although the last seems to have commandeered Clint's phone in order to have the conversation. For some reason Thor seems to believe having a cellphone is some sort of affront to his Asgardian sensibilities-something something
“I really do want to find a way to help you with that though Steve. That's a huge problem with the serum.” Tony squirms out of his arms, taking Steve's arm by the wrist to tug him from the room and down the hall towards the elevator.
“Might be cheesy but it's true, don't keep me waiting too long now, you've been driving me crazy forever.”  Steve says, settling back with an almost full bottle of something in a sleek black bottle proclaiming itself to be water based.  Steve doesn't recognize the brand, but he figures if it's in Tony's stash it must be good.  Tony gapes at him, at a loss for words as he slicks up his palm and gives his cock one long pull.
not real. Fury said it himself.”  And Fury may not have any power over the team anymore, not since Tony became their backer-but his words still burned.
Back in the room, there was a neatly folded stack of clothes with a little note atop them written in sharp geometric print.  “
“Nah, pretty sure both Thor and Hulk take that cake easy.” Steve doesn't find the admission difficult, it's not as if he's insecure, despite Hulk thinking everything is an excuse for a competition-usually a very destructive one at that.
“C'mon, let's go see, I bet she's an Iron Man fan.” He suggests, already pushing away from their tucked away spot.  Tony brightens, both of them trudging across crunching snow to come stand by the wailing little one.
He sees red.
“Tony-” He murmurs, when Tony scrapes short blunt nails over his back, body arching against his in a long sinuous roll of motion.
at his worst, but that doesn't make it any easier. For one thing, Rhodey's lowest is still a hell of a lot prettier and better adjusted than his own.  Some ugly part of him that sounds a lot like his dad keeps telling him he needs to suck it up, be a man-Stark men are made of iron.
“Aw sweetheart, don't start with that again.”  Steve sighs, squeezing his arms around Tony snugly.
“God he does, if I have to hear about it any more I'm going to club him over the head. Tony's just.” Rhodes looks over to where the man in question is deep in conversation with Jan. “Look, let's talk somewhere else.” Steve nods, following Rhodes to an empty room, slumping down into a chair morosely. Rhodes eyes him for a moment, sighing and shaking his head in clear sympathy.
“Uh. Um.” He stutters. “Yes I am?” It's incredulous, a question and a statement all in one.
“Yeah Shellhead, 'course I will.”
“Are yours green and red too?” Sam asks, trying his on for size. They fit perfectly.
“Captain Rogers, I would ask you to please be careful.” In the silence of the room JARVIS' speech is jarring.  Steve stops, hands stilling like he's been caught by his ma up to no good.
A car was waiting for them when they arrived, a bright purple convertible that rumbled even standing still.  Steve’s eyebrows rose when Tony turned to him with a grin.  “Wanna drive it?”  He said,  “The GPS will lead you to where we need to go.”
need to know about this.” Tony's voice rises despite his desire to keep his head. JARVIS is silent again. Tony crumples up Ty's lovely gift and uses the repulsors to blast it into tiny scraps of paper. It's oddly satisfying.
“Cap's old fashioned, nothing more old fashioned than a handy in the back of a car with your steady.” Steve says, in the voice he uses when he's fucking with the press.
“I told you last time,” Steve ground out, and then he leaped across the distance between them, ducking down beneath Zemo’s wild shot to shoulder check Zemo with enough force to send his arms pinwheeling and his steps slipping backwards. “Not to mistake compassion for weakness, but you never learn.”
“Yeah Cap, there's still jerks out there who make it their business to be assholes, and there's still a lot that needs to change-but everyone can get married now, it's not illegal anymore.” Jan is speaking softly, as if she's afraid he'll spook and go haring out of the jet. Steve raises his eyes to look down at this city. New parts and old blend together down below them. Steve lets himself look.
“It's not a Turkey!” Villain of the week all but screeches. He's cuffed on the ground looking like nothing more than a giant plucked chicken, or maybe a woodpecker. It doesn't really matter, it's so ridiculous that it's all Steve can do to keep his Captain persona in place.
“That's much better, I've got dibs on the right side!” Jan calls, launching herself into the pillow pile with a whoop of glee. The other Avengers soon follow-Clint being tossed in with a shriek when he expresses distaste for the flowery blanket on his side of the pillows. When everyone has settled, just one spot large enough for two remains open. Thor gives him a thumbs up and a very obvious wink, luckily Tony is turned away, slipping out of his armor to walk around the cargo bay in the flightsuit that has filled many of Steve's imaginings.
“Get us that room
“Careful.” The hand in his hair stills, moving down to trace over his cheek in a way Tony can only classify as longing. “I think he's awake.” Judging by the volume and the approximate location, the person speaking is probably his dearly beloved head massager.
“Excuse you, I am
“Jan said I'd get kisses from my fella if I stopped. That true mister Stark?” Steve asks, peeling one hand from the wall to grab Tony's chin and tip his head back with that same careful strength he always uses when touching him. Tony nods emphatically, throwing his arms around Steve's neck and going up on his toes; an action soon rendered obsolete when Steve reaches down and picks him up by the thighs to hold him up against the wall. If he was half hard before, it's nothing compared to what he feels when that effortless strength is so clearly on display. Forget not being offended by Steve manhandling him-he's so far past not offended it's not even in the same stratosphere.
“Steve, the press-” Never let it be said that Captain America shaking his head in such a resolute manner didn't have the power to shut even him up mid sentence.
Steve sighs, kicking the covers off with a groan of frustration and getting up to grab his sketchbook. He draws Tony's hands on the piano, Tony's face haloed by moonlight-lips turned up in a small private smile. Tony's eyes with their lush fan of dark lashes, the pout of his lips when someone teases him not unkindly. He draws until finally sleep is inevitable.
Tony goes to wash his hands, straightens out what's left of his tux; just the pants and the shirt now-sleeves rolled up his forearms and buttons undone to show just the top of the vest covering the arc. He does up those buttons to hide it from view, smoothing the shirt down and stepping out of the lab doors once he's certain no one else is in the hallway. When he makes it out he stops and stares. A flower arrangement sits oh so innocently just to the left. It's in a bright red vase. A small card leans against the bottom with Tony's name scrawled across it in elegant calligraphy. Tony sinks down, taking the little card and gingerly shaking it from the envelope into his hand. It's from Steve-of course it is. Inside Cap's flowing script says a lot of things, praise, all of it. What is at the end catches his eye the most however, one simple question.
“I've told you, you can study my anatomy anytime.” Steve says, grinning when that makes Tony's shoulders shake with laughter.
“That's wrong, you know?” Tony deadpans, and Rhodey grins, then sags with a laugh with relief.
“No!”  Tony said with surprising vehemence.  “I want them!  I really want them, Steve, trust me.  They’re beautifully made.”  He was smiling wide now, Steve’s favorite smile to see on his face.  He laid his hand on Steve’s arm.  “Thank you, I’ll wear them and think of you.”
“Take a picture, it'll last longer.” Steve says with a grin.
“Don't be so melodramatic, sugar, it's only the little death” Tony says, the twinkle in his eyes glittering away in the low light of their room. Steve groans and knocks his head back against the pillows as Tony's clever fingers scrape tantalizingly over the insides of his thighs, and he lowers his head again to get his mouth around Steve's cock. Good God, Tony's mouth should come with a warning label.
“I’m fine, Rogers, I’m fine.”  Waters said, and promptly passed out.
“Goodnight Tony, I love you.” Steve pulls back, pressing Capnana back into his arms, and running his fingers through Tony's hair.
“Come on another date with me.” He says, completely derailing Tony's frankly obscene train of thought.
“Is not. Listen, maybe I just want funnel-cake okay. Stop judging, let me live.  Besides, Hulk is already playing.” Clint sounds so incredibly put out that Tony almost feels bad for him.  Tony tries not to think of Hulk, He can see him, off in the distance trying to win a some kind of figurine set.  Yeah, he's definitely going to be paying for some property damage.  He didn't even know Bruce was in town, or that Hulk enjoyed that kind of thing.  What do you know.
“You're gonna love the Mansion Captain Rogers. It's really nice, and I'm sure Tony will give you a good room.”  Wasp says brightly, smiling at him wide and encouraging.
“What a surprise. You jumped off a building.” Comes Carol's droll response. Jan boos. Natasha looks like she's about five seconds away from filing her nails contemptuously. Clint is still undeterred.
There was also a neatly folded shirt in navy, green and silver.  Steve pulled it out of the envelope and held it up to himself.  It was a little large, which was perfect for wearing over his uniform.  If they were going to be out in public, he had to be prepared.  He wasn’t sure how he’d bring the shield, but he’d manage.  Steve couldn’t help but feel excited.  Tony wanted him to come to the game, had set this whole thing up, and had even given him gifts to go along with it.  It was thoughtful, generous in the way Tony always was.
Flower meanings:
His contemplation of the odd little device Stark had called a phone is interrupted by a hesitant knocking at the door. When he opens it Stark is there, he looks nervous and sheepish. Steve is surprised a man like Tony Stark can even feel anxiety. Captains of industry are usually terribly sure of themselves. Here with it being just the two of them, Steve is struck with the sudden urge to draw the bright gleam of his eyes. Steve blinks, stepping back to let him into the room, feeling suddenly oafish standing by this beautifully suited man in the waning light of dusk.
“JARVIS, play something soothing.” He gets no response to that, JARVIS is very likely still angry about the whole Seattle thing, but the quiet strains of Maria's favorite piano piece still begin filtering through the room.
“Okay, lay it on me then, I'm all ears, sweetheart.”  Maybe if he says it enough, maybe he'll be brave enough to tell Tony how he really feels.  Either way, the endearment earns him a long kiss that leaves him half hard and leaking. He hopes Tony won't be the one washing these pants.
After Iron man left, Steve sat.  He didn’t know for how long.  Minutes blurred together as he stared out the window with unseeing eyes.  The rush had ebbed, but for him it never fully left, and so he felt a clammy sort of sickness, his body poised at the edge of a cliff, perpetually unable to truly relax.  It couldn’t have helped that he’d gone into the ice while in a rush either.
“You’re so impatient, so efficient, an excellent plan if I do say so myself.”  Tony says, tapping his fingers against Steve’s shoulder absently. He settles atop him within moments, and Steve watches him in silence, taking in the dark sweep of his lashes, and the almost too deep hollows of his cheeks.  He wonders how often Tony actually takes time for himself, how often he just lets himself breath. Maybe that’s a little hypocritical given his own nature, but it’s still something he wishes they could both do more.
“That won't work.” Steve says, even to his own ears he sounds resigned.
In the quiet of the room Stark's breathing is underlain by a current of strain. The ever present hum around him is still there, but his breathing is louder. It sounds painful. Steve remembers being a scrawny asthmatic kid and not being able to breathe. Stark may not be an asthmatic, but he's certainly not breathing like a healthy fella, and falling asleep on the floor can only lead to a worse day when he does wake up.
being driven, letting Happy actually do his job had been a concession to appearances. Only knowing that they're taking a different route than the one used to get to the gala allows him to keep his very shaky calm. He takes a long sip of his drink to try and keep the nausea at bay.
She still smiled though, in the short times her eyes opened.  Steve brought home books from the library, and taught himself to paint, in the long hours holding vigil next to his mother.  He read about gifts too, about courting, and the particular way gloves could be used to indicate someone was sweet on another person.  There were a whole gaggle of glove wearing dames and fellas at school now.  There was no way all of them were omegas, but it sure did look nice on them, a fashion accessory everyone but an alpha might find appealing to wear.  Steve personally thought Russell wore them best.  He’d grown into his omegahood over the years, tall and handsome, with flame red hair and flashing eyes.  Steve knew he didn’t have a chance, but well, some part of him still wanted to try.
“Give it a whirl Dummy, strut your stuff.” The robot has a tiny plush shield strapped to its side, Steve's shield.
More often than not their paths cross, break over each other like the foaming waves on a rocky beach. The plane warps around him, ice cracks, and suddenly he is there; golden and vibrant and alive even in the shadow Steve has been resting in for so long. It is a surprise for them both, but Steve reaches for him again, gaze drawn to a flickering flame of gold around his soulmate's neck, and the glass of gold in his hand. Familiar blue eyes are clouded with tears, but the house they are in is unfamiliar.
“Go to sleep Mister Stark, work will be there in the morning.” Steve replies warmly.  Tony's lashes dip in a slow tired blink. He licks his lips and their eyes lock in the warm golden light of the room. Golder even than the flecks of warm copper in Tony's eyes. God, Steve just wants to kiss him so much.
“No, what kind of monster do you think I am? If I drift before his fireworks, you have my permission to scream in my ear until I wake up.” It's a pointless thing to say really, there's absolutely no way he'll be able to get any rest for a while yet. Adrenaline still pounds through his veins, leaving him shaky and a mix of exhausted and far too awake even as he arrives back at the mansion just as the sky is beginning to brighten.
“Oh sure, okay.” Tony nods absently, brushing debris, crumbs, and possibly plaster dust from his ceiling from the black material of his shirt.
“Am I in trouble?”  Steve asked, as the notion that maybe he’d broken some law with all of his applications.  Steve didn’t care, it was a dumb law, if they planned on locking him up for trying to serve.  He’d tell it to the judge.
“Did Mister Jarvis make this?  Tastes like it should be served up at some ritzy joint.” It really was good, and the scent of it, the taste of it was starting to make him feel a little slow and sleepy.
“Yeah sometimes, it's more uh. At night it-” Tony chews on his bottom lip, trying to think of a way to word this that won't put Steve into worrying overdrive. “Sometimes I'm more conscious of it than other times if that makes any sense. I know it's
“How's that?” He manages to get out, the low gravelly cadence of his voice surprising even to himself.  “Does it feel good?” He asks, turning his fingers to stroke around, until he's rubbing right up against a spot he knows well in himself, hopefully Tony likes it as much as he does. Tony's eyes widen, and his cock jumps, leaking precome out messily over Steve's abs.
He rested little, and slept less, the only pause in it was found wrapped in the arms of fellow soldiers, when it got to be too much and he absolutely had to seek the comfort of another person.  There were of course omegas trained specifically, specialized therapists for battle fatigued alphas and betas coming back from the frontlines.  He wasn’t on the frontlines though, there was no reason he couldn’t deal with this on his own.  Putting in a request to see an omega just so they could give him some peace for a little while was ridiculous.  There were alphas and betas coming back from the war missing limbs, what the hell did he have to complain about?  That and his instincts, everything that made an alpha an alpha, it was ramped up in him, made more.  He worried that an omega touching him would be hurt by it somehow, that it would be too much, that the energy and emotional transfer from him would leave them broken in some way.  He couldn't risk it, no matter how much the idea appealed to him, how much he longed for it.
All in all-he thinks-a normal Avengers movie night.
The loud blaring of sirens announces the arrival of the police as they all watch Thor consume a tub of dessert almost as big as his head. Steve sighs. It looks like their villain of the week doesn't even rate a SHIELD escort. He'd like to have a word with said police concerning calling them out for ridiculous things, but that's time he would rather spend with Tony. As if in answer to that thought Iron man takes off just as they cart the still struggling and shrieking nuisance into a waiting squad car. If Steve hopes they jostle the guy just a little, well, that's no one's business but his. High in the sky the red and gold armor gleams before disappearing from sight like a comet in a bid against gravity.
“Really.” He murmurs against Tony's lips, kissing him slowly, sweetly despite what they had been doing just moments earlier.
“I don't know that dating Captain America is a good idea. That's...that's a lot of pressure. It's going to be all over the papers, what a shitshow. It's a bad
Tony tastes of the buttermint candy he's been eating all night, and the sweet chocolaty after dinner drink Jan had called a peppermint twist. His lips are soft, but the contact is electric, buzzing through his veins like a crack of lightning heat. The others are cheering, but they seem far away. Tony gasps; mouth opening slightly beneath his, and Steve takes that invitation for all it's worth, licking into Tony's mouth, kissing him and kissing him and kissing him until he feels Tony's back hit a wall. The headband slips down, hitting the floor with a soft thump. Tony breaks away to lay his head on Steve's shoulder, breath coming in panting gasps, fingers clutching at Steve's sweater tightly enough to bunch the fabric.
By the time they all start shuffling off to sleep Steve has calmed somewhat. Or at least enough to walk around without hunching over. He takes the rainflap off the top of the tent, rolling it up and securing it with the thin Velcro straps along the side of the tent.
“Okay, sure thing then fella, I won’t press, but, you know, if you ever need an ear, I’ve got your back, Iron Man.”  He said, unwinding his arm from around Tony to take both of his gloved hands.  He rubbed his thumbs over the smooth leather covering Tony’s knuckles, and Tony just stared as if he’d never seen anything like him before.
“Hey, it's not a bad thing, don't be like that Tones.” Rhodey has his back obviously, Tony loves him.
That seems to satisfy all of them, but the atmosphere is still tense; charged when they all grab a suitcase and lead him out into the hallway. Tony bounces on the balls of his feet in agitation. His fingers twitch. It feels like he should be doing
“Sure thing Sweetheart, but you better tell me if I'm too hard on your old bones.”  Steve says, leaning down to drop a tiny kiss on the tip of Tony's nose.  Tony just glares, hopping to his feet when Steve rolls from atop him and helps him up.
They end up making it in an hour and a half, Clint has a fit when they arrive at the campsite, but gamely agrees to the the terms of the bet once he's done throwing himself on the ground. Tony is bright eyed and windswept, all but dancing into Steve's space to gloat about their victory. His lips are reddened by the wind, Steve's eyes zero in on them, and he's coming closer, wrapping an arm around Tony's waist, pulling him close. Tony blinks, throwing his arms around Steve's neck seemingly without a second thought. To the right he hears Natasha grumbling something that sounds like 'just kiss him already' He wants to turn to her and tell her he's
Their lips are so close that their breath mingles. Tony's eyes have fallen shut, lashes casting dark sooty shadows over the sharp cut of his cheekbones. It's too much to resist, or it would be if his Avenger's Communicator hadn't picked that very moment to start singing a swan song for their moment.
Sometimes he catches whiffs of cologne. It’s woodsy and fresh, similar but different to Howard’s favorite scent-and he wonders, locked away in his room, drawing the watery shapes he sees in dreams across paper-he wonders if his other half is his father’s age.  Thinks of the whispers that follow Howard.  “Such a young son” they say, reading his father’s gray hair like the rings on a tree.  He listens and wonders if he finds his One, will they brush him aside?  Will they call him foolish, will they look at his designs for clean energy and solar fuel, and crumple them up, wad them up like paper, like his heart every time Howard turns away.
“Tony, Tony, hang on-” The rest of what the tall red haired woman says is lost on him as he loses himself to the dark once more.
“You’re an omega,” he blurted out, “this whole time I thought you were an alpha,”
“Sorry, sorry, that was rude, let me make it up to you.”  He said, putting down his fork and walking over to the espresso machine.  He would have gotten the stovetop coffee maker out, but Tony probably had to leave soon, and there wasn’t enough time to make a traditional cuppa.  Nonna would have scolded him, he could see her throwing her hands up in his mind’s eye.  He remembered how Tony liked his coffee, cappuccino was his favorite, he liked it sweet too, and piping hot.  “Here you go, hot off the presses.”  He said, holding the cup out too Tony when he was done frothing the milk and adding sugar.
“Good night, beloved, please do dream of me.”  Tony whispers, going quiet after that. His breaths even out and deepen within only a few minutes while Steve lays there staring out at the darkness.  He must have been so tired. The dark here though, It isn't the way the dark is back in his empty cold room. This is warm, comfortable, here with everything he could ever want pressed right up along his back.  He slips a hand down to frame Tony's where it rests lax and relaxed against his abdomen now, and twines their fingers together. He's not truly tired any longer not the way he feels when he finally falls into bed back at his place, and usually he would get up, go to the gym or go for a run, do something physical to distract himself, but he wants to sleep, wants to sink into this feeling of safety and finally being home.  So he does, closing his eyes and focusing on the luxurious weave of the sheets, the perfect angle of the pillow beneath his cheek, and most of all the comfort of Tony being here with him. He loves him, he knows he does. There's no point in pretending otherwise now.
“Oh-” He gasps, almost cries out, “Oh, oh Tony, so beautiful oh,”
“Oh!” Steve says, blinking up at Tony from his spot on the floor. “Geeze Tony I didn't bring the ring with me.” Maybe it's not the way he had imagined proposing to Tony, but very few things in their relationship have gone exactly as planned, and the two of them are truly alone so rarely.
boy, he needs his energy.”  The way he said it left no doubt that it was an innuendo.  Steve almost felt bad for the way Roy looked up at him and swallowed, but he Still clasped the guys arm nice and solidly.  Tony had said no to this guy on many occasions, he’d used his status as shareholder to try and con Tony into a date even.  Steve really didn’t feel that sorry for him at all on second thought.  The guy was lucky Tony wasn’t the type to knock someone’s block off for being a pushy horse’s ass.
“Sure it is.”  He dared to put an arm around Tony, holding him around the shoulders.  He was so warm.  “Do you wanna talk about it?”
They were not alone as it turned out.  They were in a sort of theater it almost looked like.  A huge wide room with completely incomprehensible equipment.  Lights blinked everywhere, and in the center there was a terrifyingly strange contraption that reminded Steve of nothing more than a massive metal chrysalis.  It was like nothing he had ever seen.  It was real and unreal, like something out of Metropolis, or the science fiction novels Steve had devoured while laid up in his bed with illness
In the end Bucky is right, in the end he dies long before they ever come across his soulmate, and he never gets his medal back, sinking down, down into water so cold it burns. He must be dying, he must be. The last thing he thinks before the blackness claims him, is of blue eyes, and a warm voice calling him home.
SHIELD picks that moment to show up-late as usual, but Steve has never been so happy to see agents swarming across the park towards them. Doom can't be carted off soon enough, he's already said too much if the thoughtful expression on Tony's face is anything to go by.
“What are those?”  He asked, pointing to the glittering things on the top of the stack.  White gold chains connected to two circles of a mesh like metal, studded with glimmering opals.  Julia went a little pink and set that box aside.
“Let me up you big patriotic octopus or I'm gonna-” Tony yawns so widely his eyes water. “gonna fall asleep on you. You won't like me when I'm sleepy.”
“You gonna dance with me Steeeve?” Tony wheedles, smiling broadly when Steve nods, settling his arms around Tony's waist.
why don't you show me.” Which one of them moved first, he couldn't say if you asked him.  They meet in the middle, mouths pressing together with such hunger that Steve feels the elevator drop of arousal like a crack of lightening. He grabs at Tony, one hand going to his hip and the other cradling the back of his head, leaning him back so that all of his weight rests in Steve's arms. Tony's arms are around his neck, letting Steve take all his weight as if it's nothing. It's like the kiss in the museum, but without the threat of discovery it's as if a dam has been broken.
“I'm fine, I'm not whining, this is unnecessary, and how did Clint wrap me up in this blanket so tightly? I'm trapped in here like a caterpillar.” Tony appears to be making a break out of his blanket cocoon unsuccessfully.
Back at the hotel, Tony  set up holoscreens for the Avengers to debrief with them.  As expected they were all extremely put out over not being involved in the battle with Mole Man.  Tony called Reed after that, and Steve staggered off to go lay in the hotel bed as the drop hit him.
“Yeah, kissing is, great, really great. Better than great with you.” Steve murmurs the last part, but Tony still hears him. Steve can't mean it that way though, not the way Tony desperately wishes he did.
“Yeah just.”  He shrugged, feeling like the world’s biggest dummy.  “Just letting you know.”  He said, and hurriedly closed himself into his bedroom.  There was silence for a few moments from the sitting room, and then Tony knocked on his door quietly.
“Please, yes, show me,  I want that, to make you feel good,”  He wants that more than anything right in this moment.  Tony is so beautiful, so generous. He feels a surge of love and contentment, warm and bubbling up within him as Tony rolls away onto his back and crooks a finger at him with an affectionate wink. Steve clambers across the bed after him, all knees and elbows it seems; so much clumsier than he has ever been on the field.  Tony is watching him expectantly though, and Steve doesn't want to make him wait any longer.
“Oh god. JARVIS, tell me I didn't kick Captain America in the nads. I'll have to move back to the Malibu house. Good going Stark.” He likes it here in the Avengers mansion, but if he's given Steve the old Tony Stark PTSD special he's not going to be able to look the man in the face. He supposes that's what hanging around as Iron Man is for. They won't even know he's here.
"Cap, Mister Stark is all too happy to make you all fun gizmos.  You don't have to-"  He starts, but Steve is clearly in speech mode, and picking up steam too.  He wonders if he can rig the armor to shock him in the event he might be dreaming.
surprised though when Steve goes for the whole backseat make out thing with gusto. Tony is definitely oh so very on board with this chain of events. They only break apart when Happy whistles. Steve jerks his hands away from Tony's thighs as if he's been caught with his hand in the proverbial cookie jar.
“N.O.”  Tony said.  Steve almost felt bad for the guy, almost.
“I will endeavor to do so, but he has a knack for getting into trouble.” Iron Man sounds resigned, and Rhodes' muttered
The whole day passed in a sort of fog, Steve barely paid the lessons any mind, and when the school day was over, he went walking.  He walked and walked, until he ended up around the gin joints not so far from his apartment.  It was late, the sun had gone down long ago in a brilliant show of oranges and purples.  Steve stared up at the hazy sky.  There was too much pollution and light in the heart of the lower east side to see the stars, but he imagined them up there, far distant points of light, and he wondered what it would be like to fly, to be out of his aching body.  It was a stupid thought, childish, but Steve couldn’t help himself.
“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have assumed.” Well now he felt like a heel. He still went and sat down on the couch near Tony, as close as he dared.
“Oh.” Tony says, crouching down by the white painted steps that lead up to the front door. An equally white long haired fluff ball of a cat with big orange eyes blinks up at him. The silence lasts a good five seconds before she's making a racket, meowing and standing up to rub herself all over Tony.
A few warnings here for discussions of domestic/intimate partner abuse.  It's nothing graphic, but it comes up.
“Doesn’t hurt, Andy deserved it anyway, he was picking on the first graders, and I dunno, I couldn’t just let him do that y’know.”  Steve felt strange.  There was a rushing sound in his ears, a coil of energy still coursing through his veins.  Sarah pressed the compress a little more tightly to his face.
“You’re sure?” He whispered, and Steve squeezed Tony more tightly against himself. Tony was such a study in contradictions. Steve wondered how it could be sometimes, that Tony could stand in front of a million cameras and smile like a shark, and then do something like this and think Steve could be angry at him for it.
“You're terrible. Here, do you wanna try mine? It's peach with sprinkles,” Steve smiles at him all soft and dopey, dipping his spoon into one of the many bowls spread out in front of him and holding it out to Tony.
“Y’mean, I’m like you, like dad was too?”  He asked, suddenly even more excited, because both of his parents were good protectors, good alphas.  The kind of people alphas should be.  “Does that mean I’ll grow, get big and strong, like you and dad?”  Steve had thought that he would probably end up an alpha, both his parents were after all.  As the years passed, and his body remained frail, sick, too weak to stand some days, he had given up on that dream.  A dream that he now felt singing in his veins.  Sarah’s expression did something complicated, her smile faltered, for a moment the sadness she often hid so well crossed her features, but she seemed to rally herself, passing him a glass and a few chalky pills to swallow.
“It's perfect JARVIS. Thank you.”
Some indeterminate amount later he realized he’d dozed off with his head on Tony’s knee.  The room was quiet, the lights drawn down.  Tony’s head was leaned back on the couch, he was holding his phone over his face, the blue light from it leaving the rest of him in darkness.  Upon feeling Steve stir, he set his phone down and smiled.
He thinks.
Steve was confident in the rightness of his actions until Sarah showed up, took one look at him and sighed out an exasperated “Oh Steve.”  She didn’t say much more until they made it back to the apartment.  It was getting cold, and would freeze outside soon.  Steve shivered, watching Sarah putting a cool compress together.  Her lips were turned down, but she smiled as she applied it to the quickly swelling side of his face with great care, the way he’d seen her tend to neighbors who came knocking on the door in the middle of the night.
The usual banter is much more subdued than usual. Steve notes several concerned glances aimed both at himself and Iron Man on their trip back to the mansion. Iron Man seems to be resolutely ignoring the rest of them, staring out the window and watching the scenery fly by with a palm pressed over the arc.
“Have you perhaps considered kidnapping him? Whisk him away, show him your
“Do you like dessert?”  Tony asks, voice soft. They’ve gotten through about half the contents of both bowls; Steve having eaten the majority of it.
“Not helping.” Natasha says from beside him, Tony shrugs, he tried, and getting Steve to let go of something once his mind is set is like prying turkey from an alligator's mouth, or something like that. Anyway, point stands, and no one seems all that intent on helping Hammer. Clint is just whispering '
Yinsen's words burn through him with more potency than any hit he's ever taken to the reactor.
the Dodgers?” Uh oh.
“You're always so warm.” Tony murmurs, eyes sliding shut when Steve nuzzles his cheek. “One day you have to let me study your biological processes.”
December in New York usually means cold weather, and this December is no different. Steve wakes to the sight of icy white falling outside his window. The floor is warm and heated when he swings his legs out of bed and walks over to his closet to pull on warmer clothes. Even if the cold doesn't affect him the way it once did, old habits die hard.
There was something else too.  Growing up in constant pain and illness, in the past there had been little time or energy for him to think about sex.  The serum had changed that, and changed it drastically.  There was no pain anymore, nothing stopping his mind from traveling that path.  He was nineteen years old and suddenly given a body that did not tire.  He thought about sex a lot, so much he probably would have gone to confession had he been back home.  Sex wasn’t frowned upon, but excess in it was, and he was sure he was committing the sin of lust nightly, just by himself.  Sitting in bars in low smoky light, he found his glances reciprocated more often than not.  It took him months to finally take someone up on an offer for a nightcap.  This new body was so strong.  He routinely bent metal with his hands, he’d snapped a neck with as little effort as it had taken him to open a damn beer bottle before the serum.  He was terrified he’d seriously injure any person nice enough to show him a good time.  That and, as his fellow soldiers felt no compunction in telling him, his cock had gotten bigger along with the rest of him.  Even an omega might have struggled in taking him, but that was not really on the table.  All the omegas he met while out had been taken, wedded or steady gloves covering their arms up to their elbows, fingers covered in jewelry and, their arms looped through their partner or partners’ elbows.
“Talk it over, let me know when we have a plan.” Natasha says, gesturing around the room pointedly. The space fills with the sound of shuffling feet and clothing as the rest of the team slips out. Natasha pauses just before leaving, fixing Tony with a sharp stare. “Thor is right you know, we'll fight for you, don't be an idiot.” She's gone after that, disappearing off on silent feet and leaving the room just as quiet in her wake.
“And um...what are those?” Tony's head dips, he buries his nose in the blooms, glancing up at Steve through dark lashes. Steve feels his body go hot with just that look. “Is this...is this some weird forties friendship gesture, because let me tell you, times have a changed.”
“C’mon smart guy, I fail to see how that’s got anything to do with you.” How Tony arrived there, Steve had no idea, but he wasn’t going to let Tony continue thinking his touch was unwelcome, or that he was upset about it. Not for whatever reason he’d cooked up in that genius brain of his.  He shifted forwards, closer to Tony than even before, when Tony first sat down. Tony just watched him as if he didn’t quite know what to make of Steve coming closer. Steve didn’t say anything, just scooted so his knee brushed Tony’s while he worked on finishing the pizza as quickly as was polite. He felt Tony’s eyes on him, but he didn’t speak until Steve looked over at him and smiled while he chewed.
“I'm here, and I'm full of holiday cheer!” Tony calls, laughing when Jan whistles. Atop his head he's sporting a red and white striped headband, but what crowns it grabs and holds Steve's attention. Tony is wearing a headband with a little sprig of felt mistletoe dangling above.
Steve was suddenly glad he’d run out of money to keep paying for alpha suppressants about a month prior.  They weren’t fully purged from his system yet, but he wouldn’t feel it as much when he got punched as he would have had he still been taking them, and if he somehow didn’t end up in traction after this, the drop wouldn’t be as bad as it usually was.  His last alpha cycle had been muted, the needy desire to curl around a loved one and protect them still lessened and semi distant, but he felt the rush in his veins that moment, the way the world had blown out and allowed his focus to narrow, in a way that wouldn’t have been possible on the suppressants.  He thanked his lucky stars that President Roosevelt hadn’t passed that free suppressants initiative yet, he needed all the strength and stamina he could get, especially while bronchitis stole his already less than stellar lung capacity.  He supposed he’d have been more inclined to be upset about not being able to afford them if he wasn’t always getting into scraps, but well, he wasn’t about to back down, and it looked like the other two alphas were not either.
“Don’t think you’re big enough to bend me over your knee.  Might throw your back out. You might have to use a winch to lift me.”
Flower meanings:
“Hey, what in the hell was that?”  Steve called out, nearly jumping as he realized Dr. Erskine and General Phillips were much closer than they had been before.  General Phillips grunted, fixing Steve with a sharp glare that still somehow looked vaguely approving, more approving than Steve had ever seen him look at any rate.  On most other fellas that would have probably rated as a grimace.
“No it's.” Tony swallows audibly. “I..probably should shut up before I say something stupid.” Tony's breath is warm against Steve's cheek, his lashes flick with movement where their faces touch, soft like the mink ends of a paintbrush. Steve has a sudden stroke of inspiration, a crazy idea that just might work.
“Wanna be good, please, Tony,” He says hoarsely, his voice is almost unrecognizable.
“Well-” Tony starts, drawing the eyes of everyone in the room. “I already know who my spotter is then.”
“Well Anthony Edward Stark, you'd have to marry me first.” Steve shoots back.  Tony looks duly unimpressed by Steve's shit eating grin, but glances back down at the little girl when she tugs on his jacket to stare up at him with big hazel eyes.
“Patriots?”  Steve asked, he couldn’t remember any team with that name from his time, maybe they were new.
“Hmm what for?” Tony murmurs, sighing contentedly when Steve kneads at his shoulders.
“JARVIS I am feeling a Thing.” There's silence in the lab for a moment.  Very likely the sound of JARVIS reevaluating his entire existence.
“Nah, got nothing on my sweetheart.” He says, eyes glittering. Tony groans, leaning his head against Steve's shoulder.
“Blasphemy, how scandalous.” He gamely kisses Steve goodbye however, waving him off with only minor grumbling at the inconvenience.
Steve wakes up, fights an old friend, and has his socks blown off by one Tony Stark.  Featuring awkwardness, Steve eating his feelings, and more pining than you can shake a stick at.
“Such a gentleman, as always.” Tony smiles, sliding into the sleeping bag and shifting around to grab a pillow, smacking it into shape before jamming it under his neck. Steve joins him shortly thereafter, slipping in behind him with a pillow of his own. It's quiet outside, night birds chirping distantly. Tony turns onto his back, then his stomach, then onto his back again, grumbling equations and rubbing at his chest. Oh. Steve thinks. The arc reactor must be bothering him. It's easy to forget that the life saving device probably isn't the most comfortable thing to live with. Tony never complains about it, and Steve feels suddenly terrible for never asking about it.
“Oh God, Steve,” Tony groaned in exasperation, “you’re like a dog with a bone, I swear.”
“Great, fantastic, filthy, wonderful sex.” Tony corrects him smugly, but the expression on his face is cautious.
is almost lost beneath Tony's muttering about betrayals and everyone having it out for him. He's not serious, and Steve just laughs, pressing a muffin into his hand when he flails in his direction.
“Yeah well, we're both workaholics, knew that when we started this whole thing. Right now I just want you to get better.” Tony doesn't say anything to that. He just presses closer, letting Steve rub between his shoulders, his breath shuddery against Steve's neck where he's hiding his face. “Your chest is really hurting isn't it.” It's not a question.
“Thank you, good, just stay like that. Just like that.” Just the rumble of his voice, the way Tony is looking at him as he scoots up-and he's so bare, wet between his legs with lube when he sits up atop Steve's thighs-it feels like he's burning up, that heat just growing as Tony loops the tie of his robe around Steve's wrist, and positions pillows to give him a place to rest his arms. “Gorgeous,” Tony breathes out, skating his hands over Steve's chest, pausing to pinch and roll pink nipples between his fingers. A moan bursts from Steve's mouth as Tony teases him there, and then his hands move on, stroking over his ribs, and down over his hips. “your nipples are so pretty, so pink and sweet, I could just suck on them all day.” Tony says, almost to himself. Steve just groans, feeling himself flush even more deeply.
“I um. I like Mister Stark a lot. I want to court him but I don't know if he would even be interested.” Why would a guy like Tony Stark be interested in a guy like him?  Still, he feels there might be a slight chance there.  Rhodes stares at him as if he's gone completely featherheaded.
“Definitely a no on the coffee then.  Feeling grumpy Shellhead?” A Tony without coffee is truly a terrifying thing, or a sad thing, depending on whether or not he slept the night before.
“We know, it's kind of sad.” She says, patting his hand consolingly.  Steve sighs, shaking his head, but gamely going back inside to stand just behind the ladder. Tony is in a pair of green leggings covered in candy canes, a red sweater with tiny red and green versions of his shield, and a headband with reindeer antlers. He should look silly, and he does, but Steve finds the getup endearing.
The next morning, he set out to De Rossi’s gym.  It was a few blocks down from his apartment.  Small and tucked away between a glasses repair shop and a deli.  He’d seen it a few times, but thought maybe he’d have been laughed out if he tried to sign up at a gym.  There was nothing to be lost though-people already laughed at him anyways-so Steve stepped inside.  A little tinkly bell announced his entrance, but no one looked up.  There was a boxing ring in the center, where a pair of betas were doing their level best to knock each other's blocks off while laughing.  All along the sides of the ring, men and women lifted weights, or talked in little groups off to the side.  No one paid him any mind, and Steve felt a wave of relief course through him.
He wants to pull Tony's shirt up-see how bad it is and what injuries lie below soft worn fabric. That would be a grievous invasion of his privacy however, and Steve knows Tony would have every reason to hate him for it. With a start he realizes he's been clenching his jaw hard enough to see stars. He opens his mouth, working the joint and sighing.
“I know you’re counting cards, you weasel!”  Steve said, laughing when Tony gasped in affront.
“Well if you don't I'm sure he'll be willing to take them off your hands.” Steve says with a nod towards their sometimes jolly green giant.  Hulk grunts to the affirmative, picking Tony up and setting him down next to Steve.
That sounds like a nickname, maybe they
“Yes, yes, we’ll go in, let me see who they’re playing,”  Tony picked up his phone, scrolled around for a moment,  “Seahawks colors, that’s who they’re playing, perfect, I love Seattle anyway.”  Tony grinned, triumphant in his master plan.  He drummed his fingers on the table.  “What do you think, Cap, will you come with me? I’ll buy you as many hot dogs as you like.”  Tony’s eyes were sparkling hopefully,  Steve felt any objection he might have had slip away.
“And slippers.”
sappy-sappy and cheesy, and so so
“I've got a crush on the engineer that made his fancy flying gig possible, but the armor is awfully pretty.” He murmurs, bringing Tony's hand up to press a warm kiss against his knuckles.  Tony sputters, shooting Steve a wounded look when that makes him spill some of his coffee. A cardinal offense he's sure, but it's worth it when Tony darts in for a hug before trotting off to get ready for work. When he turns back to go finish his food the team attacks him with questions. Their acceptance, the excitement they feel for him, Thor's encouraging clap on the back-all buoy his spirits for the rest of the day.
To that end he smiles, sitting back on the seat and stretching his legs out.  He hopes he paints as inviting a picture as Tony does when he’s lounging around.  “C’mere, sit with me,” He says, holding out a hand in a beckoning gesture “I’m getting cold again.”
“You're sure?” Steve murmurs against his lips, letting go of Tony's neck, scooting back to do something. What, Tony doesn't know, doesn't care, all he wants right now is Steve.
Belly full, and his eyes finally drooping, Steve shuffled his way back to his room.  He fell into bed with a yawn.  He laid there.  His heart was pounding.  Steve raked a hand over his face and sat up.  His phone was on the nightstand, he picked it up and pulled up the internet.  Clint made fun of him for calling it that.  He knew it was called a browser, but he liked to pretend he didn’t, just to get Hawkeye going.
“You're a very cute caterpillar.” Steve says, announcing his presence as he pushes off the wall to come striding towards Tony.
“Yeah.  Don't suppose we'll ever get that though.”  There's a part of him that wants to be public with this, wants to shout it from the rooftops, as terrifying and unthinkable as that is.  Their world is an unforgiving one though, and he doesn't doubt that making their relationship public would paint an even larger target on both of their backs.  Still it's nice to think about sometimes.
In his ears his heart pounds and pounds, his hands shake. There is not enough air in the room, not enough, not enough, not enough.
Iron man tilts his head curiously. “For what are you apologizing exactly?”
“Never seen that before in my life.” Hammer says, voice cracking like a teen boy just hitting puberty.
Steve frowned, looking down at the bracelet in his hands.  It seemed so silly now, the idea of walking up to Russell and holding this out to him like some kind of prize.  Or maybe leaving it on his desk with a letter of intention, the way the alphas in the movie pictures did it.  Steve felt his ears burn at the thought of it.  Of Russell opening up a heartfelt letter and seeing Steve was worth it.
“Jesus, Tony.” He groans, leaning his head against Tony's chest.
After the movie he treated himself to a slow walk home, contemplating the new blocking moves Lorenzo had been trying to drill into his head.  It felt like something was missing, it was hard to block with such thin arms.  Maybe if he had a shield like one of the knight characters in his ma’s old romance novels.  He supposed he couldn’t justify just walking around with one of those strapped to his back like some kind antique turtle.  Sure would have made getting swung at easier though.
That thought gets even more traction when Steve buries one hand in Tony's hair and tugs at it.  Tony sets his teeth on Steve's bottom lip to suck biting kisses there, moaning shamelessly and clinging to Steve's broad shoulders when Steve pulls his hair again, very carefully but firmly tugging his head back to mouth down his neck.
The pajamas are just as soft and warm as his other pair when he slips them on.  He remembers the last time he wore another pair of these. Tony's quick, agile fingers doing up the buttons, the pleased curve of his smile, the comforting press of his lithe body against his in the bed as he told him how good he looked in blue.  It makes him feel a little hot under the collar to think of what they had been doing prior to the pajamas coming into play, but lately just thinking about Tony in general makes him feel overheated and red in the face. Well, maybe Tony has always made him feel that way, if he's being completely honest with himself.  Accepting that, and seeking it out had taken more time though. Time and Tony Stark's immeasurable bravery in asking Steve for a date when he expected a punch instead. He can't really put into words now how grateful he is that Tony had that bravery, because now they have this, and it's really the best thing that's ever happened to him.
Tony just can't deal with him. He wants to yell at Steve that this is about him too, to whine that this isn't the best he can do. There are expectations of what Tony Stark might be like in bed, and this is definitely not any of them. He's supposed to be making this good for Steve, supposed to be blowing his mind; so he'll stay, he has a reputation to uphold. A reputation Steve doesn't really seem interested in, he's looking at Tony, down at his spent cock and the mess on his hand as if it's the best thing he's ever seen, and Tony has the irrational urge to cover himself.
"Tony. You live in my house, you've seen me pass out on the kitchen table. I think we're past formalities here Cap." Tony says, shooting him an encouraging smile.  Steve flushes red in remembrance of helping a sleepy Tony back to his room-twice now. He'd been so warm against Steve's chest.  He hopes even if Tony rejects him, he won't mind it if Steve were to help him out like that again.  It's comforting, getting to hold someone like that, the warmth and peace of it, knowing he's trusted, yeah, he wouldn't mind doing that again at all.
“No. You're right it's just.” Steve sighs, eyes big and so blue that Tony can't help but be drawn closer. “Do you really think someone would do something like that? It seems pretty dirty fighting even by a villain's standards.”
“Oh my god Steve.” Tony breathes out, his whole body feels like a livewire, his cock is leaking into his boxers. Fuck.
-Sexual content----that's right, the fic finally starts to earn its rating.  Discussions of a bondage nature as well although there isn't any in this chapter, but it is discussed.
He had a few moments to feel regretful about sending the question-he was sure Tony had better things to do than answer Steve about every minute detail in his room-when the phone rang.  The words
“Think I can work with that Shellhead.”
“Yeah well, the list of things I've done that you think are unwise could fill a book.”
“Oh,”  Tony said, going still beside him.  “Look, we’re on the kiss cam.”  He pointed, and sure enough, the huge screens around the stadium reflected their faces back.  Tony waved, the cheers got louder.  “We’re supposed to kiss but,”  Tony said out of the corner of his mouth.
“Not kidding, never kidding about this with you, haven't been, god
was really what I felt from you.” Tony said, a deep frown turning the corners of his lips downwards. He sighed, taking a deep breath. “Look, I know me touching you wasn’t really something you necessarily wanted, but you can’t keep going like this.” He said, scooting back from Steve, putting distance between them. Steve opened his mouth to speak, to tell Tony to come back, but Tony kept talking. “I can hook you up with the VA, there are omegas you can go see there, or I can find you a nice omega therapist...”
“Steve,”  He said, climbing into the passenger side, “I trust you with my life on the field, of course I do.”  He smiled easily, as if he wasn’t just casually speaking to Steve’s heart.  “I trust you to keep me safe.”
“Those for Stark?” She says anyway. Her expression can only be described as gleeful. Steve slumps.
His mind supplies. Jan must have made it, she is talking to a gobsmacked looking socialite in a long black and gold number of her own design while looking at him with supreme satisfaction. Thor wanders around in armor all the time, Tony supposes wearing glittery stuff is par for the course on Asgard, still-he's really pulling those sequins off.
“How close are we to land anyway? I'd go up and see myself but the barometric pressure keeps changing topside and it makes for bad flying weather.” Says the voice of a woman. Flying weather? English though, that's a good sign he's not in Hydra's clutches.
“I uh, yeah I could eat,”  Steve’s stomach gave a loud embarrassing growl at the thought, he looked down at himself reproachfully.  “Kind of always hungry, if I’m being honest with you.”  He began unwrapping his hands, he couldn’t feel them.  “Sorry if this is me being a little slow on the uptake, but, have we met?”  He hoped it hadn’t come out rudely, or that somehow they had met and Steve had forgotten him.  No, that was impossible.
“Hello there, I do believe I’ve been looking for someone just like you for a very long time.”  He said, in smooth accented English.  Steve took another step back.
“Why Cap, how lewd, I never would have thought.”  Tony throws a hand over his face in a pantomime of a swoon.
He's in a dark suit tailored within an inch of its life, every piece of it fitted so perfectly to his body that Steve feels indecent just looking at him. Happy has the jacket in a clear garment bag, giving him an uninterrupted view of Stark when he turns to take the bag.
Back in the war he remembered seeing eight pagers with omegas posed a little like that in them, only a hell of a lot more naked, wet between the legs, wearing wedded gloves, like they were waiting just for whoever was looking at them. Steve dropped the tablet on the bed and groaned. He shouldn’t have looked, he shouldn’t have. All of his fantasies were predicated on the knowledge that Tony was an alpha, but Tony wasn’t an alpha, he was an omega. Steve’s whole body felt hot, too hot, he’d spent so long feeling cold and shaky that it felt almost foreign.
People stand to speak about the man he loves, will always love-but Steve can't hear them over the rushing in his ears. Beside him, Natasha takes his hand. He thinks at some point he speaks too, but everything seems unreal, as if he's detached from his body and is just watching himself go through the motions from far away. When the folded flag is passed into his keeping the woven fabric feels dead in his hands, numbness seeping inwards to lodge somewhere just behind his heart. Steve clutches it close and imagines that somewhere Tony is laughing about Maria Hill having said nice things about him.
Steve was nine the first time he understood he might be alone for the rest of his life.  It was early, the few minutes before Mrs. Carmichael would unfailingly put down the newest Sears and Roebuck catalog and begin taking roll.  He remembered his ma’ looking at some curtains in that very same catalog just one evening before, before she had sighed, dog-eared the page, and put it away.  The way she always had when the winter chill started to make itself known, and Steve’s breathing rattled in his chest.  The way she had since his father had passed away, and their blankets had become thinner and thinner every year, and his socks gathered holes no matter how dutifully they were darned.
“Don't worry Tony, we'll get to the bottom of this if it's the last thing we do.” Says blond and punches bears for fun from where he's sitting by the headboard of the bed. His face looks awfully grim despite Tony's desire to break out into an obnoxious rendition of Yankee Doodle when looking at him.
Steve feels himself going red and curses his easily reddened Irish skin for the millionth time over.  "I don't know if that's what that was."  Steve says quietly, it could have been anything, hell, it could have been him making Tony incredibly uncomfortable for all he knows.  Tony'd bolted from the kitchen after all.
“Oh yeah, real titan in the industry, but you'd know that wouldn't you Tony?” Hammer continues talking, his voice grating over Tony's nerves like nails on a chalkboard.  Tony stares into his glass, watching the amber liquid melt the ice-changes in states of matter, transference of energy, the melting point of gold titanium alloy-anything to avoid really thinking about this conversation.  “Real shame what happened to him.” Hammer says, nodding solemnly.
Typically his second orgasm takes longer, but this time is different. The slick friction, Tony's encouraging words, and the sight of Tony beneath him all conspire to push him over the edge much more quickly than he anticipated.
“Oh god, why is it always with-” Iron man groans over the comms, shooting a focused repulsor blast into the metal monstrosity Steve is currently making into scrap.  “-the stomping, and the chest ugh.” He finishes, shooting up to catch Steve in a secure hold about the waist while the bot goes down in a shower of fried circuitry. They land atop a building in a skidding halt. Below them smoke rises from downed Doombots. He almost smiles upon seeing Thor hitting Doctor Doom with his hammer somewhere highly uncomfortable. Almost.
Steve's eyebrows raise, but his arms just tighten around Tony further. “You secretly a supervillain, married and got a spouse hidden away somewhere?”
Some warnings for panic attacks here, and there's a scene where someone throws up, so please be aware-here there be angst.
“Thanks for the save Iron Man, Avengers, is everyone safe, what happened?” He asks, keeping his voice steady despite the heavy spikes of pain radiating up his arm.  Iron Man slowly brings them back down to the ground as the others start calling in their affirmatives. Everyone sounds at least a little shaken, a few abrasions here and there, but nothing major thanks to Thor and Falcon flying the others out.
“Is our villain a carnie? Hawkeye, go talk to your people.” Tony says, scanning the nearby Ferris wheel and noting the caped idiot cackling at the very top.
“No I, I like that, I like the way you say it.”  He finally manages to say. Tony just hums, gracing him with another kiss, gentle and sweet as honey.
“That shirt is a personal gift to me, headlights.” Tony says nonsensically.
Just as he was happy to finally bury the Redskull beneath countless tons of a bunker when they blew it to kingdom come.  Just as he was to take a leap of faith onto Baron Zemo’s damned bomb loaded drone.  He was not as happy to see Bucky there with him.  For all he had tried to keep Bucky safe during the war, he was not able to catch him when it mattered, and down he had gone into freezing ocean waters.  There was no time to mourn, no time to do anything but cry out in grief and keep moving.  Countless lives hung in the balance, and would pay if Steve hesitated.  He couldn’t fail, and he had not.  The bombs never made their destination, and Steve followed Bucky long after.  As the water closed in, and darkness stole his vision, he only hoped he had done enough.
“This is special, we've...I've never done this.  I'm not making love to my sweetheart with morning mouth.”  Steve grumbles obstinately, pointedly not looking at Tony even as he hears him shifting on the bed.
There were unconscious Moloids everywhere.  Steve stood up with his hands on his hips surveying the scene.  Behind him the turf crunched as Iron Man walked over to sling an arm over his shoulder.
He's on his third mug when Tony returns with several boxes of sweet smelling dough. He gathers everyone in the kitchen to reveal his gifts. Big containers of gingerbread, sugar cookie, and snickerdoodle dough from Clint's favorite bakery. Along with more varieties of sprinkles than Steve thought possible, bags of decorative icing, and a sack of cookie cutters. Even Hulk looks impressed, gingerly picking up a bell shaped cookie cutter between his massive hands.
As if from far away he hears Iron Man's
“Contrary to popular belief I don't actually know
“Oh, honey.”  Tony smiles, but gamely lets Steve shift him over to the side and crawl off the bed.  “You're absolutely delicious, I don't know what you're talking about, but if it makes you feel better, I'll be right here, not going anywhere.”  Tony sprawls back on the bed invitingly, posing like a centerfold. Steve feels his resolve waver, but drags himself towards the bathroom anyway.
“You know me Shellhead, they don't call me the man with a plan for nothing.” Says Steve, and Tony laughs, leaning in and letting Steve pull him into a hungry kiss.
The flight back to New York was quiet, until the beeping of an incoming call cut through the silent hum of the engines. It was Tony, Steve could see him in the preview window projected on the glass of the cockpit. He was clearly at work, Steve recognized his fancy desk. He was holding a delicate cappuccino cup in his ringed fingers, and frowning down at one of his skinny little tablets. Steve felt his stomach sink, he hoped his teammates weren’t worrying about him.
Forget me not- growing affection, connection, fidelity, loyalty.
“You want me to hold you?”  Tony asks, already disengaging from Steve's embrace.  His eyes crinkle at the corners so that means he must like the request.  Steve hopes he does, hopes he doesn't think it's as foolish as Steve feels now.
trying to climb all the way up to the ceiling just because he could-even if the force pressed him down and made even the math in his brain slurry. It had been worth it for the thrill, and to see Jarvis' amused face when he came skipping out of the ride; dizzy and laughing and gleeful. Maybe it has something to do with his love of fast cars and playing with dangerously high g-forces. Maybe sometimes he imagines coming out of a roll in the armor that makes his vision black around the edges to Jarvis patting his head and asking him if he made it to the ceiling this time.
okay though, right Steve, headed back home?”
you Cap, did you think of that?” Iron Man sounds angry even through the voice modulation.  Steve frowns, locking eyes with glowing blue eyeslits.
That familiarity sends him seeking the source out into the hallway; unwrapping his hands and tossing the tape in a wastebasket as he goes. It's a piano score, and it aches behind Steve's heart with how well he knows it. Steve remembers with such blinding clarity. The sweetness of powdered sugar on his tongue, cherries, funnel cake, his ma's hand in his leading him through a crowded fairground-and a man on a raised stage playing a piano like a virtuoso. He feels like he's walking through a dream, past and present blending together until it's all muddied up in his head, tied together by a strand of music that makes his heart pound in his chest.
“Are you setting me up on a date? Oh my
“I thought we might have something nice and simple for dessert, something you mentioned wanting to do with-”  Tony clears his throat “your sweetheart someday.”
“What does it want, why was it here?” He sounds steady, but there's an edge of brittleness just beneath the surface that Steve doesn't like one bit.
thing.
“Indeed.” JARVIS says, he sounds more resigned than angry.
“Your bacon is burning.” Rhodes says, breaking him out of his inappropriate staring.  Steve jerks, hurriedly turning back to his frying pan and scooping the definitely overly crispy bacon onto a towel lined plate.
