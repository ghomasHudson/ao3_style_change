“I tell Wanda that every time she goes out,” Natasha says evenly. “But no one’s mentioned that to you yet, and I think it’s time one of us did.”
“Sorry,” he said, suddenly wishing they could afford a single bed like one of those fancy couples up in New York. He hated being so far away from his husband when he was so out of sorts. “What were you asking?”
the Accords, they’re at least palatable to him—the problem is that the team ran away together and he won’t go home until they all do.
, of all people? Steve isn’t the type of person that people like Tony Stark date. Tony should be dating fun people, people who know how to show him a good time, not placid, boring Steve, who only figured out he’s gay last week.
Tony smiles shyly at him. “Hey.” He puts his folded clothes on top of Steve’s dresser, removes Dummy from the bed, and climbs in beside Steve. He reaches over to turn the lamp off, darkness falling over them like a warm embrace.
, Steve relaxed a little bit. Surely, if things were as bad as Rumlow claimed, it would have been brought up during the meeting. Surely Pierce wouldn’t just let them dangle.
Steve kissed him quickly. “Would it make you feel better if I joined you in the shower?”
convenient, but that wasn’t the only reason Steve kept going home with him. And anyway, he was certain that Tony thought the same thing about him. It was easier to go out with someone close by and was a sure thing instead of trying to find someone at a bar or through an app, and it helped that they both knew what each other liked.
“We can do slow,” he murmured. “You wanna let me up so I can go brush my teeth? I wanna kiss you and I know how much you hate the taste of morning breath.”
The day passes in a blur of customers, the extraordinarily kind ones who put extra money in the tip jar and never once complain about the costs of things, the terrible ones who believe they deserve the friends and family discount he and Tony are offering for opening day even though neither of them have ever met these people before in their lives, and of course the ones who probably couldn’t find their way out of a paper bag—the ones who look at the label for the lust potions with its description of the effects and then turn around and ask Steve what the potion is for.
“You know I don’t do laundry, Steve. I pay people to do that for me. And I don’t think I’d subject Vanessa to this mess.”
But he wants to—go home, that is. He wants to curl up beside Tony at night and wake up with him in the morning and see if Natasha’s words hold any truth. He wants to rest, to put down his shield for a few minutes and stop running.
how much power he has,” Luis had told him), but it’s the other descriptor that Luis had used to describe Stark: “He’s just—he’s pretty, you get me?” And when Steve looks at him with his immaculate beard and fluffy hair and brown eyes that catch the light in exactly the right way to make them sparkle, that’s exactly what makes him realize that this is Tony Stark and not one of the other few denizens of Schitt’s Creek: he’s very,
He hadn’t known. And since he doesn’t know, it’s not like he has anything for him. Well—that’s not entirely true. He
And continued pausing.
Except—he doesn’t think so. Luis had described all of them surprisingly vividly for someone who goes off on a tangent as much as he does, and the Starks don’t sound like they’d be an easy group of people to miss.
“Now, where were—”
“Tease.”
“Deal.”
“Ah. Well. It’s hard to explain,” Steve says slowly. “But they
“He doesn’t love me.”
attracted to.
Steve knows better than to ask what her current mission is. He knows it’s personal, knows it has something to do with her past, and knows that she won’t tell him even if he asked.
“You don’t have plans.”
“Seven sound good? I’ll meet you there?”
compromised, and I’d almost managed to have it removed from the Accords entirely, but then everything with Crossbones and then the UN blowing up and the evidence pointing to Bucky… It’s not going away, Steve. Not anymore.”
“We’re gonna get through this.”
“Maybe? I can’t promise that the UN will go for any of it, but.” He looks up and meets Steve’s eyes, his gaze softening to something fond and half-familiar from their brief time on the team together. “I’ll see what I can do.”
Steve waits until after the press conference is finished before texting Tony. He’s sure he could have texted during and Tony would have just waited until later to reply, but judging by the rapid speed of Tony’s answers when he’s texted in the past, Tony probably has the phone on him and he doesn’t want to distract him during the press conference.
Well, that was rude. Steve’s smile dropped away. Just because he’d insisted on putting boundaries on their non-relationship, that didn’t mean he couldn’t care if Tony was feeling okay. They weren’t dating anymore but he liked to think they were still friends—or at least, more than just coworkers.
“Hear hear,” Steve said, raising his water bottle.
talk that much.”
“You don’t have to ask after him,” Steve says quietly when it becomes clear that Tony isn’t going to continue. “I know—now—he hurt you.” It’s something he’s been thinking about since their last meeting, something he’s been going over and over in his head, and he’s still not entirely certain he’s got it. But he thinks about how he would feel if Rhodey had been the brainwashed one who killed his parents, and he thinks he might be close to understanding. Whether Bucky had meant to or not, Howard and Maria Stark are still dead, and it was Bucky’s hands that killed them.
“Well, I’ve definitely got muscles.”
“Steve?” he called hesitantly, not daring to take his eyes off the light. Tony didn’t know what would happen if he looked away from it, but he was halfway terrified that it would disappear if he looked away, that he would look back and it would be the same as it had always been. He wasn’t sure which was worse—if he had imagined it or if it truly had changed. Neither had an explanation that he liked, and he was—not scared, he wasn’t afraid of anything, but—nervous, maybe.
“What was that?”
“I’m completely serious. I wouldn’t have offered if I wasn’t okay with this.” He smirked. “So what do you say about going to get a drink tonight?”
“You’re welcome,” Thor replies blithely.
“I know what happened between us,” Tony snapped back. “I was there too. I was just as heartbroken as you were over our breakup.”
Caller: Yep.
T’Challa chuckles. “To hear her talk, everything.”
Oh. “Oh. You’re Tony Stark.” He really is a genius. Admittedly, Steve kind of
“Your boy’s wasted as a sniper,” Sam says, shaking his head. “He should be doing persuasive speaking.” He smiles at Steve. “Bucky and I talked with T’Challa. He thinks he’ll be able to talk the UN into letting me try a probationary role like Scott, so I can see how this all works from the inside before I make a decision on signing.”
“Maybe
“He really stuck his neck out to get these amendments passed. My sources say he owes more than a few favors now and a favor from Tony Stark isn’t something to be taken lightly.”
Steve nearly reaches out to him before he remembers that he doesn’t get to do that. They may have been lovers in the—the spell, the brainwashing, whatever it had been, but they’re not now. Now he knows what had been behind that barrier in his mind: every instance of something seeming off in the fantasy, every time his mind had tried to scream at him that Tony wasn’t his husband, even the one time he’d realized that Wanda is—that Wanda is one of the

to remind himself. There were no feelings here, and there never could be.
“He wants to prepare you for taking over the company,” he says, knowing that it’s a weak excuse to a child who can only see that their father is sending them away to boarding school less than two days after declaring that life would be easier if there was no child underfoot in the house.
“Well, that’s okay,” he says, turning his attention back to his coding. “I’ll just finish the story when you wake back up again.”
“Not with what I’ve got on ship. I’ll ask Fury if we can stop in Knowhere later this week. They’ve probably got what I need.”
“Mm no. We’ve gotta be at the Rambeaus’ in an hour.”
“On the other hand, though,” Tony cut in, “you might realize that you

“Who said that? I’m gonna fight ‘em,” he declares, accent slipping just a little the way it always does when he’s riled up. “Shit, who thinks wantin’ to cuddle is a
Steve decides not to ask. Tony will tell him when he’s ready, probably in the car since he’s so insistent on Steve joining him for the vendor runs. “Alright, half an hour then, sound good?”
“Just think, you could have been—”
“Sorry, darling, what were you saying about getting a dog?” Tony asked.
“No,” Tony says, laughing again. It sounds a little hysterical now. “You know, back in ’85, Rhodey dragged me to this ROTC thing of his—I think it was a lecture, but honestly, it could have been anything—because he had this intellectual crush or something on this test pilot who was supposed to be there. Carol Danvers, her name was, way older than us, way
“What does it look like?” Tony replied impatiently. He nudged Steve’s nose with the cup. Automatically, Steve reached up to grab it. Tony gave a relieved sigh and moved around the table, dropping heavily into his seat. He pulled the headphones on and gave a thumbs up to Ward in the booth. “Testing, testing, one, two, three. Thanks, Grant. Sorry for running late. It’s a cup of coffee, Steve. You’ve had a hard week and I was at Angie’s anyway, so I thought it’d be nice if I picked up something for you as well.”
“It’s the only idea we’ve got,” Tony replied wryly, but he looked more settled now that they had a plan. He’d always been such a planner, always wanted to prepare for the worst-case scenario no matter how unlikely it might have been. Steve was a planner too, but he was nowhere near Tony’s level.
Steve hastily obeys, realizing only now how hard he is, how much he’s aching to come. It had been easy to ignore when he’d been focused on Tony, but now that his cock is in his hands, now that he’s jerking off over Tony’s sprawled body, he doesn’t know how he managed it. He whines, almost too sensitive, and Tony sits up, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck so he can pull him back down. Steve stretches out over him, supported on one arm, while Tony drapes one leg over Steve’s hip, urging him into a rhythm against him.
For now though, Tony was throwing blankets over Steve’s pictures hanging in the living room in a desperate attempt to rescue them from the rain. His own clothes were soaked through, his nice leather loafers ruined. He bit back an unhappy groan at the sight of them—he’d just bought them too—and went back to tossing anything he could find over the delicate and easily ruined knickknacks he and Steve had picked up over the years.
He walked away before either of them could respond or protest that they had plans, though Steve doubted that either of them did. He knew how exhausted he got at the end of a show, and he suspected that Tony was much the same way. The two exchanged looks, Steve’s irritated and Tony’s sardonic, before shrugging and following Pierce down the hallway. It wasn’t like either of them could say no, not without risking their job.
to tell him what would happen, but he’s not angry with
Square R5: U (Bot)
Steve jumps, turning at the same time and wondering when Tony had gotten there and how he’d missed the bell. “What, are you and Rhodey out to get me or something?” he exclaims, clutching his heart. “This is the second time today one of you has tried to scare me half to death.”
“They always make me feel better when I’m sick, and that’s what you are. You’re sick right now, DUM-E. But I’m going to make you feel better. I just thought you might like to hear a story while I’m working, that’s all.” He eyes his bot and then adds, “Maybe even a Captain America story if you’re good. Those are the
Tony laughed uproariously. Steve let out a weak chuckle and returned his attention to the fruit. He knew Tony liked Vision, and he didn’t begrudge his husband his friends, but Wanda and Vision just seemed a little off to him. Like all the comments they made about being perfectly normal—it was as though they were trying too hard to fit in and Steve couldn’t figure out why it was so important that they did.
And Steve can think of only two ways to do that, blackmail and sex, neither of which are particularly good to think about.
The night before the store’s opening, Steve can’t sleep. He can’t remember the last time he was this excited about—well, anything really. There’s just something absolutely wonderful about the fact that he and Tony are getting ready to open their store together, that tomorrow they will officially be open and they won’t have to worry about another opening ever again…
“Yeah,” Natasha agrees ruthlessly, “but then we met you as a human for the first time and it turned out you’re about as threatening as a kitten.”
[From
“And you want to understand now.” Sam relaxes. Huh, Steve hadn’t even realized that Sam is tense. “Little late for that, don’t you think? We made a pretty public stance against it.”
“Tony,” he says softly.
“No, my parents. Anyway, resentment is corrosive so I just wanted to get this off my chest. And I feel better for it, so hey! Win-win, right?”
He gives her an annoyed look. “What do you think?”
“Who?” he asks defensively.
He opened himself up on his own fingers, fucking down on them as he sat astride Tony’s writhing hips. Tony’s hands were wrapped around the headboard. He’d done it without being asked, which told Steve just how badly he wanted to touch him and how determined he was not to. For an instant, he wavered, split between letting Tony hold onto him and keeping him right as he was. But he needed this—this reminder that this wasn’t anything more than sex, not for Tony, but for himself. He’d set up these boundaries for himself, to make sure that Tony Stark couldn’t ever hurt him again, and he’d clearly failed somewhere because Tony’s question about going to see the fireworks had broken his heart all over again. So he
“Hey,” Steve says softly. “You liked it first. It’s a good name, a good idea. Don’t let him take that away from you.” Tony’s tiny smile grows just a little bit more. And then, because he’s apparently incapable of not ruining the moment, Steve adds, “So I’ll call you when I hear something. And if I can’t reach you, I’ll just leave a message.”
It doesn’t matter what he’s going to say to Tony, because as soon as Steve pulls up in front of the hotel, Tony is all but sprinting out of the front office. “Drive,” Tony pants as soon as he dives into the front seat.
“Still leaves Sam.”
Well, he supposes it’s better than Tony getting angry and throwing things.
“Go on to bed,” he says. “I’ll take the watch instead.”
he could be.”
Steve yawned and then chuckled. “Well, it certainly wasn’t Russian,” he replied jokingly.
He grins. Open the store. He loves the sound of that. Decided, he climbs out of bed and changes back into the clothes he’d worn earlier that day. No sense in ruining a new outfit when these still smell fine, right?
behind him. Tony lived in an apartment nice enough to have an automatic lock on the door, but he still checked it to make sure it locked.
“Oh, right, sorry, I wouldn’t leave you with Obie eith—”
He indulges in Tony’s warm touch for a little longer before asking, “So what did you need me for?”
Tony groaned and rolled off of Steve, landing on his back. “Is Dottie running it again this year?”
“Yeah, that’s what Peggy and Natasha said.” Steve rubs his hand along the back of his neck. “Look, I’m not really—people haven’t really liked my powers in the past. I didn’t have a lot of friends and I
“No, I—I get that. But there are grants that you can apply for, since you’re supporting local businesses. And I would be happy to help you with those.”
Steve glows at the praise. Maybe it’s silly, but it’s nice to be reminded that even in this oversized, clumsy body out of time, he’s still able to do some good. “Happy to help,” he says honestly.
Steve cuts him off by reaching across the console and pulling him into a hug.
“Steve?”
“No, it’s—I think he thinks we can be friends again or something,” Steve said frustratedly. Tony was happy with their arrangement; he would have said something if he wasn’t. Seriously, Tony had
, you have to have a high school diploma to take those so…”
Tony interrupts, “Come on my stomach.”
“Maybe
. Falling back into bed together isn’t convenient, it’s punishing yourself. And worse—you’re punishing Tony. I know he fucked up when you guys were dating, but using him so that you don’t have to find someone else is shitty.”
Tony flashes him a quick smile, more real than the last one. “Thanks.” He twiddles his thumbs. “So…what was that you were saying about Clint and—who’s the other one? I don’t know a Scott. Or, at least, I think I don’t know a Scott. You know, I probably do. I’m pretty sure there’s a Scott on the board, bane of Pepper’s existence you know, and—”
“So what are you trying to do about it?” Steve asks, because if he knows anything about Tony Stark, it’s that he always has a plan.
wasn’t sure who he was talking about. He was certain that at some point, Wanda had been friends with another woman who lived in their neighborhood, but he couldn’t remember what she looked like. Or what her name was. Or even where she lived.
“What if we found someone else to support the show?” Tony threw out there.
What’s next on the list?
“Yeah? Have you told Wanda that?”
“Oh no, you’re too late for that,” Tony teases, eyes glittering brightly. “You already messed it up.”
“Refugees?” he finally manages weakly.
Steve: But you don’t have a relationship. You have a convenience.
“Tony!” Steve exclaims.
“Nah, man,” Luis shouts from the other room, “my lips are sealed!”
“Tony—”
Steve: I think you’ll find that we can.
“I won’t,” he promises.
Steve knows exactly who he’s talking about: “Bucky.”
Tony.
“Better see if she’s got a bunch!” Tony yelled back. That rain was coming down
“Yeah,” Sam agrees slowly. “I’m glad it worked out this time. Maybe we’ll even be able to go home soon. And I’m glad that you and Tony are working through whatever mess is going on with you two. But when I let you and Natasha break me out of the Raft, I thought that meant we were partners. You trusted me during the whole supersoldier thing. You trusted her to help you break all of us out. I thought that was supposed to extend past that moment.”
Steve already changed out the expensive sheets earlier that day for cheap cotton ones, a little scratchier than either of them would prefer, but at least it won’t matter that they’re both soaked with sweat, hair plastered to their foreheads. He places the bowl of ice on the nightstand and returns to where Tony is standing in the middle of the room. He’s taken off of his socks and shoes, Steve sees, and popped open the button on his pants, but that’s it, which means it’s up to Steve to kneel in front of his husband and slowly slide his pants over his hips and down his legs. The romper’s shorts stop just below his ass, and Steve doesn’t even bother resisting sliding his hands under the romper to palm Tony’s ass as Tony steps out of his pants and kicks them aside.
“Good evening, America,” Tony said, launching into the familiar spiel. “You’re listening to
Clint doesn’t even startle. Out of nowhere, Steve thinks about a game Tony and Thor used to play with Clint and Nat when they all first moved into the tower. Well, they’d
No, this is all Tony.
“And War Machine?”
Dawn was just beginning to break across the sky when Steve woke the first time. He was lying on his side, Tony tucked up against him with one leg thrown over Steve’s, still sound asleep. Steve smiled fondly at him and craned his neck to look out the window. It was fairly overcast, though he was sure the clouds would roll away completely by the time the sun came up. It never rained in Westview, after all.
“I love you too.”
“I can’t do anything about the heat, Tony, unless we decide to take the jet out to one of the other houses.” He can feel Tony perking up and immediately adds, “
—is fighting the god, and Tony can’t tell who’s winning, but he’s going to help. He scrambles for the watch around his wrist—secretly what he’s tentatively calling a gauntlet. It’s a pet project of his—he had this idea for an armored suit capable of flight, and it’s probably never going to even make it off the ground, but he’s been working on flight stabilizers. He’d brought the gauntlet with him to the gala so he could tinker with it while he was bored, but if he just… ups… the… power—
“What? Hold on.” He takes the phone away from his ear and waves down Luis, who’s doing some paperwork at the dining table. “Hey, can you take over dinner? This is important.”
“Who?” Steve asks but he knows who Clint is talking about.
“Yeah, he stopped by,” Steve says. His phone buzzes in his pocket but he ignores it. “How did you hear about that?”
“I love you,” he said, unable to keep the sentiment hidden.
“I just thought you needed it,” Steve murmurs into his shoulder.
Tony checks his watch. “Yeah, I think it’s happening right around now. Come on.” He leads Steve over to the couches where he turns on the TV and flips through the channels until he lands on one of the news stations. Steve immediately sees what Tony is talking about: the screen is taken up with Ross’ furious face, spitting abuses at anyone who’ll listen as he’s shoved into a police car. He can’t immediately read what the banner at the bottom says, as it’s in another language, but Tony does something with his phone and the language changes to English. Ross, it appears, has finally been arrested for his inhumane treatment of the Avengers and the crimes he committed by trying to institute the Sentinels program.
Tony grins at him. “Yeah, that sounds nice.”
“How confusing is it if I say the motel? Actually, never mind, I refuse to claim a motel as my place of residence. Can we skip that one too and come back to it?”
She doesn’t really know what she expected out of Howard. Her husband isn’t one to admit when he doesn’t know something. He’s far more likely to avoid it until the situation resolves itself—or pass it off to Obadiah. But a baby isn’t something that can be passed off to his godfather, however much she might like to when Tony keeps her up most of yet another night.
“Better not let Tony hear that,” Steve replies, laughing as well. He’s heard plenty of stories from the king about his sister’s thirst for improvement. He just hadn’t realized it would spill over to them and not just her brother and country’s equipment.
It’s a good thing Tony turns and leaves then, because Steve turns a bright red.
As if to emphasize what he’s saying, U makes a sad, drawn-out beep. It sounds almost strained, and Tony’s face falls as he pats his injured bot.
“Steve, right?” the boy—Tony? No, this can’t possibly be Tony—asks.
She’d levelled that look on him, the one all moms are famous for. “I mean it. That boy looks like he needs to be handled with care but not enough people have. And you, my darling boy, it’s gonna be rough for you, but it’ll go easier with a friend.”
“You gonna hurry up and get on with it, stud?” Tony asks, smiling up at him.
“With a bucket of ice? Don’t you think that’s missing something?”
Steve gets to his feet, leaving Tony on the couch, and walks to the door, feet dragging like lead. He doesn’t want to leave Tony there. He wants to go back to him, ignore whoever is at the door, and work this out, keep Tony there until he can convince him that no matter what had happened to them this last week, what Steve feels for him is very real. Sometimes, in all this mess of aliens and magic and flying robots, he thinks that what he feels for Tony is the realist thing in the entire world.
She smiles at him, a little sad, a little bittersweet. “Maybe to you it isn’t,” she says quietly. Shifters have soulmates, he remembers. What must that be like, he wonders, to know that somewhere out there is the perfect person for you but you can’t leave this town to find them? “I like this for you, Steve. Both of you. I think you just need a little push.”
“Oh!” Steve suddenly yells, startling him.
Steve, though, he stays awake for a long time, wishing it could be like this all the time.
Steve looks to T’Challa for assistance, but the king is frowning thoughtfully. He looks back at Tony and quietly says, “Tony—”
“It is sweet. Thank you, Steve,” Tony agrees. He smiles softly, running his finger around the edges of the frame, and Steve suddenly
He sounds odd, almost muffled, and Steve peeks one eye open to see Tony scooping Steve’s come up on his fingers and sucking them off. He groans, spent cock twitching against Tony’s thigh.
knew that it would be so easy to let himself fall for Tony again if he started staying the night and waking up wrapped in Tony’s arms. It wasn’t anything that Tony did.
“Did you?” Tony asks faintly.
“No one’s going to want to drive all the way to the suburbs just to drive you back into the city. You’ll be waiting all night,” Tony huffed, crossing his arms. Steve looked away. “I get it. You don’t want to share a bed with me, but at least sleep on the couch. Or I can sleep on the couch and you can take the bed. Just don’t leave.”
On one of his circuits, Steve screeched to a halt at the window, distracted by something going on across the street. “Huh,” he commented, tilting his head to the side in an attempt to get a better view.
“Got it.”
“I’ll bet he never told you about the time Steve walked straight into a hunter’s net and Bucky had to rescue him,” she says, landing on one of her personal favorites.
“Why doesn’t he like me?” Tony asks eventually.
“Mama,” he’d protested, sixteen and believing himself to be completely independent and hating that his mom was telling who to be friends with.
brat though.”
Steve: So your girlfriend is now your ex-girlfriend all because you messed up that grand gesture.
Steve had let the issue drop after that, not wanting to offend Vision any further (and anyway, it wasn’t right to deny Wanda what happiness she could find after Sokovia), but he’d still thought to himself,
Steve
He groans as he leans back in his chair and stretches, his back popping as he straightens up from the crouch Luis’s chair puts him in. He now has twenty-five voicemails from Tony and for all that he actually kind of likes Tony (in spite of his disorganization), he is not looking forward to them. Honestly, he’d like to just take the rest of the day off, head upstairs to his room, and read whatever’s left on Luis’s bookshelf that he hasn’t already read, but he knows he needs to deal with this first and he’s got too much responsibility to put it off. He presses play on the first message.
Tony opens up the duffel bag, revealing a jumble of lace and satin of all colors, haphazardly shoved inside. Steve grins. He’s only known Tony for a few minutes, but this seems very in character for him.
this afternoon and I thought meatloaf might be nice.”
Tony shifts.
He pulls away after another moment, grabs the bowl of ice off the nightstand, and shifts onto his side. The ice has started to melt, but there’s still more than enough for what Steve wants to do. He looks down at Tony, who’s gazing up at him with a soft, trusting expression, shiny lips slightly parted as he breathes. His irises are merely thin rings around his blown pupils. He looks halfway to wrecked already, and the sight makes Steve moan.
He was just giving me a ride since we ran late and I didn’t want to have to take the subway.”
“I was wrong. I should have. I let my emotions about Bucky cloud my judgment. I should have told you right from the start that I was worried about an army of supersoldiers instead of letting you think I would fight my own teammates over the Accords.”
“You’re damn right I stopped it,” Tony says. “I—hopefully you can understand that I don’t want anyone else to know where the Sentinels are, but no one can get to them.”
“We could do that later this afternoon.”
“She said you give each other sparkly rocks.”
“You’re so mean to me,” Tony pouted. Steve laughed and danced him into the kitchen over the theme music of the show playing on the television.
Tony: Yeah, it’s possible that they’re being controlling, and if they are, then tell them to go to hell, but I just have a question or two before we send you on your merry way. You said you told them after they brought up the date that you couldn’t, but have you told them when you made the plans with your friends that you would be busy that night?
“You know, this was nice,” Tony says sleepily, which is likely the only reason he says it. An awake Tony would never admit to this. “We should do this more often.”
“Okay, so what are the not-a-dreamcatcher horses?” Natasha asks a while later. “You never finished explaining.”
fix our A/C when it mysteriously goes out every summer?”
“Yes please,” Tony whispers.
“Clearly you’re putting it to good use.” Tony’s smile fades after a moment. “Just so you know, if we don’t get the grant money—”
He didn’t want that. He loved
Morgan is acting up tonight. No matter what they’ve tried—and he and Steve had tried a
“What’s going on?” Steve asks Natasha, whose eyes are glued to the screen.
Despite himself, Steve feels a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth at Tony’s unique brand of irreverent humor. “I’d come in,” he says, “if you would move out of the doorway.”
“Captain Rogers,” T’Challa greets him. “Would you walk with me?”
, like he belongs there, even though they’re oversized and practically hanging off of his smaller frame.
“Just the ropes we talked about over the phone, right?” the boy asks.
that’s a bad idea, and then there’s a blast coming from the gauntlet. He ducks immediately after firing; if he misses, he doesn’t want the angry god to know who was trying to hit him. Fuck but he hopes he doesn’t hit Captain America. That’d be embarrassing—“Hi, I think I’m your soulmate, sorry about hitting you with an untested flight stabilizer.”
Stunned, Steve stares at him for a long time, not sure what to focus on first. That Thor is returning to Earth? The destruction of Asgard? That apparently Bruce has been out in space this entire time, which explains why he and Nat couldn’t find him here?
“Yes, actually, in thirty-seven countries, which you would know if you’d let Mom send you to that school instead of hitchhiking to—”
Steve is the one to arrange their next meeting a month later. Clint and Scott have been talking about wanting to return home and join their families again. He doesn’t blame them. He would love to go home as well, back to the Compound, back to
“I’ve never heard that story,” Maria says quietly as Ana moves away from the crib.
She smirks at him. “Yes, Tony and I had sex a few times right after he first moved to town. What’s the big deal? Seems like you and Tony want to have—”
Howard smiles at him, but it’s a sad smile. He’s more than familiar with sad smiles: his mom and Aunt Peggy and Uncle Grant all give him the same one. “I’m sure we will, kiddo,” Howard tells him, reaching down to ruffle his hair.
Steve has heard him talk enough about Howard to know that Tony thinks his father
“No,” Steve agrees. Tony’s way too sarcastic for that. “But you
Grocery shopping with Tony was always an ordeal, not because he made it miserable, but because he always forgot to eat beforehand and he wanted
“It’s just a software update,” he says again. “It’s not even like I’m going to get rid of your personality, troublesome as it is. I’m just going to reconfigure your sensors so you stop running into Rhodey’s bed cause he threatened to throw you out if you tripped over him in the middle of the night again.” He chuckles as he remembers the expression on Rhodey’s face the last time he was woken up in the middle of the night by a four-hundred pound robot falling on top of him. “And don’t worry, it’s only for a few months before Mom talks Howard into moving me and Rhodey out of the dorms. You’ll have plenty of space then.”
as well. Tony is reminded of the problem of Theseus’ ship. Is it still U if he has to replace everything about it?
Tony hums. “Well,
Tony glares at him as he backs off that edge, complaining, “Rude.”
“It wasn’t his fault,” Steve says sharply. Maybe, if he keeps saying the words, he’ll even start to believe it, because right now, it can be so hard to believe that with Bucky in cryo again and those mission reports sitting right in front of him with pictures of a monster wearing his best friend’s face. He wonders if Tony has realized yet that he wasn’t the only person who’d lost people to the Winter Soldier that night. Steve and Bucky both had lost a close friend.
Tony immediately tenses, making Rhodey regret asking. “Is it enough if I tell you I’m never going to see him again?” he asks, sounding defeated. Rhodey hates that. Tony should never sound anything other than triumphant.
“Their kind?”
Tony starts to drag one of the blankets over them and almost immediately decides it’s not worth it.
Once, Steve thought he might have ignored a tug like that, but now, he followed it, wondering what he was thinking of. It felt—it felt like there was something locked behind a wall, like he could unlock so much if only he could get past that barrier. But something was blocking him—something insidious and terrifying and a bright scarlet red the color of blood.
Steve’s jaw drops. “
“No, seriously, what the
He curls up on a large, sun-drenched rock just outside of the human village and stares unblinking at where Steve is talking with the humans’ leader. The urge to take a nap and soak up the sun is almost overwhelmingly tempting, but he fights the impulse. He sees Steve so rarely these days; it’s more important that he watches him now instead of taking a nap.
“I… okay.” He waited a moment more but Steve seemed like he was done worrying about the glass. Tony headed for the pantry where they kept the broom, looking back over his shoulder to make sure Steve didn’t forget about the glass again and step in it.
he wants, just that he’s still thinking about Tony alone in that compound, in that situation that Steve has put him in, and his heart hurts.
It has the intended effect. Tony lets out a wet little laugh and hugs Steve tighter for a brief moment before letting go. They go back to setting up products, Steve holding the box as Tony grabs things out of it to put on the shelves.
“We do, but not like what you gave me.”
buttoning his shirt—but the thought dissipated as soon as Steve smiled at him. He loved Steve’s smile. It was always so bright in an otherwise grey world.
He’s missed his brother, hadn’t really realized how much until Bucky’s clutching him as tight as he’s doing to Bucky. Bucky smells nice, like some kind of lemongrass soap. It suits him.
He hangs up before he can hear any more of Uncle Grant’s protests.
“I can’t sleep anyway,” Steve says. It’s only partially a lie. Now that he has that text from Tony, he’s wide awake but before, he’d been dead on his feet.
To his surprise, Tony frowned, his brow creasing thoughtfully. “Strangely,” he said eventually. “I had the oddest dreams.”
“Go to sleep, Tony,” Steve sighs.
He gives Steve a filthy wink, making Steve grin. He can always count on Tony to lighten the mood. “Down, boy,” he says teasingly. “Nothing like that. I just wanted to give you my list of amendments.”
“No, this is on me,” Steve says before Tony can say anything else. “I shouldn’t have snapped.”
“Sure,” Tony agreed. “But it wouldn’t be the first time something has gotten cancelled despite being popular.”
For a decade, he built up his reputation as a talk show host, moving onto bigger and better shows every few years. He was happy, or at least he wasn’t
. And when Tony Stark pitched a fit, people
And that—that’s something to think about.
He sighs. “I’m being careful,” he says. “I’m not going to risk our team.”
asked him to bring.
“Like your unilateral decision to get married?” Tony retorted.
Tony calls him at an absurdly early hour (for Tony, Steve has been up for almost thirty minutes by this point). Steve pauses in the middle of stirring the eggs and looks balefully at where his phone is blaring “Livin’ On A Prayer” halfway across the room. He could just let it go to voicemail but that’s Tony’s ringtone—chosen by Tony himself—and if Tony is calling him this early in the morning, then that means something is up.
He slid down the railing until he was sitting on the stairs, listening grumpily as Steve apologized to the girl for taking longer than usual to turn on their porch light and gave her two candy bars to thank her for her patience. It was taking too long, he decided. If Steve
Steve, whose two best friends had hated each other until Tony had set them up and now they were married, shrugged and said, “He’s okay.”
Tony laughed. “Fuck, can you imagine? We do all that planning, find new backers, and take our findings to Pierce, only to find out that he cancelled
“Can he feel pain?” Steve suddenly asks, startling Tony out of his musings.
“Tony,” he said urgently. “Tony, we have to help.”
“You’re not rich anymore,” the redhead points out.
Steve steps aside. “Open the doors.”
To his delight, while Tony’s eyes narrow, there’s a smile lurking at the corners of his mouth. “You’re very snippy, you know that?”
if any of his expensive panties were ruined.
“Steve?” Tony asks, clearly confused by him leaving.
“Nonsense,” Tony dismisses. “You got it for me, I’m sure I’ll love it.”
So he’s surprised (and maybe a little disappointed) when he asks JARVIS where Tony is and the AI says that he’s in their room.
Tony couldn’t stop staring at the boys as they passed by, a deep frown creasing his face. Wanda started to wave at them, only to stop when she saw the look on Tony’s face. Her hand hesitantly lowered as she looked warily back at them. Steve elbowed Tony’s side.
And Steve could argue that point all day long—who would look at what Tony’s doing for Schitt’s Creek and not think that?—but that isn’t what Tony needs right now. He needs a hug and, you know what, that’s exactly what Steve’s going to give him.
“You’re not.” It’s not a question.
It’s unusual, he knows, that he’s had his name his entire life. Most people don’t meet their soulmates and get their names until they’re older and a little more worldly. There are, of course, the people who were childhood sweethearts, gaining their matching names in preschool. And there’s the opposite end of the spectrum too: people who don’t meet their soulmates until they’re well into their old age. Tony’s only heard of a handful of other people who met their soulmates in their infancy. Most of them were lucky enough that their soulmate didn’t just disappear after meeting them. They’re not having to trawl through the U.S. Census data, trying to figure out which Steve Rogers would’ve been at a small army hospital in New Jersey in 1970.
“Do you—” he begins.
“Oh so it’s a high school class?” he asks, eagerly wanting to know more. That’s strange, he knows there’s something he came here to do, but all he can think about is finding out more about Janet’s life. She just makes it sound so
Another five minutes and then Tony says, “You won’t get to see me walking around in just my lingerie if we wait five years.”
Tony grumbled wordlessly, but he slowly let go of his octopus grip on Steve. He trailed Steve into the bathroom, standing at the other sink to brush his own teeth. As soon as they were done, he was back in Steve’s arms, kissing him languidly with long, slow swipes of his tongue inside Steve’s mouth. Steve held him close, carefully walking them both back toward the bed.
He doesn’t see Tony again for another couple of days, when he heads to the café for dinner. The entire Stark family is sitting in one of the booths, puzzling over their menus. He can hear Mr. Stark complaining about the inability of the café to streamline the menus, a sentiment that Steve privately shares but he’d never say it here where Carol could hear him. He knows she works hard on those.
They’d barely set the chairs when Dottie was bustling over with a snapped, “No, no,
He needed a minute to remember who Geraldine was. He and Steve really were pretty antisocial, weren’t they, if he couldn’t remember the names of their neighbors. “That’s Wanda’s friend, isn’t it?” he said eventually. Steve nodded. “Sure I do, she lives—” He stopped. Where
“Not the time, Reindeer Games,” he snaps.
The door opens, just a crack, and Tony’s small face peeks around the corner. He looks worried and perhaps a little scared, and Peggy’s heart breaks a little. No child should ever look like this.
Steve almost refuses, but if Tony is really that worried about the conversation, maybe it’s better that he have something to hold on to. “Yeah, that’d be great,” he says, and works on clearing the dishes while Tony waits for the coffee to brew. He washes them, setting them aside on the drying rack, figuring it’s probably easier than bothering with the dishwasher for only a few plates.
After a moment, Tony’s voice floats in from the back room, “Steve?” Steve frowns. What is Tony doing in the back room? They’d cleared it out yesterday; there shouldn’t be any reason for Tony to be back there.
Tony: Yeah, we hear a lot of relationship woes on this show.
“Point taken, I should have talked about it with her, but in my defense, I
“Nice to meet you, Mr. Stark. I’m Vision Maximoff. My wife and I just moved to town a few days ago.” The man seemed eager to please and Tony realized he was smiling reassuringly. There was just something about Vision that made him want
Steve breathes, “Wow,” and lets himself be amazed as Tony tells him stories about the stars.
Still makes him uncomfortable though.
“Hmm,
He spends another few hours at Tony’s hotel, watching badly dubbed movies with him until Tony’s yawns almost come faster than he can finish the previous one. “Okay, sleep,” Steve says, carefully climbing out from under Tony’s arm. “Come on. You look exhausted.”
Steve opened his mouth to say something, but movement outside caught his eye. When he turned, the boys were gone, Wanda and Agnes gone too. “What the…” he murmured. He darted back to the window, peering to either side, thinking that maybe they’d gone further down the street, but he couldn’t see them anywhere. There was, however, a car smoking and upside-down in the ruins where the front wall of Wanda’s house used to be.
“I’m not decommissioning you,” he says to his distraught bot. “It’s just a software update while we wait for your new strut to finish fabricating. You don’t have to worry that I’m never going to turn you back on again.” He watches as DUM-E spins around in a circle and promptly runs into Rhodey’s bed, toppling over due to the unbalanced weight of his struts. “Even if it would make my life easier.”
Steve, having no idea what Captain Crunch is supposed to be a reference to, makes a mental note to ask Tony about it once they’re done here. For now, though, he uses all of his strength and slowly—so
Steve stares dubiously at the sparkly tickets for Rogers: The Musical in his hands—he hadn’t even known they
Tony’s frown only deepens, but there’s a hopeful light in his eyes that tells her how badly he wants a Cap Bear. “Howard says Cap Bears are only for boys who behave.”
Steve stares at him for a moment before saying, “Sure.” He looks down at the currently empty form and back up at Tony. “Battin’ a thousand here, Tony,” he teases.
He finishes up getting ready and grabs his bag, giving Luis a friendly wave as he heads out the door. Luis’s place is only a few blocks away from the apothecary so he walks. No point in driving when his car’s so old even Clint can’t do anything to fix it. Not for the first time, he wishes he’d brought his motorcycle with him, but he’d gotten out of New York in such a hurry, he’d barely stopped to grab his bags, let alone the motorcycle he’d known wouldn’t have fit all of his things.
Rhodey, glancing over his shoulder, chuckles. “That’s Tony. You’ll probably want to pick up before you give him a panic attack or something. That boy is way too high-strung for his own good.”
It didn’t sound as odd as the flashes Steve remembered from his own dreams, though Tony remembering his dreams at all was certainly strange. They hadn’t been arguing last night, so it couldn’t have been a holdover from whatever they might have gone to bed angry about. No, it just sounded like a run-of-the-mill nightmare, but he doubted Tony wanted to hear his husband invalidate his nightmares. He brushed Tony’s hair back from his forehead and kissed him there.
Tony was bad news.
He thinks about threatening to return to his salamander form and staying that way for the rest of eternity if that’s what it would take to make them stop complaining about clothes. But he remembers the years he’d spent trapped as a salamander after Arendelle’s betrayal, how he’d never been able to calm down enough to stop setting fire to everything in sight, how scared he’d been all that time, and he thinks that this is better. Even if humans
“Yeah, I’m actually undecided right now?” Tony says, voicing lilting up at the end into a question.
“But remember that no matter what you decide, it can’t be a unilateral decision. You can’t make this decision for your partner, just like they can’t make it for you. Fairytale love is just that: a fairytale. True love takes dedication and communication and a lot of work.”
He hears a low whinny and wriggles with delight. A whinny means that that ridiculous water horse is back, which isn’t great, since honestly, Tony would be perfectly happy if that horse would never return to the Forest. But, it also means, more importantly, that Steve is back from his weekly visit to Arendelle. Tony’s smaller salamander form isn’t very fast, but he’s still only a few steps behind Natasha to greet Steve as he pulls up in front of the human camp.
“Because—” Tony takes a deep breath and plunges ahead. “I think you’re my soulmate.”
“I like the name,” he says instead. “Stark Apothecary, it’s got a nice ring to it.”
“Goodnight, Tony,” he says as Tony gets out of the car.
Maria glares at him. “Don’t let Tony hear you say that,” she snaps. “He’s worked hard. He deserves this success without worrying that you’re just here because of what happened with Stark Resilient.”
again. Suddenly, Steve finds the future looking very bright indeed.
Dummy was proving herself to be quite the little lap cat, currently curled up in Tony’s lap and purring like mad. Dodger, on the other hand, was far more active. He was leading Steve on a merry chase around their house, barking away. They’d definitely have to work on obedience training with him if they didn’t want to get complaints about the noise levels (although if Agnes was the one who complained, Steve would tell her she didn’t have room to complain, considering the sheer amount of noise that emanated from her house during the night—really, who needed to watch horror movies at two in the morning?).
He means it to just be helpful but even he knows that it’s clearly the wrong thing to say because Tony is only looking angrier and Janet is agreeing with him as she says, “The textbooks are actually saying eighteen months.”
Tony: Huh. And here I thought we were on the same page for once. What was your question then?
Steve takes a moment to breathe in the sight of him in the romper he’d chosen to surprise Steve with on his birthday. Briefly, he wonders what Tony had had planned for that night, though he can’t regret how this has all turned out. Or, well, he can regret the power blackout, but not how beautiful Tony looks, gleaming with sweat and looking like a damn picture.
Steve reaches out to grab it, glancing over at the four different names Tony has given his business and crossed out. It’s just the beginning of a series of cross-outs and additions all over the page. He tosses it down on his desk and grabs for the folder he’d started working on as soon as he listened to Tony’s first couple of messages.
“Sweetheart,” Steve said in that longsuffering tone that meant he was asking himself why he’d ever married Tony. “Can you stop?”
“You’d just pack it up and take it with you.”
“My friends,” Thor says in a low tone once Tony has disappeared behind the curtain, “is everything alright with the store?”
“Thank you,” Tony says softly, smiling at him in that way that makes Steve’s breath catch. “But Natasha already offered her place.”
Tony pouted. “So rude. I’m great at setting people up. Steve, tell her how good I am at setting people up.”
He recognized that name—Focus on the Family. Not just because of their prevalence in media and their conservative views, but because they paid for ad space on the station—a lot of it. Sometimes, it felt like every other ad was for Focus on the Family, whether that was their website, their podcast, or any of the other “services” they offered. He knew that the organization had always had a problem with
“Steve!” he heard Bucky call.
He pulls away, tucking his head against the curve of Tony’s neck. “Thank you,” he breathes. He doesn’t know how Tony always knows when Steve is feeling self-conscious about his body, but he somehow does and he always comes up with something that’ll help.
The coffee is done by the time he sets the last fork in the rack. Tony passes him a mug as he murmurs, “One cream, five sugars.” It’s the way Steve has always taken his coffee and he’s a little surprised at first that Tony remembered, but then again, Tony has always taken care of them, keeping Natasha’s favorite fruit—blackberries—in the fridge all the time, making sure that there was always something sweet in the pantry for Thor. It really shouldn’t be that surprising that Tony remembered Steve’s coffee order.
“Tony Stark,” Steve says, not sure if he’s reassuring Tony that he knows who he is or if he’s just trying out the name. Either way, he likes it. “You bought the old apothecary.”
“Well, I won’t tell you not to see him,” she says. “Will you tell him… tell him I said hi?”
She gets up and heads inside before the full impact of her statement hits him. But as soon as it does, he shouts after her, “Wait! You guys had
“Come on, buddy, I’ll even tell you a bedtime story while I work on your coding, huh? How does that sound?”
“Hey, you know, it’s not like I knew what the store was going to look like,” he protests good-naturedly. “I’ll have you know I have an art degree, as well as the MBA.”
“Yes I do.”
Rhodey can’t remember. “How does Ana and Edwin sound?”
That sounds fake, but okay. “What am I supposed to look out for then? Kicking, talking in your sleep, demons randomly appearing at the foot of the bed?” It sounds ridiculous but Bucky’s college roommate was a crossroads demon who would sometimes summon their hellhound in the middle of the night.
“Tony, you saw me this morning,” Steve says amusedly.
Tony hesitates. “Don’t call me,” he says eventually. “I don’t know how long I’ll be there and if he sees you calling me, he’ll know something’s up.” So that answers the question about which method Tony’s going to use to get the USB.
After another ten minutes, Steve hesitantly says, “I know you don’t want to talk about it right now, but if you ever change your mind, I’m here to listen.”
That was another thing that puzzled Steve about the small modicum of fame. He didn’t really judge anyone for shipping him and Tony together—he figured it was no different than hoping two friends would get together—but shipping in general was a little odd to him. He didn’t understand the appeal of picking over every little interaction he and Tony had in the hopes of proving that they were secretly dating—which they weren’t—or that they were secretly fucking—which they were.
“What can I say? I’ve got a thing for blonds, I suppose.” Tony sauntered past him, slapping his ass as he passed. “Come down when you get changed. I’ll make some popcorn.”
“What happened in Siberia?”
“Ah, that’s because it’s not,” Tony says, smiling slyly. “I’m here for plausible deniability.”
But Steve wasn’t supposed to care. If Tony wanted to keep whatever had made him late a secret, then it wasn’t Steve’s job to worry about it.
“Uh—sure,” Tony says slowly, blinking at him.
Howard doesn’t quite know what to do with babies. To be fair, Maria thinks, as she hurries down the hallway to the nursery, she doesn’t really know what to do with babies either. They’re both so much older than Tony is, having waited until Stark Industries is established and thriving before deciding to have children, and having been only children in small families, well, they’re just not as familiar with babies. The difference, she decides as she nears Tony’s nursery, her infant son’s screams getting louder as he gets closer, is that she, unlike her husband, has decided that she will
“No, you’re not,” he agrees, sliding one hand down Tony’s chest and past the end of the buttons to wrap around Tony’s sizeable cock. It’s hard enough to pound nails and dripping pre-come, belying Tony’s complaints. He strokes it twice, spreading pre-come down the sides. For a brief moment, he thinks about opening himself up and getting that thick cock inside him as Tony writhes from the ice. But that would mean having to take that romper off and Steve loves the sight of it too much to do that.
Tony flushes, a pleased smile curving his lips up as he squirms. “I take it you like the romper then?”
“Not little.”
“So, what did you think?” Steve asked as they collapsed on the couch that evening.
Tony shakes his head. “You were always the only person I’d ever trust with that list. You still are.”
They take care of each other. Rhodey knows what people think, knows that everyone thinks he gives and gives and gives to Tony Stark and Tony takes nothing in return. But they’re wrong. Sure, he’s there to make sure Tony doesn’t get too drunk at a party or that one of the many fame-chasers doesn’t take advantage of his youth and innocence; he’s not going to deny that he plays his part in taking care of Tony. But it’s Tony who quizzes him for hours the night before an exam, Tony who wakes him up on Saturdays  with coffee and a muffin from the coffeeshop down the street, Tony who has Mama Rhodes’ phone number memorized so he can call her when Rhodey has a bad day. They take care of each other, and
. When Pierce had floated the idea to him, he’d made it sound like Mr. Right Now was supposed to be a player always looking for a new conquest, but Steve had been able to turn him into more of a live in the moment kind of character, the kind of guy who told high school girls not to follow their boyfriends to their college and go their own direction instead.
“Uh, she said something came up at the motel,” Tony says. He looks distracted and a little nervous. Steve can’t help but wonder what Natasha said to him. Did she tell Tony about his feelings? She wouldn’t do that, would she? She has to know that’s something he wanted to confess on his own… Right?
He bit back an automatic retort—he might have been a host instead of production staff, but that didn’t mean he sat around doing nothing all day—but stopped himself at the last second. Rumlow would just grunt at him like he always did and then go report to Pierce that Steve was picking fights again. And he didn’t need another writeup. Pierce already thought of him as a troublemaker. He’d been suspended twice in the last year alone for punching Rollins for harassing some of the interns. Any more trouble and he was running a real risk of losing his job.
Tony moved.
Rumlow strode into the conference room, acting, as he always did, like he owned the place. “—Focus on the Family is threatening to remove their financial support if they’re not cancelled,” he was telling Rollins. Steve looked down at the table to hide his frown. It sounded like Rumlow was still talking about
Steve isn’t very good at this. He knows that. It’s a minor miracle he’s ever gotten
“Quite right,” she agrees, smiling a little. “But he can live with me, can’t he? So then you’ll always have one for when you come to visit me.” She pauses, looking at the unconvinced expression on Tony’s face. “Or perhaps we can get you a Cap Bear instead?”
“Steve?” he called into the dark room. It must have still been early. He was rarely up at that hour, but he knew his husband was. Steve rose with the dawn most days, eager and willing to face the day with a brisk run through the neighborhood. If he’d managed to time it correctly, Steve would still be in the kitchen with a cup of coffee and would hear him shouting for him.
haven’t talked through what happened last time? Steve, that’s no foundation for a relationship. Someone’s going to get hurt.”
“Where did you come from?” he asks.
He means for it to be a nice gesture but Tony’s frown just deepens. “I do know what I want to do though.”
about what modelling for an Erotica in Art portfolio should be like, and those ideas don’t include a skinny asthmatic artist. So. He’s got nothing for his project, it’s due in less than a week, and Steve is desperate.
Steve: Nonsense. Shut up and listen. So for our hypothetical example, maybe it’s your anniversary and you want to do something extra special so you decide to get her strawberries dipped in the most expensive chocolate in the world and also a giant bunny, because nothing says “romance” like a giant bunny, apparently—
“I can’t believe it,” Howard says. “He managed to create something like
He just doesn’t know if he’d be welcome.
Tony’s eyes turn dark and heated. He slinks closer to Steve, runs his fingers up Steve’s chest, and purrs, “Or I’ll shut it for you.”
“As for Clint, his trial finished yesterday. He’s being fined a small amount for the repairs for the Compound and he’s confined to house arrest at his farm for two years and isn’t supposed to pick up his bow for three years, though how the UN thinks they’re going to enforce that is beyond me. I mean, really, I’d love to see them go to Clint’s house to try to tell him he can’t shoot for three years. They’d all come back with suction cup arrows plastered to their foreheads.”
Tony groaned, “I don’t know, but I don’t know what else to think. You know Rumlow and Pierce are close. Could Pierce have told him the show was getting cancelled but to keep it quiet and Rumlow just ignored him?”
“You’ve been hanging around with Dottie too much,” he muttered to himself, the sound barely audible above the rushing water. “You’re becoming a—”
Tony drums his fingers on the glowing thing under his shirt (and no, Luis, it does
Maria chuckles. “My mother used to sing to me, so I thought I’d do that with Tony. Clearly, he prefers your stories.”
He holds out the lingerie he’s selected, saying, “There’s a bathroom down the hall where you can change. Since this is supposed to be a final project an’ I’m running behind cause I couldn’t find a model, we’ll be trying a couple different outfits and a few locations today, if that’s okay?”
Steve doesn’t really know how he feels about that. It’s just—it’s so—it’s
“Luis!” he calls, hoping that Luis is here and can pass him the phone so he doesn’t have to leave the eggs. No luck. The house is silent.
about how he’d been gone for so long. He can understand that. Since she was born five years ago, Tony’s tried to limit his business trips to only a couple of days at max. But then they’d had a factory manager who was stealing wages, and Tony had had to fly out to India to deal with that, plus the rehiring of the new manager and trying to figure out compensation for his employees…
stopped, he supposed there was nothing left to do except wait for Steve to come back with the now-unnecessary buckets and for the phone to dry off enough so he could call the insurance company—not that they would be open on a Saturday, but he could at least leave a message.
Oh shit, he’s panicking, and he needs to not be panicking. There’s only room for one panicking person in this maybe-relationship and that person is almost always Tony. So he needs to calm down.
“I did so much damage trying to prepare for him coming,” Tony says, and Steve isn’t sure that he even heard him. “I made
Steve laughs and continues, “But one day, she met a knight who was kind of a dick—”
“My—my desk? Mr. Stark, I still don’t know what—”
He smiles tightly. “Just a sandwich, thanks.” He doesn’t think anything hot will actually travel well, even if all Luis has to do is walk across the street, and the only other cold food the café serves is salad with limp lettuce so he’ll pass on that.
“Steve, no, the lights are turned off, look at me, I’m dying here,” he said desperately, hanging onto Steve’s arm.
“There’s more,” Tony says grimly. “Thor was concerned about Infinity Stones, right? Turns out he’s not the only one who’s looking for them. He calls this guy the Mad Titan, also known as Thanos. He’s trying to collect all of the Infinity Stones so he can wipe out half of all life. And it doesn’t get any better from there, because he apparently started with one Infinity Stone only to lose it almost five years ago.”
He owes Tony an explanation, he decides. Tony deserves to know why he refused to sign, deserves a full and complete explanation that’s more than just an “I don’t want to” and Steve walking out. They were supposed to be a team, they should have made this decision together, but he’d let Ross rip through them like paper and never even told Tony why he’d let him.
“Hello, Tony!” Steve called from the kitchen.
Steve scuffs his toe along the ground, leaving a furrow in the snow. Eventually, he says, “Humans don’t court the way you do.”
Something flashed red in the corner of his vision. He twisted to look at it, but it was gone by the time he fully turned. It was weird, though—looked like some kind of smoke, though he’d never heard of smoke colored red except in a magic show maybe.
“Oh please, like you didn’t see this coming when I’ve been trying to get you to go out with me for all three years.”
Tony shoots him a cheeky grin. “Since when have I ever done what you want?”
There are an untold number of Steve Rogerses currently alive in Europe, and none of that matters because not once, in
“You wouldn’t have done it.”
Also historically not true.
There are an untold number of Steve Rogerses currently alive in Europe (Tony doesn’t know how many exactly because Pepper pitched a fit when she found out he was trying to hack the census data from various European countries). So he’s doing it the slow way instead: still hacking the census date, but using library computers to do it instead.
“Dr. Stark, what about War Machine? Will Colonel Rhodes be returning to the team?”
“Her sons were babies yesterday, Steve.”
what’s so bad about sleeping with you?”
He sighed. Or that.
“Technically,” Tony fired back, “
Tony nods. “After… everything, they added an amendment about what to do if the Accords are violated. Clint and Lang will have to stand trial for what they did at the airport—you all will, actually, if you want to come back—and they still have to either sign or go into retirement but yeah, if they want to go home, they can.”
“Pretty sure?” Steve asks. He hands Tony one of the drinks. “One caramel macchiato with two pumps of vanilla and cinnamon on top for you.”
And Vision, in that odd way of speaking that he had, had said slowly, “No, I don’t but I think it might help.” He’d hesitated for a moment. “I… am not JARVIS. Perhaps it would be best to think of it in terms of a parent and child. JARVIS was my parent, but I am not him, even though we share the same voice. I do not think Mr. Stark would ever be able to forget that, no matter how much he tried.”
He carries the tray into their room where Tony is huddled under a mound of blankets. It looks like he’s swiped every blanket from their floor and possibly a couple from Nat’s floor for his pile. Steve can’t help but smile fondly as he sets the tray down on the bedside table.
Steve’s hands froze in pushing up Tony’s shirt, warm against Tony’s back. Tony didn’t often cede control. He liked to take charge in the bedroom, liked to tell Steve where to put his hands and his mouth and his cock, and it wasn’t that Steve minded that! For as much as Tony liked to be the one telling Steve what to do, Steve liked to be the one told what to do, and he didn’t get that nearly as often as he would have liked from his other partners, who frequently assumed that because he was bigger, he wanted to be the one in charge. This was just new, was all, and when Tony had pressed him against the door as soon as it closed behind them, he’d assumed tonight would be like every other night.
“I’m not going to call it a crush, that sounds like we’re in middle school.” He could only think of two other alternatives, and one of those was an uncomfortable L-word that Steve didn’t know if he could bear hearing from Tony, so he quickly said, “Are you sure you’re really comfortable with continuing this, knowing that I’m not going to return those?”
Bucky is the one who buys them the tickets, hands them over to Steve, and calls them an early Christmas present.
“For what happened in Siberia.”
“You aren’t exactly subtle.”
“Don’t sound so surprised,” Tony says. He stands and carefully picks his way across the crowd to Captain America. “I have a lot of tricks up my sleeve—literally, this time.”
“I know I will,” Tony says, because it’s true. He can do anything he puts his mind to. He could be a
If there was one thing that Steve hated about Pierce more than anything else, it was the way the man played to both sides. He’d donated to both the Republican and the Democrat nominees equally in the last presidential race, he had both liberal and conservative financial backers for the station, and he frequently hosted both socialists and alt-right members at his monthly parties. Steve couldn’t quite figure the man out and that bothered him. Sometimes he thought Pierce supported whichever cause, left or right, he thought was more likely to help him, but everyone had values. Steve just couldn’t figure out what Pierce’s were.
The boy’s smile wavers as the silence drags on. “You
“Can I… never mind.”
and now he’s obsessing over his business partner.
him be interested in her, just when he’s slowly starting to figure out why he and—why he’s never really been attracted to women, makes him uneasy.
“This is also a good time to stop and evaluate your relationship. Depending on how you get told about your partner’s new job, you might know right off the bat that this is a good time to call it quits and walk away. But you might not realize that until you talk about it. Maybe your relationship has grown stagnant, but you didn’t know how complacent you both had gotten until this threw a wrench into the mix.”
Still—“You don’t mean that.”
“A few,” Tony says slowly, watching Steve move around the kitchen. “We won’t have lights or air conditioning, but in about thirty minutes, we should have the fridge and some of the more delicate equipment in the labs back up and running. Steve, what are you doing?”
“Tony,” he whispers, not sure what he wants to say. Does he tell him all those feelings, those whispered love confessions, were real the entire time? Does he tell him he wants to try all over again.
“We could call them Somniatores,” he suggests.
“Great,” he says, relieved. “So there are these two people, and they’re married to each other.”
“Better do it before we leave the house,” Steve told him, gently patting his chest.
“…Yes?”
“Thanks,” Steve says slowly, “but I thought I asked for a sandwich?”
“Good,” Tony grumbled, but Steve could tell that his heart wasn’t in it.
“Steve, don’t,” Tony tried again, but he knew he’d already lost the battle. He hoped that kid was happy. Tony could be getting fucked right now, which sounded like a much better use of their time.
He smiles to himself, bends his head to better look at the documents in front of him, and signs.
“Hey,” Steve says, jogging up to Tony. How to play this off? Act like he doesn’t know why Natasha left? Try to play it suave? Do something else? “Where’d Natasha go?” Ah, so he’s going with the route that he and Natasha definitely didn’t talk about this being a date, no way, no how.
“Clint and Scott want to go home,” he begins, just as Tony asks, “How’s Bucky?”
“Great, so Ana and Edwin are married to each other. It’s Christmas Eve and they realize they haven’t bought presents for each other yet.”
“Maybe one of the neighbors had their television running too loud.”
“Not really,” he challenges. “Not if it means you can’t go home.”
of space travel, at least not realistic space travel, and now they’ve got colonies on galaxies as far away from their own, it makes his head spin. Humans have peace treaties with over two thousand alien civilizations. And mechanical body enhancements, meant to augment humans for travel and work and sometimes sheer entertainment, are as common as breathing. But Steve, with his serum-induced enhancements, is somehow still the odd one out.
Tony looks appraisingly at him for a moment, and Steve wishes he could know what’s going through the brunet’s mind. Steve meets his gaze steadily, trying to hide his nervousness. He’s not too much, right? Tony won’t think he’s too much and decide that a bed with lice is better than a bed with Steve? Natasha goes back to unpacking glass horses, apparently done with the whole conversation.
It’s probably a bad idea. It’s almost
“But it’s not accountability if the blame is just being passed along to someone else.”
Tony stills. Steve does too. He’s not sure why he said that. No, that’s not true. He knows exactly why he said that. He doesn’t want Tony to get lice and he knows how distressed Tony gets about bugs and he hadn’t been thinking about the consequences of having Tony in his bed. Oh
“It’s gonna be okay, sweetheart,” Steve whispered into Tony’s hair, pulling him tighter into his side.
“Yeah,” Tony said. “About that one—”
You’re on air, how can we help you with all your relationship woes?
“You know who else drinks black coffee?” Tony snips, pulling multicolored ribbons out of a box. Supposedly, they’re doused in a potion that’ll attract butterflies, but Steve was on that vendor trip and he doesn’t think he saw a single butterfly at the farm. “People without taste.”
“Look,” she says, voice softening. “You two seem to really get along well. Whether Tony wants to admit or not, you’re his friend, which is supposedly the best foundation for a relationship.”
He loves that boy, loves him as much as he would his own son. He and Ana helped raise him; he means as much to them as he does to Maria, and rather more than he does to Howard. There isn’t a thing in the world Jarvis wouldn’t do for him, even if means staying in this mansion longer than he’d like.
“Uh-huh.” Sam looks like he’s thinking about something for a minute, then he abruptly says, “You know, I was the one who told Tony where to find y’all in Siberia.”
To Steve’s confusion, Vision didn’t look relieved. “Thank you, but I believe I’ll bring it up to the watch anyway. Maybe one of them heard something.”
Tony’s face lit up with a brilliant expression. “I love you too.”
Steve’s smile. “I love you too.”
“Hey, Steve?” Tony calls from the kitchen as Steve steps through the door. They’re in an Italian villa this time, owned by Tony’s mother at one point and still maintained by a small group of groundspeople though Tony himself rarely visits. “I was thinking—”
“Anyway,” Janet says suddenly, completely breaking the already-fractured moment, “I was just going to sample that attraction potion we picked up today on Steve. Steve, you’ll love it. It’ll have all the girls fawning over you.”
“No, I know that, and obviously, you know that. But you know what some of these groups are like.”
“Wuzthmattasweehart?” Steve mumbled sleepily, rubbing at his eyes.
Tony takes him up on the offer, eagerly chatting about the research he’s doing. It all goes way over Steve’s head, but he finds that he likes hearing Tony talk. It’s clear that Tony is passionate about what he’s studying and unselfconscious about his passion, and Steve’s always liked that in his partners. And Tony really is lovely in his submission, his back a graceful arch, his head bowed at just the right angle that Steve can’t resist taking a full picture of him from behind because it’s such a perfect post. He figures he’ll show it to Tony before he leaves to get his permission to include it. He almost wishes he’d added a collar to Tony’s outfit, but he contents himself with imagining how he might look if they ever do this again: he bets Tony is beautiful when he’s overstimulated and begging and unable to touch himself with his bound hands.
Rhodey raises an eyebrow. “Been here the whole time. Glad to see I made such an impression on you.”
He sighs, leaning back in his chair. How does he tell Tony that it’s no longer that simple? When he and Tony had first started talking about the amendments, he’d thought it would be, but his team has shown him otherwise. Sam still isn’t comfortable with the Accords, even with the recent changes; he’s made that abundantly clear over the times that he and Steve have discussed them. Natasha has been setting missions for herself—missions that Steve suspects she wouldn’t be able to complete if she were limited by the Accords. And Steve—well, Steve won’t return without the other three. They left as a team, they’ll come back as a team. But he tries anyway, in halting words that don’t do his complicated feelings justice, to explain the complexities that have arisen in the weeks since the amendments passing.
“No, I mean it! We’re not even gay!” Tony groused. “But every time they talk about us—you know their last podcast was about how we’re corrupting the children?”
It’s just—it’s a little awkward is the thing. He doesn’t actually know Tony very well, they’re certainly not friends, and he doesn’t know if this gesture will come off as condescending.
“That’s rough,” he murmurs.
“How mad are you going to be if I say yes?” he murmurs, glancing at Wanda out of the corner of his eye. She’s crying through a wide smile as the realization that these changes meant to protect mean she’ll be able to be with Vision again soon finally hits her. Natasha reaches down and ruffles her hair affectionately.
He dresses, makes the bed, and heads out into the kitchen, where he can hear Sam making breakfast. But, to his surprise, it’s not Sam who’s casually flipping eggs by the stove. Sam is there, for sure, perched on one of counter stools, but Tony is the one who’s dishing up omelets.
He trades off on the ropes, the lingerie, and the locations as the hours drag on, first the gold ropes and the silver lingerie on the pillow and then putting Tony in a pink nightie for a few pictures on the couch and the red ropes and a green thong back on the pillow and on and on and on. Tony is even willing to let him take a couple shots on Steve’s bed (black panties and red ropes), and fuck, but Steve doesn’t think he’ll ever be able to get that image out of his head of Tony looking up at him from twisted blankets in a rope dress. He really hopes Tony is up for doing this again without the camera.
“Steve!” Tony hollers through the communicator. Steve glances up from the board game he’s playing with Natasha and Clint and over at where the communicator hangs from the ship’s wall. He still doesn’t really understand the technology behind the communicators even after a year of being awake, but they’re hung all over the
“Gentlemen!” Dottie shouted, making them both wince. “Get back to work!”
Tony runs a hand over U’s crushed pincer and winces. U ended up getting nearly flattened by some of the Malibu mansion’s foundations when it crumbled into the ocean. The bot’s going to need not only a new personality chip, but new struts, new wheels, new
“And you’ll take them to the UN?” Steve asks, slightly amazed that Tony is even willing to listen to Steve’s thoughts after everything that’s happened between them.
Steve almost stops, he’s so surprised by Bucky’s nonchalant answer.
It takes Steve a moment for the words to sink in. “Tony—”
“Sorry,” they both say at the same time.
birthday,” Steve says, looking at Tony’s hand angrily spritzing the orchids.
He sits back. Out of all the things Tony could have said, asking for Steve’s opinion is the one he’d expected the least. It’s not that he doesn’t know that Tony respects him. Tony has always been one to consider Steve’s opinion after Loki and New York, with the notable exception of everything that happened with Ultron. Even during the whole mess with the Accords, Tony had been willing to listen, even as he’d pushed for Steve to sign.
“So what are you making today?”
, Tony. We’re staying here.”
“Sweetheart?” Steve asked. It sounded like it wasn’t the first time he’d asked. Tony shook himself, forcing himself to return to their room. He knew his mind had a tendency to wander but that was getting a little ridiculous!
Bucky is waiting for them when they land near the village he’s been staying in. He looks good—grown out his hair, gained some weight, lost some of the dark shadows under his eyes. And he’s smiling, which is more than Steve had dared to dream about. Bucky steps forward as the ramp comes down, opening his arms for a hug that Steve gladly gives him.
“I think crawfish are kinda hard to find around here, Sam,” Steve said, hiding a grin behind his hand.
for all the damage that had happened here when it was clearly not their fault, he was going to pitch a
“Good,” Tony says around a mouthful of chicken. “Not the same as the old team, of course, but I’m working on whipping them into shape. Ororo’s got the most amount of experience working on a team, which is surprising cause you’d think the SHIELD agents would, but then, she grew up with her abilities. There’s this guy—absolutely brilliant though he kind of terrifies me—he takes in kids like her and trains them. She’s been with him since she was five.”
Tony, eyes only for Steve. He’s smiling and, as Steve watches, gives him a little wave, small enough that it wouldn’t be noticed by the press. Steve thinks about the question he asked himself so long ago: who’s there with Tony? And finally, he has an answer: he is, for as long as Tony will have him.
(See the end of the chapter for
For the first time, Steve found himself paying attention to the rumors. This wasn’t some nebulous claim Rumlow was making with zero evidence to back him up. This was an actual organization who had a history of mutual dislike with Steve and Tony. Money talked, and if Focus on the Family really had threatened to pull their funding unless something was done about
When eventually Steve’s kisses trailed down Tony’s neck, he found himself gently urging Tony’s hips into a rhythm against his. They rocked together, both no more than half-hard, though slowly stiffening. Tony’s eyes were half-closed, hiding his beautiful whiskey eyes, and Steve suddenly couldn’t stand for that.
probably would have been cancelled after only a few years. Tony liked to tease them every once in a while by tossing them bones, usually in the form of him tweeting selfies of him and Steve whenever they came across each other in public. Steve didn’t encourage it at all, though the occasional fan fiction that Bucky sent him made him chuckle (usually the college AUs—if only their fans knew how their
Steve takes another moment to be excited about the prospect of seeing Tony again before he pulls out his phone, tucking it against his ear as he starts putting away the ropes. Tony’s up for this again, up to see
Which is true. Wakanda may be slowly opening up to the world in that they’re sharing their technological advancements (Tony, he knows from their conversations, is salivating over what they’ve accomplished), but their borders are still closed. Bucky is as safe as houses here, for as long as he decides to stay.
The copper pipes running the room are too close to avoid bumping into for someone as large as Steve, so he doesn’t even bother trying to avoid them, letting them brush against his skin as he follows the sound of Tony humming. When he’d first joined the crew, he’d been worried about Tony complaining that Steve couldn’t move around the engine room without knocking
“And maybe we could discuss—uh—doing this again?” Tony asks. He sounds nervous and hopeful all at the same time, fingers tapping on the doorframe as he looks at Steve with wide eyes.
“That—that
“Miss Potts sent one of the team doctors up yesterday after Sir missed a board meeting.”
“Why didn’t you tell me we’re going bankrupt?” Tony demands, crossing his arms.
“That’s because they’re all back in Europe. And it’s not like we’re all that close to her, not like Agnes or—or—um—who was that other person who was hanging around Wanda a while back?”
“You too?” Steve asked.
“Between what?”
Tony flashed him a bright smile. “I’m
He snorts as he walks up to the house.
“No, spend some time outside of talking about the Accords. We were good at this once, weren’t we?” Tony’s Bambi eyes are big and wide and Steve doesn’t even bother to fight against their pull.
“Yeah,” Tony said happily. Steve glanced over at him to see Tony running his fingers through the mess of come on his stomach and bringing them up to his mouth to lick off. He groaned again, oversensitive cock twitching against his thigh.
Steve reaches for the door handle, balancing the two drinks he’s carrying in his other hand, only for the door to swing open on its own. He glances up just in time to see Tony lower his hand, a welcoming smile on his face. Steve gives him a warm smile of his own. They’re getting better at this. Just last week, Tony closed a door right in Steve’s face because it didn’t even occur to him to open it for him.
“That’s not—”
And he thinks about the letter he sent, about being worried that Tony was rattling around in the Compound by himself, and he wonders if that’s exactly what he’s forced on Tony. Because he looks around and he realizes that no matter what he said, the team isn’t really split apart at all. They’re almost all right here with him.
“I’ve never worn a romper before,” Tony says with a casual shrug that belies the tension building in his body as he watches Steve pull one of the ice cubes out of the bowl. “Wanted a chance to—
long felt uncomfortable with the U.S. military feeling like they had the right to invade other countries just because they wanted to, and he thinks that, if he’d been given the chance to actually sit down and read the Accords before they’d been so unceremoniously thrust at them, he might have actually agreed with the things that were being said. But he had just come off of that disastrous mission in Lagos and Wanda was grieving and Tony had said they needed to be put in check, and all Steve had been able to think of was the last time he’d trusted a government agency—SHIELD—and look how that had ended up?
“You’re not going to let me live this down, are you?”
Tony shrugs. “A few.” His voice quiets to a whisper that even Steve has to strain to hear, “And maybe I’m tired of the Compound being as quiet as it is.”
“Okay.”
He breaks off, shuddering. Steve looks at him, at the way he’s huddled in on himself, and decides that what he’s doing isn’t good enough. He gets up and moves to the couch, to sit next to Tony and tuck him against his side. Tony makes a small, choked-off noise and rests his head on Steve’s shoulder. Steve tries hard not to think about how
“At this hour? I mean, don’t get me wrong, I’m all for staying up late, but even I would turn away a visitor.”
think that Steve would want to try again after everything Tony had put him through?
Steve blinks at it, eventually saying, “Thanks, Tony,” as he drops it into one of his own pockets. Tony waits for him to acknowledge the courting gift—tell him that it’s pretty or maybe even give Tony his own gift—but Steve doesn’t do any of that. He just turns to Natasha and mutters something too low for Tony to hear before leading her into the human village that Tony isn’t supposed to go into because he keeps setting fire to things.
Tony wrinkles his nose at the mug.
Tony: Then there you have it!
“Because if you did,” Bucky snapped back, “you would have told us about it sometime in the last three years. Instead, you let us think that you and Tony were just coworkers, if not friends, because you knew that if we found out about it, we’d try to talk you out of it. And now that I know, that’s exactly what I’m going to do. Because, Steve? This is a bad idea.”
“He’s my business partner.”
“You wanna talk about it?” he asks eventually.
“Tony, you have to know you have a very attractive human form.”
“Would you like to hear a Captain America story?” she asks, unfamiliar as she is with most other common bedtime stories.
“Don’t do that,” he begs. “I can’t get it up again that fast.”
Steve tries very hard to hide his smile behind his hand as he puts his pen down, not wanting Tony to think that he’s laughing at him. He’s been doing this kind of thing for the last thirteen years and he’s never run into
“Absolutely.”
Steve: Nope.
for him, winter is when Steve’s powers are at their height, and he loves watching Steve in his element. Steve has told him how long it took him to come to terms with his abilities, how rocky the road to acceptance was, so he’s positively delighted to see Steve so at peace with himself these days. It’s been three years since the Ice Spirit returned to the Forest and nature has never felt more harmonious.
looked worried.
“We are,” Tony said, smiling wistfully at the picture. He wished he and Steve had been able to linger longer together in their bedroom that morning. It had had the potential to be such a good morning if he hadn’t been so fuzzy minded. It was rare that they were both up early enough to… get things done. “Come on! I’ll show you to your desk.”
“I’m—”
Tony stopped, blinked, frowned, blinked again. “What do you mean ‘what’?”
“Family?” Tony repeated, sounding both skeptical and surprised. “We’ve known Wanda for how long? And she’s never once mentioned any family.”
something but he’d been planning on saving it for the one-year anniversary of the store opening. Still, he thinks Tony might appreciate it now too.
His phone chimed:
Caller: I know this is an unhealthy relationship, but I don’t want to leave her. She makes me happy.
Tony’s breath hitches. “I’m going to get the USB back.”
By the time they’re finished, it’s gotten dark outside and Steve has taken more than two hundred photos. He’ll be more than busy going through all of them over the next week to select the best twenty for his final project. He finishes rubbing ointment into Tony’s wrists and helps him stand, passing him his clothes.
“I wasn’t ready to get married!” Tony shouted, all remorse that might have been in his voice when he picked up the phone gone now. “I was twenty-two, Steve! I’d just realized that I’d fucked up about that job—trust me, I knew it was a mistake as soon as I accepted that offer, but you wouldn’t let me apologize. You were so caught up on that stupid proposal, you refused to see any other option!”
at a sleepover when she was far too young, so he knows what nightmares look like. His family have a pretty decent-sized house back home in Philadelphia, nothing like what Tony grew up in of course, but large enough that his parents didn’t always hear when he and his sisters had a bad night, and, as a result, it frequently fell to Rhodey to help his little sisters fall back asleep. He’s never begrudged them for it, and right now, when Tony is whimpering in the bed next to him with a black eye given to him by someone who should never have laid a hand on him, he’s downright happy for all those sleepless nights spent singing lullabies and telling stories.
we do here?”
But then he’d proposed the night after their graduation, completely convinced that Tony would say yes. Tony gave him a horrible deer in the headlights look that Steve knew he would never be able to forget, closed the ring box, and gave it back to Steve. And it was then that Tony had told him—he’d gotten an offer somewhere else and said yes months before they’d heard back from the place they had agreed on. Steve remembered that station; he’d put an application in there too. They’d both been convinced he’d get the job, he’d been a shoo-in, but he’d gotten rejected instead, the position offered to a more established and well-known talk show host. He’d thought that had been the end of it, but Tony had apparently been so convinced the position was Steve’s that he’d accepted their offer to him when it came in.
He’s not sure what to do with that. “Sure,” he murmurs, wiping some of the extra cream off on his khakis. “So, fashion coach?”
“Yeah?”
“There’s so many,” Tony bites out.
“Yeah,” he breathes.
“Oh yes. Absolutely.”
Captain America raises his head and looks at him. Even from this distance, Tony can see his wide eyes. “That was
Steve glanced toward Tony’s office again, but Tony had long since disappeared inside. With another sigh, he headed toward his own office. He’d gotten busy over the weekend making sure his apartment was clean for when Sam and Bucky arrived for their annual visit for Steve’s birthday and then meeting Tony at the bar near his apartment last night, so he hadn’t done the research for the guest on their show that he normally did. He wanted to make sure he was prepared. He’d only made the mistake once of showing up
“Steve,” Tony panted. “
“Like me?”
Tony: That’s okay. So is Steve and we never judge him so you’re perfectly fine.
“Oh.”
Tony rests his head against Steve’s shoulder, making small snuffling sounds against his neck. Steve pets his hair and kisses his nose again and asks him if he’d like to hear a story. Tony nods.
Tony sighed dramatically and flopped back over onto Steve’s chest. “You would me deeply, darling, but I will brave the wilds of Dottie’s Ladies Association for you.”
Steve: And now you’re worried that their rumors are ruining your marriage?
Steve glances over at the other bed again, where Sam is laying on his side and snoring lightly, and makes a decision. He gets back up out of bed, throws on a coat, and leaves the bedroom. He makes his way silently out of the safehouse to the front porch, where Clint is standing guard, having drawn the short straw for the first watch.
“Steve—”
It takes him a moment to remember he’d said he was out on a run. He grimaces. “I’m trying not to think about that. Cold water’s the worst.”
Tony nods again. “Howard tells me lots of those.”
“Did you know?” Tony interrupts him brusquely.
“To everyone except Tony, I think.”
He’s fully intending on making a list of all the things that bother him about the Accords so that he can take them back to Tony and say something like “This is why I don’t want to sign.” But to his surprise, the Accords are shockingly… reasonable.
That argument on the helicarrier was pretty rough. And it’s not like either of them has apologized about it. They’ve just kind of awkwardly ignored it and moved on with their lives. Sometimes, it makes him wonder if Steve really did mean everything that he said, even though Tony hadn’t.
It was fine.
“Better, darling?” Tony asked cheekily.
bother him that he still doesn’t know what it is). “Yes, it is,” he says eventually.
“You might,” Tony agrees, though he doesn’t sound concerned at all. “And I might like that. All that coiled strength pinning me down? Oh, honey, yes.” He shivers, a small delighted smile curling his lips up.
“Then you shouldn’t blame yourself either,” Steve shoots back. “Because you did the same thing. You just had a little more information than we did.”
“Hey,” he says softly when he gets inside. “Tony, sweetheart, breathe.”
“You should be.” He fiddles with the toy on Pepper’s desk again—it kind of looks like a windmill, he observes dispassionately, if a windmill had two blades and moved in every direction instead of one. “Hey, I’m taking the jet to DC tonight. I wanna help get Aunt Peggy settled in her new place.”
“Hey, don’t worry about it. We’ll have to have you back on the show sometime.”
Steve: That wasn’t my question.
“Well, they’re hugging, so maybe they’re family?”
turn pink at the sight, Natasha, thank you very much), and climbs under the blankets.
He casts about for another topic and lands on, “How are Clint and Scott?”
“I’m here,” he says at a normal volume, knowing that JARVIS will easily pick up what he’s saying and transmit it to Tony. Tony’s just being loud because he’s always loud and because he’s down in the engine room of the ship with all its noises from the conversion of stardust into energy.
He gives a longing glance to the refrigerator, knowing that he really shouldn’t open the fridge to keep the food and milk cold as long as possible. Doesn’t mean that he doesn’t want to stick his head inside anyway to cool off.
“Steve, darling, we can talk whenever you want to.”
. Mr. Hart had stopped by to tell him what a good job he was doing, so whatever he was doing, he was good at it.
“I believe his lawyers have been called to aid in Mr. Barton’s and Mr. Lang’s cases.”
“No,” Tony disagrees. “When everyone you’ve shared a bed with says they don’t want to share a bed with you, you learn to concede the point.”
Steve smiled at him as a wave of color washed over the two of them. Tony’s brown eyes sparkled in the light pouring in from the light next to the couch. “Me too,” he said and leaned in for a kiss.
Tony always ran. He never stopped running. He ran from his dad’s expectations, from his responsibilities at Stark Industries, from every tough conversation he’d ever had to have. Once, Steve had thought that that was okay because Tony was always running
“How? You can’t set foot in a hundred and seventy-five countries without being arrested. Believe me, this will be a public spectacle and you won’t make it out without being noticed.”
“I did?”
“Come in, sit down,” Pierce said, ushering them into the chairs across the desk. Pierce himself took a seat on the corner of his desk. He did things like that sometimes, said he felt it made him look approachable and friendly. Steve thought it made him look like a college liberal arts professor who always showed up to class on low-quality drugs and wanted everyone to call them by their first name.
“No!” Steve exclaims, horrified that that’s probably exactly how it sounds to Tony. How does everything he say always manages to sound smarmy and rude? “I just—we
Natasha is the one watching the news when Tony’s press conference about the new Avengers begins. Steve is in the kitchen, talking to Wanda and Sam as they cook dinner (though Steve’s contribution is chopping vegetables and that’s it), but he looks up as soon as he hears Tony’s voice. His distraction nearly leads to him chopping his own thumb off, so he quickly sets the knife down and heads into the living room.
“Okay.”
ago—and yet he can’t find them anywhere. He’s already checked hospital death records, looking for anyone who died with his own name on their wrist, but unless his Steve died in the wilderness and a body had never been recovered, they’re still alive.
“Open your eyes, Tony. Let me see you,” he whispered against the curve of Tony’s throat.
“Rumlow told me about them personally just this morning,” Tony added.
To Steve’s surprise, Tony makes a disgusted face. “A compromise,” he says. “Supposedly.”
Tony shrugs. “I usually use the color system but I thought with the red ropes, it might be good to have a second word just in case.” It’s probably an unnecessary precaution, but if it makes Tony more comfortable, then Steve’s more than happy to use both.
“But you still knew they were murdered,” Tony states.
startle Tony out of his dark thoughts and he looks up at Steve, wide-eyed and scared. “You said it, you weren’t close to having an interface. I didn’t believe you then and I should’ve. You were my teammate and you needed my support.” He sighs, turning away from Tony so he doesn’t see his disappointment in himself. He’d never asked what Tony had seen in the portal, not wanting to face his own actions that day, that he had given the order to close the portal while Tony was still up there. And now he finds out that Tony had seen so much it had scared even him, who never seemed scared. “And I didn’t give it.”
“Come on, sweetheart,” he urged. “Come for me.”
“When you two aren’t emotionally compromised,” she amends. “But the two of you worked well together when you weren’t being influenced by the scepter or Wanda’s magic or the UN’s timetable. Why else do you think we had a standing bet about when you and Tony would start dating?”
“Hi, Uncle Grant, is there something you want to tell me about my soulmark?”
Tony is very clearly in a bad mood when he walks into the store that morning. Steve glances at him from the corner of his eye as he finishes ringing up Thor, but Tony doesn’t seem to want to talk about it. Instead, he shoulders past Steve into the backroom to drop his stuff off. Steve and Thor both watch him go, carefully not saying anything even though Steve wants to reach out and comfort him about whatever went wrong so early in the morning.
“Well, I guess we’ll just have to go and get you another one tomorrow then, won’t we?” she says, fighting to keep her voice steady. How can Howard miss what’s right in front of him?
DUM-E makes a sad chirping sound.
Tony is grinning by now, which is good, because it tells him that he’s said the right thing. He doesn’t always know with Tony. Sometimes, what seems like the obvious thing to say is the exact wrong thing and sometimes, Tony’s just like everyone else. He’d hoped that this is one of those things that Tony just needs a little encouragement on, but honestly, it’s pretty much hit or miss with his business partner.
Pierce laughed a small, fake laugh. “Not exactly. I can keep the show as long as I bring on new hosts, people that these focus groups recommend, you know how it works. You have a very popular show. I’d hate to lose it.”
“Like as an employee?”
“And what can she do?” Steve asks curiously. The new team hasn’t been called out yet, so he hasn’t heard much about them other than what Natasha has been able to pick up through the grapevine.
“Okay, yes, but you and Tony were…”
Horrified, Steve’s eyes dart up from where he’d been looking at his hands to Sam. “No,” he exclaims. “That’s not—I didn’t—”
He blinked at it, befuddled by its sudden appearance. How had it gotten there? He and Steve had picked out bright yellow lights when they’d remodeled last year—bright for the new decade and all its groovy technicolor rainbows.
And yet—Steve loved their show. He loved their booth with the letters from fans taped up on the backside of the door. He loved the mugs that Pierce had gotten them for their one-hundredth show with the show’s logo printed on the side. He could feel the anger start to drain out of him as soon as he sat down in his chair. He put his headphones on and tested the microphone. Tony wasn’t there yet, but that wasn’t surprising. While he was always on time to their shows, he was rarely early unless they had a guest speaker that he was showing around the station.
Natasha finally turns away from the television to give him a curious look. “What do
Steve snorts. “What would you call Maria?”
“It’s a very famous Jewish parable,” Ana says, equally softly. “Passed down over the centuries. My mother used to tell it to me to help me sleep. I liked hearing about the people with spoons on their elbows.”
“I could do dinner,” Tony says thoughtfully. “What kind of bugs do you like to eat?”
“I bought it for your birthday,” Tony says, heated gaze locked on Steve’s.
He started to push Tony away, giving himself a few inches to breathe air that didn’t smell so strongly of Tony’s cologne. Tony whined, snuffling against his neck. The little sound almost made Steve give in, but he reminded himself that he had to ask. He had to make sure that this didn’t have anything to do with the argument they’d had last week.
Out of nowhere, there was the faint sound of laughter, muted as though they were hearing it through a wall or from a great distance. Tony blinked, taken aback by the sound. He tried to peer through the curtains on the far side of the room, behind Steve’s bed, half-wondering if one of their neighbors was playing at being a Peeping Tom, but he couldn’t make out any shapes in their front yard other than the tree swaying gently in the wind.
“Didn’t understand what?” he asks.
But Clint and Scott though? That’s something he can do something about.
“Aw no, man, you did, but then I saw I had some waffle mix and who doesn’t like waffles, right? Oh, hey, did I ever tell you about the time me and my cousin Ernesto went to this breakfast bar place that they used to have in Elmdale?”
“Don’t worry, that’s just Dummy,” Tony says.
“Huh?” Steve asks, looking up from his paperwork.
a good one.”
When Tony comes back, pretty and shining in silver, Steve has him kneel on the pillow on the floor. He ties Tony’s hands together with the gold rope and then ties those to his ankles, double checks that the ropes aren’t too tight, and then adjusts the lighting so that Tony’s lit only with the sunlight from the window.
“Hmm but I’m sure you look so good with the water streaming down those rippling pectorals,” Tony purrs. It should be a ridiculous line—and it is—but Steve still chokes on his own spit. Tony—he isn’t—they’re not—sure he
Uncle Grant chuckles. “I don’t think soulmates work like that. You can’t just force them.”
annoyed.”
“Is this live?” Steve asks Natasha as the reporters begin clamoring. She nods, right as Tony selects one of the journalists.
“Steve.”
“I want to take you to the fireworks for your birthday.”
“Maybe then the sorority girls will stop looking at me like I’m a kid,” he mutters to himself, surveying the mess DUM-E made of Rhodey’s bed. Maybe, if they’re both lucky, Rhodey won’t notice the grease on his sheets. Tony doesn’t have the time right now to take them down to the laundry, not if he wants to get DUM-E fixed in time for bed tonight. Anyway, he
“It’s a private box, no one’s even going to notice you’re there,” Bucky replies. “Besides, I think you’ll like the ending.”
It took Tony a moment to realize what he was talking about. Circus? What circus? There hadn’t been a circus in Westview in—
“Which is why I’m worrying about it now.” Tony takes a sip of the coffee and beams down at it. “You remembered,” he murmurs.
Knowing Howard, he only ever tells stories about Steve’s heroic deeds, forgetting that Steve was just as human as everyone else and hammering it into Tony that Steve is a figure he’ll never be able to live up to. She doesn’t want to do that. Steve is someone that Tony should love for himself, not for being the hero of the war.
The idea that she can just
“Could you grab the box of rosemary plants in the back?”
“Yeah,” Steve agrees. At least they hadn’t dissolved into arguing a few minutes in. He watches Tony go, still mulling over Tony’s words:
He raises his arm, aims, and fires. There’s a high-pitched whine as the gauntlet warms up, and Tony has to fight to stop himself from covering his ears because
“Modified?”
Steve is well-aware of what Tony is up to. Of course he knows, how could he not? He and Tony have been married for ten years and Tony has been doing this since they started dating all the way back in grad school. Besides, it isn’t like Tony is subtle. Tony has 206 bones in his body and all of them are flamboyant.
“Nothing, Mrs. Jones!”
, but his sensors are telling him that there’s something wrong, and when there’s that many sensors going off at one time, it can be overwhelming. So, in a sense, he does feel pain, it’s just that it’s different than how humans experience it.”
Steve still looks unsure, but he obligingly pushes his sleeve cuff up, revealing Tony’s name right there on his wrist. Tony exhales, relief flooding through him. It’s real. This is
He stares at the message for almost a minute, wondering if there’s supposed to be some sort of subliminal message coming from it. Tony—
By the end of the day, the store looks like a miniature tornado blew through it (it did actually, sometime in the early afternoon, when a kid opened one of the Storms in a Bottle) but they made way more than their stretch goal for the day and Steve is as happy as a clam.
