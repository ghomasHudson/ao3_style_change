Steve blushed and gave a shrug, pretending nonchalance. “Yes, I was. But I'm also curious now to know how a simple flower made all this to you.”
"Yes," Steve agreed again, feeling his stomach churn.
"Why, thank you very much, Mr. Don't ever call me Mr. Stark again," Tony said, but he smiled back. It was an extremely domestic scene and, for any spectator who didn't know the context, they'd certainly never have imagined that it was a lawyer with the father of his client accused of murder, going to trial in the next few days. Or months. Who would know?
"Well, it looks like we're not the only ones who are going to enjoy the weekend," Tony said. "Anyway, give her the message when they are
Steve turned the door handle and his eyes immediately met the girl's, who stood up as soon as she saw them enter the room, knocking down the chair behind her. Without taking their eyes off her, Steve and Tony stood across the table, facing the girl. The two exchanged a look and Tony nodded slightly to Steve, who smiled.
dead? I-”
“Wandering in my own space-time. I spent all that time reliving the most important moments of my life. Each of them.” Steve made a sad face.
Steve thought.
promised. I said nothing.” Nat turned and headed for the spare elevator, since Tony had destroyed the first one.
“You weren’t there when I woke up,” Tony said, hurt.
“Tell me something, Doctor Magic.” Tony took a step forward, approaching the Sorcerer Supreme and looking at him from head to toes. “Why would we help you? Why would you come to me, among all the possibilities on your little list, to ask for help? To ask me to protect your precious little box with
"Will they need help?" Steve asked aloud, looking towards the Tower.
"Ahem," Tony cleared his throat exaggeratedly, drawing the attention of the deputy, who turned to him. "Chief, if it's not too much trouble, I would like to have access to documents regarding my client's arrest and Captain Rogers here would like to be able to see his son," he opened what Steve thought was his most convincing professional smile, made to persuade, not to warm, because his eyes didn't crinkle at the sides and there was no sparkle in them, just an objective to be achieved.
“Alright, fine. I'll conveniently look the other way, okay?”
"Speaking of company," Tony let go of Steve's neck and took an envelope from the inside pocket of his coat. "Here's your gift.”
Steve smiled beautifully.
Tony gasped out of his thoughts in shock, which soon turned into a sequence of incongruous and growing moans. Steve was back, with Tony's feet supported in his shoulders, his hands in Tony's butt, opening his cheeks to give him free and complete access to his hole, where he arrived without further warning with his tongue.
He was pacing up and down, not sure if he should run out and meet Peter at the police station or if he waited and tried to find a lawyer ... "Natasha! She will know where I can find a lawyer." With a racing heart, Steve dialed Natasha's number, which he knew by heart. Two rings later, she answered.
Steve nodded and Tony smiled. “Great, because I’ve been thinking about you,
They were really annoying mosquitoes, which stung and stung without mercy, and each question hurt like Steve's skin was raw. But he remained unyielding, always looking ahead, at Tony's back, with his face impassive, maintaining his best poker face. Until finally -
Steve pushed Tony away and left him sitting on his lap for an instant, long enough for the sunlight coming in through the window to bathe Tony’s entire body, creating shadows on Tony’s angular and turned muscles, which the armor always hid, but that, oh yes, were there, waiting for Steve, all that time.
“Box? Wait a minute, the one Strange brought in?” Tony saw Steve's expression change from confusion to understanding, to confusion again, and ended in suspicion. “Tony, what did you do with the box? Tell me you haven’t-”
"I know what you mean," Steve said, rolling his eyes. "If I wasn’t clear with my story, that's how I identify myself."
"I didn’t want you to have to go either, but it's important."
“I wanna ride you.”
“Have a good trip, boss.”
“Yes, we do.”
take care of you."
“Thanks.” Steve smiled and took a step forward, a tiny step, but enough to keep them so close that Tony could count the green spots that mixed with the blue of his eyes. “But why do I have a feeling you’re not telling me the whole truth?” Steve slid his hands down Tony’s arm and his warm hands found Tony’s, which were freezing. The contrast made Tony shiver.
"You have no idea what you're doing. I practically founded Vegas.”
“Great,” Steve said. “Let's move.”
“As you wish.”
"Do not be late.”
was one of the first things you heard about when you came back from the dead, then you must imagine what public opinion must have said about what the Director of the largest spy agency in the world should know about it.” Tony frowned. “Everyone blamed me for not knowing that the Skrulls were among us and for letting things escalate to the point where they arrived. Besides, those damn green aliens with the weird chin infected my technology, rendered the Extremis useless, making me practically dead weight during the battle against them. Everyone thought I was helping the enemy when, in fact, I was being sabotaged. Add to that the fact that rumors that I had benefited from the Civil War to get rich spread, and that’s it. You have a witch hunt targeting me.”
"They aren’t, no. Spider-Man is an Avenger.”
“Yes, we did. The best of us will survive.” He smiled sadly.
It took Steve a few moments to look away from Tony’s perfection to look him in the eye, two pieces of the blue sky of the most perfect summer day, bright, smart, intelligent, scathing, quick, analytical, benevolent and able to express so much love. Tony was incredible, the owner of all the best adjectives that the languages that Steve knew had. He finally focused on the present.
Tony thought, going to sit at the table to eat. It was an extremely pleasant start to the evening, with Clint and Thor alternating karaoke shifts while the others ate.
But it was impossible not to let sleep come when he was hugging the best pillow in the world, with the most incredible and mesmerizing scent Tony had ever felt in his life and which, by a happy coincidence, was also the love of his life.
"Didn’t need to, my love. I know you." Tony pulled Steve toward one of the windows. "Out there we have a bathroom, by the time we're at the beach and stuff.”
Tony came back to himself, focusing on the refrigerator.
Steve was clearly confused. His eyes darted back and forth across the kitchen island, without focusing on any specific object. He seemed to do the math and tried to put together a timeline that made no sense to him. Tony then had his answer. No, Steve didn’t know about his memory loss and he wasn’t sure which feeling to choose to live that moment. He had several at his disposal. In the end, Tony chose relief with doses of apprehension. It seemed appropriate.
you're not them. And I have no idea why you think you can have some kind of feelings for me.” She shook her head. “That's not how it works between dimensions. There's no connection between them, so it's simply
Tony frowned. “And why did the war continue?”
Steve sighed. "I'm sorry," he said, without looking up.
“Boyfriend.”
Steve assessed his own situation. His ears were no longer buzzing, his eyes were focused, and despite his racing heart and still be hyperventilating, he could tell he was in control of his own body. So he nodded. "I am."
Breathing hard, both of them came to themselves with their heads resting on each other, smiling like fools. With his heart beating at the normal pace, or as normal as possible after all that, Steve got out of Tony and lay down beside him, completely exhausted, pulling Tony into his embrace, snuggling and protecting him.
Tony’s luck had apparently returned.
, but
“It wasn’t worth it,” they both said at the same time. Steve smiled a little, like when you share a secret. A second-hand memory flashed in Tony’s head. A footage.
Steve’s smile widened. “I’m not going anywhere.”
"You're beautiful," Steve looked up at Tony again and smiled, kissing Tony before his hands moved to deal, with skill, with the button and zipper. And with a jerk, pants and underwear were on the floor. Tony gasped as his dick popped out, and he did the same with Steve's pants and disengaged from his, kicking them away.
“See?” Steve smiled and kept going.
place now. Only ours. No one else in the world knows about here. It’s our private paradise.”
“Wow, that's quite a story,” Natasha commented with a whistle.
With a sigh, Tony slowly untangled his legs from Steve’s legs, got up from the bed, grabbed the nearest piece of clothing - which happened to be Steve’s T-shirt -, got dressed and went into the kitchen. There, he turned on the coffee maker and, while waiting for the coffee to be ready, he realized how strange his body was, kind of sticky, kind of rigid in strange places, which usually didn’t get that way. Lifting his shirt to see what was wrong, Tony laughed not meaning to. A transparent, slightly whitish layer covered a large part of his abdomen, making it stiff and uncomfortable.
“I was just kidding, silly.” Steve kissed the top of Tony's head. “Yes, I promised you a shower, and we’re going to take that shower, don’t worry. But can we finish our coffees first?” Steve pouted.
Tony frowned. “And why did the war continue?”
Steve shook his head.
Steve and Tony exchanged a look.
Tony thought.
“Before I give you the box, there is one thing I need to say about it that you need to know.” Strange stopped smiling and looked seriously at each of the Avengers present, his eyes getting darker.
"Hey, Nat?"
The box would be empty
Steve!” Tony let his head fall on Steve's shoulder when the soldier stroked the head of his cock, completely covered with his precome. “I-I won’t be able to hold it back much longer.”
Steve picked up a bowl and a set of measuring spoons in the cupboard and placed it in front of Peter.
Steve blinked a few times, confused.
"No," he heard himself say. Then he added, "I like to talk to you."
“Now, Steve, we're on a stage, in front of our friends, under colored lights, after telling each other that we love each other. What do you think comes next? We put on a little show." Tony untangled his hands from Steve's hands and wrapped them around Steve's neck, pulling him down so they could finally reach the grand finale with the kiss they deserved, to the sound of cheers and the “I always knew it" from Natasha.
“Stop,” Steve said, throwing the belt somewhere behind him.
"I don’t know if I understand what this is," Steve said looking at the card he had taken from the envelope.
"Great," Clint said. "At least two of us aren’t gonna turn into barbecue if the worst happens.”
I know I cannot help myself
Natasha also called and stayed in the game. Without showing any emotion, the spy again discarded the first card in the deck and opened another card in the center of the table, a jack of clubs, starting a new round.
And I know that it must be the woman in you.
"Only the four of us are gonna play?" He asked the spy.
"We can go to my table."
It was a miracle. Steve had died that day on the steps on his way to the courthouse, when Steve would be tried for the crimes he committed, during what became known as the Civil War of the superhero community, after approval of the Superhuman Registration Act. Of course, the trial never happened, because Steve was shot and killed with four shots before they even finished climbing those infinite steps. He died like a hero, trying to save the policemen and guards who made his escort, believing that the sniper shot could hit them. Typical of Steve. To sacrifice himself for people he didn’t even know. Imagine what he was able to do for those he considered his friends?
But his heart allowed itself to dream when it came to Steve.
“I should’ve stayed there with you,” Steve said quietly.
Tony's eyes widened. "Really? And what did he say?"
“Come on, your coffee will get cold.” Steve pointed to the cup on the outside of the island and Tony found himself walking over there, as if in a trance. He had no control over his own body. All he saw was Steve looking at him, guiding him to where he wanted Tony to stay.
"Thank you," Sam smiled and headed for the elevator.
Steve's eyes widened. “Are you kidding? How could I not want you, Tony? Have you ever looked in the mirror? Have you ever paid attention to yourself? When you talk to people, when you’re out there risking your life to save the world every single day and then the other, when you pretend you don’t care, but do everything to keep us comfortable and always around, like a family?
“No. It'll only detonate when those forty seconds are over,” Tony looked at Steve and he could almost see the soldier's brain running.
“You’re a beautiful and intriguing flower, but were you the one who did this to me?” He turned the flower around, analyzing it from all sides. The stem was a shade of dark green, almost black, and smooth as velvet, without leaves. And the petals seemed to glow with the most diverse shades of red when the light reflected on them. Tony brought the flower close to his face and smelled it again, only to find the unusual aroma was still there. Soap, clean clothes and one more, that intrigued Tony. Then he noticed something, a detail that had gone unnoticed before.
“But I was just kidding myself. I should’ve realized that everything was going downhill when every time we tried to talk it all went wrong, either it was never the right time, or it was just a mixture of those two factors.”
“But if you'll let us,” Tony smiled. “We'd like to help you make this burden less heavy.”
“And can I know why?”
Tony looked at his cup, now empty. “And yet, you asked me to come in.”
"Of course, you know how to party like a few.”
“Because I'm the one taking care of you.” Steve said approaching the stretcher where Tony was.
"Thank you," the other smiled and took a sip of his coffee, regardless of the temperature. "It's great."
Tony sighed. “You know, Steve, my whole life has been very lonely. I was always very careful that no one noticed, so that what people knew about me was the image of the carefree billionaire playboy, who, after a moment of clarity, decided to use his spare time and money to be a superhero, inside a shining armor.”
"Is it okay if I stand here watching you?"
“Boyfriend.”
"Great," Tony put his glasses back on and prepared to get out of the car.
“Very well. Do what you do best.” He looked ahead and could see sharply the portal opened by Ares, which was not yet visible. “Ares and Cerberus must be on the ground,” he said to Thor and Wanda, who agreed.
“Vision copying, Captain.”
"Steve..." Tony started, not wanting to finish. "Your coffee will get cold.”
Steve took a deep breath before putting his mouth on his and Tony was surprised for a second, amazed by the burning strength of his lips. Then his libido reached his brain and Tony tiptoed up, clasping his hand on Steve’s neck, returning the kiss with everything he had been holding inside him all that time, all the pain of having lost Steve, for never having the courage to say how much he loved him before, to have gone to war against the person he loved the most, to have hit rock bottom, to finally be able to surrender to Steve with all of his soul, and finally to feel Steve’s sweet and intoxicating taste on his tongue, which danced and explored alongside Steve’s, as if they already knew each other and needed to make up for all the lost time away from each other.
I hope you enjoy my Christmas gift for you this year!
"You're unbelievable," Steve said shaking his head.
Cerberus moved his three horrendous heads toward Steve and Wanda and his six eyes stared at Steve, hungry.
"What're you apologizing for?"
Tony snorted, taking the cup. “Damn super serum that took that joy from you.”
"Lucky for you, I'm always two steps ahead of you. I've already called a lawyer. He should be at your place in fifteen minutes. He's coming from New York just to answer your case."
Before they even landed, Tony had already retracted his armor and waited at the edge of the back ramp.
“No, my love. You can't come yet.” With one last stroke, Steve released both dicks. He held Tony's face in his hands, who was looking back at him without understanding why that pleasure had been denied. Steve smiled as lovingly as he could and kissed Tony deeply, who returned it willingly. When they pulled back to breathe, Steve was still smiling. “Breathe.” Tony took a deep breath. “Good. We’re in a hurry, I know, but I also want you to enjoy it. And I'll take care of everything to make it so. I'll take care of you.”
“I don’t know. How do you feel?”
The two of them reached the bedroom and stood at the doorframe.
Tony opened the button on Steve's pants and slowly lowered his zipper. He could already feel Steve's boner, fighting the fabric, but he held on.
At the police station, Tony handed the judge's signed papers to Rhodes and waited for his friend to pick up the most important boy in his life at the moment. If something happened, he didn't even want to imagine what Natasha would do to him. A few minutes later, Rhodes returned with Peter and Tony was sure he had never seen a boy looking so miserable. He was even more dejected than the day before, his shoulders slumped, with deep, dark circles under his eyes, his lips dry, his skin pale and sickly looking, which only made his puffy and red eyes stand out even more. Peter Rogers looked like a zombie.
Steve scanned the document and found nothing extraordinary, so he signed and passed the pen to Peter, who signed it next to Steve's signature.
“Talk to me, Tony.” Steve’s voice was low, almost a whisper, and he looked Tony in the eye now.
vivid thoughts,
“What about now?” Tony asked.
"What did your wife die of?"
When did listening to Steve calling him my love become so natural and with the power to ignite Tony’s soul?
Suddenly, making his heart reach his mouth and return to its place, and almost dropping the mug, Tony felt an arm wrap around his waist and a mouth kiss the side of his head. “Good morning.”
"If there's anyone who can find him, it's you," Steve said.
“They're all right,” Stark said, heading toward the front of the aircraft and sitting down next to Steve. “If anything had gone wrong, you bet we'd already know.”
He glanced at Fury and nodded, pretending to pay attention.
Steve smiled. “I never knew who was who.”
“How much time do I still have?”
“You what?” Tony was impatient. Steve was there that day. And he never knew.
"Don’t thank me. It was your effort.”
“I do,” she said quickly. “I have nowhere else to go and I need help understanding how things work around here, even if everything looks very similar.”
He doesn’t want to fight.
Just over an hour later, Steve was serving two plates of succulent steaks and colored potatoes on the counter. He pushed one of the dishes and a glass of cold water into Tony's direction and pulled up a tall bench to sit beside him. Tony stuck a potato and let out a soft moan as he put it in his mouth.
"And that's how you like me."
“You watched it,” Tony said, hoping Steve didn’t know what he was talking about.
Tony opened and closed his mouth sometimes, unable to decide what to say. Finally, he said the most intelligent one: “What?”
"He never answered the comms," Wanda shrugged.
"No. And, as you said yourself, I must
“T'Challa asked their support in Wakanda for help on a reconnaissance mission outside the borders.” Steve shrugged.
“Shouldn’t we clean up?” Tony asked, not really wanting to know, because he was amazed at the discovery of how perfectly he fit the curve of Steve’s neck, as if that place had been made for him.
Tony undid Steve's helmet, pulled it off, and ran his fingers through the soldier's hair. Steve closed his eyes, enjoying the sensation.
Steve shrugged as he picked up the lube. “If you say so. I trust you.”
"Let's turn things over," Steve said. "Tony tried to hit missiles and it didn’t work..."
"Mr. Stark?" the woman Tony was talking to called. Tony turned. "The Chief is waiting for you," she pointed to the door to her left. Tony followed, and Steve went with him.
Rhodes rolled his eyes. "Can it be later?"
Tony took a deep breath.
And Tony Stark tore the New York sky, invisible to anyone who looked.
Steve chuckled loudly.
you, Steve. I can't explain. But let me help you. Let me prove that I'm worth the trust you said you have for me."
"I don't sing."
"Don’t worry," Tony dismissed him with a nod. "We don’t plan on talking much. It was a very tiring morning, so we’re gonna sleep back here.”
flower that Strange brought is a sex-pollen vector.” Tony tilted his hands, making the light reflect on the petals, that shone like jewels. “That son of bitch brought a sex-pollen flower to my Tower! And I was stupid enough to smell it. That's why I'm like ... like
Tony fought the urge to continue kissing Steve and walked away, panting.
"Nat, go with the quinjet," Steve said.
Slowly the girl smiled and that was the last straw. It was real. How could this be happening, Natasha didn’t know, but it was. Somehow, that girl had just smiled Steve Rogers' perfect, welcoming smile right there, just inches from her face. Natasha heard Sam gasp behind her. He had seen it, too.
Tony waited a few minutes in silence while Natasha typed when something came to mind. "Hey, can you still, you know, multitask?"
Happy snorted, but said nothing else for the rest of the ride.
Looking back, with different lenses, maybe that wasn’t the first time. And,
But everything had changed.
didn’t know that.” Steve looked Tony in the eye and raised an eyebrow. You didn’t have to be an out-of-memory billionaire genius to understand what that meant. Tony’s heart raced.
Steve nodded, proving that Tony’s luck never lasted long. “It was the first thing they gave me to watch when I asked about you when I got back. Natasha told me that I should see it before I tried to talk to you in person. And you know you don’t deny a request from the Black Widow.” Steve smiled conspiratorially. “It was one of the reasons why I dropped everything and went to help you when I knew you needed me. If everything you said was true, if it wasn’t worth it, then we could fix everything, right?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know. And knowing how much you know me takes my breath away, because nobody else knows me like you. Maybe not even myself.” Tony looked at New York framed by the huge window, the sun was almost overhead, and sighed. “You know, looking outside, waking up here with you this morning, it made me realize with more force than ever that, as much as I want to, there is no escape from the horrible things I did, the lies I told, the people I manipulated. And I can’t even recover everything I lost,” Tony sighed heavily, but kept looking at the light outside, letting it come in, illuminating every corner that was still in darkness. “But I also realized how right what we did here is. And that I’m having a chance to recover something that I missed. Only one, but the most important,” Tony looked back into Steve’s eyes, shining, focused on Tony, looking forward to what would come next. Tony held Steve’s face in his hands. “You, Steve. Because I finally realized that, all this time, I just needed you.”
"How can you handle him?"
“What do you mean?”
“You said the pollen makes us need the one we desire the most, right? Well,” Steve bit Tony's earlobe. “Lucky me the person I desire the most is already in my arms.”
“Tell me something not strange about this team, Bruce.” Tony smiled at his friend.
"Hi," he said softly, his voice heavy with sleep.
"Now go back to your room and get some rest."
“How?” Steve asked quietly.
"If he doesn't know, Peter doesn't know either, right?"
are, they'll come running, and they'll surround you with those microphones. They'll bombard you with questions and it'll be deafening," Tony checked the contents of his briefcase and put it on his lap. "The most important thing here is: don't answer any questions they ask, understand? It'll be extremely tempting, because you'll want to tell all of them that your son is innocent."
"Then start, Clint," she said.
of the War. Maybe
Tony felt sweat running down his back. “Hmmm, hypothetically, if the effects on just one person had lasted just one day, a few hours, what would that mean?”
“For God’s sake, Steve!” Tony screamed with a racing heart. “You scared me.”
And, much to Tony's surprise, Steve Rogers, the bastard, smiled. "I'm not uncomfortable, Tony. It just caught me off guard," he started to arrange the vegetables in the pan - eggplant, zucchini, peppers, tomatoes, eggplant, zucchini, peppers, tomatoes. "I just didn't remember what it felt like anymore."
"What do you want from me, Tony?" Rhodes crossed his fingers on the table and stared at Tony. He was very different from when them studied together at the Law School at Harvard. They continued to defend people when they finished college, but Tony became a lawyer and Rhodes a detective. Who would say that'd be the turning of events.
“And that's exactly what happened,” Natasha snorted.
"Does Steve know?"
Steve gasped in Tony's mouth, sending a boost right to Tony's cock, hard enough now.
The quinjet landed in the Avengers Tower hangar a few hours after leaving the A.I.M. base in Alaska, and despite the Hulk's angry grunts toward Hawkeye because of the lost pickles, it was a silent trip with Steve and Natasha piloting and the others sitting around the holographic table.
Tony thought a little, visualizing everything he had asked to bring to the island, but couldn’t make up his mind. Steve was really good at cooking everything. He kissed Steve's cheek, stepped off of the bed, picked up the tray on the way, and walked to the bedroom door.
As soon as the quinjet landed, Tony was the first to leave, heading straight to the lab without speaking to anyone. The rest of the team split: Clint, Hulk, and Natasha went to their rooms and Steve, Peter, and Sam went into the kitchen.
"By the way, what do you have to tell me about Steve's birthday party?"
are the one who’s stuck in the past, preventing yourself from moving forward because you can’t remember what happened, punishing yourself for an unprecedented sacrifice that you were able to make to protect your friends,” Steve released one hand from Tony to hold his face. “And I’m here, telling you that I was stuck in my space-time, reliving the past that I’ve always missed, the past that I’ve always longed to have back, but that I realized that my place, that my home, it’s here, with you, in the present. It’s me now who’s telling you to live in the moment and allow yourself to move on. Let’s build new memories, my love,” Steve smile was beautiful and wide, his eyes shining with anticipation.
Steve looked at the set table and his expression was funny, a mix of astonishment, surprise and admiration. "I wasn't going to come down, to tell you the truth," he made a face, which ended with a smile, apologizing. "But I smelled it. So I came to see what it was."
Ignoring Fury's talk about A.I.M., Tony opened the secret communication channel and found a message:
"For what?" Steve asked, not understanding.
"I did," Tony took a quick look at the graffiti Steve was finishing cleaning when he and Peter arrived. The ER letters were still visible. Tony blew out a heavy breath. "That's why I think you should go in. There's more where that came from. This is just the beginning," and seeing the panic in Peter's eyes, Tony moved closer, speaking quietly, as if they were being watched. "For this to end as soon as possible and for you to get back to your normal life, we need to move," Tony looked at Steve, who nodded.
“Thanks.” Tony said, swallowing.
“Tony, you
are my home, my safe haven. My best friend. You are the love of my life, Tony Stark. It’s with you that I want a new beginning that will last forever.”
remember?”
“It was Banner’s.” Natasha pointed her finger to somewhere behind her.
“Ok, Mr. Funny,” Steve said, out of breath. “Your turn.” He opened the buttons on Tony’s shirt, one by one, showing admirable self-control, Tony needed to admit, but letting all of Tony’s control fall to the floor along with his shirt as soon as Steve’s lips reached the curve of Tony’s neck and they followed from there with a trail of wet kisses towards the front of Tony’s body, with no intention of stopping anywhere near.
"What did you do then?"
“What's going on here?”
"Well, it looks like your friend couldn’t hold the freak out there," Wanda commented.
“I’ll never look anywhere else with you by my side.”
"Because I was expecting you to come," Steve pulled away, but kept his fingers interlaced with Tony's. "I was worried you wouldn’t be able to show up.”
"So they already know everything?"
“Yes, my love?”
"Not a bad idea, you know.” He turned in a closed curve and they entered the grounds of a house made of wood, not too large by Tony standards, with two stories and huge windows covered with white curtains. A little farther on, in the sand, two sun loungers next to a huge beach umbrella and the sea framing everything with its gradient shades of blue and green.
"There’s been a while, but it was a secret. No one else knows it exists. Well, nobody else
The moment that simple thought crossed Tony's mind, his body changed. The mere thought of having Steve around made everything look hotter, brighter, more urgent than before. He needed Steve there with him. He needed to see him, to know that he was close by. Tony had no idea what would happen to him when Steve was finally that close, but his body was so willing to find out.
"Pretty name." Steve walked away. "Seriously, go talk to her. Now let's finish our pasta.”
Steve was now using only his fingertips to stroke the exposed skin of Tony's leg and that was sending impulses straight to his crotch.
Steve smiled beautifully. “You loved me back.”
Our favorite lawyer is beginning to unravel the mysteries behind the murder and to understand why Peter is, in fact, innocent.
I'll help you. What do you need?"
"Please, Tony, who do you think we are?"
Steve knew that was a low blow, but it was the last straw to break through all the barriers that this beautiful girl still had.
“How d’you know?”
Tony whistled.
"It's not our fault if you didn’t want to see the obvious," Fury shrugged. "My point is, I don’t care about your relationship, okay? As long as it doesn’t disturb your work and my life.”
“You’re thinking too loud, Tony.” Steve smiled warmly and ran his finger between Tony’s eyes, undoing a frown of concern that Tony hadn’t even realized had formed. “You’re worrying about things that don’t need a formula or preparation in advance. You don’t have to be the futurist now. Let things happen, Shellhead.” Steve grinned. “Remember what I told you yesterday?”
Tony smiled back and it was glorious to see how genuine that smile was, reaching his eyes, making them shine and wrinkle at the sides. Steve’s heart was filled with affection and a need above all others to defend Tony from anything that could harm him and get that smile off his face. He was even more beautiful when he smiled like that. And Steve decided that he would make Tony smile like that every day, because that was what Tony deserved. Steve would make him happy and loved.
“Yes, it is. Pierre is taking you there.”
"Fury scheduled a meeting with us tomorrow at the Tower," Steve said.
“What kind of favor?” Natasha spoke for the first time, and now she seemed slightly interested. Tony couldn't blame her, after all, it wasn't every day that the all-powerful Sorcerer Supreme came to their house to ask for a favor.
The typing stopped and Tony cringed, waiting for the blow. Instead, he heard a resigned sigh. "Not everything."
Oh, my God, Steve. This is wonderful! Where did you learn that? Your hands ... AH! Harder!
“I don't know how you can be so controlled. I’m boiling.”
the day before, damn it. Why couldn’t I call you?” Tony laughed bitterly. “Pepper called Rhodes and Maria Hill and they gave a summary as detailed as possible of everything that had happened. Honestly, I don’t know what shocked and hurt me the most, knowing that we had fought over something as stupid as a law - I kept wondering why we hadn’t sat down to talk and solve it - and how was it possible for you to be dead. I had never, in any of my predictions, seen you dying. Never. That had never been a possible scenario. And there it was,” Tony spread his arms, pointing at Steve, as if to prove his point. “The stuffing of the story I got by myself, watching countless security videos, reading my own files, and asking Reed a few other things,” Tony took the last sip of his coffee, placed the cup delicately on the kitchen island and looked at Steve. “There. Now you know what happened to me while you were gone.”
"Let's smash some monsters," Hulk said with a laugh as he left the room.
“Wandering in my own space-time. I spent all that time reliving the most important moments of my life. Each of them.” Steve made a sad face.
“Has anyone else survived?”
"Yeah, this is all in the file that Ross gave me," Tony said. "But I need a favor."
Tony laughed. “You’re crazy, Steve Rogers.”
“You scan all of us, don’t you?”
Steve shrugged. “You’re the one to blame here, babe. It was you who brought me back to the bed and held me here.”
Tony sat on the high bench that Steve indicated was his place and Steve sat across from him on the other side of the island after placing some cookies between the cups. They were both silent for what seemed like eternity, and all Tony could do was face Steve openly, without any shame.
The family is finally reunited. But will everything be as perfect as it should be?
Thanks to you who came until here, to you who read the whole story, to you who started now. Thank you for the kudos, the comments, the support and for being such incredible people.
Little did Steve know that his advice wasn’t only for a confused teenage Avenger, but also for a founding member of the Avengers who, by a happy chance, overheard all the conversation sitting in his lab, and now he had, not only the answers he needed, but also many other questions.
Out of breath, Natasha forced herself to get her voice out.
"Were you paying attention?" Tony asked, surprised.
“What's it?” Tony had lost all good humor. “Haven't you ever seen a couple in love before? This here” he pointed to himself in Steve's lap “shocks you? If the answer is yes, you don’t even have to waste your time hanging around.”
Tony laughed, drank some of his coffee, and looked at Steve through the reflection in the window. “I need a shower.” He tilted his neck back to try to see Steve's face, who was looking down at him with a sly smile. “Actually, we need a shower. You promised me one when we woke up. Well, we’re awake.”
Tony smiled back, because he trusted Steve. He
Unconsciously, Steve slammed on the brakes, right in the middle of the street, and stared at the reporters, his heart pounding inside his chest, the ice expanding into his arms and legs, his mind emptying out completely, not at all thinking coherently, his lungs not expanding enough to accommodate the air that was trying to get in. Panic attack.
Steve sighed. “Before you go, I wanted to say one more thing.”
Tony ran a hand through his hair in frustration. “We could’ve solved all of our problems with a simple conversation.
"Rhodey, don't pretend to be the idiot you're not. It's not a role you know how to play," Tony patted Rhodes sympathetically on the arm. "We need to talk out of here."
“But he managed to stabilize the variables in that reactor,” Tony thought aloud.
is trying that right now. Remember the habeas corpus I talked about before? So. She's preparing everything from New York, but we need more details, which we'll only get when we talk to the Chief."
induced to say or do
“Do you trust me?” Steve asked.
“But I do. And they will end up knowing it, too,” Steve took another step. “But the most important thing is that when I look at you, I see the dream that I never knew I had until it was you. I see my world gain a new sky that has the exact shade of blue of your eyes. When I look at you, Tony, I see my best friend, the person I trust the most, with whom I don’t need to be Captain America. With you I can be just Steve Rogers, and I know that you will believe me when I say I’m bad or you will pretend to believe that I’m fine simply if that’s what I need at that moment, because you know me better than anyone, but you will still stay.” Steve took another step. If he gave one more, he would reach Tony. “You were the only one who came to see if I was okay, even though you hide yourself. Everyone just believed it when I said I was fine, no one saw it behind the lie. Nobody bothered to return. Except you.”
Steve bit Tony's earlobe and that was enough. With a cry of pure pleasure, Tony came like never before in Steve's hand. He felt all the tension come out of him along with the white jets, leaving behind only pleasure, love, and an immense willingness to leave Steve's legs as shaky as his were at that moment.
"Don’t tell me it should be a holiday. Someone's had this idea before you," Steve smirked and turned to start washing dishes.
“I wanted to surprise you.”
“What do you mean, ‘there’”? Clint asked. “How do we get down there?”
"Thank you, Nat," Tony said sincerely. "You're amazing.”
Fireworks of every color and shape illuminated the sky outside the Tower, enchanting everyone, who rushed to the windows to admire the spectacle.
"Strange? Unusual? Unorthodox? A little unethical?" Tony cringed a little at each thought. "Yes, I know, Rhodes. I know. But you weren't there when he offered. You weren't swept away by his adorable smile. I took the whole hit alone and couldn't handle it. So now I'm the Rogers' newest guest."
“Oh, yeah? So you mean Captain America
Tony sat on the bed and rubbed his eyes.
"How about steak with potatoes?" He suggested, his mouth filling with water imagining the taste of the dish.
“Ah, I say so, yes,” Tony said and, with the hand that had the lube, he held his own erection and stroked himself a few times, putting a little show to Steve, who watched him, mesmerized. Tony groaned loudly.
Another sigh, this time irritated. "
"And she's extremely efficient at obeying Tony's orders whenever she wants," Natasha observed.
“What are you talking about?” Tony took another step toward her.
Tony smiled. “We’re really going to do this, aren’t we?”
The soldier shook his head and went to the refrigerator to get a bottle of water.
Steve snuggled up on the pillows and leaned on his elbows to watch Tony slowly crawl over his body, all the while staring at the soldier's eyes until he stopped his face a few inches from Steve's and breathed the same air. Tony leaned over and bit Steve's lip, who smiled.
“I'll be waiting.”
They had gone on a mission that day, because an average villain with a mania for greatness with a megaphone – yes, a megaphone - was in the middle of Central Park announcing that he would take the city for himself. It would be an easy task, that any policeman passing by would be able to handle it, if it weren't for the robots filled with expensive and advanced technology that the little villain brought with him to convince New Yorkers. So, they called the Avengers.
"There's not gonna be a party."
At that moment, the car stopped and they pulled away. They were outside a large shed with huge gates open, and inside, a small white and red jet was already with the turbines on and the ladder lowered.
Just for a moment.
"I still can’t believe you won today," Steve said after a few seconds.
"I think Captain Rogers will like to see you at any moment, boss."
“Curious, darling?”
“Very well. Let's start without him. Friday?”
"Spider-Man lacking courage?"
"Wanda and I are on the corner of the UN building.”
Steve didn’t like his birthday and Tony respected that. However, Tony also liked to make the soldier smile, make him happy. And he already knew how.
They turned to the officiant, who had a funny expression on his face, as if he was holding himself back from crying, too. "Anthony Edward Stark, do you take Steven Grant Rogers as your husband?"
“Please, spare me from the intimate details.” Strange looked away, embarrassed, but then pulled himself together and looked at Tony. “Do you
Natasha was about to start the next round when Tony's cell phone vibrated in his pocket. He picked up the phone and saw Happy's photo on the display.
"Very well," Tony put the document in his briefcase and placed the file that Chief Ross had given him on the table. "While you were talking, I sent the details of this here to my office, and my associate is trying to contact a judge here in Boston to get you out of here today," he looked at Peter, who was paying attention to every detail. "As I already explained to your father, unfortunately I cannot promise that we will actually take you home today. It all depends on the judge accepting our release request. However," he looked at Steve and Steve didn't like what he saw in Tony's face. "With the appearance of your DNA at the crime scene, the police already consider the case to be solved."
Steve looked Tony in the eye. “But I want to. As Jarvis said, I asked for it.” Carefully, he grabbed Tony’s ankle and gently slid his hand down to his calf, where the dislocation was. A shiver ran through Tony’s body and it had nothing to do with the pain of the dislocation. Steve was there, taking care of him, because he wanted to be there. Steve was touching him, with care, attention and affection, as if Tony was going to break. Tony watched Steve’s movements carefully, felt each touch, each care of Steve while bandaging his leg, and finishing the last touches of the dressing. Finally, when there was no way to avoid it, they looked at each other.
“Everyone copying?” He asked.
"Hold on," Bucky warned from the front of the quinjet. “We're landing.”
“No.” Tony shook his head, unhappy with his own carelessness. “I came because I wanted to.”
“Captain Rogers insisted on doing this task, sir.” Jarvis supplied.
Before Tony could say anything, the Tower's alarm began to ring and they both rushed toward the elevator.
“What about now?” Tony asked.
Or maybe it was when Tony first got news from Steve in months and learned that he, Sam and Natasha were working underground and desperately wanted to use the flip phone that Steve had sent in the mail and ask the soldier to come home.
Steve laughed. “Who would know, right?”
” Tony was afraid his words wouldn’t come out loud enough, but he knew Steve would listen to them. Blessed be the improved hearing. “I’m sorry.” Tony turned and found himself at the entrance to the room he had entered in ... a lifetime ago. He slowed down enough to take a last look around, the room all framed by the intense moonlight that came in through the huge window just in front of him, he saw the door leading to the roof, where the armor was waiting, and the practical part of his brain put the puzzle together.
"So, what will it be?" Steve asked with half his body hidden by the refrigerator door.
He needed Steve.
"Thank you, Cap.”
“Ask him to come here.”
” Tony gave a sad little smile. “In the middle of it all, we had your funeral and discovered a large-scale Skrull infiltration into Earth, being led by Spider-Woman who, we ended up discovering to be the Skrull Queen infiltrated long ago among us.”
Hi, everyone!
or not Tony would decide to come in to see and talk to Steve, but when. And Steve would wait, because that was what he did. Steve was waiting for Tony. It has always been like that.
“Everything under control,” Steve said. “The Hulk just threw the last of the agents through the entrance. What about there?”
Tony realized that his arms were still around Steve, protective and possessive, that Steve was underneath him and that he hugged him back tightly and that neither seemed to care that this scene was happening in the middle of the day in New York.
“Well, we hope everything went well in the Multiverse,” Tony said, evasively. “But we need to go now,
“I could draw it all, you know?” Steve kept talking. “This pale and dull night, with nothing exciting going on. I know that most people would find this night boring. Apathetic.” Steve lowered his head and his gaze locked directly across the street, on the roof of the building opposite, the one with the chimney, right where Tony was trying to hide in the shadows. The display, was still with the zoom on Steve’s eyes before Tony could adjust his lenses and the view was breathtaking. Two blue circles, bright and alive, staring at him, seeing inside Tony, reading his thoughts, knowing his location, knowing his fear. Those eyes knew the way to Tony’s soul. They always knew, long before everything fell apart. They knew how to read every bit of Tony, every half-hearted smile, every half-truth, every joke made because he felt uncomfortable, every sincere conversation, every feeling. Well, maybe not all of them. Tony may have been able to hide a feeling, keep just a little bit of his own self to himself, a piece that Steve never managed to reach. And maybe that way was better for everyone. Especially for them. Steve blinked and Tony adjusted the lenses, framing his face again. Steve had one side of his mouth slightly pulled up, almost a smile, but still not sure if he could really let it out. “But most people are sleeping. So, what do they know about this night, am I right, Tony?”
how?"
"We'll miss you," Peter said with a smile.
"Dramatic, I?" Tony pretended to be offended, but he was amused by the nickname. "I'm just pointing out the facts.” He, Steve, and Natasha entered the quinjet, and Sam and Clint piloted the ship back to the Tower not far from there.
“Yeah, I think so,” was what he ended up saying.
Tony walked through a room, with the bed meticulously made, and went down a narrow corridor, until he came to a room that was lit and smelled of coffee: the kitchen, with the living room right next to it. Steve was behind the kitchen island, his back to Tony, preparing several things at the same time. On the island, two steaming cups of coffee placed on opposite sides, facing each other.
“Thank you, Friday. You and Tony did a great job, as always.”
“I’ll be there with you,” Tony said, opening a shy smile. “I always had hope that you’d come back. But I never thought you would be able to make me confess that I’d do anything for you, that I’d give my heart to you, even though I didn’t think I deserve your love back.”
Tony’s groans went up in pitch, then with a yelp, he collapsed just as his come splattered onto Steve’s chest and the lab’s floor. His body was spasming so much that Steve could totally feel his orgasm inside him. That was enough for Steve too. Tony had come on his cock. And that wasn’t a dream; that happened for real. He gave Tony a couple more thrusts, then blew his own load inside Tony with a strangled groan.
"Three hours and twenty-six minutes."
Liz shrugged and smiled sadly.
Tony opened his eyes wide, unable to believe that was the answer.
“How does it feel, my love?” Tony asked with a low and sexy voice.
“Are you alright?”
“Good afternoon, Mr. Stark. Let's start?”
Tony felt his face heat up. "So ... Well, I'm not in a hotel."
"We have pepperoni, extra cheese, bacon and mushrooms," Natasha said, already sitting on the floor behind the center table in the penthouse's living room. “Pepperoni are the top boxes.”
“Is it just go up?”
“It's your smile, Steve...” If it wasn’t the first, the smile would certainly be among the top of the list of things Tony loved most about Steve.
“Captain?” Natasha called.
“And you are
The opportunities were there, he was just afraid of the answers.
“I have a gift for you.”
thinking. Relax. I know you don’t enjoy your birthday. What do you think I am? An insensitive playboy?”
Steve held Tony in his arms for what seemed like forever, but Tony didn’t care. He was getting drunk on Steve’s scent, concentrated and potent, awakening Tony’s most incredible feelings of love - and possession, too. Steve loved him. Until the end. They were now each other’s, forever, to support, help, care for, to love. Tony tightened his arms around Steve’s waist.
Steve shrugged. “I had a lot of time to think while I relived those moments and after I came back. There’s no point in brooding over what happened, Tony. We learn from our mistakes. Let’s move on and keep an eye on each other so it doesn’t happen again.” Steve looked at his hand still opened in Tony’s direction. “You come with me? Shall we start over together? I want you so much with me.”
Tony sighed. He never realized that he really had a masochistic side, but apparently Steve had the power to awaken all of the dark and unexplored sides that Tony had. For the good and for the bad.
“Tony ...”
Tony thought.
Steve nodded and smiled at Tony. “Always, Shellhead.”
Tony thought.
"Are you counting?"
She ran her hands through her hair and smiled faintly.
"Captain Rogers is asking if everything is alright.”
“You must be extremely important for Strange to decide to ask for help.” Tony looked at the box, hands on his hips. “I can't deny that you’re very beautiful though.” He crouched down again, and stroked the lid of the box, touching the embossed runes, until his fingers reached the latch that kept the box closed. Tony was overcome with an urgent need to know what was inside. It wasn't a simple curiosity, it was a deep, almost painful desire.
, blessed be the French for that useful expression, when Steve pushed deep. All his life, Tony felt chained. Now, feeling Steve’s hands on him, all over his body, taking care of him, loving him,
"Elixir of the gods," he said into the darkness.
Tony shrugged mentally.
Tony thought somewhere in his mind, moaning loudly when their tongues met. A shiver of pure pleasure ran through Tony's body as he heard Steve moaning too, the vibration coming from the back of his throat. It was more than he'd dreamed, more than he'd expected all along, but at the same time it was all he ever wanted. Steve's taste was intoxicating, inviting, sensual and
“Together, huh?” Tony said without thinking.
"I have no idea, Captain," Thor shrugged. "But I have fought this horrible monster with Hercules a few times in glorious battles.”
"Hello, baby," Tony said cheekily, and Steve let out a breath that he hadn’t even realized he was holding. He smiled. There he was.
“Very well,” Tony said, settling on Steve’s lap, so that his legs wouldn’t go numb, he took a deep breath and let his hands slide from Steve’s face to his chest and rest there. “And we just postponed our bath, is that what I’m seeing here?” Tony pretended disapproval.
Steve looked at him with a pained look. “I said I should have stayed there with you.”
Tony frowned.
If it were possible, Tony's heart would already have come out of his chest so fast it was beating and Tony had lost track of everything around. He just felt Steve's body glued to his, Steve's hands trailing behind his back possessively and Steve's mouth reaching into his ear once more to tear a groan out of him as Steve bit his ear lobe and smiled.
______________________________
~~~~~
Without saying anything, Tony sat down and started opening the button on Steve’s pants. “In a hurry, Stark?” Steve asked with a breathless laugh.
Liz frowned, worried.
Still, Tony didn’t know all those details because he watched the news broadcasting everything live, including his former friend being shot. No. He knows all the details because he watched the recordings of that day, from all the cameras available to him, from all angles, for several hours and days, exhaustively. Tony knew how to recite by heart the seconds in which each action had taken place. From everything he lost when his memory was erased, to prevent Norman Osborn from putting his disgusting hands on the records of the infamous Registration Act, which were, ironically, all in Tony’s brain, from every detail, of all the details, this piece, Steve's death because of that stupid fight, was what he made a point of re-recording.
"Friday, what time is it?"
Steve threw his arms up. “Really?
He started with the jawline and went down, until reaching the base of the neck.
“I’ll never look anywhere else with you by my side.”
Tony felt as if he were stuck in slow motion, his body taking one step at a time, approaching the target, arriving, interrupting the conversation politely and calling Steve to the middle of the dance floor.
Tony smiled.
"It's not a five-star hotel," Steve said, apologizing. "But it's comfortable, the kitchen is right next door and you can have your privacy," he shrugged. "Peter's friends usually sleep here when they come for the weekend," Steve had a wan smile, his eyes glassy, as if he were reliving a memory. But the moment passed and he quickly composed himself.
Since they had left Alaska, Steve hadn’t said anything else and that was making Tony uncomfortable. It wasn’t uncommon for the soldier to be silent, but something was happening, Tony could feel it, he just couldn’t know exactly what it was.
Especially now that the most surreal and incredible news, and an answer to Tony’s most secret prayers, had reached him. Steve Rogers was alive. He was back, walking between us. And Tony needed to see it for himself.
And, exactly thirty seconds later, the three of them landed with Clint.
I pretended I hated it, but I always loved the nickname, and he knew it,” She looked at Steve. “It was the last thing he said to me.”
They held each other for a few moments, but soon Tony's stomach came back to life, making him remember the tray of food forgotten on the bed.
on our Earth?”
are my home, my safe haven. My best friend. You are the love of my life, Tony Stark. It’s with you that I want a new beginning that will last forever.”
“Tony, what are you doing?” Steve asked again, looking at him in a panic, not understanding anything at all, but not letting go of Tony for a second.
"You don’t need a well-tailored suit to be handsome, Tony.”
“Tomorrow,” Steve replied in a voice that was far, almost asleep and content. “We can shower together.”
He slid his mouth from Steve's to catch his breath and came down the soldier's neck, kissing and getting drunk with the wonderful scent that only Steve had. When Tony was doing the reverse, returning to his mouth, he smiled and bit Steve's earlobe, making the soldier groan loudly and squeeze Tony's ass.
"You already knew the result would be that, didn’t you?" Steve asked after Peter had left.
“I don’t know what you're talking about.”
The house seemed to have come out of a catalog of planned furniture. Everything was planned to make the best use of space, to be functional, but still elegant. It was clear whom it belonged to. It would shout "Tony Stark" anywhere you looked.
"Exactly."
Tony ran for the ship and opened the transparent cover to press a few buttons on the panel and set it all before takeoff.
"Say whatever you want, to whoever you want, Robin Hood," Tony leaned back on the couch behind him and stretched his legs under the table reaching Steve, who was sitting on the other side. An almost imperceptible smile appeared in the corner of the soldier's mouth as he placed his hand on Tony's foot and began to stroke it, climbing up Tony's pants as far as the hand was able to reach and returning and doing again, without the others noticing. Tony's whole body shivered deliciously. "But all my wishes
With the party the night before, he had barely managed to rest. Not counting all those days with Tony away that made him extremely nervous and stressed, making him roam around the Tower like a zombie, fighting the urge to call Tony and say he was missing him.
“He's at MoMA.”
Tony was taken by surprise. “You heard?”
“You were prepared,” Tony observed with a smirk.
Steve thought for a moment.
"Good morning," he said cheerfully.
“To lose you again,” Tony found himself speaking quietly. “But this time I will remember everything.” He looked at Steve, took a deep breath and continued. It was now or never. “I’m afraid to accept that it’s no longer possible to separate our lives, because every time I try to move away, chaos sets in and I realize that I can’t imagine my life without you. I’m afraid to open my heart, as I’m doing now, and to give you my heart in the end, and confess that I’m in your hands. I tried to stay away, to forget, but the truth? Do you want the truth?” Steve nodded and Tony resigned himself. It was about time to stop the lies, to deny the evidence. Tony squeezed Steve’s hands. “The truth is, I am and I have always been crazy about you, Steve.” Tony realized that since he had arrived at the apartment, that was the first time he had said Steve’s name out loud. It tasted good, sweet and comfortable in Tony’s tongue, as if it were meant to be spoken by Tony all the time.
Steve blinked several times, returning to reality. He tried to smile, but he couldn't tell if it worked. "This is good, isn't it?"
Tony.
"What did he want here, anyway?" Bucky asked.
"The school had voluntary DNA samples from all students from the biology classes. The police started investigating where they believed they were less likely to find a killer, which was where the boy had more friends. They ended up, in fact, finding what they were looking for, I think."
"Ah, yes," Ross said. "Gentlemen, this is Detective James Rhodes. He is responsible for investigating the murder for which your son is being accused, Captain," Steve could hear the pride in the Chief's voice introducing his detective. It was disconcerting. "Detective, these are Captain Steve Rogers, Mr. Peter's father, and their lawyer, Mr. Tony Stark," Steve and Tony greeted the detective without speaking, just emotionless handshakes. "Detective Rhodes here is going to take you to Peter," Ross said. "See you later."
“What happened?” Tony asked.
"I'm ready," the android's mechanical voice sounded in the comms as he floated beside Natasha, heading toward the fountain. He would use his powers of intangibility to take care of any eventuality and provide cover for the others to approach.
"How can you be so sure?"
But the way Steve hugged him, the things they said to each other, the way their hearts were opened and exposed, completely vulnerable, the way the both left all their armor outside (literally and figuratively), and allowed themselves to be just them, that couldn’t have been in vain.
Steve blew out audibly. “Thank God, Tony. You worried me,” but he frowned. “But that doesn’t explain why you just remember things that happened over a year ago.”
"And how will I know what to pack?"
Tony looked at the red lily and something didn't match. What connexion could that flower have with him feeling worse than after fighting MODOK? Without worrying about anything else, Tony took the red lily out of the box and held it up to eye level.
“I missed your optimism,” Tony said. “But it’s easy for you to say. You died as a martyr. I was deposed as an outcast.”
“How can you tell?”
Steve ignored that the song was still playing and that Tony should finish it, and went up on stage, taking the microphone out of Tony's hands and looking deep into his eyes.
“They're all gonna welcome Liz Stark-Rogers,” Tony said with a huge smile.
"I didn’t even want to be here to begin with, but Dubai remains as beautiful as ever.”
“Do what you want with me. I'm all yours.”
"Steve, it's great," Tony said, putting the suitcase on the floor. "It's better than a five star room. It's your home. There's family in every corner of this place," Tony smiled. "I couldn't feel that warmth even in the best hotel in the world." Tony saw that Steve turned red, but he wouldn't rectify a word. It was all true. Everything in that house screamed love, affection, family. Things Tony didn't know what they were in a long time.
Tony reached out and took Steve by the shoulders, gentle but firmly. "Yes, he can. But we're doing everything we can to make sure that doesn't happen. Listen, Steve. You need to understand how much more the situation is than your son being in prison. He's under arrest being charged with murder. Do you understand how is that serious?
Tony's heart quickened. A weekend alone with Steve...
“Clearly. It will be a great opportunity to see how you get dressed in swimsuits.”
Steve rolled his eyes. “I don’t want to start fighting.”
And Tony was sure that it was real. Because he would never have dreamed of someone so perfect and who could love him as completely as Steve.
"Go on."
"Yes."
"The point is, I know what you're going through, I understand what it's like. And it doesn't matter to me if we've known each other for ten years, a month or a few hours ago. It's going to sound crazy, but I
was her plan,” he said.
“For me it's soap, clean clothes and you.” Tony took the red lily in his hands and put it back in the box. He locked his eyes on Steve's. “I smell you.”
Tony felt his face heat up. Apparently, his musings were too sharp, too easy to understand. “Sorry, I don’t ... You don’t have to talk about it, if you don’t want to.”
“Come on, Tony, let me help you,” Steve’s voice was impossibly kind when he pulled away, but continued to hold Tony by the arms.
“There,” he said in his hoarse, high voice.
to help me?”
because now you know too.”
"After my picture fades and darkness has
Tony frowned, not understanding why he would be mad at Steve, but nodded. “Okay.”
made by you in the last hour have paid off.”
I hope you're able to calmly breathe until there (because from here the anxiety is very difficult to handle!)
“Who knew that the Zuckerberg over there would have enough firepower to get us out of our house, right?” Tony commented sarcastically when he focused on the face of the terrorist of the day. A young man, no more than thirty years old, looking like someone who had left Silicon Valley and lost himself there.
First of all, thanks for all the kudos, comments and love. You are amazing!
“Tony,” Steve tried calling, but his voice was distant, low, artificially calm and composed. Distantly in his mind, Tony wanted to laugh, because Steve was so cute trying to look serious when it was clear he’d love to join Tony. “Tony, for God's sake, tell me what did that flower do to you so I can try to help huh?”
“You what?” Tony was impatient. Steve was there that day. And he never knew.
“But that doesn’t mean he needs to hear it
"I'll hang up now because I still have to read the contract."
"...and his education is much more important than invading A.I.M. bases," Tony interrupted.
But soon reality drifted through the gaps of that precious moment, and Tony found himself again in Steve’s apartment, still without part of his memory, still trying to understand what he was actually doing there, what Steve wanted with him, why they hadn’t started fighting yet. He blew out a heavy breath. He felt tired.
“Tony! Wake up!”
Tony took Steve’s cock out of his mouth with an obscene plop that gave Steve a shiver and looked at him through his lashes. “Come for me.”
Tony swallowed. He remembered everything, then. Well, Tony was never good at hoping. He was never the optimist. That role has always been Steve’s. Tony snorted.
I apologize for taking so long to post a new chapter, but life's been extremely complicated and busy. I must say that I felt as frustrated as Tony having to travel to Dubai.
Tony took a deep breath.
“But,” Steve continued.
"Mr. Stark," Steve called, getting up from the table. "I have no reason to question your work. If Natasha sent you, then I have even less reasons," Steve walked around the table and went over to Tony, who had also gotten up. "I trust you, Mr. Stark."
Steve took a deep breath before putting his mouth on his and Tony was surprised for a second, amazed by the burning strength of his lips. Then his libido reached his brain and Tony tiptoed up, clasping his hand on Steve’s neck, returning the kiss with everything he had been holding inside him all that time, all the pain of having lost Steve, for never having the courage to say how much he loved him before, to have gone to war against the person he loved the most, to have hit rock bottom, to finally be able to surrender to Steve with all of his soul, and finally to feel Steve’s sweet and intoxicating taste on his tongue, which danced and explored alongside Steve’s, as if they already knew each other and needed to make up for all the lost time away from each other.
They exchanged a glance before leaving the room. And nothing would pay the beautiful gleam in Tony's eyes, Steve was pretty sure of that.
of the War to get richer, and in the end, people still saw me as the good guy. I let you die with people believing you were a bad person. I chased our friends. I created the clone of a god. I haven’t done a single good thing since Stamford, at least people can tell me, but I can only feel
"Stop complaining, Katniss, or I'll send you back to District 12.”
"We both look great together." Steve hugged his husband around the waist.
