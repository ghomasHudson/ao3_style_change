“I performed a retinal scan,” JARVIS said primly. He paused, then added, “If my actions were in any way unacceptable, sir, you are entirely able to set new protocols.”
Tony shrugged, but his shoulders were so tight it probably looked weird, jerky not calm and casual.  “Yeah. Workshop’s calling.  Lots to do.”
Tony had made reservations at the ten most expensive, exclusive restaurants in New York one after another and cancelled all of them in the end.  Happy had the night off, so Tony drove them in the Bentley.  Usually Tony would just double park in front of the restaurant and assume they weren’t going to tow it before he finished with dinner-- his parking tickets had probably funded an entire highway by now--  but Steve frowned on that kind of thing, so he left their wheels in the parking complex a few blocks away.
“But I know what to do with naughty little sluts,” the Dom growled, “the kind who’re always desperate for a good, hard--”
“Just . . .” Pep was probably biting her lip. (Or, if she were extra anxious, her hair.) “You won’t tell your team, right? I know it’s silly, but it makes me feel like such a stereotype and a bad Domina to—“
“I was thinking of going in a few moments myself,” Harry said, pushing his glasses up on his nose. (The gesture reminded Tony powerfully of Bruce.)
Rogers held up a paper coffee cup and a little bag which read “Anonymous Donuts Ltd” in a retro-looking sans serif font.
Pepper had click-clacked her way to the exit when Tony blurted out, suddenly nervous, “You do know I love you, right?”
Steve let out a little huff against Tony’s neck and arched into him more obviously.  “That’s funny,” Steve whispered back. “I was dreaming that I seduced Iron Man.”
And for the first time Jackie had asked if he wanted to “do something about” the grey in his pubic hair--grey he hadn’t even noticed he had. Somehow going grey below the belt made him feel
(Shit! Why’d you ask about the guy he’s mourning, stupid?) Tony bit his lip, wondering if he should apologize. Change the subject? Suggest they go inside to join the others? (Shit.)
Rogers drew his shoulders back and lifted his chin very slightly.  “Mr. Stark hasn’t invited me to that familiarity,” Rogers answered primly.
celebrate his accomplishments in clean energy with his best friend (hush, Rhodey—you’re my best friend too…), when Agent showed up to interrupt.
Tony's eyes were aching, his mind rushing indecisively, lighting on one possibility then discarding it, trying not to look at War Machine, mangled in the corner. The desire to fix it
Tony pressed down a little harder, but not with the tip, not opening him up just pressing against him.
“Spoilers? What’s the fun in that, Cap?” Tony waved him off. “Shouldn’t we just hit it and see what you can figure out?”
Steve spoke softly: “I loved that book . . . We had so few. The library had taken it out of circulation and put it in the sale bin because the spine was cracked, but the pages were all pristine.” He smiled faintly. “It was a real hodge podge--lots of Shakespeare’s sonnets, Milton. Some American poets too. Dickenson. Whitman. I’d never heard of Donne before, but I liked those especially. It seemed like he wrote love letters for God and prayers to his submissive.”
“Lay off,” Tony hissed, trying to be quiet. At this rate, asshole was probably gonna leave a bruise on his arm.
Warnings: sexism, orientationism, and ableism, but if you've made it to chapter 30, I doubt that will surprise you in this world…
"I . . . I'd like to hear the details please," Steve said in a rough voice, looking between the two men. "You said there was more."
Tony wanted to take refuge in the calm stability of his workshop, but he couldn’t quite make himself leave yet. It felt unfinished. Whatever his other faults, Rogers listened. And that mattered. It mattered a lot. Tony took another sip of coffee. (Had he explained clearly enough? Did Rogers get it?) Tony bit his lip. (There were other things he needed to say too, Rogers' Knight in Shining Armor Act notwithstanding.) Tony remembered what he’d wanted to say last night, when he’d tied Rogers’ bow tie. (
wouldn’t be weirded out by Tony’s relationship with technology.  Tons of Doms seemed to be total luddites or wanted him to be, which made no sense.  Or, okay, maybe it did—gross Doms always want him helpless,
Rogers shook his head. “I assumed it was just a check-in like last time, but they scheduled it for two hours and said there would be a guest presentation, so apparently not.”
“Oh?” Tony perked up. “It’s funny you should mention that,” Tony said, though he knew it was no coincidence. “Stark Industries has been interested in expanding. Have you met our CEO? Pepper Potts?”
—those were all things to memorize, long lists of brand new names, blank of associations. But for him, it wasn’t just history, like it would be for an eighth grader, distant and remote. It had all happened in the blink of an eye while he slept and now here he was. The end of
Happy had gone to New Jersey to spend Thanksgiving with his folks, so the new guy, Francis, had volunteered to drive Tony over the holiday weekend. (Tony was famous for his generous holiday pay, after all.) Francis was a very slow, very cautious driver and, since he was still recovering from his hangover, Tony was grateful.
Rhodes looked at him blankly for a moment, then said in a flat voice, “The United States Postal Service was founded in 1775.”  Steve gazed back at him quizzically. (Huh?) “So I know they had the post back in your day. I’m not your errand boy, Rogers.”  (Maybe it was in his head, but it seemed like Rhodes put particular emphasis on the word
There was a tiny dagger on his nightstand. Tony smiled and threw back the covers. Ten minutes later, he was scrubbed, dressed, and on his way to the workshop where JARVIS had coffee ready and waiting.
Steve wasn’t sure why he was still thinking about the letter.  About getting in touch with Tony. After his disastrous attempt to see him upstate he should have been done.  Finished.
“Maybe they thought putting this crap out right after the press conference would give their B.S. a credibility boost?” Clint speculated.
Then, since actions often spoke louder than words in moments like these, Tony sank to his knees, bowed his head, and offered Steve his upturned palms.
“YIPPEE KI-YAY, MOTHERFUCKERS!!!”  Clint got four shots off mid-air.  The spiders let out mechanical shrieks as JARVIS cut their projections.  Tony dropped Clint on another perch, then turned back to the dragon.
The number “190” kept flashing through his head; he reminded himself there probably weren’t 190 people in a fifty mile radius up here.
“No, seriously, who makes these things?” Tony asked JARVIS angrily, steamrolling ahead before his AI could answer. “I don’t care who it is—Have Pepper find out and
Tony looked at him curiously. Steve glanced around the restaurant for a moment, before answering. “I used to work here.”
So sorry it took me so long to get this chapter to you and thank you so much for all your encouragement!  I found this chapter unexpectedly hard to write and I've been a bit under the weather lately....
Cap turned to the team. “The energy signature’s back—it’s hovering over Central Park. Everybody, suit up!”
“I think that your survival certainly qualifies,” Colbert says warmly. “And one Catholic to another, I’ve got to ask--who’s your patron saint?”
Steve loved running.  It was one of the best things about his new body—the ability to move so quickly and fluidly, never to struggle for breath like he used to.  It was miraculous and he had never quite lost his sense of wonder.  He hoped he never would.
“Please,” Tony begged, his heart pounding and his cock impossibly hard as he rutted against Steve, desperate for every part of them to be together. “
Tony’s heart was hammering in his chest; his palms started sweating. (Oh, fuck. Drowning, water, cold . . . cold . . .)
“And I can see not wanting a professional who’d be a stranger, but you could ask for advice from—“ (Tony was about to start suggesting names—Rhodey’s right at the top—but that would be weird, right? Right.) “—from a Dom you trust.”
“Oh! Right. Just, JARVIS mentioned you hadn’t eaten in a while, and I was making some sandwiches anyway, so . . .” Steve held out a plate of artfully arranged little sandwiches—tea sandwiches, he’d call them—with bits of tomato and bacon sticking out.
“Hello, sir. It is eleven-fifty two p.m. in New York,” JARVIS informed him, tone soft and reassuring.
“I’m really glad about Steve.  I am.  But . . .”  Pepper laid a hand gently on his arm, drawing his focus.  “What were you thanking me for?  You never did say.”
“Hey,” Tony said, putting a hint of teasing into his voice and a touch of playfulness into the little shake he gave Steve.  “What brought all that on anyway?”
Tony made another little circuit around him, then stopped face to face, reaching to cup Steve’s cheek and smile up at him.
“Pictograms?” Steve suggested. “They’re non-verbal, though I’m not sure it would do much without a common frame of reference.”
“Mmm-hmm,” Bruce murmured, walking to the other end of the console.  Tony frowned.  Bruce was really weird about the Captain.  It was annoying.  Tony held in a sigh.  (Just 'cause you rejected me doesn't mean you need to shove me at the nearest Dom.)
“And trust me,” he said, voice going low. He tightened his grip slightly on the back of Tony’s neck, nipped his earlobe, and whispered: “I really
“You’re still hard,” Tony murmured, sounding pleased. “You like kneeling for me, like being bound, don’t you?”  Steve nodded again.  “Tell me, Steve.  Tell me what you were thinking about.”
Steve was carefully folding up Tony’s ratty workshop blanket and arranging it against the back of the couch.
Not that Tony thought Rogers’d use the word “whore,” but still.  Rogers wouldn’t think of Tony the same way once he’d had him. Wouldn’t give him the same respect.  He might even think he could order Tony around whenever, wherever.
Steve’s hands stroked up Tony’s back, then down over his ass as he carefully lowered Tony’s trousers and silk boxers.  Tony was half-ashamed to realize he wasn’t fully hard, which couldn’t exactly escape Steve’s attention from that angle. (He couldn’t help it—he was nervous damnit and they hadn’t fooled around much yet. He was thirty-eight for Christ’s sake!  He didn’t quite spring up for it like he did in his twenties anymore . . .)  Steve ran his thumbs across Tony’s hipbones.
Things are rough for me in RL right now, so if you want to take a moment to tell me your favorite bit (or two or three...) it will be even more extra majorly appreciated than usual--and it usually makes my  day to begin with.  [If you want, you can read about RL here: http://ms-meredith-milton.tumblr.com/post/118061232911/sad-news-in-merediths-life]  Thanks to everyone who has sent kind words and support.
“I’d like that,” Tony said, leaning over to give Steve a kiss. He glanced around, then exclaimed, “Ooh! We should hang the blue Picasso right there!”
“I think I won that round, gentlemen,” she said quietly and slid down the rope to land gracefully on the floor.
? Just look at her!” Tony said, waving his hands dramatically. “She’ll purr at 155 on an open road. I was gonna give her 300 horsepower, but then technically she’d be illegal on public roads and I figured you’d frown on that; so she’s only got 250.” Steve whistled, low and impressed. Tony pointed to the engine and launched into an excited (if nervous) babble about shock absorption, LHT breaking technology, her turning radius and maneuverability.
Someone patted clumsily at Tony’s shoulder. He looked up to find Rhodey smiling awkwardly down at him.
Tony looked at him quizzically. Steve sighed. “They weren’t very keen on returning my property,” he said crossly. “It took a little coaxing.”
When he looked up, Tony found Steve gazing down at him with awe (as if Tony had personally invented both orgasms and blow jobs, just for Steve).  Tony licked his lips and dropped his head, embarrassed by the intensity of that look.
Keeping an eye on Steve and playing a bit of footsie was all that kept Tony from drifting off during the movie again; he knew every shot so well, he hardly had to watch it and could just savor Steve’s reactions, the feel of Steve’s knee against his cheek, Steve’s hand absently stroking his hair, his jaw, his neck.
(Thinking of another man—always nameless, faceless-- hand around his cock in the dark, coming with a rush of shame. . . . It’s sick!  You’re sick!  Don’t think about anyone you know—don’t insult their friendship. . .)
“I just—that isn’t normal, you know? People in the service, they swap stories. Good ones, bad ones.” Rhodey shook his head, then said more quietly, “Soldiers tell stories to each other, except when they
Mollified, Tony nodded. “Yeah, well. It happens. He’s an asshole, etc., but I had it under control. I was pissed because you charged in anyway and nearly caused us bad PR. Because, trust me, if that little incident had made it into the press, I’d be the one they made look bad and we—
“Harry! There you are. Oh, and Mr. Stark. Hello.” The elderly woman who approached looked startled to see Tony and glanced back and forth between him and Harry a few times. Tony nodded. She turned her attention back to Harry, saying, “Oh, Harry, you really do need to come talk to the Johnsons. They’ve been looking for you for quite a while.”
Steve opened his mouth and tried to concentrate on doing the same with his throat.  (Open and relax.  Relax your throat.)
first date for no good reason and hid in the bathroom. (Whatever—he’d peed! That meant it wasn’t hiding . . . yet.)
Cucina Paradiso it turned out was a few steps below street level, with small windows that looked up towards the sidewalk. It was modest real estate and Tony steeled himself for horrific checkered table clothes, candles in chianti bottles, and limp overcooked pasta. (Tony
“Tony?  Are you awake?”  (And, was there something eager and impatient about Steve’s voice, even whispering that quietly?)  Steve squirmed against him, fidgeting around in Tony’s arms. (Hel-lo and good morning, morning erections!)
Steve just smiled and reached for Tony’s hand. (Not what I’d been hoping for, but I’ll take it.) Waiting for the elevator, he pressed a gentle kiss to Tony’s forehead.
“Always so predictable,” Nat taunted with a grin, ducking under a Johnson punch.  “You shouldn’t recycle so many moves.”
“I wanna punch your lights out so bad right now,” the Captain said, his Brooklyn accent coming out thick like something from an old movie.
“So uh,” Tony began awkwardly, sitting next to Steve. “Uh, last night. When we talked about sex. And topping. Just, I know you said you’re inexperienced and worried about your strength—which is fine! really!—and I don’t mind waiting for you to be comfortable. But, well, I was wondering—is that all it is?”
Steve’s mouth twisted bitterly.  “They bet on who’d be able to get Tony down first—‘by whatever means necessary.’”
As the team served themselves little plates of star and tree shaped cookies, Clint nudged four rectangular packages out from under the tree with his foot.
“Captain Rogers says it is flexible,” JARVIS answered after a moment.  “A button down shirt would be acceptable; no need for a tie.”
The touch of thick, luxuriously soft rope made him smile as Steve laid the bight out on his right wrist. Tony was sure that if he looked up, Steve would be making that adorable face of furious concentration, but instead Tony closed his eyes and relaxed into it.
“Captain Rogers,” he said with a nod.  The War Machine armor was standing at attention in the corner.
Jake looked like he couldn’t decide if he should be annoyed on Steve’s behalf or amused by Tony’s teasing.  He raised an eyebrow.  “If you want arugula, you have to order the Rustica.”
“Uh, wow,” Tony said awkwardly.  “What the hell was that?  I’ve never seen you spar like that before.”
“Morning, babe,” Tony said. Steve turned and stood smiling at him, this warm intimate smile, just a little shy.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Tony reached up and unfastened the top button of his shirt.  He took a step to the left, unbuttoning the next button.  Little by little, Tony undid his shirt, pacing in a circle around Steve.  Then he slid the shirt off and tossed it aside.  He pulled off his tank top next, exposing the arc reactor and his beautiful chest and stomach.
“And I don’t think you’ve considered that a paramilitary presence is what would put us in danger!” Tony added.
“Sure,” Johnny said, looking bemused as he gave Clint his phone.  Clint cooed a little as he swiped through the pictures.
“Anyway,” Jackie said, doing something magical with his fingers. “There must be more gala gossip than that!”
“Since you are new to Persian cuisine, Captain,” Farhad said, “Ms. Ahmadi suggested that I might explain the dishes to you.”
“Mmmm-hmm,” Tony murmured and (because he’s terribly naughty) rolled his hips against Steve’s. Steve groaned and took his mouth in a deep kiss and—
Captain America, shield at the ready, was standing guard, and frowned at Tony’s approach.  “Mr. Stark? I really don’t think it’s safe to get too close to that thing.”
“We wait,” Steve answered her, sounding decisive. Then added, glancing over at Tony, “What I wouldn’t give for a Vulcan who could mind meld.”
Tony nodded and followed. In the elevator, he watched Steve start to fidget, stop, and fall into parade rest.
Tony strode into the common room at 7:43—(ha! just three minutes late!)—only to find it empty. He frowned and turned to examine his reflection in the mirror for any last minute adjustments. His hair was well styled, his goatee immaculate, and a masterful dab of concealer had obscured the worst of his dark circles (and nascent wrinkles). He
geared towards monogamy and a perfect 5 on the Kinsey Switch Scale.  If she were a Domme, the monogamy would have been fine with Tony.  If she were at all poly, subbing
“You’re gorgeous like that, baby,” Tony said roughly, giving another little thrust,  “with your mouth stretched around my cock.”
“Actually, forget this whole thing. I should just make him armor. I’m hella better at welding than I am at this needle-and-thread bullshit.”
“Okay, J! Start the coffee in the workshop,” Tony called. “Date’s at seven, so tell me to get ready at six. No! Five-thirty.” Tony licked his lips. “Yeah, five-thirty.”
Rogers was the first out of the SUV; he watched Tony’s landing and the reconfigurations with unconcealed awe.
Tony waved his screwdriver at the screen.  “Only if it’s someplace they serve real food.  None of your trendy raw, vegan crap.”
(Huh.)  Tony blinked and cocked his head. “Sorry-- so do you want me to yell at you?”  Tony shrugged.  “Okay, fine.  You’ve been a naughty,
In the elevator, he took off his sweatshirt and was relieved to find his temperature (and color) dropping to normal again. Another deep breath.
He hadn’t seen Steve since breakfast. Not that it was such a long time, but usually he’d drop by the workshop at some point. With a coffee. Or donuts. Or lunch.
Johnny nodded and, with a furtive glance over at Steve and Agent Dominick, took out his phone to pull up a photo.
Steve took a seat in a pew about half-way to the main altar and looked up at the stained glass windows.  The vibrant blues always made him think of Tony’s arc reactor. Steve took a deep breath and let it out as a sigh of relief—he’d come to the right place.
“Mmm-hmm,” Clint murmured and raised an eyebrow.  Tony narrowed his eyes, noticing the way that Steve fumbled to start serving chili, turning his back on the team so they couldn’t see his expression or, more likely, his blush.  (Damn.  Might need to lay some ground rules.  Like no teasing Steve about sex.  Or gay stuff.)
“—like a disgustingly conspicuous display of wealth? You bet.” Tony grimaced. “And they want their pound of flesh. It’s not really philanthropy for most of them; it’s networking or marketing or hunting for a nice rich Dom. Well, richer.” Tony shrugged. “But, whatever, I’m hardly one to judge. Stark Industries makes lots of important connections at these sorts of things. Pep will be there doing her CEO magic. It’s how things work.”
He couldn’t just walk up to Rogers with a casual, “Oh, hey, so apparently you thought you were gonna be a sub back in the old days. So, tell me, just how bad did things suck back then?”
“That sounds like subspace, sweetheart.”  (Sweetheart!)  Steve wanted to purr.  (Yeah, I really like that. . . )  “Lots of people who—” Tony paused, considering, “who like what you like have that kind of feeling.”
I’m honored, touched, thrilled, and frankly more than a little astonished by the overwhelmingly kind support I’ve received while writing this.  Thank you all for the tremendous kindness and encouragement.  It really means the world to me.
)  Tony rubbed soft, gentle little circles at Steve’s entrance once again, but still without giving him what he wanted, not pressing inside.
I've poked and fiddled with this flashback thing for a while and, at this point, it maybe should just be its own story, but well, here it is anyway.  There's Rhodey!  And Steve/Tony pre-slash...  Hope you like it!
“It’s a legal gray area.  Hence the lawyers.” Tony shrugged. “The real problem is that I’m already a PR disaster.  I don’t actually have to get whipped and fucked in a coatroom at a fundraiser for that story to show up in the press.”  Rogers had taken a sharp breath at the vulgarity and it was so predictable, Tony nearly grinned.  Instead he just made a dismissive gesture and added, “I can control my own actions; the press, not so much.”
“The thought of you on the subway with a custodial dolly is breaking my heart and making my cars sob.”
“Speaking of,” Clint said, “Can we get started? Let’s get started. I wanna put mini-me in the tree!”
“I’m still sorry I wasn’t there in 2005,” the Dom said with an apologetic smile, as if Tony had missed out. (The Dom’s teeth were unnaturally, synthetically white.) “My brother was there, though. Said you were magnificent.”
Tony shook his head. Cap had projects of his own, right? Maybe he was working on something and didn’t want to get out of the groove. Well, Tony knew what that was like. He’d ask Steve about it next time he saw him.
“Hey, Bruce!  Tell those morons to get it to the southside!  And bring the fucking XE generator.  We didn’t make the damn thing as a lawn ornament!”
Tony waved his hands in sharp angry gestures. “But, oh well, apparently all we’ve learned since 1969 is that subby boys are such useless sluts, it’s really all he could do to be helpful. Adams might as well have tattooed ‘only good for fucking’ on his forehead!”
And at that, the fight just seemed to bleed out of Rogers, leaving him exhausted. He slumped back against the punching bag for a moment, eyes closed, taking long deep breaths. Tony sat quietly.
“Hey,” Jake yelled again from behind the bar.  “You with the iphone.  Read the sign.  Put it way or get out of my bar.”
Anticipation was something Steve liked to savor.  He went to his little kitchenette and made an entire pot of lavender earl grey tea.  (A gift from Bruce.)  He fixed up a tray with his Stark Industries mug, milk & sugar, and a plate of chocolate digestive biscuits (a gift from Natasha).  He put the teapot under his tea cozy (a gift from Thor, who learned to knit from Jane), and carried the whole thing over to his favorite armchair, the one Tony hated.  (Clint had helped him rescue it from a curb in Brooklyn.)  Steve put a pencil behind his ear and grabbed his StarkTab, then settled in to read.
“You know,” he said, “Einstein’s definition of insanity was doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”
Beams of electric blue light surrounded the Rectangle of Creepiness, running up and down it.  Huh. They didn’t actually illuminate the damn thing— it clearly made photons go . . . wack. (To be technical about it.)
Steve flipped to the back of the book.  It had 391 pages.  He bit his lip—this might take a while to get through if he gave in to the temptation to take . . .
.”  Tony slid his fingers lightly down Steve’s crack. Steve struggled not to rock against the mattress or spread his legs.  (Don’t move.  Be good!)  He gave a sharp little nod.
Steve paused for a moment, then ticked the box for ‘curious’ under to “blindfolds.”  He added another note.
Steve was quiet on the ride home, one arm around Tony’s shoulders and one hand on his knee.  Their silver-haired cabbie was playing a Golden Oldies station, singing along badly and unselfconsciously, with a heavy accent from the Bronx. Tony laid his cheek against Steve’s massive chest and tried not to fret about what might (or, more like, might not) come next.
Tony smiled and let out a little purr of contentment.  It had been a long time since he'd done something so service-oriented for a Dom(me) or Switch, even just a friend.  It felt good.  He savored the little sounds Pepper made, basking in the knowledge that this pleased her.  (And safe in the knowledge she'd never hold moments like these over his head.)
Something about the way JARVIS said it, a subtle shift of inflection or a hint of a pause, reminded Tony that JARVIS was Steve’s friend too.
Rogers had a strange look on his face Tony couldn’t interpret. Tony propped up on his elbows and gave a little shrug.
Steve forced himself to unwind his wraps, slowly, methodically-- trying to let the familiar motions soothe him. He took a deep breath. The sound of Clint's punches resounded through the gym.
Steve was plowing through a giant omelet at the counter. At Tony’s approach, he looked up with a sheepish smile and mumbled around a mouthful, “Sorry--woke up hungry.”
Tony pressed his cheek against Steve’s neck.  “How’s that, babe?  You okay?”  Steve nodded and took another shuddering breath.
, aren’t we?  Even if some weird little part of me still hates you for hurting him while simultaneously feeling hideously grateful that you did, and, yeah, that really doesn’t make me feel so good . . .)  Pepper was still talking—something about ties and cell phones?—and digging in Tony’s closet again.
“Uh, Steve,” Tony said hesitantly, frowning. “I don't think I can--” He made a vague little gesture.
“Excuse me?” Tony nearly jumped at the sound of Captain America’s voice.  He’d totally forgotten the guy was hovering right there.  “Does this mean that you know what that thing is?”
Natasha reached out and picked up one of the tiny screws between her thumb and forefinger, examining it pensively as she added, “You have a bad habit, Tony.”  She set it back down very carefully and continued, “You idolize people. You actually believe that some people are perfect--  Pepper,  Steve.  But they’re not.  No one is.”
So, Tony and I may have gotten a bit carried away by our love of TOS Star Trek and Nichelle Nichols.  Please forgive us.  :-)
were size queens, but who got all in a huff about comparing dicks anyway?) Well. He doubted Steve would have any issues in that regard. (Mmmm…)
“Mmmm,” Steve sighed, sliding the covers back for Tony to slip into bed.  Steve pulled Tony close, making him little spoon, then nuzzled the back of Tony’s neck.  He wriggled closer so his whole body was flush with Tony’s.  Tony took Steve’s hand in his and pressed them to his chest, right above the arc reactor.
Disappointed, Steve nearly asked why.  Did Tony think he was upset?  Or hadn’t done well?  Or was Tony just moving to something else now?  Would he need his hands?  Steve bit his lip.
“There’s another chess board,” Natasha offered, looking up from her book. “I’m sure you could multitask.”
Suddenly high above them, there was a blood-curdling shriek, shrill and terrible. Two greenish grey creatures appeared at the mouth of the crackling portal. Tony couldn’t suppress a shudder, thankful that (in the suit) nobody could see it. The creature on the ground answered with a long, wavering screech.
“Hey!” Rhodey hollered.  “Stop with the mental engineering and talk to me, man.  You can do that once the suit gets here.”  Rhodey snapped his fingers in front of Tony’s face.
“Didn’t think you were,” Natasha said, with an unconcerned little shrug.  “But the associations are there all the same.”
treat you differently. Like a sub. Until you explained, anyway. You shouldn’t have to lie to protect my image.” Steve drew his shoulders back and added, “I can handle it.”
“Oh, yes,” Tony said, “By all means, let’s get on with it.  I know how SHIELD hates wasting people’s time with long, pointless meetings. So I’ll lay out the abridged essentials of our findings, dumbed down to layman’s terms and using small words for you.  Unless, of course, SHIELD would just accept a report—for maximum efficiency?”
Steve was dressed for his morning run and checking on something in the oven. At the sight of Tony, he smiled That Smile.
Her tears left no make-up streaks; she wasn’t wearing any. She looked oddly small hunched over in a threadbare Cal sweatshirt three sizes too big for her.
(Oh my God. Does me mean? Is it maybe--) Steve took a deep breath. It would be rude to leave their guest alone. (And I'd rather Rhodey didn't see me blushing. . .) Steve shook his head. The mysterious present wasn't going anywhere. With a little smile, he returned to the sunroom and took his seat.
Edited to add: I forgot to mention that the Sexology portion in this chapter is VERBATIM--the only emendations I made were to change man/woman to Dom/sub and to add the closing sentence to cap the section off.  He goes on at length.  Mind blowing, isn't it?
“It’s sort of beautiful, isn’t it?” Bruce said quietly at his elbow. It was just what Tony’d been thinking. He flipped the faceplate up and smiled.
Tony turned, heading back to the elevator, “Anyway, now you know where all the basics are, so I’ll let you settle in.  I’m going back to the lab.”
“That’s right,” Steve said approvingly. He gave Tony an intense look, eyes dark and hooded as he added, voice going rough, “And
Steve listened with amused interest, occasionally asking questions that made Rhodey laugh and Mrs. Rhodes smile, things like “But The Beatles and The Rolling Stones are both after Michael Jackson, right?”
Watching the movie and its fucked up little family that loved each other anyway, Tony couldn’t help feeling a little twist of sorrow or envy or something—he’d pined for a brother or sister as a child. Howard had always been a bit of a shit—“
The elevator opened silently and the deep rumble of Rhodey’s laughter immediately greeted him. Tony padded quietly down the hall then froze in shock at the sight before him.
It was nearly 1 am by the time Steve got back to Stark Tower and he realized that he’d been absently repeating the first verse of “O come, O come, Emmanuel” for the past fifteen blocks.  He couldn’t seem to remember the rest of the lyrics.
(Maybe . . . maybe . . . get, get him-- IT-- to hypersonic flow, then shield for the . . . the shock wave. And temperature spike. Shit. Wait. No.)
“Well,” Tony said, starting to walk away, “if it makes you feel any better, I don’t understand you either.”
After an hour of tinkering with Dummy in faithful attendance, the tension had eased somewhat from Tony’s shoulders. The Safehouse was fine. His teammates were fine. (Probably.) He doubted anyone had noticed his absence yet, brief as it was, but he’d hate to disappoint Rhodey or Pepper, so he hopped on the elevator.
“Yeah,” Tony breathed softly, lifting his hips so Steve could pull off his pajama bottoms.  Steve flung them on the floor, then quickly added his own pjs to the pile, before turning his attention back to Tony.
Tony felt the wind knocked out of him with every thrust; he was nearly dizzy with it-- panting, sweaty, out of breath, heat coiled tight between his thighs.
Steve nuzzled his neck and murmured: “Do you like that, sweetheart? Do you like it when I take your wrists?”
“Good,” Tony said, still rubbing teasing little circles lightly at Steve’s entrance.  “Deep breaths.  Relax.  Good . . . you’re so good. . .”
Little dots sprang into life and Steve held his breath. After a few moments, they vanished. Steve waited. And waited.
“Tony, darling,” Veronica said, taking his hand and leaning down to kiss him softly on each cheek. “I was hoping to see you here. We hardly got to say hello-goodbye at the last one.”
all this must be for Tony.  It didn’t seem like the sort of thing that could come effortlessly for anyone.
“Later, Pep,” Tony said, hopping off the couch and sauntering to the kitchen. Mrs. Rhodes was rolling out piecrusts, wearing a red-and-white-checkered apron she’d wisely brought from home.
Tony should really clean Steve up.  He paused, looking at his come on Steve’s body.  (Oh fuck!  Soon—soon, I’m gonna come all over you, paint you with it until you’re a gorgeous filthy mess for me. . .)  He felt a surge of lust—all of it in his mind, his body too wrung out to even consider stirring a fourth time in one night.
Steve was grateful when Tony nodded and relaxed just a little. Tony had never said anything about it, not directly, but Steve had noticed that in the pool, Tony never went under, never put his head in the water. In the shower, he kept his face out of the spray; he used a washcloth at the sink when he shaved.
Tony worked a hand under him, massaging and caressing his ass.  Steve tilted his hips up, eager for more, for Tony . . .
you. I don’t give a good goddamn about PR compared to your safety. What the hell do you think of me?”
“Well,” Rogers said, straightening.  “I should let you get back to work and go rejoin the others.  I bet Bruce is making them wait for me.”
“Would you like to say a few words, Tony?” Mrs. Rhodes asked as she took her seat. (He knew what she was
Steve gave the reporters his bashful act and they ate it up. (Well, it wasn’t really an act. More that he was ‘letting them see his bashful side.’ Steve was devastatingly sincere; it was, as Tony had long suspected, one of his superpowers.)
“Right.  Yeah,” Bruce said to the thick pile of Tony’s luxurious carpet. “I’ll just go.  Wait for you.  There.  In the lab. Yeah.”
Then he sat up a little and added with a wry smile, “I’ve done way more demanding stuff way more hungover. Their coding lessons still seem to be going well, but I think we need more tutors. Isaac and I have a meeting soon, so we’ll work it out.” Tony adjusted his cuffs, then added, “Gina asked me to bring the Avengers around.”
Tony sighed and rubbed his eyes, then dragged himself to the bathroom. As he brushed his teeth, Tony caught sight of his scowling face in the mirror. This really wasn’t the end he’d predicted for his evening. Tony splashed water on his face. Then again, his predictions about Steve had been off pretty often.
When Steve noticed Tony hovering in the doorway he abandoned the obstacle course to run over to Tony with a grin.
“Thanks,” Sasha said warmly, eyes sparkling. “My grandmother still thinks it’s a ‘phase’ and I’m really just a switch--” Sasha rolled his eyes-- “but mostly people have been great.”
Steve groaned. Tony savored his response, the sound of Steve’s labored breathing, the feel of the cock in his mouth, the taste of salty-bitter pre-cum.
“You’re so beautiful,” Steve repeated.  “I’ve always loved looking at you. Sometimes I had to remind myself not to stare, not to look too much.”  Steve’s voice went rough.  “But I can look at you now—like this—can’t I, sweetheart?”
“I’d be very pleased to help you,” Steve told him seriously, with the air of a promise. “But I don’t really know anything about—“ He waved a hand vaguely at Tony’s schematics.
Thanks so much to everyone for the amazing comments on the last chapter!  I'm so sorry I haven't responded to them individually, but I was really busy with RL and so eager to write and post this chapter for you instead that it never quite happened.  I hope you'll accept more story as an apology. :-)
—he liked the way Tony explained things--and Tony’d never gotten such heartfelt apologies from anyone, and one of them before Tony’d demanded it or even wanted it! And Rogers was just so
(Oh God.) Tony arched his back just a little. His heart was pounding and he could feel his cheeks heating up. Definitely blushing. Should he present his palms?  (Too forward.  Let him ask.) Or maybe--
“No, it’s fine. We’re going soon enough.” Bruce shook his head. “Besides, not much point flying there and back for the gala then back again for the big meeting with SHIELD.” He grimaced. “And I have a feeling they scheduled that to be
Fury began to clarify, “Captain, Stark isn't actually--” but Tony cut him off, sidling up to Rogers right into his space.
“Then what about that conversation made you think I needed you barging in and causing a scene?” Rogers was frowning, his stupid confused face, and something about it made Tony agonizingly frustrated.
“No,” she said, tone clipped as she stepped away from the bed. Her four-inch stilettos clicked against the linoleum. “You’re obsessing and it isn’t healthy.”
p.s. The bit about 'nobody wanting to take home the tomato everybody picked up an squeezed' is actually a quote from a morning TV show.  It appears in the 'dating advice' episode of Target Women here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TenP1GDh1w
(And he thought he’d been so efficient, finishing everyone’s suits in . . . however long he thought it had been. Well, fuck.)
’s what they offer.” Tony paused for a moment, then added: “I mean, other than all the agents who fought and died with us in New York. I suppose you remember them.”
“Okay! Happy things! Miranda and Rhodey!” Tony got shakily to his feet, glass raised high. “To bringing down Lang Inc! The liberationist coup! The Avengers!”
Tony fumbled his way towards the coffee pot and was grateful to find it full of the strong brew Steve favored.  He poured himself a mug and took a long sip before answering.
Really, they should sit down and have a mature, level-headed discussion-- the kind Pepper would approve of.  Yeah.  A nice, calm discussion about outdated notions of chivalry and their intrinsically orientationist assumptions.  Soon.  Before Tony snapped.
Tony drizzled oil down Steve’s crack and then his fingers slid more easily, slowly in then out, in then out, driving Steve half-mad with the need for more, harder, faster.
The place wreaked of scotch. And maybe vodka. And gin. Bottles were smashed on the floor, glittering blue in the light of Stark’s holo-screens.
“Wow. They have penne all'arrabbiata,” he told Tony. Tony laughed as Bruce launched into Eddie Izzard’s ‘Death Star Canteen’ routine and Clint joined in. Natasha watched with an indulgent smile.
Steve’s eyes went wide; he looked pretty appalled, really. (Oh. Okay. Apparently, he hadn’t heard twink or dyke used affectionately yet.)
Steve read it again.  He reached up for his pencil and then lightly underlined the last two sentences.
Tony felt like a complete idiot. How had he not realized that ages ago? It all made perfect sense. He’d assumed that in wartime a babe like Steve post-serum—a walking wet-dream—surely had gotten laid, but well . . . he was still Steve, right?
The old man humphed. “No, no you shouldn’t have.” He shook his head and added grudgingly, “But I guess it is a little rude to take a stranger’s picture without permission.” He gave a little shrug and continued, “And your heart was in the right place. Wanting those kids to have a nice Christmas.”
And somehow Tony didn’t think Rogers was just talking about the suit and— (Shit, shit, shit!  Don’t blush.  Fuck, don’t blush.)  Tony flipped the faceplate down.  Rogers looked startled.
Tony kept an eye out for the tiny number of people he actually liked while schmoozing his way through vague acquaintances and opponents.
So sorry for the long delay!  Steve was a struggle for me here and then I was struck down with the most miserable stomach bug...  If Tony gets hideously ill in a subsequent chapter, you'll know where my inspiration came from!
doing this together—nobody can tell us what to do.  But they can help us avoid making mistakes that might hurt us.  There’s no reason to reinvent the wheel here.   And it’s not really that different from the research you did for the spreadsheet, right?  That didn’t seem weird, did it?”
Tony pulled off his bow tie and dropped it on the floor. He looked at the chaotic mess of floating schematics; the gutted Stark Tabs, their chips and wires exposed; the soldering irons and wire strippers and--

Steve sank to his knees.  It felt good to kneel, to know he was doing what Tony had asked of him.  The thick carpet was soft under his knees.  It was warm in Tony’s room, warmer than usual, and Steve had a feeling that Tony had asked JARVIS to the heat up just for him.  Tony would take care of him.
“But if there weren’t something there,” Steve said, “if at least some part of you didn’t think that--”
Tony stroked his hair as he continued, “But I don’t want to make you uncomfortable or force you to verbalize things you aren’t ready to say out loud yet.”
“No way.  Gonna be great.  And we’ve got the Security Blanket for extra back-up! Not that we’ll need it. At least, I hope not.”
“They were still people!” Steve said, sounding angry. His body went tense. “Even SS Officers, even those horrible men running the Hydra camps.” He took a deep breath and looked away. “But those aren’t the only people I killed.”
Rogers turned and took two steps down the hall; Tom pressed back into the doorway and looked at his phone, schooling his features to distracted boredom.
“Ms. Potts! I'm so sorry!” Steve exclaimed, grabbing her elbow when she stumbled. Pepper's expression was pinched and somehow colder than usual. “Are you all right?”
Steve looked at him wide-eyed as Tony rushed on, “Oh, and I maybe gave some money to Magdalene House again. Because that’s always good, right? And we could go on a trip somewhere! Paris? The Bahamas? Really whatever you want. Normally, I’d just buy a Dom some expensive trinket--sort of like the ‘proof I dated Tony Stark’ luxury watch-- but I didn’t think that you’d actually
At that moment, another robot fired a repulsor stun and hit Hawkeye full in the chest, sending him flying.
“Oh, what, you think that’s your job now?” Clint barely managed not to sneer.  (Barely.  With exceptional force of will.)
Natasha chuckled as Bruce went to get the beautifully arranged tray of cookies and presented it to Steve.
“On and off,” Bruce said. “I saw reruns on TV occasionally, but didn’t watch all of it until college. Oh, hi, Tony,” Bruce said, turning toward the kitchen and catching sight of him. “You didn’t mention that you were getting pizza.”
And somebody should have told him what this movie was about!  Steve’s jaw dropped when Jack Lemmon started returning Osgood’s affections.  Golly.
Tony shrugged and wandered a little further into Steve’s apartment. It was unchanged since his last visit: no art, no brica-brac, no nothing. He hadn’t even rearranged the furniture. Except for a few things on the coffee table, it looked like the showroom of a furniture store.
“That’s it,” Tony said. Tony ran his hand down Steve’s spine, maintaining contact as he knelt behind him.
“Oh! Don’t let that stop you!” Tony said, waving emphatically with the bread knife. “They can always make room and Mrs. Rhodes loves company.”
(I want you to have a safeword because that means we’re really doing this.  It means I’m doing it right.)
Hope you enjoyed this longer-than-usual chapter!  Thanks for joining me!  And extra thanks to everyone who has said hello! Your thoughts and kind words are cherished.  :-)
. . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . ..  . . . . . . .
Tony leapt from his chair, tossed the tablet aside, and bounded over to the elevator, ready to pounce. (Shit!) He took a moment to check himself over in the mirror to make sure he was presentable. He ran his fingers through his hair and straightened the cuffs on his shirt.
, mouth quirked and one eyebrow raised. “Honey,” she said, the vowels drawn out. She shook her head.
“My hearing’s enhanced,” Rogers said, “I was wondering where you’d gone, so I listened for your voice. When I heard what you said, I came as quick as I could. Are you sure you’re all right?”
Tony was brimming with curiosity, but struggling to formulate a question, when Steve turned to him and said, “I bet you had a really swell cake and--” He’d begun smiling, but looked uncertain as he finished, “--a great party?” His voice trailed up, almost a question.
Steve laughed as Tony flopped back over to look at the TV and dragged Steve’s hand back onto his head. He obligingly resumed stroking Tony’s hair, then a moment later brought his other hand down to give Tony a proper massage, rubbing little circles at his temples then down his neck. Tony let out a long sigh.
Steve pushed him firmly back against the wall. Tony’s blood surged; a wave of heat sweep over him, leaving him nearly lightheaded. (
Steve reached up to touch Tony’s hair—it was still very slightly damp, freshly washed. Steve felt a twist of something (jealousy? envy?) to know that Pepper Potts was still able to bathe her ex-lover, that there was that much trust and tenderness between them.
Tony answered with something between a nod and a shrug.  He wasn’t sleepy exactly, but it was as good an answer as any.  Pepper caught his eye and furrowed her brow questioningly, but at Tony’s (probably dopey) answering smile her look softened.
Steve sighed. Of course, with Tony in the clutches of his engineering genius, Steve still hadn't managed to talk to him about Agent James. The guilt was simmering in the back of his mind and, the more he thought about it the more worries bubbled to the surface.
“Ok!” Tony said urgently, giving up the game, “we’d better get out of here before I pounce you on the dancefloor or drag you to the coatroom.  Do I have to beg?” Tony leaned up to whisper in Steve’s ear. “Please? Please, Steve. Take me home and ravish me.”
Fast as anything, Tony found himself pinned, Rogers’ legs holding his own immobile. He almost got a punch to Rogers’ chin with his free hand, but the angle was awkward and Cap was too fucking fast—he caught Tony’s other wrist in hand and pressed them both to the mat over his head. It brought their faces close together, but not close enough for Tony to try a head-butt.
“Would you kneel for me, Tony?” Steve asked. Tony complied with a little flutter in his chest; he shivered.
Tony searched back through his slightly clouded memory. He was pretty sure that Steve had been the one helping Rhodey put Tony to bed. And he was probably the one who left the water and ibuprofen too.
“Come on, sweetheart,” Steve said, pulling Tony off his stool. He pressed a kiss to Tony's forehead. “You look like shit and smell worse. Let's go, yeah?”
The guards pulled open the doors and Sir James announced in a resounding voice: “Prince Anthony Stark of Italia!”
When Pepper, who wouldn’t stop giving him these annoying little looks, saw Mallory across the club, Tony’d shooed her off to say ‘hi.’ Within moments, Tony had settled into one of the lavish corner booths, ordered a magnum of Dom, and was holding court over posers, gold-diggers, and the occasional sincere fan.
Tony woke abruptly, bladder full and overheated. Steve’s arm was slung around his waist, his warm body pressed to Tony’s back as he breathed deeply in sleep. It was very dark; Tony fumbled for his phone to check the time, then realized that he hadn’t brought it to the bed stand after their scene. It was just as well probably; he could already feel the itchy need to check Twitter and see how they’d been received, but he wasn’t actually looking forward to it. (What does CAPTAIN AMERICA want with a used up whore like STARK bla bla bla etc etc etc.) Tony sighed. Steve was gonna see red. And Tony still needed to pee.
Tyrone Macmillan smiled at his wife. “Of course, my dear.” He turned to Pepper and Tony. “Won’t you excuse me?”
“Anyway,” Steve said, looking down bashfully and lowering his voice, “I used to have this little daydream. My health’d get better, and I’d have a really good job—drawing comics and political cartoons. And there’d be this sub, see? Smart and witty. All fiery and independent, and, god, just so handsome! And I’d bring him here on a date, introduce him to Luca and Anna, and we’d have this amazing dinner and then I’d leave them the best tip ever, just loads. And after dinner, this sub—my special fella—he’d let me steal a kiss at the door.”
But if Captain America was going to break Agent Dom Dominick’s nose, Tom was damn well gonna see it. (And then deny ever seeing a thing.)
Tony downed three bottles of ice cold water from the mini-fridge and took a seat at his workbench, petting Dummy absently.  Hiding was a nasty word for what he was doing.  He was processing.  It was important.  And, like so many things, he did it best in his workshop.  Alone.
Steve leaned over and kissed Tony’s cheek, then rolled on his side and yawned, snuggling down into his pillow.  Tony stared at him, leaning against the headboard.
Steve had gone too far accidentally—it was a mistake lots of Dominants could make, especially as novices—but a Dom was unlikely to do any irreparable damage unless acting negligently and Tony couldn’t picture Steve like that. Then again, most Doms only had to adjust to a new body gradually at puberty, so maybe . . .)
Steve kissed Tony’s hip bone again, gave Tony’s balls a firm dizzying caress, and then licked a hot wet stripe up Tony’s cock.
“No, no! I’m ready. See?” Tony hurriedly took Bruce’s knight with his bishop. “Sorry. Was lost in an engineering puzzle.”
Steve made a pleased little sound and held him close, pressing his cheek to Tony’s head (and, yeah, his probably disgustingly filthy, sweaty mess of hair. Ew.).  Steve’s body was like a furnace—he just radiated warmth.
“Fine!  See if I try poetry on you again.  From now on, I’ll call you my little closed-loop controller.  Or start telling you that you’re the exponential stability to my marginal stability!”
to go through more portals, but . . .) “We have no idea what the conditions are beyond that portal nor how his appearance would be interpreted. For Iron Man to enter might be construed as an act of aggression; we should avoid the appearance of hostility at all costs.” (Oh. Well, that made sense.)
“Don’t get your hopes up, little guy.” Steve smiled at Dummy. “Never was all that talented and now I’m terribly rusty.”
Bruce shrugged, pushing his penne around on his plate. “I just hate these meetings. Every time we meet with SHIELD it puts me on edge, and the next one will be worse. We actually have to lay out our plan for training with . . . the Big Guy.”
—said his name, like he was testing it out or savoring it or actually felt honored or privileged or whatever the polite convention said he was supposed to feel.
insult me as you do it.  But, yeah, okay.  As punishment I’m not pulling my punches for you this time.”
“Did—“ Tony hesitated, “did you crash when you came down?  When you came out of that floating feeling?”
“It’s cold in New York! Besides, aren’t you happy to see me? I thought you could use a friend—you know, after Aunt Maggie and all.”
Tony couldn’t resist any longer—he dashed behind the fortification and launched himself at Steve, half-hug & half-attack, and sent them toppling into a snow bank.
“Now go kneel in the middle of the room,” Tony said softly.  Steve found himself wondering if he was allowed to stand up and whether or not he wanted to.  (Do I actually want to crawl?)  Mentally, he pushed that away as another question for another time, walked across the workshop and rearranged himself in the wide open space Tony used for large projects.
Tony wiped them off awkwardly with the sheet, then settled back against Steve.  He smiled and said in a teasing voice, “You know, it’s funny-- I don’t remember getting to bed last night.”
Tony swallowed heavily.  He didn’t want admit that he’d rather fear the worst than know it for sure.
was his mystery Christmas plan. (Absurd.) Tony laughed at himself. There was no way Steve could keep a secret that well.
(No—it was dumb to speculate.) Tony glared at his phone. (Why didn’t flower language have any conventions for syntax? It wasn’t a language without syntax—just a bunch of flexible bullshit symbols!)
When he arrived it was late (or, depending on one’s perspective, early) so he didn’t call Pep, he just headed straight for the workshop. He’d left a bunch of silly little side projects lying around and figured they’d make a good distraction. (Well, okay, a full color e-ink touch screen was far from silly, but it was hardly inter-dimensional defense, was it?) A break from Avengers engineering might be good though. Just for a little while.
if he wanted to, could fake and lie like nobody Steve had ever met.  Steve had fallen for his act before, fallen for it so easily when they first met.  (What if I’ve been falling for it again?)
Steve’s pace was sweet torture. He’d suck Tony a while, soft and slow, then pull off his dick to smile up at him. Kiss his thighs, his hips. Nose at his balls and the sensitive spot behind them. Then back to sucking cock with a lazy pleasure Tony had never seen in a Dom before. Then, he’d draw away again, leaving Tony gasping and whining.
“With all due respect, Captain,” Agent Dominick said, implying just the opposite.  “I don’t think you’ve considered the wellbeing of your more vulnerable teammates.”
Tony spun the glowing schematic for him.  Bruce opened his mouth, brow creased, as though preparing to say something momentous, but instead he just shook his head and got out his reading glasses.
Since that's only Part I and short, I'm hoping to follow swiftly with Part II.  Think of this as the appetizer--main dish to come.  Hopefully quickly--wish me luck!
“JARVIS?” Tony said, heart hammering in his chest and palms going a little sweaty. He forced the words out, “Would you ask Steve if he’d please join me in the penthouse for a cup of coffee?”
Natasha was frowning very slightly as she brought the rest of dishes to the sink. (Doesn’t she approve?)
Also, now there's an out-take!  What *did* Steve and Clint talk about in the elevator?  Read it here!
“Yeah.” Tony nodded. “It was especially bad after his first tour abroad; he was afraid to sleep. Still gets them sometimes.”
Rhodey’s phone chirped and he laughed. “Lousy fucking timing,” he said, shaking his head and showing Tony his phone.
Tony was giving him this stricken look, but it wasn’t pity, not really.  More like he was imagining it.  Imagining his friend, his own Rhodey, dead and gone and how it would hurt, and for a moment he understood just a little.
He’d had no idea.  How stressful, how exhausting it must be! How could Tony possibly want to do all that work?  Steve shook his head.  He felt so stupid.  Of course, on some level Steve had realized that giving up control actually meant giving it
Tony lifted the lid—heaven in a box.  Double sausage, extra cheese, and olives.  Sombody’d ordered his favorites.  Tony piled three slices up on his plate and was considering a fourth when Rogers approached him with a frown.
Tony swallowed, his mind racing back over his contract as Steve rummaged through his little black bag. (Restraints? Paddle? Crop? Clamps?) Tony couldn’t really picture Steve going higher up the scale than that on a random afternoon, but Steve had surprised him before.
“About what you said earlier,” Tony said, hesitating to raise the subject again. “About me--billionaire, philanthropist--you know that isn’t special either, right?”
—to hear that the only sub under consideration didn’t make the cut.”  He gave Romanov a deadly look and hissed, “You know, after a totally unbiased and transparent revision process.”
“Yeah. They were good to me here.” Steve shook his head and let out a little laugh. “I couldn’t afford to dine here properly back then, but Luca was always sending me home with left-overs or feeding me tidbits.”
“So,” Tony said, as the Lotus purred down the street, “We’ve been doing quite the tour of international cuisine together, take-out-wise. Let’s see, we’ve hit Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Korean, Moroccan, and Mexican, right?”
“Thank you again for a wonderful evening,” Steve said. He swallowed roughly and glanced to the elevator. “I, uh, I should probably go . . .”
“So,” the Captain turns to face the camera, “To anyone struggling, please know that it’s ok not to be ok and to ask for help. It’s a sign of strength, not weakness. Please don’t give up. And--for what it’s worth, if it helps--I’m walking this road with you.”
“Our ‘why the fuck do we love this asshole so much and why is it so hard to take care of him?’ pact.  Our joint mission to keep you sane, nourished, and in one piece.  It was too big a job for one person.”
Tony closed his eyes tight and turned his face away. Jerry. Gentle with the tourists and fans who got too close, but
His words did nothing to mollify the Captain, who slammed a fist on the table and hissed. He let go of the mangled fork. Jerry changed tactics.
“I wasn’t,” Fury said. “And yet here I am.”  Fury tilted his head ever so slightly, and asked, “That a problem, Agent?”
“Tony,” he murmured again, nuzzling Tony’s neck. He kissed Tony’s cheeks, his neck, his forehead, then—breathing a little calmer—murmured in his ear, “Tony? How about I take you up to your place?”
century opulence with its crystal chandeliers, gilt detailing, and lofty ceiling. Nice. Not really Tony’s style, but he was gonna bet Rogers loved it. There were attractive, slim bodied servers gliding through the room bearing haute hors d’ouvres on silver trays and myriad glasses of champagne.
Tony swallowed the last of Steve’s come, then let Steve’s cock fall from his mouth and pressed his cheek against Steve’s thigh.  Tony grabbed his dick.  He fucked his fist hard and fast, slick with lube, desperate to come with Steve still clenched hard around his fingers, the taste of Steve’s come heavy on his tongue, the sounds of Steve’s pleasure—almost pained, like a beautiful anguish—throbbing in his ears and the sight of Steve undone and desperate dancing before his eyes.  Tony’s hand flew up and down his cock, hard and fast, the sound of it loud and obscene.
“Seriously. The press will behave badly, but they always do. So, all you really need to decide is whether or not you want to date Steve. And if you do, don’t let anything stand in your way.”
Tony took another sip of cocoa.  Steve opened his mouth to say something (“But it’s still interesting!” or “I like hearing your enthusiasm” or “I know I’m not a genius like you are, but I swear I’m not actually stupid.  Give me a chance!”).  Steve took a sip of cocoa.
“All right.”  Bruce took a long shuddering breath.  “Yeah.  If anybody is going to stop him from hurting people, it would be the four of you.  I’m just—all of you could get hurt in the process.”
“Well, he’s preparing to play in this charity match and apparently I’m a good training buddy,” Steve said with a sheepish smile. “I guess I caught on quick.” A pause. “You don’t mind, do you?”
“Don’t pull that shit again, though,” Tony added with a frown, “because somebody else might be seriously distressed or creeped out and, I mean, you’re right-- it’s not cool in a ‘no means no’ kinda way. Not that it was
“Tony, this is amazing,” she said almost reverently, then gave him a little hug and asked half-playfully, “So am
“Brucie, my PR duo want a tete-a-tete with you asap. They’re used to my particular brand of PR disaster—you’re a whole new ballgame.”
“Christ, Tony,” Steve mumbled against his chest. “I don’t deserve you.”  He swallowed loudly.  “And, of course, I’ll read whatever you think I should.  Just tell me and I’ll do it.”
Steve nodded.  He could feel Tony’s hard cock pressed up against him from behind.  He felt desperate and wanton and ready to beg already, even here in the wide echoing expanse of the garage, where he was so horribly exposed.
When Tony shuffled back to bed, the light of the reactor had gone dim.  Steve frowned.  Tony had put on pajamas.  He sat on the edge of the bed and held out the glass of water.  Steve sat up a little against the headboard and waited.  Tony held out the glass.  Steve waited.  (Aren’t you going to--?)  Tony didn’t move.  Steve reached out to take the cup.
Sorry for the delay!  I was struggling with The Conversation and this chapter kept growing and growing and causing me trouble.  Also RL.  Hopefully I can get the next chapter to you more quickly!
Tony smiled and looked at Steve with half-lidded eyes as he said, still a little breathless, “Wonderful.”
“Mr. Stark, that’s entirely unnecessary.” Rogers looked almost pained.  “I really only need a bedroom.  Access to a kitchen would be great, but it’s--”
“Don’t move,” Tony ordered.  Steve heard more rustling and then a thick, silky-feeling cord was looped around his wrists, once, twice, three times, four, around and around in loose coils.  Then Tony held Steve’s right hand steady as he threaded the rope back over the coils, drawing the binding tighter and tighter until the ropes were a firm, steady pressure.  Tony slid a finger under the ropes for a moment, then began to caress Steve’s bound arms, running his hands up and down.  Steve let out a shuddering breath.
When Tony turned he found Steve bending over to look at Dummy who was energetically waving a fabric scrap at him.
“That doesn’t mean a thing,” Rhodey protested. “People aren’t always what they seem, and he’s from the ‘40s, so I just want to make sure you—”
“No, I’m working on something new.  Steve, I’m really—” He waved between himself and the projection.  Steve stepped away.
.  It made something inside him twist strangely, not the straightforward rush of lust that sucking Tony’s cock gave him.  The thought of it was less immediate, less intimate, than sucking Tony’s cock.  Would he enjoy sucking fake cock?  Practicing, preparing to please Tony?  Steve shivered, feeling a rush of that strange guilty-shame-pleasure he couldn’t quite figure out.  His cock was aching, thick and heavy between his legs.
And just like that, Steve seemed to go limp. The stiff, stern, terrible set of his jaw and posture--the thing that had sent Tony panicking--seemed to flow out of him.  He opened his arms again and Tony hurried to hug him.  Steve shuddered.
“Anyway,” Tony said, trying to recapture his usual tone. “One bad experience with some SHIELD guy shouldn’t poison you against an entire profession.” Tony appealed to Steve’s sense of justice, adding, “That hardly seems fair, you know?”
Finally, he went to the gym.  He ran 22 miles and then spent some time slugging the special sandbags--the ones Tony had made for him--and finally felt a bit calmer.
For some reason this chapter was a ridiculous struggle, but here it is. Sorry for the delay getting this to you! (Still not really happy with this, but I don't think obsessing will help. :-)
Tony’d covered Steve up himself. It was no reason for Bruce to be making that weird face, and besides Bruce didn’t even know that.)
“Oh my God, do you hear yourself!?” Tony slammed his hand down on the counter. “If this is the attitude you’re gonna take then

“Do you think you’ll be able to close the portal?” Steve asked, looking at Bruce and Tony, then back up to the sky.
“Yeah, I know that,” Tony snapped.  “But all your alpha displays, they remind people of my orientation.”
It had only taken a couple of months to get the first generation StarkSafe on the market-- a miniaturized, limited function JARVIS smart enough to recognize a safeword and call 911 within ninety seconds once triggered unless given a customized deactivation code.  Stark Domestic's stock soared.  (And Tony'd made sure that the Maria Stark Foundation had a special endowment to provide them free to low-income submissives.) According to a national survey, non-con and contract abuse dropped by thirty-three percent the year the Stark Safe went on the market.
Tony watched as Steve stopped to exchange a few words with Mrs. Rhodes before heading to the elevator.
“Basically,” Bruce answered, “the photons are normalized, with a reduced electromagnetic radiation, so the arc reactor diffusion and gamma radiation are no longer breaking the wave-particle duality.”
would know what to say to Rogers. Tony opened and closed his mouth a few times, half-inclined to apologize, though unsure why. (Good thing he can’t see you—you look like a fish, Stark.) All the attachments on the adjustor and fluxator were perfectly aligned; Tony was tempted to stay under the spectrometer anyway.   But he wasn’t intimidated by Captain fucking America, so that definitely wasn’t gonna happen. No way he’d hide.
Steve took his leave.  He still hated the main SHEILD facility.  It had felt like a prison within a prison when he first woke up in the 21
“Good morning!” Steve said brightly (and a little too loud for pre-coffee Tony). He leaned down for a quick kiss and Tony caught him by his sweaty shirt.
They both turned, bewildered, to the training room door as Cap barreled in, bellowing, his nostrils flaring.  He had Clint in his sights with a horrible glare—like the one from their little chat in the elevator times a thousand.
Tony dodged and wove around a few slow moving cars; he took a sharp and daring left into the alley next to the restaurant, then left again into the parking lot. As promised, there was an empty spot labeled “For Tony S.”
Steve ran his fingers through Tony’s hair and kissed the top of his head, his cheek, then breathed softly into his hair, “We’re gonna be so good to each other.”
Then with a little frown of concentration, Steve started to untie the leads at Tony’s wrists.  Tony kinda wanted to protest—he liked the ropes—but held it in.  Steve studied the small pink indentations where Tony’d let his weight pull on the bonds, then he kissed them tenderly once he’d assured himself all was well. (It was unbearably sweet.) He stretched out beside Tony again and resumed slowly stroking his back.
Tony’s guts clenched. He fixed the Dom with his coldest most contemptuous look, raked his eyes up and down the man’s body, then walked away without a word.
“I agree!” Tony exclaimed, clapping his hands together.  Steve and Bruce looked at him in surprise.  “It’s time for you to Hulk out, buddy.”
Carmichael began with a broad discussion of Clint and Natasha’s divided duties between SHIELD and the Avengers. She informed them that, since the Avengers were going to have a media presence, the Agents would either need to conceal their identities vigilantly in association with the Avengers or cease work on covert operations. (Wow! REALLY?) Tony tried not to eye-roll obviously, but seriously? Where’d they find this “expert?” Brown? Or worse,
Tony smiled.  Pepper had kicked off her five-inch stilettos; Tony tossed them aside carelessly and folded to his knees beside her.  The carpet was so plush it was almost a cushion-- just the way he liked it.  He pulled her left foot into his lap and began kneading it gently with his thumbs.
“Wow,” Clint said. “Uh, tell me how you really feel.” Tony glared and opened his mouth again, but Clint held his hands up in surrender. “No, no—point taken! I hadn’t really noticed that, but yeah. Ok. I see what you mean.” He paused. “So, maybe I should join you for some
Mollified, Tony nodded. “Yeah, I’d like.” Tony grinned. “I warn you though, I’m dangerous. People usually underestimate me.”
“Tony’s asleep,” Steve told them softly.  Clint looked amused, Natasha looked as warm as Steve had ever seen her, and Thor looked like he’d swallowed a bee—the expression Steve thought of as his “wanting to make loud noises and trying very hard not to!” face.
“If you ever need anything, you let me know,” she said. “Orientational minorities have stick together around here, you know? We never get the respect we deserve.”
“Sad. Angry.” Steve frowned then added, “But never violent. Not angry like that. Just . . . hollowed out. He loved us. But he never tried to stop. The drink. It probably killed him.”
It was ten days after Tony’s return that Steve finally saw him, on one of the many occasions he’d staked out the coffee maker.
“Let me do my job,” she said, voice firm, calm, and collected. Then she added a little more softly, “Please.”
“Pfft,” Tony said, waving it away. “I already told you—it’s fine. And you got me the Starship Enterprise! And gave me drawings of Dummy. Really, what more could a guy ask for? Now, come on! Chop chop! Your present awaits.”
“Yeah, sure.  Fine, just not too many roses.  I dunno.”  Tony wiped some excess oil off Dummy and frowned.  “Look, they’re for Pepper so you know what she likes to order.  It’s going to her office at the new Stark Industries building.  And I want you to send somebody out to buy three—no, six—pairs of Manolo Blahniks, size nine, and work those into the bouquet somehow.”
When Steve met Rhodey for the first time. Set a year and a half prior to the current Surrender timeline.
“We’re still training together,” Rogers said a little blankly, then added with a bit of a smile, “You disarmed JARVIS’ giant robot so fast yesterday, though, there was hardly any point in having the rest of us there.”
“Dummy! Get over here.” Dummy obeyed eagerly. (What? He can ascribe adverbs to his bots if he wants to…) “Yeah, good boy. Let’s check you over, ok?”
“Yeah, just—“ Rhodey sighed again and explained to Tony, “So, her best friend from grad school, Jen, was engaged to be married this spring and two days ago her fiancé dumped her. Out of the blue, just walked out, called off the wedding, and took back his collar.”
Tony rubbed his neck and tried to hold in a frustrated sigh.  “Yeah, I see what you mean.  But what if you want to say no or stop but don’t want to mean it.”
They stood in the stairwell for long moments and Natasha just waited. (She’d eased into the corner a little—it had the clearest sightlines.)
Steve smiled as he held Tony’s hips still and planted a row of kisses up and down his inner thighs, never touching where Tony wanted him most. Up and down, down and up.
“Yeah, got it!” Tony said a little too brightly.  “Good, great! Team! Bonding!  Awesome.  Will zip it on the cynical stuff and innuendo.”  Tony swallowed. “But uh, if that’s enough feelings for you, then how about we go back to the good kind of bonding.  Ya know: you, me, science, and machines?  ‘Cause I think I see a pattern in the fourth grid.”
Tony managed not to laugh, but only barely. (Seriously? This guy had nothing to be embarrassed about!)
“Coming!” Steve called back from down the hall. He hurried out wearing a lovely black suit and holding a large bouquet of flowers. Tony stared at them: red roses, yellow roses, and white stargazer lilies.
“Maryam Mirzakhani,” Harry said decisively. Tony made a skeptical face. (No sub had ever won the Field Medal.)
Many thanks to aries_taurus, carzla, Moonlit_Lampshade, and charmeandering for translation help!  All continuing errors are my own...
A wine bottle clanked loudly against the rim of a glass. Her tone was sad when she continued, “So. I—it just gives me a bad feeling, Bruce. I can't shake the sense that this will end in heartbreak.” There was a pause and Steve could hear utensils against china-- Bruce serving seconds?
First, Tony tried to call up all the words he’d spoken.  Maybe it was something he’d said, there at the end?  Had some of the taboo dirty talk made it past his filters.  He’d been planning to try some of that out on Steve another time, but wasn’t going to rush it.  (Yeah, spread your legs, you fucking slut.  You’re gagging for it, aren’t you?  Such a filthy little slut for my cock . . .)  No—Tony was sure he hadn’t crossed that line without noticing.  He rambled during sex, but not mindlessly and even the filth he held back surely wouldn’t provoke
“Yeah, I know, sweetheart.”  Tony smiled.  “Now, I want you to bend over and take my cock in your mouth, as far down as you can comfortably.  Move slowly.  Focus on relaxing your throat like you just did.  Let my cock touch the back of your throat and try not to gag.  Just touch though; don’t try to push it for now.  Ready?”
(Oh, what--we’re not equals when I kneel?). Tony bit back the bitter words he doesn’t even mean, the kind that got him into this trouble in the first place.
Steve paused.  He shoved the last of the biscuit in his mouth, wiped his fingers on a napkin, and reached for his tablet.  He added a note at the bottom of their spreadsheet.
Tony glanced around, eyes aching. There was the mug he'd broken earlier and, oh actually, it looked like there was another one too. And a smashed plate. The drafts, every single one he'd worked on, were scattered all around the workshop, hanging still and silent.
that.)  Tony held in a sigh and tried not to let his shoulders slump, tried not to give everything away.  (Great.  Yep, shovel speech. Woo.)  He was holding his breath, unscrewing things that didn’t need it in an attempt to look busy.
“That’s fine, Tony,” Steve said.  “Don’t worry about it.  I’ll be back down in a few minutes with something to eat.  There are still some of Bruce’s curried lentils if you like.  Or I could make you a ham sandwich.”
When he looked back, expecting an answer, Clint and Natasha were having one of their conversations conducted purely in facial expressions.
“Dr. Banner, your work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. It's a pleasure to meet you.  At last.”  Tony dropped into the chair next to him and shook his hand.  “How the hell did these idiots get you?  Seriously, whatever they're offering I can give you triple.  Who'm I kidding?  I can give you whatever you want.  You, me, and twelve floors of R&D to play in!”
Clearly, Rogers had been doing more reading. Or maybe he’d taken one of SHIELD’s training modules? Or maybe Katie or Michael had said something? (Yeah, seemed possible—maybe while prepping Rogers for the press?) Or Bruce. Or-- (Whatever. Doesn’t matter.)
“Morning, Tony,” Steve said brightly. “There’s coffee in the pot still, if you’d like some. And pancakes.”
When Tony resurfaced the next evening, all the lights were out and the quiet strands of “Once in Royal David’s City” on Classical guitar floated through the living room. Steve was standing alone, illuminated only by the light of the Christmas tree.
Tony cleared his throat. He hesitated for just a moment, before saying, “It’s leading that’s hard. Any idiot can follow.”
Tony nodded. He expected Clint to leave; he didn’t. Instead, Clint took a few steps closer. He looked anxious; it was a weird look on him.
“Goddamn fucking sack of shit macho douchebag fucktards!” (God, he fucking hated SHIELD sometimes . . . He’d pick them off one by one and then—wait.)
“Oh, right, sure.”  Tony blinked again and shook his head as if to clear it.  “Well, thanks again for dinner.  And the delivery service.”
But, hey, Cap wasn’t a bad guy! If Clint took him aside for a tactful word . . . (He probably just hadn’t thought things through.)  Sure Cap could be a bit of a throwback, but it hadn’t seemed to prevent him being a generally decent teammate, to Tony included.  And after months without even being on a first-name-basis, Steve and Tony had finally gotten to be cordial, even buddies, Clint thought. (Being buddies, though, didn’t mean Cap could make Tony his that-other-kind-of-buddy.)
“The Bite’s perfect?”  Immediately, Tony wished he could take the words back, undo his tone: uncertain and pleased and surprised.
Tony’s cheeks were scalding and his voice was low and breathless; Steve’s eyes were wide and dilated and as he twisted nearer, Tony could feel Steve’s hard on pressing against his hip.
Pepper was smiling. “Yes. But I’m afraid since leaving weapons, we haven’t done much business with Macmillan.”
“Ah,” Bruce said, giving Rogers the Banner Contemplative Look # IV.  “That was very good of you, Captain.” He shuffled into the lab with a smile.
Tony reached under Steve to tweak first his right nipple, then his left.  The little jolts of pain made Steve whimper and twitch.
“I’m lucky too,” Steve said, trying to put everything he felt for Tony into his voice and his expression, to give Rhodey a wordless promise he’d take care of Tony, love him, and never hurt him. “I’m so incredibly lucky.”
Steve grabbed his sketch book and a box of pencils. He slid under the covers and propped up in bed with a pile of pillows at his back. He'd just do a little detailing before he went to sleep. Tony looked good as an ancient Greek.
“I’m so proud of you,” Pepper was murmuring ever-so-softly, stroking his hair with one hand and holding him close. Tony found the contact comforting, but even more comforting was the knowledge that Pepper
“When you kneel, I can’t--” Steve shook his head.  “It’s not right--not right to be angry when a sub’s kneeling.  It’s all wrong when you’re like that, so it’s like forcing me to--”. He let out a frustrated breath, searching for words.  “It’s like shutting me up and forcing me to forgive you and say I’m ok, even when I’m not.”
“If there are other things you want to be doing, you should do them, but if it’s just guilt—well,” Bruce spread his hands and shrugged.  “We’re on call twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.  That can take a toll.  Sometimes we’re only needed for a few hours or a few days, but now and then it’s a couple of weeks, like that time in Iowa.  Makes it a little hard to take on another set of full time duties, unless you’re free to drop them for Avengers business.”  Bruce stirred the lentils sending more steam rising up from the bowl.  “And, well, after everything you’ve done—everything you’ve been through, I think you deserve a bit of a break and time to draw if that’s what you want.  Just a thought.”
Tony swallowed down the words “I’ll be disappointed if you don’t;” he knew what Steve meant and doubted he’d appreciate the glib reply in his current mood.
"I hardly think you're the right candidate for this," Phillips said, "since the thought fills you with such revulsion. I misunderstood your willingness to serve your country."
Time to get a nightcap then call it a night.  (And maybe see if there was any more of that amazing chicken in the fridge.)
“And I seem to remember a famous story about a prohibited high-risk solo mission behind enemy lines . . .”
“—I was sorry for that years and years ago. I’m not a dumb teenager anymore OR some sex-crazed nympho who can’t keep it in his pants for ten minutes! For god’s sake, he’s my
“Look, Pepper, there’s, uh, something I should tell you.  Er, should have told you earlier really.  I mean, the team already knows.  I should have told you sooner—it’s just all been so sudden!  I—I’m seeing someone.”
you want more strength, but you don’t.  If I put any more ‘oomph’ into it, you’re gonna get such a strong recoil it’ll take you off your feet.”  Tony paused and capitulated—he turned.  Natasha cocked her head to one side, giving him that impassive look.  He stared back at her.  He hated that look.  (Well maybe…)
Tony didn’t know what to say to that, so it was a good thing Rhodey started calling out, “Hey! Hey, Tones! I’m gonna call Miranda!”
(Time to get some shit done!)  Tony ran his fingers through his wet hair.  (Fuck those assholes, anyway.)
“Ooooh, I’m scared!” Dom rolled his eyes. “Your word against mine. Just because you’re Captain America, doesn’t mean they’ll just—”
“Please tell me you dealt with those idiots.”  Tony rolled his eyes.  “Turning things off then back on again three times can’t fix a design flaw.  And anyone who works in R&D and thinks it can needs to be fired.”
Tony sighed and poured himself a mug of freshly brewed coffee. He cast a longing glance at the scotch.
“Great.  Thanks.”  Tony paused reaching out for a fresh screw.  “Actually, since you’re coming, bring over a dozen roses—red and white.  Have security send them up to the 50
Tony’d begun the evening on edge, wondering how it would be different now that he and Steve were together, but it all seemed the same. In fact, so much the same Tony would almost have worried if it weren’t for the occasional sweet and intimate smile Steve gave him when he thought nobody was looking. Clint seemed a little antsy (he’d picked the outing—probably wanted to make sure everyone had fun) and Bruce was about to drive him insane obsessing over the Security Blanket, but other than that it was nice. The food was delicious, Rosie was a peach, and nobody bothered them. (Tony suspected Rosie’s hand in that, but couldn’t be sure.)
“Mr. Stark?” Rogers called, pausing the documentary with the remote. (He never talked over films. Ever.) “Would you like to join us? We’re watching a documentary about Mr. Duke Ellison.”
.  He still waited for Tony’s okay.  Rogers’ stance looked a bit like parade rest, hands behind his back, feet apart at the width of his ridiculously broad shoulders.
Tony read: "Also, the approach of ‘If you really loved me, you’d do SM with me’ is reprehensible. . . If you really loved them you wouldn’t treat them in such an unfair way, and I hope they’re smart enough to realize that."
Tony couldn’t help smiling.  For such a kinky son of a bitch, Steve was a real romantic about it. And holy shit, he was interested in way more than Tony had been expecting.
Steve wanted to practice.  He wanted to learn everything, wanted to drive Tony half-mad with pleasure until he’d wiped the memory of all Tony’s other lovers from his mind, every single one of them.  (Idiot—it’s ridiculous to be jealous.  He loves
Tony stroked the soft skin of Steve’s wrist gently with his thumb.  He wrapped the first restraint tight, threaded the leather strap through the buckle, then closed again.  The leather was soft and well-padded, the metal buckles heavy and thick.  It felt like a second skin or like Tony’s hand clasping him firmly.  Tony closed Steve’s right wrist in the second cuff.
So, it was fine, really.  Mostly.  And as Pep pointed out, the cheaper they bought Lang Inc, the more money they’d have for the Foundation.  And the sooner they bought Lang Inc., the sooner that asshole’s name would be taken off a Fortune 500 company forever.
In theory, Tony came on Thanksgiving to help with the preparations, but mostly he just wandered around and chatted with people, trying to keep the atmosphere chill. He joked about what a terrible cook he was and told silly stories about being banned from various kitchens, his mother’s included. He’d be back in a couple of weeks to help with another workshop on coding and basic programing, something he was far more comfortable with. (One of the Safehouse’s best innovations—their most disadvantaged guests were far more likely to get back on their feet with new job training.) In fact, he’d spent longer than he’d intended to holed up in the library with a group of guests who’d asked him to take a look at their code and to take them through the Stark Industries hiring procedure and standard interview questions. (Even on a holiday, many of them were hard at work.) They’d been short on career development volunteers lately—Tony’s talk to Isaac about hiring more staff.
Then Tony clenched Steve’s hair in his fist and jerked his head back sharply.  Steve gasped and cried out as Tony bit his neck, worrying at it with his teeth.  Tony rose up on his knees to lean over Steve and take his mouth in a fierce kiss.  His tongue fucked in and out of Steve’s mouth, hot, heavy, wet.  Steve forgot to breathe.  His whole body was throbbing.  He felt dizzy.
After a few moments, Steve looked up and said more decisively, “Yeah, why not? JARVIS, if you don’t mind?”
Tony brushed his teeth again—there was garlic on that pizza after all—and fussed over his hair for a few moments. (Ok, five minutes.)   He checked his ass in the huge floor-to-ceiling mirror (nice) and rummaged around for a top. Not that it mattered—it wasn’t a date. And Steve had seen him sweaty and gross with motor oil on his cheek already. There it was: the MIT sweatshirt that was just a little too small for him. (Perfect!) Tony pulled on his nice ankle boots, the ones with chunky heels. He looked great. Not that it mattered. Tony sauntered to the common room, opting for the stairs.
) about Rogers’ motives at first, but apparently Tony’d started trusting Rogers (at least a little) without even noticing it. If Rogers was trying to play him, the man deserved an Academy Award—and Tony didn’t think he had it in him, either the maliciousness or the acting abilities.
“Yes!”  Another thrust and Steve rocked back to meet it.  Tony spread his fingers a little as he pulled back, then pressed in again curling his fingers to hit
“Good.  You say ‘shield’ and everything stops immediately.  I’ll set you lose, stop whatever we’re doing, and take care of you until you can tell me what went wrong.  Okay?”
“Eeeewww iiiibbbeeeeee dnnnnnnnndddddddd,” the creature emitted, tone slightly less shrill than before. The sound came from what would be Steve’s stomach.
“The stock is still in a slump, but once they hit market it should get a major bump. The pre-orders alone have . . . ”
Tony gave him a wicked grin, then leaned forward to kiss him, pressing his lips to Steve’s forehead, his cheek, his lips, his jaw.  Tony was thrusting his finger into Steve in a slow steady rhythm that made him keen for more.  In and out, in and out.  Steve clenched the bedsheets in fists.
Steve took a few steps back to look Tony up and down; Tony could feel the blush spreading down his neck to his collarbone. He dropped his head lower and resisted the temptation to squirm under Steve’s rapt gaze.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed, noncommittally as he joined her in taking a left turn. She was walking quite close; it made it impossible not to notice how much taller she was.
The Captain drew his shoulders back a little and raised his chin ever so slightly.  He took a step forward and held out his hand.
“Dining area,” he waved a hand.  Rogers seemed to be drinking in the sights with a certain amount of pleasure, though he did also keep giving Tony these little looks that seemed—curious? surprised? Tony couldn’t tell.
“Hell, man, that’s not far! Have Miranda tell you if she gets a little time free. Like, once Jen’s cried herself to sleep, you could swing by in War Machine!”
“Tony? Bruce thinks he’s ready to go back to training,” Steve said. It sounded like good news, but Tony could tell from his tone of voice there was a big ‘
As they took their seats on brightly colored and beautifully embroidered floor cushions, Tony said, “Well, I really hope you like it.  Seemed like you might.  I mean, it isn’t Michelin rated haute cuisine or anything, but —“
. Stark's consulting hours are from--”  Tony stopped short then blurted, “Holy shit you got Banner!”
Then Steve was sucking his cock, wet and hot, while a slick finger caressed his hole, not pressing inside—not yet—just stroking over his entrance in a steady rhythm that matched the dizzying drag on his dick.  Tony felt lightheaded and breathless, like the only things holding him up were the ties at his wrists and Steve’s hand at his hip.
Too soon—far too soon—Steve pulled back. He pressed light, wet kisses to Tony’s lips, his cheek, his forehead, then dropped lower to Tony’s exposed throat. Tony nearly whimpered, half-thrilled and half-embarrassed. A firm hand and a little kissing had never left him so desperate before.
Tony winced anyway. “When you say it like that, it sounds stupid. Just—“ Tony shrugged, “—I don’t-- it’s been a while, you know? Come on, Rhodey-- when was the last time
Tony let out a little noise unbidden when Steve’s fingers closed firmly around his wrists again and with a slow pressure, pinned them behind his back. (Yes!) He could feel Steve smile against his lips.
“Thank you so much,” she said, turning back to Steve and sounding a little hesitant. “I’m very glad to hear it.”  A pause.  “I’m Francesca the chef and owner.”  Another pause.  “I heard from my staff that this is the second time you’ve dinned with us recently so—“ She shifted from foot to foot, eyes only for Steve.  “Sorry, this is probably a ridiculous question, but you see when I was little my grandparents used to tell me these stories and—”
“Sure,” Rogers said.  “Like me sketching.  It takes my mind off things for a while, so I can come back to the problem fresh.”  Rogers looked over at the glowing holograph with images of Bob, their readings, and some of Tony’s theories.  “Besides,” Rogers added sadly, “without all the data you needed.”  He paused.  “Mr. Stark, I’m very sorry about that.  I promise to--”
“Nah,” he murmured.  “I’m always coming to you for help—nice to have the chance to lend you a little support.  Even if it’s just tea.”
Rhodey had a crutch wedged under his left armpit; his right knee was wrapped in a brace, his right ankle in a cast, while his right arm hung heavily in a sling.
, I’m telling you that we’re fine. I wasn’t pissed and I don’t hate you. I mean, eventually, I’d have probably snapped—you know, like with the chair thing—and told you to back the fuck off, but, hey, you figured it out first! So, that’s good, right? Uh, well done.”
“Is there something kinda traditional that Steve might like?” Tony asked. “Something old timey but not gross? Or some sort of nerdy military tradition I wouldn’t know about? You two have that kinda thing in common.”
From across the ballroom, Tony saw Pepper was in deep conversation with two people. Pepper towered over the younger woman; the older man towered over Pepper. Tony might have passed them by, but he saw Pepper’s eyes were bright with the enthusiasm of exciting business deals or new friends. He approached.
Tony shrugged; it looked weird when he did that in the suit, but he couldn’t stop himself.  “Good, I guess.  Though we should probably practice without the harness.  We may not always have the luxury of suiting up.”
The interview--and Steve more broadly--were still trending. Mostly positive, lots of praise for his openness. A bit of negative grossness, trolls calling him ‘weak’ and asking if he could still lead the Avengers. But those people were getting soundly shouted down by the others.
Looked like Steve had some fairly conflicting feelings about pain.  Tony tapped at the arc reactor pensively.   So, unsure about pain.  Fair enough.  They’d talk about it later.  And, oh, interesting—Steve had checked “curious” for “marks (bruising, scabs, etc.).”  (Yeah—definitely talking about that later.)
Steve rubbed the back of his neck. “Not that I don’t appreciate it, just, it’s hardly going to feel more like a real
at the gala was developing a new product “for electronics” that might interest Stark Industries and their head of R&D . . .)
Steve let out a little sound that might be a whimper.  Tony cupped Steve’s chin and tilted his head to place a kiss, soft and delicate, on Steve’s lips. Clumsy and eager, Steve opened his mouth and chased Tony’s mouth as he pulled away.  Tony squeezed Steve’s jaw, a hard pressure just a notch below pain.
“Oh, right.” Rogers—no, Steve—glanced away. “I’m sorry I fell asleep and left you to clean up. I really was enjoying
“Any questions about the overall strategy?” Mikie asked. “We still have two days to make adjustments if necessary.”
Steve shook his head.  “Nope.  I finished that.  Wasn’t very useful—I’m starting to think that he worries I’m bored or something.”
Tony did not call out petulantly, “You’re going the wrong way! Come back and fuck me!” but it was a near thing.
Tony managed to hold in a little laugh. (Oh man! Steve doesn’t wanna go for the same reasons I don’t!) Tony was about to promise Christmas with him in the Tower would be chill when Steve added.
“Oh, right,” Rogers said a little abashed. “They did.  But, I presented real late so when September came around and I still hadn’t shown they guessed based on my build.”  He hesitated.  “I really liked the cooking lessons though.  My classmates there were real sweethearts and cooking seemed like a useful skill for me, so I petitioned to stay until the end of the year.”  Cap made a grimace.  “I wasn’t exactly built for heavy labor back . . . before.”
Steve let out a strangled noise and rocked forward and back, curling and uncurling, to help drive Tony’s fingers harder and deeper inside him.  (Fuck me!)  Tony licked his cock.
When Steve killed the motor and started to take off his helmet, Tony reached around and grabbed his arms.
Steve threw his shoulders back and said, in his Cap voice, “All right, Avenger. Let’s go join the others.”
“ ‘Ranch Mansion’ doesn’t have the same ring to it,” Clint said with a laugh. “Well, whatever we call it, I love it. Where should we put our stuff?”
Steve shook Rhodey’s hand, heart feeling full again. (Thank you, thank you so much. I love him, I love him, I love him. . . )
“—stuff happens.  I mean, we’re both busy people.  Rescheduling a drink is seriously no big deal.  No need to apologize!”  (Shit, shit, shit.  Excuse . . . need one.  Come on, universe!)
“Yeah,” Tony fumbled, “I get that, uh—” And it was somehow delightful to see Tony Stark, so slick and suave, completely at a loss, frowning, mouth opening and closing.
“Yes, sir,” Rogers answered, all military.  His tone was clipped, brisk. “It’s unreasonable to ask your officers to accept assessment without clearly delineated criteria for that assessment.  There has to be a contract in place, with clear expectations on both sides.”
“Pfft. I wouldn’t have done that if you were someplace I shouldn’t distract you! You’re in D.C. Now, back to my question.”
Rogers shrugged. “You’re welcome.”  They stood watching as the various parts of the spectrometer lit up, one by one, in sequence.  It was a beautiful sight.
“So, I’m in charge,” Steve said, “but if you don’t like something—if it’s uncomfortable or no good for you, I want you to promise me that you’ll ‘yellow,’ even if it’s something small. Can you do that for me?”
“Pretty sure they had sex back in the 40’s,” Jackie said with a wry smile, lathering Tony’s hair. “And the whole old school ‘don’t kiss and tell’ thing would hardly have a gentleman boasting about his conquests. So, for all you know, he’s Captain Keeps His Banging Quiet. Just because
“Oh yeah?” Steve asked, something playful in his voice, but a lingering skepticism beneath it. “How’d you figure that one?”
The little check marks appeared almost instantly again and Steve wondered if Tony ever had his phone out of reach.
Tony made his way to the facilities and barely managed to keep his phone in his pocket until he got there. Just for good measure, he went into a stall and closed the door. He whipped out his Stark Phone and searched: “yellow roses flower language.”
Thank you so much for your patience!  I've been looking forward to sharing this with you and really hope you liked this. Uh . . . I promise they will talk.  Really!  Thanks for reading!
