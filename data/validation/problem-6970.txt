He felt the soft scraping of finely trimmed beard hairs rub the left of his chest, right above his heart, as the form on top of him shifted a little to avoid the light and he couldn't help but smile at the small "mmph" in the other voice. He felt his heart swell as the form's grip on him tightened, their limbs in an effort to encircle him fully but falling adorably short.
"Once this whole ordeal is over, I think you should move back to Cali. Pepper anyway wants you there in the headquarters. Peter will be safe in college, I can trust that no harm will come to him. I'll even check in a few of my friends to drop by and keep an eye on him."
Steve's reaction made Rhodey lose all colour from him face as his eyes widened and jaw loosen. In the end, he clamped Steve's shoulder and wished him good luck with somewhat of an apologetic smile and took his leave, hugging Tony.
"I want to bring you guys back first. T'Challa and I are already working on fixing the Accords. Ross blew a goddamn bomb when he got to know you freed everyone from the Raft like a little shit." Tony smirks at him, adoring his audacious Captain, who smirks in response, before continuing, "We contacted Selvig and Jane to try and contact Thor. I don't know how that's going to happen but…. Yeah, and we're scouring every single nook and cranny for Bruce. We're gonna fix this, Steve. I want to make this right."
"Good evening, Captain Rogers. How was your mission?", the British AI booms almost, startling Steve who, as usual, glances up at the ceiling. Old habit.
"Shut up, Tony! Pick out the movie you want to watch.", Rhodey shoots back before grabbing Tony's keys from the hook and going out.
Tony gulps the rest of his coffee in one long gulp before setting the mug down, grabbing his keys from the table before he glances at Steve and slams the door on his way out.
He tosses the phone into the cup holder and stretches back in his seat, before he hears a buzz from the holder.
Steve turned his head to the other side and awoke fully as the light pinched through the glass, forcing him to squint and blink a few times in response to the stimuli of the golden sun outside peeking through the hill, fully aware of the soft weight on him, encapsulating him with their sleek arms and dancer legs and the lithe frame shifting gently atop him.
The ceiling was a pure sky azure, it's simple hue - calm and matchless, dotted with white tufts as if to resemble the morning sky with a menagerie of clouds floating by. The image looked so real as if from a mural of a Renaissance painting but the man who was awake and doting at it with a soft, content smile on his lips, knew the truth. Despite being a simulation, the image he saw looked like a work of art more than reality, it's hues resembling the pastel colours he uses to paint.
It's been a few months since Peter left and Tony hasn't been dealing with it well. He makes it a point to call Peter every weekend and inquire.
There's still space left, so Tony grabs whatever is his in the drawers and cabinets, scanning pin-pointedly, aiming to leave no trace of him at all. His watches, his box of souvenirs he's saved over the years, the grand collection of novels his mother got him when he was 15, his comics, his perfumes, everything. Every single thing Tony owns is scanned by him and placed into the bag. Even his toothbrush accompanies the baggage, despite still dripping wet.
The conversation was cut short when Tony was dragged away by other dignitaries, probably his father's business partners and acquaintances.
"I'm just.... I'm just so scared, Rhodey. I had my doubts.... But after Pete left for uni, he's gotten more distant. He doesn't even look at me when we have sex...."
Five blocks later, Tony saw the car again, parked in the same driveway. He glanced up at the same familiar duplex house.
Oh god, Steve felt heat pool in his stomach and his pants get uncomfortably tight at the sight, as he pitched a tent in them.
Steve gently leaned forward and pressed himself to Tony's back, before pressing his lips one more time to his nape and pushing the t shirt down to Tony's abdomen and bunching it there, urging Tony to place his hands on the table.
Now I'm going to think a lot about how to continue this lel my brain is dead but I've got some tricks up my shleeeb.
At first, Tony seems repulsed by the idea. He can't seem to gather any air in his lungs to even breathe out a syllable. He just sits there, contemplating for a while when he feels the same familiar hand come down on his shoulder:
Then, Steve softens up, as he usually does and speaks to Tony so delicately like he's the most fragile thing in the universe, with oh-so-much patience and such aggressive tenderness.
"That's very good, Captain. I'm afraid sir has told me not to reveal his current location to you because he wants you to find him. Rest assured that he is in the premises but I haven't told him you've arrived yet.", the all-knowing AI teases.
Who would ever even guess that all of this would come crashing down like a pyramid of wine glasses, the pure crystal of their relationship to get tainted and turn black?
"You know how Steve is! If I'm not at home without telling him, he throws a fucking hissy fit! Remember the last time we went out together?"
It was a simple ceremony, with only a handful of guests including Tony's best friend James and a strawberry blonde woman called Virginia, but preferred to be called Pepper, who was Tony's PA and also one of his close confidantes from long ago.
Steve continued his lazy patterns along the expanse of skin beneath his fingers, tracing every inch with his fingertips, trying to map and memorize them, so that they stay engraved in his brain for eternity. He could feel it turn to gooseflesh, as was his own, whether in response to the cold morning air or the stimuli of skin upon skin, pressed flush against one another. A small shudder might have worked through him, eliciting a hum and a tighter grip in response.
I can't live this life knowing that I'm just I'm getting tired of it. So, you're gonna have to make a choice. You either choose to go home permanently or you choose... Well, you choose me."
Tony used to sing to him in foreign tongue, mostly Italian, softly and quietly, while he trailed his fingers through his hair, massaged his scalp with such beloved tenderness while the other hand used to rub circles on his chest, not teasingly but more devotedly, like he was worshipping the heart beating under the flesh, because he knew it beat only for him as he clasped him close, while Steve nuzzled under Tony's neck and nipped softly at the skin there, eliciting sudden gasps and sputters from his love.
Steve's heart pangs at his thoughts, as he witnesses the lives he's ruined and the feelings he's played with.
Steve feels himself burning up. He's close, he can feel it, the pressure in his groin increasing gradually with every stroke of Tony's mouth. His thighs are trembling but Tony places his hands on them, rubbing gentle circles with thumb. Steve looks down at Tony, sees his deep, beautiful eyes focused on him. Tony's neck and shoulders are flexing and staining from the effort he's making, his back muscles flexing as he takes Steve in wonderfully, slurping and drooling on his cock, framed perfectly by his groomed goatee. Steve runs his thumb over Tony's chin, coaxing him and consoling him. Tony's hands, meanwhile, explore the planes of Steve's stomach and abs, ever so often pinching a nipple, sending Steve closer and closer to the edge. The burning pressure in Steve's gut hits the breaking point, goaded on by Tony's strokes, as he falls back in the sheets.
Tony is about to throw his empty cup and leave when Carol wallops him in a bear hug, squeezing him so endearingly that it chokes all the air out of him.
Steve talked at great length of the trials and travails of his squadron as they had to manoeuvre through the rough terrains of Iraq. He gave him some advice about surviving camp and fighting with the other soldiers for basic amenities in the barracks. He especially remembered his best friend, Bucky and recalled the great fun they had during the war, over a pint or two of beer or over a game of cards.
Steve expected some biting snark from the witty scientist but he was a little surprised at Tony's calm nature. It was very rare that Tony would be this calm and relaxed, their lazy presence soothing one another as they relished each other's touches and enjoyed a quiet.
Tony's hand feels the thick muzzle of hair and sees his fingers sink into it. He looks at the soldier, full of guilt and remorse. His eyes have lowered to the floor now and Tony softly massages the strands, retracting and expanding his fingers, feeling the shifting of the soft hairs under his ministrations which elicit tears from the soldier's big baby blues now peering at him, in awe of his magnanimous display.
His head is throbbing at his temples and his mid-line and he runs a hand through his hair to try and numb it out, settling to rub his temples in slow, soothing circles.
His eyes have gone back to adoring the beautiful scenery outside the window. The gently undulating lawns are dotted with beautiful trees and bushes, scattered in a myriad of directions. The river flows by quietly beside them, it's swirling path reflecting the grey-white clouds that roll above. They loom large and erumpent, full of water and ice, their bows and dips forming creative curves and figures. He loved cloud-gazing, it was such a beautiful sight to make sense or recognition of the irregular forms that floated across the sky. The sunlight comes from the other direction, it's soft yellow illuminating the view with its evening glow. He adores the scene and forgets the person come to meet him. They may have even gone by now for all he knows. He's engrossed in the view, watching with rapt attention, taking in every single pixel of the landscape and it's breathtaking beauty. It distracts him from the beckoning of the amber liquids and the weight of his self destructive tendencies looming large.
Steve reached forward and grabbed Tony by the arms, hoisting him onto him again and pulling him flush against the Kevlar of his suit. He hooked his arms around Tony's waist as Tony's own grabbed onto Steve's biceps for good measure. He lowered Tony down slowly and steadily onto his cock, a little faster after the fat crown breached Tony's rim completely, as he nipped at Tony's earlobe fervently.
"Good.....",he glances at the clock, before returning his gaze, "early mid mid-night. How'd you sleep?"
"I'm sorry about Barnes' arm. Well, he did try ripping out the arc reactor and I guess I just lost it... I didn't know what I was doing.. I'm sorry about that. Anyway, I patched up a prototype for a new one. Tell him I'll send it soon as sort of an apology, if not a peace offering. Unless the Wakandans have already given him a vibranium model. Regardless, I'll send the first model soon.
He glances at his finger and looks at the shimmering platinum band poised on his finger, a remainder of his vows, his fidelity. He admonishes it with a huff and yanks it off his finger, tearing some skin in the process which elicits a hiss from his lips, as he jerks his hand to soothe the burn.
Steve's managed to trash all the ornamental china and glassware they owned. Even the fucking vase he tossed at him. Luckily, it didn't shatter but if Pepper found out that her gift was used as a launch missile, she'd rip Tony a new one.
"Stop! Don't say my name! Don't even dare utter those syllables from your mouth. I fucking hate myself more every time I hear your voice addressing me. That's the last thing I need right now, to hate myself more."
Steve felt like he was on cloud nine! His body tensed up immediately but his soul felt like a Christmas tree, all lit up and fanciful. Slowly, he mellowed against the kiss and hooked his arm on Tony's waist, pulling him closer with a jerk as he smiled against his lips and kissed him more intently, more passionately.
He brings the phone back up to look at it and his eyes open in horror to see name calling and he almost drops the phone -
All his problems will disappear. All his stress will vanish, every ache, every heartbreak, every single ounce of pain will disintegrate and dust away. He just needs to take that first step. That initiative to finally do something for himself after so long.
When Steve saw Tony at his very first Stark expo, he was swept off his feet by the new young, beautiful and vivacious CEO. He looked gorgeous when he first saw him - wearing a crisp black suit with a beautiful black bowtie, hair tousled to look unkempt but it suited him so well. And those eyes, oh God... Those eyes were so big and brown, they looked like they held the universe in them. Tony's big, expressive orbs were probably the best feature on his face, complementing the rest of his beauty. He was suave, charming and witty, he held conversations with grace and fluidity, making the other person feel genuinely listened to and spoken with.
Tony hangs up and feels a wave of relief that he successfully manoeuvred Bruce. A pang of guilt roils in him about that though. Well, it's just an addition to the feelings already there.
Before he could get a response, he cuts the call and throws the phone on the table and cradles his head in his palms for a while as Rhodey puts a hand on his shoulder, squeezing it slightly.
Tony had fooled himself long enough. He lived and breathed this illusion of happiness for far too long and now, he's going to break out of it. For once in this marriage, Tony was finally going to do what was right by him and what was right for him.
He licks his lips with a bone-dry tongue and breathes a sigh through his mouth. Just one drink, he thinks and begins to saunter to the bar when the door clicks and creaks to open. His eyes shoot to the door, realising what he's doing, and then he turns his full frame back to the window, pinching himself on the wrist with nails untill he feels blood. It's his punishment for giving into this age old sin, one that has always threatened him at every single stage of life, ever since he was probably of age 14.
Tony clears his throat and settles the empty mug on the table before leaning forward and turning around back onto the couch, facing Rhodey.
Tony just huffs out a sigh and stifles a sniffle. Disgust crawls through him as he realizes he's here, patching up the man who fucking broke him to pieces. He hates himself so much right now.
"I could conceive because I had given up drinking. I took up my job better, because I stopped drinking. I watched my son grow up into this amazing human being because I stopped drinking. Little boy grew up and went off to MIT. I could experience all those joys.... because I stopped drinking."
Steve knows he can't do this alone. He needs some help and frankly, Natasha has been his best friend at SHIELD ever since he started working there. They've been through thick and thin with each other for the last 4 years since the two of them got transferred together from California.
When they separated, both whined at the loss of contact and they ended up pecking each other on the lips multiple times, evoking wet smooching sounds from another in dramatic effect.
He heaves a sigh and backs up the car, before bolting out of the basement and turning a right towards his house.
An ache settles within his gut as he leans against the headboard and observes Bucky's face, twisted with pleasure as he grinds down on him, eyes closed and mouth lax and open.
The phone stops ringing with a last vibration. Rhodey peers over at Tony, unimpressed as Tony just grins apologetically.
He looks at the band one more time and anger flares up in his chest. He wants to burn this goddamn thing and let it perish as he watches. Watches the flames burn fierce and cruel, singing the craphold this thing had on him, which was ineffective on the person who put it on him.
Tony dabs and rubs much more gently this time and even manages to patch up Steve's back, which fortunately has two or three cuts.
"I've got your toys and they're safe. I hope you guys stay safe too. I wish you and the rest of them good luck.
He slides down the wall slowly and drops down absent-mindedly onto the floor, one move short of completely crumbling.
Rhodey snores a little more, eliciting a chuckle from Tony one more time as he snaps another photo and goes to place the phone on the table, when he feels the buzzing vibrations in his hand.
He remembers when him and Tony used to huddle in the winter months, curled up on the couch together sharing a blanket, their bodies completely intertwined and legs tangled together while something played on the TV. Tony used to rub his warm hands all over Steve's body, through the sweater he wore, as he nuzzled at Steve's neck and placed light kisses on the hollow of his throat, sending tingling sensations fluttering through Steve's body. Steve would wrap Tony up in his arms and press him close, trying to savour his touch and his body heat as he rested his head against Tony's, taking in the wonderful smell of his hair, which always smelled like berries.
He storms out of the car and slams the door, without unlocking it before getting into the elevator and riding it till the floor of the house.
The serum did it's full work, enabling Steve to be there in no time as he came to an almost undignified screeching halt in front of the King.
Or he would drag Tony and Pete into a bear hug, telling them how much he loves them, kissing the two of them with so much ferocity, that one would think they came back from the dead.
A while later, Steve finds Natasha sprawled out on the couch, her legs on the table as she taps away at her phone.
God knows how long this had been happening and he's never confronted Steve. He knows what answers he'll get and he knows why Steve is even staying. It was for Peter's sake, it was the only reason holding this marriage together. This farce of a life they've built as couple was held by the presence of their only child and that was why they stayed. Tony wondered why Steve didn't just divorce him after Peter left, the only obstacle in his path gone. He wondered if all those business trips, he was just staying in that other man's house, snatching away all and any rights Tony had as his other half. Despite all that, Tony tried so hard only to face rejection at every step. He will never be enough for anyone. His father was right at constantly reminding him that it was a fact and now, now he had proof of it. Every insult, every lie, every heartbreak weighed down on Tony now as he just stood there, ruminating on his pitiful, pathetic life.
You know what, now that Peter is no longer an active part, you better confess to Tony and let him off the hook. Else, I swear to God I'll fucking break your kneecaps."
Tony's distracted from his internal battle when the bell rings and he feels his face wet. He scrubs at the dampness, runs a hand through his hair and a finger over his eyebags.
In a lightning fast movement, Steve lifted Tony off the ground and clutched him close, one arm at his chest and another at his waist, Tony's back still to his chest, all the while still nuzzling his goddamn beard through Tony's shoulder blades and nape as Tony sputtered and gasped at the tingling sensation from behind.
Steve may have spent most of the night alone, but he found people to talk to as well, and he especially admired Tony's friend, James, who had signed up in the army recently.
He just couldn't believe it, he was dazed into a stupor while his mind vehemently denied that his marriage is no longer sanguine. He remembers furious tears escaping his eyes, his stomach churning and making him hurl on the grass outside untill he fell to his knees and clutched the pavement.
It was sweet and sensuous, Tony going soft and pliant under Steve's firm but tender ministrations as their bodies rocked together in mutual pleasure, savouring the smell and taste of each other, with passionate desire and near carnal lust as well as their devotion to one another, seen in every aspect of their togetherness.
The world and all it's institutions are flawed, which Tony accepts, graciously, knowing that for many years he too was an active part of that flawed system and that he himself has flaws.
"And now, twenty years later, I've gone every single day without a drink or having the police escort me to my house.... Or a jail cell. Ugh! Those things were filthy."
Tony leaned over and palmed the soldier's massive erection through his briefs, rubbing a thumb over the pulsating length. He grabbed the girth and jerked Steve through the cloth, sounding off a moan from him. Grabbing the waistband by his pinkies, Tony pulled down the poor briefs, slowly and excruciatingly, deigning to set the aching cock free.
He looks up at the man and recognizes that same beautiful face, contorted with worry and pain. His eyebrows knitted together to form a crease smack dab in the middle of them. The wrinkles on his forehead non-existent. The bridge of his nose popping out and nostrils flaring and he sees his plush, deep pink lips, frowning, which are now surrounded and marked with short hairs. He has a beard now, thick and dark and luscious, masking the super-soldier's diamond-cut jaw and perfectly shaped cheekbones. He looks raw and ravishing, like a golden lion, come here to stake claim on Tony's poor, battered heart.
Tony places a chaste kiss to Steve's sternum before curling into his body and then feels a blanket drape over them.
Steve swallows again and ducks out through the door of the bedroom, tiptoeing down the stairs and heads out of the house through the back door, quietly shutting it close before latching it from the inside.
Whenever they'd get into a tiff, the blonde would scream and hover over Tony threateningly as if he was about to hit him, and once he almost did. He apologized immensely after that, trying to pepper him with kisses and dinners until he took Tony out on vacation to the Canadian Alps.
By the time, he reached his house, he was gasping and panting as he hunched forward and landed his palms on his knees for support. Drops of liquid fell from his body onto the pavement below and he couldn't wonder whether it was tears or sweat or snot.
It's slow at first. Tears trickling down his face and chin, dropping onto the floor beneath his propped up legs and then it gets a little more intense, as his breath hitches and his heart clenches tightly in its cage, unable to take the pain anymore.
Steve stopped to press a light kiss to the head of hair beneath his chin and he turned to the left to glance at the sight of the clock lying on the bedside table, gleaming the digits 7, 0 and 8 in a fluorescent blue.
Else, he's going to force Tony to return home from wherever he is, trying to fucking stake claim of ownership on him, even after everything.
"You should've seen yourself passed out here. Could I photoshop into..... what do these kids call it.... uh, yes, ah! Could I photoshop you into a meme?"
Tony's dragged out of his thoughts by what sounds like an even louder snore from the man above him, causing waves of chuckles at the sight of his platypus before bringing his phone out to snap a photo.
Steve's heart sinks as he thinks of the aftermath of his decision. He needs to fucking man up and tell Tony the truth. He doesn't know who he's gonna choose, but he has to tell Tony.
He opens the door of his room, as slow as he could, to avoid creaking and he tiptoes inside going straight into the bathroom.
He can hear the faint drag of his index finger along the brown paper making a characteristic soft rippling which he pays attention to, almost as if in sort of a trance.
The world only sees Tony Stark as an arrogant, vain CEO who's probably got a stone in place of his heart, or worse, just a void.
Steve washes up and brushes his teeth. He throws off his clothes, leaving only his boxers on and glances at his reflection in the mirror.
Tony draws in a sharp breath and draws his hand back to toss this ring against the glass but, he stops midway. He heaves a sigh and ends up placing it on the surface of the table drawers, smack dab in the middle.
Peter reminded Tony of himself and Steve, like he's their lovechild, with an intellect like his and mannerisms like Steve's. Steve thinks Tony would love Wakanda and their technology, which would send him gaga.
Steve smiles at the script, knowing exactly how Tony's handwriting wavers from beautiful calligraphy in his signatures to haphazard scribbling whenever he was working on something in his workshop and needed to jot the idea down or do math, which always flew over Steve's head.
That was all it took for Steve to wait out till every guest left, leaving behind only Tony and a few of his friends.
His hair is unkempt, the blonde strands having grown a little longer and his stubble much thicker, covering his entire face and chin.
Tony realises his voice is laden with panic and flinches a little, feeling even more disgusted with himself at showing concern.
Steve's point of view of his past with Tony, their relationship and their familial life until it came crashing down.
He's cried enough for the past two years, every night, into his pillow, trying to convince himself that Steve loved him.
"Steven, please, please, just answer me. Just look at me and tell me if you're banging someone else or not. Please, Steve, just tell me."
And about Bucky, I don't know what the deal is between you two but I'm telling you this Steve, it's been a long time in coming.
Tony hissed as the cool air of the lab grazed the skin of his butt and he bit his lips in anticipation, the sensation sending pulses through his spine.
Steve just chuckled before placing a chaste kiss to the small of Tony's back and then he did something that Tony fucking almost fell forward and broke his head.
When he fucking first saw Steve goo-goo eyeing him at that speech, Tony took one glance and fell for him like a bag of bricks. Because that's Tony, right? He gets attached too fast and so intensely that it always comes back to bite him in the ass.
Tony's back is to him and he's wearing one of Steve's white gym tees that hung so loose around him, it looked like they were about to fall off his small frame. Coupled with that, he wore those beautiful azure form-fitting yoga pants which Steve loved. They accentuated those beautiful fucking legs of his and that taut peach of an ass..... Fucking marvelous, Steve grinned to himself.
Tony giggled at that and Steve felt his heart bloom in childish joy hearing that voice sounding so carefree for a while. Tony only did that for him. Only him. That made Steve's heart constrict a bit more as he took in the sight of Tony, snickering like a baby while stretched out so beautifully for him.
And so, the happy family went on with their life, cherishing each other and loving one another unconditionally as the years went by.
After the speech, Steve congratulated Tony and shook his hand, where they lingered in that position for quite a while. They made light conversation about themselves and a little about the here-and-there happenings and what not.
His head is thrown back as his arms line the head and the armrest of the couch. One leg of snuggled between Tony and the cushions, while another is stretched out below. He's snoring lightly and if you peer close, you can see the line of drool running from the corner of his mouth and pooling in at the shirt, creating a huge wet patch.
Bucky's passed out over the mattress, faceplanting into the pillows as he's stretched out under a blanket. His face is towards the bedside window, away from Steve and the door behind him.
Honestly, Steve can never say he got a full eight or more hours of sleep except for when he was with Tony.
"After everything, I can't hate him, Rhodey. I cannot. I can't even fathom hating him or getting back at him. I left everything for him. I went against my parents for him. Oh God....."
He grabs the remainder of his items and shoves it in a duffel, and triple checks if he's got everything he needs. He grabs his keys from the hook and checks his pockets for his phone, his wallet, his cards, yep, well I'm done.
Still, Tony cannot hurt him, never could he do that. Neither physically nor emotionally. It's unsettling watching someone do that to another and have no sense of empathy or even remorse of the undue hurtful consequences of their actions towards the other person's feelings and emotions.
Tony looks up at Steve and sees him staring at him, in part awe and part heartbreak. Those big bloody baby blues are glazed over and Tony tries so fucking hard not to look at that.
As Steve pistons his cock into Tony, he shudders violently as the full force of his orgasm whammies him like a baseball bat to the face. His cock pulses furiously as he unloads his hot seed into Tony's warm, velvet cavern, filling him up and claiming him as his own.
Tony groped, worshipped and kissed his way across Steve's chest, feeling the soft small hairs grazing his palm as they roamed gently and massagingly. He worshipped the muscled mounds, sucking on those beautiful pink nipples or pinching them between the rolling movements of his deft fingers. Steve was a gasping, quaking mess, his chest was always sensitive but his nipples even more so and Tony was being so lovingly rough with them, Steve could feel his own cock harden and leak in between shockwaves that coursed through his body. He bit down on his fist, while the other was latched as tight as possible in Tony's hair, guiding or pressing his head further. Steve could feel Tony smirk against his skin.
He nods back at Carol before looking up to address the crowd as he sees the multitude of faces, some new and some old.
Tony fiddles with the glass piece lodged right in the middle of Steve's chest. He manages to slowly yank it out before pressing the giant wet tuft to the spot and instructs Steve to hold it there for a while.
Or he would hold Tony's hand so tightly whenever they were out, because Steve was always uncomfortable with the press as they made him so nervous.
He always feared that Steve would one day fall out of love with him, recognizing Tony as useless as he always felt.
Right now, Tony just needs a break from his thoughts. He just needs a break from the reality of his life and as much as he can't seem to sleep, he's going to try.
He remembers him just climaxing in him and leaving to go clean himself up. No kiss, no words, nothing. Just a sigh aimed at his nose, the hot breath infuriating him, reminding him that another is also the receiver of these notions.
The man looks up at Tony and sees his face laced with concern and sorrow. He smiles weakly before Tony ruffles his hair with both hands and settles down on his cheeks, lingering, feeling the thick bush of hair again, now adorning them. A small part of Tony wants to just slap him so goddamn hard but another part wants to soothe him, to run his hands through his hair and face. Steve hooks his hands on Tony's waist and peers at him. He doesn't pull Tony any closer.
"You know, I didn't want to believe it when I saw it. I couldn't fucking believe that this was the truth. This was why you barely saw me, barely stayed at home or even gave me attention because you were off getting your rocks on with someone else. I just hurled onto the ground and collapsed before I had to come home, running like a rabid dog and take my medication so that I don't pass out from my arrhythmia. Did you even notice that I took all my things and left? Did you even bother looking into anything? Honestly, Steve do you even care about us? Do you?"
Steve goes down one floor to Tony's lab, thinking that Tony's passed out there on the couch or still awake, tinkering at some machine or running schematics for a new invention.
Tony dabs the cotton at the nicks on Steve's legs, starting off with gentle taps before rubbing down on the wound with a little pressure.
Their communication dropped drastically and so did the time they spent together. They never got much time together, their work life playing the major factor and when they did get time, Tony remembers snuggling up against Steve, the pair wrapped in warm blankets, watching TV as Peter watched in somewhat light disgust and minor adoration.
Fear grips Steve with iron claws that dig into his spine, thinking of Tony and having to break the news to him.
I didn't even know about this affair until a few months. Honest to god, I never expected it. No word of it came out to the press and neither did you tell me. I fucking wanted to see how long you'd keep this garbage act up until you keened. But, I guess even you can act, Steve.
The adrenaline was roaring through Steve as he took out each and every one of the agents and destroyed their tech. He might've been upset that these maggots still lived but all that channeled into terrifying rage when he went all out on those fuckers. He would not stop, he's never going to stop until he takes out every single one of them.
Steve can feel his climax inching closer and closer. Tony's whines accelerate it until he can feel nimble hands on his chest and Tony's fingers are at his nipples. Tony twists those delicious pink buds, twirling and pressuring because he knows Steve fucking loves getting his tits worshipped even when he's fucking the daylights out of Tony.
He casts all his thoughts to hell and steps to the door, unlocking the latches with multiple sharp clicks as he drags out his luggage onto the porch and locks the door, turning the key twice and hearing the loud clicks and bangs and turns of knobs or cogs.
Tony shifts closer, using his knees, to the soldier, a few inches away from his visage, their hands still locked, and continues speaking.
Steve's feral intensity built up as he began to bite and lick at Tony's neck and shoulders, sending waves of pleasure-pain throughout the mechanic.
Their marriage was considered ideal by the public. They were much adored but also frowned upon by a few, claiming that it wouldn't last and naming Tony's old flirtatious habits as the reason.
The family decided to move to New York as Steve got promoted to director of national security and was the head of their new division, S.H.I.E.L.D. It worked for their favour as Tony could head the new sector of his company on the eastern seaboard and Peter could get better opportunities as a student.
Tony willingly complied, though he was upset at the loss of contact and leaned forward, legs still wrapped around Steve's thighs and then felt his pants being pulled down, slowly.... God, Steve was one hell of a tease.
"Do you want me to intervene? I sure will, I'll shoot him and that homewrecker through the head. Do you want me to do that, Tones? I got the rifle and the bullets out."
Tony jolts out of his thoughts and feels the cold concrete at his back sucking all the heat from his body and slowly turning him into a damn corpse.
Steve buttons his pants and pulls his shirt down. He smooths a hand over the fabric and readjusts his collar, picks up his jacket and perches it in the crook of his elbow before taking one last look at Bucky.
The other man just nods before swallowing, as Tony sees his Adam's apple bob from under his chin, head tilted in defeat.
Tony grimaces a bit and heads to the kitchen, to grab a glass of water and returns to see Steve hunched over, his bandaged hands bunched together in a fist.
Here's the news, Cap. I was walking around the neighborhood when I saw you and that tramp motorboating each other through the window."
"You know, there was a time I couldn't live without booze. I mean, I started drinking at 15 and that was when I joined college, so you know, I'd feel like I needed to have a drink every now and then, then soon I'd need it every week and that slowly became every night. Every night, I'd need a glass of scotch burning down my throat. Then, I was 21 and the bad news happened and I think I can positively point out that that was my turning point. You know, everything spiralled from there. Hell, I was pretty tipsy at my own wedding. When the priest saw my face, he took a whiff and asked "Glenlivet?". I remember I burst out laughing right before I keeled over on Steve's shoes. Hey, the man still married me, so what the fuck was he thinking right?"
He hears footsteps approach, and he can sense their quiet placing, the thump of a shoe on the marble and he audibly notices their din becoming minutely louder with each step. They stop after a while, and he hears the sound of soles shuffling on the panelled wooden flooring, where he stands. Tony's eyes instinctively shifting to the side where the shuffle of feet comes from.
He would play with Peter as much as he could, whenever he got time until the two of them passed out wherever they were, with Pete curled into Steve's arms or lying on him so sweetly that it would melt Tony's poor heart into a puddle.
I'm going to go over to Rhodey's and I'll figure something out. I'll send the papers over in a week."
"Listen here, Steve. I don't know what the fuck is going on with you and Tony. I know it's been fucking two years since this crap started. And, I really hoped you were a better man than what you appeared."
He would be such a good father to Peter, chatting and laughing with their son, that Tony forgot his own woes with Steve as he gazed at them and felt a whirlwind of familial contentment settle into him, knowing that at least their child was not affected.
Thank you for reading! I'll try and update as regularly as I can. I'll also inform you how I'm going to split this series.
Tony closed his eyes and cried again. He choked back his sobs and bit his tongue from whimpering. He must've been there for what felt like hours untill he slowly got to his feet and started jogging. The jogging slowly evolved pace and he was running and then he was sprinting to his house, determinedly all the while more tears crawled down his cheeks and snot clogged his nose, as he fought to breathe through his nostrils and settled to do so via his mouth.
A thought comes to Tony as he picks up the phone and rebukes the other end in his most media-friendly derogatory voice:
"Tony, I... I'm.....". There is a long pause and he can hear sharp breaths drawn in and released in quick succession. Tony closes his eyes. He once reveled in that beautiful, deep voice but now..... now he's just terrified of it. It sends goosebumps flaring across the length of his skin, right from the base of his neck to the small of his back; trembling a bit. Even his smart ass doesn't know what to expect anymore from this situation or any situation further.
Despite the hipster get up, there is no glint in his aquamarine eyes, they look tired and remorseful. Bags have formed under his eyes, a sign of sleepless nights, which even the serum could not heal and his whole body is hunched morosely.. A shell of what he was. Tony's heart clenches at the sight.
He wonders why he stopped. He can't pinpoint the reason or even justify the notion. A gnawing grief grows in his chest, soon morphing into an ache of sorts which he cannot define. Maybe it's his affection for Steve or maybe it's his own foolishness, beckoning him to offer another chance at rekindling the lost aembers of their love as testament to their journey of so long.
Tony disconnected his mouth for a bit, a long, heavy slime of spit establishing contact between his puffy pink lips and Steve's furiously aching cockhead. The sight itself was so glorious for Steve that he grabbed the base of his own length and smeared the spit all over Tony's lips and mouth, guiding his head with the hand already there. Steve sought Tony's will before letting Tony engulf his cock once again and sat back, letting him set the pace.
The other man's raised brows drop down before he glances at the clock again while settling back into his pillow and throwing an arm onto his forehead.
Tony caught sight of that marvelous dong Steve whooped out, it's thick, enormous length flushed a beautiful pink while the foreskin covered head took on a deep red, pulsing angrily, matching Steve's kiss stained lips. The vein on the underside throbbed in anticipation, leaking a big globule of precum through that delicious slit. At the sight of that delicious cock, Tony's own length pulled up and twitched achingly against his abdomen. He felt himself leaking too and Tony was well endowed for sure, but Steve's little monster would intimidate anyone.
Tony accepts and stars gulping the water as soon as it hits his tongue. The cool, refreshing sensation settles in his throat and calms down the upstart of a cough slowly. It relaxes Tony as he laps it up hungrily and finishes the whole glass.
Steve's face lights up and he draws Tony in close, locking their chests, almost crushing him as he whispers sweet thank yous and I love you's into Tony's ears. He clasps his arms around Tony's waist tightly and buries his face in his neck, savouring the sweet smell of blueberries and coconut and cologne that Tony always gave off.
Complemented by his dirty brown blond hair, which is longer and unkempt now, looking like a hand is all that graced their length, the super-soldier looks wild, but he's still apple pie and hot cocoa, melting Tony's heart and his breath to hitch in his chest at the sight of this man.
Steve's build always impressed him, right from the start but now he wants nothing more than to butcher all that beef with a cleaver.
Tony throws the phone on the table as the ringing continues and jabs at Rhodey's jaw. He shakes his shoulders vigorously and slaps the sleeping man's chest, all the while calling his name.
He begrudgingly takes a sip of the piping hot decoction, ignoring the burn of it on his tongue and down his throat, as he glares out into the orange hue of the evening sky, through the balcony window.
Tony remembers that same voice, whispering garbled nonsense in his ear, as the person it came from rocked on top of him that night in Clint's farm, when they confessed hidden emotions and bared themselves to each other right down to the bottom of their soul. It was one hell of a confusing day when the feelings of confusion and regret were high, but that one night seemed so right to Tony. The hot, vicious pleasure he felt bubbling through his every nerve ending, every fiber of his body as they passionately and devotedly made such furious love, which was long overdue. That night, Tony felt like he was finally blessed with something good after the horrible events that presided it, as he nuzzled into that comfortable neck and felt big, rippling arms envelop him protectively and hold him so close.
His suit's torn in a few places where there were cuts and scrapes or maybe even a few wounds, all of that having healed with not a trace of their occurrence, thanks to the serum. The shield is perched in its leather straps, encompassing his aching back.
Steve just drags a hand through his hair and heaves a sigh. He can feel his lungs constrict even more and his heart thump in its cage.
The twin glass doors slide open as silently as they could, revealing Tony's disarrayed haven, with pieces of tech scattered on the large tables and DUM-E attending on the side.
Steve smiled and nodded in response, pecking Tony's lips as his hands cradled his head. Steve flipped over to the side and laid down on his back, bending an arm underneath his head.
"Like I said, he's always away from home. He comes home late at night, Rhodes. It's like he's been avoiding me on purpose. Am I that fucking horrid that someone has to avoid me for almost three whole years? I couldn't take it anymore. And after what I saw today, I just can't. I want this to end."
Steve wasted no time and freed his aching cock from behind the zipper, followed by his balls and coated it with spit and some lube from Tony's pucker.
Tony's arms latched onto Steve's hair and he pulled the strands tightly, earning a low growl from the soldier as he continued plundering Tony's mouth with his, licking into his mouth with animalistic claim.
Steve nods in response and presses a kiss to Tony's palm which was on his cheek and holds his hand with both of his, clutching them close to his chest. His heart is thumping now, he's elated that Tony's forgiven both of them but he understands his need for space. Steve will always respect Tony's wishes, no matter what.
His mind's eye shows him Tony, shocked into silence when Steve breaks it to him. His big brown eyes, glazed over, filled with disbelief; those eyes, that have always been Steve's weakness as they showed every emotion Tony wanted to display and didn't as well. The varying degree of sensitivity in them encompassing Tony's soul, which was once pure, but is now tainted because of Steve's actions.
Tony's eyes open wide at the screen of the phone, the bright white light showing the incoming call making them sting and burn.  He's tuned out the loud ringing emanating from it, resounding within the entire house.
Congratulatory applause falls in line, loud and raucous, in appreciation of Tony for his bravery and his tenure in AA. The applause lingers for a long, long time before dying out.
Bucky bottoms out finally and twirls his hips, as he grabs onto Steve's jaw and cheek. A groan draws out from Steve's chest as he grabs Bucky's hips and lifts him, before dropping him down oh so slowly.
"And after what I found out in that bunker, I realized I'm still last. Even to you. If you really did know me well, you'd know that I would have done everything in my power to help you find your friend. Sure, it would've taken me a while to consider it, but you knew Steve, you knew that I would have done ANYTHING for you. And this was long before Sokovia or the Accords. Long before, our team's situation was compromised.
They got real close as they worked more and more together. Nat seemed to project a tough exterior, result of the constant war she's waged against the world, but deep down, she was a huge softie.
Good old James listened to every word Steve said and took it with great interest, sometimes asking a question here and there. It made Steve's heart swell with pride that there were people this patriotic even to this day.
"Jesus, fuck, Tony, you're... You're so fucking beautiful sweetheart. I love you. I love you so much, Tonyyyyyy.."
He glances over in the rearview mirror and settles his hair with one hand before he gets out of the car and gets into the elevator, pressing the button for floor 5.
Steve chuckles in response and he thinks his cock got harder inside Tony, courtesy to the genius's lusty ministrations. Each time he yanks Tony down on him, Steve hears Tony's delicious whines that intermingle with his kisses and licks through Steve's face, making Steve go hotter than before.
The script is near flawless and looks so beautiful that Steve knows Tony took his time to write this down and elucidate his feelings, which was good. It was better than Tony drowning his sorrows in alcohol and sleeplessness, at this point, all tantamount to Steve's doing.
Tony rotates himself a full semicircle on Steve's cock and turns to face him and Steve's looking at him like he's a fucking masterpiece.
And then it morphs into silent sobs followed by loud, choked wails as he cries into the crook of his arms, his lungs and vocal chords fighting untill he feels his throat go dry and his mouth slack.
Bucky, envigored by Steve's permission, begins his ministrations and begins pumping himself full of Steve's hot length, as they both moan in unison.
This point of view is going to be split into two parts. The next one will deal with Steve's infidelity and what he feels.
Steve studies his reflection in the shiny elevator door and only one thing can describe him- he's a mess.
There's a long pause as Steve just sits there, hanging his head and scratching the table with his fingers.
Natasha rises from the couch, swiftly and slams the door behind her as she leaves Steve to deal with his own fate.
"When I was his PA, he was probably at the peak of his drinking. He'd be so drunk he wouldn't even come to meetings. Do you even know what he'd babble about whenever he was like that?
"Tones, I think you need to confront him. We need to get this over with. You've borne this for what, three years almost? And that's just for how long you know. God knows how long that rat bastard's been keeping this from you."
"I cannot blame him. I've tried to but I cannot. He was just a weapon. I have to make amends to both of you, especially him. I've drawn up a prototype for another arm and I'm willing to help in any other way possible. Therapy. Rehab. You name it. I'm willing to give us another chance and try again. Not only as teammates and Avengers. I still love you, Steven, and I always will."
Tony can clearly see the writing on it - and the first thing sees is the number 20, emboldened deep, circumferenced within a circle as the words 'One Day at a Time' surround it in lighter tone.
Tony startles upward, almost hitting his head to the roof of the car when he hears a knock on the window.
A vicious part of Tony expects to hear another set of footsteps, having taking advantage in lieu of his temporary absence.
Part of him might've wished that Tony did earlier but hey, he can't complain because Tony's not the one who walked out.
They stay like that for a while, Steve not having the bone to look at Tony and Tony not having the courage to look anywhere else but at Steve.
Tony continued tinkering at whatever it was, his arms grabbing the tech and another looked like it was twirling a screwdriver or a wrench. Steve couldn't pay attention to whatever it was except for the do-er of the task. Tony's hips sashayed with each twist of his arm and that was all Steve could control himself before he stormed forward and wrapped himself around the mechanic's waist and pressed his lips into the nape of his neck with a long kiss.
He looks around the hall, and then searches the dining and then the kitchen. Then, he looks in their bedroom and then Peter's.
He's just exhausted. He's tired of the shitstorm outside and inside, he just needs a break so desperately but he can't take one. He's got friends to save, people to acquit and forgive and graves to apologize to….
Only Steve could drive him this crazy. Make him feel this intense and this safe. Like he's in a cocoon of debauchery.
The man comes forward and kneels down in front of him, to assess the situation. He hurriedly runs and returns with a glass of water and holds it up to his lips.
Tony heard some hissing and turned to see Steve’s little fuck body glowering at Clint who was trying to corral them into the aquarium that Tony built. Their were six of them and a baby, who Steve was currently carrying.
“ Can you believe all the things we have to do today? It’s ridiculous! How are we going to get everything done today?” Steve whined as he brushed Tony’s hair.
“ Are you shitting me?” This was not right. He had to get out of here. Tony looked out of the corner of his eye and saw rows of suits. He just need to get over there...
“ Jesus fuck! I’m awake! I’m awake!” Tony shouted as he tried to shake the cold water from his body that was doused on him.
Bucky was shaking his head. “ Man you always had some weird tastes.  If you don’t like him. We could always return him.”
Peter pushes himself onto his elbows and noticed he was in his NASA sweater and blue sweatpants. He immediately gets embarrassed as he saw Harry basically naked expect for a pair of Calvin Klein boxer briefs. My god did he look like a model, Peter thought.
Bucky started to laugh. “ Man this is priceless!   You are so lovey Dovey right now! I can’t wait to tell Sam!”
“ Boy, quite your mumbling. I sent you to the finest private schools so that you may master that English language. No speak properly. And secondly nothing is wrong with Dr. Strange. He was one of the finest surgeons in the world. May you could learn a thing or two from him.”
“ So do playboys yet I don’t hear you giving them any shit about it. Yes Tony is different, not just his sexuality. The man lives off coffee and is the smartest person I know. But he is kind and is a decent human being that wants to make a word a better place.”
Fury nodded. “We have found a Hydra base and there seems to be at least two more creatures who appear to be similar to Winghead. We intend to rescue them and quickly. One of those is a merman who is being currently used as an operative and is responsible for sinking two Chinese  military ships this past week. We would like to prevent further casualties and are therefore are requesting that you leave tonight.”
“ What? If it doesn’t stick like that then you will at least get some wrinkles. I know your expensive skin creams won’t fix-Ow!”
Bucky gave an exasperated sigh. “ Stevie, can you move your royal ass? He’ll be here when you are done now come on.” Bucky grabbed Steve by his shirt collar and began to move him to the door.
Peter turned around and saw Harry running toward him. Once he reached him, Peter noticed how red in the face he looked as he panted heavily.
Winghead cooed in response. In dove back in the water as he noticed Tony walking to the gate. Bruce waited behind him as Winghead pulled himself up and onto the beach. It was a strange design. Instead of sloping gently into dry sand, it was more similar to the structure of the pool where Winghead would have to pull himself up and onto the sandy surface. He purred as Tony approached.
With that Tony hung up on him.  He sighed again and ran a hand through his hair. He better head back. God knows what those two will do to one another. There was an immediate dislike between the two when they first met. This other Captain America, or a Captain Hydra since he was dressed in a black suit with the Hydra label on his chest and a matching black shield with the Hydra insignia, Just strutted into his lab as Steve and him were discussing some case files that SHIELD had shipped over. All hell had broke loos after that as Steve had taken the offensive and picked up his own shield and charged after the intruder. He dodged easily and threw down his shield and yielded. He looked directly at Tony and told him he would do anything as long as he could talk to him.
“Why is that agent? Winghead not warming up to you?” Tony remembered that Fury had mentioned that Coulson had tried to have Winghead interact with him.
“ Im leaving. Stay here if you like,” Tony snapped As he headed toward the elevators. A blur of white rushed passed him and nearly knocked him over. When tony looked up he saw Barnes there whining and jumping from one paw to the other impatiently.  God he was really regretting this already.
That was when the alerted blared overhead. Thank god. Another mission. Tony couldn’t have been more relieved than to hear that.
Tony Gave him a sheepish smile and pushed his hair back from his face and over than face piece of his deactivates suit.
Tony drew out a folded piece of paper from the back pocket of his jeans and held it out toward Bruce. He took it gingerly as if he were afraid it might attack him. He opened it up and read it.
“ Rhodey?” He said in disbelief. The figure turned toward him and Tony saw the familiar features: the chiseled jaw line, the dark eyes, the broad shoulders.
When they finally stopped, Tony was starting to feel pins and needles in his legs. The doors where opened and one of the men dragged Tony out. He looked around and saw a gravel driveway leading to a large estate. The lawn was healthy green and well cared for. The perimeter of the area was enclosed by a stone wall. Above the wall he could sea a thick sea of dark green trees.
He said he couldn’t believe it and then walked out of the house. I thought it was over but then he came back a couple days later. He was waiting in the kitchen eating cereal. He told me to pack my bags and that if I didn’t listen my sister would be lynched.
“ Well I don’t like it. Last time he called us like this, we ended up dragging back Ariel. And that was a bitch to deal with.” Sam complained.
Maria looked at Tony who was still smiling broadly. “ You seem to be in a good mood dear. Why is that?”
“Platypus be nice with Stevie. He wanted to take me out to have some fun. And I want him to be here. He’s being supportive.”
Steve reaches over and grabbed it and tossed it on the bed. Steve balances himself over Tony and began to kiss him. Tony only kissed back as he knew it will keep him in a good mood. Last time he refused to kiss him and bit him, the Steve clone pouted and had turned Bucky into a punching bag. So, hence the kissing.
“ Protocol? Are you fucking for real? I just want to scare my little Tony not kill him! I made that very fucking clear he was not to be harmed!”
“ Shh... it’s ok babe, I didn’t mean to scare you. You don’t have to be nervous.”Steve cooed as he placed a hand on his upper thigh.  Tony didn’t even realize how scared he got.
“ Which reminds me...” Howard yanked off the head peace roughly off Tony’s head, “ I’ll keep this for now so you won’t get into anymore trouble.”
So the suit was in okay condition. It turned out Ultron he been. Trying to fix it. Tony has to admit he was smart, but he was as Clumsy as Dum-E. So he made him do diagnostics. Then Steve was cowering in te corner looking up at him hopefully. It was real distracting. So he got relegated to being Tony’s gopher and running to get him things around the workshop. And Tony swears if he had a tail it would be wagging.
Steve Gave an exasperated sigh and looked up toward Tony. Tony noticed his eyes were red and swollen, almost as if he had been crying.
Peter shook his head. “ You can go, I have to get home after school. I’m... babysitting tonight.  Well I better get to class.” Peter said quickly before he dashed off.
It had been sometime since their last dreadful encounter and Steve wasn’t going to let this opportunity go. This was the first time he had the opportunity to actually talk to him.
The elevator pinged as the doors open. “ Tony I got your message. What up- Bucky ?” Steve stopped mid step as he looked up from his phone and saw his long lost love in the couch.
“ Tony... if I scared you or offended you somehow.... I’m really sorry. Please let me know what I did wrong.  I’m really worried and I promise not to do it again. Just let me know that you are okay.” It sounded as if his voice cracked a little at the end. There was a lot of emotion behind his words. Tony sighed and let his head hit the wall that was behind him. He was going to die an early death. He had no sense of self preservation what so ever. No wonder he was always down in medical. Hell, he because of that freaking lack of self preservation he ended up in an alternate reality.
Tony cowered out of reflex, and further into Maria’s embrace.. It wasn’t because this Howard would hurt him. But the one in his universe would often beat him when he was this mad.
For fucks sake the guy asked him he he had any incontinente issues besucase of his age and needed  what Steve called “ alternative adult underwear.” He did not need a freaking diaper. He could piss and shit just fine.
Steve was balancing himself over his body. He looked down at him, smiling, with sweat gathering in his brow. Tony nodded, signaling that he was ready.
Tony continued to watch them bicker among themselves with Steve acting as the occasional mediator. He tried to get Tony to talk, but after a few head nods and shrugs, Steve figured that he just didn’t want to talk.
“ You were in pain yesterday. You couldn’t even hold a damn plate. Earlier this week your hand spasmed around your girlfriends neck when you were kissing her. Next time I may not be there to help.”
Winghead looked up at him, seeming a little disappointed at the name and looked back. Bucky was already pulling himself up. He wasn’t growling or hissing and seemed to be a bit wide as he shyly approached them.
“ This fundraiser is for the children’s hospital in Brooklyn. Come on Buck, it’s for the local kids.” Steve said.
Also I am looking for a Peter x Tony fanfic. Tony starts talking dirty to him in bed and insults him. It Hurts Peters feelings but he doesn’t say anything as he doesn’t want to upset tony. Please let me know if you know the name:)
Steve smiled. “ You’re a sweet bitch, but that’s fine.”  He flipped Tony over and pulled him up by his hips. “ We werewolves have been doing this for centuries and we enjoy it very well, I think you will too.”
Howard huffed and turned to look back at the water to see Steve. Steve looked at him for a moment and stuck his tongue out at him. Howard laughed and splashed water towards him. “ Punk” he said.
“ Blood tests and Dr. Strange spoke with them. He’s an orphan that Hydra picked up and they decide to adopt. And Strange places a spell on them to temporarily not be able to sing.”
“ So, my bambino, when will we meet him? I can arrange a little dinner somewhere nice. We can go to that French restaurant you like.”
“ Oh...oh fuck...,” Morgan mewled as the tongue lapped greedily at his hole. That is that problem with people. Every fucking guy in the whole world wants you to give him a blow job. They are like ‘just do it, it’s not big deal.’ But then when You wanted someone to eat you out, oh no it’s a fucking problem. They are like ‘ oh is it really sanitary?’
“ Well I understand your point of view. I wouldn’t want to be with Someone who hit me either, but you have to also look at it from his point of view. His mate was in danger and despite him harming you he was worried that you would kill Him. And their kind are often physical with one another to get their point across. So that hot would actually be more of a love tap one someone from their kind to just serve as a warning to not fight. He didn’t anticipate that he would actually hurt you.”
He went to the chair opposite of him, but Steve moved quickly and pulled the chair under the table. It took all of Tony’s will power not to roll his eyes. Of course he would be a gentleman. Tony sat down on the offered chair and let Steve push him back in. Steve then hurried to the kitchen.
Steve nodded and sat down next to Tony he stretched out his hand and Tony flinched. He held his hand mid air for a second before dropping it to his side.
Steve smirked, “ But us Brooklyn boys still knew how to have a good time.” The Brooklyn drawl that Steve suddenly talked In further surprised him.  The man in front of him could be such a player if he set his mind to it. He would have all the women hanging of every word he said. Or men.
Out of all the people it had to be Clint who delivered the food, some spaghetti and garlic knots from Tony’s favorite restaurant. He just snickered surreptitiously and gave him a look that said he would be bringing this up later.
“ That is very true. Tony gets lonely easily. He did one with one of his boyfriends because they kept having to go on business trips and Tony was really missing him.”/p>
A crashing sound came from inside. Pepper looked a Tony, a little bit scared.  He rose to his feet and slipped his hand out of hers. He motioned for her to stay quite as he twisted the dial on his watch to activate his gauntlet. He slipped inside and heard scuffling coming from the kitchen. He raised his hand and watched it silently power up. He saw the fridge  door open and a leg outside from around the kitchen island
Tony turned to the two of them, “ For Christ’s sake it’s just a god damn couples massage. So yes we have to get naked. It’s not a big deal. If you two didn’t want to do it why order it in the first place?”
Tony laid stock still. Even when steve finally when to sleep. He was definitely living with a lunatic.
Hi everyone! Thanks for your support.  I had my first test at school today and I wanted to post a chapter in celebration. Again thanks for your support so far and I hope you keep reading my story.
“ Thank you for that James. Now when were  you going to tell us about you and Tony here? I think you two would make a lovely couple.”
“ You know what I just realized? Aunt Wanda is still hot as fuck. Especially with that mini shirt she was wearing today. And she still has a nice set of tits. How the fuck did she end up with Uncle Vis-ow! Fine I won’t talk about anyone else and how hot there are. Fuck, you didn’t need to bite.”
“ You are allowing the Commander to court you. You have never been with a man before. I can tell. You want something.”
“ If I may sir,  it may be wise to take them. Your slave here suffers from some depression and takes medicine for it. The move and recent changes of households could worsen his condition. His friends are much healthier and may be able to help him acclimate better.”
Steve just rolled his eyes. Tony states around the room and it definitely didn’t look anything like the pristine room of the Captain America from his world. There were bottles of every known alcohol known to man scattered aliens the floor, discarded articles of clothing, cigarette butts and.... was that a male blow up doll? Tony stares at it, a little frightened by the the fact it resembled him so closely.
Tony began to turn heel when he felt a tug on his pants. He looked down and saw Bucky grabbing onto his pant leg, he whined pitifully as he looked up at him with large puppy dog eyes that should not be in any humans face.
“ Yes, we wanted to know if you could us with it. He’s been acting quite aggressive lately and injured Tony’s assistant.” Bruce informed.
Tony smiled down at the baby. “ We can’t have that now can we? Handsome man such as yourself needs a name.”
San was about to answer when the blonde man came barreling in front of him. “ It sounded like Tony was having a panic attack, is he alright?”
“ That asshole wrecked my dads car collection and almost killed us when he shot at us when he thought we were some terrorists. You ducking assholes! I’m outta here!”
“ You seem so confident for a virgin. I mean anyone with any experience would be able to kiss properly. Well can you...”
Tony shook his head and gave him a coy smile. It was time to turn up the charm. “ Nothing would Please me more.”
“ Hey, I’m desperate here. I’m tired of getting my ass handed to me. It’s been three weeks already and it hasn’t gotten any better. “
“ Oh fuck!” He cried out. He brought his leg up and tried to grasp it. It was cramping badly. Damn it, this wasn’t the time for this.
Steve held still as he gripped his hips and held Tony still as Tony tried to squirm to get some friction.
“ Ok. Same thing with Tony. He has to be attracted to someone to have a crush on them. And he’s attracted to you because he has had a crush on you since he was little.”/p>
The girl raised a perfectly sculpted eyebrow. Now that Tony noticed it, they were all dressed nicely and looked well groomed. Additionally they all had the same silver collars around their neck. It looked a lot fancier and lighter than the heavy metal collar he had been forced to wear for so long.
“ Well we will both participate. I mean I have to put it in you. There’s no way you won’t participate.” Steve said with a confused look.
“ Guys Stop! I’m fine!” Tony went up behind Steve and tried to pull him away in vain. Grant landed a right hook in Steve. He tumbled backward and landed on Tony who cried out in pain from the extra weight on him.
“Ahhh. I thought you looked familiar! Your Norman’s boy. My son And I better get going. I just wanted to make sure you weren’t holding him up. You know us Starks: always busy. “
Hydra Steve relaxed. “ Ok. You’re right. Sorry about that Tony.” Steve told Tony he was right and apologized? This guy was from a different universe.
“ He thinks he knows what is best for. I am an adult man god damn it! I was a teenager in MIT and I survived. I know how to take care of myself.” He complained.  Rhodey just handed him another doughnut when he finished his current one.
Peter unlocked his phone and looked for the picture that Harry and sent him of himself. It was easier to just please him then to hear him whine. Peter showed him a picture that Harry sent of him after he had just finished working out. He was shirtless and had sweat dripping down his muscular torso.
“ But it makes you wonder what changed all of a sudden. I mean they were at each other’s throats not too long ago. And now they are like the best of friends. Something just smells fishy here.” Sam mused.
Tony sighed as he took off his tie and jacket. Today was going to be his first date with Winghead aka Steve, according to one asshole wizard. He stripped the rest of the way down as he thought better about wearing a Tom Ford suit with Winghead. He then placed on a full length wet suit. Yep. He won’t care if Winghead got this wet and torn if he decides to beat the shot out of Tony like some of his gruntled dates do.
“ How hard is it to catch him or notice that he is flopping around to the kitchen? He’s a literal fish out of water at that point.”
“ As such, we believe that we need to increase our training to meet the demands of our jobs. We will be meeting three times a week until we see some improvement. Are we clear?” Grant snapped.
“ I’m their defense you were aggressive to two of his colleagues, one of them being a close friend of his. Some you can understand his reservation right?”
Tony began to turn and leave when he heard an excited squeal. He turned and saw Steve flopping toward him, a baby ticked under in one arm but still managing to effectively avoiding Clint.
Hi everyone! Due to the popular demand, I am making a sequel. Here is the first chapter and I hope to read your comments. Also I have two fanfics that I am trying to find and would appreciate any help in finding them.
Tony just threw his arms around him and began to cry, “ I know you’re not my Honey Bear, but you look like him and I miss him so much. I’m so scared, I don’t know anyone and I want to go home.” Tony sobbed and his words probably were incomprehensible but he needed to say them. Seeing him hurt too much. It reminded him of how much he missed his friends. He wanted to go home. He felt gentle hands begin to run soothing circles on his back.
Bruce just shrugged. Tony turned to look at Steve.  “ I need to go back to work. I don’t have time for this shit.” Steve looked at him and just gave him a small shrug as he went back to braiding Bucky’s hair.
Tony excitedly brought his arm closer to look down at it. It was a drawing ( mediocre by Steve’s standards, but it was hard to draw on the thing) of Captain America with his shield  running with Iron Man flying over is head as if they were both running into battle.
He slowly crawled up until it reached his nipple. Peter sighed at the contact as Harry played and teased the nub. He kissed Peters cheek and looked at him in his eyes.  He smiled as he gently stroked his cheek and played with his hair.
There was a snarl to Tony’s back and he turned in time to dodge the two large wolves tumbling into the coffee table.
Hi! I’m finally done. Thanks for your support and I should be finishing up my other story hopefully soon. Again thanks so much!:)
Tony felt Someone stroke his hair and gently call his name. The voice was too deep to be Pepper’s and Rhodey would just shake him violently awake instead. He just wanted to burrow himself further into the blankets, so that’s what he did. Fuck this voice. He wants to sleep.
The Slave-master bowed. “ Forgive me. I just wanted to let you know that I gave Coulson the medication for your new slave.”
“ Wouldn’t he have been happy to see you? I mean you were and probably still are his best friend.” Sam asked.
Coulson smiled as he walked backward to the elevator. “ We need to make sure he’s healthy. And if he’s happy, he will  maker better decisions and make healthier choices. Example not trying to escape Shield and trek across New York in the middle of the night.”
“ He was the one that led the army, Tony. He was the mind behind everything. He is their leader, their king. Bucky’s his second in command.” Wanda finished.
“ Where did they all go?” He asked. The rest of the mermaid clan had been around them earlier but they seemed to have disappear. Winghead just shrugged.
Dinner, Steve explained, was a family affair. It was normal that all the Avengers to eat together with Loki, Pietro and Wanda. Steve explained usually Thor would eat with them, but he had ambassador duties with some ally of Asgard.
Tong dragged him off the bed and dressed him the the spares clothes he had bought for him ahead of time. He forced the man to sit in the couch while he made him a sand which. Tony glared at him as he looked at him with a dopey loves truck look. He already hated this fucker. He sent. A quick text to steve to come out to the pent house. The things he did for him, god why was he such a. Hopeless
“ But it’s not the same. I want to make sure you get the best clothing and we can stop by to get your friends. And that will take quite a bit of time. Ugh!”
He sat on the twin sized mate was that also served as a couch and turned on the TV and began to drink his cup of coffee. Maybe something good was on tonight.
“ What not getting enough action at home and have to live vicariously through the two super soldiers?” Rhodey quipped.
It explore his mouth as Steve fumbled with his belt and the buttons on his jeans. Tony carded just fingers through Steve’s hair and urged him to lay if body on his own.
Steve wasn’t getting up, let alone moving. Bucky stood over Steve for a moment, sniffing him as if to make sure he wouldn’t get back up or if he was dead. When he was satisfied he turned back to Tony.
Nat rested her elbows on the barrier and just stared at the strange couple. “ Clint radioed them to try fish at the other end of the pen. That should give you enough time to make it over here.”
If Steve hadn’t been looking at Tony, he would have thought someone else was speaking to him. Who was this timid man who squared something about watching a movie while he fidgeted and tried to look away from him?
Hi! Thanks for reading my story so far.  I am really happy that I received so much positive feedback for my story. Please leave your comments:) Merry Christmas. :)
“ Tony, maybe you should explain things to him. It will be good for him to have some structure for discipline.” Nat added
He smiled at Tony as he shoved another piece of pie into his mouth. He merman features were gone  and were replaced by more human features.
Tony reaches down between them and began to push up Steve’s shirt until his hands were under the piece of clothing.
Sam rolled his eyes. “ It was a joke and besides” he turned toward Tony, “ Once you go black you can never go back.” He gave Tony a sultry once over and a wink. Bucky and Clint were both wheezing at this point.
Tony glared at him. He really hated to be yelled at. He was not a child. “ You’re right. Because he was not a fucking prick like you.” Tony seethed and walked away. He was done with him. Fuck his plan in trying to seduce the fucking bastard in order to escape this place. He would find another way. He was Tony fucking Stark; he would always find a solution. He slammed the door behind him once he got to his room. He grabbed the pillow off his bed and screamed into it before throwing it against the wall.
Steve gave him a questioningly look. “ Don’t just push it in there! You need to prepare me. Are you nuts? I’ll tear! Bucky open that draw and give me the blue bottle. Yep, that one,”
Steve met the love of his life in a very unconventional way. Steve needed a...physical type of release every some after and Schmidt would always set him up with someone who had the clearance to do so after being thoroughly vetted. But that night was different.
“ Well when I was 21, I was one of the new recruits. I had graduated early from the Academy and got into the division. I wanted to be in that division since my boyfriend of like 3 years had been accepted into that unit that year prior. I wanted us to be able to be together and we were for a time. We often partnered for missions. One mission we were supposed to head out and I got sick that morning so I had to stay behind, he went out with some other person and they ended up going shot out of the sky with some missile. There was no body to recover.”
Tony looked like he was about to say something but Steve was saved when Hill walked in and began their debrief.
“ We are reaching the border and there seems to be an increase of security. I advise you make a right and head to the state park. You can walk across the border from there.”
Harry sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. How the hell did Peter become like this? If he cracks his skull Stark would surely kill him.
Tony looks at him perplexed. “‘Want you more?’ This isn’t a competition. That’s the exact thing I’m tired of.”
Tony wanted to scream. He had been trying to subtly teach Steve to have better sex, but it had been entirely fruitless.  He knew the man was a horny, he was fucking humping a pillow the other night and calling his freaking name. He even continued when he saw Tony awake, he just told him to go back to sleep and continued as if it were no problem at all! How the hell was he supposed to sleep when he basically had someone moaning in his ear? And to make things worse, the man was gaining endurance! Why the hell did he have to gain endurance now that he wasn’t fucking him?! It was a travesty!
“ I’m being serious. I’m tired of this shit especially when  my friends and I are in constant danger. They are trying to help your ungrateful ass and you just keep trying to hurt them.”
“ Can we go to work now and do recon on that shady politician guy or are you going to continue to ogle at Starks ass?”
Them both Tony is currently keeping me company tonight. “ Do you want me to use that wording or that you are currently fucking him?”
Both gave him a horrifying look before running out. “ And remember Jarvis will be making sure you do go there!” Tony shouted after them. Those freaking idiots.
Tony scowled. His tower was state of the art thank you very much.  “ I don’t know Nicki, maybe because you enjoy tormenting me? It would explain all those god damn meetings I have to attend.” He retorted.
Tony took off his clothes. He heard a choked noise from behind him. He turned his head with a raised eyebrow.
Peter took his seat in the back and began to take out his notebook and homework. He liked sitting in the back because it was less likely someone was going to throw something at the back of his head.
“ This is really good Tony. Thanks for the meal.” Grant smiled at Tony and as he chewed happily on the chicken.
Afterwards he kept telling me how grateful he was and how lucky he was that I was there. I thought it was some weird like respect thing and that he was just happy to be out of that hell hole that he had been locked up for a month. I also was pretty sure it was for show since we were in front of quite a bit of military personnel.  I had told him not to worry that it was my honor and I left early that evening on the first flight out to my post in Germany.
He cautiously walked to it and opens the door slowly.  He looked inside and saw another fire lit. He saw a large chest of drawers to the and another door, which he assumed was the bathroom.
“ For being a genius you really are an idiot.” He looked to his left and saw Steve. He didn’t know if it was his Steve or Hydra Steve or another Steve from another universe. He had in dark blue jeans and a white shirt. He wasn’t looking at him, but staring straight ahead.
Tony looked around and saw Steve’s phone on the coffee table. He hurriedly picked it up and dialed Nats number.
Steve turned to Tony and saw him looking at him with a small smile gracing his lips. Steve glared at him.
Steve chuckled. “ Whatever you say. Trust try and order something healthy ok? Pepper mentioned something about you not eating properly again.”
Tony smiled and gave a small wave. “ Don’t look so sad. I’ll see you later. Nite!” Winghead whines loudly, trying to get his attention. Tony ignored it. It was for the best. He couldn’t expect him to stay overnight and attend 24/7 to his needs. He has a company he needs to help run. And as Fury loves rubbing it in his face: he’s just a consultant.
Steve sighed, “ It’s important to get an education. It opens up opportunities. And I want you guys to have the best opportunities available. And Loki your brother wants you in school so perhaps one day you can also act as an ambassador to Earth.”
Tony liked up when he heard voices coming near.  He glared when he saw his jailer at the door. He glared back as he opens the cage and reached inside to grab Tony by the heavy metal  collar around his neck to pull him out. He felt it dig slightly into his skin and he winced in pain.
Maria was sobbing uncontrollably and it broke his heart. Those assholes left him in the medical bay with just Maria. He couldn’t believe it.
Now what the fuck was this? Why did he have a memorial? Was this the future? Did everyone think he was dead? It would explain why everyone was looking at home funny. I mean if he saw a dead person walking around he would definitely freak.... Well he would throw away his liquor and then freak.
Shit. He was down. Someone he was disabled and tony was willing to bet it was the Hydra operative’s doing.
Tony did also notice that Howard really did not like Steve as he somehow added into their conversation how he was a underachieving man that took no pleasure in life. And how much of a “tool” he was compared to Rhodey. Tony could only smile as he felt his father trying to look after his best interest in a very strange way.
He noticed the mermaid loved to cuddle a lot. Whenever Tony was eating, he just curled around him and start to purr. He wasn’t sure of it was a mermaid thing or a Winghead thing. Whatever it was, he made sure he had constant contact with Tony.
Tony undid the tie for his pants before pushing them down to his knees and getting into position. Steve lifted his shirt a bit to give his lower back a kiss. And just like the night before he inserted himself without preamble and began to thrust wildly. Tony felt himself being pushed forward and probably would have fallen forward if it weren’t for the strong hands holding him up by his shoulders.
“ Dude you smell like a French whore! Easy if the fucking cologne,” Clint whined as he tried to cover his nose.
When steve looked at him, there was a dopey grin. He remembered him asking who taught him to eat pussy. Steve Had rather not say as he had never done that before. No omega had been worth it before. Tony had kept begging stating he wanted to sent them an edible arrangement. Steve has laughed and rolled on top of Tony, kissing him.
“ Shit. It’s not you. It’s just that, you deserve to have a good first kiss and that was shitty. Fuck, I just ruined that for you.”
“ Don’t worry mom, he’s clean. He always wears a condom before he screws me. Hell we even use a dam when he eats me out.”
Tony also noticed that the Thor is this world had shorter hair and was much more fit than the one he left at home. Tony watched in embarrassment as his father tried to climb Thor to reach the rifle. The man eventually got tired and gave up. But he made sure to drag Tony with him and away from Steve.
Steve face palms himself.  “ And how is this beneficial? You’ll be scaring him. How is throwing water balloons at Sam from the vents a good idea?”
“ Steve!” Tony called out worriedly. Steve looked at Tony for a moment and Bucky chose that moment to attacked. He lunged forward and tackled His opponent. Steve snarled and attacked back pushing Bucky off of him and biting down on whatever body part he could. The two clamp red and wrestled and threw each other against anything in sight.
Tony was interrupted when the alarms started to blare. Needless to say they were not happy with Dr. Doom and his little stunt at all.
Tony sighed and rested his head on Caps shoulder as the two started to bicker in how they were better in bed. He really could give a shit who was better. Right now he just settle for a measly hand job for his hard on.
“ You fucked me in The ass of the floor of a cabin in front of my father. I think we are past the point of having a romantic night in bed or something like that.”
“ Keep going,” Tony Cried when he get Grant stopped. He must have heard him because he then continued to slow enter Tony.
He then asked if he could take me to breakfast. Maria saved my ass when she said that she needed me actually for another mission which she had put together last minute when she heard about the Winter Solider coming into town.
“ Oh god! I’m sorry. I don’t know what I was thinking.” Tony said as he jumped up and tried to put some distance between him and Steve.
Tony looked down at the battered suit with the infinity stones still attached to the armor. The damage was quite extensive. He’ll be here for a while. Steve will get his wish and be able to hang out with him just a while longer.
Steve turned around and that was going to be the end of it. Or so he thought. What he didn’t expect was the hand on his shoulder. Steve grabbed it as he quickly turned around. Tony cried out as Steve’s stomach fell when he heard a sickening snap.
“ And you want my help because you don’t think your body could handle another travel with the stones.”
Quentin chose not to comment. He also thought his dad was a bastard. The man did fire him after all.
Tony nodded. It was then Jarvis walked into the room and wrapped a warm blanket around Tony shoulders.
Tony just shook his head and jumped in when the elevator doors opened. He quickly pressed the button to his floor and didn’t allow himself to relax until he reached his floor.
Steve scrunched his eyebrows. “ What do you mean by ‘confirmation to euthanize’” He asked perplexed.
Bruce sighed. “ I am saying to treat him nicely. You don’t have to return his feelings but don’t treat him like crap. Remember the other guy really likes him. And right now he is feeling a lot more protective of him.”
Tony cried out as he came. Steve following right after with a grunt. They laid there panting heavily when a loud series of thumps came from the side wall.
“ Ummm....Rhodey it was his back that got hit...” Steve tried. This was really too much. What grown needed to be fed like this? It was his back. He still has one hand that was perfectly fine! What the hell does he need to be spoon fed?
The man scoffed. “ Well not in his case. Steve was really stressed and needed to burn off some energy and so I guess it seemed like a good idea, but he left shortly after she visited his room. It turned out he didn’t know where to put it and got frustrated and left.”
Grant obliged and thrusted roughly I to him. Steve covered Tony’s mouth with his own muffling his moans.
He didn’t really want to do this. But they were so insistent and it was one against two very persuasive puppy-eyes super soldiers.Grant had a bruising grip on his hips as he continued to thrust forward.  Tony could hear him grunting and the sound of his dog tags jingling.
Tony was back in the living room when he heard the elevator ding. He had been sitting on the couch, a photo album in his hands, trying to piece together the life of the other Tony Stark. He looked up and saw Steve.
Tony stepped in and turned to face the door as Steve pressed the button for his floor. He turned and smiled at Tony.
I was a wreck afterward, but I couldn’t take off time to grieve as my higher ups wouldn’t allow it since we had lost two specialty agents and we weren’t married. It was six months later that I was told I was going to do a solo rescue mission. At that point I didn’t give a shit of whether or not I would survive. I was still hurting pretty bad from Reilly.
Tony repeated the movement again, this time coming up a little higher. He was soon riding him, moving up and down giving himself additional leverage from having his hands on Grants stomach. He felt Steve behind him holding him and placing sloppy kisses on his spine.
Tony wasn’t given much preamble before Steve pushed himself in. Tony bit into a fur in front of him as the werewolf thrusted forward. Shit. He prepared himself and it still hurt. He screamed as Steve began to thrust forward. It probably sounded more like muffled moans to him or he probably didn’t hear it over his own noises.
Hi everyone ! Sorry for the late update. School and work has been crazy. I am hoping to do another chapter soon.
Tony get his throat constricted. He felt as if someone was trying to rip his heart out of his chest. Oh god. He was really
“ Get dress and Report immediately to the gym now.” He snapped in what sounded much like Steve’s ‘I’m-Captain-America, Don’t- you-dare- disobey” voice.
Tony nestled himself in the V of Grants legs and began to give him the same service. He doesn’t last as long as Steve.
Tony hadn’t been back to the Shield compound after watching Steve ( he had stopped using the name Winghead to identify him) fuck his little buddy into oblivion. You know he wasn’t jealous. The merman was only just a nuisance anyway. He has better and bigger things to worry about. One being his company. Yes he still has a company to run. Can’t let that go neglected for too long.
“ Well I guess that’s Hydra for you. They are willing to do absolutely anything to fuck the world up.”
Morgan snatched the phone from his brother. “ Hey give that back!” Peter snapped as Morgan quickly typed out a text and sent it. “ What did you say?”
Morgan rolled his eyes. “ Time for school. Be glad it’s me and not our parents. I’ll buy you some time, just hurry up and get showered and dress.” With that Morgan walked out the door.
“ Different story and he’s neither a lunatic and a mercenary. And we are not talking about me. I want you to do better in life.”
So Stephen Strange was an asshole. Tony was just reminded of that again the minute he stepped into the conference room. God he hates this man.
Bucky relaxed with a sigh and turned to look at Tony with a happy smile. He crawled forward, butting his head against Tony’s hand, like a dog.
“Now, lets go back up stairs, shall we?” Rhodey asked as he led them toward the elevator. Tony just nodded and let himself be led to what appeared to be a study.
“ What the hell did you do Tony?” Clint snapped as he rubbed his jaw. Steve had elbowed him as he made an attempt to go after his doppelgänger.
Tony leaned back and tugged Winghead back down with him. Tony felt Winghead begin to grind into him.
“ Yes very much so. And he seems to only be violent when he feels threatened. So that’s a bit of good news. And he seems to really like Tony. He’s Been singing like this ever since Tony left. Which makes it possible that his kind sings to relay feelings.”
Tony looked at the crazed look on his face and cuddled further into Sam for protection. She stroked his hair to comfort him.
“ Little love, you need to eat more. You’re so thin!” Maria said as she shoveled more of her home made spaghetti on his plate. Apparently she had thought he was definitely underweight as she had whipped up a large potion of spaghetti and meatballs, garlic bread and cheese ravioli.
Tony grunted as Steve went through the open door of the bathroom and sat him down at the edge of the tub.
Steve looked down the scope of his rifle at the brunette beauty he had been staring at all night.  He watched the man turn around and gave him privy to that tight ass.
“ Ok how about-“ Harry was interrupted  when Peter launched himself at Harry, tackle long him to the ground. What confused him the most though was how he as able to jump on him from that far away.
Steve gave an exasperated sigh “  Then why bring him if your not selling him? What is the point of this then? Are you trying to piss me off?”
Wade nipped at his neck and began to grind into Peter. Peter moaned as he clawed at Wades back, pulling at his grey shirt.
Winghead tried to move around Tony, but Tony blocked him. “Enough. Bruce just wanted to check you up. Make sure you are doing ok.”
Bucky came shortly after. Steve made some clicking noises at him and Bucky pulled out and flopped on his side next to Tony.
“ Now that that is settled, why don’t we continue to discuss your future as a Stark,” Howard said to Rhodey.
When I busted open the cell door, that’s when I figured out why I was told to cover up. I had seen the asshole burn up a freaking black church on TV when I was in Alabama and I heard about how he treated African Americans. One guy that I went to school with was freaking whipped by him and he put salt on his cuts just for shits and giggles.
Tony was indeed good at arcade games, much to Steve’s chagrin. He made it be known that he was better than some “ Senile old man.”
“ Looks like daddy approved of your boyfriend.” Sam snickered. Tony just rolled his eyes and continued to watch as the mer-people looked at his dad with utter fascination with Maria at his side. Tony will give him that: he knew how to entertain an audience.
Hi everyone! Thanks for your support so far! I wanted to make sure to update one last chapter before the new year tomorrow! Happy New Years Eve and I’m looking forward to easing your comments.
“ Man you need to loosen up a bit. I bit when you go a few rounds with this guy you’ll be a little nicer.” Sam quipped.
Steve turned Tony to look at him, man handling him with ease. He looked perplexed. “No. No, I don’t think that. I love you.” Grant was at their Side now looking confused as well.
Steve then opened his closet and pulled out a black trunk. He rummaged through it a bit before coming back with his arms full of things that Tony couldn’t discern.
Tony grimaced. “ Can we just get the clothes first?” He didn’t not want to go shopping with Steve with any of those bastards around. They would be relentless once they saw how Steve cooed and babied him. It was embarrassing really. He treated him like a life size Ken doll when they went out to get clothes or he was making him try new clothes. God that man was an embarrassment to be around.
Steve smiled. “ Great, it’s still warm so it’s best to eat it now. You can eat it on my floor so you won’t have to worry about cleaning.”
Also I am looking for a Peter x Tony fanfic. Tony starts talking dirty to him in bed and insults him. It Hurts Peters feelings but he doesn’t say anything as he doesn’t want to upset tony. Please let me know if you know the name:)
“ You can only imagine. Natasha texted me earlier and said that Schmidt hit him In the head with a newspaper.”
“ Tones, I know you have been under a lot of stress lately, maybe it’s time for a break. We can go to your Malibu house today if you want. The Air Force will let me go if you need me. They are willing to please you as long as you supply them your goodies.”
Peter whimpered and pushed his chest forward, not sure what to do, but following his pleasure. He get Wades hand over his jeans, groping him. It was a soft movement.
He told Tony that he had some work to get done but he would be back later to have lunch with him. He fussed with him for several minutes, making sure his clothes were wrinkle-free and that his hair was nicely combed before giving him a kiss and telling him to have fun and to ply nice with the others.  It reminded of very much of a worried mom sending her child to school.
“ I know that,” Strange replied calmly, “ But maybe, just maybe, life would be better here. I know you will miss your wife and daughter but think about it, all of a sudden you appear from the dead? And that is saying if this works. Traveling dimensions is dangerous Tony. Who knows what will happen if we send you back. If you want to go back I will help you. Just give me until the end of the week. I have to do some research. This is a very difficult area to Ben for the most experienced practitioners of magic.”
“ And I don’t give a shit about my salary. Now both of you need to come with me. We have things to discuss.”
“ Pssst!” Tony jumper at the noise and looked near the window where the noise was coming from. Standing there was the blonde man from earlier. He had his hands up in a placating manner as he approached Tony.  Tony hurriedly backed away.
“ We need to complete a full wellness check on him to make sure that he is healthy and does not have serious medical conditions going on right now.” Bruce explained as they dressed up in wet suits outside of Wingheads enclosure.
“ They put a tracking device in my phone. And they tracked me to your apartment and dad was spying at me through the phone because he freaking hacked it. The freaking bastard.”
“ I know,” tony felt the tears well up in his eyes again, “ But Steve really missed Bucky and I know how much he means to him. And I was only trying to..” Tony started sobbing. Tony felt steve grip his hand gently as Nat come over and gave him a hug.
“ I think he was trying to stall at first to see how long my magic would last. He is quite intelligent.” Strange said as they made it back to the command center.
Silence enveloped them once again.  Tony savored the taste of the chicken. It really was good. The Steve from his world never cooked and he was pretty sure that even if he did he wouldn’t be able to cook this well.
Clint wrapped an arm around Tony, who had sat a little bit away from the red haired woman. “ See Nat? He loves me already.”
Tony didn’t get the chance to deliberate much further  as Bucky made a pained whine and slumped against him. He looked up at the door and saw Bruce with a tranq gun and the rest of the avengers.
Clint scrunched his face as if he were trying to remember. “ It would have to be Peg, right? Before she dumped his ass?”
Tony should have known Wanda would have been in this universe. He didn’t really have anything  her. She had just acted out against him because her family had been killed and she was angry at the world. He was just surprise how many people this universe shared with his own and yet how different it could be.
The man smiled at him, “ My little Anthony .” He cooed as he carded a hand through his hair lovingly.
Steve bit his lip and blushed. He kept fiddling his hands and looked down at his feet as he lightly bounced on the balls of his feet.
Tony was invited that Friday to visit Maria and Howard at their Manhattan estate. It was a beautiful house that looked like it came out of a glamour magazine.
“ Who are trying to sell this bullshit to? I’ve known you for how many years? You have never eaten brócoli in all of the time I have known you.”
Tony felt Steve stiffen under him as he watched as Rhodey held back a raging Howard.Tony felt himself being softly pulled off of Steve’s dick and watch as the man quickly put on his shorts and kiss Tony.
Meanwhile Tony heard and soft clicking noise and a few seconds late the felt Steve trace his hole with some cold lubricant.
Tony laughed when he felt Steve embrace him and brought him to his chest. He felt Steve grind up against him.
Tony rolled his shoulders and readjusted his robe. It was show time. He opened the door and walked out into the bedroom. Steve and Grant were still dressed and in the bed. They looked up at him with wide eyes. Tony smirked.
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. The two idiots had surprised Tony with a getaway trip for the week at a resort and spa in Lake Placid. They had ordered almost everything of the spa and activities package as well as the luxury suite. Tony knew Steve got paid well from Shield in addition to his backpay from the Army but he still didn’t know how he could afford this place especially on such short notice.
When they finally reached the ground, Tony noticed two things. One: he was being Carried bridal style. Two: Grant had on his compete Hydra attire. Well, fuck that was going to be a PR disaster.
“ You are fucking unbelievable.” Tony picked up a bottle of scotch from the table. Steve has chased the man back to his part of the tower trying to stop him to explain.
“ Steve!” Tony cries out as he felt himself come again. Steve pumped into him a few more times before he felt his inside warm up with some thick fluid.
The other Steve stiffened and he looked even more pissed. “ Well at least I never worked for Hydra.” He snapped.
“We kind’ve been together  since I was 14 and he means the world to me. I love him. He is the sweetest guy I have ever met and even though we had our rough patches, we still love each other. I like you, but only as a friend. He is like my Knight and shining armor and I can’t imagine being with anyone else, but him. I’m sorry Harry.”
Steve really didn’t care one way or another. He absolutely did not. There were fairies back when he was just a shrimp. What he couldn’t stand was how open they were. Why did they need to make it everyone’s business? After living in the future for a couple years he could not understand that. What makes it even more aggravating was one of these fairies lived in the same Tower as him.
Which led to Tony strapping the intruder into a “ Hulk-proof” chair and him calling Rhodey for extra back-up. The man was the least likely to be judgmental out of all the Avengers.
Tony launched himself at him and tried to get the book. Steve could easily overpower him, but he always treated Tony like some fragile china doll.
Harry shook his head and led him to the bed. Peter sat down with a bounce and giggled. “ It’s bouncy.”
“ Hey, honey, I didn’t forget about you. Want to play catch today? Grab me your ball and we’ll do that. “ He smiled and swam to his Little Rock island in the middle of the water where he kept all of the things Tony gave him.
“ Yeah right. If you loved me you wouldn’t have chained me to a wall and threaten to harm my friends.”
“ Ya Don’t shut up do ya?” Bucky said as he gripped tightly onto Tony’s upper arm. Nat and Clint quickly followed behind him.
“ Trust me, they were tame today. I’m surprised they didn’t want to drag you back home. Those two would dress you up in a onesie and bonnet if you gave them a chance.”
Pete rolled his eyes. “ Just someone from school.” He adjusted an equation in the hologram, watching its reaction.
Steve just nodded as he stood up with Tony cradled against him. Tony just pointed as he crossed his arms.
“ Hey there, handsome. I got out early today. Did you behave today?” Tony walked up to the tank as the creature, Winghead ( yes, he named him that. I mean his ears look exactly like wings) happily swam up to the edge, pulling his torso into the edge. It had taken two days to complete this tank, replicating a oceanic environment with fish and a beach like area formed that sharply dropped of to the water below. It was thought that it was a better design as Winghead  wouldn’t have to drag his body out on sand before being able to swim away.Tony remembered how he was on that concrete pen and even though the creature wasn’t exactly complaining this had to be more comfortable.
Tony opened a bleary eye and saw Steve, no... Grant, he is pretty sure it’s Grant, sleeping in front of him. It takes him a bit to remember that Steve was also in his bed and why the three of them were in the same bed.
“ Well I guess that’s my cue. It was nice meeting you Peter.” With That he turned away and walked down the hall.
He just ignored Tony and continued to watch the TV screen that he accidentally turned on. Pepper had already left since she had an early meeting tomorrow and left Tony with the stubborn fish.
Tony placed the cup of tea in front of Strange and sat down in the plush chair across from him. Strange looked like he got beaten badly...well he had been beaten badly. Steve made sure of that. He oblates him for almost getting Tony killed by the infinity stones. His arm was in a cast and his body was littered in bruises and cuts.
Tony picked up another doughnut and continued to munch on it when he felt a soft jab at his side. He turned to look at Clint who gave him his best impression of puppy dog eyes. Tony rolled his eyes and handed him a doughnut. He squealed in delight and happily took it.
But that wasn’t the only one who’s attention he caught. The blonde was staring at him now too. Tony gulped.
Tony panted softly as he felt Steve shift a bit and pulled his hair and began to mouth at his neck. Despite his playboy history, Tony knew he wouldn’t last long. Steve trusted a few more times and both came with a sigh. It wasn’t the epic and pornographic spectacle that was the norm of his playboy days, but it was fulfilling and sweet.
“ I already know what you were going to say. And the answer is no. We are not installing a coffee maker in the bedroom.”
“ My name is Steve Grant Rogers, born in July 4th, 1920. I enlisted in the US army and became a Captain. I later joined Hydra in August of 1946 after the war. My code name is Commander Hydra or Commander for short.”
“ I guess that babysitter you call a PA decided to drop you off at daycare.” Fury quipped. Tony stuck out his tongue. Fury paid him no mind as  Maria passed out the assignment folders as Fury opened his own.
“ Yes. They were stories but they were true. Why don’t you ask the Winter Soldier himself? He seems to enjoy lounging on your lap.”
So Steve and him had always had problems. He would admit that. He would also admit that he was maybe the instigator of most of, not all of them mind you, their fights. It’s not that he wanted to argue with Steve, it was just tempting. But they had simmered down a bit after defeating Thanos and such and were able to work better together. They didn’t argue as much and the need to try and kill one another wasn’t there either.
Steve moaned as he clawed at the shoulders above him trying to get some type of purchase. He adjusted his legs so he can better grip the waist that was over him.
Maria Hill handed a photograph to Fury. He looked at it briefly. That all he needed to make his decision.
“ how about we just focus on you now? Huh? And wreak that little right asshole if yours?” Bucky said in a husky voice as a finger traced the puckered hole. Tony squealed and cuddles back into Steve who had now wrapped hisEld around Tony.
He leaned over and placed a kiss on his temple. Tony was half asleep at this point. It has been overwhelming for him and was undoubtedly exhausted, but he had managed it well. Tony didn’t move at the kiss, probably too tired to comprehend what happened.
Steve released Tony and back up. Tony have him a once over before going to the nearest suit and opening it. He quickly stepped inside.
“ This is not the first time Bucky tried to have me... you know...” he made a waving motion with his hand and blushed. “ And I’ve always hated it. It was an interference to my work, but I’m glad he brought you in yesterday.”
It had been three days since the incident. He hasn’t even been back down there. He doesn’t want to see any of the fuckers.
Tony worried his hands as he sat of the kitchen island as Steve cooked. He had been in the bed next to steve the night before and couldn’t sleep, with the fear that he was going to be killed in his sleep.
Tony was station to pant as he reached up and curled his fingers into Steve’s hair. “ P-pick me Up,” he panted.
“ Of course not this behavior is unacceptable. And again he have addressed his behaviors internally.”
Pete sighed. “ I really miss you though. I wish we could see each other more. Me too babe, but this is what I do for a living.”
Tony wrapped his arms around himself as he looked around the apartment. He was wearing comfy sweatpants and a plain black cotton shirt.he had been cleaned up and groomed. They had shaved his goatee, but pickers can’t be chosers especially if he hadn’t bathed in over a month.
Tony felt his held being gently coaxed back the a large hand as a wet tongue licked its way up the column of his throat, and then switching to sucking, without breaking the skin when he reached his jugular. Tony wrapper his arms around the pain in the ass, encouraging him. He wanted to be extra good today so that Rhodey could perhaps get out of his jail time a little quicker. The dumb ass had struck the vampire after catching him giving him a kiss on the check. Yeah it wasn’t a good idea for a servant to hit a king. The only thing that prevented him from getting executed was Tony.
“ Or maybe you need to tell him it’s not acceptable behavior. He steals things from there because you tell him it’s ok.”
Bucky smiled and approached them. “ Aaron Called, he only has an appointment for 12:30. It will conflict with the slave master’s schedule. Which would you rather go to?”
Nat was full out laughing by now and Bucky gave her a strange look, but seemed to enjoy her happy state.
“ This is utter bullshit. I am not being paid to be a nanny for these guys. Why do they have to be here? Steve doesn’t even have an interest in me. He went and fucked his buddy so I really doubt that he needs me around anymore.” Tony growled.
He got another nod and Winghead took one of the skewers and handed him one. Tony took a bit of it. He tried not to gag as he tasted it.  Winghead was looking at him intently, as if waiting for a response.
He lifted Tony up before he could protest. “ Come on now, little one, you need to use the bathroom before we go. “
“ Yuck. Don’t say that like the only reason you want to screw me is because I remind you of my dad.”
“ You sounded a little rough in there earlier. I was going to interfere but it seemed like you calmed down when you two started.”
Peter tilt his head and squinted his eyes, as if he were studying him. Then he straightened  up and smiled.  “ This is boring I want to play.” He then grinders his hips into Harry’s.
Bucky pushes Rhodey away a bit more with his tail before stretching himself out, tossing his upper body on Tony’s lap.
“ Do you like like me as a teammate or like me as you want to fuck?” Both blushed and turned away. Tony guesses that was the answer.
“ What? I’m curious and you should know by now there are certain things I never learn. So how hot is he? I mean after hearing about you and Wade I have my reservations regarding your tastes but I still have hope for you.”
Wade shook his head and looked at him, a somber expression on his face. “ Babe, I will never get mad with you about something like this. I love you and care for you. I want you to know that.”
As if some god heard his prayer, Steve grunted and released. Tony get his dick spasm and swell. He fell to the side, with Tony tucked into his chest.
“ First, I dont sound like that. Second, Winghead is probably bored. Did you try getting him some toys?”
Bruce sighed. “ You’re going to have to see someone. These are high doses Tony. And Xanax is a controlled substance. You can’t find that just laying around.”
“ What the fuck was that?! I can’t even feel my legs.” Sam whined from his spot in the couch. After training until 3 pm, the team was dismissed and they dragged themselves to the common area.
“ Well I guess we are going to having pizza,” Steve said, he voice painted with disappointment and he turned the TV on.
“ Hey,” he said as he bounced nervously on the balls of his feet. He had changed into a pair of khaki bots and a plaid button up. His hair was still slicked back.
Bucky nodded. “ It’s because you are so stressed out and you still get panic attacks. I’m looking for your best interest.”
Bruce was currently stitching up a cut he had on his face because he had to have fallen in the glass coffee table. That just had to happen with his fucking luck.  They both knew it was going to heal in a few hours, but it was more so for Tony’s piece of Mind.  And hopefully is back would be good around that time too.
“ World War II. He was apart of our SHEILD program back then. He helped us win the war. There were a couple others too. I think he had a friend. An annoying little fellow who ran his trap more than he should.”
“ Hey big guy, how are you?” He kneeled beside him and scratched the two fins that gave him his name. He purred loudly in response and leaned into the touch.
Peter gave him a long look. He was hope he wasn’t getting paranoid over what Morgan had said, but he thinks that he was right about this whole Harry situation.
“ You’re right! I forgot. Thanks for reminding me. I’ll see you later tonight Tony.” With that Steve rushed for the elevator.
“ B-But your majesty if you give him back then it’s obvious that he is not behaving. We thought you wanted to give him back. There must have been some miscommunication.
“ You know what... I think I have something to do. Yep that’s it. So... bye.” With that Sam sprinted out of the room.
“ What do you mean? Wouldn’t you want to know why your teammate was acting like a total dick for the past couple of weeks with training? “
Tony found Steve in his room, sketch pad and pencil in hand. He didn’t even look up when he walked in. He was sitting on his bed with his knees drawn up, acting as a table. His back was leaning against his headboards
Tony called himself bisexual. Steve had learned that in society it meant that he fancied both men and women. In his opinion it just meant that he was a whore. He would have been fine with Tony, but the man kept acting... strangely. Like he would flirt and he would batt his eyelashes like the Dames used to do with Bucky when they wanted to gain his affections. It was just a bit unnerving. And then he would call Steve sweetheart. It was just too much for him.
Tony got used to the other Avengers over the next few days. He learns that Schmidt is often easily annoyed and that Clint loves to play prank on him. The most recent one included sending him some Hawkeye themed porn. Tony had to admit that the Hawkeye look-a-Like knew what the hell is was doing in bed. He had to give the man props.
“ No matter what universe, I had always loved you. Whether it was as a lover or a friend, I still loved you.”
“ You know he has rejected every woman that has been presented to him. I was thinking I should try a different approach. His majesty has very high standards in taste.”
Peter shook his head. Harry was really nice and he didn’t want to hurt his feelings and it felt nice to have someone to talk to that treated him like a normal person other than Ned. “ Sorry But i have this family thing this weekend and I can’t miss it.”
“ Honey this one is like super effective against super soldier serum. We tested it. Now come on, just....”
The minute they were in the car, Peter knew his dad would explode when they got home. His dad had been breathing heavily in the car and had his steering wheel in a death grip that turned his knuckles white. He had managed to go it somewhat together until he reached their floor in the tower.
“ Shit,” Steve muttered and quickly pulled on a black robe and tied it  sloppily. “ Fuck me... sorry about the mess...” he hurried around and began to pick up several wine bottles from the floor.
“The lube and condom are on top of the bedside table,” Tony said. He didn’t care how much this man said that he isn’t sleeping around. He is not risking it. Who knows what super soldier disease he could spread around.
Tony sat upright as he tried to cough the spaghetti he accidentally inhaled in the wrong airway from shock. He looked over at Rhodey and he gave him his signature let-me-handle-this look.
Steve whined again and pouted. “ Well we would have freaking banged if not for my dad, who by the way expects us at breakfast tomorrow: so no marks. After this afternoon I’m pretty sure he would have no qualms shooting you with his hunting rifle if he thinks we are sleeping together. What the hell did you do to piss him off like that.”
im looking for a fic which was kinda dark all the avengers were in like a mental hospital and tony was their doctor im pretty sure it was no powers and steve pretended like tony was married to him or something and i remember a scene where they were all angry because tony was getting swapped for bruce? Not sure if this is enough but im pretty sure bucky was also in love with tony
He was interrupted by a loud snarl. He looked back at Barnes and saw him crouch and raised his back, making himself appear larger. He flashed his large canines at Steve and dug his hands into the couch.
Everyone had been stupefied to say the least as Loki glared at a sheepish looking Thor. He had his arms crossed at his chest and was tapping his foot irritably as he waited for Thor to answer. However he was never given the chance as he went on a tirade of how he left his bed before morning and never returned his raven ( was that like Asgardian for text?) and He then accused Thor of sleeping around with ‘ Midgardian  whores’ ( has he really though? Jane dumped his ass then he has been pretty busy saving the world and all. Then Captain asshole and Commander dickhead have been keeping him busy with workouts).
When I got out of anesthesia he was just there, curled up in a ball and sobbing. He was worried that Zemo would take me away. Apparently that was in the talks but they had stopped when he had tried to commit suicide but kinda hard to kill him since he’s a super soldier.
“ You are grounded!  Do you hear me? Grounded! You are not to have any lab time, no phone, no computers and no other form of technology and you will be weeding the garden and whatever other chores I can think of,” Maria seethed.
“ Ok baby girl lets get this show on the road.”With that he started up the car and drove it out of the garage. He was just that much closer into going home.
“ I haven’t thought about it really. I’m just winging it. I want them to have a better life. All of them. God knows what they had to go through with Hydra. Did you see the scars on Bucky And then that metal arm? I’m not an expert on mermaids but I don’t think that is natural. Who knows why those bastards did to them.”
Tony was happily humming along, comfortable in his bathrobe, as he walked back to their room. After their massage, they had all gotten pedicures and manicures which had both creeped out the super soldiers as they had no idea what they were. After the mani/pedi the super soldiers had decided to go to the gym. Tony decided to stay behind at the spa and get a facial.
Sam held a finger to her mouth when Tony turned to her. She then whispered lowly, “ Sorry they have super hearing.”
Coulson smiled and looked at Steve. “ Steve, you can stay here if you want. We can grab your stuff and bring it here tomorrow if it makes you happy.”
Tony turned and saw him. Sam gave a low whistle. “ Aren’t you a sight for sore eyes. Want to come back to my place later? We can make a human Oreo and guess who’ll be in the middle?”
They both blushed and nodded before scurrying out of the room, closing the door behind them. Tony chuckled, this was going to be fun.
He slowly moved his face side to side as he observed him. Tony didn’t fight. He was too tired. Too weak to fight.
“ Are they though? There is obvious video footage of this Anthony Stark look alike. Is it because that he looks like the late Mr. Stark that he is being given such preferential treatment. And Mr.  and Mrs. Stark have been seen entering the Tower more frequently since the death of their son. Is this supposed to be some secret Hydra side project.”
Peter ended up going to Harry’s party. Ned was there too but he lost him shortly after arriving when he went to talk to some girl from their chemistry class. Peter didn’t mind, he really didn’t want to be around anyone any way. He was just here for the free alcohol. Peter looked down at the red plastic cup in his hand. How much did he have already? He couldn’t remember. He shrugged and downed the entire cup before heading to the dance floor.
Bucky looked at him owlishly. “ Well in my defense I’m color blind and their car looked a lot like the bad guys.”
Morgan panted and closed his eyes. He felt his liver gently stroking his hair and he purred. He opened his eyes and turned to look at the man.
“ Thank you Ms. Romanoff. As I was saying there is a fire at the nuclear plant down town. They believe 50 workers are trapped at the scene. The QuinJet is ready. Good luck.” And with that the screen went blank.
“ You two knock it off before we lock you back up again.” But glared at each other one last time and muttered a “ Yes, sir” and went back to eating their meal.
“ Let me see, is it because I offended you somehow? Did I not kiss up enough to you this time around? What is is spangles?”
“ Well, it happened when we got him earlier this week. Tony was able to disable that bomb Hydra strapped to him and then we took Tony out of his pen.” Bruce explained.
I’m looking for a fic that Tony x Bucky. X Steve. Where Bucky suddenly walks into Tony’s lab and he screams, alerting Steve who comes rushing in with his shield. Tony then has the coax the Winter soldier who is hiding behind an upturned Dum-E. Bucky says he needs his arm repaired and they help him. I can’t remember the name of this fic and I can’t find it in my bookmarks or history. I would really appreciate if someone can tell me the name.
Tony hurriedly followed suit. He might have done this when he was younger but he didn’t want to get caught by his teammates.
“ Yes!” Steve moaned as he felt something run over his prostate.  His cock felt so real and life like. It felt like a human man was fucking him.
It was the first bath he had in almost three weeks and he wished he could have savored it but he was quickly scrubbed down and dressed in a blue shirt and khaki pants. They had also shaved his beard and trimmed his hair. When he looked in the mirror he gasps in horror when he saw that he looked like someone grandpa.
Tony sighed as he absorbed the information. “ And I’m just some sort of replacement right? I mean I look like the guy he was in love with.”
Tony began walking away to his office. Steve’s eyes opened in horror. “ Honey, I don’t think that’s a good idea.” He began as he chased after him.
“ You know I would. And Bucky and Steve have no problem with following along. They Never had the college experience and I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t mind following you to one of those frat parties or even follow you to class.” He said nonchalantly.
Breakfast didn’t get any better as Steve took it upon himself to decide that Tony didn’t need that much coffee in the morning.
Steve barely had time to register the request when Tony places his hands in his shoulders and jumped in the air. Steve rocked his hands under his thighs in reflex if catching him.
“ You are one of the most famous groups in the world and you can’t find someone else to have on hand other than that guy?”
He should have left the fucking shit with Hydra. Fuck this shit. He could have bought Steve a new bike. This wolf was insane.
Morgan was constantly dreaming and thinking of this man. He noticed how he would stare at him like is dad did to his poppa.
Even though Tony and Pepper had been broken up  for quite sometime, they still enjoyed each other’s company. He would often cook for her when Rhodey was over seas as he was today. He had made them some chicken Alfredo and were currently eating outside in the terrace. It was quite beautiful especially with the night sky as a back drop.
He seemed a little disappointed at the lackluster welcome and pouted. Tony couldn’t seem to find it in himself to care much.
Tony loved Steve. He would give his life for the man, not that the other man knew about his feelings or even cared. But regardless he was helplessly and irrevocably in love with him. Enough to the point that he was willing to do anything for him. Even if that meant finding and presenting him with his long lost mate, one James Barnes, the first love of his life and soulmate. Even though he has been dating Tony for about a year now, Tony knows he still misses James. Which is how Tony currently found himself.

So I went on my mission. It was a heavily guarded prison and I was supposed to extract some POW of ours. I was told that this guy would help me get out once I got him free. I didn’t know who the hell he was. I didn’t give a shit and it wasn’t like they were going to tell me anyway.
“ So when he cuddles with you in the couch it’s not because he thinks his is in a serious and committed relationship?”
“ That doesn’t make me feel any better. He’s a shit show of problems and he’s out of his fucking Mind and a mercenary.”
Tony tried to clench around Steve to hold him in, but Steve just licked that sensitive spot on the make of his neck to let him let go. Tony squealed and softened up again.
“ Good idea. I will just wear what’s left of the suit to fly over the border. The trees are heavy enough here so we won’t be easily detected.”
Tony could see what she meant when Bucky was possessive. The way he held Sam and touched her, Bucky wanted everyone to know she was his.
“ yeah, but I know that tone. And I’m just going to say it once again: I’m not that kind of Doctor. I don’t care what it is, I just know it’ll be something out of my field.”
“ Sorry babe. I just forgot to tell you that Claire wanted to have lunch tomorrow with the both of us. I told her I would speak with you first before I told her. So would you like to go? I mean this is up to you.”
“ Yeah, i adopted them when they were both two. Their parents had died during a civil war and we were called in to settle the skirmish. We found them scavenging through our Quinjet for food.”
Howard smiled at him and gave him a pat on the back. “ Always prepares and with a plan. You are a good man James.”
Sam sighed. “ It was long time ago but I loved him. I still do. We were supposed to get married. He had even picked out a ring and was going to ask when we got back stateside, but he never got the chance.
“ My bambino, please forgive your father he just not used to the idea of his little bambino dating,” Maria said as she rubbed his back.
“ I’m guessing you enjoyed yourself?” Steve felt groggy as he tried to locate the voice. He turned his head and saw Iron Man.
“ Because i want to romance you. I want to walk down the street holding hands. I want to cuddle on te couch and watch horrible movies. I want to take you to Paris-“
Peter gave a bashful smile. “ Yeah, since I’ll be gone for a few weeks with my parents. I thought maybe you know....” he motioned to the camera.
So apparently Not So Jolly  small giant didn’t really want to fight. Well at least not with the Avengers. When they all landed in Central Park, he had glared at them and then demanded Thor to explain himself.
Tony pulled back and placed his own hands on Grants stomach. He can see Steve out of the corner of his eye, moving behind him and and grasping his waist. Tony began to move. He rose a little ways and fell back down, tearing the movement. Grant gasped when Tony went back to being fully seated in his lap.
Steve growled at the semi-insult aimed toward Tony. Tony saw the other vampire exaggeratedly roll his eyes.
“ Tony be Nice.” Pepper lightly chastised as she pulled out a folder form her bag and handed it to him with a pen to sign.
Steve gave a casually wave of his hand. “ To Aaron’s I need to get a new coat for Tony. He’s gained some weight. I can always go pick up the slaves at a later time.”
Steve couldn’t be more glad that Loki had decided to get Thor’s attention today even though it had been quite disturbing. He hadn’t expected the smaller god to initiate a make out session with Thor in the middle of Time Square. But the battle left the Iron Man suit compromised which meant Tony had to take the elevator up to his workshop, giving Steve the
Schmidt had set him up as usual and was supposed to meet the escort when he stopped in his tracks. As cliche as it sounds, he saw the most handsome man he had ever seen in his life. The world had seen to stop when he saw Tony smile at the bartender and asked for a glass of water, his eyes twinkling at some joke the man told.
“ Yeah? Want faster?” Steve asked as he pistoned faster into Tony. Tony could hear the sound of skin slapping against skin at this point. ” Like that baby? Is that good baby?” he asked, voice raising.
“ Yeah you know like teacher and sexy student or pool boy and lonely housewife. That type of thing. I guess that didn’t have it in the 40’s?”
“ Making you dinner. Hope you like fish. I’ll be right here if anything happens. Clint and Sam will be in the booth. Wear the ear piece and signal us if you need anything.
He looked around as he went and noticed it looked very similar to Central Park, except... it seemed cleaner.  He kept walking. He noticed some people where giving him odd looks. He pulled his hood up and kept his head down. He didn’t need to be recognized as an outsider, that would only cause trouble.
Bruce smiled and clapped his hands excitedly. “ And you had rotations right? Was one of them like family or couples therapy?”
“ You’re an incentive. You are here to give that jack ass upstairs a reason to actual do some work. “ Bucky said as he continued to read the file in front of him.
Tony noticed the Brunette was missing an arm. He was definitely  the winter soldier. The man was know today have a indestructible metal arm. How he didn’t see it before was beyond him.
Tony looked worn out too as he gave Bucky a hug. Steve was still glaring at where James left as he tried to calm Jamie down.
Tony was walking back to his room when he saw Pietro, Wanda and Loki huddled on the couch. Pietro had a ice pack over his right eye and Loki and Wanda seem to be fussing over him.
The inside of the estate was very ornamental with high windows and chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. Whoever this person was was extremely wealthy.
“ I can help.” Tony said as he dropped to his knees. Maybe he can get some answers out of Steve this way.
Tony took the remote and turned it off. Winghead growled and puffed out his cheeks, turning toward to Tony.
“ - jerks decide to get jealous because Bucky decides to show up when they were on their morning run and wanted to spar with me.” He re-adjusted the ice pack on his nose.
Behind them stood a blonde man around Tony’s height, dressed in jeans and a shirt. He was idly shaving his nails with an Emory board while the other two fought. Tony noticed the collar on his neck and knew he must been a human slave.
“ oh yeah.... uhhh. Yeah....” the person on the screen moaned. His eyes were hooded as the man above thrusted his fingers into him.
They were currently looking at a live feed and Winghead had his arms wrapped tightly around what would have been the other merman’s butt and had his face pressed snuggly into the front where a slit could be seen. The other merman had his head thrown back  and mouth pen widely and his hands in Wingheads hair. Tony had to admit he was handsome. He wasn’t as mascular as Winghead but he wash his laundry on those abs. Also those arms were to die for. Well..arm. The other was what appreared to be metal and from what information Nat was able to get, it was a gift from Hydra’s not so friendly or ethical experimentation program.
Steve shakes him gently but his eyes were dim and the arc reactor was a faint glow.  “ No...no...no” Steve whimpered. He felt Bucky put a hand on his shoulder, saying something that sounded much like an apology.
Eventually Steve told Tony to follow a servant back to his quarters. The servant opened the door before ushering him inside and closing it, leaving him alone. Well, mostly alone. There were two guards stationed outside that look as if they could easily manhandle him if they wanted to.
Winghead was pretty good. He didn’t bite or claw of Bruce. He whimpered and squirmed  a bit when Bruce had to take some blood but other than that he was a perfect angel.
“ Fuck!” Both Stark men yelled as Maria gave them both a stern glare and reminded them regarding using such profanity.
“ Look at him Howard! He is so sad. He is already reprimanded enough.” Maria exclaimed as she held Tony closer to her. She was quite protective of her child as any good mother would be. Howard wanted to smile at the act. Maria was really too good for him. He did not know how he got so lucky.
They both opened their books as the teacher listed Off the questions and instructed the students to work together. It really wasn’t that much. Peter could probably get it down quite quickly by himself.
The Avengers war has they saw Steve and Grant walk through the common area. They greeted them happily and smiled in a way that was too happy. They then saw Tony walking behind them slowly and then settling himself down gingery on the couch.
Tony quickly took off his pants and underwear and tossed it into the corner. Steve yipped happily when Tony Laid back and spread his legs and quickly nestled himself between his limbs. Tony laughed as Steve nuzzled his neck.
Tony peppered kisses on his groin and licked a strip on the front of the sweat pants. Tony withdrew his hand from Grant and pulled down the front of Steve sweatpants and underwear to pull out his erection.
“ He’s an overprotective and controlling bastard,” Tony growled as he tore into another doughnut and munched angrily.
Bruce sighed at rubbed his forehead. “ It doesn’t work like that. Tell me would you sleep with Wanda?”
Steve shrugged and tossed him the lube. Bucky pushed down his pants and took them off. He circled his hole with a lube finger.
“ Tony if you are out there, I just wanted to tell you that I love you. We all love you. Please come home. If you are in trouble you can tell use, we will help you. I know you feel out of pace here, but it really is t that bad. We all love and care about you. I love and care about you. If it is something I did that made you upset, you can tell me. I am so sorry that whatever i did made you feel that you had to runaway. Please Tony come home. I love you.” The video was minimized and the image of Christine was brought back.
Tony glared at Schmidt. He was in a completely different universe and he still had to attend meetings. What the fuck was this? What deity or alternate universe dickhead creator did he piss off to have to end up at a god damn meeting?
Maybe he could have been this wealthy. Maybe if the war didn’t happen and if he wasn’t captured. And if some type of horror movie character had been real and wrecked havoc world wide.  Who knew that werewolves existed? Apparently everyone who was sane. And apparently one day they decided to rule the world. And that they did. Tony had remained free for as long as he could until he got captured. Now he was a Slave and who knows what he would be after this trip. Most likely dog chow.
Winghead cooed and purred as Tony scratched behind his ear. Today was date number four. This one went better then that first, Tony didn’t make any sexual related comments and Winghead didn’t faint. Today they just had lunch ( some Italian food that Nat left out, thank god, for Winghead to scavenge and think he was independently providing for Tony. The little creature didn’t know that Nat set him up with the food and that was fine. He never needed to know because at least this time the food is edible. Tony was still able to act surprised though, to sell the small deception)  and were now cuddling.
Seeing his best friend, Tony's lips tug upwards a little. Rhodes' offers one back, before his face falls back into a frown. His brows are knitted in concern and his jaw looks clenched. His whole form looks like it's on emergency mode and he urges Tony to get out of the car, with his thumb.
Tony's eyes scan Steve's luscious golden skin, right from the tendrils of his neck to the perfect V of his hips, draped over cakes of beefy muscle, which Tony's accustomed to kneading and grabbing.
Anger coursed through him like magma and when Tony took a round of the house, he caught sight of the horror through the unshaded window.
Tony storms into the room, angrily and throws open the large oak doors of the cupboard, revealing a large assortment of neatly folded racks of clothes.
"And I'm grateful that I did. I really am. I'm genuinely grateful for all of you who have been there with me since day one. Well, day two in my opinion because I don't remember shit from my first day here because I was IMMENSELY coked up."
Tony can feel the stare boring craters into his being but consciously tries to ignore it, focusing on what's important at the moment.
Tony was and probably is the love of his life. He's loved him for twenty years and counting. Ever since that night on the terrace, Steve knew he gave his heart completely and fully to Tony. Tony gave him a home, a family and he's perfect to Steve.
"Easy work, Cap", Tony teased as Steve smiled so heartwarmingly that it kind of put Tony to shame at his debaucherous behaviour.
Tony landed his palms down on Steve's chest, gently pinning him and smashed their lips together. Tony kissed Steve ferally, neck twisting to devour Steve from ever angle before licking inside the warm hollow of Steve's mouth. Tony swallowed each and every one of Steve's moans, his hands roaming all over the soldier's beautiful body, feeling the chiseled expanse of his frame, the crests and troughs of his beautiful muscles. Feeling his mouth water, Tony kissed down Steve's throat, nuzzling his van dyke in those sensitive spots Steve loved, earning a gruff hum or throaty chuckle from him.
Peter grew up to be smart like his Dad and shy like his Pops. He was one of the best kids the couple could ever ask, always courteous and well mannered. He was probably one of the smartest people in the country, winning laurels and awards in competitions, making the pair proud of their son.
Tony staggered forward under Steve's weight pressing into him and he dropped the screwdriver, leaning back into the warmth from behind him as electricity shot through his spine from the base of his neck, where he felt the soft skin pressing into him and the prickle of a beard against the sensitive skin of his neck and hands clutching him so fervently, turning his legs into jelly.
He digs his palms into the balls of his eyes, trying to soothe the burn from lack of sleep when the doorbell rings.
Tony looked even more beautiful like this, with his suit in disarray; a shirt button popped open and the bowtie hanging loosely around his neck. His eyes were closed as he clung onto the railing and breathed against the cold wind, seeming so serene and calm. Heat bloomed from within Steve's chest, he was falling quickly and hopelessly for this man.
Steve simply looks on at her as she lowers her legs onto the floor and rests her elbows over her knees.
Steve felt his arms wrapped around the frame on top of him and rubbed up and down to feel the smooth expanse of beautiful Mediterranean skin and lithe muscles beneath them. He worked his fingers through the gentle ridges of bone and skin and muscle of the figure lying on top of him, as if he were a mattress. His arms slowly snaked upwards from the small of the back to the peaking clavicles and then to those built shoulders he sank his digits into, in an attempt to massage and relieve the knots in them. The figure let out a soft sigh and Steve could feel the exhale of breath on his shoulder, warm against his bare skin. He hummed in response and closed his eyes, shutting out everything other than this exclusive feeling of contact, cherishing every second of it.
Tony turns his head and kisses Steve's ear. The Captain releases him from the bear hug and smiles down at him. He lifts Tony's chin and frames his face in his big hands, before bringing down a big sloppy kiss down onto the smaller man's forehead again.
Tony hears his phone ping and checks it to see it's two texts from Peter. He opens it with Steve as they read it in unison.
His eyes look bloodshot even from the appreciable distance between them and his face is dripping, with sweat, presumably. Tony sees his hands, clenched tightly and trembling at the side.
Almost an hour later, Tony manages to clean up the rubble and tosses the remains into a separate bag and throws it down the chute.
"You know what, Steve. For two years, two years, you made me manage the house alone. You made me manage our family alone. Do you even know that Peter used to wake up with terrible anxiety attacks in the middle of the night? Do you? Do you know anything about me and your son, who you promised to give the world, from the last two years? I used to calm him down and on God, it was the most frightening experience of my life seeing my kid shake and tremble with the same crap I used to go through all my life and having it replayed! And do you know what I used to think? I used to want you next to me, next to him because we were supposed to be there for him together. Isn't that what you told me, that we'd always be together? Huh?"
"I never told you this but I worked for Stark while he was in California. I was his PA for a while when Pepper took over as CEO. And let me tell you this, he doesn't deserve whatever the two of you are doing to him."
I spent so many days wondering where I went wrong for you to not even look at me properly, not even when we made love. I'd hate myself for it, hate myself so much that I fucking wanted a drink so bad. I craved that burn and that loss of cognition, so eagerly because I needed to take my mind off of you.... you, who'd always helped me take my mind off of everything. I just.... I...."
Tony slumps back against the chair, eyes open wide in shock as the little part of him that hoped this was all a lie is just nipped brutally within him.
Peter got accepted into MIT, which made Tony so goddamn proud that he bought him his own car after years of using Tony's old one. He remembers Steve too showering all his love and congratulations onto their son.
Tony just shuffles around and wraps the blanket tight. He's terrified of confronting Steve. He'd fight the whole goddamn world but he would never fight Steve. Never.
Nat is probably the strongest person Steve knows. She's lived a tough life, had to work her way to the top, alone. She's been in the business, long before Steve and she showed him the ropes after the Army.
"Firstly, I want to apologize for everything that happened between us. I realize that I reacted impulsively out of my own grief and that it wasn't right. After much pondering and therapy sessions, I figured out what needed to be done. So, I'm sorry about probably everything since day one.
"So, for two years, you've been lying and sneaking and telling me and our son that you've got business meetings and urgent conferences when you've been banging your fucking army ex five blocks from the house?"
Steve catches Tony's legs as they leave the edge of the table and places them over his shoulders. Tony's always been experimental in bed, more so with Steve.
Tony nods in response, trying to grace the comment with a smile but ends up with a hybrid grimace of sorts.
In one single flick of his index finger, Steve slices the tape open and pulls out the cardboard sleeve of the box and empties the contents onto the table with a sudden jerk, impatiently.
The man in question shifted a little, freeing his arms from beneath Steve's clavicles to rest it atop the vast expanse of his golden hued chest, his pinkies flicking the pert pink nubs of his nipples and hoisting himself up to his knees, before he stopped to lock his eyes with the brilliant baby blues eyeing him with so much ardor that it made his heart skip a beat. A beam of affection tugged at Tony's lips as he scooted forward to capture Steve's own in a tender, slow kiss that ended with a swipe of tongues against one another.
He gets out of bed and pulls on a shirt before trudging over to the door and opening it, to reveal a poker-faced Natasha.
At the end of their conversation, Steve just tapped James on the back, a friendly gesture. Then, the other man asked Steve who's here with him to which he pointed at Tony.
He walks over to his car and throws his jacket onto the passenger seat, before getting in and locking the seatbelt in place.
His body is soaked with perspiration and there are cuts and nicks, everywhere on his built frame but there's one particular large gash running across his stomach, diagonally. Blood oozes from it in tiny rivulets and Tony glances up at the piece of glass lodged right in Steve's sternum, jutting out menacingly.
It's been years since he's visited their graves. He's never had the strength to go through that again, to relive all the pain he's been bottling up inside for what feels like centuries. They were buried just an hour's drive from the compound, in compliance with his mother's wishes but Tony still couldn't go visit. When he was in Malibu, he had a definite reason but now….. now he just tries to put it off, to dismiss everything that was tied to his childhood with them and just go about his day.
He hears the voice break into a sob and feels his heart clench painfully within his chest. Hot tears had already started flowing down his cheeks long ago and he's so scared right now. He doesn't want to hurt the other man anymore. He doesn't want to cause him any harm or sorrow. Whatever he did, he did in blind rage. It took him back to his days of drunken stupor and bad choices. All he could see was his mother's face beaming at him from inside his head, affectionately cooing out to him in Italian and his father's lifeless body slumped over the driving wheel. He wasn't thinking and only saw red and retribution. To exact yé oldè eye-for-an-eye from the murderer of his only kin, who left him orphaned and alone in this monstrosity of a world.
"I got so pissed that I just grabbed every single thing of mine I own in that house and ran out. I can't deal with this anymore, platypus. I have a bad feeling it's been happening ever since Peter got into high school."
After the last of them left, Tony took Steve out to the roof of the building where they could see the beautiful night sky, dotted with stars as well as the hustle-bustle of the humans below. The yellow, red and white lights of Californian nightlife interspersed with the violet-black of the nearingly midnight sky knocked a breath out of Steve, who took it in with a deep breath, only to hear Tony doing so as well.
"You're daaaaaammmnnn, oh god, fucking right I do, Jesus, Steve, don't stop, please, my God.... Unnnhhhh."
"She said she's in Cali for a council meeting. She's catching the early night flight to NY. She also said and I quote, 'wants to cut the son of a bitch from throat to scroat.' "
But, Bucky. He loves Bucky too. The passion and intensity he loves Bucky with is too strong, fearful almost. He can't live without him. Bucky causes Steve to be overcome by carnal desire, a lust he cannot fight.
They stayed like that for a long moment before Tony started trembling against the cold and they went back inside, while Steve carried up Tony by his waist and Tony rested his arms on the ex-Captain's back and another cradled with his hand, almost using him as an anchor for support, all the while keeping their gazes locked onto each other, beaming at each other.
She saunters over inside before placing the bag she brought on the dining table and glances a look at Steve, hand placed on her hip as she regards him with disdain.
Steve's breath hitched in his throat, the glory of Tony's ministrations made him leak even more into his lover's mouth. He grabbed a fistful of Tony's hair and started bobbing his head up and down on his dick, gradually picking up the pace as he used Tony's mouth to chase friction, to chase his release. Steve felt Tony's saliva lube him up copiously, his tongue wiggling around, aiming to coat every inch of him. Tony began to slurp and splutter, those sounds of pleasure crackling a sensation in Steve's gut as he felt himself get closer and closer.
Good sex always made Steve snore, Tony chuckles to himself. He wonders how powerful he is over the serum to make a super-soldier snore and smiles to himself.
After that, the sweet caresses, the loving gestures and the passionate love-making came to a halt. Steve always claimed he was going on business trips and late night conference meetings and he came home well past midnight every time, cheeky cunt that he was.
A myriad of emotions crash into Steve, mostly anger, hate and disgust, those ugly emotions are directed towards himself. He hates that he's putting Bucky through this and that he's such a fucking wuss that he can't even face Tony.
Tony's voice cracks as he shuts up and draws a deep breath in and resumes with unsettling calm in his voice:
Bile rose up in Tony's throat as he threatened to hurl again right in front of them and it took him a while to calm himself down and back up a few steps. Tony's legs turned to jelly as he slid down the wall of the house and leaned against it, right below that ghastly window which held all the evidence he denied so intensely for the past two and a half years.
The family moved to Brooklyn, which was Steve's ancestral land and rebuilt their life anew in their new home.
He begins to cough, in tiny fits, and they rake daggers along the lining of his throat. His mouth has gone slack and he feels so parched, he needs a drink. Wait! No! We don't do that anymore, he mutters to himself. He promised never to drink again and committed himself to the program, having earned his five year sobriety chip, just three days ago.
He's terrified of having to pick up the call but he also knows if he does, he's going to have a breakdown and he'd rather die in a ditch than let this man have the opportunity to watch him fall apart.
It hurt him. Every time it happened, it hurt him, like a knife stab or a sinking feeling in his belly, leaving a deep chasm behind in his chest that seemed to be never ending. It was probably of magnificent proportions by now, growing still and threatening to consume him one day because he was too foolish to assert his own needs for once. He was too stupid to stand up for himself.
All Steve can do is look on. He did this and he can't even help, not because he can't but because he did this to Tony. He's been doing this to Tony for so long that he just.....
I fucking did it. Oh God, this was a hell storm to finish and it ate me alive that I just wanted to get over with it ugh.
The soldier sees his shoulders hunch slowly and catches sight of the fist in the curtain. The man is shaking as he clutches and squeezes harder at the fabric, possibly in an attempt to rip it off. He knew it was a bad idea to come but he couldn't let this wound sit and fester, which had opened up long since the airport. Or even the Accords. Ever since Ultron, frankly. It was a nick then but now it was a big, gaping hole and it worsened by the bunker. Steve doesn't regret saving Bucky, he wasn't at fault. He never was. The situation was just ill-timed and Steve, well, he messed up. Big time. Whatever happened that day to Tony was his fault. Guilt sparks within him as he remembers the Iron Man suit below him, watching Tony's eyes, full of anguish and rage but also pleading. He will never forgive himself but he has to try. He's gotta fix it soon or else he knows the other man will slip away. Never to be found again.
It used to eat him alive, but Steve always reassured him that he would never do such a thing and that he vowed to love and cherish Tony fiercely till the end of his days.
I knew for a fact that the only reason you're staying together is for the kid. I fucking knew it. And now that he's off to college, well that burden is off your shoulders, isn't it?”
Steve brings a hand to push the strands of hair out of the sleeping form's face, revealing the powerfully built nose and a jaw that could probably cut diamond.
Steve hears that voice and feels his heart constrict in joy. A whole two weeks without hearing that beautiful deep voice, it's notes  layered with the emotion of concern with practically no effort from the speaker. He's missed it. God, he's missed it so much.
"I'll call Pepper. And I'm bringing fifty cases of booze. Do I have to bring out my gun? You know I'm still licensed to use it."
As soon as he reaches the room, Tony just plops down on the bed and throws the blanket open, smoothing it out fully before throwing another one on himself.
He looks around this false life he had built with another, with contempt and disgust. He grabs the two bags after slinging the duffel on his shoulder and drags them out to the front door, unapologetically knocking a few things over on the way.
Tony wrapped his legs right around Steve from the front as Steve bore their weight and continued his ministrations.
He dries his eyes and rubs his nose with the back of his palm to look at least somewhat decent. Screw that, he probably looks like bear shit, so he just huffs out a long breath and turns to look at the person outside.
Tony meticulously cleans up the wound and applies a tube of ointment on the small cuts and bandaids to the slightly bigger ones, like the ones on Steve's back.
