"Steve let go of him!" Bruce yelled, and Steve was tackled off of Tony, who had to be held back by Clint to avoid him going after Steve once more. "Get him up to his room!" Natasha ordered, and Bruce nodded. He had to wrap his arms around Steve's waist and arms, which wasn't easy for someone who was as small as he was. Steve kept screaming at Tony, words incoherent over his loud sobs that he tried so hard to hold back. Tony was yelling back, telling Steve to pack his shit up, he was gone. He wouldn't be allowed in the tower again.
"Mr. Stark, you're home early." Jarvis's voice rang through the empty lab, and Tony smiled. "Yeah, and I brought a friend." he ushered Steve in, who looked in total awe at the work before him. The large machine was tall, much taller than Tony had described. It was painted a navy blue, with white stars on the side. Steve traced his hand across the smooth metal, and a button beeped at his touch. He jumped back, as a punching bag immediately sprung from the side.
“Natasha? Where the hell have you been?” Clint asked as he made his way out the door. Natasha turned around, the smile still on her face. “Out here, I have to do something real quick. Would you mind helping me out?” she asked, gripping his hand tightly. Clint nodded, and the two headed back indoors.
Steve stood outside in the cold air, rubbing his hands together. “Aw, you cold my little super soldier?” Tony teased, wrapping his arms around Steve’s torso. Steve laughed, and turned so he know faced the shorter man. His eyes shone with the street light, and falling snow flakes stuck themselves to his eye lashes. “I won’t be in a minute.” Steve muttered, leaning down and meeting Tony’s lips. The two kissed, and their bodies immediately ignited with an internal flame. Tony stood on his tip toes, trying to get better access to Steve’s hot lips. He pulled away and began to kiss Steve’s jaw, down his neck. He flicked his tongue across Steve’s sweet spot, causing him to utter a small giggle.
The two remained silent until they excited the building, and headed towards central park. A light snow had begun to fall, and people were bundled up. The streets were quiet, still filled, but quiet. Tony breathed in the chilly November air, and grinned. "I always loved this time of the year." Steve looked up, and smiled. "Yeah. Me too."
He heard Ashley laugh, and knew she took it as a joke. “Enough about me. Tell me a bit about yourself.” Steve wanted to get the attention off himself, as he was afraid of something slipping out.
“Alright, last one’s for you Cap.” Tony teased, giving Steve a playful wink. Steve rolled his eyes and smiled.  He picked up his gift, a small gift wrapped box. Everyone watched in silence, curious as to what it could be. Steve held his breath, and swallowed hard. A small compass, one he knew by heart, sat in the green tissue paper. He lifted it out slowly and carefully, feeling tears come to his eyes. He pressed on the little clasp, and there she was.
Steve immediately tensed, and glanced at Bruce, who now leaned on the counter casually. "I'm sorry?"
"So do you want to tell me what's wrong, or do I have to kiss it out of you?" Tony asked, placing a gentle hand on Steve's shoulder. The super soldier didn't laugh. His face set into a hard expression; he wasn't in the mood for Tony's jokes. "Come on, you know you can tell me anything, I won't be upset, I'm here to listen." Tony said quietly, shifting closer so that he could hug the larger man's waist. Steve wrapped an arm around Tony. "It's, just personal stuff. Nothing to do with you," Steve muttered, and Tony looked up at him. "Then what does it have to do with?" he asked, wiping a tear off his lover's face.
"I knew I'd find you up here." Steve looked up, only to see Tony standing above him- floating actually. He wore his Iron Man suit, the mask covering his face. The blond took his head in his hands and rubbed his temples. Tony was the last person he wanted to see right now. "What do you want Stark?" he mumbled into his hands. The other man floated to the roof top and landed, flipping up his mask so he could get a better look at the broken soldier before him.
A girlish giggle escaped Christine's lips, and she looked him over. "I've never seen you so exposed... It's hot." She purred, and took a step towards Steve, who took a step back. "Don't try to run from me captain, I like the chase." She giggled, and began to remove her clothing. "What are you-" Steve stopped mid-sentence as she stepped in, wearing nothing. She batted her eyelashes at him, water running over her slim body, and Steve took in a breath as she kissed him, pressing her body against his. "Don't pretend you don't want me Steve," she whispered, and Steve was frozen in place. He wasn't sure what to do, he could push her away, but he feared the consequences.
Steve removed his pants before he climbed on the bed, helping Tony with his own pants. Their lips collided, and Steve pinned Tony's arms above his head. Tony groaned with pleasure as Steve kissed his way down his chest, down to his growing erection. Steve used his free hand to remove Tony's boxers, admiring the sight. He let his lips brush past Tony's prick, watching it twitch with pleasure. Tony bit back another moan. "I thought you said you were a virgin." he gasped, and Steve smiled. "I am," Steve growled, kissing his way back up Tony's body, letting his hand do the work on his hard cock. Tony moaned, and Steve kissed him lightly, letting the moan pass from his lips into his mouth. "But that doesn't mean I haven't thought about this from the day we met." Steve felt Tony growing harder beneath him. "Damn it Steve, you've got quite the imagination." Tony said, clenching his teeth. He got one hand free, and tore off Steve's own boxers part way, enough to expose the large cock that he had dreamed about. "That super soldier serum worked wonders." He purred, and put an arm around the larger man's waist, pulling him close. Their naked bodies collided, and sweat mixed in such a perfect way, with cocks growing harder with each grinding movement.
He began to sing, and a hush fell over the audience as his voice filled their ears, and they fell in love with the magic. His eyes searched the crowd, and down in front, his eyes landed on an amazing smile. His eyes followed the contours of the face to land on the most beautiful blue eyes he had ever seen. The nerves fluttered back to his stomach as he realized who he was staring at, and a smile stretched across his face.
Tony smiled as he watched his friend inspect the gift, and laughed at his sudden surprise. "I made the chain out of adamantium  Thought you might be a little sick of replacing your punching bag every time,” he joked, and Steve gave him a strong hug, lifting him a bit, and the man gasped. "Thanks Tony, this is the best gift ever." He muttered into Tony's shirt, and Tony smiled. "There's a lot more to it, let me show you."
"Hi Peter, I don't know if you're watching this or not, but I need to say it anyways. I didn't want to leave Steve, and I didn't to leave you. I only did what I thought was best. I thought that maybe if I let you go this way, you wouldn't have to worry about letting me go, watching as I slipped away. My arc reactor was failing. I was dying slowly, and by the time you watch this, I will have. I hope I look okay at my funeral. You know how I am about my looks." Tony looks away for a moment, coughing heavily. He looks back at the camera, again, smiling weakly. "I just want to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry for not being there for you. I'm sorry I won't be there to help you get ready for prom, or be there for graduation, or when you get your first car, your first apartment, when you get married."
Tony woke up the next morning extremely hungover, and extremely sore. He moved to turn over onto his back, but a pair of large arms held him in place. That was certainly unusual, who was the lucky man he had- oh shit. Tony sat up a bit, and had to bite his tongue to keep from screaming.
Steve looked around to see if anyone was there yet. He noticed Bruce quietly talking with Clint, and Fury sitting at the head of the table. Natasha wasn't around, and Thor was still on Asgard.
The clock chimed eight, and everyone gathered around the fireplace to watch old Christmas movies. They started off with A Christmas Carol, the oldest version Tony could get a hold of. He and Steve sat close on the couch, not close enough to raise suspicion, but still close enough to where they could whisper playful remarks without disturbing the others. “Thanks again Tony.” Steve muttered, the credits beginning to roll. “Anytime Cap.” Tony whispered back, taking his hand for a short second. They smiled, but quickly let go as Pepper shifted herself against Tony's side. Steve cast a longing look at his love, and tried to turn his attention back to the movie.
He pulled the man back up, laughing. "Thanks," Steve said, smiling. They let go of one another's hand, and Tony got up to order them some drinks from the bar. The soldier sighed, leaning back a bit. He licked his lips, suddenly nervous.
Steve smiled back, rolling fully onto his side. Tony rolled over as well, staring at the blond with a goofy smile on his face. "Cap?"
"The hell's up with you Capsicle?" Tony asked as he pulled his arm away from the other man. Steve realized he had been holding on to Tony's arm and looked away, trying to hide the blush that now threatened to ravage his face. "Nothing. Um, Fury said he wanted us to head over to meet with him, he's got something to talk about with us I guess." the blond mumbled, still not meeting Tony's eyes.
. Steve closed his eyes, and placed a hand on the side of the casket, his knees suddenly feeling weak. Peter appeared behind him, in the same shape as his father. Anger was the only emotion he seemed to show. “Why would he do it?” he whispered, taking Steve’s hand and squeezing it tightly. “Why would he lie to us like that?” his voice shook, whether out of anger or hurt, Steve couldn’t tell. Maybe it was both. Steve simply shook his head, and released his grip on the casket. “Come on, they’re starting soon.”
“You two go have fun, I’m going to try and talk to someone.” Bruce said, putting his drink down, and looking at the crowd. “Good luck buddy. See you back at the hotel.” Tony and Steve headed off in the opposite direction, Steve a few steps behind. They didn’t want to draw any unwanted attention. “Slow down a little would you?” Steve said through clenched teeth. He had finally caught up with each other at a secluded table, one that was out of sight. “Slow down? I thought I wasn’t going fast enough!” Tony replied, examining his drink. “You forget how long your legs are Cap.”
"Everyone in their positions?" Steve asked over the headset. "Ready." Banner answered, making his way into the lab. "Ready." Clint adjusted himself on his perch, making sure he would have a direct hit on his target. "Give me the word and I'm on it." Tony said, keeping his suit at a low enough power to keep it from being picked up by any trackers that the terrorists had set up. "Alright, let's go!" Steve shouted, and quickly led the attack on the terrorists. Bruce set up an explosive chemical that would completely destroy the lab and everyone in it within five minutes, but until then, the man smiled as his eyes flashed to green, and the Hulk took over, wreaking havoc on the lab. Clint took out the leader of the organization, along with a few of his men. "Target eliminated Captain!" he said, firing at the shooters from below.
Tony didn’t respond. He simply looked up, and stared into Steve’s blue eyes. And in them, Steve found the answer.
She was really angry for Bruce having sent her on this blind date in the first place. Really, she could have at least picked someone who would show up on time, and NOT be an hour late! Not even a call, seriously, this was insane.  "Oh you're just going to love her Toni, she's tall, blonde, blue eyes, just gorgeous. Just give her a chance! Ever since you broke up with Pepper, you've been such a Debby downer! It's time for you to get back out there!" The words replayed in Toni's head, and she snorted. "Get back out there my ass." She began to collect her things, before someone began to approach the table.
The soldier didn't answer. He simply headed for the stairs, heading up them with ease. Tony rested his head against Steve's chest, eyes closing slowly. He napped for a bit, and before he knew what was happening, he felt himself being placed down on his bed, and a pair of warm, familiar lips on his own.
He walked over to his large stereo, popped in a Black Sabbath CD, and turned the volume on high. Ozzy's voice vibrated the whole room, and a loud yell emanated from the room next to his.
could be heard over the din of plates and whir of blenders. Not many inhabited the small cafe. A few people on their laptops, and two couples.
"Ooh, vanilla!" Steve chuckled, and Tony sighed with relief. The rest joined him, and they all proceeded to eat cake off each other’s faces, and throw it around the room. Natasha and Clint dominated the cake war, with Clint going so far as to get a rubber band and fling it at the others. Steve was having a great time. It was the first time in a long time he didn't think about the war, or Bucky.
"That sounds just fine to me, Captain." Tony muttered, kissing Steve deeply, who responded quickly, smiling against the kiss.
“Hi Steve, by the time you begin to watch this, and if Pepper is still loyal, I’ll be dead.” He chewed on his lip before continuing. “I’m sorry I had to do it this way, but I thought it’d be easier than you trying to come and save me from the inevitable. My arc reactor stopped working about a month ago. Bruce and I tried everything to fix it, but it was no use. The damn thing just gave out, and I knew I would be dead soon enough. Bruce managed to keep me going for a while, but after a bit, I got tired of living. I got tired of having to deal with the thought of you waking up to find me…” His voice trailed off. “That’s why I pulled the divorce stunt. I thought, maybe if you were mad at me, it’d be easier to let me go. Maybe then you wouldn’t have to deal with the thought of me dying slowly.” He wiped a tear away, and sniffled. “I hope I was right. It was a lie, all those things I said. I never stopped loving you Steve, not even as I say these final words. I wanted to spend my final moments with you and Peter, I really did. But things don’t work out that way do they? We don’t always get what we want.” Tony sighed, and looked directly into the camera, as if he was looking into Steve’s eyes. “I love you Steven G Rogers. And I never want you to forget that. Goodbye.”
Tony was screaming into his pillow, and Steve was pretty sure he wasn't being too quiet himself. He reached around to Tony's front, pumping the other man's cock with the motion of his hips, wanting to get him off, wanting him to call out his name, to be the one to make Tony Stark, the Tony Stark, to beg for more.
"I can't tell you I saw this coming, I really never planned for any of this to happen." Tony sighed, and ran a hand through his dark hair. "I understand if you hate me now, if you never want to speak to me again. I can't blame you. But, just know, I did love you, and I will never forget what we had together." he said, reaching for her hand. But she quickly pulled away. "Just go, I'll pack up my things, and find a place to stay. Thank you for everything Tony." Pepper whispered, smiling at him brokenly.
"Sure, fire away." Tony said, trying to ignore the twisted knot in his stomach. "Why did you come today?" The blond asked, locking eyes with Tony. "Because Pepper told me if I didn't go out to lunch with you I wouldn't be eating at all today." The brunette lied. "What about you? Why are you here?"
"Come on Cap, I'm starved." Tony said as he removed his coat and boots. Steve nodded, doing the same. They walked into the large dining area to see the other avengers gathered around the table, eating. "Hey, Tony! I got great news," Bruce said excitedly, wiping crumbs off his face. Tony and Steve sat and began to load their plates with food as Bruce told them the news. "We got invited as guests of honor to attend a special technology convention dinner party! Guests, of, honor." he tapped his finger on the table with each word, and Tony nearly dropped his plate. "Are you serious? That's great!" Tony had been a guest of honor to quite a few things, but he knew how much this meant to Bruce.
"We've found that one of our agents had been leaking some of our plans to a terrorist organization. We need you to go in there and stop them, destroy the plans, and all traces of it." The Avengers picked up on his emphasis of the sentence. He wanted them to kill anyone that seemed like a threat. "Why are we going after them? Doesn't this seem like something for the army?" Tony questioned, a little more than confused. "What does it matter? We have a job to do, and we need to do it." Steve growled, glaring at the brunette. He glared back, before pushing his chair out. "Let's go then. The sooner we get these guys the better."
He shook his head as he went into the kitchen to make breakfast, getting eggs and bacon out of the fridge. He whistled happily to himself, and heard an annoyed grumble come from the bedroom as Tony stirred, and got out of bed. He strutted out after a few minutes, wearing a robe and some sweats. "You think it's funny to have me wake up alone? I'm sick of doing that you know." he growled, pressing his forehead against Steve's bare bicep, kissing it. Steve chuckled, and turned away from the food to wrap his arms around the man. "Well, I figured you'd be hungry after last night." The blond teased, kissing Tony.
“All for show? Clint even noticed! What if anybody else had? What if someone catches on?” she hissed, fear rising within her. “No one’s going to catch on Natasha. Don’t you worry your pretty little head.” Tony teased, and Natasha looked as if she was about to murder him. “Here you two go. Two whiskeys on the rocks. And a vanilla vodka for my little lady.” Clint purred as he handed them their drinks. “Cheers, to a lovely night with friends.” Steve said, raising his glass. “Cheers!” the others said, and Steve and Tony downed their drinks in one gulp; Natasha hanging onto hers; she wasn't in the mood to drink at this point.
“Yeah, I do.” he mumbled, and continued walking towards Natasha. She tried to hide the amused look on her face; even more so when Tony shot her the dirtiest look he could muster up. She looked at Steve, who gave her a soft smile, and shrugged his shoulders as if to say, W
Steve chuckled a bit, remembering Tony's past comments on his shirts. The blond shook his head slowly, those days were over now, he wasn't going to get those back, even after Christine was done with him and finally got rid of the pictures forever. He and Tony saw what they would be like together, and sometimes, enough times, it wasn't pretty.
"Well, not really, but I think I could learn, if you're willing to show me." The blond says, smirking. Tony laughs breathlessly, before pulling the older man towards the dance floor. And as if some sort of silent understanding was reached, the bodies seperate to allow in the new partners, and Steve almost chokes a bit on the sudden humidity change.
Steve turned around to see a petite blond, wearing a low cut and extremely provocative red dress. Steve looked indifferently; he wasn’t into easy girls, or any girl at the moment. “My name is Christine,” She smiled, sticking her hand out towards him. He took it, and smiled. He may as well be polite. “I saw you on the dance floor, and I thought to myself, I just couldn’t let a man like that slip through my fingers.” Christine batted her eyes, touching Steve’s arm.
“I guess that makes me first.” Jane said, reaching out for her gift. They had done secret Santa’s figuring it would be the best way to get everyone a gift while not spending too much. Jane got a pair of shoes, red and silver, to match Thor’s Asgardian outfit. Bruce got a pair of elastic pants, wide enough to fit the hulk. Natasha kept her gift hidden from the rest. Clint got standard S.H.I.E.L.D targets; Pepper got a long and elegant dress, an obvious gift from Natasha. Tony got a new pair of high tech goggles, ones that tinted when working with brighter lights. Thor received a cell phone. “I’m not sure if it’ll work in Asgard, Clint shrugged, “But it’s worth a shot.” Steve had convinced the other’s to allow him to go last.
"It's my favorite flavor of soda, and besides, I don't drink." Stephanie said plainly, looking over her menu absent minded. "So, Ms. Stark, what do you do for a living?"
"Capscle! I see you're enjoying yourself." Tony smiles through hazy eyes at the supersoldier, and Steve can practically taste the liquor that his friend currently sweats. He could probaby get a buzz from just one lick of that man's sweet skin.
Pepper hit him hard across the face, a loud crack shattering the silence of the room. "Get out!" She yelled, eyes glaring at Steve, who didn't say anything as he rushed out of the room, glancing over as Tony rubbed his cheek, a red imprint already beginning to show.
"Was this all part of your plan to get out of this date?" Stephanie asked, passing back the folder and grinning. "Because if it is, you're going to have to try a lot harder than that. So tell me, Miss Stark," the blonde leaned over the table, placing her chin in her hands. "How much do you know about little old me?"
"Steve," Tony cried, and the super sodier pushed the gun far enough away that Tony couldn't reach it, and quickly pulled the brunnette into a hug. Tony cried into Steve's shirt, staining it with tears. "I couldn't take it anymore; I wanted it all to end. I wanted the guilt to go away. I was never good enough for him, he didn't want me." Tony muttered quickly, and Steve smoothed Tony's hair back away from his tear stained face. "I want you. I need you. You can't go. I won't let you." Steve admitted, and another tear fell down Tony's face. "I won't let you die too." he pulled him into another hug, trying to calm the broken man. "I'm sorry."
He turned his attention back to Christine. "Why do you want me? Of all people?" he questioned. "Good question. I guess because you were a challenge, something I haven’t tried yet." She narrowed her eyes and smiled "Someone who can hit Tony where it hurts."
"Alright!" Ashley's face brightened, and she grabbed a napkin and a pen from her purse. "Here's my number. Why don't you give me a call when you’re free?" she asked, sliding the napkin his way. He picked it up, grinning like a fool. "Sure. I definitely will." "What the hell Steve, I leave you for less than an hour and your talking to some blonde?" Tony's angry voice caused the two to turn around, Ashley confused, and Steve, he looked as if he had a mix of anger and embarrassment crossing his face.
Tony pumped himself a few more times, hips bucking furiously and fingers moving fast as he finally released, coming finally. Only moments later, Steve did as well. The soldier stood there with his pants around his ankles and his hand on his dick, trying to wrap his hand around what had just occured. He watched as Tony kicked off the messy sheets and shut off the light. For some reason, Steve just couldn't wait for this to happen again. The blond went off to bed, falling asleep rather quickly, and dreaming of nothing.
"And what makes you think I still want to sit here? You're over an hour late, Miss Rogers, and quite frankly, I have better things to do than sit here and be stood up." Toni remarked, standing up and smoothing out her dress. She didn't look back as she began to walk out, but a hand on her arm did force her to stop.
They walked over to the landing helicopter, pushing past the crowd that had now gathered. Director Fury hopped off to greet them, a serious look on his face. "Avengers! How are you all?" he asked politely. "We're all fine, but I think I can ask for everyone when we wonder why you’re visiting us in the middle of a park, on a helicopter." Clint yelled over the sound of the blades cutting through the air.
"You too Pepper." He hung up without saying goodbye, and ran out to his car; he needed to get away for a little bit. He didn't want to think about how Steve wouldn't be sleeping beside him tonight, or any night. Tony got into his car, pulling out into traffic without looking and almost hitting a cab driver. He drove to the tower, deciding some flight practice wouldn't be such a bad idea.
Steve and Tony turned around to see Natasha and Clint hand in hand, with Bruce trailing behind them, munching on some sort of street food. The two moved towards them, happy to finally see some familiar faces. "Fury said he'll be here any second. Knowing that man, he'll probably be coming in on a-" Natasha began before Bruce cut her off. "Helicopter?" They all turned to see the young man staring straight at them.
Steve pushed Tony down onto the bed, sliding his hands beneath his shirt, reacquainting himself with the brunette’s fit body. He kissed him slowly as he lifted the shirt above the smaller man's head, breaking the kiss only to fully remove the clothing. He quickly reunited their lips, moaning a bit as Tony undid the blond's pants, sliding his hands past his boxers, running his hands over his perfect ass, pulling his hips down into his own. The two ground their hips together as Steve took off his shirt, allowing the other man to marvel at the body he had been dreaming of every night since they had broken up.
Bruce watched silently, and did as Tony asked. He decided not to push the topic any further, and he began to drive them back to the hotel, looking back now and then to watch the broken man behind him.
Steve laughed, and the two headed their separate ways to get ready. The soldier looked back at him, watching Tony's limp grow with each step he took towards the door.
Peter stared daggers at the DVD. He wished it would just throw itself into the garbage.  He didn't want to watch it. He didn't want to look at it. But something inside him told him to. Something inside of him forced him to pick up the DVD and put it in the player, and sit on his chair and watch as his father stared back at him. He smiled weakly, looking just as he did in Steve's video.
Tony's head was spinning, and he released into the blond's hand as he moaned out Steve's name, eyes fluttering as he rode his orgasm, and the soldier came a moment after, pulling out of the brunette, and pressing their sweaty foreheads together, kissing each other breathlessly, mutterings of "I love you"s repeated over and over, seeming as they could never say them enough.
“Are we talking about dinner or Tony?” Steve joked, and Natasha almost fell out of her chair laughing.
They moved out to the cold outside, and Tony immediately regretted not having grabbed a jacket. He rubbed his arms, and watched his breath form a fog in front of his face. "Here." Tony looked up to see Steve offering him his jacket, and the brunette smirked. "I'll be fine." He waved his hand again, but Steve wouldn't have it. He threw the jacket over the younger man's shoulder, and held it there.
Tony rubbed the back of his neck, unsure of what to tell him. He didn't want to share Steve tonight. Tonight was
Tony pulled Steve closed, and allowed the blond to begin the lead. "Let's see what you got Cap." he said, eyes full of passion. Steve led him backwards, and Tony lifted his leg to allow Steve to dip him. He did as prompted and lifted Tony back up only to spin them around. Neither noticed the dance floor clearing in order to make way for the dancing couple.
"No, you don't." Tony stated, trying to keep his voice still. "Steve and I found something in each other, something we hadn't found in anyone else; it's different with him Pepper! I love him, and I know he loves me, I can't see my life without him anymore," He looked at Pepper, sympathy on his face. "I'm sorry, I wish I could have told you, I never wanted to hurt you...I loved you, I really did, but-" "But now you don't, and you want it to end. I understand Tony." She said, taking in a shaky breath.
"Boy? I'd like to think that I'm far from any 'boy'." The woman said, placing a hand on her hip, quirking an eyebrow and not bothering to suppress a smirk as she did. "You must be Toni Stark; I'm sorry that I'm late, but I had some matters to attend to. I'm Stephanie Rogers, and I'll be you're date tonight." The woman, Stephanie, made her way around and sat herself down, smiling the whole time. Toni wasn't amused.
"Put on the suit, and meet me back at Stark Towers. Let's just see how tough you are without walls to separate us." Steve growled, and he slammed the door behind him, leaving an equally pissed Tony on the floor. "Alright, he wants a fight? I'll give him a fight." The man growled as he rubbed his jaw, glaring after the blond.
"I don't like to be handed things Cap, you should know that by now." Tony smirked as he walked towards the roof top door, leaving the super soldier standing alone. Steve looked out once more over New York, before walking slowly to meet up with Tony, pushing his memory back into the vault that was his mind.
"Yes sir." Both said, still glaring at one another. "Come on Christine." Steve growled, not taking his eyes off Tony's. The brunette watched them leave, and glared after them. "Get moving Stark." Fury ordered, and Tony nodded. "On it." he growled, and went back to take off his suit. It was only until he was sure no one would see him did he let himself cry.
“I don’t know if I can keep doing this Steve.” Tony whispered between passionate kisses. The two lovers had joined in Steve’s hotel room, considering it to be the safest place. Bruce was just about always in the lab, and Clint liked to surprise Tony with his little assassin tactics. No one really visited Steve, thinking that he was at the gym with his new toy.
"Yeah." The blond muttered, before looking back up at Tony, smiling lightly. "So, we'll keep this a secret? Act like it never happened?"
A loud banging caught Tony's attention, and he noticed the door vibrating with a force. He walked over and pulled it open to see a very angry Steve standing in his door, hair a mess, clothes that were carelessly thrown on, and eyes burning with anger. "Captain, to what do I owe this pleasure?" Tony teased. The blond said nothing, instead using his clenched hand to speak with Mr. Stark.
Tony sensed the explosion from where he hid, in the place Steve left him. "No," he whispered, and flew up. He didn't care about the on coming onslaught, all he needed to do right now was get to Steve. The smoke rose up from the small ditch, and Tony did a scan for any life. He found none. "Steve! Steve, come in!" he yelled over the device that linked him to the soldier. No reply.
The blond nodded, and the tears came too fast for him to try and hide them. Tony had died almost five months ago, he was shot down in battle, and died in Steve's arms. Tony told Steve with his dying breath that he loved him, and Steve was too much in shock to say anything. He kissed the dying man for the first, and last time. Five months had passed, and he still had dreams where he had been the one to die; and Tony was okay. Five months, and nothing had changed.
Tony wasn't able to do the same, considering he was fumbling with Steve's shirt buttons, and finally growled a, "Fuck it," and lifted the shirt off the blond, separating them for a split moment. The blond took a second to take in what was happening. He was in a room with Tony Stark- his bedroom, to be exact, and they were about to fuck.
Steve stood over him, a smile on his face. "You done yet?" Tony asked, an amused look on his handsome face. "Yup." Steve stuck out his hand to help up Tony, who accepted it gratefully. "Hey, what do you say we go out for some coffee? My treat." The blond offered, and the other man simply nodded. It was the best he could manage. Steve patted him on the back, and Tony winced in pain, but tried not to let it show.
“Not fair Tony,” Steve teased, nuzzling his face in Tony’s blazer. “You know you love it.” Tony teased back, breathing in Steve’s sweet, masculine scent. “Want to go inside yet?” asked Steve, hoping the answer would be a no. “One more minute. I like this.” Tony whispered. It was nice, the fact that they could simply stand there and just enjoy each other’s presence. Tony didn’t feel judged, or like Steve wanted anything from him. All he wanted was for Tony to be with him, just to be there.
"Since we're in the twenty-first century." Tony laughed as Steve's face scrunched in confusion. "I've heard plenty of people call it soda." he muttered as he popped the tab, and took a sip of the cream soda. His favorite. "Maybe back in the forties," Tony grumbled as he stole the can from Steve's hand and took some for himself. "Why does it matter if I call it pop or soda?" Steve sighed, growing tired of the argument. "Just curious. Geeze, don't get so defensive." the brunette muttered as he handed Steve back his drink. "I grew up calling it soda. I never saw a reason to call it anything different now." he admitted quietly, taking another sip.
“Eat your doughnut big guy.” she joked as she sat next to him. Clint smiled, and did as he was told. Steve looked at the couple with jealousy, a distant memory forcing its way into his current thoughts. He sipped his luke-warm coffee and grimaced. “Nothing worse than cold coffee. I’m going to get another cup, anyone want anything while I’m up?” he asked as he dumped his cup in a planter.
The brunette moaned as Steve began to pump his finger, adding another a moment after. "Oh God Steve," he whispered, short of breath, and sweat begging to run down his forehead. He needed to feel him, needed to have him inside of him. Steve gave his fingers a quick crook of his fingers before removing them, and replacing them with his cock, grunting as he entered the brunette. They shared a breath of complete ecstasy, and the soldier began to pump his hips, trying to get as deep into the other man as possible. Tony bent back his legs, begging for Steve to go harder, and he grabbed onto his hips as he did, moaning out Tony's name, breathing heavy. "I've missed you so much," the soldier whispered, moving his hand to the brunette's front, and taking him into his hand, pumping his length, moving with the motion of his hips, tightening and loosening his hand, listening to Tony moaning beneath him.
Tony rubbed his eyes, wiping away tears that finally managed to spill. He grabbed a napkin from the table, and pressed it into his bloody palm, blood leaking from where his nails had dug into his skin. The pain from his failing arc reactor was getting worse. It wouldn’t be too long till he finally passed. He knew he had a week at best, a week left to live. A week to let everyone he loved go.
"Nah, I'll call us a cab. You look like you need a good night's sleep. We won't be out much later." The brunette told him as the bartender came over with a round of shots. "Get gone. We'll be in before four." Bruce laughed and helped Clint out of his chair. He stumbled blindly, bumping into the table and causing the drinks to shake. "Oh, before I forget. Give me your keys." He was obviously referring to Tony, but his pockets were empty. Clint had begun walking towards the door, but spun on his heels to wave goodbye.
"I'd have to agree. So what do you say we do this again sometime, Mr. Stark?" Steve lifted one hand to hold it against the brunet's turning his face to kiss his palm.
“Don’t break him Thor.” Jane laughed, patting the seat next to her. Thor joined her eagerly, causing her to bounce with the force. “So you’re Jane, it’s nice to finally meet you.” Steve greeted and offered her a hand. She took it with a smile. “Alright! All the guests are here, so why don’t we head into the dining room and enjoy ourselves a nice Christmas dinner?” Pepper suggested, Tony hanging on her waist. Steve swallowed hard, that jealous feeling rising in him once again. “Hell yeah! I’m starving!” Clint cheered as he headed into the dining room, Bruce and Natasha following after.  “I’ll be there in a sec. You all go ahead.” Steve mumbled, jerking his thumb in the direction of the bathroom. Everyone else nodded; Thor and Jane got up from the couch and followed the other couple into the dining room.
“All for show? Clint even noticed! What if anybody else had? What if someone catches on?” she hissed, fear rising within her. “No one’s going to catch on Natasha. Don’t you worry your pretty little head.” Tony teased, and Natasha looked as if she was about to murder him. “Here you two go. Two whiskeys on the rocks. And a vanilla vodka for my little lady.” Clint purred as he handed them their drinks. “Cheers, to a lovely night with friends.” Steve said, raising his glass. “Cheers!” the others said, and Steve and Tony downed their drinks in one gulp; Natasha hanging onto hers; she wasn't in the mood to drink at this point.
appreciates my decorating.” Pepper teased as she greeted the blond. “I never said I didn’t appreciate it!” Tony laughed, pulling her into a kiss. Steve fought back the jealous feeling rising in him.
They finally made it to Tony's room, and Steve reached into the other man's pant pockets, looking for the room key. The brunette pushed off Steve in protest. "The hell are you doing Cap?" he asked angrily. "Listen; just give me your keys so we can get you to bed." The soldier ordered, not in the mood for Tony's petty games.
"I know all about you Captain, I read your file." The brunette bent over, reaching into her purse and pulling out a manila folder, passing it over. Inside Stephanie saw her records, all things that S.H.I.E.L.D had kept on her since long before she had begun to work there.
thought that since you've missed so many birthdays, it wouldn't hurt to throw you a surprise party!" the assassin corrected himself, but not before Tony sent him a dirty look.
Steve pushed himself off of Tony, and quickly laid him back on his shoulder. The brunette remained on Steve's shoulder, his head comfortable in the crevice of his neck. The blond moved over to the door and placed the key in. The door opened, and they slowly made their way to the bedroom.
Tony watched as he left, sighing softly. "So he doesn't love you?" Bruce asked, and the brunette looked at his smirking friend. "No, he doesn't. He may have once, but not anymore." He muttered, looking at his food, with a sudden loss in appetite. "The guy froze up when I said the word 'love'," The scientist argued, and Tony looked up at him, glaring. "Probably because he knows I'm still head over heels in love with him, and he doesn't want to be reminded of it. It's not hard to fall out of love with someone Bruce; I've done it plenty of times before." he growled, standing, and beginning to move towards the door.
"Hey Cap," Tony murmured. Steve looked over, and was immediately doused in orange soda. "Dammit Tony!" he yelled as he scrambled for a towel. Tony laughed by the pool, teasing Steve with his towel. "Looking for something?" he smirked, and Steve stood. "Oh come on, you know that was hilarious." Tony said, trying to hold back more laughter. "So is this." Steve smirked, and pushed the brunette into the pool. Tony cried out as Steve grabbed the towel from his hands. The brunette came up a few moments later, sputtering and coughing. The super soldier smirked by the edge of the pool, toweling off. "You're an ass." Tony muttered, swimming to where Steve stood. "Help me out." "No you're going to pull me in with you." Steve laughed, tossing his towel to the side. "Shut up and help me out will you?" Tony demanded, and Steve rolled his eyes.
Steve grabbed the laptop from the nightstand, and turned it on. He popped the disk into the CD drive, and immediately Tony’s face appeared. He looked weak, there were dark circles under his eyes, and the arc reactor was dim through his black tank.
"See? We can still be lovers." Tony whispered, keeping a bored look on his face. “I know Tony, but I-" Steve began, but stopped when he heard the soft music beginning to play. A slow smile spread across his face. "You want to dance Mr. Stark?" he asked, releasing Tony's hand and beginning to stand. The brunette looked up in shock. "Do you think you can?" he asked, looking the soldier up and down.
With that, Steve immediately rose and stormed out of the cafe, his appetite ruined. Tony chased after him, throwing a fist full of money down on the table. "Wait, come on! You know I was joking right?" Tony called him as Steve got on his motorcycle. The brunette stepped in front of it, receiving a menacing glare from a certain Steve Rogers. "Out of the way Stark, I'm not in the mood for games." The blond growled, and revved the engine.
The two had barely been able to keep their hands off one another in the cab, and Steve had gotten a little rough in the elevator ride up; Tony was pretty sure there would be a nice dent in one of the walls. But at that moment, he couldn't have given less of a fuck. They made it to the room, and Steve tore off Tony's shirt so quickly that some of the buttons flew off.
"Next month. It says I can bring a guest, so... Anybody want to go with me?" Bruce grinned sheepishly, obviously embarrassed for having to ask. "Count me out." Tony grumbled as he popped two slices of bread in a toaster. The scientist looked to Steve, who pursed his lips in thought. "Why don't you ask around, I'd like to go, it'd be nice to get myself acquainted with some other technology, but if you can find someone better take them." Bruce nodded in agreement, and they all stood in silence.
"So what's wrong?" Tony asked, keeping his eyes straight ahead. Steve followed his gaze, watching the dark storm clouds roll over New York City. "Nothing, just, old memories." The blond muttered, picking at the concrete of the roof. He didn't want to bug Tony with his problems. He didn't want to make the other feel as if he was a weak man.
"Oh so suddenly it's my fault that you're in a pissy mood?" Tony glared at the larger man. "We're a team now Cap, we're supposed to care about each other! Watch over each other and make sure to keep each other safe. You knew that when you took on the role of leader."
This was it. This was her chance. No one was going to believe it. She pulled out her iPhone, but stopped. “No, I have to get more proof. Maybe I can use this to my advantage.” She sneered, and headed inside.
He tried to pull away, but Tony wouldn't take no for an answer. He continued to sing, and Steve simply laughed as he was pushed onto a stool that they had set out. "Oh, cant you see? You belong to me. Now my poor heart aches with every step you take!" he serenaded Steve, watching as his face turned red and he tugged at his ears. Tony smirked, and took his hand. The song began to end, and Steve seemed to stand up to be leaving. The brunette looked at him sadly, before the soldier kissed him, and uttered the final words for him. "I'll be watching you." he smiled, and left Tony up on stage, grinning like a fool.
The blond looked at him, a broken smile on his lips. "I hope everything works out for you and Pepper." Steve stood, picking up the folder. "It was nice while it lasted." And with that, he turned around, and walked out of the cafe. Tony was left alone. He had expected it, but... He thought he would be the one to do it...
"What are we Tony? Are we friends? Are we together? Or am I just your fuck buddy?" Steve's words stabbed through Tony's heart. He felt his lip quivering; he didn't know what to say.
"Oh, and another thing, I thought that maybe we could eat dinner in my apartment?" Tony offered. Steve gave him a suspicious look, wondering what he had planned. "I don't see why not." the blond muttered, and grabbed his wallet from the table. "Alright, let's go then." The smaller man quickly got up from his place on the couch and headed over to the door, wanting to get the night started as soon as possible.
“Merry Christmas Cap!” Tony said as he welcomed the super soldier into his home. The Malibu house had been decorated in the most beautiful way. “Pepper?” Steve asked as he waltzed in, gifts in hand. “Who else?” Tony chuckled, and patted his lover on the back. It was the best they could do considering all the guests. “Well, she did a lovely job.” Steve muttered as they walked into the living room. “Why thank you Steve. It’s nice to know
He felt himself move forward, and Bruce wrapped him in a tight hug. "I'm sorry; I didn't realize how difficult this was for you." He muttered as Tony hugged him back. "No, you don't need to apologize, you're right... But I just can't do that. Not yet." He pushed his friend away, giving him a sad look. "I think it's time you knew, the truth." Tony pulled Bruce over to the chairs, and they sat down. The man explained everything that happened after the fight with Steve, he explained the deal with Christine, how if he tried anything, the pictures would leak, and it would completely destroy Pepper, and Tony's reputation.
"So what makes you think Tony and I hooked up?" Steve growled. "Oh please Steven, I may be blond, but I'm not an idiot. You love Tony, and you know you can't go through your life without him with you. And I know you'd do anything to keep him by your side." Christine said, crossing her arms over her chest as she leaned back on her desk. "So, what's it going to be Steve? Are you going to sleep with me, and I'll destroy the pictures, or are you going to go back to Tony, and let the whole world know your secret?" The soldier looked down, sighing. "Neither." He muttered, and the reporter was caught off guard.
Steve gave him a nod of approval. "I trust you." "Steve! There you are!" Tony's voice entered the happy moment, and the two men looked to see him with a Brandy in his hand, and an overly happy look on his face. "Hey Brucie. You having fun?" Bruce rolled his eyes, and smiled. The man never ceased to amuse him. "Yeah, your boyfriend and I were just talking." Tony's smile fell from his face, and he opened his mouth to defend himself. "He knows Tony." Steve cut the man off before he could make a fool out of them. "What?" Tony looked at them astonished, and Bruce shrugged. "Lucky guess."
"My name's Ashley. It's nice to finally talk to you." She smiled, and Steve smiled back. "I'll leave you two alone." Tony mumbled in the blond's ear, and he got up, leaving the two to mingle. The brunette sighed, and walked to a booth, figuring Steve would be able to fend for himself, which meant Tony could get as drunk as physically possible, and get rid of the impending jealousy.
Steve grabbed his arm, stopping Tony in in his tracks. "Hey," He embraced the brunette in a long hug, nothing special, just a simple hug. But it meant everything to them; they separated, and headed back to their tables. "You okay Tony? You're shivering." Pepper mumbled as Tony sat down. "Um, yeah. It's pretty chilly in those bathrooms." He tried to cover his tracks, and his girlfriend seemed to buy it. The waiter returned, and they placed their orders.
Was that a sign that she wanted him to ask her out? Or was he just assuming things? "Y-yeah. I um, my friends are usually all so busy." The soldier looked down at the drink, suddenly wishing he
"What? You've never seen two men dance before?" Tony snapped, and the group put their heads down, muttering under their breaths. He turned his attention back to Steve, who was blushing furiously, "Relax Steve. Don't worry about them. It's just you and me right now." The blond let out a breath, and the two began to dance, keeping the beat of the song.
“Damn guys! That was awesome!” Clint exclaimed as the two reached him and Natasha. They nodded thanks, still trying to catch their breath. “Let me buy you two a drink, on the house.” Clint offered, and headed in the direction of the bar. When he was out of ear shot, Natasha shoved both of the men hard. “Are you nuts? What the hell was that?” she growled, lowering her voice.  “Oh come on Natasha, it was a simple dance. It was all for show.” Steve said, shrugging as if it was no big deal.
Steve pulled away from the kiss, and mumbled goodbye. Ashley said her goodbye, feeling as if she was walking on air. She closed the door behind her and fell to the floor in pure bliss. The soldier bounded off, wondering if he could hail a cab. He recognized Tony's car speeding off, and his gut wrenched. He had hoped that he hadn't seen what had just happened, but in his heart, he knew he had.
"I like this song, it's fun." Steve said into Tony's ear. "Yeah, it is." He smiled, closing his eyes and still dancing with the man. The song ended, and some couples began to leave the dance floor as a slower song came on. "Uh, would you, you want to," Steve stammered as he let go of Tony, allowing him to turn around. "Get some food? Sure." Tony finished the man's sentence, a bit saddened to leave Steve's arms, but he knew he had to.
Steve sighed, and went to pack his things. He knew his flight would be leaving soon; he had planned a cross country trip, planning on seeing the sights, figuring out what he wanted to do with his life. But, a bit of him already had it planned out. He just needed the rest of him to figure it out.
“I guess that makes me first.” Jane said, reaching out for her gift. They had done secret Santa’s figuring it would be the best way to get everyone a gift while not spending too much. Jane got a pair of shoes, red and silver, to match Thor’s Asgardian outfit. Bruce got a pair of elastic pants, wide enough to fit the hulk. Natasha kept her gift hidden from the rest. Clint got standard S.H.I.E.L.D targets; Pepper got a long and elegant dress, an obvious gift from Natasha. Tony got a new pair of high tech goggles, ones that tinted when working with brighter lights. Thor received a cell phone. “I’m not sure if it’ll work in Asgard, Clint shrugged, “But it’s worth a shot.” Steve had convinced the other’s to allow him to go last.
"Listen Christine, all I'm saying is: I'm not afraid of you anymore. I'll play along with this little game, pretend like it's still a big deal; but really, you're not going to get anything out of this. I won't sleep with you." Steve said calmly, and a flash of pure anger flashed over Christine's face. "Stop the car. I'm getting out." She ordered. The soldier shook his head slowly. "I don't think so. We have a date that you planned, and I think we should keep to it. And besides, what kind of man would I be if I dropped a dame like you off in the middle of the highway with no way to get home?"
"Uh, Steve?" Steve turned around quickly and saw a young Ashley before him. She wore a cashmere sweater, and a pair of jeans that complimented her petite figure. He smiled, and hugged her hello. "Hi Ash, how're you?" he mumbled as he tried not to crush her. This was going to be their first date; Steve was glad she hadn't cancelled after what had happened at the bar. "I'm fine thanks. Are you ready to see the movie?" she asked, her smile growing wider as she stared into his beautiful blue eyes. Ashley had had a few boyfriends, but none of them had lasted long. And after she officially met Steve, she hoped they would be able to be more than just a small fling.
Steve pulled away from the hug for a short second, to place a short peck on Tony’s lips. “I think everyone is probably wondering where we are, don’t you?” he mumbled, locking eyes with his lover. “Yeah… But I don’t want to go in yet.” Tony playfully pouted, nuzzling Steve’s chest. “Come on boy.” Steve joked, pulling away from the hug and taking Tony’s hand. The two released their hands before walking back into the building.
"Hello Stevie. I was so worried that you weren't going to be back home in time for dinner." Christine greeted Steve as walked into S.H.I.E.L.D's headquarters. He looked over, surprised. "How the hell did you get in here?" he asked as she threw her arms around his neck. "I have my ways darling." she muttered, kissing him lightly. Steve kissed back, pretending to have missed her. Tony walked in, helmet in hand, and saw the little display. He snorted. "Someone better alert the guards that one of the mutts got out." he muttered beneath his breath.
Steve sighed as he lay back on the bed. "I don't know Pepper, I don't think it's a good idea, me and Tony haven't talked in at least two months, and I don't think Christine would really appreciate me seeing him, not after what he said to her." he justified, and Pepper scoffed over the phone. "That's why I planned this whole thing. You two need to start talking again, Tony hasn't been the same since you two had your fight." she said, and Steve ran a hand over his face. "Listen-"
"Steve! Cut it out!" Tony complained as the blond locked his head in his arm. "Say uncle." Steve taunted. Tony ground his teeth, trying to find a way to slip out of the headlock. "Say it or I'll screw up your hair." The soldier threatened, enjoying the feel of power. "You wouldn't dare." The other man growled.
Steve wanted him, oh, how he had wanted him. He wanted to feel his touch; he wanted to feel their bodies colliding, free of all things that held them back. Tony tried to bring their bodies closer, wanting to feel the heat. He wanted Steve to warm his icy heart, to make a fool out of him,
Tony got up. He needed to find Steve, and explain everything. "JARVIS, can you get me a reading on where Cap is?" The man asked as he began to walk towards the elevator. "I'm afraid not sir." The AI said. "Guess I'm going on a wild goose chase then." the brunette muttered under his breath, and clicked the lobby button. "I'll find him."
"I didn't. And I'm pretty sure you haven't told me what you really do, Miss Rogers." Toni knew when someone was lying, and this woman had bullshit written all over her face.
Tony took his free hand and turned Steve's head towards him. "Listen. You know me well enough to know that whatever the hell you say, isn't going to change anything." The brunette stared into Steve's beautiful blue eyes that seemed so much darker now. He wanted to know what he was thinking, why he was acting this way. And Tony could only hope it was the same reason that he wanted it to be.
"Stark! Stark it's over! Come in Stark!" Clint's voice broke through Tony's blind fury, and he landed, falling to his knees with exhaustion.
And so, he did. Without thinking, Steve stepped up to Tony and kissed him. Their lips danced with each other, a spark- no- a flame igniting with the simple touch between them. The soldier held Tony tight, wanting to be as close to him as possible. The brunette pressed against Steve with a passion, the cold of the metal seeping through the blond's clothing, but he felt nothing. His body was on fire, and it was the only thing he could feel. Tony's body melted under the blond's touch, and he wanted to shed the metal that encased him, the metal that kept him from truly connecting with this man, the one man that he finally realized he
The rest of the dinner went by smoothly. Steve felt as if he was part of a really big family, and he was grateful that he could spend his first Christmas awake with all his friends. Thor told his amazing stories of his adventures on Asgard. Clint and Natasha danced around the subject of Budapest, never revealing any real facts. Steve was able to speak about a few war memories, ones that didn’t involve Peggy or Bucky; everyone hanging on his words. Pepper, Natasha, and Jane all got along relatively well, not too good but not too bad either. After dinner was a desert fit for Thor. Pop tarts and coffee. There was of course apple pies and fondue for the others, causing Steve to chuckle to himself.  He avoided the topic of Howard though, not wanting to upset Tony.
"Well look at you two! Finally friends I see?" A deep voice boomed from behind them. They turned, and grinned. "Director Fury, you should know better to judge a scene from first sight." Tony's voice was light, and Steve smiled. Fury shook their hands with a firm grip, loosening his red tie. "You're right, but I've never been wrong now have I?" Fury joked, and the three laughed. Steve looked around nervously, trying to find a way to get away from the conversation while he could. He had nothing against Fury, he actually liked him, but the blond knew Fury had a way of finding things out, and he didn't know just how much he knew.
He looked at Tony, who looked at him, and they smiled. "I thought I would have lost you there Captain." Tony panted. “Consider it pay back from a few months ago." Laughed Steve, and he rose from the snow, cringing as he finally put weight on his ankles. He cried out with pain, and the brunette caught him. "You alright?" he asked, giving Steve a concerned look. "I'm fine, but I'll need some help getting home." he said smiling. "Think you could give me a lift, Mr. Stark?" Tony placed the man over his shoulders, adjusting him so he was splayed out against his back. "Of course, Captain."
Without warning, Tony shoved himself in Steve, causing them both to cry out with pleasure. The super soldier pulled Tony's head to his, their lips colliding. Steve intertwined his hands in Tony's hair, tugging hard. Tony rammed himself into Steve's prostate, and the pain eased. Tony pushed himself deeper into Steve, moving his hips faster, and he didn't know how much longer he could last. "T-Tony," Steve's voice was weak and Tony smiled enjoying the power. "Go ahead Steve. I want to do what you need to enjoy this moment."
"Oh please Capsicle! You've been frozen in ice for seventy years!" Tony lowered his voice, to help protect Steve's identity, and keep the newly found fans from swarming them.
"Like that?" Steve asked, his voice strong, but his body growing weaker with lust by the second. Tony didn't respond with words, he simply arched his back, pressing himself into the sheets as Steve pressed his fingers deeper inside of him. When the blond finally had his fill, he grabbed a condom, struggling with the packaging, his fingers were shaking so bad.
Merry early Christmas to all of my wonderful readers! I hope this chapter was worth the wait. I promise, I'll try not to drag it out so long next time...Maybe.
Every other night, around 9:30, Tony would shut his blinds. Steve was always curious as to why, His lights never shut off until about an hour later. Steve wondered just what his neighbor could be up to. He and the soldier never carried much of a conversation, seeing as they lived in separate buildings. Steve wasn't one to pry- he respected others privacy as long as they respected his own, but he couldn't help but wonder what went on once the shades went down.
He continued to sing, keeping his eyes locked on Steve's, and he disconnected the microphone from it's stand, making it mobile. He stepped off the stage, making his way to the table at which Steve sat at. "Since you've gone, Ive been lost without a trace, I dream at night, I can only see your face. I look around but it's you I cant replace. I feel so cold and I long for your embrace. I keep crying baby, baby please!" he sang, taking Steve's hand in his own, and taking the soldier by surprise as he pulled him up and lead him to the stage.
Steve rushed to catch him, and the two fell into the snow as he caught Tony in his arms. Tony brought his face to Steve's and laughed. The blond's hair was covered in snow, and the scowl he wore only made it funnier. "It wasn't funny! You could have hurt yourself!" Steve growled, not in a hurry to push Tony off. "Oh come on, you know you love being a hero." Tony said with a smug look. Steve smiled, and without thinking, they kissed. It was short, but Steve thought he felt the snow melt beneath them as soon as their lips touched.
"Mmm, are you sure you don't want a bite Tony? It might make you feel better." Pepper offered the man a bite of her vanilla and chocolate desert, holding it out to him on her fork. Tony shook his head. "It's your cake, enjoy it." he told her, giving her a half smile. "So you want to tell me what you're really thinking about?" she asked, wiping her face with a napkin.
Natasha sighed, happy for the two friends. She could only hope it would stay that way. But Mr. Stark always gets what he wants. Clint entered the room a moment later, and kissed his fiancée hello. Steve made a mock gagging noise, and Tony chuckled. "You two are in good spirits today. What's up with that?" Clint asked, making his way towards the boxing ring.
Steve walked into his bedroom and removed his shirt, then his pants. He could have sworn he heard a giggle. He looked up, ears perked to any noise. "Calm yourself Steve, you’re getting yourself worked up for nothing." the man told himself, and he slipped on a pair of jeans and one of his plaid shirts. He walked out of the room and was immediately started by a bright flash.
“I thought this would really be the best thing to give you.” Tony muttered, watching the super soldier’s reaction. Steve looked up, a mix of pain and gratefulness showing on his face. “How’d you even find this?” Steve asked, running his thumb over the needle kept protected by glass. “It wasn’t easy, took some pretty deep looking, but, I have my ways.” Tony smiled, his eyes twinkling. “Thank you Tony. It’s really the best gift I could ever receive.” Steve said, closing the compass. He placed it in his pants pockets, and everyone went around hugging each other merry Christmas.
"Night guys!" The assassin yelled. The two men waved to him, watching as Bruce quickly ran to catch the almost falling Clint. As soon as they were out of the bar, Tony turned to Steve, a fun thought on his mind. "What do ya say Capsicle? Feeling dangerous?" Tony smiled, his teeth shining in the dim light. Steve would normally have turned him down. He normally would've called Tony an idiot. But tonight, he was up for it.
Okay, so smut happens in this chapter, and please excuse the fact that it may be bad. It's unsaveable I tried guys. There's better smut later *Spoiler alert*
Tony looked back as he heard the door jingle and his heart sank as he saw Steve with that woman, holding hands, and obviously in a rush to get somewhere. An angry blush raged his face, and he turned away, breaking out a flask he keeps hidden in his jacket. Bruce noticed out of the corner of his eye, but brushed it off. He figured Tony just couldn't wait for a drink. He hadn't noticed the couple rushing out the door.
"Hey Tony? Mind if I ask you something?" Steve asked quietly, setting down his menu and looking at the man opposite him.
"We need you to come in Stark, Romanoff is currently going off duty, and we'll need all the help we can get on this job." Fury's voice was stern, he obviously wasn't going to take no for an answer. He was finally calling all the Avengers in, and revealing his big plan that he had been hiding for so long. "You couldn't have worst timing Fury." Tony sighed, rubbing his eyes. "If you haven't heard already, Rogers and I aren't exactly on the best of terms right now." "I don't care about your little social problems Stark. You have a job to do, get your ass down here and do it." Fury demanded, and hung up.
Steve let out a sigh of relief. "You had me scared for a minute." He chuckled, helping Tony up. "I asked for us not to have a repeat of last time, and look what you do." The brunette scowled as he wobbled on his feet. "This is different from last time!" he defended. "I'm not as drunk, and that asshole pushed me down." "But you still hit your head, now why don't I get you home? It's getting late anyways." The blond offered, and began to help Tony out the door. "Thank you, by the way." Steve said as he passed Dianne on the way out. She gave a small wave of her hand. "No problem. Stay safe." She called after them as they left, and caught a cab.
Tony stared out into the room and sipped his coffee. The burning sensation had gone, and a dark stain was visible against his light skin. "I dunno. If Bruce can't get anybody, I'd be glad to go. But I don't like just being handed things." He smiled, thinking about the great days he had spent with Bruce in the lab. The guy truly was a genius, and often helped him out when Pepper was off at meetings. She'd been gone more often than usual, and he missed her...
"Well look at you two! Finally friends I see?" A deep voice boomed from behind them. They turned, and grinned. "Director Fury, you should know better to judge a scene from first sight." Tony's voice was light, and Steve smiled. Fury shook their hands with a firm grip, loosening his red tie. "You're right, but I've never been wrong now have I?" Fury joked, and the three laughed. Steve looked around nervously, trying to find a way to get away from the conversation while he could. He had nothing against Fury, he actually liked him, but the blond knew Fury had a way of finding things out, and he didn't know just how much he knew.
He moved up to the man's neck, kissing his way up to Steve's lips, tangling his fingers in his short blond hair, tugging lightly. The other man felt his chest rising and falling more quickly, and he pulled down the brunette's boxers, sitting up a bit to pull them down all the way, and Tony allowed himself to be put back down on the bed, smiling up at the blond, a gentle but hungry look to his eyes, he had been waiting for this night to come once more. Steve smiled back, before reaching into the nightstand, grabbing the lube, and looking at the brunette, who gave a small nod. "I need you, now." he begged, and the blond nodded, placing some lube in his hands, warming it, before hovering over Tony, and watching as he spread his legs, allowing the man to insert a lubed finger.
“Praise the universe!” Tony called out, and everyone laughed. “Alright, now who wants some ham, and who wants turkey?”
Steve kept a cool expression. "I don't think that subject is really one for such an open area, do you?" The soldier saw right through her little trick. Christine's lips set into a pout as she leaned back in her chair. "Well then, why don't we talk about what we're both doing here." she said, trying to regain control of the situation. "We're here because you called me and told me you would like to speak to me over a cup of coffee. When I politely declined, you told me that if I didn't you would tell the whole country about the kiss you witnessed between Tony and myself." He leaned over the table glaring at her. "Which, may I just point out, you have no proof of."
Steve’s lips twitched; and he looked down at his hands. “I hate this.” He muttered to himself. “What?” Tony asked, focusing his attention on Steve. “This. I finally find the love of my life, and I don’t even get to hold his damn hand.” Tony pursed his lips, and placed his hand beneath the table, placing it on Steve's knee. The blond smiled, and placed one of his hands beneath the table as well.
“Mm, smells just like mom’s.” Steve announced, walking into the dining room with a grin on his face. Tony sat at the head of the table, Pepper on his left, then Natasha, then Clint. Jane sat across from him, and Thor of course sat next to her. Bruce was seated next to the large God, and an empty seat by Tony was obviously Steve’s. He smiled, and headed to his seat. “I hope you’re hungry, I made a lot of food for all of us.” Pepper told him, looking in Thor’s direction.
"Just relax." Steve smirked, effortlessly turning the brunet over, and digging around for the lube in the bedside drawer. Tony waited with anticipation, staring out of the corner of his eye as he watched the other man finally find the lube and pour some into his hands, warming it up before he pressed his fingers into Tony. The man groaned into his pillow, biting down on it as Steve's fingers moved inside of him, moving effortlessly.
"Great job, let's take out the rest of these bastards and we can go home!" Steve ordered, and everyone quickly agreed. Steve deflected the onslaught of bullets, and Tony appeared beside him. "Come to join the party Stark?" The blond wondered as he aimed the shield at a larger enemy. "What can I say? I love a good party." Tony retorted as he fired at a few oncoming men. They fought side by side, putting aside their feelings and their feud, for the sake of saving the lives of millions.
to a moderate volume, but still loud enough to pass to the next room. It was a wonder that he never got complaints from the other neighbors.
They reached Stark towers, and Steve understood why. Tony placed him down, and the blond watched Tony strip himself of his suit, exposing his fit body to the cold. Steve got up slowly, and the brunette moved to steady him. They moved themselves to the bedroom, kissing passionately along the way, not wanting to waste another minute that they wouldn't be in each other's arms. When they reached the bedroom door, Steve kicked it in. Tony looked surprised, and the soldier smiled.
Tony thought to himself as he watched the room spin before him, just barely able to keep his focus on the soldier in front of him.
"Man Bruce, those gamma rays give you mind reading powers too?" Clint laughed, but the scientist shook his head. "Check it out." The four looked to where he was pointing, and noticed a large helicopter coming down in the middle of the park. "Of course, Fury just has to make an entrance." Natasha muttered, smiling to herself.
"Hello. If you're watching this, that means my suicide was a success, and I'm dead. I think that I'm supposed to leave a list of reasons, why I chose to do it, isn't that what people do? I'm not sure, I've never done this before. But I've thought about it. You all never seemed to pick up on the fact that I was depressed, or maybe you chose to ignore it. Either way, it won't matter in a few minutes. In a few minutes, I'll shut off the camera, and take the coward's way out. It's like you said Steve, I should stop acting like a hero." Tony lifted the gun, showing it to the camera. "I hope you have a good life with Ashley. She's a beautiful girl. Really. And Clint, sorry I won't be able to attend your wedding. I'm sure Natasha will look beautiful in something besides her usual black and white get up. Bruce, keep working on our projects when I'm gone okay? And Thor, I hope you enjoy all the pop tarts and drinks you can get. Take a little extra for me would you?" he sighed. "And Pepper, I love you. I do. But before I go, I thought you should know, I loved someone else too. I won't say who it is. He should know." Tony put the gun to his head, and smiled one last time. "Goodbye."
"What's up with you today? Why did you take off like that?" Tony didn't answer; he just ran a hand over his face, trying to keep calm. "Sorry Bruce. I didn't mean to freak out like that." he sighed, and hopped into the back seat. "Can you drive? I'm not exactly at my most stable point right now."
He entered his room, grabbing a glass and his favorite bottle of scotch, pouring himself a glass and settling into the couch, flipping through channels, not paying attention to really what was on the screen. He tried to keep his mind off Steve, but he found it difficult. He wondered why he was so upset, and why he had snapped at Tony like that. He pushed it to the back of his mind, drowning his feelings with the scotch.
So really, they were just waiting on Stark. They hadn't talked since yesterday, but already it seemed like years since they had been apart. Steve slept in an empty bed alone, darkness looming that Tony used to keep away. He pushed the thought out of his mind, rubbing his eyes. He was exhausted; maybe a quick nap would do him some good. Besides, knowing Tony, he'll be fashionably late.
“Drunk Atheist.” Steve replied, not hiding his dislike for the other man. Tony moved up to the blond's back, ready to turn him around and punch him. But just as he placed a hand on Steve's shoulder, someone came into the hotel room; interrupting the would-be fight.
"Well, actually I wanted to know if you would allow me to have this dance." Steve muttered, blushing. Tony was caught off guard. "W-What?"
"Stark! Keep it down would you? I'm trying to read!" Steve Rogers yelled as he sat in his large hotel room, seated in a large arm chair. Tony had the unfortunate pleasure of being his next door neighbor. And that man loved his AC/DC. The music stayed at the same level, and Steve grunted in frustration.
"Drinking isn't going to make it go away." Natasha said as she slid into the seat beside Tony. He simply stared ahead at all the bottles, wanting to ignore her presence. "Ignore me all you want. It's the truth. You're going to have to deal with the fact of Steve liking someone else." The woman sighed, sipping on her martini. Tony swallowed hard, trying to lose himself in the music, which didn't exactly make things better.
The soldier frowned as he realized it was Christine texting him. Hey babe, want to get together later? Maybe catch a movie? -CE. He rolled his eyes, but texted her back anyways. Sure, sounds good. I'll pick you up at seven. -SR. He sighed, and headed into the showers, stripping and leaving his phone with his clothes. "Hello Captain." A voice said, and Steve turned around, thankful for the small half wall that covered everything below his waist.
“Alright, last one’s for you Cap.” Tony teased, giving Steve a playful wink. Steve rolled his eyes and smiled.  He picked up his gift, a small gift wrapped box. Everyone watched in silence, curious as to what it could be. Steve held his breath, and swallowed hard. A small compass, one he knew by heart, sat in the green tissue paper. He lifted it out slowly and carefully, feeling tears come to his eyes. He pressed on the little clasp, and there she was.
A few had gathered in Clint’s penthouse, which over looked the whole city. He and Tony had fought immensely over it, before they decided on a drinking game to settle their problems. It surprised everyone that the older man had lost, but everyone suspected that the usual drinker had thrown the game. Natasha joined Clint and Steve on the balcony, dressed in a flowing black nightgown. Her red hair suddenly shone in the sunlight, and the male assassin raised his hand in mock surprise. Natasha smirked at him, and kissed him good morning.
"Steve," Tony gasped, clawing at his back. Steve licked the brunette's neck, causing him to arch beneath him. "Damn it Steve, stop!" His breathing was becoming ragged, and he felt his prick begging to be let loose. The blond nipped at his shoulder, and Tony moaned, wanting Steve to just
And they just kept walking, the November winds nipping at their faces, numbing their noses. Tony spotted a Starbucks, and tapped Steve's arm. The other man nodded, wanting some coffee to help warm his numbs hands. They entered, and Ed Sheeran's
"Oh?" The blond shuddered under the man's touch, responding with light kisses against the brunet's neck.
Toni glared down at her watch, beginning to grow impatient. She was one to show up late, as she had done, but this was just ridiculous. The waiter came over and poured her another glass of water- her fourth that night. She thanked him with a smile, beginning to turn the ice with her straw as she continued to look over her menu.
"Tony!" he cried, watching the sky as he fell backwards towards the snow covered ground. Tony ran towards the edge, and slipped, just as he had in his nightmare. "No!" he cried, he watched Steve come closer to the ground, and boosted himself off the roof, diving after his falling lover. They were coming precariously close, and Tony stepped up the boosters. Steve reached for the man's hand, and Tony reached for his. Just a few feet away from the ground....
"Natasha, there is nothing going on between us. I promise you that." Tony crossed his arms, and began to walk back into the hotel room. "But you want there to be don't you?" The woman muttered, and felt smirked as the man stopped dead in his tracks, and his whole body tensed. The brunette thought of all the nights that he dreamt of Steve, about how his bed was so cold without someone beside him, and how he only wanted Steve to see how he felt. How he
appreciates my decorating.” Pepper teased as she greeted the blond. “I never said I didn’t appreciate it!” Tony laughed, pulling her into a kiss. Steve fought back the jealous feeling rising in him.
Steve sighed, looking over once more at the gift. "Tony, you really shouldn't have." He ran a hand through his hair, just in complete shock that Tony would do this for him. The man waved his hand dismissively. "Consider it a really late birthday present."
Steve looked up, a confused look on his handsome face. "Sure, what's wrong babe?" he asked as he wiped his hands on his jeans, moving to where his husband sat at the table. "Sit." Tony muttered, not meeting Steve's eyes.
“Not fair Tony,” Steve teased, nuzzling his face in Tony’s blazer. “You know you love it.” Tony teased back, breathing in Steve’s sweet, masculine scent. “Want to go inside yet?” asked Steve, hoping the answer would be a no. “One more minute. I like this.” Tony whispered. It was nice, the fact that they could simply stand there and just enjoy each other’s presence. Tony didn’t feel judged, or like Steve wanted anything from him. All he wanted was for Tony to be with him, just to be there.
He sighed, and looked up at him, "I'm not going to lie to you Tony, Pepper told me to come, said she went to a lot of trouble, but that's not really why I'm here." Steve ran a hand through his hair. "I missed you Tony, and I hate not talking to you." he said, smiling at Tony. The other man smiled back. "Well, now we're friends again. So, here's to us." He raised his glass, and Steve raised his glass of water. "Cheers." They muttered, and took a drink.
"Hey Tony, toss me a can of soda would you?" Steve asked as he nudged his head towards the cooler."What'd you call it?" Tony chuckled as he lifted himself off the lawn chair to fill the request. "Soda?" Steve repeated, holding out an expecting hand. "We call it pop now a-days Cap." Tony corrected as he reached into the cooler, the ice sending a chill over his hot skin. "Since when?" Steve asked as Tony handed him the can. He pressed it to his neck, cooling himself off.
Hi guys! So, I'm still new to this thing and I have no idea what this is gonna do to the chapter but whatever. I hope you're all enjoying the story so far, again no idea how many of you are reading this but I already got 4 kudos... yay me. Alright, anyways, I already have the whole story completed on another site, but because I'm a jerkbutt I'm going to take my sweet time uploading on here. But really, I will try to update. Anyways, that's enough from me, I hope you all stick around!
He arrived at the floor, and headed to Steve's door. Tony knocked, and the door opened by itself. Confused, he stepped in. "Steve?" Tony called out into the empty room. It looked like the place hadn't been touched, everything neatly put in its place. "JARVIS, where's Cap?" he asked, looking in the bedroom and finding the bed neatly made. "He said he was going out for a walk, although in this weather I can't imagine where he would be going." The AI responded. Tony bit his lip. "I'm going to find him." he said, running back up to his room to grab his things and headed out after the blond.
“Well, what are we all waiting for?” Tony asked, about to dive his fork into the ham. “Wait! We need to say grace!” Pepper swatted Tony’s hand away, and the man groaned. “Really Pepper?” She shot him a look that needed no explanation. Everyone joined hands, and Pepper allowed Steve to do the honors. “Dear Lord, we thank you for these gifts were are about to receive. We thank you for our family and friends, and those we hold close to our hearts.” Steve gave a quick squeeze to Tony’s hand. “Thank you for allowing us to spend another day on this Earth, and allow us to spend a few more.”
"Why are these still on?" Tony slurred, sloppily kissing the blond as he moved to take off the clothing.
“You two go have fun, I’m going to try and talk to someone.” Bruce said, putting his drink down, and looking at the crowd. “Good luck buddy. See you back at the hotel.” Tony and Steve headed off in the opposite direction, Steve a few steps behind. They didn’t want to draw any unwanted attention. “Slow down a little would you?” Steve said through clenched teeth. He had finally caught up with each other at a secluded table, one that was out of sight. “Slow down? I thought I wasn’t going fast enough!” Tony replied, examining his drink. “You forget how long your legs are Cap.”
"Well, I should be going." Steve was about to turn away, but Ashley caught his arm. Before the man could protest, he felt her lips meet his, and she wrapped her arms around his neck. He let her do the work, as he had only kissed two women in his whole life, and only one had given him a real rush. But he didn't want to feel that again, not with Ashley.
He watched from the corner of his eye as Tony sat farther down at the table, next to Clint. They muttered something quickly to each other, before Fury cleared his throat and everyone turned their attention to him. "Thank you all for coming in today, I know I've been keeping you waiting, but we finally have the information we need." Fury leaned on the table, looking over the men.
Tony came back up, wrapping his arms around Steve's neck, grinding deeper into his crotch, and again, the blond had to think consciously to not just let himself melt into a puddle right then and there, but holy
Steve pulled away, and looked at his lover. “What do you mean?” The blond asked, studying his face. “You know exactly what I mean. I can’t keep lying to Pepper. She… She deserves better than this.” Tony held his head in his hands, and sat back on the couch. Steve wrapped an arm around him, and Tony sighed heavily. “I love you Steve, I really do, but-“ “But you loved her first.” the soldier finished, feeling a sick feeling rise in his stomach. “I just don’t know what to do- I keep having nightmares, I feel so guilty.” Tony's voice broke, and a single tear tried to escape.
"Holy..." Tony gasped as he walked into the room, covered in white. The table clothes, the decorations, the people, it all looked as if they had entered some sort of wonderland. "Damn...They really went all out with it this year." Steve whispered, taking in the scenery. Natasha giggled; she was used to the entire decor, since she had been a member of S.H.I.E.L.D for so long. A slow song floated around in the background, tempting Steve to grab Tony's hand and bring him onto the dance floor. "I better go find Clint; he always loves to have a little too much fun at these parties. She gave the lovers a small wave, and headed into the crowd.
Steve looked around once more for Ashley, but he didn't see her. He sighed heavily, and began to walk out of the bar with Tony pounding his fists into the man's back, trying to get the man to put him down. But his efforts were in vain. So, he decided to get a little revenge. Just as they were walking out, he grabbed a handful of Steve's ass, causing the man to yelp, and jolt his shoulder upwards, right into Tony's crotch. The man groaned in pain, hiding his face in the blond's back, and listening to the soft chuckle that erupted within him.
Steve walked over to the table, bottle in hand. "Figured it was a bit too bright in here." He smiled, and the light from the streets below gave his smile a white glow. Tony's stomach tightened, and he got up to grab the two wine glasses. "Here, let me dump these out." He picked up the glasses, his hand brushing against Steve's.
"And you think this was mine? I'm not exactly crazy about the whole idea of going on a date with a complete stranger either, but hey, we're both here aren't we? So, why don't we both just sit down, have a drink or two, and enjoy ourselves. I mean, no reason for you to waste such a beautiful dress." Stephanie stepped forward, and Toni turned around, glaring playfully.
"Come now American man; let us enjoy this fabulous dessert made in your honor." Thor announced, patting Steve gently on the back. "Yeah, sounds good!" The soldier smiled as he picked up a knife, but Tony stopped him. "Allow me." Tony's arm, which had recently been hidden behind his back, now showed, and his arm was encased in his Iron Man repulsor. "I've been working on a little something." He smirked as he walked over to the table, and aimed at the cake. "No Tony that's still a-" Bruce tried to yell over the whir of the machine, but it was too late.
Steve opened his eyes and came back to reality. He pushed himself off of Tony, leaving the man breathless and confused. Their heavy breathing was apparent in the icy air, but their bodies still remained burning. Steve backed away, in shock, coming into realization of what had just conspired. Tony's head spun and he propped himself up against the door, keeping his eyes locked on the man before him. His eyes suddenly fell to the soldier's position, and he found himself screaming out. The blond kept backing away, hearing a distant voice- Tony's voice- but he couldn't make out what he was saying. Before he knew what was happening, he felt the ground disappear from beneath him, and he fell off the roof top, one hundred stories up.
"I want you." The smaller man begged, and a small voice in the back of his head screamed at him for being so easy. That was quickly drowned out by Steve's response, "My place or yours?"
Tony moved in front of the emblem, blocking the man's view, the arc reactor glowing. Bruce backed up, a shocked look on his face. "What's wrong Stark? Something you don't want me to see?" Bruce snickered, and Tony rolled his eyes. "Come on Bruce, I got our project over here." He pushed the other man slightly, and the two headed over to a small compact item.
“Well, if everyone has had their fill, I think now would be a wonderful time to go into the living room and open gifts.” Jane suggested, eyeing Thor, who looked more pleased than ever. Everyone nodded in agreement, and moved themselves into the living room. “Who wants to go first?” Steve asked, kneeling down by the presents. “How about we do it by age? That’s how we always used to do it my house.” “That sounds fine to me. Looks like the big guy will be going last, you think you can wait that long?” Tony laughed, punching Thor playfully in the arm. “Let’s see if you
"I'll explain everything in a second, but for now, I need to get something to eat." Fury answered, and he walked towards a hot dog vendor, leaving the five with confused looks on all their faces. One by one, they sighed and followed after him, Tony and Steve being the last two to walk away from the large helicopter. The brunette couldn't help but notice how fine Steve's butt looked in the jeans he was wearing.
The blast flew them forward, and they were caught by the Hulk. "Thanks buddy." Tony said as they were dropped. "Are you insane? You directly violated my orders!" Steve yelled, standing and brushing himself off. "Excuse me? If I had listened to you, you'd be dead right now!" Tony remarked, glaring at the blond. "I would have been fine, and you wouldn't have put yourself in danger! We don't need two dead heroes!" The soldier retorted. "Why can't you just be grateful? You know this is the second time I've saved your ass!" The brunette snarled, taking a step towards him. "And I recall you being more than grateful the first time."
Steve sighed and looked up at the sky, trying to think of what to say. So many things were going through his mind at that time, and he was just was too jumbled to put them all into words. "I- I can't tell you exactly." He finally managed to say, once again hunching over and wiping away his tears.
Steve turned around to find a scowling Tony behind him, taking the plates from his hands, and murmuring something under his breath that the soldier couldn't quite catch. Regardless, Steve carried over the glasses and moved to where the other man was standing at the sink. Tony smiled, and began to do the dishes. Steve helped, and the two laughed at the unsaid joke.
"Well, I mean, it was a pretty nice hook up Capsicle." The smaller man said, moving his hands up to hold the blond's face in his hands.
"Hey, we still have to go out and find you a woman tonight don't we?" Tony smiled, only to cover up the fact that he knew the night would have to have ended soon enough. A smile fell away from Steve's face as he realized what Tony was hinting at. "Oh, right. Well, are you still feeling up for it? I don't want to keep you up late." Steve mumbled, gulping down the last few drops of his drink.
Steve took the condom, stretching it over his engorged erection, and with some help from Tony, pressing himself into the other. The brunet groaned with passion, and allowed himself to be returned to all fours, allowing Steve to get a better angle, and to better bury himself into the other man, wanting to just fuck him.
Steve sighed, and looked over to see Tony opening the schnapps, struggling to get the corkscrew out. The soldier chuckled and sat himself down, picking at his potatoes. Tony finally dislodged the cork, and poured the schnapps into two smaller glasses.
Tony sat next to him, and put his arm around the blond. The brunette looked up at the city sky, the stars being outshone by the lights below them. Steve picked his head up and tried to blink back his tears, not wanting the other to see him cry, but wanting to know what his intentions were. Tony looked over to him and smiled, seeing right through the man's serious mask. "You can't fool me Steve. I know you're upset, and I know you want to talk about it." He wiped away a tear that rolled down the blond’s cheek, causing him to flinch at the cold touch of the metal.
Steve looked up to Ashley, who began to eat the plate of chicken before her. He removed his hand, and tried to find his appetite. He knew he wouldn’t though.
"Hey Tony." Tony's head shot up from behind the machine, eyes glaring at the tall blond. Steve stood in his old army suit, his hair combed perfectly. "Where are you going?" The dark haired man growled, getting up to refill his glass. He tried to act uninterested, but he really was curious; and actually a bit jealous. Steve picked up on Tony's cold attitude, and bit his lip nervously. "Um, me and Ashley are going out for some dinner thing- are you okay?" The blond tilted his head, following the man with his eyes. Tony slammed the bottle down on the counter, refusing to face him. "Me? I'm great."
"How could you do this?" Pepper asked, venom in her broken voice. "I gave you everything you asked for, I was there for you, and you cheat on me?" Tony put his face in his hands, sitting down on the couch. "I know, I made a mistake, I should have told you, I should have broken up with you, but... I don't know why I didn't." he muttered. "Please, you have to tell me why." She didn't care that it was Steve; actually, she was a bit relieved that it had been Steve, better him than someone else. "I don't know Pepper, it's just, ever since New York, Steve and I have gotten close," The strawberry blond snorted. "I can see that." she muttered beneath her breath.
Tony clicked the cylinder of the revolver into place, smiling at it. Sweet release. Soon, it'd be over. He wouldn't have to worry about his God Damn father, or how he was never good enough, or the painful memory of losing the only person he cared about. "I'm sorry mom." he whispered. He grabbed the camera remote, and pressed record.
Everyone smiled at each other, knowing exactly how much Bruce and Thor had connected. Tony walked out from the bathroom, adjusting his belt buckle. "What's going on?" he asked, looking around at everyone's amused faces. "Thor's coming to town." explained Clint, getting up from his bar stool to grab himself  a refill on his drink. Tony groaned, obviously not excited for "Blondie's" arrival.
Tony walked into his large and comfortable room, with it's large circular couch in front of a fire place with a plasma screen hanging over it. He walked over to the surround sound stereo and paused. A smile crossed his face as he looked out at the view of the ocean, it was a truly gorgeous sight, he wished he could share it with someone. He turned down the stereo, which currently played
"Stark! Slow the hell down! You're going to kill us!" Bruce braced himself, fear rising, and the Hulk beginning to rear his ugly head. Tony slammed down on the brakes. The car screeched to a halt, and Bruce could see heads turning to see the almost accident. The scientist ran a hand through his hair, taking deep breaths as he calmed down before turning to his friend.
"Alright Stark, last one, then we gotta head out." Steve said as he observed the nearly empty bar. Only Tony and him remained, besides a bar tender and a bus boy. The two sat across from each other, their eyes bloodshot from all the drinking. They each had one last shot, but neither thought Tony could handle it. "Alright. You ready Steve?" The man slurred as he lifted the shot with a shaky hand.
She peered at him, noticing how red his face was. "Everything okay there Steve?" Steve looked up quickly, his expression returning to its serious state. "Y-yeah. Everything's fine. You two want some coffee?" The soldier asked. He looked serious, but his voice gave away his nervousness.
“Tony asked for me to give you these,” Pepper said quietly, handing Steve two discs, one marked “Steve” and the other “Peter”. Steve nodded, and thanked the woman. The last remaining guests said their goodbyes, gave their condolences, and shuffled out of the house. Steve handed Peter his disc once the last guest had left.
Hulk finally appeared from the lab, signaling that it was time to go. "Barton clear out!" Steve ordered, looking for the nearest exit. "Don't have to tell me twice. Meet you on the other side guys!" He dove over the wall, getting as much space between him and the building as possible. "Hulk, you too, let's go Tony!" The solider directed them to an exit, but just as they were about to be home free, a snare found Steve's leg, pulling him back into the compound. Tony noticed the Captain's disappearance, and saw him being dragged back.
Steve looked at Tony's lips, and felt a heat rising through his chilled body. Tony shifted his weight, and pulled away. "Tony?" The blond looked at him, and watched as he began to walk away. "Come on, it's getting late, and we ought to get home." Tony muttered, and shoved his hands in his pant pockets, not bothering to remove Steve's jacket.
"Bartender! Another round please!" Tony called across the room, his words slurring. Clint, Bruce, Tony, and Steve had gathered at their regular bar, The Silver Celtics. The bar played good music, and wasn't filled with loud and rowdy teens. It was a good place for drinking games, such as tonight.
“Tony? Steve?” Natasha called out into the empty hall, looking for the two lovers. She adjusted her blue dress, the tight fabric constricting her. “Where the hell are you two? Everyone is waiting!” she called out, louder this time. “We’re coming, we’re coming.” Tony muttered, a fussy Steve following behind him. “Steve, stop touching my damn hair.” he growled, causing the blond to smile. “You want to look good don’t you?” He tried to fix a strand that hung in the man’s beautiful face, but Tony swatted him away.
"Wow Stark, you really went all out!" Steve smiled as he looked at the wide array of food on the large dining room table. "You make this yourself?" he joked. Tony smiled, and rubbed the back of his neck. "I'm an engineer, not a chef." he muttered uncomfortably. "Come on. Enough chit chat, I don't want this food to go to waste!" The pair sat down on opposite ends of the table, and toasted to their glasses of red wine.
Immediately, Steve stood, and turned the man around, giving him a swift punch to the jaw, and sending him into one of the tables. The man's friend tried to jump the soldier, but Dianne quickly stepped in and clocked him. "Both of you out now!" she yelled, pulling the drunken man off the floor and giving him and his friend a shove towards the door. Steve ran to Tony's side, looking him over, patting the side of his face as he tried to wake his friend. "Tony! You alright?" He asked, trying to get the brunette to open his eyes. "I'm fine damn it." Tony growled, rubbing the back of his head.
"Guys, Thor's here!" Bruce yelled as he ran into the pent house. None of them locked their doors, seeing it as useless. They all were always going from room to room, enjoying each other’s company. Everyone stopped what they were doing to look up at the excited Bruce. "Are you serious?" Clint asked. "Yeah! I saw the storm heading in on the sensor! He's really coming guys! We gotta celebrate!" the scientist exclaimed.
"That your boyfriend over there?" Dianne, the owner of the bar asked. She was an Irish woman, and she nodded towards Steve as she poured the fifth round of drinks for Tony. The brunette opened his mouth to correct her, but then quickly shut it. "I saw you two over there, he's a good one." She said, smiling. "He makes you smile, I've only seen you a few times, but I can tell that when you laugh, it's real." Tony looked down at the counter and smiled. "Have fun tonight you two." She gave the man a wink as she handed him his drinks. "Thanks, we will." A fight broke out in the corner of the bar, and all eyes turned to see who it was between.
Natasha gave him a quick slap across the face as Steve and Bruce got on the elevator. "Listen to me! You need to relax!" she said, voice demanding as Tony shut up. "Steve isn't alright today; today is Bucky's death day, and he's upset about it! That's why he didn't want to talk about it, and that's why he's been acting the way he has!" she explained, and Tony sank to his knees as her words set in.
"You're too secretive." Tony complained. Steve focused his full attention on the brunette, his eyes narrowing. "Says the guy who sits in his lab all day!" he remarked, giving Tony a playful smile. Tony smiled back, and the knot was back. He tried to push it away, but it was too strong.
Tony felt his head jolt forward from the force of being pushed against a wall. "What the hell are you doing Stark? You can't be seriously doing this!" Natasha's voice was a harsh whisper, and her face was twisted with anger. "What the hell are you talking about? Doing what?" Tony asked, rubbing the back of his head. "Dammit Romanoff, I think you bruised me."
"We should get over this; I'm fine with being friends if you are." Tony said, smiling. "I am, so," Steve held out his hand, smiling. "Friends?" The brunette chuckled, and shook his hand. "Friends." They waited a moment longer, still holding each other’s hand. Steve loosened his grip, slightly. He was reluctant to let go, but he knew if he didn't he would be all over Tony within another heartbeat.
"Aren't you cold?" Tony's soft voice broke Steve's thoughts, and he looked up from where he sat on the bench to meet his dark eyes. "Not really." he lied. He was, he was only wearing a sweater and some jeans with boots. "Don't lie to your soldiers Captain, you should know better." Tony teased, sitting next to him as he brushed snowflakes out of his own hair. Steve's lips twitched at a smile, and he looked out over the park.
"Oh what now you're telling me how I feel too? God Stark, you just got to control everything in our lives don't you?" Steve snarled, getting pissed. "Do you ever think about what anybody else wants?" "I'm sorry, were you not listening to me? I already told you, I thought of you when I went scrounging through that scrap heap to find you that damn photograph!" Tony yelled, anger swelling inside of him. "I do nothing but think of you! You changed me Steve, for the better!"
Any way that he could piss off Steve, he would do it. But he decided to let Capsicle have this one. Tony walked over to the large red couch, and lay back, thinking about the past few months.
Tony crashed into Steve and the large man went flying into the far wall. The blond tried to catch his breath, and Tony shot a blast in his direction. Steve missed it just in time, and ran for his shield, old war memories trudging their way up into his brain. He smiled, and grabbed his shield just in time to block another blast from the other man, which ricocheted off the shield, and back at the assailant. The small man flew back a few feet, the suit taking some damage. Tony tried to catch his balance, but Steve took the opportunity to make an offensive move.
Steve turned to Tony, the smug bastard giving him a smirk. "You know, you really shouldn't drink as much as you do. It's not good for your health." The soldier grumbled as he turned away and began to clean up the mess. Tony snorted. "It's my life, and I honestly don't think you can run around trying to tell me what to do." he growled, but screwed the cap back on the bottle. "I always thought you wanted to be different from your father?" Steve snapped, not turning around. Tony blinked, and his mouth hung open. He didn't know what to say, he was too stunned to really say anything... He didn't know Steve was capable of saying something as cruel as that.
"Shut up and buckle up." Steve ordered, cutting Christine off. She scoffed, but still did as she was told. "Where the hell do you-" She began again, but the soldier glared at her, nostrils flaring, and eyes dead set. "How long do you plan on keeping me your little prisoner Christine?" he growled, and began to drive. "I'm not sure, why? You thinking of just giving up and letting me expose you and Tony?" She threatened, smiling deviously. Steve laughed, which caused the woman's smile to fade. "What are you laughing at?"
Steve sighed as he poured himself a cup of coffee. He wasn't planning on sleeping tonight anyways. His mind has been restless lately, thinking of all the things he's missed, being frozen for seventy years. He laughed at a joke he had heard,
Steve quickly spun Tony out, expecting to catch him off guard. He should have known better. Tony planted his feet firmly and pulled Steve towards him instead. Steve gasped and prepared to hit the floor, not expecting Tony to catch him. He pulled the super soldier back up, not missing a step. His eyes flashed with a playful look.
“Hello American man! It is nice to see you could join us.” Thor laughed, wrapping the soldier in a hug. Clint and Natasha quickly stole the presents from Steve’s arms, before he could crush them. “Thor! What are you doing back so soon?” Steve asked, struggling to breathe.  “My father let me back for a day. I’m not staying, but he said the King of Asgard should spend his days as he pleases.” Thor grinned as he placed his friend back on solid ground.
"Alright, my turn." Tony whispered, switching positions so he now had control over Steve. He looked partly shocked, but allowed it to happen. Tony pushed Steve back a bit, giving him some space so that he could spin into Steve's arms. Steve gracefully caught him, and lifted him back up. They danced close once again, and their legs brushing together slightly aroused them both.
Steve looked back at Tony, who was just standing there, a triumphant look on his smug little face. The soldier wanted nothing more than to just punch him. "Come on Tony, time to get you out of here before you ruin anybody else’s good time." Steve growled, slightly tugging on the man's arm. Tony yanked his arm away, stumbling backwards. "Don't put your hands on my like I'm your property! I'm not your bitch." The man glared at Steve with hazy eyes, and he found it difficult to stay standing for too long.
"No, you can't go out there alone." Tony said, his voice serious. He tried desperately to hide the absolute fear that lived within him that Steve could get hurt, but his hand was shaking. Steve looked back at him, placing his hand on Tony's "I'll be fine Stark," Steve replied, his face blank. Tony let his hand linger a moment longer, until he released the super soldier out onto the field. Steve's shield reflected bullets aimed at his upper body, but still some manage to attack his legs and rip apart his suit, causing him some minor pain. Tony tried to cover him as best as he can.
"Oh, I love this song! You want to dance?" Ashley said as she swayed slowly to the music. Best of My Love by the Eagles played over the speakers, and Steve nodded curtly. They made their way to the dance floor, and the soldier tried his best to dance just as Tony had showed him.
"I used to make weapons, but now, I'm sort of retired. I have enough money saved up in my bank to keep me living fancy for two lifetimes." Toni leaned on the table, tapping a manicured finger on the table as she dragged it over the table cloth. "What about you?"
"Well, I'm ready when you are." the blond said as he patted down his suit, finally daring to look at Tony.
"I should repay you." Christine muttered, opening the door. She smirked as Steve stood before her, half dressed. "Really Christine, that's not-" his sentence was cut short by her lips. She kissed him softly at first, trying get him to respond. He tried his best to resist, but soon enough he found himself kissing back, wrapping his arms around her waist. She smiled against the kiss, running her hands up Steve's chest, and putting a hand on his neck.
“Good morning ladies!” Bruce said as he entered the penthouse, a wide smile on his face, his clothes hanging loosely on his skinny frame. “You’re in a good mood, you get laid last night?” Tony joked. “Better. I just got invited to attend one of the most prestigious science conventions in New York City!" The scientist cheered, his smile growing wider with each word. "How is that better than getting laid?" The brunette asked, seemingly uninterested. "Shut up Tony." snapped Steve. He looked at Bruce and matched his enthusiasm. "That's great Bruce! I'm really happy for you! When is it?" He patted the man on the back, who stumbled from the sudden force of Steve's hand. He straightened himself quickly, trying to cover up his meek stature.
"We keep Tony around though!" The darker haired man pointed out, causing Steve to almost choke on his food. "I said snarky not Starky." "What's the difference?" Bruce asked, and both men let out a loud laugh. "I can hear you two you know!" Tony growled as he joined them in the kitchen. "Oh come on, you know we love you!" The darker haired man laughed, and Steve froze up. Tony laughed as well, and the blond sighed as he went back to eating. Well, good to know he's really over me.
Tony froze, closing his eyes to hold back the tears that threatened to spill. "I wish I knew." He whispered, and ran a hand over his face; he felt so tired... "I'm going to go take a nap." The brunette muttered, heading out, and almost running into someone. He looked up, glaring, ready to yell at the person, when his eyes met a pair of blue ones. "Steve!" Tony choked out. Oh god what did he hear?
“Merry Christmas Cap!” Tony said as he welcomed the super soldier into his home. The Malibu house had been decorated in the most beautiful way. “Pepper?” Steve asked as he waltzed in, gifts in hand. “Who else?” Tony chuckled, and patted his lover on the back. It was the best they could do considering all the guests. “Well, she did a lovely job.” Steve muttered as they walked into the living room. “Why thank you Steve. It’s nice to know
Tony stayed locked away in his lab for most of the day, until JARVIS notified him that dinner was ready. His stomach growled, and he decided to grab something and just bring it back downstairs. He stopped in the doorway of the kitchen, locking eyes with Steve. The blond kept a cool expression. "Mr. Stark," he snarled, before turning away and finishing setting up his plate. "Captain." Tony said, matching the man's tone, and retrieving a plate for his own food. Steve quickly finished putting his food on his plate before going back into his room. He couldn't be around Tony right then, it hurt him far too much.
Steve couldn't speak, he only sobbed, and Tony held him close; the others could only stand in silence as they watched the strong man break down into tears. Clint joined them on the bed, and so did Bruce. They all sat in silence except for Steve, who was still shaking. It was all just a horrible memory.
Tony smiled as he lit the candle for Steve's cake, and held his hand in front of the flame as he began to slowly walk towards the bedroom. He opened the door quietly, not wanting to wake the still sleeping soldier. He shuffled over to the bed, holding the small cake in one hand as he climbed onto the bed, settling in beside his lover and kissing his neck tenderly. "Happy birthday babe," he whispered as he saw Steve stir, and finally wake.
"So what, we have one little fight and suddenly that's it? You want out?" he laughed haughtily. "That's so like you to just brush your problems off like that!" he yelled. "I have done nothing but dealt with my problems, don't you dare try to tell me I haven't!" Steve yelled back, towering over Tony. "I never wanted you to be a problem, but you seem to be making yourself one."
"It's over between us, there's nothing for you to write your little story on, now leave me and Steve alone." Tony answered, wiping away his tears. "Oh, but that doesn't mean the thing you speak of never happened. I wonder what everyone would think when they found out that Anthony Stark had a passionate love affair with Steve Rogers?" Her voice went from light to threatening, and Tony tried to keep himself under control.
And the silence continued. Neither was sure of how long, but it didn't matter. They didn't need to talk; it was perfect without words. "You ready to head out?" Steve looked up and saw Tony moving towards the garbage, and he followed after. He hadn't drunk much of his coffee. He didn't like Starbucks much, but he came for Tony's sake.
The music resonated through the bodies of the dancers, hot, sweaty bodies coming together and pulling apart as they moved along to the music, creating beautiful images to those who stood aside and watched. And if Steve had his sketchbook, and if it was even remotely acceptable, he would sketch these people, as crude as their moves may have seemed, it simply blew his mind that some people could be so in sync, that they could just read one another's body language enough to move as they did...
"Alright." he muttered. Tony smiled softly. "Great, we'll meet at Stark Towers to help you get ready." Tony said as he moved out of the way of the blond's bike. But Steve wasn't listening; he was gone before Tony could even finish his sentence; before he could say one more thing that could hurt him.
"Investigating is a better word for it." Christine said confidently. "You can keep those, I've got plenty." Steve placed the photos back in the folder. "What do you want Christine?" he muttered. "Hm..." she tapped her finger to her chin. "I want you Captain."
Tony laughed out of his own embarrassment, rubbing his eyes. "You didn't try to stop me did you Cap?" Steve looked out across the room, and smiled. "Hey, I figured it'd teach you a lesson. You should know never to get into a drinking competition with a super soldier." The brunette stretched, careful not to spill any more of his coffee. "I need to get working on my projects. Pepper needs them by the end of this week." He got up, but the sudden movement mixed with a hangover caused him to fall back down.
Bruce looked at him a bit stunned. "What exactly happened?" he asked, looking up at the blond with concern. "Let's just say I got to know Tony a little better, and I now know there's a reason we don't get along. Have a good night Bruce." Steve smiled politely, forcing it, and Bruce could tell. But he let it go. "Night Steve," he muttered, and watched the man go to the elevators, no doubt on his way to his room for another sleepless night.
"Why aren't you out there mingling?" Steve asked, knowing it was a stupid question. Everyone knew how Bruce was, how he never really liked talking to anyone. The man shrugged. "No one to really talk to but you guys, and you all seemed to be enjoying yourselves." Steve gave him a sympathetic look, but quickly corrected it. "Don't be that way Bruce, we all really like you." he told him, patting him softly on the back. Bruce grinned, and sipped at his drink. For some reason, Bruce always had the feeling that Cap hated him, he just kept it hidden.
Tony snorted. "Come on up and get me bird man!" he taunted, and proceeded to make chicken noises, while still perched on the edge of the building. He looked down, and his cool composure faded. He gulped, but still remained where he was. "I'll get him down." Clint growled, and went inside to retrieve his arrows. "Tony will you come down before Barton shoots you?" Steve called once more, worrying for Tony's safety. "I'm not coming down till I'm good and ready-!" The brunette let out a yelp as his feet slipped from under him, and he began to fall.
"Just follow my lead, Capsicle." Tony says into Steve's ear, who nods, and allows his hands to be placed on the brunet's hips, and allows the latter to roll one pair of his into the other, grinding them together, the front of Steve's jeans tightening significantly as they brushed against Tony's front, slowly at first, so as to match the beat of the song, and then more quickly with the drop of the bass, the brunet's body moving effortlessly with the music, and Steve had to think conciously to not let his jaw drop.
Steve thought as he twirled the shorter man, and then stopped him so he was now facing him. He extended his leg so that it fell behind Tony, and slid into it. The beat of the song picked up, and so did they. Their movements became one. No longer did their “rivalry” show, now, it was a tango. They moved in such a way that the audience gasped with each twirl, each graceful step. They had never seen such a display. The dancing couple was making love to the music, and using each other as simple bodies. The song ended, and Steve dropped Tony into a dip while falling to one knee.
“No one is allowed back at the hotel without me knowing, got it?” Tony began to run, but Natasha stopped him. “Tony,” He looked back to see a soft smile on her face. “You really love him don’t you?” Tony smirked, and looked away. “Just make sure that no one comes back to the hotel.” Natasha released her grip on his arm, and watched the Iron Man, the one who never truly loved, run after the man he loved with all his heart.
Christine texted him, asking him if he wanted to get together and have lunch. He didn't answer, and left his phone at his apartment. He wasn't going to be answering to her today.
"Um, Ash? Why don't we get out of here, it's getting a little too crowded for my taste." Steve tried to keep his focus on Ashley, but it was getting harder to ignore Tony's presence. "Oh, yeah. How about my place?" The girl muttered quietly, a smile forming on her face. "Sure, anything you want." The soldier got up quickly, holding onto her hand and rushing out the door.
"I thought something was up." he grumbled, going to the mini bar. "I don't get why everyone is so excited, it's not like it's not like we haven't seen him in years." Tony grabbed a bottle of brandy, and Steve quickly grabbed it, giving him a serious look. "You don't need a drink Stark." The brunette matched his facial expression, obviously not amused.
Tony growled, causing Steve to look up. "What?" Tony looked over surprised. "What?" Steve smiled, finding humor in the younger man's absent mindedness. "Nothing, let's go back inside, you look like you're freezing." The blond got up, and offered a hand to Tony. He scowled, and got up on his own.
"And just because you're small doesn't mean you're light!" Steve retorted, "I'm a freaking super soldier and I got tired!" "Really? Is that why you passed out in my bed? Or were you just hoping to get lucky?" The brunette asked, cocking an eyebrow and smirking. The blond laughed, almost falling out of his chair, had it not been for Tony quickly grabbing his hand, and preventing him from falling back. "Hey, you have to have a few drinks before you can start falling out of chairs."
He half expected everyone to jump out and yell, "Surprise!" The soldier listened intently, thinking he heard a noise.
Tony looked up, a little more than shocked. Bruce was rubbing his temples, trying to keep calm. "You always try to keep secrets, and look where that's gotten you." He said, and walked over to his friend. "You need to stop hiding, and just let everyone know what you feel for Steve, the fact that you love him." He reasoned, placing his hands on his friend's shoulders. "I can't do that Bruce! You don't get it!" Tony exclaimed.
"More or less." Steve responds, having no toruble speaking over the music. Tony looks back at the dancers, before looking up at the blond, smirking. "You wanna dance?"
"I've um, I've missed talking with you Tony. I mean, yeah we talk back at S.H.I.E.L.D, but I mean," Steve dropped his gaze to the table. "I miss our real talks." "So have I Cap- Steve." The brunette corrected himself. "Even if we, you know, that doesn't mean we can't still be friends, right?" "Yeah, it's not like we still," the blond said, dancing around the word. "I'm sick of trying to pretend like I don't want us to be close again. I mean, friend close." he muttered, and Tony nodded in agreement.
He finally got out, and changed into some clean clothes. He tried not to think about the earlier events as he went back to Stark towers, starved. "Hey Steve, have a good work out?" Bruce asked, putting up a fake smile, he knew Tony hadn't told Steve, and knew that it probably wasn't the wisest choice to tell him now. "Fine." he muttered, and grabbed a plate of food before sitting down. "Everything okay?" The scientist asked, and the blond nodded softly. "Just hungry is all." He smiled softly. "Mhm, then eat. It's no wonder you keep snacks in your suit." Bruce laughed, and Steve laughed with him. "Well no one likes a snarky leader."
"Steve! Get in here!" Tony cried out. "What is it?" Steve called back. "Just get in here!" The hung-over man retched again, causing Steve's stomach to churn. He never did do well with puke. "Alright, I'm coming." The soldier sighed as he began walking towards the door, preparing himself for the worst. As he reached the door, he breathed in, and out.
"Sorry boy, but I'm not staying. I'll tip you for the water-" Toni stopped when she looked up, eyes falling on a simply stunning young woman, blond hair brought away from her face and pulled back in a nice bun, while a few pieces where still left to escape and dangle in front of a pair of crystal blue eyes, and pouty lips. Toni had to keep her jaw from falling open.
"You. You really think that anyone is going to care that Tony and I are gay for each other? I mean, besides Pepper being pretty upset, I can't see it as being much of a problem." He said, smiling. "Who's to say we didn't tell everyone already?" Christine's jaw dropped slightly, she was obviously caught off guard, which caused Steve to laugh again. "I don't think you have! I mean, it would have been all over the news, and Stark's name would be ruined! Tony Stark, leader of Stark Industries, having an affair with Captain America! That's a pretty big scandal if you ask me!" She said angrily, becoming even more annoyed.
"Don't you dare try to bring her into this." Tony growled between clenched teeth. "Why shouldn't I? You're her boyfriend after all; she has the right to know the truth." Christine taunted. "What the hell do you want Christine?" the brunette asked, leaning up against the wall, defeated. "Ooh, and they say you can't take the fight out of the kid." she laughed, and Tony clenched his fist. "Let me think about it, if I can get something good out of this, I want it to be special." she giggled again before hanging up.
. Tony quickly pocketed his phone, and began to run upstairs. He didn't even bother to try the elevators, this was an emergency. He needed to find Steve, and fast. The man was out of breath by the time he reached the sixth floor, and he didn't bother knocking. He didn't have to. "Steve?" Tony called out, looking around the apartment. The door had been wide open, that wasn't a good sign. "Steve? Where the hell are you?"
The next night, Steve was enjoying a cream soda and watching some late night television after a workout. He saw in his peripheral vision that the blinds to Tony's window were open, giving him a great view into the other man's bedroom. The soldier craned his neck a bit, almost dropping his drink once he saw that Tony was naked. He turned his head back to the screen, blushing furiously. He had only seen the brunette from the waist up, but that was enough to start the cogs in his imagination to only begin to dream of what that little strip  led to.
. He checked his watch, biting his lip. It'd been a little more than an hour, maybe Steve wasn't coming, that would be easier. He could handle it, it would help to keep the feelings he still held buried. He looked down at his glass, pushing it away. He had been trying to give up on alcohol. It hasn't tasted as good lately.
"Steve, what's up with you today?" Ashley's voice broke Steve's concentration, and he remembered where he was. The couple was seated in the restaurant, a plate of pasta before Steve. He hadn’t touched it; he wasn't hungry. The girl bit her lip, worried. She looked up at him, and saw him smiling. She sighed, and took his hand in hers.
"That's Captain Rogers to you, Stark!" Stephanie hissed, before her eyes widened in realization. She opened her mouth to cover her tracks, but Toni put up a hand, stopping her.
"I'm sorry Tony. It's better that I leave for a while. Maybe this is a sign, a sign we need to break up for good. I mean, look at us, did we really think we would last?" Steve shook his head, laughing so he wouldn't cry.
"So, this, last night, it didn't change anything for you?" Steve questioned, disappointment slowly stirring. But what had he expected; that they would all of a sudden go public? That this hook up would actually mean something to Tony- the guy whose had more women and men than Steve could count on his fingers and toes? It was a stupid notion.
Tony pressed a finger inside of himself, and gave a small moan, pulling his finger in and out of himself, and adding another. It wasn't long before Steve grabbed his hand, removing his fingers from his entrance, and replacing them with the blond's hard prick. Both gave a small moan of excitement as the soldier began to move in and out, pressing himself as far as he could go. Toyn bucked his hips upward, feeling the blond move with him and grunting with the effort. "God Tony, I love you." Steve whispered as he reached around to the man's front, and began to stroke him.
"Alright Tash, you ready?" Clint asked, stretching his arms behind his head. Natasha cast one last look back at the laughing couple, and shook her head. "As ready as I'll ever be." she smiled, and pounced.
Tony grabbed a wrench and began to tighten the bolt when he heard the doors open. He looked over the object to see a young Bruce Banner entering the lab. He admired the large invention, a smile spreading over his face. "Wow Tony. It looks great!" The scientist walked around the object when he noticed a small emblem on the side. He tilted his head, and tried to get a closer look.
Tony turned the corner of the hedges and gasped. He watched as Steve kissed the blond, and his heart sank. Tony felt a sick feeling rise within him, and he hoped it was the booze finally getting to him. He turned around, keeping his head down. He was thankful for the snow falling. It would give him an excuse as to why his face was wet. He got back in the car, and slammed the door. Without buckling in, he sped off, wanting to be as far away from the house as possible.
"I can feel you breathe; I can feel your heart beat faster! Take me home tonight; I don't want to let you go till you see the light! Take me home tonight! Listen honey, just like Ronnie said, be my little baby!" The crowd sang in unison, including the two men. "You've gotten better since we last danced." Tony noticed, eyeing the soldier up and down. The blond shrugged. "Practice makes perfect I guess." "I wouldn't call it perfect," Tony teased, and Steve scowled. He reached his hand out to give the man a light shove, but he dodged it and instead, took the hand in his own and intertwined their fingers before turning into Steve, pressing his back against his chest.
"So, how are you today?" Steve began. Tony laughed. "You know Cap, Today started out pretty shitty. And now," Tony looked out the large windows, the sky becoming dark with night. "Now, it's better." he smiled, and Steve smiled with him. The atmosphere, the mood, everything was almost perfect.
"A toast, to good friends!" Steve said raising his glass. Tony joined him, and sipped on the disgusting drink. He wasn't a wine person, and never will be. His face twisted into one of utter distaste, and he could hear the other man chuckle. "Tony, I have a bottle of Schnapps in my hotel room. Why don't I go get it?" Steve offered, jerking his thumb in the direction of the door. He knew Tony was just trying to be polite, but the soldier didn't like wine much either.

"I'm gonna kill you both!" Steve yelled, a hint of teasing in his voice. "Come on now Steve! That's not very patriotic of you!" Clint joked, looking over his shoulder. A cold snowball smacked him hard in the face, and he fell. "Clint!" Tony said over dramatically. "Leave me Tony! I'll hold him off!" Clint yelled, matching Tony's tone. Steve laughed as he grabbed Clint by the ankle, and began to playfully drag him across the snowy lawn. "No! I can't let him take you!" Tony cried out as he quickly spun on his heel, and launched himself at Steve. Steve fell back, and Clint joined in the dog pile.
Everyone held their breath, waiting for Steve to begin yelling. He came back up, his face covered with cake, the red, white, and blue frosting in his hair, and on his clothes. He wiped the cake away from his eyes, and stuck a frosting covered finger in his mouth.
He stepped out of the bathroom in his dressing room, and straightened his suit jacket. He walked out of the room, hearing the announcer getting the crowd ready for his arrival. "Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, Tony Stark!" The crowd cheered as the curtains pulled away and the music began. He stepped up to the microphone, observing the crowd.
Steve gave him a nod of approval. "I trust you." "Steve! There you are!" Tony's voice entered the happy moment, and the two men looked to see him with a Brandy in his hand, and an overly happy look on his face. "Hey Brucie. You having fun?" Bruce rolled his eyes, and smiled. The man never ceased to amuse him. "Yeah, your boyfriend and I were just talking." Tony's smile fell from his face, and he opened his mouth to defend himself. "He knows Tony." Steve cut the man off before he could make a fool out of them. "What?" Tony looked at them astonished, and Bruce shrugged. "Lucky guess."
About a month had passed since Steve and Tony had begun their affair. They tried to hide it from the rest of the Avengers, besides Natasha of course. They knew they could trust her. But the others… They didn’t know how they would all handle it. Barton remained clueless, and Thor had left the night after. “Important business in Asgard,” was all he could tell them. Bruce was a little more difficult. With him and Tony always working in their lab, Steve found it hard to spend time with his new boyfriend. And as for Pepper, well, they were going to save her for last.
"Why the hell are we meeting Fury here?" Tony asked as he walked out to the open area. The place resembled a park, with couples with their children, some musicians, and the usual homeless person begging for change. The brunette scowled, and Steve nudged him with his elbow. "Wipe that look off your face. Show a little respect would you?" The blond growled.
Steve drummed his fingers on the table, wishing everyone would get here so he could go home. He didn't mind the fact that they had a job to do; it was the thought of seeing
Tony groaned slightly, turning over so that his back was now facing Steve's chest. He reached up and began to untangle the blond's arms from around his body.
A half-naked Steve stood there looking at him, his eyes serious as always. He looked as if he had just rolled out of bed; his hair was still not brushed out, and the fact that he was dressed in sweats with no shirt, well that furthered his suspicion. The brunette motioned for him to come in, and the blond accepted. He took the bottle from Tony's mouth, still not saying a word. He examined the bottle and sat on the couch, his jeans making a noise as they slid across the soft fabric.
"I'm a Stark, we don't share our problems. Now let go of me, and I'll be on my way. Obviously Bruce hasn't told you, this wasn't my idea." The brunette said, keeping her voice chilled. She felt the hand on her arm loosen, but not completely let go.
This is gonna be a fight chapter, between Steve and Tony of course. It's necessary, It's the Avengers after all. And maybe it'll appeal to the more, "Actiony readers".... Ah well.
He looked back to where Steve's body had been blown away, and suddenly, he found himself running. Running to where the man he never told had died. Please Steve, don't be dead. Tears streamed down his face, and he stopped in front of Steve's shield. It had remained intact, but there were blood stains across the dark blasting powder. Tony broke down again, picking up the shield and holding it close to his chest. "Steve, I'm sorry. I never told you, I never told you how I felt. And now it's too late." he sobbed. "Oh God Steve, you can't be dead. Please don't be dead."
"And that makes you think I need a woman?" Steve's voice rose in anger, and also, hurt. He didn't want a woman, he wanted someone to listen. A lump rose in his throat, one that made it hard to swallow down his hot coffee. "Rogers, come on. You need to put yourself out there! You can't stay a virgin forever!"
"I had a great time with you Steve." Ashley said, standing in her doorway. Steve smiled politely, hoping she didn't invite him in. Slowly, snow began to fall, causing Steve to look up. The girl giggled as she watched the snowflakes melt on his eyelashes, making little paths down his face. She had no idea he was crying.
“I’m not stupid; I know exactly who you are.” He smiled, and leaned in close enough so their faces were only inches apart. “And also, I’m not into blondes.” Steve straightened, gave her a small nod, and walked away, leaving Christine open mouthed and pissed.
