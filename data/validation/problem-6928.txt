Jim steps back, holding his hands in the air. “Hey, Boss, no need to get offended, I mean, what do I know? It’s not as if I’ve ever seen you make a bad judgment call or anything.”
"You said you knew I was SHIELD," Steve said after a moment of silence had passed between them. "Why did you humor me?"
Steve didn't look at her scrutinizing expression for long, just worked on cracking eggs into a bowl. "He invited me to hang out."
," Steve said, nipping at Tony's jaw. "We're not doing that, standing up, in your shower. That's an accident waiting to happen."
Tony’s hand worked its way up from Steve’s hip, rucking up the hem of Steve’s t-shirt as he went. Steve tensed with anticipation as Tony’s fingertips skimmed over his stomach and back down, barely past the waistband of Steve’s pants. This was the slowest he could recall them ever taking things when Steve wasn’t the one holding the reins; Tony usually let impatience get the better of him, driven by the need for release. Maybe a good night’s sleep, or a near death experience, was enough to change that.
It was somewhere like six months down the road that they started sleeping together, and Tony had put all thoughts of it out of his mind because, well, he had a lot better things to worry about. The matter didn’t spring to mind again until Steve changed the sheets one afternoon after they had sex and, in the wee hours later that night, Tony woke to see Steve creeping out of the bedroom with a laundry bag under his arm, like some kind of domestic vigilante.
Steve nodded to show he was listening, but didn't interrupt; it seemed like Tony needed to get all this off his chest.
A few days before Christmas, twenty-five years ago, Howard and Maria Stark left their Fifth Avenue mansion in Manhattan for the annual Van Dyne Christmas gala. Tony's flight home from Malibu was delayed, and he arrived home a couple of hours later, deciding to skip what was left of the party and go straight to bed.
Steve gives the lock one good whack with the tip of the prybar and broken metal goes skittering off across the floor. Tony rubs his hands together and moves to open the box, but Steve grabs one of his wrists and Jim the other.
Tony sighed, flopping back on the bed, his eyes turning to the ceiling. He recalled earlier, being reverted back to an eight-year-old, with all the emotions dwelling close to the surface thanks to youth, but his mind loaded with all the clarity of his years of experience since actually
, of all things, just a soft puff of breath between kisses, and was encouraged to repeat that move on the other side.
Steve sidesteps the attack, grabs the open side of the handcuffs, and drags the chain against the man's neck before he can get away. The force is only enough to cut off his air and send him sinking to the floor, and Steve feels a little guilty for the way he tosses the man aside in order to face the next threat.
"Mm ... yeah, Cap?" Tony called, making an effort to sound more awake, and probably failing miserably.
"Well," Pepper says. "See to it that you do - and if you go anywhere interesting, you know you owe me the story first!"
Steve, much like the rest of the world, thought Tony was an incredibly handsome man. Tony's body was lean and well-toned, and for all the fact that he claimed physical shortcomings next to the team's SHIELD complement, he was definitely no desk jockey. His arms were wiry muscle and he had the strong, callused hands of a man who was used to getting his hands dirty, even if his nails were always immaculately well-manicured.
By the time he went to bed that night, tired and happy and with a comfortably full stomach, Steve thought it was about the closest he'd come to feeling normal in the twenty-first century yet.
Tony shakes his head. "Alternates. They've got the traces of radiation from life spent under a different sun than our own. That was my first test after I discovered they were human. Or, in other-Thor's case, Asgardian."
“I’m not ...” Steve paused, taking a deep breath, and forced himself to remain calm and objective. Except that objectivity was difficult for him, when Peter Quill’s easygoing smile kept popping into Steve’s head.
They settled together onto the couch a companionable distance apart from each other, and Tony switched on the projector.
"Are you sure you're okay?" Steve asks. They take a seat on a couple of shipping crates outside the warehouse, and Tony slumps against Steve.
Steve hooked his elbows under Tony's knees to draw his legs up further, and set a steady pace, his hips pounding rhythmically against Tony's ass. Tony lost coherency aside from encouraging words and the occasional demand for more or harder, until he had to reach up and brace his hands against the headboard to keep himself from sliding up against it from the increasingly faster pace of Steve's thrusts. It was harder than Steve had intended when they first came to bed, but he knew he had taken his time and been far gentler than Tony might have wanted, so he was content to let them both get lost in each other for a time.
Steve didn’t look convinced. “I may be strong and fast, but Iron Man could stop me, if he really wanted.”
"Something like that." Steve helped Tony to his feet and reached his arms around to brush snow from Tony's back. It became an awkward tangle of limbs as Tony tried to bat away Steve's attempts to help, and they ended up doing an awkward dance around each other while the other few party guests politely ignored their antics.
Steve hummed an acknowledgment. A moment of silence passed between them, until Tony - in the midst of nervous fidgeting - could no longer stand it.
"Is this really necessary?" Tony goes on. "As if I'm going to run with a dozen guards holding me at gunpoint?"
Beneath them, between them, Anthony moans, and Steve and Tony break away from the kiss, looking down to find his attention focused on them both. Anthony makes a soft, needy sound when Tony pulls away from him, but Tony silences the noise by stooping down for a soft kiss.
“It’s not that I think that,” Steve said. “But Hulk’s file wasn’t the only one that needed updating.”
As far away and as close as the Lower East Side, a young Steve Rogers picked up the magazine, lured in by the colorful cover and its promise of adventure tales to rival even those of the Midnight Racer. He was hooked.
Here in the Bavarian Alps, no one in German command suspected that any Allied forces would be so foolish as to attempt a ground incursion (least of all with merely two men), so the presence of the dirigible was certainly a surprise to them. Intelligence reports had gotten out prior to this, of course, about the Allies and their crack team of super-powered men, but the enemy remained ignorant of the knowledge the Allies had gained about Hitler’s growing collection of occult artifacts.
Jim and Bucky are carrying a heavy-looking box between them, which they heft onto one of Tony’s work tables. The box is shaped like a cube and made of a dull gray metal, the hinged lid locked with a heavy padlock.
"That's too bad," Steve said. He felt a bit ashamed for having suspected those canceled plans were fabricated, before.
"Even though you're here working, Doctor," Steve tries, "I have reason to believe your safety may be at risk. Have you had any suspicious encounters, random visitors?"
Natasha rolled her eyes - which seemed like a common occurrence when Clint was around - and skipped back to the beginning of the disc. "Stop calling him
Tony took his time now, palming Steve through his sweatpants, until Steve’s cock was hard and straining against the fabric. Steve made a sound that came out much more like a whimper than he would readily admit to, his hips reflexively moving into the touch. He pressed back and found that Tony was just as hard, and the contact of Steve’s ass brushing against him inspired a muffled curse from Tony.
Steve's tradition of having lunch with Pepper every other Tuesday began several months ago, when she first ran dry of ideas for the magazine. The largely exaggerated exploits of Iron Man and Captain America still run monthly, even though it has been a long time since the two heroes have had any adventures together.
Tony sighed softly, glancing back at the bed, where Steve was starting to inch over into the warm spot Tony left. Part of him - a large part - wanted to crawl back under the covers and stay there with Steve, but it was probably time that Tony started giving a little less consideration to what he
They get out of the rest of their clothes when they go to clean up, and Tony is finally granted the opportunity to see Steve naked in a scenario where he is actually welcome to look. Steve seems surprisingly at ease under the scrutiny of Tony's gaze; maybe there's an unspoken rule that shyness has no place between two people who have just had sex.
"You got me," Tony said, rocking forward into Steve's grasp with a quiet groan. "That was definitely worth the time and effort."
any more cliched, Baron?" Tony demands, grunting as one of the soldiers nudges him roughly toward a chair.
The nightlife in this district never really dies, but it does move around - progressing from bar to brothel to seedy hotel room - and by the time Steve reaches his destination, the hour is late. The infamous Princess Bar looks like a complete dive from the outside, but lights spill out from the windows and door, a beacon with the promise of booze, even at this time of night (or morning).
“Never flown it in my life,” Black Widow answered, right before she threw the craft hard into a full stop.
"No, it's ..." Tony shakes his head, reaching up to cup Steve's cheek in his hand. "It's been a long time. Howard was long dead
Tony rolled onto his side to look at Steve, eyebrows raised as his eyes swept down Steve's body. "You didn't ... I mean, can I help you out with that?"
Tony laughed, reaching for Steve’s hand. He laced their fingers together, and spent a quiet moment studying Steve’s face in the dim light that spilled between them from the arc reactor. His expression sobered, and he said, “Look, Steve ... I just wanted to let you know ...”
Rhodey had to leave once they were done with Disney World, forced to return to concerns outside Tony's bubble, though he made sure to extract a promise that Tony would keep in touch before he left to board his flight. Tony made good on that, mailing postcards from Georgia and Tennessee and Kentucky as he continued his strange, circuitous route through the country, determined to hit every state he could without getting on a plane.
Tony thinks he tells Steve that he'll hold him to that, but he isn't sure he actually gets the words out before drifting off.
The corner of Steve’s mouth twitched. “As it turns out, people in glass houses and all that ...” He made a vague gesture. “You’re looking for your own kind of justice, Tony. I respect that, even if I don’t like the deception. And ... you came clean to me, so I only have one thing to ask.”
Steve allows Tony to set the rhythm for a while, but once they're moving steadily together, Steve presses back into each thrust, until they're moving at a punishing pace, Tony's hips pounding into Steve's ass.
Tony seizes within seconds, his body convulsing of its own accord. The pain is worse than being shot or even voluntarily electrocuted as he is every time he charges the repulsor pump.
Even though standing face to face with Tony Stark makes him feel like an uncertain young soldier all over again, Steve refuses to give any ground. "I still could."
After breakfast and cleanup, Steve turned his attention to making himself presentable. He felt sort of wrong doing it, but if part of his supposed allure to Tony lay in his appearance, Steve supposed he needed to look as good as possible. He enlisted Natasha's help in choosing his clothes, and finally left the house in jeans, and a cardigan sweater layered over a shirt, with his coat, gloves, and scarf to keep warm.
With Anthony present at the Baxter Building, and Tony working in his own shop, they reach a breakthrough with Reed by lunch, just as Tony suspected they would. It will take another day or two for them to fabricate and test the technology needed to implement their plan to send Anthony home, but it can be done.
“Give Stark some space,” Clint finished. This time, his hand was the one to land heavily on Steve’s shoulder, steering him toward the elevator on the other side of the room. “You and I both know he’s gonna need some time to beat
By the time Steve got back to his temporary home, the house was dark except for a light in the kitchen. Steve let himself in and was surprised to find Clint in the kitchen, making breakfast.
Tony sagged against Steve in the seconds after, and Steve rolled all the way onto his front, grabbing Tony’s wrist to haul him along. Tony was not a small man, but his weight was just solid and comforting along Steve’s back. Steve was feeling too blissful to worry about much except for the kisses Tony was still showering on his shoulders and neck, the warm breath and tickling scratch of Tony’s beard on his skin, for a few minutes, at least.
On the last night of their journey - it will only be a few hours before they set off in the submersible - Namor joins Steve at the aft railing, leaning there as he lights his pipe.
The noises faded out behind them as Tony led the way out a back door. It was well below freezing outside, but in spite of that, a few party guests huddled against the side of the house smoking cigarettes. Tony led Steve a short distance away, and tugged him down for another kiss. Steve leaned in to it, in spite of every moral fiber telling him this was no longer a special exception; he needed to come clean now, to tell Tony the truth.
"It's probably nothing," Steve said. "Just - there was a car on Tony's street when I left his house. I thought it was a little strange. There was someone sitting in it, and they had the motor running."
Steve can't help wondering if he could have made a difference, had he been there. Or if he had helped to find another way of ending the conflict with Japan. It wasn't as if Steve had been happy about all those civilian casualties. But Steve had dealt with his own dark days near the close of the war.
Tony pushed his empty plate and bowl aside, and sat back in his chair, looking at Steve evenly. “I thought I was acting for the good of everyone.”
Steve sagged forward a little and, after a long moment, remembered himself and straightened. He was considerate, tucking Tony back into his jeans - most of the mess was on their hands, anyway - before he pulled up his own sweats, then he grabbed a towel from his dirty laundry to wipe their hands clean.
"You know I have to be different, Steve." Tony tosses the repulsor aside and reaches up to grab Steve by his collar. "Now come here and kiss me before I pass out."
What Tony once described as the beginning of a beautiful friendship - shamelessly snatching a line from Bogie - turns into a partnership. Iron Man and War Machine become near regulars of the Howling Commandos’ lineup, and even Fury and Phillips are impressed with how seamlessly Iron Man works with Captain America.
"If an opportunity arises," Natasha said, "then I think you'll know it's time to tell him. It tips things further in our favor if he finds out Stane is watching him. There's no way that looks good."
Tony’s biggest problem was this: aside from the whole villainy thing, his biggest character flaw - the thing he was best at, his own well-being be damned - was his tendency to pretend his problems didn’t exist. To be fair, he did run down some more options, he even went through probability numbers and percentages with JARVIS, to see if there was any way around his current conundrum.
Tony fell back onto the bed after a moment, tugging Steve along with him. They got a bit tangled up as they tried to situate themselves without breaking away from the kiss. Steve finally gave up the kiss as a lost cause and pulled away with a soft, frustrated laugh. Tony was laughing, too, as he took the opportunity to settle himself more comfortably, head dropping back against the pillows.
Steve placed Tony's coat on the hook next to his own, and nodded down the hallway. Tony followed as Steve led the way to his bedroom, though Steve stepped aside after pushing open the door, to allow Tony to enter first.
Steve smiled back over his shoulder. “With all this blocking the way? You can guard the entrance. The room is just over there, and it looks empty from here.”
The art store proved to have a wide array of things that Steve had nowhere near the money for seventy years ago, and he took his time browsing the selection before choosing two sketchpads of varying weight, a variety of pencils in graphite and charcoal, and a few different erasers. Even the fifty dollar budget he allotted himself did not go far; the bag Steve ultimately left the store with was hardly a notable weight in his hand.
The truth was, it hadn’t really taken an awkward conversation in an elevator to make Tony realize that how he felt about Steve was really much deeper than their ill-defined status as two friends and teammates who happened to sleep together. The troubling part was that Tony had no idea what to
"That's what I've been trying to figure out," Coulson said. "I've been in deep cover as the assistant principal at the junior high where he works as a science teacher. We've managed to acquire DNA for testing, and even the man's dental records. He's a match for Stark."
"Great." Tony smiled. "It's pretty casual, no need to dress up. Starts at ten, so wanna meet me at my place at nine-thirty?"
Steve glanced again at the notes on the table: a sketch of Dr. Spectrum using his powers, equations Steve could not begin to understand, and the image of a letter ‘A’ with a circle around it, crossed with an arrow, that sparked something strange inside Steve’s own mind.
"I need to get in there," he said. "Coulson briefed me on all the complications, and I've been thinking it over: I'm still a Stark Industries shareholder. I come back, get him to accept me back into the fold - publicly, he can't afford to reject me - and I'm pretty sure I can find the incriminating information that SHIELD needs to do away with him."
,” Clint said, heading Steve off at the pass, “no one likes it when Mom and Dad fight, so ... I’m gonna give you a piece of advice, Steve: we all fuck up sometimes. Yeah, Tony lied to us, and yeah, he almost got his dumb ass killed, but everything turned out alright in the end. So ... you might wanna let this one go.”
"I don't know," he says, as honest as he can get. "I haven't had time to assess the situation properly, and - I don't want to risk your safety, if they really are watching you."
Of all the things Steve was feeling at the moment - and they numbered in a confusing jumble - chief among them was ... relief?
A few inches to the left, and he would have felt the evidence that Tony wasn’t entirely flesh and blood under his shirt.
Some part of Steve wanted to protest the rough handling, but he wasn’t sure it would be Captain America speaking as team leader, or Steve Rogers speaking as ... well, he still wasn’t sure he could use the term ‘boyfriend,’ and that was part of the problem, wasn’t it?
Steve shook his head. “You were still a hero. When you flew off with that bomb ...” He took a careful breath, closing his eyes. “I thought I’d lost you.”
She tilts her head a certain way, and Steve remembers the woman from two nights before, the one who had been sitting on Tony's lap. The one who left when Steve showed up.
Tony reached out for Steve as Steve lined himself up and began to press inside; Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's shoulders and took him easily, rocking his own hips up until Steve was all the way inside.
Tony looked up sharply, and for the first time since Steve had arrived, he actually did look angry, not just sad and resigned. "What else am I supposed to do, Steve?"
Steve didn’t seem disappointed by the answer, at least. He just asked, “What’s the real story behind you and Iron Man?”
was the one meant to put his life on the line. But Tony had never looked at him that way, had he? He'd never been afraid to call Steve out, to tell him things he didn't want to hear. Tony represented everything Steve needed to balance his hectic life. And damn it all but Steve wanted to be that person for Tony as well. Even if trying to do so ended in a burned bridge or an emotional explosion neither of them could come back from.
“Rhodey bear! Do you truly think so little of me?” Tony placed his free hand over his heart, a long suffering sigh leaving his lips. “I thought what we had was special.”
They approached the stairwell as cautiously as they could in their current conditions, Steve insisting upon taking the front position in case any stragglers happened to be hiding out and ready to attack. Tony rolled his eyes but let the stubborn idiot take the lead.
Steve approached his husband, sheepish but firm as he pressed a kiss onto the corner of Tony's mouth still laden with toothpaste. "I'm sorry. Mayor de Blasio felt like being especially wordy tonight."
As Steve approached the closet to toss his clothes into the dirty laundry hamper, he heard a lingering strain of music drifting from the en suite bathroom. A quick glance at the clock on his bedside nightstand told him it was nearly midnight.
Steve couldn't help glancing over at the man in question every few minutes. The "financial advisor" role fit Tony like a second skin. Though he wore many hats and many faces depending on the situation, Steve liked this one the least. Seeing Tony mingling and chatting up various people with an engaging smile and intrepid charm rubbed against Steve's already frayed nerves.
To any new readers, welcome to the story and please don’t murder me because of how long I take to update.
hallucinating the inordinate amount of sugar and sprinkles awaiting him. Then his lips stretched a wide smile that scrunched the corners of his eyes. "Looks delicious, pumpkin," he praised as he untangled his arms and took the plate.
"Anthony, you left so quickly I nearly missed you." Because apparently they were on a first-name basis now. Tony should have paid more attention when Pepper gave him the initial rundown. Not knowing the Brit's last name made it tough to be professionally formal enough to give the guy a hint. Mainly that Tony did not enjoy his company and would rather be on a deserted island with a coconut phone.
Tony shook his head fondly as the wolf loped off at a speedy pace, perhaps hoping to impress his spectators. Steve, as modest as he could be, was such a show-off.
Jarvis didn't need body language to convey a healthy dose of sarcasm. His reply of, "Fondly, sir," could freeze the Eye of Sauron with no problems.
Eventually Pepper gave him the look that said "give a Tony Stark speech and you can go," so Tony jumped to his feet and obliged her, being sure to reiterate some of the points previously made to assure everyone present he had indeed been paying attention. Some people doubted his multitasking capabilities. He answered a couple of questions, gave a salute, and left the room as quickly as decorum allowed.
"Not well," Thor admitted. "I have a new path to follow. Perhaps it will lead me to the answers we seek."
Shirako loosely translates to "white children" and is fish sperm, or sometimes the actual testes themselves.
"Yeah, no," Tony assured through watery eyes. "No Heimlich needed here. But. What?" Tony wanted to slap himself.
Bucky peeked around the corner, his head halfway through the neck hole of his puce green sweater bedecked with light up reindeer antlers. “Relax, Stevie. They love us too much to cut off our dicks.”
Sixty minutes passed far too quickly for Steve's liking, but when his time was up he dragged himself to his feet and over to the door. He'd hate to be the person responsible for ruining someone else's sauna time.
"Steve, no. That's stupid. You're usually a genius in the field but that is one of the dumbest plans I've ever heard. And that's counting all the wannabe villain monologues I've been subjected to."
"Of course." He ushered Steve inside, directing him to the plush chairs situated on one side of the room. Once they were both sitting, he asked what was wrong. He had expected some call to action, not for Steve to look shy and embarrassed.
Steve took up his knife and fork and cut a piece of pork chop for himself. “Apparently I need to lead by example.” He brought the morsel to his mouth and slid it off the tines of the fork. It took a moment to chew, though he did his best to hide any potential grimace from appearing on his face. “There. See? Perfectly fine.”
It felt like only a second had gone by between deciding to get out of bed and standing on his feet. A blissful minute of silence passed. Then a piercing siren rendered everything else senseless.
The god held it out to Steve, who took it with gentle fingers. He held it up to eye level, apparently just as fascinated by the color as Tony was.
Thor reached into the pouch clipped onto his belt and revealed a glass vial containing a shimmering silver liquid. The viscous substance reminded Tony of moonlight.
“Back to the matter at hand, if I may,” Thor interjected. Tony scoffed at the interruption, but respectfully refrained from continuing his debate. “The potion will take effect within six hours of consumption. Once ingested, it should send you into a deep slumber. You may see some things. When you awaken, we will know one way or the other if it succeeded.”
"It's a good one," Tony agreed fondly. "I still think he posed that way on purpose. Even bots know their good side."
“But I’m at least 79% sure, actually let’s round up to a nice 85%, that nothing terrible will result from this… magic juice. Ew, really need to come up with a better name. Let’s just call it multiverse wolfsbane.”
"Of course I care," Tony said, breaking Steve from an inner downward spiral. "You can't be angry or disappointed with someone whose opinion doesn't matter. You can feel betrayed by someone you don't give a shit about."
"Welcome to my humble abode," Tony said with a grand wave of his arm to showcase the room his own father had once inhabited years ago. Well, not the
Steve covered his mouth to hide his chuckle but apparently he didn't succeed because at that moment Tony turned to face him, eyes wide like a deer caught in headlights. The toothbrush hung from the corner of his mouth, residual toothpaste dotting the corner of his lips, as the music continued to play at a softer volume.
Next, Tony patted some clear liquid under his eyes then smoothed some type of lotion over his entire face. He looked so loose and relaxed that Steve envied him for a moment. Then the bright red toothbrush emerged from the vanity and Steve couldn't resist grinning.
"Steve, come on." Tony pushed against the man's shoulder, with little to no visible results. "I need to pee," he whined. "If you get up I'll give you a treat." Tony sighed. He would try one last trick, and if it didn't work he would resign himself to the inevitable.
Steve could feel a tear pushing against his eyelid as he closed his eyes, so moved by the touching moment of pure adoration. Boy howdy did he miss his mom right now.
"Never had any luck with love, have you now? Must be a hit on your self-confidence. The great Tony Stark can't even keep a relationship."
being his only warning. The wolf instantly dashed to Tony’s side with hackles raised and teeth bared.
When Steve finally took the last bite of fried rice, Tony held out his hand for the now empty carton. Steve thanked him as it exchanged hands. After placing the cardboard box on his bedside dresser for Dum-E to dispose of later, Tony handed Steve the vial.
“Indeed, he is. Has he scratched a message into the floorboards? Dragged a novel or magazine of importance to your side?”
Steve felt a chuckle push past his lips before he could stop it escaping. "You're terrible." He could see the door ahead now that everyone else had given them a berth and made a clear path. "Just a bit further, Tony."
it took me a few days to type this up from the day i actually wrote it out but here we are! fun filler chapter for all
“While that makes perfect logical sense, because really no one watches Trek like me, I feel you’re hiding your true motives here.”
"But surely it must hit you at times? The fear of being alone for the rest of your life, no one beside you when you find yourself on your deathbed."
His mind was too preoccupied with running over the words of Steve's request. And then analyzing those words and every possible consequence into oblivion.
Steve shrugged helplessly. "I don't know exactly. Maybe it's part of the spell? I just have this insatiable need to be near you all the time. My skin itches when we're too far apart, the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end when someone else gets too close to you." Steve laughed humorlessly. "This is so fucking ridiculous."
"Can you say that one more time? I could have sworn you said you wanted to share my bed but that can't possibly be what you actually said."
He stepped fully into the room, keeping his steps extra quiet to avoid startling the baby. Up close he learned that Peter had brown eyes like his father, and the same upward tilt to their mouth when they smiled. "They're cute as a button," Steve said after a moment.
Tony stretched his arms as he laughed. Time to get out of bed. Unfortunately. Sleeping with Steve curled so close to his side had left behind a lingering warmth he wasn't quite ready or willing to rid himself of.
Steve took a calming breath. Looking around and seeing no one, he banged on the locker a couple times in hopes of a miracle. Nothing happened. He tried jiggling the handle back and forth, up and down, side to side. Nothing. He tried pushing inward and pulling outward. He pleaded with it, threatened it, offered some ice cream. Nothing changed.
“Okaaaay,” Tony drawled. “Thanks, buddy. But don’t you think we have more pressing matters to attend to?”
"Never said you weren't," Steve replied breezily, a distinct departure from the days he would look askance at such a blatant innuendo. "Just wanted to. If that's alright."
Steve looked up at the ceiling, the projected star map taking his attention. He traced various constellations with his eyes and Tony watched the movement quietly. A handful of terse minutes later, Steve turned onto his side and faced Tony fully. Being the sole recipient of his gaze unnerved Tony now just as much as it had when they first met.
Tony chose to distract Steve, and himself, from the impeding unknown with a longwinded rant regarding the farce that was banana flavored food items. Which led to discussing who decided grape, orange, and bubblegum were the best choices for children’s medicine. Which then devolved into hybrid fruit creations Tony asserted would be delicious if they existed. By the time they reached the bedroom, Steve held his aching ribs from laughing at Tony’s progressively more ridiculous suggestions.
Steve paced the room restlessly, futilely glancing at his wrist watch as if he could stop time with mere willpower alone. He plucked at the itchy wool of his bright red santa sweater, the white pom-pom at the collar that topped off the character’s hat nearly tickling his chin.
Unsurprisingly, the wolf took an interest in the punching bags and weight station that Steve favored whenever he came into the gym to burn some steam. Tony held in a laugh when the wolf snorted derisively at a sweaty towel someone had left behind.
Steve entered the room, placing their lunch on the coffee table positioned in the middle of the room. Then he walked the perimeter, taking in the various paintings on the walls as well as the clutter spanning the bookshelves that Tony had come to love. Gifts from clients, photographs with diplomats, an old paperweight that once belonged to Maria. Odds and ends of wire or metal he'd tinkered with in his spare time but had never thrown away.
"Okay," Tony replied bemusedly. "That's nothing new for any of us. Why didn't you just have Jarvis initiate your secondary sleep aid?"
“Do you… uh,” Tony met the wolf’s gaze, hand shuffling through the mop of hair on his head. “Do you really want me to throw it, Steve?” It felt so surreal speaking to a wolf and expecting it to answer. But Thor seemed convinced it was possible, and he’d seemed to understand Clint well enough. “Because while I think indulging Clint’s childish fantasies of owning a team mascot is ridiculous, it would be beyond my paygrade to deny Captain America his new favorite chew toy.”
"I was asking the lady's opinion." When silence fell, Steve added, "And I would very much appreciate it if you loosened your grip."
"And tell your boyfriend, if he says he's got beef, that I'm a vegetarian and I ain't fucking scared of him!"
Tony sighed from where he slumped on the floor, head thrown back against the wall behind him. "I'm fine," he reiterated as Steve approached. "I can't believe you just did all of that. Actually, scratch that. I can completely believe you would happily go to jail in order to protect a woman's honor. What I
Steve watched with a soft smile as Tony wiped his face clean with a soft washcloth, twirling as the song floating through the air hit a crescendo. Some would call him a creeper but seeing his husband so soft and happy filled Steve with a tangible warmth.
Thor's expression turned sheepish, a look Tony would never get used to seeing. "I give my sincerest apologies. I seem to have set the cooking appliance aflame."
Tony looked over his shoulder at Steve and smiled. "She's a known troublemaker. The regulars know to stay clear of her."
Four hours passed in a blur of Tom Hanks hijinks and Ryan Gosling giving Steve Carrell dating advice. Tony’s spoon hit the bottom of the ice cream carton with a dissatisfied thump. He sighed and shut off the television. At nearly one in the morning, he should probably attempt to sleep. Not to say more orthodox traditions such as sleeping though the night ever applied to Tony Stark. He could count on one hand the amount of times he’d slept “normal” hours in the past year. And one of those had happened last night, with Steve by his side snoozing up a storm. The man oozed warmth and safety wherever he went. Probably a side effect of the serum. Those strong arms, those thick thighs, that disarming smile…
Tony followed suit, his face immediately scrunching into a look of displeasure. “Uh, yeah. Just fine.” He went for a bite of mashed potatoes and instantly took a long sip of wine. “Jesus, Cap. What did you put in these potatoes? Sand?”
Tony turned toward the boy, addressing him and essentially ignoring Gregory's presence altogether. "Yes?"
with the urge to shake the man in front of him. All of the anxiety and bottled up anger from the last few days, hell the last few
The man ambled over to take a look before nodding. "Old Betsy never does like it when someone fills her up."
Steve gave the all clear and Tony resumed helping the other man along, pushing one of Steve's arms across his shoulders to help lessen the burden of his weight. Steve gave him the side eye, as if Tony would crumble and submit to a stare he'd more than gotten used to by now, then sighed and carried on without a word.
"Yeah, I'm home." Steve stepped into the room, smiling softly. "And this was exactly what I needed."
When Fury had given them all vouchers for a free weekend at the spa resort forty minutes outside of town, Steve had been suspicious. His boss rarely showed sympathy, so why did he suddenly tell his employees to take a load off after a hectic season? It seemed fishy, even Sam thought so. But who was he to look a gift horse in the mouth and question his sudden fortune?
," Tony asserted, shifting where he sat. "You should be more worried about Interpol busting down that door and dragging America's Golden Boy out of the building in handcuffs."
"Sir, you can't leave this room," a voice said behind them. Steve assumed it belonged to one of the bodyguards from earlier. "You assaulted a royal personage. We'll have to arrest you."
"Oh! I remember!" Steve held a finger to his lips and Morgan's voice dropped back to a whisper. "You said we could make breakfast and surprise!" She happily grabbed the plate of toast from the kitchen counter and brandished it like a knight's blade.
“The potion didn’t work right, did it?” Clint stopped in his tracks when a low growl reverberated around the room. He gazed down, finally laying eyes on Steve for the first time. “Whoa, easy there. I’m not going to hurt your boyfriend, Cap.”
With nearly anyone else, the quiet would have driven Tony to ramble about his latest obsession (clouds weigh a million pounds – 5,000 tons! – and yet somehow no one had ever attempted to harness all that potential). But in recent months, Steve’s presence had morphed from something anxiety inducing to something he could linger in. The wolf beside him offered that same sense of acceptance, which made it easy to just stare at the numbers ticking each floor they passed.
As Tony leaned into his side while encouraging Morgan as she told them about her latest art project at school, Steve squeezed his husband's hip and let himself relish the moment.
Tony awoke to a mouthful of soft hair and an armful of sleepy super soldier. He cracked open one bleary eye, the light of the room blissfully dim, partially in thanks to black out curtains and partially in thanks to Jarvis having pity on him and letting him sleep in. The alarm clock on his nightstand proclaimed the time to be just past noon. He hadn't slept that long or that peacefully in one go in... years probably. Well then.
Everyone followed Sam into the kitchen. Steve chuckled as Bucky and Sam immediately started pushing each other, trying to be the first to fill their plate. The island counter was covered in various dishes from various cuisines: mashed sweet potatoes and green bean casserole, roasted chicken and red rice, chow mein and kimchi, tofu soup and vegan macaroni and cheese, and of course the more traditional honey glazed ham and stuffed turkey. There were even a couple dishes Steve didn't recognize, so he assumed they must have been Tony's contributions to the potluck.
"Okaaaay then. Well, I'm gonna hit the sack. See you in the morning, Cap." Tony looked up where Jarvis had helpfully projected the current time onto the ceiling. "Later in the morning, I mean."
Did Tony not think about the fight they'd had on the plane last night? The disagreement weeks ago that initiated all this sour tension between them in the first place, did that mean nothing to him? It kept Steve awake at night, unable to focus on anything else.
“After I take it, would it be alright for me to… if I stayed with you?” Oh, those blue irises and soft gaze would be Tony’s death. “If it’s too much, I understand.”
Steve handed over the thermos of coffee he'd been hiding behind his back since he and the kids had left the kitchen, bowing low with a flourish. "My liege, your beverage."
So when Friday morning came, Steve grabbed his weekend bag and got into the shiny black SUV waiting for him on the curb outside his apartment building without a single question on his lips. He took in the scenery as it changed from concrete to open fields and back to concrete. He fiddled with the loose thread on the back of the driver's seat and smiled, feeling some of the past week's stress ebbing away. And when the car pulled into the drive of Serenity Spa and Resort, Steve thanked the driver before grabbing his bag and heading inside to check in.
Steve rolled his eyes, a bad habit he’d picked up since living in the tower with the other Avengers, and turned back to the kitchen to deposit the dish. “We’re going to have it for dinner, aren’t we? So you may as well tell me.”
As soon as he sat down, he closed his eyes and let out a contented sigh. The attendant would call in on the intercom to tell him when his time was over, so Steve let his mind wander. His hands drifted of their own accord, marveling over how loose and pliant his muscles felt beneath his fingers. He hadn't felt this relaxed since… ever, maybe?
With the other Avengers following through with individual plans, only Steve and Tony remained at the Tower for Christmas Eve. In the beginning Steve had nearly fled, worried being the only other resident may make things unbearably awkward. But Tony had asked him to stay. Well, JARVIS had passed along the message that Tony had invited Steve to join him for his traditional Hallmark movie marathon. Steve had offered to make dinner and the rest was history.
From the corner of his eye Steve spotted a man bullying a woman into a corner of the room. He couldn't see their faces clearly, but the thinly veiled aggression in the man's shoulders, the harsh tone of voice brushing the edges of Steve's enhanced hearing, raised all the red flags in his mind. The woman seemed resigned to her fate, which fanned the flames of Steve's simmering contempt all the more.
He listened to the man rambling at the front of the room about stock values for all of five minutes before his mind started to wander of its own accord. He was thankful Gregory had been strategically placed on the opposite side of the room. One more minute of his company would most likely drive Tony to rash actions no one would approve of.
Steve’s lips lift in the quickest smile Tony has ever seen before they fall back into a neutral expression. “This is all your fault.”
Steve fought the grip on his shoulders enough to catch Tony's eye. The wounded man stood in the doorway of the closet now, leaning half his weight on the door jamb.
The ones in Los Angeles and New York City were easy. Steve knew most of those people already, whether they be grandsons of men who knew Steve in the heyday and felt entitled to familiarity or the typical power hungry type unafraid to put on a little bravado if it got them the audience of Captain America. There was no Steve Rogers in events like this. He knew what to say, what not to say. Sometimes that made the hours of nodding and listening easier to endure.
“I find myself quite fond of such delicacies and wished to share their existence with you. I believe you may have similar tastes to mine, as evidenced by previous experiences.”
“Hmm?” Tony looked over to Steve, having drawn his focus to his hands as he rambled. He tended to do that. “Sorry, got a little ahead of myself. Have a question for me?”
Update prior to posting: When I started on this chapter months ago, I was taking care of my mom.  She passed in June. I just didn’t have it in me to do much of anything. I’ve been trying to push myself into working on this a little at a time over the past few months and have finally gotten this out. Hope you all enjoy some crack-y fluff with little to no plot.
With Tony still otherwise occupied, Steve decided to take matters into his own hands. Tony would be fine without him.
“What brings you here anyway?” Tony doubted Steve came by (Twice! In the same day!) just to make sure Tony ate something substantial. “Aside from your heroic endeavors to ensure I don’t starve myself.”
Steve shrugged, unapologetic for nearly killing Tony. Not to be dramatic. "I figured we ought to talk about it. Get it out in the open."
“Okay! Enough with the uncalled for insults. If we’re going to insult anyone, let’s insult the Hallmark Channel and their entirely unoriginal romantic movie plots.”
After going through three strips of fabric, the area looked as clean as it was likely to get. Steve sat back and released a breath he hadn't realized he'd been holding the entire time he'd been attending to Tony. The quiet gave him time to process everything that had happened. He'd gotten Tony
The bed dipped as Steve settled on the other side of the mattress. He hesitantly scooted nearer to Tony, stopping with a respectable distance left between them. Tony took one look at the man's hopeful expression and knew he was screwed. He could barely deny Steve in normal circumstances. Knowing that the space between them could cause Steve physical discomfort made his next choice easy.
Tony laughed. "Honey, you'll feel just fine in the morning. But if you're really tired tomorrow, I'll take care of your schedule."
"An intern. Got me out of a tough spot. Old Greg wanted to do lunch, can you believe that? Pfft. As if." Tony noticed a flash of annoyance wash over Steve's face. Bless him, that man's empathy stretched for miles in every direction. "Told him I had better plans." He paused to take another bite of pasta. "So much better."
After satisfying the initial wave of hunger, Tony hazarded to look up at Steve. Who happened to be chewing at his food at a normal pace like a normal person. Tony could almost see the teasing remark poised on the thip of that smug smirk.
Tony turned in the opposite direction, fully set on escape, but managed only one measly step toward evasion before manners forced him to pause. There was a hand on his shoulder that didn't belong to him, meaning it had to belong to Gregory. Tony didn't bother turning back around.
When the group passed Fury, the man fell into step beside Steve. "We'll do what we can to get you out quickly, try to make your stay comfortable. It might take a few days to soothe a spoiled prince's bruised ego."
"Comrades, I will disembark posthaste to my world in search of a cure to the magical malady affecting our dear Captain. I shall not return without a solution."
“Of course, sir. I feel it pertinent to inform you the rest of the team has already assembled and are awaiting your arrival.”
But of course, Tony's mind was probably playing tricks on him. Sleep deprivation and agitated injuries had that effect on a person.
“Of course, sir. While I do experience concern for your emotional and physical wellbeing on a constant and consistent basis, I do have news.”
Tony slackened his fingers. Steve pulled away, a small smile playing across his features. "Just gonna hit the head," he explained when Tony continued to look at him. "Be back in a sec." Then he was gone.
Tony rolled his eyes. Using his free hand, he staggered to his feet. Steve moved instinctively to support his weight, which earned another patented Stark eye roll. "You're telling me. And I thought I was the one with the need to be the center of attention at parties."
They ate in companionable silence after that, more focused on finishing the fries before they ended up cold and essentially inedible. Clint asserted they tasted just as good if reheated in the toaster over, but he was the only heathen among them to truly believe that blasphemy. In the meantime, Steve ate his way through three cheeseburgers while Tony polished off the remainder of his pasta.
Tony, eyes glazed, looked so vulnerable in that moment Steve wanted to tear the world in two. He could count on one hand the amount of times he'd truly seen the man before him in a raw, open state of being. So no one could blame him for moving to hunch over Tony, to protect him from the pain Steve himself had caused. The tears threatening to spill from his eyes didn't matter. He'd just laid his cards out on the table, offered his heavy heart to a man he had despised and admired and slowly come to love.
The wolf turned its brilliant blue eyes onto Tony, tongue lolling happily from one side of its mouth. One paw idly pushed against the fallen shield. Did it really expect Tony to play fetch with it? It was one thing to play catch with Steve on the rooftops, living out a misguided childhood dream, trying to find something to bond over when Tony had no idea what Steve was really like. But now it felt… odd. He’d rather take the wolf down to the lab, hand it a paintbrush and some child friendly watercolors, and see what happened. A piece of art made by a wolf would be niche enough, but something made by
sauna. But he would be on his own, so Steve didn't worry about it as much as might have under different circumstances. He stuffed his clothing into a locker, made sure it was shut securely, then wandered through the entrance into the sauna room.
“Maybe,” Tony hedged as Thor declared, “Indeed!” He turned to glare, but really, how could anyone be mad at the pure delight on Thor’s face?
Distantly Steve wondered who he'd just decided to physically assault and how much trouble Fury would give him once he found out America's Golden Boy had gotten into a brawl. He heard sounds, voices, in the back of his mind but they were fuzzy due to the pounding rush of adrenaline thrumming through his veins. Then one sound filtered in and registered: a gun being cocked.
Tony took a step forward and stopped, breath pushing through gritted teeth. Steve's concern flared back to life.
Tony shuddered, both hands clutching at his side where the bullet had left stains on Tony's otherwise flawless charcoal grey suit jacket. Steve gripped him tighter in response.
"I guess that's unsalvageable," Steve muttered morosely as he dumped the blackened goo into the trash can.
When Steve crossed the threshold of the room, comfort washed over him like the tide. There was nothing in the world that could match the feeling of being
Taking the route he knew to be cowardly, Tony left his office and headed straight to the private elevator coded to ride directly to his penthouse. Three steps forward and ten steps backward, aka the story of his life.
"Gregory, wasn't it?" Tony asked cautiously, but made himself sound more disinterested than unsure. He had a reputation to uphold, after all.
"We do," Steve agreed. The smile on Tony's face was worth the sharp jolt of discomfort when his new keeper tugged him in the opposite direction.
Tony shook with repressed laughter. He gave the ceiling a look before ambling out into the hallway, unsurprised to see a ruffled Clint standing in the middle of the hallway.
"You saw what I saw. He was obviously genetically enhanced, and we don't have time for another stretched out battle. I don't know about you but I'm starting to get exhausted, which means we've been at this at least two hours too long."
Tony thought blithely as a mental image of himself being strapped to a metal table with Brit Douche standing over him in a lab coat a la Frankenstein flitted through his mind.
After a few hours of discussing various topics, Bruce went to his room for the night. Natasha stuck around for a further half hour before she too left for the solace of her room. The quirk of her lips as she bid Steve goodnight wasn't lost on Tony, but he still had no idea exactly what it meant. In her defense, one did not often see Steven Grant Rogers curled on his side and snoozing comfortably on the lap of Anthony Edward Stark. Truly a sight to behold, in Tony's humble opinion.
Tony's press smile sharpened at the edges. "I don't see that happening. Though I do appreciate your concern, did you have any actual questions for me?"
Steve grinned softly in return, unable to resist the sight of his sweet children looking so excited in their dinosaur (Peter) and cloud (Morgan) pajamas. Hopefully Tony had forgotten all about the hushed planning session he had walked in on a few days ago.
“Don’t I know it,” Tony replied. “My kid’s not even a year old yet, so I know I have a lot to look forward to in that regard.”
"Nah," Tony decided as he leaned back in his chair, shuffling through some files Pepper had left for him to look over. "We'll let him find out on his own."
Steve huffed a breath through his nose, returning to Tony’s side. Tony’s hand fell to his side, instinctively running his fingers through the thick, wiry fur brushing against his fingertips. The action soothed him as much as it soothed Steve.
"Ha. I like to think I've learned something from each of those wonderful people. Kindness, patience. The art of making a perfectly stirred martini."
The other man turned, one hand shooting out to grab the woman's wrist as if Steve's appearance would give her an opportunity to escape. The woman nodded politely as Steve, giving no indication anything was amiss. Her reaction did nothing to calm the roiling concern in his gut.
Tony would never grow accustomed to the sight of Steve Rogers reclining in his bed like he belonged there. Red silk sheets against milky stretches of exposed skin, Steve looked expectantly up at Tony. A small twitch of his lips as their eyes locked.
Tony met the man halfway to the black sedan parked conspicuously at the curb, Steve by his side. Tony could have sworn he heard something like a growl escape the soldier's lips, but he'd probably just imagined it. "My boss likes to keep me informed," Tony replied succinctly. No need to give the guy a bigger ego.
“But that’s all part of life, of growing older,” Steve continued, cutting Tony’s words in their tracks. “It’s not your fault, Tony. It’s not anyone’s fault. Well, maybe mine for taking the serum in the first place. Or HYDRA, that would be an easy place to lay blame.” Steve looked right at Tony then, and Tony felt paralyzed by the man’s gaze. “If it weren’t for all that, the pain and fear and heartbreak, I wouldn’t be here right now with you. Which isn’t all that bad, if you ask me.”
Tony went from one reporter to the next, suave as ever. Steve followed along silently, keeping a small distance between himself and Tony. He didn't want to be involved, but he wanted to be nearby just in case.
"Mr. Stark?" came a tinny voice from somewhere behind Tony. In that moment it sounded more like a chorus of angels than an adolescent boy. Thank fuck.
Following an old hardwired protocol he and Bucky had developed in the days of their youth, Steve approached the couple casually. Best not to spook anyone before he could even get a word in. Once within earshot he directed a small smile at the woman and asked, "Nice shindig, don't you think?"
He reached out to take Steve's hand. Steve let himself be led from the room while Tony called out, "Cut the music, J."
"I'm feeling good now, thanks." Rhodes called out to Tony as the man seemed on the precipice of saying something else, but instead he closed his mouth to smile warmly at Steve. "That's my cue to join the circus. See you in a bit."
tour, had Steve on edge. He'd never felt comfortable schmoozing with politicians and people wealthy enough to pay their way into influential social circles. Seventy years in the ice and a handful of years in the 21st century hadn't changed that fact.
Tony straightens in his seat on screen, Steve subconsciously doing the same on his IKEA couch. “Well,” Tony says, “it’s been great seeing everyone have such a positive reaction. But now, I think it’s about time I catch a plane. I have someone in Boston I kinda want to see, so that’s where I’m heading.”
Tony watched the chrome doors slide silently shut in front of him, wondering how impossible this situation would have seemed even a month ago. Not that he and Steve didn't get along, or that they didn't see one another on a regular basis. Generally they just didn't converse much, and when they did it was usually either a break down of the most recent updates to everyone's equipment or a friendly debate over Star Wars versus Star Trek. Sometimes Steve would scold him for doing something stupidly reckless during a mission. Never had Steve offered to bring him a late lunch.
Steve grinned, the edges of it crinkling the corners of his eyes. They gleamed a beautiful blue in the dim light filtering in from outside the tower. “I appreciate your concern,” he assured Tony.
Tom, the poor kid, stumbles over his parting words. “That sounds great, Mr. Stark. Hope you have a safe flight.” Then he turns back to the camera, eyes wide. “That’s all we have time for folks. A big thanks to Tony Stark for joining us. Make sure you pick up your own Immortal Tamagotchi this Friday in a toy store near you.”
Saturday passed in the same way: languid, relaxing, easy. Steve made conversation with different technicians as he went from station to station. There was Claudia, the nail technician, who had an aunt in the business and used this job to help save for college courses. Nadine, the woman who trimmed his hair and gave him a scalp massage, with the look of a model and the mouth of a sailor. Lily, with gentle hands and a sweet voice leading him through some guided meditation.
Defeated, Steve flopped down onto the wooden bench behind him. Head in his hands, he tried to think of a logical solution. He could just go to the front desk, tell them what happened and head back to his room. He didn't particularly want people to see him naked, but what other option does he have?
"I don't see how." Tony waited for a scathing quip from the AI in question but none came. Apparently he would let it slide. "How's the search for a cure going?"
Once everyone had their drinks the way they liked them (Tony's black coffee with a dash of brown sugar, Natasha's tea with milk, Bruce's tea with honey), they fell into a comfortable discussion revolving around Clint's latest obsession: Neo Pets. How he found time to save the world, keep his skill sets sharp, and care for fifteen of the things while running a somewhat illegal online shop on the side was a mystery even Jarvis couldn't solve.
“Guess it would be asking too much for you to be able to talk, huh?” When the wolf blinked, Tony shrugged. “Worth a shot.” He sighed, looking around the room for answers that didn’t exist.
"He's at my office already?" A nod. "Yeah, tell him I'll be there in two shakes." Tony slipped himself out of Gregory's grasp, which had loosened throughout the exchange, and moved to give the kid a handshake. "Thank you," he said as he looked TJ straight in the eye. He flicked a dismissive glance toward Gregory and added, "Take care of our guest, will you?"
"I'll make you a plate," Steve offered. "Take a load off and let me pay off some of that life debt."
Tony entered the designated room to find the other Avengers spread around the large dining table that often served as their impromptu meeting area. Clint and Nat sat on one side, Bruce at one end, and Thor at the opposite end. The seat beside Steve was left empty, assumedly for Tony to fill. Steve caught his gaze as he walked in, though he quickly turned back to Natasha. This is gearing up to be a long night, Tony thought dourly as he took the empty seat beside Steve. He turned his attention to Thor, who seemed more restless than usual.
AIM had upped their game since the last time the Avengers had ran into them. They still used the terrible costumes and the predictable lair layout, but the weapons upgrade had taken Tony (and Steve) by surprise. Where had they gotten all this new tech??
Steve moved mindlessly, thinking only of reaching Tony in time to push him out of harm's way. Maybe he wouldn't be able to deter him, but he had to try. He couldn't have Tony's blood on his hands. Not Tony, not now, not ever.
Less than twenty minutes ago he had been willing to take a bullet, maybe even die, for Tony. But Tony had been the one who had jumped into harm's way on Steve's account for no reason other than to protect him. Steve was the super solider.
"You don't have to do that," Tony objected. Seeing Steve being chivalrous apparently did things to his brain. Like reveal his thoughts aloud to the object of his thoughts.
Tony, despite his better judgment screaming about how bad of an idea this was, heard himself say, "You can stay."
“I’m sorry, I just feel terrible about it. I’ll back off.” Steve rose to his feet, realizing belatedly that he had crowded into the other man’s space without so much as asking. “Can I help you inside at least? You should probably let Nat take a look, just to make sure there won’t be any swelling.”
Luckily it seemed like the bullet had grazed Tony's side rather than lodging itself inside flesh. Steve ripped a strip of fabric from his dress shirt and wiped down the area as best he could.
“Fine,” Steve acquiesced. He lifted a lump of potatoes to his mouth and muffled a displeased groan. He forced himself to swallow the gritty mess that not even copious amounts of butter could mask. “They’re fine.”
Tony's lips were somehow softer than Steve had imagined. Maybe there would be a next time -- would there be a next time? -- and he'd be able to sink into it for a while. Truly relish having Tony in his arms. Even with lips numb from nerves and his fingers spasming against Tony's nape, it was easily the most explosive Steve had ever felt. As quickly as it began, Steve forced himself to pull away.
While Tony internally battled a whirlpool of utter astonishment, amusement, and an odd sense of warmth in his chest, Steve took his leave. Tony watched him go, the office door clicking shut softly.
"Something like that," Steve responded, his eyes set on a reporter who didn't seem to understand the concept of a press line. Everyone else with their badges and microphones were staying behind the barricade with no problems.
Steve smiles, feels his cheeks flush under Tony’s gaze. The man’s looking straight at the camera now, straight at
Bruce gave his thanks. Natasha smiled softly up at the ceiling. Interacting with Jarvis was the only time Tony ever saw such a gentle expression on her face. He had a sneaking suspicion, that he could not confirm via security footage and valued his life too much to ask her about directly, that she and Jarvis talked late at night when she couldn't sleep. Where else would Jarvis have learned a Russian lullaby?
Steve seemed to take the opportunity to give Tony a glance over, gaze hovering around his wrists and collarbones, both exposed despite the button up shirt he wore. The best thing about being Tony Stark? He never had to iron his clothes, even though a lovely drawing from Clint implied otherwise. (Said drawing hung in the workshop above the Mark 1, an ode to what could have been had the name been a bit more literal.)
Tony watched without saying a word, which worried Steve more than if he'd been yelling or rambling or complaining. Silence with Tony now was unfamiliar territory, though it had become more frequent recently.
“That’s not reassuring either,” Tony muttered. He turned to Steve. “I can’t make you not take this, Steve, but I would personally feel a hell of a lot better if I could look into it first. What d’ya think?”
When he arrived at the designated room, they directed him to the men's lockers to disrobe. No one had mentioned the sauna was a
“Of course you can, Steve,” Tony’s voice turning soft but sure. He put on a confidence he didn’t really feel – magic always left a bad taste in his mouth – and focused on making Steve as comfortable as possible with what could happen once everything got set into motion.
The wolf merely stared in response, though really Tony could have sworn maybe there’d been an imperceptible tilt of the animal’s head. Or maybe he was imagining things? Regardless, he slowly unwound himself from the sheets covering his body and lifted his legs over the side of the mattress, lowering them incrementally until he felt lush carpet beneath his toes. Cautiously, he stood, eyeing the wolf the entire time in case of any sudden movements. Hands held up before him, Tony took a step in the wolf’s direction. It lowered its body to the ground, eyes somehow even more narrowed on Tony.
“Of course, with our luck, the ingredients needed are now rare and highly volatile. To obtain them I traveled to another universe and infiltrated their black-market society.”
Everyone minus Steve gave him a look. Tony looked between each face and sighed. "We thank you, friend, and wish you the best of luck with your journey. May the gods be with you."
"Bullet, they were aiming at the hinge in the armor where the neck plate snaps in. Didn't want to take any chances." Before Tony could respond that he could handle himself just fine, the other man was already on his feet and trading punches with the agent who had pulled the trigger.
Curious, Steve followed the sound. It felt vaguely familiar, though he wasn't sure why. Peeking his head around the doorway, Steve smiled at the sight that met his gaze.
Once Tony took off his headband and slipped out of his fuzzy socks, they fell into bed together with a satisfied sigh. Tony nuzzled his way under Steve's arm, wiggling around until he found the perfect spot. Steve obliged, dropping a kiss to the crown of Tony's head once the other man settled.
“Regardless, handle it with caution. I wish the both of you Odin speed and success.” Thor squeezed Steve’s shoulder amicably, then Tony’s, before leaving the room, likely to attempt sleep for himself.
The camera shot pans out, showing Tony lounging comfortably on the opposite end of the couch. His collar undone and tie missing, Steve knows this is the last of the press junket Pepper insisted upon. Two weeks prior Tony had been all press smiles, perfect posture, and pressed suits. Now his eyes have that telltale gleam which, to a trained eye, says exactly how tired he is.
A clang from the other side of the bank of lockers sounded throughout the otherwise quiet room, causing Steve to jerk out of his moping and look around. Maybe this person could help?
Tony greeted Pepper with his usual apologetic smile, garnering her usual eye roll in return, as he took his seat at the table mid-conference. She should really just let him Skype in at meetings. Everything would be less stressful for everyone involved. But, alas, that dream was not meant to be.
“Come on in,” Tony said, waving toward the couch he kept free of clutter in case someone came around. Originally for Pepper and Rhodey, though over time it had slowly become a home for everyone in the tower. “Have a seat. You’re gonna need it.”
Thor shrugged. “A multitude, though with your enhancements it would be hard to say which to expect.”
"Thanks." Tony rose to his feet. "Time to eat. I gotta get something in me before the kid realizes he's hungry too."
As usual, Clint ignored him and walked towards them. “I thought a team mascot was out of the question? I feel so left out.”
"Sweet freedom," he murmured, one safely outside the range of Pepper's hearing. Ears like an elephant, that one had, and the memory to match. It wasn't that he didn't like being updated on the state of his company. He just preferred the solace and comfort of his workshop to being judged and graded by people he didn't really care for.
Were all the interns of Stark Industries otherwise detained? Tony's savior should have arrived by now. Apparently he needed to create a position entirely for pulling himself out of awkward situations. Make sure they were paid well for their service. Rhodey would throw a fit. "Where's my paycheck?" he would cry. "I've been saving your ass longer than half of these kids have been alive!"
After a day of arguing with selfish politicians, herding curious children at the aquarium with Sam, and chasing rambunctious dogs around for a local shelter's adopt-a-thon event with Bucky, Steve Rogers wanted to fall face first into the fluffy mattress he shared with his husband and not open his eyes for a week. Rationally he knew it wasn't possible, but it was a nice thought to entertain as he rode the elevator up to their shared floor.
"Who's TJ?" Steve inquired curiously. Though, to be fair, all of Steve inquires were based in curiosity.
“I hate when they do that,” he muttered. He looked over to the wolf, laying with its head splayed atop the practice shield. It met Tony’s eyes and held a placid stare. “Guess it’s just you and me, huh? Want to play some more? Are you hungry?”
Steve silently slid the dimmer switch enough to bathe the bedroom in a soft wash of golden light, enough to see by but not enough to push through his husband's eyelids and wake him. Morgan and Peter arranged themselves to one side of the bed, wearing a matching set of the sort of manic grin that Steve associated with candy stores and amusement parks. He took his place on the opposite side of the bed, leaning down to be at eye level with the little ones.
"Can I help you?" the man asked. Steve finally shifted his gaze, feeling the woman would be safe enough.
Steve took the incentive to lay out their meal, swatting Tony's hands away when he tried to help. Tony took the hint and sat down, pouring them each a glass of water from the decanter set on the table. Two styrofoam containers were presented along with a small circular dish filled with fries, the aroma alone already causing Tony's mouth to salivate with anticipation. Steve pushed one container across to him, plastic knife and fork laid neatly and invitingly on top. He placed the fries within easy reach for them both, then pulled the remaining container in front of him where he sat opposite Tony.
“What’s in the bowl?” Steve asked, reaching out to take it from Tony with the manners his mother had hammered into his mind decades ago.
"I'll have to make time to swing by," Tony conceded. "I miss Diane fawning over how I don't eat enough and Frank doing his best horrible impressions of my witty comebacks."
Bucky showed his appreciation for the vehicle once they had disembarked, walking toward it and letting out a wolf whistle. “I can see my reflection in the paint! This baby is a looker.”
Steve hesitantly picked up a few noodles, slowly bringing them to his lips. The smell alone, a gust of garlic and onion and heavy cream, nearly made him sick enough to drop his fork. But if nothing else Steve Rogers kept to his word, so he allowed the pasta into his mouth. The sauce coated his tongue like peanut butter. He hadn’t been so thankful for the serum taking away his gag reflex since the time he’d first fought on the front lines.
Tony physically shook himself. Nope, this was neither the time nor the place for those thoughts. Sighing once again, he got out of bed and wandered into his bathroom ensuite. He went to the vanity, planning on brushing chocolate remnants out of his teeth. His eyes landed on the counter, where two toothbrushes sat innocently. He had forgotten Steve cleaned up here that morning. Did that truly happen less than twenty-four hours ago? There was no escaping Steve.
Steve had this endearing habit where he talked to the owners of virtually every family run restaurant he went to regularly, got to know them a bit, and made a point of keeping up with their lives. Seeing as Frankie's was just a block or so from the tower, it was safe to say they all went there often enough to warrant such a camaraderie in Steve's books. Their daughter, Frankie, had a birthday card signed by all of them that she kept framed in her bedroom. If Frank was to be believed. The man had a knack for tall tales so who knew.
“In my bedroom mini-fridge.” Tony nearly laughed at the expression on Thor’s face. “Made the most sense to keep it where he’d be sleeping.”
“I’m fine, J. I know you’re worried about me, and I appreciate that very much, but I’ll be fine. It’s not my first heartbreak rodeo.”
“As I believed, there was a path to a cure. An ancient race distantly related to my ancestors possessed a tome detailing the chronicles of those who had come face to face with the same beings who attacked us. By the luck of the Bifrost, they had dealt with the exact spell and wrote of how to dispel it.”
The wolf stood, pushing its muzzle into Tony’s hand. Then it walked to the door and sat, looking at Tony expectantly. Tony looked up the ceiling in supplication, but his genius AI had nothing to say. “Alright,” he acquiesced. “Lead the way, Cap.”
"I was thinking of going for a run, since I slept through my usual routine. Then probably grab something for lunch at the diner down the street," Steve explained as they reached the elevator. The doors dinged open as soon as Steve stretched out his hand. "Thanks, Jarvis. After you," he said to Tony with a sweep of his arm. Tony obliged him. "Want me to pick you up anything?"
"Captain, please refrain from doing anything even more stupid." That was Nick Fury's voice. Had Steve saying the man's name summoned him? "In any other situation, I wouldn't think that to be possible," Fury continued, "but apparently your idiocy knows no bounds."
Tony glanced at the clock. One hour and eleven minutes into a new day. “He couldn’t wait until a more reasonable hour?”
Steve groaned as they sharply turned a corner, searching for the stairs that would lead them back up to the ground floor. Stupid underground lairs. If the suit were at all viable, Tony would have just shot through the ceiling, to hell with any cave-in potential.
Steve felt the flush moving over his cheeks and hoped it wasn't too obvious. All these years and he still gets blush-y over blatant come ons. "It's this locker right here," he said instead.
The door shook ominously once again, this time giving a loud creak as well. Steve turned his full attention to it.
“As far as I could tell, the potion should work and return you to your previous state of mind, Captain. Considering your strength, there should be no other consequences.”
Tony stood, arms flailing. “I’m going to get the dish I made, so you can taste what actual good food is like, and then we can argue. I’m starving.”
"Tony? Sweetheart, you need to wake up." Steve carded his hand gently through the tuft of hair sticking out of his husband's blanket burrito. A quiet snuffle reached his ears, soft enough to escape Peter and Morgan's notice. "Come on, baby," Steve said tenderly, tugging gently on the portion of the quilt covering Tony's face. "You don't want to keep our kiddos waiting, do ya?"
It was nice, just spending time with Steve minus impending doom, talking team strategies, or withstanding an upbraiding debrief from Fury. This was something Tony could get used to. Hypothetically.
Tony rubbed his eyes, tired before even facing what stresses the day was sure to bring. “What does that mean?”
“So, looks like we’re going in blind. I don’t like it, but I like a potential lifetime of you being tortured this way even less. No one should be forced to depend on me for love or affection.
While Steve continued his perusal of the room, Tony peeked into the lunch bag like a kid peeling back the wrapper of the coolest looking Christmas present. Unencumbered by nerves, since Steve's attention was currently focused elsewhere, Tony filched a french fry and gracelessly stuffed it into his mouth. Delicious. He glanced up to check Steve's progress, only to find he'd been caught red-handed.
. It raised itself up onto four legs, a pair of gleaming eyes turning in Tony’s direction. Piercing gray-blue eyes that reminded him of waves cresting in the middle of a storm. The animal’s dark blond fur, speckled with patches of brown, bristled when their gazes met. The creature soon relaxed though, as if it recognized Tony.
Steve ignored the jab, instead moving Tony toward the nearest exit. Each step felt a Herculean effort if the strain on Tony's face was anything to go by. Steve's logical side started to think this was more than "just a scratch" as Tony had claimed.
Steve felt himself relaxing, melting into Tony's embrace, stress lifted from shoulders. Finally he had an answer. The timbre of Tony's voice managed to calm him like nothing else had. Not since his ma had lulled him to sleep with lullabies when he couldn't stop coughing an hour past midnight on a school night.
Tony tugged on Steve's arm to get the man moving again, then chuckled despite himself. "Oh, I don't know. How about kicking it out of the room? Or tossing it back at the AIM idiots to buy us some time?"
There had been plenty of things Steve had dreamed about when he was young and imagined settling down and having a family: a little girl with his blue eyes and his mom's vigor; a white picket fence around a nice townhouse in the New York city suburbs; a wife, someone who could keep him on his toes and treat him as an equal rather than some invalid. But this, with Tony and Morgan and Peter, blew all of those dreams out of the water.
"You're a rare one, Steve," Tony said teasingly, "but sure. Who am I to deny a man paying off a debt."
“Welcome everyone. I’m Tom, reporting for Tech Moguls, and we have a treat tonight! The legendary Stark Industries President and CEO –“
A whine sounded from the other side of the door, reminding Tony of a puppy that wanted to sleep on the furniture but wasn't allowed. He reluctantly left the cozy warmth his bed provided to pad over to the door. One hand held the knob while the other lay in wait in case of an attack.
Tony settled down under the covers, Steve’s body heat palpable from the other side of the mattress. How the man enjoyed sleeping with blankets, Tony would never comprehend.
Tony felt mildly hysterical. Since when had he and Steve switched mentalities? But, hey, he wasn’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth. “Exactly!” he shouted triumphantly, feeling victorious in a way he couldn’t explain. “You get it. Barton made it seem like I was being unreasonable.”
Sam came into the room next, Natasha hot on his heels. James Rhodes, the man Sam co-leased the home with, followed behind. Steve didn’t know Rhodes well, beyond that the man had served in the US Air Force and wasn’t home all that much since his career took him out of the country more often than not.
"Penny movies were always my favorites," Steve said as he said beside Tony. He removed the engineer's hands as to get a full analysis of the situation at hand. Tony huffed at the treatment but allowed Steve to look his fill.
"Grazie." Tony excitedly lifted the lid of his dish, sighing happily when linguine doused in white sauce with chunks of chicken greeted his eager eyes. Chicken alfredo held a special place in his heart, so sue him. He picked up his fork and dug in, the fact that he hadn't eaten anything in the past twelve hours hitting him hard. Belatedly he realized he probably looked like a crazed dog capitalizing on an unsupervised steak dinner. But at the moment he didn't really care.
Steve twisted further to follow the bullet's trajectory, landing on both feet in the direction of oblivious men and women gathered nearby. Suddenly his stomach dropped to the floor.
"Shall I inform him his worries are unfounded?" Jarvis inquired politely, a hint of pure mirth tangible in his tone.
Thor shook his head. “Not if I can help it. If my estimates are correct, all should be well soon. Within a fortnight, two at most.”
"I'll get it," Tony volunteered when the kettle began whistling and the coffee pot beeped. Steve stood as well, something Tony still wasn't quite used to even after a full hour of being the man's center of attention. He walked a full step ahead of Tony, all senses on full alert as if some unidentified threat lurked invisibly around every corner. Like Jarvis would let such a threat exist within their home in the first place. But Tony bit back a sigh and let the man do his thing. At least Steve could help him carry drinks.
"It's going on two," Steve said at the exact moment Jarvis chimed, "The current local time is 1:53 pm."
Steve, bless him. "That would be great. Thanks." Two cakes. One wouldn't be enough for his heightened metabolism anyway.
Once Tony's face was exposed to fresh air, he shifted into Steve's touch as if by instinct. Steve smiled and caressed the slumbering man's cheek, tapping gently at the nearest cheekbone in an even pattern.
the scene he’d painted to Steve could potentially come across. He winced and glanced at him, but the man seemed unaffected. Well, if Steve wasn’t bothered by the idea of Tony playing mother hen… maybe Tony was overthinking things. No surprise there.
“As I was saying,” Thor continued, “through trial and error they discovered a potion that seemed to reverse the effects of the magic.”
Each step felt like a miniature earthquake inside his muscles, but eventually they reached the top of the stairwell with no surprise AIM agent interactions. Tony huffed and slid to the ground, sluggishly reaching out to trigger the emergency signal hidden inside the seam of Steve's suit. He would have used his own, but the armor had been so terribly damaged it would have been moot anyway.
Tony quirked his brow and popped his free hand onto his hip. "What took you so long? Don't think you can flatter me enough to forget what time it is."
Would Steve be stuck in this form temporarily? Permanently? Did the wolf also have a ridiculous metabolism? Did wolves eat cooked meat? Would Steve want the team to know about his new body? Could the wolf wield a vibranium shield?
"Mr. Rogers is in the building, sir. He says he brought lunch?" Tony couldn't help but smile at a bit at the intern's uncertainty. Wasn't every day, or any day at all, that Steve came to SI.
Steve wiped a stray tear of mirth from his eye, levelling Tony with an unimpressed stare. "You're funny," he commented, deadpan.
Steve happily took the food carton from Tony’s hand, spearing a piece of pork on his fork and pulling the meat from its tines with his teeth. If it were anyone else in his bed, Tony might suspect sensual foul play. But Steve ate without saying a word. Tony belatedly realized he still stood beside the bed, like an interloping voyeur caught mid-act. He slowly lowered himself into a sitting position, trying to act as if nothing was out of the ordinary. Staring at Steve while he ate probably wasn’t a less creepy alternative, but the man didn’t seem to mind the attention.
“Guess that settles things,” Clint said idly. “Have fun with your new pet, Ironsides.” He turned to leave the room and Tony couldn’t help the words that left his mouth.
“Hold on a second,” the man said. “Now, I never said I wouldn’t accept your offer. A hot drink and some dry clothes sounds heavenly right about now. And if you’re the one giving them to me, I’m not going to complain.”
“Not a problem. No way on this earth would I just watch as you chugged some illegal alien potion. Ridiculous. Absurd, even.”
Steve lips lifted in a gentle smile. Tony couldn’t stop his own from mirroring the gesture. They’d come a long way since insulting one another and lacking a core foundation of trust. In themselves, in the team, in each other.
“I let go of that title a long time ago,” Tony’s voice filters in, “and I’m sure Ms. Potts would kill me if I tried to take it back now.”
Steve looked like he'd rather crawl into a volcano than repeat himself. But then that stubborn look of determination Tony knew and loved stole over his features. "I need to share your bed with you."
Steve: Close your eyes Sam. It’ll be over soon and then Clint will go back to talking about whatever gourmet hot dog he eats next.
He couldn't keep himself focused on one thing for long. The cocktails at the bar didn't do anything for him, but he held one anyway. For the principle of it, Tony had said when the waiter had made their rounds with a large silver tray. So Steve had taken a glass and had been fiddling with it ever since, remembering to take a drink of it every now and then. For appearances.
Steve groaned in annoyance, but a good-natured smile remained firmly on his face. He looked down at his watch, because he refused to be rid of the old thing despite Tony's pestering (he'd even turned down a Rolex! which now laid somewhere within Clint's room), and moved to stand. Tony followed suit, rising to his feet.
Steve thought bitterly. Was it really that difficult to see? Maybe Steve had done such a good job of bottling up his emotions that even Tony Stark couldn't see through the facade. The way Steve's lips twitched in amusement every time Tony drank a smoothie Dum-E had given him and thanked the bot, the way he'd found his gaze drawn to Tony again and again when he was certain no one would notice, the way his heart melted every time Tony presented an Avenger with newly improved armor or technology; maybe Tony had never noticed those things. Maybe Steve hadn't realized the depth of his feelings until the possibility of Tony being gone forever lay right in front of his eyes. How could he be so stupid?
Tony stared after Steve's back until he melted into the crowd of people bustling down the avenue. He told himself Steve was just being nice, keeping Gregory on his toes and in turn protecting Tony from any possible annoyance. If the man thought he and Steve were... something... then maybe he'd back off. Not that he and Steve were anything. Other than friends and teammates, of course. Friends hugged sometimes. No big deal.
Tony shook his head and refocused himself on the task of finding some safe cover for them. He could only drag Steve around for so long before his own body would give out. Three hours worth of near death experiences would do that to a person.
“Sorry,” Steve said. “Habit. I used to help out at the orphanage when I was younger and kids have an uncanny ability for getting messy.”
Tony lifted the lid from the dish, revealing a mound of alfredo pasta. The sauce dripped down the sides in a goopy, viscous waterfall. He grabbed a clean fork for himself and handed Steve one as well. “Dig in, Cap.”
His body sagged with that last thought. He had been let down in the past – hell, he’d been the one doing the letting down in some circumstances. But it never got any easier, never hurt any less, when a relationship came to its inevitable end. Tony Stark was unlovable, he knew that. With Steve, he had let his own stupid crush color the way he saw things. He’d let himself get so attached despite knowing it would come crashing down sooner rather than later. With his mind whipping through emotions like a whirlwind, Tony didn’t think he’d be capable of facing the world today. He’d just lay in this bed until the sun left behind this terrible farce of a day or someone beat down the door to drag him out. Maybe the universe would be kind for once and let him wallow in peace.
'Think like him. Think like him. He'd get through this. We're almost done, Rogers. We're almost there.' Reopening his eyes he felt power within him swell and a familiar sense of calm confidence thrum in his chest. He could not forget who all of this was for and how even the last second details needed to move with him in mind. “We’ll assist with the medical request without issue but none of the development or deliveries is made without Stark Industries or an Avenger present. I wouldn’t put it past some of our new allies to try and disrupt the process to try and hurt my image. Or steal the work placed into it." His knuckles popped as he clenched his fist. He loathed when people touched his things. "This request is going to make us look even better than before as long as we are successful. So, Barton, this is yours. I want you to assemble a small team of at least five that you trust to keep the supply chain of our vaccines and cancer research secure.”
Steve went back to work on Tony’s pants, his fingers shaky but desperate. Tony was doing a lot better in his own pursuit—granted Steve was wearing sweats so the comparison wasn’t exactly fair. Nothing was fair. God, he needed both of them out of the clothes or he would actually go insane.
“Yeah, this,” to be a brat Tony dipped the Oreo in the mug and pulled it out and bit it, “is what makes you queasy.”
“Aww, there is nothing bigger and better than you sweetie.” Howard laughed. It was such a joyous, carefree sound and Tony didn’t believe it was his father for a moment. That sound had never been shared with his mother and himself.
“Something I should’ve done a long time ago. I can admit I screwed up as well. I gave you far too much space. Probably made you feel…” He paused, his voice soft and angry, “unwanted.”
“I just feel like I don’t know what to do right for him. He’s doing so much, you too, that I just want to give him something. I just don’t know what else to do.”
Steve was too gone caring about how the Fae reacted so he rolled his eyes again.“Arrogant too.” He tilted a brow. “So, despite all your compliments and sweet words, you really thought I was like the others?”
“Project is done.” Tony purred. “All I could think about was you. You took all my attention. I needed,” he hissed as he pressed their clothed groins together and gave a painful thrust, “needed to be home.” His tongue didn’t make it inside Steve’s mouth this time as it traced over the pink lips temptingly. “Tried to get you to go to bed. I can get…antsy after a project. High off a victory or something. But you’re up. You’re up after I couldn’t thin of anything but you.”
“How did you do it? It must be cause of your big eyes and pretty face—lack of intimidation. They rarely speak to men, especially a new one.” Sam noted with a pout, pulling himself up to start their journey. “Wanda is pretty shy and Nat can just be plain mean.”
Tony grinned. It was sharp like a predator’s. “Glad you finally asked. I’m looking for this.” And he grabbed Steve’s face and pulled him down for a kiss. It was quick, with their lips brushing, barely any pressure, but it made all the nerves within Steve’s body came alive.
“Why, Steven, you asking me to a fisticuffs?” She batted her eyes at him. “You sure you’re up to it after Stark’s workout?”
‘Ok, that should keep him interested for a bit and keep him from text-bombing me during work again.’ Tony started a quick mental checklist and found that as long as the audience was in their place they were ready.
“I can’t seem to stop.” Now he sighed as if in a dreamy state. “He’s such a doll. He’s made me meals, laughs at my jokes, and is so shy and sweet.”
“It was an obsession for a lot. Howard included.” Tony growled to himself and flinched himself out of his temper. “Sorry, you don’t need to hear this.”
“Hey babe.” Tony greeted, pressing his hand on the small of Steve’s back. He smiled to himself as he felt Steve’s posture relax the moment they were back side-by-side.
Steve tried to open his eyes but couldn’t…or were they already opened? He could still see that god-forsaken battle field, of men crying and dying, of those people who lost all hope, of mud and blood, and Bucky shattering into ash and Okoye wailing to the skies as her king disappeared.
Steve stopped at the table, using his shirt to wipe his face of the sweat. Tony, who was gaping at the video in silence, instantly short-circuited at the gorgeous sight of the firm, muscled stomach, the peek of hipbones. and the dusting of soft gold hair trailing down into the jogging pants. Even though he has seen the man naked a few times now, it did not mean he could handle such a sexy motion.
Steve blushed and reached up to gently trace Tony’s beard and forehead. The billionaire closed his eyes and purred at the tender action. “Y-You were amazing too. Are amazing.”
Steve covered his face and sighed but he had a smile on his face. “Don’t you think it’s a bit dangerous to tease me? I’m pretty sure I can break bones.”
“I wasn--” Tony swallowed up the rest of the words. He didn’t care any more about his cute little ramblings. He needed to touch and bruise and mark. “Just a warning, I bite.”
He gave three painful thrusts of his hand, smiling again when Steve flinched. “There you go,” he twisted his hand in a circular motion, back and forth, and held Steve down when he kicked out, his body starting to spazz slightly from the onslaught of sensations again. “That’s it…let me give you everything, Steve. Just take it.”
“And the first person Steve technically saw in over seventy years. Who happens to fly around in a metal suit.” Sam paused. “You showed him that yet?”
Later, when he was back home, and figured that Stane wasn’t aware that the Ten Rings had let it slip his involvement, Tony took his time to slowly ruin the man’s life before, at eighteen when he officially could take over the company, he killed him with his own hands. Slowly, of course. As slow as the Ten Rings had tried to kill him.
“And yet you have said it is a requirement to be spectacularly gorgeous to be part of your group.” Jarvis sounded like he wanted to roll his AI-eyes.
Steve snapped up straighter, his face flushed. “Yes, well, a strange man has literally appeared,” he motioned at him, “out of no where. I think I am entitled to stare.”
Thanos was coming soon for another training session and he needed to be prepared. Tony was apparently needed to some extent but if he did not continue to prove his worth, Thanos would throw him over a cliff like he did his other child.
To be fair, again, Steve never really thought anyone would be on the list—especially this playboy billionaire Steve knew he hurt something fierce.
“I want you in me. I want you to fill me up. I want to carry you everywhere at all times. Please get me pregnant.” He panted. “Put a baby in me, Tony. For the love of god, put a baby in me.”
“Tony has that look that he is about to, stupidly, make a tackle at Thor. Thor, who is just a big dumb puppy, like you, will be excited and tackle him back. Thought it best you don’t get drawn into that yet. Give you at least another day before you need to use those biceps and thighs to get things done…outside of bed.”
Steve woke with a lurch, gasping and coughing as he tried to swat away the last shadows of freezing water.
“Details,” Tony waved him off. “I’ll make changes like that later and get you that penguin-wasteland so Mean Green can have some alone time. But first,” he brushed the international documents to the side and waved a hand over his desk and a light blue screen and keyboard started to glow in front of the group. “I, sadly, have to be boring and keep up with some promises I made.” He sighed dramatically and rubbed his head like a migraine was forming. “They were all so whiny I had to give them something. I’m regretting it now.”
“You murdered the daughter you kidnapped and abused for years after slaughtering her family.” Tony’s eyes were lit with so much hate he could feel himself burning, “As told by your other daughter that you kidnapped and abused and left for dead. Don’t you fucking dare begin to pretend we’re in the same situation.”
“A perfect mess,” Steve grunted, still reeling from the high Tony took him on. “I had hoped to shower after the run.”
“Peggy.” She was slightly older with some gray in her hair and her hips wider. Her eyes were as bright as ever and her smile wide as she pulled a woman close to her. Tony had filled Steve in that a few years after Steve’s death she was transferred to America for a mission where she fell in love with a roommate. She was also Tony’s godmother and had been with him since the day he was born.
"It's not like it's licensed but yep." He gave off an oof when Natasha grabbed his wrist back to continue to look it over. "Rather nice, huh?"
Thanos smiled and Tony wanted to vomit. “If I survived my plan, my hope was to retire to a life of quiet and peace, knowing my heir was protecting everything I worked for…after her death, I concluded not all plans could be perfet and I would only need to destroy the stones to ensure my work remained.”
“He can take as long as he wants.” Tony finally couldn’t stop himself and went over to the table, pressing a few holographic buttons to open up the middle and the shield slowly rises up. He looked over it with longing and contempt. It was such a symbol of what Steve was and what he went through; chipped, weathered, and used. The metal was, of course, holding up, but the slick paint job showed the horrors of war.
“Be still my heart.” Nat pressed her back against Steve’s chest. From the couch, Bruce groaned and buried his face in his hands. Apparently Steve was brattier than he had hoped.
“Oh,” Tony held up his finger as he turned to walk out. “Right. One more thing, Wilson.” He smiled up at him and it was painful to look at; sharp, hungry, and angry. “Don’t argue with me again.”
Tony gave her a weak grin at that and nodded. She was right, of course when was Pepper ever wrong? He had faced so many tribulations, so many horrible, nightmarish things and look and what he molded from them. It had been confirmed for him over and over again that he was strong and better. Now was not a moment to doubt that, now was the moment to show it off.
The final few pictures were of the same woman throughout different ages of her life. She had soft brown skin and hair that in some photos looked dark blond and others brunette. Her eyes were brown and warm. She looked so classy with pearls and high-collared pink dress but her smile did not look snobby or forced, rather it looked truly happy about life.
“Ah,” He tilted his head, eyeing Steve’s form back, hungrily. “Picked up some annoying habits from the old man…a new one.” His fingers went to exposed skin at the hem of Steve’s pants, pushing up the shirt to get a view of the toned tummy and that dip of his hips with the soft trail of golden, almost feather white, hair that went down to a place Tony’s mouth wanted to devour.
“Oh, Tony, you know it wasn’t just your father. It was heavily documented that Steve did all that he could to get on the lines. It was his choice.”
“Talk like that and you will get anything you want.” Tony provided a slow, languid kiss. Their tongues weakly played with each other, his fingers flicking at Steve’s nipples that were unfortunately overlooked during their moment of manic lust. He needed to make up for that once his got his second wind. “Will you call me daddy like that again?”
“I was unaware it was in need of a cleanup.” Steve noted as he opened the door for the group to trail out. “Won’t it be difficult to make the proper fixings with us living in it?”
“I have to say, I really appreciate it. All of this.” Steve heaved a heavy sigh. His chest ached. “I still don’t know what to think about all of it.”
“Hmm,” Tony cupped Steve’s chin and gently brought it up, catching his gaze in something soft—or as soft as a Fae could produce.
“Well, at least you’ve been learning something being around true businessmen.” Pierce cut up his potato and Steve tried not to let his stomach rumble in misery.
Steve gritted his teeth and aggressively pushed his body up and down. Tony perhaps was both the best and worst partner on the healing route. Steve had not faced such overprotectiveness since Bucky. Only Tony felt more overwhelming and powerful. Not to mention the touching and flirting...it just added into the self-disgust and confusion but, God, did Steve want more.
Tony's skin prickled and instantly his shields were up in spades, ready to bounce off all of these words. He should say something nice back. He should apologize right back; say that Steve was not a lab rat. That he was something special. He was good.
"Alrighty," Josh grinned and Steve couldn't help but share it back. "Let's get some more ink on you."
“Yeah, don’t care.” Tony kissed him again. “I think it’s time someone looked after you, don’t you think?”
“Fine, we’ll table that conversation for later.” He just gave the flustered, grumpy face of his Steve a flirty grin. He’ll get another one on the man; Tony was notorious for getting what he wanted. With a kiss on Steve’s forehead, he got himself and the younger man up. “Are you ok?”
"Well, almost." Steve was struggling to breathe and Tony was too close. "We're still catching up. As I said, each line needs to be done many times so...yeah. Almost done though. I'm about to 2019."
“Thought of you…every second. Of you, of our babies, the cabin…” Tony growled, “And now I have you. You’re here and mine and god, you’re perfect.”
“I know you noticed I didn’t say much in what I do with Tony." She waved her fork around a bit, splattering some sauce on the counter, "You gonna press on that or what?”
Turning, Steve gave him the best glare he had in his arsenal, which he felt was not that impressive given the smile that greeted him. Like a lion to a sickly fawn; amused and hungry. Steve tried hard to push that imagery out of his mind. “You believe I’ll have this figured out in the middle of panic and terror.”
And Sam still looked up to the man and the lives he had saved. He had seen war. He had lost people to it. He still believed in the American rights of democracy and freedom but not when it was so poisoned and apathetic. Tony was a cure for that and it was because of his mad methods and technology that Sam’s flight partner survived a crash and went home to his newborn daughter. Tony was monsterous, terrifying, and insane but he was still a hero in Sam's eyes and one who Sam owed a debt to.
“You’d think after so many years, he’d grow used to it.” Tony noted but his tone carried no heat. Besides the new edition of his Steve, Bruce was probably the most sensitive and weak-stomach of the group. Even his new adopted younger brother was taking on the dark side of the business easier than the scientist. “But, he’s been through enough in war-zones. He just needs to be in the back to keep the tools up to par for Nat. No need for him to get queasy or trigger nightmares.”
She gave him the most deadpanned look he’d received in some time (minus everyone in the Avengers that is). Once upon a time, committees and juries would sneer in his direction, thinking him nothing but a spoiled, eccentric man with too much time and money and concern. Amusing to see where those faces were now. Tony, however, was still a smart man despite his success and he knew who not to piss off (Pepper, never piss off Pepper) so he gave her his cutest pout in hopes of forgiveness.
“How often were you sick?” Tony breathed, eyes half-lidded as he reached up to gently caress his face.
Steve looked a little sheepish, “It takes a little bit of time for me to get comfortable and then I can lose my filter. I sometimes do before I think.”
“Don’t hold your breath." Tony laughed. "I actually have free time till Monday. I’m going to get my armor upgraded and catch up on Game of Thrones.”
“I appreciate that. Presently,” his shoulders slumped. “Apologies, but I cannot take your help just yet. I owe a debt to Pierce, one they will prove legal, and I doubt they’ll let me quit anytime soon.”
“An act of good will is what’s necessary. Besides, it’s not like this is my only quick chance at it. Someone is gonna break the treaty again soon enough.” His fingers tapped eagerly on the desk.
Natasha just hiccupped, her breath smelling like garlic and tomatoes, “Make sure Clint’s have loads of cilantro.”
"Hey," Steve greeted as he walked in, shaking off his jacket. He gave a smile to Natasha and Clint, feeling ready to shake their world. He always loved causing trouble whenever he could. Apparently Bucky, who was promptly ignored as usual, sensed stupidity in the works and sauntered over ready to stop Steve from jumping out a window. Again. "Wanna see my tattoo?"
The younger Pierce scowled. “I think we all saw that. Are you looking for father to whip you? He’s on the edge enough as it is and is always looking for reasons to make you bleed.”
Steve didn’t even pause to ask if she was sure and handed over the god. He grinned when Natasha decided she needed to carry Thor bridal style since she did not have the shoulder for the package.
“Replacing humans as the experiments may not go over with some of the public.” Bruce warned. “Nazis or not.”
“What?” Steve could not help but move closer and stare at the metallic, glowing circle protruding from Tony’s chest. “Your heart?”
“In you,” Tony muttered like a madman. “Gonna come in you. Gonna fill you up. Make you full. Make you swell. Yes, fuck, yes, yes…Steve.”
“Great. Another Barton meme coming our way.” Tony then dumped about five scoops of sugar into his mug and then the cream. “You do know your sister watches those videos, right?”
“Ah, yeah,” Bruce shared a weak smile, “Everyone took it a big insult when they found me on my phone watching bento-making videos rather than watch some MMA match.”
Tony blushed, “I can’t believe our first conversation about kids is because I needed to pretend I fucked one into you.”
“That is not some sort of exaggeration. I am being literal. It has become rather customary.” Tony interrupted before Steve could start a rant. “I am no Succubus, but there is something in my blood and power that make people wish for a physical union. Pheromones or some lot that reaches into a human’s primal brain and lets them know I would pleasure them and be a perfect lord and husband.”
“More mercenaries?” Tony rubbed his head. Their usual lack of paper trail could make them more of an annoyance to shift through but the world seriously needed a wake-up call in its nativity if it thought that was the best route to hide from him. He always found his enemies. Always.
Natasha wasted no time and jumped at him, using her smaller body to aim at his face. Steve dodged, stepping back to avoid each swipe of her hands, and reached up to block the attacks. He found blocking with his body and not his shield difficult. He usually just allowed the hits to reach him so he could get the opponent closer and take them down. Not as many could punch hard enough to take him down.
“You just went on and got one by yourself. A loner move for something so team-heavy.” Tony said, his tone growing cold again.
Natasha nodded and then looked back at the envelope in his hand. “I’m surprised as the owners, your employer does not have a copy.”
“I can’t help that you have an ass that’s absolutely magnificent.” Tony glared over at Thor who just threw them, mainly Steve, a charming smile. “And it’s mine, Point Break.”
Steve squinted at the machines, found he could not make out the words, and then back at the room.  A very nice hospital; like one he’d never seen before. He must be back with the team and being used as another experiment with their medical gear.
“Uh,” Steve’s heart was pounding. “I guess it’s a bit late?” He decided to brave the sensations and approach the man. The closer he got the more he saw and the more he realized his boyfriend was not angry in the slightest.
With a quick trip to the bathroom, a splash of water on his face, and his teeth brushed, he came back out feeling rejuvenated.
"I wasn't trying to exclude anyone..." Steve tried. "I just…I was just there and Josh was excited about it--"
He hated to admit it, but Natasha was right to go stereotypical simple horror over his want for a more Bond-theme. The mood was set up and even he found the empty warehouse eerie. With just the final touches, the special movie would truly reach the hearts of the audience.
Steve looked down, his thoughts into overdrive. He had not been prepared for this onslaught when he went after the man.
Steve waved that statement off. He didn’t care about being a hero. “Peggy? Howard? Where is everyone? Are they ok?”
“You crashed the plane, Steve. You saved a lot of people.” Tony’s smile fell a little at that. “And Red Skull is dead. You’re a hero.”
Steve nodded back in gratitude, reading what Sam was offering. It was rather shocking to hear such help from a stranger. Perhaps it was such a difference between the city and country. The treatment of servants was not always taken into consideration—especially when so few spoke up about ill treatment. Money and housing were too important and easy to lose and a few slaps here and there were easy to ignore when there was some access to food.
It was tense in his space. Everyone understood while one battle has ended another was about to begin and it would be long and hard. It did not matter, though. They had done it. He had done it. Nearly twenty-years of hard, dirty, bloody work was accomplished. A world-changing victory. Tony found it giddy and interesting to realize his name was being written in history books as they talked. He and the Avengers would have chapters dedicated to them. How a group of misfits changed the world for the better and now owned it.
“No, no not yet sweetie.” Tony kissed the back of Steve’s hand. “I’m gonna have to make arrangements first.”
“Ma was a nurse. She was so brave and hated being told no…hated hearing other people get put down. She always told me to stand up for anything and everyone I cared for because it was always worth it.” He laughed. “One time she got her nose broken because she would not stand down from a drunkard. She always had a smile for me when I came home limping and bloody. She was just so brave and amazing. She went to the locations no one else wanted to go to. But that was a downfall of hers too, I suppose.” He shrugged meekly. “She eventually got tuberculosis and died when I was sixteen.”
“It was to start a bargaining system. The farmers here do appreciate money but they prefer errands and favors over it.”
“Perfect first date.” For a computer with no tone he sounded so warm and pleased. “I’ll get right on that.”
“Yeah. Apparently it was only a few miles from your location. It must’ve come free of the crash after a few years, global warming or some shit, and bobbed its way north where it froze again.” Tony felt a growl catch his throat. His team had found the Tesseract roughly eight months prior but no matter where they looked they simply couldn’t figure out if Steve was close or not. To think, if he had not been so distracted by his world domination and uncovering the all powerful secrets of the blue box he could have had his Steve far sooner.
“Tony, why do you need this?” Steve finally asked, looking at the arc where the suit seemed to have spawn from.
“Then we won’t speak of it again, Sam. I apologize how upsetting this is to you. But I do thank you for letting me know. I don’t know if Pierce knows of this but I will not speak of it to you again.”
Steve nodded, feeling like he passed a test. “Tony gave me a list and I am going through them. I finished Lord of the Rings last night.” He stuffed his hands in his pockets and cleared his throat when he remembered what happened afterwards. “I-I was told to watch a series called Game of Thrones but…I kind of want more Disney.”
He  desperately tried to grind against Tony’s fingers and cock. He pulled at Tony’s shoulder to whimper against him, “Please, oh god, I need it…you, anything, anything. Please I’ll do anything. Just give me…gimme, please, please. I want…want…oh god, please.”
“Nope.” Natasha grabbed the collar of Bruce’s shirt and dragged him away. “You both are going to party and if that means I need to take you to a corner and ravish you, Banner, to keep your knitting-loving pulse up then, well, that’s a sacrifice I am willing to make.”
“Hush, love.” He growled, he was not sounding quite like himself. “I’ll let you talk soon…let me say all of it. Please…fuck, I’ve held this in for so long. Just finally telling you all of this is…it’s almost euphoric.”
what you’re focused on? The improbable stats?” Tony asked, baffled. “Not a living god, a man who turns green, or a guy that has made…” he motioned around at his lab, “this?”
Jumping off the coach he made his way to the door, still gazing upon his new home. That window was so fascinating. He hoped there was a floor to it so he could look out and take in the sights. Although as black and empty as an inkwell, Steve found himself appreciating that gaping eye into and out of the house.
Steve looked over at him in confusion, looking him up and down, still dressed in casual (but god, so sexy) dark jeans and shirt that left nothing to the imagination with Tony’s muscles. “Really?”
Steve was unable to stop his grin as Bruce yelped, his cheeks flushed. “You don’t…you’re not…stop acting like you have to! You don’t have to do anything!”
“You won’t hear me complaining.” Steve’s fingers pushed through Tony’s thick hair. “I am just a bit surprised in a way…kids…us with kids.”
Steve had enough of the promises and grabbed Tony’s face to kiss him eagerly, hoping to tempt him in completing all these threats. “Do it, do it, oh god do it.”
The man, this infamous Clint, just ignored his leader’s attitude and rushed to Steve, reaching up and grabbing at the face. With a moment of Tony bristling and trying to yank Clint off and Clint just squishing Steve’s cheeks together, Natasha approached the group with an impassive look.
Tony had gazed over Steve briefly. Compared to the rest in the photo he didn’t stand out. He had a shy smile on his face, his body turned to the smirking man and his posture as if he didn’t know what to do with his body. Although he was the tallest in the group and second in bulk, the brunette guy looked thicker in Tony’s opinion, he appeared the smallest. His face was soft. He looked out of place. He wasn’t impressive to a child who loved superhero comics and stories of warrior gods.
“Ok, that’s done.” He looked at the empty sink and full washer with pride. Maybe he could start the laundry and do some dusting. “Jarvis, do you know what time Tony will be home?”
“Wrong.” Wanda paused and dipped her chair back to see if anyone was coming through the door that led into the main building. She saw no one and motioned him closer. “Supposedly, the original family was never quite right…but their son was different. When he became,” she bit her lip and shook her head, “the stories said once he changed, so did everything else.”
“Again, punched a living skull in the face.” Steve looked around, a bit in awe. “This place…it’s amazing.”
“Love it…god…love you, just give me more….please…please I want…oh fuck, Tony.” Steve gasped when Tony’s fingers pressed over the perfect spot. “It’s so good. Tony...
Steve allowed the redhead to maneuver him around and drag him along like a puppy from one point to another. Finally they were on the luxurious, large couch and she had decided he was now her pillow and she slumped up against his shoulders and started to text on her phone. “Gonna make the bastard squirm.”
“Yeah, it was a surprise.” Steve shrugged, remembering a few weeks back when Tony’s very talented mouth decided to say some deliciously inappropriate things that made Steve hit an orgasm out of no where. “But I clearly liked it.”
“Tony.” He corrected. “Sorry. I get distracted easily.” Was it really wrong to want to bury his fingers deep into the blond hair and pull? He did not want to talk about anything anymore. He wanted to press his mouth against those beautiful pink as petal lips and push Steve down and cover him up with his own body. He needed Steve's skin and scent and he was sure he would be so perfect and hot inside.
“Oh no,” Tony laughed, “I am not surprised but that gave me a sense of dread. You going to let me take care of you if you ever get sick?”
He covered up his soon-to-be lover, ensuring he was plenty comfortable. He looked at the broth his moronic minions brought in and sighed. “Yeah, should’ve fed you before any of that.”
"Could not be my heir. I could see it. That fire in his eyes...no, he was good but not the cut desired for this role."
“But look at him, Pepper. Fuck, if he had been captured…” His teeth snapped together and a noise that sounded more animal than man came out of his throat. Steve was a symbol of everything good and pure. He was beautiful and powerful and a message of hope. Had an enemy, especially those as sick as Hydra, had gotten lucky…the things they would’ve done to him…he snarled.
Tony was a sword. He was sharp and penetrating. He was there to hurt and control and ensure a victory.
“I want a Totoro!” Clint cried out, pointing at one of the beautiful pictures of a sketch and a photo of the completed tattoo framed on the wall.
“Yes, but…it’s…” How did he explain this? What this could open up, what questions it would trigger for Steve…the weapons, the wars, the power all in Tony’s hands… “It’s a lot to take in.”
“I’m going to get this confirmed, Tony. Right now it’s just a rumor. But, according to this guest of mine, it looks like there is a sect of Hydra still alive and strong and it’s festering within our government.”
One moment he was blissfully swimming in nothing and the next he was sitting up, panting. His heart was pattering so quickly he worried his ribs would soon crack under the pressure. His skin was covered in goosepimples but he was sweating as if he broke into a fever during the night. There was, however, no sweat staining the sheets yet, as if it had started the moment he found himself awake.
Sam’s throat felt itchy as he said, “In this case, I have to disagree. You’ve talked with him. You know how smart he is. He’s going to figure things out and his trust is delicate. Don’t break it.”
The skeleton of the house looked very normal. Large, a bit odd in the shape of some of the rooms, but nothing to take interest in. He had hoped to perhaps find something secret or anything to connect to this growing mystery but it was simply an old house.
“Uh…” Steve allowed himself to be checked over. They lifted his arms, pried open his mouth, got very close to his eyes…”Uhm…hi?”
Natasha gave him an opening when she made a move to elbow him in the face. Ducking, he shoved his own elbow into her side. He internally apologized when he felt a crack but did not let up. Knew he couldn’t or he’d be beat and in a lot of pain.
“I don’t know…not…I mean,” He tried to keep himself under control. “Again, you have to take into consideration you literally appeared out of no where and you’re squishing me. I am still reeling from that.”
Not his fault that sounded a lot better than a party. Though he would probably request hot chocolate—he found that one of the best things he’s ever had (much to Tony’s, the drinker of hard drinks, amusement). Melted chocolate and milk and warmth; these were things he did not get to have often back in his time and he would enjoy it despite it not being a very adult drink. Tony can shove his coos and sarcasm down his loud-ass mouth.
Tony was stronger, he had a plan for change and revenge, and an idea of suit meant for a god but he found quickly that escaping the cave did not mean much. It drilled holes in his brain and he had nightmares even when he was awake. At first he tried to drown it out with drugs, booze, sexual partners, and his new ploy for dominance and change. He discovered quickly that none of it worked. He finally had to admit he needed help and he got it.
Perhaps if he tried the fantasy could become truth because he wanted Steve as far away from any political or physical battle for the rest of his life. He had already served his country, already died for it, and his duties were over. Tony wanted Steve as an artist, not a solider.
Right now, especially, after waking up what felt like a week since Bucky died only three days since he himself died…finding out the war was over, most everyone he loved was dead, that he was so far in the future…pursuing anything with the man felt wrong.
“Yeah, I have problems. I’ll continue to pay a therapist to deal with that and pay you to enable me.”
“Well then, looks like we may have more people for Nat’s show. Try and find them before the end of the week. But the distribution of the medication and their notes come first.” Tony pursed and tapped his fingers. “Pepper, make the attack public.”
“Well, one of the first things is to get some folks back. Steve told me about Barton. That needs remedy…a man should not lose so much.” With a flick of his wrist the stones came back into view, much to the sickening shock of those in the room. “I’ll get him here and then get his family back. Only fair for him to know…would hate for him to suffer another surprise.”
." He wasn't but he would not let them know that. "I’m sure I’ll be better if I can actually see and experience this new time period. It gives me the shivers to know it’s out there and I’m not allowed to touch it. Like it’s still not quite real.” His voice trailed off as he looked at the wall. It still shocked his system to think that just beyond it was a brand new world for him.
Pickled plum didn't know or understand the half of it. He didn't see there was so much more to Steve than a science experiment.
“Well, just because you asked oh so prettily.” A low voice purred against his ear. “Sleep, little one.”
"It's not and you know it. You know the moment you show it to me I am going to see more of you than anyone else has ever seen. It scares you pissless and, normally, I'd be willing to treat you with some more gentleness but I'm tired of this charade or dance or whatever it is you want us to keep doing. Show me now."
“No,” his eyes grew sharp and he gave Steve a hard stare. “You’re not. You need out of these. Gotta get you into a shower…get you feeling better.”
“Who the hell is telling my innocent angel about this?” Tony grumbled, nuzzling against the younger man.
Tony held true to his word. Steve was brought back to bed and given a meal that was almost too rich for his stomach to handle. He’d never been so stuffed in his life and had to shoo the man away when he kept urging for one more bite to get his strength back.
The dark hair man snorted, “Not everyone. I don’t want everyone to. And it’s your own fault. You’ve probably lost thirty pounds.”
"You little punk...you got one?" Bucky grabbed the wrist, only after Nat was done because she was terrifying, to look it over. He tilted a brow at the Captain. "You're sentimental."
That was right. He had crashed and it was so painful and dark and Peggy had begged him not to do it and Bucky was gone.
She had him taken down after his first swing and if he hadn’t been aware of how drastically he was overestimating his healing properties he would’ve been kneed in the jaw so hard it probably would’ve broken.
“Ok…what is going on?” Clint pushed his sunglasses to the end of his nose to look over his leader and friend. “You’re being far too…I dunno, weird. Too merciful. This was practically planned since the get-go to complete the US's takeover after they make a stupid move. You don't want to do it now? Why?”
A familiar dark anger rushed out of him. He wished there were an efficient way to find all of those associated with that fraction of the Nazis. He would love to put them through the same tortures they put so many others through. He would have them withering in pain and begging for mercy. They would not receive any and Tony would relish that.
“I can’t leave Tony out there. I can’t leave him again.” Steve begged, still refusing to look at his friend.
“Oh, Steve.” He sighed, stalking over to the fallen man, oblivious to the creatures bowing in terror before him. “Of course you tried to get out of bed yourself.”
Tony reached up and wrapped the metal fingers around Steve’s wrist. He leaned over and kissed Steve hungrily, pushing in tongue past lips and teeth, making an animal-like noise of pleasure as he ravished Steve’s mouth. Tony pushed harshly, dominating the moment, and reached behind Steve to cradle his skull delicately. To think, in his suit, he had the power to crush the man without any issue.
He was reaching that crash and with the pace of Tony’s thrusts picking up, he knew the same could be said for him.
His bottom lip trembled and his arms felt so empty. He just wanted to hold him, press his nose against the nape, and feel skin against skin. Even when they were at their worst against each other, just being in the same space and he never felt alone. Steve was the only one who ever sparked something akin to life in him; he was ready and impatient and eager.
"I, unfortunately, have to admit this Josh fellow," he sneered, "has talent in how he can paint your body. This looks beautiful on you."
“Tony,” Steve layered him with such a look, “I punched a man after he peeled the skin off his face and revealed he was literally a talking red skull.”
“People used the terms freely for a while after Hammer’s death…but more and more unusual things continued to happen each time certain words were said. Some people,
Tony pulled away with a sulk and glared at the open elevator doors. “Jarvis, I’m pretty sure that was a sign to pause the elevator.”
"Uh-huh." Steve reached down, holding out his hand for Tony to take. Tony took the moment to pull at the arm hard and spin him over, watching as Steve grunted in surprise and found Iron Man above him, grinning wildly. "Oh."
Tony couldn’t tell if he wanted to laugh, cry, or jump at Steve’s mouth and leave bruises. He quickly dragged Steve to the other half of Tony for a final, proper introduction. “This is how I fly.”
“Little of this and a little of that.” She led him to the kitchen where she instantly began to raid the fridge. “Ooh, spaghetti. Mine now.”
"Beautifully. It still makes me itch I have to get after you about fifteen times a line but it looks like we're being consistent in maintaining the black." He made a gentle wipe before he went back to hovering over the exposed hip with intense focus. "How are we looking for the list? I feel like we gotta be over half-way by now."
“You’re pushing me to locking you up, Steve.” The faux-blond woman snarled. It was odd to not hear her tone calm and in control. “Thor and Carol are both outside, ready to jump in on my word to drag your ass, kicking or unconscious, to whatever holding cell available.”
Tony smiled, his heart melting, “Would it be easier for you if I was sitting and you’re on your knees?”
He gave her a soft thanks and quickly went back up the stairs. He could feel her eyes on the back of his neck as he made his way out and he tried not to let the attention, this sense of study, bother him.
His noise earned muffled sounds from the other side of the door and soon individuals came in…that certainly were NOT Natasha or Nebula.
“Only so many kinks at a time, love.” Steve begged. “Please. I am behaving by not rolling us over and taking care of this myself. I want you to have this moment but I am tempted to do it.”
“I’m thinking by a lake or something. I know Steve…he has some nightmares of drowning but I can tell he would do well at a cabin. Lot of land so he could hide from this world and just go out and have fun. You know, he could chop logs and make his chest bounce or something. Would be good for…” He stopped and a little flush rushed to his cheeks.
‘I can mourn anywhere.’ He had concluded the final time he stood over her simple grave. He had left three flowers upon the flat ground, wishing he could afford more, bowed his head and tried to pray but his mind felt empty of verses.
But Tony remained calm and kept explaining things, showing him things, and answering questions in such a way that Steve grew terrified.
“Steve,” Tony leveled him with a pitiful look. “I’ve wanted to fuck you senseless since we first met.”
“Children,” Bruce sighed. “Let’s try to focus on plans, hm? We’ve had a long day of work and about to have a long night of partying.” His droning voice made it very clear he was not looking forward to that. Clearly, being a ruler did nothing for his lack of a desire for a social-life. Nerd. “I’d appreciate getting all of this done.”
Steve turned his page, realizing he’d been staring at the same one for too long. He brushed over stories of demons and fairies hungry for ignorant human’s greed and moved on to something he found a bit more interesting. He found a section on sirens and focused on them for a bit. Like most, they originated from England but Steve suspected there were more cultures influencing the tales that writers disliked sharing. But regardless of Western racism, it still meant the ghouls and beasts were thousands of miles away from him.
“And that doesn’t deserve some reward? Hell, baby, this martyr syndrome isn’t sitting right with me.”
“Perhaps just a little bit of superstitious. It is an imposing sight.” Steve couldn’t help but give a gentle pat to a doorframe they walked past. “And anytime there is something unknown people tend to jump into interesting conclusions.”
He noticed his arm had some wires on and in it and they connected to a scary looking machine and IV. The screen of the machine beeped in tandem with his heart and there were unusual words on the left side, glowing blue, that crawled up the screen as if the thing was taking notes.
And apparently one Tony Stark had a jealous streak and was not fond of the ideas of someone’s hands on Steve.
“Right, right.” He rubbed his face again and felt exhausted as the panic started to ebb away. He could still feel it there, gnawing at his spine, but its strength was greatly reduced from his friend’s words. “That was a bit stupid of me.”
“You don’t get to say anything.” Tony hissed. “You’re not supposed to be able to flirt. You’re my awkward angel. How dare you use my own power against me? You’re the one who blushes—not me.”
It would be so easy, and was it ever tempting, to press the button and go back up to the safety and warmth of the others. Just leave Tony alone as he clearly wanted and try again another day.
“It’s either bland sarcasm or me talking about pushing my cock into you—” he was smacked again. “Ow!! Stop that!”
Steve opened his mouth and allowed Tony to push three fingers in. He licked, nibbled, and swirled his tongue. He was very aware of a new flavor on the fingers and he liked the idea he could taste the skin of their cocks.
“Shh,” Tony moved closer and stroked Steve’s brow. “You will never have to see it again if you don’t want to.” Tony promised.
“Had to get them drunk to get some information out of them. Earned a chunk of cash though.” He shrugged.
“You never had her loyalty to begin with.” Tony sneered. “You had her fear and her loneliness. Nothing else.” God, he hoped that poor woman was safe. After Thanos just appeared on their brokendown ship and whisked him away, he had no knowledge on what happened to her or where she was. Left alone on a deathrap that was running out of oxygen with no one to call her a winner or teach her how to play rock-paper-scissors.
The doors opened and Tony gently led the soldier in, holding his breath as he found Steve surrounded by the most dangerous and protective gear on earth. Though it meant Steve closer to who Tony was and what the Avengers did, there was something he really liked about Steve seeing so much of Tony…he felt more naked than he did that morning while they were making love.
Steve tried to relax, something told him he should not move too much…there was a viper slithering around him, ready to strike, bite and poison.
“Steven,” Pierce snapped his fingers and Steve hurried to his side. “Here, pay the man and hurry up. The chill is growing and there is much to do before we can take any sort of rest,” the way his lip curled made it seem like he believed no rest will take place, “for the night.”
“As for me, my name is Anthony Stark, though never call me Anthony. I go by Tony. Can you say that?”
no longer finding himself invested in the words. Ghostly encounters and history of savage rituals was probably not the best thing to fill his head with before a new home with strange sounds and nothing but vast lands of no people.
He never could figure out how she afforded it on her measly salary. Nor could he ever figure out where she got it or how. He had yet to touch it. The hairs were still soft and fresh enough despite the years of un-use. Knowing his mother, she had planned on giving him gifts like this for a longer time till he could finally put his creativity on an actual canvas. But it wasn’t meant to be.
Now Steve did laugh at the sight. “There is no doubt about this, your balcony is for sure bigger than my old place.” Already he could make out drastic differences in the skyline from the window alone. “Let me see.”
“Steve,” The man breathed out. The voice was different from Howard's as well. Slightly deeper and rougher.
Quickly, he looked away and back at the growing, dense block of numbers. It trailed down and was about meeting the same point as the gold circle. Just a few more sessions and it would pass it. Steve wondered briefly how long it would be till the block of numbers reached his thigh. Would they continue on till he needed to start from the top on the other side?
, Steven. You’re not like them. You’re special. Not boring…special. And that is so rare to find in your kind. Why would I want that to go into madness?”
have an alliance with Asgard, not them. Feels like a more thorough way to weed out the morons. If anyone is foolish enough to keep coming at me after a little display of your force…well Darwin and all that.”
Why couldn’t he be better? Why did he fail so often and so hard? When it matters most? For Bucky, for Wanda, for Tony.
Steve still could only just stare at the handsome man. It was the most Tony had said to him in weeks.
“I want to draw blood. I want to pin you down with my teeth as I make you take everything.” He licked his lips, his eyes started to take on a dazed look. “I want to make the pleasure hurt.”
“No, the winters here can be a bit harsh. At least I can meet you halfway. You saw the rock we passed by, correct?” At Steve’s nod he continued. “That is a perfect place to meet. I can take you to town and point you in the direction for your supplies.”
The screen crackles to life in his lap, bringing Steve’s attention to a plush couch. A young man in a sharp suit holds a microphone and looks straight at the camera. To the man’s left is an empty cushion’s worth of space, and there, right on the edge of the screen, Steve can see the outline of Tony’s thigh bundled in tailored dress slacks. Would it be weird to say he could recognize the slope of that leg anywhere?
"Well that was fun," Clint announced when it was apparent no one else planned on breaking the silence that had fallen following Thor's departure. He idly wiped his mouth with the back of his hand before standing. "I'm going to bed." Tony watched with an amused smile as Clint stopped in the kitchen to grab a snack on his way out. A snack sounded good right about now. And also some coffee. An entire pot of it.
"More ready than I've been all week," Steve replied. "Speaking of weeks, can you invent something that can give me a week's worth of rest in one night? Because that would be very appreciated right now."
Steve lay back contentedly, tracking the steady decline of Tony's breaths until they evened out into the calm rhythm of slumber. He cozied himself down, curling himself around his husband, and let his eyes fall closed.
Steve slid his arm across Tony's shoulders and smoothly interrupted whatever garbage about to leave the man's mouth. "Tony, are you ready to go in?"
A flash of bright white light emanated from the portal, illuminating the room like a miniature sun, before dissipating just as quickly as it appeared. Left in its wake stood Thor, hair windblown like a surfer on their way home from a good day at the beach. In one hand he held Mjolnir, and in the other was an empty goblet which Thor causally tossed over his shoulder.
Tony nearly cheered when the hallway ended in a staircase leading up. Even a few floors should be enough to reach a level where the frequency would be able to break through the scrambler they'd encountered, and he could use the emergency distress signal sewn into Steve's costume. Losing contact with the tower had been beyond irritating and Tony could imagine the chewing out he'd receive from the rest of the team once they got back in touch.
same room, obviously, but Tony's own little homage to it. He had mixed feelings where Howard was concerned, to put it lightly, but when the decorator had originally asked if Tony had any specific requests for the room... images of his father's office came unbidden: the mahogany desk with the brown leather wingback chair set regally behind it, the overflowing bookshelves, the personal bar in the corner, the landscape art prints his mother had picked out at various estate sales and charity auctions. Tony had said the words aloud, describing his memories without even realizing he was doing it. The end result left him with a sense of closure, somehow, so he'd kept it this way ever since.
“Bruce recommended the books, Clint forced me to watch the musicals.” Steve spread his hands casually, as if this wasn’t some mind-blowing information. “I had a lot of time to kill.”
Steve yawned loudly, like the word sleep had triggered an irresistible impulse. “Okay,” he murmured. “Goodnight, Tony.”
Tony pushed away from his bank of computers, spinning his chair idly in the empty space. His foot knocked over an errant can of compressed air when he stopped abruptly at the sound of footsteps. He glanced toward the doorway to see Steve in his usual sleepshirt and loose sweatpants. The man’s eyes were bright as ever, but Tony could read the hope in them as easily as he could read HTML coding.
Steve couldn’t help but laugh at their antics, wisely deciding to not scroll up further and see what else could possibly be lurking since they apparently had seen the interview themselves.
He'd just finished plating the food when JARVIS alerted him that Tony would arrive in a few minutes. Looking down at it, Steve felt it wasn't that bad.
Thor looked from Tony to where Steve sat on his haunches, with teeth no longer bared but a piercing stare pinned on the god. “Ah, yes. I should apologize to you, dear Captain.” He went to his knees, reaching out a hand toward Steve in an amiable gesture. The wolf sniffed cautiously, then bit Thor’s thumb before swinging its head in the opposite direction. An obvious dismissal, if Tony had ever seen one. And he’d seen plenty.

From this vantage point he could only see half of Steve's face, but that didn't keep Tony from staring. The blue of his eye reflected the light in a way that reminded Tony of the ocean.
“You’re right,” Steve replied. “I take full responsibility. Is there anything I could do for you? A hot drink maybe? Or some dry clothes?”
Then he heard… something. A gentle rasping, or maybe something scratching? Tony sat up, his eyes drifting over the room in order to locate the source of the noise.
