Tony sighed. “You know, Steve, my whole life has been very lonely. I was always very careful that no one noticed, so that what people knew about me was the image of the carefree billionaire playboy, who, after a moment of clarity, decided to use his spare time and money to be a superhero, inside a shining armor.”
"You are invited to Steve Rogers’ birthday, Fourth of July, at the Avengers Tower, at eight o'clock," Tony read aloud, "Come and help us make the best 100-year party someone could have," Tony laughed.
Tony laughed through his nose. “Yeah, maybe. But this is what I want people out there to know about me. It’s worked very well. They continue to believe. But the truth?” Steve nodded in agreement. Tony smiled. “The truth is that I was always just a guy, alone, walking along a long and lonely road. I’ve walked fast, I’ve been very slow. I reached the rock bottom of my life and came back bigger than the world ever thought to see me. I’ve given up hope and I’ve been bright light. Because, deep down, I always thought that, in the end, everything would always be the same, that everything would end the same.”
Something was going on there, but Steve didn't have time for that. Not at that moment. Now, he had more important things. Much more important things.
Suddenly feeling fearless, Steve laid on the floor, his own cock hard and heavy on his belly, twitching in anticipation, and smirked. “Why don't you come over here and find out?”
” Steve looked around, as if the lab was a completely new and unknown place. “There's one last smell here, but I can't quite tell for sure what it is.” He looked up at Tony, seeking for confirmation. Tony shrugged and smiled.
Tony let the weight of his body fall slowly on Steve, who didn’t protest, and slid his hand under the pillow to entwine his fingers on the soldier’s, who smiled.
were desperate.” Steve was already losing his patience with the zippers and had already started to tear the invisible seams.
Steve obeyed and carefully added another finger and started scissoring Tony’s hole, slowly, calmly, devotionally almost. Then, suddenly, he found Tony’s prostate and Tony cried out. “Yes! Oh, yes, Steve. Right there, sweetheart!” Steve massaged that spot for a few more seconds, reveling in the way Tony’s body writhed under his fingers, the pet names, the way Tony’s body glowed.
“Everything I wanted most when I saw you that day,” Steve continued, his voice stronger, more confident. “Was to come to you and say that I wanted that fight to end. The problem is that, at the time, we both wanted it, but on our terms. The War blinded us. We talked and talked and talked.” Steve sighed. “We walked through the mansion’s gardens and, after I told you why I thought I was right, you told me that I was a blind man who never saw how inadequate everyone has always been around me. How
Steve came into the lab carrying the tray with what Tony thought it was supposed to be his dinner. Steve’s expression was serious with a frown of concern. He scanned the lab with his eyes until they found Tony on the floor.
"The basics I learned from my mother when I was little. I think she knew how important it was that I knew how to do a little about everything,” Steve lifted his fork and ate the piece of steak, savoring it. “After leaving the ice I took the free time to try new things and here we are.”
“I’m really glad you made it back.” Tony ended up saying, even though it was a silly and generic phrase, that didn’t even begin to express the flood of feelings inside him.
"Hey, can we think about it when we get back?" He ran his free fingers by Steve's soft hair. "Only happy thoughts this weekend, okay?"
His heart was beating in slow motion, waiting. And then, Steve opened the most beautiful shy smile Tony had ever seen.
“Well, one simple way of saying it is: two Earth planets, of different dimensions, go on a collision course. One of them will survive the impact. The other won't.”
"Tell Peter we’re home and ask him to come up. Delete all the emails. Begin the tests with the stabilizer.”
His body immediately lit up at the thought of Steve. Steve, whom he had left miles away, when the two had finally admitted to each other what they felt, when they could finally begin to live the love that had always existed between them. It was so unfair.
What Natasha knew was that she needed to know more about that girl, to know what questions to ask herself to get rid of those suspicions. It wasn’t possible, right? No one has ever been able to prove anything remotely alike... She shook her head to clear her thoughts.
Steve held Tony in his arms for what seemed like forever, but Tony didn’t care. He was getting drunk on Steve’s scent, concentrated and potent, awakening Tony’s most incredible feelings of love - and possession, too. Steve loved him. Until the end. They were now each other’s, forever, to support, help, care for, to love. Tony tightened his arms around Steve’s waist.
Steve took a deep breath. “I can't do what you asked me because it'd be wrong. You were poisoned by that thing and now you're obsessed with the idea that we need to ...
Steve wet his lips, still unsure of what to say, unable to take his eyes off the beauty that was Tony. All of him, not just a part. It was mesmerizing. “I see you.” Steve ended up saying, in a distant, dreamy voice. “And I love you whole.”
Tony opened and closed his mouth sometimes, unable to decide what to say. Finally, he said the most intelligent one: “What?”
“I kept thinking about everything we’ve ever lived through, you know,” Steve said. “So many battles won and lost together, so many sleepless nights thinking about strategies or just talking, movie and game nights with our friends, and I couldn’t understand when we had lost each other.” Tony watched Steve run his fingers through his hair in frustration. “But there came a time when I knew we needed to talk, that I thought I had all the answers to our problems. I was very arrogant, I know, to think I knew everything. But then, you suggested a truce to talk and that was all I needed. And I went. But I didn’t think about what I was doing, because when I arrived at the mansion that day, when I saw you, without armor, just being you, open, vulnerable, I forgot everything because I wasn’t ready
"No one can deny that, darling." Tony smiled the most beautiful of smiles, and Steve swore to himself that he would make Tony smile like that every day.
Tony knew he was there for strictly professional reasons and that it'd be extremely unethical of him to say anything but Peter's case. But he wasn't blind. And definitely not straight. There was no way to be indifferent to a handsome man like Steve and not allow himself to steal a few looks. Tony knew that he'd never, even under other circumstances, stand a chance with Steve. He had already been married to a woman and had a child with her. Not that it was any kind of a sentence, but Tony could feel that him and Steve would be nothing more than colleagues in this situation and after it was over, they would never see each other again.
“Bareback, then.” Tony grabbed a nipple in each hand and twisted a little, just to make Steve moan. He positioned Steve aligned to his entrance, and, slowly, impaled himself on his throbbing cock.
They were really annoying mosquitoes, which stung and stung without mercy, and each question hurt like Steve's skin was raw. But he remained unyielding, always looking ahead, at Tony's back, with his face impassive, maintaining his best poker face. Until finally -
“Maybe,” he thought better and completed. “Perhaps the link that bound her to our versions of the other dimension was so strong that it overcame that barrier and came down to us somehow. Maybe, instinctively, we already knew her, but not in person. Can you understand?” He made a lovely grimace.
"My paradise is you, my love," Steve smiled and Tony thought he had never seen so much love on someone's face. Even less directed at him. “Wherever you are, then I'll be the happiest man in the world.”
“There is only one, actually, but it is extremely important.” Strange showed the box and Tony had to admit it, it was a very nice box. Golden, full of runes and surrounded by complex arabesques.
Then Tony felt wrapped in a pair of arms, which wrapped around him knowing that they wouldn’t be pushed aside. On the contrary, they were very necessary. It was a warm, soft and firm haven, able to protect him from all dangers, even those that Tony created for himself, steadying him to reality, bringing him back, comforting him. He didn’t deserve that. The smell of clean clothes and Steve, the scent that only he had, permeated Tony’s senses, making him dizzy, thirsty and with a racing heart. He was hyper alert, about to explode, and having such a concentrated dose of Steve at that moment could lead to unexpected and dangerous reactions.
Even though he didn’t remember what actually had happened, even though he had been told everything that happened the day he erased his memory, Tony knew what he most likely had felt. He was still him, only with a piece of his mind missing. It was frustrating, but he did his best to find the most accurate description possible of his own feelings to tell Steve. “Redemption, perhaps? To make sure that your death was not in vain? After all, you died after fighting that stupid Act. And look where it had taken us. Everyone was now seeing that the Act wasn’t the solution, everyone realized that you weren’t the villain of the story, the
“This is a private service, Mr. Stark. For you only.” Steve smiled. “So, would you mind letting me in here?” Steve touched Tony’s forehead with his finger again.
Tony and Steve got out of the car, grabbed their suitcases in the trunk, and walked to the plane. Tony stood with one foot on the first step of the ladder.
Tony climbed on the bed, crawling between Steve’s legs, without looking away. “I’m not planning anything, darling,” Tony rested his hands on either side of Steve, trapping him between Tony and the mattress, and stole a kiss. As Tony walked away, he sat on Steve’s lap, hugging him with his legs. “I’m just living the two of us.” Tony twined his fingers in Steve’s hair and pulled his head back, exposing his neck, to where Tony hurriedly bent down to lick from base to ear, feeling the skin crawl, coming back the same way with kisses and bites, getting more and more courageous with Steve’s loudest moans.
"I love my aunt, but I also love staying here," he started to walk away toward the elevator. “I'm already going to my room.”
A few seconds later, two flying motorcycles emerged from openings on the hangar floor and turned on immediately.
Steve rested his head on Tony’s and they shared the same air. They kissed deeply and Tony allowed himself to enjoy the electricity running through his body. Steve’s lips were warm and soft, sticking Tony to the present, reaffirming that it looked like a dream, but incredibly it was happening. His body was a fortress. That body belonged to Tony’s love. Steve
Tony dismissed the warning with a gesture. “Yeah, yeah. That too.” He and Strange stared at each other for a long moment. “Is that all, Doctor? Or would you like to owe me one more favor?” Tony smiled wickedly.
Steve pushed some more, until he was whole inside Tony, and then stopped again, because the feeling was overwhelming, indescribable, it was so incredible, and they both groaned loudly. Tony rolled his eyes and was breathless for a few moments. It was a suffocating sensation of pure contentment to feel Steve inside him. Feeling that completeness was something Tony had never even imagined possible because he never imagined himself to be so incomplete, not until that moment, when he finally found the missing part. The last piece of the puzzle. The perfect fit.
“There's an extremely rare, valuable ingredient with a level of power that is beyond your understanding in there.”
Tony was taken out of his daydreams by an alert message flashing on his display, warning of someone approaching. When he looked to see who it was, his heart filled and Tony found himself smiling. Steve was on the roof again, like the night before, still looking calm, peaceful, but something about him didn’t feel right. Tony zoomed over Steve’s face and felt his chest tighten. Steve had a melancholic look in his eyes, which he rarely allowed himself to have, after all, the great and powerful leader of the Avengers can’t show weaknesses. But there, alone on the roof of his apartment, on a cold and empty night, Steve allowed himself to let all those repressed feelings arise and Tony fought the urge to go there and hug him until nothing worse was left. Steve walked to the outside wall of the apartment on the roof, spread a blanket on the snow-covered floor, sat down and leaned his head against the brick wall behind him to look at the misty sky, with the overcast moon, appearing here and there. Tony saw him sigh.
They moved far away enough for Tony to finish taking off Steve’s shirt and Tony took a little break to admire the man in front of him, the man he loved, and who, surprisingly, loved him back. He reached out and touched Steve’s torso slowly, gently, learning how each of those lines behaved under his fingers, how Steve reacted to his touch, what sounds he made, which places produced the softest sighs, the deepest moans. Steve waited patiently, even though he was breathing hard, his hands holding Tony around the waist, admiring Tony’s reconnaissance work.
“Thank you.” Steve smiled that smile that made his eyes narrow, making the corners crinkle. It was sincere.
Peter shrugged. "It was time for another adult to show up to talk to my dad. He’s been very lonely since my mom died, but he tries to pretend not to. But I have eyes, Mr. Stark. I know he needs friends who aren’t his teenager son."
Tony laughed through his nose. “Yeah, maybe. But this is what I want people out there to know about me. It’s worked very well. They continue to believe. But the truth?” Steve nodded in agreement. Tony smiled. “The truth is that I was always just a guy, alone, walking along a long and lonely road. I’ve walked fast, I’ve been very slow. I reached the rock bottom of my life and came back bigger than the world ever thought to see me. I’ve given up hope and I’ve been bright light. Because, deep down, I always thought that, in the end, everything would always be the same, that everything would end the same.”
As soon as the quinjet landed, Tony was the first to leave, heading straight to the lab without speaking to anyone. The rest of the team split: Clint, Hulk, and Natasha went to their rooms and Steve, Peter, and Sam went into the kitchen.
Stepping hard, Clint approached the other three Avengers, backed by Sam, and alternated his gaze between Natasha and the girl, as if in a tennis play.
Tony opened his saddest smile and he saw how his expression affected Steve, who frowned and opened and closed his hand on the kitchen island, as if, for a moment, he wanted to reach Tony, but he had changed his mind. Tony nodded. “Yes, I chose it. I
to reach out and take it. Tony couldn’t just have told his biggest secret, opened his heart to the person he loved and trusted most, and whom he had hurt the most, and in return to receive that smile, to get that feeling back. It didn’t seem right to have done so many horrible things, even though thinking they were right, and still be rewarded with all Steve Rogers’ affection and attention. Steve should push Tony away, say how much he despised Tony for everything, for the horrible human being he was and had been able to become.
Steve shrugged. “It’s no longer such a problem. It was worse in the first days. I couldn’t sleep, afraid of not waking up anymore, afraid of seeing myself trapped in that infinite again.”
Slowly, Steve licked Tony's length, like he was the best popsicle in the world, going up and down, sucking the balls with patience, making the cock grow harder and harder, and coming back to pay attention to the head, now leaking precome, which Steve licked almost with devotion.
Tony’s groans went up in pitch, then with a yelp, he collapsed just as his come splattered onto Steve’s chest and the lab’s floor. His body was spasming so much that Steve could totally feel his orgasm inside him. That was enough for Steve too. Tony had come on his cock. And that wasn’t a dream; that happened for real. He gave Tony a couple more thrusts, then blew his own load inside Tony with a strangled groan.
Tony frowned. What question was that? Why was Steve asking that? It didn’t make sense. Everyone knew he didn’t remember everything ... Then a light went on in Tony’s head.
“You’ll never be lonely again, my love,” Tony said, taking the tube of lube. He put some in one hand, and with the other he tossed the condom away. “We don’t need this,” he answered Steve’s confused look. “You’re the super soldier who doesn’t get sick. And I’m cleaner than someone who was quarantined.”
“Everything I wanted most when I saw you that day,” Steve continued, his voice stronger, more confident. “Was to come to you and say that I wanted that fight to end. The problem is that, at the time, we both wanted it, but on our terms. The War blinded us. We talked and talked and talked.” Steve sighed. “We walked through the mansion’s gardens and, after I told you why I thought I was right, you told me that I was a blind man who never saw how inadequate everyone has always been around me. How
"The detective who handled the case from the start was waiting for a transfer to Maine to be closer to his family," Rhodes explained. "His wife had gotten a better job over there and Ross helped him getting there too. He left to Maine and left his last case open, and
“Tony,” Steve called. Tony focused on him. “You were the first to speak to me and introduce me to the world. You gave me a home when I woke up in this century. You were my safe haven. Let me do the same for you. Let me show you how I see you, let me be your safe haven.” Steve held his hand out to Tony, his eyes shining with hope and feeling.
But it was impossible not to let sleep come when he was hugging the best pillow in the world, with the most incredible and mesmerizing scent Tony had ever felt in his life and which, by a happy coincidence, was also the love of his life.
“No need to ask twice,” the engineer approached the weapon's control panel and his fingers instinctively flew across the keyboard, searching for loopholes in the system.
That gave hope to the soldier. He knew those feelings, knew what it felt like to feel alone in the world. Maybe that was the breach he was looking for to approach his daughter.
What was he talking about? How come you weren’t ready for me? Curiosity won in the end, and Tony turned to face Steve. Their eyes met and Tony saw that Steve’s eyes lit up when Tony turned.
him, even if at a distance and that that person happened to be someone who had gone to war with you, told you several lies, manipulated you, tried to kill you and, in the end, lost all memory about it trying to save what’s left of the friendship between you. An unsolicited and not well-liked guardian angel.
Tony Stark ... I never thought I'd see you at my station. You came prepared for everything, Captain," Ross raised an eyebrow.
Tony rummaged through the crowd and found the spy still talking to Bucky, but now sitting on the couch in the middle of the penthouse. He left the bar and went straight to Natasha, who smiled when she saw him.
She needed confirmation. She needed to know it was true, even though she knew there was only one way that girl could have endured a fight against Thor and Vision for so long.
He set the tray on the nightstand beside the bed, climbed up onto the mattress, and crawled to one leg on either side of Steve's sleeping body. Tony leaned on his hands and bent down to kiss the base of the soldier's back and didn’t stop with the trail of passionate kisses until he reached his neck when Steve finally moved beneath him and smiled without opening his eyes.
Tony looked out the small oval window and could see the mesmerizing blue immensity of the Atlantic Ocean beneath them.
Tony was looking at the cell phone, and even though Natasha couldn’t see him, he raised his hands apologetically.
Tony looked away and Steve could see that he was putting the pieces of the puzzle together, making the gears of that brilliant brain work. “So you knew all along that the serum wouldn’t let you be infected?”
Tony’s brain was full of cotton. He was numb with that whole statement. Steve saw him as a lifeguard. Steve saw Tony as Tony saw Steve. How was that possible? It didn’t feel right. Steve was the safe haven there, not Tony. Tony was the Bermuda Triangle, sucking everything and everyone around into chaos. He couldn’t be the beacon that led to safety. Tony’s heart was racing, responding for him, propelling him forward, but his legs were still frozen. Something was still missing ...
Tony repeated. “If it happened all the time it wouldn't be so exciting when it comes. The excitement comes from waiting, from expectation.” Nat ended, looking deep into Tony's eyes.
, was what Tony wanted to ask, but he was too moved. Steve was alive and was talking to him. Hearing his voice again, in person, and not on a recording, was like an extracorporeal experience. Tony felt out of orbit. He waited so long to hear Steve again, and now that he finally had the chance, all he could do was hide in his invisible armor and cry. Steve was saying Tony’s name out loud again. It was almost too much to take.
or not Tony would decide to come in to see and talk to Steve, but when. And Steve would wait, because that was what he did. Steve was waiting for Tony. It has always been like that.
“Come here.” Steve pulled Tony into a hug. “I help you with what you need, my love. I love you, remember?”
“Is that really possible?” Steve asked Tony, but the engineer said nothing. Indeed, he, Bruce, and Reed Richards always worked on the hypothesis that other dimensions might exist, but the possibilities were extremely remote, since none of them could ever prove this theory. So far.
It didn't take long for Tony to hear footsteps coming down the stairs next to the kitchen, and soon Steve appeared, looking not exactly better, but more cheerful. Tony was in the middle of a sip of water and took the opportunity to take a quick look. Steve was a gorgeous man. No, scratch that. Steve was an
But Tony actually answered the call, without fear this time, because Steve was on the other side, waiting to hold him and take care of him.
"What I did was my problem, Thor. Now do not be gentle and compel me to take your Land, for I will love to take it as my war spoil.” The god smiled wickedly.
"I know it wasn't him. But his DNA at the crime scene complicates things, Steve. That's why I sent you the best lawyer I know. One of the best in the country. Talk to him, listen to what he has to say. He has experience in complex cases. And he promised me that he will stay as long as he needs."
Liz swallowed hard and Natasha realized that it was painful for her. Something very serious was about to come out and something that had hurt that girl a lot.
“It was lying on the kitchen floor. I thought I could find a use for it." He stuck the eggs in his mouth and smiled mouthful.
“This is a private service, Mr. Stark. For you only.” Steve smiled. “So, would you mind letting me in here?” Steve touched Tony’s forehead with his finger again.
"But here’s the thing, Rhodes," Tony said. "Natasha told me on the phone that her godson's DNA was planted at the crime scene and, even if she hadn't told me about it, let's call it her
"Sorry." He cleared his throat and straightened his back, but he didn’t shrug his legs. "I distracted myself.”
"They have already worked together, Rhodes. He let out that he met her during a secret mission on which they worked together, but it was all classified."
“Thanks.” Steve smiled and took a step forward, a tiny step, but enough to keep them so close that Tony could count the green spots that mixed with the blue of his eyes. “But why do I have a feeling you’re not telling me the whole truth?” Steve slid his hands down Tony’s arm and his warm hands found Tony’s, which were freezing. The contrast made Tony shiver.
With a savage grunt, Steve went over to Tony and kissed him hard, without holding on, letting everything he had kept inside him, every year loving from a long distance, the frustration for the War that he fought for the principles he swore to protect, but that went against protecting the person he loved the most, for them finally having the courage to reveal their feelings for each other, all that, that whole dam had finally burst and nothing would be able to hold it back. Steve hooked his fingers into Tony’s underwear and slid it down Tony’s muscular, shapely legs, and felt his mouth water as he watched how Tony’s cock was already ready for him.
“Why can’t they ever choose a paradise beach in the Philippines? Or in the Caribbean?” Clint commented frowning at his tablet. Fury ignored him.
"Steve, dear. I have my contacts," he could hear a condescending smile in her voice. "And that's why you called me, wasn't it?"
Suddenly, making his heart reach his mouth and return to its place, and almost dropping the mug, Tony felt an arm wrap around his waist and a mouth kiss the side of his head. “Good morning.”
Steve laughed. "That's right," he turned and bent down to get a mold from the bottom cupboard, and Tony almost choked when he was hit by the glorious sight of Steve's ass turned to him. Tony could get used to that sight.
Steve nodded and they walked into the compound through one of the side doors of the hangar, heading toward the elevator down the hall. Inside, Steve pressed the button of the basement and, silently, the doors closed and the elevator began to descend. Neither of them said anything. Ten seconds later, the doors opened with a plim! and the two Avengers went out into another corridor, headed to the right, and entered the second door, into a small, dark room with two chairs facing the right wall that was covered with glass to see the other room, but that, for now, was blocked by the other side, most likely by Natasha, who did not want to spoil the surprise before the time.
Please, I-I...” Steve was a mess of beautifully incongruence and Tony kept teasing his entrance. Without warning, he slipped one finger inside Steve, making the soldier throw his head back and open his mouth in a silent cry. Tony thrusted his finger a few times and then added the second, never stopping jerking Steve's cock.
Without loosening his mouth, Tony came down, slowly swallowing all Steve's length, until he felt it touch the back of his throat. Steve moaned loudly. Tony came back to the beginning and, with the help of his hand, began to suck Steve as if the world were about to end and that was his only salvation.
Tony smiled, he himself excited by the boy's excitement. "As tempting as the offer is, you’re already being accused of one crime. We don't want you to be accused of another, right?" Tony saw Peter's expression wither and he felt terrible. "Look, I know you really want to help solve your own case, but the best thing for you now is to be quiet at home, without making a fuss, okay?"
Without saying anything, Tony sat down and started opening the button on Steve’s pants. “In a hurry, Stark?” Steve asked with a breathless laugh.
"The torture has not yet begun,” without giving Tony time to process what was happening, Steve bent down and involved Tony's cock with his mouth and sucked.
"Now I'm going to talk to some people, search some files and see what I can find out until the date of your trial is announced."
You make me infinitely happy, and you make me complete because you let me see who you really are. In the crowd, your smiles are always bright and calculated. But I’m the only one who has the privilege of seeing your real smiles, the ones that reach your eyes, that make you shine all over. And I’m the only one for whom you let your tears show, without fear of being vulnerable, because you know that I’ll take each one as a gift of your trust in me and take care of you, forever. I’m the one who sees behind the perfect shell, because I love your imperfections.
But Tony's heart never slowed when Steve was around since he was a kid when his father told him the stories of the great Captain America and things only got worse when Tony met the real Captain, the man behind mask, Steve Rogers, the most amiable, intelligent, witty, righteous and strong man who ever lived.
In the other room, sitting on one side of a steel table with her back to them, was Natasha, and facing her was a girl, a little older than Peter, blonde, wearing jeans, a blue T-shirt and a red jacket, with hands on his lap and looking down. Nothing that seemed very disturbing or alarming.
"Do you think the Wolmurs might have something to do with this?" Peter's eyes were wide. "But they left the city."
Tony stopped laughing and looked at him on the other side of the island. Steve was serious again and Tony felt a cold chill run through his entire body. But it wasn’t the good kind of shiver. Suddenly, all of Tony’s senses were alert.
"You know," Tony said after swallowing. "It's a blessing and a curse that discretion is not your thing."
"That would be great if there was no one else here so you could finish that kiss trail," Tony smiled crookedly.
That was the scent that Tony couldn't identify when he smelled the flower earlier. It was a familiar scent, of course, but Tony didn't allow himself to focus on it that much. Steve would never reciprocate Tony's feelings. He deserved better.
happy. I don’t know when you decided that happiness was something unattainable for you, but it’s not true. And you, more than anyone in this world, know that I have flaws. We caused a war because of these flaws, Tony.” Steve took the last step. “I’d do anything to convince you that you’re worth all the effort, that you’re worthy of all happiness, but words will never be able to convince you. Let me be with you, then, to prove, day after day, how much you mean to me. How much I love you.”
Steve smiled. “First, I’m stopping pretending that I don’t want you, that I don’t desire you, that I don’t want to start my life over with and for you. You only need to say yes, that we start.”
“Damn it, Banner.” Barton looked darkly at Bruce, adjusted the volume of his hearing aids, and his face became a little calmer.
"I've had a beard almost as long as Thor's waiting for you," Clint complained. "What were you whispering there?"
But common sense spoke louder and Tony found himself pulling away and getting out of bed, heading toward the bedroom bathroom. There, he took a clean towel, dipped it in the sink faucet, and returned to the room. He climbed onto the bed, sitting on his heels beside Steve.
“I do,” she said quickly. “I have nowhere else to go and I need help understanding how things work around here, even if everything looks very similar.”
"We were so close. And we didn’t wake anyone.” And knowing it was a low blow, he bit his lower lip and stared at Steve, who swallowed.
“I wish there was something I could say to you that day,” Steve said, his eyes glued to Tony, holding Tony in place. “I wish I could have said something that would make all that pain you let me see go away. It kills me a little every day, since that meeting, to know how you can feel this way, so worthless, so small, so
Steve smiled at him and stretched his hand toward the engineer, who released his armor to entwine his fingers with his husband's. Since Thanos had wiped out half the universe, one thing had become very clear to Tony: he loved Steve Rogers. It was something he could no longer deny or try to hide behind other relationships (poor Pepper, she endured for a long time, Tony had to acknowledge her effort) and he had almost lost him forever. Fortunately, Steve survived and they were able, with the remainder of the original Avengers and other surviving heroes, defeating Thanos and restore life in the universe. After such an unimaginably large task, they deserved to be happy, right? Thanks to Odin, Steve thought the same and better, he felt the same. A few months after the last battle against the Mad Titan, the two were married and Tony couldn’t imagine himself more complete. He was taken from his thoughts by Steve's voice.
Looking at it like that, it seems that Tony was there that day, witnessing everything up close, in order to remember so many details. Unfortunately, that day, he was being too stupid, too arrogant, too stubborn and too afraid to leave the SHIELD helicarrier to face his friend. No. Scratch that. To face his ex-friend on his way to his trial for treason. At that time, Tony was becoming familiar with the position of director of SHIELD and being too cool as the leader of the winning side to bother to go to the trial. Besides, it would be too much cowardice to rub his victory in Steve’s face at a time like that, right?
Natasha then took the main deck again, discarded the first card from the top and opened three cards in the center of the table, a three of spades, a three of hearts and a ten of diamonds. Tony looked back at his two opening cards and cheered a little. With his three of diamonds plus three of spades and the three of hearts open at the table, he already had a three of a kind.
“The outside has been assembled with parts from Hydra and Hammer Industries, I imagine for strength and stability,” Friday said. “The rest of the internal technology is A.I.M.'s used to amplify the power of the reactor.”
“Steve, we’re sticky and I have a layer of cum on me. As exciting and sexy as that may sound,” Tony turned and faced Steve. “Right now, the prospect of taking a shower with you and seeing how all of this here goes.” Tony pointed to Steve's gloriously naked body “With the water running over it is much, much more interesting. Besides, we need it a lot, darling. We’re disgusting like that.”
That was what Tony wanted to shout. That wasn’t possible. Steve remembered everything, right? No one had erased his memory.
“And why didn’t that make the front page of newspapers?” Steve asked and Tony cringed when he heard the acidity in his voice. Steve was disappointed. No. Disappointed was an understatement. Steve was hurt, and Tony agreed with him, but he just couldn’t feel the remorse he should have. The memories that were supposed to make that happen weren’t there.
Tony took Steve’s cock out of his mouth with an obscene plop that gave Steve a shiver and looked at him through his lashes. “Come for me.”
"And what if we get there, and when finally it's just the two of us, without any distraction, he realizes I'm a mistake?" Tony swallowed and felt his throat hurt with the lump that was forming.
Tony was already half-hard and he just wanted the time to stop, the world to stop, the universe to stop, and only he and Steve to remain.
But all of Tony's incoherent thoughts silenced when Steve wrapped his cock with his huge, warm hand and slowly, started thrusting his length up and down.
“Peter missed the final tests because Spider-Man was on a mission with the Avengers. But Peter Parker was hospitalized because of a pneumonia. I myself took the certificates signed by the hospital doctors to the school to get Peter to take the tests at a later date.”
"As you told me many years ago," Steve said in a low but amused tone, just for Tony. "You're a genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist," he smiled the brightest smile Tony had ever seen. “Insensitive wasn’t on the list and I don’t think it’s ever been.”
“So, what I was told is true?” Steve asked, his eyes shining in a new way that Tony had never seen before.
“Well, we hope everything went well in the Multiverse,” Tony said, evasively. “But we need to go now,
Tony didn’t know what to think. His brain flew, millions of thoughts at the same time, trying to fit into coherent reasoning. Steve was talking about what? Was he talking about the Civil War? Or was he talking about something else that Tony wasn’t told and that he should know?
, would be enough for Steve to forget everything they had lived. Tony didn’t remember anything. Everything he remembered had been told to him. He didn’t remember what he had felt when he and Steve last met. He didn’t even remember his last thought when they last spoke. Tony didn’t remember when Steve had smiled at him the last time, or when they had fought together for the same cause the last time. Tony didn’t even remember what he felt when he last saw Steve. And that ate him alive. All his memories were second-hand, borrowed from people who didn't delete their own memories in a last attempt at redemption. In one last attempt to make Steve proud.
“You’re not speaking for yourself, Tony.” Steve’s eyes were pained. “It’s the flower that’s making you act and speak like this.”
Tony felt his chest ache when he saw the shield against the door, strategically positioned. The last time he had seen that shiny disk had been a lifetime ago, a life that no longer belonged to him, when he visited Steve’s dead body.
Tony tried to sound as unconcerned as he could and only allowed himself to let the air out and stop smiling when Steve was already at the top of the stairs.
"I need to tell Steve!" Tony said on the way to the bathroom, to brush his teeth and take a quick shower. After changing, with a clean suit, combed hair and a neatly knotted tie, Tony left the room excited, eager to tell Steve the news. But when Tony reached the kitchen, he came across a note from Steve, telling him that he had gone for a run, but that he shouldn't be long. Run, huh? Well, Tony had to admit that that whole shape shouldn't be coming from nowhere, and that running should help, but what a horrible time for Steve not to be home. Tony went to the coffee maker and poured himself some coffee. It was at the ideal temperature and Tony was delighted with the bitter taste of coffee. And, God bless caffeine, his brilliant brain had an idea.
What was he talking about? How come you weren’t ready for me? Curiosity won in the end, and Tony turned to face Steve. Their eyes met and Tony saw that Steve’s eyes lit up when Tony turned.
"Well, children, I warned you that inviting me to play poker was a mistake." Tony put his cards next to the other five open on the table and smiled. "A four of a kind, lady and sir." He looked at the other two and laughed. Natasha's mouth was wrinkled in a grimace and Steve, oh, poor Steve, his mouth was open with shock, looking at the cards, unable to believe it. Tony didn’t resist and grasped the soldier's chin and raised his face gently to meet his eyes. "The expression you're looking for, Stevie, sugar, is
Tony and Thor raised the monster from the ground and Hulk gave the impulse that was needed to send the hydra back to the Greek world from where it had come and with a powerful lightening, Thor hit the portal, closing it.
Tony took the mug automatically, but his attention was elsewhere, more precisely on the fact that Steve was wearing the underside of his uniform and an extremely tight blue thermal T-shirt that outlined every muscle in his chest, and
Tony parked the car. They had finally arrived at Steve and Peter's house and Tony saw Steve outside, holding a sponge and with a bucket at his feet. On the wall behind him, the letters RER were still visible. Tony and Steve's eyes met and Tony understood immediately. The news had spread. The entire city now knew that the son of the Army Captain and now a famous artist was on trial for murdering a schoolmate and was coming to show its nastiness. To graffiti "MURDERER" on the wall of their house was probably the first step.
Steve ran a hand through his hair, then his face, and ended up resting his chin on his hand. He was watching Tony as if he were seeing him for the first time. “How was it when you woke up?”
"Are you going to tell me now why I'm not on my way to the police station to meet my son?" Steve was more than angry. He was ready to go out and go straight to the police station to talk to that police chief, see Peter and, hopefully, get him out there. But then the lawyer appeared at his door, asked if he could come in, ordered a cup of coffee, and now the two were sitting facing each other, while Peter was waiting for him, certainly thinking the worst things possible. The lawyer -
Steve crossed his arms in front of the body and moved away from the island, leaning back on the bench. "Is that a
Tony went to the microwave, opened the oven door, and there really was a pasta dish topped with béchamel sauce and broccoli. Tony's stomach growled.
would have done in my place, or what you would have told me if you were there with me. Maybe it gave me courage. Your speeches have always inspired me. I don’t know.” Tony shrugged. “The fact is that I erased my memory and the backup I had available didn’t cover the most recent events, such as our fight, the death of Goliath, my lies and manipulations, and neither you dying.”
“Nothing serious,” Natasha said, her voice controlled, expressionless, betraying what she had just said. “But I need you both to see what we brought.”
“I'm coming!” Tony was running like a crazy man towards the elevator when, finally, the last part of the armor connected to his undersuit and the hub of the helmet lit up. Tony activated the repulsors and followed the elevator shaft up to the roof.
? Are you trying to tell me that you already imagined us having sex?” Tony couldn't believe it. That was some side effect of the pollen. It had to be. “Steve, you're telling me you've fantasized about yourself fucking me?”
- he’d be able to solve everything by himself. Most of the time, that plan only made everything worse. Steve needed to help him.
Tony shook his head, dismissing these strange thoughts - no pun intended - and turned to his friends.
"We're on our way, Captain." Sam's voice appeared on the comms. "We made a web barricade, sealing the perimeter, and Redwing is on guard.”
With the room completely in the dark, Tony let his eyes close and with thoughts of "Steve will be happy to know that I slept so much in the last hours," he actually fell asleep.
Forcing his legs to move, Tony turned towards the bed behind them, with Steve still in his arms, and guided him there. One, two, three steps and they stopped. Tony disengaged himself from Steve’s arms and mouth enough to push him toward the mattress. Steve fell on his back, offering no resistance, and crawled on his elbows until he reached the head of the bed, where he leaned, laughing.
Tony jumped back to the surface and met Natasha's gaze, incisive, accusatory, and at the same time sympathetic, if that was possible.
“Yes, all the time. To think that I would never see you again, that I could never tell you how I felt, and that it was all my fault? There wasn’t a minute when I didn’t think about you.”
“Tony? Look at me." Tony did what he asked and wow, he was so beautiful and Tony could feel his heart beating. “If I heard the same song that you dedicated to me, I heard you singing to me that you found love in this place so different and nonsense that it's you and me. Isn't it?"
Steve took the two cups, stood up, refilled them with coffee and handed one to Tony, smiling crookedly. “You know I don’t have any alcohol here, Tony.”
Tony gave a sad smile. “People don’t call me a genius for nothing, you know? My brain is like a supercomputer. And, after I merged with Extremis, it was as if I upgraded it and had almost infinite information processing and storage capacity. I know that. Norman eventually realized that, too. Then he came after me and I fled the world, with the help of the few allies and friends that I had left after the fiasco that was the end of the Civil War and the invasion of the Skrulls.”
"Pretty good, thank you." Before he let go of Tony's hand, Bucky pulled him close so that only Tony could hear. "Take good care of my friend, okay?”
“At least this time things went well, right?” Peter Parker, the Spider-Man, was at the Quinjet returning with them to the Compound. It was Friday, and May Parker didn’t mind the kid spending the weekend with the rest of the team.
"We're finishing things out here," Tony said without much fanfare and Steve was extremely grateful. For a little while. “Soon we go out for our weekend together.”
They moved far away enough for Tony to finish taking off Steve’s shirt and Tony took a little break to admire the man in front of him, the man he loved, and who, surprisingly, loved him back. He reached out and touched Steve’s torso slowly, gently, learning how each of those lines behaved under his fingers, how Steve reacted to his touch, what sounds he made, which places produced the softest sighs, the deepest moans. Steve waited patiently, even though he was breathing hard, his hands holding Tony around the waist, admiring Tony’s reconnaissance work.
Our favorite lawyer is beginning to unravel the mysteries behind the murder and to understand why Peter is, in fact, innocent.
A few minutes later, there was Tony Stark perched behind the chimney on the top of the building in front of Steve’s apartment, hidden in the shadows, waiting. He was fully aware that it was disturbing, but he was unable to return home. He had to see Steve again. Tony needed to see for himself that Steve was fine, that he didn’t need anything. He needed to be sure that Steve had someone watching over him,
With the coffee ready, Tony poured the boiling liquid into two mugs that he found in the cupboard over the sink, and went back to the bedroom, where Steve was still sleeping. Tony left Steve’s mug on the nightstand beside him, and went to the front of the huge window, admiring New York, already frantic. In fact, he had no idea what time it was, or whether anyone had looked for him, and to be honest with himself, Tony didn’t care. All that mattered was that bubble in which he was with Steve.
"Good thing we agreed." He ran his fingers down Steve's leg, from knee to thigh, making the exposed skin shiver, and squeezed. Steve's breathing was quick and uneven. Without pausing too long there, Tony kept sliding his hand until he reached Steve's balls. Tony held them gently and stroked, making Steve drop the most delicious "Ah!" Tony had ever heard.
Tony couldn’t say no to the Captain when he asked for something. Then, knowing that this would be his biggest mistake, Tony stopped and thought that his heart was already too bruised, too numb, and that one more blow would make no difference. So, he waited.
“When I was still alive, still during the Civil War,” Steve said, without changing his voice, without approaching. “I told myself that I hated you.”
“Come on, your coffee will get cold.” Steve pointed to the cup on the outside of the island and Tony found himself walking over there, as if in a trance. He had no control over his own body. All he saw was Steve looking at him, guiding him to where he wanted Tony to stay.
"But I'm enjoying it, my love." Steve smiled, leaving a trail of kisses on Tony's shoulder and making him go mad with the contrast of Steve's cold breath against his warm skin.
“Claiming the Earth as part of the ‘new Olympus’," Thor made the quotes in the air. “He and Hades were together in this scheme. I asked Heimdall to find Hercules, and he will be here soon to carry this loutish to have the judgment he deserves.”
"You are a guest at the house of your current client, who was kind to provide you a room, although this is not very orthodox, I would say," Pepper said and Tony could hear her typing on a keyboard. "And if I were you, I would get up as fast as my anesthetized brain would allow me, because my extremely competent associate got a judge in Boston to sign Peter Rogers out of jail."
With no time to overthink about the pet name, Tony kissed him as he unbuttoned Steve's jeans, then pushed his underwear down over his butt, with his shoes along the way, and stripped him naked. He gave a lopsided smile to Steve. “You're gorgeous.” Steve shivered and hissed as Tony's fingertips grazed the inside of his thighs, over his balls, up the tender underside of his cock, to twirl them around the edges of the head. Without waiting for any other invitation than Steve's delicious sighs to every touch, Tony bent down and licked the underside of Steve's cock all the way up to taste his precum. “Gorgeous and delicious. How you manage that?”
"Well, Steve, Peter's arrest was the last step in a chain of events of an investigation that has been going on for some time. Look, earlier this year, a boy who was studying at the same school as Peter was killed, but no one could find the murderer. The case was covered up so that the panic wouldn't spread among the community and among the students. To this day, everyone thinks the boy has been transferred to another school because his parents have moved from the city, fearing the murderer will return and also the pain of not knowing who he or she is. But even after all these months the investigations haven't stopped. With each new lead, there was a new suspect. Until last week."
Steve snorted. “We only argued because we wanted the same things in different ways. We believed that we knew what was best for the group. Sometimes we were able to find consensus and work together. It was incredible when it happened, remember?”
Peter looked up when he heard the door open and Steve's heart broke a little more with the light that took over his son's features when he saw him arrive. He didn't deserve to be received with that joy, with that hope. He had nothing to offer. But still, Peter needed him. He needed him to be anything,
“Oh, my God, that’s why no one can win an argument with you. Look at that beautiful face. How do you do it?”
Tony sighed. “You know, Steve, my whole life has been very lonely. I was always very careful that no one noticed, so that what people knew about me was the image of the carefree billionaire playboy, who, after a moment of clarity, decided to use his spare time and money to be a superhero, inside a shining armor.”
"I could tell. Making me come from New York to take his case as a favor is not for everyone," Tony leaned over the table, crossed his fingers, and looked at Steve. "Very well, Mr. Rogers. I needed to know where I'm getting into. I like to know what kind of environment I'm going to be in and what kind of people I'm going to deal with. Believe me when I say I've dealt with all kinds of people and not all as kind and civilized as you are." Tony's gaze was penetrating but soft, looking for some reaction from Steve, who remained neutral. A life in the Army had taught him many things. To keep a poker face was one of them. "I already agreed to take over your son's case. I like cases like that, despite how wrong it sounds, I'm sorry. What I mean is that, as much as it seems that there is no way out, I can always find secret passages that nobody thought of looking for."
Tony got up from the bed, but his legs got trapped in the blanket and he fell on all fours, letting his cell phone slide across the floor.
Steve took a deep breath before putting his mouth on his and Tony was surprised for a second, amazed by the burning strength of his lips. Then his libido reached his brain and Tony tiptoed up, clasping his hand on Steve’s neck, returning the kiss with everything he had been holding inside him all that time, all the pain of having lost Steve, for never having the courage to say how much he loved him before, to have gone to war against the person he loved the most, to have hit rock bottom, to finally be able to surrender to Steve with all of his soul, and finally to feel Steve’s sweet and intoxicating taste on his tongue, which danced and explored alongside Steve’s, as if they already knew each other and needed to make up for all the lost time away from each other.
, please! Ah, that’s pleeeeaasure. For God's sake, don't stop, don't stop, don't stop. I'm going to come so hot.” Tony’s was out of himself. His sentences were more or less intelligible combinations of “yes”, “don’t stop”, “harder” and “ah”.
Natasha was suspended by Sam, attacking the eyes of one of the heads and one of them was already closed and bleeding horribly. Clint had closed the mouth of another head with a steel rope and hit an electric arrow in one of the eyes and one explosive in the other, and was already looking at the third head with the help of Tony.
"You look for each other in the crowd," she said. "When you and Tony walked away yesterday and went round the party, every few seconds you two looked away from your conversations, scanned the party until you found the other, smiled lightly, and returned to your conversations.”
“Come,” Steve said, taking her hand. “We'll show you your room, all the facilities in the Compound, and more importantly, we’ll introduce you to the whole team officially.”
Moments passed, and Tony said nothing. But he also didn't walk away, nor did he send Steve away. That was a good sign, wasn't it? Steve waited. When he was taking some breath in to say something, Tony exploded.
The world outside doesn’t exist, Tony. Neither before nor after. There are just you and me. And that’s all,” Steve smiled the brightest of smiles.
"It's not fair that your vows were so beautiful," Tony sniffed and wiped a tear that ran down with the back of his hand. "Look the mess I am now."
He shook his head trying to find some sound to show him what was happening when his nose touched something soft and smelling good.
“Start where you think it’s easier,” Steve said, bending down to pick up his own underwear, lying on the floor nearby, and putting it on.
“First, it's definitely not a myth. But sex-pollen, Steve, only truly works in a very specific situation.” Tony knelt on the floor and crawled over to Steve until he was on his knees in front of him. Tony took him by the shoulders and Steve held Tony by the waist, taking a pleasure sigh from Tony’s mouth. “Can you imagine what specific situation it is?”
Tony turned his body still on Steve's lap, facing him, and put his arms around Steve's neck, pinning him. Steve held Tony by the waist and the proximity created unexpected points of contact. Tony took a deep breath, trying to control himself enough to finish the sentence. He smiled. “My, my, who do you kiss with that filthy mouth, Winghead?”
The Avengers, no matter how good they are, don’t come home with Steve at the end of the day. Bucky, even if he’s back, doesn’t go on missions with Steve as in the old times of their partnership, because now he and Natasha were a pair. How, then, could Steve consider his home there? How could he have wanted to come back? Tony saw his list of questions grow and no real opportunity to ask them.
Smiling, Tony sat on the back on the lab floor, facing Steve. “Wait.” He spread his legs, and put some lube in his hands. After rubbing each hand on the other to warm the gel, unceremoniously, Tony circled his pucked hole with two lube-covered fingers and groaned. While he repeated the circular movements, with the other hand he jerked himself. Without waiting much longer, Tony stuck both fingers inside his hole at once. He threw his head back and closed his eyes, letting out a “Ah, yes!” and after that, he started fucking himself with his own fingers, adding a finger at a time, until reaching four.
With a painfully heavy sigh, Steve turned and ran toward the door. Trying not to think too much about what was about to happen, Tony looked out the window of the laboratory, to the literal hell the Earth had become. The sky was completely dark, but with no moon (God knows what had happened to it), buildings coming down, the ground cracking and exposing the boiling subsoil of lava, desperate cries, flying heroes still trying to save what was already doomed and all wrapped in a nauseating smell of sulfur and burnt skin. Shaking his head and refusing to look at the clock, Tony turned his back to the scene just in time to see Steve walking back into the lab and, to Tony's relief, accompanied.
Wanda nodded and, with a surge of red energy coming out of her hands, she took off and landed in front of the right head. With precise attacks, she attacked the right head of Cerberus, who was advancing menacingly to the Avenger.
Steve’s touch, his hands holding Tony that firmly did things to Tony’s body by sending blood and everything Tony had to his groin. Tony wanted Steve to continue to hold his waist
Steve’s smile grew. “It’s just you and me here.” Steve put a hand behind Tony’s neck, and began to massage the sudden knots. Tony closed his eyes and groaned softly. That was wonderful. “Stop thinking and focus on just the two of us.” Did Steve’s voice seem more distant or was it an impression?
"Welcome back, boss," Friday greeted cheerfully as Tony and the others stepped out of the elevator and into the common area of the Tower penthouse.
If they had started under the blessings of the moon, waking up bathed in the warmth of the morning sun was like receiving the seal that made it all real.
Steve pushed Tony away and left him sitting on his lap for an instant, long enough for the sunlight coming in through the window to bathe Tony’s entire body, creating shadows on Tony’s angular and turned muscles, which the armor always hid, but that, oh yes, were there, waiting for Steve, all that time.
"Immediately, sir. If you need anything, you know, just call," the girl, Mary, went back behind the counter to take the orders and Tony turned to Rhodes.
“Thanks, Friday, but follow the original plan, okay?” He took off his shoes and coat, and threw himself on the bed. "Just tell Natasha and keep secret from the others. Let me know when it's an hour before the party.”
If it were up to Tony, he and Steve would make out hard right there, in front of Strange to show that that flower was no big deal. But Tony agreed to the plan, so there he was, pretending that everything was like a week ago.
“I know you’re there,” Steve said, still in a low voice, as if to prove that he knew Tony had the means to listen to him. “And you’re dying to know how I know,” and the jackass smirked, knowing exactly what Tony was thinking.
“Nothing,” Tony replied quickly. “I mean, we're not going to hurt you. You yourself said you inherited the best of us.” He waved his hand between himself and Steve. “We want to see it working. It will be fascinating.”
Peter's eyes widened and Steve couldn't help but find it adorable. His son was too incredible and too sweet to go through with all that.
“Hi, Tony.” Steve smiled without showing his teeth and Tony thought he could melt in a puddle right there.
At the police station, Tony handed the judge's signed papers to Rhodes and waited for his friend to pick up the most important boy in his life at the moment. If something happened, he didn't even want to imagine what Natasha would do to him. A few minutes later, Rhodes returned with Peter and Tony was sure he had never seen a boy looking so miserable. He was even more dejected than the day before, his shoulders slumped, with deep, dark circles under his eyes, his lips dry, his skin pale and sickly looking, which only made his puffy and red eyes stand out even more. Peter Rogers looked like a zombie.
With a grunt, Steve climbed onto the counter and Tony was already with his hands on the waistband of his robe, undoing the knot and leaving him gloriously naked. Steve leaned over Tony, making him lie down on the counter, hooked his fingers into Tony's underwear and slid it slowly down his legs.
“Well, then I ran as far as I could, but there’s a limit. I ran out of resources. He cornered me. I was without armors, with no money available, nothing but my last alternative that didn’t involve killing myself.” A shiver ran through Tony’s spine. “And, look, I’m a futurist. I prepare myself for the most different scenarios. I figured that one day I would need to do something like that, so I kept a backup of my own mind, but for reasons I don’t know, it was only updated to a week before Stamford. But it would have to do.”
” Tony could hardly believe that he had actually said that sentence out loud. It was such an absurd idea.
“Did it work?” Tony didn’t move, but Steve could feel his heartbeat increased. He didn’t stop stroking Tony’s hair though.
Tony thought. Of course Steve had already said that he loved him countless times since they finally had the courage to open up for each other. But the desire, well, Tony hadn’t imagined it was as intense as all the rest. And if it was possible, that made him love and want Steve even more and only for him forever.
Steve’s eyes took in his whole vision and they were distressed, looking all over Tony’s face looking for something, trying to help. Tony wanted to say that it wasn’t his fault. Steve couldn’t control the fact that he was who he was, the most incredible, generous, funny person in a unique, sensitive way, and perfect in every way that Tony could think of, even in the flaws. Tony was the crooked vase there, the wrong piece. He just couldn’t say it. His throat was closed, his eyes filled with tears. He shook his head, trying, in one last effort, to tell Steve that it was a futile effort to reach him. Tony was hopeless.
“That's all I want, Friday. I waited too long to let all this oxytocin flow through me,” he found himself smiling. “I
"In your story you said you had a boyfriend," Tony tried not to look too excited. "What did you mean, you had a boyfriend?"
Steve hugged him, stroking his dumped and sweaty hair, and kept him there, close to his heart, where Steve always dreamed of having him. He didn't want to think about what would happen now. Had the pollen left Tony's body? What would happen to their relationship? Would there be a relationship? Those answers could wait until Tony recovered, right? There was no hurry.
Before Cerberus could move to attack Steve, Wanda lunged at the huge dog and mounted on the middle head. Realizing that it was being set up, the middle head was startled and began to move furiously to the sides, trying to throw Wanda away, but she held onto the dog's black hair and Steve could see red energy flowing from Wanda's hands to the head of Cerberus. The Avenger's eyes lit up, and Cerberus's eyes closed. All six. And the huge hellish dog fell under his four paws, sleeping peacefully in front of the United Nations building.
“Oh, my God, Steve, how can you say those things and still be sexy like that?” Tony said, pinching one of Steve’s nipples between his fingers, making Steve throw his head back and moan loudly. Tony smiled, satisfied.
I cried with happiness for the first time in decades, because I was finally able to look you in the eye and say those three words that have
Tony laughed, drank some of his coffee, and looked at Steve through the reflection in the window. “I need a shower.” He tilted his neck back to try to see Steve's face, who was looking down at him with a sly smile. “Actually, we need a shower. You promised me one when we woke up. Well, we’re awake.”
Thanks to you who came until here, to you who read the whole story, to you who started now. Thank you for the kudos, the comments, the support and for being such incredible people.
“I didn’t know. I should’ve said something, but I was scared.” Steve gave a sad smile. “I wanted to respect your space. That’s when I saw your footprints in the building over there, and I thought maybe, just maybe, you could’ve reconsidered my offer to come in and talk.” The smile was happier now. “It never crossed my mind that you could be coming for other reasons.”
The trip to Lincoln Center was quick and quiet. Even before they were shipped, Thor and Natasha had already worked out a plan of action for them when they got there. After so many years working together, everyone already knew each other's ways of operating, behaving during a fight and how to get the most out of it. The Avengers, no matter what team was in the field, they always worked in perfect synchrony.
“Yes, it all happened, but long story short, only my body died, Tony.” A shiver ran through Tony’s body when he heard his own name being said by Steve. Would he get used to it again?
He allowed himself to look discreetly at Steve, who was driving home in silence, but his calm, neutral facade was belied by a pulsating vein in his neck and clenched jaw. Tony looked away to see the Boston landscape through the window. He would do anything to make up for that first failure. He had been sent here for a reason: he was the best. He had a reputation and would prove that it wasn’t in vain.
Slowly the girl smiled and that was the last straw. It was real. How could this be happening, Natasha didn’t know, but it was. Somehow, that girl had just smiled Steve Rogers' perfect, welcoming smile right there, just inches from her face. Natasha heard Sam gasp behind her. He had seen it, too.
the day before, damn it. Why couldn’t I call you?” Tony laughed bitterly. “Pepper called Rhodes and Maria Hill and they gave a summary as detailed as possible of everything that had happened. Honestly, I don’t know what shocked and hurt me the most, knowing that we had fought over something as stupid as a law - I kept wondering why we hadn’t sat down to talk and solve it - and how was it possible for you to be dead. I had never, in any of my predictions, seen you dying. Never. That had never been a possible scenario. And there it was,” Tony spread his arms, pointing at Steve, as if to prove his point. “The stuffing of the story I got by myself, watching countless security videos, reading my own files, and asking Reed a few other things,” Tony took the last sip of his coffee, placed the cup delicately on the kitchen island and looked at Steve. “There. Now you know what happened to me while you were gone.”
Blinking a few times to adjust his vision, Tony tried to move and found himself with his legs stuck. For an instant of panic, his fighting side had already imagined that he was trapped by enemies and that plans would be needed for an escape. As he looked down, despair threatening to come up, Tony saw his legs intertwined with two others and then the memories of the previous night hit him like a cosmic punch (believe it, it is an extraordinary force). How good it was to be able to have memories to remember, even more memories as beautiful as those.
Tony turned and looked at the suitcase Steve was pointing at. "Hmmm, yes. It's mine. I didn't want to take it inside your house if we were just going to talk about work. It didn't make sense."
“Wandering in my own space-time. I spent all that time reliving the most important moments of my life. Each of them.” Steve made a sad face.
Steve blushed and gave a shrug, pretending nonchalance. “Yes, I was. But I'm also curious now to know how a simple flower made all this to you.”
“It was probably the most painful scene I have ever seen. And look, I already had my share of painful scenes to fill about three lives.” Steve tried to make a joke, but his eyes staring at his hands that writhed nervously betrayed him. “I heard everything, over and over, until I memorized every word,” Steve said and Tony swallowed a gasp. “Now I know your reasons, your meeting with Arthur, your vision, that, even in the middle of the whole war you never drank once - and that made me
They held each other for a few moments, but soon Tony's stomach came back to life, making him remember the tray of food forgotten on the bed.
Tony couldn’t formulate a coherent sentence because of the huge lump in his throat. That should be forbidden, so much love, so much sincerity.
With what remains of his strength, Tony held the girl to the ship and helped her in. Steve bent down and buckled her belt and, before moving away, gave her a long kiss on the cheek.
if you say so.” He untangled himself from Steve, got to his knees with difficulty, and staggered until he reached the table where the box was. Stretching all over, he took the box in his hands. He put it by his side and took a final look at Steve, just to be sure he wasn't hallucinating this time. Steve nodded. Taking a deep breath, Tony opened the box, and took the flower in his hands. He turned back to Steve and put the red lily on the floor between them.
Tony sighed. That War would never have come this far if they hadn’t taken sides. If both had moved away, perhaps things would have worked out differently. Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps.
Tony landed abruptly, but no scan had detected concussions, fractures or any other problem. They were still in the middle of the street, but Tony ignored the horns. The important thing now was to know if Steve was all right. He looked down and met the soldier's eyes. Tony opened his faceplate and stared back at him.
Steve lightly smiled and intensified his moves, sucking hard now, making Tony shiver, no longer being able to stand on his own elbows, and needing to lie on the counter, moaning loudly and moving his hips toward Steve's mouth in a hurry.
"I told you to not underestimate me. Or do you think I didn’t see the smiles, the glances, the slippery hands?”
Tony felt his face heat up. Apparently, his musings were too sharp, too easy to understand. “Sorry, I don’t ... You don’t have to talk about it, if you don’t want to.”
Breathing hard, both of them came to themselves with their heads resting on each other, smiling like fools. With his heart beating at the normal pace, or as normal as possible after all that, Steve got out of Tony and lay down beside him, completely exhausted, pulling Tony into his embrace, snuggling and protecting him.
"You need to embody the Army Captain that still exists in you to get through this situation," Tony said, looking back at him. "You need to think of all this as a mission, as if they," he pointed in the direction of the police station. "As if they were your enemies and you needed to go through them during a secret mission, in which no emotion can escape from you. Artist Steve Rogers? With all his sensitivity and empathy? He needs to leave the scene now. You need to get back to be Captain Rogers, able to access your coldness quickly, if you want to go through all of this more or less unscathed."
"Fine," Tony grimaced. "My day just got less good. Let's go home. Every minute lost here is a minute not spent doing something fun until the Fury arrives.”
It was everything he wanted the most. Steve invited him, without anger, without harsh words, just an invitation. And Tony couldn’t do it. He stared at where Steve had been, the marks of his arms where he leaned against the rail, still visible in the snow.
"Okay, the chat's fine, but I'm going to bed." Clint got up and stretched his arms over his head. "I need a shower and some quiet time”
"Let's see," Tony thought aloud. "Two hours on a plane..." He looked at his huge closet and decided on the basics: jeans, canvas shoes, a red T-shirt and a black coat. Tony looked at himself in the mirror. “Perfect. Friday, what do you have for me?”
"Come on," Steve said, climbing onto one of the bikes and pointing the other to Wanda. "We're going to Ares like that. Thor, lead the way.”
“Shouldn’t we clean up?” Tony asked, not really wanting to know, because he was amazed at the discovery of how perfectly he fit the curve of Steve’s neck, as if that place had been made for him.
“Please, spare me from the intimate details.” Strange looked away, embarrassed, but then pulled himself together and looked at Tony. “Do you
Tony has never felt anything like that in his life. Of course, others had already passed through his life. Playboy fame hadn’t come out of the blue. But it had never happened before with that level of commitment, intimacy, passion, trust and, most importantly, love. It was as if in a minute Tony was on the edge of a precipice and, in the next minute, he was flying through the void in a million pieces.
to the position of Director of SHIELD.” Tony emphasized each word, making quotes in the air. “The government fell for Osborn and accepted the proposal. Thus, I was deposed from the position of Director of SHIELD. But we know that Norman Osborn can’t be trusted because his plans have plans. Nothing is ever what it seems. And this time wasn’t different. He didn’t want to be Director of the largest spy agency in the world simply because the goodness bug stung him and he decided he’d be nice. He had other plans.”
Tony focused again on Steve’s face, his eyes, and realized that he had so much to ask, so much to say, that he couldn’t decide where to start.
With a grunt, Steve tore what was left of Tony's undersuit, opening a tear from his back to his hip, which left more than enough space for Tony to wriggle and get rid of all that fabric that was holding him. Tony was finally free.
“We need to get this thing out of here,” Steve said, his light stance fading. “Tony, if the gun is taken out of the ground, will it detonate?”
"It was as if a meteor had entered the atmosphere," Tony said. "Only without going through the air."
And then, Tony was forced to stop as fast as he was ready to fight when he saw Stephen Strange standing there, watching everything calmly, with his long black hair waving along with his cloak, in the light breeze of that late afternoon, and holding an ornamented box.
“Let's take it easy, okay?” Steve said and Tony was in doubt if that had been an orientation for him or for Steve himself.
to reach out and take it. Tony couldn’t just have told his biggest secret, opened his heart to the person he loved and trusted most, and whom he had hurt the most, and in return to receive that smile, to get that feeling back. It didn’t seem right to have done so many horrible things, even though thinking they were right, and still be rewarded with all Steve Rogers’ affection and attention. Steve should push Tony away, say how much he despised Tony for everything, for the horrible human being he was and had been able to become.
Tony couldn't help the bitter laugh that came out of his nose. “You're unable to even say that you would’ve to fuck me, Steve.” The laugh died. “Leave me alone.” But inside, that little voice was screaming a big Stay with me, please. It was fighting, urging someone to let it out, someone to hear, but Tony remained silent.
Tony's head was made with cotton, his vision was blurry and his only point of clarity was Steve. He glowed and nothing else existed. Tony wanted him close,
“Honey,” Tony said, standing up. “I try to get cool with my life.” He bent to give the soldier a quick kiss before returning to the back of Quinjet.
Steve was without his helmet, so it was possible to see his face clearly now. So clearly that Tony could see his cheeks turning red at the answer.
"We will not get anywhere talking here," Sam said, taking flight to the ground. "Let's take it all and take it to the Compound.”
“Yes, all the time. To think that I would never see you again, that I could never tell you how I felt, and that it was all my fault? There wasn’t a minute when I didn’t think about you.”
each other. No wonder you didn’t come apart after that kiss on the dance floor.” She smiled at him. “It was one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen.”
Inside there was a table set, full service, drinks already served, and the special order of the night already fully operational at the back of the room, with the colored lights flashing and the TV on.
And, thirty minutes later, Tony's phone came on announcing Natasha's video call. Tony set the phone on the counter in the suite's living room and let the holographic screen come alive, showing Natasha's face with the spy's room in the background.
“I’m sorry, Tony.” And Tony knew that Steve was telling the truth in each of those words. So, he came over and kissed him slowly, to show how much Steve’s truth meant to him. As Tony stepped back, he took a deep breath because he wasn’t done yet. He needed Steve to hear everything.
"You already cooked for me today." Steve leaned over and kissed Tony's face. "Let me cook for you now. Only your company is enough for me.”
With a sigh he couldn’t - and didn’t want to - hold, Tony tucked his face into the curve of Steve's neck and felt his fresh bath scent and Steve, and a shiver ran down Tony's spine. Steve came up and ran his hands up and down Tony's back, all the shame of a few minutes ago gone. He pulled away enough to kiss beneath Tony's ear, that inspired loudly and tightened his arms around Steve, who continued to leave a trail of kisses from the ear to the base of Tony's neck and then came back doing the reverse.
"I'm already investigating everything that can be investigated about that Jared's family. I heard they are no longer living here."
Tony smiled and licked until reaching Steve’s earlobe, that Tony bit, making Steve shiver, and then whispered, “This is
Steve, then, in a bold move, not only called, but increased two chips, totaling six. Tony felt his eyes widen quickly, but he soon returned to his empty expression.
Tony tried to think of a funny answer, but he couldn’t. The normalcy and calm of that scene left him breathless. It was something he could get used to. It was something he
At the first ring of the deafening alarm, the three Avengers prepared themselves. Whoever had managed to get so close, by surprise, couldn't want anything friendly.
Tony pulled away as best he could to not wake Steve, propped himself up on his elbow and stood there, just admiring the calm Steve slept with, his eyes still, indicating that he wasn’t dreaming - or, worse, having nightmares - his golden hair spiky on all sides, messed up in a way that people out there would never see (and that made Tony feel a sense of possession that he had never felt before towards anyone), his mouth half open on one side, deep, relaxed breathing. He was beautiful. And he said he loved Tony. They had made love the night before. Steve had taken him in his arms with adoration and made Tony float. And Steve said he would take care of Tony, that he would make Tony understand why he thought Tony deserved to be happy. Tony laughed through his nose. Only Steve to be so optimistic and believe that Tony was someone worth fighting for.
"You're beautiful," Steve looked up at Tony again and smiled, kissing Tony before his hands moved to deal, with skill, with the button and zipper. And with a jerk, pants and underwear were on the floor. Tony gasped as his dick popped out, and he did the same with Steve's pants and disengaged from his, kicking them away.
Without saying anything, Tony sat down and started opening the button on Steve’s pants. “In a hurry, Stark?” Steve asked with a breathless laugh.
"Your cortisol levels are higher than they ever were. Just like your serotonin levels, too. But there is a hormone that I have never identified in your analysis and that justifies all the other symptoms.”
Tony nodded and took a sip of coffee, for the simple pleasure of taking a dramatic break. "A favor for Natasha."
“You're the hypothetical person, aren't you, Stark?” Strange asked, very seriously and very tiredly, to Tony.
"Hello, baby," Tony said cheekily, and Steve let out a breath that he hadn’t even realized he was holding. He smiled. There he was.
The Tower's emergency alarms went off suddenly: an enemy had invaded the building's perimeter without alerting any of the radars.
When Peter arrived, he was eleven years old. And even though he had every reason in the world to revolt himself and be a rebellious boy, he was always sweet, generous and extremely intelligent. The perfect son, with the warmest and most affectionate smile imaginable. So when Steve answered the phone, he thought it was a mistake.
But Tony actually answered the call, without fear this time, because Steve was on the other side, waiting to hold him and take care of him.
“I can’t believe it was like that.” Tony shook his head, punching himself mentally for that stupidity.
P.S.: Trigger Warning: the first part has a description of a panic attack. So, if this is sensitive content for you, feel free to start reading from "'Are you alright?' Tony asked quietly beside him."
Steve shook his head. “No. I couldn’t change the past. I tried, but I couldn’t.” Steve looked away. “I could only go through all those events again and again and again, endlessly.”
“You’re the best thing that ever happened to me. I could draw you now, just like that.” Steve stroked Tony’s face and let his hand go down his arm, until he reached Tony’s hand, which he held, brought to his lips and kissed with adoration. “But I would never be able to put on paper all your nuances, all your complexity, all your beauty, all your perfection, Tony. Nothing I try to do will do you justice.”
“Meet in two days in Dubai.” The voice of the Stark Industries CEO was friendly, but her tone was full of apologies. “They want you.”
you,” Tony said, smirking, and bending down towards the curve of Steve's neck, sucking hard enough to leave a mark that, hopefully, it would last long enough for the rest of the team to see. He kissed his way down the valley between his pecs, then kissed and sucked each nipple.
With a sigh, Tony slowly untangled his legs from Steve’s legs, got up from the bed, grabbed the nearest piece of clothing - which happened to be Steve’s T-shirt -, got dressed and went into the kitchen. There, he turned on the coffee maker and, while waiting for the coffee to be ready, he realized how strange his body was, kind of sticky, kind of rigid in strange places, which usually didn’t get that way. Lifting his shirt to see what was wrong, Tony laughed not meaning to. A transparent, slightly whitish layer covered a large part of his abdomen, making it stiff and uncomfortable.
Tony blinked and felt his face heat up. He looked at his own cup and sipped his coffee. It was delicious. “I’m sorry. It’s just that I still haven’t gotten used to the idea of ...” Tony risked looking at Steve, who was looking back at him, waiting. Tony looked back at his coffee. “I still haven’t gotten used to the idea of having you back.”
“I'm not talking about courage to sing. I was talking about courage to finish what we're doing here.” Tony smirked.
Tony lowered his cup, which was getting dangerously empty. “I’m already getting there. Well, it obviously didn’t take long for Osborn to realize that SHIELD, now HAMMER, didn’t have the Records he wanted so badly, and there wasn’t a single backup in any corner of this Earth. But then, he reminded us of why we shouldn’t underestimate Norman Osborn,” Tony sighed heavily, thinking that it was from that moment that, in fact, nothing would ever be the same again. “He remembered that there was, indeed, one last backup of the Records.”
“I came to see if it was true that you were alive,” Tony confessed. “Nobody ever told me that you and Thor were there and that, God help me, that you saved me. I remember waking up and running into Strange, Rhodes and Pepper, but no one told me that my instructions to bring me back, in case I needed to erase my memory, had been followed so strictly, let alone worked. Also, when I recorded those instructions, you were dead,” Tony swallowed. It would never be easy to think of a world without Steve. “I thought of those instructions with Bucky carrying the shield. I never imagined that you could be back to help me. I ... I honestly don’t know what to think. But I know that I will have a very serious conversation with a Miss Pepper Potts as soon as I see her.”
"Don't waste your precious time as a competent and wonderful associate commenting on uselessness, honey," Tony stood up and looked out over the window at the Boston view.
“Steve?” Tony called, forcing his legs to move toward the other. “Steve, talk to me.” Tony sat on the other chair and looked at his husband. Steve was glazed in the other room, as if hypnotized. Tony held his face in his hands and turned to face him.
“Wandering in my own space-time. I spent all that time reliving the most important moments of my life. Each of them.” Steve made a sad face.
"Your friend doesn’t like his own birthday and wouldn’t let me throw him a party," Tony threw his arms up, remembering his conversation with Steve about it. "So I planned to throw a party with the excuse that we would celebrate the beginning of Peter's summer...”
Tony steadied in the air a little above the Scientist Supreme and raised his arms, pointing his repulsors straight at his chest.
"Give it up, Fury," Clint said, turning an arrow between his fingers. "When Tony decides to get stuck in his cave, no one can get him out if he doesn’t want to."
With all of Strange’s warnings out of his mind, Tony came over to smell the flower with a deep breath. And it was delicious, invading Tony’s senses like an explosion. The scent was delicate at first, soft and sweet, but soon after it was replaced by a stronger, yet a very strange one for a flower: the smell of soap, followed by clean clothes and another one that Tony was unable to concentrate enough to identify. He was still involved in the red light emanating from the flower, and his limbs were numb, but surely that was the effect of being on his knees for a long time, right? His head, before so calm, was spinning, lots of thoughts flooding his mind, making it overflow and lighting into Tony something primitive and urgent.
Tony turned to him, very serious, and looked at him. "If he thinks I'm the one to blink first in this game, he's very much mistaken. In this game, I'm an expert," Tony winked at Rhodes in a mischievous way. "I'm
Peter was sitting behind an aluminum table, his hands cuffed and tied to the table, his shoulders slumped, his brown hair messy and ruffled to all directions, his clothes rumpled, his face sunken, downcast, his eyes - always so alive smart and curious -, they were swollen, red and listless. Steve had never seen his son look so sad and the boy had already passed through his mother's funeral. Steve's soul ached for his son. He felt himself shrink and be as helpless as ever. He had no power there. He couldn't take those handcuffs off and get his son out of there. He couldn't take away that sadness and emptiness from the most important person in his life. He wasn't that powerful. He wanted it so much, but he still couldn't.
He went down the hall to the kitchen and found himself alone on the first floor of the house. It was all open concept, with the living room just ahead, with two comfortable sofas, a coffee table, a large TV and a video game below it, with two controls. Tony smiled, imagining Steve and Peter sitting there, playing together. Shaking his head, Tony headed for the kitchen, which was on his left. The cabinets and the island were very bright, with marble surfaces. Everything was meticulously organized, and Tony almost felt bad for looking for the things he needed, if it weren't for his stomach growling, asking for food. "I don't eat in what? Twelve hours?" Tony asked himself out loud, opening the refrigerator and analyzing its contents. He decided on some potatoes, chicken fillets and tomatoes. He hadn't cooked in a while, but he still remembered what it was like.
Tony walked through a room, with the bed meticulously made, and went down a narrow corridor, until he came to a room that was lit and smelled of coffee: the kitchen, with the living room right next to it. Steve was behind the kitchen island, his back to Tony, preparing several things at the same time. On the island, two steaming cups of coffee placed on opposite sides, facing each other.
"I did it," she said on the other end of the line, her voice clean and clear, showing that she had been up long enough to be extremely efficient.
Forcing his legs to move, Tony turned towards the bed behind them, with Steve still in his arms, and guided him there. One, two, three steps and they stopped. Tony disengaged himself from Steve’s arms and mouth enough to push him toward the mattress. Steve fell on his back, offering no resistance, and crawled on his elbows until he reached the head of the bed, where he leaned, laughing.
“Look, we don’t wanna hur...” he said as he came up with one of his hands up in front of his body defensively. Right attitude, wrong time.
“I came to see if it was true that you were alive,” Tony confessed. “Nobody ever told me that you and Thor were there and that, God help me, that you saved me. I remember waking up and running into Strange, Rhodes and Pepper, but no one told me that my instructions to bring me back, in case I needed to erase my memory, had been followed so strictly, let alone worked. Also, when I recorded those instructions, you were dead,” Tony swallowed. It would never be easy to think of a world without Steve. “I thought of those instructions with Bucky carrying the shield. I never imagined that you could be back to help me. I ... I honestly don’t know what to think. But I know that I will have a very serious conversation with a Miss Pepper Potts as soon as I see her.”
“As you might imagine, if you’re following the timeline, a few days after Urich’s visit to my office, you died. After that, the Skrulls came and, with their defeat, came the distrust in me and the arrival of Norman Osborn on the scene.” Tony sighed, thinking about what it must’ve been like to deal with that maniac. Tony didn’t mind not remembering that. “He was responsible for pulling the trigger on the gun that killed Skrull Queen right in the middle of Central Park, in front of dozens of cameras, which broadcast him on national television as the hero the country needed ... the hero I wasn’t. For all these reasons, he found himself in the position of savior of the world, and took the opportunity to present the government with a plan apparently better than what we had, and introduced himself as someone more
Tony didn’t know what to think. His brain flew, millions of thoughts at the same time, trying to fit into coherent reasoning. Steve was talking about what? Was he talking about the Civil War? Or was he talking about something else that Tony wasn’t told and that he should know?
Steve shrugged. “I had a lot of time to think while I relived those moments and after I came back. There’s no point in brooding over what happened, Tony. We learn from our mistakes. Let’s move on and keep an eye on each other so it doesn’t happen again.” Steve looked at his hand still opened in Tony’s direction. “You come with me? Shall we start over together? I want you so much with me.”
“My parents are Tony Stark and Steve Rogers.” The girl smiled and it was Tony's turn to squeal. He grabbed Steve's leg.
"Oh, Steve, you can’t even imagine what I've been keeping." Tony lifted his face, moving closer to Steve's face, their mouths so close that Tony could almost taste it...
Tony laughed through his nose. “Sometimes I think you have no idea how big you are for other people.” He held up his hand, interrupting Steve before he started. “I know what you’re going to say. I know you never wanted any of this. I know you only do what you think is right and blah blah blah. But you need to accept who and what you are for us.”
The moment that simple thought crossed Tony's mind, his body changed. The mere thought of having Steve around made everything look hotter, brighter, more urgent than before. He needed Steve there with him. He needed to see him, to know that he was close by. Tony had no idea what would happen to him when Steve was finally that close, but his body was so willing to find out.
He opened the tube of lube, put a little in one hand, rubbed one hand in the other to warm the gel and, unceremoniously, Tony held his throbbing and already hard dick in his hand and started stroking himself.
“Because it means that we’d be together anyway, whether or not we knew the contents of the box in advance. This we have right here.” Steve lifted their hands and kissed Tony's hand. “
He was sitting at the corner of one of the huge sofas, without his coat, his shirt sleeves rolled up to the crook of his arm, and no tie, leaning against Steve, who had one of his arms around Tony. At some point last night, they both fell asleep there, with Tony using Steve's shoulder as a pillow. The engineer gave a slight kiss on the bend of the soldier's neck, where his nose had bumped, slowly moved away, taking care that Steve didn’t wake up and stood there watching him sleep.
unexpected turns. He wasn’t expecting that question. He should simply tell his version of the story and that’s it. Tony realized that he was trapped by Steve’s hands, that they were extremely close to each other, as they hadn’t been in a while, and Tony’s heart raced. He swallowed.
Tony ran a hand through his hair in frustration. “We could’ve solved all of our problems with a simple conversation.
Tony punched the marble from the kitchen island and stood up, rubbing his face, frustrated, irritated, hurt by the injustice that was all that. He walked in circles and ended up facing Steve again, with open arms, gesticulating like a crazy man. “All I have are second-hand memories and second-hand feelings from the most important moment in our lives to date. It doesn’t seem fair that I have a hole where painful memories should be,” Tony found himself shouting, but he didn’t care. He had been holding on since he got in that apartment. “I should learn lessons from these memories, it was all a mistake,
Tony blinked a few times, repeating the phrase mentally, afraid he might have heard it wrong. “What did you say?”
“As you might imagine, if you’re following the timeline, a few days after Urich’s visit to my office, you died. After that, the Skrulls came and, with their defeat, came the distrust in me and the arrival of Norman Osborn on the scene.” Tony sighed, thinking about what it must’ve been like to deal with that maniac.

stop,” Steve's eyes were closed and his mouth was open, trying to catch his breath, not at all being successful at that.
pushing him against a wall and kissing him as if there was nothing in the world that could stop him. It lit everything, making everything seem less terrible, but also much hotter.
“Ah, Steve, you have no idea how sex-pollen works, do you?” Tony lifted Steve's face with one hand and smiled. He couldn’t believe his own luck, but he was obviously hallucinating. It was the flower. It was the pollen making him to see what he wanted the most. But he didn’t care anymore. Tony would let the flower fool him. He'd let himself think that all of that was true and, hopefully, when it was all over, he'd think that it was just another one of his fantasies.
"That with the windows was you?" Steve asked, coming down the stairs, also barefoot and without his coat.
Slowly, Vision loosened the grip on the girl's neck and placed her back on the floor, but continued to hold her hands firmly behind her body. All care was little with those beams of energy.
“What happened to you?” it wasn’t the most important question in the ranking of questions that Tony made up in his head for when (if) that moment came. But he still didn’t have the courage to reach the top three. And Steve knew he was stalling. And, God bless him, he pretended it was okay for Tony to dodge what he really wanted to know.
Steve reached Tony cock and took it in his hand, making Tony moan, and went down on him. Steve opened up and swallowed Tony in one pass, working his tongue and lips as tight as he could manage around Tony's swollen cock. Steve couldn’t help but give a little smile, still with Tony's cock in his mouth, as he gasped, “Fuck, oh fuck, Steve!
“No,” Natasha replied quickly. “I want you to be quiet, watching from the other side of the glass as I interrogate.”
of you breaking into my home?” Tony turned off the repulsors and went down to the floor, standing next to Steve, who was pretending very badly that he was no longer worried. Tony knew he was tense, waiting for the bad news Strange had certainly brought. Steve had his eyes fixed on the Sorcerer Supreme and his gaze alternated between Strange's face and the box he held.
“It wasn’t worth it,” they both said at the same time. Steve smiled a little, like when you share a secret. A second-hand memory flashed in Tony’s head. A footage.
"I've gotten used to you getting me hot coffee every morning in the lab. I couldn’t let you get crushed." Tony shrugged and smirked.
"Does anyone know what we're dealing with?" Tony asked as his nano-technological armor framed his body.
While Peter kneaded the mixture, Steve began to wash the broccoli and chop onion. It was a meticulous work and the two worked quietly for some time.
Steve got up and began to collect the dishes left by the other Avengers and to carefully arrange them into a stack he placed inside the sink.
“I want you more than anything. I can tell you all the yeses you want.” Tony couldn’t take it anymore. “So, do you forgive me?”
Tony’s fingers tingled looking for any opening in Steve's clothes that could help him take them out and make way for as much exposed skin as possible.
“What happened then?” Steve asked quietly, his voice troubled, any trace of disappointment from before, at the news of Tony’s corruption, gone. Who knew Tony was a good storyteller, even with memories that weren’t even his own anymore?
So Tony was now hiding in the shadows of a chimney, wearing his stealth armor, camouflaging himself in the dark, in the building across from Steve’s in Brooklyn, waiting. It was snowing, but who cares for some snow when the possibilities are so incredible? No lights had been turned on; no movement had been detected. Everything was extremely quiet on that quiet street. Tony was beginning to think that the news was, in fact, rumors, and that espionage was a beautiful waste of time. It wasn’t.
love you." Tony took one of Steve's hands and placed it on his chest, over his heart, and held it there. "Feel that? Do you feel my heart beat? That's good, because I would hate that it was broken now that he's finally healthy and happy. All because of you. It's yours, Steve. It’s for you to do whatever you want with it. Never again doubt that what we have here may end one day because it cannot and will not." Tony stroked Steve's face. "We've been through a lot, and we're still here. All we can do now is make up for the time we have not taken before.”
"I will have a word with Hercules to see if he knows anything about the exit of the hydra from the Tartarus," Thor said. "These events do not usually foretell good news for the Greeks.”
"Guys, did you hear that?" Peter said loudly in the comms. “Captain America and Iron Man are going to be my parents. Isn’t that incredible?”
"Can we meet here tomorrow morning?" Tony asked. “I have a very important appointment in New York and I really need to go back there tomorrow.”
“It looks good, but I bet your cock will fill me up much better, darling.” Tony looked at Steve, who realized his mouth was open while admiring Tony.
Peter jumped out of the chair and with a cry of "yes!" hugged Tony, almost knocking over coffee in everything.
Tony already knew where they were going, the perfect place, away from everything and everyone, incommunicable, just the two of them. The image was so incredible that the idea of losing to Steve was tempting. But Tony had other plans.
,” Tony said biting Steve’s earlobe, as if that information was something trivial. “The pollen is still here and I guess I teased it enough.”
Steve slowly brought Tony close to him and kissed him. Tony could taste the coffee on his tongue and the hand that wasn’t holding the coffee mug flew to Steve’s hair, grabbing it and pinning him in place. Steve groaned and the sound reverberated throughout Tony’s body.
When Tony realized, Steve was kneeling in front of him, looking at him with those hypnotic blue eyes, full of expectation, love and devotion. Steve was loving him, simply leaving behind all the mistakes and pain and showing Tony that this was, in fact, the start of them together for real. Steve loved him. He wouldn’t be smiling, kneeling there, unbuckling Tony’s belt if he didn’t love him, right?
And there, alone again, as if everything that had just happened was just a dream too good to be lived, as if Tony had refused the best of the prizes, he prepared to go home.
Tony swallowed. He remembered everything, then. Well, Tony was never good at hoping. He was never the optimist. That role has always been Steve’s. Tony snorted.
needed him. No, that would be very selfish. Steve came back because this is simply where he fits in.
"Chill out," Steve said, smiling wryly as he opened the bottle. "I'm not going to get you drunk. I need you focused."
let him in. Not even if he puts his password on the panel. He can't see me like that, Jarvis. Do you understand?” Tony looked up, wiping the tears away. “He
Steve looked at Tony and those blue eyes like the open sea never ceased to amaze Tony, and always made him want to drown in there and never leave. The soldier considered all the options for a moment then shrugged. “We’d be here anyway, protecting the Tower from anything that could attack us. If any of those other wizards he talked about come, we'll be prepared.” Steve smiled and looked at Tony through his long lashes. “Together, as we always do.”
Before Tony could think of an answer, he was engulfed into a peaceful sleep, with dreams full of blue, love and warmth.
Tony looked at the red lily and something didn't match. What connexion could that flower have with him feeling worse than after fighting MODOK? Without worrying about anything else, Tony took the red lily out of the box and held it up to eye level.
“I’ll be there with you,” Tony said, opening a shy smile. “I always had hope that you’d come back. But I never thought you would be able to make me confess that I’d do anything for you, that I’d give my heart to you, even though I didn’t think I deserve your love back.”
"We're here." Nat announced, opening the door to the oriental restaurant they had chosen for that night.
“That’s… intriguing.” Strange opened that mysterious smile. “I imagine you are both satisfied with the situation, then?” Strange looked at Steve.
“Well, then I ran as far as I could, but there’s a limit. I ran out of resources. He cornered me. I was without armors, with no money available, nothing but my last alternative that didn’t involve killing myself.” A shiver ran through Tony’s spine. “And, look, I’m a futurist. I prepare myself for the most different scenarios. I figured that one day I would need to do something like that, so I kept a backup of my own mind, but for reasons I don’t know, it was only updated to a week before Stamford. But it would have to do.”
“I said we already see you as our daughter,” Steve said, completely turned to her, giving her all his attention.
was one of the first things you heard about when you came back from the dead, then you must imagine what public opinion must have said about what the Director of the largest spy agency in the world should know about it.” Tony frowned. “Everyone blamed me for not knowing that the Skrulls were among us and for letting things escalate to the point where they arrived. Besides, those damn green aliens with the weird chin infected my technology, rendered the Extremis useless, making me practically dead weight during the battle against them. Everyone thought I was helping the enemy when, in fact, I was being sabotaged. Add to that the fact that rumors that I had benefited from the Civil War to get rich spread, and that’s it. You have a witch hunt targeting me.”
“Go another thirty yards down the hall and you'll find a passage on the left that leads directly to the Scientist Supreme’s weapon.”
Without restraining himself, Steve started jerking himself, facing that incredible sight. He wanted to eternalize it, draw it, never to forget it.
Tony groaned loudly when Steve's knee brushed his groin. He let his head fall on Steve’s shoulder, and then Tony was pretty sure he really needed it. “Do ... do that again, Steve,
Tony shrugged. “Well, it won’t be overnight, of course.” He took a sip of coffee. “But, yes, why not?” Tony turned to face Steve, who was not wearing anything. The lack of modesty, no shame, Steve comfortable with Tony, just made everything clearer. Tony traced the line from Steve’s chest to his navel and smiled. “In addition, the package comes with some very interesting bonuses.”
handle the idea of touching me, would he? Even more after seeing me like this, debauched, in a deplorable state,
The Avengers were gathered in the meeting room, all seated around the large oval table, holding their tablets with the secret files of S.H.I.E.L.D. brought by Fury on A.I.M., Hydra and the Leader, all part of the main presentation he had left in standby mode on the huge holographic screen at the narrow end of the table.
“What do you have in mind?” Tony asked, still smiling, holding Steve’s cock and lazily stroking him.
"No. But I was the one who taught him how to hack systems undetected. Believe him if he says he can do that."
"Let's see if the rest of you tastes as good as your mouth, baby," Steve groaned and Tony started going down his body, savoring every bit of skin his mouth reached.
“You’re the best thing that ever happened to me. I could draw you now, just like that.” Steve stroked Tony’s face and let his hand go down his arm, until he reached Tony’s hand, which he held, brought to his lips and kissed with adoration. “But I would never be able to put on paper all your nuances, all your complexity, all your beauty, all your perfection, Tony. Nothing I try to do will do you justice.”
Steve smiled kindly and wiped an insolent tear that was streaming down Tony’s face, and that corroded Tony inside. “It’s already gone. It’s over.” Steve squeezed Tony’s arms lightly, reaffirming that everything was fine. “I died and came back. You have lost part of your memory, the most painful, according to yourself. It seems obvious what we have to do here.”
or not Tony would decide to come in to see and talk to Steve, but when. And Steve would wait, because that was what he did. Steve was waiting for Tony. It has always been like that.
Tony hoped he could leave that room with Steve and go somewhere private, preferably his room, or Steve's, he didn’t care for exclusivity in that sense, but instead, Fury made a point of talking to Steve and Natasha after the meeting and Tony got a call from Pepper, as if she knew exactly what time Fury would finish speaking.
"What do you already have?" Tony asked taking a sip of the coffee that room service had brought him. “Let's start with the general parts and then let's focus on the details, okay?”
Tony swallowed. Certainly, Steve could talk more, couldn’t he? Tony thought about what he could say to postpone that part of the conversation. He wasn’t ready.
Out of the corner of his eye, Tony saw that Steve walked over to the bed on his left and sat on the edge, his hands crossed on his legs, his back straight and his gaze fixed on Tony. Tony didn’t move and continued looking at the void, but paying full attention to Steve.
Steve swallowed, but said nothing. Tony took another step toward the girl. Now they were less than six feet from each other.
"Although I'm already counting on some educated refusals," Natasha made an expression of disdain, "by my accounts most of these people will come."
“I see better from up here. And it's far more spacious than any bench." He spread his arms, showing the immaculate, long, wide marble with only Tony occupying a part of the large space.
Eight seconds later, the four of them were outside the A.I.M. base beside the Hulk, watching a large cloud of black smoke and flaming wreckage falling on the ground.
“Ok, Mr. Funny,” Steve said, out of breath. “Your turn.” He opened the buttons on Tony’s shirt, one by one, showing admirable self-control, Tony needed to admit, but letting all of Tony’s control fall to the floor along with his shirt as soon as Steve’s lips reached the curve of Tony’s neck and they followed from there with a trail of wet kisses towards the front of Tony’s body, with no intention of stopping anywhere near.
Tony swallowed. Of course, it had been his idea. He knew Steve didn’t like big events, especially when he was the reason. Even if the big event in question was his funeral. Tony knew what Steve would have preferred; what Steve would have liked. Also, and that was something Tony would never admit out loud, Tony wanted to say goodbye to Steve
Tony opened his mouth to reply, but closed it as soon as he began to consider the implications of that offer. Having the Sorcerer Supreme of the Multiverse owing you a favor was a big thing, really, Tony couldn't deny it. It was an asset he surely didn't have every day. Strange’s smug widened. That bastard knew the power of his bargain.
“Look, you're the exact copy of them. Looking at you two standing still makes it look like as if nothing had happened, but it did.” She stared at Steve and the pain in her eyes surprised him. “I
Tony was taken by surprise. He expected anything but that. Throughout the War, Tony always imagined Steve on the other side wanting Tony’s head on a silver platter, never someone who was - no, scratch that - not someone who
“Looking at you sleeping here in this bed,” Tony continued. “The calmness of our bubble while the city was already frantic, our conversation last night, all of this brought me here, when I had this epiphany,” Tony gestured with his hands and ended with open arms, indicating himself.
"It's not our fault if you didn’t want to see the obvious," Fury shrugged. "My point is, I don’t care about your relationship, okay? As long as it doesn’t disturb your work and my life.”
Tony took a deep breath, trying to organize his thoughts. The great and eloquent Tony Stark, fumbled with his words. Who’d say. "What I meant was that I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable with my comment, that's all," Tony blew out a breath. He felt drained.
"Don’t tell me it should be a holiday. Someone's had this idea before you," Steve smirked and turned to start washing dishes.
"Don't tell me you're the same Steve Rogers who signed the print that is hanging in my office in my apartment, back in New York!" Steve shrugged. "Okay, I won't say it."
“You’re my best friend,” Tony said in a shaky voice. It wasn’t a lie. But it wasn’t the complete truth. But he couldn’t tell the whole truth. He couldn’t reveal that last untouched piece of information, that little piece that was still his alone. As much as it hurt, as much as Tony’s entire body screamed for him to speak the truth, he couldn’t.
“That I wouldn’t change the fact that I ended up here, that I was frozen. I wouldn’t go back there. This is where I should be, where I belong.
Steve and Tony exchanged a look and Tony couldn’t help but smile. Apparently, their versions of the other Earth were also stubborn and slow to reach a consensus. But when it came to something bigger than them, something they loved, it was easy to come to an agreement.
“Oh, my God, that’s why no one can win an argument with you. Look at that beautiful face. How do you do it?”
needed him. No, that would be very selfish. Steve came back because this is simply where he fits in.
"Tell me something that is not impressive when it comes to Tony Stark." Steve kissed the top of Tony's head, who laughed.
The first notes of the song started to play over the speakers and Tony let all the sake he had had that night take care of him, and he just let his voice out, without looking away from Steve at any time.
Steve approached and Tony took a deep breath to control himself as he felt the soldier's warm breath on his ear.
"Don’t be." He smiled. "Sometimes it's better this way, to admire from a distance.” Steve shrugged. "But what about you? You didn’t start this conversation for nothing.”
