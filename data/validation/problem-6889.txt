Steve yanks out his pad, and pounds on the manifest. “I’ll need names.” He fears his hands might be trembling. He knows his face is hot with anger.
“Are you, sir, are you looking for one to satisfy a blood pledge? We have a few of those that are ready to be put down?” Sweat pours off the bureaucrat’s shiny bald head, down his overly large jowls, and puddles on his stained and dirty uniform. It doesn’t look like it’s been washed in an age.
Someone must be out in the hallway because Steve stops and says, “It’s fine, all right.” He’s signing as he’s speaking. “Just a scuffle nothing to worry about. Go rest.” He pauses and bows his head. “You know I’d do anything – just don’t worry about it. I’ll be fine, you know I will.” He waves and then moves to shut the door. When he turns to Tony, he slumps a little against the frame and snaps, “What the hell are you doing here? You don’t come unannounced to my home.”
Tony had to concede that point so he nodded to Natasha. “Wheel the gurney and keep him quiet. He wakes up and thrashes around.”
When they step out onto the main holding floor, Tony sees that the two levels are open to one another. He can spot all of the available Omegas for the warrior blocks. There are stairs to climb to the upper level or the elevator with catwalks to the perimeter that holds the cells. Pep walks to the glass partition of one of the cells and begins to interview the first candidate. The young woman looks well enough and she’s interesting, but she prefers her alpha to be a woman, and Tony respects her wishes. They move through the different cells and the wired knot in his belly jabs as if it has barbs and thorns on it. It feels like nettles.
“I have to prepare you,” Tony said and swallowed down his excitement. The idea of watching Steve, opening Steve up for him sent rivets of excitement through Tony. Gently, Tony angled Steve to get him onto his back.  He tugged down Steve’s pants. “You okay?”
His hackles rose. The flash of Pepper falling and being engulf by the flames blinded him of everything. He blinked several times and took a long swig of his drink. “You know what, you come in here and attack me, for what? What do you want, Natasha? We have better things to do then to rehash the past, like Pepper said.” Inwardly he cringed. Part of him longed for those days, not the glory of the Iron Man, not the cocoon, but the calling. It spoke to him.
Steve nods. He doesn’t ask what Tony thought happened. “Of course, I did. He was trying to assault me.”
Frigga tells them to follow her. Natasha, Gamora, Tony, and Steve quietly leave the cabin. Steve swore there were more of them earlier, but things change here so frequently he’s not sure. He’s not even certain he knows when Gamora arrived or even how he knows her name.
She stands up and goes to the sideboard that’s against the wall of her office. Over it she has an aquarium that’s recessed into the wall. Steve doesn’t know enough about marine biology to name even one of the fish, but as she pours two drinks, she glances at the fish. She pauses and says, “These are dangerous waters you’re wading in, Steve. You have to commit to it, if you’re going to play this game.” She turns around with two tumblers in her hands. She offers one to him.
“Obie, I know you have good intentions, or at least I hope you do, but I’m not backing down. I am not going to declare myself the leader of the whole Conclave. You know the factions won’t have it.” Tony’s voice is calm, collected, and hushed.
He scans the area. Abandoned dilapidated buildings threatening to fall into the water surround him. He should really call Rhodey because if there was ever a fool's errand it’s this one. It's a great set up- isn't it? Get a hooker that looks like his childhood crush, have him work Tony over so much that he falls into a blinded state of love, add in the mysterious friend across the hallway with poor English language skills, seizures, and hearing aids to boot. Plus add in one sick dude that no one ever sees, at least Tony doesn't. The whole thing reeks of set up. Okay, a very elaborate set up, but he is a billionaire. Maybe they're going to kidnap him, beat him, try and ransom him.
Steve looked at Tony. “I just can’t believe it. That this is what we are. That I’m -.” He stopped and then swallowed. “That I’m finally home.”
“Oh, okay,” Steve says and backs into the chair. He drops into it as she leaves. He shouldn’t be here. But he has to admit it’s worlds better than he imagined. He thought it might be something like the Stalls from Medieval times. It’s a relief that it’s not, but at the same time it puts him off balance. It feels more like a spa than a place people are fucking their brains out. He giggles to himself and realizes he’s more nervous that he thought.
Steve licked and nibbled; his own rock hard cock pressed up against Tony's belly. Even after a whole night satisfying his own cravings Tony found it hard not to want more. His tired, spent dick twitched in response.
“But one thrust upon you,” Bruce said and nodded. He calmed down again and Steve wondered at the unpredictability, how Bruce controlled it moment to moment. “I know a little about that. Don’t apologize. I should be complimented that you picked me.”
When they arrived at the royal compound, Natasha’s quinjet had just landed and sirens blared across the grounds. One of the Dora Milaje met them on the steps of the palace and escorted them through the bustling hallways. Guards and Dora Milaje swarmed through the palace. The guards had an emblem of the sun on their chests and walked paired with the Dora Milaje. Steve wondered if they were mates of some of the vampires with the Dora Milaje’s ranks. As they approached the medical wing, Steve caught sight of several floating gurneys being guided through the corridors to the main triage area. Shuri directed the chaotic scene, but as Steve approached he realized that it was more orderly and efficient than it first appeared. Shuri reviewed each of the patients with a doctor or nurse at her side. She assessed and then gave the information to her medical staff. They quickly ushered the gurnies to the required area of the medical bay and began their work to save the patient.
Pierce walked up to him. “Swallow it, my dear Captain. Swallow it or his child dies in front of you.”
“Blame is a powerful word, Buck,” Steve said and folded his hands in front of him. He could ask why Bucky went after the twins or why he never came to Steve after their bond set in place. Instead he let Bucky take the lead.
Tony adjusts the way he’s positioned on the recliner. “Okay.” He’s dubious about this working after all if the implant is malfunctioning nothing that Steve’s going to do should really work for much relief.
In a flash they were making plans to break into Fort Mead to retrieve the FALCON wings. Before they left for the mission, Steve offered his hand to Sam. “I want to thank you.”
Logan ambles over to Steve. Finally, Steve lifts his eyes and sees something, someone in the room. “Well, you need to try and bring on the seizure.”
Tony digs in his tunic but he doesn’t have anything to use. He snaps his fingers twice and the bushes to the right rustle and Happy appears. It’s slightly creepy and funny at the same time. The dry tears on Steve’s face tighten on his skin. He doesn’t feel like he should smile.
Tony raises his hand to halt his objection. “It’s easy enough to do. You don’t know how high society works, Captain. This Schmidt, like every other imbecile in high society, thrives on their connections.” He puts his shoulder against the door frame, all ease and grace and no one would guess he nearly died in this room. “Schmidt wants to make the headlines, he wants Pierce to know he’s someone to be reckoned with. Easy enough to get myself an invite and I’ll bring my party along which will include you.”
“I don’t know why you think I’m one of these Divini,” Steve said. Denying her assertation seemed like the best thing to do. He wanted to deny it all. He just wanted to be human. Yet, it seemed he wanted the impossible and the world conspired against him.
JARVIS lifts the armor off the ground and sends it on a trajectory toward the designated hideaway. When he circles he sees several men come out of caves near the edge of the hilly crags. They have assault rifles and target him. Their aim is generally lousy and Tony picks them off easily – it’s almost sport and that turns Tony’s stomach and he tastes bile.
He swallows down any hesitation or fear. He can do this – he knows he can. This will lead him to a better life. He’ll have food in his belly, and he’ll be able to afford his medications.
Tony looks up to Natasha whose standing near the hearth and she nods. “You arrived in this place we think about 15 years ago.”
“It might take a few months for the gland to be functional again. They were able to use some of your original gland with some starting matrix materials, plus a graft from your leg. It looks good, Steve. Really good.”
Now that was uncalled for – He nearly sent a retort her way, but Bruce cleared his throat and said, “If Tony’s coming here then we have to do something about Barnes and the twins. The memories that Barnes shared with Tony the last time sent him into a spiral. With the twins-.”
Steve spins around trying to wrestle free of Tony’s penetrating gaze. “Seems your security detail got rid of everyone that might sell us some popsicles.” There’s only greenery and gardens and a river with real water in it (Steve thinks) surrounding them.
“Then stop it,” Pep says and he can see in her eyes if he doesn’t at least try she might never trust him, might never respect him again. “Tony, you’re better than this. You know it.”
“Oh, yeah. Right.” He turns to leave, but then he asks, “So Friday, you’ll be here for anything I need?”
He’s not sure if this is a date or not. He nods then realizes Tony’s not wearing the glasses. “Whatever you need, Tony.” It’s the least he can do. He’s made such a mess and with that reporter sniffing around, Steve has to step in the role of protecting Tony and his secret.
Nat didn’t take offense to his reaction but Fury had. He had leaned forward in the booth and glared at Tony with that one angry eye. “What about the fate of the free world do you find funny, Stark?”
Rumlow screams, "This isn't over. Your ass is mine. You goddamned slut, Captain Assfuck."  Somehow he climbs up on the old conveyer belt and riddles the place with bullets. That's when Steve wakes up.
In seconds, though, Steve transformed into not only the leader of their pack, but into the leader of the Avengers – Captain America. “Fury is meeting us with another Quin Jet. We have a jeep and a cycle. Nat and Clint will be in the jeep, I’ll take the cycle. I want full sight of the ground layout by our airborne contingent. Get us real time data and have JARVIS feed it back to the ground. Hill and Fury will stay back and send us updates. Sorry, Bruce, but we need Hulk full out here.”
With that, he leaves the brothel. It should be a victorious moment. To be selected to attend to one of the highest princes in the Conclave is truly an honor. Yet, a cold shiver runs up Steve’s spine and he grits his teeth as they head toward the port. He forces his mind to go over the facts he’s learned about the prince.
“Come on. Did you see they have a juice bar that makes smoothies?” Sam thumbed toward the door behind them.
Obie scoffs and points to DUM-E. "That is state of the art?" He bows his head, shakes it as if he's lost confidence in Tony and then looks up to him and says, "You disappoint me.” Tony hates that it matters to him what the man thinks. “What are you doing, boy? Why aren't you in California?  We need you at the R & D division. Hiding here? That's not good for anyone, especially your investors or the Board."
“Like he couldn’t make no gravity all the sudden?” It’s a strange dichotomy, how sweat drips down his back, yet the sensation in his face disappears from the cold.
He gets the wires out without any issue. He finds a small pocket knife on the bench, too small to be an effective weapon but good enough to be a tool. Clutching it he concentrates on his task. He puts it in the flames, warming it in order to sterilize it. For a second he thinks he should burn the infected flesh in Tony’s gaping wound, but then the pain might put him into shock and Steve is ill equipped to deal with that.  Once he allows the blade to cool, he goes back to his impromptu operating table, leaning over Tony and lowering the blade.
“I don’t know Tony-.” He doesn’t get a chance to finish, the roar echoing through the valley stops him. Hulk scrambles to his feet again and stomps up the hill. The meter deep snow doesn’t deter him at all.
Steve shook his head. “Not exactly? But I got a certain feeling, a tugging here.” He placed a hand on his chest. “Felt like you were falling into a chasm.”
“Yeah, I kept refusing. Like some kind of idiot.” He laughed, but the chuckle possessed no joy. The tone inferred derision. “Got myself a good case of pneumonia after I stayed in the flat and had to pick between paying the rent and paying for heat.”
He hated to tell people they were out of a job. “We’re going to survey the situation and then our plans are to decommission the site. We’ll transfer those personnel to other sites if possible.”
“Yes. My transcripts are right in the second pocket of the portfolio.” He reaches to the binder and tugs at the paper for Tony. “I also have a thumb drive-.”
“He should, the way he’s talking back,” Pep whispers to Tony. She bends close to Tony and mutters, “He’ll be more trouble than he’s worth. Leave him. We can find another omega.”
It wasn’t Natasha, but Pepper. He wondered how long he’d ‘slept’. He didn’t get out of the bed but called, “Coming.”
Natasha narrowed her focus on him as if she drilled into his head. He tried to shut her off, trying not to feel the connection. She dove in twisting along the tendrils tying Tony to the pack. He saw the realization, the subtle way she closed her eyes and steadied herself before she looked at him without emotion again.
He’s staring up at the ceiling and can’t move. He thinks he might be remembering something that he heard or something he read once. “I don’t know what you mean about a prime pairing.”
If Tony didn’t know better, Steve sounds absolutely forlorn like a lost dog. He drops some of the old wires he clutches, stands up, hits his head on the side of the crate, curses, and then says, “Coming up soon.”
Tony shrugs and can’t think of a reason not to have dinner in front of the fire that wouldn’t point out his crush. “Okay.” He heads over to the fireplace and restarts the fire; first by cleaning up the ashes from earlier and then by stacking and arranging the kindling. The fire flares and spits a little as Tony moves the logs around in the hearth.
“Do it!” Tony commanded, and Rogers flinched. Tony reached out to touch the Captain but he cringed against it as if he knew by instinct, moving closer to Rumlow.
She takes the sample and then leaves. Tony observed her silently from the opposite side of the bed. He watched the flow of the red blood into the small test tube. It spurted it and then flowed filling up the tube. Blood isn’t red, not like a stop sign. It’s a deep abiding color that flirts with black. Black like the abyss of space. A shiver runs up Tony’s spine and he steps to the bed.
Tony grips the bow and puts the quiver of arrows at his knee. All the constructs of the Barton family turn to watch, assessing Tony’s skill with a bow. This isn’t a necessary skill, especially since the gauntlet is on display. It’s obvious that Tony wanted the gauntlet shown to warn off Ultron. But what damage could he do in a virtual reality.
Sam raises his eyebrow at that statement. “I’m surprised, Fury can be a hard one to deal with, but he sees the reality-.”
Into Steve’s shoulder, Tony whispers, “I’m sorry, too. I hacked SHIELD years ago, I could have found out about Hydra. I didn’t look deep enough and then when the huge data dump happened, I got curious. I found out about Barnes and never said a word.”
“Please release me,” Steve says through gritted teeth. He scans the room and sees no one is paying any attention to them. “Now.”
He laughs, a small almost silent sound. “Well, I’m sure he is, too. But I was talking about Tony. He’s very fond of you.”
Tony joins the dance and spreads out to make his own angel. “Well, you’re not fooling anyone, Rogers. You have a Kryptonite. Everyone does.”
“JARVIS, what time-.” He had to stop, swallow down the saliva and bile, and start again. “What time is it?” JARVIS didn’t answer. That couldn’t be good. He reached for the bed, hoisted himself up, and then sat there, panting for several minutes as if he’d just had an asthma attack. He blinked a few times, trying to focus, but the world kept pixelating around him. Even after a few days, the blood loss plagued him. How much had Tony drank?
Steve stood there as Tony walked away, hand to his hair and messing it as he left. He turned to T’Challa to voice his appreciation for the safe harbor, but T’Challa quieted him with a look and ushered him to a private room. T’Challa closed the door behind him. The small but cozy room was filled with relics and art of the country’s history. Steve had always been a history buff and imagined immersing himself in the art, finding out about its lineage, where it came from, who made it, how it was made. The colors alone fascinated him. He needed to get back to Tony so he turned his attention to the king.
Cupping Tony’s cheek, Steve leans in and kisses him. “There’s nothing to be sorry about.” He offers another kiss. “Is there anything I can do to help you get ready?”
Rumlow gave a short jaunty bow. “Anything for the boss.” He turned on his heel. “We got an observation room. It’s this way. I’ve tried to update all the equipment in it. But I’m not an IT guy. So, excuse that little issue. O4 knows we watch it. It keeps pretty quiet during the day. At night some times it hums to itself. Or scratched on the walls.”
“I saw a video that implied, strongly, that Bucky was involved in your parents’ deaths. It was when Nat and I found Zola and the data banks.” Steve forced his eyes to land on Tony then, because he deserved the disdain, the hatred, the disappointment. What he found had been profound disbelief and pain.
“Sorry? Sorry for what? Loving me? Or sorry for fucking me over. You never told me. I thought you hated me. I thought I had nothing left.”
Tony snarls at her. “Do you even know what he’s talking about? The token? That’s him. Red Skull is going to be pissed to the gills that his prize, Captain America and his nemesis, is enlightened, has gone through the Revelation.”
Without a word, Steven stretched out comfortably next to him. Tony fit nicely against him. Steven wore a tunic and trousers while Tony wore his father’s robe only. After long minutes together, Steven said, “There used to be a psychological theory that abductees and victims often begin to feel trust and a sense of belonging and caring with their captors.”
“Or I could hang you from my rack and have my crew fuck you to show that you’re submissive to anyone and everyone I saw,” Tony retorts and his anger boils to the surface.
“None of that, I’m gamey enough,” Tony chuckles, but he hugs Blu close. He knows that things will be different; he’ll be seen as not sane, crazy. None of it matters. All that matters is that they stay together.
“What’s leftover? Posh! You are right in the thick of it!” Tony teases and Steve swears he’s only doing it to see him blush.
“And if you did, you’d be in the same position we’re in. Don’t be fooled, darling. What’s happening to us is bigger than you think.”
He met her gaze. For the longest time since she entered his life he could only manage words like “inscrutable” and “powerful” to describe her. Now, as she clasped his hand, different images of her came to mind. Softer images. Visualizations of her speaking in low tender tones, wise and gentle filtered through to him. He knew those were not his memories and it scared the hell out of him that these people – these strangers – had access to his mind. His most private thoughts were no longer his own. He shivered like a cold breeze hit him. He wanted to tug his hand away, rush off from the hospital, get back in his armor, and leave. Escape. The idea they were in his head, rummaging around, plucking at his thoughts, his hopes, his desperation, his nightmares roiled him until the noise around him, the chaos around him avalanched over him. He put his hands over his face, trying to block them out. He needed safety, away from this- away from all of them.
“You love me, but you’re not in love with me. Not the way you should,” Logan says. “I’ve been around long enough to know the difference.” He reaches up as if he’s trying to pull out a cigar from his mouth, but there isn’t any. He fists his hands instead and lets them drop to his lap. “You and me, we might be good for a while, but you want things – things I don’t want anymore. I’ve seen too much of humanity, known too much about it, to ever really want to know more. You see humanity at its best or see its potential. I’m not there. I see the flip side. Maybe we’re opposites in that way, and maybe that’s part of the attraction for you.”
“Only so much as was required for the eating contest with Master Parker,” Jarvis says, the disdain in his voice isn’t quite as convincing as he obviously wants it to be.
Tony felt the tears run down his own face and he frowned before he replied, “It’s not your fault.” It hurt to say it, to admit it. Logically Tony knew it was true, every damned word of it. But it was still hard not to have someone physically to blame. “It’s not your fault. There’s nothing-.” He shook as he said, “There’s nothing to forgive.” It was true. Every word of it. But it hurt so much like a knife to his soul. They stood there, holding onto one another like anchors against the storm.
Steve squeezes Tony’s hand. “We’re a team. It’s us. You were right the first time. We need to be more open about what’s coming down the pike, our fears. When we get back, we’ll have a brainstorming session to see what the senior team thinks. What we should do – but I think our best asset is still people, Tony. Avengers on one side of the country, in one little pocket in the world-.”
He grips the reins tighter in his hands, urging his mount forward. The poor beast spits and hisses at him; it knows the dangers of the Forsaken Pass. Taking the ravine is fool’s play – the Silver Knight knows this – but with his escape route cut off his choices are few.
“No, I won’t,” Steve said. “I’ll still be me. The same guy kicking himself for wasting so much time with you. The same guy wondering about everything that goes on in that head of yours. The same guy madly in love and kind of embarrassed about how much of my brain power is consumed thinking about you.”
“Wow, that was vivid,” Tony said and sat up only to hold his head. “I feel a little drunk. Did we drink?”
Tony looks at Bruce, looks at how familiar they are to one another. Bruce has been living in the Tower since the Battle of New York. Steve’s only just returned. How could they feel anything other than simple infatuation at this point?  Yet, the idea of losing Steve to this medical condition or to Logan grips Tony in the chest like a vice and tightens so that the arc reactor wants to pop out of his chest. Tony rubs at the casing of the arc reactor.
“I hope the stew is good. It’s my mother’s recipe,” Steve says and cups his bowl with his large hand. “This is nice. The fire. The wind is terrible out, but I think it stopped snowing.”
He watches the two items bubble and bump around in the pot and then thinks about the nanite solution. It would be so much easier. He taps his implant and whispers the contact registration number. In seconds he’s connected.
Steve turned and looked at the ridge of Tony’s muscular arm, the curve of his hip. He remembered the feel, the weight of Tony on top of him. He shivered with the idea of Tony’s kisses.
“Lots, Hydra isn’t backing down. We think they’re going to announce something soon. They have a lot of power with water rights. And we also have Hammer and AIM starting to send signals as well.” Coulson remains calm, almost robotic in his dissertation of events. “The problem? We’re getting word that one of them or all of them have a hit out on Stark.”
Steve zipped his bag closed. “Yeah. I know you don’t like the idea, but we need to find the rest of the pack.”
Tony sighs, large and slow, as if his whole body needs release. “I wish.” He stops and closes his eyes. Steve’s not sure if he glimpses a tear leaking from the corners. “I think I want to rest. Sleep for a while. Okay?”
Steve glances up at him. “He had attributes of an alpha, he had attributes of a beta, he had attributes of an omega. His alpha fugue turned into a rage that could only be explained as if it was a warrior’s rage. He was blinded to everything and everyone.”
“Excuses, excuses,” Steve says with a half cocked smile. Even as he teases Tony, Steve relaxes his bent legs.
“I drank from him,” Tony whispered. He hated to admit it. “I didn’t know any better.” Or did he? In wraith form, he’d watched his corpse crawl across the floor to the source of food.
The rest of the evening consisted of working out strategies, operations, tactics, and finally getting a list together of all the supplies needed. While Clint, Natasha, and Hill worked on that, Tony sent notice to JARVIS to get the cleaning crew out to the farm to collect all the Legion robot pieces. He still wasn’t happy about Hulk’s tendency to smash things, but he had to admit their war games helped coalesce not only the team but also the pack. Though he didn’t really know the difference. Once he was assured that the Iron Legion would be in safe hands, Tony joined the team for dinner. Steve sat quietly next to him. Both mentally and emotionally Steve emitted a reserved demeanor.
Through her summary, the high pulsing need to be with Steve thrummed through Tony. He swallowed down the acrid bile and frowned. Outwardly he jerked in surprise of the clear pain.
Tony clasped Steve’s hand and that caused Steve to bring his line of sight to him. Tony brought Steve’s hand to his lips. He kissed the knuckles. “Mine, too.” He quirked a brow. “If I don’t count all those adolescent daydream fantasies.”
“You always dream too big, Stevie.” That what Bucky would say, and now Steve was dreaming about Tony, thinking about his hands on his face, his knee touching Tony’s leg. God, it was like a Victorian romance novel. All those subtle touches and none of the get down to business doing the nasty. Bucky and Sam would be amused. And thus, is the reason he hasn’t shared as much with them.
Once they turn down the landing and go down the next few steps, they enter the main office of the local town jail. It’s cramped and small. He notes the jail is empty when he peers into the rooms in the back of the building. Thor must have convinced Clint not to arrest him last night. The Odinson brothers are renown for their rowdy and loud parties, especially now since Thor is sweet on the local teacher, Jane Foster.
They left the room and Bruce lingered at the doorway only to slip out as well. Tony stood there, a meter from the bed but his feet felt like lead. Moving through his hesitation robbed him of any courage. Thank fuck that Steve was still out of it. The machines hooked up to him chirped along, showing a strong heartbeat. Yet the pain radiated from him, through the bond as if even in slumber the agony persisted.
A disturbed expression crosses Jamison’s face but he agrees to do his duty, like any faithful member of Tony’s clan. Jamison is an alpha and still he obeys while Steven does not. Everyone must know their place, especially Tony’s warrior omega.
“Please Captain, please help him.” She’s weeping for her husband. It’s right out of a novel. Ultron’s learned human emotions, how to manipulate them, but not how to feel them.
“I don’t know, Steve! For fuck’s sake, are we really talking about this instead of our game plan?” Tony removes his hand from Steve’s leg. “We have to be on the same page.”
“So, you say that Captain Steve Rogers through some effect of the tesseract had been transformed into a lion and survived the years-.”
Pepper grimaces and then says, “We’ve discussed it, Captain Rogers, and we believe it would be for the best if you were to leave Tony’s employment immediately.”
Even Steve spots that he’s lying.  He can’t help himself when he clears his throat and says, “Prince Anthony, perhaps before we discuss the more delicate nature of politics, you’d like some afternoon refreshments and a meal?”
“I don’t give a shit,” Tony said and the surprise on Bruce’s face should have stopped him. Nothing could stop him now, not even the Hulk. “I gotta get out of here.”
He won't give it up and he'll be damned if he's going to leave Steve behind in this hell. “Stevie, I can’t get this damned thing off.” He wishes he could remove the caps over Steve’s eyes – at least let him see the light, Bucky’s face, anything to show him that this nightmare is ending. He can’t get his fingers between the mesh of the wire to remove them. That’s when Redwing flutters down next to Bucky and then hops over to Steve’s side, bobbing along his hand and then pushing at it.
“You don’t trust me,” Tony whispers. He wants to mourn this truth. He’s done nothing to earn Steven’s trust. He’s punished and beaten him – he – took Steven against his will.
The whole sequence of events in the apartment across the hall unsettles Tony. He ends up helping Nat with Clint as the man groggily comes out of the episode. They get Clint to bed and while Tony would like to ask about the meds and doctors he decides against it. Steve might be a better avenue. Something happened. Something bad. To all of them. The pieces of the puzzle don't fit, not yet. He needs time to work on it. Since he's only just returned from California he suspects Stane won't be on his ass to get more upgrades to the Jericho. It's in beta tests now out in the Nevada desert. It will take time to get the reports. Tony's whole focus over the next few weeks will be to tease out as much as he can with Steve and his friends.
Tony stops him. “And maybe I also told her I want blonde, blue eyes, strong jaw. That’s my favorite. Told her I wanted a guy who knew what he wanted in life. No one too young - how old are you anyway?”
“Yeah. I do.” Steve glares at Tony. He’s not sure why but something heated burns in his chest, a challenge, a test. “You want me to recite it, right now?”
“I mean this isn’t the worse place to get stuck. It’s gorgeous and look at the view!” Steve points to the wide sliding glass doors that open to the wooden deck. Beyond the deck rolling hills and pine trees dot the landscape. It’s a veritable winter wonder land and Tony hates it. Meanwhile Steve’s digging in his duffle bag and bringing out sketchbooks and graphite pencils. “I haven’t sketched in an age. This is perfect for it.”
"Tell me, dear, I'm getting too old and not as bright as I used to be." She smiles and there's something lonely in her eyes.
After that slight, Obie slaps him on the back, gives him a list of need to do operations for the weapons research, and then shows himself out. Tony glares at the door to the lab space. The empty hallway to the upstairs is just a blot of darkness. He turns back to the screens, to his interface and throws up his hands to access the information on Captain America. It's everything in the public records.
“It’s okay. I’m sorry I have to push you so much to remember. It’s just that we don’t have a lot of time anymore. We need you to help us. You and me – you see – you and me are the only ones who’ve been touched by all of the stones. Most of the others only ever really interacted with one, possibly two.”
Clint also known as the Hawk of the Sentinel Guardians turns to them from the pilot seat. Over the roar of the engines he yells, "We got bogeys coming in. Brace for impact."
“That’s tricky,” Steve replies, deciding to go with the flow rather than against it. “Ultron might have more working knowledge than we do in some cases.”
“It shouldn’t be a problem now, but it is.” Strange pulls up images on the computer. Steve has no idea what he’s looking at as the doctor changes the views. “If we go in again, I’m worried we’ll do significant damage to the surrounding tissue. This is your brain, Tony. This isn’t some game. We’re not playing Operation.”
Tony frowns. He hadn’t realized so much time had passed but when he looks at his phone – it’s been over an hour. The job is done; he’s just been playing around with the connections. “Yeah, Coming right up.”
“Not courting, Rogers, you’re not courting anyone,” Steve says and straps on the holster. He grabs for his duster and realizes it's a mess. It's not like he's able to clean it regularly, doing his laundry isn't something he enjoys, takes the whole damned day. He supposes he can deal with the chill and tosses the coat back, but then picks it up anyway. He shrugs it on and goes down the staircase.
There’s a drafting table and a cart with supplies next to it. The wall that’s shared with the lab has shelving that’s filled with every art supply or tool in any catalogue. On the other side of the door, the wall has the digital art set up. It’s so much more than Steve has ever had. There’s even a small room to the side with a sink to clean brushes. When Steve ventures inside he finds another room – a small bathroom with a sink, toilet, and shower. He can’t believe the finishes – all metal and marble. It’s a weird combination but somehow works. When he steps back into the main art room, Tony’s leaning against the door.
“You do realize your making their argument for them, right?” Pepper pats his hand. “Tell me your social security number.”
He situates Steve onto the bank of the river and checks out the opposite side. The fortress partially collapsed into the one side and there are troopers starting to emerge. The air defense has picked up but he doesn’t spot Sam anywhere. Fighters zoom through the air – they remind him of the tie-fighters of old but the design differs in that the central cockpit or pod isn’t a hexagonal rounded shape but more oval like an egg and it looks like its hinged, and can swing and rotate on an axis. What it means is that Steve and Bucky are sitting ducks out on the uncovered riverbank. He either has to pick Steve up again and dash to the woods for cover or hope that Clint isn’t over estimating his time to pick up.
The idea to send Steve back into the Soul Keep is passed around but decided that it is too dangerous. Due to his enlightenment his once blue eyes transformed to red as soon as he accepted the truth. If the Red Skull glimpses him for even a moment, he will be damned to the Chambers Below to be fed on by the Skull for all eternity. That choice condemns them all to this Realm and no passage beyond toward what comes next.
He has to be on a ship with this man for days, while Tony shares a cabin with Tiberius. He needs to get his reactions under control.
Over the next hour, the team went through the details of the data and intel. Tony worked on setting up all of the robot heads to display the different categories of the data. Maps, guard read outs and schematics floated above the table. In addition, Hill supplied more information on the twins, and it looked grimmer and grimmer. Their home had been bombed and their parents died in front of them. The weapons? Stark made. The revelation crashed into Tony like a brick in the face. He hadn’t expected that especially since he’d been out of the weapon manufacturing business for years. The fact remained though that within the last decade Stark Industries had sold weapons of mass destruction that were used in altercations all over the world. How much more was he and his company responsible for? Bile bubbled up in the back of his throat and for a second the projected plans before him blurred as he tried to blink the tears away.
Fuck, that was the least of the guards’ worries. “I’m calling in the authorities,” Tony said. He tugged out his phone and still Rumlow did nothing. He stood there, stock still and smirked at Tony. This was so much worse than Tony realized. He considered Rumlow and his stone expression. Right now, Tony needed to focus so he went to Pepper, leaving the guard to his own devices as he punched in the call to the Air Force. No signal. The call failed.
Steve strains. Arms on each side of Tony, his gaze concentrating on him. He opens his mouth and exhales with each thrust. Tony curls his legs around Steve, holding him in place. He reaches up and brings him close, seeking in his eyes what’s always there- unquestionable loyalty, deep love, and constant commitment. He fully and completely kisses Steve. In his ear he whispers his love and Steve sobs out, his rhythm goes erratic and he stretches away from Tony, slamming into him. He bites his lip and then shivers as he waits.
Steve spins on his stool and leans back to see if he can catch sight of Jarvis. “How do you know? Is that one of -.” He stops. “How can you tell?”
“Hawkeye, but you can call me Clint.” He reaches around with his scanner and checks Steve’s id. “Welcome to the Widow’s Brothel. I’m the guard around here. If anyone so much as a sneezes on you, you call me. Also, Thor but he’s a big softie and just likes to sit around with everyone and tell stories of his glory days.”
“That’s precious,” Stark says as Jarvis brings in the meal. There’s biscuits and plates of bacon, a large dish of scrambled eggs, and fried potatoes. “Not much fruit around here, did you notice that Sheriff? I like blueberries. We have to get some bushes planted, Jarvis.”
“Now I know you’re hurt,” Bucky says as Steve drops off, slowly, hearing Bucky curse as he falls into the deep slumber of the wounded.
Steve studies it. It’s the way across in the best of times. “Yep, let’s get this done. The horses can take the current, but you gotta hold them steady. Don’t let them have their head, they’ll spook too easily.”
Tony raises his hands in a sign of peace. It does open his palms to allow him to use the repulsors at any time, but the villagers don’t know that little fact. “I mean you no harm. I’m looking for someone.”
“You would have to do at the same exact time. I’m afraid that’s impossible considering you are two separate beings,” Vision says. “Humans are not that precise.”
“And you’re still the same sick bastard I met six years ago.” The memories of the rooftop crucifixes hit him, and he nearly let out a cry for Tony. How many times had he gone up to the rooftop over the years? He’d worked with Fury to release as many of the innocent vampires he’d could from the crosses. He secreted them away. There had been failures over the years and times he couldn’t save all of them and he still hated himself for those he lost, but he’d tried.
“We might end up working through the night, Steve. I promised you the Observatory. Again, I won’t be able to take you!” Tony throws his hands up in the air and marches away from Steve. “It’s always this. Always.” He mutters a curse and then looks at Steve again. “I know I have such privilege and such wealth. I know that I have to pay it back, pay it forward, but I need-. I need.”
Steve only shakes his head. “I don’t know about that- I know that I’m not allowed to be with you like this. I’m not allowed to touch you like this.” He strokes his hands down Tony’s chest, along the ridges of scar tissue to the tender muscles of his belly, and then to his groin. He licks his lips and then swallows as he touches Tony’s erection.  “I want to taste you, can I taste you, please?”
As he awaited Steve’s arrival, Tony turned his focus toward getting the word to Natasha. Finding her was a near to impossible task. He went down to his workshop on the lower levels with its large array of computers. The one wall came alive when he entered, and holographic screens encased him as he stepped up to the platform. He asked JARVIS to search and find Natasha. Vampires had their own secret internet set up. They didn’t call it anything as ridiculous as the dark web or the blood web. They just named it for what it was. Freedom. He sent out a call, asking for her to get to his safehouse as soon as possible. If Bruce was right and Ross was actually after immortality and found a way to secure it, they were worse off than just zombie land. Ross wouldn’t only want to harvest the glands of vampires for his diabolical experiment but he would need to capture vampires and keep them alive in order to make new vampires to harvest the glands. It was sick and gross and Tony shook as he rotated the holographic search parameters for Natasha.
“You took a lot on your shoulders, Tony. You never wanted others to help you, but they were always there.” Steve leads the way to the diner as Tony clutches his bicep.
“We will go through the basic Soul Mantras. From there you will begin to comprehend the astral bondings.” Wong closed his eyes and Steve side eyed Natasha. Were they supposed to follow suit? He had no idea. She nodded to him. With his eyes shut, Steve listened to Wong continue his lessons. “Lessons are simple. Learning is long. It is in the practice that you learn, not the teachings. Now the Soul Mantra you will practice is:
With nothing else to say, Steve takes his leave. He finds his way back to the vestibule and Natasha waits for him. Her eyes are cynical and her stance rigid.
Is damaged – and there’s not a damned thing Tony can do about it. That’s what irks him. He’s a mechanic, an engineer, he fixes things. It’s in his nature. He can’t do a damned thing to help Steve. Even if this situation was closer to normal circumstances – say that Steve would allow him to help – Tony begins to doubt that he can. A drug addict cannot find a way to solve the problem unless the addict admits it. Steve thinks he’s only doing it for the benefit of others. Tony knows better.
“Thanks, that would be good, that would be great,” Tony says, but there’s a shiver that runs up his spine and he cannot figure it out. He knows Rhodey; they’ve been best pals since college days. Other than Pepper, Tony trusts him. Sure, there’s Happy, he trusts Happy, but not like this, not like Pepper. He trusts Rhodey.
The words comfort and, while the tension remains, he settles enough that Banner can examine the wound without fear of being thrown off by a raging patient.
Tony puts a slight pressure inside of him, as if he’s opening his fist just slightly. It catches Steve’s breath, emptying his lungs of air. He gulps and jerks. “Please.” Full tears stream across his face and he knows now he’s always starved for this moment – this moment that fills him and torments him all at the same time.
After, Tony sits with Steve as he sleeps. He works silently on his phone, querying JARVIS on matters concerning the whole sorted affair. He inputs all of the information he's gleaned from both Steve's babbling and from Clint. It will take some time but he knows he's onto something and he's not one to give up.
“It’s been refitted actually. It has a third deck of quarters for guests and crew,” Steve says. With that statement, Tony shares a smile with Steve as if they are school boys and have pulled one over on their teacher.  He returns his smile and it feels good and he chastises himself for that small victory.
Natasha’s expression softens and she comes to him, going up on tiptoes to kiss his cheek. “We never meant for you to be trapped with him for years. We did try, Steve.” She squeezes his hands.
They sit down to eat; Tony strategically waiting for Steve to see if he prays or anything before dinner. In the confines of the Tower or the new Avengers’ campus, Tony never saw Steve in the actual act of prayer, but since they are being open with each other he might do it now. He doesn’t.
The pheromones leaking from Steven’s gland drift heavy in the air. He wants to drink from the gland so much that his knees nearly buckle as he tries to resist. For his part, Steven arches his neck and looks away. It is a biological response, nothing more. Tony collapses to his knees and pulls Steven toward him, drinking the elixir, tasting the sweetness while the salt from his own tears taint it.
Fear rolls over him. He hasn’t felt this terrified since he saw Tony gunned down, since he watched Tony blow off Bucky’s arm. He grabs the edge of the sink and rides through the agony of terror. Closing his eyes, he tries to center himself. This is the right thing to do. Clear away the problem, the issue. How can two alphas fight over him if he’s not an omega anymore? Steve knows that Tony can see himself clear of what Hydra did to Bucky and possibly even forgive him for his parents’ death. But the battle between the two for dominance over Steve, for possession of Steve as their omega warrior… This is the only way out of that mess.  For everyone concerned. He inhales deeply, exhales. He tries not to remember, but how can he not? How can he not remember the anger and the frustration and the sorrow all mixed into one horrible barbed ball in his gut?
Bullets ping against the armor. It takes too long for JARVIS to stabilize the thrusters and calculate the load, but they get in the air, wobbling as they do. The lion goes slack in his arms. “Freeze arms, JARVIS.”
“Yes, sir.” Steve held his ground; he’d never been ashamed of his status even when bullies beat him for it and Bucky intervened to stop it.
“He’s been better, but that doctor of Mister Stark’s been by to see him. He’s stronger and that’s good.” She pats the quilt. “Now, off with you, I need to finish up my stitching on this other one I’m sewing.”
"He has been under the influence of the Sith Lord for too long," Jedi Scholar Peggy had said, her dark eyes mournful but firm.
“Well, hello Captain.” Sam winks at him and Steve instantly relaxes. He smiles, laughing a little at his stunned silence. “That’s better. Now can I interest you in some wine?” He lifts a bottle and glasses.
Maybe some sleep would help him. He couldn’t remember when the last time he’d actually went to bed and slept for any time at all. He didn’t call for JARVIS to turn on the lights as he lie on the bed. Instead, he curled the covers around him and listened to the darkness. In the shade of the night, he heard footfalls and then the wind. There shouldn’t be wind at the penthouse level. But still he heard the wind and the patter of rain as if it was outside his windowsill. He looked to the windows and saw a fire escape that shouldn’t be there. Even as he sat up and stared at it, his bedroom door – that was not his bedroom door – creaked open.
She snickers. “I’m not talking about whether or not you screwed up. I’m talking about the fact you called me and not Rhodes or Pepper.”
The pain constricted Steve’s chest and he blinked away the tears. “No.” In a whisper, Steve murmured, “Not today.”
He pauses as they stagger to the beach, feeling the sun rays on his face for the first time in months and it reminds him of other places beyond the Boundaries.
He’s Tony Stark and he can’t leave well enough alone. Because none of it is well enough and he’ll be damned if he’s going to let whatever hell has surfaced on Earth continue. He makes promises to Steve not to interfere.
“In order to get to the Gravity bowl, we need to fly under the station. Surely, you’ve been to matches before?” Tony eyes him and then it dawns on the prince. “You’ve never been to the bowl before? On any station?”
“Frigga – Thor’s mother?” It’s falling into place now. He ended up in this strange purgatory and the Soul Keeper stole his soul and committed him to battle against the enemy – the enemy is truth. The enemy is free will. Steve brings a shaking hand to his brow. “How many have I killed in his righteous war against you? How many have I imprisoned for him?” He knows the numbers and it digs a hole in his chest.
“I don’t – I calculated it. Figured it out. Sure,” he says and recognizes the doubt in his own tone. “You pulled me out twice. We didn’t need the exit Door – not really.” That’s not true. Not if they wanted a fully successful mission. The exit Door needs to be used to pass through and lock Ultron – his essence away from the internet and humanity. The exit Door serves both as a passage and a cage. “Steve protected me while I did the calculations. The Hub wasn’t a virtual reality that had the same character as the rest. The rest of them were like a video game- setting, place-.” He gets nauseous, closes his eyes. He puts a hand over his face. “Crap.”
“Through the pine trees, yes,” Steve says. He shuffles on his feet a few times. “Are you okay? I mean can you do this?”
“That would be good. Actually great,” Steve said. He glanced at the team. “Natasha learned how to partner with Clint. He brought her into SHIELD. Clint might be a good resource to figure out how to bring the team together.”
Leaning down, Tony kisses the inner crook of his neck. “That was wonderful.” He kisses his temple, his forehead, his eyes. “Stay?”
Before he scuttled away, Tony caught him and said, “I want you to know, I remember everything from the dreamscape. I know who you are. I meant what I said.”
“I know,” Steve said. “I saw them when I first came out of the ice.” His smile had dropped then as he sat in the bed with the tray over his lap. They were in their mating honeymoon. They hadn’t left the bed for three days; they’d spent it in each other’s arms. “When Fury told me what had happened. How the Vampire Wars had decimated what hadn’t been scorched from WWII, I couldn’t believe it. All that progress gone.”
“How’d you-.?” And that’s when Tony sees the faded mark across Steve’s shoulder; there’s a split in his t-shirt and a welt the size of the butt end of a gun. He also notices the telltale signs of bruises on his jaw and fingerprints on his neck. “Turn around and lift your shirt.”
“Go then. Do that,” Steve says and notices the sheets strewn all over the floor. Tony grunts and drools and then clenches his teeth as if he’s fighting his own body. Slowly the seizure ends, and Steve catches a pillowcase and brings it over to wipe away the spittle. Tony flops back and his sightless eyes roam the room. Steve keeps talking. “I’m right here, Tony. You’re not alone. Do you feel my hand? I’m right here.”
The knife Rumlow pulled out of his vest pierced Steve’s gut. He hissed and went to this knees as he heard Tony scream
“Sam,” Steve said as he offered a hand. Sam grasped it. “You’re in Wakanda, a nation that is sympathetic to the vampire cause. I – We were able to heal you of your wounds.”
Tony placed his stuffed animal to the side and scanned the table of contents. A section of the book covered localities and folk stories that originated during the war. He flipped through the book as Jarvis and Ana settled down next to him, peering over his shoulder. It took a while to find anything about Blu. But he finally did. It was only a quarter of a page including a grainy photo. Due to the quality of the black and white photograph Tony barely made out the image of a full grown African male lion standing in a small fishing village surrounded by snow. Behind the lion, the icy waters of Norwegian Sea. A man named Johan Pedersen had been interviewed by the book’s authors:
“It’s not an infection,” Steve says and he can barely keep his eyes open. He needs to, though, he has to explain to Tony. “Need to get to the water.”
“No,” Tony says because he knows, he knows deep and true that Steve is not some made up figment of his imagination. Steve is real, flesh and blood and Tony feels his breath in the pit of his soul. It struggles and grapples as if it might be the last. Tony cannot give up now, not now, not when he knows this might be the last time he can search for his lost soul.
Gathering up his strength, Tony flung himself toward the side of the building. He would rather die by his own accord and his own choosing than by their hands. Or live in that horrifying state of hell. The sun and the wood contaminant in his system took him down long before any of the agents even bothered to move. They knew what they were doing. They’d done this so many times before. And then he thought of Steve – Steve knew about this horror. He knew the nightmare and he never confessed to Tony. Part of him hated Steve at that moment. Hated him because he never warned Tony, never told him what humans were actually capable of – but then it faded as he realized that Steve had protected Tony time and again. Keeping him away from the V-Corps wandering eyes, stopped them from trailing his interactions with the human world. Who knew what other things Steve had done in his time as a V-Corps member. Had he ever been assigned this duty? To nail a vampire to a cross?
“Meeting’s in five minutes, boss. Keep your pants on. You could go and look at your pretty omega. I have to say he’s looking fine. Jo-Jo’s swooning.”
“Thanks for the shower, big guy.” Tony laughs as he heads toward the water’s edge. He’s still in his undershorts and is about to yank them off when Blu lets out a thunderous roar. Tony stumbles and falls backward onto the muddy shore. He curses as Blu leaps out of the water and knocks him down, practically squashing him to the ground. Tony struggles to push the big animal off when Blu snarls again and then cries out. He jolts up and relieves Tony of his weight but whips his head back and forward. That’s when Tony catches sight of it. A large viper in Blu’s mouth. The big cat clenches down on it, piercing it in half in one bite. The dead viper drops into the stream, blood swirls around it, the eddies of the current turning red.
In the shower he leaned against the wall and thought of Bucky in the dream. Was it the real Bucky? Is that what Bucky thought of him? Would think of him once he confessed? The dream space with Tony had prepared him for his transition, for the acceptance of who he was – but now it was just a nightmare of what he would confront when he saw Bucky again. “Shit.” He cried then. He didn’t want anyone to see him or hear him. For God’s sake he was Captain America – but the soul bond was a curse and hurt him time and again. The cold of the tile did nothing to take away the fact he denied so much, but at the same time he’d forgotten who he was – who he grew up to be. He put his hands over his face letting the water pound down on him.
It doesn’t matter because Tony grasps Steve’s arms, harsh and needy. Steve reaches between them, stroking his hand up and down the prince’s erection. He flicks it near his entrance and Tony shudders so much that it delights Steve, and he lets out his own cry of need. A final tease and then Steve positions himself, relaxing and taking it all in until the prince’s buried in him.
“But what if he didn’t?” Happy says. He halts nearly causing Steve to collide with him. He puts up his finger and repeats, “What if he didn’t?” It’s all ominous and ridiculous in Steve’s book but the serious expression on Happy’s face stops him from objecting.  “Ah! See. Now you’re thinking about it as well.”
The words echoed in his head, revolving around and around much like the Soul Mantra. Yet, Tony wasn’t lying on Steve’s bare chest. He wasn’t wrapped around Steve in his bed in that old flat in Brooklyn. Steve rested alone in his room in the Tower and several floors up, Tony resided. Close. Steve rolled to his side. What happened to his sanity? Since he woke up he fought aliens, found out there was a new thing called soul packs because some magician (Magic was real!) played around with time, fought Hydra again, and ended up with a Beloved who was a man. He closed his eyes again and willed sleep to come, but was it because he was tired or he wanted to enter that dreamscape again?
Wrestling a clear understanding of soul packs and soul bonds still eluded Tony. He might be able to see the bonds amongst the team as networked and interlinked equations to solve, but the fact still remained that how to use that to their advantage hung like an anvil over their heads. His newfound relationship with Steve might offer an exciting new equation to explore, but the soul pack and how it would change the Avengers needed to be defined. It had been a good two years since the ring around Steve’s wrist had appeared. What had they done in that time to utilize it? Nothing. A few instances here and there had demonstrated that they had within their midst something tangible and powerful. Forging stronger bonds between all of them would utilize the power of the pack. Getting out of the city and to a place where they could investigate what it meant to be a soul pack, bonded team members would change everything.
“I thought I needed an Omega warrior,” he laughs. She’s always been such a worrier, though if it hadn’t been for her, he’d probably be dead somewhere in the Rims or Lanes. Now the whole of their empire- their lives and fortunes – depend on him. He wouldn’t care all that much except to keep himself fed but there are worlds and systems dependent on him and the Stark family. He might be a cold hearted bastard sometimes, but he doesn’t like the idea of babies dying of hunger during his watch – even if they are lowly omegas.
Steve swiped the hologram away with one arm and then pulled on his fingerless gloves. “I did it before on the Helicarrier. Don’t think I can’t do it here.” He closed the conversation off and both Maria and Natasha shared a look before considering Tony. He put his hands up as Steve walked to the front of the Quin Jet. Tony followed him.
“It’s not about that,” Tony said. “It’s the gland thing. If Ross is really intent on taking vampire glands to milk them for some special elixir we’re in more than a heap of trouble.” He got up on one elbow and looked down at Steve who looked especially pale. “If Nat is right then they’ll use mates as bait. Kidnap as many of the mates as possible and lure the vampires in. It wouldn’t be too hard.”
Steve snickers but it’s lacking his usual sarcastic edge. “Pepper told me about your lack of culinary skills.”
“Oh shit, yeah,” Clint said and pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes. “Oh crap. I’m a little dizzy,” Clint said. “Is that from the bond or something else?”
“As gone as he’ll ever be.” Tony grasps Steve’s shoulder. “I thought me being here to help you through the recovery would help, but obviously that’s not going to be a good thing. I’ll have Sam come in and sit with you. Try and eat, okay? See you, Cap.”
When they get to the gala, held at the old Stark Mansion, Steve stands on the sidewalk as Strange pays the cabbie. Hands in pockets he watches at the media frenzy around him. He knows that Tony is supposed to have held a plenary for special guests and then the big gala will take place. According to the draft agenda that Steve had seen earlier in the summer, the plenary session on the Maria Stark Foundation and then the gala following would require Tony to wear his glasses over 6 hours – long beyond the routine he normally did. Steve assumes Tony either fixed the issue with the upgrade or restored to the previous version.
“Not according to Frigga, and I tend to believe her. She’s one smart lady.” Tony clasps his shoulder. “Don’t let the visions eat you up. You didn’t actually do anything. He used you as his instrument.”
“Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’ll bring Bruce along. He could do with a good ride out to the fresh air. He has a little issue with anger and dealing with it. Did you know that he spent time in India, trying to use their strange ways of meditation to calm his nerves. He brought back many herbs and exotic-.”
He looks acceptably contrite. “I’m sorry about that, Commander. Please don’t hold the sins of the father against the son.”
“No, we weren’t. Bucky saved my life and he fell,” Steve says. “I was sentenced to a frozen purgatory for what I’d done. They only thawed me because of you, because I knew your father, and they figured I would be better suited to save you.”
God forbid he want some time to process. Before she left, Natasha called and in no uncertain terms told him that he was acting like the ass that he was. Bruce spent most of the early part of the weeks in DC and when he returned to New York City, he never queried Tony about his disappearance. Any time they spent together, Tony would catch Bruce throwing a quizzical look at him. That was probably due to the mixed-up shit from his brain Tony fed him on the daily basis. Tony did not know what to do, how to deal with the soul bond. For Christ’s sake, he wanted to be part of the bond, part of the pack, but he hated the idea that he was Beloved.  Like he deserved so much more than an insignificant role – the love of the leader. What the hell? He deserved better. He deserved a role like a chief or futurist. He was a genius after all, the pack should need him in that role, not as the Beloved. The more he learned about the position of Beloved (and boy did he spend too much time studying it), the more the conflict grew in his head. According to the sources he’d consulted, his astral projection (what the fuck) was literally a part of Steve’s astral projection and vice versa. Their souls combined formed a whole and parted? He stopped himself because it only brought him back to the sense of isolation and abandonment Steve felt on a daily basis. Tony spent years ignoring that part of himself. How alone he was as a child, how isolated he felt as an adult. He told himself that all of points were the reasons he ran and he spat them out at Bruce one day when the man happened to give him one of those squirrelly looks.
He’s always known he was attracted to men, that there was something wrong with him, that his tastes diverted to the deviant and perverse. He’d tried it with Peggy and he’d loved her well enough. He thinks he could have been happy with her, but she knew him better than he knew himself. She understood that he was just borrowing time until he could find a way to satisfy his aberrant urges. She never judged him, but did give him ease to be released without guilt from their ‘on and off’ relationship.
“Please, Tony,” Steve whispered and his hand pushed the blankets away to find Tony’s half hard cock. Steve’s dragged the back of his fingers along the length, the roughness of the knuckles sending spears of pleasure through Tony. “I want you in me. I denied myself. I deny it every day. Please.”
“I’m not so sure about that. Not anymore.” Tony touches the blood seeping out of Steve’s wound. “I think he’s accessing our brains.”
Banner doesn't answer but the wash of alcohol over the wound sends Bucky up on his knees with Steve, Thor, and a remorseful Happy struggling to keep him down on the cot. Bucky spits out the rag, and growls out a scream.
“Of course, I am. All normal people mock the rich and powerful. Our favorite saying is eat the rich.” Steve chuckles. “Don’t worry about it. It’s been a slogan for a millennium. As far as I know no one’s instituted it yet.”
“How about a couple more?” Tony says and slips in another finger. The nanites help him adjust and his body responds instantaneously.
“I used it on myself. I tried to save her. I tried to turn her. It only went sideways. She died – worse than it would have been if her illness had taken her.” As Tony listened to the story, Bruce had fallen into a stupor, and his gloom and self-abasement grew worse. Tony didn’t press Bruce for any more of the details, but the fact remained that Ross was seeking a way toward immortality more than the idea of controlling the vampire population. Or curing the disease.
“Like I said, I had it under control. My peeps and I,” Tony said. He downed the last of his Scotch and then balanced it on the railing. “Is this an official reprimand by SHIELD? Because it really doesn’t matter. I’m out of the superhero business, if you didn’t notice.”
Tony gets to his feet and closes the short distance between them. He kneels in front of Steve and places his hands on Steve’s hands. “I was wrong. And believe me that’s a rare thing for me to admit. I was wrong to think there is a difference. Maybe I was a little freaked out. I loved, love Blu. That means I love you. Doesn’t it?”
Steve smiled and the genuine appreciation shined through the link. “Thank you, Tony. Thank you very much.” Then the smile dropped and Steve bowed his head, his hands covering his face. It was the first time Tony witnessed their Captain, their leader, break down.
Steve coughs and clears his throat. “No. I’ve always been more partial to baseball. We played it in the Brooklyn Regions.”
Fury pushed off from the counter he leaned against and said, “You’re not wrong, Cap. Intel says that these two have been manipulated from the get-go. They think they are part of SHIELD.”
Looking to the territorial governor’s house for help isn’t the route to go, Steve needs to sit tight and wait for Sam to show up. He calculated it and it should take Sam a few days, as many as four at the outset to travel up from the Southwest and get to Avenge, though the weather might make it difficult. Once he’s here, Steve plans on saddling Shield and getting out of Avenge, taking to the trail. Right now, he has Thor going over clues from Loki’s belonging (what he left behind) to figure out where he might have been headed.
"Shit," Tony says. If it means what he thinks it means - he's wrong about one thing. Steve didn't take public transportation. He used a fucking bike with a little A painted onto the seat as a remembrance of who he used to be.
Tony wants to ask along the way to where, but then again, he is the one that asked Steve to take him away without any specific instructions.  They head out from the city, so Tony knows it’s not going to be Steve’s apartment. Brooklyn, New York fades behind them as they continue their escape.
“Well, I’d love to spend time watching you, learning from you, Tony. It’s always a surprise to me that scientists and engineers don’t think that people outside of their discipline would be interested. We are – I am. I might not get all of it, but it’s so enthralling.”
Steve grunted and held on as the copter swayed to the side but then Clint righted it. “If you can go closer to the Northwest DC, I know someone who might be able to offer some support.”
“I never told you, not directly. I’m sorry,” she said, and her expression looked older than it should. She glimpsed Bruce for a second but then turned back to Steve. “I suspected, but there’s no use in sharing fairy tales, right?”
Steven keeps his head bowed as his gland seeps the bonding secretions and a touch of blood. “What transgressions?”
“Mostly,” Steve said. His words were low and tender. “I know I have a ways to go, yet. To get there. But Sam and Nat are helping. Even Bruce. And you.”
He pretends he doesn’t see it, doesn’t recognize the pauses that sometimes - so subtly happen to Steve. There will be a moment while at a ballgame or walking through the park hand in hand, or hell even when they are back to back fighting the demons from what other dimension decide to descend on New York that day when Steve appears out of place. Tony can pinpoint it to the second. Steve routinely hides it. He conceals it well. He’s learned to jump over it like a puddle in the middle of a sunny day. It doesn’t slow him down, but it does point out his monachopsis.
because he knows he’ll only get obtuse answer anyhow. “Well, he’s getting cleaned up and then I am going to make sure he rests.”
A tremor overwhelms Blu and he collapses again, but now it is for the last time – Tony knows. He tightens his grip of Blu, hiding his face from reality. As he embraces Blu around the neck, he feels the last breath leave him and only stillness and silence follow. Everything he planned and lived for disintegrates, lies in ruins in his arms.
Steve flexes his hands opened and closed, but whatever he’s trying to shake off holds him in its grasp. He grimaces as if he’s struggling not to scream out. Turning his head to the side, he says, “Yeah, water, please.”
Tony grips the steering wheel and thinks he might actually bend it as he says, “How the hell messier can it get?”
That was so long ago. This man is ancient. That means he was probably put in stasis for some time. And the stats must be wrong. How could he have lived once the stasis failed? But what fascinates him even more is the link to the past. “And that’s why your Alpha died?” Tony asks because the Viz-nets have never been clear or precise about how the whole Uprising ended. Sure the entertainment industry tied it all up and never left a thread hanging, but the truth of the matter is that the tapestry of the story remains frayed.
Steve clears his throat, not knowing if Tony understands that they are sharing thoughts. Or at least, he thinks they are – maybe Steve’s sanity is just breaking down in this virtual world.
Steve joins him next to the bed and Tony places the precious toy in his hands. “It’s old and shows its age but according to legend the more you love something, like a stuffed toy, well it becomes real.”
“Okay,” she says lowly. “Listen, the storm looks like it should end in the next twelve hours or so. Might be hassle to get to you for a while. Hopefully, you’ll be okay.”
“Move that meeting Pep. You know I’m meeting with the scientific council this afternoon. I have to discuss the plans with Reed. I also need to work out the rest with T’Challa’s contingent.” He pauses as he listens but waves at Steve to start eating. “Yeah, I don’t think it’s that important. I want to hear what the doctor says and that’s far more important. What? No I am not talking with Zola. That man is a fucking villain. He traded secrets with the Kree. He should be in fucking prison or out an airlock.”
“Okay,” Steve says and puts down the sketchpad. He goes to the nightstand and logs into the computer. As he works, he adds, “I wanted to tell you, Tony, I’m sorry about what happened.”
“Hmm, thanks?” He never uses an autoclave at the Widow’s Brothel; he thinks he’ll stick with a good washing and boiling. It serves its purpose – the old fashioned way.  When he enters the washroom, he gapes. JARVIS isn’t fooling around – the place is chuck full of sinks and washers and different fabricators. Lining the walls are soaps and conditioners, greasers, and other items Steve cannot even fathom.
“It’s all we can ask,” Steve said in his Captain America voice even though he was in civilian clothes. “Thank you, officer. Would you mind if I retrieved my luggage from the wreckage?”
“No, I just. It was wrong. You made a vow, a promise to someone who was very important to you. My thoughts about that, my ideas are mine and should only be shared if you ask.”
Steve stares at him, a quiet rage thrumming through him. “I’m sorry I ever met you.” He grabs his bulky bag, drags it onto his shoulder. “I was talking to Odin because he came up to
“It’s okay. Everything is going to be okay,” she said and tears glistened in her eyes. She brushed his hair back from his face. “Everything is going to be fine.”
“This is it, baby. I’m gonna fuck you now.” He wants so much to say make love to you – but that’s out of bounds and he knows it will break him if he says it. “Fuck you good.”
Working night and day hadn’t saved his mother but he picked a different career choice now after he saw what happened to her. Steve tried everything to earn enough money to pay for the augmented lungs for his mother, but in the end, he’d only managed to save enough for the flight. His mother died and he left – left behind the Brooklyn Regional settlement and ventured further into the center of human civilization.
“Take what you need.” So simply put. Tony drank enthusiastically. The voice continued, “Take it all, Tony, if you need it. Remember, I love you. I always will.”
Steve turns back to him and there’s a kindness rooted in Stark’s eyes, a soft fondness that Steve cannot place.
“Well, that’s good because I don’t even know what it’s supposed to mean.” He yawns. “God, I’m tired. I hate these headaches. They take so much out of me, plus trying to remember all the code all the time is fucking impossible.”
“Keep repeating the words over and over. Listen to the rhythm of your words, the sound of your breath. Let it soothe you.” Bruce murmured the sentences again until Tony pronounced them in a sing song way, losing himself in the cadence of the chant. Both his hands covered Tony’s as they leaned into one another across the table.
“That is all a little disturbing,” Steve says as he watches the gate close and latch again automatically. He’s not sure if it locks.
Especially since Stark has been busy building his reputation around the town. He even has Peter Parker looking up to him like he’s some kind of sideshow star. Last Steve heard, the boy had taken up an apprenticeship at the blacksmith’s shop and Steve disapproves of it. He’d hope to send the boy east for a decent education, not stay here in a backwater town and learn a trade. Peter deserves more than that, especially since Aunt May spends a great deal of time helping out the town with her wise words, quilting bees, and her pies.
Clint looks from the bag to Steve. His eyes flash red. That was not the right answer. Clint slings the bag over his shoulder, his eyes challenge Steve. “Well, my dear Captain – man out of time – tell me how you’re prepared to handle a dose of my reality?”
The man called Obie stews at the prince. “You are making a grave mistake. You could lead the Conclave. You could declare yourself the King, the Emperor-.”
The whole team awaited his call and the Legion were out in the fields in anticipation of the war games. Laura had the kids up in their rooms, watching from the windows. He was fairly certain she even popped popcorn for the occasion.
“I know,” Steve said, and a pang of guilt hit him. What Tony had been through – was there a barometer that said which was worse? Crucifixion or rape. Or was it the same thing? The violation of their bodies and their minds in every way possible.
Bucky only nods to Sam and then they take off again. Both of them know they only have minutes before the whole base is on high alert.
“Yeah, sandwiches,” Steve said with a smile. “We would like to spend time together, just to be with one another.”
Again, he shrugged. “I’m not permitted to answer that question, sir, even to you. I was told it was an experiment from the war. It never went anywhere. But the scientists who used to work here had a hay day experimenting on it. I even heard they cut out its tongue once.”
With those words the otherness that enveloped Tony dissipates and he shivers, suddenly chilled as if he stood too long outside in the middle of winter. “No. Yes. Maybe.” He realizes he’s staring down at the teacup. He shakes his head. “We need to talk to Richards. If Steve called him and if Logan knows about these seizures then I bet they called him about it.”
The realization steals the breath from his lungs, but Steve doesn’t allow him to face it on his own. He wraps Tony in his arms and legs. They are entangled. He shudders. He knows what happened when the Ornari attacked that other reality. He knows that the other reality saved theirs from the Ornari.
“Yeah, like everything else,” Steve noted, but then he tried to soften his tone. “I will. Stark – Tony showed me some stuff on his phone. From a site on the internet called Wikipedia.”
Tony snapped his attention on Bruce. “I don’t fucking know! Why the hell would I know? I’m here, waiting to find out if I fucking killed my soul mate.”
The next few hours in the park present the opportunity for Steve to discover the real hold Stane possesses on the prince. Is it only sentiment or is it something more that Tony’s been hiding all along. That haunted look comes to mind as Steve walks to the expansive windows of the ship. He stares at the nebula. How beautiful and terrible it is all at once. The violence of birthing stars along with the wondrous display of creation. Steve glances over his shoulder at the door to the bedroom. Something beautiful and horrible resides in the prince’s domain.
Talk of the Brothel and their business ethic doesn’t faze Tony. “That’s the reason why I only use the Widow. Natasha is a smart businesswoman. She keeps everyone in line, even the clients. Swear that woman has her own secret assassins.” For a second, Steve can’t tell if the prince is joking or not, but then he winks at Steve again and it relieves the tension.
“Like he’s dying,” Bucky muttered and then stepped up to the bed. “What are you doing, Stevie? Why are you still here? We’re all here, together to bring you back.” He reached out and touched Steve only to pull his hand back. “Shit, that burns.”
It hadn’t been the time for a full-fledged confrontation. He didn’t want to be treated like some poor child who couldn’t protect himself.  Tony pulled Steven away from the ledge. “I know better now.”
Closing his eyes, Steve wipes away the horrific images, the sounds, the smells of the surgery invading his brain. It isn’t real. It’s meant to terrify him so that he cannot fight. Steve calms and allows the peace of his self-awareness grow.
Steve frowned as he looked at Bruce’s hand. “I’m not thinking that at all. I’m just worried.” He peered over his shoulder at the considerable damage Bruce had done to the laboratory. He couldn’t even name some of the instruments, but he was sure the big one in the corner shouldn’t have a dent in the side. “You shouldn’t have to carry my burden along with your own.”
Steve touches Tony’s face, tenderly, softly and whispers, “Tony. Tony, I dreamed of you since the first time I met you. But I can’t have you. I can’t, because they want you. One way or another they’re going to get you. I’ve tried to protect you. This was the perfect way. They would never suspect it. Who would think that the prostitute that you were seeing was -.” He stops.
“He may be counting on you, but the truth is you’re in no condition-.” Cho turns away from him, ignoring the pleading look Tony plastered on his face. “If we need to, we bring him out, like I said.”
Tony follows his request, and swims over to him. “I’m standing here, trying to put this together. We were in a god damned cave, I have a reactor in my chest, and you have wings on your back. How is this even possible?”
“You don’t have to be brave, you know. I can help you,” Tony said as they scrambled down the stairs. The physical alert system of the compound flashing and screaming in the corridors and stairwell as they hurried to the garage.
The voice continues as the blurry face moves out of Tony’s line of sight. “I have some broth for you. It has a little some rice in it, believe it or not. Some kind of rice anyhow. I convinced them to give me some bread, too. It isn’t much, but I think if you eat it you might feel stronger.”
“Privac- holy shit! You really are going all in, aren’t you?” Tony rushed after him. He grabbed his bag as he followed Steve.
Tony put his hand to his forehead and spun on his heel. Blinking, he tried to banish the tears forming in his eyes. What the hell was happening? Why was it happening? The sinking feeling in his chest dragged him into a pit, an abyss of numbness that shuddered through him. A slow earthquake crumbed his emotions and even as the group debated Steve’s condition, the words meant nothing to him. All he heard over and over was that Steve was in critical condition.
“Loaded because it depends on your idea of America, doesn’t it?” Steve says. “Before the war there were two sides to the idea of America. One side enslaved a whole people, the other side wanted to abolish this cruelty. Both sides thought they were American. It was a split between two ideas.
Now Tony was before him, like a feast for a starving man. Tony bent over him, a smile etched across his face. Steve could no more deny the truth. He encompassed Tony in his arms, his strong arms that were made for war but could be gentle for loving as well. In the next moments, he learned, and he taught. He understood another body and he learned more about his own body. Tony touched him and kissed him. When Steve returned the favor the heightened breaths, the shiver against him thrilled Steve. It encouraged a touch to the flank, that slide down to cup Tony’s cheek and teased against his ass. Tony continued Steve’s education in both a physical and metaphysical way. As Steve nuzzled against him, testing his teeth on Tony’s nipples, Tony panted and gasped but also knitted their souls into more intricate patterns, connected and networked together in tight harmony. When Tony showed Steve the lube and slipped some of it on his own fingers to prepare himself, Steve hitched a breath and wondered if he might go into an asthma attack. Watching Tony enter himself with fingers sizzled Steve’s neurons and sang through the soul bond. He didn’t realize it could be like this, that he could enjoy and lose the inhibitions of his day. When Tony guided Steve inside, Steve perched over him holding his breath. He hated the idea of hurting anyone, especially Tony. With encouragement, Steve pushed inside, and the sensation stole his conscious thought, ate the air from his lungs, throbbed his blood in his ears until he thought he might go deaf from it.
Tony frowns and shakes his head. “I wanted to hate you. I thought I should. What you did, what you hid, I don’t think I can ever stomach. But this, this is so much worse. What you did to yourself, I can’t abide by it. I think if this kills you, I might just cross over and hate you. Why did you do this to yourself? Why?”
Somewhere along the way his hat’s tumbled off and he only pauses for a second to yank off his boots before he climbs into the bed. He tries to be gentle, Tony’s only just recovering, but his brain misfires and he’s clawing at Tony, wanting so much to feel this, to feel something other than worry, pain, concern, shame, and longing. It always wraps up into a numbing ball inside of him causing him to walk around like the dead – wasted and ashen inside.
“Yes, I do, and you still don’t need to know them,” Fury says and his wing bristles against his side.  “Now, don’t you think you should be getting back?”
“It kind of reminds me of Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan.” When Steve doesn’t indicate any understanding, Tony hunches forward as if he’s clamoring to let him in on a secret. “It’s original series movie. Khan is firing on the Enterprise and Spock notices that Khan is using only 2 dimensional thinking. He’s not thinking about the z axis in space where he can attack.”  When Steve still doesn’t react, Tony huffs. “It shows a naiveté about strategy and planning. We have an opportunity to exploit here.”
Steve shrinks back, the fight dissipates out of him. He’s fought it for too long and he doesn’t think, right now, he can. “Doctor, I don’t think we should talk about this anymore.”
Clint screws up his face which only serves to make him wince. “Ow.” He rubs at his jaw. “Listen, we all know that’s not happening. We know we gotta leave.”
“In a purely chaste way. Tell me I’m wrong. And remember we promised not to lie or hold back the truth from one another. Go on tell me I’m wrong.” He has both hands on the counter he’s leaning into the space.
He spoke the next words out loud as if he’d only said them yesterday. “There's not enough time. This thing's moving too fast and it's heading for New York. I gotta put her in the water.”
“But you don’t see the same thing in each dimension,” Steve returns. “Doors open and close. The facets held places and times. You see different things.”
Steve grins. “Tell me about it. I once forced Dum Dum to dance the polka with me in the middle of camp. We were out of rations and we only trapped a single skinny hare. I was about starved to death.”
Tony read his mind. “I think I cut us off in the soul bonds. It feels like it anyway, but I -. I have to admit that I don’t think this is all from you. I just- I want this to work out. I’m serious about this. This isn’t just one of my passing fancies, you know.”
“Be right down.” Tony places the cup on the table. Of course, it’s a leader thing, nothing special about it at all. Tony’s reading too much into things like he always does when it comes to personal issues. He digs his phone out from under his pillow and texts Natasha.
“Someone’s going to try and assassinate your boy,” Coulson says and his words hold no malice and may be intended to soften the blow. It fails.
Well, all of that explained exactly what had happened and why in mythical, or scientific or whatever terms but what it meant remained a mystery. There were only three extensively studied Beloved bonds in all of the soul packs documented. In all cases the bonded were in love and sexually involved.
“I would go to the police, but your mother has begged me not to.” Jarvis petted Tony’s head. “But perhaps I have a better idea.”
Tony groans. He pushes onto Steve’s finger and then in a while a second finger gains entrance and Tony jerks and a warm spurt of precome splatters on his belly.
“Nothing but sex,” Tony muttered, but scanned the paper all the same. Page upon page of psychological evaluation of Steve Rogers after being rescued and thawed from the ice. After a brief escape from SHIELD within the first week of his awakening, Steve Rogers was transferred to something called the Raft where he stayed for over 5 years under going assessment. “What’s this Raft?”
“Yes. My mother gave it to me. Years ago. I loved this little guy. I even brought him to college with me. I’m afraid he helped me nurse quite a few hangovers in his day.” Tony looks fondly at the cherished toy. “For years, all I had was Blu to confess everything to.”
“Can’t, someone’s gotta look out for you,” Buck replies and he stares at Tony. “He’s gonna hurt you, Stevie. Don’t go getting hurt over it. Don’t do that, Stevie.”
“Well,” Pierce said and waved a hand to the door. Another agent walked in and handed him a silver bottle. “I think that it would be a good thing to feed our prisoner, especially since the serum does consume quite a bit of calories to stay functioning.” Pierce waited as Ross considered him. Once the latter gave a nod and a gesture to Barton, Clint took the offered flask.
“No,” Tony whispers, then louder he says, “No, no. no. This isn’t happening. Blu, please. Please.” He rushes over to Blu as the lion collapses on the side of their stream. He clutches onto Blu. “No. Don’t do this. Don’t leave me.”
“Natasha helped me with some of the translations. Some of it I did, and they aren’t as good. My Russian is rusty. This is Bucky’s file when he was in custody of Hydra for all of those years, decades really. How they turned him into the Winter Soldier, how they tortured him and programmed him.” Steve didn’t meet Tony’s gaze. Instead he pointed to different pages as he explained. “Bucky had a serum that Zola had injected in him in ’43 when his unit had been captured.  It wasn’t a perfect replica of the Erskine formula from what I could gather from the notes here. I don’t even think they had the vita rays. But it did something to Bucky. After Bucky fell from the train, he survived due to that serum.. He was found by Soviet troops and taken into custody. Eventually, they moved him to be part of the Hydra experiments. Apparently, Hydra crosses international borders – infests a lot of different countries.”
“Are you? Are you okay?” Steve says and places a hand on Tony’s forearm, feeling the tremors along his muscles. “You need to eat.”
“Vision, this is Steve. He’s my Personal Assistant and as such will be given all the privileges and access that I have on the island and in the estate.”
“Not sure yet,” Steve says. “Depends on the actual attendance.” He notices she’s bypassing several of the security procedures. “You can’t do that Natasha, you have to-.”
It takes a while to think of something, anything to calm Steve, but he does. “You said this time was different.”
“Now,” Tony says and walks around him. “The dildo in your ass will fuck you as you blow me. Are you ready?”
“But that was a data dump, Fury’s smarter than that,” Steve says. “He wouldn’t have had something like that on the SHIELD servers.”
Nearly died? But he couldn’t die. Tony looked at Bucky and then back at Steve. “He’s not what he was though. He’s not ill.”
He drowns himself in his work. It’s delicate and he needs to the daylight to get it done so it’s not hard to be lost in it. By the time he finishes and sees the confirmation that the HUD now works, he slips on the earpiece he ripped out of the helmet and says, “JARVIS?”
Steve marched right into Tony’s path and stood over him. “Don’t you even dare! I am not Hydra. Don’t you dare think that of me. And Bucky is not my boyfriend. I am not a pervert.”
Tony squeezed Steve’s hand. “I didn’t say the plan was perfect, but if we could find a neutral party you could trust?”
They step through together. Only Tony’s hand melts away and Steve’s alone, falling through the fog and darkness until he slams into the hard ground. There’s no light, no sound. Something strikes him in the back of the head and his last thought centers on Tony.
“You didn’t come back. I was worried about you. Thought you might like to eat.” He places the small container of food he gathered on a table close to the instrument.
Every night, when they all leave, Steve sneaks back into Tony’s room. He nods to the nurse and sits down. He holds Tony’s hand, rubs his thumb along the palm and talks to Tony. He tells him about how poor he was before he took the job as his personal assistant. He elaborates on his next big comic book idea – about a skinny weasel of a guy with a heart of gold who gets vitarays and a super secret serum to make him strong and big and he fights in WWII.
Another reporter screamed, “There was a large data dump from SHIELD. Reports say that there might be a Nazi affiliation within the United States government.”
He clicks a few times to bring Shield around as the stage comes in from the outlying towns to unload passengers for the train. They’re lucky that Avenge has a train station, it wasn’t supposed to, but then the continental construction was forced this way due to engineering issues through the mountain passes. Or so he’s heard from Uncle Ben when he’s spent a time or two with the man as he convalesces with his weak heart.
“No, of course you’re not,” Tony says and peers around the corner. “No sign of pursuit. Not yet. He’s regrouping.” Most of the time Tony’s attention is only half in the real world – or in the world plainly in front of him. When Tony turns to Steve, his eyes are stark and true. “He has connected to our brains. Not our thoughts or our higher functions, but our reptilian functions. If he wants us dead, then he might just be able to click his fingers and kill us.”
“Maybe this should wait until you’re more coherent, because right now, you’re not making much sense.”
“Captain Rogers, it’s nice that you agree to come tonight,” Rhodes says and there’s something in his tone that stops Steve’s immediate need to escape. “Let me be the first to apologize for our over reaction to what happened with your employment.”
Steven smiles at Tony for the first time. It’s genuine and tender as if there’s some attachment between them. Tony’s heart sings. Steven turns back to Jamison and says, “Sir, it is my understanding you will be in charge of my training for the Stark family.”
“Oh shit!” Tony closes his eyes and bows his head. He can’t stop himself from digging his own grave.
His father had always said that punishment seeded obedience. He’d even used this philosophy on raising his son. No wonder Tony had a wild, rebellious phase during his youth. In the past few weeks he’s used the punishment principle on Steven to no avail. The omega defies him at every step. Walking over to the rack, he studies it. He could string the omega up again. If he commanded it the omega would acquiesce, Tony is sure. He could go farther this time, make him bleed.
Tony wanted to know who, who kept this Adonis, this paragon or doppelgänger of Captain American on a leash, tied to being a hooker on the mean streets of New York.
He glanced at the group, the entire pack following him. At the periphery he spotted the shades, ghosts against the light. He ignored them. “Yes, we’re all here to get your ass back to the 21st century.”
His heart gallops in his chest like a racehorse breaking for the finish line. Rubbing just left of the arc reactor does nothing to alleviate the burst of pain. He knows its phantom pain, but hell if it doesn’t always haunt him during the most stressful times.  The thoughts in his brain mix around like globs of jelly. Nothing sets right. He’s had several more episodes where he
“Come now, let’s watch the show.” Estane turns to the battle. “I’ll let them play with your pet for a bit.”
His heart hammers in his chest so loudly Steve nearly misses Tony’s soft-spoken words. He pushes away his fears and, as Tony’s hand lingers against his cheek, he says, “You’re reading it right.”
He dives for Steve and grappling to get a hold of the Jedi but cannot grasp a handhold. He curses but happens to catch a hand on the metal cage of his muzzle. He hauls Steve close and immediately cups him to his chest. “It’s okay. You’re okay. If Clint will ever get here.”
“Director Fury assures me that’s not the case. They want me as part of their team they’re putting together. Said I was the first avenger, I should lead it. I’ll have a purpose again. You’ll see.” Steve heaves the bag onto his shoulder. He mutters something under his breath and Tony only makes out ‘you’ll see’.
“Yes, and yes,” Steve says and the thought occurs to him that Tony’s heart might not be able to take such activities and he almost stops until Tony squeezes him and warns.
Happy nodded. “We have a global search as well for anything out of place that might lead to covens being discovered in their safe houses.”
Before he knows it, he has staggered out of his closet in a kind of melancholy stupor. He crashes onto his bed with the lion clutched in his arms. He should feel stupid and childish but instead he just knows loneliness in the pit of his heart. He crawls up to the pillows with the lion and cradles it in his elbow.
The young man turns to face Tony, his broad shoulders slump. “It’s a long time ago, Tony. I’m not him anymore. I’ll never be him again.”
He’s not wrong. In order for the mission to work, Tony devised a micro-chip that would sync with the cradle. Cho used the micro-chip to fabricate vibranium neurological interfaces within their craniums. At the base of their skulls, she implanted the devices that would link them to the cradle which would then connect with the internet. Tony wrote the code that ensured that their consciousness shuttled to the closest input point to find Ultron’s base code.
“Well you did at one time, I would think there would be coffee,” Thor says and he opens the cupboard under the sink.
Tony draws away, panting hard against Steve. His hand slides down and grasps Steve’s erection. “How far can we go? How far?”
Steve flutters his eyelashes, feeling a little foolish but getting the effect right. “If you ask nicely, I might even agree to wearing a leather harness at some point.”
“Not sure I want a hot dog.” Tony waits, his left hand outstretched. This is a test. Whether Ultron’s constructs will back down. If Ultron follows the rules of his own game, then Clint should act as he would in the real world. Ultron knows enough about Clint. He knows what Tony had in those dossiers – whatever that might be.
This isn’t how it is supposed to be. He knows this – he intended for what he did to end things, but not like this. He would cut out his gland and free Tony. Simple, easy. He would free himself of the need to remember, of the curse of knowing what it felt like to be bonded, to want and to hold, and to fly into a warrior’s rage because of harm to his alpha. All of that would be a distant dreamlike thing to him. This didn’t happen when they took it, when the scientists experimented on him. He was fine. Why is it happening now?
The power of T’Challa’s gaze quelled some of Steve’s enthusiasm. “Sorry, your highness.” He went back to the chair, but T’Challa climbed to his feet.
“I think she’s right, you need to stop this madness, Howard.” Tony recognized the voice as his ‘uncle’ Obie.
She frowns and then says in softer tones, “Mister Stark, your alpha is what we refer to in the medical field as a Hermi. He has both alpha and omega attributes. His omega traits are less prominent, and I suspect the serum has something to do with that, but he clearly has uteri sacs, ovi seeds. He also has slick glans and a bonding gland at his neck. You clearly must know this.”
“What does that even mean?” Tony demanded. He swore his pulse shot up to dangerous levels. His temples pounded. “Who is he? How the fuck long has he been here?”
“Bucky?” Tony said. “You mean the Bucky who’s been identified as the legendary Winter Soldier in all those files you and Nat released on the web?”
Standing, Steve decided to go to Tony – tell him what he needed. Stop this merry-go-round in his head. As he went to the balcony door, a tapping sounded and then the apartment door opened. Tony entered. He had sunglasses on and a long-sleeved linen jacket and pants to match.
No one believes Tony. He comes back to the fanfare expected after disappearing for three months and being rescued in the middle of a desert. He doesn’t explain the details of his escape; they wouldn’t believe him anyhow. He does try and figure out who Steve’s family might be. According to Steve he had been a descendent of the famous Captain Rogers, from back in the day.
There’s always Strange’s proposal. It’s intriguing and he’s doing his homework on the whole science of virotherapy. Right now, it’s a far-off distant probability that Tony refuses to factor into his life. It means giving up on the implant, it means taking a chance that he will lose what sight he has forever. How can he see the future without his sight? A shiver runs down his spine. Tony doesn’t like uncertainties. He hates not being able to formulate the future. All future is possibilities. All possibilities can be calculated. Calculation is his language. Figuring it out, child’s play.
Steve gave himself over to being beaten, to the strings of his soul as they splintered and frayed while at the same time he kept his promise not to let his pack suffer because of him. It had been his private vow. He wanted no one to feel the pain of loss and isolation, displacement and loneliness. As he spoke his last words, the cacophony of pain through the bond grew; they grappled to hang on to him, to cling to him. Yet, he spoke only to Bucky, “Then finish it, ‘cause I’m with you ‘til the end of the line.”
Once he catches his breath again, Peter drops down to the floor, runs over to Tony and says, “I’ll be by in the morning. Can we work in the shop then?”
Steve lowers his gaze again. “I trusted you time and again, Tony. You kept doing things that I didn’t agree with. You made Ultron, and you made Vision. But I kept on believing in you. I did time and again.” Steve closes his eyes. “The world is a different place than when I grew up. You know.” He looks back at Tony. “When I was a little kid, there was this guy across the hall from us. He was in the Great War, the war to end all wars. But we weren’t allowed to ask him about it. He probably had PTSD or something. I don’t know. You just didn’t talk about things. The lady down the hall, she ended up with cancer. But no one spoke about it. You just didn’t.”
Thor had been quiet during the exchange and Tony glanced at him. His brow furrowed in thought. “Thor? What’s the good word?”
Steve got up from his seat to intervene but Tony laughed at Strange. “I heard you were a famous surgeon and now you go around in a cape and act as if you’re some hocus pocus wizard. Hogwarts and Harry Potter land is down in Orlando.”
“Like I said, I have to wait for his move.” Tony slumped into the couch. “I kind of feel paralyzed. I’ve never felt like this before, not when it comes to getting the guy – or the girl. Always went for it. Now I’m scared shitless that he’s gonna run, that he’s gonna be terrified if I make a move. With the complication of the pack – it’s just too much.”
Tony doesn’t know why but the whole exchange pisses him off. He leaves the kitchen with coffee mug in hand and forgets entirely about the artwork hanging on the wall in the kitchen.
He swallows hard. He’s seen this tragedy before. His Natasha folds her hand over his and yanks him toward the floating specter. Steve doesn’t blame her for wanting to avoid seeing her death displayed before her.
Steve chuckles. “No, I’ve been sitting right next to you watching how you ignore the vegetables in the plate even when I fake you out and tell you they are where the meat is supposed to be.”
“So, let him go. Family ends up ruining one another in my experience. Leave him to his own devices. It’s really none of your business.”
“Yes, I’m going to DC, but I see you’re not in the approving column.” Steve wasn’t looking for approval but he didn’t know a lot of people and he hated the idea of pushing everyone away. Especially someone who would be linked to him in some mythical way for the rest of his life.
“And you nearly killed him,” Steve had said and struggled to his feet to go to the small bureau. He dug into the drawer to retrieve a towel. He wavered as he stands next to the bureau and Tony caught the slightest tremor of his hands as he folded up the towel and brought it over to his friend. With a tender touch, Steve placed the towel against Bucky’s shoulder and then said, “I need to pull it out.”
For the first time, Steven glanced at him with tender eyes. There was something distant and yearning in them as if he might remember something he once enjoyed. It was fleeting and beautiful at the same time. “Yes, I would love to, my lord.” The words said one thing but the pain laced through them said another.
Tony tilts his head. “Of course. But these would disintegrate with the introduction of semen or would eventually disintegrate throughout the day if not introduced to semen. They would just wash out. Don’t worry about incontinence because the stretch is completely controlled. Seems a lot more convenient than this archaic thing.” He tosses it to Steve. “Tell me if you’re interested. It’s a simple applicator.”
“I need the great outdoors, the fresh air,” Stark replies. Steve can’t get a glimpse of them, but he stops and listens.
Sam walked to the back of the restaurant and then faded from view. The rest of the pack watched him and then as if a silent agreement had been struck, followed him until only Steve and Tony were left.
“And that’s not fair,” Steve said, his voice cracking. “You died for me. You resurrected me. But, even -.” He halted as the words clogged up in his throat again, spasming. He fought away the tears. “Even then you never gave up on me. I want to be there for you. I want to be there for everyone. But maybe there’s nothing of me left. Maybe I tried and tried. And I feel like I walked into a different dimension with Nat. That this isn’t the reality I thought I was in. My world had hope – now what is happening? Why is this happening?” He wiped away the tears, angry that he’d broken down again. “I don’t want to run away from you. I don’t want to feel the terror in the dark anymore. I want to feel you next to me. I want to touch you and know that it will be okay. But I’m not sure- I don’t.”
Steve kisses his ear and then whispers, “Not God, but what intelligent species made the Ornari or made the God Machine.”
“After a dozen years at the best therapist I found out I had daddy issues. That’s what they said. You’re angry at your father. I had to say it, I’m very angry at Howard. Don’t I say it well now?” Tony laughs but it’s without any mirth. It’s sad and lonely. “Doesn’t matter now. He’s gone and I’m left with his mess.”
Steve pretends to think about it, and then beckons Tony to lean down. He whispers in his ear, “Take a day off this week. Spend the whole day with me. I’ll do anything you want, if you only do this for me.”
“Yep.” Tony turns to look at him. He smiles, but it doesn’t touch his eyes. “Gone. You know that plan we had worked. So- all gone.” He makes a sing song tilt to his voice.
When Steve wakes up his head pounds like a raging beat of drums in some of the modern music of the day. He groans and closes his eyes to the bright colors amassed over him. He feels like he’s in the eye of a tornado, a peaceful place surrounded by chaos. Everything around him bangs and clangs and he needs to navigate out of the chasm into his new reality. The headache burns his sinuses and aches at the base of his nostrils. He rolls and feels soft freshly cut grass against his cheek. He clings to that information and grapples to get his bearings. The pain in his head accelerates until he shudders and his body balks at it.
The jet lands at a military base outside of Washington D.C..  Steve ignores the details; his mind too distracted by his own weakness and by Tony’s anxiety. He doesn’t show it, of course. Tony knows how to hide his nerves by his eternal cockiness, but Steve long ago learned his tells. Natasha knows them as well. He watches as she categorizes them. Tony tends to rub at his chest where the arc reactor sat. He uses the tips of his fingers and presses deep into his sternum where the fake implanted bone reconstructs the missing bone. Tony also has a habit of playing with his tumbler of whatever his chosen drink is. He doesn’t drink, but spins it around on the table, dragging his finger up and down along the condensation, the taste of the drink long forgotten.
“So you would think that God would do that, purposefully and with malice. For what purpose? Why you?”
“No. This is from me. I need a favor. I need you to find out what his right hand man is doing and why.”
A stream of curses erupts out of Tony, but at the same time he begs for Steve to stop him. “Fuck, fuck! I fucking can’t take it. God damn it to hell and back. Don’t, Steve. Don’t fucking let me come. You fucking devil.”
“Come on, you’re alive,” Steve mutters and repeats it again and again as if saying the mantra will force it to be true. Dragging Tony further up the bank, Steve kneels next to him and turns him onto his side. He smacks him a few times in the back eliciting a wet cough and then choking noises. “Come on, Tony, come on.”
“He’s okay. Out of the fugue. The doctors have him in a separate room. He’s beside himself with guilt and grief because of what happened,” Peggy said and cupped a hand to his face. “What you did for him, it’s nothing short of a miracle you survived.”
“Valium?” That doesn’t sound like adequate seizure medication. But he finds the bottle, grabs it, and raises back to her. “What are you going to do? Put it under his tongue?”
“It’s the only logical way,” Steve says. “You get out of here and get to stop this insanity of being hunted by him.”
Steve sighs. “Yeah. Lost too much weight. Got sick. Sam and Bucky, my friends, they had to have an intervention. Or whatever you want to call it.”
“Logan.” Tony waits to hear what Bruce has to say. “Well?” He sips the tea. He doesn’t like tea. Why is he pretending? He gags a little, smiles, and blinks a few times as he sets the mug onto the table.
“It’s so good that you could come. I apologize for what happened, Steve. It was a misunderstanding. I hope you know that. I hope you will consider coming back and working with Tony again.”
The connection ends and Steve falls back on the bed, arms spread wide. He keeps thinking about Nat’s comment – about how he’s not made for this life. If he’s not made for this – then what? During the middle of a war to determine whether the Conclave and all it’s inhabitants get to exist artists aren’t needed. Besides his skills rust out with each day he shuns practicing. He hasn’t touched any of his art supplies since he arrived at Prime. If he thinks about it too long, he knows it’s been longer than that – months before he left Brooklyn Steve spent his hours training and getting ready for a life as a prostitute. He committed himself to walking the streets of the settlement though he never solicited a client – he was that chicken shit.
She hurries beside him, her eyes glinting in the half light of the cabin. Several of his staff and crew scurry back, making way for their Lord. “You can’t just pick anyone, Tony. A good one, you have to pick a good one.”
“I’ve seen a great many things in my travels, a young fledgling is the least of the surprises I’ve encountered in my life,” she says and then shushes him as she listens to his heart. When she pulls away, she looks at him – her gaze ever fierce. “I don’t know much about otherworldly affairs, but I do know you should be able to hide these wings of yours from my mortal eyes. Why can’t you?”
“Yeah,” Bruce said but his voice sounded far off. His eyes watered but he managed not to start crying, and Tony was eternally grateful for that since he had no idea how to handle it.
Tony clambers to his feet again, dusting away the imaginary dirt. “What the hell? Do you need me to call the police?”
“You’ll forgive me if I don’t shake hands.” Tony waves him off as if he’s an annoying bee. “You’d be surprised at the amount of germs on the human hand, positively disgusting. Have you looked under a microscope lately?”
“No, no it’s not payback. This is god damned saving your life,” Tony hisses and then rubs a hand over his mouth. “You fucked up. You know that right. You nearly took your life. You know what they do to people who are suicidal, right?”
“You’re not wrong,” Tony replies. “Sometimes I just think Obie’s trying to protect me to the extreme. Like he’s worried that once he’s gone, he needs to set me up and make sure everything is perfect. Other times.” He stops and doesn’t elaborate. Instead, the prince adds, “Other times, Obie likes the game. He likes to play politics and see how much he can win.”
And for a single moment, the crucial moment, Steve cannot grasp a viable answer. The need, the urgency is too strong to deny and he falls into the kiss more than anything else. He opens his mouth and welcomes Tony in, and his hands are grasping at Tony’s shoulders, pushing the shirt away and down. He wants this more than he’s willing to consciously admit. Forcing his head with its cluttered thoughts to shut down, Steve only listens to the growing resolve within him, to do this thing, to release himself of his burdens, to follow the path toward damnation.
“I’d like to know if the elixir they’re extracting is permanent or if they have to keep drinking in the elixir,” Tony remarked. It was something he believed that Cho and her coven would study and could find the answer to if they could resource it out to her.
This time they discovered Steve in the bathroom of the little restaurant they had eaten shawarma at so many years ago after the Battle of New York. He stood at the tiny sink, yanking the fabric of his pitiful uniform away from an ugly burn on his side. Not all of them could fit in the phone booth sized bathroom, so Tony shoved forward and pushed inside.
He glances down from the road for a moment – he can the traffic is at a standstill (again). In a shaky scrawl, the words are scribble on the paper:
“This one. I want this one. Write him up.” Tony says, knocking on the glass. “He’s the one. He’ll be my omega. He has to be. There’s no other way around it. He’s already mine.”
“Where are we going exactly?” Steve steps out of the elevator, trying to exude confidence but feeling like that little boy at the age of five fessing up to breaking a mirror at the department store.
“You know exactly why.” Steve has no sympathy for him. “Now, take my hand and we’ll walk down the pier. You can feel the wind on your face. Listen to the gulls.”
"Tell me, Tony, you're taking this project seriously. We need those propulsion systems up and running at the quarterly eval for the COTR. We go into that meeting with the DOD and they are going to be fuming if they don't see progress."
Steve studied Tony as he queried Clint. Without pause, Hawkeye said, “Yeah, I think it’s time.” He gave Steve a half assed salute and then walked out of the kitchen.
By the time the sun has inched its way toward a low mid-sky zenith of autumn, Steve calls a halt. Though Tony tries to protest, Steve shrugs him off. “The horses need a drink, and I'd like to have a bit of the sandwiches Miss Darcy had the good sense to pack us.”
“We’ve gone over all the data, Steve. You don’t have to worry. Hank really knows his stuff. Along with Wong, Bruce, and Strange, we got this.” He squeezes Steve’s hand and shakes it a little.
Tony makes a grunting noise and then paws the air with his free hand. Steve captures his hand and brings it to his own chest with the other one. “I’m right here. You can feel my heart beating.” It feels like it might burst out of his chest. He holds back his terror – and the litany in his head – why didn’t he stop Tony? Why didn’t he make him wait? “Just hold on Tony.” He tries not to circle around to the idea of brain damage, of how Tony isn’t even speaking, of how lost and frantic he looks.
“Tony,” Steve says and it hurts like the cold wind prickling his face in the middle of winter. “Let’s not do this.”
Tony checks the list of attendees for the meeting as Steven speaks. He studies the screen, trying hard not to notice that his omega interrupted him. Also trying hard not to be happy about the fact Steven almost called him Tony. It’s progress. The man must be feeling more comfortable around him. If they are to be successful together as alpha and omega then they must have a working relationship and some kind of companionship. It’s important to set limits, but he also wants the elusive friendship – though he cannot attest to why. “Yes, you were, weren’t you?”
“Well eventually I suppose you should file for divorce.” Steve looks a little pale as he states this between pizza bites. “I know you don’t want to be tied down to me.”
Steve stares at the pot and then back at Tony. Bewilderment is not an emotion Steve is familiar with. “Hmm, okay?”
Someone hustles Tony to his feet and forces him to dress as they chain Steven. Pants and a shirt is all they allow Tony – no shoes. Tony tries to resist but he gets a punch in the face for his efforts which are meager at best.
Level two: Five lashes with the whip. No food for five days. The isolation tank for five days. The mask for five days.
His gland still aches with echoes of what once was. He rubs at it. It hurts. More than usual. But he ignores it. He should go back out and apologize. He shouldn’t have broken his own rule. He curses.
“Yeah,” Clint said with a twist to his lips. “I can’t believe it. I really can’t. This is not what I signed up for. Not Hydra.”
“One of the theories about the serum is that the more you tax it, the more it goes into overdrive, trying to heal you. It activates as you get injured. So, the more we injure you, the higher the activity,” Ross said.
“Are you sure, my lord?” Steven says in quiet tones as if not to startle him, and he hasn’t moved to Tony’s side.
“A witch does not go to Harvard Medical School, Mister Stark,” a woman says as she enters. She adjusts the canvas bag on her shoulder and frowns at Tony.
“Steve,” Tony said but kept his distance. “I don’t know what you remember and what you don’t remember. But I can see from your expression, you’re terrified.”
“Tony,” Steve says and a certain low grade hysteria rises in his chest and he squeezes his hands into balls. It can’t be. Tony did not find out about Bucky. T’Challa wouldn’t have betrayed him – but if Ross and crew threatened him, or the whole of Wakanda, what would T’Challa do? He’s a king, a ruler charged with the protection of all of his people, not just a stranger. “Tony, please.”
“You’ve been through quite a lot. And it was miraculous and quite exciting to watch. We got it on video-.” Shuri was tapping on her bracelet as she spoke.
Steve shrugs. “Now, what are you gonna do?” Steve tugs at Tony’s shirt. “Show me you know what you’re doing, my prince.”
“A Prime pairing, my friend, is the myth of the true pairing.” T’Challa sits close to him and strokes his hair from his damp face. “It is a story my grandfather once told me.”
Tony bends close to Steve’s mouth; their foreheads touch. “That’s what I said, isn’t it? All this time, Steve. We wasted too much time.”
“It’ll be dangerous and we’ll be riding hard,” Steve says. The thoughts of going on this hunt with Tony doesn’t quell his nerves, but instead sets them on fire and images of Tony kissing his naked flesh superimpose on his sights. “No, that would be distracting,” he adds in a mutter.
“I will see what I can do.” Strange doesn’t leave just then, but instead adds, “This isn’t the end, Tony. It can be the beginning.”
Steve took the bottle with shaky hands, but Tony decided against letting him have it. Instead, he brought the bottle to Steve’s lips. “Drink.” After he’d managed to get down about half of the bottle, Tony asked him to lift his chin. He bent down to examine each wound and then licked them, specifically allowing the coagulant to cover each injury.
“Well, I’m sorry but I don’t think I’m welcome and I already packed all of my clothes.” He’s sure he doesn’t have the correct wardrobe for the party anyhow.
Stark smiles with a half crooked curve of his lips. “Because I know quite a bit about you. Many do.”
He’s not ready to concede, but he still needs information. He raises his hands and says, “No. He knows nothing about it.”
The din of the crowd dissipates as Steve only focuses on Strange and Wong. They stand there like a pair of crows considering whether to pick his bones bare. Nothing intimidates him when he demands answers. The doctor who cared for his mother tried to dissuade him from the truth. It never works out. Not for Steve Rogers.
Back in the main hall of the concourse, Tony rushes over to the treat vendor and points excitedly at the absurdly large popsicles. “I want a cherry one.” Tony winks at him and Steve rolls his eyes. “Cherry for both of us?”
“The very definition of life includes the ability to procreate. Omegas do not procreate. They are made to be almost symbiotic to the alpha. You are there to protect me and my progeny. That is all.” Tony wipes away the blemishes on the man’s shoulders. His wounds are long gone, faded and healed.
“Let’s find our seats,” Wong says, and they head toward the table at the entrance that indicates the table number they’ve been assigned.
“Don’t!” How this demon knows of his dreams – his fears – it’s part of his power. The Soul Keeper told him as much. “You lie to steal my soul!”
“Inside?” Steve doesn’t know what he means. Is it inside the device in his chest? Inside the battery? Inside the saddlebag? He’s getting desperate and frightened. The world spins around him and his vision tunnels to a pinpoint. He squeezes his eyes closed and steadies himself. Once he does, he opens his eyes and realizes they are wet.  The tears stream down his face and freeze it. He’s losing everything dear to him, everyone dear to him. He doesn’t know what to do; he’s woefully unprepared.
Tony affirmed. “Yeah. He wasn’t himself. He was little. Small like he was before Rebirth. His mother was dying and then it was just us. The two of us.”
Steve turns to find Tony watching him from across the room. He only smiles in return. He’s never felt beautiful or handsome – not ever. He’s always been the scrawny, sickly kid that everyone had to take care of growing up. Going down that path leads him to Bucky and he needs to keep his head in the game.
They walked to the far end of the corridor. It seemed like they’d walked back in time. Bucky always had the wider stride and Steve struggled to keep up, except for when his friend consciously made the effort to slow himself down. Bucky was like that – always on fire, ready to meet the world, to go to the future as he’d once said to Steve. Now, here they were in the future and so very different than before – their innocence eaten by war and time. Steve wondered if they were truly the same people or had somehow transformed into strangers. That scared him most of all, that his best friend – the person he’d loved as a brother all those years ago – might not be even a tiny bit the same.
“Yeah?” Tony said and couldn’t stop the smile on his face. Being in his forties he shouldn’t feel like a teenager anymore, but damned if his heart didn’t ram a thrilling beat in his chest. “A lot more?” Tony had to quell his reactions a little. He sensed the timid, almost frightened after image of Steve’s astral energies. He couldn’t jump in like he was partying in Monaco. Right here, right now, before him Steve invited and the risk of scaring him away loomed.
As the guards start assembling the manacles and snapping them on Steve, Tony grumbles but then looks up at him. Steve cocks a brow at him and Tony grins. It blossoms in Steve’s chest and he knows he shouldn’t grasp onto it so tightly. Once the arm manacles are locked in place, they lead Steve to the back of one of the SUVs. Tony helps him climb in where the guards continue their work. Steve’s firmly imprisoned in the SUV in short order.
I did want to point out that because of the low traffic on long plotty Stony stories from me, I will probably stop writing WIPs for Stony completely after I finish this story and Code. Unless IW really inspires me, I cannot see trying to fit into my busy schedule long complicated stories with intricate plots and world building that are not of interest to the vast majority of the Stony readers. I don't know what happened to my readers, perhaps it is how the fandom split after CW or maybe the fandom only wants the same tropes over again. I don't know. I have limited time writing so I have to plan for the future based on the evidence of the here and now. I'm sorry to see what's happened to the Stony fandom. I will always love Steve and Tony together, but like I said unless I see something inspiring in IW. These two stories will be my last multiple chapter stories for Stony.
Nothing about the room looked right. This wasn’t his expensive bedroom high up in the clouds of Manhattan. As the door swung open, Tony searched the darkened room for a weapon, anything to defend himself. But it wasn’t his room and in the doorway stood Steve.
Tony throws back his head and barks out laughter. He slaps a hand on his ass. Steve’s cock responds with a jump and his hips spontaneous hump the air. Tony strokes Steve’s ass. “That’s the way. Fuck the air for me.” His two fingers are in Steve’s entrance again, penetrating and spreading him. He thrusts back on the fingers pleasuring himself and feeling the heat of something he’s never experienced before warm his face all the way up to his hairline.
Standing, Steve peels the tape off his ribs and glances over his shoulder at Tony. In a rare moment, Steve’s expression is naked and exposed. There's concern, distracted worry, anxiety, and, strangely enough, fear mixed on his features. He tries to cover but it doesn't work and his face crumples.
“Sure.” Popcorn is great and all, but Tony’s still pretty stuffed from breakfast. He’s not going to be able to keep up with a super soldier’s appetite. That’s why having Thor around is fun. Steve and Thor have eating contests. Once in a while, Bruce joins in especially after the Hulk’s appearance. Thinking about Bruce sullies his mood. He casts the thoughts aside along with the wires and then climbs the rickety stairs back to the main floor.
Tony very much doubts that but decides not to press the point. He crosses his arms over his chest, doesn’t sit down, and knows he’s radiating confrontational prick. “So, you got anything that can help us out?”
“A lot of the old world was plagued with falsehoods and exaggerations. You should know better,” Tony says and he tires of the ridiculous conversation. “On your knees, Omega.”
Ross appears and orders the guards to take Steve into custody. The leg braces are unlocked and the guards haul Steve out of the SUV.
“That’s not how this works.” Tony denies his forgiveness. He paces a little in the bath. “I saw it with my parents. You work for forgiveness. I’m going to earn your trust again, Steve. I’m going to do this for you.” His pace increases.
Later as the evening dusted over the city, Tony set out to go to the safe house that he and Steve were supposed to meet at this weekend. He’d brought Bruce along with a cooler of pig’s blood. The vampire hadn’t had human blood in over a dozen years. They drove Tony’s SUV to the perimeter of the city, leaving the heat and the coven behind them. Bruce refused to say a word. They worked to avoid the checkpoints. It wasn’t hard, Steve always updated Tony on information related to the V-Corps movements when he was able.
“The nanoparticles I was telling you about. Technically nanobots. I still have a lot of work to do on them, but I can basically program them to do these types of commands, and build the suit, do functions of the suit.”
When he was first changed he debated killing himself. After Yinsen sent him to freedom and away from the radical terrorists he truly wanted to end it. Not seeing the sun ripped a hole inside of him. It had been Pepper and Rhodey who’d found him, nursed him back to health, and devised a plan to help him survive. They had been his comfort for all these years. Steve had been his passion and his line to feeling alive again.
“Do you want that? Do you want it?” Tony asks and there is an eagerness in his eyes that is almost child-like in its quality.
Tony tore his attention away from the phantoms and focused on Steve again. It was Steve – robust, healthy, serum enhanced Steve – yet he looked like death.
Yinsen adjusts the thin blanket he uses, takes off his glasses, and places them on the bedside table they share. “Perhaps you should reconsider things. Perhaps it’s not about the next big thing, but about how you can change the little things. Help the helpless.” He turns over then, and leaves Tony to his thoughts – which can be a dangerous thing.
His first inkling that something was amiss arrived in the form of a simple reboot. A need for diagnostics Tony understood; he had built it into every computer system, artificial intelligence, and suit of armor. Diagnostics led to identification of a problem or problems and then finally to a solution. A reboot? That called forth the idea that a problem existed that his diagnostics could not isolate, could not detect. There was an error in the system that was an unknown.
Tony reaches out and grasps Steve’s hand. It seems more intimate than a month should feel. “You’re not losing everything. You’re not.” Steve tightens his grip as if Tony is a lifeline to keeping him stalwart and firmly in place in this reality. Tony can’t get the images out of his head, the reality where this man is supposed to be his husband. He can’t leave it alone. It’s like a loose thread in a sweater that he just tears at, picking and picking until all the weaving comes undone. “The images are too real, Steve. I can’t let you go. I can never let you go.”
Maybe he’s the father of the young girl or her grandpa or something. But that doesn’t make sense either – she’s Russian – Tony got that one for sure. He wraps up the information and tucks it away. He needs to find out more, so he continues, “Your ma, she died when you were eighteen?”
“JARVIS give me a read on any signatures that indicate weapons?” He knows that he might not get great data, but any information would help in this situation.
“And you didn’t chose my side, Nat.” He’s not blaming her or accusing her and she understands that – he sees it in those eyes that hold worlds.
Tony fiddled with his tie. He wasn’t used to wearing decent clothing anymore. During his time as a vampire, he dressed low profile since he spent most of his time wandering the streets or securely in his laboratory at one of his safe houses tinkering away for the good of a company he legally no longer owned. The jacket around his shoulders constricted and he swore to hell and back that the tie was trying to strangle him. He heard the shower in the ensuite bathroom switch off and Tony cursed again. They’d flown to Vienna with the official Wakanda delegation to an emergency meeting of the United Nations Council on Vampire-Human Affairs.
“Christmas music it is,” Tony says. Pulling out his phone he orders, “Friday, put on some instrumental Christmas music. Mix it up some.”
"Yes, tell me where will we venture out to when you take me on these rides? The mountains? The rivers, the long plateaus?"
Steve spies that Hulk won’t be put off for very long. “I’m not too sure we’ll have time to get a grappling hook put together.”
Steve closed his fingers gently over Tony’s lax hand. “I know,” he said thinking of the floor in the Tower in New York. It hadn’t really been his home, not truly. It was a place he stayed.  The whole of this new world to him rankled with a foreignness that both beguiled and bemused but also terrified.
Like any problem, Tony cannot leave it alone. He works on the question even when he shouldn't be teasing at it. When his head should be figuring out the latest propulsion issue of the Jericho missiles, Tony finds himself returning to the feel of Steve under him. He relives the moments of desire but also the long whispers of confusion. The last time he saw Steve after the man got down on his knees and sucked Tony off with those pretty full lips, the secret beckoned. They'd been sitting having a bottle of cheap beer in the hovel of an apartment Steve lived in and shared with him when Tony paid him a good sum of money. Tony glanced around and thought about all that money he'd been offering to Steve for his services.
“Okay, okay.” He squeezes Steve’s arm. “Let’s head out and see if we can get any clues. At least the storm’s let up.”
The night had been everything Tony wanted it to be. The fact he started entertaining romantic thoughts about his omega bothered him. But he’d never had a warrior before. This was the first time he bonded after all. He’d always had drones but this was different. They had a bond and a companionship. He told himself he could draw the line, that he knew the division between their relationship. He kept telling himself that – as they ate dinner and Steven told him stories.
“And Clint?” Natasha says and while she’s not backing down, she’s listening to reason. Russians when it comes right down to it, are a pragmatic people. That’s one good thing about Natasha, she’s a business woman, shrewd, cunning, and reads people like others read the newspaper. And she’s Russian.
Shaking, Tony bends and places his mouth against the sweet gland. He feels like he’s straddling two different worlds. The Steven he saw at the meeting was strong and powerful while this Steven is broken and shattered.
“On the coffee table. The mug is at 7 o’clock on the tray and the cookies are at 2.” Tony hears Steve sips from his mug.
Nodding, Steve excuses himself and finds his way toward Bruce’s rooms. As he walks through the brothel an strangeness spreads through him. For a little over two months, he considered the brothel his home, now feels wrong and distorted. When he thinks of home, Tony comes to mind – and Steve just abandoned him. What kind of ass is he? He gets to Bruce’s door and knocks.
Both Bucky and Sam will try and convince him to stay with them for a few months, but that’s not happening. He needs to stretch his legs; he’s been hiding too long. When Peggy died, part of him withered and dissipated with her. He thought he would never love again. He holed up in an attic apartment like some Bohemian from a romance novel. It did nothing for his psyche and dug a hole in his chest deeper than getting to China. Meeting Tony changed all of that – moved him, filled him up. Instead of trudging through the days, he found himself jumping up and looking forward to what was next. The excitement of discovery and invention thrilled him. His art took on new forms and became more inspired because of it. When he’d been fired, Steve lost all of it.
“We aren’t even reading the same book, Tony,” Steve replies. “You realize he has a spy in Wakanda, right? You realize that you’re playing into his hand.”
No words – Steve can no longer speak. His breathing takes precedence and only high pitched whistle sounds.
“Best friend. You know the drill. Friends in school, caused all kinds of trouble for the teachers. When my Ma died, he was there for me. Said I didn’t have to do it alone, would be with me until the end of the line.” Steve stared into the middle distance. “I couldn’t stay at Brooklyn. The money Peggy and Mike had to use just to buy my meds was prohibited.” He shrugged and faced Tony again. “I took the vid courses. Got signed up with Natasha and she sent the money for the meds even before I was officially on her payroll. She probably saved my life.”
Tony strokes a hand down the side of Steve’s face and smiles. “But? I can wait as long as you need.”
Steve listens. Jarvis is suddenly there, handing him his boots, his coat, his hat. He dons them, thanks Jarvis, and then races through the house, only half noticing that Miss Potts is sitting in the parlor at the desk with an inkwell and pen in hand. He mumbles an apology as he passes her and rushes out of the door. He hurries across the small town to the jailhouse and takes the steps two at a time, not caring about the rickety shape they are in.
“Tony,” Steve said and it startled him out of his reverie. His hand was hot and curled over Tony’s. “We’re all in this together. You don’t have to go it alone either. Together.”
Pepper flips the pages to the contract and points out pertinent sections, especially the salary. Steve gasps a few times along the way and Tony only smiles. He’s generous, very generous. Steve signs both the hard copy and the digital documents. When he glances up at Tony, his face is flush, and Tony reads his biometrics to see that his heart is pounding a mile a minute.
