“Doesn’t count.” he said, pointing at the cat. “He’s a Fairest, he’s cheating.
In his panicked state, Tony noticed that there was a ring on the man’s wedding finger, pulsing with energy. Realization crashed on him as the creature pulled him close to stare a him.
"Ugh, call me Tony, we're all changelings here. And I don't, but Thor's food is neat so it's a good place to hide." he answered, plopping a pastry in his mouth.
"Doooon't... Don't listen to her..." he mumbled. "Don't trust them. Even me. We're all fucked up.
Tony felt his body froze. The weight of one of his real names suddenly on his shoulders. He glared at Fury who was still wearing that infuriating poker face.
While he was working he managed to chat a bit with Bucky while Steve just stayed back, watching silently Tony’s every move. Not with that frown, he meet him with, he seemed curious and interested which made the Wizened smug. Just a little. he liked to impress people with his skills. Something he couldn’t enjoy, since he played the simple car mechanic for a living. He could do so much more but no one wanted someone who had no diplomas to his name. If only they knew who he was… But that wasn’t possible anymore, he shouldn’t go down that road.
Steve never leaves the room.
They get to Tony just in time. He’s barely conscious, his body hanging limp from the ropes tied around his wrist, his hands a sickening purple in colour. That was going to be a bitch to feel the blood flowing back into. (Later, Tony screams about an almost unbearable sensation, a pressure that feels like his hands are being ripped apart, weeks after being rescued.)
So he knew it was only a matter of time before he started pushing Steve away too, for one reason or another.
It’s okay,” Steve hushes, his voice barely a whisper, wrapping warmly around his ear. His hands move to trace lightly around Tonys waist from where he’s facing Steve. At some point, Tonys left hand slipped underneath Steves body, and now grips the back of his shirt tightly. It’s falling asleep. He doesn’t care.
Steve doesn’t say anything more, but he pulls Tony impossibly closer to him, Tonys face now angled upwards towards Steves throat. He can feel Tonys damp eyelashes sweep over his Adams apple. He wraps his arms fully around Tonys waist, clamping on to each other, effectively trapping Tony in all that is Steve.
Steve. Tonys chest was heaving now, his breaths coming in short bursts of air, and Steve tried to ignore the feeling of Tonys hands trembling between them.
Tony hyperventilates when Steve leaves the room to go to the bathroom. He re-entered to find Tony grasping the blankets with white knuckles, stuttering breaths wheezing in through pale lips. His eyes were wide with unseeing fear, entire body trembling.
Distantly Steve knows that this is only the beginning. Tony finally deciding to come to him for comfort isn’t going to immediately fix all this. They both still have a long road ahead of them. One with potholes and detours and twists and turns. Steve knows all this. But he can’t help the overwhelming feeling of relief and happiness as Tony drops into his arms.
as always, lemme know
(See the end of the chapter for
“Just leave it
“FUCK!” The word ripped itself from Tonys throat, raw with anger and exasperation and a million other things Steve couldn’t place. Tony then sat up on the bed, and gave one last glare at Steve, who could only lie there staring at him, all the blood rushing to his ears. Tony tore himself from the bed and out of the room, slamming the door behind him on the way out, leaving Steve alone, drenched in silence. Drowning in it.
) and-
“Tony?” He experimented, voice barely above a whisper, just in case. Tony had immediately stilled against him, muscles rigid. Steve regretted it almost instantly, but there was no going back. “Tony, baby, please,” He knew Tony knew what he was asking, and he knew he was guilt-tripping Tony with the desperation he had let seep into his voice. He waited. He could feel Tony shift minutely against him, seemingly deciding on what to do. Steve thought that if Tony were to roll out of his arms he might not have been able to stop himself from following despite promising himself to let Tony have his space.
But now, Steves eyes stung with hurt and frustration, but not at Tony. His next words toppled out of his mouth without warning.
There are calloused hands framing his face, warm and trembling.
Tony won’t speak about what happened whilst he was gone. Steve learned this early on. Any time anyone began to ask questions about what had occurred while he was in captivity, Tonys eyes would seem to glaze over, unfocusing from the interrogator and usually on a spot behind said person. Steve could always pinpoint the exact second this seemed to occur, and would just wait until the person questioning would notice the fact that their words seemed to go in one ear and out the other, and stop speaking.
He’s cold. But this isn’t foreign. Its just usually he can push that feeling away too, but now the cup seems to be full, and things he tried to stack away overflow.
Steve was pretty sure he didn’t take his eyes off Tony for one second the entire flight home.
out of here now! What’re you thinking?” comes Steve’s voice, loud and saturated with panic. Tony’s choking, his lungs feel like they’re collapsing on themselves, oxygen cut off from entering. He brings his hands to scratch at his throat uselessly, panic clouding his mind, the only clear thought he has being to
Now, the only thing that sets this Tony apart from the Tony from
"I finished school," she said.
He pushed Pepper away when she warned him that one day, Iron Man was going to kill him. Whether that be when the palladium was poisoning him, or just the chances he took of death every time he flew out to save a world that could never be safe. Not really.
“Steve, goddamnit! I said no!” Steve could swear he heard the shout echo off the walls as he was stunned silent by Tonys outburst. Something inside him shattered at the thought that that was the first time since their fight on the helicarrier that Tony had risen his voice at him. The first time since the helicarrier that Tony had furious fire blazing in his eyes because of Steve.
Needless to say, he didn’t go.
The moisture that was collecting in Steves eyes was finally released as tears strolled down his cheeks. Hot and humiliating. Steve didn’t know how to help Tony. This wasn’t a time when he could just curl around Tony and wait it out; no matter in whatever ‘it’ happened to be at the time. This was something much bigger, much deeper. And he didn’t understand how he was supposed to help.
Suddenly, that’s all Tony wants. To be in Steve’s arms. To feel
his ears.
Steve felt like he was going to be sick.
He’s shivering, he distantly acknowledges. Most times, he would bitch about it to Steve. He’s a complainer, everyone knows this. He always vows to stop, and yet, he only ever manages to realize what he’s doing when he’s done. Every time he's cold, it always just slips out, and he always regrets it.
look at me”
That was only some of what he could remember. He knows there’s more, but the days (was it only days?) wore on to a blur, and Tony could only watch himself like a film as he was dragged out of the room and into another, and back into his own, the cycle repeating.
After his explosion, he retreated to his workshop, the only place that had ever felt safe to him since Afghanistan. Except now, after being taken, it doesn’t give him the same sense of security that it once did. The walls seem closer now, the floor colder, the bots lifeless. He doesn’t know what was happening to him.
He pulls his phone out from his back pocket, and tries to find something to distract himself from the way his heart feels as if its being twisted within his chest. It was so much easier to just stay
No, wait. He’s not shivering. He’s shaking.
“No,” Tony growled through clenched teeth. Steve didn’t know if that meant he didn’t remember anything, or he did, but he wished he didn’t.

Steve barely has time to say anything before Tony is suddenly in his arms again, his body shaking with silent sobs.

They have to sedate him.

Tony sees it and he opens his mouth to speak (to say he
It’s like what they say about drowning. How your body instinctively holds it’s breath, despite the panic, the oxygen running out and lungs collapsing in on themselves. The pain almost unbearable, but then when you do take a breath, it’s almost like a relief; peaceful.
He can’t stop thinking about him. His voice when he tried to ask if he remembered anything. The way it trembled as he begged Tony to talk to him, and most painfully, the quiet whimper that Steve tried to swallow down after Tony yelled at him. He should probably go and apologize. But after that he knows what Steve would be expecting. What he deserves that Tony can’t give him just yet. What he tried to get from Tony earlier, before Tony had stormed out of the room, leaving Steve behind.
He’s just not sure if he’s ready to go back there yet. Back to that room, back to what he doesn’t even know. He didn’t know what they wanted, and he didn’t know where he was. What more could he possibly tell Steve? How they tortured him? How they held his head underwater until he saw stars? What they forced his body to endure for far longer than the human body should? How they were relentless, cruel and calculating in their actions? They wanted to make sure that while the marks weren’t physically permanent on his body, they were at least in his mind.
Usually he knew how to help him. Make him feel better, take his mind off something. He always had
oof this chapter was getting so long I had to cut it short.
But every time he looks at Steve, all he can think about is screaming for him until his voice gives out and thinking he’s going to cough up blood. All he can think about is sitting alone, in the dark, the cold air compressing his body from all sides, suffocating him. All he can think about is how Steve wasn’t there.
“I don’t
“Tony, plea-“
“Please, talk to me. What happened there? Do you remember any of it?” Steve tried to keep it short, one question, maybe none at all, but the words were slipping off his tongue before he could stop them.
“Did you order this using my card?” Steve asked, not angry because he really could spare the cash what with all his back pay. But he did wonder how Tony made the payments.
“Fine. But make it a less ungodly hour.”
When Steve headed to the bathroom to wash the cloth he had used to wipe them clean, Tony rolled over onto his back slowly, letting out a hum of contentment. Regardless of how good he felt, he wasn’t going to be moving much any time soon. He was ready to loll about in bed for the rest of the day.
Steve asked, a little quietly even as his hand tightened inadvertently on Tony’s, “So there was no other reason you held the Courting Ceremony?”
“You’re welcome,” Tony said, voice warm. Then he continued, “Let’s talk some more about your strength later. I think it’s time I talked to your boss instead.”
“Hey, maybe you’ll find yourself someone here too,” Natasha said to Bucky with a smirk.
Tony gestured wildly at his own neck, demanding, “Can’t you tell when I’m in heat? Everyone else could. There were all these people who kept coming up to me and there was Vicente and Alexandre circling and circling.”
“That does sound like his kind of joke,” Steve said, knowing he sounded fond.
Tony's eyes are set on a building a block away and when Steve's head whips around he feels his own eyes widen. There is a fire, probably in the kitchen. Even with the distance and through the window Steve can see the walls have already caught on fire and are making their way up to ravage the rest of the house.
Without the haze of heat, it was pretty embarrassing to say aloud. But it was worth it when Steve pressed his whole body to Tony’s side and peppered his shoulder with kisses. Tony turned his head in invitation and received a kiss on the lips for his efforts.
“Doesn’t the interview take ten minutes?” Steve asked, wondering if the other applicants got an approval so easily. It would be dangerous to let just anyone into the ceremony after all.
On one hand, Tony’s warm concern was so sweet, Steve felt like he was melting on the inside, like gooey caramel on a hot day. On the other hand, now Tony had the completely wrong idea and Steve felt like the worst scum to have that level of misplaced concern directed at him.
“I, uh, I’ll get you some clothes to wear,” Steve said, sounding more breathless than he would prefer.
“And a dance,” Steve continued in a groan.
Maybe this was a good thing. He wasn’t very good with words anyway, Steve thought with some hysteria.
Tony murmured, “More than okay,” and looked up with a smile. But something wasn’t right, because his smile was a little wobbly at the edges, and he tugged at Steve’s hand immediately, drawing him inside from the landing zone.
The glass doors to the penthouse opened silently and Steve trailed after Tony, a little worried about Tony’s quieter mood, which was very unlike him.
Oh god, that was really the stupidest answer he could have given. Steve tried, “I have a very bad sense of direction?”
Tony was an independent Omega who didn’t buy into all the stereotypical nonsense perpetuated by the mass media when it came to Omegas.
“…scales?”
Wanda nodded with a blush coloring her cheeks. “Yes, it’s...very useful.”
It was completely irreverent, but Steve found that tinny angry voice and those little waving hands
In a moment of great daring, Steve drew Tony closer until they were pressed chest-to-chest and asked softly, “Does that mean I know who you’ll pick at the end of the ceremony?”
Steve laughed at that and the shocked moment passed, breaking into a cacophony of noise. Tony blew a kiss out to the audience, to the rising applause and cheers. Meanwhile, Steve’s mind was almost spinning from the realization that Tony’s arm was around his waist, which in turn made all of this sink in.
“No, I really don’t think you are. It was an honest mistake,” Steve said. Then realized he forgot the most important part. He looked Tony in the eye with sincere contriteness and embarrassment. “I’m so sorry, Tony. I really am. I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again.”
“I didn’t ask you to dance with me,” Steve said, unable to sound anything but sulky.
The Avengers was a team now for more than three months. But it was a team that felt incomplete...
Bucky was about to reply with a snide response when he blinked in surprise, peering at something behind Steve. He wondered if he was hallucinating, but just in case he wasn’t... “Uhh, Steve. There’s a guy’s head sticking out from the wall behind you.”
...and home.
All he could think about was that Tony organized all this because of him.
Oh god, the big puppy eyes on that little face was just too cute. Those tiny little lashes that rimmed the deep wide eyes was just too much. Steve tried to stay strong, tried to be rational, rubbing his forehead as he stalled. “I don’t know… This is a lot to take in.”
Tony turned his wrist so that his hand was cupping Steve’s cheek, drawing his face up. Steve didn’t know when it happened, but his eyelids had fallen shut. He opened them again now and looked into Tony’s dark eyes, molten with heat.
Seeing Tony’s impatience, Steve finally came up with an idea that could help.
Steve gave up. His cover was completely blown, probably from the very first day, and he had made a right hash of the job. He had told Coulson he wasn’t suitable as an undercover agent, so S.H.I.E.L.D. only had themselves to blame.
“Is it just me or do they seem really unaffected by what happened to them?” Bucky asked, a little plaintive. He felt emotionally drained after a day of shadowing Steve and Tony but the people who should be most affected by the transformation seemed to be taking it completely in stride.
“I’ve no doubt,” Steve said wryly.
“Yes,” Steve interrupted immediately, then looked down and asked quietly, “Don’t you want to…?”
Bucky smirked, looking at Sam from out of the corner of his eyes. “I save the charm for those who still need charming. This guy’s a sure thing.”
Steve’s eyes widened before he blinked rapidly.
Sweet relief swept through him and Steve closed his eyes just for a second as he relished the sound of that voice in his mind. He opened his eyes and looked down, seeing a small bobbing figure, a tiny hand against his shin. It was such a light touch, he hadn’t even felt it.
Steve sighed. “Tony, no.”
“And admit it, it’s a
Bucky stared at the cat and dog in the middle of the street. The cat was a black cat with white paws and a white chest. He had a white face except for black markings above his mouth that made it look like he had a moustache. Bucky wished he could sneak a photo because that cat just looked ridiculously cute. There was also a round glowing blue light sitting in the middle of his fluffy white chest. The cat was currently hissing at the large dog beside him, hackles raised.
Steve had never hated a word as much as ‘friendly’.
Tony shushed her while looking around. “Keep that down, the press is still flipping out over that. They can’t prove I didn’t dance with anyone else but people are actually trying to do some crazy investigative journalism over it to prove that my Courting wasn’t fair.”
“That’s why you opened it up to everyone earlier, allowed courtship of other people at your ceremony,” Steve said with dawning realization. “Were you trying to set me up with someone?” Steve asked abruptly, trying to process all of this.
“How are we going to turn them back?” Bucky asked what was clearly the most important question.
After the bath, Tony had curled up in a nest of clean cloths — including Steve’s own T-shirt that he had sacrificed for the cause — and fallen asleep on the workbench. Even his snoring, which was much less peaceful when he was in full size, sounded adorable and tinny now. Tony’s sleeping face, with slightly parted lips and those tiny dark lashes fanned across his cheeks, was somehow even more adorable, which Steve hadn’t known was even possible.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony looked back down at the gorgeous long and thick cock between Steve’s legs, so hard it was pointing up, almost like Steve’s cock was proudly displaying every pink ridge and lovely vein to Tony’s eyes. His cock hadn’t knotted yet, but it would, Tony was sure of it.
Steve immediately pulled the glass away, tipping it upright again. There was the salty tang of seawater on his lips, but he hadn’t drank any. And he certainly hadn’t drank Tony. That would have been impossible, Tony wasn’t small enough to accidentally be drunk down.
Sam said with raised eyebrows, “Wait, back in the old timey days, wasn’t bonding during heat also about having sex for the first time during heat? Wasn’t that the whole point? Are you guys telling me you aren’t having sex, because I don’t believe it.”
Before Steve could ask if they had developed a plan yet, the attacker was edging out of the cafe with Tony held right in front of him, a knife right to Tony’s throat. Steve froze at the sight. That blade was resting against Tony’s carotid artery. The wrong move, and Tony could bleed out even before the ambulance arrived.
“I can’t believe no one called me immediately and I had to find out from the army that Tones has been turned into a
“That would be a good idea,” Steve said inanely, trying not to stare at Tony’s face, at the quirk of his lips. But then his eyes shifted to the overly large shirt Tony was wearing — he was wearing
Steve smiled. He could do that.
Tony looked at him with solemn eyes and asked again,
Steve blinked. His language... He didn’t know why he hadn’t ever considered how Tony spoke and read english. It didn’t make sense that an underwater race of people would also speak english. Although there had been a lot going on that first day so Steve had been understandably distracted.
. Was this a side-effect of dating Tony Stark? Would all the bizarre results of their superhero life just come across as superhumanly cute instead?
From behind, Bucky heard Doctor Strange mutter, “Not even a word of thanks, what douchebags.”
The merman sat sideways, propped up by one hand with his tail to balance him. He gestured imperiously with his free hand again.
But M’Baku didn’t stop prowling forward, instead he walked past his designated seat and swooped down quickly to hold Tony’s chin, pressing a swift kiss to Tony’s parted lips. Before Steve could jump onto stage and rip M’Baku’s arms off, M’Baku had stepped back and was sitting down on the stool prepared for him.
“Alright, listen up, punk.” Bucky stared hard and tightened his grip, obviously trying to impart some important but comforting advice. “You’re screwed when it comes to the dancing.”
“He’s crazy,” Natasha sighed.
Instead, Steve only got right up to the stage and looked up in time to see Tony striding onto the stage. Thankfully, he was still wearing his black suit with the open collared golden shirt, and he hadn’t changed back into his dark red waistcoat with no shirt attire. At least that meant Steve had more working brain cells to spare.
They were having their weekly video call. Bucky was living in Wakanda now, having chosen a peaceful and quiet existence after Shuri had managed to remove the trigger words from his mind. Steve of course was still gallivanting around the world, trying to go where he was needed with Natasha and Sam, even though they were all fugitives from the law.
“Peggy was always special,” Steve murmured.
he enthused.
Steve smiled. Yeah, he would take that.
The blue throw was knocked askew during that impressive move, only draped over one elbow now. Steve could see the silver, blue, red and gold bracelets on Tony’s other wrist. He picked up that hand and kissed the bracelets, kissed Tony’s pulsepoint, relished in their mixed scents.
“Yes, right. You’re right,” Tony said, a little distracted, eyes drawn back to Steve and that Omega.
That seemed to break Tony out of his surprise at least, since he rolled his eyes. “You know what I mean.”
“And cheeseburgers,” Steve continued, also thinking about how Tony hovered when he had some meat patties for cheeseburgers on a grill.
Fury stopped at the side of the couch, not moving any closer. Surreally, he was still holding the two pizza boxes. “Who the hell are you?”
Blinking slowly, Tony gave Steve a sly look. “Would you care to help me apply the theory to more practice? There’s a lot I’ve read which I’ve imagined doing with you.”
And the always fluent Tony, who always had a quip and a smart comeback on the tip of his tongue seemed at a loss of words. A hushed silence fell across the thousands of people staring up at the stage, feeling the unexpected weight of the moment, realizing Tony’s seriousness after all his previous flippancy.
“You don’t know how to dance? Dancing at this kind of thing is not unusual,” Natasha said with a frown, probably disappointed at Steve’s failure to research this mission properly.
Tony’s eyes were wide, fixed on Steve like he could drill into his brain and read his thoughts.
“What was it?” Sam asked out of curiosity.
He looked up, and even at this size, even being so small, Steve could still see the bright heat in them, recognize the lust and trust.
Clapping Vision on the shoulder, Clint asked, “I always meant to ask but what’s your primary gender then? You don’t have any scent, so it’s hard to tell.”
And waited.
Then he startled again as his hand and the front of his shirt were suddenly drenched in scalding hot liquid.
So what did he have to offer Tony? His body was strong and healthy, but it wasn’t a result of his own work. He wasn’t smart. He wasn’t nice. He wasn’t an instinctively nurturing Alpha, like some who found the urge to care for all Omegas. He was more likely to give them pep talks and lead them out to battle rather than trying to keep them completely free from harm. He was good at giving rousing speeches, not being a caring and protective Alpha.
So of course they ended up meeting again in the middle of a universe-saving battle and
And Tony’s face… It was at once familiar and foreign. Steve had drawn that face countless of times, the little lashes against pale cheeks, that mischievous smile. But it was somehow different when human-sized and seen from a few feet away, rather than a small face that Steve had to peer at usually from afar.
Steve was quickly swarmed by his friends, receiving back thumps and shoulder clasps.
This was where Steve had cheated somewhat, and he held his breath, wondering if Tony would decline the gift like he did with the man who had given him multiple cars. But Tony had accepted a whole chest full of antique books and a basket of various pastries and bread earlier too so maybe this would pass muster?
Tony continued, rambling a little, “I know I look pretty good for my age so it might come as a surprise to you that I’m past the age for child-bearing. It’s something you should think about—”
“Bucky told Nat who told me that you haven’t been to any Courting Ceremonies before, not as an adult. She said you only went to a few when you were too young to even participate,” Tony said in a rush of words.
“You know, like whether this is a courtship with the aim to eventually get married if all goes—”
Tony looked sceptical, but he waved his hand at Happy, letting the kiss go. “I’m surprised to see you here, M’Baku. I didn’t think you were interested.”
about your Courting Ceremony was regular.”
Steve cried out, “Tony, are you okay? Are you hurt?”
“Sure thing, Kev,” Tony said with a shrug, looping an arm through Steve’s. “Can we go, Steve? I’m kind of
“It’s because you’reㅡ”
Steve tugged his jacket down nervously, feeling like it was too bold a choice. Everyone looked amazing and confident. He wondered if he came across a little bit like a clown.
Steve sighed and stepped aside.
“Yeah, well…” Tony bites the inside of his cheek, trying not to look like he’s pouting. “I can’t fix it. I didn’t pack tools. I should have known something was going to go wrong.”
Other than his pride, which might never recover again.
Tony said, looking up from his work to wave the tiny wrench around.
Steve did.
Steve pulled away and licked his flushed wet lips, the sight surely enough to drive better men to madness.
Tony clomped over to Steve quickly, faceplate raised. “Are you okay?”
“I can’t believe that bottom-dwelling scum sucker is here.”
“Oh god, it’s Captain America’s arch nemesis: dancing,” Sam said under his breath, which earned him an elbow in the ribs from Wanda. “What! It’s true! You need to calm down, Steve. It’s not like you can learn to dance now, it’s too late.”
Tony feels his eyebrows raise, “Right. Well, they’re lucky nobody’s robbing their store blind.”
That got Tony lifting off the tablet and looking up in interest. When he reached out a hand, Steve immediately touched his finger to that little hand.
It was unusual because typically, Steve was the one who had to push Tony to come along with him. He was frequently worried that Tony cooped himself up all day indoors, never seeing sunlight that wasn’t filtered through windows. Steve had tried to institute daily morning swims in the sea to which Tony had bargained it down to morning swims every three days. It tended to be less than that because sometimes Tony got stuck into work right after breakfast and refused to go out.
about Courting Day ceremonies. It’s supposed to be about who you like.”
Steve’s eyes snapped back up to see Tony’s dark brown eyes, staring right at him. Oh god, he had been caught staring.
Steve realized that if he spoke up now, he might have a chance to convince Tony not to disqualify him.
Sam turned with a frown. “Uh oh, what?”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Please, I’m Tony Stark. I couldn’t pay people to stop paying attention.” He stepped closer to the two of them, teeth bared in a very unfriendly grin as he said, “And if you decide in any way to use your political clout to oppose me or the Avengers in any shape or form, or if I see you behave like a disgusting feral Alpha to anyone else, you’ll be sure that your current unprofessional behavior will be on all the news reels. I’ll dig out every dirty secret you have and play it like a trombone across every news channel in every country around the world.”
The strength behind the words made Tony feel warm deep in his gut and he knew he had a somewhat dopey smile on his face. Leaning forward, he rubbed his cheek against Steve’s before pulling back and smiling at him.
“Tony…” Steve said, eyes roving over Tony’s face, alight with pleasure. “My Tony…”
Tony huffs and Steve rolls his eyes good naturedly. It’s not that Tony can’t walk, it’s that he chooses not to unless it’s absolutely necessary. Even then, he tries not to be charitable about it. Steve tries to soothe some of the pain of walking by throwing an arm over Tony’s shoulders but Tony eyes him like he knows what’s up. That doesn’t stop him shuffling closer so that he can take advantage of the inches and bulk Steve has on him.
He just missed Tony. That was all.
Pulling himself closer, Tony plopped himself onto Steve’s shaking chest, scent marking those firm muscles with his cheek liberally before letting himself lie down to listen to Steve’s heartbeat. When he looked up, Steve’s blue gaze was soft and indulgent. Steve curved a large hand around Tony’s skull, stroking through his hair. If Tony could purr, he would definitely be purring. Steve’s hand in his hair, Steve’s steady heartbeat in his ear, Steve’s wonderful bare skin stretched out for him to touch at any time. Tony sighed happily and ran a hand over Steve’s shoulder and bicep, enjoying how it flexed when Steve patted him.
“You can also mix different scents to get the perfect fit,” Lee said with a bright offer. “What other scents does this person like?”
“You met Tony Stark today,” Nat continued. “What did you say to him?”
Tony blinked, and then blinked again. Then he cracked up, doubling over in laughter. Steve stood there in mortified silence but tried to maintain a stoic facade. Finally, Tony wiped the tears from his eyes and he asked in a wobbly voice, clearly trying not to continue laughing, “The new age dance fitness exercise is why you can take down half a dozen robots?”
Steve asked with awe, “So that’s what you’ve been working on all this time? An arc reactor, a combination of tech with magic?”
He noticed how Steve consciously or subconsciously shielded Tony from everybody. And it wasn’t just because this morning had been hard; he’d always done it. Bucky had just never paid it much mind.
Thor was worried still but he slowly let go of his arms and instead tried to hug the scared hero. Then, right as the god thought the nightmare was subsiding, Tony began screaming again. Howling yells filled with hysteria.
“ I don’t understand Thor, what’s going on??” Steve basically screamed into the phone.
It gave Bucky a chance to observe them.
As soon as Steve answered, Thor started speaking, “ Captain, I am with your beloved in your chambers. You must come quickly. It seems he is having a horrible nightmare and he has hurt himself, I fear he will only damage himself more if we cannot calm him.”
Then he turned to Thor, Sam, and Bucky who at this point were more worried then ever and very confused and tried to explain what they had just witnessed. He started with,
“ He um…he has nightmares a lot, still. Even after all these years he still can’t shake ‘em off. Although, this one is the worst he’s had in the whole two years we’ve been sharing a bed. His nightmare most likely triggered the panic attack. And waking up alone was probably bad too. Usually, I’m there when they happen and I can usually stop them before they get too bad. Today though, I wasn’t there when the nightmare woke him up and it escalated. “
“Let’s say we’re even now.”
“Look agent, you’re going to have to wait.”
“I’m not going any further. You either bring them here or I’m leaving.” he said, feet rooted in the ground.
Our stony couple is on a rough start but it'll get better ! (but it's probably going to be a sloooooow burn x,D )
“... Are the others aware?” Carbonnel suspiciously asked.
"Fury doesn't see us as pets. Stop being childish.
“Why are we even helping him? Is this a deal between a pack, are we on negotiations with other non-humans?
From the shadows that made her clothes, she pulled out something. Tony frowned at it and took it carefully. It was the picture of a very pretty redhead. Looking defiantly at the camera with the same intensity when she had met him. He turned it between his hands before asking wearily:
“I can’t get drunk. I tried. And my name is Steve...” the Fairest mumbled tiredly.
(See the end of the chapter for
When the three of them were on the threshold, Bucky pushed Steve slightly forward. Making him face the Wizened who looked as surprised as the blond. The wolf jerked his chin in his direction before walking away from the entrance with one last goodbye for Carbonnel. The exchange was odd for Tony but not for the Fairest who seemed to be displeased by his attitude. But he took a deep breath and did what was asked of him. Gazing directly at Tony he said:
Steve flinched and clutched his hand to his chest. Tony could admire how his blue eyes seemed to turn different shades of dark blue before going back to normal. Tony could only stare at them and had to blink a few times to snap out of it.
“Coulson only came once as far as I know.
“What?” the werewolf asked, eyebrows rising. “He asked, I delivered. I know the whole folk story is that we infect people but that’s bullshit. We are not a disease. Plus not every kid born from a werewolf line has werewolves capacities.
, so thank you but that won’t be enough. Unless you want me to use your wyrd instead?
“Are all changelings this relaxed about their... nature?” Bucky looked cautiously to his friend who shrugged. “I can’t say I understand but I know it’s no good memories.
Fury turned on his heels and started to walk deeper in the garden, followed by Steve and Goose. Tony wondered if he was the only person who didn’t follow Fury blindly. Sadly, at this moment, he was there for business. So with a sigh, he begrudgingly went after them. The moss and plants seemed to merge together the further they went, rising up high above and turning to a semblance of oak trees. A sick feeling started to grow in the changeling’s stomach. The way the place seemed wide but stifling at the same time, the lack of sense in the flora surrounding them….
“I’m going to make you a fulfilling lunch my friend." Thor decided with a nod. "With a good glass of mead for the soul and some meat to put on those bones."
“Laugh? Make a joke about what happened to us, that’s your solution?” Steve drawled, glaring at him.
“Well bud, when a werewolf loves another werewolf, or human, very much, they fuck and pop out a litter.
The thought of Jarvis smiling at him made his chest ache with pain. He wanted to have his old friend back. He was…
"As I said, don't read too much into it. All of us tend to end up wandering here." Even when they don't want to.
It was beautiful. Marble Stone in the form of a large muscular man sleeping peacefully. He was depicted lying on his back, large hands on his chest, the features completely relaxed. The whiteness of his skin making him stand out even more in the green of the place. Every strand of hair was carved in detail, even the lashes throwing shadows on the cheeks. And the size of it probably could rival Thor’s own height. What was strange was the fact that the statue had clothes on, pretty boring ones at that: a thin shirt and white trousers that looked more of a pyjama than anything else. They got slightly wet with the humidity, sticking on the chest and hard stomach of the piece. Well, it left little to the imagination and Tony had to give an A+ for that.  As he knelt by it, he felt some wyrd coming from the carved man. The changeling frowned at that. Did Fury let some changelings do some experiments on a work of art? Wouldn’t be the first time but to leave it here, where every meeting took place, It had to be important. He went to touch the cheek, trailing his fingers over the cold stone feeling no default in it.
The pub was bustling at lunchtime. Valhöll had a little menu for anyone who wanted to take a snack or a little lunch. Most changelings only came here to drink away their past and worries. To be fair, Tony was no stranger to this habit alas that was not his purpose today. Since the place was busy, he wasn’t on the receiving end of glares and whispers from his folks which was a nice change. He could see some humans chatting happily among themselves and sometimes mixing with changelings, unaware that they were in the main buildings of the Court. Tony could see some of his pairs happily talking back but the majority just stayed away, uncomfortable. The mechanic slipped past the crowd to reach the bar, he needed a drink. Or two. He hoped no one would come up to bother him because he really wasn’t in the mood. Luckily, no one wanted to talk to him anyway.
Two large arms circled the newcomer and squeezed him against a large chest. Tony yelped and tried to break free but the hug just got tighter.
“We are ready to offer a good price for your services. More than mundane money, Carbonnel.” the changeling said with a pointed tone, grating Tony’s nerve.
The Wizened jumped at the loud voice and then felt his ribs being crushed under strong arms. He tried to squirm away from Thor’s… Heavy affection but after three seconds he just let himself go limp. Maybe he’ll think he’s dead and the elemental will let him go.
“You don’t know
“Good talk. So now,  I’m going home and don’t bother calling again. I’m not helping you.
The last thing he managed to see, was Steve's hand putting something soft over him. The ring on his finger shining softly in the light of the pub. Only then slumber took him.
Well, he did have it. At first he was just talking about random stuff with Steve but every time the glass emptied he took another. Then another. The random subjects turned into small debates about baseball, then it turned into Tony talking about wyrd and toaster. Finally it ended on Bucky's order and by then, the Wizened well kept up appearance got a bit dishevelled. He has now managed to lose his shoes (don't ask), was sitting on the ground with other's customer's napkins and was trying to explain to Steve the mechanics of wyrd with the prosthetics. His drawings and calculus were incomprehensible but Steve tried to listen and participate a bit.
“ Well let me make my own assumptions. I have in front of me a changeling who spent 10 years without even looking for a Court, who doesn’t know shit about our society and now knows better. You must be incredibly smart! Or just full of yourself. I also can see you’re not letting go of that ring who stinks Fae, and since you’re a Fairest, it doesn’t seem stupid to think you’re more than a favourite. You were a lover, a high-class mistress for one of Them. “
“Money. I’m probably going to drain myself in enchanting his arm and you want to leave me with just some mundane money? I’ve got already many clients to pay my rent,
Now he has to deal with all of this. At least there was alcohol. Plus, when Thor came back with a homemade burger, Tony begrudgingly agreed that it looked and smelled pretty nice. Moreover, after the first bite, he wolf it all down, because it was a really good burger. He tried to ignore the satisfied smile of the Elemental as he finished the last of his crumbs.
Bravado back, Tony unbuttoned his shirt down, revealing human skin and chest hair at the poor Steve who looked back up, dumbfounded and eyes wide. Tony laughed at his expression.
Tony thought.
“Shit, he didn’t tell you?” the man seemed surprised. “I’m a werewolf. Born and raised.”
Steve snorted at that and shook the offered hand.
"I offer quality content unlike many thieves in New York so yeah. I have plenty of regulars who trust me and spread my reputation throughout the city. I guess that a little wyrd here and there goes a long way."
Was it possible that people were untrusting because he was a Fairest? Tony also had some prejudice against him but that didn't stop him from talking to Steve. Is it because he usually hang out with Bucky and they don't feel like mixing with a human too? (So far only Tony and Fury (and his little spies) knew that bucky was a werewolf and not just a regular human)
"No fighting. And no mean girls chatter. The mood sour too easily already."
Tony rubbed his chin thoughtfully. He’ll probably need to see Bucky shifting from human to wolf and back to human to have an idea of the spell he needs to work on.
That was the start if the fight. That lingering gold who never left his wedding finger and who seemed to ooze with wyrd. Logic, Imagination and emotions. This thing was filled to the brim with emotions.
“It has always been a thing. But Werewolves cannot see our changelings appearance so they think we're humans. Also their packs are rare in large cities. It was quite a surprise when Rogers brought him here.”
“Look, wyrd is weird, pun intended. It feeds on three things: logic, imagination and emotions. Logic because it needs to settle in reality. Imagination because you’re creating something with it. Emotions because emotions always fuck things up.”
“You can look all you want Rocky but you’re not going to see anything changeling about me.”
"I-ha- I want-ha- compensation for this near murder! And put those doughnuts in a doggy bag, I'm not eating them where I'm vulnerable.
“Maybe I did. And that would make the touching even creepier, let’s stay on that first scenario. I’m Tony, by the way, you’re the dude who needs my services?”
He looked at the Fairest at that who sighed in exasperation. But at least Barnes gave a small chuckle at the name.
“I… Well, the barkeeper was nice?” the fairest said awkwardly, rubbing his neck.
He took a step closer to Steve who also took the bait and took a step forward, his solid body moving with fluidity even when made of marble. Bucky tried to grasp his arm, stop his friend from the confrontation but the blond man shook him off.
Fury didn’t even blink at the comment but the man next to Tony looked horrified by the casual insult. Goose sniffed the hand that was still held out for him and jumped, purring into the man’s arms. The mechanic had to agree with the cat on this one, those arms seemed to be a wonder to be in.
"All the more reason to let me in peace here no? Fury must be glad, he has all his pets in one place.
“Will you one day use my name?
"Pretty sure he wasn't going to make you pay anyway." a smooth voice noted behind him.
Tony had to trot a little to keep up with the tall legs of the barman. Thor had this slight default of not realizing how much people struggle to keep up with him. On the good side of things, even though he was loud, he was friendly and always smiling.  Quite different from the other gloomy changelings which were probably why Fury was keen on keeping him. As the smaller changeling caught up with him he wondered for how long had the elemental been there. When Tony arrived at the court a couple of years back, Thor was already there working as the barman/server at Valhöll. They’ve met, Thor hugged him and for the next hour, Tony would get electric choc whenever he touched something. Since Tony didn’t stay long among the changelings he never got to learn much about Thor. He knew that he made his peace with being a changeling, actually bosting when he claimed to be an elemental and being able to wield thunder and lightning. Of course, he never showed anyone his powers so he was probably lying. It is too hard to use the magic, the wyrd, their body is made of, for your own benefit. You lived with it, sometimes it does shit without you being able to do something about it. That’s it.
Tony Carbonnel actually looked at his client when he said that. Deigning to roll out from under the car he was working on. The man was dressed up in a suit, sharp and still in the middle of his workshop. He looked uptight at first glance and was glaring at the mechanic
"Meh. If you get it it's good enough.
Opening a door and he slipped inside a maze of corridors and doors. Tony, when he first arrived here, learnt the hard way that the place was enchanted to guide people forward and away as Fury’s wishes.
, Tony thought.
“Most don’t. But between moping and laughing at it, pardon me, but I’ll choose the second option.
“That’s the spirit! Let me take you to the back. The sooner the better !” the larger changeling offered and then stormed off towards the back of the pub.
Of course, Goose, not caring about his feelings, just kept purring and rubbing his head against the rough hand. He may be part changeling, he was still a cat. So Tony just sighed and kept petting it, waiting for the others to come back.
"I'm not planning on letting her find me. New York is big enough to hide from someone.
“We tell them there are other non-human beings and when they are ready they come to ask for more information. It isn’t the easiest subject to breach when many of them are still reeling from their trauma and identity.
“What. The. Fuck?”
"Well, I do try to keep a happy mood when I'm working. After all, even here, not many of us find the strength to do so. I see it as my duty to stand strong for them.
“He’s implying that you are a Fae’s favourite. He reached out fascinated by you while you were sleeping, didn’t he? Changelings aren’t usually easily impressed or influenced, only Fairest has that trait and it’s given by the Fae who kidnapped them.
“Will you make him the prosthetic he needs?
He felt some of the clients turn to glare at him as he said that. He didn't bother to spare them a glance as he downed his drink. He felt justified in his feelings, and even put himself in the same lot: he was not a kind man. Pushing away people and leaving as soon as he could to shield himself away. Not matter how much Thor insisted to talk or making him feel welcome. Even the whole situation with Jarvis is just him indulging in a selfish fantasy where he could feel human. No. He didn't deserve the warmth of others. Though he had to admit, when Tony arrived he had appreciated the elemental care and smiles. It made him feel at home. But Valhöll can't and shouldn't be home. It was more like a twisted version of Hotel California. Some danced to remember, some danced to forget. And oh, how many of them tried to forget the outside world in there.
Thor's eyes widened for a second before he let out a booming laugh.
"It's not evening! It's mid-afternoon-" he stopped when he saw the streets outside basking in the sunset. He looked back at Steve who had a smug expression on his face. "Well, when you put it like that. BUT it's not nighttime yet, so drinks should still be on the table.
“Steve Rogers, I’ll remember not to piss you or your workshop off.”
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that you had no emotions.” It was honest at least. He looked expectantly at Tony, probably waiting for an excuse from him too. After all, he hadn't been kind either. Sadly for him, Tony was stubborn and didn’t want to say it back just yet.
Finally a new chapter! Sorry for the long updates (again^^" life tends to get in the way)
“You are here for pleasure I hope! I have some new mead for you to taste, join me !” he loudly declared, making some clients glare at him.
The surprise and the recognition of the voice made the Wizened swallow down the wrong pipe and he started choking on the pastry. Widow's expression didn't move in the slightest but she tilted her head on the side as he struggle to breathe. To those who knew how to read her, they would be able to say that she was amused by the sight. After all, it was quite a scene to see a grown man acting like a fish out of water. Thor took mercy upon him and hit him heavily on the back so he could spit out the murdering doughnut. He gulped down a few lungfuls of air before waggling his finger at the Darkling.
Ah. Tony's poker face was on point today because he managed to say that it was going well and that it just needed a few tweaks and twerks left. The truth was, he left it a bit behind when he learnt about Potts. He did his research on her and discovered that she was working for Stane Entreprises. Obie's society was a conversion of Stark's Enterprise, not long after 'Tony' died. (To be fair he didn't like to think about it. About how Obie turned his father's legacy, something that was handed to him and taken by someone else. Even if that someone was a part of his family). At least he managed to bounce after the tragedy. But that didn't explain why Potts could have a clue on Tony. So hedged dig back deeper. And by that, he meant hacking and pulling every string and statement on social media to link her to his past life.
Bucky felt for his childhood fiend. Steve had always been so caring, and knowing how much he loved Tony, he understood how it would affect him too. Bucky’s eyes wandered to the scratches on Tony’s arms.
“Thor?” mouthed Sam at Bucky who was now on alert seeing his best friend so distressed. Bucky gave Sam a similarly confused but now also worried face before turning to put a hand on Steve’s shoulder.
It was true. She had only been working for Tony and Pepper for about six months, but it was enough to tell she was infatuated with Rhodey.
Once they finished they also took their leave quietly, catching a glimpse of Steve taking of his shoes and climbing into bed to spoon Tony as they left.
Steve only smiled, " I've seen the way you look at her. And the way she gets nervous when you come around. You deserve some happiness."
But it didn’t seem like Steve cared or noticed.  The sheets on the bed were partly covering Tony’s thighs and were protecting his modesty. But they left his whole upper torso open for the ex-assassin and Sam to see.
So Steve kissed Tony sweetly on the nose before heading to the common floor where all the Avengers hung out. He met with Bucky and Sam and then the three of them made their way out to central park to run.
“Yea, I wonder what’s up with Stark?”
All the Avengers now settled down to listen in on Rhodey's side of the conversation.
Tony lauughed, and somehow moved between Steve's back and the couch, hiding from Rhodey.
Once he’d untangled himself from Tony and tucked him back into the covers to make sure he stayed warm, Steve got ready for his usual morning run. Sometimes Sam joined him, other times Bucky.  Today, he sent out a text asking who was up for a run and surprisingly they both answered yes.
" What did I tell you Rhodey?" Asked Tony, now siting next to Steve.
Steve listened for less than a minute before answering, “ I’ll be there in less than five minutes Thor. Just…just try to keep him from hurting himself too much. Hold him down if you need too. Ill be there as fast as I can.” Then he hung up and started running home.
Then, Bucky gasped out loud. Tony’s breathing turned erratic and his eyes semi-rolled into the back of his head before closing. His whole body went slack in Steve’s arms.
“ Mr. Odinson if you would please make your way to Master Starks bedroom at once. Is seems he is having a panic attack and I can’t wake him up.”
Steve bent over and kissed Tony’s slack mouth and murmured so quietly, only Thor and Bucky heard with their enhancements,
But it seemed like Tony couldn’t calm down, he continued to scream and sob, and it seemed like he wasn’t even hearing what his boyfriend was saying.
His eyes were closed and his face was wet with tears.
“ He must be pretty panicked if he couldn’t even wait for the elevator”
He looked like he was suffering greatly, stuck in his horrible nightmare, and Thor wished he could end his suffering.
The tranquility was broken by a loud noise startling the Avengers.
He also noticed how at peace Stark looked. Normally, the billionaire was not one for physical contact. He shook hands with business partners or sometimes patted the team on the shoulder after a battle, but prolonged contact like this?
Instead, Tony continued to scream into Steve’s shoulder, to claw at his back, bloodshot eyes wildly looking around the room but never settling. His screaming eventually dialed down but only when he started hyperventilating.
" Whatever man, your still gonna get it for this." Rhodey replied, but there was no malice to his words. In fact, he was smiling.
Bucky came back and between the remaining three, they disinfected the long scratches Tony had given himself in his panic. Only one was deep enough that it needed a butterfly bandage in a few spots.
Rhodey blushed behind his dark complextion. He put his head in his hands and sat down heavily on the same couch where Steve and Tony where.
But Steve just sighed, it seemed, in relief. He turned his head to kiss Tony’s cheek before slowly lowering his unconscious body to the bed; He laid his head on a pillow and arranged him comfortably making sure he was covered where it counted.
As Rhodey stalked off to his floor, Tony pecked Steve quickly on the lips and ran back off to his lab.
Just another normal day at Avengers Tower.
At this Thor froze and then instantly went into action. The elevator, which had been going up this whole time, quickly stopped at the penthouse level and Thor rushed out.
Steve sighed; he looked down at Tony and held his limp hand.
No sooner had Steve replied and Thor hung up for Tony to snap out of his nightmare. The screaming stopped. Just like that, as Thor gripped his forearms to keep him from scratching himself, Tony’s eyes snapped open. Tony took heaving breaths, his eyes wild and bloodshot looking around the room.
He’d woken slowly and calmly, smiling when he realized Tony was half on top of him. Steve was lying on his back and Tony was on his side next to him. His leg was thrown over Steve’s leg, his arm was curled around Steve’s waist and his head lay on Steve’s chest.
“ It’s okay baby, you’re okay. I’m here and you’re fine. Just try to calm down and try to relax. I’ll be here when you wake up.”
Rhodey jumped, "Tony NOOO!"
The loud noise quickly followed by the sound of people running up from the lab and the sound of fisghting.
As soon Bucky said this, the elevator doors opened. Sam and Bucky stepped out and fast-walked to where Jarvis led them. They came upon Thor first, standing at the foot of a gigantic bed. On the bed was Steve facing the headboard, back to Sam and Bucky, holding on to a hysterical crying Tony.
Both Steve and Tony had ended up having breakfast and lunch alone in the penthouse to give Tony time to recover, but they had joined for movie night.
Tony ran out first from the stairs into the common floor, he was smiling and flushed. His laughs showed how out of breath he was. He quickly ran to where Steve had sat down again, jumping on his lap and holding on.
Bucky was just fixated on the way Steve was desperately trying to get Tony to calm down and take a deep breath.
" I will pick you up at seven tomorrow night then. Yes, goodbye."
Bucky laughed loudly at this while Sam groaned,
In the middle of a King sized bed with white linens, was Tony. White sheets that were twisted and tangled around his body and soaked with sweat. Tony was laying down in the middle, face pressed into a pillow screaming in fear. His face was twisted in pain, his back was tense and there were scratches all down his torso and arms. Well, as much of his torso as Thor could see.
Tony was crying, sobbing wetly onto Steve’s shoulder. His eyes were shut tight and he was muttering things neither man could decipher, except for the quiet gasps of Steve’s name.
Both of them left with a whole new world of feelings to process, and after the elevator left them in the common floor they each went their separate ways.
He reached as if to tear the phone, that was already ringing from Tony's hand. But Steve expertly dodged it and pulled Tony safely behind him.
" Hello?" said Rhodey into the phone.
Rhodey groaned loudly and threw his hands up. " UGH, why do you have to be such a pain in my ass Tones??? Huh? Come on man, you cant embarrass me like that."
Steve’s demeanor quickly changed though. Bucky saw his grip on the phone tighten and his face paled a bit.
Steve smiled again when he remembered how Tony had welcomed him home the night before, as Steve had been gone on a month-long mission.
Afterwards, they went to bed still naked and had had sex again before falling asleep wrapped up together, warm under the covers.
BACK AT THE TOWER
" Yes Hello Nikki, its Tony. No we don't need you for anything, I actually just had a quick question, are you single??" Tony was smiling manically into the phone and Rhodey had his eyes shut. The rest of the Avengers looked on fondly. Tony laughed, " No I'm not hitting on you Nikki, I'm spoken for. I'm asking for a friend. Yes it is Rhodey. Really, well then would you like to get coffee with him sometime?"
He was happy for them.
Steve stood up, worried about Tony. But soon he realized it was just Tony and Rhodey.
Steve and Tony have been together for over two years, but the rest of the team doesn’t know he still struggles with his past kidnapping experiences and the wormhole and Ultron and such. Tony and Pepper never dated, and Tony is a very private person, good at making sure people only see what he wants them to see.
With his face mushed into the side of his neck, Steve could feel every warm breath Tony let out against him. Deep and even.
Rhodey sat back down, groaning. At this time, Tony perked up, someone had answered the phone call.
Steve, probably panicked, voiced his confusion at this random call from Thor but from Tony’s phone. So Thor clarified quickly that Tony was in a bad state and to hurry.
There, Tony was waiting already naked in the tub. Steve quickly joined him and they’d had passionate sex.
" Nope, Nu-uh, no way you get this back. Unless you promise to ask her out on a date, otherwise, ill do it for you"
Bucky was confused, he had a lot of questions about Tony now, like, why would he hurt himself? But as he saw his friend take off like hellhounds were after him he didn’t question it. He just nudged Sam and took after his friend.
Getting on the elevator they asked Jarvis to tell Steve to call them if he needed help.
He was glad Tony had someone like Steve after all the rough things he’d dealt with.  He was glad Steve had someone to take care of, someone who needed him. And he was glad that they had each other.
At this, Steve laughed while slowing down to a walk. Starting their route back to the tower, he commented.
Bucky laughed as he ran the last lap before going back to Stark Tower. Him and Steve were barely out of breath but Sam was panting heavily and drenched in sweat.
Tony gasped theatrically, " Honey Bear!!!! Don't say that! She's 25, she's old enough to make the choice for herself. If she was too young she wouldn't have eye-fucked you when you got out of War Machine. Anyways, i'm doing this. I know her number by heart, im calling her.
“ Steve?” Thor winced at Tony’s raspy voice. Probably from all the yelling. Also, because he knew Steve wasn’t there to answer Tony.
Sam raised an eyebrow, “ Panic attacks don’t mean you’re weak. It means you were strong enough to get through something.” He stared pointedly at Steve.
Tony cackled evily, hiden behing Steve he felt protected. " Sorry honey, this is for your own good. And honestly, I really think she'll say yes. I saw the way she looked at you when you interrupted that meeting last month with War Machine."
The avengers all smiled at their friendship, Rhodey stopped upon seeing Tony curled all over Steve.
Even from the hallway Thor could hear Stark’s loud screams of anguish. It shocked him to hear him sound so terrified. The screams got louder as he hurried to the master bedroom, where Jarvis already had the door open.
" Its not about that and you know it Tones. She's way to young for me and you know it. She deserves better."
All the Avengers were now curious about what they were going on about.
He brushed the brunette’s hair off his sweaty forehead and wiped the tears from his cheeks with such tenderness Thor almost looked away for fear of intruding on such a intimate moment.
“ Yea I’m pretty curious about that too. I mean, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him even remotely scared of anything.”
“ Did he just pass out?” Sam asked the room, silently panicking.
Bucky looked at his best friend, “ Why haven’t you told me that Tony gets panic attacks?”
In my story, both Bucky and Sam are Avengers and are living at Stark Tower.
Steve answered with a bit of an eye roll, “ His words, not mine. Believe me, I have tried many times to get him to ask for help. But he’s stubborn.”
“ Steve, some of those are bleeding,” he said while nodding over at Tony,” I’ll help you clean him up? If you want?”
That same Saturday night, Bucky observed Steve and Tony cuddling on the couch while the whole team watched a movie.
Steve is out on his morning jog, like always. That particular Saturday morning, he had woken up naturally at exactly 6 a.m.
Thor was heading from his bedroom, one floor below the common floor where most likely Steve was already making breakfast, to the gym. As he got into the elevator and prepared to greet Jarvis, Jarvis beat him to the punch.
“Please, please baby. Take a deep breath for me. I’m here Tony, I have you.”
Bucky could tell Stark was nude but Steve seemed to have realized that, given the way he was holding on to him, well given the way he had maneuvered the clinging Tony. Tony had both his legs wrapped around Steve’s waist, his arms were wrapped around his neck and he was digging his nails kind of aggressively into Steve’s back.
Sam noticed him laughing and shoved him.
“ Tony is a very private person. Even with me there’s still things he won’t mention. And he doesn’t like to admit weaknesses.”
“Ugh, that’s only cuz you and Tony treat any physical activity as foreplay” Sam insisted. Bucky and Steve both laughed at this.
Sam nodded in understanding, “ and the passing out? That doesn’t seem to healthy…”
“ Sleep now Mi Amor, I won’t go anywhere.”
Now, it seemed Tony was trying to hack into the phone to ask the girl on a date, seeing as Rhodey was to much of a wimp to do it himself.
Sam noticed the scratches first and frowned. It must have been a really bad nightmare for Tony to hurt himself like that, he thought.
Sam looked at Tony’s sleeping form in sympathy.
The Avengers all smiled quietly to themselves at the hi jinks between the two friends they had just witnessed and carried on with what they were doing.
" You're in on this too aren't you?!" Rhodey said accusingly at Steve.
Steve’s eyes watered, “ This one was bad…… like I said, the worst one I’ve witnessed, “ he stopped and swallowed hard, “ but sometimes him passing out is the best option. When he wakes up he’s disoriented, but calmer and easier to talk to. He has no logic when he’s like that.”
“ Its probably a good incentive for Tony to keep in shape,” Bucky added. All three laughed. Steve’s phone started ringing; it was Iron Man by Black Sabbath. Rolling his eyes at his boyfriends antics Steve muttered, “ Speak of the devil” as he answered.
Nightmare leading to panic attack.
Rhodey followed soon after, screaming, "TONY, the PHONE!! Give me the phone BACK!!!"
“ Well whatever happened must have been pretty serious to get a reaction like that out of Steve”
“How long until he awakens?” asked Thor in a sober tone.
Once Steve noticed Tony’s breathing pattern change he held him tighter. One hand on his back and the other cradling his head, Steve told Tony,
“I’m fine, you should‘ve seen the other guy,” Steve joked, a little lamely.
After Lee sprayed a little of the scent into the air, Steve took a sniff and immediately shook his head. “No, it’s…not exactly that.” It did smell like freshly mowed grass, but it didn’t smell like the green drinks Tony was always pouring from the blender.
“Don’t worry about the dance for a moment,” Rhodes said, slowing down until they were barely swaying on the spot. “I was sent out here because Tony is having a minor freak out.”
So without much further thought, Steve tentatively stuck out his index finger towards the small being.
It was wonderful to consider.
Tony said all of a sudden, his voice unusually level and calm when Tony was always so animated.
But it wasn’t enough. Fingers? They weren’t enough.
“We were too busy holding Stevie’s hand through his panic attacks over his plans to court Tony,” Bucky said. “Didn’t have time to pick up the phone and gossip, sorry.”
Tony gestured imperiously.
At that, Steve’s mouth fell open. “Tony, what are you talking about?”
Taking one look at Steve, T’Challa must have felt some pang of sympathy because he leaned in close and said, “Steve, calm down. You need to steady yourself.”
“It’s just...your everything,” Steve said. Wow, he really was continuing his trend of sounding stupid.
“I love your cock and knot so much,” Tony murmured, rubbing his slick backside against Steve’s thigh, imagining how easy it would be to just move up a few inches and sit himself down on Steve’s cock, to feel that length jerk and come the last of his orgasm into Tony.
It was clear from the onset that Tony was here to learn as much as he could. He was endlessly curious and voracious in his reading. He studied on his tablet — his own, which Steve had bought and had cost quite a lot — with as much enthusiasm as he did watching television with Steve at night, sitting in his glass on the coffee table.
“Where’s gummybear?” Tony asked, thinking idly that he wanted to check that Rhodey was safe, that everyone he loved was safe.
So they were friends again. They were friendly with each other once more.
He couldn’t bear it any longer. Clutching at the sheets beneath his grasping hands, Tony whispered, “Steve, please…”
Gently, Steve cupped a hand against Tony’s curved back, where he was curling up into a ball of miserable merman. He laid a thumb on Tony’s shoulder and patted him very, very softly. “Tony, Tony, wake up. Tony, you’re safe.” He kept up the soothing words until those small dark lashes fluttered. Then Tony blinked up blearily at Steve.
“The essence of the Avengers,” Steve commented, matching his smile.
“It wasn’t even a trick,” Tony said, not really wanting to continue harping on about the subject but was giving this whole open communication shtick a tentative shake. He didn’t want this to weigh on Steve at all, not one bit. “We were both under the influence of hormones and pheromones, talking to other people and watching each other. If we were a little jealous, then that just makes us painfully regular human beings.”
Steve frowned. “Scentears?”
“Alright, fine, an Omega can tell when he’s not wanted,” Tony said with a smile, trying to look flippant.
“I know I won’t like it,” Steve said stubbornly. Then rallied in a flare of annoyance. “What happened to everything you said during the dance? And on the stage?”
Tony moaned when he finally,
Tony tugged Steve to the recessed living area and towards a couch, saying, “Hey, F.R.I.D.A.Y., mute all incoming calls please unless it’s a Godzilla level emergency.” He shot Steve a wry look. “Happy is going to be blowing up my phone with complaints that I just bailed out of my own Courting Ceremony and left him to get rid of the guests.”
That seemed to offend Tony. He huffed, “Because I can’t guarantee the standards of someone else’s Courting Ceremony. What if they served fake crab meat and played Bieber all night? What kind of first experience would that be for you?”
“That reminds me,” Tony said brightly, wriggling away from Steve a little so he could pull out a little box from his jeans’ pocket. He held it on his palm in front of Steve and offered it up. “A gift.”
“Hey, why am I hearing about Steve joining this courtship madness from the press instead of from any one of you assholes?”
“Oh... So why are you dancing with me?” Steve asked, a little confused.
“You’re right, I could,” Steve said, cupping his hand a little so Tony could feel him more completely. “And right now? I want to see you take off your clothes, or maybe I’ll take them off for you.”
with my boyfriendㅡ”
He leaned in and Steve tilted his face up for a kiss on the cheek, both angling their heads automatically so that Steve wouldn’t be smacked by the faceplate. They had learned through trial and error on this. Steve smiled as he felt soft lips and facial hair against his cheek, remembering a time when a much smaller, feather light kiss had been bestowed on his cheek. How things had changed. His life had been a whirlwind ever since Tony arrived and he didn’t think it was going to change any time soon.
He reaches over the counter to grab the phone, but there’s no dial tone.
And he did, very thoroughly.
Steve pressed a kiss to his skin and murmured, “You don’t like the job I’m doing?” Then he licked. With a pointed tongue, he licked right in.
He shouldn’t have been surprised. He was old. So much older than
The man shrieked and Tony took the opportunity to elbow him in the ribs while ducking out of his hold. Amber was still clamped so hard around the man’s hand that he couldn’t even let go of the knife. The man instinctively tried to swing at the dragon.
“Yes,” Tony said in little more than a sigh.
Natasha made a face and explained, “The two of them kept bickering so I think the alien sorcerer was offended that they weren’t taking him seriously enough.”
“He once called Iron Man a multimillion dollar robot fetish come to life,” Tony responded, eyes bright with amusement and smugness.
“Because...it’s the smell of burnt marshmallow. You smell like
“Mine, this is mine,” Tony growled, bending down to suck the head of Steve’s cock into his mouth, flicking his tongue against the slit until Steve arched, until his feet drummed against the floor. Tony pulled back with satisfaction, looked at Steve’s open-mouthed pleasure. “Mine. Not Kevin’s. I’m not sharing.”
Tony was
Steve brought the bag closer to his face and decided in an impulsive headlong dive into honesty that he had to ensure Tony knew how important he was to Steve. He said quietly, “Tony, I just wanted you to know that I’m glad to have you in my life. I was worried that you weren’t coming back.”
“But in all, you could say I’m new around here.” he reached for his lost arm, as if it was still there, before letting his hand fall.
“That I am. But call me Tony, since we’ll be seeing each other a lot.” he walked up to him already measuring the shoulder and thinking of what he was going to do. “Never saw you around Valhöll, are you’re a newbie like Rocky?”
There was a long silence that stretched for minutes. Tony looked around him, no one was laughing. Barnes seemed confused, Steve was still frowning and Fury just nodded at the mechanic when his turn came.
He turned his sight back to his plate. Before he could mourn the absence of food, a little plate of mini doughnuts nudged against his arm. He tried to look nonchalant as he pick one up.
“How about both? Life if New York isn’t a cheap agent.
“My bad Rocky.
.” snapped Tony. How many times did he hear those words: stay with us, don’t bother building a life outside those walls. There are other monsters, humans while never understand. It’s us against the world. Fury has lost the touch with humans but that was the problem. There were still humans at the core. You couldn’t just lock your pairs away and hope they’ll forget.
“We will pay you, spend as many months as you want, just make it your priority.
The fairest frowned, his grip slipping a little.
"Where's your doggy-pal? I didn't think I would ever see you without him.
The large blond nodded at this and leaned on the wooden bar, his long hair sliding off his shoulders and onto his resting arms.
It has been said that Fairest had the biggest struggles with going back to normal life. The Fae were abusers and probably jammed lies upon lies in the changelings’ heads to keep them by their side. Hell, Tony could relate: his own tormentor would shower him with affectionate words, telling him how beautiful and how perfect he was making him.
The world tipped backwards and Tony felt the ground slam against his back. The pain shot through him and he let out a yelp of surprise/pain. His workshop rumbled then roared to life as he cursed and squirmed under the large mass. He was not having this!
Hope you enjoyed it! If you find anything confusing don't hesitate to tell me! Fells like I'm dumping too much info in each chapter xD
“Don’t you
“Okay. So werewolves are a thing. Anything else I need to be warned about.
Tony offered him a stolen smile, the ones he used against paparazzi when he was younger, and offered a vague answer.
“Ugh. More secrets, why am I not surprised. Let me then ask you what’s in it for me? You’re asking me to build something that’ll have to be intertwined with wyrd so that it would go from arm to wolf leg. I’m good, true, don’t think any of your paws could realize such a feat. but this is going to take so much time. I’m going to have to do tests, reruns, crash tests, you can afford me for that.
“Fellow Tony! How good to see you, my friend!”
The changeling's hope and loss.
Tony’s eyebrows rose at that. Okay, that was a hard one. Not impossible but that was going to be hell to find the right spells, enchantments and material to realise such a feat. No wonders Agent insisted and nagged him with this, you couldn’t leave this in the hands of anybody.
A quick hand snapped over Tony’s wrist and held him tight. Cold blue eyes suddenly opened and fixed their glare into Tony’s brown’s ones. He screamed in surprise and tried to shake his hand off, his fight or flight response clearly setting for
