Tony doesn’t blame himself for his actions. He just found out that Steve’s best friend murdered his parents. He was angry… he had the right to be angry. But sometimes he wondered what would have happened if he had stopped. If he had actually listened to and processed Steve’s words. If Tony went back in time, he doesn’t know if he would have acted any differently. He doesn’t think that he would have ever been able to subdue his anger long enough to listen to Steve, to listen to his pleading boyfriend.
When they walked into a private room their eyes were immediately drawn to the sleeping boy, wrapped in several blankets, being held by a middle-aged woman on the other side of the room.
All Tony wanted to do was stay in bed and watch movies all day and eat junk food. He needed a mental day after everything that happened. And he meant to furrow back in his covers when his peripheral vision picked up a figure sitting against the headboard beside him.
He slowly opened the door, careful to avoid any creak the hinges could create. He slowly shut the door and sauntered over towards the crib in front of him. He bent down on both knees so he was eye level with his sleeping son. Peter looked so peaceful while slept. His little brown curls stuck to his forehead. Tony watched the peaceful rhythm of Peter’s chest rise and fall. After a few minutes, Tony heard the door behind him slowly open and close and soon felt Steve’s huge arms wrap around him.
“Thank you,” He said to Nebula as Tony saw his first glance of Earth. From space, everything looked peaceful. “I never thought I’d see it again.” When they first entered Earth’s atmosphere, Tony turned on his Iron Man helmet. Soon it started blinking red, indicating that the voice recording he made for Steve, sent to the Avengers Compound.
After that, he got angry, really angry. He started yelling and screaming as waves of anger washed through his body. He began to grab everything he saw and threw them across the room. Steves bedding, his books, his television, his lamp, his journals, his clock. Tony threw random little nick nacks he found and chucked them as hard as he could. Tony’s hands were bleeding by the end of it. The last thing he picked up was a picture frame from Steve’s nightstand. The photo was of Steve and him, they took it during their first vacation together.
When Christine Everheart posted a picture on Twitter, of Tony Stark standing outside of a Starbucks, holding a large coffee, people’s first thought was ‘He’s back’. But in the second picture, when she zoomed in on his left hand, even though it was very blurry, everyone saw what was resting around his finger.
“Eh, some guy I’m guessing thirty? Thirty-two? Probably low in ranks trying to off the Captain as a way to get his superiors to learn his name.” The sandy-haired man said, scratching his brow, smearing the blood already on his face.
The final picture was taken after the Avengers had a mission in Tuscany. A Doombot had blasted Steve off of a building and he crashed onto the hood of a car. For a whole minute, Steve remained unresponsive. It was the first time the Avengers feared that Captain America was going to die. When Steve finally came to, with some assistance from Hawkeye, he was able to get off the car and stand up. At least he was until his back was ruffly shoved against the car and Tony had kissed him. “Don’t ever do that again.” Tony had whispered against his lips. “You can’t leave me, Rogers.” It was their first kiss. Luckily, Nat had her phone out and was able to capture the moment.
After looking for another half an hour, they grabbed a couple more outfits, paid, and finally decided to take a lunch break.
“When I drift off, I will think about you.” He hasn’t spoken to Steve in two years. After everything that went down in Siberia, he knew that if he reached out to Steve, then he would fall back into his arms without a second thought. He knew that he would do anything for Steve, and Steve would do anything for him. But wasn’t that the problem? Steve broke his heart. But every time his heart gets pieced back together, it seems to beat for Steve. For years he tried his best to not think about him. But now, floating in space until he dies in a matter of hours, he doesn’t want to think about anything else.
When they got off the elevator, they noticed that all the lights were off and it was dark except for the faint glow which was cast from the television.
When Tony finally opened his eyes he saw Nebula bending over him. “What- what happened?” His voice sounded scratchy and rough, his words were barely louder than a whisper. Soon he wasn’t going to be able to say any words. It was getting harder and harder to breathe. And then he was going to fall unconscious, most likely an hour or two before the oxygen was completely gone.
A few hours later Mrs. Leeds came to pick up Ned and Peter hugged him for a full minute before he had to leave. Once the door officially closed and Ned was gone, Steve smiled and turned towards his husband.
Tony took to Instagram and posted a series of photos including Steve’s hand adorning his engagement ring, another was of the two of them feeding each other wedding cake. The third picture was of the two of them on a boat in Greece, the one after that was the two of them eating gelato in Rome. The last picture was a selfie Tony took months ago. Steve, not knowing that the picture was being taken, was standing with his back facing the camera. The only thing he was wearing was a pair of white boxers with the words ‘Property of Tony Stark’ printed over his ass, in red. Tony’s pointer finger rested against his lips in a ‘shhh’ fashion.
Walking a little further, he brushed his fingers against what looked like dried blood, splattered across the wall. What a lovely establishment...
The door behind him creaked open and Tony turned his head to the side to see The Captain walk into the room, holding the book in his large, calloused hands. “Sorry about that.” He said, pulling a knife out of thin air and bending down to cut the zip ties. “Everyone was just being extra cautious.”
He waited a moment before Tony finally sighed and shifted in Steve’s arms and turned to look at him. “Well, what was I supposed to say? We got drunk, fucked, and then I basically went and ducked for cover every time I saw you for the next week?” Steve chuckled. “Oh, shut up. I was terrified that you hated me and then whenever you tried to talk to me you were going to say that you regret it and that we can’t be friends anymore. Okay? I couldn’t take that kind of rejection.”
By the time Tony had finished the article, he was about to hand it back to Natasha when he noticed that Steve was reading it over his shoulder. When Steve finished, he slumped against the back of his chair and bit into a bright red apple. The crisp sound it made as Steve bit into it pierced the air. Tony stared at the way his jaw moved back and forth as he chewed the fruit, the bob of his Adam's apple as he swallowed. When he bit into it again, a small amount of juice trickled down, towards his bottom lip, only to be stopped as the tip of Steve’s wet, pink tongue reached out the stop it.
“And what? You’re saying that you’ve never killed anyone?” The brunette scoffed, “Yeah, I thought so.” Tony didn’t understand what all the fuss is about. These gang members are responsible for countless deaths, the dozen dead bodies surrounding him only prove his point.
As Tony reached the bathroom and entered a stall before locking it behind him, he worked on unlocking the phone. He hooked JARVIS up wirelessly to his own phone and within 28 seconds he was in.
Tony watched as the man across the room, hidden within the shadows, nearly invisible to the naked eye, went down like a dead weight. The blonde man before him, whose back faced the hidden man from the shadows, wiped his head towards Tony.
Tony was about to protest, but a heavy object smashed into the back of his head and his vision went dark.
Steve’s, two-year-old, black wingtip shoes clapped against the pavement while he and Tony walked in the direction of the tower.
looked terrified, which made sense, he did just divulge his largest secret to Tony. “Steve,” he said, testing the word out on his lips.
Bruce waited until Peter was done with his bottle, and then he lightly tapped Peter four times on his back before he threw up the bottle he just drank. Sam rushed to get paper towels and Bucky went into Peter’s room to grab a clean pair of pajama’s. When he came back, he held a Hulk themed onesie in his hands. The bottom half was purple and the top half was green, with the word ‘SMASH’ boldly printed.
While people hoped he was, they knew that even with there incessant asking, they weren’t going to get answers any time soon. Or at least... not for another two months.
Within the next hour, dozens of papers and online journals had published articles about Tony having a nervous breakdown and destroying someone's personal property. This wasn’t the first time that the press had written about Tony Stark freaking out in public, or destroying someone’s property. But it didn’t matter. Tony couldn’t keep his feelings to himself anymore. What he said, had to be said.
“Okay, hun, we’ll see you soon. Say goodbye to Daddy,” Steve said to Peter. Peter just continued laughing as Steve hung up the phone.
When Tony sat down on his bed, he looked at the photo closely and knew that if he had the opportunity to go back in time and tell his past self all that has happened, to tell himself about all the pain that Steve caused him, he would still do everything the same exact way. Tony realized, that even though he lost Steve, he hasn’t lost his memories of him. And Tony has much more good, loving memories about Steve than bad ones.
It first started gaining media attention when Karen Page wrote an article under the New York Bulletin’s gossip column, claiming that it has been months since Tony Stark was last seen drunk out of his mind, partying all hours of the night, and parading around with some equally as drunk, beautiful girl, wearing barely any clothing.
“Thanos raised me. He always talked about a planet which has the most beautiful sunset he’d ever seen. I’m going to start there.”
Tony smiled as he looked at the picture. It amazed him that, after only meeting Peter twenty minutes earlier, his heart was already filled with so much love. He looked at Steve’s smile in the photo and he felt like he was falling in love with him all over again.
As Tony walked back, Cap saw him and excused himself from Hammers side; but Tony didn't pretend to ignore the way his dark pupils flashed as they saw Tony.
On his way across the parking lot, towards the school, Steve watched as his son ran out of the building with his friend, and then he watched as Peter's teacher ran out of the building after them, calling their names.
Tony felt his phone buzz and saw that Pepper sent him a picture. When he clicked on the attachment, he felt his heart squeeze in his chest. The photo showed the picture of Peter with his birth parents and the picture of Peter with Tony and Steve in separate frames, hanging up side-by-side in Peter’s room. Tony showed the photo to Steve and the smile already resting on his face, grew twice as large.
Tony hummed, resting his back against his husbands chest, relishing in the warmth radiating off his body.
After Peter had finished his bottle and Steve burped him, the elevator door pinged open, revealing Bucky and Sam each carrying a handful of messily wrapped presents.
“I feel so betrayed right now,” she lightly jabbed her foot into his hip, “And why is everyone attacking me? Is no one going to talk about how Rhod-”
So he forced himself to quietly tiptoe around Caps bedroom for a piece of paper and I pen. In a scribbled, hardly legible note, Tony wrote,
Wait a second, how the hell does Rogers know about a Spanish quiz? Tony asks, “How the hell do you know that?”
“Iron Man was valiant and brave today, as he always is. I should like that to go into our team records,” Thor declared. He tucked a strand of hair behind his ear.
“Minutes or hours?” Steve asked, dryly. That was a fair question.  Probably hours, but he didn’t really want to tell him that. Steve was always trying to get him to eat regularly, work less. Besides, he didn’t want Steve to figure out just how much of a pushover he was, how much he wanted to give Steve everything he wanted.  Couldn’t give himself away.
"I’ve been a little busy, you know, getting blown up.  Fighting the actual wars.  Not hiding behind lawyers, like a criminal,” the man sneered.
Shit.  This could not be happening.  Too many pieces were falling into place. Steve couldn’t breathe, his lungs burning for oxygen. Shit shit shit. That date, just about a year ago.  Halfway between Jalalabad and Peshawar.  Those were indelibly carved into Steve, the source of his guilt, the way he’d earned his discharge. Earned on the backs of his troops, at the cost of Bucky’s arm.  Not a retrieval unit. A rescue unit.  His unit.  Whoever it was had made a deal to sell Tony’s weapons to a warlord in Afghanistan to take out Steve’s ducklings.
“Sir created prototypes of me when he was quite young.  In fact, he made the original designs when he was in his early twenties, just after his family died.”
She downloaded another chunk of messages. They were largely congratulatory.  Iron Monger was pleased to see that everything had gone as planned. No rescue group left in the area.  They’d all been flown out.  Time for phase two. Raza, according to Natasha, had said he was ready for the next target and the big guns.  A deal was a deal, he insisted.
Natasha nodded, looking at over at Steve while she pulled Bucky’s hair back into a hairband.  “Of course he is. We saw the way he was looking at you. Besides, who doesn’t want you?”
Tony snorted, unconvinced. He was pretty sure he’d been had, duped by the man-with-the-plan walking up the stairs in front of him.  Still, at least he had a good view.
He felt Steve’s eyes on him, but he couldn’t bring himself to look back.  After all, Steve knew, and Steve had had to play defense for him. That was how weak he was. Couldn’t stand on his own.
Tony looked up at him, that quiet look on his face. It was so different than his usual urgency, but it looked… it looked right on him. Comfortable.
“Tony, I know who you are.  You wouldn’t want me, if you knew who I am. There’s no way you would want me. I’m sorry. I really hate to disappoint you.  Especially you.”
Tony’s blood seethed, hot.  Stern would never touch Steve.  Tony wanted Steve miles away from here, from this man, this grasping, vile john.
Bucky returned carrying his shirt and plopped into his chair. “Hey man, I only speak the truth. I saw the interview—he’d be half wanting to rip the wet shirt off you with his teeth and the other half trying to make sure I didn’t give you another cold.”
Tony shoved him. It didn’t even phase the bastard, he just laughed and made his way to the quinjet, picking up Tony’s broken left shin guard on the way. Tony followed so he could ogle that perfect backside, handing the sample to a SHIELD lackey.
The lunch table rolled their eyes, undisturbed by the routine interruption.  “Nat, what are you going to be for Halloween?” Sam asked, side-eying hard.
Pepper just sighed again, not quite rolling her eyes. “It really isn’t,” she told Peggy. “Everyone write your name on an index card, fold it—once,” she looked hard at Tony again, “and toss it in the hat.”
is really about systemic racial bias rather than about jealousy for the relationship. Or the way that
Tony knew it was his fault. A failing of his crippled heart. A payment that would come due, soon enough. A few months, he had, maybe more, maybe a little less.  Every time he looked at the reactor, it had lost a little more light, dark lines stretched wider across his chest. He took another look in the mirror, seeing the bags under his eyes and the unruly mess of hair.  The arc reactor still glowed. But soon.  Soon enough.  He sighed.
Well.  He could show his gratitude by finishing the job he’d been meant to do in the first place.  Once he’d figured out what part of SI had gone bad, he could bring the news to Tony with an apology. Satisfied he had a plan, Steve popped in a pair of earbuds and started playing the video he downloaded earlier.  The video was recorded showing the face of the guy going by Raza, but the quality was terrible.  Bad enough that translation services couldn’t automatically transcript it.  Steve could handle Farsi, but his Tajik, which he was pretty sure this was, wasn’t as fluent. They were close enough that he could get part of it, but was going to need Google to sort out some of the unfamiliar vocabulary. He got that there was a transaction for a hit of some sort on an exceptional military unit.  Not as unusual as it should be in a country with high levels of poverty and instability.  Warlords always found a way to profit.
He got an email as they piled out of his car, and he sent the others on ahead of him.  “I’ll catch up,” he told Pepper, as she gave him a curious look.  He opened his screen.
Right. Whatever Stern wanted, he couldn’t have it. Not from Steve. The thought of the man touching Steve made him sick.
She smiled a little.  “He is sort of the worst. But I’m not looking to start dating someone.  I have a boyfriend.”
Yes.  It hit a chord somewhere in Steve.  Yes.  Before he’d put the plane in the ice.  Before that.  The world had frozen before that.  And no one else seemed to realize.
“Yeah, we’ve got Mr. Phillips’ history class and Dr. Selvig’s AP physics together. You were in Selvig’s at the beginning of the year, right?”
It was just like Tony to make sure Bucky’s number was programmed in; he should have known.  Tony was always looking out for other people. When he’d heard Happy’s sister had been in an accident, he’d put Happy on his own private jet and sent him to see her in California immediately.  She was in the hospital, but stable.  Just the other day, Steve had come back from picking up Tony’s tux from the drycleaners and happened to mention in passing how they’d had a broken window from some drunken party goer the night before.  An hour later, he fielded a call from Mr. Kim, thanking Mr. Stark for the new window. He was demanding, sure, but meticulously thoughtful.
“I was just, you know, collecting my phone from Coulson. Turns out our phones look a lot alike.  You’d never know the difference.”
Tony’s stomach whirled dramatically as his mind raced, but Coulson had already moved on to the next table.  “Justin, hand it over.  No phones at lunch; you know the rules.”
He plunked down on the edge of the bed.  His phone was still off.  He scrubbed a hand through his hair, frustrated.  He refreshed his memory in a rote gesture, habit. Nothing.
Steve couldn’t settle.  He didn’t know what to do.  Eventually he went into his room and grabbed a sketchbook, his favorite. The pages were thick and smooth. They calmed him.  He started with sketches from tonight.  The way that Pepper had looked, radiant, beaming with competence and success.  Tony standing with Maya Hansen, her hand on his suit, perfect elegance in the couple.  The startled look on Stane’s face when Steve took the glass of scotch. He started filling in the lines of Stane’s face, recalling the expression of surprise. No, not just surprise.  That was… That was the look of disappointed scheming.  He knew that look from long months in the desert.  Hidden better than most, maybe, but that look covered conniving deceit. He knew.  Stane knew that Tony was an alcoholic trying to be sober.  He knew exactly what he was doing with that glass.  That asshole.  And Tony trusted him. What kind of game was he playing? He ripped out the page, scribbling a note on the back.  Maybe he could get it to Tony anyway.  Somehow.
“I was right outside.” Tony kissed him again, quickly, a line of tiny kisses across his face. “I get worried about you when you switch off the comm,” he admitted. “I heard from when she called you wise. She could see me, the whole time.  There’s no dream, Steve. There’s no spell. It’s just me.”
“I sent Barton home. The farm house isn’t documented.  Sam’s having the time of his life ziplining around Wakanda like a maniac.”
No, that he already knew. But he wasn’t like other people either, happy in a crowd, milling aimlessly, talking with everyone. He already had his heart set, he was already losing in a game that Tony literally had no idea existed, let alone that he was winning.  Pure misery shot through his body for a moment, rooting him to the floor.
Tony.  It had to be.  No one else that Steve knew had that kind of power.  And Tony had been able to get him to back off once before.  It had to be.  He was still doing favors for him, even after Steve… He blushed, uncomfortable with himself.
Steve ran it over in his mind a few times.  Is that what Tony had meant?  Maybe Natasha was right.  He’d asked if he could come in, after his apology.  Steve hadn’t made anything of it at the time, but it fit Nat’s theory.  Or was that his stupid heart again, full of hope and optimism and running away from his brain? But his heart hadn’t imagined Tony’s fingertips on Steve’s face.
“I’m sorry I lost my temper, Rogers.” Rumlow kept the sneer just below his voice, too low to be called out.  “This is a difficult time of the year.  I’m sorry I broke your painting.” He turned to Selvig.  “Done?”
Tony kept pulling Steve forward until he could kiss him, ignoring the way his legs bent up past where he was comfortable.  Then he pushed him back a little, commanding, “Move.”
Tony was inwardly delighted.  Pepper was handling Johansson with grace, getting him fully on board with the new project. Tony thought he might have met a new collaborator—collaborators, actually—a pair of sweet, enthusiastic British kids.  They might be able to come up with a replacement for the palladium that even Tony hadn’t yet.  Maybe. He wasn’t going to bet on it or anything, but the chance was there.  And Steve.  Steve had been at his side all night, distractingly and devastatingly handsome.  More than that, Steve had been watching his back, taking care of him.  He’d somehow managed to intercept every drink someone brought Tony, swapping them unobtrusively for a more innocuous imposter. He’d managed to divert Christine Everhart to an “inside scoop” with Maya Hansen, playing just dumb enough to make her lose interest in him. There was that Brooklyn kid, again. Tony was glowing internally, basking in the protective warmth of Steve’s focus and concern. He could feel Steve’s eyes on him like a caress.
In the mornings, Steve tended just to throw on sweats and a t-shirt he’d clearly bought for someone half his size.  Or someone had misinformed him regarding how t-shirts were supposed to fit, and when Tony found that person he was going to buy them a Bentley. Walking in on Steve last night had been difficult for Tony, trying to decide whether the invasion of privacy was worth the comfort, or vice versa.  Eventually, he’d figured he’d do more good than harm.  He hadn’t been prepared for Steve in all his shirtless glory.  It wasn’t appropriate to ogle at the time, but Tony couldn’t help but notice the ridges defining Steve’s stomach, the smooth plush of his chest. This morning, as Steve walked away, cotton softly clinging to his perfect form, Tony gave up trying to fight it.  He had few enough mornings left, and as long as his equipment still functioned, he was going to use it. Steve wouldn’t mind. Or, he wouldn’t know, anyway. Same difference. He felt a slight pang of guilt, but brushed it aside.
“Alright, ladies and gentlemen, let’s not make this more awkward than it is.  Steve doesn’t want a big do, you know how he is,” Peggy warned them all as Sam walked over.  “No jailbird jokes, no asking him annoying questions.  Of course he hasn’t been charged, it was just Hammer’s legal team putting pressure on the DA. Hammer and Hodge, on the other hand, will be looking at some jail time if I have anything to say about it.”
“I’m afraid I’ve had a momentary glitch in my system, Captain, and I seem to have erased all the footage of the house from the last few seconds. I do so apologize for the inconvenience, but I seem not to have gotten a recording of when Mr. Stane walked into that door,” Jarvis replied smoothly.
“Sometimes I feel like I’m flying and the wind is turbulent, I’m hitting little pockets of air. Sometimes I’m on top of the world, I have everything. And sometimes I feel like my stomach is falling out from under me, because I have everything, but I’m also hiding a secret: I’m gay. –Flying.”
Steve bit the inside of his cheek hard enough to draw blood, withdrawing his hand.  “No.  You’re still clean.”
“Do not be wroth with Lady Sif,” Thor counseled Tony.  “It was not her doing. She is only here to retrieve him.”
It pinged at just after 3am.  Tony scrambled up, immediately, knocking his powered-off phone onto the floor next to his history textbook.  An email from Flying. Tony’s hands were shaking, he was almost crying, even though he wasn’t sure what it said yet.  But he cared, somehow he cared.  He opened the message.
“The one thing Howard got right, and it was this,” Tony said, derision clear in his voice.  “Muscles. And I thought today was going to be a good day. I got a full night’s sleep, I ate breakfast.  And then this piece of sheer idiocy. It’s a goddamn monument.” His tone turned more deeply bitter.  “What the hell am I supposed to do with this? Of all the things.  Why did it have to be you?”
“What, ‘fine?’” Tony asks, bitterly, his voice ratcheting up, spitting the words out. “Is this what fine is? It doesn’t feel like it to me.”
Everything Steve said today sounded like innuendo, and unfortunately, Tony couldn’t seem to keep his reactions in check.  He’d wanted Steve for months now, since they’d figured out after the Chitauri that they worked amazingly well together.  He’d realized that Steve wasn’t really a sanctimonious asshole, and Steve saw through his I’m-a-Stark cover. Somehow that stellar teamwork had turned their relationship upside down once he got to know the guy. Instead of Tony disobeying orders because he thought Steve was an idiot, he’d push back snippily because the other option was to come in his pants at Steve’s command voice.  And the suit wasn’t designed to handle that kind of cleanup on the regular. Now Steve was offering to let Tony pet the tiny kitten nestled between the powerful thighs of his very large lap.  As if that wasn’t where Tony himself wanted to be.  When he’d heard Steve picking up the kitten earlier, he’d had a brief moment where he thought Steve was referring to Tony as “baby” and he’d liked it.  Christ, he’d really liked it.  So much so that he’d forgotten that the door to the closet was still closed.  That was probably some sort of giant analogy for his life, but he was going to avoid analyzing that for the moment.
Tony barked out a laugh. “Yes, I’m sure you are.  And I bet Batroc bought that, hook line and sinker.
“Did your father never tell you how many times I tried to enlist? As an asthmatic who weighed ninety pounds?” Steve’s voice is extremely dry.
“Definitely not for us.” Steve was smiling at him.  Tentatively maybe, but there. He brought his hand up to Tony’s face.
Tony took him to the VA, as he sometimes did.  But this time he pulled Steve in by the collar, kissed him, and said he’d be back to pick him up for lunch, that they could get a blueplate special somewhere if he showed his AARP card. Then he’d pulled him back for one more quick, casual kiss at the corner of his mouth, his eyes scrunching in the corners still. Steve knew he was smiling through the whole meeting, but his veterans didn’t seem to mind. One of them commented that it was good to see him happy, genuinely happy.  She said she couldn’t remember the last time he’d smiled like that. And Tony let Steve pick up the check for lunch, kissing him thank you.
Steve gave up. “Tony,” he cut in, “I’m not homophobic. This isn’t about this morning.” It wasn’t, really, he excused himself in his mind.  He’d been in love with Tony for far longer than this morning. “I just need some time. For myself. To um, do me.” That’s what Sam had called it, right?
“But I will carry the provender back to the tower for you, Tony, in my well-muscled arms,” Thor countered, flexing.
Tony wondered what else she was keeping stored on her.  He decided not to ask. Discretion being the better part of valor and all that.
The door opened.  They hadn’t heard footsteps, so it was definitely Natasha.  She was the only one tiny enough that the steps didn’t creak. Both men turned to look at her.  She briefly glanced at Steve, an implicit smile, and turned that gaze on Bucky, a fierce, intent light in her eyes.  She didn’t say hello, just walked by them into the bedroom, leaving them to look at each other in confusion. She emerged a second later, walked over to them, stood directly in front of Bucky, and put her left hand down on the table. It clinked.
Steve opened a browser window, searching for a grief counseling group.  Survivor’s guilt, the therapist had said. Steve entered it into the search bar. Fury was at least right in that it was a little better to see what other people had to say, hidden here, behind his computer. Of course, Fury would never let him go to an actual meeting.  SHIELD didn’t want their newest melted mascot to be out in public, talking to everyone.  Not when they couldn’t control it.  Even his hander, Coulson, seemed to be playing things close to the vest, but then he seemed like a devoted acolyte of Fury’s.  So this was the solution.  An online grief counseling group.  Message boards, they said.  Group chats, they said. Maybe a VA meeting in a few months. Maybe.  Coulson seemed to be pushing for it, or Steve thought so, anyway.  But Fury and Hill didn’t seem to feel the same.
Tony hit send, locked his phone, and unlocked his door.  Jarvis brought him supper. Tony played around with his microcircuits. What did this guy sound like? Did he have a deep voice? Or maybe a lighter tone? What did he look like? Shield High was pretty racially diverse.  Someone with family drama. Was he from a more conservative culture? Did they have to struggle to make it? An immigrant family? A senior. Maybe he was tall.  Maybe he was gorgeous and built ala Steve Rogers.  On the other hand, maybe he was a little weird, like that exchange student Stephen Strange.  Maybe he wasn’t white.  Maybe he was from a South Asian background. Was he Latino? Bronzed skin and darker hair than Tony’s? Tony tried to picture him, tried out different intonations, reading and re-reading the emails.  His phone stayed silent all night.
Steve sat back.  He’d never posted before. He’d never contributed to the conversation. It felt like a risk.  It felt like overexposure.  Giving away his hand, somehow.  But it also felt right, passing on Peggy’s advice. As if it had never really been his, never really been for him, as if he’d been given it to hold onto, for a while, a transient snippet from an older world, until he could deliver it to this new recipient.  He watched the rest of the conversation.  Mel and Wilson stepping in, providing guidance.  JustaShell didn’t say anything more, and the group moved on.  Eventually, the conversation stopped.  When Steve closed the window, his eyes were heavy.  He’d finish the file tomorrow.
Steve knew what he wanted.  Knew it pure, like a flame.  “I don’t know if we can ever know the consequences, fully, ma’am,” he said.
Bucky opened an eye and looked over at him with mock irritation.  With a final kiss, he pulled Natasha up and into his lap. “Yes,” he said, looking at her. “That was definitely a yes.”
They sat that way for most of the ride home.  It was silent, thankfully. The party had been bright and loud, cacophonous.  Tony watched Steve’s hands on his, moving over the soft skin of his wrist absently, calming him. He wondered if it was something he’d picked up being sick, or where the habit had come from.  He thought about the way that Steve had run interference for him.  He thought about the way that Steve was kind and good, how his eyes saw more, how his mind missed nothing, how his heart felt more keenly.  He thought about his loyalty, his dedication, his nightmares.  He thought about how he seemed to give everything and hesitate to assume he was welcome. He thought about that bright smirk, the playfulness he sometimes let Tony see. He thought about the remaining days he was fairly sure the arc reactor would still allow him.
Batroc held up a finger, telling Steve he’d be back in a minute.  Steve could still hear a one-sided conversation, voice low but, of course, Batroc also had nothing to hide from him. He scanned what he could see of the office in front of him.  The mobile phone on the desk, a second on a shelf behind him next to a photo of Batroc on a beautiful yacht off the coast of Monaco.
Natasha touched his shoulder lightly. “Don’t do that to yourself, Tony. I know you wouldn’t have.  And besides, I can take care of myself.” He looked up at her.  She looked thoughtful. Calculating. “Okay.  So, we have to make sure I’m flirty, just a little, slow.  Play it like an ice queen opening up, so he’s never frustrated and always thinks he’s making progress.”
Steve went to the VA in the late morning, dropping by Sam’s meeting to talk with some of his veterans.  He tried to do that on Thursdays.  Sam said it helped, although Steve thought maybe Sam was saying it helped Steve.  And he thought, maybe, it did.  Not only because he felt useful, relevant, helpful to Sam and his veterans, but also because it reminded him that he wasn’t alone.  That other people felt like he did, had the same loss, the same guilt, even if his specific case was a little more extreme.
But when he’d blown off Stern and found Dr. Selvig, telling him he’d email his old MIT research notes on the Kuiper cliff, Steve was back, as if he’d never been gone.
“I don’t think that’s what you saw, Bucky.  He was just tired that day. He’d had a long night and she was being very rude, she doesn’t understand that he’s a really good person, that he tries so hard to make everyone’s lives better. And I just…”
The man on the floor started twitching, finally. Pepper poked him with her shoe again.  “Miss Romanoff, he’s sort of jerking around a little.  Does it hurt?”
So it was going to be one of those days.  “Come in. Do you want some coffee?” He set the percolator to brew.
But it was fine, really, he liked talking to Flying through email. They were still the best part of his day.  And, yes, if he was honest, he felt this connection deeply.  To his bones.  It was almost as if he was able to get to know Flying so well
Right.  He had other things he needed to do.  Like make sure Thor was still breathing.  Steve checked the Asgardian, made sure he was still alive.  He was snoring, actually, so Steve wasn’t too worried.  The goat wandered over and started nibbling on his shirt.  Steve considered shooing the animal away, but then Thor had brought the goat to sacrifice for dinner, so it seemed only fair to let her get a meal in, too.  He let her be.
It was a risk. It was a huge risk.  He knew the math. With a deep breath, he took a long look at Steve, lingering on his lips, gave him a thorough once-over.
And the worst part was, he did want a reason to call, excuse or otherwise.  Tony had said he was free to go, but apparently, in truth, he wasn’t free.  He didn’t want to go.  He’d told himself it was an infatuation.  Tony was smart and sexy.  Easy to develop a crush on someone like that.  But it was more than his charm.  It was the way he cared about everything.  The way he stayed up too late trying to get projects done, because he knew that he could fix it, and if he could fix it, men and women would be safer on the field. It was the way he seemed to singlehandedly help a world that continually tried to tear him down, that didn’t deserve him.
Wanda broke out in a little smile. She didn’t smile all that often, really.  “Sure, Tony.  And thanks. Can we bring anything?”
Tony turned off his other screens. Fury rose from his desk, imposing, the vengeful dour face of puissance and intimidation.  He walked around the desk, clearly trying to get Steve to back down, the leather coat swirling around his boots.
“So, um, where’d you get this little guy?” Steve asked, as Tony ate his biryani.  He sort of liked that Tony was eating food he brought.  Sure, he hadn’t made it himself, but the caveman who seemed to lurk in his brain was immensely pleased that he’d in some way helped provide for Tony.
“Tony?” he asked loudly, wanting to give full warning.  If he was wrong, if there was an eager partner in there, he wanted to be stopped before he saw anything. He didn’t think he could forget the sight of a wet, aroused Tony.
Tony leered at him, giving him a very obvious once-over.  “It’d certainly show off your assets,” he threw back, winking.  “But I don’t know if America’s ready for that much of a show, Spangles.”
Bucky couldn’t help; he’d barely picked up slang overseas.  Languages, he said, were just not his thing.  But Natasha, when she got home.  She spoke more languages than Steve did.  Everything her unit might have come in contact with on assignment, from Russian to some elementary Hindi. So Steve could wait.  Verify.  Nat should be home soon anyway.  It had been hours since she started back.  And it wasn’t like this issue was time sensitive—he’d been working on it for weeks.  Okay.  Then he’d wait.  Maybe it was nothing. That would be the worst.  It would sound like he’d made up an excuse to call.
Sam threw another cookie at his head but Rhodey just caught it in his mouth.  “Sfpffprrmfnnn,” he said, chewing.
Tony looked aghast.  “Never? Blasphemy! Tomorrow. After the thing. It’s a date. I mean, it’s a thing. Date is a term that people use to describe things people do.  Tomorrow is the date. Of the thing.  Look, you need to get to sleep, and so do I, so, um, enjoy the crackers,” Tony babbled, trying desperately to pour enough words on the fire to put it out.  He paused at the door, hand on the knob, and didn’t turn around. “You know, we all have demons.  You’ve seen mine.  So.  Just. I get it.  A little.” He opened the door.
Why, oh why, did Steve continually think things could not get any worse? He knew Natasha pretty damn well, and knew exactly what had just happened.  “Don’t bother,” he said, as Tony tried to open the door. What was it about this day? Now he and Tony were both trapped in his room after Loki had just given him away. And he was wearing Iron Man underwear. He felt bad for Tony.  It had to be more awkward for him than it was for Steve.
“So, engineering seems to have worked out all the kinks,” Steve began, and Tony tried very hard not to think about the word “kinks” coming out of his mouth.  It didn’t work all that well.  “But, I hit a snag in TeleCom Legal.”
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve replied, finally. “I’m just going to see a little more of the world. But you know how to get in touch, if you need me.”
“Shell, it’s like four am right now. I guess you can see that from the time stamp. I just wanted… well, I checked my email, because I was hoping I’d hear from you. Not a specific reason, just wanted to hear your voice. You know what I mean.
Tony grabbed his glass, and raised it in an ironic toast. “Better luck,” he said, derision just under control, and left Stern standing with his cronies. He checked his watch.  He could probably cut out in half an hour.  A little sooner if he promised Pepper he’d be early (on-time, to the rest of the world) to the next board meeting.
Steve raised an eyebrow. “That’s not a very good name for a kitten,” he pointed out. Tony laughed.  Good.  Steve liked it when he could make Tony laugh.  “Sit,” he said, indicating the counter. “Shirt off.”
Tony willed himself to think of other things. Anything else.  He kept running over the details in his mind. Who was Flying?  Was he being catfished? What details had he missed? A guy on a bike, with a blaring throwback boombox, weaving drunkenly through the park, blasted The Ataris for the sleeping squirrels and pigeons.
“I brought you lunch, Mr. Stark,” Steve told him, unnecessarily.  He didn’t know where to put it, and stood awkwardly, shifting his weight, unsure of his welcome.  He hadn’t been wrong, but then he hadn’t been kind either.
“Please.  I’d like to grant you a wish.  My domain is dreams, so it will only last for a day, but what do you wish for, Steven Rogers? What can I grant you, to ease your heart?”
“Steve. Seriously. Have you seen you?” Modesty was nice and all, but Tony didn’t know exactly what to make of just how self-effacing Steve was being. He seemed almost embarrassed. Was he maybe just always being chased for his looks? If so, they were missing out on the rest of him. “I bet you were drowning in girlfriends.  Or boyfriends. I mean, whatever, who am I to judge, right? But you must have had your pick.”
Tony had the glass halfway to his mouth when Steve came into the room, smiling goofily and swaying just a little.
Tony hit the hang up button on his phone, then shoved it hastily under his pillow.  He read the posting on ShieldSpies, then reread.
Lunch was in a cafeteria.  People pointedly averted their eyes in respect.  Or maybe Fury had warned them away.  Either way, it was a quiet existence. Sometimes Steve felt like he’d lose his voice in his silence.
“No, Mr. S—Tony.  She really didn’t.  You can trust her.  I.  I asked Jarvis.  I just noticed, and then, so.” He noticed? He’d been here like six hours.  How had he noticed anything?  “And she only gave me the code so I could help.  I swear.  She cares about you.  And.  I--I’m just trying to help.  But I get it if you. Because I. Look, I understand. So, I’ll find a new way to pay you back.”
Bucky sniffed himself and gagged again.  He stalked off to the bathroom, grumbling under his breath. As Bucky showered, washing the night and misery off his skin, Steve wished he could have done the same.  Cleansed himself of the last few days, started over.  It didn’t matter.  He sat down at the table, pulling Bucky’s tablet toward him and got to work translating.  Raza appeared to be based somewhere just outside Jalalabad.  Probably a little to the north, based on his Tajik. From what Steve could put together (thank you, Google), Raza was going to get a test batch of weapons to help with eliminating the specialized unit—some sort of retrieval unit?  After that, if everything went according to plan, they could go for the real target.
“That is correct, Sir.  Mr. Batroc is indeed demanding that currency is converted to diamonds.  And Captain Rogers’s other information is also correct, including financials.”
He wanted to tell Pepper and Rhodey how much they meant to him, how much he loved them.  He wasn’t sure if they knew.  He tried, but sometimes he knew he said the wrong things. He threw gifts at them instead of being able to say that he cared.  He was pretty sure they knew.  But he wished he could be sure.
“Nope.  I’m sorry, Tony.  Same rules apply, even if you’ve donated the computer lab.” Coulson was implacable that way, perfectly fair, all of the time. “You can get it back after school.”
“Aw, Tony, I’m sure he likes you, too,” Steve said, picking up his bowl with the other hand. “You hungry?” he asked the kitten.
“Got a crowd, I see.  Classy, Rogers,” Rumlow ground out.  “Very Harry Potter with the team building.”
Something Jimmy had said caught in Tony’s brain.  The SAT? Three times?  But he’d been so sure last time, about Pieter. He’d just have to wait this one out.
that man, and he owed him the truth.  Tony twisted the watch again, feeling the metal edge bite deep.
They started going through the study guide, but Tony couldn’t focus.  He was too wrapped up in trying to monitor Hammer and scan the room for any odd family photos or Batman memorabilia.
Steve smiled at him, pure sunshine. “Great! Don’t worry about it tonight, though. You did good work out there.  Besides, we’re supposed to have a movie night tonight, and I wanted to watch the one with the clones.”
like she was thinking about kicking Hammer through a wall, so clearly she was acting on Tony's behalf), Tony was still elated.  The feeling of freedom, from telling Natasha, from being brave, he couldn’t contain it.
No.  Steve liked Natasha. He would have put money on her asking Bucky to marry her before the end of the year.  She knew how difficult it was to transition back to civilian life, and she’d never been anything but supportive.
“Sir is on complete blackout, Captain,” Jarvis said regretfully. “Even I can’t speak to him or interfere unless it reaches an extreme threshold of behavior or time.”
Steve repeated, “No big deal. Misunderstanding.  So, what’s first on the agenda for the study session?” It was clumsy, but Pepper stepped in for him, running through her schedule she had prepared for them all.
It was empty.  Small mercies. Steve set the blueprints on the desk and retreated to his room, repacking his few belongings into his duffle.  He fully expected to be expelled from Mr. Stark’s mansion when he found the blueprints.  It was only 9pm or so, but Steve was exhausted.  He’d made a mess today.  Tomorrow, he’d clean it up, and find a way to help Bucky fix it.  Again. He laid down on top of the covers in the giant bed in his room.
“It’s being worked out.  I’d say another two or three days.  Just thought you’d want to know now, start packing your bag. Do you have a bag? Your bindle? Fold up your hankie squares?” He hears Steve sigh. It sounds like his lungs unfurling for the first time.  He imagines him, standing tall, looking up at the Wakandan sky. It’s picturesque, even in his mind. “I’ll send a jet. I need some help on the ground up here.”
He actually did remember this exact day.  He had turned sixteen a month before.  Maybe a little less. Tony’d just met Rhodey, who knew he was going to be Air Force no matter what, and was already looking at areas where he would be likely involved in conflict.  Not surprisingly, the Middle East was a hot zone.  They’d been debating how to solve issues, like the two semi-idealistic, half-drunk, very narcissistic idiots that they were.  Rhodey had brought up the example of post-WWI Germany as compared to post-WWII Japan, building a case for providing education and infrastructure as a low-cost way to avoid future conflicts.  Eventually, drunk off their asses and sitting on the floor of the dorm, they’d cobbled together a proposal, sent it to Howard, and finished off the rest of the single malt.
“Hey, no.  Don’t do that.  The only disappointing thing about you is that you don’t actually taste like apple pie,” Tony jokes.
“Oh, I know,” Steve replied, all innocence and guileless charm.  “Mr. Stark was just trying to get the Starkphone rolled out because of the new campaign.  You know,” he looked down at his SI France portfolio, “donating 10% of the proceeds to developing better clean water facilities in former French territories. The faster he can get the facilities going, the better, is all he thinks.” Steve rolled his eyes a bit, trying to get on Batroc’s good side—building camaraderie against bosses who didn’t see the whole picture.
She looked downright furious at him. “He owes you, Steven. More than just some sop-gut apology that Fury’s going to send him over with.”
“Of course, Sir.” At once, a display of Batroc’s office, sans Batroc, appeared.  Steve was looking at the screen, and missed the way Tony started at the idea of Jarvis calling anyone but him “sir.”
“Tony.  It wasn’t your fault. You were trying to help.  You called the FBI.  You were being responsible.”
“I’ll leave if you want me to.  I can sleep in my old room.  I just don’t want to leave you alone, here.  I almost lost you. I can’t lose you.”
Steve threw a leg over his bike, put the key in the ignition. In a reckless act of daring, he called out, “I will miss you, Tony.”
And every night he went home and made dinner, using another of Coulson’s carefully curated lists. He made a cup of coffee, weak, but comforting.  Then, signing onto the café’s wifi, he checked the message board.  Sometimes Sam would post something, or a new voice would join the chat.  Sometimes there was nothing new.  He would read one of the books that Coulson had carefully chosen as fun reading—works he’d known from before, classics he’d never had the time or money to read, modern novels.
“Thanks for that,” Tony said.  He was truly grateful.  Galas were normally awful.  He knew he had issues with alcohol, but they ran in the family, a long ingrained quirk of biology.  Howard had always maintained there was no such thing as an alcoholic, just a weak man.  He’d often implied to Tony that such a man wasn’t worthy or capable of running SI.  Of course, he’d implied a lot of shit.  Tony just didn’t trust people to be sensible anymore.  He figured, all he had to do was hold out for another few weeks, keep the facade up, and then it would be irrelevant.  Pepper would run SI in her perfect, efficient way.  She’d do her best.  Tony just had to leave her a strong foundation.  He couldn’t risk tanking the business before then. This one good thing, he wanted it to last.
And Stern thought he owned him. Literally owned him. Government issued.  Property of the US Army and Senator Stern until they were done with him. And there was Howard, signing off with that squiggly little SI code that Tony hadn’t recognized—although it did look familiar now—conveniently telling Stern he supported the whole transaction, that Stark Industries would press no claim on Steve, in return for amnesty for human experimentation, and that the “test subject” belonged to Stern as long as the senator wanted him.  Fuck fuck fuck.  Tony continued reading. Howard was a grade-A dick, and he covered his ass--
Steve still knelt next to him, holding his hands, barely breathing.  He was alive. Tony was alive, color coming back to his skin, the new reactor glowing steadily. Steve had to tell him, to show him.  He’d almost missed his chance.  “Tony.” His voice caught. “I.” He swallowed.  Carefully, he brought Tony’s hand to his mouth, very gently kissed the tips of his fingers, making his lips as soft as he could.
“No, but we don’t like strangers,” Happy told him. Then, looking quickly at Pepper, “Which you clearly aren’t. But it’s good to have your information.  You know, in case of an emergency.” He looked back at Pepper, who smiled ever so slightly.  “So, you know.  I’ll be up to see you in a minute.  Get you a badge. Which you have to wear, at all times.” He glared slightly.
Tony wasn’t going to lie to himself here.  If this blonde giant weren’t so beautiful, he’d have killed this conversation in its inception.  As it was though, “I just fired my PA.  Well, not fired so much as promoted.  Well, I gave her the company.  So, I have an opening, as it were, for an assistant.” Barnes raised an eyebrow.  He knew exactly what Tony was thinking.  He’d seen Tony looking. He’d blush, but he really couldn’t be shamed.  Not by his would-be thief. “You know, handle all the things I don’t want to handle.  Pick up things for me.” He had a sudden urge to drop things just to see him bend over.  Down, boy, he told himself. “I just don’t like getting handed things.  You’ll have to do some paperwork, liaise with Stark Industries, help me evade Pepper—that’s my old PA. Sometimes that means all hours.” Tony could imagine blondie sleep ruffled and, well, honestly, looking sort of adorable.  How was a giant that adorable? And in his imagination? Whatever.  Business at hand.  “So, if you want it.  That’s what I got.  Start paying off the Chihuly.” He found he suddenly really wanted not-a-Neanderthal to accept.  But he had the upper hand, anyway. Wasn’t like the guy could actually say no without putting his friend in a bind. And somehow, Steve didn’t seem like the type of guy to do that.
Steve was wavering, not sure if he should sign up or click the back button, when something Wilson wrote caught his eye.
Steve was already in the conference room, scanning his notes.  He smiled at Tony when he came in.  Tony sat down next to him.
Jarvis’s voice broke into his thoughts, once again bringing news about Barnes.  “Mr. Stern apologizes profusely, sir.  He says no need to bring Anderson Cooper into this, or Mr. Barnes, and he is so sorry to have irritated you. He appears to find Mr. Cooper rather intimidating.”
Nomad shows up to help fight a pack of aliens a few weeks later.  Turns out they’re just lost.  Takes Steve Rogers to figure it out though.  Of course he does.  He goes by goddamn “Nomad.”  Tony ends up having to reverse engineer a tiny balance for their ship, to help them get back on track.  He takes Steve with him back to the tower, because the idiot has a giant burn on his side, where a panicked alien had gone right through whatever flimsy spandex product he’s using as a uniform.  Costume, more like.
Christ.  Tony vaulted from where he sat, he was on Steve in seconds, hands plunging into his jacket, reaching up to kiss him, to really kiss him, kiss that look off his face, the doubting one, the one that thought somehow, beyond all reason, that Tony didn’t love him, too.  His nose hit Steve’s but it was okay, Steve held him up, caught the momentum of his pounce and gently, so gently, ran his thumb over Tony’s cheek. The perfect first kiss.
“Look.  Hammer, I’m just going to—” Tony started when Hammer puked his guts out, all over Tony’s jacket.
He packed a bag. Just a few clothes, toothbrush, cash. He was just double checking that he had what he needed when Natasha showed up in his doorway.
“In my old unit, Sir.” Steve realized, as he said it, his posture was stiff, spine drawn tall. He willed himself to relax.
Steve smiled.  “You earned it. Besides, you’re on the swim team and student council and your grades are amazing.” Tony added another tally to his not-a-drug-reference list.
Sam pretended to yack up a hairball while Natasha glared at Tony.  “Couldn’t he have just texted?” she asked.  “Or emailed? Or face-timed?”
Tomorrow Tony will look over at Steve, across a room filled with their friends, only to find him already looking back.  He’ll realize that this is all he wants. And that it’s already his. And that it is only the beginning.
Tony knew he should have fixed that. Supersoldier hearing and all. He steps from his alcove.  “Where’s your team, Steve?”
JustaShell: I’m trying.  But it’s hard to live up to that kind of standard.  He thought I could be someone better than I am.  He believed I could change… the world, practically.
I haven’t heard back from you.  I’m hoping you’re not disappointed.  If you are… I’m so sorry. Truly.
Steve’s conscience ate at him, but there was probably no universe in which he could reject Tony.  Knowing him as he did, having watched his relationship with Pepper crumble, he knew how rejection crushed him, wounded him in a way nothing else seemed to do. This was torture. This wasn’t the deal he’d made with Njorun, and a part of him whispered that it was penance, that maybe he shouldn’t have asked for anything at all, what right did he have to this? He’d asked for a day where he could show Tony his love, not a day in which Tony was in love with him.  And that’s what it felt like. He was getting everything he wanted, in his secret heart.
“Thought I’d finish reading Stark’s files from home,” Steve replied, equally mildly.  If it was sparring Coulson wanted, the niceties and politeness, Steve was well-trained.  If Coulson wanted to prove a point, he’d have to get mad.
He released Steve, smoothed down his shirt, eyes fastened on his collarbone, a place he’d very much wanted to lick next.  He said, calmly, voice steady, “Do you mean you had delayed onset of symptoms?”
Steve’s heart sank.  “It’s the truth, sir.  Bucky’s one of my only friends.  Natasha, that’s his girlfriend, we met in Iraq.  That’s about it.  I really don’t want to cause any trouble, you know.”
“Finally a mystery solved,” Wanda said, winking at Sam.  “He was always saying how he wasn’t into organized sporting teams until one day he came home with a pair of racing flats.”
Tony sat on the couch, shirt covering the reactor, pliers back on the table. Footsteps.  Great. Not just Obie, but he brought along one of his low-life goons masquerading as security.
Well, he wasn’t wrong, Tony thought. It was a long email.  And Tony did know how he felt.  Exactly how he felt.  Pepper and Rhodey would definitely stick by him. Definitely.  But it would change everything in his life.  They’d known him forever. Pepper was his girlfriend from preschool through kindergarten, back when they’d thought being boyfriend and girlfriend meant dressing up in your mom’s pearls and drinking lemonade out of martini glasses.
Fuck.  Well, if he already knew, what difference did it make? Tony unbuttoned his shirt.  The light emitting from his chest was barely noticeable, one petal struggling valiantly to shine.
“Go get your man. I’ve got it covered,” Steve reassured her. “And thanks, by the way, for programming Bucky into my speed dial,” he added, remembering what Tony had said.
He broke free suddenly, sitting straight up in bed, perfectly still, trying to control his nightmares through sheer force of will.
Steve was looking at him sort of quizzically.  “I don’t understand.  How did we get from you wanting to play chess to being on the cross country team?” he asked, genuinely confused.
Well, it’s not like he had to worry about seducing beautiful people, or finding love.  Or even lust. Not for much longer, anyway.  He gave himself maybe two months.  Maybe.  And sure, he could find something to replace the palladium. It’s not like he wasn’t trying.  But there was a little voice inside that whispered that there wasn’t a replacement.  And that it was fair.  It was only what he deserved.
“Tony. I’m not a genius but I can recognize your work when I see it.  I got a close up in Germany, remember? And I do use one, now.” He has to.  Sam isn’t as good at catching him.  He doesn’t say it, but Tony can hear it anyway.
Well.  If Rogers had changed her mind… It didn’t even matter, anyway.  Still.  What kind of a man goes from being disgusted by Tony’s scars to bringing him waffles at work? Maybe it was a guilty conscience. Pity. Maybe he just really wanted to pay for that Chihuly. He realized, halfway through, that he’d eaten a fairly good breakfast.  Well, Pepper would be happy.  And he liked that she’d be happy.  She deserved it, after all.  Put up with him for years. He sighed.  She’d be well set when he was gone.  Control of SI rested with her, after all.  His shares would go to her, barring any paternity suits or other family popping out of the woodwork, and then she’d have majority control of everything, besides being CEO.
“Jesus,” Tony said, clearly confused, “you’re not female. I mean I guess you have the chest for it but you’ve got more manbits than my usual partners.  Less, you know, long hair and well, clitoris.  Did they know about the clitoris before you were frozen?” He groaned, shielding his eyes. “What the hell is going on. Am I in your room? What did I drink last night?” Tony asked, blinking in the sun.
He just had to wait, then.  He willed himself to relax further, the vestiges of the nightmares dropping away softly, becoming more dream than reality.  A few minutes later, exhaustion hit him, heavy and inexorable. All the adrenaline dissipated, leaving him shivering, goosebumps forming all over his arms and exposed torso.  He was enormously thirsty, but the idea of dragging himself to the bathroom to get a glass of water was overwhelming.  It was okay, though.  He’d be careful to drink extra water tomorrow.
Steve couldn’t reply.  His whole body was rigid, fighting to contain the feeling of his entire world flying to shards, to hold all the broken pieces together, inside.
“Like what, Tony?” Was that patronizing tone truly there, or was he being swayed by Steve’s drawing?
Back to the plan.  Well, the modified plan. Find the loose thread in SI. Bring it to Tony. Thank him for protecting Bucky. Muster up the courage to lay out his heart, no expectations other than that he might have been right in the first place, and hope for the best.  It wasn’t much of a plan, but it was something. Somewhere to start.
Damnit. His brain started spinning, considering ways to convince Stern to play fair, only take aim at Steve.  Was this retribution for Tony’s threat? No. It had to have been before that. Bucky had been drinking for hours to be in that state. It was probably a power play to get Steve to come crawling to Stern.
“Well, he has excellent taste,” Peggy declared, drawing the attention off Steve.  Tony was still watching him, though, and he saw the grateful look Steve shot at her.  “Can I draw first? I don’t want to overstep my welcome.” Tony watched as she swirled her hand in the hat dramatically.  Not that many women could pull off the bright red lip color that she wore. She drew a card out, read it, and flashed a mysterious, coy smile.
Why hadn’t Steve just said something? Why hadn’t he told Tony about it, that he needed it.  Why hadn’t he said Stern was coming after him? Tony could have helped him.  He could have made sure Stern wouldn’t touch him.  He would have tried, even without this little paper.
“Well, she was eyeing you like you were dinner.  Definitely didn’t have a story in mind when she was looking at you,” Tony felt obligated to say. Hard to blame her, really.
Hammer showed up, too. As fucking Hugh Hefner, complete with a set of bunnies: Mya, Christine, and Lorraine.  What kind of a douche showed up trying to get with one girl by bringing three other girls in lingerie? Asshole.
Steve sighed, setting down the shield shaped backpack and taking off his leather jacket.  Small mercies that SHIELD even let him ride a motorcycle to his own apartment.  As if they weren’t also probably making sure his neighbors were SHIELD agents.  Always had to control the circumstances.  He understood it—he’d been a little well, shell-shocked so to speak, coming out of the ice.  And the world was a lot… more complicated than it had been.  He thought about ditching the green Ford Focus he saw  trailing him two blocks behind, but it seemed petty when he knew they must have a tracker on the motorcycle itself anyway.  And they knew where he was going.  Work.  Home.  Work.
Then he got himself under control. He entered the ostentatious room to find Tony, on his knees, dripping wet.
She reached to his face, touching his forehead gently.  “I hadn’t realized mortals had become so wise.”
From the foyer, Steve could see Tony eye the glass.  The genius didn’t have very many moves left.  He could take the glass, drink it, and hope for the best—an addict with just a taste of poison.  He could pretend to drop it or knock it out of Mr. Stane’s hand, but knowing men like Mr. Stane, he’d probably just call for another.  He could turn it down, but first, Mr. Stane would be offended, and second, Christine Everhart was watching their interaction like Rita Skeeter, waiting to sensationalize the most trivial events. That would turn into a story about SI being fractured by internal disarray. All options were bad.  None of them gave him an out.  He could see Tony weigh them all, and then begin to lift the glass, tension showing in the set of his lips.
Tony couldn’t contain himself, his good mood spilling over despite his absurd caution. “Obie! You will not believe.  The things.  The ideas. I have all the ideas. Did you see the reports from our South Asia team? The first camp.  It’s built.  They’ve gotten overflow from those two camps in Jordan and Lebanon with zero instances of cholera and 100% vaccination rate against polio.  It’s working.  It’s amazing. And the UN Refugee Agency is sending a liaison next week to talk with SI about how to replicate them.” And now, Tony himself was going to be able to meet with them instead of being worm food.
Ugh. The man could easily pass for a football player, but he still managed to look like a kicked puppy, small and aware of his transgressions.
“James, that boy’s like nine,” Pepper tried to admonish him, but she was laughing.  “He’s clearly a lost 7
Tony couldn’t deny it. He did. Who was this guy? “You don’t understand.  I mean, at first, yeah, he’s gorgeous, right? But he’s smart, too.  He made some changes to some of my plans, and they were good! I told Obie to—“
Blondie (Stevie, Tony corrected himself in his mind) turned those blue eyes on Tony.  “Please, Mr. Stark.  Please don’t press charges against Bucky.  He… I know, he broke in, and he damaged,” his voice turned mournful, “this Chihuly and probably other things, but he’s just trying to help me out.  It’s my fault, and his service record is spotless. He’s been shortlisted for an experimental prosthetic treatment through the VA, but they won’t want to take anyone who’s gotten into legal trouble.”
Tony’s stomach flipped over.  Okay.  Not Pieter. Okay. That was okay.  In retrospect, he wasn’t all that cute anyway.  It was almost as if imbuing Pieter with the qualities he knew that Flying had, that’s what made him attractive.  But Christ, he’d been so sure.  It had all matched up so well.
Tony weighed the odds for a split second.  Keep Hammer baited for eight months, give or take.  String him along just enough, never letting him too close to Nat… maybe something new and shiny would come along. If he could just keep up the game for those short months, he’d be out free.  Nat would never even have to know.  His father.  Howard.  He wouldn’t be able to touch him once he turned eighteen.  Okay. It was a deal with the devil, for sure, but Tony thought he’d be able to do it.  Play Hammer. Protect Natasha. Keep everyone’s secrets.
Finally, Tony picks up the phone again.  Parker is going to stay local, he says. Friendly neighborhood Spiderman.  The Accords are coming together. Ross is backing off. Tony knows this wears on Steve, being a fugitive, an exile. A war criminal.  All the names that are hurled at him, and he bears it.
So Tony stuck to his word. He laid down on one of the mattresses placed on the floor, wrapped himself in several blankets due to the decreasing temperature, and thought about Steve. He thought about the time they first met. He thought about the first time the said ‘I love you’.  The way Steve would always come down to the workshop, and make sure that Tony had something to eat. The way he always got so determined when he was on a mission. The way he always tried to be there for all members of the team. He imagined the taste of Steve’s secret hot chocolate and his homemade tortellini. Tony thought of the way Steve would get so focused when he was drawing. The way his blue eyes seemed to shine brighter than Tony’s arc reactor…
“I… I…” Peter’s face crashed into Tony’s shoulder and he wrapped his little arms around his neck. “I didn’t want him to leave!”
The next picture Steve took on their honeymoon. He had woken up early one morning and hopped in the shower. But when he came back into the bedroom, Tony was sprawled on his stomach across the bed, nothing but the white sheet covering his backside. Rays of sun cast into the room from the balcony. The sun had reached Tony and made his bronze skin sparkle. The highlighted strands of his hair seemed to shift in the light. Tony’s sleeping face was free of all stress and anxiety. He looked so peaceful. Steve couldn’t help but photograph it.
“YAY!” Peter yelled, letting go of Tony and began jumping up and down. “I have to tell you this joke Ned told me! It’s really funny! So a gorilla and a panda…”
Ned and Peter began to talk loud and fast about some game they were playing while Tony and Steve looked at each other, and couldn’t help but smile.
“Do you think he’s tired?” Bruce asked as he watched Peter’s eyelids slowly close, and then bounce open, and then close, and then open again.
By the time he arrived at the address listed on his phone, he looked up at the abandoned warehouse and rolled his eyes. Abandoned warehouse? Really? Ugh, it was such a clique.
Tony felt Steve’s presence before he saw him. Steve appeared at his side and wrapped one of his arm’s around Tony’s shoulder and placed the other one underneath Peter. “Because that’s our job, Peter, to protect you,” Steve said, his own eyes filled with tears.
Steve chuckled as he rested his hands on Tony’s waist. “We’ll be back in a few hours. And in the meantime,” he pulled Tony’s body closer to his until their noses were only inches apart, “you’ve been telling me that you would take me to this restaurant since before we were married.”
The rest of the Avengers were also bombarded with questions revolving around the prenuptial. They would either refuse to comment or say things like, “I’m happy for them”, “No one was surprised,” or “Thank you, but they value their privacy”.
Steve lightly placed his lips against Tony’s forehead, “Merry Christmas, love” he murmured into his skin.
After the snap, everything changed. Tony’s brain felt like someone had pressed the fast forward button on a remote, while it was on pause. The world around him seemed to zip by, while he was slowly pulled through a murky haze. Both Nebula and he took the Guardians ship afterward. It didn’t seem too damaged, at least… not until the third day.
After that, the Avengers were so busy fighting missions that they were rarely ever seen in New York City. If any of them were seen, it was a rare occasion. Tony Stark hasn’t been seen in NYC in over five months.
Once they were far enough away, Peter took the card from behind his back and handed it to Gwen. “This is for you.”
“Hey Tony,” Natasha said one morning from across the breakfast table, “look at page six.” She then proceeded to throw a folded up newspaper, across the table, towards his face. Tony closed his eyes, expecting to feel the newly printed paper slap against his skin, but instead of the impact, he felt nothing. He opened his eyes to see Steve’s arm stretched out in front of his face, holding the newspaper in his hand. “You ruin all my fun, Rogers,” Natasha muttered into her freshly buttered toast.
The worst part about this is that Steve lied to him. He knows that Steve tried to protect him, but that doesn’t change the fact that he lied. Tony wonders how long Steve knew. He wants to know how long Steve hid this secret from him.
“Uncle Clint asked me to bring your gift. Do you want it?” Peter absentmindedly nodded his head, not truly understanding the words coming out of Natasha’s mouth.
"Did you find anything." ‘Clyde’ asked, momentarily pulling his lips away before attaching them to Tony's neck. Biting and sucking on the taut flesh.
As the time passed by, Tony listened to Hammer drone on and on about how amazing his products are and how great his start-up company is and how he thinks that Stark Industries would really be better promoting themselves if they partnered with Hammer Tech. It was awful. Tony waited an hour before making his play. He had stood up to head towards the bathroom, but before he could do that, he quickly slipped behind Hammer's chair and leaned against the sitting man before whispering seductively in his ear, "I'm going to freshen up, I'll be right back, darling. And then you could tell me more about your ideas for self-destructing ammunition."
right. When the Captain said they were going somewhere nice, Tony pulled out all the stops. A William Westmancott three-piece fitted suit, Armani wingtips, and a stunning Cartier with a black wristband. And Tony had to admit, he looked damn good. So if he has to do this for the Captain, then the Captain better fuck his brains out later tonight.
“Guess not,” he shrugged, walking past him to a bag hidden in the shadows. Tony rolled his eyes when he saw what the man pulled out.
The blonde turned to face his crew, jutting his head toward the body Tony shot down, signaling one of his men went to go fetch it. Turning back to Tony he said, “I have to admit, I wasn’t expecting to see you here.”
“So,” he wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, tucking his chin into Tony’s neck, “A little birdie told me that you confessed your feelings for me and asked me out. That’s apparently how we got together all those years ago.
“Gwen Stacey?” Steve remembered her from Peter’s birthday. She had long blonde hair. Peter talked about her a lot.
“Oh please!” He called out, basically snarling at the man, “My only use for you is to be your doll to use to con people and then fuck! You don’t want me for me Cap! I just can’t do this anymore.” He collapsed to the ground in his heap of blankets, sobbing as his body crumpled, folding in on itself.
He nodded.  “Just for a little while.  See the sights.  It’s been a while, and the world’s changed a lot. Figure I should see some of it, while I can.”
Wanda came forward in the dim hallway.  “He’s just really fast.  Always running.  What’s up?” she echoed.
Something loosened up a bit in Steve’s shoulders. “Me? I’m just a kid from Brooklyn,” he said with a wry grin.
Breakfast was normal, except that Tony stole Steve’s bacon and rested his hand on Steve’s thigh for the entire meal.  Sam caught a glimpse of that hand, but he just nodded to himself, in seeming approval. The team went their separate ways after helping load the dishwasher.  Steve made another pot of coffee, like he usually did, since Tony drank coffee throughout the day. This time, Tony stayed with him in the kitchen sitting on the counter, sneaking him kisses whenever Steve came close enough to reach. Steve finally gave up.  No one would come to harm.  He had a day. He’d take the kisses while he could.
Tony pulled into the garage.  He turned to look at Steve.  Steve was still looking at his hands, playing with the metal chain on his wrist. He looked defeated.
Bucky smiled and tried to sit up, wincing. “Christ.  Did you push me off a cliff or something last night?”
“Wait a goddamn minute, what did he mean ‘difficult time of year’?” Rhodey asked, making Tony smile gratefully on the inside.
“Um, I’m not sure, it could be? I mean, he might? I might, if he, I might…” Tony blabbered.  “This isn’t really my—”
“I’m not bored,” Tony said, quickly.  He was not going to lose out on Steve time. And he didn’t want Steve to think he was getting bored of his company.  They’d started out a little rough in the beginning, back when Tony had thought Rogers was a bit of a grandpa and Steve thought Tony was flighty.
He made some coffee in the little plastic machine, adding a splash of milk and sugar.  He opened the computer that Coulson had given him to help him get acquainted with the world, but remotely.  Safely.  Where he couldn’t do any damage.  Just sitting, in his kitchen, trying to get settled in a world that had moved on.
Steve sat for a moment, making sure of what he had just seen.  “Jarvis,” he called, after a second.  “Do you record the video conferences?”
Tony tackled him, pulling his shirt open, kissing those pink lips, trying to say, “Me too” without removing his tongue from Steve’s mouth. Steve staggered backward and Tony just went with it, climbed up so he was clinging to Steve, trying to eliminate any space between them.  Finally Steve just picked him up, one of those giant, glorious hands supporting Tony’s ass.  Tony gave a very dignified squeak and used the opportunity to shimmy a little closer, now that he knew that the gift in Steve’s pants was really for him and not the product of magic, although it sort of felt magical to him at the moment.
This was the best thing that had ever happened to him.  “But I’m not sure if physics can defeat the Force.”
it wouldn’t make up for the weapons, for the destruction the Stark name had caused.  But it was a small piece.  Maybe, when it was done, he would feel some of that redemption.
“You must be Tony,” she said, sounding extremely posh. “I’m so pleased to meet you.  Steve has said only very nice things about you. Hello, James.  Lovely to see you again.”
Peggy nodded.  “That bastard just started in after the sweet little boy on Steve’s team, saying his parents would be glad they didn’t have to see their son grow up to be—it was horrible, and just because Peter almost touched Brock’s new motorcycle. He didn’t even touch it—well, he did make a rather rude comment about whoever had bought that kind of machine, something about horsepower—and Brock swung at him—”
He went to SHIELD.  He read through the carefully curated list of Wikipedia pages, History.com websites. Coulson would send him a list, and he’d read through it in his room, closeted away from the world. In his office, he could see daylight through a small window.  Other offices opened, pure glass over the city, the daylight and the bustle of the city vibrant and near.  His office didn’t have the same access to the world. The world didn’t have access to him.  He wasn’t sure if it was beneficial or not.  He was sure it was intentional.
Tony had never been so excited for school to be back in session.  Turned out he missed everyone more than he thought he would.  And Flying had said he was excited to be back in the same place as Tony, even if they didn’t know who they really were.  The halls were buzzing with excitement, kids filtering in slowly.  As the first bells rang, Tony stopped by his locker, dropping off the new workbook he’d gotten from Ms. Simmons.
Steve smiled, soft, knowing exactly what he meant.  Now that the gala was over, the weight of it seemed to dissipate from both their shoulders.  “Of course, Tony.” He paused. “What did you normally do?”
They parted ways, Tony taking the elevator to the penthouse, Steve heading for his suite.  Tony fell asleep that night studiously not thinking about Steve and his glorious sunshine smile and his kind eyes and his mischievous sense of humor and his careful dexterous hands, and his amazing…
Tony was burning from the inside out.  His heart thudded painfully in his chest, the sound thrumming in his ears, the air acrid and metallic. Every cell was swelling, sparking, filled with light, exploding.  His veins ran with liquid fire.
When he thought he had everything complete, he left the soldering gun cooling on a side shelf and grabbed a powerbar.  How had he forgotten just how disgusting they were? Maybe it was his gloves, since they still wore streaks of white lithium.  He stripped them off and tried again. Nope. That was definitely just how powerbars tasted.  He’d been spoiled.
Rhodey balled up his wrapper and threw it at Tony’s head, bouncing off by his legs. Asshole had good aim. “From the electronics store, goofball,” Rhodey clarified, working bits of granola out of his teeth.
“I thought—I thought I could do it, string him along, until I’m eighteen, or until some new girl came along. My father, I—he, I didn’t think you’d…” Christ, it sounded bad, even worse when he said it out loud, trade Natasha for his secrets.
“They’re not,” Pepper chimed in. “They’re really not.  The rules are the rules. The rules say the gift has to be handmade. No buying a pair of Jimmy Choos.” She looked hard at Tony.
He doesn’t look surprised Tony knows it’s him. A small sad smile dashes across his face and disappears.  Tony hates that look.  It hurts him, still.
Tony pulled up the refugee camp blueprints again.  They were just about ready.  Maybe one printed copy, go over it with a fine tooth comb, get it into production immediately.  With Steve’s quick catch on Batroc, they really could start breaking ground on the wells next week.  And that meant construction could start on the refugee camps in Pakistan and Oman within the month.
He walked back into the bedroom, this time opening the windows to let fresh air in.  He startled a bluejay that was sitting outside the window and it squawked at him, disgruntled, while he shook Bucky’s shoulder.
Steve just looked at him pensively, didn’t acknowledge Tony’s comment about the money. He reached out, taking Tony’s hand, stilling his motions.
“Shut up, asshat, I’m trying to make a speech—and I know you wired part of your last paycheck to that kid you saved in Afghanistan.  I know you, man. I know you. What happened?”
Somehow Tony’s confusion must have shown, paralysis be damned, because Stane continued in his villain rant.  Typical.  Obie was always one for grandstanding, and Jesus, Tony of all people could recognize a grandstand. “Ah, Tony. When I ordered that hit on you, I knew if that pack of fucking rabid Howling Commandos was around, they’d come and get you right away.  Had to take them out first.” Stane bent down so his face was inches away from Tony’s, reeking of cigar tobacco and cologne. “Worked like a charm. Took a nice little package of Starktech weapons, delivered to my late pal, Raza, but poof!” He grinned sharply, unfolding his hand like a small explosion. “No Commandos.  No Rogers.  No one to rescue poor little Tony.” He stood up again, the afternoon light glaring harshly against him, washing him out.
Tony tapped his fingers on Steve’s chest, counting. “When I have you come down to the workshop, even if technically I don’t need you around.  I had you teach me how to scramble eggs.  So I could be around you at breakfast for longer.  When I ask if I can take you to your meetings when really I should just let you go with Sam. Do you even know how long Dum-E’s been waiting to give you those watercolors? I just didn’t know how to do it without being awkward.”
“I know. I’ve never been so patient in my life. Hey, you did a whole PSA about that, too, about waiting for something,” he says as the thought occurs to him. He’s not running his brain-to-mouth filter today, obviously, or he wouldn't have admitted how keyed up he'd been, waiting for the jet to land.
“Tones, seriously, you haven’t noticed?  She got here like, two days ago.  The English girl?  She is so goddamn hot. I mean, she can totally kick my ass, I’m sure of it, but like, yeah, I could be into that.”
“It’s really more of a biologic,” Steve said, not handing it over.  “Shouldn’t Bruce be the one to take a look?”
“Oh, I’m so sorry, I thought this was the bathroom,” Tony heard himself say. “Carry on, no glove no—"
Cookies? Tony did a double-take internally. Not that he was going to flutter every time someone said cookies, surely there were tons of guys who learned how to bake cookies, right? From their moms? With their possibly awkward parent situation?  What did he know about the Maximoff parents, anyway? When was the last time he’d seen them? He remembered a guy walking out of the house, old enough to be a dad, surely. He hadn’t really gotten the dad vibe from the guy, though. Uncle maybe. And they were new to the area.  Tony was pretty sure that they were recent immigrants, roots somewhere in Eastern Europe. Did that account for the guilt that Flying felt about coming out and causing trouble? Because his parents had already given up their homeland to ensure a better future for Pieter?  And sure, he could have spent time in the hospital in middle school—and Tony would have no way to know. And how ironic would it be to have the guy he was crushing on—at least—living next door?
Steve almost laughed.  Coulson was a good guy, he was pretty sure.  Pretty sure.  He’d been wrong about people before.  Wrong to trust them apparently. Wrong about their core character.  “Okay.” He turned and put his coffee cup in the sink, rinsing it briefly.  Then he turned to the little coffee maker, looked Coulson directly in the eye, and turned it off.
Steve hung his head for a second.  He knew Bucky wouldn’t blame him, but still.  It had been the one thing he could do—help out Mr. Stark to pay for that sculpture.  A sculpture that Bucky only broke because he’d been trying to help Steve in the first place.
Still, it was probably better this way.  He didn’t think he could stand it if Steve was enamored with him only for it to be magically induced.  Arc reactor or no, his heart would give out if that love suddenly disappeared.
Okay, he could work with this.  He wrote down a number of words phonetically, saving them for Google, all the while keeping an eye on Bucky.  The poor bastard was still completely dead to the world.  It was good for him, though.  Steve’d tried to wake him up, tell him the news, but Bucky had been solidly asleep.  For now, Steve took his list of words over to the kitchen to make a snack for himself. He brewed another pot of coffee, trying not to think fondly that Tony would happily mock the little Mr. Coffee sturdily doing its job—trying to do its job.  It really just heated water and turned it brown. But Steve hadn’t had a lot of sleep over the last few days; he’d take what he could get.  He sliced up some cheese and laid it across a piece of what Steve thought was probably bread.  Probably.  Natasha had decided to try baking—as a form of therapy, she said.
The second time they have sex, Tony crawls out of Steve’s arms, drags him into the largest shower Steve has ever seen.  Tony lets Steve wash him, practically purrs when Steve takes his time working shampoo into his hair, pulling Tony back against his body, his cock already hard against Tony’s ass.  He turns his head to kiss him, trying to suck as much of Steve’s tongue into his mouth as he can. Steve smiles against his mouth, disengaging gently to rinse the suds out of Tony’s hair. He does a much more perfunctory job on himself, Tony notices.  He waits until Steve has just stepped out of the shower—out of danger of slipping, onto the plush mat—to sink to his knees, pushing Steve back up against the wall with his mouth. He looks up when he hears Steve’s breath, sharp, somewhere between a gasp and choking.  His hands are clenched, pressing hard into the wall.  That won’t do at all.  Tony grins as much as he can with his mouth as full as it is—and he’s pretty sure he’s never had the pleasure of a cock this thick before, but he definitely wants future visitation rights—pulls Steve’s hands off the wall and pushes them into his hair. Steve stops breathing and complies, tangling his fingers through Tony’s curls, but holds them there gently.  Not good enough.  Tony is going to blow his goddamn mind, Steve’s not going to be able to walk after this—even better, he’s not going to want to walk away.  Tony moans, throat constricting and vibrating around Steve, who lets out a groan, can’t help himself, fingers tightening and pulling, thrusting deep and rough for a few moments before remembering himself.  Tony whines a bit when Steve pulls back, but Steve literally picks him up, carrying him over to the bed. Tony loses his train of thought just about there.  Tony doesn’t let Steve take it slow this time, he opens himself up, quick and easy, straddles Steve, pushing him back onto the pillows, sinks down so quickly he can physically see Steve tighten with worry.  The tension disappears when Tony repeats the move quickly, over and over, shivering in obvious delight. Steve sets one hand on Tony’s hips, holding him in place so he can thrust up into his body, the other slicks him up and strokes him in rhythm, making Tony start cursing, babbling nonsense and endearments, Steve’s name interspersed throughout. Steve is shiny with sweat.  Tony is starting to go hoarse and he is close, so close. Steve releases his hip to catch Tony’s hand, watching him intently, brings Tony’s hands to his lips, kisses it, sucks one finger into his mouth, says, “Tony, sweetheart,” and Tony can hear the silent command. He doesn’t make a sound as he obeys, covering Steve in his mess, shuddering, spasms rippling through him, feeling Steve pulse deep inside him, and everything feels so right, so complete, so perfect, that he can’t breathe for a moment.  He realizes he isn’t lonely. He realizes he’s in love.  He realizes that he, too, is all in.
The night air was soft now, windows down, the warmth of twilight surrendering to a deep and welcoming coolness. Manhattan was bright, but the last few minutes, driving through Tony’s property, muted the neons and fluorescents to allow for the more delicate light from the stars, the forgiving moon. He thought, fleetingly, that if he opened his shirt, the arc reactor would barely be noticeable, reflecting instead the silvery beams from the night sky.
“So what’s the big secre—Hey, isn’t that—hey!” Sam dropped all his shit at Tony’s feet and sprinted toward the door.
“Suddenly, I get it.  You brought home a trophy pool boy, and he’s a Medal of Honor recipient.  Only you, Tones.  This only happens to you. Do you even know if he swings that way?” Rhodey poured two glasses and handed one to Tony.
Steve thought about it. He’d woken up and battled Loki, hadn’t stopped fighting since.  Before the ice… He’d been in basic training until he’d been made a USO exhibit, and from there he’d led the Commandos.
“Uh huh,” Rhodey agreed dubiously, catching the waitress’s eye and signaling for their check.  “Just take care of yourself.  Look, if Rogers is really that smart, have him help Stane out with the research into how those weapons got away from you, yeah? You gotta get some sleep.  You’re looking sort of worn down. You can’t do everything on your own.”
Steve knew that gentle tone, underlying the quick edge.  “Nope,” he said, punctuating it with a kiss on Tony’s ear. “Love you.” He dragged his fingertips down Tony’s spine, ignoring the way that his mess was starting to feel tacky between their bodies, petting the expanse of skin he’d been longing to put his hands on for ages, the muscular shoulders, the warm cleft of his ass.
Steve was doing that evasive blushing thing again.  “Just think how easy it’s going to be to kick my ass,” he said, side stepping the issue.  So clearly, he had definitely been in a secret, hotness-avoiding, intelligence-shaming, game-abjuring cult.  Nobody else in their right mind was going to leave a guy like Steve home on a Saturday—hell, on any night.  He was smart, and kind, and hotter than hell.  What kind of idiots didn’t want that?
“Sorry, Munchkin. I’m just thinking back- it was over ten years ago.” If you ask Steve any question about his and Tony’s early relationship or anything that led up to it, he would recall it immediately. Which was why he needed a moment to make a lie to add to Tony’s incorrect story. Afterall, when they first woke up naked after having drunken sex the night before, (Steve loves Asgardian mead) Tony ran from the room and locked himself in the bathroom, refusing to get out until Steve left the bedroom.
A little while later Nat, Bruce, and Thor worked their way up to the penthouse and were taking turns playing with Peter.
When Peter did wake up, two hours later, Steve had his bottle ready. The three of them sat on the couch, Tony eating the chocolate chip pancakes Steve had made, which were still warm from the stove and oozing chocolate, while Peter rested in the crook of Steves' arm, finishing the rest of his bottle.
“That’s just a bunch of ‘what ifs’,” Steve said simply. “We could spend the rest of our lives dwelling on the past, wondering how we could have changed outcomes by doing things differently. Do you know how many times I wondered what would have happened if I listened to Bucky and stopped trying to enlist in the army? How many times I wondered, what if I had stretched my arm a little further, saying Bucky from falling off that train. Or how many times I wondered what if I had never come out of the ice? What if I was still down there? What would the world be like today?” Tony shook his head. “I try to stop myself from wondering ‘what if’. Because everything that I’ve done, everything that has happened, brought me here. To you. And to him.”
“Can I hold him?” Steve asked as he stood before the woman holding Peter. Very gently, the woman placed the baby in his arms. The baby shifted a little, but didn’t stir.
Tony pulled out the gun he kept in his waistband and locked it, raising it in front of his face as he slowly took a few steps forward. Peeping inside the door, he surveyed the complete disarray coming from the inside of the warehouse. Countless of boxes and crates and tables were turned on their sides as various people hid behind them, leaning over the side to fire their weapons across the crowded space.
“Sorry for keeping you,” Tony said, making his presence known. Hammer stood up as Tony got to the table, clearly nervous about how this meeting and/or night was going to go. The Captain had briefed him earlier. Apparently Justin Hammer was just starting out in the weapons business and was already on AIM’s payroll. AIM is a relatively young gang that started out around five years ago in Queens before moving to lower Manhattan. And now that he’s meeting with Tony Stark, surely that’s enough to make the man wet his pants, but also knowing Tony’s reputation and this being an ‘informal business dinner’, Hammer’s brain is probably going into overdrive about all of tonight's possibilities.
“Do you want to hold him?” Steve asks gently. Tony nods and Steve very carefully transfer’s the baby into his arms. “I’ll start looking over the paperwork.”
“Yeah, he looks like it,” Nat noted as she sat down next to Bruce. “Make sure you burp him before he falls asleep.”
Tony felt that he won the jackpot with Steve. Everyone else feels like a mediocre prize from the arcade.
“Hey bud, there’s no reason to cry,” he said as he wiped the tears off of Peter’s cheek. “We left all the scary Avengers in the other room.” After a few minutes, Peter’s tears began to subside. “Are you feeling better? I know they didn’t mean to overwhelm you back there, everyone was just excited to see you.”
“Steve Rogers broke my heart,” Tony said facing the iPhone held in front of his face, before grabbing it and throwing it against the nearest wall. “Are you happy now?” He called to the crowd of reporters surrounding him before walking away and into getting into Happy’s black Audi.
“Believe me,” Steve chuckled as he squeezed his hand right back, “I miss that too.” The two walked in content silence for a few minutes, enjoying the familiarity of everything. They watched as a series of yellow cabs zipped past them and they listened to the dozens and dozens of indistinguishable voices spread across the city. “How do you think Peter’s doing.”
The Captain shook off Tony’s hand, walking to the body and scrutinizing the man he used to be.  “What are you doing here?” He asked, taking the gun off Rumlow’s body and tossing it in the corner.
Tony didn’t say anything, but he raised himself on his toes and placed a kiss on the end of Steve's nose. The pair broke apart and turned their heads when they heard the faint ping of the elevator doors opening.
freaked out?!” Steve said incredulously. “Me? You’re the one that bought seven bags of snacks and wanted to buy the entirety of Toys R Us for this playdate!”
“Good morning to you too,” he deadpanned, lifting the note Tony wrote him last night in his hand. “Why are you sorry?” ‘Clyde’ asked normally, as if this were a regular conversation, not one that was about to get him killed. But this might be his thing. Like leading a lamb to the slaughter; luring him into a false sense of security before he went in for the kill.
Tentatively, both leaned forward, meeting in the middle. It started slow, just the gentle brush of their lips, a chill racing through their body as Steve’s hands-on Tony’s waist tightened slightly. Soon they applied more pressure, traded playful kisses.
Continuing forward, while stepping over a pile of broken glass, Tony walked to the back of the warehouse finding a single door propped open with a cracked, red brick.
While the world now knew that Iron Man and Captain America were married, that didn’t stop the couple from hiding things from the public. After all, two years later when they adopted a little baby boy named Peter, the public didn’t find out about it for another fourteen years.
“I need to know,” Tony said, his fingers finally uncurling from their tight grip on the book, “How did you not know who Brock Rumlow was? He has a whole page dedicated to him in the book, plus they're a picture of him stapled in it and he’s mentioned several times throughout the Hydra section. How did you not recognize him?”
At the sound of Steve’s voice, Peter started wiggling in their arms. The blanket he was wrapped in, loosened and soon one of his arm’s broke free. Peter’s hand reached forward as his little body stiffened in his stretch. His little hand stopped moving once it found something to wrap its fingers around. That thing was Tony’s finger. After a moment Peter’s little tiny eyes slowly began to open. Soon two little brown orbs stared up at Tony and Steve. The two smiled down at Peter as a few more tears ran down there faces.
“Hi, baby boy,” Tony called out as soon as he saw the little tyke. Scooping Peter up in his arms, the toddler's face broke out into a huge smile. “Papa told me you crawled today! Did you crawl? Did you crawl?”
“Well last night, I took something from you and you got it back. Now the last time I saw you, something of mine went missing,” He held out his hand, palm up, “I want my property."
If the man can’t even trust him with something as simple as where he lives, then they would never get to a place where he would trust Tony fully. Let alone even tell him his name.
And even though his and Gwen’s schoolyard relationship only lasted three weeks, Peter will always pride himself on getting a girlfriend before Flash does.
As they descended across the familiar terrain of upstate New York, Tony could see small figures run out from the Compound and towards the ship. He felt so overwhelmed that he couldn’t tell who everyone was. When the Ravager ship landed, it was on the lawn of the compound, about two acres away from the actual building. The moment the ship landed and the door opened, Tony ran. He ran past Nebula, he ran past the ship Captain. He ran until he felt something, or rather someone, grab him. He felt large, strong arms wrap around his sides and soon he was breathing in a familiar scent.
An involuntary shiver left Tony’s body. His body was telling him that it wants food. That it needs water. He wishes he had a way to make his mind understand that he didn’t have any. “Food and water ran out four days ago… Oxygen will run out tomorrow morning.” He knew this was happening. He knew that he couldn’t escape his death. Years ago, Tony imaged that his death would occur when he was eighty. He thought that he would fall asleep next to Steve, and never wake up. He didn’t think that he would die in a drifting spaceship, about to run out of oxygen. But he knew his death was unavoidable. He’d come to peace with that years ago when he carried the nuclear bomb on his back and shot up through a wormhole in New York City. “And that’ll be it.”
“Not that I’m not thrilled about this outing, because I am, but this isn’t really how I pictured our date going.”
“When Daddy told me he liked me, I said it back. And the two of us went out on a date. We’ve been together since.” He cut the crusts off of the peanut butter sandwich before placing it in front of Peter. “Did that answer your question?”
Tony may have had his heart broken by Steve, but if he had the choice, he would go back to him every. single. damn. time.
While Tony did find the attention annoying, he sort of liked how the media was overall happy that he seemed to be in a happy, loving relationship. Although it was hard to go on dates without being followed by paparazzi. Some many times they’ve had to cancel plans instead of going out, in fear of the blinding flash of a camera.
“Steve hides the Cheetos behind the pretzels, and the ice cream behind the frozen Brussel sprouts, in the freezer,” Bucky said as he grabbed a bottle of root beer out from behind a bag of flour.
Yawning loudly, Steve finished brushing his teeth and was about to collapse on his bed when he noticed that a certain genius philanthropist was significantly absent. Forcing his feet to move, he trudged out into the hallway where he saw a light casting under the doorway of Peter’s room.
By the time Tony opened his crusted eyes, the light poured in from the windows and cast itself into his view. He sighed, snuggling further into his blankets when suddenly the gears in his brain started turning and his memories from last night/early this morning can back to him.
“Good,” Steve ruffled the curls on top of Peter's head, “now finish your cereal. We need to leave for school in 20 minutes.”
As Peter began telling the joke, which made no sense to Steve, he couldn't help but smile as his son talked about his new friend. Peter has always been super friendly, and it warms his heart to see how excited he is about new people.
“Of course I miss you. But Peter just… I don’t know. I never imagined I would be able to have this type of attachment to someone.”
As fast as lightning, a quick flash went off and the couple looked up to find the adoption agent pointing a camera towards them. “I figured you wouldn’t want to forget the first moment your son looked at you.” She said as she walked forward to show them the picture she had just taken.
His feet scraped against the floor as he headed back to living room. “I don’t know how Steve and Tony do it,” he said before he laid down, face first, on the floor.
Clint Barton, after he was hounded outside a bagel shop, once turned towards a reporter, looked straight into her camera and said, “They won’t shut up about all the planning, and they both suck at making decisions. One wants hydrangeas, another wants red, white, and pink, roses. I tried to tell them that they should use gladiolus, and now they are also, somehow, debating calla lilies!” He sounded exasperated as his arms slashed through the air around him. “I’m happy for them both, truly I am, but they are driving me crazy.” He then stormed away before the reporter could ask him another question.
While he had a point, it’s just something that Tony has been doing since he was younger. It started as a kid, stealing from his mother's jewelry box or snatching his father's newest tie clip. Then he got ballsier after being sent away to boarding school and would rifle through students backpacks in the locker room. And once he got to college, that’s when the real fun started. To most people there, he was just some spoiled rich kid who got accepted because of his name, not his mind. Even though he was only fifteen when he went to school, it didn’t matter to them. They didn’t think he had any real skill so he worked on perfecting his skills. Just not the skills they thought. And when one of their bracelets went missing or their shoes… well, who would expect him to be behind the thievery? “There is something so exhilarating about it. I just can't stop.” Tony reached out towards the Captain's wrist, which was lying face down on the mahogany surface, and glided his fingers over the surface of his watch. “I don’t want to.”
“I said I’m fine, Steve,” The brunette voice had an underlining edge to it that he wasn’t expecting. Tony looked at Peter before walking out of the room and Steve heard the faint click of their bedroom doors closing.
“Like you’re any better,” Sam accused, “you dropped his bottle and spilled milk all over the floor.”
Tony looked down at the golden Cartier watch wrapped around his left wrist, “Well he should be asleep by now unless the Avengers didn’t read the note we left on the counter… but hopefully, he’s doing well.”
“Wow,” Peter said, feeling the ghost of Gwen’s lips on his cheek. He sauntered over towards Ned and plopped down on the blacktop. “I’m a man now.” He said before telling Ned everything that just happened.
The couple had spent the past year trying to adopt a child. They’ve met with several expecting mothers before, but each time ended with rejection. Apparently, no one believed that the Avengers can raise children. Steve and Tony began to wonder if they would ever find a baby to add to their family. But that all changed when the pair got the call at 2:37 in the morning that a boy, no older than two months, was in need of a family. Tony called Happy to have him bring the car around and Steve called the other Avengers and informed them that they were going to the adoption agency. The two then ran out of the tower and into the car as fast as possible. When they arrived, they sat in the waiting room for what felt like forever before an adoption agent appeared and took them to meet their soon-to-be son.
“Well overall,” Sam said as he crashed onto the couch, “I think I did a good job. I’d be a pretty great babysitter, ya know if I needed to change careers.”
“We’ll be back soon, Peter! We love you!” Steve yelled before the elevator doors shut in front of him, separating him and his husband from their son for the first official time since adopting him two months earlier. “He’ll be okay, right?” He looked to Tony for reassurance.
Tony truly felt that he should have seen this coming from a mile away. Honestly, he was more upset with himself for not realizing the Captain's plan sooner. He spent all afternoon choosing between outfits and styling his hair
Since then, a year and a half had passed when Tony accidentally let something slip during a press conference. When asked why Avengers tower was no longer going to be used as the Avengers headquarters, and why a facility in upstate New York was, Tony responded with: “Well, my love still considers it to be some ‘big, ugly building’ in the middle of the city.” He said with a joking voice, “And upstate New York has much prettier scenery for drawing.” After those words left his lips, Tony's eyes widened as he looked at the sea of reporters, all who had just heard what Tony had just said.
“Huh,” Steve said as he watched Tony’s eyes follow the movements of his tongue and land on his lips. “I wonder who this ‘close friend’ in the article is? Clearly, they know you so well.” His lips turned slightly upward into a little smirk that
Tony stopped moving. He could feel his heartbeat drumming in his ears. Did he miss Peter crawl for the first time? How was that even possible? He was always with Peter. Always. Even when he wasn't physically in the same room as him, Tony could see Peter 24/7 using the nanny cam on the desk in his office. This wasn't possible. No. Tony had gotten up to get a report from Pepper three minutes ago. This made no sense.
“Tony, ” Steve whispered softly, wrapping his arms around his husband while looking on as Peter shifted lightly against the soft, yellow blanket he was swaddled in, “he’s four months old, I don’t think he knows it’s Christmas. I don’t think he knows what it is.”
After that, everyone began unwrapping their gifts for the little tyke while they still had his attention.
Cap was sleeping beside him, his chest rising slowly before collapsing on itself and repeating the cycle. Tony watched him like he did the night they met. Watched as all the worries and hardships that rested on ‘Clydes’ face melted away into a peaceful slumber. He looked younger when he slept. Happier.
“Ya know, I never understood that phrase. Do you find buttons cute? Because I find them-” Peter started fidgeting in Tony’s arms, upset that he wasn’t the focus of their attention.
"Well next time make sure it's you sitting on the other side of the table and you got yourself a deal." Tony rose his legs, hooking them behind ‘Clyde's’ hips, locking him in place. The fit was extremely tight, but Cap did all he could to rub himself against Tony while he rid him of their clothing.
So as quietly as he could, Tony opened the bedroom door and slipped out. It took Cap almost four months to allow Tony to leave his home base without a blindfold on. And it took a lot of begging on Tony's part to even get that freedom.
The goal was to find any potential contacts for AIM or any dates pertaining to any meetings, drop-offs, or anything else that appeared sketchy.
“Hey, Mr. Rogers, if you find this recording, don’t feel bad about this.” The dismantled faceplate stared back at him. Tony had to hope that Steve survived the decimation. He had to. Tony knew that the chances of Steve ever receiving this message were slim to none. But one day the ship might pass by Earth and the message left in his suit would be transmitted to the compound. Or maybe the ship will float into earth’s atmosphere and someone will come across the broken vessel. From there they will find his helmet, along with his decayed body. “Part of the journey is the end.”
Afterward, Tony sat in Steve’s lap, wrapping his arms around him while the Avengers each fought for Peter’s limited attention.
Little did Tony know, Steve was hiding out in a small hostel, five states away, staring at the same exact picture. Even though the photo was bent and scraped up, and the crisp edges turned round from being constantly removed from its place in Steve’s wallet, he always carried it with him. This photo was too valuable. Too important. Steve knew that it was dangerous to carry personal items with him, but it didn’t matter. He stared at that picture every night, thinking about how he broke the heart of the man he loves most in the world, and how he would do anything to fix it.
They’ve been together for five months now, and Tony swears he’s been in love with the man for the past three.
Steve posted the photo Bruce took when Tony got down on one knee and proposed. Apparently, all the Avengers knew that Tony was going to propose so they spied on the two of them while they were on vacation so they could be there to witness it. The next photo was of the two of them at the altar. Standing before each other with nothing but love in their eyes as they said ‘I Do’.
Natasha got him a twelve inch, caterpillar plushie with soft plastic rings woven into the material for him to hold onto.
So Tony had to leave. He had to. Because if the Captain couldn’t trust him, then what point was there in pursuing this relationship any further. Too many of Tony’s relationships have been built on distrust. He doesn’t want to build one with the Captain if it will have the same results.
“Tony, stop checking your phone,” Steve said as he twirled the spaghetti on his fork against the curve of his spoon. “Peter’s fine.”
Steve halted his movements of smearing peanut butter on two slices of bread for Peter’s sandwich before quickly resuming. “What?”
When he came to, the bloodied burlap sack was no longer on his head and instead he was sitting in what he looked like an office. The desk he sat in front of was covered in messy stacks of paper and countless scattered pens. There was a small window on the far wall and the window sill underneath it was littered with solar toys from the dollar store. Ones of snowmen and flowers and many others that start ‘dancing’ once the sun hits it. Along the wall pictures of the Captain and his team. Ones with crisp, untouched edges and others with curved edges and fading color. Some photos were looked more recent, judging by their appearances, while there were also photos where they looked younger. There was even a photo of the Captain and Guard Dog #1 as children. Huh. The Avengers must have formed young.
The way he looks at Tony is with lust, not love. He doesn’t reciprocate Tony’s feelings and it took him a long time to acknowledge that Cap only wants him for his body and his thievery skills.
Tony's brain pounded against his skull as he looked around the room. A comfortable-looking green couch leaned against the wall covered in a folded blanket and two throw pillows. Tony really wanted to take a nap on that but when he went to stand, his ankles were zip-tied to the legs of the chair and his hands behind the back of the chair.
“Hammer is all talk with no real bite.” The blonde guaranteed. “Besides,” he leaned in close, placing a feather-light kiss on his ear, lightly nibbling on his earlobe, “How could he say no to you, especially in that suit.”
After Natasha helped Bucky change Peter’s clothes, Thor picked up the small child and carried him to his room. Rhodey and Clint followed behind and watched as Thor bundled Peter up in blankets and gently set him down in his crib.
“No harm?” The brunette said behind him, “Ya just killed the guy. I’m pretty sure ‘no harm down’ ain't true.”
Tony knew this moment was coming for a while, but he had a hard time convincing his legs to move and lift him off the bed.
Tony looked out the window on his right. It amazed him that the only thing separating him from the unknown galaxy was a thin piece of glass. Tony wanted to reach out. He wanted to run his fingers through the Cosmos. He’d never seen anything as beautiful or majestic as the naked sky. It was so quiet. Untouched. Safe from human interference. “Just for the record, being adrift in space with no promise of rescue is more fun than it sounds.”
It was never the same for him when he slept with other people. Barbara was too loud. Christine was too freaky. Charles was too shy. Allison was too dominating. Harry was too self-indulgent. But with Steve… Steve knew how to satisfy Tony. He knew how to accept pleasure and dish it out. Sometimes when Tony is with someone else, he’ll try to imagine Steve’s golden hair instead of the brown locks in front of him, he’ll picture Steve’s protruding muscles instead of someone’s else’s noodle arms. He tries to imagine that Steve is the one moaning his name and marking his skin, and not someone else.
“Well, maybe we’ll make this a bi-weekly thing? We’ll have a date night and the Avengers can babysit. Clint told me Sam thinks he’s the greatest babysitter of all time.”
The Captain and his team looked like they wanted to speak, but didn’t know what to say. They kept shooting looks back and forth between Tony and Rumlow.
“Sam, you scared Peter, playing Peek-A-Boo, and made him cry,” Nat noted as she closed her eyes and rested her head on Bucky’s lap and settled her legs on top of Bruce’s.
Steve crouched down so he was eye level with his son. “Peter, do you remember what we talked about?” Peter’s brown curls shook as he nodded his head. “And what was that?”
Rhodey checked on him earlier, but he decided to keep his distance since Tony wasn’t in a very approachable mood. Pepper had called around noon to discuss SI business, but Tony knew that she was really just trying to distract him. It was a nice distraction though, Tony spent the better part of two hours on the phone, not thinking of Steve. But soon after he had hung up the phone, all his memories came rushing back to him. Steve and him stealing secret glances towards each other across the conference room. Steve and him laughing at something the other said. Steve and him swapping stories about there day.
And Clint was right. The next year when he gave Peter a box again, the toddler had given it all his attention, effectively ignoring the rest of his gifts everyone had given him. He did the same thing the year after as well.
And that’s the real question, isn’t it?  Because as long as Parker’d been busy chasing bike thieves around Queens, he probably wouldn’t pop on a national radar.  But now… “I’m working on it,” he says.  And he is. He has been, all along. But now it’s vital. The people who ordered a nuclear missile on Manhattan won’t care how young the kid is.
He awoke to loud voices booming in the hallway. Thor, definitely, and Tony, and a woman who certainly wasn’t Natasha, by her accent and timbre.  His door opened suddenly, and Tony, Thor, and a woman in Asgardian armor burst through.
Bucky ignored him and kept stirring. He tested it, drawing it up to see if the sugar was lurking at the bottom.
“Perfect,” Pepper said, a pleased smile on her face. “So, these lumps already know the rules: we draw random names. If you get your own, just put it back. No cheating—last year Tony tried to put mine back in the hat because he was trying for Bruce.”
Coulson let a wry smile slip into the corner of his mouth.  “Maybe we should get you something nicer.  An espresso machine or something.” It was almost an apology, but more like a shared joke.
“Bruce wouldn’t have liked the bunny, the bunny was gigantic and definitely not hand-made. It violated the rules,” Bruce told him, as he had many times already.
“Well, Miss Potts sent me a note, Sir.  She said she didn’t trust Batroc. I just kept my eyes and ears open.”
“Clearly Wonder Woman is the only person who can take down an evil Luke Skywalker,” Natasha broke in.  “Right, Justin?”
She was a goddess, so it was no surprise she could see through him, Steve supposed.  Surely she knew exactly what he wished for, what he wanted so desperately he ached with it.  “I.  Is it temporary?” He switched off the comm.
“Actually, she just sort of disappeared.  I don’t think I did any vanquishing,” Tony admitted.  He was certainly a hero, and recognition was nice, but it was a little uncalled for, in this case.
“Tony, please,” Steve groaned. “Please, I want you, please,” he couldn’t stop himself, he’d just waited for so long.
A knock sounded at the door.  Steve—without a petulant bone in his body—stashed the sheaf of redacted files between the sauce pan and the stockpot before he opened the door.
Tony thinks of the same morning, of Steve’s heavy thigh resting over his. He remembers thinking he’d never wanted to stay before.  He can picture Steve’s eyes, hopeful, so tentative. He swallows hard, throat suddenly aching.
Fuck this.  Tony was not going to die on Steve.  He was not going to leave him with yet another mess to clean up, another nightmare.  He was not going to do that to him.  It took him two tries, putting all the will he had left into moving his mouth, but he managed to wheeze out, “Jarvis. Reactor.”
Finally Steve was making progress.  Chasing the money directly hadn’t worked, too many international laws and lack of transparency making real headway almost impossible. The banks catered to people who had the funds to keep them rich, hiding them away from taxation and laws.  This email chain had to be the way in.
Steve sets them gently on the ground.  Tony can see a thousand apologies, a thousand pleas in his eyes.  Watches Steve check himself, rein it all in. He says, “Thank you, Tony.”
He follows him, maybe a month later.  Steve has this little battle well in hand, so Tony merely tags along, in the shadows.  After Steve hits the last killer robot squarely in the what’s-probably-a-head, he turns halfway toward Tony.
.  Which was totally the movie that Flying had mentioned earlier, the astronaut in that one movie about restarting the sun.  And Pieter wasn’t wrong, the astronaut was damn hot.
He felt naked, small, as Mr. Stark continued to watch him, observing, almost as if he was one of the engineer’s many projects.
Tony seemed to settle a little, relaxing into Steve’s arms.  “I need you inside me.  Just go slow, it’s been a while and you’re pretty talented in the size department.” He kissed Steve, playful, smiling.
Tony turned to look at him, really look at him, the way he was rocking a bit on his heels, hands in his pockets, waiting for an answer he already had.  Somehow.  Somehow he knew.  But no one was supposed to know.  Literally no one.  Rhodey didn’t know.  Pepper didn’t know.  The only people who had any idea what Tony had in his chest were a pack of terrorists in Khost and Steve.  And the thought of Steve betraying his secrets was too painful to consider. He buried that notion immediately.
Steve was taking glasses out of the fridge, frosty and cold.  But definitely not beer. “I made raspberry lemonade.” His lashes swept down, shadowing his eyes.
Steve shook his head, laughing, that light, golden laugh, that made Tony’s heart feel drunk, light. “No, for Bruce,” Steve said, sketching out some dimensions on the screen.  “For when the Other Guy comes out to play.”
Everything about him, Tony Stark, was so bright, so flashy. He was everything that Steve struggled with in the modern world.  So quick, so casual.  A flippant smile and wink to the cameras, false daylight.  Steve had enough practice with the press on the USO tours to know a fake smile when he saw it.  He wondered what it covered. He wondered if Tony remembered what it covered, if it ate at him, like it ate at Steve.
The light dimmed, faded to afternoon sunshine, melting at the edges to twilight.  Steve, blue eyes watching him intently, hope growing.
Tony moved toward him. “And this?” He tossed his phone on the bed, and it projected an image—Steve’s painting.  He didn’t know where the original was, had half thought it had disappeared when Njorun’s dreams dissipated, but apparently not, and Tony had found it.  “You made that.”
“I love you, Tony,” he said, bringing Tony’s fingers to his mouth.  He tried to make himself say goodbye, tried to brace himself for that moment when Tony realized where he was. He imagined it would feel like going into the ice all over again.  He’d survived it before.  He could do it again.  He could. He’d stand next to Tony, teammate and friend, bury his love and himself.
As the patter of British banter droned on quietly in the background, Steve gradually relaxed.  He missed Bucky fiercely.  It was coming up on a year since the incident.  Steve’d been assigned to a few VA doctors.  He hadn’t been able to say much, and they were overbusy.  They all said it would get better with time. He’d thanked them, and canceled any further sessions.  He appreciated their time, but he wasn’t even injured, and he knew from experience that men and women like Bucky needed those services. Needed them more than Steve. Deserved them. More than he did.  He’d walked them into the ambush. And his men paid for his actions.
“Uh, Steve, Sticky Fingers is playing with his phone at the table,” Tony tattled on Peter. Steve was a stickler for putting away tech during mealtimes. It was important.  For bonding. And sometimes Tony stayed longer, smiled more.
be our only legacy.  My only legacy,” he finished softly. He found himself looking down at the sketchbook still lying open on the workbench, somehow left unscathed by the falling shelves (and one very small and easily extinguished fire—Dum-E actually got it this time, which was worth celebrating in its own right).  He closed the book, smoothed the cover, fingers unthinkingly tracing over the letters on the front.  The edges of Steve’s drawing of Obie stuck out, a bit dog-eared.
Tony squeezed as hard as he could. Not like he could crack one of Steve’s ribs. “Steve,” he said fiercely, “you are more than just the shield.  And you deserve everything.  Anything.  You always take care of me.  Let me take care of you.”
“Okay, Morita, here’s a puzzler: You’ve got a Street Triple and a Moto Guzzi V7 Racer transversal V-twin. Which has higher horsepower?” Tony definitely had not been googling motorcycle specs to ask the question.
Tony lingered in the elevator when they reached the garage, not going back up to his workshop, but not stepping into the garage either. “Is there something you need here? I tried to make your room all, you know, you, but I’m happy to make changes if you want something. You just have to tell me, or Pep, or well, no, probably just me, Pep’s designer is a little too into feathers, if you know what I mean, but we can customize however you want. Those floors were mostly a base plan anyway.” He made a note on his phone, muttering “sheets” under his breath. Then he looked back up, eyes sharp. “Is this about this morning? It’s not a big deal, Rogers. Look, we’re in a new era, it’s not the end of the world when two guys wake up together. Not the first time it’s happened to me, although sure, usually not a coworker, or, you know, someone who’s almost double my age, I’m not usually the Anna Nicole type, you know?”
“No, no, of course not.  That’s not what I meant,” Stern backtracked, leaving a trail of slime. “I just wanted to have a conversation with him.”
Steve’s breath caught, Tony could feel it under his palm, a tremor running through his frame. After a moment, his chest rose and fell again, almost normal.  “I’ll hold you to that, Tony,” he said.
His email pinged almost immediately, as he was looking at straps to stabilize the back of the palette, making sure it wouldn’t slide too easily from Steve’s palm.
Steve reached out a hand, clearly without thinking about it.  He seemed to realize what he was doing as his fingers were just millimeters from Tony’s worst scarring.  His mouth worked, briefly, soundlessly, and he yanked his hand back. Yep.
Peter outstretched his arms towards Bucky who eagerly scooped him up. “Merry Christmas, Champ,” Bucky said as Peter smushed his face against Bucky's cheek, trying to give him a kiss.
Tony placed a hand on top of Steve’s, which was resting on Peter’s back. “We would.” He said with a mini smile. “And besides, you get to see Ned at school tomorrow, and you can invite him over again next week.”
"I'm gonna have to put that fucking burlap sack on again." Tony filled in as the Captain nodded, "That's great, no that just
When the two boarded the ravager ship, Tony found out pretty quickly that the ship seemed to be breaking. Luckily for him, most of the problems were interior, so once he was fed, he got to work on fixing what he could. By fixing the key obstacles, Tony was able to convince the Captain to take him to Earth.
“Well, they put him to sleep, that alone is worth the fifteen dollars an hour I’m paying them,” Tony whispered, leaning back into Steve’s arms.
Tony heard the shouts and gunshots from over three streets away. Honestly, don’t these mob bosses know that they will
“I got him some books. Some which can be bedtime stories and others one that are designed to help teach him the basics. Like ABC’s or counting to ten.”
The man still refused to reveal any details about his bride to be, but that didn’t stop the people from asking. Instead of people wanting to know about the technological advancements which were being made at S.I. (even though that technically was Pepper’s jurisdiction, people still asked him), or discuss the Avengers most recent mission in Switzerland, they wanted to know about the wedding.
“That sounds perfect,” Pepper said straight-faced, “If you order one on Amazon you should get it on time.”
Tony could distinctively hear Steve turning and talking to Peter in the background. “That’s umm,” he coughed, trying to clear his throat. “that’s amazing.”
The God of Thunder, with the help of Natasha, unwrapped the gifts and Tony saw that Thor got Peter a train set.
“I’ll text Clint,” Tony said as he pulled his phone out of his back pocket and started typing against the small screen.
Tony’s throat burned as the fiery liquid from the glass bottle in hands darted down his throat. He knew he shouldn’t be drinking. He’d been sober for almost a year now. But today was different.
All eyes in the room were trained on him with heavy stairs. None of the guns lowered until the man in charge held up a hand, and the rest backed off. “Stark,” he said, his voice dripping with annoyance.
Bruce had bought a carousel for the overhead of his crib, with miniature Avengers in the center of it.
“Speaking of Steve,” Pepper said while taking a sip of her chardonnay, “what did you get him for Christmas?”
hard. I teamed up with the Guardians for as much Black Order info as I could get. And then I spent some time with the folks in Asgard's gang to dig up dirt on some other people. As for Hydra, well, let’s just say that you, Captain, aren’t the only mob boss who I got into bed with.”  At the appalled look on the Captain's face, Tony clarified. “Not Peirce, you dumbass. I slept with some of the other heads. Grant Ward, Hale, Bakshi. But Strucker I never slept with. He creeped me out so I drugged him instead and he squealed like a pig. Of course, there were also a couple of other unknowing informants.” He cocked his head behind him, “Rumlow over there. He didn’t tell me anything that he thought was secretive, but he didn’t know that the information he gave me tied together all the pieces I needed. And the Ten Rings? Well, that shit was just too easy. Once I knew where to look, I got everything I needed.”
“Are you just going to tell her or are you going to give her something. If you want, we could make her cookies? Or you could make her a homemade card? I bet Gwen would really like that.”
“I think I’ve been in love with you since you shot down Rumlow to save me.” He admitted, letting his hands rest on Tony’s waist. “The way you carried yourself that night, confident, unafraid of anything. And the fact that you outsmarted all of us by placing a tracker in your book… it completely blew my mind. At first, everyone was telling me not to pursue this. It was too dangerous. You were a civilian, you were in the public eye, and you would distract me. Part of the reason why I kept putting you on missions was to prove your usefulness to the team. If they thought that you were resourceful instead of just distracting, then they would have a better time warming up to you. And it seemed to work. The Hulk seems to like talking to you more than most of us, and Hawkeye asked me what he should get you for your birthday, even though it’s not for another month… So far Winter Soldier needed to most convincing, but Tony, love, you are part of the family. You earned you spot one hundred times over. And every day I thank whoever's listening that I ignored my stupid friends and we pursued this… It’s just that since that night in the warehouse... I knew that I needed you in my life. I wanted to know more.
“Why’d I make it? Well gorgeous, you’re gonna have to buy me a lot of drinks before you get those answers. But how? Well it wasn’t
“He was good. Kinda overwhelmed though. Next time I suggest you don’t have seven different people babysit at the same time. I think the max should be three.”
Natasha opened her eyes and stared down at Sam from the couch opposite of her, “Well at least I didn’t make him cry”
Tony watched as ‘Clyde’s’ smile slowly slipped off his face while his expression morphed into one of curiosity. “Why do you do it? If you don’t do anything with robbed items, why do you keep doing it? And, if you always use the same tactics, how do you never get caught?”
Once Karen Page brought that innocent topic to light, the media couldn't get enough of it. Tony was constantly hounded by reporters, but the number one question he would be asked was, ‘Are you dating anyone?’ Tony would always laugh and smirk towards the camera and say “I'm dating America, it's my day job” or “Who has time to date? I'm too busy riding the American dream” or he’d refuse to comment.
‘Clyde’, ever the apparent boy scout, had already prepared for this scenario and hid a bottle of lube along with condoms in the car. Spreading him open wasn’t the easiest fit, but soon Cap was pushing inside him, and Tony couldn’t find himself able to care about their current location.
The elevator pinged and the doors opened revealing all the Avengers and Pepper, all anxiously waiting to meet Peter.
“Hey,” Tony placed both his hands against Steve's shoulders in an attempt to calm him down. “Watch your language. I was only joking. Peter didn’t forget about us. Okay?”
He thinks about Steve's laugh. The light airy chuckle he made when he was embarrassed. The way he tries to hide behind the rosy blush that forms on his cheeks. Or the way he grabbed at his chest when he produced a lively and vivacious laugh that seemed to echo around him.
Disgust spread across his face as he looked at the dead body laying ten feet away from him. It’s open, unresponsive green eyes stared into brown ones. Forcing himself to look away, he waited for the fight to die down. Watching as blood splattered on the floor, bodies dropping, and--  yuck… was that brain matter? God, what savages.
Steve looked out the window on his left and watched as the lights from the other cars and buildings turned into blurry dots that quickly passed by. “No! Happy, drive slower!”
“I didn’t have time.” He said simply. “After I realized what it was, I found out the location of one of their warehouses and heard they were making a deal so the Avengers and I thought that we should pay them a visit.”
“To who? Rumlow? I met him a few months back. And yeah, he was fun. He did this thing with his tongue that drove me
Walking around the edges of the building, he looked for any entrance points. The graffiti coated warehouse gleamed in the moonlight. Various lines, squiggles, and streams of profanity covered the surface. Tony would have found some of the artwork to be more amusing if he didn’t have something he needed to do. As he headed towards the back of the building, he walked passed the windows, without even attempting to gain entrance that way. The pieces of boarded-up wood that were supposed to be nailed against the window frame had been ripped off. He looked down at the splintered wood which littered the ground next to an abandoned crowbar.
“But Ned’s parents wanted him to come home. They want to spend time with him too.” Steve reasoned. “If you go over his house, you would have to come back home too. Daddy and I would go crazy if we didn’t get to see you all day.”
“It was amazing! He was bouncing in the ExerSaucer, but he started looking tired so I took him out and laid him on the jungle gym, and last I saw before I went to grab a water from the fridge, he just being transfixed by the plastic hanging monkey. I wasn’t even gone twenty seconds, Tony. Twenty seconds! When I came back, Peter was pushing against his little arms trying to get to where I was standing before. He was trying to follow me.”
Tony turned around when he heard Steve’s muffled laugh behind him. “And to think, I thought you raced over here to see me.”
Steve smiled at the memory of Tony freaking out afterward since Peter had never had a playdate before.
Closing the front door behind him, he left the grand home for the last time, practically running to his car parked down the street.
“Gwen?” Peter asked, trying to ignore the group of girls sitting with Gwen at recess. “Can I talk to you for a minute?”
Tony stared at the paperwork in front of him, no longer sure what he originally had planned for all of it. When his lunch hour started, Tony dashed out of his office and rushed into his car, frantically telling Happy to ‘step-on-it’.
“It’s always you.” He said before carefully turning off the record button and shutting off the helmet.
“Yeah well I wasn’t really planning to spend my Saturday night watching scum get shot and killed in an abandoned warehouse, but here I am. And by the way- abandoned warehouse? Can you get any more typical? Cause I’m getting serious 1930s mobster vibes.”
“Yes,” The two smiled awkwardly at each other before Gwen placed a kiss on Peter’s cheek and turned back towards her friends.
Some people might find it pathetic that Tony still wants Steve. Hell, if it wasn’t Steve he was in love with, then Tony would find himself pathetic. But after all the blood and tears that this relationship cost him, he wouldn’t undo any of it for a second.
Astonishment slipped into the Captain’s voice, as did a little skepticism. “So you don’t feel any remorse for what you just did to him?”
Peter was in the middle of playing with one of the two dozen rattling toys that Sam and Bucky had gotten him when Tony’s phone buzzed.
“Tony, if we don’t slow down then our baby won’t have anyone to adopt him!!” Steve yelled as the car, he and his husband were in, continued to weave in and out of traffic.
Once Tony came back from Siberia, he wasn’t seen leaving the Compound for almost a month. The press and the public didn’t know many details, but they did know that Steve Rogers was a fugitive of the law. So from the very moment that Tony Stark returned to the public eye, he was bombarded with questions surrounding Steve. The press wanted to know every single juicy detail concerning the A-list couple’s breakup. The world wanted to know as much as they could surrounding the destruction of the world mightiest heroes.
Steve ducked down and rubbed their noses together. “Of course I mean it.” he chuckled lightly, “You’re my everything, Tony.”
Bending down, Tony wiped some dust off Rumlows face. “Yeah, he’s the head of Pierce’s personal Strike Team... Sorry about your assessment dude but he’s pretty high up in the ranks and you’re about five years off.” Brushing his hands together, Tony stood up, his knees cracking as he did. “Sorry to break it to you Captain, but if he was here, then Pierce really wants you off his ass.”
“Is this him?” Steve’s voice came out breathy as he stared at the beautiful boy with a surprising amount of chocolate brown curls on top of his head.
Tony and Steve smiled at each other as Peter told a joke that, once again, made no sense, but still pretended to laugh when Peter finished telling it.
“Again, rude,” Tony muttered. “But I get what you mean.” They walked another few blocks in silence before stumbling upon Stark Tower. When they walked in, they were greeted by the security guards before getting in the elevator and heading up to the penthouse. “Do you think Peter remembers us?” Tony wondered while they listened to elevator music from the 40s, which Steve insisted was always played.
“It wasn’t intentional,” Tony protested, “I just didn’t know what to get him, and now I’m out of time.” He picked up a tiny red and blue winter coat off the rack to his left and held it in his hands. He imaged how Peter would look wearing it, strapped in his stroller, as he and Steve took him for a walk in Central Park. Smiling to himself, he placed the tiny jacket in his cart.
Tony felt his heartbreak. The innocent boy sleeping in front of him has already been through so much. Tony may have had issues with his parents, but at least he remembers them. Peter will have no memories of parents. “Does he have any pictures of him with his parents? Anything that will remind him of them?”
Steve had gone last and unwrapped the clothes, new bottles, pacifiers and teething toys he had bought. Steve had already sanitized the pacifiers before wrapping them and placed one in Peters' mouth.
The next picture Nat had taken before the pair had gotten together when they were still skirting around there feelings. Steve had trouble sleeping one night so he came to the communal level of Avengers Tower to watch a movie, apparently, Tony had the same idea and was already there. Steve had made them both hot chocolate and the two talked all night. Neither remembered falling asleep, but they do remember waking up to see Natasha standing over them with a camera. Steve was laying on his back with Tony hanging onto him like a koala while Steve’s arms were securely wrapped around him. Steve still kept that photo in his wallet.
Nebula’s blue face looked happier than he’d ever seen. “Some Ravagers found us. For the right price, they can take you back to Earth and me to Thanos.”
This was definitely one of the reasons Tony was excited for the Avengers to move into the compound upstate. He yearned for the privacy it would provide. But in the meantime, he had to continue to go outside wearing a baseball hat and sunglasses, and avoid the people poking and prodding at his life. Oh well, he could wait another two weeks.
When he walked through the doors, he saw his target already sitting at their table, scanning the menu before him.
The smug smile that spread across the Captain's lips pissed him off. It reminded him of a kid on a basketball team, prematurely gloating about how his team won the game right before the other team made the winning shot. The blonde turned around to look at his crew, all of them, except the red-haired women, were shooting Tony smug grins. The red-haired woman’s eyes were hard as steel and trained on Tony. She openly kept her guard up, while the others appeared slightly more loose, however, Tony was under no impression that all of them still couldn’t kill him within half a second's notice. "Well sorry, hate to break it to you Barbie, but it ain't here."
Tony could distinctly feel someone shaking him. He tried his best to open his eyes, but it seemed to take almost all his energy.
Tony felt numb. Undeniably numb. He's tried for months to ignore the weight pushing down against his chest. To ignore the nagging voice in the back of his mind, targeting his thoughts to travel to a place he didn't want to go.
“Uh huh. And what’s the forecast? Cloudy with a chance of meatballs? Or is it raining cats and dogs?”
Walking into the living room both men were wearing the ridiculous matching pajamas that Tony had gotten them last year. Both pajama bottoms were designed to look like cartoon reindeer legs, while the shirts had the remainder of the reindeer bodies. The tip of the reindeer's nose on Bucky’s shirt was bright red, while the reindeer on Sam’s shirt had a caption on it, depicting the reindeer saying
“Can my friend come over tomorrow?” Peter's chocolate brown eyes widened as he looked towards his dad.
“I have no idea.” He admitted, “He told me that he didn’t want to spoil him too much since he has so many different people giving him presents. “
They weren’t bad people, well… not all of them at least. Carrie was loving and kind, Barbara was an advocate for children’s education. Mike spent his weekends volunteering to save the environment. But they weren’t Steve. Not even close.
Slowly opening the door, he saw Tony on the ground, with his arms securely wrapped around his bent legs which were tucked against his chest.
Tony hasn’t had many conversations with Nebula since leaving Titan together. Although it was obvious to Tony that she was motivated by rage. She wanted to find Thanos and tear him apart, limb by limb. Tony wished that he could share her rage. But instead, he felt… broken. He kept replaying Peter’s death, in his head, over and over again.
As he headed down the hall, ‘Clyde’ was going to approach Justin and distract him from reaching for his phone in his jacket pocket by pretending to be a huge fan.
“Yes, I’ll tell you that it didn’t hurt any less when all I wanted to do was tell you how I felt and you kept running away from me. That whole week I thought you hated me.”
About a month-and-a-half later is when the whole world seemed to freeze. Steve Rogers was exiting a building, about to put on his gloves, due to the bracing, fall weather, when he saw a woman get mugged on the street. A man wearing a black hood over his head pointed a gun at her as he grabbed her purse and ran. Immediately Steve rushed to her aid and stopped the hooded man before he got too far away. While doing this, he gained a lot of attention. Soon a crowd formed around the scene, dozens of people filming everything with there cell phones. Steve had been so busy trying to calm the woman down, once he returned her purse, that he hadn’t realized that he didn’t put his gloves back on. Once he made that realization, he heard a high pitched voice yell, “Look at his hand!”
Last year the two celebrated all day together in bed, wrapped up in each other's warmth. Steve said it was his favorite birthday yet. He also said that he couldn’t wait to see how they would spend it next year…
Tony felt his eyes roll up toward his skull as the Captain’s lips traveled down his jaw and down the scope of his neck. It took all of Tony’s will power to speak up, “If you keep doing that, then you’ll mess up my suit.”
But Tony had an idea. A stupid, most likely pointless idea. With shaking fingers, he reached out and grabbed the mask and placed it in front of him.
“That I had to wait for you to come into the school to pick me up before I left the building.” He muttered.
Tony wasn't sure if this was just some stupid code or if Justin was going to be taking aviation lessons. But either way, he wrote it down and then went to return to the table so Hammer didn't start to wonder where he was.
“Oh my God, please be quiet,” Bucky raised his voice but remained cautious so he wouldn’t wake Peter up. “I’ve had an
The world knew that Tony Stark and Steve Rogers had broken up. So Tony didn’t know why he was hiding from the public eye. He didn’t have anything to be ashamed of… well… regarding the break-up, of course. So finally when one of the hundreds of reporters asked him what happened, he finally gave an answer.
But most importantly, Tony imagined a day where he wouldn’t imagine he was with Steve instead of the person he actually was with.
Clint’s head popped up from the couch and he shifted his body to face Steve and Tony, “Hey guys.” He whispered, “How was your date?”
Steve bent down and wrapped his large arms around Tony’s front. Pressing x amount of kisses all over the sides of his head, wishing he could take away his husband's sadness. “Tony,” he said, turning his face so he could kiss the falling tear, running down the brunettes cheek. “He’ll do it again.”
“Oh God, oh God, oh God,” he muttered, lifting the comforter to cover his face. “Just please get out ‘Clyde’.” He could already feel the tears start to form while he sniffled.
“... but it was actually a banana!” Peter yelled as he almost fell off his chair laughing.  “Can he come over, Papa?”
“-Tony, who are we going to call?” Natasha asked, “I’m pretty sure everyone you know is standing in this room.”
“Noted.” Tony carefully avoided stepping on Rhodney and began walking down the hall. “Steve, can you wake them up?” He waved his hand in Steve’s direction, signaling to their sleeping friends. “I’m gonna check on Peter.” Steve gave Tony a thumbs up, and he began walking towards Peter’s room.
He held the book out and Tony snatched it right away. Tony flipped through the pages, making sure everything was still there, no pages ripped out, no names erased, nothing scribbled in the margins. But it was perfect. Nothing out of place, everything was how he left it. “Thank you,” he said earnestly, raising his head to meet the Captain's eye.
And Tony had to admit, he was surprised with himself for not falling asleep. For a few minutes there, he seriously considered just going to bed, wrapped up in ‘Clydes’ arms instead of robbing him. And forty minutes later, when he got home, he slept like a baby for the rest of the night.
Tony spent the past three hours running up and down 5th avenue with Pepper, trying to find the perfect gift for Peter. They’ve already gone in and out of six different stores, each time coming out empty handed.
“Well… the two of us worked together on the Avengers and we realized that we work best when we are honest with each other so I told him that I thought he had pretty eyes and a nice smile and asked him on a date.”
Peter’s little brown eyes were transfixed on the large Christmas tree in corner of the room. After Steve had somehow, miraculously, transported the ten-foot Christmas tree into the penthouse, Peter has wanted to do nothing but touch it. Tony prayed that next year he wouldn’t have to put a gate around the tree to prevent Peter from trying to from climb it.
“Oh, you want to hear the answer? Well, here you go!” ‘Clyde got off the bed and stalked towards Tony, waiting for him to begin. “Well for starters you don’t fucking trust me! It took months for you to show me where you live! Ninety-nine percent of your life is completely unknown to me. I don’t know who the hell you are or what you think, all I know is that you don’t want me. You… you only want me when I can go on jobs for you and get you your precious info or your ‘priceless’ objects! And when I’m not doing your dirty work, your fucking me! It’s like you don’t even fucking want me for me! You want me for what I can give you!”
"You're brilliant, Barbie." His voice sounded so hoarse and all of Tony's blood traveled to his dick. "I could barely stay in my seat all night. Seeing you flirting with him, with that cockroach, all I wanted to do was take you right there, on the table."
After hiding in Avengers Compound for over a week, the pair finally agreed to verify their relationship for the world.
he thought. After Peter continued to badger his parents for a playdate with his new friend, Steve's husband called the boy's parents and they arranged a playdate within the next week.
“It’s very nice to meet you, Ned.” Tony smiled, shaking Ned’s hand. “So what have you two been up to?”
The Captain absentmindedly nodded his head as he listened to Tony’s words. Once it was clear that Tony was done speaking, he turned to his brown-haired friend who Tony dubbed ‘Guard Dog #1’ in his head. The two seemed to be having a silent conversation that Guard Dog #1 wasn’t happy with. When the Captain turned to the rest of his team, GD#1 turned to Tony.
After a few hours, the pair were heartbroken that they couldn’t take Peter home immediately. But first they needed to have there home checked out by the state and they needed to have their lawyers present while they signed the adoption papers. But in about a week, Steve and Tony were sitting the backseat of their car with Peter strapped in a car seat between them. They watched as Peter played with the stuffed animal in his lap while the car drove extremely slowly down the busy streets of Manhattan.
“I can’t help it, Steve. It’s happening! We’re getting a kid!” Tony couldn’t keep the smile off of his face.
“You know,” Steve paused, swallowing his food, “For years you raved about the Italian food in this restaurant, and you bought pizza. You know that you can get that anywhere else in the city for a fraction of the price, right?”
He remembers the way Steves lips would attach to his own. He remembers that the first time Steve had done that, it was in celebration. The faintest peck on his lips, in front of everyone. Steves' cheeks turned an adorable shade of scarlet and he tried to laugh it off. Tony thought of the way Steves tongue would fight against his own, in there more passionate embraces. He also remembers all the goodbye kisses before either of them went on a mission. The two used to throw their arms around each other and refused to imagine what would happen if the other didn’t come back. They channeled all their emotions into there kiss. Saying goodbye, without saying goodbye.
