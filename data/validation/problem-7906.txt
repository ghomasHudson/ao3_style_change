“Right!” He hurries towards the girl with the antennas and starts working on her bonds.
Steve chuckles again, watching Tony as he shifts on the couch. “Tony. Trying to get you to stop has been one of the biggest failures of my life.”
The people have been divided into the two sides, but it’s obvious that one the one closest to Hilde is still standing. She clutches at her chest, feeling a strong pain all of the sudden.
But Tony shrugs at that. “I don’t much care at this point.” Give it a little time. The other ones that have gone missing… they’ll find their way back, right? Eventually?
“Are you yawning?” he asks. The two look back at him. “In the middle of this, while I’m breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?”
Tony snaps his fingers, and a white light surrounds them.
“You don’t know that,” he returns.
Hilde chuckles. “No, I should be heading out, anyway. Just wanted to pass along the news.”
When the weapon has sunk right into Thanos’ chest, giving him a fatal wound, Thanos staggers in his stance. His hand is onto the axe, yet he seems to lack the strength to pull it out.
“You can’t move on from losing your son,” Natasha agrees.
“Blue Meanie? She still in on this? I’m impressed.” Together, they walk back inside. There’s this familiarity at being back in the compound, but it’s mostly memories that Tony doesn’t want to think back on. The workshop he’s brought to is the same one he spent days in with Peter back during his internship. He can even still see his workbench on the side, where DUM-E is looking up hopefully, only to lower its head again at the realization that Peter hasn’t arrived. Tony pats the bot once on the back of its neck.
The girl has been quiet over the past few years. According to Hilde, she had been unconscious when Loki disappeared, meaning that she just woke up with half the universe gone. Steve has been trying to keep touch with her, but it hasn’t been easy. After she lost all of her powers, she's been trying to live a normal life that doesn't involve superheroes. Steve can't blame her.
“Or screw it up even worse than he already has, right?”
“So, how are you liking space so far?” Hilde asks Dr. Cho in an attempt to shield off the other conversation behind them.
“Which is exactly why we
Natasha jumps up in surprise. “Wait, he lived in New York?”
They do tell the other Avengers eventually. Of course they do; like Natasha said, they are family. But while not everyone at the funeral is told, the people who
Yeah, no, this group is going to get them all killed. That’s for sure. This is hopeless.
Steve then snorts and pats his shield, currently hanging on its usual spot on his back. “I’ve got all the weapons I need, right here,” he jokes, but it falls flat. He’s aware that with an invasion this probable scale, the shield might just not be enough.
And now he needs a moment. Now Tony needs the couple of seconds he takes to let that information sink in. Because this is their team; this is the group that is supposed to take down a purple giant that so far nobody’s had the success in taking down. This group here might be their only hope at winning this thing.
“Wow,” he breathes out as he turns off the lamp. “3000? That’s crazy. Go to bed, or I’ll sell all your toys. Night night.”
After Strange is out, Tony returns from underneath his moon. He looks pissed off, as well, throwing all he has onto Thanos. Peter should join, help him, but at the same time he has to make sure that no remaining chunks of moon that will hit the unconscious guardians. In the time that he’s distracted with throwing some meteors away, the situation downstairs seem to have gotten to the worst.
They don’t speak. Hilde gestures at her to stay quiet and Yaël listens. Then she gestures towards Thor, Loki and the Hulk, indicating that they need to get them out of here. That’s when Hilde notices something in Yaël’s eyes.
. Yet, as they set course, fully aware that it would probably take them about a month, maybe two to even get there. But that’s alright. They have plenty of stops on their way where they can fuel, restock on their supplies. People of Asgard carry a general amount of wealth, so if everybody puts their stuff together, it would be possible to actually buy something to keep all these mouths fed.
It’s not even two minutes later when he hears Peter’s voice in his ears.
They try to figure out if they can make the van working again. Luckily, with Pym’s daughter aiding Scott, it might just go a little bit faster. Tony decides to trust them to make it work. Upon noticing Strange’s magic in action, he hurries towards him, and quickly faces the wizard.
“In all my years of conquest, violence, slaughter… it was never personal. But I’ll tell you know; what I’m about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet – I’m gonna enjoy it very, very much.”
Howard can answer him. Of course, he can’t. He tries to gesture Maria’s belly with his hands, but even there he seems to be hesitant about the size. How long has it been since he’s been home? “I don’t know. She’s at the point where she can’t stand the sound of my chewing. I guess I’ll be eating dinner in the pantry again.”
Loki quickly turns towards Hilde, suddenly pushing her towards the door.
“That’s him,” Yaël mutters out, taking a step back. There are five figures standing there at the door-opening. The one sticking out the most is the figure in the middle; a hulk-sized, hulk-built character holding up his balled fist. From the back of his hand, a purple light seems to shine.
Thor looks lost, confused. As if he, too, expected a sudden blow that would destroy them all. Except, nothing seems to have happened.
“You know damn well I do,” he hisses towards the sorcerer. Strange doesn’t flinch at all upon that reaction. Then Tony clears his throat. “What I meant was, with the accords being the way they are, I need permission to exit the states with the Quinjet and-“
No way, she can’t be too late already, can she?
Nobody looks at him as the man gets on his feet. He joins the others towards the window. Hilde doesn’t even know this man’s name, but that’s not difficult since she’s not been in Asgard for many, many years.
So they make up the plan. They put in the details, go over everything multiple times to make sure that everybody is on board. Three teams of two, and one of three. They’ve all have their specific goal they have to go through.
“Come on,” she instructs him. It’s good that she’s taking charge. Somebody ought to. Steve gets up, followed by Peter and May. When Peter is on his feet, Morgan reaches out for him and Peter picks her up with ease. He’s surprised at how easy she’s grown attached to him, but he doesn’t mind. He kisses her on the top of the head and then follows Steve and Pepper out.
She doesn’t think they’ll manage to do that.
Tony shrugs. “Yep, we’re all kinds of stubborn,” he retorts.
“Tony, I can’t believe it.” Rather than hugging him, Steve offers Tony the support he needs. He helps him get down the rest of the stairs, and only when they’re on the ground do they stop moving.
“Hilde?” she hears behind her. Hilde turns around and sees Yaël has finally turned around.
Tony’s breath hitches. “Who told you that?” he asks. “I didn’t fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the stone. That’s what happened. There was no fight.”
Wait, that’s not a wreckage. It’s a functional ship?! Another person appears on the scene, holding a sword and facing the purple giant as she tells him something. Peter can’t focus on what she’s saying, but clearly she’s holding a grudge.
So hearing Sam’s voice, clearly intended for Steve, still brings a smile onto Tony’s face. He can see Steve look around in confusion, giving Tony a look once their eyes meets. Tony pulls back his helmet and offers him a smile, to indicate that he heard it as well.
her melons,” Tony says, patting his shoulder. In return he gets a very unimpressed look from his friend. “My point was, though, that things change.”
“I’ve asked it, nicely.”
“As King of Asgard, I do not accept your presence on this ship. Leave at once!” Thor’s loud voice calls out while he walks through the horde of people around them. The Purple man in the front just smirks. The other four creatures around him give their leader a short look before they move forward as well. Thor grabs the first one by the throat, pushing him back without much effort. The other three start pointing their weapons at him instantly.
“I don’t know, it’s not even like it’s something consistent; it’s just some bad feelings. That’s all I can make from it.”
“I said, ‘We’d lose’. You said ‘We’ll do that together, too’. And guess what,
But here they are; she has friends, she has a boyfriend, and she even started college, which she never thought would be possible. Life isn’t
“You’re good to go?” Tony asks, eventually. They all seem to have come to the agreement that the former-Hulk is right. Bruce nods, giving them all a sad smile.
be space around them though he’s not sure at all. It’s kind of hypnotizing to look at for too long.
Tony and Steve look at one another. It’s a short moment where they decide on it together. Steve is the one who speaks up.
“Yeah, one moment I saw all of you in front of me, and the next there was this woman – a beautiful young woman, too. She was dressed in a black dress, standing there as if she’d been waiting for me. Told me it was time to come with her. I tried to tell her I couldn’t leave you or Morgan behind but… dead is dead, you know?”
Time goes on for a little while, yet there’s still no word of any return on Thor’s part. The weather turns colder, the season starts to change into winter. Eventually, Yaël is called away, taken to Switzerland by SHIELD for something called the ‘accords’, whatever that means. Hilde offers to go with her, but she refuses, saying she needs to see this through on her own.
Hilde takes a deep breath. All signs would say that Thor is dead, but she’s seen him in action. Asgardians can take a hit, and they can certainly survive in space without air for a long time – which is why she didn’t have a problem while Yaël was suffocating.
“I’m saying that if we take out the stone there’s still a whole lot of Vision left,” Bruce admits. “Perhaps the best parts.”
“I used to have nothing,” Natasha eventually says. “Well, no, I used to have
And Vision asks her to leave him behind. And the idea hurts more than she could imagine. Obviously, she refuses.
What is he doing?
“No, bull-shit. Where is she?”
Tony hates running. It makes him all sweaty, sticky, and reminds him of just how unfit he is due to the lack of training in the past few weeks. Okay, no, months.
“Ah, yes, we can’t leave the King behind,” Korg agrees. There’s something heavy in his voice Hilde notices immediately.
He’s conflicted in so many ways; all reasonable thought would have been to go back home and get Peter to safety, but by now Tony knows that this is no longer about them; no longer
“Let’s kill him properly this time.”
“Tony… we have to take a stand,” she tells him with a shivering voice. She’s next to Steve, who doesn’t seem so surprised by her emotional outburst. She’s been the most guarded of all of the Avengers, so it’s obvious that eventually, those emotions have to come out.
“Tones?” Rhodey asks the moment he sees it as well. Tony looks up, smiling at his best friend.
“Any luck?” she asks, running up to them to see how far they got.
“Can I come in for a second?” she asks cautiously. Peter nods, sniffing his nose one more time. Pepper closes the door behind her, passes her hand over her vest to straighten it and then she approaches the bed. She seems a bit out of sorts with the room – probably never having seen the inside of it before.
“No, no, no, no! I’m pretty sure I’m… not. It’s just that… I thought the two of you looked good together. For a moment you seemed… happy.”
“Let me tell you. That kid’s not even here yet and there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for him.” Howard steps aside, past Tony. That gives Tony a clear view to Steve, who shoots him a questioning glance. Tony holds up his hands and pokes at his watch, with that also showing off the brief case and the bouquet of flowers he’s still holding.
There’s somebody holding him. Tony slightly tries to fight against it, but it seems stronger than him.
“When did they arrive?” he asks.
Hilde turns the figure even further. Blue skin is the first thing she sees, followed by long, black hair and a familiar uniform.
The woman in the white dress stands up from where she’s seated and approaches Gamora with a friendly expression. Clearly, she’s not in the mood for another argument.
“At least we remember how weak her head is.” Clint pulls back his bow and arrow and kneels down next to the unconscious figure. Her hood has fallen off her head, revealing the rest of her young face. Her hair is dusty and covered with a bit of debris. Feeling a bit of protectiveness over her, Natasha pushes it all aside.
“Not really,” Steve admits, feeling like it would not amount to anything if he would lie. Natasha would read right through it, after all.
She’s busy brushing her hair, having taken a quick shower only a few minutes ago. Seated on the bed, she looks at Vision, standing at the window with his eyes stuck on something outside. She can’t help but smile as she sees him, her whole chest filling with that warm feeling she would never have thought she’d feel again after getting these powers.
He steps away from Wanda, standing where Vision had last been. The tree branch looking scorched from the energy blast it received.
He can see from Wanda’s hunched body further away that the mission was a failure. It’s not her fault, she did all she could.
“Yeah, but my son has seen more movies,” Tony says with a shrug. He calls up a rocket from his shoulder patches and shoots one against the wall, blowing it up. Skinny loses his ground immediately, being sucked into space with the brute force coming from it. As suspected, once Skinny is out, whatever’s holding Strange no longer has him in their grasp. Strange lets out a shout as he, too, is being sucked towards the hole in the wall.
The whole thing lasts long enough. After the meal, they take a rest in the break room.
Through his eyelids, Tony feels light approaching them. With the last of his strength, he re-opens his eyes. Nebula must have walked away and he never even noticed. In confusion, he blinks. For so long, all there was ever to see in space was darkness and constellations far away. Yet, this is stronger, like a sun approaching them.
“This street?”
When Natasha hears him talk, she smiles despite her tears. She’s always happy to see him, that much he knows. It’s never going to stop the tears, but it will curl up her lips at least a tiny little bit. Her hair has grown again; she never really bothered to have it cut after half the world disappeared.
“I need to see it. If Loki’s still… floating around there, somewhere, I need proof.” Yaël’s breath shudders for a moment. Then she lowers her gaze and starts fumbling with her fingers onto her lap. “He deserves a proper burial.”
“Child?” asks Thanos when the alarms don’t stop. He never opens his eyes.
No, he can’t think about it. It’s no use; they’re going to die in space, anyway. Soon enough, he’ll be back with him.
Morgan runs out of the house with her hands now completely dry. She reaches Steve, who immediately goes to pick her up and hold her close. Morgan puts her head onto his shoulder and looks over the two strangers she’s never seen before. Realizing they’re looking back at her, she hides her face away. Tony immediately notices the hurt on Natasha’s face.
Tony blinks. He’s noticed the Raccoon yesterday, but it’s only today that he’s heard him talk. “Honestly, until this exact second, I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.
Steve’s eyes startle open at the sound of loud thunder right next to his ear. He hadn’t even realized that his mind started wandering; had he been knocked out, or did he just take a mental break after the endless hours of fighting?
Tony hadn’t even noticed Peter stepping aside. His son is now behind him, which makes Tony turn around in horror, as he notices the panicked look on the kid’s face. He looks pale, beaten and tired.
Peter nods. “I’m good,” he says, clearly still too excited about being in a spaceship. Tony gives him a long, studying look before he reaches out an arm and pulls Peter close to him, kissing him gently onto his forehead.
In the background, Rhodey is calling out for Sam. Okoye is making panicked sounds. Natasha looks for Clint.
Next it’s Drax who talks. “What does this monster have to mourn?”
It’s obvious that Nebula never had a normal childhood. She never played games in her life before. She never even understood what a game stood for. With trouble, she admitted to having fun after that first session, and she’s been wanting to play more games after that.
By the time Steve is upstairs, Bruce is already standing next to Vision, in front of Shuri. She’s scanning the synthezoid with her beads. Kimoyo beads, Natasha whispers towards him when he gives it a questioning look.
“And I want you to thank him now,” Tony snaps back, pointing at Peter, who just looks confused at the mention. “Go ahead, he’s listening.”
Tony looks down, a hint of sadness going through his eye before it disappears again, replaced by relief. “Small price to pay for getting you back,” he admits. “Though I would not suggest anybody else playing with that gauntlet.”
Tony stills. He lets out a loud breath and looks over his daughter. She doesn’t seem to know what kind of reaction she just pulled out of him. How could she? She’s only four!
Eventually, Peter comes back to his senses. He moves his mask back on and sees Thanos chase his Dad away with an massive array of fire. Jumping into action, Peter swings up, webs up Thanos’ fist to stop him from closing it again, but he’s once again thrown aside. At least he offered enough distraction for another piece of wreckage to plow itself onto Thanos.
But there’s just this one last mission. That’s what he tells himself; but as long as he has this suit… there’ll never be a
“You will be happy, too,” Steve admits to her as they dance. With one hand on her back he steps from left to right, feeling like that smile is permanently stuck on his face. “I’ve met your family. They’re all incredible people.”
“Call him,” Bruce urges on. Tony sighs, lifting up a hand towards his brow. If he calls Steve, it means that this all, this big danger that is hanging over them, it’s real… “Listen to me, Tony. Thor’s gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn’t matter if you interrupt Bucky-time.”
Steve smiles, just shortly. That is, until he must notice the crestfallen look on Tony’s face, instead.
Yaël turns her head in her direction, blinking once and opening her mouth before stopping and then closing it again. It seems like that was a good question, as she’s giving it a bit of thought.
“There’s something I need your opinion on,” Tony says, though he’s not too sure how he’s going to put it into words. “Do you know that kind of dream where you think you have to pee, and then you wake up-“
The knife he stabbed her with was the very same knife he offered her the day he took her.
“But it just
Oh, he just hopes that Strange isn’t doing stupid things.
“Hey, do you ever miss it? Your powers?” It’s a question that suddenly comes to mind. Yaël has never really expressed her sadness for the loss of it, but the woman by herself is quite the mysterious entity that Hilde thinks she can never truly unravel.
“You’ll never get this chance again,” the female returns in an equally murderous voice. After that, they disappear into a blue light. They don’t wait for too long, though. Instantly, the three of them walk up to Wanda and Vision, Natasha putting away her batons while Steve hanging shaking his hands nervously. Why wasn’t he using his shield? And what is that uniform? It looks only slightly like his original one, but… it looks old, withered. It must probably be an old one he had lying around in the jet. The suit Natasha’s wearing is also not the one she’s usually sporting, and Sam’s wings looked different as well.
“Please tell me you didn’t meet some old ghosts from the past?” Tony asks him. He hurries inside the little cabin full of supplies, and Steve follows right after him. They close the door, and wait for a little second.
“I just… I need to concentrate here for one second,” Bruce returns. Huh, Tony wouldn’t have expected
“Don’t-“
Natasha turns her head so fast that her hair whips along with it. “Vision, get your ass back on the table.”
That’s strange. Peter sneaks a peek, finding that the Wizard seems wounded and tired as well. “Spare his life… and I will give you the stone.”
Steve snorts. “You did. I couldn’t stop them from experimenting before you arrived.”
“Really?” Thor swings his axe at the right time, and Steve also smashes his shield in three different creatures.
“Please, try and find him.”
in fact been at the funeral. He just hadn’t been at her side; how could he if the man had died because of him after all?
“I don’t want to do this,” Peter admits. “I don’t think I can…”
“To what do I owe this pleasure?” Tony asks, crossing his arms when he sees Strange there in that ridiculous outfit – seriously, out of all the superhero costumes he chose that? The dude looks like a hippie.
“This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta move at the same time.”
“Right?”
“We don’t trade lives, Captain.”
Wanda and Vision run into trouble during their vacation
“She’s got help,” the Wakandan warrior adds to that. Hilde finally returns on her flying horse, winking at him while Pepper returns. Mantis, Natasha, Shuri and another woman dressed in a suit similar to Ant-Man’s seem to have joined the scene, as well as that blue lady from back in space and another green-skinned lady Peter has a big suspicion might be Gamora. Right now, it’s a big barrier of extremely powerful women standing between him and the army, and it’s clear they’re not about to let them win.
Gamora faces the consequences of her choices.
“You know Thor?!” he asks excitedly. So he
There’s Aunt Sharon, who also doesn’t seem to have aged a day, as well as Bruce, Thor, Clint and Natasha. As for the other Avengers, Peter isn’t too sure about that. They probably reserved this thing for the closest family members, and while the Avengers have always been a good team, the newest additions must probably not be considered as family. Peter can understand that.
By the time she’s finished Coulson leans towards the table, pressing onto a button of a device Hilde hadn’t even seen before. It looks like some primitive recording machine.
But it’s obvious. He made her strong, but not too strong. She could never overshadow him. He made sure of that.
“I want to protect the stone.”
“Thor, you don’t know Thanos like we do,” Yaël starts to explain. “He manipulated us into working for him. He brainwashed me, took away my free will and made me cause destruction all over New York.”
Tony barely realizes he’s thrown onto the ground until he sees a red-and-blue flash appear in front of him. His heart skips a beat, but not in the good way, when he sees his own goddamn son standing there, holding that axe that was about to crush Tony into a pile of goo.
“Yeah, I heard you,” Tony says. He bites his lower lip, holding his hands together while looking to the side, avoiding Strange’s stare purposely. Instead, he looks at Peter, hating himself for this with every second more. “I’m not sure we should.”
“BRING ME THANOS!” Thor sounds the same way he always does, but at this point it’s clear that he’s more pissed off than he’s ever been before. Thor charges towards a horde of creatures, followed by the raccoon holding a weapon and a… tree-person? Steve decides not to ask questions about the Asgardian’s companions.
Besides, Tony’s figure is already covered in so many scars, a few layers of fat won’t change a thing to that.
Cared…
“This thing on?” he asks after tapping the helmet with a sigh. The thing scans him with the last remaining bit of power it has. Tony has to gasp for breath, but it’s getting harder and harder. “Hey Mr. Rogers… Steve. If you find this recording, don’t post it on social media. It’s going to be a real tear-jerker.”
TW: At multiple occasions, Tony is going to admit that he's lost the will to live. It's not exactly suicidal tendencies, but it's more like he's tired of life and wouldn't mind to just die. In a couple occasions, he does get the idea to stop the things that are keeping him alive, but he never goes through with it because in the end he realizes that his reason to stay alive is Steve.
“How do we know you will?” wonders Steve out loud. Bruce sighs again.
“Will you be alright out there?” Dr. Cho asks.
“No. But I know that they’re two badasses accompanied by a powerful magic wizard. And to make it better, they’re three super-geniuses. There won’t be anything they can’t think their way out of.”
“With me, it’s like I can’t stop! The kids want to snack, so I have to snack with them! Had I known before that food on Earth was so good, I would have stayed here much longer!”
It comes with the loud noise of ground being torn apart. Steve and Thor both turn around to find giant drill-like vehicles digging through the earth and making their way through the forcefield.
Pepper admits she finds it scary, but she agrees with Steve; Tony wouldn’t be able to rest, knowing that he never tried
There’s a bit of sparring. She had forgotten how good Yaël had been at it back then, so she takes more than a few surprising punches and Clint seems none the better about it.
That does not sound good. Especially when she turns to her brother, who is standing next to Steve and looks like he has no idea what she’s on about, either.
And, okay, maybe he was too quick with his words; Skinny isn’t exactly more difficult to hit than Big. They’re both equally annoying and fast. Everything Tony throws at him, Big counters with either a shield or his axe. It mostly gets a tree to fall over Bruce rather than actually hurt Big.
Bucky’s missing arm has been replaced with a black, vibranium one. It looks stronger, sturdier. Lacking that red star that only means bad news. His hair has grown much over the months, and he seems to have put half of it in a small ponytail. Or maybe Nat did, Steve has no idea at this point.
Hilde arrives at the wreckage about half an hour after that. By now, it’s pretty much spread out, but most of it remains at the same place. Hilde sighs and sets the spacecraft in rest. It’s time to look around.
Tears form underneath Mantis’ eyes, but she doesn’t pull away. “Be quick, he is very strong.”
“If you want to offer yourself up that badly, you do it after that kid is born!” Hilde points at the swollen belly right in front of her face. “I might call you my friend at this moment, but I know my mission. The mission comes first.”
“Exactly like Footloose!” he says enthusiastically. Peter finally looks back at Tony, confusion obvious in his face. “Is it still the greatest movie in history?”
Steve chuckles. Much like Tony did, Steve leans forward to kiss the top of his head, and then holds him closer to him while he watches the women give it their all.
Tony frowns, wondering for one short second why that name sounds familiar to him until his glasses show him the case file on the man. Right, the big HYDRA baddie that was turned into a computer.
“Your arm…”
“Congratulations,” Tony tells him. Howard hands him over the can and flowers, and then starts straightening his tie. “How far along is she?”
Tony sighs. “Look, it’s not just the fact that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent. I’m telling you, you’re in no condition.”
“Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something and I end up eating you, I’m sorry,” Peter starts, gesturing wildly with his free hand. Tony rolls his eyes, pointing in his son’s direction.
Yaël startles upon hearing her voice. She looks up, turning to where Hilde is standing. Her dark eyes stare back at her, but her expression is hollow. She takes a deep breath.
“In that case, Asgard will have had four different rulers in the span of only two months. I would call that a story to tell the future generations, no?” Thor smiles his teeth bare at his brother, who seems about close to just storm back out and smash his head against the wall.
“It’s all right, you could never hurt me…”
Steve squints to his left side to try and see what’s going on there. Rather than thunder, it seems to be a loud – very loud and powerful – rainbow beam that lands onto the grass. All the creatures that stand too close are swept away by the force of it.
He feels dread wash all over him when, for some reason, a purple blast pushes the woman away from Thanos. Where she went, Peter has no idea. All he sees is Thanos putting the purple stone back in place and letting out a loud growl.
go home, and they can continue on the mission.
The Avengers on Earth try to formulate a plan.
Tony gently looks down, seeing a small smile on Peter’s face. He wonders what the hell the kid is planning.
the man asks. Tony has no idea where he is.
“It’s not fair, it shouldn’t be you. But it is.”
Because his team loves to put things into the garbage disposal, don’t they?
Wanda sees it all happen; everybody starts approaching him. She never looks away from it, even prepares herself for the imminent attack.
“Gotta go,” Steve tells him. He moves into a sprint to join in on the action, and before Peter can say anything else, he’s faced with another Chitauri monster. Letting out an angry shout, Peter shoots his webs at the thing and swings it around and around until he finally releases it. The body disappears in the distance, giving Peter the chance once again to make sure his parents are alright.
“What- what are you- what’s going on?” she asks as she’s obviously getting emotional. Yeah, Steve, great idea. Just show up here to break her heart all over again. Good job.
Peter webs Thanos’ eyes. The best start is always to blind the enemy. The others do the rest, attempting to subdue him with their own individual powers.
one better; Why is Gamora?”
Gathering around on the large platform of the machine, they all give each other a long look. Nobody seems to be wanting to talk, but that’s alright. After all, it’s often
“You think it’s the stone?”
“You like going to the garage, huh?” Tony had noticed it early on. Whenever he was in there, Morgan found a way to sneak in as well and observe whatever her father is doing. He knows she’s interested in building things at well, and at her age he was already working on his engine.
Let him do what he wants. She’s prepared to take it. If he ends her now, at least the pain will be over. Finally.
Tony nods, crossing his arms while he stares Strange down. “And due to that fact, we are now in a flying doughnut, billions of miles from Earth with no back-up.”
“Oh yeah? You don’t wanna tell me where she is? That’s fine, I’ll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself. Starting with you.” The man called Quill is starting to get frantic, speaking too fast. And he’s still holding a weapon to Tony’s son’s head. That really needs to change.
, but it had been taken away from me.
“Good to be back,” Natasha returns with a grin. “Now, let’s get Vision fixed up. Somebody call Helen form medical?”
“And Hela is?”
There’s just the matter of that purple explosion, and Loki’s death. It makes in unclear if Thor would not just… let go…
Steve and the others finally arrived in Wakanda.
“Are there any other options with the Tesseract?” Nat eventually asks as she comes to stand next to Steve. A few locks of her hair have escaped her braid. She looks like she’s been in quite a fight as well. Except they stood victorious.
Tony frowns, wondering what happened with the soul stone. Why did they not go after that? Tony does not recall FRIDAY telling him that the Compound was being attacked. Did they not sense it, then?
Tony retracts the helmet just so he can look around the place with his own to eyes. He can hear the worry in Steve’s voice; the guy must probably be looking at a live feed or something. “
“Yeah, that sounds dangerous enough. And you said she holds a stone?” Hilde asks.
That voice is not in his ear. It’s right next to him. Peter barely manages to notice Steve a bit further away, looking over at him in worry.
“Flash Gordon? By the way, that’s a compliment,” he assures them. “Don’t forget, I’m half human. So that 50% of me that’s stupid?”
There’s excitement there. Natasha is the first one to stand up, immediately going to Tony to wrap her arms around him. Right after that, she directs her happiness towards Steve, who simply lifts her off the ground. Bruce slaps him on the back a couple of times, and the others congratulate them with an excited smile.
She knows the stakes; if they fail, they might lose even more than they already have. But if they win, a lot of people will be reunited with their loved ones. Tony can’t take that away from the universe now, can he?
Tony finds an unpleasant surprise on the flying donut.
“You know what I want, child,” continues Thanos. Gamora can barely focus on his voice; so many sounds come up around her. The black-haired woman with her white dress pushes her onto her back and starts pulling away her upper clothing to check on the wound. Whatever she’s saying, Gamora doesn’t understand.
“My boyfriend prevents me from cutting it off,” Steve jokes. He holds up his hands, as if to ask ‘what can you do about it?’
They take a little break. It’s not like they don’t have the time for it. Excusing themselves, Tony, along with Steve, Natasha, Thor and Clint all head outside and take a little walk at the lake where they can clear their heads for a little bit. They’re all out of the suits, back to their normal clothing.
Heimdall loses all his strength, dropping his arms and his head onto the floor with the weapon stuck in his chest.
“Say, come to think of it. How did we ever catch her the first time around?” asks the woman in confusion. When she wants to think back of it, she comes with no answer at all.
the archer asks, probably while he’s running around.
It’s not going to matter; they have no way out. Their food is running out already.
“Because I probably… won’t be back for a while.”
“And what about afterwards?” Natasha eventually asks once they’ve all separated. “You’re gonna be Iron Man and Captain America, still?”
“Oh, you were actually serious about that?” Strange says. “Though now that you mention it, you do kind of look alike. I mean, you’re both
I don't really want to put too much time into Infinity War, for it is more Endgame that I wish to fix :') That means I'm kind of rushing through IW until we get to the Steve/Tony reunion I can't wait to start writing. Despite the heartbreak.
“Pete, don’t encourage this, alright?” Tony urges on. Peter nods, lowering his gaze as he seems to understand his error. There’s a small ‘Okay’ coming out from him. “We’re getting no help from Flash Gordon here.”
“You’re right,” Steve agrees. He sighs, choosing his words carefully. “Earth just lost her best defender, so we’re here to fight”
He brings Pepper up to date with everything that has happened last day. He doesn’t know why he does it; he just always tells Pepper everything. They’re not in love anymore, but Tony still loves her as his family and he never wants to keep anything from her.
“Maybe you should take Lady Sif with you? With her and Hilde by your side, I feel a lot more confident that you’ll be alright.”
His words are followed by a loud noise. One look over, and Tony feels all hope fleeing from himself. By Thanos’ ship, thousands and thousands of his soldiers have come to join them on the battlefield. Tony recognizes skinny squidward and the big guy from his fight in New York and already dreads having to face those two again.
“Shake it, don’t pull it,” his father jokes, and Tony chuckles nervously with a nod. “You look a little green around the gills there Rogers.”
Steve asks. “
“You okay?” he asks, but she ignores him. Not even looking at him, she starts sprinting away from them as if her life is in serious danger. Tony startles when a car crashes against a pole.
Hilde looks at Loki’s hand as he articulates what he means by snapping his fingers together.
The compounds looks the same as ever when Steve arrives.
She feels her face getting colder the longer she’s out here. Any other race aside from Asgardians would freeze up out here, immediately. But Loki is not Asgardian; he’s a Frost Giant, so the freezing wouldn’t bother him, either. It’s the breathing that Hilde’s worried about.
“She needs to leave. We have to get her out of here,” Loki then says, suddenly sprinting back the way Hilde came from. He leaves her and Thor staring at him as his green cape moves with the air. By the time Hilde and Thor decide to follow him, he’s already out of the hallway.
“Hah, yeah we do.” Tony gives him a short glare as Natasha an Clint both get out of the car. Tony quickly follows after them.
“Aren’t you coming with us?” Korg then asks, pulling out his weapon and opening it with a dramatic move. It’s painfully obvious how Miek is missing next to him.
“Nah, nah, here’s my point. You know what?”
“So, uh, you probably knew I’ve been visiting Strange lately to get the Hulk’s memories back about what happened on that ship, right?” Bruce starts, scratching his hair.
Oh lord, let this be over. Let him just be home. Let Steve be with him, let them have a movie night, Peter safe on Earth. No invasion, no purple maniac off to destroy the world….
“We don’t. But the radiation’s mostly gamma. It’s like… I was made for this.” Bruce picks it up into his hands, but at long as he’s not actively using it, it doesn’t seem to bother him just yet.
“Hey, husband,” he greets him. Tony smiles.
“I will,” she assures him.
For a little while, that is.
,” Ross returns, eyeing him down with an obvious unimpressive look in his gaze. “
They work well like this together. Thinking out loud, they often manage to finish each other’s thought patterns, and thus helping each other to figure things out even quicker. After scanning the bunker Steve’s looking at, Tony follows the heat-signatures and finds that they’re going down an elevator. Steve knows this place well, it seems.
Hilde blinks. Words escape her after that. She can’t promise her anything, obviously. But how good would it be if she were to find either Thor or Loki out here? The chances of them being alive aren’t all that big, but if the explosion didn’t get to them, they might actually have a chance.
Seeing New York in this chaos again, Natasha feels a new wave of guilt. The thought that they brought so much destruction to this city, again and again… And she knows it’s not even her fault, but that won’t stop her from feeling guilty.
Vision smiles when he feels the first cracks in the stone. Wanda can’t stop now, no matter how much she wishes she could.
“So, did you sleep well?” Pepper asks all of the sudden. Tony rolls his eyes.
“Trickster, what’s going on?” she demands, startling almost everybody.
“Of course.” Hilde picks up her tools and continues tinkering with the ship. “You have an hour. Tell the others.”
Morgan chuckles in amusement while she takes her father’s hand into her small ones. “That’s a horrible story. I wanna hear a story about my brother.”
“You know I do.”
He would love to be there during their childhood, be the father he hadn’t been able to be to Peter due to the lack of knowing he even existed.
Looking as if her face is starting to freeze over, Yaël closes her eyes before Hilde can pull her closer. They don’t have much time! Hilde takes another look at the other part of the ship; the one Thor’s still on. Just for a second, she gets to see it, until it’s replaced by a bright purple light, a force hitting her right in the face. It’s a heat, purple flames, loose pieces of the ship. The explosion pushes the whole ship back, making it almost impossible for Hilde to hold on to the girl.
.” Tony has no idea what’s going on, but he’s sure Scott will figure it out. “
The human doctor remained quiet and refrained the entire ascension to space. She’s installed her necessary medical supplies and keeps a tight watch on Yaël. Especially after she started to feel something about an hour ago.
Oh, he likes trying out new stuff on bad guys. It doesn’t take too long to throw Big onto Skinny, though the latter just simply swings his right hand to the side and barely avoids him with some weird telekinesis-shit.
So Tony suits up as well. Once the biggest chunk of the battle is over, they make their way to the tower.
Tony licks his lips as he speaks. His right eye looks glassy, like he’s blind from there as well. He looks so beat down, like he’s about to collapse at any moment.
“Yes?”
“I think I wouldn’t mind being normal,” she then says. “Back on my planet I didn’t have powers and that was considered bad back there. Then when I get my powers I come to a planet where it’s almost a crime to
As Natasha speaks, the faces of known enhanced people appear on the screen. Sam Wilson, Sharon Carter, Scott Lang, Wanda Maximoff, Bucky Barnes… it goes on and on. But when he sees Peter’s face in front of him, he lowers his gaze and shields his eyes away. Steve notices immediately and puts his hand onto Tony’s shoulder.
How can this be? Nothing can stab Vision, he’s made out of vibranium, isn’t he? Many thoughts pass Wanda’s mind, and she can’t really calm her brain down. Finally, she seems to realize what exactly is the problem with them not bringing along any form of communication.
“It’s too late,” she says. Loki shudders.
That’s when he returns to his helmet, which is the last part of his suit that remained. He knows that, right now, he looks horrible. That’s what the lack of food does to one.
he starts. Hearing his voice aches more than Peter could have imagined. “
“Come, God of Thunder. After this, you can take the longest nap you can think of.”
It had been Hilde’s idea to return back to New Asgard. She’s aware that Yaël likes being around her friends in New York, but at least here she can keep a better eye on her. The people also like the idea that she’s closer to them now.
Yaël glares ahead once again, squeezing her own arms that are wrapped around her knees. Her lips are pressed into a thin line.
“The most important thing is that everybody’s alive,” she says.
“I think it gratuitous, but whatever.”
“You always were a cuddler in your sleep,” Pepper jokes. Tony throws her a glare, but she ignores it.
“That was a mistake,” they hear him say right before Heimdall is stabbed through the chest. They can hear Thor scream in anguish, the sound of it hitting Hilde right in the heart. She knows how good friends the two of them were. She just wishes that, after everything, Thor wouldn’t have to lose another person he holds dear.
Tony turns to Carol – he’s been introduced to her earlier. She’s the one who saved him from space. No longer in her suit, she looks normal, almost. Were it not for that hard look in her eyes as she tries to stay out of the whole ordeal.
Drax now seems confused. “I stopped listening after you said ‘we need a plan’.” He admits, though obviously not feeling any guilt for that.
After they’ve all assigned their roles, Tony passes his hand through Peter’s hair and puts the mask back on.
Tony shuts him up by pulling him forward by his collar and kissing his lips, softly. Steve makes a surprised sound at that, but he quickly leans back into it, despite both of them being aware that their clock is ticking.
“But would you be able to rest? Knowing that you’ve found a way to bring Peter back, but never using it?”
“Gamora.”
Happy, Rhodey, Steve, May and Peter follow her back inside. Peter shakes some people’s hands when he passes them. He’s grateful that they came. His friends come to hug him tightly.
Steve walks to the portal. He looks down at the suit; it’s been a part of him for so long. Maybe even too long. Seeing the blue, red, the white. The star… it doesn’t feel right anymore. Doesn’t feel like it should belong to him now.
Thor turns back at him, but he doesn’t seem angry. No, instead he seems to agree with him. “Lightning,” he tries again, but it’s no avail. Nobody is going to let him do it.
“You saw what those stones did to Thanos. It almost killed him. None of you could survive.” He’s now standing in front of the gauntlet. Nobody stopped him from reaching it.
They haven’t told each other the words, and if she’s completely honest she’s a bit scared to do so. Scared that if she says it, he’ll be gone, too. Like Pietro. Like her parents.
“And… how are you?” Tony knows he must be bothered about it, but he finds Steve shrugging, eventually.
Peter’s face falls, understanding suddenly showing up in his expression.
But even as she goes through his head, even as she tries to get into the stone and find out why it’s suddenly acting the way it does, she can’t get anything from it, other than the warmth and coziness coming from Vision himself.
“Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?” Suddenly, there’s a slap on his arm and Tony loses his balance. He turns around immediately, finding the three men looking at him with those serious, troubled eyes. Tony doesn’t like this one bit.
“Don’t act like you don’t know,” Tony mutters back. “Of course, I didn’t sleep well. The bed is so cold.”
bit normal.
“Hey, you,” she greets him.
Peter is quiet, and so is Morgan. She looks around once they’re outside, people standing in their garden that she doesn’t know. And Peter is glad to see all of them. Some he wouldn’t even have expected to have stayed. It’s good to know that there are so many people around here that care about Tony.
Steve looks hurt. He stops in his tracks and takes a shaky breath. The others don’t respond.
And, indeed, he’s right only a couple of seconds later when Sam passes along another message.
There are people crying, children in tears upon looking at their slaughtered families. Hilde even notices a few people she came to befriend during their travels. Her eyes start tearing up, but she doesn’t let it stop her.
“Wait, wait, Thor, just wait. We haven’t decided who’s gonna put that on, yet,” Steve tells him.
“And don’t worry if it doesn’t pan out. I’m just kinda…” Tony stops talking as he puts a piece of candy in his mouth and starts chewing it, instead. He feels that he’s getting tired, and he shouldn’t be spending much more time on this. It’s going to hurt him, again, if he starts hoping.
“Pepp, last night I had a dream-“
, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that area.”
“You know what I need? I need my son back. Because this,” Tony lifts up his arm and starts pulling out his IV before Rhodey can stop him, “this is good and all, but there’s no use for me still being there if my son isn’t.”
“We’re all here for you, pal,” Johnny assures him. He pulls him into his arms to give him a strong hug. Eventually the others join, making it a sudden group hug that almost suffocates Peter.
Tony follows the source of the voice, getting to the guy battling said blanket. As soon as he’s put his foot onto his torso and aims his flight stabilizer at his head, the cloak finally pulls away.
Of course, he drinks it. They both do. Except Nebula is the one who makes sure Tony doesn’t choke in his own puke afterwards. That night, all Tony does is cry out for his son. For Peter.
“Not if we do this right,” he says. He turns around and looks back down, and full of excitement he starts giving Tony his plan. Tony listens, adding a few suggestions of his own. When he asks if the magic cape is listening as well, the thing just makes some weird gesture that Tony kind of interprets as ‘fuck you’, though he’ll never know for sure.
It’s like no time has passed at all. One moment, Thanos was here to get the stone, the next, Steve sees him disappear while standing right in front of Thor.
“Let’s do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let’s go!” Now Tony extends his nanotech cannon until it’s right into his face.
“I can’t,” Tony returns, though he can feel the connection losing. He takes a shaky breath. “I love you.”
Tony must have passed out after that. Everything gets dark, and by the time he’s awakened by Nebula, he realizes that he’s seeing a familiar sight out of the window.
“So these guys, we’re to assume that they’re coming back, right?” Rhodey asks the moment he gets in.
They stay silent after that. Just enjoying the music as they resume what’s left of their much-expected dance.
“No. I have a family back home now. Tony, our son Peter and our daughter Morgan. I… I love them, and I should go back to them.”
“It’s almost like old times now, isn’t it?” Natasha jokes after a little while. She’s sitting on one of the benches near the lakeside, eyeing the water with an excited expression. Next to her, Bruce looks like he’s taking in the sun for a moment.
“We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don’t wanna dance with this guy; we just want the gauntlet.”
“The baby’s coming.”
“How’s it feel?” he asks. Sam just looks conflicted.
T’Challa and Okoye move out with the message that they’ll hold them off. Along with the guards, they exit the room and head outside. Steve looks over at Wanda, who’s large eyes look even bigger staring at the scene unfolding in front of them. It seems like she’s uncertain whether she should help outside, or if she should stay here with Vision.
Quill starts walking around, eyeing the thing carefully. “What the Hell happened to this planet? It’s eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.”
Feeling relatively safe behind them, Peter sits down on the ground to catch his breath for a bit. He’s quickly approached by Steve, who kneels down next to him and pulls him into a hug as well.
Loki sounds urgent, agitated. Hilde can’t remember ever seeing him like this, but it’s not like she’s known him for that long, either. When she turns towards Thor, she finds him equally perplexed by his brother’s behavior.
The whole scene gets interrupted when, through the debris of the compound, Scott emerges a couple of size larger than should be. In his hands, he holds on to Bruce, Rocket and Rhodey as he’s saved them from being drowned.
Steve should make this easier for her. “Wanda. As soon as the stone’s out of his head… you blow it to hell.”
Is this guy really from Earth?
“I just want my son back,” he cries out before he realizes it. He can feel Steve’s breath shivering before he’s being held as well. “I held him in my arms. He was crying for me. Crying for help. And I couldn’t help him.”
Gamora
He knows Tony isn’t happy that Peter followed him here, but Peter would never leave him alone. Even if this is all a suicide mission, Peter won’t let him die alone. Not that Tony’s going to die. That can’t happen.
“Okay,” the girl agrees.
history,” Tony adds. “So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.”
They kiss softly, yet still intimately. And while eventually they’ll have to pull back, it feels timeless.
He isn’t sure how she’s going to react, but still he dares himself to knock on her door. Waiting for her to open up, he wonders how different he looks now. He’s older, that much he knows. There’s even grey starting to show in his hair, though others often tell him he’s only imagining that.
Scott is annoyed with him. And maybe he’s right to do so. Tony had completely forgotten about the Hulk’s reaction for being forced to take the stairs. He isn’t the youngest anymore! It’s only human for him to forget these little things!
“Besides, the purple asshole can’t sense the stone even if it’s right next to him,” Hilde adds as she grins widely.
And then Loki’s eyes find theirs for a short moment. Not too long, just a few seconds. Not enough for Thanos to think there’s somebody behind him. Yaël is shaking next to her, and Hilde immediately throws her arm over the girl’s shoulder.
“Not exactly,” returns Steve.
Tony looks at Peter, remembering that particular movie-night indeed. He gives Peter a nod.
“Bad?”
“I should have left you on Earth…” he mumbles.
It’s not that much use, as Tony has to step out earlier than they do. Tony wishes him good luck, saying his goodbyes as if he was talking to another colleague. After that, he leaves the two of them in the elevator. Tony hopes Steve isn’t going to expose himself.
When he finally feels the gauntlet slipping off, Peter feels a moment of glee. “It’s coming! It’s coming! It’s coming!”
to have me. Though, I’m not too sure about that now. Besides, looking back, he did occasionally drop the odd pearl.”
When he wakes up, Pepper is next to him. She looks tired, but not close to head back to sleep. By the time she realizes her friend to be awake, she puts down her book and sighs sadly at him.
The third person – a large man with a skin made of rock – shakes his head and gestures for them to follow him. “We were already on a search mission.”
Trying to stop them from going, neither of the two are listening. They hand the staff back to Scott, who gives it a bewildered look.
He’s being pushed by his best friend, but he’s not done. Not by a long shot.
It takes a couple of days, but eventually the group is reunited. At least, a part of the group is. While Thor agreed to come along, Hilde decided to stay back in New Asgard to guard over the Asgardian royal heirs. Even now, it’s still her primary mission that she’s not letting go of.
“FRIDAY, evac anyone south of 43
“I stand corrected,” Natasha admits while jumping behind a car and raising her gun. It won’t hurt her. The point is to knock her down, rather than hurt her. If possible, simply make her overexert herself.
Tony taps Strange on the chest before he turns away towards Peter’s direction. The teenager is looking at him like he’s expecting orders, his face excited and nervous at the same time. Tony just wishes he had that youth again, that lack of worry and fears chasing him all the time.
Tony chuckles bitterly. “Nah, you’re only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.”
Gamora is put in front of a hard choice.
“If I might interject,” Loki suddenly says, no longer paying attention towards Hilde nor Yaël. Thor, meanwhile, is still breathing heavily, his shoulders shaking, as he’s lying on the ground. “If you’re going
“He’s here,” is all he whispers. “He’s here. He’s come to get it.”
“I’m not from Earth, I’m from Missouri,” Quill answers.
Barely a couple of minutes have passed since Thanos left them. Is it possible he got the last stone in just that little time?
Almost immediately, Bruce drops down on the ground. Light emerges from the glove, moving up all over his arm as the power surge starts overwhelming him. He’s actually grunting in pain, unable to move for a moment.
After that, there’s nothing.
Hilde is aware that they’ve been lucky, though the term ‘lucky’ doesn’t exactly seems to cut it in this situation. Not only is Asgard destroyed and they’ve all lost their homes, but it’s obvious now that close to half of the remaining Asgardian population has been brutally massacred by Thanos and his children.
That’s what Thor would have wanted, after all.
Noticing that Peter’s not about to attack him, Thanos keeps his guard down. He barely even looks at him, instead just staring at Tony.
“I’m sure you did your best,” says Shuri with a fake encouraging tone. That smirk is still on her face, but it’s not to be found on Wanda’s, who is still holding on to Vision’s hand and looks nothing but worried. Her long brown hair has been put up in a ponytail as well – to keep it out of her face in case of a fight.
Steve
“As much as possible,” Helen tries. “Thank you so much for helping us.”
“At least, let’s hope he’s not expecting it. So, I say we take the fight to him, Doctor. Do you concur?”
, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?” And why won’t he let go of Peter when Tony has clearly lowered his own weapon?
do is have both their brains work together to figure out how to get the wizard free.
She supposes she should be grateful that the Avengers were there to take her in, even if, indirectly, the Avengers are the reason why she doesn’t have a brother anymore.
“I don’t wanna hear another single pop culture reference out of you for the rest of the trip, you understand?”
It needs to stop now, but she’s not that powerful. She doesn’t think she is. Wanda thinks she’s pretty much gained control of her powers, but she’s sure that there’s more for her to discover.
“Talk to me, Banner,” Tony adds. That usually works with him. And indeed, Bruce seems to calm down for a bit. The sleeve of his arm is completely burning away, and it seems to be affecting his skin as well.
years since he sent an army to New York, and now he’s back!” Tony takes a shaky breath, feeling his entire body tense up even more than it already was. Is he actually almost screaming in Strange’s face? “And I don’t know what to do, so I’m not sure if it’s a better plan to fight him on our own turf or his, but you saw what they did. What they can do.”
They know better now. It’s been many years, and they’ve trained well together. Natasha knows the girl’s weaknesses, though the biggest ones are her own powers. So, this time, before the 2012 version of Yaël can even start to look for the past Natasha and Clint, the original two jump her and drive her away from the current battle.
Steve nods. While he hasn’t had much contact with the Fantastic Four lately, it surely does feel like a blessing that they’re out there, right now. Still, their help here might have been a big help, as well.
Eventually Sam breathes out and sniffs. “Thank you. I’ll do my best.”
She says her goodbye, pats Raido on the head once and heads out. In her mind, she wonders what Thor is doing all the way back with the Avengers. One part of her wonders if she should have gone and help them, but on the other hand… no, her mission is here. There’s four little people that she needs to protect. And the current Queen of Asgard. No, she couldn’t have left, even if she wanted to.
“I just… fell you.”
“Angry, mostly. They had been at the park going for a jog when Strange intercepted them and took Tony along, according to her. She was here yesterday after the ship flew off again but eventually had to return back home.”
what will happen if we fail –
Hilde thinks of her mission and makes some decisions.
“Bruciebear, nobody likes watermelon-flavor, you’re just
Tony smiles. “Peter. And Morgan. They’re both the world to me.”
The thing is still going up. The sky above them is no longer looking the usual blue, instead turning into a darker color. And Peter’s still up there.
“Pete, you gotta let go, I’ll catch you.”
Loki has finally left his lover’s side. He’s wandering around in the escape pod, rocking his newborn child back and forth while singing him a soft, Asgardian lullaby that Hilde hasn’t heard in many years. She has yet to ask for the heir’s name, but that’s a matter for later.
Jane is doing just fine, probably with the help of Korg and Miek. They’re really dedicated in helping the woman raising her children in Thor’s absence, but Hilde quickly realizes that they’re probably a lost case as well as the father is.
“We do.” Steve leans forward to kiss Tony on his forehead. “Now, let’s head back to the others and get our son back.”
And seeing Yaël at this celebration she sees that it’s good for her to be among friends. It seems like she’s a bit more at peace with Loki’s end.
“You don’t know if there would have been a fight,” Tony interjects. Peter shrugs.
have to shield yourself from people.”
Immediately after that, Thor joins his Dad as well. Peter feels excited immediately, though he also notices that Thor isn’t looking much like he used to back on the news reels. Did he… gain some weight? Not that there’s anything wrong with that, obviously!
Tony glances back down. “You’re small, but you’re talking loud.”
“I can understand that.”
“Did it work?” asks Bruce while holding on to Steve’s arm. Thor is at his side in an instant.
“What’s the matter?” she asks once she’s reached them.
“I’m looking for Dr. Zola. Have you seen him?”
When she sits down on the bed next to him she faces him with sad eyes.
It’s by far not the only picture of Peter. There are plenty of them around here. Lately, Tony has been having the habit of looking away from them, out of fear to be pulled back into his grief.
No, it’s been enough. It’s time to continue. So Steve calls up Sam, asking him to come over to the lakehouse – where they’ve been residing for the past two weeks or so. Peter’s back to school and Morgan, too, has started classes again.
“Because… I thought this was a good opportunity,” Tony admits. When he sees their questioning looks he explains further: “To retire. For real this time, like I mentioned a few days ago.”
Mumbling more than speaking, Tony explains the situation in annoyance. “Yeah, I had a can just for emergencies. Relax, can we focus, please?”
“Daddy, I’m hungry,” the girl complains. Steve puts a hand behind her head and kisses her through her hair. Hearing her words, Tony gets up on his feet as well. It’s time to start feeding the little monster, he realizes.
“Well,
“Come on, everybody’s here. We should get this started.”
Yaël shrugs again. “It’s possible. It’s like it’s trying to warn me about something. Something…”
“Going quantum. Three, two, one…”
“You can start by giving us some answers. After that I promise I’ll let you rejoin your people but I can assure you that they’re well being taken care of. My team’s tending to the injured, and they’re being handed out food and drinks.”
Peter tries. He really tries. He starts making his way downstairs, but he’s not fast enough. One moment, Tony forms a blade with the suit, and the next the blade is stabbed into his gut.
Peter looks over at the gauntlet, though it takes him a few short seconds to finally get up on his feet. Feeling a little bit shaky, he hands it over to her while noticing that large barrier of Thanos’ army slowly approaching them.
The only trouble with bringing Yaël here is that it’s a package deal, as it turns out. With her came what must be the most annoying creature in the whole world; a man called Wade Wilson who has sustained unimaginable wounds onto his face and has the rare ability of never dying.
Tony glances at Steve once, but then he clears his throat. He turns towards the others and claps his hands together twice to get their attention. Steve gives him a confused look, but follows along. Once Tony sees that the others are looking at him, he grins.
“No!” she hears again when she drops down on the ground. The woman holding the primitive gun drops her weapon and starts running towards Gamora. It’s a flash of white approaching her. Gamora is surprised Thanos even allows it.
He never expects to see a silhouette standing there. It’s a woman, he realizes. He can recognizes as she lowers her glowing. She has her face bare in space, yet it doesn’t seem to bother her. Her hair is flowing thanks to the powers she must be releasing. When she sees him, she offers him a smile.
“Uh, what exactly is it that they do?” he asks in confusion. Now there he goes, putting out the real questions, clearly indicating that he’s as done with this as Tony is. Like father, like son. Good kid.
“You’re the ones Thor told us about!” the woman calls out behind them. That rings some alarm bells inside Tony’s head.
,” says FRIDAY as the images on the hologram changes.
Tony stops then, looking back into the trunk and then reaching for the thing that has been lingering in the garage for a bit too long.
After three days, the rest of the avengers return. Tony’s surprised they all made it, though he’s not surprised the mission failed. The entire group scatters around, disbanding for the time being. They’ve all got other places to be as they wallow in their failure.
After making sure that she’s alright, he tries to focus back on the battle. Yet, he’s still stuck in place. Is Thanos throwing an entire moon onto his Dad?
“Loki?” Thor asks, a bit louder than earlier. His voice is strong, low, easy to hear. The fact that there’s no answer means that Loki’s not listening at him. Slowly, Hilde accompanies the new King of Asgard through the dark hallway. Most of the people are asleep, though it’s possible a lot of them are awake, still. It’s hard to keep a track on days when you’re up in the dark of Space. There’s no sun, no day nor night. There’s just… space.
“Take it off!” Thor shouts at him.
“There’s no time, Thor. You need to leave as well.”
Half of her hair come loose out of her ponytail. It’s falling in front of her face, shielding her sight from the large man that is now approaching her without a problem.
Peter is the next one too arrive. Tony wants to smile, but he’s not sure his face is doing what he tells it to.
The eyes of the helmet flash different lights while it’s recording him. If it’s recording him.
Except…
“Wait, what, Thanos?” Strange frowns in confusion or annoyance, Tony isn’t sure. “Alright, let me ask you this one time: what master do you serve?”
Hilde turns to look at the doctor, who looks curious but at the same time a bit embarrassed about asking this.
He realizes that he’s been avoiding it; anything related to his son, he’s been trying not to think too much about it. Because Peter would always bring in him back hope, and upon the realization that there’s nothing to be done, he would always end up an even bigger wreck than before.
“H- Hi, I’m Peter Parker,” he greets the woman, who seems amused.
After all, whenever they’re inside with nobody else around, the disguises aren’t even needed.
Scott adds, before his tiny form points towards the group of newcomers. “
For the first time, it seems like Thanos is struggling. While he’s using his other stones to approach her, it’s clearly with a lot of effort. Wanda doesn’t dare to look, because this is all riding on her.
The only thing missing, of course, is her brother. That warm feeling in her chest slightly subsides at the thought of Pietro. Unknowingly she presses her hand over her heart, pushing down to create some sort of friction. Losing him… she still can’t really describe it. It has been the worst thing that ever happened to her, probably even worse than losing her parents, because even after that they had at least each other. After his passing, she would have thought she’d end up alone, somewhere on the streets.
Tony just leans against a metal pillar, looking up for a bit before sinking down his knees. He can vaguely hear Peter saying something to Strange for a bit, but he doesn’t listen to it. Instead, he closes his eyes and tries to think how yesterday evening he had been lying next to Steve in bed, convincing him to wait for a few more minutes before he had to leave.
“No, he isn’t. I sent him home. He has a parachute. Just, when you see him, tell him to keep out of trouble.”
Much to his horror, Steve’s upper hand quickly changes and instead, he’s being pushed back. With every blow, a piece of Steve’s shield breaks off along with it.
“I’m sorry, I can’t just
“I’m happy for him.” Peggy smiles sadly ahead of him. “I feared he would never settle down. It’s been difficult for him as well, losing you… He’s just… dealing with it differently.” She lifts her cup as she seems to remember something. Something that probably happened after all of this.
Strange is the first one back on his feet. He gets to Tony, holding out his hand to help him back up. Tony reduces the helmet once more, allowing Strange to help him.
“It was a birthday gift,” is all he says.
“I mean, maybe a little, but I only have Morgan with me once every week, so it’s not
Steve feels like he’s in a ghost town whenever he’s out on the street. It never changes.
“Dude, that’s the worst pep-talk,” Clint jokes next to him. Tony gives the man another glare before he turns back to Steve.
They stay like that for a couple of seconds, but eventually their time runs out. Pepper leans away, drying her eyes as she gets on her feet. Then she reaches out her hand.
Being it in the head by the Hulk must have made his brain work a little slower, but eventually it comes up to him. Tony’s eyes widen as the answer presents itself inside his head thanks to Scott’s continuous ranting.
Well, how about that?
After the initial surprise she lets him into the house. She offers him some tea, which Steve accepts gratefully. And after they’re both seated he explains to her how he’s still alive. All that has happened over the past few years. And while he lets out some crucial details – like SHIELD being infiltrated by HYDRA – he feels like he can finally be entirely honest.
“Did he just fall asleep?” Natasha asks in surprise.
These are the people they’ve fought so hard to protect. The people they sacrificed their home for.
Steve guides Tony back inside, though he’s quickly pushed into a wheelchair Bruce must have brought along.
Tony says nothing. He just looks at Peter, and takes his ungloved hand and puts it behind Peter’s head. His breath is still irregular, but at least it doesn’t seem as strained as before. Peter leans forward, pressing his forehead against his Dad’s with tears in his eyes.
“Yes! Yes! Activate Instant Kill!”
“Hey, Steve, you okay?”
“I don’t- I don’t know,” Vision admits, turning towards her. Despite his human appearance, the yellow stone on his forehead is glowing through the disguise. Wanda comes to stand in front of him, taking in the glow and observing it calmly. When it lightens up a bit more Vision hisses again. Her hands quickly go up to his cheeks.
Pepper jokes. “
He can’t let go of it, but he can’t get away. More and more beams make impact closer to him, and he’s blinded by many clouds of dust while he feels other creatures approach him, again. For some reason, his suit must have malfunctioned as his helmet is gone, meaning that the air around him isn’t exactly being filtered. Man, his lungs are so going to hate him for this.
It’s also their first ever picture together, so of course, it’s extra special to him. Tony wipes his towel over the frame to get the drops off, feeling tears well up in his eyes as he looks over his son’s smiling face.
“Don’t, don’t, don’t engage!” Tony suddenly shouts, startling Peter. “We’ve almost got this off!”
“How are you doing?” she asks without looking away from the people of Asgard. Their ship has only just crashed down on this open field – lucky for that! – but there’s no doubt that soon some special forces or security will come down to check on the commotion.
, after all these years, they sway together like they were supposed to. But now, instead of being crazy in love with her, Steve feels different. He loves her, still. He will always love her. But he knows, now, that this was not meant to be.
“Yes, the Queen died a few years back. Odin just last month, as well as Hela – though nobody was really rooting for her to be fair as she was the reason our planet’s destroyed.”
“Ooh, sounds kinky.” He can’t say more when his targets have arrived on the lower floor. God, that elevator was slow back in the day. Tony makes sure they don’t see his face until they all have their backs to him. “Thumbelina, do you copy? I’ve got eyes on the prize. It’s go-time.”
kid! As if a kid that was legally
“Clearly, your friend is fine.” Natasha looks away
He stops for a bit, turning to look at Thor, making the King look up as well with a sad expression in his eyes.
They take care of them surprisingly quickly, the two of them clearly taken by surprise at the strength coming from these three.
“You made your point. Just sit down.”
While Morgan is not Peter, she is a completely different person and their child. Or, well, it’s complicated. They’ve all agreed to this, obviously, and it’s going to be hard to explain at school that the girl has one mother and three fathers. Tony, at first, didn’t want anything to do with the baby. That changed as soon as she was born. He fell in love with her on first sight, and even Steve felt an immediate fatherly love towards the girl. So they’ve come to the agreement that Morgan stays with them one week, and then she goes back to Pepper and Happy.
“You know, I saw a pod of whales when I was coming up the bridge.”
“Did he give you any clues? Any coordinates? Anything?” This time it’s Natasha who speaks. Tony glances at her, even squints his eyes. Natasha tries not to let it get to her, but clearly it still does.
“Everyone, on my position. We have incoming.”
“We’ve all grown up,” Natasha points out. She looks up at Thor, who, for once, isn’t eating on something. Instead, he’s throwing little rocks into the water. “Most of you even have kids. It’s kind of unbelievable.”
Morgan doesn’t seem to come out, so Tony sits down on the tiny chair next to the tent.
“Shit,” repeats Morgan with a playful grin, knowing she’s saying something she shouldn’t be saying.
There’s nothing but a gigantic white light at first. A strong sense of residual energy gathered around her. When Wanda can see again, she’s on the ground, trembling and finally crying for real. It’s done. It’s over. She has done it. There’s no way back for her, anymore.
Good thing that Wong is still paying attention, though.
“A one way- you didn’t think you would be coming back, did you?” he asks lowly. Tony lets out an annoyed sigh, his hands going up into his hair while he distances himself from his son. He needs to- he has to- He doesn’t know, his mind is going in overdrive, he thinks. There’s this ache in his chest, this pressure inside of it that makes it difficult to breathe. Tony puts his fingers against his neck, only realizing that he can’t feel anything. That’s even worse, because he could swear that his heart is racing.
Steve is already up on his feet, and Natasha is doing the same behind him. Both stare at the video message in front of him.
“There’s no time for a thing!” Tony says, putting a hand on Bruce’s shoulder and pointing at Big running up to them. “That’s the thing right there, let’s go.”
Tony feels a tear roll of his cheeks. He can’t help it, it’s stronger than him. All he wanted was Peter back on Earth, safely away from these monsters who were leaving the planet. If Tony disappears, it’s not that big of a deal; Peter has May, he has Steve, he has all of the Avengers.
Gamora knows the woman, much like she knows the man, as well. Her heart aches, at the thought that these new parents would be robbed of their happiness like that, in only a matter of minutes.
They all step back with a smile. Rocket looks up at Scott with a surprised look. “He’s pretty good at that,” he says. Scott nods in agreement.
“I literally pieced it together as I went along. I thought about what my Dad…” Tony hesitates when he notices Steve standing a bit further away, holding his thumb up to indicate that he succeeded. “…did.”
He has no idea what’s going on. He rarely does when scientific stuff happens. He just stands there and nods, pretending to understand.
you.”
“Where’s your guy?” Tony asks, suddenly nervous. Bruce already looks defeated.
Wanda shivers, afraid to look at Vision but unwilling to let him go. Maybe there’s still a way. Maybe Shuri got enough data. Maybe… Maybe…
“How about you just start from the beginning?”
He’s immediately joined by Drax, Mantis and Quill. Then, after another, long second, another figure comes swinging by. Tony lets out a soft cry, surely heard by the titan not too far from him. But he doesn’t care.
And that’s where they are after five years. Or, well, that’s the highlights. Steve could talk about Natasha, but she’s been burying herself in work, never letting go of the hope that she can bring the others back. And then there’s Bruce, who has been experimenting more with the Hulk after the few hiccups they’ve been having together during the battle of Wakanda. To put it shortly, at this point he’s Hulk, but with the brain of Banner. It’s complicated, but Bruce seems to be happy this way.
That answer startles Hilde. She never thought about how other people would think of her and Sif together. She didn’t even know people ever saw them together all that much.
“Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you I’m gonna French-fry this little freak.” It’s a threat, spoken out in a low voice. This man means business.
“You alright, Dad?” Peter asks. Tony moves his hand up to rub his eyes.
“Is it true that you and Lady Sif- that you’ve… you know?”
“I’m sorry, but we can’t stay here to chat,” he returns, avoiding the accusation she was obviously about to throw at him. He grabs her arm once again and then locks eyes with Hilde. “Take her away from here. As far away as you can possibly get her. The ship divides in two. Grab as many civilians as you can and get out of here.”
It’s not given to them, obviously.
“I take that back,” Peter quickly mutters out. “But… now I’m here in space-“
“Hear me, and rejoice,” the skinny one starts. “You are about to die at the hands of the children of Thanos. Be thankful that your meaningless lives are now contributing to-“
Strange stares for a few more seconds before he makes up his mind.
“What are you doing?” she suddenly hears behind her. It’s a familiar, hoarse voice. One that seems to be permanently dry on this specific planet. She didn’t sound like this in space. It must be this specific atmosphere that alters her voice like this.
“We can’t leave these people to die,” she counters.
“Happy trails, Peter. FRI, send him home.”
In the background, Hilde is letting out a battle cry as she takes down a leviathan on her own. Peter can see purple blood drop everywhere, which is kind of a sight.
Seeing the King of Wakanda being lifted up from the ground by that one guy’s telekinetic powers, Peter jumps into action.
Steve finds some new strength inside of him and he jumps up to resume the fight. He tightens his grip on his shield, looks around to see where to start, and slowly but surely starts nearing Thor until, eventually, they’re next to one another. With another bit of teamwork between the two of them – they’ve realized early on that they work well in battle – the two manage to get a bit of a breather as they look at each other.
“What happened?” she asks as Steve is retreating from them. Natasha lets out a loud sigh.
But then there’s a moment of distraction. She feels a hand touch her sleeve, pulling at it to get her attention. When she turns around, she finds Vision, looking up at her with a scared look in his eyes. Scared and sad.
With Peter’s help, Tony builds himself a new arm. After that, a new eye. Steve stays out of it; it’s way too advanced for him, after all. Instead, he joins Bruce with their plan to get the stones back to where they officially belong. It takes a few days of planning, but they’re not really in a hurry. As they start with the repairs of the compound, they set camp in the woods not to far away from it.
“Where’s your other friend?” asks Natasha, sounding like she’s sad for his absence.
“He’s unbeatable!”
“Yes, you can. You have no obligations here right now,” Strange interrupts him. Tony glares at him, pointing up a finger in his direction.
“He’s not here,” he says quickly. “We’ve called May, Ned, Harry, all his other friends we could possibly think of. We suspect he went up with his old man on that ship.”
“Who just saved your magical ass?” he asks before pointing back at Peter, who clearly looks like he wants nothing to do with this. “He did.”
He doesn’t have the time to respond. Before he can open his mouth something rolls on the ground between him and Strange. A small, metal ball. But Tony doesn’t need to be a genius to know that this isn’t good. He pulls up the helmet once more, wishing that Peter has the same idea.
It’s a nice change, and returning to the tower without… no, he couldn’t do it.
It’s Rhodey who starts. As it stands, it’s been twenty-three days since Thanos came to Earth, which means that Tony’s calculations had been right.
“Oh, babe, I can never forget that suit. It did nothing for your ass.”
“Peter isn’t with me. But it’s alright. We’ll get him back in no time, alright May?” Looking over at Rhodey, he indicates for him to come up. Rhodey’s face has fallen, though he hurries to Tony’s side and nearly snatches the phone out of his hands.
“Yeah, no, I gotta tell you; he’s not really my friend,” Tony says with a shrug. “Saving his life is more of a professional courtesy.”
“What’s wrong with him?” asks Tony, pointing at the Asgardian man.
? She can’t hear what the woman is saying, so she has no idea what happened to him.
“Where is the soul stone?”
It’s a good thing that Steve knows another incredibly talented genius somewhere. He breathes in relief before shaking his head. “I know someone. I’ll make the call,” he says. He takes out his phone and dials Bucky’s number. After all, he doesn’t really have T’Challa or Shuri on his speed dial.
Morgan smiles again. “I love you 3000,” she returns. Tony snorts, because that doesn’t make any sense.
Loki barely looks back at her. His gaze varies from the unconscious girl to the infant child in his arms. The baby coos, once, but has at least stopped crying.
“Yeah, he was.”
“I don’t know. We’re certainly having a thing,” he returns.
In the background, he can see Wanda standing up against that familiar, purple giant. Peter was aware of her great power, but seeing the guy struggling against her makes him realize once more just how much power she possesses. It’s kind of great. She’s kind of great!
She knows when she’s the last one standing. She feels him approach. She redirects a part of her power and guides it towards Thanos, with that not giving the maximum to the Stone. But she needs more time, and the others can’t help her anymore.
“We didn’t,” Clint admits. “We found her knocked out on the streets.” Then he looks up, around him.
The Iron Spider comes down next to him, already holding up his hands.
“Thor, we are not your children,” Clint points out and Thor stops in his movements shortly.
“Try it on,” he says. The emotionally fond look Sam had disappears and changes into confusion when Steve’s words start to sink in. Upon hearing the footsteps behind them, Steve knows that Tony finally ventured back out of the house, though he doesn’t come closer. He still sees Sam glancing backwards.
Strange is the only one in view. He’s confronting the large figure that appeared in front of them.
Steve frowns as he closes his book. “I don’t think we’re talking about the methods of composting here,” he points out. “Just so we’re talking about the same thing-“
“It’s okay, stand down,” he says. Giving Wong a short look, he continues: “Can I leave you with him?”
“FRIDAY give me a little juice!” Tony asks. FRIDAY puts up the boosters onto his boots, and his tempo picks up. In his ear, he can hear Peter letting out difficult breaths. “Unlock 17-A.”
Hilde nods. Then, after a short goodbye, she starts running back into the opposite direction. First, she needs to get Yaël, make sure that they’re out of the ship before the bad guys realize half the civilization is missing.
“They took Agnar,” the man then whispers out, looking at his hands disbelievingly. He’s shivering, looking like he’s at the verge of collapsing. Hilde turns towards him, grabbing his arms and shaking him out of his state.
Tony nods, honestly feeling like he’s floating out of his body right now. There’s a thousand emotions going through him somehow. His mind telling him that he should have known, that he should not have forgotten what he built Ultron for.
“I’m confused as to the relationship here, I mean, what is he? Your ward?”
As Tony’s consciousness fully comes back, it’s to Scott’s voice inside his ear.
It’s horrible in every way to watch somebody being choked to death. Even as a God, Loki struggles to free himself from Thanos’ hand. He swings his legs, shakes his entire body. His face turns blue, though. The two brothers trying to escape, but neither of them succeeding.
The raccoon doesn’t even grin. “Maybe I am.”
With her face wet from tears and dirty from being thrown around, she looks up to him. She’s not even bothering to let out any power. It’s no use.
There’s another nod from Odal. He sniffs his nose, turning towards the computer and suddenly starting to type things down furiously.
“Something’s happening,” Mantis says while she’s still held up by Quill. She holds a hand against her middle, leaning up against the leader of her group. Her large eyes look up in the sky, only for her body to slowly disappear into dust.
Peter’s already on him, despite that. A bit shaken and blinded by the sunlight pouring through the clouds, he barely sees Peter approach him until he’s grabbing on to his arms.
“I’m okay, I’m okay,” he grits out through the pain. Thor holds up his thumbs, though he’s still prepared for anything. Bruce uses his other hand to raise his arm up. It takes a lot of effort out of him, and he screams even louder. Then, in just the flash of a second, he’s snapped his finger once, and he drops down on the ground. The gauntlet immediately comes loose and drops on the ground.
“PETE!”
“It’s hard to imagine,” Steve admits. Tony has to agree there.
“You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood,” says the King.
“I don’t- I can’t.” He stops talking when he notices something, and he points towards his younger brother-in-law. “Johnny?”
“Chow time!” he calls out, referring to the meal he’s finished preparing only a few minutes earlier. Steve should be back soon, so it’s time to get the kid to wash her hands and sit down.
“What does that mean?” Yaël asks with approaching footsteps. Hilde can feel her coming nearer, until she sees a shadow hanging over her. Looking over, the first thing she notices are those wild, dark curls. Thank Thor that she decided to dye them back to her original color the moment she got back here.
“Not too long ago,” he admits. Finally he can hear Tony walking their way. They both pull their hands back, and as soon as Tony stands behind Steve he leans back against him. His left hand takes Tony’s, where the same golden band is rested. Sam smiles even further when he sees it.
“There’s fewer ships, cleaner water.”
Before they can reach out for the second man, the doors open and some sort of army starts storming inside. The person, Hilde can’t say what it is, exactly, says something to the man. Before he can answer, he’s suddenly pulled along, through the door.
“You don’t understand, you need to leave!” Loki urges on, apparently not bothering to keep his voice down.
And Steve can understand more than anything why Tony had been hesitant about it. He had been thinking it over for months, wishing Pepper happiness, but at the same time feeling like he was going to betray Peter by creating another child. Eventually, Steve managed to talk him through it, and a couple of months later there was Morgan.
“Pete, help! Get over here.” Peter lets go of his webs and jumps to Tony. Without needing instruction, he grabs onto the gauntlet. “She can’t hold him much longer, so let’s go.”
“Uh, no, not really. Vision is, uh… he’s on a holiday with his girlfriend.”
who doesn’t understand that Thanos has been inside my head for
Having all the stones on his hand clearly seems to affect Tony. His entire arm is glowing multiple colors, all coming from the stones. His armor is struggling to stay intact. With difficulty, Tony manages to open his mouth. This time, Peter can hear what he’s saying.
Tony notices the portal behind Steve before the super soldier does.
Thor is stuck in place, looking incredibly guilt-ridden while staring at his hands. As if they’ve personally betrayed him.
“You’re looking for the Starks,” she points out as she puts the unconscious girl down on a bed Susan points them at.
“Well, he’s on his way to Wakanda, isn’t he? He could make a detour to Scotland, pick them up?”
“Yeah? Like what?” Howard looks excited to hear some more about parenting.
Steve nods. “So we keep it that way.”
“Yes, you can.” Vision pulls her hand away and keeps it in front of his forehead. In front of the stone. “If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.
Tony sighs. Rather than heading to the garage, he goes to his study. He doesn’t have a work bench in there, but there’s a table that’s connected to FRIDAY that he can use. Through the windows, he looks over at Steve and Morgan, who seem to be watching some of her favorite TV-shows.
It’s a good arrangement; Morgan is thriving. Especially in the lakehouse Steve and Tony built together after they wanted to escape the Avengers for a bit. Whenever Morgan is with them, both of her fathers tell her stories about her older brother. It’s the only time they manage to talk about Peter without bursting into tears – well, the tears come later when Morgan is asleep. Though, the older she gets, the less she asks about Peter. As if she's sensing their sadness.
Hilde can’t move in time. Both she and her flying horse are too close to the impact of the beam from Thanos’ ship. Peter falls off the horse, ending up on the ground as he still holds on to the gauntlet.
“No, sir. I’m a- a visitor from MIT.”
“HILDE!” somebody shouts. Hilde turns around, finding Loki and Yaël standing a bit more in the back. Loki points at her, indicating for Hilde to get back there. She sighs and runs back into their direction.
Tony offers to do the dishes. Before, he would have gone above and beyond to find excuses not to do them, but lately they’ve been a good way to distract himself. Besides, it’s not too much to wash off. Tony finishes it after only ten minutes. When he puts the last plate on the rack, he notices that he’s been splashing some water around. He dries off everything he got wet, but he stops when he notices the picture frame over there.
It looks almost like the others are agreeing. At least, Thor seems to be on the same wavelength. He’s letting out another yawn and leans up against a pillar.
Lady Sif returns the seventh day after their arrival. She comes in search of Thor and her companions, only to learn that nobody’s left. None of the Warriors Three have made it. All her friends are gone.
Steve shrugs and stammers out an answer. “Well, yeah, but… I never really thought we would- you know… so quickly…” He sighs again, looking down at his hands now that they’re no longer underneath a book. “A lot of people lost someone, like we did.”
