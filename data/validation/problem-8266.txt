I know I’ve hurt you Tony. I’ve hurt you with my response to what happened with Ultron. By not listening and refusing to understand why you did it. And then by going radio silent after we…
Tony sucked in a few sharp breaths of air to calm himself, anxiety spiking, and closed his eyes briefly. Once he felt level, he opened them and happily took in the sight of Steve before him. Steve was wearing that delicious dark blue button down that was several sizes too small—seriously, did the super solider purposely shop for tight clothes or did he just not know how to shop?
(See the end of the chapter for
“You don’t look too bad yourself, Romanoff,” Tony gave her a peck on the cheek. “Green velvet has always been perfect on you.”
“I’m sorry about the divorce, by the way,” Tiberius said, lowering his voice and smile vanishing.
Natasha was an oxymoron—both incredibly gentle in her love for her friends but completely capable of tough love when necessary. This was one of those tougher moments, Tony figured.
Steve had friends out searching for Bucky ever since they parted ways months and months ago. He and Sam had been looking whenever they had the time, but so far failed to find any solid trace. And now this text. But the information was likely unreliable—he wouldn’t exactly trust the source with his life. And yet he was still stuck staring at his phone with a frown on his face.
Tony scoffed but he was also fidgeting with the silverware on the table. Rhodey calling him out so blatantly had made him anxious—he was not ready to cut to the chase just yet. But now he had no choice, his best friend sitting across from him, with that ‘take no bullshit’ look on his face. Tony loved Rhodey—more than he loved a lot of people—but he wished he let him warm up a little bit more. But that was just how Rhodey was—there was never time for nonsense, no beating around the bush—which was probably better, because if Tony were left to his own devices, he could take hours working up the courage to talk about things.
“Oh—s-sorry,” Steve stuttered, rushing over to his bed and pulling on the t-shirt that sat on the edge of it. Tony had seen him shirtless countless times, why did this time feel different? He squashed the questions bubbling up in his mind.
“I’m sorry if this is crossing a line—I promise the art just went up, no one has seen it, I wanted to get your permission first,” Tony rambled. He reached out to touch Steve’s arm, panicking that he had made a big mistake and Steve would be furious.
“Tony, please don’t—Tony
“I think sometimes we forget that families don’t have to look just one way. You guys are still a family, even if you and Pepper aren’t together, that doesn’t change that you’re Morgan’s parents and that you love her. You guys can do that…uhhhh, what’s it called? Co-parenting?”
“Well—I just wanted to give you something I’ve been working on for you. Y’know, as a gift,” Steve stumbled through his words, the nervousness dripping off him, and a light blush creeping across his cheeks.
He tossed and turned in bed several times, groaning and slamming his fists into the mattress.
She scoffed and Tony knew better than that—he knew he couldn’t throw her off his trail now that she had seen his jealousy written across his face.
“Tony needs medical attention—NOW!” Steve cried out over the comms. He dropped his shield and applied pressure to the wound, guilt seizing him as Tony sobbed in pain from the touch. Guilt suffocating him as he increasingly felt more and more responsible for Tony’s injury.
“Fine,” he grunted between hits.
I had originally intended for the last chapter of this fic to be a long epic one. But as I wrote it, that didn't feel write. Instead I wanted some simple fluff and happiness. The next chapter is just a short little epilogue. I am so excited to have this fic done soon. It has been a big project for me. I hope you love it. Please continue to share and comment! It gives me life. <3
The first part of the day Tony and Morgan hung out with Auntie Nat and Auntie Wanda. Tony sat around the living room floor with the three of them while Nat and Wanda painted Morgan’s nails.
He paused, taking a deep breath and finally going still. This was going to take intentionality and brain power to get these words out. The panic surged through his veins, but Pepper’s soft tone leveled him out a bit. He could do this—he could. What was the worst that could happen? Pepper would be furious, yell maybe? He had endured just that a million times. Yeah—he could do this, he could tell her about his feelings for Steve and how they scared the shit out of him.
“Tony?!” Pepper’s shrill voice called out from the other side of the room.
This beautiful moment feels simultaneously powerful and yet so fragile. Both men are frantic to engrain it in their memories, their hands running over each other’s arms and chests, logging the details their fingertips find.
Regardless, once Tony had seen that expression on Steve’s face he knew he had to run or else he was going to collapse into his big, beautifully muscled arms and that was not something he knew how to face yet.
“Yes, I do seem to remember that too.”
“What’s your point, Nat?”
“Ty,” Nat replied, her voice suddenly harsh. “Can’t say the same.”
Besides, this was not just about who Steve was or wasn’t, this was about the likelihood of him dating Tony Stark. And who were Nat and Sam kidding? Tony could have literally anyone he wanted, why would he even want Steve? A meager text message would have any suitor speeding their way towards the Tower for a date with Tony.
“Daddy can I paint your toes?” Morgan begged.
“They’re always unbearable. But at least I usually had Pepper at my side to make things less horrible. We’ve been broken up for a year and I doubt her new boyfriend would want her on my arm at such a public event,” Tony sighed.
Tony would be lying if he said he wasn’t absolutely giddy to celebrate this way. He was actually surprised it took him until this late in life to do a showy Christmas—considering his predisposition towards grand gestures and glamour.
“It only takes a couple weeks of being around you idiots to figure out where your minds go,” she teased. “From there I’m pretty much repeating myself every time the same old thing happens. Now get up and go to bed. It’s my turn.”
Steve woke up early the next morning to make a massive breakfast for everyone who was staying at the compound this weekend. He knew that besides Tony and himself, Nat, Bucky, Thor, Bruce, and Rhodey were around. It was always fun to do something for the team but if he were being honest, he needed the distraction from the constant thoughts of Tony’s body resting against his from the night before.
Steve and Tony invite some of their closest friends to a special lunch.
“Tony, I don’t think that’s a good idea,” she called back.
He immediately locked eyes on Tony and Pepper and fired a blast directly to their left. Tony knew it was not a warning shot, but poor aim due to the amount of power surging through Zeke’s suit.
Pepper was beautiful, brilliant, strong, and successful.
And it was in that moment that he got an inkling to what Bucky said the other day.
“Tony—we are friends. Teammates. You’re allowed to talk about your feelings,” he chuckled. The slight blush that dusted Tony’s cheeks was alarmingly satisfying.
When he was met with silence, he decided to continue, “I’m sorry. I really am. I let you all down. Hell, I let myself down. And I’m sorry.”
“Yeah, sorry,” Steve mumbled. He carefully unwrapped the gift—not wanting to tear any of the paper because even it looked expensive. After a couple painstaking moments, he had opened it and froze. Steve was unable to move as he stared at what lay in his lap—this was an impossible gift.
And when Steve got up and started walking towards Tony’s room—
Tony blinked, unsure if he heard her correctly. Her gentle hand on his knee reassured him, but the crippling guilt of putting his family at risk again rushed in and swallowed him whole.
Tony and Nat collapsed into ringside chairs in the training room after finishing their final round of their sparring match. He gulped down half a bottle of water, breathing significantly heavier than Nat, and looking exhausted by comparison. She smirked.
“Then what is it?”
“I—uh—yeah,” Tony grumbled, embarrassed by how creepy he did look, and he walked in. Reluctantly, he plopped down in the armchair across from Bucky and tried to mentally prepare himself for the conversation. “What are you reading?”
“Yeah, could have done without that,” Steve quipped. “But you don’t have to apologize. He’s a manipulator, right? He caught wind of how emotionally comprised you’ve been and swooped in. That’s on him. Not you.”
Tony wasn’t sure if this was a date or a simple catch-up conversation. Either way, he could roll with it.
Adam gave him no reaction, much to his dismay.
“I have to go,” he said, standing up abruptly.
“Unfortunately,” Tony chuckled. “Happy won’t shut up about her. But go him—your Aunt May is a—nevermind.” Peter’s disgusted look stopped Tony is his tracks.
“Old age makes you extra sappy. At least that’s what Aunt May says every single time she cries over me,” Peter laughed. Tony elbowed him hard in the ribs. “Ow! Okay, I give, I give. You’re not old.”
“Hmmm? What are you talking about?”
“Oh, I love your ideas,” he mused, smiling against her skin. “What is it?”
“Come on Cap, you’re getting slow in your old age,” she said, breathless.
“Sharon,” he replied flatly. “I’ve been uh—nevermind. Anyway, Buck thought it might be a good idea to give it one last try. I needed a distraction. I know that sounds bad—anyway, we couldn’t make it work. Again.” He shrugged. “We’re still good friends.”
The neon sign with green and red writing beckoned them, just a few more shops away, and Tony couldn’t help but get an excited bounce in his step. This was his absolute favorite Italian place to eat.
“Uh, you’re serious?”
he thought.
His primary concern was to not disturb Tony—to not invade his personal space. He clasped his hands on his chest and listened closely to the other man’s breathing. It was not long before he could tell Tony had fallen asleep.
“I knew. But I confirmed with Friday.”
Dozens of robots that resembled the Iron Man suit.
Tony smirked as he grabbed Steve’s hand, their fingers intertwining.
“You’re welcome.”
Bucky was already at his side, helping him clean up the scattered pieces. While they were kneeling on the floor together, Bucky reached out for Steve’s arm and steadied him. The concern was clear on his face.
Tony squeezed him. God, if only this kid knew just how important he was. “I am happy. You make me really happy, Peter.”
Tony visibly stiffened, white knuckle gripping his screwdriver. “How, uh, do you know that?”
“Aw, Buck, I don’t think you know what you’re talking about,” he drawled. Steve frowned—how was Bucky missing the mark this badly? Normally he could always rely on Bucky to see something clearly that he was missing. He was the best at filling in the gaps while giving a reality check. Steve frowned up at his friend, displeased that he was so off when he was so desperate for guidance.
In a single smooth movement, she grabbed Tony’s hand as it moved forward for another punch, with her other hand against his shoulder, and threw him onto his back. She pinned him down, smirking, knowing he wouldn’t bother to fight back.
Peter frowned, clearly not tracking what Tony was alluding to.
“We should go to sleep?” Steve suggested. Tony rubbed his eyes with his fists.
Crunch.
They got a small booth tucked away in the corner, for privacy, with a single small tea light candle flickering in the middle. The chairs were large and cushiony—so entirely comfortable Tony wouldn’t mind being swallowed whole by one. The restaurant’s lantern chandeliers were dimmed to give mood lighting for the patrons—considering anyone out for dinner this late was usually on a romantic date.
“What does he say?” Tony asked, leaning even more into Bucky’s words.
“Yeah, okay, thanks bug boy,” Tony grumbled.
“Yeah, your bad. It’s fine—he’s a good liar. That’s sort of his thing. Sorry he made you think I was dead,” Tony sat back in his side of the booth and took a long sip of his coffee.
“Well—I don’t want to mess this up either, Nat.”
Then why does it still feel empty?
Steve leaned forward a bit, lightly kissing Tony’s forehead. “I love your brain. Your genius brain that creates things that make the world a better place—that literally saves the world. And your smile—god—I would do anything to see you smile,” he says, kissing Tony’s cheek near his lips.
“I love you too, Tony. Now please, finally do something about your feelings for Captain America because, and I think I can speak for everyone when I say this, we are tired of you two helplessly pining after one another.”
“You hear me?” Steve repeated.
“Yeah, yeah. Sometimes I like to be considerate of other people’s schedules, thank you very much,” Tony huffed. He put a lot of money down on the table—way more than the food cost, by Steve’s judgement—and they walked back to the car.
“God Tony—no, we did not. I’m offended you think sex with me would be forgettable,” he teased.
“Just—be honest with him. Reassure him. Soothe his anxiety the best you can. Listen to his concerns and respond in kind,” she explained. “You have a way with words. You give the best speeches. I’m sure you’ll say the right thing.”
“But what—what do I do about that?” Steve asked helplessly.
Everyone was hanging out in the living room after dinner—Thor, Rhodey, Bruce, Nat, Bucky, Tony, and Steve—and it had started out as a great idea. Tony wasn’t sure where it started going downhill, but once it began it blew up fast.
“You should always dress nice for a date, Steve. That doesn’t mean anything,” she said. “Will you feel better if I help you pick out an outfit?”
“I took Peter home this morning so you don’t have to worry about him,” Nat started, leaning forward with her elbows on her knees. She looked concerned.
“Tony, are you jealous?” Steve asked, raising an eyebrow and his tone ever so slightly patronizing.
Steve knew everything Tony had been through made jumping in to a new intimate, romantic relationship not only scary but damn near impossible. He had never personally experience even half of the romantic pitfalls Tony had been through—Peggy and Sharon being his only romantic conquests and, well, both ended quite unconventionally. But he was a tactician, he was able to see things a lot of people didn’t, which made him quite skilled in putting himself in other people’s shoes.
Steve burst out laughing—not the reaction Tony had hoped for regardless of if they had sex or not. He crossed his arms over his chest, pouting, until Steve composed himself enough to respond.
“So, you’ve finally started to come around on your crush on Rogers, huh?” Rhodey said, breaking the silence and doing exactly what Tony hoped he wouldn’t.
“Oh? And who, exactly, is lining up to fuck me?” Tony snapped. “I said what I said, Cap. I wanted to get drunk and have sex. Ty texted. It was fate.”
“I am not—you are not—I am not having this conversation with a teenager,” Tony fumbled. “No way. Nope.”
And then he nearly killed Tony Stark in a fit of rage.
Tony turned off the machine he was using and pushed his goggles up on the top of his head. Pulling off his gloves, he walked over to Steve and the couch with a quirked eyebrow. “Sure do, what’s up?”
“What?”
Steve’s eyes were welling up with tears. And the tears stung. They were fueled by years of denial and refusal to feel these emotions.
“That would be great, Tony. Yeah, I’d love that,” Steve beamed at him, unrestrained, and Tony wondered how he could be so comfortable showing emotion.
“Tony—what’s wrong? I literally just told you the Tiberius situation was handled, there’s a restraining order saying he cannot come anywhere near you, any Stark or Avengers properties, or Morgan,” Pepper sighed. “I don’t understand.”
“Thanks Cap.”
They chuckled softly, refusing to break apart and end the moment.
He needed to apologize. He knew that—hell, he wanted to apologize. But he was unusually nervous to do it.
“Thanks,” he replied lamely. “Are you liking the book?”
He tortured himself replaying the events in his mind over and over and over. If he had been up in the penthouse from the beginning Stane would have never fired a single blast. He knew both he and Carol would have seen to that. The flame of guilt burned brighter with each passing moment—Steve walked himself deeper and deeper into the fire—and soon his entire body was ablaze with it. His pencil snapped in half in his hand.
“On whether or not Steve’s breakfast cooking has improved,” Nat added in, coming to the rescue. Steve could have kissed her, but he would rather not get punched by Bucky before they sparred later.
Tony, you don’t give yourself enough credit. And I know you blame yourself for the destruction Ultron caused, for your break-up with Pepper, for all the bad things that have happened in recent years, but you’re wrong. Bad things happen, but you are so often the reason they get stopped and solved.
“You look good too, Tony,” Steve replied. “Red is your color.”
“Steve,” he croaked out, barely audible.
“Nothing!” Tony yelled, finally looking their direction. The panic was crawling up his spine and reaching out to latch onto his lungs. His breath was shallow, but Tony was determined to hide his anxiety from everyone. Something like this should not get to him—he should be above media scandals by now—and yet he was suffocating. More than ever before there were people whose opinions mattered to Tony now—Morgan, Peter—and now, upon the possibility of a blossoming romance with Steve—him, too.
The boys sat in silence. The waves lapped lazily over them. Steve had been zoning out when he felt something: soft fingers laced their way through his own and gripped his hand. Steve’s head shot down to where he saw Tony’s hand intertwined with his own. He felt a small tingle creep it’s way up his arm and into his whole body. He looked up to meet Tony’s golden eyes. Steve tried saying something a few times, but words wouldn’t come out of his mouth.
Towards the left middle of the canvas Steve added a large rock in the ocean. On top he painted the red tail with gold flecks he seen last night. Steve was proud of his rendition, but was afraid of painting the rest of him.
“Sure.”
“You’re welcome.” They sat in silence for a bit before Tony said, “I think I better explain myself.”
“Good.”
“What are we doing today?” Tony asked with enthusiasm that shouldn’t exist that early in the morning.
“Steve isn’t that dangerous? At this speed you might get hurt.”
“I don’t believe in half fish half human hybrids who live in the ocean, which is extremely unrealistic, by the way, because below a couple hundred feet there is no light! Also how would scientists miss them for this long?”
Steve picked up the book and flipped through a couple pages. It seemed interesting enough (not like Steve could understand any of it), so he moved over to the art section.
“Yeah.”
Pepper gave Tony a kiss on the cheek and left. Natasha came to Tony’s side.
Peggy eyed him fiercely. “Okay, the boat went out to sea and was tossed and whipped by the waves. It crashed and sunk, presumably killing the thirteen people on board. That was until they all washed up on shore a few days later just like the boy had: unharmed, with a mark on their lower backs, and talking about a mermaid’s kiss!
“It’s beautiful.” Steve said as he admired the intricacy.
Steve was quick to come up with an idea, “I can keep it for you. I’ll bring it to you when you want. Or maybe…” Steve trailed off, but thought of an idea. “Are there any underwater caves around here that you know of?”
Steve sighed, “Today has been the weirdest day ever.”
He hooked the machine up to a large flat screen and the DVD began to play.
“Well, I like to watch humans and learn about their customs and I’ve never seen you before. You caught my eye.” He winked.
“Tell me about it.”
“Are you sure?”
“O-o-hh. That’s so cool Buck. Wow. I would have never guessed that.”
“No. I do. I just didn’t think we could cause, you know, your dad.” They had discussed Tony’s difficult family life and Steve realized that maybe their worlds weren’t so different after all.
He couldn’t help the urge to see if Tony was around or any sign that he had been. The waves had washed away any prints the boys left, but before Steve went on his run, he made sure to check to see if he still had the blurry photo of the two of them. Steve sighed a huge sigh of relief when he saw that it was still on his phone.
Next thing, Peggy could read people easily and had figured out Steve in less than a minute. She figured out what was making Steve look constipated and gave him some advice.
“Welcome to the Mermaid Museum. I know it’s kind of stupid to take a merman to a museum about mermaids according to humans, but hey.”
“Trust me. Once that sun starts to set, go to him. He’ll be waiting, don’t worry.”
When Steve finished showering, he threw on some clothes and shuffled back to the couch. Tony smiled at him and returned his attention to the TV. A few minutes later, Peggy came up the stairs in her pajamas.
As Steve was looking at a “mermaid bone” a small kid was tugging on his shirt. Steve took out his headphones and looked at the kid. He was about seven or eight with light brown hair and freckles.
“Bucky!”
He picked up a screwdriver and threw it at the wall. It clanged loudly against the wall and fell to the floor. He turned to see Pepper and Natasha watching him.
“Well that’s boring.”
“Bye.”
“Maybe I’ve seen her. I don’t remember, but I’ll keep an eye out.”
Steve led Tony towards his own display which held his charcoals, his pencil sketches, and his large painting of the ocean featuring the merman in question.
Steve rolled his eyes, “Ah yes! The mermaid’s kiss!”
“Tony, it’s okay. You didn’t offend me or anything.”
Tony’s face lit up and he threw the book open. “Steve! This is amazing! Ahh!” Steve blushed and stared at his lap. Tony continued his excitement, “I don’t even know what these are, but they are soooo cool!”
“Man, Steve. You can’t go around saying stuff like that! You don’t know what the locals have seen!” Peggy’s face grew serious as she cleared the plates from the table.
“What?”
check me out on instagram @arc.shield! ;))))
Steve looked him up and down. Tony looked small and frightened like a mouse. His cheeks were tinged pink. Though his eyes were soft, Steve could see the red rings like Tony had been crying. Steve had a sudden impulse to comfort Tony, to wrap him up in his arms and never let go. Steve was taken aback by this sudden feeling and turned away from Tony.
“You don’t say much, do you?”
“Yeah, I am.”
Tony paused, “How is that bad news?”
“Well, first things first, I’m Tony Stark. I’m a merman, if you couldn’t tell. I guess I decided to throw caution to the wave and expose myself to you.” Steve snickered at Tony’s funny way of talking. “What? What’s funny?”
Steve picked up what looked like a little scroll and unrolled it. It read, “18:30, 06/16”Steve realized it was in military time and that the date was today’s date. He smiled and shoved the note into his pocket. He would finally get to meet the face.
Steve felt like utter shit. He made Tony upset, he disappointed everyone, he lied to his friends. All the emotions that were pent up inside were slowly bubbling up to the surface and threatening to spill out.
One Saturday morning, Peggy had work and Peter had a playdate so Steve had the day to himself. He put on his swim trunks, some flip flops, and put his sketchbook and sea shell in his bag. He felt weird returning to the cove and made sure not to get his hopes up for seeing anything. He made his way down the beach smiling at the familiar faces he now knew. Some people even stopped him to chat. They would ask about school and New York and his art. Steve appreciated the gesture, but ended the conversations quickly and kept walking.
“Well, you guys are up early. Oh, Steve.” Peggy shook her head. Steve had fallen back asleep on the couch with his phone turned on in his hand despite the large cup of coffee and wake up shower. “How are you, Tony?”
“I’m so sorry guys.”
“It’s okay, you’re not used to human customs,” Steve muttered the next part under his breath, “or reproductive parts either.” Steve sighed and trudged back into the kitchen.
“Partners?”
“Pull out the sunblock and save me a spot on the beach because I’m comin’ to California!”
He walked over and said, “Are you Peggy Carter?”
And Tony continued on, encouraged by Steve’s blush and sputtering rather than put off by it. “What’s wrong, Rogers? Cat got your tongue? Or has someone else laid claim to it?”
“We could have just pretended you didn’t know how much of a mess I was,” he huffed.
A devilish smirk spread across Bucky’s face. He was fully aware of what he was doing. Truth be told he had been plotting with Nat about all the ways they could organically help Steve and Tony recognize how much they cared about each other. They had agreed that they could not force it into conversation, because the goal was not to push them before they were ready. However, he was not able to resist now—Tony had come to him after all and Tony was the one who brought up Steve and his own jealousy issues. This was too easy.
“Captain—will all due respect—I do not think you’d know what to do with one this big,” Thor jested, summoning a massive lightning blast onto the hoard that was headed their way. They disappeared into ash and blew away in the wind.
“You know what? You little shit—for your information—we’re not,” Tony said matter-of-factly.
Rhodey laughed a hollow laugh. “Yeah, okay Tones. I know you and Rogers kissed last night, the jig is up.”
“Huh? Why?”
And that’s all it took for the invisible wire holding Tony back to snap.
Tiberius looked stunned for a moment, visibly shaking in his chair, but he recovered. His eyes narrowed into a piercing glare but its effect was lost on Steve. “How precious—Stark sent his big puppy guard dog after me. He was too scared to come after me himself, so he had to send his secret lover to go do the job.”
“I’m trying it out.” Steve shrugged.
Why had he been anxious to meet Steve, all those years ago, when he first came up from the ice? Was it because Howard never shut up about him—his precious experiment—friend—the perfect hero? Was it because before Tony had ever met Steve it had already been engrained into his mind that he was perfect? Howard seemed convinced that Steve was flawless and Tony was anything but.
Bruce opened the box to find a large Christmas sweater, made big enough to fit him perfectly, that was a beautiful red. He rubbed the fabric between his fingers—it was divinely soft.
“Seriously—thank you Pepper.”
“I got a reading on Tiberius instantly. He’s a user. A social climber. And everything he does is for his own best interest only. He might be a sociopath. I warned Tony to stay away from him, but you can imagine he did not take too kindly to that. Especially coming from his new secretary who had never had a real conversation with Tiberius before. And given that Tiberius had been his friend for over thirty years…anyway. Once Pepper kissed him, he kicked Tiberius to the curb. I was overjoyed and hoped I would never have to see his slimy face again. Clearly, that was foolish of me.”
“Tony, the gala starts in a little under two hours. Where’s Steve?” Pepper asked, walking into the living room of the Avengers compound. She paused between the kitchen and the living room, stopping to fix her earrings and necklace. She was wearing an elegant black gown—Pepper was never one to shy away from dressing up for a special occasion.
Thankfully, everyone in his life had worked extremely hard to keep his AA meetings and divorce away from reporters as much as humanly possible. There was still a brief attempt here and there, but none of them ever stuck.
“Steve! You’re late!” Tony shouted over the sound of the drill he was using. “You’re usually here hours ago.”
“You know I’m not that great at the talking part of this stuff.”
“Okay—listen, I know we don’t usually do big parties because—well, actually, I don’t know why we don’t,” Scott said, frowning. “They’re great. A great idea. And don’t worry—we will do Secret Santa so there’s no pressure to spend money on everyone. Tony—that’s especially a warning for you. Only a present for the one name you draw.”
“I doubt that, Cap. You could give me some cardboard and I would be happy. Which, judging by the shape and size of this, I’m not entirely sure you haven’t given me cardboard,” Tony laughed.
“Yeah well, you mean a lot to me too, kid,” Tony replied. He squeezed Peter’s shoulders again before playfully shoving him away. “You’re the best babysitter I could ever ask for.”
Finally, Tony caved. He picked up his phone and dialed Rhodey.
Steve just laughed, stepping under the ropes and out of the ring. He wiped the sweat off of his brow and took a giant chug of water before responding to her.
His shield successfully took the brunt of Stane’s blast, but before he had managed to get all the way to Tony a portion of it hit him firmly in the side. The rest of the blast reflected off the shield and obliterated what was left of the corner wall.
“Tony.”
“Okay, okay. I’ll confess, I’ve brought you here because I have something on my mind. Well, I’ve had something on my mind for a long time. Years, even. Sometimes it’s been just an occasional thought in the background…and then other times, it is right at the forefront, screaming for my constant attention,” Tony explained.
Steve knew their half-hearted apology before the Time Heist was not sufficient. He had lived for years carrying the weight of his regret for what transpired between them. What apology could ever suffice for the unforgivable act of slamming his shield into Tony’s chest?
Pepper and Morgan pay a visit, Tony and Steve watch Harry Potter, Peter drops by, and an Avengers Family hang-out ends in disaster.
“Better late than never, right? That’s the bullshit saying?” Tony said, weakly laughing. “For what it’s worth, I accept your apology too, Cap. I forgive you.”
“Jesus—fuck Steve! When did you become so sneaky?!” Tony screamed, grabbing his chest and breathing heavily.
He had had enough of tiptoeing around everything important.
Tony’s eyes wandered over to the boxing ring in the center of the room where Steve and Bucky were currently sparring. He was hyper aware of the ways that Bucky was making Steve laugh and smile, even in the middle of a spar, with ease. It seemed so natural—their interactions, the laughter, and their ability to anticipate the other’s next move as they fought.
When Steve made no movements to leave, Tony looked up at him, “You’re staying, right?”
Once both of their shirts were off, the feeling of their skin on skin erased any sense of insecurity Tony had been worried about before. Instead, he eagerly leaned up and started kissing along Steve’s neck—pausing to suck and bite, leaving marks even though they would disappear in a few minutes. Sometimes the serum was more of a pain in the ass than anything else, Tony mused.
Tony looked down at her, completely mystified by how this tiny and brilliant little human was his daughter. He smiled. “Yes?”
Sometimes, in his weakest moments, Steve imagined how things might have turned out if he had been honest with Tony about his parents long before they ever got to Siberia. He knew, without the shadow of a doubt, that Tony would have forgiven Bucky. He would have known it was Hydra and that Bucky was a pawn in their scheme.
When they were in the elevator heading up from the garage under the compound, Steve finally broke the silence.
It was still achingly fresh in his mind—the moment they all came back to 2023 and Nat, falling to her knees, sobbing. Steve was certain her tears did not stop for days while Tony, Bruce, and Rocket worked on building the Iron Gauntlet.
Tony’s heart felt like it had come to a complete stop for ten seconds too long. If the Arc Reactor was still in his chest, he would have been convinced that it quit working and the shrapnel had finally taken him. But he didn’t fall over dead, so he must have been imagining it. His mouth, he slowly realized, was gaping open and closed like a fish out of water. It was a bizarre feeling—being at a loss for words—it was not something he could remember experiencing. At least not in a long time.
“If you’ve got something to say, you can share it with the rest of the class,” Tony said, snarky as ever, despite his brutal hangover.
Was he honestly that weak? His vice offered up to him and he did not even bother to utter a word of protest? Tony liked to think he was stronger than that but—apparently, not.
The raid on Strucker’s base, and the horrific vision Tony saw while there, was still painfully fresh in his mind. Not even an Avengers Tower full of party guests, alcohol, and pulsing music could distract Tony from the horrors he saw—the death of all those dearest to him, because he couldn’t save them.
Oh. Right.
Sam shrugged.
Ever since his conversation with Tony the other day, Steve had been getting progressively more and more comfortable with admitting that to himself. It was a glaring truth that he had been painfully aware of before Siberia, but he let that desire freeze over in the snow when he walked away that day.
He couldn’t tell for sure under her suit’s helmet, but he thought she was frowning. The two of them had bonded over a lot of similar background—shitty fathers, struggles with alcohol, loneliness and abandonment issues. He knew if anyone was going to get where he was coming from right now it would be her.
“I know, but still,” Peter whined.
“You okay?” Bucky asked.
He dug his nails into his thigh and frowned deeply. Nat patted his hand.
“You’re lonely,” Sam said, taking a sip of his water.
“Are you upset, Pepper? God—this is fucked up, isn’t it? This is terrible of me,” he whispered.
“Uh—who with?” Tony continued, fearful of going down this path, but if Steve didn’t enjoy the date, then what was the harm?
Steve looked at her, just his eyes visible over the newspaper he was reading and held her gaze. They sat in silence, a stand-off to see who would break first, but they both knew it would be Steve who gave in.
And Tony's recklessly going in without any idea of what's waiting for him inside.
Damn it, I can do this.
“It’s been a long time,” Tony started, sipping his water and raising an eyebrow in Ty’s direction.
“I’m glad we didn’t have sex last night. I want to do this right. You, me—date night. Dress nice, I’m taking you out on a proper date tonight,” Tony said. He slipped out of Steve’s arms, kissing him on the cheek, before confidently sauntering off to his walk-in closet.
Steve considered this for a moment—could he truly be missing a piece of the puzzle that was this big? After a decade of pining after Tony Stark, was there actually a possibility that his feelings were returned? It did not seem likely—he and Tony, even after all this time, were opposites. In many ways they were contradictory to one another—Tony was the futurist and Steve was a relic of the past, even as he had grown to adapt to the modernity of the world he woke up in. At the end of the day, Tony was brilliant, suave, and charming—lightyears out of Steve’s league. All it took was a look at the people Tony had dated long-term—Pepper, especially, who embodies beauty, sophistication, and charm herself—to recognize that Steve did not fit in among them. If someone lined up all of Tony’s lovers and put Steve in the mix, he would drastically stand out.
“Oh, on the contrary, it is going to be fantastic.”
He knew it was prideful to feel this way—but he wanted to share the updates of his private life with his friends when he determined he was ready to. Tony knew that logically they were Pepper’s friends too and it was also her news to share at her own discretion. But the Avengers—as selfish as it was—they were
“Well, even if she didn’t, the rest of the world was screaming about it. I do have an iPhone, Steve. And I actually know how to use mine,” Bucky said. “Go on.”
“You’re walking in on us post-argument,” Tony lied.
“Yeah—your room. Okay. Good.”
“Thank you for tonight, Tony. For the art, but also for taking me somewhere so special to you—somewhere you used to go with Jarvis. That’s…that’s really personal. And I really love knowing those things about you—seeing them, partaking in them. It means a lot to me,” he said softly.
“So, what’s wrong?” Bucky asked. “You said you were stuck in your head.”
“Tony and I made out last night and then went back to his room and fell asleep in his bed together. And this morning he said that he was going to take me out on a proper date tonight,” Steve rambled, the nervousness bubbling over to the point where he could not keep it inside any longer.
“Okay, listen, I’m a dead man for showing you this and letting you in, but if Tones gets laid from it, maybe he won’t be so angry,” Rhodey said, showing Steve the not-a-door-door that led to Tony’s secret workshop.
“Just saying.” Peter shrugged and stuffed his mouth with more food.
Tony leaned into Steve completely but his smaller frame was easy for him to support. They got to Tony’s room and Steve helped him into bed. He stepped away and returned with a glass of water and a bottle of Tylenol that he set on Tony’s bedside table.
“Alright, so what’s this about new web tech?” Tony asked. He decided to scream at him about Scorpion later.
“I—I don’t know. He left the room a bit ago to take Friday offline. And since then I haven’t had eyes on the building. Without Friday I’ve been cowering in here blind,” Pepper sobbed, the stress of the moment finally reaching her.
“I just know where you’re going with this, Nat. There’s no point.”
“Are you okay?”
“Of course. Wouldn’t miss it for the world,” he replied, scowling at Steve when Morgan leapt out of his arms to go tell Peter the good news. Steve burst into roaring laughter when he saw Tony’s face.
But there was that simultaneous feeling that in some way he would ruin Morgan’s life if he and Pepper did not work things out and stay together.
I’m sorry I have been giving you the cold shoulder. That’s not something I should do, not after the night we spent together…well, you remember. (I hope.)
“Where’s Stark?” Thor asked, never one to shy away from asking the obvious questions.
As they barreled into the penthouse Carol tossed Steve with one arm towards Tony and Pepper—Tony who was now out of his suit like the idiot he was—while firing a powerful photon blast out of her other hand at Stane.
“Friday—close the curtains,” he growled.
And you could say I am taking the cowards way out writing this letter to just leave on your desk instead of speaking to you myself, but you’ve also made it abundantly clear you would rather not be in a room alone with me.
Steve and Tony attend the Stark Industries Gala as a couple.
“Well, it doesn’t quite make sense to show up fashionably late when you live in the party venue.”
“Come on Tony—you already know I know. I’ve been in the same room as you two—anyone who has knows,” Peter replied, wearing Tony’s shit eating grin with an alarming accuracy. He took another mouthful of pancakes.
Tony’s hand reached out and rested on Steve’s bicep, their chests now touching, the only thing keeping their lips apart: a battle of wills. They stood there, chests rubbing together as they both breathed heavily, silently waiting to see who would give in.
He considered indulging himself—letting his fantasies come to life, remembering the feel of Steve’s lips against his, and sliding his hand into his pants. He was able to consider this for less than a minute before the crippling fear of his inadequacies overwhelmed his fantasies. His anxieties—the deep seated fear that he ruined everything he touched—tumbled down like an avalanche. They suffocated out any semblance of hope.
“I’ll see you later, Tony.” And with that he left with Bucky, the two laughing about some inside joke that made a green jealous monster in the base of Tony’s spine awaken.
“And you know what else, Stone? I think you’re jealous—you’re pissed that Tony has grown to be better than you could ever hope to be. Tony’s a million times the person you are and it makes you furious, because you know you can’t drag him down to your level anymore. Tony’s the best goddamn man in this universe and it infuriates you, because you know you’re one of the worst.”
“We all know Tony’s your, uh, biggest fan,” she said, raising her eyebrows and smirking.
“It’s been quite the day, you know,” Tony whined. “I’m really distraught.”
“Don’t apologize, Steve. I actually really do appreciate it. I just didn’t want you to feel like I made you do that or anything,” Tony said, rubbing he back of his neck. “But thank you.”
Crunch.
Towards the end of Morgan’s day with Tony, she was passed out asleep in Steve’s lap, as they all sat on the family room sectional couch. Tony was sipping on a glass of iced tea, staring at Steve and his young daughter a few feet away on the couch, smiling smugly.
“God you’re beautiful,” he smiled. Nat rolled her eyes.
Tony found that even though the regeneration process had successfully repaired his wound, walking was still difficult, and he might need minor physical therapy to fully recover. The wound might be gone, but the muscle needed to gain some strength back. He ended up grateful that no one was around to watch him fall flat on his face on his way to the couch.
“Thank you for sharing, Tony,” Adam and the group said in unison.
Steve captures him into another kiss, surprising Tony by pushing his tongue into his mouth and exploring wildly. It was, hands down, the best kiss Tony had ever experienced (and he had experienced many kisses before.) He wrapped his body around Steve’s, who he knew he could trust to hold him steady, and utterly lost himself in the simple yet beautiful sensation of his lips.
Tony slowly starts to forgive himself and settle into what his life looks like now. And Steve becomes increasingly more aware of his feelings and where he's at.
“Saying that out loud Tony, that’s the first step to healing—you know that, right?”
“I think everyone knows you two need to fuck out your problems, so don’t pull the paragon of pure American ideals with me, Rogers,” Rhodey replied. “Just—go in there and figure this shit out. It’s breaking my heart to see Tones moping around like this.”
Tony turned around only to be met with Steve looking utterly dashing in a navy blue suit with black around the trim and a bowtie. He looked better than Tony had expected.
But the second he began considering sharing, even with Natasha, who he had known longer than the rest of the team—he slammed into a mental wall. The boundaries he set up to protect himself were oppressive even to himself.
Tony looked up, feeling Steve’s prolonged gaze on him, and caught his eye. They both felt the electricity crackling between them—this weight of things unsaid—the way they continued to tiptoe around everything important. He offered Steve a small smile and—
It had taken immense restraint to keep his distance throughout the party and not assert any sort of possession over Steve as he watched people line up to fumble all over him. Jealousy was not one of Tony’s best qualities, but he suffered from it regardless.
Nat sipped her coffee, watching Steve closely and considering how to respond to his question. She had seen the heartbreak plastered across his face when he realized that Tony broke his sobriety. And then she saw it get worse when he heard about Tony’s one-night stand. Natasha was not an idiot, far from it, and she had been aware of Steve’s feelings, albeit complicated ones, for Tony for a long time now. These feelings were anything but new, however, the divorce and Tony moving back into the compound had added new, strange layers to the entire situation.
This was officially the worst hangover of his life, Tony decided as he stumbled into the kitchen. It felt like a team of sculptors had taken ice picks to his skull. The pounding was what he assumed it would feel like to get repeatedly bashed in the head by the Hulk’s fist. Pain was usually something he could bear, hell, hangovers were something he had thought he had mastered—he was wrong. Apparently, your first hangover after your longest period of sobriety ever was murderous.
A man who caught a glimpse of the kiss came at Tony—raising his fist and his voice—throwing homophobic slurs their way. Steve caught his hand with ease, twisting his arm around until the man was squealing in pain.
“He ended up dating Sharon, so don’t even go there,” Rhodey interrupted and Tony snapped his mouth shut. “You know he cares about you deeply Tony. I would venture to say he even loves you, god help him.”
“Get out of my room!”
A short and simple brushing off what happened between them sufficed when the Time Heist was at stake, but that could only last for so long. In the weeks of the Time Heist they had worked together as partners better than ever before, but even those side-by-side victories could not undo the damage done by a shield in the chest.
“And some of us don’t like using that money because it doesn’t feel right.”
Tony bristled, aware that he was being obvious and that Bucky was giving him the benefit of the doubt. The tension and anxiety was rolling off of him in waves. “Yeah—okay, I know I’m not being very subtle about this. But I owe you an apology—and no, not just because Natasha threatened to break my wrist if I didn’t—I really do owe you one. For my comments the other night, yes, but also for holding what happened to my parents over your head.”
“Alright, that’s enough lude stories in front of the children,” Nat said, smirking, and nodding towards Peter and Scott. This only caused Tony to start chuckling.
“Oh my mom—she did her best. But my father…he was an awful man, a monster—he abused her, my sisters, me—yeah. She did her best. I loved her,” he replied.
“Well that’s just—“
I wish you saw yourself the way I saw you. Tony, to me, you’re perfect.
“It’s just not usually like me to not jump the bones of a beautiful blonde the second I get them into my bed,” Tony purred, scooting closer to Steve’s body. Each soft kiss Steve pressed to his knuckles and the palm of his hand made his stomach flutter.
The section was a lot larger than the other one. There were books on medieval, post modern, and religious art. Steve found a book that had a lot of impressionist paintings in it explaining the history of each one. Steve decided to splurge on the expensive art book and bought both.
“Really?” Steve said rolling his eyes.
When they were done, Steve grabbed Tony and dragged him to the one place Steve had left out on their town tour from a few days back; The Mermaid Museum where this whole crazy journey had started.
Steve didn’t turn to face Tony. He couldn’t. Not when he had messed up so royally that Tony had left with no comment. Steve was crushed.
“It’s nice to meet you, Peter. Where are your parents?”
“Welcome to the park. It’s a human place where people can hang out. This specifically is the area for kids, but you’re never too old in my book to play on the playground. Especially not the swings. When I was little I used to jump on and swing as high as I could then jump off to see how far I could land.”
Steve saw a book on the engineering of planes and cars.
“Well, it’s lovely to meet you Steve.” Peggy extended her hand and shook with a firm grip. “Can I help you with that?” Peggy pointed at the large suitcase Steve was carrying with him.
“I’m doing well mom.”
They shook hands and made quick introductions before all heading into Sandy’s. Inside, Peggy was talking with Sandy.
“Interesting.” Steve hadn’t known that Peggy had grown up here as well. “Can we go?”
“How are you feeling?” Steve asked, admiring the view.
Peggy threw her dishrag at him, “SHUSH! I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU A STORY! Okay, anyway, no one believed him at first and dismissed him. He showed them a strange mark on his lower back, but everyone brushed it off as a bruise. That was until a large yacht went out to sea on a stormy night!”
Steve was caught off guard but managed to reply with, “Uh, sure?”
Natasha put a hand on Tony's leg, "Tony, we don't even know if he will have memory loss. The doctors have no way to confirm until he wakes up."
Peggy patted him on the shoulder, “Would love to stay and chat, but I have to go to work.”
Peggy stood up, “I know this is going to sound cheesy, but we are all here for one reason. Steve. Well the art too, but mostly Steve. You have brought all these lovely people together. Some new friends, some old. You have brought art, joy, friendship, love. Thank you for everything Steve. Thankfully, the summer is not over, but it feels like you’ve been with us for our whole lives. To Steve!”
By noon, Tony and Bucky, surprisingly, were both feeling a bit under the weather so they took a break by riding the Ferris Wheel. Bucky and Nat were in one seat while Tony and Steve took the other. Nat winked at Steve before they were hoisted into the air.
“Steve I swear to god if you interrupt me one more time, I’m kicking you out of this house!”
“Tony I wish I could stay. I have to go to a board meeting but I came to give you this.”
Steve shrugged and walked up to the counter where Sandy had started making their sandwiches.
“I’ll think about it.”
Tony shrugged, “Whatever you say. He won’t even look or talk to me these days. No I haven’t been the friendliest either but I have reasons.”
! We’ll talk about this later. Please.” Natasha’s voice was sharp and her eyes were piercing the back of Tony’s scalp.
Steve trudged over to the door to find Bucky and Nat.
Tony looked down at his tail and looked back at Steve, “No, no. I don’t think so.”
“Rule number two, you are young and vulnerable. Don’t come out here without someone watching you. Okay?”
“Oh. Okay. Sorry for asking.”
The two stepped inside and their eyes fell on Tony who was still on the couch waiting patiently for instructions.
“Well when you didn’t send any confirmation of your arrival I started getting worried.”
“Well, I guess I have nothing else to say.”
“Alrighty. Let’s get going.”
“Pete, what are you doing here?” Steve was shocked to see the little kid standing with a young woman who looked a little older than Peggy. She had long brown hair and a sweet smile.
Tony looked at Steve, “Yeah. You guys don’t have that?”
“Thank you.”
“I’m doing okay, thank you.”
“No. Just wondering how much time I have left,” Tony replied seriously.
“Buck, just give him a chance. The kid is new at this.” Natasha winked at Steve.
Tony nodded and off the boys went to the pier. Tony still had a slight frown to his face despite the happy morning they were having together. Plus, Tony didn’t even know what Steve had planned for the night.
When he returned to the house he showered and got ready to go explore the city. He made sure to keep the shell on him to compare to the knicknacks they had in their stores. Steve grabbed his wallet and headed out. He had no car so he walked the three miles in.
“I wish you didn’t have to leave.” Tony said solemnly.
“Very.” Peggy was about the leave, but she turned and said, “Erm, Steve, I’m going to be late tonight so feel free to either order food or eat whatever’s in the fridge. My day off is tomorrow so we’re hanging out. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Yeah I’m coming in a week and stayin’ for a few weeks. Get ready for surfing and babes. I can’t wait.”
Steve didn’t know what to say. In front of him was a real life merman…
“What’s a count-ee fare?”
The conversation had switched tones from what the function of a dog was to relationships.
“Tony, you can’t be mad at that. We are all a little stressed right now. It was completely understandable and Steve will see that once he gets his memories back.”
“Huh. I think it would be fun.”
The cove was empty and sun was now high above the horizon. Steve remembered what Tony had said about loving human science and decided to take a trip into town.
“Tony,
Steve admitted he had become interested in the mermaid legends before he met Tony which prompted a lengthy explanation of the history of the merpeople. Steve got a chance to fawn over famous artists while Tony simply listened even though he didn’t really understand what Steve was saying.
Sandy chuckled, “You silly boy. He’s afraid of losing you.”
“That would be helpful.”
“Guys, I appreciate the open discussion, but this is my life. I can make my own decision.”
Steve rolled his eyes, “Sure. That’s what everyone says.”
“What are you doing here?” Steve asked gruffly. He realized that he was feeling something even though he wasn’t punching a bag or running on a treadmill.
“Bye!”
“Thank you.”
He finally responded with more confidence, “Steve, I get that you’re a little untrusting right now, but I know you better than anyone. I will defend you if I have to.”
"I'm making one of those" He suddenly blurted out.
“Well, I don’t really know what those are, but they made you really smart.”
The night passed quickly and Steve was back at home knowing a lot more about Tony than the night before. He was happy.
Steve led Tony to his room and tried to pick clothes that would fit him. It was hard because Steve was taller and built a little bigger as well. In the end, Tony was wearing one of Steve’s tighter fitting shirts, but it just looked average on Tony. The shorts were a bit harder as Steve didn’t know his… size. Or anything like that.
Steve laughed and responded, “These are cars and planes. We humans use them to get places.”
“No, I think it’s cute.” Steve froze. He did
Steve began to spend most of his day working out, boxing, doing some sort of physical activity to stimulate his brain. The more he worked the more he remembered anger, disappointment, sadness, loss. As the negative emotions came flooding in, he cut himself off, became cold, and spent all day boxing to feel something. There were days were Steve would punch the bag so hard it flew off the chain. More often than not Steve would break down crying until someone heard him and came to his rescue.
“Oh. I have no idea what she looks like.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Peter you gotta go! Do you want me to take you back?”
“What? You don’t even own the cove! How can you make rules?”
The boys celebrated their successful transportation with lunch at Sandy’s. They made light small talk and Steve did his best to avoid the fact that Tony would only have his legs for a few more hours. There seemed to be a permanent frown on Tony’s face that even human objects couldn’t fix.
Out of her apron, she pulled a small polaroid of a blur of colors and shapes. Steve could make out the vague shape of a tail and people on a boat.
“What are you guys doing here.”
“You don’t?” Peggy said with a smile on her face.
“What is this place?”
“How about you, sweet pea?”
And with that Peggy went about her morning business and Tony let Steve sleep. Even though he didn’t know very much about humans yet, he realized that humans need a lot more sleep than merpeople do.
I think I'll try to post every week or so. Hope you're enjoying it!
Steve left the cove and made his way back to Peggy’s house. This time he didn’t run fast but slowly jogged and enjoyed the quiet morning. Steve watched the ocean and thought he saw a tail that was too big to be a fish, but too small for a whale. Steve recalled Peggy’s story about seeing a mermaid tail. Steve brushed it off as a dolphin tail or simply his imagination.
“When I say I have never experienced something like that in my life, I am not exaggerating. This is what humans do for fun???”
Steve waved. Tony could have died right then. When he looked into Steve's eyes he saw nothing there. Not the usual loving look or the knowing eyes when Tony did something stupid. They were blank and Tony couldn't bear to look at him.
“Well let me tell you a story. A long time ago, before you were born, I was young. I was carefree and careless. I went out on a boat with my friends. We didn’t think twice about it. It got dark, we were going to rely on the lighthouse to guide us. That night, there was a power outage and we crashed. I personally thought I was going to die.
“It usually is.”
“I guess you’ll have to show me some day.”
“Of course dear.”
“Me? No way. I’ve always got my head in the bubbles and no one wants to hear me ramble about humans. My dad keeps trying to set me up with some mermaids, but every one he picks is so… boring.” Tony was staring at a sea crab making its way down the beach. “How about you?”
When Steve got bored of lounging around, he decided to take a walk down the beach. It was a nice day, but he had no interest in swimming. Steve never understood the fascination with the ocean. Maybe it was because he had grown up in a place where the beach wasn’t super prevalent, but Steve preferred land.
The big group, including Tony, congregated in the corner where everyone sat down with plates of food and lots of chatting. Steve looked over at Tony who just looked plain awful.
“Um, anyway. My thought on the whole magic thing was that in this movie called
“Um, what is this place?”
Steve laughed and replied, “Man, I wish you could come on land and see the world. You would love it. I know I’ve gotten used to it cause that’s my life, but it’s really cool sometimes.”
Steve replied, perhaps too enthusiastically,“Yeah! Of course. Same time tomorrow?”
“The brain remembers everything. Just because you can’t recall a memory doesn’t mean it’s not there!”
Tony paused for a second. “Not yet.”
“I have to go.”
“Any science in particular?”
Tony put his precious memories back into the safe, and for the first time in weeks went downstairs to eat dinner.
That night, they had a bonfire and made s’mores. Tony was so amazed at the concept of tiny dessert sandwiches. It was a great day, Steve knew that, but he knew it would be better if he just knew how Tony felt about him.
In his head Steve was questioning the logic, but he guessed it was part of the town’s charm.
“Anything with physics or engineering.”
“What? No. Please.”
Peggy handed Steve a glass of water and orange juice.
“No way!”
“Then, you and the person you like do things together alone, usually, and you get to know the other person and have fun. First dates are always scary because you never know what will happen or what you will learn about the other person.”
Tony and Steve settled on asking questions back and forth. Some very personal, some very shallow. Steve said things that no one had ever heard except Bucky. He wasn’t worried about telling Tony because they pretty much lived in different worlds so it wasn’t like his secrets could get out. Plus, Tony was trustworthy. He had secrets himself. At times they were extremely serious and Tony would make direct eye contact with Steve that would make his heart skip a beat. Other times they were giggling at something stupid and light hearted.
“Thanks,” Tony replied coolly. Tony seemed so unbothered by Steve’s blatant mess up that Steve was almost sad. He didn’t even flinch or blush or anything.
“Yes, but a lady can’t take a five minute break?”
The big oak door shut behind her with a thud. Steve finished his juice and went to kill some time. The boy had been occupying his thoughts since he saw him, so Steve decided to go to the cove. He felt like he needed to go back and make sure he wasn’t imaging. Steve threw on some shorts and his running shoes and put his sketchbook in a small drawstring bag.
“Thanks Pep.”
More italics of memories, but also thoughts of the character. Sorry for all the different uses :/
She rolled her eyes, but nodded in agreement. “He’s right, Steve. Relationships are not all sunshine and rainbows, especially not when they’re new and you’re figuring things out. But you and Tony have chosen to do this—and you two have never half-assed anything when it has come to the other one—including damn near killing each other over miscommunication and misplaced priorities.”
Steve’s eyes were stuck staring at Tony’s lips as he talked. There was a warmth in the pit of his stomach that was not there earlier. His body was leaning in towards Tony’s—as if his friend had some sort of magnet the was drawing him in.
“Sharon and I agreed it is best to stay friends,” Steve snapped, dropping a plate of food down in front of Bucky.
Steve walked over, placing the tray of food on the coffee table in front of the workshop couch, and perched himself on the armrest nearest to Tony’s feet. But Tony decided to be stubborn and dramatic—draping his arm over his eyes and not moving an inch.
He closed his eyes and the breath he let out was uneven. This was Nat—his family—he knew that being open with her was safe. But the nagging voice in the back of his head reminded him that saying it out loud to someone else made it more real. It made his failures a topic for public discussion. His stomach knotted up.
“That was easy,” she quipped. “I think we’re getting the hang of this Avengers stuff, boys.”
“Sorry—it wasn’t really Mr. Stark’s fault we were late. It was mine and then we hit traffic on the way here and—“
“Steve, are you okay? You’re far from the clumsy type,” he started, frowning with intensity.
“Thank you.”
Steve sighed.
“Yeah, yeah, I’ll keep that in mind next time,” Steve replied, pouring them both a glass of water once they reached the kitchen.
They were almost to the top when they heard the first repulsor shot ring out over the comms. Bile rose up in the back of Steve’s throat at the idea of Tony or Pepper injured.
To each their own.
“You speak Italian,” Steve said, pointing out the obvious like he tended to do.
“Alright, time for bed,” he mumbled. And if he touched himself to the thought of a particular super soldier with gorgeous blue eyes before falling asleep, well, no one needed to know.
“You haven’t checked the news recently, have you?” Steve asked.
“Language!” Steve shouted and Tony doubled over in a fit of laughter.
He just nodded, the man who always had something to say, out of words.
“Sorry boss—it was my conclusion that you were not in a healthy headspace and therefore a friend checking in on you would be beneficial,” Friday’s calm voice responded.
A solid punch from Bucky’s metal arm collided with Steve’s cheek. He stumbled back into the ropes of the training ring, his hand flying up to rub the growing red mark on his face.
“Yes, really, don’t be a dick about it,” she laughed. “Even though things with Pepper are…over, and hard, you are being incredibly strong about it.”
He strode across the room and stepped behind the podium, tapping the mic to make a loud noise throughout the expansive room to grab everyone’s attention. The conversation faded to silence and everyone turned their attention to Tony Stark. While many people in the room were close friends and colleagues of Tony’s, a massive amount of the guests were strangers to him—friends of friends, potential donors, political supporters—so this speech mattered.
“Earth to Steve,” Nat repeated, now waving her hand in front of his face. “Hello?”
“Come in,” Tony slurred, sounding too cheery for someone who had stormed out of the living room not long ago.
Bucky’s words haunted him for the rest of that day—even when he was sparring with Nat in the gym. At one point he got so lost replaying Bucky’s comment in his mind that Nat seamlessly landed a right hook.
“See, ol’ Buckaroo savagely murdered my parents and Steve found out. Now, what does Steve do? Steve, my best—“ the words get choked up in his throat. “Well, instead of trusting me enough to tell me, he keeps it from me. And we part ways in Siberia after he and Bucky tag team beat the shit out of me and it ends with a spangled shield in my chest, nearly killing me, actually.”
“I think Pepper and I are done, kid.”
“Well yeah, I mean aren’t I—nevermind. Anyway, my bad.”
When Steve gently peeled himself out of Tony’s bed and wandered into the living room, his spirit shattered. It crushed him to see Tony crying—something he had never witnessed before even in all their years of friendship.
“I’m not really worried about the news story,” she replied. “I’m worried about how Tony is going to handle this. He was unusually shaken up about it.”
“Much.”
“I’ve come to the realization that I have feelings for Captain America,” he said, sounding entirely displeased and burdened by the whole thing. Tony was about to continue, but Pepper started to chuckle on the other end of the phone.
“Speaking of, I joined an AA group,” he groaned.
Maybe Bucky had a point.
“I’ve, got to uh, step away for a moment. I’ll be right back,” he explained, setting his beer down on the edge of the pool table and walking off without further comment.
“Yeah that’s uh, been my entire point,” Sam chuckled.
Steve broke their kiss to slip out of his bomber jacket and Tony sat up at bit while Steve worked his leather jacket off, too. Tony unbuttoned Steve’s dress shirt quickly—the skillfulness of his mechanic’s fingers coming incredibly handy. They shucked it off to the side with Tony’s AC/DC shirt that Steve eagerly yanked off—almost ripping it in the process.
“I mean—I may have asked a certain super soldier for some advice but…yeah,” Sam chuckled.
What came out of his mouth, “We should start spending more time together. Y-you know, uh, like we used to. Before…”
“It is now,” Nat replied, kicking off her heels and cozying up on the other side of Steve. Rhodey sat on the other side of Tony, draping his arm around him, and kicking his feet up on the ottoman.
