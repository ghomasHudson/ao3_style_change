Tony’s expert and sure of himself, and this isn’t Steve’s first rodeo either, but in the beginning it feels weird that he’s not really bobbing his head or even sucking or anything, he’s just swallowing around Tony’s cock over and over, saliva dribbling out of the corner of his mouth while he presses his nose into Tony’s pubic hair and there’s nothing else, nothing else at all, there’s just—
Tony’s voice is very tiny. “You… you don’t want me anymore?”
“Steve. Sleep.”
He’s done some calculations. He remembers the night it happened. Tony thought he still had a couple of days before his heat, so they didn’t use protection. But they were never that careful, truth be told, and Tony’s heats had been irregular for a few months.
He comes in Tony’s mouth and Tony comes in his at the same time, and Steve lets his throat work so he doesn’t waste a drop of what he’s given. But then he feels only air around himself while Tony slips out of him quietly, and all of a sudden hopelessness blossoms in the middle of Steve’s chest, and he almost thinks that he could cry.
Steve gestures for Tony to come into the room and Tony does, without saying anything, without really looking at Steve. He sits on the edge of Steve’s bed, fiddles with his tinted glasses in his hands for a few moments and then puts them in his pocket, sighs.
“Tony, I’m so sorry.”
“You think?”
again.”
He nods at her. That thing is amazing, it basically turns the armor invisible.
find it, Steve. I will find the best burger in the world.”
I cough out the pain I’m still able to feel.
His own dick is throbbing between his thighs, heavy and dark, and he touches himself just for a second, just to take the edge off, but he comes all over Tony’s expensive suit pants, and he feels like crying because he loves Tony
, said like that, with so much certainty and decision and finality, it’s like a death sentence for Steve.
But maybe it’s not just the cold.
“What—” Confusion. Horror. In Steve’s voice. Then, Alpha instinct. Protection. “Tony, please, try to breathe. What kind of weapons—”
Steve slides down the bed and lies between Tony’s legs. He sucks at Tony’s inner thigh, mouths at his perineum. He presses a slick finger into Tony’s body, works at the sensitive muscles there, carefully, he doesn’t want to hurt Tony at all. Steve strokes Tony up and down a couple of times with his other hand, and he’s glad to notice that his erection is harder than usual.
The fireplace is dark and empty.
Steve has been sleeping in Tony’s bed every night in the past week. Which is great, Tony loves sleeping with a huge super-soldier attached to his back. It’s the best. But Steve wants to have sex every night
“I wanted to say it again.”
“She was good. She fell asleep, no fuss, and—”
Steve draws. It can’t be easy while the car is moving, but he doesn’t say anything.
, and you bond. There’s even a ritual with vows and handfasting, with no practical use except making the whole deal unnecessarily lyrical. It’s tradition and biology and social constructs all mixed together in a big, inextricable mess.
with him, this awkward confession about himself, this shameful and embarrassing weakness, this humiliating sign of age and change and mortality.
Tony slumps over, and Steve’s body is there, ready to catch him. Steve’s arms appear around Tony, holding him up. One hand caresses the nape of Tony’s neck.
, which has happened only a handful of times in the past, often when one of them was hurt in some way. It was never clearly forbidden, but it was always implicitly understood that Sarah couldn’t expect her dads to do certain things that regular parents would do, unless the severity of the situation required it. Stupidly, only now Tony really sees how wrong that was, how terrible it was to do that to his own kid, that he loves more than he could ever love anything else.
“There was no way he could’ve done it if he was still alive. I mean—if they thought he was still alive. Osborn knew that Tony would find a solution, he had tried to kill him already in the past, he just—”
It figures that what Steve does is something entirely different. But then again, he could always surprise Tony.
Tony looks at him for a while, at his face, and the miniscule wrinkle next to his right eye, at his long eyelashes, his pink lips, the flawless curve of his shoulder.
“Bye, Tones.”
They take a moment to laugh about it and diffuse the weird tension that talking about sex always creates between them.
“Nah, I just said, some people’s hearts still sing
“So,” he says, “you share clothes with Thor, huh?”
“Was fixin’ the… Wasn’t wearin’… suit—”
“How could we do this to her, Tony? We knew. And we—”
It’s the wrong thing to say. But Steve says it nonetheless. “Maybe I am.”
“Sure,” Steve says, and passes him a pencil and his sketchbook. Tony opens it, and scribbles something on the first blank page. When he’s done, he looks at the sketch on the other page, a doodle of Bucky and Natasha resting on a couch. He has his head in her lap, she’s stroking his hair. Tony brushes his fingers over it, over the place where Steve wrote
There’s nothing inside him, and Tony could swear all that emptiness is going to swallow him whole if he doesn’t fill it in the next second.
“Bye, Steve.”
years old. Which was stupid enough to begin with, if he’s being honest. Why would Steve even want him? After all their conflict? After Ultron, goddammit. This is Steve Rogers we’re talking about. Captain fucking America. Tony’s already lucky if an Alpha like Steve is okay with being in the same room as an Omega like him, or that he looked at him twice, or even spoke to him. If he’s honest, it’s a miracle that Steve is willing to work with someone like Tony at all. Truly a testament to the goodness of his heart. So why did he say yes when Tony asked him out? It makes no sense. He could have anyone, seriously,
Finally, Tony cries, and to add to the humiliation there’s saliva running down his chin and he can’t control it. He can’t do anything, even wiping his own mouth feels like too much work and everything is just—
“I’m sad you have to go so soon,” Stella says, “I’ll miss having you boys around. I didn’t even get a chance to make you try my ragù.”
“I’m gonna reach back into my bag and take my sketchbook, is that alright?” Steve asks quietly, every word enunciated clearly and slowly.
“You were... you were having a nightmare. I’m sorry I touched you, I tried to call you but... I just wanted to wake you up, I promise... I didn’t wanna hurt you, I wasn’t tryin’ to hurt you, I swear I swear I swear I swear—”
Tony thinks.
“Tony, I wanted to show you something,” Stella says when Tony sits back on the chair, fishing Mom’s letter out of the pocket of her dress. “Here, read this part,” she adds, pointing to a paragraph towards the end of a page she’s passed him over the table. Tony reads it.
Nothing, in their entire relationship, has mattered more than what Steve is going to say next, and he knows this like he knows his own name.
A bite mark that doesn’t fade. That only happens when the Alpha is dead. If the bond is neglected or broken then the mark isn’t renewed, and eventually it goes away. But Tony’s never went away. It’s his own version of what happened to Steve’s ruts.
“Yeah. Same here.”
Tony gets up and rearranges their positions. He kneels behind Steve’s head and reaches back up Steve’s body, towards his cock. In a flurry of skin and harsh breaths Steve suddenly finds Tony’s dick pushing past his lips, while Tony’s mouth is around him again a second later.
“Yes. I trust you. Besides, no one is more qualified. Anyone else is either too inexperienced, too young, not of this planet, not human, a king, retired, recovering, not mentally adjusted, and so on. You know the threat better than anyone. You’ve got this.”
They sit on the stone wall and Steve passes Tony a few cherries.
“When he fell?”
), in Tony’s penthouse on the rug in front of the fireplace, in Tony’s penthouse on one of the bar stools, on a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, on
“You’re really full of surprises.”
“Mmh—” Tony groans. He feels his heart speed up in his chest, and he’s suddenly drenched in a cold sweat that wasn’t there a minute ago.
“Time heals all wounds,” Tony says, imagining someone else’s voice, a British accent.
“That’s the opposite of the truth. If anything, you become less and less like him,” Steve says, and when Tony scoffs, he raises his voice from the whisper it’s been so far. “You forget that I knew him. And I know you. And you’re nothing—listen to me—” he takes Tony’s shoulders between his hands and looks at him as if to drive the idea into Tony’s beautiful mind by the naked force of his stare. “You’re
Steve has Maria in his arms. One arm, actually. His big bicep supports her head just right. He’s pointing at the buildings outside through the glass wall and talking to her, explaining to her what this or that skyscraper is, what’s inside of them.
“Fuck.”
“Can we just—”
He smiles at the young woman greeting him. Chiara is her name. She tells him that the car keys are in the glove compartment of the car, as per his instructions. She gives him a card with a number to call in case of trouble and Tony can think of seven scenarios in which that could be useful.
“That’s usually my issue.”
Steve’s guilt and Tony’s grief mix together at the center of the bond. They transform into something else. The one soothes the other and vice versa; each of them acting as the cure for the other.
It always comes down to Steve in Tony’s life, in some way or another.
“So,” he says instead, a laugh brewing in his chest, “thirty-five, huh?”
In 1958 Maria Carbonell was twenty-one years old. She was smart, she loved science and music, she was beautiful.
I’ve been sentenced to death, like everyone else here. Like everyone else.
Tony grows rigid against Steve.
“Tony,” Steve breathes out, “oh my god, Tony.”
I’m strapped to a table.
“I did everything right. You were enslaved for the same amount of time, in the same place, under the same conditions. You fought in the games. I let the Knights use you in the same way he was used. And you’re still—”
“Yes, I... I mean... Goodbye, Tony,” he says in the end, resolute.
“I try. But I’m still the billionaire. While people starve.”
While Tony sets up the blanket outside to get some work done before lunch, Steve sets off down the hill, away from the main road. The sun makes him sweat pretty soon, but he doesn’t really feel warm.
But seriously, Tony thinks while he angrily closes tabs on the holoscreen, some people are too disgusting to even
He takes a deep breath. Time. They need time.
“What are you—”
A sob makes its way up Steve’s throat, and tears slip down his face and onto Tony’s fingers, hot and bitter and poisoned with Steve’s shame. He squeezes his eyes shut and grits his teeth to bear the sting of guilt spreading through him from his chest.
There’s only the bond in his mind, shining like a sun, and he’s grateful that he can find it so easily now. It was terrifying, before. Being alone, after Tony had been in his head again—
And in the blink of an eye it was a year or so later, and they spent three days together in the deserted compound, right before Steve had to leave for Lagos—the other Avengers already there for recon, Vision out to explore New York on his own, Steve staying back for a couple more days so he could attend the VA charity gala.
So yes, some articles tried to be helpful.
They sit on the couch.
“Yes. You alright?”
“Well, if it’s any consolation... it’s gone.”
“Sorry,” Steve says, and shuts the door softly.
“Tony—”
Instead, Tony reaches out to hold Steve’s face between his hands, attentive, almost tender. He shifts closer and inspects the wound on Steve’s forehead. Steve’s eyes, now free, wander downwards and linger there. Tony’s arms are still one of the most beautiful things about his body, and Steve remembers the hours spent in the workshop observing him work on the armor before they got together; he remembers how he’d stare at the veins under Tony’s skin, how the sweat would make him glisten like a piece of candy. He remembers Tony asking him for help moving something too heavy or lifting a car for him, and how Steve would seize those occasions to show off a bit, because the serum was useful for more than one thing, and Steve was still an unmated Alpha back then, bound to get silly around a handsome Omega like Tony.
didn’t you tell me?” Tony’s jaw clenches; his tone is cold and furious.
He may not be entirely new to his consent not being respected. And he may not like himself; he may not think of himself as worthy of some friendships, of the esteem of his colleagues, of Steve’s regard. Of that love that was just blossoming between him and Steve before Tony fucked it all up with betrayal. Tony may despise himself, but he’s pretty sure that whatever he did, he didn’t deserve
“I can’t—”
He swallows again.
It’s warm, but not wet enough. Steve stays there, without moving, waits for Tony to gather saliva into his mouth. When he’s ready, Steve buries his hand into Tony’s hair, looks at his fingers disappear between the silver strands. He grabs at it, yanks, makes Tony groan deep in his throat. He starts fucking Tony’s face slowly, but mercilessly.
“She’s so tiny,” he says, quietly. He seems scared he’s going to wake her up.
Steve fists his own hair, pulls at it until it hurts. Until Tony takes his wrists and forces him to lower his arms. Steve lets him.
“I promise. Let’s just try.”
“Là!”
Then, he remembers.
It’s like he has it written on his forehead.
“Steve, listen. I wanted to apologize for—”
“Right,” Steve agrees, and his nostrils flare with the breath he lets out.
He jolts awake, sits up on the bed to wrench his shoulder free from the hand touching it, but it’s only Steve. He tries to breathe, but all he can manage are shallow and irregular gulps of air.
They have lunch at a little restaurant tucked in a small alley. Tony orders pici cacio e pepe for them both, which Steve thinks are just thick spaghetti, but they taste different. They’re cheesy and there’s a lot of pepper in them. It kinda goes up Steve’s nose at some point, which makes Steve sneeze and Tony laugh.
The knowledge weighs on him at first, then it blazes through him and leaves him ashamed, needy, overwhelmed, and beyond incapable of keeping it together, of being decent and demure and worthy of an Alpha such as Steve.
Tony drives, and Steve is quiet in his seat. The sun is still up; the countryside appears still and silent, a desert full of hidden life. The wheat glimmers under the scorching light of the sun; the asphalt too. The trees are so motionless they seem painted against the empty sky.
But she deserved better than this. She deserved to be free of Howard, she deserved to let go of the weight of protecting Tony from the truth. She deserved a son who could handle her pain, who didn’t get scared by her tears, who didn’t force her to hide them.
Steve can’t move, but she understands him immediately, twisting on the bed to bury her face into Steve’s neck. He can feel her calm down against his body, and having her this close, being able to feel her hair on his face, her soft skin against his beard… it makes the pain tolerable for Steve.
“Relax,” Tony reminds him again.
“I don’t know. I guess we really always hoped that Siberia would not be the end. For us.”
Of course Steve saw right through him. Of course Captain America didn’t like
“First and foremost.”
“Come on,” Tony urges, and Steve rips the back of Tony’s pants with his fingers, pulls at the tear to make it larger.
“I knew Sharon when she was a kid, you know.”
more than anything else.
“‘M sor—”
They break seven of his ribs.
“Almost 1 p.m.”
, the light in his eyes would dim, something in his smile would falter and fall—as though each time he was piercing himself with the needle of the harshest self-judgement.
After lunch at the restaurant, they return to the blanket on the grass, and Tony falls asleep again. He’s resting on his side, an arm under his head, facing Steve.
Steve fucks him roughly and brutally, and Tony’s dick is trapped between his body and the tiles, and his skin is sticking to the wall and he—
Tony wishes he didn’t know how that feels.
He lowers his head to Tony’s chest and presses his face into it. He can’t see the reactor’s light from behind his closed eyelids. He used to be able to. He used to love that.
But denying himself his own nature is, weirdly, something necessary. Tony owes it to himself. It’s important, this thing he’s doing, so he keeps at it.
He wants Tony
“Don’t try to speak. It’s okay, don’t be scared. I’ll be with you soon.”
He rests a hand on the wood.
Maybe Steve’s right. Maybe what counts the most about this isn’t that they always fall apart for one reason or another, but that no matter what they always end up back together.
Howard has been very nervous lately, his work for the Pentagon is hard on his patience. Not that he's ever had much of it.
“Hey, hey… okay. We’re not talking about this. It’s fine.”
“Tony,” he says, and he feels dizzy, touching Tony’s face like he’s done countless times, but this time it feels like the first, like the only real one, the one that truly counts.
It took Steve two months to finally wash the sheets. He cried into the clean pillow case for an hour after realizing that there really was no trace left on it of anything resembling Tony’s scent.
Steve is starting to despair over whether or not it will ever go away.
“Yeah.”
He shakes his head again to clear away all the bad thoughts. He breathes out slowly a couple of times and concentrates on what he came to his bedroom for.
“Tony—”
Tony doesn’t reply. He tries to stifle a pained moan, and he’s not all that successful. Steve sighs and finally looks at Tony again. He sounds defeated when he says, “Okay. I’m sorry. You want to keep it to yourself—fine.”
He comes to the games. They say he’s back from a trip.
“I’ll let you drive.”
“I’m… I—”
“The book is on your phone. You should find it—”
Tony is in front of him.
God, wherever he is in his omnipotent silence, must be looking down on him and laughing his ass off.
“Terrible. You know Tony, maybe the name is apt. God, the nausea.”
Tony places one hand on Steve’s bicep, meaning
Tony lands in front of Natasha and Bucky’s Brooklyn apartment building and waits for the suit to retreat from over his body, waving a hand at a couple of kids passing by when they smile and point at him.
One of Steve’s hands slips between Tony’s thighs. He presses his fingers between Tony’s cheeks, against his hole, and only now Tony feels how wet the fabric of his pants is, and he can’t keep his humiliation from percolating through his pores.
That day when Steve touched Tony for the first time after their only night together, and it was by mistake, but Tony allowed him. That day when Tony told him that there was a possibility he could forgive Steve.
“There’s... there’s meat inside... inside the pasta. The, uh, the pasta is made with eggs, it’s not... it’s not regular pasta.”
“Thanks. I developed this nanotechnology… the bracelets are connected to my neural synapses, so I can activate the suit by thinking specific code words. I can access different models too.”
It can’t be. It’s impossible. What could have possibly happened for Tony to finally call him?
It’s like taking off your wet clothes after being out in the rain. Like someone wrapping a warm blanket around your shoulders, pushing a cup of coffee in your hand. It’s like sitting together in front of a fire while the storm rages outside.
Steve spanks Tony’s ass over and over, until Tony is crying again, until Steve comes for the last time and his dick finally softens a bit.
different. Erogenous zones and all that. And yes, Tony looks blissed out whenever Steve fucks into his mouth, but he’s pretty sure coming inside Steve made him feel a whole lot of new different things, from a purely sensual point of view.
He’s crying, silently. His tears could almost be mistaken for droplets of water.
“No, what if you—”
Steve is in love with Tony. Completely and impossibly so. He is so far gone on Tony that words can’t really describe it. Sometimes he feels like his heart is going to burst because of how much he would give up for Tony, to make him happy and to keep him safe. Anything, everything, for him. And he knows that Tony feels the same about him. And finally, after years of uncertainty, of pining, of desperation, of failed attempts at moving on, of convincing himself it was never going to happen, it has happened.
Something angry and displeased plays around Tony’s mouth. “They didn’t give you any food, did they? Hydra. I suspected, but then the doctors told me. They had to feed you through an IV.”
“Steve—”
“There are other options.”
The reactor works again. FRIDAY is back online.
Steve kicks the blanket away, swings his legs over the side of the bed, and Tony is hit by the smell of
There are scratches on him, in the shape of the man’s fingernails. Some of them are infected; they’re red and swollen and warm to the touch. Tony picks at the scabs.
“It’s going to be alright,” Tony murmurs, “everything’s gonna be alright.”
hard, because he spent a good portion of his life thinking (or wishing) that he would die. Soon.
“We’ll leave,” she says, “but only if you’re really sure about this, Tony.”
Steve catches him before he falls, makes him sit on the stone bench. He crouches down in front of Tony, between his thighs—familiar, now.
“Oh, yeah. Roberto. He’s a fellow engineer. A genius on his own right, really, his work with prosthetic limbs is—”
There’s a brief silence.
“Yeah.”
There’s a doctor. Medicine seems to be pretty advanced compared to what this world looks like. There are antibiotics and vaccines. Painkillers, too, but I don’t get a lot of those. They also have some kind of body scanners.
“They’re gone. Too old.”
Steve’s not strong enough to sustain that gaze, so he looks away, around himself.
… right. It almost feels like mockery.
“You mean—”
(Again?)
Tony’s touch is extremely delicate, and almost apologetic in how careful it is. He unwraps the wire from around Steve’s penis, slow when he pulls each barb from the skin. He produces a Swiss Army knife from somewhere and cuts the twine, then pulls the foreskin to the hilt and back over the shaft once or twice. He waits for blood to return to Steve’s penis, then he disinfects it and bandages it, taking particular care of the area where the knot usually grows. Finally, with some difficulty, Tony pulls the sweatpants up to Steve’s waist.
“Yeah, but I mean, if you want to have breakf—”
But Steve wouldn’t compromise, Steve refused to trust Tony’s advice and judgement, and it only led to that look, that look of unconditional and infinite betrayal, hurt, disgust, rage all mixed together on Tony’s face, all distilled into the vicious force of Tony’s first blow to Steve’s cheek.
He closes his eyes and tilts his head backward, mouth open around a shout that could be Steve’s name. He comes in thick spurts of white that hit Steve’s chest and slowly roll down to his stomach.
“Well, no.”
She takes his hand in hers and squeezes it. Tony watches them look at each other for a moment without speaking, while something is obviously being shared across their bond.
Each time they get more vicious, because they know I’ll heal.
Tony starts moving, fucking himself so deliciously on Steve’s cock, with little teasing thrusts that drive Steve out of his mind. Steve’s balls draw in; his thighs shake.
“Don’t give me that. What’s been going on with all this sex-twice-a-day business and the prostate massages and—”
“Hell, no,” Bucky says, but he looks concerned. He exchanges a worried look with Natasha.
“You were worried?” he asks, voice low and scratchy.
They look at each other. A beat, two. Steve’s eyes are so sharp in the darkness of the room.
“Steve—” he murmurs, struggling to open his eyes.
The first thing Steve does after closing the door behind himself is take an impossibly long breath and keep it his in lungs for a while, eyes closed.
Still. No one asks, no one comments, no one hints, except for Stephen one night saying, hesitantly, “Would you like me to…” to which Tony replies with a calm, “No,” and that’s the end of it. But everyone knows.
He washes his face with warm water, then wets the brush and rubs it on the soap, lathering it up properly. He covers his beard with it.
Steve isn’t sure they’re still talking about the church, or
. He pushes himself up, stumbles into the bathroom and turns on the unforgiving light over the sink. He drinks some water from the tap, washes his face.
, and he fucks into Tony again, desperate and unable to really control his movements or his strength, until he can’t hold himself up anymore. He crushes Tony to the floor, a hand splayed out over Tony’s shoulder blades, and Tony distantly registers that now he really can’t breathe—he’s pinned in place, mouth full of Steve’s fingers.
“I’m sorry I wouldn’t hug you today.”
Pain keeps his mind alert.
“Mmh. Hello.”
He crawls into bed, under the blanket. He hopes it will keep him warm, as much as possible.
Tony feels his heart in his throat and the tears just won’t stop and there’s a pounding in his head and every sound is so far away and so close all at once and the world is spinning under his feet and his knees tremble and—
He remembers wishing he had the courage to tell Tony
He seems taller, like this. He seems immense.
“You’ve got to be kidding me,” Tony says as soon as he sees him. His face must be
It’s home. His mate. Family. Safe. The sky, the stars.
“It’s a really cool place.”
This is his guilty pleasure, his greatest shame, Steve doesn’t know how to define it. It’s where he draws Tony. Everything about Tony: his clever hands, his bright eyes, his nose, his hair, his face, his muscled shoulders, the arc reactor in his chest, the curve of his back, his wiry thighs, his lean legs, his bony feet. Tony hunched down at a table in his workshop with three thick books and four screens in front of him, Tony with his tongue poking out from his lips while he’s concentrating unscrewing something deep in the Iron Man armor, Tony covered in grease, Tony in the gym, Tony aiming repulsors at the Sinister Six, Tony in a designer suit at an Avengers press conference, Tony naked in the shower, Tony jerking off, Tony smiling, Tony crying, Tony with his head in his hands.
I wanted to go back to Peggy. But I wasn't thinking of Peggy, and the stone knew, and it led me here.
“Alright, for future reference: you tell me this kind of shit.”
They visit Piazza della Signoria and Palazzo Vecchio, and... Oh, everything is breathtaking.
“Alright. Okay. Hey—”
It could be the dream that morning, or what happened after he woke up, or Tony’s hand in his during breakfast, or the way Tony’s tongue and lips curled around the softness of the sounds when he was talking to the vendors—how smooth and seamless the words felt to Steve, who didn’t really understand them. It could be how serene Tony looks right now, eating this theoretically disgusting but actually awesome panino in big bites that make his cheeks bulge, as if being a bit gross is the only way to enjoy this kind of food; it could be any number of things, but Steve feels something heavy settle behind his navel and something warm tugging at the skin between his legs, and—
I’m still tall and I still have muscles. I train, so I haven’t lost them, and they feed us enough because people want a spectacle to watch, but I don’t have any of my superhuman abilities anymore. No super strength, no enhanced senses, no super speed. No special reflexes, no incredible stamina or durability or agility. No super healing. I’m just a man. Nothing special about me.
“So, what do you wanna do now? We go back home?”
“Hello.”
It suddenly feels stupid, this thing in his hand. This little heap of perfectly arranged bits of metal and plastic, this silly tiny object that is the only thing that separates him from Tony. It’s also the only thing that would allow him to reach Tony, and the sick irony of the situation isn’t lost on him.
Tony, he… he doesn’t really masturbate. He doesn’t feel the need, especially since his heats are gone. Just sometimes, every few months, he wakes up hard and he takes care of it quickly, in the bathroom. Sometimes he doesn’t even need to do anything at all, his erection flagging before he can even free it from his underwear. But he never feels wet, he never feels open.
Steve makes Tony sit on the bed. He slips Tony’s socks on his feet, then ties up his shoes. When he’s done, while he’s still kneeling on the ground, he rests a hand on Tony’s knee and smiles. He kisses it, where it becomes Tony’s thigh. Tony feels it through his pants.
Steve lifts his knees behind Tony, so he can lean back against his thighs. A warm ache settles into Steve’s bones, and his knot trembles as he releases another load of come inside Tony. Steve presses up into him, pushes him down so the knot is sheathed a bit deeper in his body, and the skin of Tony’s hole closes up around the very base of Steve’s cock, under the knot. Tony shakes and hisses and says, “Goddammit,” under his breath.
“I wasn’t sure about telling you. Didn’t know if I should, what’d be the right time… I didn’t want you to think I was making it up so I’d look less awful. I still did it, Tony. There may be some redeeming factors, but what I did was wrong and I wanted you to make your decision without me trying to, you know… I sort of wished I could tell you after, one way or another… I don’t know.”
“Just as much as she missed you, I guess.”
Tony puts on his shoes in a hurry. Then, he stops in his tracks and looks at Steve.
After about twenty minutes, they finally get their cones, and Steve thought Tony was exaggerating but… nope. This is the best—
He imagines Tony’s serious face listening to his words. He imagines him nodding, brushing a hand over his mouth, immersed deep in thought. He imagines his resolute gaze at the end of Steve’s perfect little declaration of intent. He’d say, “Welcome home, Cap,” and maybe he would even hug him. Friendly, warm. Nice, like Tony is with so many people.
“Tony, it’s not—”
He watches the screen, and even if distorted by the angle, he already knows who’s there.
“See, I don’t think that’s completely true.”
She smells good. And now Sarah does too, and there’s no trace, anywhere, that she ever didn’t. Not even in her eyes.
“You’re not.”
“I didn’t know—”
“Yeah.”
It keeps happening. Not often, just once or twice a month, but it keeps happening. Always in the same way: it’s unplanned, sudden, unexpected, Steve is surprised and eager, his dick goes from zero to one hundred in two seconds, Tony’s touch is electric, everything he does drives Steve crazy, but he never lets Steve kiss him, he very rarely looks Steve in the eye, he never talks, never makes a sound when he comes, never mentions it later.
“I thought… I had this thought, that I was in this place that was so old, that had been there for centuries, you know? And it made me feel... I don’t know how to explain it with words, but it made me feel like maybe I wasn’t lost, or drifting away. I belonged here, now. I could find a home, and it wouldn’t be ripped away from me again. I felt like… like there was something in my life that wouldn’t change again all of a sudden, and leave me behind.”
“Well, we weren’t exactly on speaking terms, were we?”
He doesn’t want to sleep, but he must pass out at some point into the night, because he dreams.
“Wait—” Steve starts, but Nat interrupts him.
Steve takes the base of his dick, pulls out of Tony’s mouth, teases him, caresses his lips with the head. It’s fun looking at Tony trying to catch it, but having a very small range of movements, he grows impatient. And he’s dizzy, so he just lets his mouth go slack and hopes Steve will be benevolent and fill it up again. And Steve is.
Downstairs, he finds Stella in the kitchen, making coffee. She kisses his cheek.
“Come on,” he says, “let’s get out of here.”
“What was he like? I mean, what’d your mom tell you?”
Steve’s tongue licking his, their slightly different body temperatures.
Tony lifts his arm, brushes his fingers, playful, over Steve’s face, makes him close his eyes for a second. “Wasn’t your fault.”
Steve reaches a blank page and starts drawing some lines, with not much thought behind them. Someone knocks softly at his door. He closes the sketchbook and puts it under a pillow, goes to see who it is.
“That was amazing, Tony! You’re so good!”
“Florence tomorrow sounds great,” Steve says, still smiling.
He takes his other hand away from Steve’s thigh and he shoves more fingers into himself, and—
“Everything alright with… You-Know-Who?”
Tony turns and sees him sitting up on the bed, squinting in the darkness, the blanket bunching up in his lap. His mouth is slightly open, and his breath gets caught in his chest with a horrible sound.
The only bits of hope come from Tony’s presence in his mind. It isn’t constant; it comes and goes, but it’s soothing when it’s there. At least he’s not completely alone. At least Tony is willing to help him in one way, if not the other. The rejection isn’t so total.
“No, no, no, oh god, no,” he hears Tony whisper.
“Feeling better?” he asks, and Tony laughs again, but he doesn’t reply, and Steve lets it go for now.
, but he can’t. It’s too big of a lie. Even for him.
“Telling you my exact volume before and after would be pointless I suppose, but I lost three inches in height and the rest of my body adjusted consequently.”
“I’m no expert,” Steve says, his voice low and scratchy, “but that really was beautiful.” He looks directly into Tony’s eyes now, intense, hard as only Steve can be. Tony is ashamed that he can’t hold the power of that gaze. Not right now, not like this. He looks at the carpet.
“Reading, yeah, a bit. Writing, uh... not very well.”
Steve doesn’t stop fucking Tony with his fingers, keeps sucking him off until Tony whimpers, his balls drawn tightly in. When Steve feels Tony’s cock pulse for the first time he takes it at the base, careful not to block Tony’s orgasm, and holds it in place, parting his lips. Tony’s come is hot and thick on Steve’s face and tongue, he tries to lick it up from his chin, tries to catch what’s dripping from his cheek. He wipes some of it with his thumb, then swallows that down, too. The fingers of his other hand are still buried inside Tony.
“She’s brave,” Steve says when Tony tells him. “Like her dad.”
“You see that castle there? With the four towers?”
The effect it has on Steve is unbearable.
The corner of Steve’s mouth lifts up in a shy smile.
“I haven’t changed my mind.”
But it’s fine. The secret is to move slowly, work around the shape of the shirt, crawl inside it, take advantage of how stretchy the fabric is. In no time, Steve is pulling it down over Tony’s hips.
“It’s not Italian.”
So Tony gets his own shit together. For her.
“Wait, Tony—” Steve says, grabbing his hand.
The pictures have been taken pretty much everywhere around the world. There’s them doing silly touristy things, taking selfies before the word existed in front of this or that monument, wearing NASA t-shirts outside the Kennedy Space Center. There are pictures of them at home; sometimes just one of them, but most of the times they’re together or with someone else, relatives or friends.
“Okay, okay. I admit it. I like it,” he says, shrugging, “so what?”
But it’s fine. If this is what Steve likes, then fine. Tony isn’t about to protest or ask for something different: if he does, the spell might break, Steve might come back to his senses and ask himself what the fuck is he doing with someone like Tony—an old and used Omega, notoriously damaged goods.
“He’s not morally against it. Sex work, I mean. He’s not against it.”
Tony turns his head towards him, and it’s more a press of lips against Steve’s hair than an actual kiss, but he breathes Steve’s scent in, and almost wishes, uselessly, that it didn’t feel like home and peace this much.
“I know what you want, Steve.”
He feels sick, gags on it, holds himself up with a hand against a tree, but nothing comes out. He coughs and coughs and coughs until his chest burns with it, his throat hurts.
“Had a glass when I woke up.”
He sits up and shivers. He doesn’t look at Steve’s shield on the floor.
It’s a time of realizations, apparently. Of bad realizations. Very bad ones.
Tony is so stunned he can’t even find a way to get mad at him, not when Steve shifts Tony’s body so he can part his cheek to look at his ass, to caress it with the flat of his hand and play with the coarse hair there. There’s an obscene sound when Steve spits on Tony’s hole, when he nudges at it with his fingers, pushing his saliva in and mixing it with Tony’s slick.
Tony shifts on the bed, closer to Steve; he twists around so he’s stomach down on the mattress and pushes himself up on his hands, near Steve’s shoulder. He stares down at Steve, who seems to have his head glued to the pillow. Steve stares back, eyes wide. He parts his lips.
Just this once.
He feels like
And yet.
“Fas—” Steve tries to say, but talking seems out of the question at the moment. Tony must get what he means anyway though, because he speeds up and—
His belly grows, and he can’t mask it anymore. He avoids being seen in public, only releases a couple of carefully filmed statements from behind his desk, and no one suspects a thing. No one is surprised if he looks tired.
Steve starts gathering his clothes with a sigh and wipes Tony’s tears from his neck with the palm of his hand.
“I’m trying to understand. Why you didn’t say anything about my parents. It makes me…
Tony lowers his gaze to Steve’s chest.
Tony doesn’t look at himself in the mirror. He takes a quick shower, dresses, hops in his car and drives to a secret lab where he reboots his whole biology, effectively erasing every physical sign of what the man did to him.
“I’m tired, Steve. I’m—”
“You can’t talk about it right now. I know.”
He sounds like he’s about to join Tony, if Tony doesn’t stop.
he can’t get it up all the way.
. If it was kissing that Steve wanted, they could’ve had it.
“It’s very high-tech.”
“I need to tell you something,” she says, and her hard gaze meets Steve’s and locks him there. He’s never seen her like this, on the verge of trembling with how nervous she is. “You’re going to hate me,” she adds, voice cracking at the edges.
You, you who are different, at least you in the universe / You are a point that never revolves around me / A sun that shines only for me / Like a diamond in the middle of the heart.
“Maybe,” Tony whispers.
“I want to throw myself off a building every time I think about that day,” Steve says, quietly, and maybe he meant to say it but not necessarily to be heard. “But I’d probably survive.”
Tony sits up too, rests his elbows on his knees. He picks out a bit of brome grass from his pants.
He falls asleep. He’s thankful for how exhausted he is, for every minute of unconsciousness.
Maria doesn’t cry.
Life in the prison camp is… It’s life in a prison camp.
“Yeah.”
“I’m not gonna regret saving his life, Nat.”
But sometimes Tony thinks that maybe the man…
“Tony, you… you don’t get it. It was horrific. We had to restrain him in Wakanda, he was—”
“Maybe, but I’m
Tony turns, shifts closer to his bedside table to put the sketch in the drawer with the others, but Steve touches his elbow and says, “Wait.” He takes a marker and scribbles something at the bottom of the drawing. “There,” he says, “now it’s perfect.”
Tony doesn’t reply, but Steve feels him in his head just a moment later, reaching out, still cautious but sweet, affectionate.
“A bit, baby. A tiny bit.”
Tony sits down on the mattress and lowers himself to place a kiss on his daughter’s chubby knee.
“What I’m trying to say is that maybe in his heart Tony has already forgiven you. But he doesn’t want it to be something that just happens to him. He wants to choose it. Maybe he’s just waiting to see if his brain can catch up or not. If he can look at you again without thinking about the betrayal first.”
“I don’t give a shit about my memory of him. I care about you. Tony. You don’t need to be as strong and brave as Captain America. Most of the time, not even Captain America is as strong and brave as Captain America, believe me... I know the armor is a metaphor for you in many ways. But that’s yours, and yours alone. Iron Man is yours. It’s you. You don’t have to prove anything. Not to me. I know who you are.”
Tony sighs, and thinks of something to say in response, but the seconds stretch between them until the silence becomes too long. “Let’s go clean up,” he says instead.
“Will do.”
It was a brief truce, brought on by Tony’s distress, but now the rut is back to full force.
“Oh, Steve…”
shield—just a few feet away from him, and there are so many things he wishes he could do and feel and say before everything stops, but he can’t and he knows he can’t and he wishes he could just... that he could just feel warm for one last time, that he could feel... that he could look into Steve’s eyes one last time and have the chance to tell him, to say it to him, to say—
“I’ll take it.”
“Would you stop worrying,” Tony slurs, still half asleep. “And just fuck me.”
Stella looks at him, eyes bright. “Is it really, though?”
Steve forces himself to think about something else, because a cold shower doesn’t seem particularly appealing right now, and because he’s not sure he has the strength to bear the guilt of doing this again, of using images of Tony for his own pleasure without Tony’s consent or knowledge, because Tony is still angry with him and Steve feels sick at the thought of taking certain liberties. He probably wouldn’t, if their circumstances were different. But that doesn’t matter.
It gets better, which prompts Tony to move his thumb, slowly, in and out of Steve. He tries switching his thumb with his forefinger, which isn’t as thick, and Steve muscles close around it like a vise.
Steve brushes a hand up Tony’s thigh, tangles his fingers with the silk. Tony presses his ass down over Steve’s dick, and Steve feels that he’s wet. He knows Tony’s ready to take him, even though he doesn’t remember opening him up.
“Finish your visit. I need a moment alone,” he says, but the look on Steve’s face tells him he’s not going to give up so easily. “Please, Steve,” he tries, and Steve relaxes his shoulders and lets his hand go. Reluctantly, but he does it.
“Um. Sorry. I’ll… I’ll go wash up.”
“Shh,” Steve whispers, close to him but without touching him, “It’s alright, Tony. Sweetheart, it’s alright.”
“Yeah.”
Rhodey blinks. “A tie.”
, and he said,
They wait it out, cuddled up on the couch, breathing each other in, discovering that something is shifting in their biology. The bond, freshly repaired, produces new hormones, and new hormones mean a new underlying scent that’s not Steve
. There’s too much space between the L and the rest of the word
“Sir, Miss Maria woke up about ten minutes ago. She didn’t seem to have any need for your presence, so I thought it best not to disturb you and Captain Rogers.”
When he hit Tony with the shield, it must’ve bent the suit out of shape, it—the suit, the shield, both—must’ve cut into Tony’s skin, doing enough damage that he needs the reactor again for his heart to beat right.
Steve is still kneeling on the ground, he’s confused, trying to buy some time but… it’s done. It’s over.
“I shouldn’t have... I keep fuckin’ this up, goddammit,” Steve says, and he hits himself in the head with his fist. Once, then twice. And again, until it hurts.
“Shut the fuck up, Tony,” Steve says, soft and quiet so it’s not an order, just a reference to Tony’s words from yesterday. “Thank you for staying. I’m glad you did. I’d be very happy if you stayed tonight as well.” He doesn’t have the courage to ask him to stay until he’s healed.
He sits back at his desk and Steve follows him, leaning back against the table.
“Yeah.”
Tony looks at Steve’s face, twisted in desperation, he looks lost and dangerous, devastated, distraught. He looks young. He’s been crying, he’s sobbing now.
“No, I want to go. Let’s go.”
She also eats a lot, though. Well, drinks. Formula.
“So, you were saying? About the ties?”
“So I could—hypothetically—forgive you and decide to stay friends? You’d be okay with that?”
the things he’s doing are just. Just.
“Okay.”
Steve gets up so fast that he kicks his chair to the floor. He takes Tony in.
“You can’t sleep either?” Steve asks, and that’s when his stomach grumbles again. Tony looks at it. Steve looks down at it, betrayed.
He knocks on Steve’s door in the middle of the night. Steve wakes up, and Tony stands there, on the threshold, his body slicing the light coming from the hallway.
So he doesn’t.
Her sense of responsibility, her ambition, her stubbornness, her eccentricism. Her love for food and music, for science, for the future that she could see just around the corner. Her pragmatism, her love, her need to always strive to do better and be better, because the world deserved to see the best version of Maria Stark, because she deserved to be the best version of herself, and all that unhappiness couldn’t swallow her whole, even though it tried.
“Alright. Alright,” Steve says, and rests his forehead against Tony’s chest. The light pressure on the reactor feels good, even through two layers of clothing. Tony brushes his lips to Steve’s hair.
“But why can’t you just leave it alone?”
Tony doesn’t know what this feels like for Sarah. Did she feel them, Steve and Tony? In her head? Is it more physical for her, more a thing of scents and protective touches than feelings? He doesn’t know.
But the comparison is merciless.
Talk to me about love Mariù
Not his father’s, no. He is his mother’s.
, Steve thinks. Because Steve doesn’t need to fall in love. He’s already fallen.
What if—
It’s not exactly pleasurable to him, not in the way it is for Steve. It’s not like being fucked, but there’s an aspect to it—the intimacy, the trust, the conviction it takes to be willing to do something so tiring and risky and potentially painful—that makes it seem as though it’s more than what it is.
He sucks in a breath, startled by Tony’s voice. Guilt seeps into him, insidious and virulent as an illness. His heart thunders in his chest. He tries to look at Tony’s face, but it’s even worse than looking at his hip.
“We, uh. Guess we are.”
The sensation is—
“Why can’t you explain this?”
He wants to be with Tony, to feel his love in his mind. He wants Tony’s hands on his skin. He wants to be a father again. And again and again and again and again. He wants to be okay, but he can only hope to retain enough presence of mind to be able to say goodbye to Tony and Sarah, before wasting away in this room.
“We weren’t. We weren’t really fine, but I guess it helped, yeah.”
This was bad. This was so bad.
“I’m not the leader of anything.”
, Tony thinks again, and just like that he knows what he has to do.
He doesn’t send anything back, but that’s what makes him decide that he has to keep it together, no matter how he feels about Steve, no matter the state of their bond.
“I didn’t mean to shock you, Tony, I’m sorry.”
Tony seizes every occasion to tease him with his jokes, with his feigned carelessness, with the obvious proof of his superior intellect. He pretends to be the more reckless, irreverent, irresponsible version of Howard, but he never pretends to be less intelligent. Tony wears many masks, but never the one of the stupid.
That’s strange. Steve used to draw all the time, before.
Around midnight, Tony would yawn, and Steve would take it as the sign that it is. They discard tablets and reading glasses and books and pencils and start kissing. Slowly at first, tentatively, because this is still new in some ways. They take off their clothes, though sometimes only what’s necessary to get things done because Tony gets chilly and wants to keep his sweater on.
Steve carefully lays him back down onto the ground. He wishes he had something to put under his head. He doesn’t want him to be uncomfortable.
And Steve… where’s Steve?
“So, what did you guys decide in the end? You said it didn’t go that bad.”
“Remember that time during the Halloween party a couple of years ago, I picked up a confetti from your hair and combed it back with my fingers?”
The place hasn’t changed much since the last time Tony was here. It was… thirteen years ago, yes. Before Iron Man, before everything. He came for the thermal baths. Pepper said he needed to relax. By the second day, he thought he’d die out of sheer boredom, but he had to admit that the town was nice.
“Yeah. You’re right. It’s a dumb idea. Sorry.”
Steve groans, low, “Tony,” and fucks deep inside him and stops there, coming and shuddering violently over him. They’re locked together. He pushes Tony’s head to the side, and—
“Come to bed, Tony,” Steve tries, “please.” And it makes Tony laugh even harder, because to him the mere idea is so absurd that it doesn’t even deserve to be considered at all.
“Were you spying on us? Grandmas really don’t know how to pass the time,” Tony replies without missing a beat, rolling his eyes for the sake of the game.
Steve is shivering, badly, and it’s not just the cold in his heart. He remembers his promise, and he can’t fail Tony now. He can’t fail Tony again.
) time together and they’ve just finished a sparring session that didn’t end with them covered in each other’s come, if only because Matt and Jess were also there as far as Steve is concerned. After everyone leaves, Steve goes to take a quick shower, but he lingers under the hot spray of the water, lets his muscles relax, and it still feels impossible that he
“Do what?”
“It is, but... I’m scared, Steve. I just feel... the guilt, it’s too much. And I don’t know how I can make it up to him. Like, how can I even begin—”
“I should’ve talked to you about it. What I saw. It’s all my fault.”
“Nowhere. I don’t know,” Steve says. “It was—”
“Where did you go?” he asks, and he tries so hard to keep his voice even, but he can’t quite pull it off.
“I want you to know,” Steve starts again, “That despite my actions, I’ve loved you more than anything else in this life, and that I love you now, and that I always will.”
“No. Yeah. I know.”
Tony bends down to brush his lips against Steve’s, and in a moment of clarity Steve thinks that even if this doesn’t work, even if the rut ends up killing him anyway, it doesn’t matter. If Tony is with him until the end, then Steve is gonna be okay. He just wants Tony close.
A boy comes in to clean me. He’s a servant.
He bends down to look closer at her for a minute, then locks his gaze with Tony’s without saying anything for a while.
What the hell.
When Steve is ready—or as ready as he can stand to be—he guides Tony up on his feet and forces him to open his eyes with a hand on his face.
In this world, in this year, Steve
It’s sugar, Tony’s voice. A caress, a dream. A night, months ago, except back then Tony never called Steve by his name.
There it is again. The mother-henning. Annoying.
Next, there are spices and herbs. Tony takes them from the vases on the porch, rinses them in the sink, chops them up on a wooden cutting board.
It’s an indestructible moral imperative. It’s an unwavering devotion to a precise code of honor.
Sand, infection. Sweat, burned skin. Rhodey.
Steve’s voice sounds terrified.
Tony is feeding Sarah while he says, “Come in.”
Tony focuses on the point where Steve’s body meets his, and doesn’t feel like it’s hurting at all. He feels completely open, a bit sore, maybe, but there’s no unpleasant friction. Steve must have added lots of lube while Tony was sleeping, and with all that come inside him, Tony feels wet, slick, loose.
Tony nods, and presses a hand over his heart.
“Yeah, I think so. Speaking of, I’d better get started on lunch.”
Tony can’t process or rationalize this at the moment, but Steve can’t mean what he seems to be meaning, not really, but it’s fine, who cares, whatever floats his boat. He’s an old-fashioned guy, maybe he likes this type of talk in bed. Tony can just roll with it.
“Okay, shoot.”
He remembers not eating. For days. Not sleeping. Not shaving. Not being able to do anything at all except sit on his armchair in front of the window and stare outside, seeing nothing, while pain kept exploding in the middle of his chest because his heart felt like it was being constantly torn into pieces for the sick amusement of some superior entity that fed on his agony.
“We could lose everything we’ve built, Steve. For this. I don’t know if it’s worth it.”
But the only thing Steve can really think is:
But also: Tony isn’t feeling any worse, really. Actually, he feels pretty good. His orgasms are good. His erections are okay-ish. Sure, they often sag, but Steve is very patient and waits for him, smiles, touches him in the least condescending way, gives him all the time he needs, helps him until he comes. He felt a bit embarrassed at first, looking at his soft cock slide between Steve’s lips, but he’s used to it now, and it feels strangely intimate. And in general he maybe feels a bit weak in the legs when he walks to the bathroom in the morning, but for the rest, he’s fine.
Tony takes the blue blanket from the back of the couch and goes outside, walks around the building to the oak tree on the back. He spreads the blanket on the grass, sits down on it.
Bucky turns to look at the floor, only mildly interested. “She’s in the shower,” he says, shrugging.
“I can go,” Steve mouths at him after adjusting Maria in her cradle while Tony pretends to listen to the phone.
. What right do I have not to hurt just the same?”
Well, that has to change, and soon.
“Wait!” Tony says, too loud, and takes Steve’s wrist in his hand before he can run away like the last time.
Their eyes meet for a moment. Steve looks so all-encompassingly sad, it’s in his bones and coming out from every pore of his skin. He finishes dressing quickly, shivers while putting on a sweater.
Steve establishes a fast rhythm with his head, just the way he knows Tony likes it, hollows his cheeks and sucks hard, keeps his teeth covered with his lips, uses every trick he knows, everything he has picked up from Tony or looked up on the internet; he doesn’t stop fucking Tony with his fingers, and after a while Tony lets out a long, guttural groan, ripped off from deep in his chest, and comes down Steve’s throat, while Steve has to keep Tony’s legs still, so he doesn’t kick Steve or hurts himself while he shakes, violently, tears streaming down his face. Mindless of Tony’s come dripping down his chin, Steve crawls up on top of Tony, careful not to crush him with his weight but still determined to hold him through the aftershock of his orgasm. It takes minutes before Tony comes down from the rush, and he’s still oversensitive when Steve tries to stroke his arm, but he smiles sweetly at Steve, one eye open and the other closed, and curls up with his head under Steve’s armpit, happy, sated, blissed-out.
They lie there for a while, sharing more kisses with their mouths and their minds, trading love across the bond.
Tony puts his hands on the steering wheel. A normal people car. More or less. Not what he’s used to, anyway. But it’s okay; he doesn’t need fancy right now. The X1 is more than adequate. It’s anonymous and normal and tons of people have it, so he doesn’t stand out.
“Yes. I have. I’ll tell you tomorrow.”
“Oh. That’s, that’s great, Tony.”
“Stay away! Stay away from me!”
Tony replies with a smiling emoji, and he imagines Pepper shaking her head, fond, her beautiful hair falling over her cheek.
His teammates look at him with no pity, but only deep understanding and affection. He’s not the only one with something like this in his past. He wouldn't be even by raw statistics.
It’s that last detail that really sends Steve into overdrive now. He was just talking the other day (yesterday? The day before? He has no idea) but now the idea of Tony being pregnant again, of having another kid makes his head spin with how much he wants it.
Tony shakes his head again. “I’m not sure,” he says.
“Alright. I just want—”
“Just surprised,” Steve repeats, slowly, as if he needs to do that to really understand what Tony means.
Tony nods. He doesn’t want to nod, but he nods.
“Hey, you’re awake. I stole pastries from the kitchen.”
“Uh…” Steve says, and looks at himself. He touches the cardigan. “Yeah?”
, Tony, you make me better.”
He takes off his mask.
Steve pushes the blanket away, walks the distance that separates him from Tony and crouches down next to him.
He hopes Bruce can reach Steve, somehow. He hopes Pepper is okay, while she pretends to be planning their non-existent wedding, that started as a way to mislead the press about Spider-Man joining the Avengers and then got out of their hands when the stock market gained 8 points in one day. The things you do for your company.
Tony lowers his head to Steve’s chest.
He wants to answer. Wants to ask,
“Fuck, Steve—”
“I didn’t listen either—”
There was a necessity that made lying to Steve about this acceptable in Tony’s mind.
Steve doesn’t seem fazed by this, keeps stroking him slowly and kissing him in that sweet way of his and after a while, finally,
“Alright,” Steve says, after thinking about it for a little while. “If you’re sure… alright.”
“‘Course I was. I was terrified.”
“Fuck,” he says, because there’s absolutely nothing else he can say, nothing that makes as much sense.
“That’s a terrible joke.”
It tastes
Tony nods, but he doesn’t know if it’s because he believes what Stella said, or because the rocking motion is the only small comfort he can find in this moment.
“I got an idea,” he says. “Maybe it won’t make you sleep, but you’ll relax. Better than nothing, right?”
. Tony moves his head, opens his mouth, and swallows Steve’s fingers, tasting himself on them and Steve underneath it all and he wonders how has he lived without this for ten years?
Steve takes Tony by the arms and pushes him away delicately. The loss of Tony’s mouth on his makes him regret this immediately, but he needs to look Tony in the eye and understand what’s happening.
But he seems really happy, so Tony is… well. It’s good. It’s good to see Steve having a good time. It’s good to watch him be excited about things. Be himself.
Wake up, Tony,
(See the end of the chapter for
“And you? Do you know me?”
for a rut. It can get bad, and sure Steve is somewhat special but… dying?
Steve bites into Tony’s lip and makes him yelp and groan. He must break the skin because he tastes blood for a moment. He licks a long strip along Tony’s neck, finishing just behind his ear, biting hard into the lobe just as he feels Tony’s nails digging in the soft skin at the base of Steve’s neck.
“Tony,” Bucky says, his eyes going a little wide in surprise, “you know Steve loves you, right?”
It startles a gasp out of Steve, Tony’s touch, his callused hand on Steve’s neck, the way his thumb strokes Steve’s jaw, over his beard.
“It was the only other time we saw each other. I was in New York for work. For a couple of years, Maria had started to write in her letters that having you had made her look back at her life, her decisions… she said she had regrets.”
If he could get out of here, maybe he could do it right. But then Tony would be alone in their grave, and that feels wrong too.
Tony runs away from him, runs down the corridors of Stark Mansion and breathes, and cries and breathes.
He practically runs into the bathroom, shutting the door with too much force, discouraging Steve from any kind of reply.
“She agreed to let us stay at her house for a couple of days, to tell me about my mom.”
it got ruined. It’s a reminder of what could’ve been lost forever.”
“I sent all I could, but the bond didn’t respond like normal and—”
Tony opens the bedroom door carefully, steps inside before Steve. He sits on the bed, in front of the holographic screen. He gestures for Steve to come in as well, sit beside him, but Steve legs refuse to move.
Steve resumes pushing into him with the same initial rhythm, pretending he’s starting just now from the beginning, as if he’s scared that if he goes too fast Tony might evaporate. It keeps going on like that for a while, Steve never picking up the pace, pure sweetness coming off of him in waves—it’s like being fucked by cotton candy, and Tony isn’t sure why he even expected anything else. Many clues point to Steve being a vanilla kind of Alpha, now that Tony thinks about it.
“Fuck—”
“Are you sure this is enough?” Tony asks after throwing away the third egg shell.
“You sure?”
“I’m sorry, I know it’s... I was just thinking about you and all the things you do for everyone, and... now that I know what you did for Bucky, it’s even more... I just—”
“I have a daughter. And you didn’t tell me.”
“I’m sorry if this has shaken you up. But it wouldn’t have been right not to give it to you.”
Steve’s weight on him.
“Months ago, after I bought you art supplies. You gave me a yellow rose. For friendship.”
He almost says,
Steve shakes his head. “Need to shower.”
“How’s the shoulder?”
. Probably the boy that was in Germany with him.
“Something wrong?” he asks, voice small.
“You remember the shape of my—”
He flies into the storm.
“Thank you, JARVIS.”
“Yeah, I mean, when you see all those people, so young, bright, full of potential, you wish you could give them the world, you know? But all these idiotic politics keeps them limited… it’s sad, really—”
“Right.”
“Steve, are you— hey, hey. Are you okay?”
“Shit.”
“Mom and I... we… Can I...” Tony gestures towards the living room.
“Nothing,” Tony says, but it makes him feel ridiculous, lying to Steve’s face like this, so obviously. “Everything,” he tries, and it seems unnecessarily, overly dramatic, even for him. He settles for, “I don’t know.”
In the exact moment Steve opens his eyes and looks at Tony, he knows he will murder every single person that’s responsible for this.
Tony’s tongue caressing Steve’s, his teeth sinking just enough into Steve’s skin, the callused pads of his fingers rubbing against Steve’s nipple until it hurt.
They head back into the bedroom. There’s not much light in the room; Steve closed the shutters to keep out the mugginess of the day, but it’s enough for what they have to do.
“Tony, isn’t that—” Steve starts, but Tony looks at him with an expression that doesn’t admit any kind of protest, and Steve decides that he’s gonna trust Tony’s judgement.
He has no idea about the state of his erections because he can’t get hard. Not here, not like this. Not with him.
“Thirty minutes, sir.”
“I’m sorry. I’m sure he was different when you knew him. At six, I was a better engineer than he ever was. Better at coding, too. It made him bitter. He grew frustrated over the years, he drank a lot. And the more he drank the more his ideas suffered, and... I don’t want to tarnish your memory of him, Steve, I just need—”
“FRIDAY, unlock 42:C. And I’m gonna need transport from the satellite in a minute.”
) but it doesn’t happen this time. Instead, he thinks about his dream. The cave, the need to find Steve. The fact that he kept on looking, no matter how hopeless the task.
He hasn’t said a single word this whole time.
Almost.
“Did you make this for me or for her?” Tony asks, but his tone isn’t at all confrontational. He doesn’t notice that it might be until after the words have left his mouth.
He wasn’t ready. Tony’s body wasn’t ready to be brought back to consciousness, and his body wasn’t ready for
Steve sees Tony fly past him out of the corner of his eye.
And then at some point, Steve started drawing himself. Just parts of his body at first, Tony’s lips around his dick, Tony stroking them both together, the drawing cutting at Steve’s chest. Then Steve started sketching his own face, with more and more details as the weeks went by and this sketchbook became more wish fulfillment than fixing memories to a page.
“The way you play it… it’s beautiful,” he says.
“What?”
Angry, pissed off, bitter—sure.
Here, with Tony.
“Please, stop blaming yourself, please. I’m begging you.” Steve takes Tony’s shoulders between his hands—his huge, huge hands—and Tony feels his guilt crushing him, and it’s hard to breathe, and his eyes are burning and he doesn’t want to cry, he really doesn’t want to, he needs to get his shit together and
Tony doesn’t say it, but he might as well have, for the face Steve makes. He feels nausea rising to his throat.
“Steve, I’m serious,” he says, sitting up again.
“Not even then. I talked about this with a therapist in Wakanda and she said... Bucky’s my friend, we’ve been friends since we were seven. He’s the last thing I got left from my past, Tony. I couldn’t risk losing him too, on top of everything else.”
without meaning to, without even realizing he meant to speak the word before it was too late. His head a step behind his lips.
“You were made for me, Tony. And I was made for you. You, and only you. No one else. Since the moment I met you, I knew I was yours. Forever.”
“It’s my new armor. It’s see-through.”
Tony remembers the joke, how he mocked Steve about the fact that he looked up to talk to JARVIS, even if he didn’t need to. It had happened three or four times at least, when Steve was around. After everyone had told Tony that no, they weren’t going to move in the tower with him after all, but they’ll be there for Avengers business.
, and Tony’s vision goes blurry at the edges.
Step.
He just wants Steve to be okay. For Steve’s own sake, for Sarah’s. For himself.
Tony’s t-shirt is wet.
“Thirty-seven.”
“You got me a tie.”
“Of course I have. Last time, it was right after New York. Our last attempt at making it work. It didn’t work. As you know.”
“It’s fine. I want it. Believe me, I really do. I didn’t think you were gonna do it, though.”
Steve says it in a murmur, as if it’s something he shouldn’t say.
“What a waste.”
Steve reaches for his own neck. If his friends hadn’t bandaged his severed head to his body, maybe his healing factor couldn’t have brought Steve back.
“Would you kiss me?” he asks, because it’s the last chance he has. Steve’s expression falters a little, but he bends his head and kisses him slowly, stopping his thrusts to dedicate himself to it fully, with no other distractions. He lingers with his lips on Tony’s and resumes fucking into him at a languorous pace, hips rolling between Tony’s open thighs, stomach pressing down on Tony’s hard dick, now free through the tatters of his pants.
“Tony, don’t—”
“I thought I’d lose it. I’m almost fifty, Steve. I didn’t want to give you false hope. I know how much you wished… well…”
“I didn’t know you could cook.” Did Steve ever know anything about Tony?
Later, in their room, Tony becomes silent again, numb again, but the anger underneath the surface is worse than before—it’s a vengeful fury that makes his hands shake while he unbuttons his shirt.
“How’s Italy?”
Neither does Tony.
“Sounds healthy.”
It’s not a very Alpha thing to do, traditionally. It’s considered somewhat wrong. It’s supposed to be the other way around and
The silk feels so nice on Tony’s clean skin, cool and soft and soothing.
He doesn’t hurry up. He can’t risk hurting Tony, who is possibly not really thinking with his brain right now. But he doesn’t stop, either, and soon Tony is as open as he’s gonna get.
“Sometimes I…” Tony starts, wistful, interrupting himself immediately. “Nothing, nevermind,” he finishes, lowering his gaze to the ground and breathing through his open lips.
Steve opens his eyes, blinks a few times and tries to look at Tony. “What…” he starts, but he can’t finish.
“I love you,” Steve says, and kisses the spot between Tony’s shoulders. “I love you, I love you, I love you,” he chants against Tony’s neck, and removes his hand from Tony’s heart to place it on his throat, grip sure and tight.
Tony takes his shirt off. Steve barely has the time to realize that blood is trickling down his face and into his eyelashes from a cut on his forehead.
“You’ve said.”
I’m grateful for the nights when they leave me alone. I huddle up on my wicker mat and close my eyes, trying to shut everything else out. The squelching noises of fucking, the muffled cries for help, the desperate attempts at refusing, the well-placed punch to the gut, and then, occasionally, the dull gurgle of blood filling a mouth, the echo of a severed limb hitting the floor, the sharp intake of breath as a blade enters the lung. The screams. The chronic coughing of those pretending to sleep. It’s from the stone dust.
“Uh? Oh, hey. Yeah. I’m alright,” Tony says, startled at first, then lying.
In the end, Tony leaves Maria in the play cot in the living room. She is asleep, but if she wakes up he figures she can spend a few minutes by herself in a safe space.
It hurts. It hurts so much that I’m going crazy with it.
Steve, trying to say something but there must be mud in his brain right now. He fucks like there’s nothing else he cares about.
, he wants to say,
Steve realizes he’s staring at him from his chair, at Tony’s shoulders shifting under his t-shirt, at the veins in his arms. The small of his back. His bare feet.
“Steve.”
“You weren’t a big fan of truth when I told you you’re not an academic! Or when you—”
“Is it—”
Maybe Steve, too, has something he thinks about once a day, every day.
But the love, the love is different, and he understands it only now. Because his love for Peggy stays there, unchanged, unchangeable, a bullet that didn’t kill him but it’s lodged into his heart forever, a cut that has stopped bleeding at some point, and won’t bleed again. A perfect blossom that will never grow into anything else, that will never be touched, that will never wilt and die. Crystallized in time. Frozen.
“God, yes, please!” Steve begged.
Tony didn’t try to hide his tears.  He cradled Steve’s head against him, breathing hard and trying to keep it from turning into sobs.  “You won’t have to beg, sugar.  Someday – someday I’ll say yes, and shout it to the fucking rooftops.”
“Trust me, you keep your foot moving like that, and I’ll be wide awake.”  Tony rocked his hips very softly against Steve’s sock-clad foot.  “I didn’t know you were an exhibitionist.”
Tony’s eyes fluttered shut.  “Answer to that’s the same as the previous question, sugar… you.  Always you.”  He’d intended to make love to Steve – to trail hands and kisses over that beautiful body, to whisper praises – but the way Steve was touching him now, he kind of wanted to just relax into it and let Steve make the choices.
Tony snickered and kissed him.  “Thought you were trying to train me to be more prepared.”
Tony thrust back against him, his back arching against Steve's abs.  "Move, damn it."
“Oh, it is.”  Tony laughed low in his chest.  “You’re all mine, baby.  Every glorious inch.”
“Probably.”  Tony nibbled at Steve’s pulse points, down the length of his neck to his collarbone.  “Once you get up the balls to ask for what you want.”
Tony moved and Steve thought maybe he’d gotten through to him – but the movement proved to be Tony dropping to his knees and beginning to fumble with Steve’s pants.  “Just need – I promise it’ll be good, baby, I’ve just got to have you right now.”
“There you go, getting Brooklyn on me again.”  Tony shifted in his seat, but didn’t move away from Steve’s foot.
The screen flared to life, and the first thing they saw was themselves.  “Oh.”  Tony’s eyes went wide as he read the caption beneath the photo.  “Gay Avengers – A May-December Romance for Iron Man and Captain America.  Who do you suppose counts as older?  I’ve got more experience, but you’ve got a bigger candle count.”
Steve didn’t hesitate, and he didn’t dally.  He reached into Tony’s open pants, through the slit in his boxers, and drew out his already-leaking cock.  Steve lapped up the precome, kissed the flared tip, and swallowed Tony’s cock down.
“Rule three, doll,” Steve said, edging closer to him.  “This is team work, field work.  You didn’t hit your partner, you hit your captain.  Or your mouthy best friend who was definitely egging you on.  You’re not an abuser, sweetheart, I promise.”
Bruce slipped his glasses off and cleaned them on his shirt.  “So it was Steve… when?”
The damage to his suit wasn’t what was important, though.
Sensing all was not right, Tony cupped a hand around the back of Steve’s neck.  “It’s alright to not be okay, you know.”
“I suppose not.”  Steve tried to find the lightness for banter and failed.  Tried to find the place where he was okay with a quick roll in the hay and couldn’t find it either.
“You want everything,” Steve whispered, pressing into his lover.  He moved slowly, but didn’t stop until he was fully sheathed inside Tony.  “And I want to give it to you, my love – everything I have and everything I am.”  He caught Tony’s lips in a kiss, deep and panting and desperate.
It didn’t take long for him to find it.  Tony jolted when one long finger rubbed against his prostate, letting out a moan.  “Jesus, Steve.”  It made the soldier grin against his neck.  Tony looped his hand around the back of Steve’s neck again, the other clutching the bedsheets.
And damn it, he knew she was going to play that card.  Tony sighed.  “One writer and one photographer only, and I want to read it before it goes to print.”
Naked now save for his socks and boots, Steve seized Tony around the waist and lifted him, pressing his back against the closed door.  Tony immediately wrapped his legs around Steve.  “Can you handle it a little rough?” Steve asked.  He’d retrieved a bottle of lube from his tactical belt, slicking up his fingers and already searching for Tony’s hole.
“I’ll say.”  Tony nuzzled his cheek, carefully rocking his hips where they were still joined.  Steve sucked in a surprised breath.  “You want to go again?”
“If you’re arguing because you don’t want me to touch, I’ll stop.  If you think I don’t want it or this is out of obligation – ”  Tony shifted again, this time to straddle Steve.  “Then you’re a moron, Steve Rogers.”
“Stop thinking,” Steve whispered in his ear, driving in for another thrust.  “Just let me make you feel good, doll.”
Chuckling, Steve took the bait.  “Alright.”
Steve slid his arm around Tony’s waist.  “So… will you discipline me for it?”
“As long as you’re happy, I’m happy.”  Rhodey yawned.  “Go be happy so I can get some rest.  Night, martini.”
Tony gasped at the combined pleasure of Steve inside him and the pressure on his cock – and it only took a few strokes of Steve’s hand for him to oblige and spill between them, gasping and rocking helplessly against Steve.
“No,” Tony agreed easily.  He pressed a kiss to the back of Steve’s neck.  “Usually doesn’t hurt, though.”  Steve continued to assault the bag, and Tony moved with him.  His left hand shifted slightly until he was teasing Steve’s nipple to hardness through his damp t-shirt.  The right moved lower, finding the stirrings of arousal already building in Steve’s cock.
Well, hell.  If that’s what he wanted… Steve managed a few more thrusts, feeling Tony quivering around him, purposely tightening, before he was coming hard.  Lights burst behind his eyes and he was vaguely aware that he was making noise as he thrust through his orgasm, his whole body trembling with the force of it.
“I mean it.”  Steve cupped his hands around Tony’s face.  “Maybe not yet – I’m kind of enjoying where we’re at right now.  But I can see trading up titles in the future.”  He drew Tony in for a kiss, shifted to breath in his ear.  “Maybe upgrading from partner to husband?”
Tony did – he always did.  “Don’t be a smartass.  You know what I mean.  Touch me more, please.”
The first touch, the slow slide – it made Tony whimper and arch up against him.  Steve’s hand released his cock and instead moved to hold Tony’s hips still.  “God, please,” Tony whined.
“Thought you’d never ask.”  Grinning like a fool, Steve brought Tony’s hand up to his mouth and kissed it.
“You’re a fucking troll.”  It came out less of an insult and more of a strangled moan as Tony rocked against Steve’s fingers.
“Nerd.”  Tony leaned in and kissed Steve, his hand continuing a slow stroke.  “I’m sure DUM-E tried to douse you in flame retardant.”
Steve silenced him with a kiss.  “Do you know how long I’ve waited to be able to do this?  To take my best guy out?”  He smoothed his thumb over Tony’s knuckles.  “I didn’t get a chance – before.  I’m not letting somebody with a camera stop me now.  They can think whatever they want – print whatever lies they want.”  He leaned closer to Tony, his breath tickling against Tony’s ear.  “They can’t take you away from me.  They can’t take away Iron Man, or my shield.  They can’t break up the Avengers.  The rest?  I don’t give a flying fuck.”
Tony shook his head frantically.  “I can’t believe I – I promised myself I’d never – baby, I’m so sorry.”  Then his eyes widened.  “God, I can’t even say that, because isn’t that what they always say?”
A smile grew on the supersoldier’s face.  “Yeah?”  He rubbed his cheek against Tony’s cock and added a third finger.  “I like being able to say it aloud.  I call you that in my head all the time.”
“Aren’t you sore?  Jesus, I wasn’t exactly gentle.”
Either way, Tony kind of figured he should do something to distract the good Captain before he either caused a rash of swooning SHIELD nurses or got jabbed with a sedative.
“No complaints from me,” Steve said as he sank into one of the seats.
Tony stood up, smoothing his hands over Steve’s ass.  “You’re alright, baby.”  Steve was shivering beneath his hands.  “Can you drop down on your belly for me, sweetheart?  You’re too tall up here.”  Steve obliged, shimmy backwards until he was standing next to the bed, laying forward over the mattress.  Tony used the time to add more lube to his cock.  He didn’t make Steve wait any longer – as soon as he was still, Tony pressed into him slowly.
“Sure, now you’re a stickler for rules.”  Steve rolled onto his side to face Tony.  “I suppose you’ve got a plan for this, too?”
“Oh my God, it’s real.”  She looked at them in shock.  Tony didn’t let people touch the reactor.  He’d been near death the only times she’d been allowed that kind of liberty.
“I do too, doll – but I want more.”  Steve lowered Tony onto the bed, pausing to kiss him tenderly.  “You have no idea how hard it’s been to hold back.  Not to shower you with love every time we touch.  How much it ached to pull away from you afterwards and pretend it didn’t mean anything.”  He cupped his hand around Tony’s cheek, feeling his heart swell when Tony nuzzled into his hand.  “God, I love you.”
They panted together for several minutes before Tony started to chuckle.  “I have never needed as many showers before,” he managed to say between laughter.
“Go to sleep, Tony,” Steve urged.  He ran a hand down the engineer’s back, as soothingly as he could.
“You can’t seriously think this is a good idea,” Tony said flatly, staring at Pepper.  “This is – this is a monumentally bad idea.  This is – fuck, this is Spring Break ’92 levels of bad idea, Pep.”
“I thought we weren’t talking about it.”
“You sure?”  This time there was humor in Tony’s tone, and Steve shot him an outraged look over his shoulder.  “I’m just checking, sweetheart.”  Resettling, Tony removed his fingers and used just his tongue, working the flexible muscle all around Steve’s hole.  He felt the faint tremors as Steve tried to hold still and was unable to – felt him rock back against Tony’s tongue and moan, low and aching.
There was that fluttering again.  Steve smiled.  “Yeah.”  He nuzzled Tony’s cheek before kissing him again.  “Just between you and me.  It’s a matter between – between co-leaders, right?”
“Don’t need them,” Tony said, reaching his hands to Steve eagerly.  “But… I mean if you…”
"Want to see me bend Hawkeye over a table... he's so flexible, I bet he can do acrobatics in bed, yeah?  Maybe find out if Thor is really that big all over?"  Steve's breath was hot on the back of Tony's neck.  "Find out if Bruce really does Hulk out during sex... maybe find out if I could take him."
A quick search of his eyes, and Steve nodded – before resuming his almost brutal pace.  Tony cried out, his eyes rolling back.  Steve didn’t stop, pounding all his frustration and desperation into Tony, clinging hard to him and whimpering himself as he raced toward orgasm.
“It’s my responsibility,” Steve whispered.  The hands he had around Tony shifted so that he could slip one hand under the hem of the undershirt, stroke the soft skin of Tony’s lower back.
Happy pulled the car up finally and Steve opened the door, letting Tony climb in first before joining him.  He directed Happy to the theater and sat back, lacing his fingers in Tony’s.  “You okay, doll?”
“Do you want to talk to her, doll?”
“How can I be an ex if I’m not even a boyf– ”
Raking his teeth along the vein on the bottom of Steve’s cock, Tony felt the fingers in his hair tighten.  Good – let him find a second orgasm fast.  It would make working for three and four more satisfying.  Tony worked two of his own fingers into his mouth beside Steve’s cock, slobbering sufficiently to wet them so that he could press against Steve’s asshole with them.
Pepper wanted to ask.  God, she wanted to know about whatever relationship Steve had been in before that gave him the easy confidence to make that statement – but one glance at Tony told her not to push.  “So, you have the team’s support?”  That stung too – that the teammates he’d so recently befriended had known before she did.
Now naked, Tony grinned up at Steve.  “I think since you’re so concerned that I’m tired, you should work yourself open… and then do all the work by riding me.”
“I like taking care of you.”  He bent to kiss Tony one more time before walking into the bathroom.  He cleaned himself off and returned to do the same to his lover, his touch gentle.  “You ready for sleep, or you want to turn on a movie?”
Once they were in the elevator, all bets were off.  Steve immediately tugged Tony’s shirt out of his waistband, sliding his hands up underneath it to stroke the warm skin of his back.  “This suit looks incredible,” the supersoldier murmured against Tony’s neck, “but I want you out of it.  Right now.”
"Always prepared," Tony grinned over his shoulder, amused despite his desperation.
“Don’t touch Tony’s coffee… unless you want the fuck of your life.”
"Fuck yes," Tony moaned.  He reached for the arm around his waist, fingers locking onto the tight forearm.  "Which infraction is that, Rogers?  Was that swearing on an open comm, or..."
Steve unwound one hand from the fabric and slid it into Tony’s hair.  He feathered his fingers through the silky strands.  “Feels good, doll.”
Trust Steve to think of the safety of fucking paparazzi.  Still, Tony didn’t disagree.  He nodded slowly and took Steve’s hand.
“God, I love you.”  Steve leaned forward and kissed Tony deeply.  He hadn’t asked Tony to stop drinking – not even to cut down.  That he would do it unprompted made Steve warm all over.
“Don’t talk about it, and don’t do it off the field.”
“I love you too.”  It was still weird to say it – and he didn’t, always – but it was good too.  Tony started to move his hand faster on Steve, adding a second hand to fondle his balls… and edge a little further back.
“Sorry.”  Steve panted.  “Wound up, a little.”
Steve’s hand flew to the back of his head and he gasped.  “Fuck, do that again.”
Steve smiled a little.  In a way, it was nice to see that declaring his love for Tony hadn’t changed everything between them.  “Yes, sir.”  He enjoyed the flush on Tony’s cheeks from the honorific as he shucked out of his clothes.
Steve braced himself over Tony, low enough that their chests brushed together, and kissed him hard as his hips snapped forward.  Tony moaned into the kiss, meeting Steve’s thrust with a roll of his own hips.  “Ah, hell, sweetheart,” Steve whispered, breaking the kiss to drop his head onto Tony’s shoulder.  “This is going to be over really fast if you keep that up.”
“Yeah.  Right.”  Tony tried to believe that – but he’d seen the paparazzi outside.  Hell, the patrons in the restaurant had cell phones.  This would be all over the internet before they even got to dessert.  He cleared his throat.  “I mean.  Yes… you know I do… um.”
Tony smiled and kissed him again before tugging away.  “Anytime.”  He retrieved the damp but now cold towel and wiped them both off.  For a heart-stopping moment, Steve was afraid he was going to leave – but Tony merely deposited the used towels in the hamper in the bathroom before crawling into the bed.  Though they’d only slept in a bed together once, there was no awkwardness.  Steve held open his arms and Tony nestled into them as though they’d done it for years.
Seeing Tony like that beneath him – desperate and pleaded – lit something in Steve.  “Mine,” he bit out, dropping his head to kiss Tony’s neck.  “You’re mine.”  His pace picked up until he was thrusting almost too hard – almost too fast.  They were both groaning, fingers clawing at skin and breath catching in their chests.  “No one else gets to see you like this doll, never again.”  He bit down on the flesh of Tony’s shoulder, his hips stuttering.
He sighs.
Tony’s phone buzzes. It’s Rhodey’s number.
“I did that to you, didn’t I? I broke your heart in every possible way.”
“Let me clean you up,” Steve says, and his hands are careful and attentive on Tony’s skin, gentle, as if to make up for last night. As if he’s trying to atone for sins no one is holding him accountable for.
He spits on me.
“Yeah.”
Tony snorts. “Well, not having to breathe is a big help, I imagine. You don’t… choke on it... Can we talk about something else?”
“And I hope you don’t, uh… take advantage of this, in the future, because… that’d be…”
“Eh, I’m old and wise.”
“And you’ve always been an idealist. But there’s no room for ideals here, Avenger. Come on.”
Steve doesn’t know how to respond. He wishes he could touch Tony, show him how he feels in a way that doesn’t require Steve to say things, that doesn’t force him to make sense of his scattered thoughts and adapt them to the constricting limits of human language. He wishes he could paint for Tony, that he could translate his confession into colors, and be understood.
“Try turning him off and on again, it usually works.”
Steve looks like he’s doing his best not to say what he says next, but his stomach must take over his brain. “A couple more? Maybe. Sorry.”
, Tony thinks, because he still expected a minimum amount of respect from Steve and instead he gets… this. What is it? Pity? Mockery? Steve gets to play out his little outdated fantasy in his head so he doesn’t feel too bad about wanting to fuck without bonding or some shit, while Tony gets… nothing. Absolutely nothing beyond satisfying his curiosity about what Steve’s knot must feel like, because he still wants that. He still wants Steve; he needs to be honest with himself at least while it’s happening. He wishes things were different, sure, that Steve really loved him, that this led to something that wasn’t just
He doesn’t really say the word, though. He only mouths it, softly, and the effort to make his cracked lips form the ghost of a sound is a new torture on its own. He tastes blood, after.
But still, Steve expected Tony be more—
They are alone in the living room; everyone else knows better than being found here at a moment like this.
“There was… there were weapons, alien tech, but… not the Chitauri’s tech, it was—”
He braces with his free hand on the sink. He tightens his grip on himself, flicks his wrist. The bracelet scrapes against his abdomen. It doesn’t matter.
The man manages to kick Steve away; he throws Tony to the ground and gets his hands around his neck.
“On it!” Sarah says in a very solemn voice, and she dashes out the room while Tony shouts at her not to run down the stairs.
For the first time in his life, he feels other humans reach out to him from the stream of time and tell him,
Steve blushes even more when he sees Tony, and quickly stumbles to his side of the room to get dressed.
Steve takes his fingers out of Tony and gingerly licks them clean. Tony watches him, and the way Steve does it, how natural he is about it, how normal it all seems, gives him a little pang of regret for all the time they wasted, just below his heart.
“I don’t know, Tony. I just hope you will allow me the chance to earn your friendship back. That one day you’ll look at me and see past what I kept from you, what I did to you. But to answer your question, I only know how I feel. And I know that I’m not half as good at... at anything as I am when I’m doing it next to you.”
Shit.
“Fine, I… Fuck.”
, and Tony knows Steve means this earthly life, not just after waking up from the ice. He means his entire life.
“Why do you have that?” Tony asks pointing at the clock.
“No, that’s not right. I kissed her. We, we both kissed, uh, we kissed each—We kissed.”
He’s in space.
It’s not very bright anymore. It’s wilted. Rusted, almost. Muted and still like a wounded animal.
“I’m glad for him and Nat. It’s a good thing.”
It’s blue. The envelope, and probably the sheets of paper inside too. Very elegant, clearly expensive. Might have been scented, too, back then.
“You’re not gonna get—”
Steve is not a poet, he is versed in different kinds of art, but this is it, this must be what centuries of literature are about: holding someone, that someone holding you back, promises of never letting go.
And now, all of a sudden, he is
Tony tosses him a clean t-shirt, and Steve wears it quickly with a nod of thanks.
“See, this is what I meant,” Steve says then, very quietly, looking into the distance, “This is what I miss. You. And how I am when I’m with you.”
Then Steve hugs him. Doesn’t kiss him, doesn’t touch him, he just takes Tony into his arms and keeps him there.
Steve is smiling, easy and soft, still completely naked in front of Tony, and Tony can’t help but huff a small laugh in reply and shake his head.
“That’s not true. But we can learn how to figure things out when it happens. We’ve done it a few times already this past week. You won’t make me believe that doesn’t mean anything to you.”
office. Right.
Too much thinking.
“And you?” Steve asks it as if his entire life doesn’t depend on the answer.
“No,” Nat says, “I don’t think he will.”
Someone honks at them.
Tony smiles at that.
Tony is patient. Steve has earned it.
“That, too.”
“Sure, uh… no problem. I’m gonna take a shower.”
There’s not much to look at, actually. It’s just a clothes shop. There are a few people inside, three shop assistants and a bunch of clients. One exits the door with her purchase while Steve and Tony are standing there, kinda awkwardly. She gives them a look and walks away.
Tony walks beside Steve; they cast two long shadows over the white gravel trail. It’s like they’re trying to walk over those dark shapes on the ground, but can never really reach them.
“The only person I love more than you is our daughter. Nothing else comes even close. I can’t just watch you suffer in silence. No more punishment, we agreed.”
A noise drags his attention away from the man and back to Steve.
“I wanted to say thank you.”
“Come vuoi.”
But this is not pain. This is relief.
“I don’t think that.”
“I should’ve told you about your parents.”
“Hey, no—” Steve says, and
Oh, god.
He shivers, but no blanket would make him warm right now.
“If you want to go to bed early—”
It’s like a punch to the gut, if a punch to the gut was the best thing that could possibly happen to anyone and you spent the last two years dreaming of taking one from a very specific person.
“It did feel nice. I haven’t been touched like this since… It felt nice. Thank you.”
I used to be able to fight him in the armor.
He dreams of them digging a shallow grave outside, in the cold. They adjust Steve and Tony inside it—Steve still wearing his uniform, Tony still in the armor. Bucky rips a piece of cloth from his shirt and secures Steve’s head to the rest of his body while Rhodey holds it in place. Then, they place the shield, spattered with blood, over their lifeless faces, like a blanket. They’re careful and sweet as they cover their corpses with dirt and snow.
Tony started to move – tried to go slow, and knew he wouldn’t be able to stay that way.  Within minutes he was moving almost as fast as he could, clawing at Steve’s shoulders and hips, desperate to get just that much closer, that much deeper.  Steve spread his legs as wide as his enhanced flexibility would allow, meeting Tony’s thrusts with his own movements.  “So close, sweetheart… oh, God!”
“Yes, and we never did it again,” Steve protests. “Your jaw ached for days,” he adds, lower, touching Tony’s face as though he can stroke away an old wound and make sure it won’t happen again. He’s such a sweet Alpha.
Oh, so that’s why Tony is upset. The big I’m-buying-this-whole-grocery-store-chain-in-particular-because-I-saved-a-nine-year-old-girl-from-a-burning-building-once-and-she-told-me-she-was-alone-at-night-because-her-mom-was-working-shitty-hours-so-they-could-afford-food-and-I-just-couldn’t-fucking-stand-it business.
“I know.”
Steve stretches back down on the bed and meets Tony’s eyes, meets him in his mind.
It never comes. He’s free of it.
Steve covers Tony’s face with his hand and ruffles his hair. “Shut up,” he says, laughing. Tony kisses Steve’s thigh and falls asleep.
“I still feel so guilty.”
They take their bags and go inside. The man shows them their room—it’s not big, but it’s clean and looks cared for. There are two twin beds, so Steve won’t need to sleep on the floor, after all. Tony speaks with the man for a couple of minutes, asks him to please leave the key in the lock, takes it from there when the man leaves, and closes the door.
He deserves that. Probably. Yeah.
Tony raises his hands to Steve’s face—he’s not crying. Tony brushes his fingers over Steve’s lips, and he gasps, startled by the touch, by how much he craves this contact. Tony feels minuscule kisses being pressed against his fingertips.
“Even though?”
Nothing. It leaves him as quick as it started. It’s so fast that he doesn’t even really have the time to be truly disappointed about it, or lament the loss of his barely-there erection.
The light is gone.
Steve places a hand over Tony’s cheek. He caresses the bag under his eye with his thumb. “Sleep now, alright?”
“So,” Steve starts, “I read the chapter from Stella’s book.”
“It’s the first time you do it like this, right? With someone else.”
“Everything you’re willing to tell,” Tony says, and hopes his voice doesn’t waver like his heart.
They break his other leg, and an ankle, and a foot.
He probably deserves that, actually.
Tony didn’t look. He only felt the blunt, wet tip of the man’s cock press into him, which he hadn’t been expecting at all, so he let out a small, terrified, “No, no,” before realizing that nothing he could ever say would change anything; that there was nothing he could possibly have to say here, to this man, to make him stop. So he never said anything else.
Steve zips her coat up and takes a minute to hug her tight. She smells better; Tony must have already noticed too. He’s surprised the change is so rapid. He holds her for too long; he doesn’t want to let her go, but he has to. He blows a raspberry in her neck and makes her laugh and screech, and she says, “Now
“Tony let’s… What do you say you take the armor off and tell me what happened? We can sit on the—”
“How did you sleep?” Steve asks.
“Is it normal that I went months without being able to have an orgasm? I may not be twenty years old or a super soldier, Steve, but no, that’s not normal.”
“It always hurt.”
“Not even that day?”
“No. I lied in the book. I never lied to you. I’m just telling you for the first time. Did you really want me to tell you this over the phone, or in an email?”
His hips stutter, and all the tension is released at once, in an ugly groan that he tries to stifle with all his might.
“You had insomnia?”
And that would be it. Maybe he would even get an invitation to the wedding. Steve would go.
He regrets his hesitation, earlier, in Strange’s home. He wishes his finger had obeyed him.
Tony mouths the words softly. He knows them. He knows them.
“It was just a bad dream,” Tony says, his voice still low and rough with sleep.
“Of course there’s a team.”
He doesn’t know how many miles he covers, but he tries to check his watch every so often, so he can get back in two hours like he told Tony he would. He doesn’t want to be late or too early. He wants to do exactly what he said. No surprises. No mistakes. No unexpected change of plans.
“Because of what she could tell you?”
is more powerful than anywhere else.
“I drew this before I met you,” Steve says, quietly, without looking at Tony. “I told you I didn’t like the tower, but—”
Steve’s whole body goes rigid.
Steve opens and closes his mouth, then opens and closes it again. He blushes, and looks down at the floor, confused.
Steve’s chest rises and falls with the rhythm of his breathing. He looks up, at Tony’s face, lifts an arm to press his hand to Tony’s neck, in that position that has become almost a comfort for Tony at this point.
Tony feels it so deep inside himself, this sense of belonging. She’s his and he’s hers in a way he didn’t think was possible.
And there’s only one thing Steve can say, so he says it.
For a moment, Tony is made pure and perfect. He becomes sheer intention, disconnected from the vagaries of execution.
. He adjusts the seat and puts the safety-belt on. He drives off.
It kicks his brain into motion, and he’s already starting to devise ways to go back to how he was, which wasn’t much bigger than this but it was still better, right, when he feels Steve tentatively touching his shoulder.
Steve looks at Tony’s lean feet in the darkness, at the elegant architecture of his ankles, the soft hairs covering his skin.
Sarah cries out.
“I need—” he hears himself say, and he has no idea how he wanted to finish the sentence.
And he fucked it up and just—
She’s about to cry and Steve feels like jumping out of a fucking window.
“Maybe you’re right. Part of me thinks that if it ended with Bucky safe, then... But he’s not safe. I didn’t really help him.”
Tony wants to scream. He’s a terrible Omega, he’s always been, and he rebels against Steve holding him down, not because he doesn’t want to be but because he likes to be a challenge, he likes to push at Steve’s buttons and play with fire. But he’s also oversensitive and overstimulated in a deeply unsettling way, and his consent doesn’t change the fact that everything is too much, too much,
Of course he did.
“These are handmade, you know,” Tony says, suddenly. He’s clutching his unused fork in his hand, looking down at it like nothing in the world could possibly be more interesting.
“Did your invitation have a typo or something? Party’s still an hour away.”
“He told me,” Stella says, even though Steve will be back in a minute, even though Steve can hear everything not matter how quietly she speaks. “He didn’t go into detail, but I asked, and he said.”
A man is called in; he throws a bucket of water over me.
Obviously the staircase had always been there. It was just hidden inside the stone. Someone only needed to coax it out. Convince it.
“A bit. I didn’t know what it was.”
“Eleven.”
“We always try to do our best, Tony. But we can’t save everyone. I know you know that.”
He feels a sharp jolt of pain at the sides of his chest, above his ribs. He tries to relax his muscles, keep his shoulders down, straighten his posture. He takes a couple of deep breaths and it goes away.
On top of that, Tony feels incredibly warm. But most of all, he feels
Steve is the most beautiful thing. The sun diving into the sea at sunset, the non-existent sound of the Iron Man armor slashing through the clouds, the void in Tony’s stomach the first time he flew—Steve. Tony runs towards him, meets him in the middle of some kind of inward road that stretches between them, touches the brilliant ghost of Steve’s soul with his own. They intertwine, swirl together.
Tony doesn’t.
“Got it in one. You’re not just pretty to look at, then.”
“We’re going to eat something called panino col lampredotto. Lampredotto is the final part of the stomach of a cow. It’s chopped up and boiled and served in a sandwich dipped in broth, then it’s seasoned with lots of salt and pepper. You can top it with a spicy sauce or salsa verde, or both. It’s super good and I haven’t eaten it since, like, 1999, so we are going to eat it now.”
Then, Steve would brush his fingers over Tony’s hip, scrape at the red bruise with his nails. Tony would hiss in response, and fist his erection even tighter. Maybe he actually does.
Stella’s face turns very serious. “No, I guess she wasn’t. She thought moving to the States would ensure she’d never live the horrors of the war again, and she didn’t. But that wasn’t enough to make her happy. Maria was very ambitious, just like her father. They made sacrifices to get what they wanted.”
Tony blinks once. He doesn’t know how to soothe Steve, though. He’s fine. Really.
Tony’s silk boxers make him look almost more exposed than he’d be if he were naked, to Steve’s eyes—still prim in some ways. How sharp and taut all his muscles seem under the perennial light of the reactor. How much Steve wishes Tony would let him slide a hand under the soft silk to free him of all his worries, of that awful tension lodged between his shoulder blades. He’d press a hand over Tony’s mouth to keep his screams from being too loud, and he’d use his knee to stroke Tony’s balls through his orgasm. And Tony would look at him afterwards, and let out a sated sigh through his smiling lips, and Steve would kiss him, and Tony would love him back.
Howard.
“Said the billionaire to the king.” T'Challa gets out of the car. “Good luck, my friend,” he says while holding the door open, and Tony looks at him. He doesn’t know if they’re friends, but the word makes the corner of his mouth tug upwards.
“Hey. It’s okay. Everything’s okay, my love.”
Steve’s breath hitches, his chest shaken by a horrible convulsion. He covers his face with his hands, and Tony spares a moment to mourn the loss of Steve’s skin on his.
Big fucking deal.
“Were you—either of you—were you... hurt?”
“I know, I’m sorry, I just. That first time in the gym I just felt, well. You looked at me like you loved me, and I couldn’t risk believing that. So I tried to stop looking at you. I was afraid I’d let something stupid slip out of my mouth like I always do, so I kept my mouth shut too. It’s stupid, I know, I–”
“Umpf.”
After the weekend Steve feels as if his entire world has been tilted, like something very obvious has changed even though everything more or less looks the same.
Steve follows Tony back into the car. Very carefully, he attaches his phone to the USB slot. The vibration is as loud as a scream, but Tony doesn’t move.
“Sorry. For a moment there I really… And I never know how present you are when you… You seem kinda out of it at times.”
A beat, and Steve squints at him. He smiles, the vestiges of his anguish leaving his face, even though they linger in his eyes, outstay their welcome there. “You’re literally wearing my t-shirt. At this exact moment.”
He blinks. “Oh, that’s… that’s a nice shirt,” he mutters, evidently regretting every word as soon as it exits his mouth, or maybe wishing they came to him smoother, more naturally than this. He looks down, at the carpet covering the floor of Tony’s room, then he lifts his head to give Tony a timid smile in lieu of an apology.
. Tony hasn’t said anything at all.
Here, they can find the courage to ask the hard questions and be ready to bear the weight of the answer; they can stay calm, keep the anger and the hurt at bay; they can say,
“Absolutely not. We’re staying here.”
“I don’t know how I survived all these years without you,” Steve continues. Only Sarah kept them sane, really.
He throws his legs over the edge of the bed. He drinks his eggs, swallows the slice of pie in two gigantic bites, washes it all down with the coffee. It’s on the cold side of lukewarm, so Tony must’ve been up for a while.
thing to do.”
Tony jerks back, but Steve doesn’t let him go, so he grabs Steve’s t-shirt in his fists. Steve clutches his hip in response, hard, to keep him from running away, to keep him from falling over; but he’s squeezing too hard, so hard it’s gonna bruise—and maybe if there’s a sign that any of this happened, if it’s written on Tony’s body in dark spots of displaced blood, if Tony can look at himself later and have proof, then perhaps…
“Real clever. You must be a really smart guy.”
Steve shivers.
“Yes and no,” Tony says, voice all pain. “It’s because I don’t know what it is, and I can’t predict how I’ll react to it, and I’m scared... I’m so fucking scared.”
"I got you, Tony."  Steve's hand worked his cock just as thoroughly as Steve's cock was working Tony's ass... and he just couldn't hold on any longer.  Tony felt the orgasm rising up from the ground, swamping him more thoroughly than any enemy they'd fought.  His body bucked and writhed under Steve's, but Steve never stopped.  Tony cried out at least once -- he couldn't remember which noises were in his head and which came out his mouth -- as he painted the reflective star of Steve's uniform with his own stripes.
Obligingly, Steve shifted position until Tony could curl his fingers up into Steve’s hole – infinitely more satisfying than doing it to himself.  Steve dropped his head, leaning into Tony’s touch.  “Thought you were – oh God, right there – thought you were tired.”
Returning the kisses, Tony shifted his free hand between them to Steve’s cock, lightly stroking.  He didn’t think it would take much – Steve was already making the soft panting noises that heralded his orgasm.  For that matter, Tony wasn’t going to last long either – he’d had his hands all over ever inch of Steve’s body, and that would push anybody close to the edge.
“Any time.”  Steve started to work at Tony’s clothes – more complicated than his own, but he managed.  He had to duck to allow Tony to tug his undershirt off over his head, but it was worth it when he could finally press their bare chests together.  He was always surprised that the arc reactor was skin temperature – somehow he expected it to be icy to match the blue, or warm to match the power.  Steve slid his hands down Tony’s sides.  “What do you want tonight, sweetheart?”
“God, Tony, more,” Steve begged.  “Please.”
Pepper crossed her arms over her chest.  “You’re taking it a bit far, aren’t you?”
"They're all so -- fucking hell, Steve, right there -- God, they're all so damned pretty."  Tony was starting to sweat, and his legs were trembling.
“Please…” Steve whispered.  “I can’t – Tony, you gotta – please – ”
“No, this is a lot more fun.”  Tony scooted closer so that he could kiss Steve, the water sloshing against the tub.  For a moment it made Tony freeze, but he was able to push past it.  “What is it you said to me?  Lie back and think of SHIELD?”  He wrapped his fingers around Steve’s cock, pumping it slowly.
“You have me,” Steve murmured.  He pressed another kiss to Tony’s lips, deciding that was a sufficient answer.  He stood smoothly, then lifted Tony into his arms to resituate him on the bed.  Gently he placed the smaller man in the middle of the massive mattress and straddled him, bending down to kiss him again.
Moaning, Tony nodded.  “Yeah – yeah, okay.”  As he ran his fingers through Steve’s hair, he had to wonder – whose skin?  But those thoughts fluttered out his brain when Steve added a second finger.  “God, it shouldn’t feel this much different, should it?  Nothing’s changed, right?”
“I know.”  Tony sighed and turned to face Steve.  He took the tie out of his unresisting hand and slung it around Steve’s neck.  “I can’t help but think of how unlike the team’s reaction everyone else’s will be.”
Tony bucked up against him.  “I warned you about calling me that,” he moaned.  “God, who wouldn’t want to be called sir by Captain America?”
“I like it when you’re rough,” Steve protested, rocking against Tony’s hand.
“I didn’t actually think it could get hotter,” Tony remarked eventually.  “The sex.  I didn’t realize – ”
Steve laughed, kissing Tony lightly.  “I didn’t say it to derail the conversation, babydoll.”  He saw a flicker in Tony’s eyes and shook his head, still smiling.  “I still mean it.  Just didn’t intend to have you throw Pepper out.”
And fucking hell, Tony realized what he was feeling.  He completely was not prepared for it, and totally not okay – but it was really hard to argue with it.  Goddamn it, he was falling for Captain Steven Grant Rogers, and that was unacceptable.
Both options sucked at the moment, but at least in a bath Tony wouldn’t have to get his face wet.  “Bath.”  He let Steve fuss over him – it was so damned nice to be cared for.  “It’s his own fear talkin’, I think.  Do you know…” Steve trailed off, testing the heat of the water before plugging the tub.  “Do you know who hurt him?  Somebody did, right?”
“Yes I am,” Tony agreed, tilting his head back to give Steve better access.  He feathered his hand through the silky blond hair.
"Only up to thirty-two strokes," Steve teased, but he was hanging on by a thread.  "Gotta make sure you really appreciate your punishment."
“It’s just – it’s not my own reputation at risk, here.  It’s yours, Steve – and the Avengers.”  Tony shivered a little.  “I’m not sure I want to know what they’re going to say about… about two…”
Smiling, Tony folded himself awkwardly so that he could place a kiss at the end of Steve’s rapidly hardening cock.  “More orgasms for us, I guess.”  He began to kiss along the length, his fingers never stopping their gentle stretching of Steve’s hole.
“You love me anyway.”  Steve kissed him – hard.  “Go back to the table, beautiful.  I’ll be along in a minute.”
Tony closes his eyes.
He watches me fight. He wears his golden mask.
He calms down only when Howard is away. When we are alone, it's a thought the world disappears, and we are just a mom and a child. I play piano for him and I pretend I don't see him looking at me from the sofa, making up some joke to make me laugh or shock me, or choosing some crazy prank to tell me about.
(See the end of the chapter for
He screams again, one last time, one last useless attempt at calling for help, and suddenly—
He’s sitting on his throne, on an elevated platform. At his side, ministers and nobles.
And Steve can’t deny him anything, least of all this. So harder it is.
Steve growls, pushing Tony’s face against the wall.
Tony tapes the gauze to Steve’s skin. His eyes are so bright like this, just after he has cried, but Tony likes them better when they’re dry. Tony resists the urge to comb his fingers through Steve’s hair, caress his cheek.
“He said anything? Steve.”
And he can feel it. Somewhere deep in his bones, there are aches that didn’t use to be there. His muscles have lost some of their definition, his belly is definitely softer, his ass not as firm. The hair, the goatee. His chest and pubic hair. The mere fact that he stopped giving a shit about shaving them. His skin is drier, coarser, he has wrinkles. He needs an anti-aging cream. He needs reading glasses. Thank fuck his teeth are still perfect. And that he isn’t balding. Oh god, he could cry with joy because at least he isn’t balding.
“I keep dreaming…” he says, between a sob and the other, “I keep dreaming that the only way we can solve this is if we… if we… if I...”
Yeah. Yeah, no.
“Too much?”
—date, during which Tony acted disrespectfully, to say the least. Yeah, Steve’s not gonna bite him.
A sweater. Christ.
They saw each other again two years later, when the sky was dark and some purple alien fucker that looked like a used condom wanted to destroy the planet.
“Listen, I’ll see what I can do, I—”
Tony breathes, doesn’t speak, doesn’t make a sound—but his eyes, now, are wide open, huge and shiny.
Tony just waits by the window, kissing the head of his daughter and not thinking about how much she looks like her father.
“Am not—”
But instead he just—
They say goodbye.
Afternoon snack for children.
Steve’s eyes go wide, and something escapes his mouth, something between a whimper and a laugh. His shoulders shake, his entire face brightens up.
Tony’s fingers in Steve’s mouth. Tony’s fingers inside his—
“It’s amazing. It only sounds disgusting. It’s spongy.”
“But beating you up… that was… I don’t wanna say
Steve wonders if Rhodey has heard from Sam at all.
“Steve—”
He doesn’t say,
Steve shrugs a hoodie on and goes outside. The wind has picked up, and lightning strikes the sky again. He walks around the guest house, but Tony isn’t there.
, but these are the very last moments of Tony’s life and Steve doesn’t want to lie.
Steve runs.
For the rest, they’re just playing with the serum. Testing it out, stretching it to its limits.
Steve looks at him—passed out, head hanging low on his chest in a heavy way, but visibly breathing. He’s been stripped of his armor, reactor nowhere to be seen. They took away his watch, his glasses, even his tie and his suit jacket. Everything. All his toys and anything else he could use to build something or call someone.
“Yeah, but he was nice about it.”
There are no real consequences for what they did.
He passes out, from exhaustion and pain, still trying to chase after Tony’s scent on the pillows.
“Is that a sword in a stone?” He walks closer to it. “That’s a sword in a stone! Ha!”
He turns to look at Steve, who looks back, curious and a bit startled, his book still open as though he’s sure he’ll go back to reading it in a moment.
, as she would have said.
, he’d say if he could talk.
I don’t know what he means. I’m still what? Good? Happy? Alive?
They explore each other, look and taste and get used to each other. There’s Steve’s sweetness, his kindness and sense of fairness, his pride, his sense of justice, his selflessness. There’s the love he has for his friends—the flowery scent of Thor’s hair, Natasha’s broken smile, Sam’s laugh—and there’s his duty to humanity at large, then his ability to fight, to learn, to improvise and strategize. There’s his past, the puncture of loss, bittersweet memories that he lets Tony see and touch. Red lipstick and wool, a brother with dark hair and blue eyes and a smile that never quite reaches them, a group of friends sharing jokes and a stiff drink between unfamiliar trees, a tired woman with blond hair just like Steve’s. Tony recognizes them. There’s the fear of war, the cold, the darkness. Then, there’s a part of Steve that doesn’t quite respond like everything else. It feels hard and unmoving, and it’s pushing Tony away. He’s confused at the discovery but he doesn’t dwell on it. Maybe it’s the years Steve spent in the ice.
“Sorry. I know. I’m sorry.”
“Yeah, and I was a giant hypocrite.”
Mistakes. They can destroy you.
What kind of bullshit.
“It makes me sleepy, though. Not drinking... it can happen. It’ll pass, it’s just a temporary side effect. It’s only been a few weeks.”
While he changes into running clothes, Steve checks his wound in the bathroom. The bruise around it is already green and yellow. The scab itches, but it’ll be gone by tomorrow morning. He removes the bandage, so it can breathe a little. He tells Tony, shows him the wound tugging his t-shirt away from his neck. Tony just nods, guilt still clouding his eyes.
“I don’t really think I owe you an explanation, but for the record, he’s just a friend. A dear friend. Which I was still allowed to have without your permission last time I checked.”
“It wasn’t. Don’t be unfair. You know what I mean.”
Tony grabs Steve’s wrist, brings his hand up to his own mouth, and plants a kiss—the most delicate touch of his lips—on Steve’s fingers.
“Alright. Wake me up if you need me, okay? Anything at all.”
Tony washes his face and hands, Steve looks at him from the open door. He does the same after a few minutes, and comes out of the bathroom to see Tony on the terrace, looking into the distance, thoughtful.
“Everything alright?”
“We’ll leave you to it, alright?” he whispers, and she nods.
“Okay.”
“You got me a tie from the
He promised.
“Hello,” he mumbles, and Steve sighs into the hollow of his throat, breathing hard, muscles taut with exertion.
, Tony thinks.
They don’t go past kissing, that night. But Steve isn’t shy about caressing and touching him, or about leaving a trail of hickeys across his collarbones. Steve cups his ass with his hands and squeezes, and it feels so good to be touched with so much attention after so long, after, after—
“If you ask me, it’s fucked up that they won’t leave you be, but it’s good that you have a way to protect yourself. As tiring as it may be.”
“You wanna go back? Why?”
Electricity.
“Whole.”
What if it never goes away?
He’s wheezing, hoarse and disoriented.
“Cut off one head, huh?”
“The only good thing that came out of this mess, maybe, is self-awareness regarding the state of the Avengers. The way we let the team be torn apart over and over… it shouldn’t be like that,” Steve says.
Tony opens his eyes and can’t tell from the light how much time has passed, but he doesn’t feel as rested as he’d like, so he assumes not too much. The water is warm. Steve, behind him, is hot and solid and soft all at once. His skin is incredibly smooth, Tony muses while caressing Steve’s arm.
He doesn’t need Steve
“I can’t... I can’t talk about this now, Steve, I—”
“I didn’t mean what I said about Bucky,” Tony says while Steve undresses him in the bathroom, waiting for the tub to fill with hot water. Tony shivers while he lowers himself into it, feels his skin prickle with the change in temperature.
“You’re not. You’re amazing. You feel so good; you feel incredible. You’re so wet. My perfect Omega. I’m never gonna leave you. Now that I got you back… I’m never… never…”
But his nails are scraped too. He hadn’t noticed.
Tony doesn’t know exactly who the
There’s no answer.
“What, that she loved you this much? She was your
“Steve, from what I can see… Tony loves you. Truly. He can forgive you if he wants, but he’s still in a lot of pain.”
“Without coffee in it?”
Tony, that’s them, together, as a unit, as a family, as mates. The scent of their beautiful daughter, now that, too, free of that touch of
“We’ve talked about this already, but I think what Stella said made me really figure it out. What she said about her relationship with Laura, remember? They worked hard not to let their differences become incompatibilities. She said she liked having her vision challenged. I think I like it too.”
Nothing too damaging, or I won’t be able to work and fight anymore. But anything that can heal, even in a long time, is fair game.
Tony thinks it over for a few minutes.
He tosses his bag onto the backseat, closes the door with more force than is necessary. He thanks the woman, says goodbye. He looks at her walk away without really seeing her. He gets in the car and closes the door.
“You were having a nightmare. I was trying to wake you up,” Steve says, sitting up too. Then, when Tony doesn’t reply, he adds, “Please don’t shoot me?”
“Of course,” Tony says, “I talk to her in Spanish, and Italian, and Dari. Steve?”
“It was just a bad dream,” Tony murmurs, raking a hand through Steve’s hair. “Come back to bed.”
When Maria was sixteen years old, her father decided to expand his successful business to New York, one of the most influential cities in the world with regard to fashion. His family would move there with him.
And it starts back from the top. Steve is relentless, looks at the same time like he knows exactly what he’s doing, but also like he has completely lost all control.
The scan says it’s a girl.
Tony stretches out on his back, looks up at the big branches of the oak tree, the leaves moving with the soft breeze, creating unpredictable patterns of sunshine and shadows with their slow oscillations. He closes his eyes and splays a hand over his chest. He can almost feel his heart beating. Steve’s pencil stopped scratching the paper a while ago.
Nat went to sleep a little while ago, and Sam is listening to music huddled up in his bunk.
“I’m just saying, rules should be applied equally.”  Tony looked away, almost shyly.  “And I don’t particularly want to lose you, either.”  His fingers twitched in Steve’s hair, turning into a steady caress.  “And not just because I don’t want to be blamed for losing Captain America.”
“I love you,” Tony gasped, his hands clutching at Steve’s waist.  His head tilted back, his eyes closing of their own accord as Steve set a steady, swift rhythm.
Tony’s eyes met him, and he slipped one hand to the back of Steve’s head to pull him in for a kiss.  “My home is with you,” he whispered.
“God, I love it when you get Brooklyn,” Tony murmured.  “You need a word, huh?”  Steve nodded, and Tony lifted a hand to lightly stroke his cheek.  “I’m partial to partner myself, but lover works too.”
Tony slid both hands around Steve, pressing against him.  “Holy hell, I had no idea…” he trailed off, moving to kiss Steve’s neck.  “God, it’s so stupid that it matters, it shouldn’t matter, but – God, dressed in this, baby – you look like you’re mine.”
Tony was so inclined.  He waited all of two minutes – he couldn’t wait more – before bolting towards the bathroom and hoping the staff was either oblivious or tolerant.  Steve opened the bathroom door as he approached and closed it behind them, flicking the lock.
Tony moved closer, leaning against the counter near him.  “And?  What did you tell him?”
“M’not.”  Steve’s voice was muffled against the skin of Tony’s neck.  “Not sharin’ you, doll.”  He pressed forward, trapping Tony against the wall of the elevator.  “All mine, every inch.”
“Give me a minute, sweetheart,” Steve whispered, pressing a kiss just below Tony’s ear.  “Feel so good around me, need to just – just hold a minute.”  And he wanted Tony to relax – never wanted to cause his lover harm.
He yelped as Steve pulled out and rolled him onto his back, flat on the debris-strewn ground.  Tony looked up to see Steve -- in almost full uniform save for belt, gloves, and with his pants open -- looming over him.  "You are good, Tony," Steve repeated more quietly.  He slid between Tony's legs and eased his cock back into Tony's hole -- this time gently, and somehow the gentleness hurt.  "So good."
“I’m unsatisfied right now,” Tony murmured.  “You are emoting instead of fucking me, Steve.  This is unacceptable.  Make with the sexy times, Captain.”
“Because I don’t want to share you,” Tony said softly.  “That’s what I meant.”  He held a hand to Steve’s face, relaxing a little when the supersoldier leaned into the touch.  “I did say I didn’t want to talk about it, Steve – because every time I’ve had a discussion like this… it’s been… well.  Bad.”
Tony smirked up at him.  “Isn’t everything?”  Despite his threat to only watch, Tony ran an appreciative hand up and down Steve’s flexing abs.  “Look at you, all hard and lovely for me.”
“He doesn’t… enforce them?”
Obediently, Steve started to move again.  “Can you feel it?” he murmured, his eyes never leaving Tony’s.  “Can you feel how much I love you?”  He ground into Tony, feeling the first edges of his orgasm approaching.  “Every time I touch you, my body is whispering to yours.”
“Is that a threat or a promise?”  Tony squirmed again, rocking his hips against Steve’s.  “Already hard for me, aren’t you?”
In answer, Steve rolled over, careful not to dislodge Tony from the bed.  And though he supposed it wasn’t proper massage procedure, Steve couldn’t help but draw Tony into his arms.  The smaller man fit so nicely there – pressed together from knees to chin, their lips meeting in slow, sweet kisses.  Steve felt almost intoxicated – he vaguely remembered the feeling, although he hadn’t been able to get drunk since Rebirth.
“Close,” Steve gasped.  It was the endearment more than anything – he called Tony that regularly, but rarely did Tony use it.  “God, you’re so good to me.”  His hips began to thrust wildly, and Tony managed to keep his hands where they’d most torment Steve.
“Thanks.”
The blond added a third finger, moaning a little when Tony bore down on them.  “I’m ready, Jesus,”  Tony gasped.  “God, Rogers, just fuck me already.”
Steve blew out a long breath.  “No, I knew how to handle the Blitz,” he muttered to himself – but quiet enough not to disturb his partner.  “Is everyone going?”  He fumbled with his shirt buttons, not sure he liked this style… but he hadn’t picked it himself.  Everything from his socks to his tie had been selected by Pepper and Tony’s tailor… it reminded him of being in boot camp again, wearing only what he was given.  At least these fabrics were softer.
“Are you okay?”  Rhodey leaned into the screen, raking Tony over with his eyes.  “You look – damn it, are you crying?  Do I need to – I can be there in like eight hours, kid – ”
“Language!”
“Say it with your hands when you touch me,” Steve murmured.  He reached for the hem of Tony’s t-shirt.  “Say it with your lips when you kiss me.  I don’t need to hear it with your voice, doll – I can see it in your eyes, now that I know where to look.”
Once back in the penthouse, Tony shed his clothing on the way to the bathroom.  “I’m taking a bath,” he announced.  “And I’m really hoping you’ll join me.”
“What?  What’s wrong?  Tony?”  Alarmed, Steve sat up and tugged Tony into his arms.  “Babydoll, talk to me.”
Steve blinked.  “That’s supposed to be a punishment?”
“Four…?”
“Sir, yes sir.”  Steve grinned as the flippant honorific made Tony tremble.  He gently nudged Tony back onto his back and reached for the bedside table in a rare moment of preplanning – usually they were far more involved before Steve remembered the lube.  Not that Tony was any better about it.  He slicked up his fingers as Tony wriggled on his back, getting comfortable.  He knelt over Tony, bending to kiss him as his fingers slid careful back, pressing against Tony’s hole and slowly – very slowly – easing him open.
Rhodey nodded once then.  “Alright.  Yes, I see you squirming, Tony, I’ll stop threatening your boyf—”
“I don’t need – ”  It was Steve’s turn to protest, but Tony shook his head.
“So good.  God, do that again.”
“JARVIS wouldn’t let anybody in,” Tony reassured him – but he did clamber off Steve.  “Getting shy on me, soldier?”
“Would begging help?” Steve whispered, rocking his hips against Tony’s hand.  “Because I can.”
“I’m hoping you’re gonna do things to me,” Tony quipped, but it came out breathy – he was already spiraling towards mindless lust.
“They can wait.  I need to ravish this man right now.”  Tony pulled on Steve’s ridiculous Iron Man t-shirt, tugging him closer.
Tony brought his hand down in a playful slap.  Steve’s back went rigid and he moaned.  “Oh, we like that, do we?”  Tony thrust again, feeling Steve trembling.  “Still good here, Cap?”
“Love the way you touch me,” Steve murmured.  He feathered his fingers through Tony’s hair, forcing himself not to thrust against those lovely lips.  “Make me crazy, babydoll.  Never get enough of you.”  In answer, Tony took the head of Steve’s cock into his mouth and sucked, hard.  “Oh, fuck,” Steve gasped, his fingers briefly tightening in Tony’s hair.  “God, you’re so good to me.  So pretty down there…”
Steve watched him, his eyes full of things he’d never named.  He wanted… well, he wanted more.  He’d take what he could get.
“Not… not something like hook-up or boytoy or…”
Tony sat down on his knees, straddling him.  “What do you need, Steve?”
“Oh, holy fuck!”  Steve almost knocked him backwards, making Tony clutch at him and laugh.
“Thor beams at us like we’re precocious puppies… Clint’s started singing ridiculous songs whenever we enter a room.”  Tony shook his head, chuckling.
Tony wrapped his hand around Steve’s neck, pulling him close.  Steve let most of his weight rest on Tony, pinning him to the mat as they caught their breath. He found his forehead pressed against Tony’s, their eyes closed now but their breath coiling together between them.
He wasn’t aware of how his expression softened when he looked at Steve.  Didn’t see the cameras pointed in his direction when Tony slid his arm around Steve’s waist, just to be closer.  Wouldn’t realize until much later that he was smiling up at his partner, transfixed by the enthusiasm in Steve’s blue eyes – that Steve’s gaze returned to his like a homing pigeon, always with the same absolute devotion.
“Fuck!” Tony groaned, hand tightening on Steve’s neck.  “God, you’re so good at that.”
“I don’t know if any of them have been… victims.”  Tony swallowed hard.  “I don’t think Agent threatening to taze Clint counts.”
“Not yet,” Tony murmured against him.  He pressed his forehead into Steve’s pec.  “I’m sorry that you didn’t… have more fun at the thing tonight.  I promise they can be fun if you… if you can learn to look past the assholes.  But I… um.  I get it, if you don’t want to.  I won’t ask you to go.”
Steve grinned and met Tony’s lips for a kiss.  “I got more than one round in me, babydoll.  We can do both.”
But the moment he caught sight of Tony’s naked form, all bets were off.
Tony didn’t typically object to the practice… it was healthier than most of the coping methods he’d used over the years, after all… but he knew that tonight it wouldn’t be enough.  Not with the dead agent leaving behind a husband and two kids.
“You wanna roll over, and I’ll get your pecs?” Tony suggested, kissing behind Steve’s ear as he whispered the question.  Despite his normally brash natural, Tony hadn’t risen above a loud whisper since they’d started.
All rational thought bled out of Tony.  Steve wasn’t wearing any of the various shades of blue that most people dressed him in – not tonight.  This suit was in a deep red, with very subtle gold pinstriping.  “Oh.  My.”  Tony looked down at his own suit – realizing now why his tailor had insisted he wear blue tonight.  “They – we’re wearing – you’re in my colors, baby.”
Steve doesn’t reply. He’s struggling to keep the rhythm of his breath even.
He rubs his left arm until it doesn’t feel numb anymore.
“It is. But if we don’t even think there’s a chance, then what are we fighting for, right?”
“Was this before Ultron?”
“This isn’t your fault, Sarah. None of it. You hear me?”
“Hi. Another bad dream?”
Riri blinks, and sort of startles. “Of course! He’s just… he was just hiding in my room and—” Riri reaches for the door, there’s a bit of rustling, and then—
Steve shoves Tony’s pants down just enough to push into him, and he begins to fuck Tony in hard thrusts made harsher by the slow and punishing rhythm he sets to inflict them. It’s like being punched, and every time Steve pounds into him Tony feels it reach so fucking deep into his body, he feels every thrust in the back of his damn throat. It’s amazing.
“I’m not stronger than you, Steve,” Tony continues, proving the exact opposite of what he’s saying, because Steve couldn’t speak at all right now. Tony looks up to stifle his tears, sniffs again, rubs his forehead.
It’s just the way it is. It’s a probability thing, proportional to high quantity. If you have that many ideas, some of them are bound to be pretty fucking stupid.
“What?”
“Is that why you’re always tired and short of breath? The real reason?”
“I didn’t know. But it’s okay, I know now,” Tony says, circling Steve’s shoulders with his arms. “Please don’t hurt yourself. Please,” Tony whispers, and strokes Steve’s back.
Tony shrugs, and gives Steve what he sincerely hopes is an encouraging smile. “That’s not your fault, Steve. Don’t worry. These things happen, right?”
But he—
The kitchen is on the right, spacious and bright, and the smell of apples coming from the oven makes Steve’s mouth water. On the opposite side of the corridor, past a big arch, there’s a living room—it looks cozy and lived-in, and Tony spares a few moments to pet the three cats sleeping on the couch. “My little girls,” Stella says fondly while one of them walks over to Steve and brushes her body against his legs. He bends down to caress her head, and she lifts her paw to touch Steve’s hand, as if to welcome him in her home. He looks at Tony, and finds him nuzzling the neck of the black cat. She purrs at him.
They fall asleep like that.
“I’m sure she’d appreciate that.”
“How so?”
But Steve says, “Sure?” with a strained voice and that’s when Tony knows that he could play this trick a thousand times, he could take hope away from Steve and then give it back a thousand times, and Steve would never force him into anything.
His dick hurts so much. His skin is on fire; he wants to peel it off his bones. He’s in so much pain, and it’s only the beginning of the rut.
“It’s from the last verse of Dante’s
When Tony wakes up on Saturday morning, the sun is barely up, and he’s not entirely sure that he can feel his legs. He’s lying on his stomach with a giant arm slumped across his shoulders, a tuft of blond hair brushing at his cheek, the covers soft and warm against his back.
“We were reckless.”
“Don’t play dumb. All this thing with the stars and the sun and you were cold before and now you are not and you drew the reactor as a sun and the song—”
It’s been years since they’ve been this close. Since they’ve touched this much.
, that Tony is okay.
Bullshit, Steve thinks.
“I’d like that. If you feel like it, that is.”
Tony’s hands on him. On Steve’s skin. On his cheeks.
“Honestly, see? This is what I have to put up with. He’s no fun.”
“I know.”
“Forgive yourself, Steve.”
It worries Steve, to see him like this. Still as a statue, numb. It’s the way Tony copes with the worst things, when everything else fails him. He becomes a pillar of salt, unreacheable, rage thundering furious inside him and inside him only.
“Yeah. And then Lagos happened, and then all the rest, and I still hadn’t told you, and Zemo showed you the tape, and it was… it was over.”
“They brought me food five times. Two days, two days and a half? Did they give you any food?”
“You said he was distant.”
“Why would you even say that?”
“You’ve been up long?”
The alarm Steve set on his phone chimes. Two hours. He speeds up his pace.
Steve looks at him, and his eyes wander from Tony’s face and down to his chest again, hesitate over the arc reactor and the scar, dip as low as Tony’s stomach; then reality seems to slam back into Steve, and he jerks his gaze away and up, fixing it back to Tony’s face, although nowhere near his eyes.
But Tony, for some unknown reason—maybe he’s still sleepy, maybe it’s the blanket covering Steve, maybe it’s the fact that he’s drowning in the blue of Steve’s eyes, maybe it’s whatever the fuck else—miscalculates their bodies’ reciprocal positions, and his hand lands more on Steve’s lower belly than his chest, or even his stomach.
He barely remembers how he got back home that night. He climbed the stairs back to their room and everything was there, ready for Tony to use, like always, like normal. Tony’s things didn’t know that Tony was gone, never to be back again.
“I wanted to say,” Steve starts, interrupting Tony. He swallows, scratches his forehead. He pushes his hair back. “I wanted to...”
. It’s not the original copy from his childhood; it was destroyed in one of the many attacks to Avengers Mansion. But he bought another. It’s old and beautiful, and he paid a lot of money for it. It has a red leather cover, and the title written in gold letters. Just the way you’d imagine a book about knights would look.
Fuck.
In Tony’s bed. That was now their bed.
Steve sits up. “Sharon kissed me.”
The image he sees then, Tony hopes it’ll be the last thing crossing his mind before he dies.
“Let’s get some sleep now, alright? We’ll talk later.”
“And you know how they met? She didn’t tell me.”
“We’re gonna stay here for a few days,” Tony says. “We can visit a couple of places, if you want.”
“—I tell you this kind of shit. Yes.”
And wins.
“Well, I haven’t.”
He’s naked, sitting on the shower floor, away from the spray of the water. The bottle of Steve’s shower gel has been knocked over, and now it’s on the floor too, next to Tony’s thigh. There’s also Tony’s soap there, his black soap bar with
“Sharon, listen—”
“Are you alright?” Tony asks again, louder, and then closes his eyes and swallows, chastising himself.
Steve has spent most of the day in his room, listening to the sound of the water hitting the windows, reading, catching up on work, getting so bored that he doesn’t even want to head down to the gym and let out some energy because he feels like he has no energy at all. He’s tired from doing basically nothing the whole day. He makes himself a sandwich and eats it while going through his sketchbook.
