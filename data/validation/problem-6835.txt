“You need a shave,” Tony retorted and rubbed his cheek against Steve’s stubble. Tony secretly liked his stubble though. Between the stubble, cigarettes, and Steve’s enjoyment of 60’s music he’d been educating him on it gave Tony bad ideas about rolling around in the mud naked with him at Woodstock. “Mmm,” he moaned into Steve’s chest at the mere thought. “You’re going to go shower until you smell like my alpha again.”
“A new adventure?” Tony mulled it over. It was getting lonely in his lab when Steve went to shield and all he had was his bots and Jarvis to keep him company. Maybe, the whole pregnancy thing did pop into his head a lot while he was down there and there was nothing stopping him from going down a self-loathing train, but, “What do you have in mind?”
“Sure thing,” Steve said as he grabbed a pot to put the water on to boil.  The rest would have to wait until Tony got out of the shower. “Well, I don’t know Tony’s recipe, but while we wait, how about a snack?”
“Oooh, tell me more.” It was too funny to see Tony acting like this when typically he was never shy, that Steve simply couldn’t help himself.
The moment Steve and Tony woke up Peter, he instantly attacked Steve and clung to him unable to say anything other than, “alpha,” and, “mine.”
“Woah,” Steve said catching Tony. “I can change my clothes first, or shower or something... I know you don’t like the smell.”
Peter wasted no time in asking, “what’s going on? Can I help?” He was already buzzing with excitement.
“Hiya, May, yeah it’s Steve.” A pause. “Yeah no, Peter will be staying here. He’s got his nest all set up, and he’s nice and comfortable.” Another pause. Dear God, Tony thought, he has that woman in the palm of his hand. “No no, Peter’s in no state to talk right now. Trust me he’d never forgive Tony and me if we went in there right now with him in that state,” he chuckled. He has the audacity to laugh. “No, that’ll be no problem. He’ll get everything worked out with the school tomorrow. Tony’s good like that,” Steve said and gave Tony a wink. Tony couldn’t understand the sheer gull of his man all the while he pretended that he was nothing more than the most perfect, innocent face America saw him as. “Yeah, now you take care, May, and don’t you worry Tony and I will take good real good care of Pete.” And just like that, he hung up like it was the easiest thing that ever happened.
“Of course.” And with that, they were already back on the jet headed back for Shield. Natasha played her classical music, Clint turned off his hearing aids, and Steve studied to dirt in the small tube. It looked, in all ways, like normal dirt which was exactly what made him feel uneasy. In the time that he spent since waking up in the future, he came to realize that nothing was normal. Some things only pretend to be for the sake of image. While he knew in most cases it was impossible, he liked to know what he was getting into upfront.
Steve, the poor thing, looked very uncomfortable from having a very under-age omega attached to him with no sign of leaving. To add to his horror, Peter began grinding on the alpha. Steve who had been trying to at least hold the boy steady raised in hands in surrender and yelped. Peter, however, was using his super strength and stick and was going nowhere.
Knowing he’s the only one I don’t mind handing me thing is giving him too much satisfaction, Tony thought.
“How could I not when you smell so good?” he teased and ran his hands through Tony’s hair who was hiding his face in Steve’s chest.
“Oh boy, we better get started on dinner then. Can’t have any spider-kids going hungry on my watch,” Steve chuckled and then added, “Tony would kill me.”
Natasha turned around to glare at her partner, but Steve could see a small smile sneaking up around the corners of her lips. “I’ll think about it.”
With Clint still acting as a backpack behind Natasha, she began to go through the exact location and time and the owner of the house. He was some nuclear scientist that, according to the info they could gather so far, retired early after breaking things off with his potential mate before they could officially bond.
“Uh, yeah maybe,” he said, giving it some thought. Maybe Bucky could come to dinner tonight, but Peter was coming... Tony was very protective of him, treating and protecting him like his own baby.
Clint must have turned his hearing aids back on because he said, “have fun nailing that a- OW!” Natasha elbowed him in the ribs to shut him up. Steve couldn’t help but laugh.
“I think I can get behind that,” Steve chuckled and kissed the head of soft brown hair beneath him. “You need a haircut,” he noticed.
Natasha knew how important Peter was to Tony, and Steve also knew Natasha was worried about Tony since their conversation. Everyone knew Peter was good for Tony and vise versa, and no one was going to encourage them to spend less time together. “Fine,” she said, “but soon, Tony, we want to figure out what we’re dealing with.”
“Right,” Steve said, sounding only slightly disappointed while letting go of Tony and going inside, leaving Tony alone looking over the city. He pulled his phone from his pocket and dialed up May.
Shield had a strange effect on Steve always. Something about the cubicles where people worked away like drones gave him an uneasy feeling. He knew that the employees were handling more sensitive information than most government workers would ever see in their entire lives, and yet the bored looks and mundane expressions as they typed away was... unsettling. He felt like he was watching people deteriorate in front of him. It wouldn’t surprise him at all if suddenly someone dropped dead in front of him, but instead of a huge commotion, everyone would keep working while a team specifically assigned for such a problem would appear to collect the body and replace it with a new one, like a faulty piece of machinery.
“No, it’s not that, and it’s nothing that you need to worry about because there’s nothing you can do.” He took her hand. “I promise he’s okay. I’ll make sure he’s okay.”
“Typically, yes, but alien frequencies matching those after the attack on New York were found radiating from the cite. Fury wants us to look into it.”
“It’s nothing you guys would understand.” He hadn’t meant to sound so cliche, but it was true. They weren’t mated, and certainly, weren’t currently trying to get pregnant, nor worried about a mate who was taking the fact that he wasn’t pregnant as a personal failure.
She thinks I’m lying. “May, please be reasonable,” Tony begged for the second time in their short conversation. “He’s in no state to talk right now.”
“Oh my God, yes, supplies,” Tony grunted while attempting to readjust the kid who wasn’t liking being held bridal style.
“Uh, no...” Peter looked at little bashful. “I didn’t eat any lunch because we always have really good food here and so I was saving room-“ Peter was cut off by growling in his stomach.
“Okay, great,” Tony paused because he knew the conversation had come to a close, but Steve could tell he didn’t want to say goodbye, bringing a warm feeling to his chest that made it even harder to say goodbye.
Dinner went smoothly, besides both Peter and Steve eating enough food for four people each, according to Tony, but Steve could see the smile in his eyes as he poked at his salad – he hated salad but made himself eat it anyways.
“Pick something good,” Tony suggested helpfully and moving to the living room to start moving around pillows blankets for what he called “ultimate comfort” and everyone else in the world just called a nest. This happened anytime Tony had to be sitting for a long period of time. What was surprising was that Peter went to help arrange the pillows and fussed when one wasn’t how he wanted it. Steve did his usual job of keeping out of his omega’s way until he was summoned for cuddle duty, which he always accepted happily. Finally, the two settled after Peter asked for a different blanket twice because first was too scratchy and the second was too small, but once he was wrapped in a large fuzzy blanket from head to toe with Tony beside him, he was ready. Tony also was ready and signaled Steve over to sit beside him before he tucked him and Steve into the blanket. “Alright, Petey, what are we watching?”
He was woken up suddenly by a familiar smell. Heat. I thought Tony wasn’t due for another month, he thought, must have come early. “Tony, baby,” he whispered. He ran his fingers through Tony’s waves. They were lucky that Tony didn’t immediately need any kind of relief that wouldn’t be emotionally scarring in front of Peter. Typically, for the first couple hours he just wanted attention and to be touched. “Tony, your heat is starting. Gotta wake up. I’m gonna bring you to our room and take Peter to his.” Tony just whined and nestled deeper into Steve’s chest. “C’mon, babe, I promise I’ll take care of you, but you gotta wake up.”
“Huh?” Steve said, before realizing, “Oh Bucky! He’s okay really, but he’s adjusting. Still wants to be alone most of the time.” When they’d found his best friend, Steve had been overjoyed. To think, he had everything that really mattered to him in this new world, some new like Tony and the avengers, but the one person he missed the most, coming back from the dead seemed too good to be true. Really, it was. Bucky’s memory was getting better, but with that came the guilt and remorse. Tony was trying really hard to be hospitable, giving Bucky his own floor in the tower, offering to fix his metal arm – which Bucky declined – and offering to set him up with a therapist – which Bucky, rudely, declined. He tried to explain to Tony that it was just Bucky adjusting, but it was too late. His mate’s feelings were hurt and his generosity insulted, making Bucky and Tony’s relationship tense at best. It didn’t help that Steve also had left right after they mated because Shield had finally tracked down his best friend’s location for real that time. He knew it was wrong to leave when newly mated, but when he asked, Tony had said it was okay. Steve insisted that they would take their honeymoon once Bucky was back, and was comfortable being left in the tower alone for a longer span of time and that seemed to cheer Tony’s spirits slightly before Steve left for two weeks. It was six months after that and they still hadn’t taken a real honeymoon yet. Damn, I should get on that. I’m being a bad mate.
Tony was caught off guard for a moment at Natasha showing worry openly before he replied, “I always do. Bye, Nat, I’ll let you know the moment I’m done.”
“We’re taking the quinjet. It won’t take long,” Clint replied. Steve snorted. It seemed a little bit much to take a private jet for just a couple miles, but, “you’ll be home to your mate in plenty of time,” Clint coaxed.
Hi, friends, I realized that it had been a minute and so this was going to be longer but I wanted to get some content out there. I hope you don’t mind waiting too much, though, because I try really hard to proof read and put out content that’s worth the read.
Steve hurriedly stepped out of the room, already pulling out his phone to dial Tony’s number. He found the first private room that he could and pushed his way in as the phone rang. Fortunately, Tony picked up on the third ring.
Steve reached over to where we had set two cups of coffee in their eccentric mugs. It had become a new hobby of Tony’s to grow his collection of ever growing mugs – something which had become much worse since Peter entered his life and found out his mentor could be instantly cheered up with a silly mug, or brought to tears by one that read “Word’s Best Dad” given to him on Father’s Day. Steve thought it was an adorable quirk and thoroughly enjoyed selecting mugs each morning. Today he’d chosen an MIT mug, which Tony assumed was his based on the small amount of cream, and a Star Wars one, given to him by Peter that featured Yoda making some pun of Christmas which had Steve’s black coffee in it. They did this every morning. Coffee in bed and talking about their day, spending some quality time together before having to actually start the day.
Steve hung up and sat for a moment. He hated seeing Tony like this. The past two months since they started trying had been harder on him than Steve – or really anyone – had anticipated. At first, he hadn’t really even been sure if Tony was fully on board with the idea of a child. After the way he’d been treated in his own childhood, he expected more hesitancy from his mate – expecting at the very least a longer conversation. Steve had been working the courage to bring it up the topic for weeks, but surprisingly, Tony was in support of it, wanting to separate himself from his father – break the cycle. Tony, being Tony though, started viewing getting pregnant as another project which he couldn’t rest until he saw it to completion.
“You are the most capable man and omega I’ve ever known,” Steve said sincerely. His hands were back on Tony, soft and reassuring. “You can do this. Peter is going to be looking up to you even more now, and it will mean a lot to him if you help him settle in.”
Peter went on for a while about how the fish sticks they served had apparently gone bad a long time ago, but the cafeteria still served them, causing a vomit chain reaction throughout the school.
seeing the ones with missing limbs and the ones who used way too foul language around his little kid ears, describing exactly what the phrase war is hell really meant. To Tony, that’s what being a soldier always meant to him, broken by a world that people who were far too good for all that dirty fighting told them it was their job to fix. Maybe that’s why he and Steve worked out because he never saw him as a hero but as a human.
The floor was empty when he got home which wasn’t really a surprise as Steve had guessed Tony would still be in his lab since it was still only just before three o’clock, so Steve headed for Tony’s lab where his mate could usually be found. Steve knew he could just ask Jarvis where Tony was and didn’t have to go looking, but for some reason, Steve liked the feeling of just knowing where Tony would be without even asking. It made him feel closer to Tony without really even having to do anything.
“Huh,” Tony said in response, mulling it over. He wanted to keep Steve happy, but he really did like just getting held and being the center of Steve’s attention for a while before he got extra needy. It made him feel safe and cared for which only made what came next even better. His brain was reeling when he had a thought, “that’s fine as long as your rut is all about you.”
“You’re getting stir crazy, and honestly, you’re just so focused on trying to get pregnant. Don’t get me wrong I want a baby, and I’m glad that we are trying... It’s just, seeing you get worked up like this... doesn’t feel right.”
“I don’t know. Just something to think about for right now. I gotta go help Natasha and Clint with some stuff at Shield,” Steve said and then placed a kiss on Tony’s forehead. “I love you, and I’ll see you tonight.”
Tony knows Steve will come over after he’s done teaching kids how to draw and will give him as many kisses as he wants and then a little bit more. He will cook because Tony really cannot but helps by providing any ingredient Steve needs for his recipes, no matter how obscure. They will sit in Tony’s little kitchen and chat and eat and kiss a little bit more. And when Steve gets up to go home, his overgrown duck with itsy-bitsy razor teeth will follow him back home loyally.
The man in question squints his eyes and furrows his brows, “Eat your food, Rogers,” he huffs and folds his arms, “We’ll see about manners.”
Steve rubs his temples, he will not get into a verbal argument with a game character, he just refuses to, “Have you ever heard of Nexus Mods? Alpha testing? Writing on forums so that things will get patched?”
It had taken years to find their footing, with Tony taking over the company and Steve trying to let go of past hurts and them learning to be together after the initial high of their relationship mellowed. It had been good, back then, to just be the two of them as Tony Stark the genius and the C.E.O. of Stark Industries and his elusive boyfriend.
“No, listen,” Tony takes Steve’s hand in his, “ when I had said that, I had meant- Well, see how we’re now. We could be going out? Eating at the most expensive restaurant in the world. We could be having brunch in Paris. But you don’t want that. If you did, it’d give it to you. But you don’t. And frankly, I don’t either. I like having homemade, mediocre frittata muffins with you. I like that we make them together. When I had said low-key, that was what I was getting at.”
Tony looked at him questioningly, but the plan was already formed in his mind, from the moment Stone started walking up to him, all swagger and confidence. He was close enough now.
Steve turns it around in his head. Maybe Iron Man is a much higher level employee, or maybe he is just… Too good at his job. Or maybe he just doesn’t care.
Steve had been helping an old man into the hospital who has asked for directions. Family member of a patient formerly lost in ER had stormed the place with an assault rifle. It hadn’t even made it to the news.
And now he was trying to send Tony away. Tony had been realizing he was getting more and more separated from SI every passing year but he hadn’t cared then.
Steve took him to bed, his arms around Tony, never once letting him go from his embrace. He didn’t seem so bashful, now that they were kissing. Once on the bed, he pushed his hands under Tony’s clothes, mapping his back as his lips travelled on his face, his neck. He moved Tony wherever he wanted, Steve’s hands pulling his hips closer, flush into his groin like Tony weighed no more than the pillows he was laying on.
Tony’s eyes blurred with tears, from the vice grip on his wrist or from the clear cut dismissal, he wasn’t sure.
The idea comes from Iron Man who wants to include more world elements into his boss arena but also, he tells Steve in the privacy of the boss arena chat, that there is a new boss they are working on that will come with the season pass and that one will have three or four phases simulating in-game areas.
It only hit him once he let the door close after him, the bang echoing in the empty entryway, that the car hadn’t been there, that the mansion was too quiet for any of Obie’s show-off diners. Tony pressed his back against the door, unmoving.
Tony had pressed his face against his bare chest, so close that the water couldn’t get in. It there was ever any doubt in his mind, all had been erased at that moment. He would give anything, do anything to stay here. For Steve to keep him there, by his side.
Limb by limb, feeling came back to his body. His eyes adjusted to the darkness. Drowsiness left him like fog dissipating.
He wanted to catalogue it all in his mind, what made Steve twitch, what made him sigh, how he liked to be played with until he shook and came above Tony. And he came, he came oh so much. Just the feel of the copious amount of come on his hand was enough to tip Tony over.
Tony wears a shirt and then realizes what he’s doing and takes it off. He’s not wearing a button up shirt to walk fifteen minutes,get his tools and come back. That’s a little too much. A little.
He heaved soundlessly but there was nothing else to puke in his stomach. Somewhere in his peripheral vision, Ty tried to break free first, then he tried to call for help, then choked in that uncontrollable way people did in the movies. The periodic thump, the crunch of the hits got wet, squelching.
Steve with his straw blond hair translucent at the tips under pale sunlight, with his clenched jaw and  icy blue eyes shadowed under his creased brows.
Delirious with the possibility of a modicum of normalcy, Steve brought the hammer down fast and sure.
Suddenly a hexagonal beam skips from the rock formation that makes up the arena and finds Steve’s character exactly where he’s been hiding. All Steve can do is just, look at the screen in absolute horror. And he’s surprised to realize that it’s not because he lost. No. It’s because he just… Wanted to talk to Iron Man a bit, maybe poke him a little more about how he knew about DeviantArt.
Steve’s midnight snack mission had now turned into a “be unseen but also get a little glimpse of what’s going on” mission. He felt like a kid, giddy, trying to hide behind the wall.
“I-” the changeling cleaned his throat, “I’m sorry for being late. I felt you coming this way and I hopped as quick as I could but- Uh- I’m a little small and I get tired a lot, so-”
He turns it around in his head and comes to two possible conclusions: Either Iron Man’s AI has precoded but unrevealed attacks and one of them just happened to fit what he asked for; or there is someone who handles real time upgrades to the Iron Man because he doesn’t want to believe there is someone who can actually play that well that controls Iron Man.
The goose doesn’t turn around. Naturally, since geese would never admit to understanding something as pathetic as spoken language.
Tony looked up and studied Steve’s face as Steve maneuvered them through the crowd. All kinds of good looking people threw themselves on Tony, from models to actors to Instagram influencers but no one, not a single one of them looked as beautiful as Steve was to him.
If there was some world-ending emergency, then a phone call would suffice, but nevertheless they always made it to dinner. There had been the one occasion where Tony had missed dinner because he’d fallen asleep, and when Steve had found him, he’d practically swooned over him, but bygones are bygones.
Steve takes the Runes, “I won’t argue with you since you’re clearly delusional about the sheer number of more talented people out there but okay, still, how do you know what the art team is looking for?”
Steve clears his throat awkwardly and averts his eyes to the floor. “Tony isn’t very fond of any of us right now, not even Natasha or Bruce. He doesn’t trust anyone anymore and basically said that he wants us all to leave him alone.”
“You’re here for Harold Hogan?” asks the doctor. Pepper and Tony nod. “Mr. Hogan is currently stable, though he lost a lot of blood. A large shard of glass is what caused the internal bleeding, as it punctured a rather large hole in his left lung, but all in all the surgery was a success. Mr. Hogan will remain in the Critical Care Unit for a few days until we are certain that he is stable enough to be moved.”
I will try to update this fic as soon as I can. I'm slowly making progress and coming back around to it, even if I am only writing a couple of sentences every few days. Progress is progress, right?
“He, uh, he asked JARVIS to tell him whenever I was having a bad dream and-” Clint pauses as he smiles fondly at the memory. “- he would come in with two cups of hot chocolate and keep talking until I fell asleep. He even learned sign language just so I wouldn’t have to go to the effort of having to put my hearing aid back in.”
Tony nods again. Natasha sighs and plants a gentle kiss to his cheek before she brushes past him to reach the trunk of the SUV. As she sticks her head inside to remove Rhodey’s wheelchair and unfold it, Tony makes a rash decision and bolts.
“Sir,” says FRIDAY once more. She sounds as sympathetic as an AI with the voice of a teenage girl can sound, and Tony isn’t sure whether to be thankful for that or not. “Would you like to visit your floor before-?”
“Of course I don’t want my business to fail, Pepper, but did you hear what he said to me?! There’s no way that I was going to let that slide, let alone go into business with him. You were sick of him, too, admit it! If you ask me, it was a close call. He sounded just like -” Tony stops abruptly, unable to form the words
“As if I don’t know that,” Tony scoffs. “But we’re here to talk about Spymaster, and since you’ve all made your opinions abundantly clear I only have one thing left to say; don’t get in my way. You can all leave now.”
Tony swallows thickly and turns around to look his friend in the eyes, smiling at him sadly. Bruce observes the way Tony idly massages a spot above the arc reactor with the heel of his sweaty palm and the way his other hand is stuffed deep inside the pocket of his faded but no doubt expensive jeans.
I feel very 'meh' about this first chaper, but I decided to post it anyway in the hopes of motivating myself into writing more often. I hope this angst is enjoyable, as there is plenty more to come.
“I can assure you, Captain Rogers,” FRIDAY interjects firmly. “You were not the first choice. Mr. Stark would much rather be in your position, but he is unable to reschedule his meetings and Ms. Potts does not take kindly to hired help. It would be much less catastrophic for Mr. Stark if you were to act as their bodyguard for the day.”
“You know, I sometimes find myself missing JARVIS,” he says gently, making his presence known. Tony barely flinches, just minimises his work and glances over his shoulder at the doctor. Bruce walks further into the room with a melancholic smile. “I know we have FRIDAY, but it’s just not the same.”
Rhodey stares at him long enough for Tony to begin feeling uncomfortable. “Okay, Tones, I believe you. I’m with you in this, 100%, but what are you going to do?”
taken me almost seven months to realise that I was so focused on pleasing others that I forgot I have to please myself, too. I feel like that works as a pretty okay explanation, but if you're not satisfied with it then there's not much else I can tell you other than this:
“Technicalities,” scoffs Tony, waving a hand around flippantly. He chews on the inside of his lip for a moment in thought. “Tell Nat and Bruce that I’m awake, and that they’re video chatting with me in five minutes whether they like it or not.”
Tony and Bucky glare at each other unwaveringly. The entire room is tense and the others are watching with bated breath to see how things turn out. Bucky’s chest is heaving up and down and Tony’s hands are shaking, but it’s clear that neither man is going to be backing down any time soon.
“You beautifully gifted woman,” he says around a mouthful of Pepper’s delicious baking. Happy nods eagerly in agreement.
He sits in the car for another moment, staring at the steering wheel. “Will you tell Rhodey next time you see him? And tell him to call me whenever he’s released from the hospital, too. Oh, and make sure he doesn’t try and kill He Who Must Not Be Named for some bullshit reason like ‘driving me away’ in the meantime.”
A large holographic screen is projected from the watch and the requested footage begins rolling. The video begins from the moment Bruce steps foot inside the workshop and the pained expression on everyone’s faces only grow worse as the footage continues playing. Bruce realises that this could be considered cruel, playing footage of Tony confessing his suicidal thoughts to people who are supposed to be Tony’s closest friends, teammates, and lover, but then he figures that they need to see it. It’s time they stop undermining how serious Tony’s issues are, even if the man himself plays them off.
I couldn't resist including the line: "Time spent on you is never a waste, Tony." because I love it and I need a bit of love to lighten the angst.
Tony freezes, looking as if he’s about to collapse, and stares at Bruce in something akin to childish confusion - as if he cannot understand why Bruce would say such a thing. Eventually, he swallows and says, “Thanks, Brucie Bear.”
“Shit,” mutters Tony. He chews on his lower lip and walks towards the elevator. Who can he trust to keep Pepper and Happy safe? Rhodey is obviously out of the question considering his temporary paralysis and the fact that he would be unable to use the War Machine armour if a situation called for it. The elevator doors open and remove Tony from his thoughts.
The house is already stacked full with food and drink and clothes and other niceties. Tony wastes no time in dragging himself up the stairs and into his master bedroom, still in his pyjamas and shoes as he curls up into a ball on top of the sheets. His duffel bag lay forgotten on the floor next to the bed and beneath everything else in the bag lay Tony’s buzzing phone with its screen lit up to display Steve’s Caller ID. Tony ignores the muffled buzzing and drifts off to sleep, too tired from the flight to even think about getting up to turn the device off.
“FRIDAY,” he says after clearing his throat, glancing at the camera situated in the corner of the elevator. “Call the airport and tell them to get the jet ready. Oh, and let’s leave a message for the team, yeah? You know how they worry.”
“My art is one of the only things that have survived all these years with me. When I sit down in front of a canvas or with a sketchpad, it’s like I’m right back where it all started; Brooklyn in the ’40s with Bucky saving me from getting my ass kicked, helping my Ma with the groceries, goofing off with the Howlies. Those memories are special, private. They’re
With a sigh, Tony waves around his half-eaten doughnut in a lazy gesture and nods. “If you must,” he acquiesces.
Steve takes another step towards them, arm outstretched in a cautious gesture. Tony thinks he catches a tear on his cheek, but he isn’t so sure because of the way his vision goes blurry when he’s slammed into the wall again.
Pepper begins falling asleep after another half hour, and Tony gives her his old grey MIT sweatshirt so that she can keep warm and wear something that isn’t torn and scorched. Tony retraces his steps to the reception area and heads outside to get some fresh air. He sits himself down on one of the wooden benches in front of the hospital and, ignoring the night chill, decides to call Rhodey on his recharged phone.
“FRIDAY let me in,” he says, which doesn’t answer Tony’s question and he knows it. “Apparently, you’re a danger to your own damn health and I was already on damage control for Steve, so I figured I should come check out what’s up.”
“And what if I say the situation calls for it but you disagree? It’s just going to turn out how it did in Siberia and I don’t fancy a repeat of that.”
of your hands being a drunken, reckless idiot and then, while high on pain medication, you lock yourself in the workshop for four days and upon your reappearance, you have the
clear, but he can’t help it. Steve never likes to consider himself a selfish man but, for Tony’s love, he think that he’s definitely the most selfish of them all. Steve thinks back to their failed plan from this morning and grunts softly. No one felt like eating after Tony left. It’s obvious that the threat to kick them out was as genuine as they come, and it rattled the team more than any one of them would care to admit. Steve, having had enough tense silences to last a lifetime, practically ran out of the kitchen after ten minutes of uncomfortable hovering. He’s just surprised that Bucky hasn’t come after him yet, but also kind of grateful.
Everyone remains silent and Tony takes that as a sign that the conversation is over. He turns around without another word and exits the floor, feeling strangely giddy and proud of himself for the first time in months. He returns to his workshop in a much better mood than he was in when he left it minutes before.
He looks over his shoulder and catches Steve’s eye for one very long and very painful moment before Tony has to look away. He doesn’t spare Bucky a glance and refocuses on Sam, plastering on an entirely fake smile as he says, “C’mon, keep going.”
Tony walks down the corridors alongside Rhodey, ignoring the pang of guilt in his chest every time he catches sight of his best friend in the wheelchair.
“Morning, sunshine,” she drawls. Tony flips her off and rolls out of bed with a groan. Natasha takes a step back just as Tony flops onto the ground, and raises an unimpressed eyebrow at him.
Natasha takes a long enough pause that everyone begins to think that she has finished her rant, but after another drawn out moment she speaks up again, eyes still locked with Steve’s.
Tony whimpers again at the sound of an annoyed Bruce, which can lead to an angry Bruce, which can lead to his large green alter ego taking over and destroying Tony’s tower with him in it and he has to screw his eyes shut and attempt to concentrate on his breathing because that train of thought is downright
A moment of silence passes. The first person to move just so happens to be Pepper, and she engulfs Tony in a large bear hug. Tony stills for a moment, positive that his surprise is evident on his face, and then snakes his arms around her waist to return the hug. It’s the first proper hug that they have shared since before their break up. Tony doesn’t count the one in the hospital as they waited to hear news about Happy because Pepper had been crying and in desperate need of some comfort. This time is different.
Tony slowly raises his puffy face from where it’s pressed into the pillow and lifts a quizzical eyebrow at the nearest camera in the corner.
. Tony, who is always so strong and charismatic and beautiful, is now exhausted and fragile and damaged. He hates himself for not noticing it sooner. It had not escaped his attention that Tony always manages to escape a room as soon as Steve enters it, or that he prefers to sleep on the tattered couch in his workshop rather than in their bed with Steve's arms around him, or that Tony has taken to finding solace in alcohol once more. Never in his life did Steve Rogers think that he could wound someone so deeply, make them fear him so terribly, that they would destroy themselves just to escape him and the pain and suffering that looms over him like a gloomy rain cloud.
Tony grins and woops with joy. As well as his clothes, his bandages and casts have also mysteriously vanished, and so Tony flexes his fingers experimentally. He laughs incredulously. “It works!”
Tony grimaces and his elation at his new-and-improved body and health vanishes almost instantly. Pepper will
Tony grunts and attempts to straighten his fingers of his right hand out again, which results in him barely keeping in a yell of agony. Wow, he really needs to brush up on his hand-to-hand combat... and maybe use a softer punching bag next time.
Steve sighs and runs a hand over his face. “It’s all we’ve got to go on,” he offers with a helpless shrug of his shoulders. His eyes suddenly turn distant and sad, and Natasha has a feeling that Steve isn’t finished explaining himself yet. “And Tony, he- he seemed so
“We have to try,” says Natasha, speaking up at last. Her tone is firm and leaves no room for argument. “What type of people - what type of
“We have not found anything of the like, boss. Mr. Wilson did not catch anyone suspicious around the Tower, and neither did any of the CCTV cameras around Manhattan. It appears that Spymaster is something of a ghost.”
Tony pats Dum-E on the claw as the bot wheels past him to circle around Steve in a flurry of excited beeps and whirring sounds. As Steve crouches down to reach Dum-E’s level, he sees Tony watching them with different emotions rolling across his face like a rough tide: fond, then sad, then hurt, and then guarded until Tony’s face eventually evens out and his expression is once again blank and void of emotion. Steve pretends that he doesn’t notice.
“Yeah, well,” says Tony through a small smile. He’s missed bantering like this with Pepper. Most of their conversations revolve around the company now that they’re broken up, and Tony knows that she’s missed this, too.
Tony inhales slowly again, thinking that it could be his last chance to ever do it again, and then sinks the needle into the nape of his neck and presses down on the tip of the syringe. As soon as the Extremis serum is injected into his bloodstream, Tony’s vision goes blurry and his body begins burning up. He can faintly hear Dum-E’s worried beeping and the whirring of his wheels, but no words of reassurance leave his mouth and Tony slips into unconsciousness.
Tony’s workshop is on constant lockdown now, and the only time that he leaves its sanctity is to visit Happy in the hospital, usually with Pepper. He fully invests himself in discovering the whereabouts of Spymaster and discovers some interesting things along the way, for example: the last Spymaster, Nathan Lemon, was arrested and severely beaten in jail until he eventually died in Intensive Care. It leaves Tony with absolutely no idea of the identity of the new Spymaster, and there seems to be nothing one the face of the earth that he can dig up that will help his search.
“Tony, play nice,” warns Natasha from where she is leaning against a table at the far side of the lab next to Bruce. Tony salutes her mockingly.
Tony knows it’s a fair statement but he cannot help the way his body flinches in barely concealed rage at the mention of his past coping mechanisms. “You’ll get over it.”
“Is it ba-” He stops when Tony jumps practically out of his skin and presses his back against the wall, staring at Steve with wide eyes and making himself look ten times smaller than he already is. Steve internally curses himself for being careless and not thinking that
“What are you saying, exactly?” asks Bucky from where he’s leaning against one of the counters in the kitchen. Bruce notes that his near-permanent scowl has taken on a much darker look, or else it’s Bucky’s dark hair hanging over his face that gives off the effect. Either way, it makes Bucky look much more pissed off than usual.
“Steve,” he concludes, to which Tony nods. Barnes watching him for a moment through the computer screen and Tony stares back, unwilling to shy away from the ex-assassin’s piercing gaze. “I ain’t gonna tell him ‘bout this, just so ya know. Figured it ain’t my place.”
“Always,” she says, and then she pauses again. Tony looks in the mirror and sees the pilot boarding the jet. “I know you hate when I go all mother-hen on you, Tony, but listen to me for a second, okay? For as long as I’ve known you, you’ve always been going at 100 miles per hour; trying to please everyone, trying to please your father despite everything. I just want to tell you that I’m happy you’re finally going at your own pace, and doing things for yourself rather than for everyone else. If anyone deserves a break, it’s you.”
Tony ignores him in favour of staring at the newspaper headline of his parents’ death - caused by the man standing in the same room as him, talking to him as if their deaths meant nothing. Tony feels the hatred that he usually stifles stir deep inside of him and he glares at the other man vehemently.
The bot wheels over holding an unopened plastic bag with a large syringe in it. Tony takes the bag from its claw and the bot beeps happily once Tony smiles at it gratefully. After a few minutes of struggling, Tony finally manages to open the bag and he pulls out the syringe with a proud smile. Dum-E beeps again, but this time it sounds more worried.
“Indeed, sir. I should inform you that your body was in an unconscious state for four days, and on the second day Colonel Rhodes informed Miss Potts that you had initiated another lockdown. Her response was not pleasant.”
“No shit,” says Tony with a roll of his eyes. “I thought as much, unless it’s normal for a guy to call me seventeen times and text me ten times. What can I possibly do about it? I’m not coming back any time soon, and I don’t owe him an explanation.”
Pepper opens her mouth to object but Tony puts the plates on the table and runs into the adjoining hallway before she can protest. He passes the closed doors of the bathroom and the master bedroom but stops short in front of a framed photograph. Tony doesn’t think he’s ever seen Pepper as relaxed and joyful as she looks in that photo, wherein she’s caught planting a sweet kiss on Happy’s cheek as he sticks his tongue out in a faux disgusted expression. Tony recognises the background of the picture as the inside of the Guggenheim and an ache in his chest follows the realisation. Tony has connections there, and more than once an argument began between him and Steve when he tried to persuade Steve to showcase some of his art. Steve’s stance on the matter was always a firm
Tony nods his head slowly but gives no verbal reply. After another moment of eye contact, Natasha swipes Tony’s feet from under him with a vicious grin. The engineer yelps as his back hits the mat and glares up at the redhead, who looks thoroughly delighted at having caught him off guard.
The kitchen is silent for a moment until Natasha hops down from the counter gracefully and gives Bucky a stern look. “Grow up, James.”
3) I convinced myself that I was bereft of inspiration yet wrote many other pieces for other ships on my laptop and politely ignored the one fic I actually had to update.
“There’s nothing wrong with visiting a friend. Anyway, that’s not what I came to talk about. I came to tell you that Happy is being released tomorrow. The doctors are happy with his progress, so they’re allowing him to come home provided he get plenty of bed rest and take it easy.”
Tony clears his throat and wipes at his eyes with the backs of his hands. “I’ve gotta go, Pep. Long flight and all. I’ll call you when I land.”
A pause ensues. Tony glances up and finds Barnes staring at him with a determined set to his jaw. Tony shifts on the couch, chest suddenly tight with apprehension.
FRIDAY is silent for a minute. Tony eats the rest of the doughnut with no interruption, and then decides to eat another just for the hell of it.
“What-” He manages to get out before Pepper takes a menacing step forward and firmly pokes him in the sternum.
“Well, that’s nothing new, is it?” says Pepper sharply, arms crossed over her chest and a single eyebrow raised as if daring Steve to snap back at her. “Steve, you are meant to be one of the greatest strategists this country has ever seen - if you can’t figure out a way to help Tony without smothering him then we’re all doomed.”
Tony sighs loudly and makes a vague gesture for FRIDAY to do her thing and play the damn video already. After hours upon hours of nagging, FRIDAY is finally getting her way and her smugness is evident when the video is displayed in less than a second. Tony rolls his eyes at his AI but leans back in his chair to get a look at this supposedly very important recording. What he sees makes him sick to his stomach, and Tony is honestly very fed up of feeling betrayed by people he trusts.
Tony shakes his head. “Technically, no, it’s not, and I’m not calling you that, either. We’re not friends, and I’m not-” Tony cuts himself off but Barnes seems to understand what he was about to say anyway.
“How-” He swallows, eyes downcast. Tony raises an eyebrow. It’s rare for Barnes to show a great deal of emotion other than anger, so for him to be so hesitant only fuels Tony’s curiosity. “How hard was it?” he tries again, tone a hushed rumble.
Steve and him… It feels like they have a once in a lifetime thing going on. Tony, at this point, is quite sure that Steve is the one. Whether it’s when it’s Tony losing the track of time with projects, Steve agonizing over correspondances, arguing about the balance of keeping their relationship private from the public but not really a secret from their friends and family…
Tony sets his cup and Steve’s glass down and throws him the little balled up post-it note. Steve bats it away, then immediately catches it with the tip of his shoe. It’s such a fluid motion, so cat-like in its cuteness that it’s impossible for Tony to get angry at him.
Contrary to what the tabloids wanted people to think, Tony could still walk on the streets without getting recognized. Much. Especially with a beard, if you could call his fluffy facial hair that.
The rest is a bit of a blur. Steve tries to take the fork from Dum-E while it tries to return it to the drawer and Tony tries to make sure a carving fork is not how Steve meets his end. In the end, one of the prongs catches onto Steve’s beanie, pulling it clean off his head.
“Steve,” Tony cut off, just giving in to the insanity of the moment, “It’s okay. You- You don’t need to- Just feed me the Goddamned croissant before it gets cold.”
“Is that an offer to cook for me?” Steve leans forward too, challenging him, the cheeky glint in his eyes sparkling under the glowing lights.
He opens the door again and Tony is there, standing a polite distance away from the steps. Steve extends the bag, “Here you go. This is all that I could find, though, if you have anything else missing-”
“You won’t be able to eat like that. I-” Steve reached out, then pulled back abruptly. He looked towards the counter and the line before it.
He brings up a finger, touching one of Steve’s ears. It twitches. “Oh God, that’s the cutest thing ever.”
He wondered if Captain America would remember Howard. If he would see his father in Tony’s face. Or if he had already seen it. If that was why he had saved him.
So, Steve thinks, why don’t I just have fun. He stops trying to calculate his chances to get in another hit and formulates the places where he can take cover. He just wants to talk to Iron Man, just a little bit more. And he finds himself genuinely curious about what he will say. Iron Man is an AI. A game AI. He can’t be that good. Not at everything at the same time.
There, on one of the larger toadstools, sat a frog. But it didn’t look like any other frog, it was… It was a really cute frog, it-
The walk back to the apartment had been tense but affectionate. Tony pulled up the hood of his hoodie just in case. Steve’s hand would momentarily get too tight around his shoulder, then he would realize and press a kiss to his head, whispering sorry into his ear.
“He allows that man into your house?” His hands went to Tony’s hands, then grabbed the legs of Tony’s chair, pulling him close. He buried his face into Tony’s legs, Tony could barely hear him whispering.
Steve looked away suddenly, Tony saw his jaw clench and tremble. He tried to scoot his armchair unsuccessfully.
There was also the part before that of course. Where Ty had dragged Tony to the floor as he had failed to push him away, pressing Tony’s face to the ground as one hand very visibly undid his belt buckle. Tony’s stomach turned, a sudden vision of the asphalt, so close to his face, the smell of his own vomit and Ty’s breath attacking his senses.
The Omega curled up even further into himself if that was possible. Steve didn’t want to touch him. That was a lie. Steve wanted to pull him in, apologize. Keep apologizing for the rest of his life for being so wrapped up in his own made up suffering to recognize Tony’s.
He reached for Tony, fingers closing on his shirt but it was clear that he was acting more out of reflex than with a plan. The pain had made him disoriented. Tony shook the cleaver free from the bone.
After a few dozen broken eggs, flour on most of the counters and on his forehead, Tony manages to present a stack of pancakes to Steve. Drizzled with maple syrup and too many berries, but Tony made it, so it was his choice.
Tony stands up, “How do you do it? How do you walk into a room when someone is talking about you? Everytime.”
Steve tells him about his kids, which he then corrects to students because Iron Man thinks he actually had children. Iron Man tells him about how his boss, whom he calls “the boss lady,” is riding his ass about paperwork and that he should be doing it but God, he hates doing it. But he will anyway.
Steve Googled the shit out of ways to get rid of smells. He boiled coffee. Wiped the floors with said coffee.
Steve buried his nose into Tony’s hair, “I never questioned getting caught as much as I did back then, you know. I really, really wanted to beat him into pulp,” he pulled away a little, his hand came up to cup Tony’s face, with utmost care and gentleness that was in stark contrast to his steely voice, “And I wouldn’t have minded, you know? After seeing, after- How he treated you- How could do that to you?“
The same woman that took their orders came with a little tray full with their drinks and warm croissants, dusted sugar starting to melt on them.
He does trim his beard though. Looking put together never hurt anybody. Definitely a plus, if you’re going to see the guy you’ve had a crush on for over a month. For the second time. After a total fucking disaster.
The sparkly A they had plopped on top of the tree as a topper fell to the floor. The top branches rustled once again, to reveal… Some kind of blob, precariously trying to find its footing on the slippery plastic needles.
He tried to will his body to move, to get out of the house. He was bolted to this place, an almost palpable weight on his shoulders keeping him there. One hand still on the nail, embedded into the wall and hammer in the air.
They talked about Steve’s moving adventures first. Then his reasons; his Ma’s illness, losing her at the hospital and his best friend overseas and looking around Brooklyn to see pain everywhere. And in turn Tony told his own story, about leaving a busy life with three cities in one day, shareholder’s meetings, inventing with strict deadlines on endless budget that got quite unfulfilling really quickly.
He got defensive and well… Some needlessly rude things had been said and assumptions had been made. By Steve. Because Steve is great at acting without thinking apparently.
Unfortunately not only he is too late to realize the culprit, but he is also under a car. And so, before Tony can recover from bumping his head and free himself from under the chassis, the goose is gone. So is his brand new cable.
Oh my God, Tony wanted to say, I love you, but toned it down for a still enthusiastic affirmation, “Yes, exactly, but for that first one would need to know the language of the program they’re working with, I am making one from scratch.”
Tony wouldn’t have believed it if the confirmation didn’t come from Howard’s own files. He had taken it seriously. Maybe more seriously than he had ever did anything. Tony had grown with the stories of the legendary Captain America. At first worshipping him alongside his father. Than despising him because it had taken his father away. Then coming to terms with him, accepting that it wasn’t Captain America’s fault that Howard was so fucking obsessed with him.
“No,” Tony picks up a shallot, cutting into it, “they cannot be. You get your mini sausages and I get my frittatas. It's a compromise.”
Oh so everyone is in on it. Steve will walk in there and Steve will give that man a piece of his mind because-
In the end, it was like the goat incident had never happened. On the outside. Tony though, knew he had a much bigger problem at hand now.
So nothing was safe in this house anymore. Still, Tony also couldn’t take anything out of the house either. So he had done the only logical thing and had stripped all the previous connection to his workshop that Obie didn’t give two shits about.
But they were just suspicions. Strong ones, Tony knew, but no real evidence. He also suspected that Fury knew about the things Obie and Stone had done, both to Tony and S.I. so maybe he, like him and Steve, just couldn’t quite bring himself to care.
Tony smiles, “You don’t look too bad yourself,” he whispers, “I’m going to kiss you now.” Their lips connect in a soft movement, as Steve carries them to the bathroom, setting Tony down on the counter.
He looked at the rows and rows of continuous A’s and G’s his forehead created. He would find a way, he was going to. He had to. He had seen Howard’s firewalls, they were good but not unbreakable. Especially after so many years. He needed something that would change. Adapt as time went on and coding languages changed and code breakers evolved. Steve’s security depended on that. The security of his identity depended on that.
Steve had followed the news about The Avengers, but he hadn’t really planned on getting into the game. Tony Stark had given several interviews about how much he liked these kinds of games when he was younger. About the thrilling sense of anonymity but still being connected to a community… It had seemed like the game was something he was truly excited about.
God, he realized with absolute horror washing over him like ice cold water, there is something in the walls.
Flushing deep red, Steve looks down, he knows Tony is smirking, it is actually ridiculous how Tony could reduce Steve down to a blushing mess. It’s not like Steve is a Choir boy, the man is a veteran. He knows sex. The gorgeous blonde adonis knows his way round Tony’s body, knows exactly what makes him tick and what he needs.  It’s to be disclosed that Steve did call it love making, which Tony had exploited in his mission to reduce Steve into a spluttering blushing mess. He had been very successful.
He looked down at Steve, then took out his phone and reaching out, he took Steve’s out of his pocket as well. He closed both of them and threw them deep into his laptop bag. Just in case.
“Well, uh, a hunch? I don’t- I mean you were the first one to actually see through the act, you know? But also, that fucking glittery rock has been there for a very long time and let me tell you, Captain, a truly huge team worked on this game. After your indignancy about the glittery rock thing, I made- Uh- Contacted some teams about the previous fights and you know what, literally, nobody used that glittery reflective rock things. No one knew about those. You were right. That is shitty design.”
Steve also had called it a “family brunch” and had said without “the kids” it wouldn’t be complete and Tony had been too full of emotions to properly argue with that.
Steve pulled out almost completely before fucking into him again. Tony clenched around him, his body still unresponsive. It only took a couple pumps for Steve’s cock to start twitching inside him. He slumped almost completely over Tony.
Their frittata muffins go into the oven and the remaining mini sausages go in the pan to sear and finally, the penthouse starts smelling like there is a proper brunch going on. Tony brews his coffee as Steve pops the bread into the toaster.
“No! I will roast you for Thanksgiving! Hell, I will roast you for a completely insignificant mid-week lunch you-” Tony stands back up as the surprisingly agile goose makes it off with his screwdriver, ducking under the table as it runs away. For the third time that day.
And then the Iron Man had laughed, laughed and said, “Well, maybe that was too cliche, even for me. I do like myself a feisty challenger though.”
He heard the first of the cotton soft steps drifting somewhere between sleep and wakefulness. Immediately brought back to reality, Steve tightened his grip on the hammer in his fist, grounding himself.
A light trickle of vanilla, not burned but soft, almost creamy came to his nose. He looked down to see the Omega, Tony, nodding off as seldom sob rocked him. Exhaustion. Adrenaline wearing off.
Tony leans back in his chair, his eyes flickering up to Steve and back down, “It wasn’t breakfast that I was talking about.”
He couldn’t bodily go in there, he just couldn’t. From here to the front door, maybe three seconds. Shouldering it open, maybe five. Ten seconds tops, he could get out of the house. On tiptoes and legs tight, Steve braced himself for running. Extended a shaky hand into the kitchen where the tinkering was getting louder still, he flipped the light switch on.
He imagined Stone feeling that way too. his Omega dying and being unable to save them. Having to go through the rest of your life, knowing you weren’t enough to keep them safe.
A thought occured like lightning, sudden and terrifying with its force, how long until someone else figures it out.
Steve’s mother had been a nurse. From how he talked about her, Tony could tell he loved his mother. Steve had lost her to tuberculosis. He had thought he had come to terms with losing her.
“Tony,” Steve breathed his name against his lips, “I used to live day by day. After,” he sighs, “everything. Everyone I knew died. their memories faded from everywhere but my mind, I just- The fucking rage- Sorry.” He apologized and squirmed, looking like he couldn’t find the words but Tony felt like he knew what was coming. He had accepted it already. I’m yours, he wanted to say, you can say it too. But he waited for Steve to collect his thoughts.
Steve smiled, coming around Tony to plant a kiss on his brow, “Sure, let’s find out the Iron Tsum’s favorites too.”
That didn’t change the fact that he was a mess though. All throughout the process of sneaking back out of the mansion, on the taxi, there was just one thing on his mind, almost pushing him to the edge: I was supposed to be useful.
I want to do that too, Tony doesn’t say. Instead he says, “It’s a robot, it doesn’t have feelings.” Steve steals another mini sausage from in front of him.
And it would also be weird to act like nothing happened. Which, at this moment, really doesn’t solve his problem of hoarding the man’s equipment in his own house.
It wasn’t a sudden thing, images came to him slowly, detached. But he could recall seeing Steve’s eyes like this. He could remember seeing his face that first night, transmuted into a twitching mask with cold, cold rage. Mind transported to another dimension that called him to hit and smash and rip and burn. And he could remember it, however hazy.
Now, after sitting on the floor for God knows how many hours, surrounded by everything he has ever made, Steve is even less sure than he was when Iron Man first hinted at sending in a portfolio.
He looks back at the goose. Well, somebody was able to tie that around its neck, so it must be safe to take it off, right?
Maybe Tony’s attempts at goose-proofing the garage haven’t been too successful; considering, as a mechanic, he has to wheel in and out cars, sometimes tractors and hefty motor blocks of farming equipment. Some part of the garage has to open up and that opening has to be big. But, there is nothing holding him from following the goose and finding the little offender’s stash of stolen goods.
When Tony arrived at the apartment around five in the afternoon with bags and boxes in hand, Steve was gone. He placed the shopping bags by the door. He had bought whatever came to his mind; quality notebooks, pencils, a phone, a couple hoodies and stuff, he had guessed the sizes, he wanted to buy bottoms too but that was harder to guess. But that could wait anyway.
At least, one of the pros of teaching teenagers is that he can actually bounce his game mechanics ideas off of them and they will deliver. He gives his sophomores a list of features, totally stolen from The Avengers game and tells them that they can only choose three to design their own character. For seniors, he brings out the map making ideas and that distracts them enough that they don’t realize he’s also distracted.
“Wha- What would you like to do?” Steve’s fingers found the edge of his hoodie, fiddling with it. “You can have anything too, Tony,” cheeks pink, he averted his eyes, looking down at his own hands, “anything you want.”
“I mean like,” Steve does a couple solo attacks by tapping his mouse, “People can find out where you live and stuff. Doxxing happens. It’s just… There are too many things that could go wrong with being a public figure.”
Steve laughs, and gets both of their toothbrushes, “I did not say you were, nor did I insinuate that.”
He goes all the way back to his high school sketches. He gets lost browsing through things he couldn’t finish before his surgery, back when his scoliosis was giving him more trouble. He’s surprised to see he still feels an interest, looking through his sketches of elven archers that are definitely not Legolas but brunette.
No one had seen Stone’s Omega in the last three years. Because Tony had been dead for the last three years. For three years, people came inside the house, talked to Stone, shook his hand, made small talk with him and felt sorry about this poor lonely Alpha who had lost his-
That Howard’s files were still in this mansion. They were protected but Obie still had a right to everything with the name Stark on it for another year. Until Tony turned twenty one, he basically owned nothing.
He had lost everyone. It was hard to talk about, for him, and Tony didn’t want to push but he could see it in Steve’s eyes. Everyone had left him. He wanted to follow them too.
This time the genius squints his eyes, “Well nothing, now,” he’s met with another laugh as Steve folds up the newspaper and places it back onto the counter, for anyone, mostly Clint, to do the crossword puzzle. “So what’s for lunch, doll?”
“No! I’m serious! I- Ugh. The thing is, since I control the last boss it’s- Well, it’s best that I oversee how people level up to come to me you know. Like, it’s not impossible to beat me. Just, really really hard and needs some more problem solving materials rather than levelling up than people realize so, yeah, I do oversee some of the design process.”
Steve hates many things. He hates bananas and cucumbers in any shape of form. Hates raw tomatoes but will eat them cooked. Garlic, he’s allergic to. And onions, he can tolerate in very small quantities when cooked thoroughly.
He wasn’t that far away from the lounge, Tony realized. A flash of last night came into his mind, a ghost sensation of Ty’s hands attacked him suddenly. He shuddered. His stomach made a poor attempt at turning. When he walked in the direction of the venue, no one gave him a second look in the morning crowd. His absolutely revolting state was a bonus at making people look away.
Once inside, Steve slumps against the door frame for two seconds, needing to regroup. This is harder than he thought it would be and Tony looks better than he has any right to with his perfect curl falling on his forehead and his perfect facial hair and- Well, at least he didn’t bring up the note, or the delivery method, Steve thinks, not that he gave him any time to speak.
The Omega watched him wash the glass for a good thirty second before twitching. Steve filled it up again and brought it to his lips.
That’s- That’s not exactly what Steve sets out to say. He’s not even sure what exactly solidifies the thought in his head; whether it’s the hexagonal beam, the human-like responses, the speech patterns… Or Iron Man waiting for him, calling him by a nickname.
Even Howard had found Maria on his first day. Tony could still remember how Howard had been when his mother was alive. Now though, both of them were gone and Tony was all alone in the Avenger Forest with not a single soul in sight.
It took a moment for Tony to register what he was asking permission for, “Yes, baby. Steve, come inside me baby, come on.”
He talked about Howard and how he remembered him to be. He talked about Dr. Erskine, who would only be the first person on the long list of loved ones Steve would lose in the years to come after the serum. He talked about Peggy. Tony could still remember Aunt Peg, even if the memories were hazy. Still, Steve was happier, after Tony told his own tales about her no bullshit attitude and the times she spent with him when he was little.
“Guys, this is totally my kind of thing!” Peter practically jumped up in his seat from excitement. “I mean maybe this guy was a part of the Vulture’s ring that I didn’t capture. I mean, I do this sorta thing!”
“I know,” Tony answered. Their banter seemed to be making the situation less awkward because it got a small giggle from Peter even if he did still seem a little uncomfortable. Steve never really had a dad around to see kissing his Ma, but had some random person been kissing his Ma, he was sure he’d feel embarrassed as well.
“I know you, my Omega, and I know that no matter what you crave excitement, and interaction, and well... adventure. But recently, you just go down to the lab and work-“
“Steve was just distracting me from my work,” Tony added while giving Steve a stern glare from where he was now standing above him.
Another skill is given to him, Steve stumbled upon quite on accident when they had just started sharing a bed, Steve woke early and was disturbed to hear Tony muttering gibberish. In a wave of Catholic panic, Steve shook awake his mate, convinced he was speaking in tongues, only to feel very foolish when it turned out he’d been dreaming in Italian, and there was no need for a priest or an exorcist.
“I looked at the... stuff... and then I felt weird so I closed it and brought the whole thing,” Steve was speaking fast.
Steve, who could somehow see through all his acts and waited patiently for Tony to come around. He still remembered the day that he knew he was screwed – apart from his ever-growing attraction to the alpha. It was late and Steve had been in a mood the entire day, and Tony being the jerk he was, saw his mood as an opportunity to antagonize him even worse. He could still remember the sad puppy dog look in Steve’s eyes as he sat nursing a whole bottle of whiskey. Before Tony could even get a word out, Steve said, “Tony, I don’t want to fight today.” For some reason, the sincerity and almost begging quality of his voice caught him off guard, and he knew that from that moment on things were going to be different. Tony sat down and listened as Steve explained it was his best friend’s birthday, Bucky, who he lost long ago in the war. He missed him all the time, but today more than usual which was why he was practicing getting drunk although it wasn’t going very well due to his “super-soldier metabolism” and all that. To both of their surprises, they talked through the night, Tony bringing up how he missed his mother and springing from there until the sunrise over the city skyline the next morning, covering all ranges of topics from the best place to get a burgers and fries to art, making plans to visit the Metropolitan together until the sunrise. They watched it together in soft, comfortable silence, knowing that from now on things were going to be changing at a rapid pace between them.
Tony now having to start his getting comfy process over again just grunted in response while snuggling down. After a few moments he stilled and sighed, so Steve knew that to be his cue to wrap his arms around his mate.
“Well, that’s what you like, right?” Steve asked and waited for Tony to nod. “Good, then that’s what we’ll keep doing.”
Tony found Steve on the balcony of their room, a cigarette between his lips. It was a habit from the past that got bad back in the army, but ever since arriving in the future and being told how bad they were for you, he claimed that he was trying to quit. Tony’s team of publicists told Steve he couldn’t smoke in public at all. The face of American goodness couldn’t have a smoking problem, apparently. In his defense, he did cut down quite a bit after he and Tony mated since Tony hated the smell since it reminded him of Howard. Now, he saved it for when he was truly in distress and in need of a break.
Tony panicked, “he got his heat! That’s all.” May didn’t respond for a minute. “Peter’s an omega, May.”
“Right, right,” Peter said while still looking down and kicking his shoe. Peter was 15, still awkward, and the only reason he didn’t have his baby fat anymore was because of the spider bite. Steve was sure or else he would have presented already. This was why Tony insisted on keeping Peter completely away from anything dirtier than holding hands, something Steve had to be reminded of a lot because he was, as Tony described him – touchy. He said that children who hadn’t even presented yet didn’t need to be exposed to that, and although Steve argued that modeling a healthy relationship in which people were comfortable with each was important, Peter was Tony’s baby. He had no place to argue.
“Than just go in!” she snapped as though the solution was so simple. “I’m sorry,” she said. “I just have a long night ahead of me, and I need some help right now. Just go to the office and talk to the receptionist and tell her that you are one of Peter’s emergency contacts and have the authorization from me to call him off school for the rest of the week because he got his heat.” She was speaking slow and controlled as she might snap at any minute. He knew that he wasn’t great at some of the logistical sides of co-parenting – if that’s what they were going to call it – but it still hurt when she talked down to him so much.
“Listen, love, I gotta go, but I’ll see you tonight. Maybe we can talk with Peter about ideas for you know that thing we talked about this morning.”
“Peter, we want you to do stuff, and we love that you are so willing to help anyone in need. All we want is to make sure that you’re okay. You are way too important to us, both of us,” he emphasized, “to lose. Do you understand?”
The ride up there wasn’t long, and before Clint could, Natasha took control of the radio – wait they didn’t call it that anymore – nonetheless, he was grateful as Clint usually played music gave Steve a headache. He was still working on appreciating modern music. Tony thought it would be best if they started where he left and kept going through the decades from there, so far, he was in the sixty’s which he was thoroughly enjoying. Natasha, however, was playing light classical music. Geez, I’m not that old, Steve thought stubbornly and noticed Clint rolling his eyes and switching off his hearing aids at her choice of music. He would have preferred some of the music he and Tony were currently listening to at home like The Beatles, or The Temptations, or his favorite, much to Tony’s surprise and fascination, CCR. Fortunately, the ride was short enough that the classical music didn’t get on his nerves like sometimes it did.
“That’s true.” The obstacle would be Tony though. He said he wasn’t bitter about canceling their travel plans and being left vulnerable right after mating, but Steve knew better. Tony also said that Bucky didn’t scare him, even though Bucky had snapped at him several times, but Steve knew better. “Well, I’ll take this back to Tony,” he said and held up the tube of dirt.
Steve shifted into concerned mate mode. “Okay, babe, what is it?” Steve held his face tenderly and looked deep into his eyes. God Tony didn’t deserve this man.
“So I think finding something, a new adventure so the speak, would take your mind off things. We can keep trying, but hopefully, if you have something else to look forward to... I don’t know, maybe it just wouldn’t be all you could focus on.”
It was good to hear that Tony was looking forward to sharing something special with him and Peter – a family dinner. “That sounds perfect, sweetheart.”
“Yes please,” Peter answered. Steve poked around the fridge and found the makings for a ham sandwich. “Ham sandwich?” he asked.
“I’ll be on my very best behavior,” Steve affirmed, finally getting up off the floor to stand up straight-backed with his face far too serious. Tony rolled his eyes dramatically, but walked away and left Peter and Steve alone. “Cm’ere, kid,” Steve said. Peter let himself be wrapped up his a big hug. “Let’s go upstairs, yeah?” Peter nodded along. They started walking towards the elevator. “And now, what’s this about food poisoning?”
“Tony I need a favor,” she said. Tony was too surprised and was suffering from whiplash to even register what was happening. “I’m about to start my shift at the hospital and I won’t be able to call the school in the morning to explain why he won’t be there for a week.”
Getting pregnant, as it tuned out, was hard. Tony knew from the moment he presented that male omegas had a harder time getting pregnant due to unpredictable cycles and limited research. Tony wasn’t much good at paying attention to the “squishy sciences”, but he also never gave much thought to getting pregnant. After all, why would he need to? All his life he detested the idea of finding a nice alpha to settle down with and start popping out kids for, even though only knows it’s all his parents wanted for him. He wanted his own life where he’d be respected for his intellect, not just his body. He’d be a genius, not just somebody’s mate. He wanted to work and make a difference in the world, to know that the world was different, not just different –better, because he was on earth. It was all he wanted really. Mates, especially alphas, were a distraction from all that, or so he thought.
When Steve came up behind him carrying the whole box, he felt grateful. Maybe his mate would know how to do this because he was sure as hell didn’t.
So I tried to make this one longer which is hard when it’s a chapter that didn’t just naturally come to me, instead I had to think it out more in relation to the rest of the plot. But also there’s a lot happening here which I like. I’m trying to show a kind of Steve that doesn’t hate everything about the future and although he has anxiety and ptsd (which will be explored more later) he still has fulfillment and meaning in life. So yeah let me know what you guys think. :)
“Doesn’t sound like a very reliable system,” she said with a far off look in her eyes. If it was anyone other than Natasha, he’d take offense to the remark.
She answered after three rings and sounded like she usually did, flustered. “Tony, is everything okay? Is Peter hurt?”
“I’m a mated man, Tony. My body doesn’t react to any omega’s heat scent besides yours – ya know, my mate.”
Suddenly, his hand was pulled away, exposing the little line again before it was replaced by a soft pair of lips. Steve. A soft purring cane from his chest and slipped out of his lips without him even really noticing.
“Oh shit, I haven’t got to it yet,” Tony muttered his easygoing mood instantly dropping as he slipped into his public and work Tony mode. “Put her on. I’ll explain.”
Oh, that’s what she had meant. Feeling quite embarrassed Tony said, “May, I would call, but they’re going to think that it’s some sort of prank if I-“
Tony sighed, “I don’t know there was some kind of explosion. They expect it was caused by alien tech... I wasn’t there, Steve?”
Subconsciously, Tony felt himself rubbing his forehead where the scar from that night was. It had been many years and his eyebrow covered most of it, but they're still a small faded line of skin raised beside his right eyebrow.
Through the phone, he could hear a sweet sigh. “I love you too. More than you know.” Gosh, how on Earth did he get so lucky. “And come home early,” he threatened.
Not bothering to knock, he opened the door to find the two already looking at the screen in of a desktop computer and in deep thought. “Hey guys,” he greeted.
Steve’s lip curved into a slight smile as a huff of a laugh came out. Clint was a spy and good at his job, but Steve had learned a few things over the years. Trying to incite an emotional reaction from him wasn’t going to work on him – despite having a reputation as a hothead. He appreciated his effort, though, it meant he cared. “No, Clint, but I’m glad you care enough to ask.”
“No, that’s what happened,” Steve affirmed. “It was upstate in a home lab. We figure it was someone playing with something they don’t understand, but we want to make sure that’s all. We don’t need an alien tech-powered supervillain,” he explained. “Not a big deal,” he assured.
Steve’s face flushed at Clint’s implications anyways despite him being cut off before he was able to take his joke further. It wasn’t that he wasn’t used to it. He’d heard more dirty words and even more dirty stories than he was keen to remember from the boys in the army. He never partook, though, all he could think about at the time is how mortified those omegas would be if they knew that all their alpha’s friends knew every dirty thing they’ve ever done. As far as the dirty words, he learned to save those for special occasions also after the first time he swore around Tony, and his poor mate was so shocked by it that he apparently thought Steve swearing was, in his own words, the hottest thing he’s ever experienced. So yeah, Steve saved liked to save some things just for his Tony.
“I don’t know, Tony wants me home early,” Steve said hesitantly and checked his watch. 11:00, not much time to get upstate and back with traffic.
“Sir, Natasha is calling to inquire about the results of the analysis of soil samples,” Jarvis said, interrupting their conversation.
“It’s not that bad,” Tony said, trying really hard to get over to stench. He knew somewhere beneath the smoke had to be Steve’s scent. He pressed his face into Steve’s chest and took a long, deep breath. There it was underneath it all, cedarwood and the earth after it rained. It wasn’t fair that a person could smell so good.
“I didn’t know you stopped being Captain America and became Captain Obvious,” Clint replied, already over Natasha’s earlier scolding and back to his usual bad jokes, but it worked at getting a chuckle out of Steve.
“Goodbye, guys, and uh, Clint,” he said, getting his attention away from rubbing his ribs, “I will.”
Wrestling Peter into his arms and picking him up was harder than Tony thought it was going to be, but once he succeeded, he sighed a breath of relief and said, “Steve, go into our room, and in our closet, there’s a brown wood box on my wide with some supplies in it.”
“Ah,” Steve said calmly before taking it out of his hand and replacing it with his coffee mug. He knew better than to prod right away, so he walked around the bed to take his usual spot but not before Tony caught the smug look on his face right after he handed Tony the mug.
“Besides,” Steve laughed, “if I stay, Peter might try to become my omega.” Tony growled at the mere thought of anyone getting near his Steve. “I’m gonna go. See you soon?”
“Maybe I could find another way to convince you,” Steve suggested. Both of them laughed as Steve pressed their lips together. It was one of those sweet kisses shared in between giggles that were chaste but loving, showing nothing but pure adoration.
Tony started to get the lasagna and meatballs out, which smelled delicious, but Steve waited till Peter was distracted to ask, “Should we tell him that we’ve both been to Area 51 and that it’s not as exciting as it sounds, or let him keep going?”
“What?” he asked, shocked and, frankly, offended. He and May had differences but hadn’t anticipated her being sexist. “If you-“
“May, this isn’t something I planned,” he defended. He knew May thought he was a bad influence, but this was a bit much even for him.
“I can’t do this, so can you explain all this and take over for me?” Tony spat out quickly and looked away, feeling incredibly ashamed.
“We were going to go up to the cite. Take some samples. We were hoping Tony could analyze them,” Clint said and then added, “and we were hoping that you’d come up with us.”
“Very funny, Jay,” Tony mumbled while squirming around again in order to see the movie because apparently, he wasn’t thinking about that while in his getting comfy mode. Steve snickered at his fussy mate which earned him a small growl.
“If you do this, you have to report directly to me, every day. Every single day. I don’t care if you were just doing homework that day and didn’t have time to do work on this. I want to know even then.”
No one looked up as he walked by. This was a new development because it used to be that people would stare as he passed, but he supposed people returning from the dead via ice was old news now that aliens had invaded Earth. He appreciated the lack of stares but thinking about the reason why that was filled him with more dread than he knew what to do with. Pushing through those thoughts and the rows and rows of what always seemed to be never-ending cubicles he came to the back office where he met Natasha and Clint when they called him up.
“I’m kind of royalty,” Steve had squirmed, “Not really high up there but, well, I really don’t like calling people this but I’m sure you’re familiar with social climbers who want to use you as a, well, step.”
“You should sit down and have some babe. Chicken salad, tasty and healthy. Prepared by yours truly,” pulling out a chair for Steve, Tony takes the seat right next to him and dishes out some of the salad.
He’s been in the development team, since the beginning of the game. He loves MMORPGs and kind of hates FPS games, which is a sentiment Steve can actually get behind. He’s actually not that good at playing, or so he says, which Steve is surprised to hear. But he’s good at coding on the go and strategizing. And he waves Steve away when he tells Iron Man being able to modify code like that on the go is more impressive than being able to play good.
Steve can’t help but laugh, pulling him onto his lap and keeping his arms looped around his waist, “Dinner at eight?”
At least him being out of it and somewhere else on a morning without leaving a notice wasn’t anything new.
“Tony!” Steve wipes a hand over his face, “that’s what you-” He sighs. “I just- I loved what we had! And then you said how it was nice to be with someone down to earth and kind of low-key and I panicked and then things got out of hand and I just kept saying I was going to tell you later and later and that later just- Never came I guess.”
It shook Tony; how careful with him Steve was, how gentle. He had seen Steve crush a man’s skull with his bare hands. Just the pull of his fingertips had strained the tacked and sown in edges of upholstery. Yet here he was, softly kissing his hair, holding him under his arm.
Steve chuckles and brushes Tony’s stray hairs away, “It’ll be fine, seeing you later tonight will make us forget all about our day.”
He is surprised, really, that he hasn’t thought of this before. He’s a genius. Supposedly. Self-proclaimed but still... It’s just that, the monotone but deafeningly loud and repetitive honks of the creature are so damn disheartening that he just… Gave up. Before even trying.
They needed to plan. They needed some kind of security net to fall back to. Tony had no idea why the hell Obie wanted him to be there for the dinner. He couldn’t remember the last time he saw Ty’s father. He couldn’t remember the last time Obie ever wanted him to be present for anything anywhere other than places where cameras were present.
“You’ve told her?” Tony’s voice is sharp, “Jesus, Steve – I don’t want people knowing – the whole point of meeting in secret is to keep it secret.”
“I’m Dr. Rodriguez, I was lead trauma surgeon on your – friend, Tony Stark. He’s in recovery now, coming up from anesthesia. Our visiting hours have ended, but… I can probably get you in when we go to move him, just for a minute.”
birthday, the same day as Tony does - no longer driven to drinking and sleeping around to handle the pressure of being Stark Industries’ golden boy. He will be free to invent – Steve knows that is what he will do, without the bone-crushing pressure and expectations. He can’t wait to see what Tony comes up with. Steve will one day head to the grocery store with a small list for him and Bucky, and he will reach out for a tomato just as Tony Stark will reach for the same one. His slender fingers, nicked from some workshop snafu, will brush along the back of Steve’s hand. He’ll look up, and brown eyes will meet blue. Tony will blush, Steve can feel the heat of it even as he stands on the platform, waiting. He’ll recognize Steve in an instant, thinking in horror of the countless times he’d touched himself as he had stared at his Captain America poster when he was fifteen and beyond – even now, sometimes…
“I can be very convincing,” Natasha’s hand runs down the front of the tie, flattening it, and her hand catches the very edge of one of the bruises spreading from his ribs. He winces, and she notices.
Tony arches up into his touch with a breathless moan, his hand grabbing at the fabric of Steve’s sweatpants. “Steve,” he gasps as Steve’s fingers dip below the waistband of his briefs.
“Aphrodisiac?” Tony supplies with a knowing smile, reaching out casually for one. Steve watches as Tony brings the shell to his lips, watches him swallow. The urge to lunge across the table, grab him by the front of his lapels, and kiss him until he’s breathless is almost overwhelming. Instead, he reaches for his own oyster, fingers brushing against melting ice.
“God, Tony, you have a lot of hair.” Steve’s fingers gently massage his scalp as he works, shifting as Tony sags against him.
“It’s nice,” Steve murmurs, kissing Tony slowly, feeling him melt into Steve’s embrace with a quiet sigh. “I love you.”
“You’re looking for an ice pack in here? You might want to check the freezer.” Steve pulls open another drawer, rooting around for a moment. “I found some.” They’re the first aid ice packs, the ones that you had to snap in half to get cool – not as nice as a real ice pack, but the med-bay is private. They need privacy, because Steve doesn’t know where this conversation is going to go. He knows what he wants, though, he wants Tony’s fingers in his hair, wants to hear Tony panting against his lips as Steve steals his air. The ice pack crunches in Steve’s fist, cold against his palm.
“Aw, come on, Tony. You’d be a great dad.” Not that Steve would ever admit it, but he had daydreamed of a reality in which he and Tony had a kid. They’d call Tony ‘Dad’, and him ‘Pop’ – it was the perfect fantasy world for Steve to lose himself in as he prowled around the gym in an effort to keep himself busy.
“There’s not much to it,” Tony says between gritted teeth, sweat burning in his eyes, “I just picture your face on the bag and pummel the shit out of it.”
Tony clicks call, and raises the phone up to his ear, hearing it ring. He looks up sharply at a whistling sound coming in through the doors, looking over his shoulder at the other three men, and then hurries towards the door when he hears screams.
“You probably should have done that in Siberia.” Tony’s voice is flat, words clipped – he should hang up, but he can’t.
“I’m not wearing these things,” Tony mutters, leaning back against Steve again as he wraps his arms around him.
“You and I both know that whatever orders HYDRA gave, they would have specified the need for no witnesses. I’m telling you, Tony – I swear to you, he wasn’t there. Bucky wasn’t there. His body was there, yes – but his mind? We’re just beginning to get him back. I can… I can arrange for you to speak with a spokesperson from Wakanda, they can talk you through what they’ve found while…”
All Steve can think about is Tony sprawled out on the sidewalk, bleeding, without shoes on. They stole his shoes – Steve can’t fathom it.
Steve closes his eyes, bowing his head, and Tony presses his forehead against his before he retreats entirely into himself.
“I’m not… I’m not…” Steve can’t find the words, and Tony runs his hands over his shoulders soothingly.
“Tony,” Steve snaps, “You can’t make this choice because of — of hero worship, or — or a lack of self esteem, or…”
“Oh, you have such a way with words – why didn’t you say that before I sucked your dick?” Tony’s hand strikes the table top, and Steve’s eyes widen in embarrassment, his cheeks flushing. “Or after? What was that to you, just a way to let off steam?”
Steve sits next to him at the counter, pouring Tony a mug of coffee, which the other man begins to drink the minute Steve pulls the carafe away.
Tony hangs up, feeling like he’s going to be sick. He leans over the side of the bed and vomits, dimly aware of the fact that he’s ruined Pepper’s shoes and that there’s blood in his vomit.
It’s perverse, and terrible, and he shouldn’t be laughing – but he can’t laugh, anyways, because Thanos is plunging the blade to its hilt, and blood pours out of his mouth.
Steve shrugs his shoulders, “Guess not.” He locks the door to the apartment and offers Tony his hand. Tony hesitates, fisting the fabric of his pocket tightly in an attempt to clean his palm, and then reaches out to take Steve’s hand.
Steve is tense in his arms, shaking slightly, and Tony rubs his hand against the small of his back soothingly.
“And…” The figure continues, “Steven, son of Sarah. Well, Captain Rogers, I must say this is unexpected…”
Tony relaxes against the mattress, the tension fading out of his body as he starts to drift to sleep.
“Jesus Christ!” Tony backs up, his eyes wide, hand on fire. “Are you just bricks under there? Christ.” His head snaps back as Steve’s fist lands on his jaw, knocking the wind out of him – and were he not wearing a mouth guard, he would have severed his tongue in half between his teeth.
“Well, I kinda – confined her to the compound.” Steve’s blue eyes light up with fury, and Tony feels the explosion tear him apart.
“You are absolutely not supposed to be here,” Tony says, grabbing the boy by his shoulders. “You are supposed to be in New Jersey!”
“It’s alright,” Tony gasps, though his vision is swimming. “I promise it’s alright, Peter. Just — can you…”
“Tada,” Tony says dryly several hours later, wiping his grubby hands on his thighs as he circles around the motorcycle. “All done. Didn’t lose a single screw. You wanna take it for a ride?”
Now it is Tony’s turn to catch Steve off guard, and he watches as the other man’s expression turns guarded, muscles shifting below his beard as he grits his teeth.
“Will you die if you don’t wear red, white, and blue?” Tony gestures to Steve’s outfit – his red boxing gloves, white tank top, blue shorts, white mouth guard – it’s comical. “Like, will you combust?”
“Well…” Steve picks up another croissant, his appetite is rejuvenated. “When would we be able to meet next?”
“I’m not,” Tony says quickly, keeping his voice low. “I’m definitely not, are you kidding? But my mom was. She used to come to this cathedral to pray whenever we were in Genoa. So, when I’m in town, I stop by – and I…” He frowns, and Steve loves him so much that he feels as though he might burst. “I’ll just be a minute.”
Tony blinks. He looks at Steve emptily, and Steve wants to reach out and shake him by the shoulders, but he waits.
Steve grins, closing the sketchbook and looking over at Tony as the other man sprawls out on the deck chair.
Steve’s hands brush down his shoulders and over his arms, and Steve’s grin has faded. “Are you okay?”
Tony laughs, shaking his head. “Are you asking me if I want to die? Nope,” Tony pops the p obnoxiously. “I don’t care how safe you say these things are, I’m not doing it.”
“I didn’t come here to drink.” Tony rests his hand against the mantel, the stone cool despite the heat of the fire. “But I’ll have whiskey, if you’ve got it.”
Steve turns on his side, dog tags sliding over the metal beads as he shifts in bed. Idly, he reaches up to hold them, the silver ring cold against the palm of his hand. He should have gotten rid of these, after Tony had told him that he wanted nothing to do with him – after Tony had made that very clear by disappearing from everyone’s lives. But, he had kept them – because when he closed his eyes, he could still picture Tony sprawled asleep naked in bed with nothing but this very same necklace on.
Tony hangs up, throwing the phone onto the desk, getting to his feet so fast that his head spins. He reaches out and steadies himself, closing his eyes against the vertigo and the nausea.
Tony curses under his breath as he knocks a set of sterilized tweezers to the floor, his swollen hands aching as he digs through the drawer of medical supplies. The compound is oddly quiet – perhaps everyone is sat in their own rooms, reading over the copy of the Sokovia Accords that Tony had brought for each one of them.
“Okay, tomorrow, then,” Tony says quickly, hurrying his pace. “I’ll admit, we should have taken a taxi.”
“Absolutely not.” Tony’s answer is instantaneous, and the words are sharp. “I don’t believe in marriage. I won’t marry you, or anyone.”
None of them are fatal. The one that could possibly invoke the most damage, a broken neck or a broken back – he’d have to get exactly right. He’s drunk enough that he doesn’t trust himself to pirouette through the air as required.
Steve sighs, rubbing the palm of his hand over the coarse denim of his jeans, over and over again, until his palm tingles. He stays quiet while Tony works, not wanting to distract him – it would be to his detriment if Tony forgot some vital component. He’d rather not have the bike blow up between his legs the next time he took it out for a ride.
His morning and afternoon were spent at the gym, punching the punching bag until his arms trembled and his world swam in and out of focus. This was torture, he knew that, because he could feel Steve’s lips against the back of his neck every time his gloved fist struck the bag. Then the burn in his chest would come back, the phantom pain of having his arc reactor shattered into pieces, the burn of betrayal – and the realization that he was weak, that he had set it all aside for a night with the man who had lied to him and nearly killed him.
“Steve…” Tony breathes, and then he groans loudly, and Steve tenses. “God, Steve – Are you still… Ha… Located in… Good ol’… NYC?”
“Do you have a fever?” Steve presses closer to him, his chin resting on Tony’s shoulder. “You’re burning up…” He glances down slowly and his eyes widen, the outline of Tony’s erection is straining against the thin fabric of his briefs. Steve wonders how long Tony has been lying like this in his arms. All night? Surely not. “Oh.”
“Shh, Tony. Sweetheart, please, breathe.” Her fingers card through his hair, slender and soft while Steve’s had been thick and rough from work. Guilt burns almost as bright as the pain in his chest, but he shouldn’t feel guilty – it has been almost half a year since they had broken up. But he does feel guilty, she still wears the perfume he had bought for her, she still touches him with the same tenderness – old habits die hard.
“Don’t Tony me,” he snaps, pointing at Steve, inwardly wishing he had the gauntlet on – the hum of the repulsor would keep him at bay. “When you Tony me, it makes me…”
There’s a pause as Tony collects his thoughts, idly rubbing the edge of the reactor casing through his hospital gown.
He wipes his hand over the fogged up mirror, gazing at his reflection. There are dark shadows under his eyes, the shower had washed away the concealer he had cautiously applied in the cramped airplane bathroom. His fingers brush over the ragged edge of his goatee, reaching with his other hand for his razor – he has time to take care of that, at least, there are bound to be press photos. He needs to look his best, he needs to look like he himself had written the Sokovia Accords.
