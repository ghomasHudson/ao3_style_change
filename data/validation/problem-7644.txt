I think I dreamt of you.  The thought was bright and sharp, cutting through Steve’s mind like a blade, hot and cold at the same time, and just as painful.  He didn’t say it, of course. It was true, Steve supposed.  He could admit that much to himself now. But, it was a useless thought, as most dreams were.  I didn’t dream of this, Steve told himself firmly. He swallowed thickly and felt the collar bob against his throat.  Not this.  This wasn’t what he wanted, he reminded himself, remembering Tony’s response to his declaration with a pang of hurt.  This wasn’t anything like what he wanted.
“Eh, no, forget that. Come here,” the King snapped, sounding oddly distracted, waving a hand at him as Steve started to kneel.  “Here.  Now,” the King said again and moved a few paces around the table, then walked back to his original spot.  Steve walked over to stand next to him and looked down at the table that seemed to be the source of the King’s agitation.  The King looked over at him and his expression shifted, the consternation draining away and something light replacing it.
“That’s good.  That’s good, Anthony.  I—well, I suppose I just wanted to wish you a Happy Birthday.  Your father said to tell you the same.  He has a meeting with one of the suppliers or I’m sure he’d tell you himself,” she lied smoothly.  Of course, by this point, it had to be easy for her.  Tony thought she might even have convinced herself she believed it.
“I can’t, Peg,” Steve said.  “You know I can’t. It could change…we don’t know what it could change. I can’t take that chance.”
“Your mom and Jarvis have been pestering me for weeks,” Howard said, dropping the pool cue he’d been holding down onto the pool table between the two and the eight balls and clapping his hands together, sending a small billow of blue dust into the air.  “I told them you were probably too busy messing around at SHIELD to visit your parents, but what do I know?”
“Bring it,” Rhodey said.
“I’ll do it.  You take forever,” Brock said, jerking his head for Steve to roll over as he thumbed the cap open.
“Couldn’t really see much. Some kind of beam of light. Not sure what it was,” Steve replied, and Tony burst out laughing, then quickly moved to cover his mouth. “That’s funny because…?”
“Everything okay?” Steve asked.
“What if I am?” Tony asked, his voice low with tension.
“Hmmm? Oh, right,” Tony said hurriedly.  “Taken care of,” Tony continued, dipping his hand into the pocket of his suit and pulling out a thin, silver band that shone with a recent polish.  “This was…actually, this is something of a family heirloom, I guess you could say.  Bit of a story, really. It was my butler’s, though he didn’t have it when they first got married, he and his wife.  Men didn’t really wear rings back then, and he wasn’t one for jewelry.  But, then he got over here with my Dad, and all the GIs coming back from the front, they’d sort of taken to wearing rings.  His wife, Ana, she had this necklace that her grandmother had given her when she was a girl. A Chai symbol, for the Hebrew word ‘living,’” Tony explained.  “I think they wanted to give it to their kid, you know, but that didn’t…” he stopped, mouth flattening as he glanced away, letting the wind prick at his eyes.  “That didn’t quite work the way they’d hoped.  So, anyway, one Christmas, she had it made into a ring for him.  I remember her telling him that they were each other’s family, and that was enough.  I think that’s the only time I remember seeing him—my butler—seeing him cry.  Before she died, I mean.  So,” Tony said, clearing his throat again.  “He gave it to me when I graduated college.  Eternally hopeful, despite all evidence to the contrary, I guess you could say.  Anyway, they’d probably be glad to let it see some use, you know?  Even for something…”
The farm…Tony felt a flush of heat creep up his neck.  He couldn’t say that had been the beginning, not exactly.  He wasn’t sure if there had
“The thing,” Coulson offered helpfully.  Tony rolled his eyes.
“Too many awards to care?” Steve asked as he sat back in the seat.
“You’re beautiful,” Tony said.
“My parents said the same thing about me,” Daniel said with a forced sort of cheer.  “Couldn’t shut me up, then boom, couldn’t get a word out of me. Sometimes, you just don’t want to talk, right, Tony?”
“What a pretentious douche, huh?” Kirk grinned.  “So, just-me-nothing-special, what’s your story?” Kirk asked, folding his arms behind his head, tugging the comforter up behind him to cover the weight bar and laying back in something that did not remotely resemble the position Steve had asked him to hold.  Steve sighed and looked at the canvas again, then picked up his pencil and started redoing some of the lines, making them sharper, bolder, more expansive.  He takes up the whole room, Steve thought with a slight smile, realizing it was true.
“Shhh…” Steve admonished, warm breath ghosting over Tony’s skin.  He let his hands fall again to Tony’s waist, holding Tony’s hips steady against him.  His fingers skimmed over the waistband, finding the belt buckle and swiftly undoing it and the button underneath.  Tony’s hips jerked against his hand, and Steve pressed a flat hand to Tony’s stomach, stilling him, and heard Tony grunt.  Steve pulled the zipper down, the sound the only thing other than their mingled, rasping breaths to break the quiet.  Steve pushed the fly of Tony’s pants wide, then used both hands to tug them and the silk boxers down past Tony’s hips.  Tony’s cock, thick and heavy, jutted out as soon as it was freed, the tip edging against the mirror, leaving a streak where it dripped pre-cum onto the glass.
It had taken a couple of weeks to arrange the dinner, not that Tony minded the delay.  He’d won both showcases and gotten two weeks of Steve’s nearly undivided attention and a shiny, new R8.  In red.  It even had a personalized license plate marking it as Tony’s, though, technically, he supposed the title was in Steve’s name.  Everything else about it was his, though.  They had gone to the car dealership together, where Tony pestered the poor, stammering salesman with a manual’s worth of questions about various features and packages, while Steve looked on with a placid, disinterested smile that practically dared the salesman to say a word.
“Hey, I was thinking,” Brock began as he took a sip of the beer.  “How about we have a little get together with Jack and the rest of ‘em this week.  Little celebration kind of a thing, what d'ya say?”
There’s not going to be much left, old man, Tony thought with a sort of vicious satisfaction.
“Subtle,” Steve laughed.  “But, maybe.  One day.  I don’t know.”
“Your parents’ cog,” Steve guessed with a slight frown.
“Okay,” Steve said, pulling the covers up to Tony’s chin.  He hesitated a moment, then bent down and pressed a soft kiss to Tony’s forehead.
“Sleep,” Tony whispered after a long moment, leaning down and placing a soft kiss to Steve’s temple.  “Sleep, my beloved.”
Steve took Tony’s hand off his cock and laced his fingers through it, pressing it down into the couch cushions by his leg.  Tony’s mouth came off his nipple long enough for Tony to look up at Steve in obvious question, but Steve just pressed his mouth to Tony’s again, letting that be his answer.  He felt Tony’s warm sigh against his lips, and let his hands stroke over what parts of Tony he could reach.  Tony may not like his chest touched, but the man had amazing arms, sinewy with muscle, stronger than he looked under the suits he often wore.  Arms that worked and built and created, and hands, Steve thought as he threaded his fingers through Tony’s other hand.  These hands roughened and worn, with hard patches of skin where calluses formed and were sloughed off.  He loved Tony’s hands maybe more than anything.  Tactile, Steve thought again.  He was made to touch, to know his world through his hands.
His heart sped up.  It thudded loudly in his ears, pounding at his ribcage like it wanted to escape. Steve felt as though he was only able to breathe in occasional soft gasps that he tried to hide, but he was sure he failed by the way that Tony’s eyes tracked each one, dropping to Steve’s mouth, then back up to hold his gaze. Tony’s tongue darted out to wet his lips, a motion that made Steve’s cock jerk, and he wondered, if he looked--which he wasn’t--but if he did, if he would see a bulge pressing against that damn red speedo just below the waterline.
“Great. Good.  Can he get us a getaway car?  We can head for the border before the, I don’t know, California Department of Forestry arrives. Why am I picturing a very stern bear in a hat?”  Tony asked, then waved off Steve’s confused expression.  “We could say it was an accident.  Weird things happen.  Maybe the gas pedal got stuck?  Or the throttle got stuck in open position. Which we didn’t notice when we parked and got out.  Sure. It could happen.  The story would honestly sell better if you’d look remotely panicked, though, no worries.  I can do it for both of us,” Tony assured him in a jittery voice, teeth clanking together like they didn’t quite fit in his mouth.
“Huh?  The eclipse? What are you even—“ Tony burst out in frustration, then cut himself off at Jarvis’s look.  “Yeah, sure.  Fine. The eclipse.  She was pissed. Said her shoes would get dusty.  I should’ve asked her first before getting you involved in my little project,” Tony recalled, mouth flattening at the memory.
“The Free States cobbled together an army that defeated Johann Schmidt and his band of fanatics and mercenaries. No small feat,” Ross said, leaning back against the stack of pillows behind him as Steve stared at him in horror. “It is these,” he waved his hand, a sneer forming, “so-called Free States who present the biggest threat our shores have seen since before I can remember.”
War was changing, and the world with it. It felt as if he was watching Tony put his thumb on some tipping point that maybe only a few could see and knowing—knowing in his
The hallway was empty, except for a few partygoers returning from the restrooms.  Tony followed it towards the balcony, unsure of what he would find, but filled with a sort of nervous anticipation.  What if there was a fight?  What was he going to do?  Should he get Coulson?  Or Fury?  No, not Fury.  He didn’t want Steve to get in trouble, not over something stupid like that.  Wait…what if Steve was hurt?  Steve was Steve, fine and good, but that Stone guy was not small and---Tony almost rounded a corner, before low voices stopped him.
“Ugly,” Tony said, casting his eyes down.  Steve grabbed his hands and stilled them, pushing them to Tony’s sides.  He traced his fingers down the gashes, then looked down at his own leg. Though hidden by his breeches, Tony knew the ones on Steve’s leg matched his own.
“You did so well, my treasure,” he added, stroking his knuckles down Steve’s cheek. He tucked his cock away and re-fastened his robes, keeping his eyes on Steve the whole time. Steve waited in the hazy, blissful in-between place, his eyes dull, his mouth cottony with Tony’s seed, his body aching with need. None of it mattered. He had been good. “You’ve been so good, I think you deserve a reward, don’t you?”
“Excuse me?” Steve asked with a frown.
“It’ll--it’ll mess it up,” Steve warned, swallowing thickly, humiliation scalding through him the way it always did when money, or more pointedly, his lack of it, was an issue.  “I can’t replace it, is all, see?”
The shock of sudden relief made his limbs go loose and watery, and for a second, his vision slashed sideways, went black at the edges, before righting itself.  The thing with its hand wrapped around his heart let go in a frantic rush of pounding in his ears that drowned out whatever else Coulson might be saying.  Steve was going to heal. Steve was going to be okay.  It was real.  Things could be real again.  He could let the world be real again.
When the doors opened, Tony stepped in the elevator behind Steve, bumping slightly into the broad expanse of his back and drawing in a long breath.  It felt so good to be home with Steve, in his own space, but with Steve there now, making it somehow more his, because now everything that belonged here was here, filling whatever empty space that had been waiting for Steve.  It felt good to be able to be this near him again.  He really needed to order some kind of loveseat or large chair for the SHIELD conference room.  That whole separate seating arrangement was clearly not going to work out.
Nothing made sense.
“I want to,” Steve rasped out after a pause that Tony counted by heartbeats.  “I do.  I don’t know why it’s so hard.  I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
Oh, God, he was going to fuck up the stew.
He saw Peggy turn to look at the tree, while Howard and Daniel churned through the rising fear of the spread of communism and how Carter had bungled the hostage crisis.  She got up and walked over to tug at one of the ornaments, a chubby, cloth Santa with a brown, felt bag that Steve remembered seeing hanging on bough next to a light-up Thor.  When she looked back at the group, Steve thought Peggy might be making the same realization. They weren’t the same people, not anymore, and whatever had bound them together during and after the war, the thread had stretched thin a long time ago.  The thing that bound them now was Tony, and even there, a fissure had opened up, bright and clear like a wound.
“Thank God,” Tony muttered. By the time they landed next to the house, Tony was practically bouncing to get out of his seat and get Steve inside, almost like he was the inverse of Steve, who seemed to be getting progressively calmer with each passing moment. There was a languid sort of sluggishness to Steve’s movements that was new, like everything took a great deal of effort. Bruce would probably explain the effects of the Heat and need to conserve resources or something, but it was incredibly appealing, Tony thought, watching Steve stand as if the movement took too much energy.
“You’re really going to throw this all away because of this…this…” Stane started.
“I--” Steve started, still too stunned to say much of anything.  Tony ordered fishing gear? And...crickets.  A lot of crickets, apparently, Steve grinned.  He could feel his chest swelling, buoyant and bright and
“It’s fine, Tony. Really.  Go make the world’s best baby carrier,” Steve chuckled, scrubbing a hand over his face.
He wasn’t a good person.  Not good enough to do that, anyway.   He wasn’t sure he even knew what it meant to be a good person anymore, not here, not now, when everything he did or said seemed to be wrong, and God, there was so much scrutiny, all the time, everyone watching, waiting, something edging at the corners of their minds telling them to watch out.  Stay away. Something’s
Scintillating, Tony thought a few minutes later, forgetting and trying to lean back in the chair, only to be fucked over by physics once more.  He got a long look from the professor down front, who was clearly gearing up for his next round of Buellers or whatever it was he was going on about, but ignored it.
Tony closed the door in his face.
“Jane will slay them all with her science, have no doubt,” Thor pronounced, placing a light kiss on the top of her head.
“We tried just shutting it off, and he nearly went into cardiac arrest. There are fail-safes built into the BARF system to avoid just that,
He missed JARVIS. He missed Rhodey and Pepper.  It was dark out here. Dark and lonely and empty.  Dying was one thing. And he knew he was dying, though the thought was distant somehow, like a memory, almost. Being alone was one thing. But, dying alone?  He blew out a huff of air that left his chest straining and opened his eyes. He didn’t want to die alone. Fate seemed to have other plans than to give him what he wanted, though.  Didn’t she always?
Well, nothing except that he was not in the suit.  And not in space. That was...very wrong.
“He’s out,” Steve said, looking back over his shoulder at Tony.
“You do have ideas, though,” Steve reiterated.
“I am what my people call a Giver.  We must share the Gift with our mate,” the alien said.  “Mate is life.”
“Once all this is over, what?” Steve pressed.
“Your things will be brought up shortly,” Master Eram informed them.  “Should you need anything further, you’ve only to ask. I have never had the honor of serving the King’s own before.  It is a rare thing, at least these days. As a young girl, my predecessor served the Raj’Inama to the King’s great-grandfather.  Though, that did not end particularly well, I suppose,” he finished with a shrug.
“Why did you sign that thing?” Tony demanded. “Did you have
Chapter 14
“I should go back to my rooms,” Steve said, pushing himself up to a sit and letting his legs hang off the side of the bed.  “Get ready.  Cam will be waiting, and he will have food there.  I think he delights in seeing what he can convince the kitchen to make for him.   You should see how excited he is,” Steve told him with a wry grin.  “Truly, Tony, I am fine.”
“I like the things you say,” Steve said.
“Ready?” Tony asked. Steve nodded, and followed Tony out into the hall, where Josiah and Peran joined them, along with Cam, who was nearly skipping behind them in his excitement.
.  Not that you’re, ah.  Struggling.  I’m glad I’m here, and, you know, can maybe help,” Tony offered.  “Coulson said.  He said maybe I was helping.”
“Yeah, it’s okay,” Tony said gently, cupping his hands on the sides of Steve’s face. “I got you, babe,” Tony vowed, voice soft and rough.  His lips were red and glistening and Steve had a surge of possessive pleasure at the thought that it was because of him.  “Going to make this so good for you.  So very, very good, I swear,” Tony promised, hands still running up and down over Steve’s chest in a soothing motion.  He hadn’t realized he was still trembling, but he just watched Tony, trusting him to handle things because Steve couldn’t have managed to raise so much as a protest if Loki himself had waltzed into the room.  Tony had some kind of tube in his hand and was asking Steve again if he was sure, and Steve had a moment to wonder about Tony’s mental acuity because if the man didn’t touch him again he was probably going to come undone.
do that.
“Not Director anymore, as you well know,” Peggy said, giving Stane a pasted-on smile.  “Good to see you again, Obadiah.  You remember my husband, Daniel?”
“Cheater,” Tony accused lightly, then let his head fall back and his eyes close.
On Stark’s screen, Steve saw Brock make a face down at his phone screen, then look around in confusion. Good, Steve thought with a sense of vicious satisfaction.
And if he sometimes thought of Anthony, well, that really wasn’t so strange, was it?  Alphas fantasized about Omegas all the time, he told himself, remembering the stack of pictures one of the GIs had picked up in Paris that had been traded around until the edges were worn down, doe-eyed Omegas in scraps of silk and lace, draped in pearls and little else.  It wasn’t unusual, an Alpha’s thoughts straying to an Omega from time to time.  No one had to know.
“That sounds entirely too sensible for you, my soldier, and almost like an admission that I was right,” Tony replied, “though you were a long time in coming to it.”
Finally, Tony drew back and moved off his crouch.  Steve heard the familiar rustle of fabric as Tony shoved his breeches down and freed his cock.  Steve glanced over his shoulder long enough to see it rising up towards Tony’s belly, thick and red and dripping small, clear droplets of fluid.  Tony grabbed the metal cock and ran his hand up and down over it, pooling the remainder of the oil, then slathered it onto his own cock.  He put a knee on the bed, spread Steve apart again, and rammed in, seating himself fully with a grunt.
“Awww, you named them.  I like Day best.  He has stripes,” Tony replied.  Steve rolled his eyes and went back to what Tony assumed was naming fish in his head or whatever it was he was thinking about while not listening to Obie and Howard.
“I remember you told me it never worked.  But it did, didn’t?  It did.  No wonder you hated me.  All those years.  How that had to have killed you.  The one thing you were supposed to be better at that everyone else,” Tony said.  A man who could only be the most amazing person on the whole planet if he lived by himself, Tony thought.  “And you weren’t even better than your Omega son.”
“Wh—wait, what?” Tony stammered.  He reached out a hand, for Coulson, for the wall, for something, coming up with empty air.  “Bullets?  Like, plural?  Bullets in him?  He’s okay though?  You said—you said he’s going to—God, Coulson, bullets?”  Tony winced, sucking in a breath and shaking his head.
“They’ll go to war, won’t they?” Steve asked, his voice heavy.
Steve, on the other hand, treated Tony’s orgasm like the brass ring, and he wasn’t leaving the playing field until he had it.  Sometimes, more than once.  He liked for Tony to come first, to give him that extra gush of slick, just before Steve filled him, and it did help with the knotting, sure, but Tony thought Steve mostly just liked the feel of it around his cock. Tony all wet and loose and open like that.  That’s what Steve would whisper into his ear while he fucked into him, Tony thought, reaching up and brushing at the spot just below his earlobe where he could almost feel the lingering heat of Steve’s breath as he spoke those filthy, obscene, wonderful things into Tony’s ear.  America would be so ashamed of their Captain, Tony thought with a serene smile as he traced his fingers up and down over his stomach.  Such a dirty mouth on the man.
“I know,” Steve responded resolutely.  “I will.  I am.  Just…not tonight.”  Ok, that sounded lame even to his ears.
“It’s just a flesh wound,” Steve replied, trying for a smile, though he was pretty sure he missed the mark by the knowing look on Tony’s face.
Steve frowned in confusion, then looked down at his hand.  As soon as he did, it started to hurt, though he had forgotten about it until that point.  Tony lifted it up and examined it, then got up and rummaged around in one of the trunks. When he came back, he had a bowl of water, some cloths and a small jar of ointment.  He washed Steve’s hand until the blood was gone and the wounds clean, then applied some of the ointment, which smelled a little like vinegar, and wrapped the wounds in thick, cotton strips.   Tony’s ministrations were strangely soothing, Steve thought, as he watched with a sort of detached interest. Exhaustion seeped into his bones. He blinked up at Tony, who smoothed his hair back once again and nudged him down onto the bed.
“Bruce is back,” Natasha said, nodding her head to the man slowing sitting up.  “Don’t ask,” she told him, as Bruce held up his watermelon-coated hands.
“Brock,” Steve said, shaking his head.  “No, I didn’t mean, I--”
“I’m glad,” Steve told him.
“Then, you changed your mind,” Tony said softly, looking down at his feet as they walked and adjust his sunglasses when the slipped down his nose.  He didn’t like thinking about Afghanistan, much less talking about it, and yet, he seemed to keep falling down that particular rabbit hole with Steve.  Shared life experience, he supposed.
He had definitely gotten himself turned around somehow.
“I’ll listen to you,” Steve replied.  “I’m not saying the rest of the world is going to bend its ear quite so easily, but, you might be surprised.   The military likes things that work.  They have to constantly innovate, because as soon as they put out a new technology, the other guys are figuring out ways to copy it and beat it.  Show them what you can do is better.  Not a little better.  A
Steve wasn’t blind to the reason for his sudden surge of inspiration. Tony was a force of nature, sweeping them all along.  Maybe he always had been. Maybe that was one of the things that had attracted Steve so much from the get-go, if he was honest with himself.  He knew he could stagnate, dig himself in and become so entrenched in what he was doing that he couldn’t see he had long since stopped actually moving forward.  Bucky said it was stubbornness. Sam said feeling stuck and being unable to let go of the past was a textbook sign of PTSD. Frankly, he liked Bucky’s interpretation better, but whatever it was, it lessened around Tony.  It didn’t disappear. But, it was easier to see. Maybe it was the contrast, Steve thought with a mental huff, but just being able to see it helped loosen its hold somehow, like whatever grip it had on him gave, just a bit, and he could move again.
His mind had time to think,
There was Caltech, though, Steve remembered with a start.  Caltech was closer.  A lot closer. One of the SHIELD techs down in R&D sometimes wore a Caltech shirt.  Steve could ask for some ideas, he supposed.  Agent Paz, that’s who it was.  He could ask Paz about what Caltech might have to offer, who to talk to, that kind of thing.  Maybe...maybe Tony would think that was okay?  A quick trip there? It had an astronomy department that was quite well-regarded, Steve read as he searched the school’s website.  Tony loved his stars.  Maybe he would like that? He would have to ask Coulson about arranging a visit.
“I’m going out on a limb here and saying ‘not well,’” Tony remarked.
“You’re the boss,” Tony replied, though for once it didn’t sound teasing, just tired, Steve noticed.
, Tony told him.
“False pretenses,” Kirk filled in helpfully.  “Fancy way of saying you lied, Michelangelo.”
It was all so surreal, Steve thought when they were somewhere over Lake Mead.  They’d made small talk most of the way back. Easy enough, like at dinner, but there was an undercurrent of tension between them now that hadn’t quite quickened until they left the Skywalk.
“Maybe, but it’s true,” Steve said.
For some reason, Cam’s words filtered through the haze in Steve’s brain.  He didn’t let himself thing about the impulse long enough to question it, just reached out and took Tony’s cock in his hand, giving it a long, slow stroke, following the path of Tony’s hand.  Tony went still, his eyes fluttering shut, and he breathed out a long, low sigh.
“Look at you,” Steve said, voice rough and hushed, like it was tinged with awe.  It sent a spike of something hot curling through Tony’s belly, filling him and making him feel empty at the same time.
“Good,” Steve said, smiling broadly.  He pressed his lips to Anto’s forehead. That was nice, Anto decided.  Not as nice as Steve’s signal, but nice. “Let’s go home.”
The hands that had been clutching at his tunic found their way into the hair at the nape of his neck, feather-light touches that were driving Steve mad.  He pushed his tongue into Tony’s mouth, mimicking Tony’s motions from earlier, thrusting and flicking, rolling his around Tony’s, sliding them gently against one another.  It was Tony who broke the kiss, pulling back and panting with wide, dark eyes that held Steve’s gaze.
“Close, but no cigar?” Tony quipped, walking over to drop on the long, brown leather sofa that sat in the middle of the office.
“Sir, at your maximum speed, it will take approximately twenty-two days--” JARVIS started.
He tried some from memory.  A poem his Ma used to recite sometimes.  Shellhead listened with rapt attention, then trilled loudly at the end, clearly surprised, but pleased, at this newfound ability of Steve’s.
“Steve—you're kidding me with this, right?” Tony protested incredulously. “I love you. I have loved you since I threw up on your shoes. What the hell are you talking about? You said we were okay! We screwed up, but...but that doesn't...we have the rest of our lives to figure this out. Come, come back to the Tower. Just, come with me. Rhodey's in the car outside, probably killing it on CandyCrush, feel free to mock him for the suburban mom named Ashley we all know lives deep inside him. This—this is a lot to process. I get that. But, just. Just, come with me. We'll talk it out. We'll...we'll figure it out. Just. Just come with me.”
They broke apart, and Tony stretched over to reach the bowl of oil warming over a candle that Steve now noticed was on the bedside table.  He slathered a good portion the oil over his hands.  Steve swallowed.  Sucked in a breath.  Tony canted his head to look at Steve, then slowly, deliberately, with his eyes locked on Steve’s, rubbed an oiled hand up and down his own cock until it was coated so liberally as to be dripping.
Tony swallowed, or tried to.  It got lodged somewhere behind his tongue and he had to force it down.  What had they done?  SHIELD and Fury and Coulson…God, what had they done?  Given someone like Tony to Captain America to…to
Steve held the door open with one hand and let Tony out, holding the box with his dessert in the other.  “So, you think I’ll be meeting the famous Ms. Potts?” Steve asked.  “That’s not…awkward for you?”
“A man named James Buchanan Barnes killed your parents.  He was a prisoner of war. For decades. Brainwashed by a group called Hydra, and then the Soviet Union.  They ordered the hit. He didn’t know what he was doing. But, it was him. Not Howard’s drinking. Not…whatever you thought it was,” Steve said, surprised at how easy it was to say.   He supposed it didn’t really matter now. He couldn’t mess this up worse than he had the first time. At least, he didn’t think so. Tony was staring at him, eyes wide, mouth forming an ‘O’. “He’s a good man, Tony.  He would never have done that in his right mind. I’m sorry I’m telling you now, like this.  I owe you both better. I hope you can find a way to forgive him.”
“I mean, I made me fly.  From scraps in a cave in Afghanistan, so if I wanted to build a flying car, which I don’t because that is totally stupid and impractical, then the damn thing would work.  It would be awesome, actually, and you know I designed the QuinJet that actually flies quite well, right?” Tony went on.  He was on a roll now.  Steve leaned back on the sofa and just enjoyed the spectacle.
“Reasons hanging out with his platonic ride-or-die for the day?” Rhodey asked.
“Glad you approve,” Tony replied, then finished buttoning his shirt, though he looked up from his handiwork in time to catch Steve’s eyes following his hands, and raised a speculative eyebrow.  “Shall we?” he asked, sweeping his hand out towards the bedroom door. Steve nodded and let Tony ease by him, then followed him towards the elevator.  “Sure your friend will be okay by himself?  I can see if Rhodey can come babysit.”
“Now,” the holy man said. “Rise together.  As one.  From this day forward.”
“Because… Tony, you’re--you’re
Malcolm and Dominic were looking back and forth between each other and Steve and Tony, torn between confusion, hope and terror.
Tony whistled sharply, and Dummy gave a final snarl, then trotted over to his side. The man stared, eyes wide, his axe hanging midswing.
He slept.  His dreams were of smoke and ash and a battlefield so deep in bodies, it was like stepping in snow and rivers of blood ran like veins across the white earth.
“I know, and I know you have been dreading this leaving in a way.   I, as well, in a way not so different than you, I expect,” Tony said.  He leaned down and held Steve’s gaze. “I like our life there, too, you know? It is easy, in our insular, little world at the Castle.  Having to parade around in front of those who would judge themselves your better. Easy to forget the rest of the world exists. Leaving…it means facing that it does.  It means facing a lot of things that I would far prefer to shield you from, but I cannot keep you locked away there forever, nor do I want to. That is no life. And you deserve as wonderful a life as I can make for you.  I promised you this,” he added, his hand coming to clasp Steve’s where he was clutching Tony’s chest. Tony traced the pad of his finger over the ring with his sigil that Steve wore. “I keep my promises,” he said, gaze going hard for a moment.  “All of them.”
“The 915 in front of us, big tractor truck thing, it lost part of its ammo load on the road.  Everyone just keeps driving through the pile, though, ‘cause we can’t stop.  But, apparently, the truck in front of us picked some up, and it got caught in the tire tread.  About ten miles down the road, damn thing starts spewing tracer fire back at us,” Steve recounted.  “We’re tryin’ to radio them, and they think we’re pulling one, you know?  Tell us to lay off.  Meanwhile, Buck’s up in the turret cursing their grandmothers, and Clint starts shouting that he’s not going to be taken out because of a damned Tonka with a poor attitude.  And that’s the time we got shot at by a truck,” Steve finished with a firm nod.  “Ammo guy back at the base said no way, but I swear, that’s what happened.”
“Tony,” Steve breathed out, voice cracking on the end.
“Is it? Maybe it is.  Help me see why. Help me make it better for the people in my care.  I’m trying here, Steve,” Tony continued, his voice tight with a calmness he seemed to marshal by force of will.  “As much as I dare, what with Obie whispering in the nobles’ ears about your influence over me. The Ettan Emissary has asked for us to participate in the patrols--what do you think is in those letters waiting for me over there that I’ve been delaying responding to?  I’ll refuse, for now, under the auspices of our navy’s obligation to protect the Guild ships, but do you truly not see how tenuous things are now? It’s a start.
“I noticed,” Tony replied, one corner of his mouth tugging up.  Steve had the vaguely uncomfortable sensation that Tony noticed a lot, though he seemed to filter those observations through whatever thought process required them to be broken apart into their pieces and put together in some pattern Steve didn’t quite understand yet.  Like the aborted attempt at touching him out on the balcony.  Tony hadn’t come within a two feet of him since then, even now, in the confined space of the elevator, standing as far away as he could.  But, he’d
Steve wasn’t sure when he had given up on some attempt at decency.  He knew he should avert his gaze, but he couldn’t look away.  It was all too much.  Too much input, too much to see, too much to take in, too much to feel.  He was rock hard and leaking all over the front of his pants, or at least it felt that way.  He had no idea how much of what he was feeling was real and how much was this dreamscape messing with his mind.  Still, he couldn’t stop looking.  He could admit, at least to himself, that he didn’t really want to.  These Steves, they got to have this with Tony. Something he would never get to have.  He should look away, but it seemed impossible to actually do so.  Instead, he stared, transfixed, as the other version of him circled Tony’s hole with his tongue, then flicked against it, up, down, side to side, then finally, delved in, licking deep.
“One week,” Rhodey corrected.
“Thanks, you too,” Steve replied, smiling a bit and trying to sound nonchalant as  ‘You’re beautiful’ was probably not the appropriate observation amongst friends.
“O—oh,” Tony said, the air suddenly punched out of his lungs.  Behind him, he heard the skid of a car and the slam of a door as bright, whirling colored lights flooded the street.   He grinned up at Steve.  “I knew I recognized that ass,” he said with a smirk.
“Right. Sure.  You and Peggy Carter are here to steal plans—”
“Right, helpmate. Whatever that is.  Sure. So, yeah. Speaking of the whole weird mental mojo we’re having here…” Tony trailed off in a question.  “Does this have some kind of expiration date on it or am I going to be playing alien Pictionary for the foreseeable future?”
Coulson gave Tony a long look, then nodded once.  “He’s better, Tony,” Coulson replied.
“Outstanding,” Tony grinned, shucking off his shirt.
“Okay, well.  Let’s all just take a breath, maybe. That was—wow, okay,” Stane started, holding his hands out in front of him in a placating gesture.
In a few minutes, Bucky was going to come through the tent flap and give him hell, Steve had little doubt. News traveled fast in the camp, and news of the royal kind was the swiftest sort. Bucky would know Steve had received yet another message. It was, by now, a familiar enough refrain, but Tony’s latest letter would give Bucky’s arguments renewed vigor.
“That’s…okay, well, you know, it’s perfectly reasonable that I, as your benefactor and tech support, would have that signal on my phone as well,” Tony argued flatly.
Yet, Jhrvis had insisted that the Stranger must be helped. That he had seen this man in one of his Visions, placed in their path by the Great Bear herself, and here he was, marked by the Clan’s totem, so there could be no mistake.
Cam, Steve thought, was many things, but stupid was not one of them. Steve sighed, trying to ignore the way his heart seemed to skip beats at Cam’s casual mention of Tony’s heirs. Heirs who must, of course, come one day, and should not matter to Steve. Though when he thought of them now, which he tried not to do instead of shadowed, faceless shapes hovering in some unseen future, he just saw Tony holding Peter on his knee, bouncing him up and down while the baby gurgled and favored his King’s attention by spitting up on him, not that Tony seemed to mind.
Based on a prompt from a Tumblr Anon, it's 2am and Tony drunk dials his ex.  He gets Captain America instead.
Thanks to everyone who has been so excited and supportive of this 'verse and this fic.  I can't tell you how much it means to me.  I really wanted to show how Steve gets to the point of making the decision to Bond with Tony, and why, which is what this chapter is about.  Don't worry, Tony actually shows up next chapter, I swear.
“Thanks,” Tony replied. He felt Steve come up behind him, warmth radiating off him and into Tony’s skin, chasing almost everything else away, the way it always did.  Running didn’t have to mean running away.  It could mean running
Screens were for read-outs.  Displaying results. Diagnostics. Tests.
Slowly, Tony lowered his hands. He swallowed hard, his throat bobbing with the effort, and glanced away, blinking up at the ceiling.
“Baby,” Steve repeated, a heavy sigh in his voice.
“Really?  My hair?” Tony asked, raising an eyebrow in question.  “That does it for you, huh?”
-- “growing up. It’s fun for me, too, all this...this stuff you think I should know about,” Steve finished. “Thanks, Tony.  You don’t have to, but...I appreciate it.”
“Close your eyes,” Tony said.  “Good,” Tony praised when Steve did.  “Now, open your mouth for me.” That, Steve thought, was always a good command, and he grinned before letting his mouth fall open, earning a soft chuckle from Tony.  “Good,” Tony said again, then slipped his fingers between Steve’s lips.
“Anyone ever tell you that you have a very skewed view of relationships?” Steve asked.
“Icanstand,” Steve said, or thought he did.  The words sounded slurry and garbled, even to his own ears.  Tony smiled indulgently at him, got up and returned with a large cotton towel, which he tossed over one of his arms.
“Someone should,” Tony replied.
Stark tilted his head slightly, regarding Steve from behind a cagey look, then glanced over at Brock.  “Quite the contrary. We were just having a bit of a philosophical debate.”
“Is that—is that what he did?” Steve asked. His voice was soft, careful, almost sad.  Anto nodded, then looked away.
“An issue?” the small man repeated with a raised eyebrow.
And yet, how many times had Steve found himself looking next to him, opening his mouth to voice thoughts he couldn’t share with his men or just wishing for the sureness that came with Tony’s presence? It was a selfish desire, to be sure, and he would never compromise Tony’s safety like that, but the empty space seemed to have pull sometimes, weight and form like he could feel it, seeping into him, hollowing him out. Having Tony here, so close to what they’d had those first few weeks when he hadn’t known who Tony really was, was appealing in ways he couldn’t quite put into words.
“No. You really can’t,” Tony replied as he took Steve’s hand.
“I tried, Sir,” Steve said.  “It wasn’t his fault, it just—”
That was…his eyes snapped back to where Tony sat seemingly rooted to his spot on the stool.
Strangely, it was the kiss, of all things, that was almost too intimate and made Steve want to turn away more than anything else.  This whole thing was an invasion of Tony’s privacy, but this was something more.  Something else.  Not just a fantasy, not exactly.  Something more.  He dropped his gaze and looked away.  He shouldn’t be here.  They’d have to figure something else out. There had to be another way.  Bruce and Cho, they were geniuses, they’d think of something.  Anything, but this.  He couldn’t do this.  He couldn’t.  He needed to get away.  Go.  Run. Be anywhere but here. He needed to—Tony’s hand shot down and grabbed for Steve’s, curling his fingers through Steve’s in a tight hold while he kissed the other Steve.
“It means you’re more alike than either of you want to admit.  It means that he’s going to give you the best chance to survive because he’s a good guy, and you’re his teammate. It means he’s going to joke with you and distract you and keep you warm for the same reason you keep finding things wrong with every apartment in Brooklyn he looks at, trying to build him things he might like and helping him find Barnes, even when he is probably literally the last person you want to welcome back into Steve’s life,” Natasha told him.
“His pulse is spiking,” Friday said.
Steve watching his fellow soldiers get blown up by Tony’s weapons.
Oh, and it was brought to my attention that maybe not everyone is as obsessed with Captain America: The Winter Soldier as I am, so FYI, Cameron Klein (Cam, here) is the Shield agent who refuses Rumlow's order.  So...that guy.
“Hey,” he heard Tony say from behind him and turned around in his seat.  Tony was leaning against the glass doors that opened onto the balcony, wearing one of his dark t-shirts with the name of some heavy metal band emblazoned across it and jeans, like he’d been working, though his feet were bare.
“Cool, cool, if it bothers you so much, no problem,” Brock replied, then paused and after a moment, smiled over at Steve.  “All I’m saying is, what would you do without me, huh?” he asked rhetorically, sending a teasing smile over at Steve as he nudged his arm against Steve’s shoulder.
“Air Force, huh?” Steve said with a slight grimace, taking the tablet from Tony’s outstretched hand.   “I guess we can meet with him when we visit the campus.”
“Yeah?” Tony said around a huff of what sounded like genuinely relieved laughter to Steve’s ears.
1--The Other (caveman Stony AU)
Steve glanced at him, his lips tugging up at the corners, his blue, stained-glass eyes bright.  “That is a gas giant,” he said in a flat voice.
“Yeah?” Steve rasped out, staring over the horizon beyond the deck, where Polaris glowed low in the sky.
Steve crashed forward, landing his weight on one arm next to Tony, and rolling them both to the side with a heave.  He pressed sloppy kisses to the back of Tony’s neck, mouthing at the top of Tony’s spine, while his hands caressed up and down Tony’s body.  Tony pushed his hips back, somewhat experimentally, and got an answering grunt for his efforts, as Steve’s cock shifted slightly deeper inside him, fully seated now.  A burgeoning pressure started filling Tony, deep inside, deeper than anything, pressing past his prostrate with a zinging rush of strung-out pleasure.  Steve’s knot.  His Alpha’s knot.
, just made do with, space-fillers with no meaning. He had enough of those to recognize them for what they were, though his were exponentially more expensive. He suspected he’d spent just as much time on selecting them, though.
“I chose your picture, you see,” she said in a soft voice that quavered a bit at the last.
“But, you always catch me,” Steve replied, then turned and grinned a bit.
“Sorry.  I’m—I didn’t—I didn’t mean that, Peg,” Howard said.  His gaze dropped to the floor, then raised up to look at her.  “You know I didn’t.  You know I didn’t, Peg.  I wanted to find him.  More than anything.  I tried.  I tried, Peggy, I did.  For you—for everything I did. The war. The bomb.  Hell, the God-damned cold launch that’s going to get Maria a new Mercedes, but
it.  And they needed Tony to build.
He tried to focus on those sounds, which had always soothed him, but no matter what he did, he couldn’t get to sleep, just ticked off how much time he had left before he had to wake up in the morning.  Finally, Steve pushed the blanket off and walked over to the window, tugging it open just enough to let the sounds fill the room.  He grabbed a pillow from a nearby chair and sat down on top of it, staring out into the night.
“You’re not on the guest pass list today. I’ll have to call it in to my CO,” the guard told him with a frown.
“Please tell Room Six thank you. Again,” Steve said to the man at the desk as he signed himself out. The man barely looked up from his phone where he was scrolling through some website so fast that Steve could only catch a few words of headlines blaring across the screen.
Underwear Model stared back at Tony, blue eyes wide and mouth hanging open, which was actually a good look on him, unfair though that was. “Oh my God!” the man said in surprised horror, then promptly shut the door in Tony’s face.
“God, Rhodey, this sucks,” Tony spat out, voice high and quaking, almost a laugh, then closed his eyes.
“Yes,” the alien’s eyes snapped to his.  “Yes, that is the closest word. Complete.  Sharing the Gift is to be complete. Whole. One. Together.”
“Kiss me,” Tony breathed out.  No artifice this time, just a demand, or a plea, Steve wasn’t sure which.
Tony reached out and lightly traced a finger down Steve’s check and under his jaw, tipping Steve’s chin up and holding him there, eyes locked on Steve’s face.
“Fair point,” Rhodey agreed, nodding his head.  “So, what now?”
He was going to throw up.
“---and then, I come ‘round the corner, and there he is getting the shit kicked out of him by some Neanderthal three times his size soaking wet, and the obnoxious little shit has the gall to say “I could do this all day,” while literally wiping blood off his face with the shirt I know his momma got him for Church, and damn if I—oh, you have got to be kidding me,” Barnes broke off as he nearly skidded to a halt as he came around the top of the staircase to face Tony and Rhodey.
Howard was leaning one hip against the billiards table, polishing a pool cue while a half-empty tumbler sat next to him.  His jacket was slung across one of the chairs and his shirt sleeves were rolled up.  Casual. The kind that’s supposed to look effortless.  The pool balls were scattered across the table, with the seven and twelve visible in one of the net pockets at the corner.  Obie was sitting in one of the rounded leather barrel chairs, a glass of Scotch, neat, in one hand and a cigar in the other.
“He’s a good boy,” Steve said, smiling in return.  “He tries to be good,” Steve amended.
He’d leaned back and crossed his legs, one arm hanging nonchalantly over the back of the chair, all carefree, easy grace, the kind that Steve still envied sometimes, when he wouldn’t quite know what to do with this body of his when he was at rest.  In a fight, in motion, sure, it was practically muscle memory now, but sitting like this, he kept wanting to fidget, shift in his chair, or cross his legs, but he kept bumping the table with his knee each time he tried, making the silverware clank against the tabletop.
“I… I couldn’t keep it, Tony.  I couldn’t.  It didn’t feel right, and, well.  I just couldn’t,” Steve told him with a slight sigh.
“I got a look at
Ten bucks said Rhodey got him the shirt.
“Come on, you gotta play.  You’re like the guest of honor or… whatever,” Mitchell added, huffing out a small laugh like he’d made some kind of joke.
We look like them, Tony realized.  We look happy.  Fake it ‘til you make it.  Was he faking? Had he been faking?  He didn’t know anymore.  Tick-tock, his mind supplied.
First, wow, thank you all for the lovely comments and for taking the time to leave those and click the kudos button.  I really appreciate it. That's really the only way I know if you've been entertained by any of this, so I can't thank you enough for being so generous.  It really helps keep the motivation going.
, Steve typed back.
“I’m not against weapons.  And I have a soft spot for soldiers, let’s say.  Hard spot?  Eh.  Whatever,” Tony teased, pulling a face.  “You think that was the first time they tried them out?  Of course not.  My little desert fun ride wasn’t some kind of test run.  They’d used them before.  Against our soldiers or innocent civilians or both.  Someone was double dealing on my watch, and that’s on me.  But, we should—God—“ Tony broke off, running his hand over his mouth.  “Talk about something else.  Like, say, what you’re doing in Vegas in the first place.  Pretty far from Brooklyn.  You and your…slurpie-enabling roommate.”
“Yep,” Matt replied.  “Don’t worry.  Let me do the talking.  You two,” he continued, pointing at Steve and Tony.  “Look like a couple who are deeply concerned about their mutual friend.  You, try to look less like you want to murder the review board.  Smile a little.”
“I’m supposed to do what’s best for you,” Steve continued.  “I’m supposed to take care of you.  If you think this Simpson is better for you, then…he’s got my vote, too.”
He realized for the first time that he was on his knees, looking up at the window of glass that separated his quarters from the conference room where various doctors and military personnel came to ask him the same inane question over and over again.  He could hear shouting, though it took a moment for the shouts to start to form words.  He should be more concerned, he knew.  It felt..odd…that he wasn’t.  Not bad-odd, he decided.  More like just something worth noting.  But, he wasn’t worried about the shouting or his lack of reaction, not really.  He wasn’t because…because…his mind searched for the right words…because…
He stopped, shock coursing through him.  He spun around.  He had been...he was just over there, and now he was here, and--
“No disrespect intended, of course,” the Ul said smoothly. That, Steve thought, was definitely a lie. Tony thought the same, by the frown that marred his face for a moment.
“I think my sticky note warned you about bad-touching George,” Barnes replied.
“Why don’t we go back up on the shore?” Tony suggested.
Rhodey ignored him, though did lower his weapon when…the redheaded bouncer from the club where Steve worked rushed into the room, followed by another man sporting a…bow and arrow who brushed past everyone and went to Obie’s side.  Okay, maybe Steve and Rhodey were right, and Tony
“Would it help if I rubbed it?” Tony asked, to which Steve responded by doubling over with laughter.  “Wow.  I honestly completely missed that one.  I was concerned.  Your hand and the cold and--dammit, Rogers, quit laughing!  I was trying to be thoughtful.  No, wait, don’t.  It’s a good look on you.”
“Thanks, Uncle Obie,” Tony said, taking the present and settling it in his lap.
Steve looked between Tony and Barnes, then back down at his lap, where Tony’s hand still covered his.  Tony felt Steve’s hand relax and shift to curl long fingers—artist’s hands, Tony thought, with a flash of memory—through Tony’s.
“Nah, I’d better head back.  You should get some rest, and I’ve got more to go over before the presentation tomorrow. Leave it,” Tony said, when Steve started to clean up the dishes.  “They’ll come by tomorrow and pick everything up.”
“Why can’t I find someone to buy a company and then shut it down to keep me in bed with them all day?” Clint asked plaintively.
“Jason Bourne?” Steve asked finally.
“I don’t know,” Steve replied. “As you said, it is a long way into the future before the King could contemplate making such a journey. And the situation is… complicated. I don’t even know if they would allow the visit, to tell you the truth.”
“I’m still sorry,” Tony mumbled.  Steve huffed out a low laugh and tightened his arms.
“If you don’t mind me saying so, Ma’am, I learned a long time ago that trying to do the right thing usually ends up a mess.  But not trying ends up with something far worse,” Steve said, gaze flicking over Tony almost hesitantly.
had certainly not worked out like Obie had expected.
“What will you teach Steve?” Cam asked.  All innocence, the little bastard, Steve thought with no small degree of amazement at the boy’s brashness, apparently having decided to take Steve’s word that the King was good, or, more likely, having been convinced by tarts and chess.
Steve kissed him then, surging forward and cupping Tony’s face in his hands, their feet tangling until Tony’s back hit the stairwell wall and Steve got a hand braced by his head.  Steve caught the last of Tony’s plea on his tongue, and then Tony melted against him, clawing at his shirt, his shoulders, winding his hands up into Steve’s hair with a muffled groan.
“Tony, it wasn’t—“ Steve cut in with an air of resigned desperation.
Tony’s eyes fell shut as the doors closed. It seemed to signal an end.  Not seemed to, really, if he was honest with himself and not delusional, that is.  It wasn’t like Steve bolting out of here with barely a backwards glance or any promise to return was exactly subtle.
This is a Thank You fic for the prompt time travel based on an idea from nostalgicatsea.  Thank you!
“Steve,” Tony called out, reaching out a hand to place a waylaying hand on Steve's arm.
Ain’t life grand?  Oh, maybe there were others, but they sure as hell didn’t talk about it.  Who the fuck in their right mind would admit that?
“Does it?” Jarvis replied in an exaggeration of shock.  “Terribly sorry.  My mistake.  Here, this is the correct one.  Keep that on hand, though. You never know.”
He couldn’t go on.  He knew that. It was too risky, for both of them.  He had already asked more than enough of Shellhead, more than anyone should rightly give.  He couldn’t ask him to risk his own life trying to protect Steve from what was lining up to be a fool’s errand.  Tomorrow, Steve told himself. Tomorrow, they would turn back. Maybe they could try again one day. When he accumulated more stores of water.   Maybe. It was hard to remember why leaving was so important now, when he was alone at night with nothing but his traitorous thoughts and Shellhead.  Maybe there was some other island out here that would provide shelter and maybe even fresh water. You sure have a lot of maybes at night, Rogers, Steve thought to himself.  Nights were good for that, though, he thought. Possibilities, dreams, they belonged in the night, didn’t they? Didn’t hurt any to think on them, even if Steve knew they were ultimately impossible.  He was, in all likelihood, going to die of thirst on that island, but for a while, anyway, he could lay here and think other, better thoughts.
Steve frowned at Tony, unsure what to say in the face of what felt a lot like an attack, despite Tony’s casual tone. “Morning everyone,” Steve offered, nodding his head towards them.  “Hope I’m not intruding,” he said, returning Tony’s glare with a stone-faced one of his own, because, really, enough was enough.  Tony finally looked away, glancing down at the table as if the basket of mini-muffins held endless fascination, and Steve counted it a bit of a victory that he hadn’t simply run out of the room by this point.  He nodded a goodbye to the team and did his best not to run down the hall to his room, shutting his door with the care required to make it attempt to sound casual as he heard a kitchen chair slam against the table and footfalls echo out of the kitchen and up the stairs, disappearing to what could only be Tony’s penthouse.  Tony apparently had no apparently had no such compunction about not telegraphing his anger as Steve’s ears picked up the sound of Tony’s door slamming rather forcefully from above.
“He could maybe stay some.  If he wanted to,” Steve said with a shrug, like it didn’t matter, except it mattered more than anything.
If he hit him, it would be immediately satisfying, true.  But, Tony was always more about the long game.
“No, Tony. God, no,” Steve said.  “I’m just sorry it took me so long to see it.  To see you.  I guess Nat got a little fed up, too.”
he flatters me,” Tony muttered, though his tone was light, and his eyes were crescents, soft and crinkled at the corners.  “Is this all it takes to loosen your tongue to compliments? I must admit, if so, I would say that I’ve never been more committed to being showered in praise in my life,” he said, brows rising as the corners of his lips tugged up into a smile.
“Well. Thanks for the science lesson+, Tony.  That was...clarifying.  So, ah, did you—if you’re done—did you want to watch a movie?  Or, if you’re tired, maybe some other time,” Steve offered.
“Wait, what?” Tony stumbled over his words, looking up and down the street like the crosswalk sign would suddenly turn Rosetta Stone. “What are you—what do you mean?”
“I know, I know.  Epic art school fail.  Bye-bye scholarship.  Your dream of drawing on the chalkboard at your local Starbucks will be crushed,” Kirk said with a dramatic sigh.
“The King is not the only one who can be generous, Raj’Inama.  I’ve been careful.  That one asks for silks and pretty clothes.  Perfumes.
“Just wanted to help people, I guess,” Steve repeated the familiar answer.  Stark snorted and waved the hand holding the piece of bread in front of his face, like he was batting away the words.
It was fireworks, bursting in Tony’s chest, a molten coil straight down to his groin.  It was slow-dancing on the roof without any music, the languid wake of morning when the bed is still warm, the first rise over the top of the coaster when the clacks just start picking up speed, the last piece of an equation after the equal sign, the eureka moment when something worked, the way the sun breaks across the sky when you’ve stayed up all night to wait for dawn.
“But, it isn’t really different than any other tool SI’s been providing the military for all those years, is it? I mean, look at all the resources that we’ve put into recapturing the Mosul Dam and getting it remotely structurally sound.  When the rebels had it, they used rolling blackouts of up to twenty hours a day to try to shunt enough electricity off to refill the reservoir.  Do you have any idea how many problems that caused?” Steve asked.  “Putting aside all the actual conflicts over access to water and resources that you could mitigate, imagine how much that lack of infrastructure sets back the region?  Sets up a world ripe for conflict?” Steve pressed, shifting in his seat to face Tony.  “Look, do you have any idea how dangerous it is getting those convoys of fuel into Afghanistan?  Forget the cost savings over the long haul, good men are dying, and SI is still building typewriters.  The military needs this kind of shiny new toy more than it needs another missile.  We’re doing pretty good blowing things up, trust me.”
Coulson turned his body in the seat enough to look at Tony with a flat, serious expression that was almost…sad, was Tony’s first thought, though that didn’t seem quite right.  Regretful, maybe.  Hard to be sure with Agent Blank Stare, here.  “Captain Rogers is…he’s very important.  To a lot of people.  To this country.  To what we are trying to do here.  We…we all owe him a great debt,” Coulson told him, picking at the words like bowstrings, as if he expected Tony to pick up on the reverberations.
“Forget it,” Brock said after a moment, grimacing flatly and waving a hand in the air.  “I’m just… you know.  Ready to blow this town, is all.  This whole place is a fucking cess pool anyway.  Leave it to people like Stark, right?”
“Yeah,” Tony replied dully, dropping his hand from Steve's arm and pivoting away, putting the desk, the space, the everything between them again. “Fine. It's fine. No problem.”
“I know.  It wasn’t your fault, though, Buck.  None of it, okay?” Steve said against Bucky’s shoulders as the other man clung to him and gave him a good shake before releasing him and stepping back.  “You gotta stop blaming yourself.”
“Stupid love,” Kadina interjected.  “Lord Stone. Hmph.  He was Sir Tiberius, until King Anthony raised him up, and granted him a title and the lands to go with it.   Oh, he was all pretty words and gallantry to our King, tipping his lance at the tourney and carrying the King’s favor under his armor, strutting around the Castle like one of those fancy birds in the King’s garden while he warmed the King’s bed and fed him sweet lies.  Everyone knew, of course, except the King.  Stone is nothing if not a braggart, believe me.  It was all a great scandal when Lord Stone left.”
“Lack of self-preservation skills,” Steve supplied, working his hands through the suds down Tony’s back.
“Mine,” Steve growled.  The grinding rip of a zipper filled Tony’s head, and then Steve was slamming his cock into Tony’s eager hole, burying himself to the hilt.  Tony gasped.  His back arched.  He threw his head back and let out a howl, then collapsed his chest flush to the bed and closed his eyes. Tried to remember how to breath.
“Your route was classified.  Highest levels.  In fact, there were three routes, standard procedure.  Things change on the ground so fast, you need options.  No one knows until the go-route until the last minute.  It was one of the reasons it took so long to get out there.  We couldn’t get confidence on your last position.  So, if the decision wasn’t made until you were about to head out, how’d the Ten Rings know exactly where to be to hit the convoy?” Steve asked, shaking his head in obvious agitation.
“Perhaps,” Rhodey acknowledged, albeit grudgingly.  “But it is an illusion that has stood against the wheel of time without faltering, my friend, and this,” he stopped, shook his head and let out a huff of air through his nose, “this world you seek, this ideal you want to believe in…what I’m trying to say is that it is good for Tony to have that, too, and not just the whispers of what must be.  All kings must be realists, if they are to last. But, you’re good for him.  I’ve seen it.  In the Council chambers, in Court, talking through things with him since you’ve been here.  You give him something I don’t think any of us can give.”
You did.  You had General Rhodes put it in a box, Steve thought, though, he said nothing.
“My childhood demands that you tell me whether you’ve defiled the heroes on a halfshell,” Kirk said pointedly, looking down at where the turtles were striking various poses against the green background.
A small fire was banked in the hearth, next to which a large, flat stone held an anvil and round grinding stone suspended between two posts by its side.  A large, round table dominated the center of the room.  It was clearly meant to be a map table, with the miniature battlements and sculpted proxies for cavalry, infantry and other markers scattered across the table in between bits and pieces of coiled metal, small-toothed wheels and an array of other items that Steve could only guess at their use.
“What about him?” Rhodey asked, jerking his head towards Obie.
“What?” Tony blurted out distractedly.
The basics of the program already existed in a digital secretary app they used for remote meetings, luckily, which meant he could just cannibalize it a bit to do what he needed.  When he was satisfied, he typed out a quick message to Pepper and sat back to wait.  Twenty-five excruciating minutes that spanned 1915-1917 later, and there was finally a knock on the classroom door.
“We try,” Coulson responded.  “Tony, these are Agents Paz and Dupree.  They’re fresh from Sci-Tech, and working in our robotics division.  Captain Rogers thought that might be a good place for you to start.”
something—and he saw it last week when he went down to Cho’s lab and tried to make something that passed for small talk.
“I think blackjack is more my game tonight, but thanks,” Tony replied evenly.  He pointed at the table across the room, where a group of well-dressed people, some in uniform, were huddled around a table with cards in their hands.
“Funny. You’re funny,” Brock said. He swiped his napkin across his mouth and smiled indulgently at Steve.  “Look, this time tomorrow and we won’t be worrying about any of this, right? So, I’m thinking, we get a couple of cash advances on your cards. Go have fun. Before...you know,” Brock said, shrugging awkwardly.  “I mean, look,” he stopped, grimacing and looking away for a moment. “This isn’t easy for me, alright? Maybe I kind of want a distraction, you know? Something to get my mind off,” he waved his hand in the air.  “Everything.  ‘Cause it’s pretty much been you and me this past year, since your best friend’s been busy playing house husband or whatever, and it’s been a lot, not going to lie. Worth it, sure, but a lot of pressure on my shoulders, taking care of both of us, getting you back on your feet and all, and now there’s this way out, but I gotta be okay with what you’re gonna do, and it’s not exactly how I wanted this to go.”
“So I have been told,” Tony replied tightly.
“Mr. Stark,” a man said as he approached.  “Welcome to Caesar's Palace and congratulations, gentlemen.   We are so pleased you have chosen to celebrate with us.  I’m Stewart.  I’ll be your host this evening.  If you should need anything, please do not hesitate to ask.  In the meantime, the Chef’s Table is yours for the evening, and we’ve reserved you spots at our VIP tables, as usual, Mr. Stark.  I believe craps was your game last time we enjoyed your company.  If you would like, I’ll be happy to prepare your chips for you while you dine.”
“Because…you’re not something I trade, Tony,” Steve replied, grim and exhausted all of a sudden.   “Not…not ever again. I’m sorry. For…all of this, God,” he broke off, hands going to his hips as he let his chin drop to his chest.  He’d really screwed up on this one. He looked up and caught Tony staring at him, wide-eyed and confused. Maybe he hadn’t. He honestly didn’t know or care anymore.  SHIELD could figure it out, eventually, like Peggy suggested. Maybe. Or not. It had seemed to be everything in the world a few minutes ago, and fifteen minutes in with Tony, and his whole worldview was shifting.  Typical, Steve thought with a slight smile. He turned towards the door, hand reaching out for the broken doorknob.
Finally, Steve pushed the blanket off of him where he must have tangled himself up in it during the night and swung his legs to the side of the bed, planting his feet on the wooden floor beneath him.  Cold air prickled over his sweat-soaked skin, and he looked down, noting the mess over his thighs and stomach.  Maybe he
“I should say so,” Jarvis replied archly.
“Who said anything of a reward?” Tony asked, eyebrows raising.  “We are discussing your punishment.”
“Tyber Alpha.  No mate,” Anto said.  “Tyber no—no good.”
“That’s what Bucky keeps saying,” Steve replied, something like an answering smile trying to find a place before it disappeared.   “Ah, here.  You can—hang on,” Steve said.  He put the bag down on the kitchen counter, which seemed to double as a bar, Tony noted, since there were two stools pulled up to it, and walked quickly over to move things around on the loveseat, dropping a backpack next to the twin bed and tossing a cloth bag cinched shut with a knot of cord that must be filled with dirty clothes next to the door, making a place for Tony to sit.  “Sorry it’s such a—“
“I should have told you.  I really was going to tell you.  Had it all planned out,” Tony said with a flat, apologetic grimace.  “Which, of course, went to complete shit.”
“A soldier.  I have lots of soldiers.  Most have seen trebuchets in action more than a few times.  They know how the things work.  Yet, none of them ever suggested such a thing,” the King replied, swilling the cup around in his hand before taking another drink.  “I’m fairly sure none of them ever
“Helpful of you to involve Rogers in all of this,” Obie continued, snapping Tony’s attention back into place.  Obie smiled flatly. “I wasn’t sure how I was going to explain your sudden demise. I mean, someone has to take the fall for this, and who better than a stripper you married out of nowhere?  It isn’t like anyone really cares about what happens to some stripper, is it? Convenient,” Obie continued nonchalantly, catching what must have been horrified panic in Tony’s eyes. “Oh, come on! It’s far too good of a story to pass up.  Sure, I had something else in mind,” he shrugged, “but what am I supposed to do when something like this falls into my lap? Tony Stark marries some Vegas stripper, who just
,” Fury offered, like he had just now thought of the phrase.  “That keep you from coming across this desk at me?” Fury asked with a knowing huff of a laugh.  He gave Steve a long, speculative look, then his voice softened. “Look, I’m sure most of it is just Alphas jawing at each other. They get shot down, Omega’s a tease, right?  Omega won’t give them the time of day? Stuck up. Omega smarts off, maybe shows an Alpha or five up in front of the brass, let’s say, Omega’s a know-it-all. Can’t win, right? The Stark boy, he’s rubbed a few Alphas the wrong way. They get their panties all in a wad, so they talk.  Probably make a lot more of it than it was. You know how it is,” he finished, leaning back in his chair and regarding Steve across his desk.
“It isn’t a divorce sign-up sheet. It’s to protect you, your company, everything that you’ve worked for,” Steve argued.
“Happy said you’d been working on a project?” Steve asked, hoping against hope this wasn’t the point in the day’s visit where he got to sound like an utter idiot.  “Something big?  Is it for the, uh, clean energy thing?”  Steve asked, trying to sound at least reasonably aware of what was going on.
Steve stared at her for a long moment, then lowered his eyes down to the surface of the water, bright with the lights from the oil lamps and torches that lined the columns and walls.  He remembered the burning emptiness of hunger, day after day, until everything was numb.  His mother telling him she had already eaten when he knew she hadn’t.  How she knew which bark and which roots could be boiled so he would have something in his belly.  How hard she worked when he was too sick to help.  He would have done anything, then, to take that burden from her shoulders.
By the time he was standing under the hot spray, he was awake enough to turn thoughts of last night over and over in his head, like flipping the pages of a book and always having the same words appear.  He couldn’t get anything new from it, but there was something comforting about the sameness, even in the light of day.
“You think what?” Steve pressed.
“I want him next,” skinny Steve said, mouth popping off the tip of Tony’s cock with a wet, obscene-sounding noise.
“Tony,” Bruce said, drawing out his name, a small, enigmatic smile playing on his lips.  “Its…well, there is a biological component, don’t get me wrong.  It’s much more complex and much simpler than that, though,” Bruce explained.  Tony just stared at him uncomprehendingly.
“Uh-huh.  Nice to meet you, Steve, is it?”  Rhodey said, standing up and extending a hand towards Steve.
“Yeah. We’re done here,” Steve said.
Steve huffed out a laugh, so Tony counted it as a win and grinned in reply.  “You shouldn’t have been left to your own devices,” Tony said, grin fading.  “Clint was supposed to—“
“There was the one with you and that actor we had emcee the last Expo back in—what—‘93?” Ms. Potts said, letting her head rest against the curve of the back of the sofa.
“Why the hell not?” Tony shouted, tossing the wrench he’d been fidgeting with hard against the metal worktable, the loud bang echoing in the room.
“No comment,” Steve chuckled.  “Go on,” he said to Tony.
“Everything’s fine and nothing happened. Right,” Tony huffed out, giving Steve a long look before turning forward again, allowing Steve to keep up his ministrations.  It gave Steve something to do, and he liked the feeling of Tony under his hands, solid and here, right
Tony’s hand found Steve’s cock and stroked, idly, barely a touch.  It was enough to draw a high, keening whine of protest out of Steve, which earned a satisfied-sounding grunt from Tony as he left Steve’s nipple and started kissing, nipping and sucking his way around the dusky edge, then down Steve’s chest, over the ripples of muscle.  Steve felt Tony scrape his fingers through the short, twisty hair that framed Steve’s cock, back and forth, then catching in it, tugging a bit, sending a streak of pain and want pounding through Steve’s cock.
“Hmm?” Steve said.
“---Right, so we will probably need some new flooring, and lighting.  He needs light for the workstation.  How’s the wi-fi?  Okay, that’s not going to work,” Pepper’s voice rang out in the hallway over the click-clack of her heels across the linoleum floor.  “Who’s your guy at the power company?  We’ll probably need—“ Pepper stopped, the phone still held to her mouth, which was now slightly agog as she took in the apartment.  Her wide eyes darted to Tony, then to Rhodey, who shrugged helpfully.  “How do you feel about tenting a building?  Can you tent a building?  Look, David, I’m going to have to call you back, just get over here as soon as possible.  Bring shovels,” she said, hitting the button to end the call.  “Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me???”
“Yes, well.  Forgive me, I remember when you were a boy, you had your adventures amongst the rocks of my mountain, running all over the place like you were trying to get your fool head knocked off,” Tony replied.
“Love you, too,” Tony rasped out.  “I know, it’s been—well, I’ve been.  Me, I know, I’ve been distracted, and—I just.  I needed this.  I needed us.  To just be us for a while.  And we’re more--more
“Who?” the man asked with seemingly mild curiosity.
He was dizzy.  He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t think.  He wanted--he
“How about some kind of scrolling hologram thing for your shield?” Tony suggested.
.  But, there was nothing there, just the dull throb of the thought that he wanted to go home in the back of his mind, distant and fading.  Preston had his button open and his hand on his zipper.  Calvins. Of course.  Tony licked his lips.  Breathe through your nose, he thought.  It’ll be okay.  Ty was right. It wasn’t a big deal.  Not like he hadn’t done it tons of times before.  It’ll be over soon. Then he could go home. Ty promised.
“Let’s take him up on it,” Tony urged.  “You should be in art school, anyway.  Come on, you don’t even like this stuff.  You’re taking this because you think you missed too much math and science to make up, taking care of your mom and all.  I know you.  You find the repetitiveness of the human race’s desire to fuck each other over just depressing.  You like things that are beautiful.  You want to create.  You want to make something that speaks to people, not sit and listen to Doomed to Repeat Itself 101,” Tony protested.
“Yes.  Well,” Tony said quickly, a flurry of motion as he turned and headed for his bedchamber.  Steve set the book aside and got up to follow him.  “Speaking of advising, I’m afraid I must take my leave of you now.  I’ve a meeting with the Lord Chamberlain this afternoon,” Tony called out over his shoulder.  “Return to me tonight,” Tony said, catching Steve’s wrist as he passed by and bringing it to his lips.  Steve nodded, eyes darting to where Tony’s mouth pressed to his wrist, warming the skin there.
Anyway, he and Steve kept meeting over the years when Steve would show up at the house or SI, until Tony finally managed to get up the nerve to ask Steve out.  Okay, fine, so that had looked a lot like trying to grind on him in the backseat of a limo when Steve was doing some kind of chivalry routine by insisting on going with Tony to the airport, all because of some kind of “chatter” or whatever.  Tony wasn’t sure what Steve thought he was going to do other than talk any potential terrorists to death about the rise of neo-nazism, Steve’s area of expertise, apparently, but Tony wasn’t one to walk away from an opportunity when it presented itself in the back of a limo holding a cheeseburger, milkshake and some giant art portfolio thing that Steve sometimes used to lug around whatever art piece he was working on at the time, Tony had later learned.   Impractical and old-fashioned. Tony had tried to get him to upgrade to digital art, but Steve stubbornly hung on to the portfolio.
, they just need to shut up.  You’re not going to do that, though, are you?  No, not you.  You’re just going to take it, aren’t you?  Take all of this,” Hammer said, pulling his cock out of his breeches.
“Okay, that t-shirt I got you was a joke. A souvenir from our trip to Disney. You took that way too seriously,” Tony objected.
Shellhead snorted out a huffing laugh as Steve slowly unwound himself from his crouch.  “A little warning next time?” he suggested with a scowl. Shellhead grinned. “So, dinner is served I take it?”
Steve called out Tony’s name again, then feeling a bit uncertain, stepped out onto the balcony.  Even at this height, the noise from the city below echoed, putting him a bit at ease.  Still, there was no sign of Tony.  Maybe he went to get breakfast?  That made no sense.  An early morning call?  He was an important person, after all.  That could happen.  Maybe he needed to take that somewhere private or didn’t want to disturb Steve or…
"You say that now..." Tony replied flatly.
the edge of the table.  Tony vaguely recalled Coulson mentioning gym equipment and his mind flashed to watching a perfectly good Audi get tossed like a child’s toy because…because Tony had been jealous. Or something.  “What’s going on in that head of yours, Tony?”
“Does this mean I get my new arm?” Barnes asked, glancing between them.
“I want seven thousand dollars,” Steve told him.  “Whatever happens.  Seven thousand.  Look,” he continued when Tony opened his mouth to interrupt.  “I’m already in this, whether I walk away now or later.  The story is out there.  They know who I am.  Whatever risk there is to me, it was there as soon as I took your friend up on his offer, even though no one knew it at the time.  I didn’t ask to be a part of this, but I am.  Might as well get paid,” Steve finished with a shrug.  Seven thousand.  That would do it.  He’d figured another few months at the club to save up that much extra, but he could have it in under a week, and it would be over.  Granted, he had no idea what came after that, and he probably should’ve asked for enough for a cushion, but that felt wrong for some reason.  He’d figure the rest out, he supposed, one way or the other.
Locker room talk. That’s what Rumlow called it, and here they were. This is what he meant.  He meant talking about Tony like this.  Like that name excused it, somehow.  Made it meaningless, a joke. It didn’t feel like a joke.  These things they said about Tony--what if Tony heard them? What if Tony knew?
“No problem,” Tony said, his voice flat and even. He was looking at Steve a bit oddly, like he was trying to figure something out.  His hand dropped away from Steve’s wrist, and Steve looked down at the place where it had been, startled by the sudden feeling of loss.
“Exactly,” Tony nodded.
“Well, anyway.  Just thought you should know.  Might take a bit longer than you were hoping, if he gets a lawyer involved,” Pepper said, munching steadily on the bag of fries.  “Here,” she said, tossing him a cheeseburger wrapped in greased-stained wax paper.  “Eat something.”
What had Phillips said?  Your first impulse is usually the right one.  Trust your gut, boy.
Steve’s eyes snapped open, his body coming instantly awake, every nerve tingling in alert as he sat up in their bed. It was the middle of the night, and Tony was gone, which was enough of an unusual situation to make his heart skip a beat, but really, it was the ten—no, he corrected, twelve—armored suits that ringed the bed that raised the true concern.
“But—but how?” Steve repeated, still not understanding.
“I’m literally standing right here.  You know I can hear you, right?” Rhodes cut in, stepping forward as Tony grinned.

“Wall that…oh, you mean an ATM?” Tony replied.
“Good. Good, Steve,” Tony praised, but didn’t stop the slow circling of his fingers. “Now, again.”
bloomed within him.
“My brother finds his little tricks amusing,” Thor observed from the back of the jet where he twirled Mjolnir like he was trying out for the majorettes.  The movement distracted Steve long enough for Tony to get the improvised diaper fixed around his waist and chest a bit better though, which seemed to surprise Steve.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, you’re not totally useless,” Tony sighed, brought up the phone’s search engine and typed in a quick query.  Huh.  That was…odd.  Apparently, Italy’s border changed at the end of World War Two, with the signing of the Paris Peace Treaties in ’47, and then again along the border with what was then Yugoslavia.  The changes were barely noticeable, at least to Tony’s eye, yet Steve had Vespucci-ed the differences from a paper placemat at some hole-in-the-wall Prego joint.
“We have our own guards,” Cam whispered delightedly.  “Just for us!  Well, for you.”
“Ah, come on.  He had that coming,” Bucky said without a trace of guilt.  “Got you invited back, didn’t I?  Don’t say I never do anything for you.”
“Sorry.  I shouldn’t have--I don’t know why I said that,” Steve told him.
A pang of understanding hit Steve.  This was what Rhodes meant.  Tony was a good man, and capable of great things, but he was driven by his burdens, his fears, his guilt at what he counted as his failures, to make things better, to fix the world because he could, so he had to, and somewhere, somehow, he had lost the faith that his heart could lead them to a far better place than his hands could build.  It was a dangerous thing, though, a man such as this to be led by his heart, and how many times had Tony told him that it was a path he could not follow?
“You don’t have to do this,” Steve said quietly.
Tony swallowed, or tried to.  He could do this.  It would be okay.  Not like he hadn’t done it plenty.  It was fine.  Everything was fine.  He had a moment to wonder that he couldn’t seem to muster any emotion to go with the words.  There should be something there.  Excitement, fear, anger, disgust, arousal,
“I’ll run to the store after I change.  Grab some baby things,” Clint offered.  “See what you can find something soft for him to eat.  Nothing bigger than about the tip of your thumb per bite, okay?”
A burst of saliva watered Steve’s mouth, and he tried to swallow, but couldn’t quite manage around Tony’s cock, making him cough, throat working to try to accommodate air and too much wetness and Tony’s cock filling him, not caring about either.  Long, deep strokes that made Steve’s eyes water and shook the leaflike fringe of the veil until it clinked lightly together.  The pendant swung wildly where it hung from his chest, tugging and pulling at the clamps, sending pings of stinging pain down his chest and groin as Tony used his mouth.  Tears streamed from his eyes, and Steve blinked them back, lashes sticking together.  Tony brush a silvery trail off Steve’s cheek with his thumb and brought it to his mouth, sucking Steve’s tears off his finger as if they were an elixir, even as his hips snapped hard, pounding his cock into Steve’s mouth while bright, white stars blurred against Steve’s eyes.
“You are many things.  But, you are not selfish,” Steve said, slowly, firmly, keeping his gaze locked on Tony’s.  He moved forward in the water, until his body was brushing against Tony’s, and his hands settled on the sharp bones of Tony’s hips.  “You are not.”
“His,” Steve waved a hand towards the keep. “Have.” What would he do with a keep? Stone and earth, this mattered not. If the Omega wanted it, let it be so. It was not even a particularly fine keep. Steve would get him a far richer one if he wished it.
