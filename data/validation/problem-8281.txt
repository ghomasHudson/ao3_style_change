Oddly enough, it turned out that thinking about the reason why he was so aroused just made the problem worse, and he needed to stop if he ever wanted to be decent.
It’s nearly a week before Tony turns back to normal.  Darn it, Thor.
on stage was Tony.
Of course, since Steve was blindfolded, it made him startle and tense up, and he moaned as the vibrator went faster in reaction.
He has to exert a little control to get them all to stop and focus on swimming instead, and he’s about to apologize, but then Steve wraps his legs around Tony’s waist and arches his back, his face pink, his nipples even pinker, and gasps, “That felt so good,” and there goes any chance of keeping his tentacles to himself.
Or he tried to at least, although the way a furrow appeared on Tony’s brow indicated he hadn’t succeeded.
He thought that he’d made up for it since, but he still didn’t know what the whole thing had been about. At the end there, Steve had kind of looked like—but that was impossible, that was just Tony letting his anger color the situation. Whatever the cause, Steve hadn’t acted any differently around him since then other than some extra wariness that had disappeared by the next morning, so he couldn’t really complain, especially since that incident aside, they’d been getting along pretty well.
man, and he had no desire to be controlled by biology, to lose any and all coherent thought and be a slave to unpredictable heats where the most—the
He didn’t know why his subconscious chose the good memories over the bad, but they’d appear over and over again, a filmstrip of might-have-beens that cut worse than even the look on Tony’s face the last time they’d been alone. When had Tony stopped being a means to end and become someone he actually wanted to be with? How could he never have realized how much he’d come to depend on him until after it was already too late?
“It’s alright, Steve. You’re alright,” he said, hoping he didn’t sound as choked up to Steve as he did to himself. “Thank you for telling me that and for apologizing.”
He wasn’t, though. He was weak, weak to Tony’s presence, to his touch; weak to the headiness of Tony’s attention, and although he knew he’d regret it later, Steve couldn’t stop himself from taking everything Tony offered.
“Yes, of course.” He can’t help tensing as Dr. Stark reaches out, but it’s not as bad, now that he’s expecting it. It even starts to feel … kind of good. The way massaging a knot of muscle feels good, a little painful but you don’t want it to stop.
“No, no, just lay it on me. I don’t know which is worse: the suspense, or the pain from all this torture—or “exercise” as Steve likes to call it—but one of those at least I can get rid of immediately. Spill it.”
Maybe after he’d well and truly earned his place at Tony’s feet, with pain and tears instead of through Tony’s forgiving nature, he could ask if he could spend the day—
“You’re obviously not happy, Tony.”
,” he says, getting angry all over again just thinking about it.  Steve had told him the news one hour ago.  And he was leaving tomorrow.  “You've already said that we won't be able to talk much, maybe not at all!  I just want something to be able to look at in the middle of the night when I’m alone."
He couldn’t deny that he wanted to hear Steve say he loved him again, though, wanted to look his eyes as he said it and see the emotion for himself; wanted to say it back to him because he hadn’t had a chance to yet, but now that he could string two thoughts together, the words were desperate to be free. Steve deserved to hear them, needed to hear them, and Tony needed to say them just as much.
“Right, wrong holiday.  Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!  With rum,” Tony added as an afterthought, wrapping his hand around Steve’s neck, his thumb caressing his jaw.  “Look, we’re under the mistletoe.”
“Wait, wait,” he panted and despaired to find he was hard again. But even now, with Tony’s knot being considerably smaller than it had been, it still felt excruciatingly good, and he realized he must have tightened up again somewhat, because it stretched him out so well. He wasn’t sure it was fair to know this about himself, that being stuffed and full to breaking could make him want even more, but he didn’t have time to regret it. Tony whined and jerked back then, once and then again as Steve gasped and desperately tried to bear down, although whether to push him out or try to keep him in, he honestly couldn’t  say, and then Tony was slipping out of him, a mortifying rush of come following right after, and Steve moaned at how empty he felt, moaned even louder as Tony settled down and started licking him clean, burying his tongue into where Steve was wet and open for him.
waiting on Steve to prove himself, he couldn’t blame him. He was right to. Steve didn’t deserve his trust.
He didn’t know who was more surprised, Stark or him, and he found himself staring for a second before he thought to ask, “Are you al—”
He flinched slightly as Tony pulled out the earbuds, but there was so much static in his head that even when Tony said something, he couldn’t really understand it. He registered how soft Tony’s voice was, though, and he didn’t know if the gentleness was easier or harder to take than anger, but it didn’t matter, and he let the thought go without focusing on it, because Steve couldn’t—
Tony whined, his tongue wriggling against Steve’s abdomen as he tried to get further inside, and Steve did laugh then, a shocked gasp that was probably more from giddiness than sensation.
Tony frowned when he heard the muted hum of the elevators. He wasn’t expecting anyone, and JARVIS hadn’t announced anyone coming up.
“Hey,” Stark said when Steve made his way back into the living room. He was sitting on the long couch, watching car racing. “Weren’t you a busy little bee today?”
One, the vibrations didn’t slow down as soon as Steve relaxed. There was a slight delay, and the longer Steve tensed, the longer until the toy went back to its original speed.

choking on Tony’s cock, too much for his own good.
“Don’t stop,” Steve gasps frantically, his fingers tugging Tony’s head back. “Please don’t stop kissing me.”
as it were, which, wow, did that mean Captain America thought Tony was a high-class hooker?  Because if so, Tony was
"Sometimes," he says cautiously, because he's not sure where Tony's going with this, and he's learned by now not to blindly agree to anything Tony proposes.  The one time with the watermelons and the golf clubs had been enough, thanks.
, and there was a certain expectation of isolation to a degree, like Tony could be in the room with Steve, but he wouldn’t be actively participating.
“Well, it’s—it’s not one of those things you keep a tally of,” he said, his back flexing as Tony went over the exact spot he’d found before. Was Tony doing that on purpose?
A wave of relief rushes over Steve, so big that his limbs actually feel a little rubbery in the aftermath.
So obviously in the vote-off, this fic won.
“Now this is the fun part,” Tony said, pasting a smile on his face, and Steve looked down at his bare lap, which did nothing to make him feel better. “The machine won’t turn on as long as you keep your legs together.”
“Tony,” Steve said, just his name, but Tony finally fell silent at the impatience in Steve’s voice, even though Steve hadn’t meant to reveal anything at all.
considering Steve had gotten lost in X-rated fantasies instead of paying attention to what Dr. Stark had been doing, and he has no one to blame but himself that he’s in this situation.
It was harder to stay still as he waited once again, his hands clenched at his sides so as not to give in to the urge to cover himself. Tony wanted to see him, and Steve wouldn’t deny him that,
Should he kiss him? Would Tony want him to kiss him? Two kisses didn’t automatically assume permission for more. Did they?
He knew that for Tony, flirting was like breathing, something done unthinkingly but necessary for survival.  He’d seen Tony flirt with people he’d just met, people he’d known since childhood, people he didn’t even particularly
“But are you going to do
“What kind of Dom would I be if I let my Sub do any work after he asked for a break?”
Luckily, that part is over with quickly, and Steve doesn’t react to anything Dr. Stark does until he puts the flashlight away and lightly places his hands back on Steve’s neck. As soon as they reach his glands, Steve hisses and instinctively jerks back.
“If you want to say your safeword, you can.”
Tony tormented him a moment longer, Steve’s hips twitching as Tony’s tongue thrust and rolled, his gasps muffled against his arm. Tony finally pulled away in order to mount Steve, leaving him gaping open and too empty, and his front paws thudded on either side of Steve’s face. They were vaguely terrifying, the claws seeming improbably long and sharp from this close, but Steve was just grateful to be able to hold onto his legs as he felt Tony’s cock thrust against him, hot and stiff and intimidating, trying to find his opening as Tony’s fur rubbed along his back.
“Just to make sure you’re doing alright. I’m going to be in the room too but over there,” Tony said, pointing to the side, and Steve hadn’t even noticed the workstation there when they’d entered. He nodded again, looking down, and folded his hands together, squeezing them tightly, trying to tamp down some of the panic that had welled up at the thought that Tony was going to abandon him.
“It’s okay; you’re okay,” Tony said, bringing Steve’s face to the shelter of his chest.  “You were—but it’s okay now.  I’ve got you, I’ve—”
“You are one kinky motherfucker,” Steve hears dimly as he opens his eyes, and he groans, immediately shutting them again.  His whole body aches, muscles throbbing, his throat devastatingly dry and somehow . . . furry . . . or something. He feels
“Steve,” Tony croaked, breaking his silence in response to the pain in Steve’s voice. He wanted to say more, but he couldn’t get anything out past the block in his throat.
an unmitigated disaster, though, so there’s that.
“Rule six?” He raised his eyebrows, because he remembered exactly what rule six was. “That was a long time ago—”
“However, we realize that would put you in the position of having to find a second Dom in an extremely short period of time. Since you didn’t want a Dom in the first place, I argued, and the President agreed, that due to the circumstances, as long as you meet with a SHIELD-approved therapist once every two weeks, you don’t have to take another Dom.”
“What the hell?” Tony yelps as Steve dies. He’d been sniping the zone, so by the time he gets to Steve’s ghost, the other player is gone, and Tony can’t even avenge him.
“A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle!” Tony snapped, and it was all he could do not to flinch.
Fury sighed, rubbing his forehead, but it totally wasn’t Tony’s fault.  When he subbed, he could take or leave the sex, preferred to leave it most of the time, and surprise, surprise, there wasn’t a shortage of men and women who were willing to smack him around a little bit without a promise of orgasm afterward.  When he dommed though . . . what could he say?  It got the blood flowing.
I just thought I’d warn you that I am considering writing a Nostalgia AU (even though I haven’t finished this yet, I know, I know) where society is a little meaner towards Subs and there is a lot of dubcon/“noncon but he likes it” sex. So if you guys see an alert for Nostalgia AU (I’m all about original titles), don’t be surprised, and read the warnings, because it would have amoral!Tony and dive into the hardcore porn much sooner.
?” Steve gasps, twisting on his side and wincing in the process, and Tony starts to laugh.
. That was all that mattered to him.
Steve felt lost and useless as he stood awkwardly at Tony’s side. They had literally just been touching, but he couldn’t bring himself to offer his arm for support, no matter how much he wanted to.
“I should have …” He took a fortifying breath. “I should’ve said my safeword then.” He didn’t know why it hurt so much to admit that he’d needed to, but it did, like a betrayal of what he was for Tony. Of the man he’d always thought himself to be. He knew how important safewords were, but he’d always imagined he could handle whatever the world threw at him and still be able to take more.
He’s just getting so wet.
“Tell me you didn’t message Tony and ask him if he’s bi. Tell me.”
It didn’t make sense. It didn’t make any sense, unless …
How is this his life?
“Tony,” he begged, because no matter how good it felt, he needed more.  He would’ve thought that any touch would be enough to push him over, but after having been denied for so long, it was like his body was afraid the opportunity would be stolen away from him once again and refused to let go.
They moved to the living room, and Steve would’ve sat in one of the chairs facing the couch, but Tony took his hand and arranged them so they were sitting on the couch, facing each other, both of Steve’s hands in his.
“Steve,” Stark wheezed, and Steve glanced down.  He looked horrible, pale and drawn, his skin clammy.  It was obvious that he needed immediate medical attention, but there was nothing Steve could do.  “Left at the fork.  Two rights.  Access code is 598320.”
When Stark had told him he had a checkup scheduled, Steve hadn’t really thought much about it. He’d seen too many doctors in his life, before and after the Serum, to worry about one more.
And yet Steve could feel himself calming down, the nervous agitation of minutes before settling into something less hectic and all-consuming.
It became a blur of fumbling hands and hastily shoved-aside clothes, but then Tony was astride his lap and Steve was pushing into him, tears forming in his eyes that he could have this again when he’d thought Tony was gone forever.
Or that Tony’s seen him naked. More than once. Or that during each visit, Tony has had his fingers as well as—
“I never hated you,” he said softly, and it was unnatural seeing Tony without his usual energy, weary and broken down. He’d done that, Steve knew, but instead of feeling proud that he could accomplish such a thing, he felt uneasy. Anxious.
Maybe the best way to do that was to be honest and ask Steve for all the things that Tony had been holding back for nearly the entire time they’d been together. He was already going to tell him he loved him. The rest of it couldn’t be any worse, could it? Not when the majority of the reason Tony had kept them to himself was because he hadn’t wanted Steve to suspect just how deep his feelings ran.
. He had to stay focused. Steve needed him, and while Tony had already fucked everything up, he’d be damned if he didn’t at least give Steve his attention here at the end, whatever it eventually cost him.
Some twitch of Steve’s face had Stark saying, “Wait, you disappeared in what, 1945? Which was after Colossus was developed but before ENIAC was finished, and oh fuck, tell me you’ve at least heard of something more advanced than Babbage’s difference engine?”
It was so easy to sink to his knees, to rest his hands flat on the ground; so much easier than standing and facing Tony.
“Steve, are you al—”
and do what Tony had said.
“I know.”
Tony’s tongue slid under the elastic band of his shorts in response, and Steve nearly jackknifed off the ground.
“Captain Steve Rogers,” he replied, all rigid lines and judgmental looks, and Tony was going to have so much fun with him.  He felt almost giddy in anticipation.
He’d already had what felt like an eternity to figure out what he should’ve said, the things he should’ve done, and all the fear, all the what-ifs didn’t matter. There was just one answer.
Steve closed his eyes for a second, swallowing heavily, and Tony realized distantly that Steve’s cheeks were dry now, and when had Steve wiped them clean?
Steve didn’t know how he felt about it. It was made out of metal and shaped almost like a basket so it could fit over his nose and mouth. It was somehow both lighter and heavier than he’d expected, and when he rolled his jaw, he could feel the leather straps tighten against his cheeks. On the one hand, it was almost reassuring to have the physical reminder to not talk, to not say anything poisonous or hurtful and to use his silence to make up for all the things he should’ve said before.
“I thought they’d forgotten about us,” she whispered as she stepped forward, tears starting to well in her eyes.
“I can’t take you anywhere.”
This is the last one, guys.  Thank you so much for reading.  It's been a blast.
Steve blinks down at the towels, lightly touching the evidence that Tony had worried about protecting Steve’s bed, about taking care of Steve, and he just—
It was always about him, always and always and always.
Somehow … somehow Tony had already forgiven him. Or was close enough that it made no difference. Steve had suspected as much, but he’d thought—had hoped—that he was wrong. But here was Tony, already willing to brush aside all of Steve’s sins like they’d never happened.
The whole point of a sex toy was to help someone orgasm, so when Steve tightened up around it, Tony had programmed the vibrations to go faster and concentrate around his prostate. All well and good, except for two … okay, two-and-a-half things.
“You didn’t do anything. Not the way you’re thinking about it anyway. You just …” Tony let out another sigh, gripping his hair in obvious frustration. “I don’t want to hurt you, not like that, not even during a punishment, and when you … when you don’t …” His arms fell at his sides. “I don’t think you know how to say no, Steve. To me. Not in this kind of situation.”
He’d been lying on his stomach, and there were what he assumed to be bandages on his back. Which meant that …
“I didn’t
“Ni—” He barely kept himself from saying that Nick had implied Tony knew about Insight. “I thought that—”
Well, he’d deal with it then.
Nope, he was definitely not ready for that serious of a tone, and he ignored him in favor of going behind the counter. What to drink; what to drink?
“Would he? Maybe he feels like he has to hold up his end of the contract or something.” He let his head thunk against the dummy.
It took everything in him to not let a tear fall, but Steve clawed and scraped at his control, and he managed somehow. He couldn’t stop the shakiness of his breathing, however, no matter how much he grit his teeth or tried to take deep breaths, and there was no hiding it from Tony, when he was that close.
.  He once spent the whole time he’d reserved having Steve try on one outfit after another—with Tony in the room the whole time, he’s not stupid—and they’d never even gotten to the sex.
-----
He had plans, damn it! He’d intended to eat Steve out until he fucking
“I wouldn’t want it to be said that I don’t care of the needs of my Subs, even during punishment. Stay right there,” Tony said, walking away, and Steve could feel the sound that wanted to escape building in his throat. Tony wasn’t supposed to leave.
He’d known that Tony had cared. What he hadn’t known was how much. And he still didn’t, honestly, but he couldn’t have hurt Tony to that degree unless his feelings for Steve had been a lot deeper than he’d grasped back then.
Maybe it started with the kisses, though. Tony had been so patient recently, but that surely had to be for Steve’s sake. Like Natasha, he’d heard enough stories about Tony to recognize that wasn’t how Tony normally operated.
, ha, yeah.  He groans as Steve applies the makeshift bandage, everything turning hazy around the edges from the pain, and it’s all he can do to not throw up.  When Steve lifts him off the ground, it’s a relief to let go, the blackness sucking him under, down and down and down.
Isn’t that possibility worth something?
that was why Steve had come back, so there was no reason to feel like someone had taken a hammer and tried to pry out the arc reactor from his chest. It didn’t change anything.
Steve knew what it was like to go, go, go, until he finally stopped, and he wasn’t surprised that Tony’s energy had finally run out now that he’d sat down and filled his stomach.
He didn’t know if he should be worried that Tony wanted him to not act like a man. Was it Tony’s way of saying that he thought the only way Steve could be good was if he couldn’t speak or act out?
Nick had been so angry at the army-assigned Negotiator when he’d found out Steve had been told about Peggy before they’d even gotten her consent.  Nick had kicked him out and taken over the position personally, but by then, it had already been too late.
“Yes, it was,” Stark snapped, but his shoulders relaxed slightly. “It won’t happen again,” he said, turning toward him, and Steve didn’t know what to do with the promise in his eyes.
home, and know that Tony would say the same.  But the more shopping they did, the more he started wondering if maybe they were taking things too fast.
Steve shudders from head to toe and squeezes the table so hard, he swears he hears it creak.
you, and I know you wouldn’t do anything he didn’t want you to do!”
“Then I don’t mind at all,” Tony said, and Steve nodded, slowly sliding to the floor, watching Tony’s face to make sure he really was okay with it. He put his knees as close to Tony’s feet as he could, wanting to feel the warmth of his body if nothing else.
“Hello, Tony,” Steve said quietly, and Tony stared.
“I’m going to move the sheet out of the way now,” Dr. Stark says, and Steve wonders if it’s his imagination that Dr. Stark’s voice is raspier than it was a second ago, but he wants and he hopes …
-----
There’d been a moment when he’d been incredibly tempted to climb into bed with him, but he’d simply wrapped Tony up in his comforter before heading to his own room instead. One thing being with Tony had taught him was the importance of receiving permission; Tony had always been so careful to ask before he ever did anything to Steve, and he didn’t want to return the favor by assuming Tony would say yes.
-----
“You don’t look fine; you look exhausted. When was the last time you got a full night’s sleep?”
The expression on Tony’s face made it all worth it, however, pride and arousal and reverence, and Steve resolved to hold it in as long as possible.
“Alright.” Steve pushed back the covers and stood up, ignoring the curtain of darkness that fell over his eyes. He’d been picking at his food recently, but he’d have to make sure to eat properly at breakfast. What good was he to Tony if he had trouble with something as minor as this?
“No.”
“That can't be right!  Sorry, there seems to be some kind of interference with my audio.  Must've been that last pass when I got knocked into the wall.  I couldn't make out what you said, over."
But then Steve sighs and says, “Alright, Tony.  But just this once.  And I don’t want you to mention it to
-----
“He’ll make sure you—”
If the other guy is naked, and Steve’s in bed with him, does that mean . . . ?
Steve got up and started clearing the table. It was a typical Sub duty, and he’d balked at performing it the first day he’d arrived, but Stark had never acted like he expected Steve to do it, had gotten up after lunch and taken his own plate—leaving Steve’s in front of him—like he hadn’t even thought of the possibility that Steve would do it for him now that they were contracted. Steve had been raised to do his part, however, and it’d taken a few meals, but he’d started cleaning up after Stark as well. Stark had provided the meal after all; the least Steve could do was clear the dishes. Stark had been so pleased the first time Steve had done it, beaming at him in delight, far out of proportion to what Steve was doing. But Stark hated cleaning up, even if it just meant taking the plates from the table to the dishwasher, and he’d been thrilled.
The pandemonium that broke out then drowned out the rest of his words, but it still wasn’t louder than the roar of blood in Steve’s ears.
“—and I’m telling you, man, it don’t matter how good she cooks if she—”
Steve just … he needed to know that Tony wanted him still. Just that. He knew he didn’t deserve any kind of praise or tenderness, but just … just that one thing.
He eyed the sandwich, debating whether or not to take another bite.
Oh. He raises his head and catches a glimpse of Dr. Stark reaching for the lube and the speculum, the first of which isn't necessary, the second of which definitely is. He drops back onto the pillow.
Let himself. As if Tony hadn’t actively gone out and looked for someone. To make the pain go away. To make the pain that much worse.
For as odd as the seat looked, it was surprisingly comfortable, all the parts that touched his skin padded and covered in soft cloth, with the headrest and armrests placed perfectly. Steve would’ve been more grateful if he weren’t so on edge, but it was hard to drum up any appreciation when he felt so exposed.
How could Tony not know, when Steve had come back because he couldn’t stand to be away, when he fell apart at a touch, at a glance from Tony? When he did things for Tony that he’d never done for anyone else and did them gratefully and aching for more?
—he was going to stay. “Do you think it’s any different for me?”
“Why are you here?” Tony asked, his patience gone, and he didn’t even care that he was the first one to blink. He just wanted Steve to say whatever it was he’d come to say and then leave.
—will keep you warm enough.”
The whole thing had actually been a lot easier than he’d expected.  Agents were scurrying around like their tails were on fire, so something big had to be going on.  Lucky for him.
“Look, Steve, I’ve got to go. You do what you want, but don’t come crying to me when Tony invites you to his wedding and you have to stand in the back of the reception hall and think, if only I’d manned up and asked him out when I had the chance, then I could be the prettiest princess right now.”
The truth was that Steve
And the expression in his eyes when Tony had demanded Steve look at him had held surprise, yes, but something that had resembled panic as well; panic and what had appeared to be a thread of longing.
He tilts his head, wondering if the guy’s still alive. It’s pure luck that Tony found him, floating on a piece of driftwood in the middle of nowhere. He has no idea how he got out here, considering Humans say Angels always stay close to land.
But while he had no problem indulging in most of his fantasies, he drew the line at knotting.
“Not exactly, but I—”
Tony’s tentacles actually knot together for a second when he sees him.
Especially when he thought about Tony putting his hand on his neck.
Tony shoved him, and Steve blinked up at him from his position on the floor. Tony looked just as surprised as he felt, and no wonder. He was
And Steve knows that’s a ridiculous thought—it’s not like he’s ever gotten his mouth on any part of Tony’s anatomy, no matter how much he might’ve wished otherwise—but it’s true nonetheless, and he just wants more and more, until he’s had enough to make up for having none up until this point.
He was so lost in his thoughts that when Tony finally said, “Take off your clothes,” Steve’s head jerked up, and he forgot all about keeping his eyes down.
And while Steve acknowledged that he didn’t deserve any of that from Tony, he couldn’t give up the certainty of Tony’s affections. He’d built a whole life for himself on that foundation, and even when Steve had worried Tony was hiding things from him, he hadn’t doubted that Tony cared.
Actually, no, he had no idea how to be the supportive but left-behind Dom, because that was not generally a position he’d ever found himself in. Still, he could at least say, “Be safe,” and pull Steve forward in to a real hug, bodies touching from their heads down almost to their feet. “I’ll be here when you get back.”
It’d been a long time since Tony had felt anything close to hope about whatever relationship he and Steve had, and he hadn’t realized how heavy the weight of expectation had become. Steve was going to leave him. He knew it. Maybe it wouldn’t be today or tomorrow, but it’d happen soon enough, and Tony had woken up every morning with the end in sight.
Fuck.
“Don’t look!” Steve gasps, bringing his knees up and clenching his thighs together automatically in some sort of pointless attempt at modesty, as if Dr. Stark’s somehow going to miss his reaction in a few minutes when his head is between Steve’s legs and his fingers and tongue are inside his—
“Relax, he’s upstairs.
But he still doesn’t regret the fashion show.
There’s scent marking and then there’s
“I think we’ve already proven the Time Stone should be a last resort and even then, only for something on the scale of universal salvation. As I said, someone needs to have sex with Tony. It doesn’t matter who since the curse isn’t bound to true love. But as I want to set realistic expectations, the person who volunteers will have to be in the receptive role. Let me know when you decide,” he told them, and with a snap of his cape, he left the room.
Steve had been ready to be beaten until he could barely walk, had considered the idea of falling at Tony’s feet from pain as something approaching justice. Acting like Tony’s pet was nowhere in the same ballpark and not something he would’ve ever thought of to make up for hurting Tony the way he had, but … Tony had obviously put a lot of thought into everything, and if this was what Tony wanted …
“Some of these are pretty deep, but overall, they look good,” Dr. Reynold’s said, stepping back, and Steve wondered if he were imagining the flat tone of his voice. “No lacerations anywhere. And you aren’t experiencing any internal pain? Or anything that seems out of the ordinary?”
—damn it.” He closed the distance between them and hugged him, wrapping his arms as much as he could around him as Tony expressed his frustration and sorrow, and Tony slowly quieted, letting out a few last mournful
Tony’s lips twisted into a shadow of a smile. “Because I’ve always wanted to know, Steve,” he said, his voice hoarse and almost pained, and it struck Steve once again how much he just wanted Tony to be
Steve staggered to his feet.
“Mm,” he grunts in lieu of speaking because he’s sure his voice would break, and putting together a chain of words seems excessively daunting. Dr. Stark is still straining to get deeper, his fingers veritably mapping the contours of Steve’s prostate as he goes, and Steve tries to do what he asked, but his limbs don’t want to cooperate. They feel jittery and weak, and it’s a miracle he hasn’t fallen off the table with the way his pelvis keeps jerking in response to something Dr. Stark does.
Steve couldn’t see much from his position, but it seemed like Tony was dancing.
Tony slid his own arms around Steve at the same time, one hand spread across the middle of his back, the other clasping Steve’s opposite shoulder. He squeezed Steve, a quick pulse, and then just stood there, gently rubbing up and down Steve’s spine.
, Steve thought, steeling himself, and then he quickly shoved the vibrator as deep as it could go, swallowing the grunt of pain and making sure to pull his cheek open so Tony could see how much he’d taken.
Alright, so maybe Tony had been thinking about it a little more than he should, but whatever, he was only human.  Tony still wasn’t going to touch him, because like one of those fancy cakes served at formal parties or a wedding, Steve might look amazing and mouth-wateringly delicious on the outside, but on the inside, he was dry and bitter and deceiving, and whoever had put the combination together was a jackass.
Many thanks again to lmao_thunder for looking this over!
“Whatever you’re thinking, whatever you’re telling yourself right now, I meant it when I said it’s not a failure to use your safeword.”
I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter. I’ll be honest and say that I’m still on the fence about finishing this story. After not writing for almost two months, it was really hard getting back into the swing of things. I kind of thought I was done writing fanfiction altogether, but I started really missing it, so we’ll see. I’ll admit that the more kudos and comments I get, the more I want to write, but I have no idea if any of you are still following this since it’s been like 10 months since I first started it—ugh, I am so sorry—so do with that what you will. I won’t blame any of you for having lost interest.
“This isn’t the last—”
“You realize that you’ve taken away the one good thing that has come from this whole body-swapping fiasco, right?”
Tony’s lips quirked. “Honor. So about last night,” Tony said, his hands starting a slow stroke down Steve’s back.
Isn’t it worth a whole damn lot?
“Do you have a minute?” Steve asked, hovering uncertainly at Tony’s door, and it was the first time he’d ever come to Tony’s bedroom.
Tony—would ever look twice at him.  Inside, he’s still that scrawny kid from Brooklyn who never won a fight or stole a single kiss, and okay, yes, he’s jealous.  Because
He smiled to himself, thinking about Tony’s expression were he to ask that question. It seemed like the kind of thing Tony would appreciate.
Tony.
He shivered, bringing his thumb to his mouth to relive the memory. Tony had rough hands, and Steve had liked them all the better because of it. He would’ve been happy to spend more time exploring them with his tongue and his mouth, and he wondered if Tony would want him to do that in the future again. If he’d demand Steve suck on them. If Tony would thrust them in and out of his mouth.
“What?” Steve asked afterward, his voice gratifyingly hoarse.
Steve blinks and tries to organize his thoughts.  Tony obviously isn’t telling him everything—like why Steve proposed of all things—not that Steve would mind getting to know Tony better—c’mon, Steve, get it together!
me! SHIELD basically
by him?” she asked, blunt and implacable, and he continued to look out, hating that there was a difference.
“I’m doing well.”
, Steve thought as the shield was pelted, but none of them hit his body, which meant the round hadn’t ended yet. Tony was near enough that he was going to have to wait until the last second to extend his legs in order to land and roll out of the way, but if he could get behind another tree, he might still have a chance.
He stared at her mutely, and her eyes softened with sadness.
needed, the only way they could work through the snarl of hurt between them. Tony might’ve convinced himself he wasn’t angry with Steve anymore, but that was because Tony had been exhausted and in physical pain and off-balance from Steve’s confession. The anger wasn’t really gone, just buried under everything else.
When dinner time had come and gone with still no sign of Tony, Steve finally decided to take action.
“Don’t worry, I didn’t make them,” Stark had said, holding a plateful of chocolate chip cookies between them. As if Steve had even considered for a moment that he would’ve cooked. “JARVIS makes the meanest batch of cookies this side of the Mississippi. I wouldn’t trust him with a knife—precision laser-cutting is more his style—but if you’ve got a recipe that calls for measuring cups and a beater, he’s your man. Well, AI really. Computer.”
He made a humiliatingly breathy sound as Tony’s touch turned slicker as it traveled up the back of thigh, and he couldn’t stop the shiver as Tony painted him in trails of come.
honest with me. Don’t tell me what you think I want to hear or think you should say, just … just tell me the truth.”
“Always a way out . . .” he accused, rather than trying to decipher it, and he sounded derisive even in his own ears. “You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero.”
“There’s my good boy,” Tony crooned as Steve shook and gasped, as Tony fucked and fondled him and drew out his orgasm for what felt like forever and ever, a lifetime at least, the pleasure cresting over him in wave after wave. He didn’t understand why it went on as long as it did, maybe because it was a reward, because he was doing what Tony wanted and being praised for it, but everything turned slow and hazy almost, and it was a relief to let go, to get lost in it all, knowing Tony was there to watch over him.
“I am
But even as he prayed the words, he could the voice—
“Which one is mine?” Steve asked, still standing in the doorway like he wasn't sure if he was going to come in.  Tony hated to break it to him, but Steve had already signed the contract, so vacillating at this point was too little, too late.
He lets them explore instead, making sure he doesn’t grip too tightly and never going directly between his Angel’s legs. Other than the wings, his Angel seems to be shaped similarly to Humans, so Tony assumes his sexual organs are located in the same place. Sure, Tony’s touching and tasting, but he’s not
“How quickly they forget!” the guy says, placing the back on his hand on his forehead.  “No worries, though.  You had enough alcohol to knock out an elephant.  Tony Stark at your service, oh-husband-of-mine.”
“Tony,” Steve said, shaking his head slightly, although not enough to dislodge Tony.  “You covered the entire

Steve can feel tears pooling in his eyes at how exposed he is, at knowing Dr. Stark is looking
“That’s not true, Steve.”
“See, this is where the kinkiness comes in,” Tony says, smiling even wider.  “You
“No, really. I want to know.”
Steve had to deliberately loosen his hold on Tony’s fingers, worried that he was going to hurt him with how hard he was gripping.
“No,” Steve groaned, hips spasming, thrusting into Tony’s grip, and Tony swallowed heavily, thinking about the wet drag of fabric against Steve’s cock, thinking about how much that kind of friction had to
Steve goes to sleep with cat-Tony asleep on the pillow next to him, and he wakes with a very naked, very affectionate human-Tony on his chest, licking up Steve’s neck and making rumbly sounds in the back of his throat.
his body—but one of the things he likes the most is his smile, honest and open, and the way it causes his heart to clench and makes him want to smile back.
He tugs the sheet down in Steve’s lap, covering more of his thighs, which would be considered kind in most instances, except Steve almost jackknifes off the table as the material drags over his cock, which still hasn’t gotten the message that nothing else is going to happen and lets out a spurt of precome in doomed hope.
“Anytime.”
. Now come here.”
didn’t know what he’d been planning to say. “We’ve got your baseline of one time per day. That’s your bare minimum. But you have to take into account the circumstances, right? It’s once a day when you’re single, but what about when you’re with someone?” Tony asked, and it was kind of surreal for Steve to hear his own thoughts echoed back to him from Tony of all people.
“Steve …”  Tony sighed again. “Okay.” His head seemed to rest heavier against Steve for an instant before it lifted away. “Okay.”
Hodge had been the kind of Sub who’d gone into the army thinking of personal glory and finding a higher-ranked Dom who’d take care of him.
“Uh huh.”  He finally took his sunglasses off again and nibbled on one of the earpieces as he considered.  “What about the contract?”
“Okay, but this doesn’t change anything,” Steve says, and it’s the last attempt of a drowning man to swim in shark-infested waters.
After a heart-stopping moment, though, his mind rejected that idea. He couldn’t believe that Tony didn’t care about him, that every word and action hadn’t meant what Steve had thought they meant. He wouldn’t. Tony had made too many exceptions for him and had been so obviously hurt by his absence and by his silence while he was on the run.
What?  He looked back from the contents of the refrigerator, and yup, Steve was sitting about three yards away, completely out of Tony’ range.  There was no way he could’ve heard him.  And yet . . .
He blinks, lifting his head from Tony’s hair where he’s … apparently been trying to catch Tony’s scent, oh crap, even though he knows that Tony has to wear blockers for work. He doesn’t know why scenting Tony is more embarrassing than anything else they’ve been doing, but it really, really is.
“You obviously want to be gone, so I’m letting you go.”
“Are you going to be alright?” Tony asks when they reach Steve’s apartment, and the answer is no, but Steve won’t admit it out loud.
” Steve groaned.
(See the end of the chapter for
And then they could finally have that talk that Dr. Saunders had suggested.
Warnings: Supernatural-ish AU
It wasn’t hard to find a newspaper in the trash and find out the date. August 16, 1939. He’d been a kid back in 1939, a snot-nosed punk who thought the world owed him something, and he was going to go out and get it. He hadn’t even known all the shit he didn’t know and hadn’t had a single clue about what was in store for him, him
“Good morning,” he says as he walks into the kitchen.  Bruce waves at him groggily, and Clint grunts from the table where he’s working on the crossword puzzle.  Tony doesn’t answer at all, but he’s huddled over something on the counter, working on who knows what, so Steve’s not surprised.
“Oh.  Sure,” Steve said, and Tony glanced over at the odd tone in his voice, but Steve wasn’t looking at him, was staring down at his plate.
“I’d like you to keep a journal.”
“I got you a present,” Steve protested.
“I know,” he said and sighed, long and drawn out, because he didn’t doubt that much at least, that Steve regretted the way things had gone down. Everything ached, the lines on his back throbbing harshly, and assuming Steve hadn’t moved much—and Tony knew without needing to confirm with JARVIS that he hadn’t—he had to be feeling just as bad, if not worse. “C’mon, let’s … let’s get off the floor and—”
Steve shook his head again, careful not to dislodge Tony’s hand. Tony didn’t owe him anything.
Steve froze when Tony started to move, the tears flowing even faster, sure that Tony was going to pull away at long last. But Tony just turned slightly instead, sitting on the floor and resting his side against the couch, his eyes closing for a second and his breath coming out slowly before he gently began guiding Steve toward him, arranging him so Steve’s back was to the couch and he could burrow against Tony’s chest.
“Not subtle. But then, I’m not exactly a subtle kind of guy, so good for you. I can say honestly and with great vehemence that the way you fill out your jeans is a gift.”
“Tony.  I’m sorry.”
He glanced at the clock, which read 8:14. With any luck, Tony wouldn’t have eaten yet, and they could have dinner and then . . .
“Why are you—?”
“All set then?” Dr. Stark smiles and stands up, going to wash his hands at the sink.
“Well, maybe you should’ve,” Tony said, and Steve nodded jerkily.
“I could just get them by myself?” he suggested, although the idea of setting foot outside of the penthouse seemed incredibly daunting just then. “Save you the trip.”
The words didn’t make his anger disappear, but it was hard to maintain the same degree of combativeness when Fury was being so reasonable all the sudden—which was rather suspicious, if he did say so himself, but they were arguing over Captain America after all instead of their normal subject, i.e. Tony, so maybe that made all the difference.
Steve didn’t look over at Stark. “It’s fine.”
"No."
It was surprising—okay, not really—when he started to get hard in response.
He knew a lot of Doms didn’t give credence to it, but Subs were just as interested in the social hierarchy as they were, more so since a Sub’s life and lifestyle was so dependent on their Dom.  Some of them would take any excuse to put down any potential competition, even someone like him that no Dom would glance twice at since he was too sickly to be worth the effort.
He definitely doesn’t know why he does it again a few nights later.
“You don’t get to decide for me what I want!” Steve said once he had his clothes on, spoiling for a fight, because Steve always reacted in anger when someone told him he couldn’t do something.
It mattered, Steve realized, looking around the living room which was exactly the same as it’d been before he’d left a few days ago. There weren’t even empty spaces to mark where his things used to be, spots that Tony might’ve looked at that made him think about all the holes Steve would leave in his life when he was gone. How could there be when Steve had kept everything in his room? It probably hadn’t even taken long for Tony to pack his belongings. If Steve had moved more of his stuff to New York, maybe he would’ve come back while Tony was still gathering everything together, could’ve had time to talk to Tony before he’d completely made up his mind.
“See, there’s a remedy for that!  Steve, will you go out on a really long date with me that starts with dinner and ends in front of a judge—”
He yelps when Steve’s door starts to open—shit, shit, what the ever-loving hell—and does the only thing he can think of, charging forward.
He’d left him alone then in order to unpack and freshen up, but he’d been back soon enough.
"If that man asks in an impolite manner, then yes."
Not that the idea didn’t have its appeal.  Like any red-blooded Alpha, he’d thought about what it’d be like to be tied to someone, to have him or her squirming on his knot while they both came over and over again, reeking of sex and pheromones and each other’s scent.
“Sit,” Tony said, frowning down at him until he seemed certain Steve would remain where he was. “Alright, if you’re sure. There’s no reason to have the two of us knocking into each other, though. I’ll take care of it.”
“Your Blue Boy has you wrapped around his finger, Thor.  Have a care that he never discovers this and be tempted to abuse that power,” Fandral had said once, his tone light, but his eyes without humor.
Tony smiled reassuringly, but Steve couldn’t smile back.
Tony snarled, his tongue vibrating against Steve’s skin, and Steve cursed and smacked his hand against the ground loudly as he tried to control himself. It didn’t help that Tony rubbed against the tip of Steve’s cock again and again, like he was chasing the taste of Steve’s precome, and that thought had him shoving Tony’s head away in a panic before he made the whole argument pointless.
The thought is so strange and disorienting that he barely responds when Tony kisses him and doesn’t move when Tony pulls out other than to let his legs fall to the bed, splaying out, and Steve blinks up at the ceiling, still breathing hard, his body buzzing.
What do you mean it's almost been a year since I updated this? What? Who? What?
At least there was an everything
He shifted restlessly, not even realizing he was doing it until a pang shot up his legs, and he tried to mask the wince—
Stark muttered to himself and JARVIS at first, calibrating and adjusting and who knew what else, and Steve used the time to take in all the things that had changed. Everything that had changed.
Tony had said, and it had been the first time he’d ever said anything like that. Even now, Steve could feel himself blush at the sincerity in Tony’s voice—although it could also be blamed on his response.
Dr. Reynolds was the one to turn towards Stark, his expression carefully neutral. “I see. Well, then,” he said, rising and smiling at Steve again, although it seemed slightly less pleased than before. “Are there any bruises or abrasions or cuts that you’d like me to take a look at?” he asked, washing his hands at the sink.
Many, many, many thanks to the awesome, wonderful MetaAllu for beta'ing this chapter! *blows kisses* It's the only chapter that's beta'd right now. >_>
hadn’t heard from him. Not one word. Steve hadn’t called him because he’d chosen not to.
“You already—it’s
“Are you sure you don’t want me to take some more days off?” Steve asked, even though he was already dressed and getting ready to head in for his first day at SHIELD headquarters.
One more second.
-----
It’s all very confusing.
Why would Tony do it? Because he trusted Steve.
So while he hadn’t moved in with Tony with the intention of being bad, he was starting to feel like that was how he’d been acting anyway.
“Go get the ottoman,” Tony said suddenly, making Steve flinch in surprise, and he nearly said, “Yes, Tony,” the habit of responding when Tony asked for anything deeply ingrained in him. He barely managed to keep back the words, and it shook him, how easily he might have done something wrong, might have destroyed whatever progress he’d made that day so far at earning Tony’s forgiveness because he’d been distracted. He had to be careful, had to
Steve just didn’t get it. Pepper had been right: Steve still needed him. His first Dom. He needed someone that he could reasonably trust, and after enough time and distance, he’d decided his best bet was Tony. That was all this was. Steve had found a shiny new bicycle and decided to go around for a while with the training wheels on. Once he was comfortable, those training wheels would come right off, and then Steve would leave again.
“JARVIS is my AI. He’s a computer—he’s actually much more than a computer—but for your purposes, you can think of him as a computer. If you need something when I’m not around, you can ask him. Say hello to Steve, JARVIS.”
Alright. From the footfalls, he could tell there were the standard four people coming their way, which in and of itself wouldn’t be a problem, but he’d have to be careful to avoid letting one of them sound the alarm.
Why would Tony do that? He’d already altered the suit to minimize any potential damage to Steve and giving him even this much control seemed—
“That’s better,” Tony said, leaning back.
without him even noticing.
,” he corrects quickly, eyes going wide. Shit, he can’t believe he let that slip out. “Sorry, I mean, hi, Tony.”
. He did, he thought, squeezing his eyes closed, refusing to wonder whether Tony ever would now.
For a second, it’s like he can’t breathe, the pain is so great, and he has to grab onto the counter to keep steady.
was a playboy? The last person Steve had kissed had been Sharon, and they hadn’t even gone on a date before deciding to end things because of everything that was going on.
Steve had the mental image of trying to get away from the fucking machine with the dildo still attached, of the dildo malfunctioning somehow because of it, and he flinched.
, and Steve hoped it would give him comfort as he adjusted to a world that had gotten used to him being gone.
“Or maybe it was a ‘please find other places to bite, soft, delicate places that have never had the threat of teeth anywhere near them,’” Tony said, moving his hands once again, this time to push Steve’s thighs open so he could fit in between. He didn’t bite him at all this time, just spread him open and lapped at a spot on the inside of one firm cheek, and Steve froze, tension humming through him.
“Okay, I’m going to start with one finger to relax the muscle,” Dr. Stark says, and Steve grits his teeth together to keep from making any noise when Dr. Stark slides into him. It’s not enough; it’s nowhere near enough.
Even the rules he had laid down hadn’t been unreasonable, even if Steve didn’t like them. He hadn’t demanded Steve walk three steps behind him, or be silent unless spoken to directly, or even to kneel at his feet in public, something Steve had seen plenty of Subs do in his day. He hadn’t even discussed punishment, and Steve didn’t know if that was because he honestly thought he wouldn’t disobey or because of some other reason, but it made Steve want to respect the trust given him and follow Stark’s rules; simultaneously, it also made him want to break each and every one of them, because who was Stark to assume that Steve would bow down to his law?
“But I don’t!  And neither do you!”
Fury watched him for a second before letting out a sigh. “As I said already, I’m handling it. Reynolds won’t ever be in the same room as Steve again, let alone treat him, and the next time he comes in for an exam—”
He still went on missions, and he made an effort to meet up with Sam and Bucky as much as he could, the other Avengers as well when they were nearby. He even reached out to Peter Parker, but while Peter was polite, he wasn’t interested in establishing a relationship with Steve, and Steve didn’t try to push. He understood Happy was stepping into Tony’s shoes for Peter, and he didn’t try to intrude, although he told Happy that he was available for Peter if he ever needed him.
If this had been real—if he’d asked Steve to sign his contract and Steve had agreed—things would have been different.  They would’ve just gotten back from celebrating with their friends and would barely have been able to keep their hands off each other.  He’d have brought Steve home and taken him to his bedroom,
Steve blinked. “What?” he asked faintly. He must have misheard. Tony couldn’t have said—
Which was why he groaned when Tony said, “Unbutton your pants,” and it took him three tries before he could get it right.
He’d thought he’d gotten to the point where he didn’t automatically assume the worst about Stark, but he’d been wrong.
Even knowing all the individual steps they’d taken, he still didn’t understand how they’d gotten to the point where Steve could possibly believe that.
Of course, he hadn’t known that fact until Tony had been unmasked right in front of him.  Prior to discovering Tony was Iron Man, Steve had always had a bit of a crush on the other man and had made up ridiculous excuses in order to stop and chat with Tony whenever he came to SHIELD headquarters.
For the tumblr prompt: Stevetony with bottom tony and lots of fluff please?
did all the work,” Natasha said, raising an eyebrow. “And by work, you mean standing around and looking pretty to keep the target occupied.”
Tony frowned, bouncing lightly on the cushion.  “Too hard.  You know I like taking naps on the couch, and there's no way I'll be able to fall asleep on this.  And the fabric’s scratchy, too.  It’s like you don’t want me to be rested, Steve,” he accused.
Evidently, Dr. Stark does, because he picks up where he left off, and Steve manages to control himself for the next part of the exam—until he hears Dr. Stark pull out a stirrup, and then Steve releases enough slick that he semi-seriously wonders if it’s going to start sliding across the leather because of how wet he’s making it.
“In the living room,” JARVIS said, and Tony let out a long breath, the voice that had whispered that Steve was already gone, that Steve had left him yet again, going momentarily quiet.
Speaking of which, fuck. What’s he doing in here? The bathroom’s off the living room.
come, and he—
He crept to the corner, shield in hand, and waited.
, and it reminded him constantly of how things had changed.
“Tony,” Steve said, and he had no right to look like that, all surprised hurt and disappointment.
Tony could feel the couch pressed firmly against his arm, but it still seemed like the room was tilting dangerously.
Joe was so used to everyone knowing about it that he hadn’t mentioned it until it was too late, but whatever, the SHIELD agent was going to be fine.
Tony, though, Tony did try. He’d offered his home to Steve, kept his distance, never hinted that Steve owed him anything. That had all been Steve.
“Can we—” He turned slightly, pressing his back against the couch in order to focus. “I want to talk about this,” he said, struggling to get every word out, his voice sounding tinny to his own ears. “But I can’t. Right now. Can we—?”
Until that fateful,
“Maybe a little bit…?”
“Can you be serious—”
“Said by the person who did
“And why would we do that?” Steve asked, only pausing long enough for the springs to settle before he resumed sketching.
?” he said, nearly shouting, and apparently he’d gotten over the paranoia. “If you think for one second that I’m going to drag Steve into another ambush, then it’s time for you to retire as head of an army of spies, because you are batshit insane! Steve isn’t setting foot on SHIELD territory until I have a fucking guarantee that something like this won’t happen again! That
Of course that meant that Tony let out a huff and started straightening his hind legs, and Steve yelped, toes sliding against the floor as he rushed to shift his weight from his knees to his feet, Tony’s knot forcing him to lift his ass higher into the air.
“I’ve always liked a little predicament bondage,” Tony said, and he patted one of the sides running along Steve’s inner legs. “The machine is going to exert pressure outward until about here,” he said, putting his hand out to demonstrate, which meant Steve’s legs would be open about 120 degrees at the maximum width. Steve could comfortably do 180 degrees, could do more honestly, but he was relieved it wouldn’t be put to the test.
doing it—but if he didn’t, then what did that mean for the two of them?
Tony had said he shouldn’t worry about reciprocation, but that was impossible. He didn’t know about nowadays, but when he was growing up, Doms came more frequently than Subs. It was just one of those things, a way for Subs to serve, and Steve . . . he wasn’t going to be a bad Sub, didn’t
He remembered the moment it hit him that Steve wasn’t going to contact him.
Steve doesn’t realize he’s put out a hand to steady himself until he’s holding onto the doorframe, but he hadn’t been ready to hear something like that come out of Tony’s mouth.
“It’s just …”
The Colossus was the first electric programmable computer and was first demonstrated in December 1943. The Colossus was created to help the British code breakers read encrypted German messages.
“Of course it is!” Tony said, his hands flying up in exasperation, and Steve immediately missed them. “You tell me it hurts if you don’t come, and then expect me to believe that throwing in all of this—” Tony said, waving at himself, “—doesn’t change your minimum? I mean, I suppose it’s possible, but even discounting my incredible good looks, sex with another person is very different than sex with yourself, and without data to back you up, I refuse to believe it won’t alter things. So, yes, I do think it’s important, since what kind of Dom would I be if I didn’t keep you healthy and happy?”
Instead of hitting the button that would take him back home, he let his arm drop, and he leaned against the side of the building, his legs unsteady.
“Ready?” Tony asked, smiling and looking so pleased to leave the penthouse that the suggestion they put off going down until tomorrow withered on Steve’s tongue.
“I don’t . . .” Steve took a breath. “I’ve never tried to figure that out.”
“Is it that I like getting smacked around sometimes?”
“—stick my collar around your neck?”
this time, looking down as if from some great height.
to contract with him,” he said at last, and if he came off as defensive, it was because that was how he felt.
“JARVIS, where’s Steve right now?”
He honestly didn’t know why he didn’t call Tony to tell him that night, too numb, too shocked by it all perhaps. Tony definitely didn’t deserve to hear about it from anyone else, however, and Steve resolved to tell him after his meeting with Pierce, to make the time, no matter what else was going on.
of him, and he wants to touch his cock so badly that his fingers are cramping. He doesn’t, though, barely even twitches when Dr. Stark swabs his cervix, and it’s not what Dr. Stark is doing so much as the possibility of what he
“Yes, Dr. Stark,” he says, and he can’t seem to look away from eyes that seem much darker than they had in the waiting room as Dr. Stark gets closer and closer.
For all that Steve wants it, and he does, he wants to lay here with his legs open and Dr. Stark’s fingers inside of him forever, he still instinctively tries to close his legs when Dr. Stark pushes in. It’s nowhere near as painful as when he first started, but it still feels like Dr. Stark’s fingers are bigger than they have any right—
A lot of responses popped into his head, from “I told you, things are different now” to “You damn well better believe it” to even “I’d have to give a fuck about what you do in order to tell you to stop” but he didn’t say any of them.
Steve feels so good that it’s not long before all of Tony’s tentacles are in a frenzy as he gets closer to orgasm. The two on Steve’s chest are almost slapping against his skin as they pull on and off, his nipples bright red and swollen. The one in his cock is going twice as fast as Tony’s hectocotyli, the movement much smaller and more precise, but Tony can feel how large Steve’s cock has become, burning hot and filled with blood. The three tentacles keeping them afloat are churning the water around them madly, and the last two are nudging against Steve’s opening and thrashing around in frustration, so much so that they actually spank Steve accidentally, but Steve just groans wetly and tightens so much around Tony that he does it again.
Except Dr. Stark has never been cold, just a bit reserved. As if he were being careful to keep himself under control.
He didn’t hear her sigh, but he could imagine it. He knew he wasn’t the easiest of patients.
Hmmm, maybe he should’ve created a theme song?  Had JARVIS call out “Fatality!” or something equally ridiculous every time he—anyway, getting distracted.
to let himself accept what Steve was saying, but—
He likes to go around demanding affection from all the Avengers, winding between his chosen victim’s feet, tripping them if necessary and even nipping at their ankles until they pick him up and start petting him.  Then he purrs loudly and smugly, flexing his claws in warning if they seem like they’re getting ready to stop giving him the attention he deserves.
He couldn’t truthfully answer no either, however.
He’d never enjoyed it quite like this, however, the weight of Tony’s gaze like hands roaming over his body, the knowledge that there was almost nothing Tony could ask him in this moment that he would say no to making him feel almost helpless to his and Tony’s desire.
Steve throws himself at the gunman, dodging the first bullet and deflecting the second with a—is that a shield?  The assassin doesn’t have time for a third, and
cared.
“Tony, what—?”
"Must you?"
Yes. Tony knew exactly how well that had gone.
“Maybe he doesn’t mean to do it,” she said, so carefully blank that it obvious how likely she thought that was, “but he does it anyway, and what are you going to do when he leaves again? When this whole learning period of his is over?”
“What?” Steve asked, completely forgetting for a second that he hadn’t answered Tony yet in the face of Tony’s words. Wait up? Did that mean—?
“Alright,” Tony said softly, and Steve wondered at the tiredness he heard in his voice until he remembered that Tony hadn’t been sleeping, that the only reason they were in the position they were in now was because he’d planned on putting Tony to bed. He probably shouldn’t have let things get this far, considering all that, he thought with a twinge of shame at his selfishness, but it was too late to back away now without making giving Tony the wrong idea and possibly straining their relationship further.
“Are you sure?”
They smell really, really good.
“Fuck,” Tony breathed, swallowing hard.  “Sorry.  I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to make it harder on you,” he said, and while Steve knew it was true, he noticed how Tony’s eyes were riveted to Steve’s stomach, could see precum welling at the tip of Tony’s cock.
“Oh, don’t ever feel like you have to apologize for getting hard around me. I take it as a compliment.” Tony grinned and winked. “But back to my question. Just once a day, or do you have to come more frequently?”
“How about we’re not even dating!”
“Sometimes. When the mood—” He bit back the instinctual response to be snide. “Just sometimes,” he finished a moment later, gentler than before, and it wasn’t a real answer, but then, Tony didn’t think either of them were ready for a real answer.
He’s feels grateful when Tony curses and comes, humiliatingly so, and it almost feels like another orgasm, he’s so filled with pride and pleasure, although nowhere as powerful as the first. He doesn’t … that’s never happened to him before, he’s never felt like that before, but the thought of Tony coming inside of him, of being
Tony watched with interest as Steve hesitated.  The thing about locking the two of them together was that it required some cooperation on Tony’s part unless Steve was planning to get rough, something Tony was betting he wasn’t willing to do.  At least, not with someone who wasn’t posting a threat of any kind. Those muscles couldn’t all be for show after all.
Except . . .
The only way it could be better would be if Dr. Stark didn’t have any gloves on, if it were just bare skin instead of the unnatural smoothness of vinyl. It’s a funny thing to regret, considering Steve normally enjoys the gloves
“It’s really him?” he dimly heard Peter ask, his voice cracking like he was a teenager again, and the hope in his words was heartbreaking. “It’s really you?” he asked the—
“What do you mean?” Steve asked, finally lifting his head as he tried to make sense of Tony’s question. Was Tony asking if he was thinking about him instead of just himself now?
Also! The wonderful
I wanted to give a huge thank you to
He squeezed his hand one more time as a reminder before lifting it off Steve and grabbing the shower head.
But he hadn’t even thought about it. He’d followed Tony and done what he’d said, and he hadn’t even thought about
He swallowed. “To be fair, I never came out and told him how I feel.”
It’s almost too easy to understand. Ever since meeting Steve, it feels as if he has to touch him, like the world is darker somehow when they aren’t connected.
releasing, he realizes, everything wet underneath him—is beyond obscene.
He stood frozen when they realized Tony was falling, not flying down, and his legs nearly buckled when the Hulk was able to grab Tony in mid-air before rolling him to the ground.  Thor reached Tony before he could, but he was the first to drop to his knees next to Tony, to press his ear against Tony’s chest and listen desperately for any sign of life.
“That’s it, Steve. Just take it,” Tony said, his voice distracted and almost condescending, and oh
Still, if he’d had a nickel for every time he’d heard someone say that an Omega would help him “settle down,” he’d have . . .
to be able to see every last thing Dr. Stark does to him and wishes Dr. Stark would put a mirror up so Steve doesn’t miss a single second of it.
“Is something wrong?”
The nervousness moved to the background as a surge of loneliness swept through him. He missed Tony—
Steve’s apparently much colder than he’d realized, because the line of slick that drips down his leg is burning hot.
and it doesn’t seem like that’s going to change any time soon. Fuck, this wasn’t how he imagined asking Tony in after coffee. He’d wanted to be … not sexy exactly, but attractive. Appealing. At this point, however, he’d honestly settle for anything above “complete and utter mess.”
“Wait,” Tony said, holding up his hand to stop Steve. “Keep them from becoming real ones. What do you mean by that?”
But yeah. Talking. Some coffee. Light flirting and that’s it.
with us being wallflowers all week! We’ve been good, staying under the radar and taking time to bond and all that, but the honeymo—but that’s all over now!”
his fault for leaving you and then coming back when he knows it’s going to mess you up.”
. Steve eyes clenched shut, his legs spasming as the one in back pushed into him.
He still didn’t understand what had caused it and had to forcibly push down the fear that Tony had been upset by his confession, that he didn’t want Steve’s love and rightly so.
Steve tears at Tony’s shirt with his free hand, something Tony would normally be down with, but what with having just been shot and all—
“So best two out of three?” Tony asked and rose back into the air.
All of Tony’s work. Gone.
They’d started to achieve a balance back before everything had gone wrong, and maybe it was just a matter of time until they found it again, but in the meantime, its absence made him unsettled.
He can’t believe he’s late.
The growl Tony made then had Steve squeezing his eyes closed as he scrambled to roll over quickly, his stomach clenching in excitement and something that skittered the border of fear. Tony sounded feral, beastly, and Steve knew he was angry at being pushed away. The thought shouldn’t have made him shudder, but he did anyway, some primal part of him recognizing the danger and wanting to cower in the face of it, to submit, and he brought his legs up underneath him, raising himself up to his elbows and knees, offering himself to Tony.

“No. You can’t. See you soon, Steve.”
Steve has seen the way Dr. Stark interacts with his staff and with other patients, and he knows he’s funny and smart and kind. Steve also knows that he’s unbearably attracted to him and that no matter how inappropriately excited Steve might get during an exam, he’d want to talk to Dr. Stark even if he weren’t in the medical field. What he doesn’t know, however, is how Dr. Stark feels about him.
He was almost finished with his lunch when he heard, “Well, well, look who’s here,” and he looked up to smile at Natasha.
Tony as a kitten is surprisingly adorable.
So he didn’t understand why he flinched the way he did at the pass of Tony’s fingers.
“Um, two days ago.”
him aware of it. Article after article called him “brilliant,” praised his “incredible mind,” claimed he was an “unparalleled genius.” Companies paid Stark to consult on their projects; universities asked him to give speeches to their graduating students.
They talk a bit more before heading inside, nothing particularly deep, but Steve appreciates it all the same. Their version of normal has been pretty skewed, and this is the first time they’ve had a conversation without Steve feeling incredibly embarrassed or turned on, or, more than likely, both incredibly embarrassed
“I found you,” his Angel says, his voice rough but his eyes shining with triumph. And then he kisses Tony.
Tony,” Steve begged, his voice cracking, despairing, and Tony didn’t doubt that if he could see Steve’s face clearly, he’d find traces of tears. It made him wonder what Steve would do if he teased him for real, edged him for hours on end. Considering that temper of his, would he get angry? Or cling to Tony and weep? He’d beg, Tony knew, would beg and do it so prettily that Tony would be tempted to give in.
And that was it.  He was done.  He was
“I only have so many hands,” Tony said, taking a huge bite. “Although that is a thought,” he said, turning contemplative, although it looked rather silly when he took another bite and his cheeks bulged with food. “JARVIS—”
“I’m fine,” he says faintly, even though he’s not, because what else
“So uh, hey, I’m not sure if you’d be interested, but I could actually lend you a pair of scrubs, if you felt like changing into dry clothes. We’ve got a few sets lying around for emergencies, and you could just bring them back whenever you got the chance … .”
“I’m not hurt,” Steve managed to say, but it came out strangled as Tony got up on his elbow, as he pulled Steve closer until his legs were hitting the mattress.
It started during their first meeting when Dr. Stark had paused as Steve filled up the room with the smell of his arousal, shoulders hunched up in shame, and instead of joking about it or about how wet Steve was, or saying anything dismissive about omegas, Dr. Stark had kept going like nothing had happened. He hadn't acted like it was weird or that Steve was something to be gawked at, hadn't assumed that since Steve reacted physically it meant he wanted anything sexual from him—although he does, now, very much—nor has he ever. He treats Steve like any other patient with his own particular brand of idiosyncrasies, and he just takes care of Steve, respectfully and gently.
Okay. He breathed. In. Out. Okay. It was time.
And while he knew that wasn’t the way Tony meant it, it
the shower
Five more minutes. He wasn’t a sometimes-masochist for nothing. He could suffer for five more minutes.
“We had a good run. I’ve been honored to be your Dom,” Tony said, his voice easy but his eyes shuttered, and he was … he was leaving him. Or asking Steve to leave. Either way, Tony was ending their relationship without any kind of warning, and Steve knew that he hadn’t called, but it’d only been for three days, and out of all things he’d imagined would happen when he got back, this hadn’t even been a glimmer on the horizon. “I assumed you probably didn’t want to get back on a plane right away, so I had JARVIS make a reservation for tonight, and my jet will take you back to DC tomorrow whenever you’re ready—”
that. Old lessons died hard, though. “I like to get tossed around sometimes.”
He didn’t want to tell Steve that he was making sure that there wouldn’t be a second tomorrow that Steve wasn’t thinking about him, no matter who else was there, so instead he said, “I thought you’d like to give bondage a little try.”
“I know what a safeword is for.”
“Well, that and my good looks,” Tony teased, which was unfair since Tony had a streak of gray in his hair that did things to Steve’s stomach he could never have anticipated. “But it was a whole system of twins basically. Everyone is born with a twin, and they can only have offspring after a four-way sexual fertilization. Murdering half the population would’ve eventually resulted in complete genocide if Bruce hadn’t brought them back, but since I was the one to finally get rid of Thanos …” He shrugged.
. Maybe the state.
Steve felt the give in the metal of the utensils he was holding and hurriedly straightened them back up.
And then everything changed.
nervous,” he admitted, and it still felt uncomfortable to talk, but he wondered how much of that was because Tony had said he owed him three days of silence and how much because he dreaded going over all the ways in which he’d hurt Tony.
“What made you agree to the dissolution?” she asked compassionately, and he frowned at her.
“C’mon, let’s get you changed then.”
The feeling only lasted until he started getting ready to shower. Alone. Tony was in his own bathroom, and he’d told Steve, “Meet you in 15 at the elevator,” before closing the door. That had carried Steve into his own room, but now that Tony was out of his sight, he realized
It’s with something like despair that he gets a mental image of Dr. Stark’s whole hand sliding into him, and a second later, Steve swears he can feel the gush of slick even around Dr. Stark’s fingers. He hadn’t thought the wet, thick sounds of Dr. Stark rubbing and reaching inside of him could become even more obscene, but he’d been wrong.
He regretted telling Tony he wasn’t interested in men, wished that he could turn back time and snatch the words out of his mouth before they could pollute the air. It didn’t matter that it’d been the truth as he’d known it back then; it had led to so much heartbreak that his chest still ached when he thought about it, a phantom pain that made him want to seek Tony out, just to prove that he could, that he was allowed to, that if he reached out to touch, Tony would not only welcome it but would touch him back.
Interesting.
“I’m assuming squat.  I won’t stop you if you want to walk away.”
Tony came up to him and put his hand on Steve’s bowed head, and Steve had thought his heart couldn’t break much more, but the way Tony’s fingers trembled as they stroked through his hair proved him wrong.
Steve learned a lot about himself in the next few weeks. He learned that he actually had very little patience when it came to … many things; that Tony could get him hard and aching with just a filthy, filthy smile; that pain could be very good indeed—and he would never forget being bent over Tony’s lap that first time, trying to muffle his sounds into the cushions as Tony brought his hand down over and over again—that he hated and loved nipple clamps in equal measure; and that the minimum number of orgasms he needed in one day could go up after all.
“You didn’t know Natasha and I were on a mission together?” he asked flatly. It’d been his third mission. Steve was much more comfortable with computers now, but the objective had required a level of expertise that he hadn’t achieved yet.
This might be all he ever had, he thought, and squeezed his eyes tight, tugging Steve in even closer.
The thing was, Tony got it.  He really did.  It was a fucked up situation for the both of them, and Steve was exerting his independence in whatever way he could.  Maybe it wasn’t the smartest move to pull on a new Dom, particularly since Steve had no way of knowing how he’d react, but then again, if Steve riled him up enough to make Tony lash out, well, that’d prove that Tony was a major fucking dick, just like everyone else, worse even, and at least Steve would know.
Steve nearly yells into his ear at the sensation, and Tony swears they actually rise up a bit into the air as Steve’s wings beat and flail.
He feels guilty for making Tony take care of his mess, for not even being able to help because he has to go to the bathroom and arrange things in order to keep from being arrested for indecency, and just for being the way he is around Tony. It manages to kill the arousal at long last, and it leaves him drained and unhappy.
“Like
“I’m not saying I should build you a fucking machine or anything,” Tony said, and Steve’s jaw dropped a little, all his thoughts scattering. “Although that is a possibility. Would you like that, Steve?” Tony asked, tilting his head to the side. “If I built something like that for you?”
“Don’t worry about it. I’m just glad I finally remembered. Now let me set this up, and then we move on to the next part.”
“Can you look at me?” Tony asked in a raspy voice, and Steve wanted to say no. Please. Don’t make me.
“Because I didn’t handle—”
He felt ... not numb exactly, but detached. Drained. It was a struggle to stay where he was instead of finding somewhere safe to curl up and lick his wounds, let alone take care of Steve.
Tony paused.
he was having strange thoughts when Stark had touched him more in the past thirty or so minutes than he’d been touched in months. Even with the Serum, he was only a man in the end, prone to the same failings, and he was lonely. He’d been lonely for a long time. And as a result, he’d let things go too far. They were training after all, and if touch wasn’t permitted here, then where was it? He shouldn’t have started grappling with Stark, though, should’ve stuck to throwing punches, even if the brushes of Stark hands and arms and legs had been like comfort almost, even if all Steve had wanted was to feel a little more contact for just a little bit longer.
*is also realistic, however, and when has this fic ever cooperated, so if we hit 100K, then we hit 100K* *sighs*
He didn't quite know how to finish that sentence, but Tony saw it for the victory it was and smiled widely before finally helping to set up the camp in relative silence—for Tony anyway—willing to be good now that he knew he’d get what he wanted later.
But the idea of pinning Steve down and finger-fucking him was appealing too.
It makes him feel incredibly guilty, but Steve just doesn’t like him.
He skimmed the news, keeping one ear open for signs that Stark had finished his calls. He was too preoccupied to concentrate on any particular article for long and checked on the tense state of international affairs more out of habit than with any real purpose. He ended up reading the link to “Stark Industries: Then and Now” twice before he understood it.
“Of course. I’m happy to do whatever I can to make this better for you,” Dr. Stark says, and Steve has to swallow back the first five responses that immediately come to mind. “Let me just wash my hands one more time, and then we’ll be ready to go.”
What is he thinking?
What Tony did know was that out of all of them, he was probably having the easiest time with the whole awkward discussion having been in the public eye his whole life, so he was used to having people know all sorts of crazy, supposedly private things about him.  And when push came to shove, he could walk away, because he didn’t need to waste his time getting a recalcitrant Sub to bend knee when he could snap his fingers and have a willing one licking his boots in about ten seconds flat.
He didn’t reply.
The amount of slick he releases then—that he’s
“There’s a condition, a pretty serious one actually, that causes omegas to false lactate. If we catch it early enough, it’s not a problem, but if we don’t …” Dr. Stark frowns. “I think the best course of action here would be for me to massage your breasts and nipples in order to see if you secrete any liquid. Considering how sensitive you are, it might hurt a little, but I highly recommend you allow me to try.”
Even if was the first time Tony had ever used one.
“Tony,
Warning: More breath control play. This is probably going to be a theme now, so this will be the last time I warn about it (unless I write a really extreme scene, which I don't see myself writing at this point, but just in case).
He made sure to clean up after himself, and then he went to stand by Tony’s doorway again, his hands clasped in front of him.

“I think what I deserve—what we
“No, Tony.”  Except, apparently not this time.
Thor could recall when he first began to view Loki as more than a burden, when Loki’s quick way with words turned from being something he scorned to something he admired.  It’d been during one of their annual visits, three hours of cold and inactivity as Loki read from some heavy tome and Thor seethed over the injustice of his companions going on a week-long hunting trip without him.
“Come here,” he panted, grabbing Steve’s face and pulling him down for one kiss, for two, kept kissing him until he felt drunk with it and then kissed him some more.
“I never claimed to be in the market for a Sub either.”
“Yes,” he said, setting down his drink, which he’d been nursing just to give his hands something to do. “You?”
“You doing okay?” Tony asked, once Steve started looking more alert.
There hadn’t been an ounce of hesitation in Tony’s actions. He’d been confident that Steve would enjoy everything he did, and he’d been right. Steve had more than enjoyed them. He’d been thinking about them ever since whenever he had a spare moment, and even when he didn’t, random thoughts intruding without his permission. Tony made him want things he hadn’t had in a very long time, and it was almost unfair that it’d happened right before a mission, because he couldn’t give it half the focus he wanted to.
Apparently, he had been, however, and what had Steve expected? For Tony to drop everything now that he was back?
His jaw clenched. Apparently, Dr. Saunders had decided subtly wasn’t working.
; they were ticking hormonal time bombs, and Tony didn’t want to be anywhere in the detonation radius.
Steve’s stomach clenched, his thoughts about Hill scattering, and it was all he could do to remain in place. Tomorrow morning? What about the rest of the night?
“This isn’t permanent?  Tony will change back by tonight?” he asks, crouching down and tentatively reaching one hand out.
He’d toyed with idea of giving up killing, considered taking up, hell, knitting, or building a better spacecraft than anything NASA could put together and going to outer space, and given enough time, perhaps he would've even done it.  But then he and Pepper had gotten into a big fight, and she'd made a passing comment about his problems with intimacy, and suddenly, it'd become a thing, and he'd been driving home an hour later, still fuming.  He’d thought he’d been doing rather well actually.  He had Pepper.  And Rhodey.  And he couldn’t forget Happy.  That was three right there.  Three was more than luck or coincidence.
It was a dark and stormy night.  Or at least it would be, once the storm arrived.  Steve had already gathered candles and a flashlight in preparation for any potential power outages.  He loved thunderstorms, had ever since he was a kid, and he’d exchange a few hours without power to be able to enjoy a thunderstorm each and every time.
“You’re fine,” Dr. Stark says, and maybe it’s his imagination, but it feels like he looks Steve up and down in a way that’s not purely professional. It’s probably just wishful thinking, though, so Steve doesn’t let it fluster him. “Or at least, that’s the goal. Now why don’t you tell me what’s going on. The nurse mentioned hot flashes and excessive slick production, is that right?”
“No, ma’am,” he said and didn’t complain at the desperate clutch of her fingers. “We didn’t forget.”
“Mr. Stark—”
“Research,” he repeated disbelievingly. “Well, that’s great, but—we never really talked about discipline before.”
Sure, he’d mentioned that he’d made other plans, but Steve hadn’t thought he was serious.
Tony took a deep breath and promised himself that he wouldn’t let Steve rile him up.
Sorry for how long it's been, guys. These aren't easy chapters to write right now.
as he stared at Tony, “and Nick’s been after me to stop moping and come by for months now, so I thought I’d finally do it.  Look where it got me though.”
But all Tony says is, "Interesting," and he hums a little as he takes his drink and walks out the room.
He was just glad they were together.
“I’m visiting a friend of mine up in Rathburn,” Steve said, mentioning the town two hours north.  “A mutual friend of ours died a little over a year ago,” he said, his voice rough, his gaze disturbingly
He took a deep breath before switching over, slapping on his most annoying grin as the screen filling with Fury’s face. “Well, if it isn’t the Commander of SHIELD himself. What can I do for you, Fury?”
Tony pulled Steve closer to him, heedless of the pain it caused him, tentatively at first but then with greater strength as Steve let himself be held.
Kissing Steve feels right in a way he can’t explain, like it’s more important than talking or breathing, like he’ll never need anything else as long as he has this. He thinks he could be satisfied with just kissing him for hours on end.
Also, it was just my birthday, so please keep the angry comments to a minimum. *cough* Feel free to leave nice comments, however, and all the kudos! On all my fics, really. >_>
“I know.”
“I … realized … that I’d forgotten. Not that it was your first time being punished by a Dom. But how it felt the first time you were punished by a Dom. Yesterday was a lot harder for you than you let on, wasn’t it?” Tony asked, and Steve could feel the prick of tears at how gentle his voice was.
“I’m pretty sure that just lying in your sleeping bag—
Before she could respond, the screen flashed with an alert for an incoming call. Fury.
He’s already humiliated himself so many times in front of Tony, and Tony had still wanted to go out with him, but there’s the very real possibility that if Steve tells him what’s wrong, it’ll be the last straw. That Tony will decide Steve’s some kind of over-sexed maniac that needs counseling to get over his addiction, maybe even medical intervention and treatment—
Assuming he knew that he
.  He tries to remember what he’d done yesterday to end up this way, but all he gets are vague flashes of laughing and bright lights and strong arms holding him up, and that’s not helpful at all.  Had something happened?  A mission gone wrong maybe?  Is he dying?
of so much space?
“Fuck, it’s bright,” Tony said, lowering his sunglasses just enough to squint at the window. “After a night like that, I’m in the mood for cinnamon rolls. JARVIS, order me some from that place that I like.”
“I never said I wanted to break our contract,” and there something in Steve’s voice that made Tony pause but only for a second.
Telling Steve that being anxious about Tony walking away was still a valid reason to use his safeword seemed almost cruel right then. So he pushed it off for later, too exhausted and just fucking unhappy to face it.
“And I don’t want to lie to your parents!” he said, scandalized, and glared at the way Tony’s lips turned up.
to have it with? Thankful that I didn’t force—”
“Steve,” he said. At least he thought he did. He wasn’t quite sure. “What are you—?”
But something changed with his submission, either the angle maybe, or Tony had realized he wasn’t going anywhere, or maybe just that his body had rearranged itself enough that it stopped hurting so much, but Tony’s frantic thrusts started to feel … better. Not quite good, but they hinted at something that
For now, though, Tony adjusted the shower heads again so they wouldn’t wash away the soap too quickly but still provided enough water to make everything slick and re-lathered his hands. Then, wanting to give Steve warning but also wanting to make him relax a little, he said, “I think I’m in love with your ass,” ignoring the voice in his heart that said,
His thighs clenched, and he let his other hand drift lower.
. And while Tony hadn’t set out to deny him in the beginning, it now felt like this

But he knew that he wouldn’t be able to stop thinking about it now.

with his empty promises and his apologies that came too late and always made everything worse.
It felt … fine, he supposed, moving it around tentatively. It burned, since he hadn’t really stretched himself, and it was nothing like whenever Tony was the one using it on him, but then, Steve wasn’t really aroused, so he supposed that had a lot to do with it. He was almost relieved in a way. He’d been vaguely worried that it’d turn into something about him, about his wants, his needs. But this was going to be all about pleasing Tony.
He can’t really blame them for freezing, though. Kissing his Angel is like nothing he’s ever experienced before. He almost feels jealous of his tentacles getting to taste him first, but they haven’t had a chance to experience his mouth yet, so if anything, they should be jealous of him.
because he couldn’t do a backflip into a triple-somersault double-layout what-the-hell-ever incredibly painful looking split thing, and then come bouncing back and two seconds later and have him down on the ground.
Steve shook his head again.
“Showers were mandatory by the end anyway; we both smelled like a distillery, and I accidentally knocked over a full bottle, so there was alcohol everywhere.  And yes, it was together, but that’s just because I wasn’t sure you wouldn’t fall and break your head or something.  Although for future reference, you’re all hands when you’re drunk.  Not normally attractive in a person, although, you know,
“Now, we’ve talked about watersports before, and it fell into your ‘willing to try but not terribly excited about’ bucket, however, that was a while ago. If you’ve changed your mind and this, hell, if anything I’ve told you about, is a hard ‘no,’ then we’ll do something else. Punishment isn’t an excuse to ignore your limits, and I do have a backup plan ready. I won’t hold it against you.”
, and when the universe had decided it wasn’t done playing with him, it had then demanded he live with the aftermath.
of him, as deep as he can go. It’s the most Steve is ever going to get. Of course his body is going to hold onto him however it can.
Followed by a teeny, tiny prick of disappointment.
Tony looked at him for a long time, his eyes moving from Steve’s face to his hands, his shoulders, and then back to his face again, and Steve couldn’t have explained why it was so hard to meet Tony’s gaze, but it took everything he had not to look away.
“I’d like to examine you. I realize we’re not in my office, but we could use your bed as an exam table, and I’ll perform a few tests, some of which might be a bit intrusive but nothing worse than what I’ve done to you before—”
“Okay, one more now,” Dr. Stark says, and Steve shoves away his thoughts, lets himself get lost in the burn of being opened up for larger things, the sounds of his own strained breathing and the faint squelch of Dr. Stark’s latex-covered fingers ramping his arousal higher. He wonders if his slick is leaking down Dr. Stark’s glove, if the scent-blockers Dr. Stark wears are enough to cover up the cloud of Steve’s desire, so thick that he can taste himself on his tongue, and if not, how Dr. Stark stands it.
Thanks again to
“You realize—” He coughed and tried again. “Do you even realize what you’re asking for?”
“Oh great,” he muttered, knowing there was no way he was going to avoid him. Not that he’d been planning to avoid him, of course. But it would’ve been nice to have the option.
“Yes, Tony,” he said, the memory of forcing Tony to safeword because he thought Steve couldn’t still raw in his mind. He wouldn’t let that happen again.
He wasn’t surprised to see her. Natasha had somehow started taking a protective older sister attitude toward him, telling him he should go out more whenever she’d been in town and even started suggesting potential candidates for him to date. She’d want to know what he’d been doing while she was gone.
“What aren’t you telling me?” Pepper asked when the silence kept dragging on.
“I’ll do what I have to.”
Tony expected him to urinate into a bottle as Tony held his penis. Steve didn’t know if he’d ever been this embarrassed in his life, shame sweeping through him, and he had to resist the urge to cringe.
“I don’t want to hear it!” Tony said fiercely, dropping his arms, and Steve’s mouth snapped close. “As a matter of fact, I don’t want to hear any of it. You couldn’t be fucked to say a word to me for three days, so I don’t want there to be so much as a peep out of your mouth unless it’s your safeword for the duration of your punishment. Do you understand me?”
But that’s not what today is for.  Today is for making enough memories to tide him over for two months, so he sticks his arm out and points the camcorder in the direction of their faces, and he lets Steve kiss exactly him like he wants to, Steve’s hands cradling his head, his mouth pressing against his hard enough to hurt.
“Thanks, but I’m okay,” Steve says in a blatant lie and throws a weak smile in Dr. Stark’s direction without meeting his eyes, because he might explode in mortification if he does.
“Mmph!” Steve is going to suffocate himself at this rate, bunching the blanket over his mouth to minimize the noises as much as possible.
“Fine isn’t
It was hard to not think about it, though, the weight of Tony on his tongue, the way Tony had sighed as he’d carded his fingers through Steve’s hair, the sight of Tony as he lay on the bed afterwards, sleepy and content.
“You mean like throwing him into a completely new situation that he didn’t want in the first place and then abandoning him the first chance you get?”
“Tony,” Steve gasps, endless seconds later, and it’s all Tony can do to not orgasm at the sound of his voice, hoarse and frantic. The friction is so intense like this that his control is in tatters, and he desperately wants Steve to come. Steve’s been shuddering almost constantly for the last couple of minutes, and it feels like he’s already left livid marks on Tony’s neck and shoulders, fingernails dragging along his skin, but he still hasn’t climaxed. “I have to—you can’t—
There was something a little intimidating about the thought of putting Tony’s cock into his mouth.
“Hold it above your head, arms straight but don’t lock your elbows. I’ll tell you when you can put it down.”
“You can put it down now,” Tony said, and Steve let out a sob as he set the ottoman down as gently as he could manage, nearly falling to his knees in the process.
“There is definitely something wrong with something,” Tony hedges, and is it possible that Steve doesn’t know he’s in heat? He’s in his twenties. He has to have gone through one by now. Right?
“Is there anything else
“Tony,” Steve said, dragging him back by his collar.  “What do you mean when you kiss me?”
“No, it’s my dad’s sixtieth birthday.  They’re throwing a big party, everyone’s invited, and as the only child, I’m expected to show up.  We’d fly out tomorrow, be back the day after that.  If you agreed,” he added, and Steve knew, just
. Steve hadn’t realized how much he needed Tony on top of him until he gave it to him, and his own arms ached with the urge to be able to hold Tony in return.
Dick had the insane and sudden urge to bow, but instead he reached out a hand and smiled, maybe a bit too widely, but it counted nonetheless. “Hello, Mrs. Kent. We’re so glad you could come.”
“That’s enough!” Fury barked, a day late and a dollar short, because there was a lost look in Steve’s eyes, just for a second, but it was there, and damn it.  Tony hadn’t even started it; he simply had a habit of ending things.  There was no reason for him to feel guilty.
He put the wrench down and started fiddling with some wiring.
“Tony,” he whispered, and even though the bottoms of his arms were technically free, as were his legs, he felt weak, trapped, as if his body couldn’t move at all.
Yes, Tony had been hurt when he’d found out Steve had doubted him, but looking back, was it really fair to Steve that it’d affected Tony
“Joe . . .”
It’d been . . . it’d been good to see her. Tough if in its own way, because of all the associations she had for him, but still good.
All Steve really wanted was for Tony to watch. To
He pulled both shoes and socks off, neatly placing the shoes side-by-side with the socks inside, and then he took a fortifying breath. There was just one more thing he needed to take off Tony.
The first thing Tony smells when he walks into the door is the heavy, almost-sour smell of an omega in heat.
He realized he was looking toward Tony, who still had his head bent down over his phone, and he wrenched his gaze away.
He refuses to accept it. He isn’t the preeminent engineer in Atlantis for nothing, and there has to be some kind of solution. The Humans wear special clothes and gear to visit them, and he knows he could do better than those ungainly things.
What if Steve had been too late? What if the reason Tony had asked “since when” was because he’d wanted to compare how long Steve had been in love with how long Tony had been
“You are the worst thing that’s ever happened to me,” Steve says exasperatedly, and Bucky laughs and laughs.
“Of course you can,” Tony said gently, and Steve’s eyelashes fluttered closed as he sat back onto his heels and pressed his forehead to the top of Tony’s thigh, his hands loosely gripping Tony’s calf.
It had Steve meeting his eyes finally, some of the rigid tension seeping away, but it had the opposite effect on him, and he stared back, panic starting to well up.
“You don’t have to apologize,” he says, plucking at the thin hospital blankets.  “You saved my life—”
Dr. Stark nods, his expression turning sympathetic. “I’ve gone to the same doctor for the last twelve years. I know how stressful seeing someone new is, and as a matter of fact, the reason I was going to step out of the room was so I could get something to help with that.”
"You suck," Tony says, and he's definitely pouting.  "Please, and thank you."
It was loud in the helicopter, too loud to carry on a conversation even with the microphone that was part of their headset, and the pilot was there as well—not that Steve wanted to talk to Tony about this right now. Well, he did and he didn’t. What would he say? If Tony had meant—if Tony
Which was why it’d been such a relief to see Peggy take Hodge down so matter-of-factly, no teasing, no games of dominance.  It’d demonstrated to all of them that slips in discipline would be punished, but that was it.  They were either going to do better or they were going to get kicked out, because boot camp wasn’t a military-themed seeker party; it was where they learned how to fight for their country and survive.
Steve gasped.
For the prompts "coitus interruptus" (avengers_tables) and "kink: frottage" (cap_ironman bingo).  I went with the literal definitions of coitus interruptus and frottage, which are “sexual intercourse in which the penis is withdrawn before ejaculation” and “…in which sexual arousal or orgasm is achieved by actual or fantasized rubbing up against another person” respectively.  I seriously don’t know why I picked the Cliché table.  I should’ve picked the Kink one instead.  *headdesk*
Steve tried to resist, he did, tried to ignore Tony’s hangdog expression and harden his resolve, but it was pointless.  He’d known he was going to go along with whatever Tony wanted as soon as he’d barged into his apartment.
It would be different if he could at least know that Tony was enjoying it, but Tony had gone back to not saying anything, and from the clack of the keys, it seemed like the last thing on his mind was Steve.
“Yes, but you’re just using Christmas as an excuse.”
“Yeah?” Tony asked, obliging him, and Steve grunted at the little bursts of pain, clenching his thighs restlessly.
“It’s alright,” she said, looking at him sympathetically. “It happens.”
Steve honestly didn’t know how to feel about it, but Tony said he would play games with Steve and take him on walks, and while the idea of Tony doing that was mortifying, it was also something he could look forward to. A little. Spending time with Tony, doing what Tony wanted, being good for him. Being Tony’s good boy.
In the past, he’d wished more than once that the serum didn’t require that he orgasm as part of his body’s daily maintenance. While he could push it off a day or two if he was willing to put up with the consequences, had done so a few times during the last several days while Tony was recovering, having Tony touch him now, having Tony
,” Steve repeats, glaring, and Tony puts up his hands, backing down.
“I . . . suppose,” he said, and he wondered if he should reveal that Steve had smiled at him. Twice.
—but all yelling at Tony did was to shut his ears, and if Steve forced him to stay, it’d just drive Tony further away from him.
His Angel says something Tony doesn’t understand and then, “Steve. You can call me Steve.”
At least … at least Tony wanting him naked meant he still liked his body. Right? At least there was something Steve could give him.
Pet play. Steve bowed his head and nodded, concentrating on making sure his fingers didn’t tremble and betray him. When he’d been growing up, there’d been a man who’d had a collar that had looked more like something a dog would wear than a person, and a few of the other kids had whispered and laughed about it. Steve hadn’t really understood their jokes until he joined the army and heard rumors about one general and his aide, but it wasn’t until after he’d been pulled from the ice that he’d ever actually seen anyone doing it.
“In a plane?” Steve asked, because Stark couldn’t be suggesting what he thought he was suggesting.
“Oh sure! Take your time,” Tony says, smiling easily, and as always, Steve finds himself smiling back, but …
“And I want you in your room by midnight. Don’t come out again until JARVIS tells you to.”
Actually, it made total sense.  If all of Stark’s weapons and computer security had been easily circumnavigated, SHIELD wouldn’t have continued to hire him.
“I know how to say no.” It came out harsher than he’d intended, but for Tony to say that, for that to be why Tony had safeworded … it would’ve been one thing if Steve had-had, fuck, if he’d refused to obey maybe, or if he’d used his strength to break the machine, or heaven help him, if he’d tried to lash out at Tony somehow. But what was he supposed to do with the fact that Tony had stopped everything for his sake? As if losing Tony was something he should be
Steve was glad he was looking down, because he hadn’t … really thought about it, but of course he’d have to use the bathroom sometime.
“I like it,” Tony says, lifting his head up enough to grin down at Steve.
“C’mon,” Tony said, gently tugging him forward.
And maybe the Earth was safe right this instant, but they weren’t hidden in anonymity anymore. There were millions upon millions of planets that knew about them now, knew there were Stones to be found here, and yes, they’d defeated Thanos, but who was to say there weren’t other, even more powerful beings that wanted to succeed where he’d failed? Could Steve really leave the Avengers to fight without him when they were already down—
He remembered what Pepper had told him when this had all started, that he’d have to scene with Steve because “...who better to be his first than someone who already loves him?”
His hips nearly come off the leather when Dr. Stark accidentally gets his prostate, and Steve bites down on his hand in an attempt to lock in the moan, but he’s doomed to failure. Even to his own ears, he sounds like hunger. Like base desperation.
“If by wimps you mean normal, sane people, then yes, you’re right.”
Assuming Dr. Stark even wants to keep going. Maybe he’ll demand Steve leave or that they reschedule to when he can bring a nurse in with them in order to make sure
to believe: in Steve, in his feelings for him, in some kind of happily every after that Tony had never dared to hope for himself.
Dr. Stark must too, because he looks down again, and Steve doesn’t know what’s wrong with him, but he lets out a gush of slick in response, as if his body knows it has Dr. Stark’s attention and is doing everything it can to show him just how willing and fertile Steve is.
“I knocked, but—”
Word count: 566
The word “table” comes out a little strangled, but at least Steve manages to say it. He still can’t force himself to stop kissing Tony as he reaches for a drawer (or let go of his buckle, but that’s neither here nor there), but he makes do with Tony’s neck, his shoulder, his chest—Steve lets out another gush of slick as the feel of how defined Tony’s chest is, and he can’t decide whether it’s better or worse that Tony’s still wearing his shirt.
If he flushed a little at the thought, well, there was no one around to call him on it.
All the thanks to
What? Tony wanted him to …
He’s almost tempted to do it again since it’s the most his Angel has moved the entire time, but his tentacles have their own ideas and start crawling all over his Angel’s thighs. Tony’s always thought legs were kind of weird, but he has to admit that his Angel’s are nice. They’re thick and muscular and like, wow, okay, actually
“Hey, I’m fine, it’s okay—”
“You want to put a stranger in a room with someone who’s just been transformed into a nearly 300 lb wolf and is probably scared and confused and turning more and more feral with each passing second?”
“Tony—”
“What? Our old contract? The one you signed under
He turned back around in time to catch the flicker of misery on Steve’s face before it was wiped off, and well, shit.  The car ride over had been bad enough with neither of them talking or even looking at each other, but Steve Rogers made a remarkably pathetic figure standing outside Tony’s door with only a duffel bag to his name, and Tony couldn’t help but feel a spike of pity.  The last thing the guy needed to be reminded of was that his “home” wasn’t one he wanted and that the only reason he had it was on Tony’s sufferance.  Pepper was right.  He had the sensitivity of a gnat.
He pressed the power button with some trepidation, and the screen lit up, making it incredibly easy to see the cracks which hadn’t been there a minute before. That wasn’t good.
Steve’s rudeness whenever it reared up. Stark was . . . he was persistent. Determined. And it appeared that he had set his sights on taking care of Steve.

“Good, ready to get out?”
“But you don’t
remembers their first,” she said, and he looked away, mouth thinning, wishing he could disagree. “And you know that that experience sets the tone for years to come about what you’re willing to do and how eager you are to do it.”
He sat outside on the balcony in order to be as close to the storm as possible without actually being in it.  It was mostly covered, and as long as he kept his chair angled close the wall, he shouldn’t get wet.  He brought along a copy of
Was it wrong of him to like it so much?
But what he said was, “And Tony?” because the need to know was too great.
“Sorry, company rules, can’t leave customers unattended.  Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of your car.  I haven’t damaged a car loading it or unloading since my first week here.  Maybe second.”
But Tony had kept things platonic between them for a week without showing any signs of taking it further, and while Steve realized a week was no time at all, would Tony have waited that long with anyone else? Steve had been around long enough to know that in this day and age, if two people were living together for a week, a lot more would’ve happened by now than just hugs and two kisses. So why were they taking things so slowly?
“Ummm,” he said, once again demonstrating why reporters weren’t known for their eloquence.
He gave a wry smile at her expression.
He thinks.
“I couldn’t answer then. Not because I didn’t know! Maybe I didn’t realize it was love, but I’ve known that I wanted to stay with you for a long time. Almost since the day I left. I missed you so damn much, Tony,” Steve said, the last words almost a whisper, and fuck, Tony was trembling.
“Only if that’s what you want, Steve. I don’t need you to do that for me,” Tony said, serious enough to break Steve’s heart all over again.
It was just as good as he remembered, better, and he sighed into Tony’s mouth when Tony’s hand slid up the nape of his neck, hoping Tony would—
A shower was hardly the place for having penetrative sex for the first time together, however, so Tony ignored his growing erection and focused on the delightful way Steve squirmed under his hand instead as he teased. He never exerted enough pressure to actually push in, although he hinted at it more than once, Steve arching unconsciously into Tony’s fingers, his hole flexing as if it were trying to suck him in. It was tempting, though, so very, very tempting, so Tony switched to his thumb and concentrated on sliding his fingers along Steve’s perineum instead, occasionally brushing against his balls as he rubbed against Steve’s prostate from the outside, something Steve rather enjoyed if the way his breathing turned ragged was any indication.
Tony froze, the line of his shoulders going rigid. His face was pointed away, so Steve couldn’t see his expression, but he desperately wanted to, wished … wished for so many fucking things, that he’d called Tony, that he’d talked about Project Insight with him, wished that he hadn’t made the same damn mistake that he’d already made over and over again and just fucking
Dr. Stark gives him another one of those reassuring smiles, says, “Alright, here we go,” and then covers both of Steve’s pecs with his large, warm, rough hands.
Steve’s head snapped around to look at him.  “That’d be great,” Steve said smiling, surprised and hopeful, and Tony didn’t need his newfound telepathy to tell how happy Steve was at that moment.
“Shh,” Tony said again, pressing one last sweet kiss to Steve’s lips before he shifted back up.
proof that he was alive and would continue to be until they found him again.  Assuming anyone ever did.
His orgasm was so intense that he couldn’t stop shivering afterwards, hands limp at his sides and knees splayed.  He watched with dazed eyes as Tony pulled out, stroking himself to completion and coming all over Steve’s already messy stomach, Tony’s hand reaching out to tenderly rub the come into his skin.
Not discussing it didn’t mean Steve didn’t think about it, however, because he did. All the time. He didn’t want to, but random bits of memory would pop into his head, the flex of muscle underneath his hand, the sound of Stark panting from exertion, the scent of cologne overlaid with sweat.
“A journal,” Dr. Saunders said. “I wouldn’t read it—unless you wanted me to, of course. I think it would be a good way, however, to organize your thoughts and write down events that you find significant or noteworthy during the day.”
He tried to tell himself it’d be alright as he rushed through his own shower. JARVIS would let him know if Tony needed help.
“Close it,” he told Natasha, waiting as long as he could, but Tony wasn’t coming back.
“Was Mr. Stark on TV?”
you had to bring him home.  Of course you did.”
It takes a second for Steve to understand what he means by “figure out” when it’s so clear that
Other than the speed of things anyway. Here he’d been fixating on hugs, but after last night, well, he obviously didn’t need to worry that Steve didn’t have enough sexual experience. It was just submitting that he didn’t know much about. So fine. Tony would help him figure out what he liked. No problem.
He opened the book, wondering if he could tape it back in, and it was only then that he noticed that it wasn’t actually a page at all, the paper folded into fourths.  It looked like someone had wedged it into the crease and then forgotten about it.
-----
Steve’s shoulder hunch, as if making himself smaller will solve anything. What if Dr. Stark doesn’t like the way he smells?
“You know, you said something to me a few days ago. Something I never really responded to the way I wanted.”
It’s so intense that Steve doesn’t realize he’s whining until he starts getting louder, but by that point, he can’t hold any of it back anymore, too exhausted and overwhelmed to fight for control. Dr. Stark isn’t letting up, and Steve is almost hunched over his knees, his face lost in the drape as he grunts and shakes.
Everything had seemed so much clearer after he’d cried. He’d felt calmer for having done it, ready to cry again, yes, but strangely also more settled and less like he was holding himself together with spit and hope. He would’ve preferred that he hadn’t lost control so completely in front of Tony or put him into a position where Tony had had to take care of him when Tony had been the one who’d needed support, but it had helped ease the suffocating urge to run away, leaving him shaky in the aftermath but somehow giving him the strength to fight, to admit how he felt.
He looks … sad. Wistful almost. But he’d seemed fine during the exam, so why—?
“I thought I’d get the chance to tell you after my punishment was over, after I proved myself so that you’d know how sorry I was.” He could hear Steve swallow. “We both know how well that turned out.”
Seeing how excited Steve got about the prospect of them coming over, Tony realized Steve had to be pretty lonely. As far as Tony knew, Steve hadn’t made many friends in New York before, and he’d left everyone he’d been getting to know for the past year in DC. The only support network he really had was Tony, and that was just depressing.
“Um, actually,” he says, because there’d been that one time, but it’d been for charity so he hadn’t actually gotten paid.  And he hadn’t been completely naked either.  He’d been wearing a strategically placed Swedish model, which he’d rather enjoyed.
“Not too tight?”
Joe waved his hand dismissively.  “I was
He didn’t regret his decision, although he did miss not being able to discuss things with Dr. Saunders anymore. She hadn’t been happy with his decision when he’d called to tell her he was moving, and she’d counseled against it, but his mind had been made up. He had to be in New York. There wasn’t another way.
He understood that Tony thought he’d kept something from Steve, but so what if he hadn’t told him? Yes, Steve was relieved that Tony was going to get his equipment back, and it did bring him a small level of comfort, but it didn’t change the fact that SHIELD had taken it away from Tony because of Steve in the first place.
horrible.  He’s a horrible,
of him … it was as if Steve’s body was demanding he make up for all the days without, for the days when the only relief had come from his own hand.
Tony had made a promise. Steve’s first Dom. He’d done a shit job of it for the past few days, too mired in his own feelings to act rationally and respond the way he should’ve. Tony owed him more than that, and he swore to himself that he’d figure out a way to provide it. It’d destroy something in him if he turned out to be something Steve regretted.
Had Howard been this wealthy?  There’d been too much going on for Steve to ever have the chance to do more than talk to him in passing, and truth be told, he’d avoided him for a while when he’d thought Howard and Peggy were together.  He’d known that Howard was exceptionally intelligent and liked to crack jokes and was confident around women, but they hadn’t ever discussed his life outside the war, and then, of course, it’d been too late.
So it shouldn’t hurt to stand outside Steve’s door and just . . . smell him a little bit. Just. Just smell him.
“—give you a second.”
And Steve had thrown that all away.
He realized that his leg was bouncing up and down, and he took a deep breath, making himself stop. He wished they were there already. Wherever there was.
Tony wanted to take his time, to give Steve the chance to ramp himself up more, but he found himself rushing through taking off his clothes, clumsy in a way he hadn’t been in years. He had to force himself to slow down, to just watch as Steve did everything he could to avoid making himself feel
How was it possible? After everything, after the last few days, the last couple of
He honestly hadn’t thought about wearing Tony’s collar much, maybe once or twice the whole time he’d known him, and even then, only as an abstract, far-into-the-future type of thing. He’d never thought about it in terms of months or years even, just … one day. Maybe one day Tony would offer. And maybe one day Steve would accept.
His legs almost gave out completely when Tony stroked all the way down the shaft of his cock and then back up, and he thought Tony’s grip might have been all that kept from upright as he cried out, embarrassingly loud as orgasm took him completely by surprise. He squeezed his eyes shut, his body turned traitor as it twitched and trembled without his permission, the pleasure bursting through him in waves.
For the prompts “Proper use of first aid” (Cap_Ironman bingo) and “Undercover operation” (Avengers_Tables).  Title from Fun's "We Are Young."
“C’mon, let’s get out of here,” he said roughly, pulling the curtain around Steve’s bed so he was outside of it, and Steve could see his body outlined in the fabric, standing guard until he came out.
“What?” he asked, because he couldn’t have heard what he thought he’d just heard.
And then Nick died.
Steve shouldn’t be allowed within a fifty foot radius of Tony, but the thought of not seeing him again makes him want to curl up into a nest of blankets and grieve. He’d been so hopeful things would go well, and instead, he’s ruined everything.
At least it had been. All the changes in behavior were leading Steve to one conclusion: Stark didn’t want him around anymore.
Except …
“You keep that up, and I might accidentally drop you,” Tony said, and Steve froze. Tony wouldn’t—Steve
Steve doesn’t mean to, but he does think about it, and it makes his heart start beating faster at the very possibility.

The next bite was barely an inch away.
Steve planned to leave it at that—although “planned” might be too strong a word, because it implied he’d ever thought about it in the first place, which he hadn’t—
are inside of Steve. And actually, that mental image doesn’t help his situation at all.
“Why don’t you lie down, Steve,” Tony says, his voice filled with a heat that makes a fresh surge of slick drip down Steve’s thighs, and yes, okay, lying down sounds like a great idea.
“You always were my favorite,” Tony gasped, his lips twitching into a small smile as he reached up and touched Steve’s face.  Then Tony’s eyes closed, his hand falling away.
“That was hard for you. Rest now,” Tony told him, somehow right next to him, even though Steve hadn’t seen him move, and Steve felt such a rush of gratitude that Tony hadn’t let him fail, that Tony was there, he almost started crying, would have except he’d told himself he wouldn’t do that to Tony.
“I missed you,” Steve gasped in between kisses, the truth was too immense to be locked within his chest, otherwise he never would’ve been able to tear himself away from Tony’s mouth.
Tony’s fingers tightened in his hair but a second, but thankfully, he didn’t say anything.
Tony shivers at the thought and bites at Steve’s neck, his shoulder, focuses on that instead of how good Steve feels around him. He wishes he could use his hands more to touch and caress, but they’re too busy keeping Steve close and supporting him, so it’s up to his tentacles to do all the work.
Was it … was it wrong of him to like it? To wish he could see himself in a mirror? To want to see the proof of Tony’s claim written so boldly on his body? This was supposed to be a punishment after all.
“No can do right now.  Big project, deadline, clock’s ticking and all that.  Just going to grab something and head back to my lab.”
, because we wanted to be
He wanted to comfort Steve, to be strong for him and somehow find the words to apologize for how he’d fucked everything up, for letting them get to this situation, but he was just—
(See the end of the chapter for
“This is such a bad idea,” he said, shoulders slumping.
“Different how?” Pepper asked when he said as much, but Tony could tell from her tone that she wasn’t giving their conversation the consideration it deserved.
Speaking of his failing self-control, Steve’s been trying to ignore the blankets Dr. Stark had given him because Dr. Stark had assumed they stopped carrying his scent and Steve hadn’t wanted to take advantage just because he knew differently. But Steve can’t see Dr. Stark anymore. He can hear the occasional sound, enough to guess what Dr. Stark is doing, but it’s not the same. And while he appreciates Dr. Stark’s promise to tell him what’s going to happen, it’s unsettling not knowing, and he can’t help but feel a little vulnerable, even as he realizes how foolish he’s being. He trusts Dr. Stark, and he knows Dr. Stark is going to take care of him.
He jumped a little when Nurse Sara started her litany of questions, so lost in his thoughts that he hadn’t even paid attention to the fact that they’d arrived in the exam room. Stark turned his attention to his phone as soon as he sat down and didn’t try to answer for him, even though the questions had been directed at the both of them. Stark even pulled out . . . earbuds? He thought that was what they were called. . . that he stuck into his ears, faint bits of music escaping, and seemed to stop paying attention to the two of them at all.
“Oh.  Well yeah.  You sure you don’t mind?” the guy said, smiling.  He was strikingly handsome.
articles he’d read about him, Steve knew that Stark played just as hard as he worked. Who was to say that he wouldn’t have chosen to stay in the penthouse even if Steve hadn’t been around? It wasn’t as if Stark
“Like this. Stay like this for me,” Tony said, and it was all Steve could do not to whine in agreement, his hole clenching down greedily as if he could make Tony keep touching him, even though Steve knew it’d be over soon. Tony was just ensuring that Steve was stretched out enough to take his … to take his tail. It wasn’t Tony’s fault that Steve had responded to this degree.
“Tony,” Pepper said, and Tony knew she was going to bring the conversation back around to Steve, even though he’d much prefer to reminisce about his and Happy’s exploits.  Or anything else really.  “I don’t think there’s anyone in the world who knows about your tendency to make spur-of-the-moment decisions better than I do, but this is another man’s
That . . . could’ve gone better, Steve thought and decided that since Tony had left, it wouldn’t be bad for him to sit down.
It got worse from there. They argued. It was all they seemed to be able to do when they were together.
“There was another patient who used to urinate during an exam. One time could be excused, even twice, but three times in a row?” Dr. Stark doesn’t stop what he’s doing as he talks, and Steve doesn’t know how long Dr. Stark is going to keep trying, doesn’t know how long he’ll be able to stand it if he doesn’t give up soon.
“Don’t, Steve,” he rasped, forcing himself to move, and he crashed down next to him, the agony in his back nothing in comparison to the one in his chest. “You don’t need to do this, Sweetheart.”
Steve,” he tells him, touching his thumb to his ring.
Steve couldn’t make himself believe it, though. And he didn’t know what to think about it, that Stark would do something like that for him, because no matter how often he tried to justify Stark’s actions with the Avengers’ Initiative, it didn’t make sense that Stark would put his life on hold.
Maybe it was time to go home—
He went to his room to put his things away, hesitating in the bathroom before brushing his teeth again—he’d brushed them that morning, but he’d eaten and had a couple of cups of coffee since then—and then started his search for Tony.
I feel so accomplished! Look how much writing I'm getting in! Hopefully, you guys like Tony a little better after this chapter. >_>
“I downloaded the building’s plans while they were still trying to figure out how to get suit off and memorized them.”
(There was a part of him that sneered at the idea of being a bad Sub, but it was the same part that had looked down on Star—on
“Indeed, Sir,” JARVIS said, and Steve didn’t understand how he could feel a stab of envy at the order, but he did. He would’ve made Tony coffee if he’d asked. Tony could tell him to do something, and he’d do it. He’d do anything.
, oh, Tony. Tony,” Steve said, shuddering, hips jerking under Tony’s hands. He distinctly heard a screech of metal, and he suspected Steve had just bent his headboard beyond repair, but he didn’t stop to check, too focused on the sight of Steve taking him in, on how Steve felt on his cock. For a man who’d been stretched out with four fingers, Steve was somehow still incredibly tight around him, and Tony wondered what it’d take to make him sloppy and loose—
So then … why couldn’t he shake the feeling that he’d lost something instead?
“JARVIS, how long has Tony been in his lab?”
He tries to make sense of Steve’s words. He can’t what? Steve’s begging him as if he’s somehow stopping Steve from orgasming, which would be laughable considering he’s doing everything he can to
Steve glanced around the shower, which could have easily accommodated four more people without a problem, but he didn’t protest. He could wait until after Tony was finished.
now. Maybe the spellcaster had done it to make him appear more monstrous and thus, less likely to find someone willing to sleep with him, but he was enormous. Steve was sure that if he’d been braced for it, he wouldn’t have fallen, but when was the last time he’d been on guard around Tony?
, how could Steve still be willing to say something like that, let alone feel it?
Steve let out the tiniest grunt as the back of his thighs met the tops of Tony’s, and this was a very sexual position, wasn’t it, he thought, staring into Tony’s eyes, the warmth of his body seeping through Steve’s clothes. He didn’t remember putting them there, but one hand was on an armrest, and the other one was braced against Tony’s chest. His fingers twitched.
, he wants stuff from
for Tony to slip it to him in the show—slip
“What’s your name?” he asks in between kisses, because he’s tired of referring to him as “his Angel,” even though it’s true. He can’t imagine wanting anyone else, ever again, and maybe that’s crazy, but he doesn’t care.
“Alright then.” Tony put the bottle of lube on the ottoman as well. “Let’s see what you’ve got.”
“I wanted to …”
“Nope.”
He broke off when Steve’s face flushed even harder, which, man, he hadn’t known a person could turn that shade of magenta.
His heats have never been that bad. Oh, he wants to climb out of skin with the need to touch and be touched, has thought about Tony more than he feels comfortable admitting, but he can get through them without outside help.
Steve was ready by eight.
For someone who had never had a Dom before, Steve had a lot of opinions about the way they acted. Or maybe it was just Tony. Maybe he just really, really,
Wait.
Tony’s tried walking on land before, and it was
And if it happened to kill two birds with one stone, all the better.  SHIELD had been trying to get their hooks into him for years—weapons designer extraordinaire (even if he’d said he’d left that behind him, there was always the possibility that they could convince him otherwise), technology genius, owner and operator of the one and only Iron Man—and if he accepted responsibility for Captain America, they’d have it.  SHIELD had found the guy after all, and he was still technically in the Army, government property in other words, and there’d be check-ins and check-ups, and no Dom worth his salt would let his Sub go into those alone without at least being in the next room.  They’d have Tony by the balls, and Fury knew it, the bastard.  Assuming he agreed.  Which, Tony totally wasn’t planning to do.  No way.  Nuh uh.
Steve had been living with him for less than seven full days, and he was already going to be gone for that long? What if Fury were behind the timing? What if he’d been invested in getting them together before but had subsequently changed his mind? What if tried to convince Steve to go back? Or worse yet, what if Steve had decided he needed some time to think? What if he was reevaluating his decision?
Steve rubbed his jaw, looking away from Tony.  He didn’t have much experience at being the breakup-er versus the breakup-ee, had a tendency to hold on to people long after he should’ve let them go, and the blank expression on Tony’s face wasn’t helping.  Like he didn’t know Tony’s tells by that point.  Like he couldn’t figure out he was hurting him.
“I shouldn’t have assumed—”
“Does that mean you don’t mind?” He closed his eyes. He hadn’t actually planned on asking, hadn’t wanted to put any additional pressure on Tony after telling him they were being forced to have sex, but the words had escaped anyway.
So even though he hadn’t wanted to spar with Stark either, he’d done it, had decided he could put up with that and more for the possibility of real freedom. And if he thought about Stark’s insistence that they train together before going into the field as common sense instead of one of his rules, then it made it that much more bearable.
“Cross my heart,” he says and pulls Steve in for a quick kiss and hug.
