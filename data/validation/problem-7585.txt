“I’ll see you Wednesday, okay?” Steve managed to shout back to Sam.
Steve nodded. He reached over to place a hand on Tony’s knee which resulted in Tony turning his body a little to face him to a degree. Tony placed the record down on the edge of the table next to the record player.
The office door opened to reveal Obadiah. “Anthony.”
“I think you already know why I’m here.” Obadiah started, looking around casually before training his focus on Tony.
Steve delicately placed some dishes in the sink. He hesitated a bit before continuing as he turned around to face Sam.
Tony heard Steve sigh. “I know, Tony. I should have, but…” there was a long pause, “…I wasn’t sure if you would even care…”
As soon as the necessary information was entered, Steve stepped back from the device. It hummed quietly before turning colors to indicate that it was generating the S.H.I.E.L.D. tracker.
“Well, I’m looking forward to your team’s simulation for the board, Mr. Rogers.” Obadiah offered without missing a beat.
Bruce stepped forward to stand next to Tony. “So how should we go about doing this? I’m thinking we should stay in our original pairs and groups.”
Steve’s eyes widened as the light from the candle flickered. He opened his mouth a few times to speak, but never really answered. Tony, still holding onto Steve’s hands, sensed that maybe he did make a mistake; he wasn’t sure how to read Steve’s expression.
“Hey, Cap.” Bucky greeted as soon as the elevator doors opened.
“Okay, so this isn’t
Tony forced a smile. “You don’t say?” He repeated, speechless for the first time in a while.
Pepper laughed, but she was kind about it. “Rhodey might have mentioned something. We’re just looking out for you, Tony.”
?” he took a step toward Steve, “last time I checked, Rogers, friends don’t fuck each other.”
Tony laughed at Steve, sitting back in his chair again. “Jesus, Rogers. It’s not
“…I’m so into you, Steve, that I’ll do whatever the
“Look who finally decided to come home.” Sam made a few catcalling noises and whistled as he entered the kitchen, spotting Steve hunched over at the kitchen table. Steve only slightly acknowledged his friend before sulking some more over a cup of coffee.
He really thought it was. Although they hadn’t agreed on it before going out, the conversation during dinner and the rest of the night had suggested it was. As he tried to take Bucky’s dating advice a little too literally, Steve thought he would try to convey to Tony that he was interested as it became clear, as the evening progressed, that the latter appeared to be strangely tentative.
One early evening, Tony, Steve, and Peter were hanging out in Tony’s home office. The lab on the seventieth floor was still a tangled mess, so Tony had been working in his home office during the day ever since Steve’s extended stay.
Steve sighed before leaning back into his chair. He shrugged. “I guess, but I don’t feel like I got any attention until I was in college. And still, it feels strange to me. I used to be a lot scrawnier when I was kid…”
“Shuri, I know you were busy with that stupid face thing, but did you manage to make any sense of these random numbers?”
Bucky nodded as he directed Steve to sit with him on one of the sofa sections in the lobby. Steve told Bucky what had happened between him and Tony. After listening for some time, Bucky sighed.
Perhaps learning from the last fight Steve and Tony had in public, everyone else just looked at one another as Tony and Steve glared at each other. After a moment of silence, an awkward cough from Clint, and Shuri looking around at everyone else to gauge an appropriate reaction, Bruce motioned toward Fury, attempting to redirect the tension in the room.
Steve chuckled. “I forgot that I told you that…,” he waited a bit before rubbing Tony’s cheek, lightly caressing him, “but I sincerely hope that my love life ends happier.”
Tony grinned as he shook Steve’s hand, aware of how flirtatious his gestures could be in front of Bucky.
Steve could tell the situation was becoming tense from the way Tony had inched closer toward him as Obadiah approached. Tony placed a hand on his back as Obadiah finally reached them; something about it felt unnerving.
Also, I said this in the notes last chapter, but I wanted to say it again for anyone who missed it: thank you to all of those who have been reading so far! Your comments, bookmarks, kudos, and subscriptions make my day :)
Ever since leaving the party, Steve had trouble trying to understand Tony’s actions. His behavior was erratic and too difficult to navigate without causing more problems. Steve knew Tony had issues when it came to relationships, but he found himself becoming less patient as time wore on. Thankfully, Sharon appeared unaware of the drama; they met up once more that weekend to peruse a farmer’s market before eating lunch, but all Steve could think about was Tony.
Tony sighed. “Bruce and I created a backup plan for the device in case, well, in case this happens.” He pointed toward the device.
Tony smiled has he reached over to half hug Steve. “Rogers is definitely holding this whole thing together.”
“Not, yet, I haven’t lost yet.” He managed to gently hold off Peter and his efforts to get him to wear the mask before the game began.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., how great would it be if we tested out some of the mechanics to this suit on Peter’s robot?”
went.”
Steve stopped tapping his phone in the palm of his hand, staring at it before pulling up Sharon’s contact information.
Tony had stayed in the hospital the day and a half Steve was in surgery while Peter stayed with May. Sam and Bucky were also at the hospital: Sam talked with Tony while Bucky ignored them, clearly upset that his best friend was in the hospital. Tony had missed work to wait for news at the hospital, but eventually Bruce managed to convince him to go home until Steve was stable enough to receive visitors. However, Tony couldn’t rest at home; all he could think about was being the reason why Steve was in the hospital.
Tony took a moment before nodding back.
Steve’s jaw hardened as he continued rubbing Tony’s arms. “Please, Tony. That’s not true.”
“Don’t worry about me, Rogers. But you did a great job.” He smiled meekly, cutting to the chase. He could tell, however, that Steve wasn’t buying it.
Loki, still lying on the floor, looked around. He then crawled over to a table as he watched Thor and Steve wrestle with his friends.
“Night.” Tony answered curtly.
“What’s up, Obie?” Tony tried for as casually as possible without letting his growing disdain for someone he used to consider a father figure seep out of his voice.
“Okay, now, Tony!” Peter called.
“Fine,” Obadiah spun around to face the rest of the board, “at least you all can sleep well at night knowing that here at Stark Industries our security is optimal.” He motioned a bit with his hands for emphasis.
Sam shrugged as Bucky continued. “...I feel...like I’m going to lose my best friend…I’m not used to Steve being in serious relationships…or in a relationship at all for that matter…” He crossed his arms as he looked up at Sam intently, “…I thought we would hang out more after moving in together but…we never hang out…he spends
Tony looked around the room: The Synergy device was sitting on top of what was left of the conference room table. Debris flew around the space as Tony craned his neck to see the spot where Thanos’s weapon had been hidden. The briefcase had been blown away but the weapon was still intact.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., lights.”
Tony turned somewhat to face Steve. He finished unbuttoning his shirt before shuffling up the bed to lie next to Steve who then pulled him close to his body.
Tony sighed as he clicked on the message. He had barely gotten through Hammer’s usual annoying platitudes when there was a knock at his door.
“How long do you have to wear the mask?” Steve asked as his laughter subsided.
Steve then turned to face away from the plane: T’Challa’s plane was located on a man-made harbor in the city that contained enough space to allow the plane to take off and land on a constrained runway. T’Challa had the harbor and the airstrip built after he bought some real estate in the city and in Long Island to expand Wakanda’s business ventures, which included the private resort where everyone was traveling to for Sam and Shuri’s wedding.
best project.
Steve grimaced. “Yes, but that was before…” He couldn’t bring himself to discuss the breakup; it was too painful to rehash after spending months trying to recover from it and Tony appeared more than fine with it.
Tony whistled to himself before stopping suddenly; he had scrolled to a date that made his heart sink, realizing that the trip to his family’s house in the Hamptons was fast approaching. But instead of dwelling on it, Tony told himself to cool it, squeezing his eyes shut, counting to ten, before taking off down the corridor to get to his meeting.
Tony shook his head as he straightened up in his chair. “No, Rhodes. He basically ran out of the penthouse the morning after. Wouldn’t even let me drive him home.” Tony sank in his chair with grief.
As he worked, he replayed the first assignment in his head. Tony had confidence in the team, sure, but the first mission had gone far better than he had ever hoped. It helped that their individual personalities and professions lent toward their specific tasks, but Steve had impressed Tony the most. He had never seen anyone who was a self-professed luddite take so easily to complicated tech, especially in its beginning stages.
a little intrigued by the younger man’s steadfast personality. And he may have talked about him a
Steve wordlessly acknowledged Tony with a curt nod, almost complete with a quizzical expression, but not quite. Tony had come up with the husband bit earlier in the hotel room while they were getting ready for the party, and of course Steve had been weird about it at first. Tony had mostly suggested the idea to get a rise out of him, but eventually Steve handled himself better with their pretend roles than Tony had expected.
“No…?” Peter let out, his tone wavering a bit which turned his answer into a question.
Tony shook T’Challa’s hand. “Thanks for adding me to this shindig at the last minute, T’Challa.”
Tony gathered his things as he waited for the others to shuffle out of the conference room. He then walked up to Steve, leaning against the table with his arms crossed, smiling.
Tony tried to straighten up as best as he could. He looked over at Steve who looked on the brink of falling over.
Steve sighed as he slowly looked up at his friends. “I don’t think Tony wants the same thing. We got into a huge fight this morning…I tried telling him that I wanted to be friends—”
Bruce chuckled as he watched Fury walk away. He pulled out his phone to text Tony.
As Steve entered the set into the device, the device glowed like it did the first time the team used it to save the visiting diplomat. It hummed quietly, slowly changing colors as it reproduced the first set of specs for the medical equipment. It then paused before gleaming vibrantly again. It continued to hum as it created a set of specs that had not been initially requested by Strange.
Steve nodded and thanked the guard before heading over to the security check point before the elevator bank. He obediently followed directions as the guards scanned him. Once in the elevator, Steve took another deep breath before pressing the button to the seventieth floor.
Peter nodded as Tony tasted the food. “Okay
Steve expressed his confusion as he followed Tony’s gaze with his eyes, looking behind himself at the elevator before looking back at Tony who also looked just as confused.
He braced himself against the table before responding. “Pep, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure where things went wrong with us.” Tony gripped his glass again. If he had extraordinary powers of any sort, he definitely would have broken the glass.
The female board member acknowledged Obadiah with a curt nod, but Pepper ignored him as she turned to face Tony who appeared to be on the verge of bursting through the seams with anger.
He turned slightly to wave back at his friends before finding Tony again who was standing next to Happy, chatting away enthusiastically.
believe I just met Tony Stark…” Steve’s assistant could care less that her boss looked absolutely terrified. To her, she just met a celebrity, not her boss’s ex-boyfriend who had ghosted him for entire year.
Tony could feel his chest restricting with pain again; he told himself to cool it, breathing deeply until he heard the elevator arrive.
“Tony.” Steve yanked himself away from Tony, “you
Tony laughed as he clapped his friend gently on the back. “Aw, come on. You can do us all a favor and just ask her out. I can’t stand watching you two avoid speaking to one another in front of us any longer.” He made a cartoonish face of disgust in Peter’s direction which incited delightful laughter from the nine-year old.
Tony made a face before he uncrossed his arms to reach into the breast pocket of his jacket. He pulled out a pair of eyeglasses before placing them delicately on the bridge of his nose.
“Yeah, Steve.” Bucky had turned to grin at Steve.
Obadiah attempted to intimidate Fury with a scowl, however, he hadn’t accounted for Fury’s famed, perfected stare down. The two ended up glaring at each other, intensely, for at least a few minutes. Everyone else looked back and forth between the two men, as if they were watching a tennis match, until Obadiah finally gave in. He laughed quietly, mustering up that usual fakeness he saved for board meetings and the press.
Loki broke away from Thor’s grasp as he straightened himself out. “My brother isn’t aware of how strong he is. Fortunately, he has other positive qualities.
“You know, Dr. Banner is great. Tony seems to really appreciate having him around at work and helping out with Peter.” He offered, attempting not to make it obvious he was prying into her dating life, although he was failing tremendously.
Obadiah followed the staffer through the building and past the main event area before arriving at a nicely furnished conference room.
“Welcome back, Sir.” Steve abruptly stopped short after entering the lab as a dispassionate, non-human voice appeared out of nowhere.
Luckily Tony knew how to retain a pleasant expression as he mentally screamed with anguish and frustration. He felt himself approaching the verge of reacting with anger, knowing he should have never let Steve go and now he was talking to Steve’s girlfriend or whatever because of it, but Tony still wanted to confess his love toward him. Nothing made sense as Tony stared blankly at Sharon who had no idea that she was causing him so much torment.
Tony frowned at Steve before straightening the instructions out. “And for your home exercises,” he continued, as Steve groaned again, “you’re supposed to work on what they show in therapy for at least ten minutes a day.”
Obadiah causally waved his hand about before pointing sternly at Tony; it felt like Obadiah’s finger had penetrated right through Tony’s heart, although he was still on the other side of the conference table. Tony remained paralyzed; even if he wanted to say something, he couldn’t.
“Good, I’m glad.” Tony responded, exhaling with relief, looking slightly at Peter before focusing on the road.
“Tony, you feel so amazing…” Steve breathed, panting from how quickly he was moving.
Some time passed as Tony anxiously waited for any response from Steve.
He yelped again as Natasha pinched his shoulder a second time.
“Remember the scene with the device that smooches Tom Cruise’s face so he can get back into Precrime undetected?” Tony sat back in his chair, looking pleased with himself, “well, I have invented one of those.”
Ignoring them both, Strange chuckled. “I’m sure Tony already told you what happened, but long story short, you survived a pretty devastating explosion. We brought you into surgery, which went extremely well, and you’ve been here for several days recovering. But,” Strange clapped his hands together, “you’re free to go whenever. You're healing faster than I had expected.”
“I’m relaunching Synergy and I want you to rejoin the team.” Tony ended with a casual shrug and grin.
Steve sighed as he turned to lean his back up against the railing. “Tony…I really do miss you, I meant that when I said it…”
The day he had recovered the diary, he had refused to read it, almost completely forgetting about it until now. Tony wasn’t sure what the point of reading the diary would be; nothing would change his feelings toward the way his father had treated him and the thought of reading the diary right now would only exacerbate his anxiety over failed relationships.
As he listened, Steve figured he could call Tony later that night, that way he would have composed himself by then to calmly explain out loud what he had expressed in the letter.
As Tony filed through the information on the buyers, Steve came up to join him at the console. Ever since their talk from the beginning of the week, both were doing their best not to step on each other’s toes. Although they had managed to complete work effectively together, per usual, the camaraderie they usually experienced had dissipated quite a bit.
Steve, who was standing against the wall opposite the door next to Thor and Shuri, uncrossed his arms as he took a step toward the conference table to stare sternly at Obadiah.
“Rogers, chill. I’m not going to run off.” He grinned upward at Steve.
The rest of the night progressed as you probably already imagined. The team had their moments of bonding as Thor’s Jörmungandr exacerbated their specific personalities. Tony was watching Steve the entire night; completely transfixed, yet unable to do anything about it. When it came time for everyone to leave, Tony had managed to locate his lab partner in a spirited drunk conversation with one of Thor’s closest friends, Valkyrie, about which historical or mythical figure would be able to win in a melee.
fucking follow me!” Tony yelled back at Steve as he exited the lab.
Peter let out a whiny noise before continuing, and Steve had to prevent himself from grinning so hard.
“One of your team members was assaulted not too long ago. Did that have anything to do with Synergy?” One reporter managed to shout over the rest.
, and Sam and Bucky used to fuck. Gotcha.”
Tony grinned at Bruce as he walked up to his friend and clapped him on the back.
“Whose number are you calling me from?”
“I’m tired of pussy footing around. I’m calling security to drag Obie—”
Steve eyed Loki, but then conveyed neutrality to avoid making the atmosphere between the two men more awkward than it already was.
“Steve, listen,” Bruce was holding his arm, “you can’t go down there.”
Steve shrugged in effort to alleviate Tony. “Nothing too earth shattering, just that he wanted me to be the ‘face’ of Synergy for the upcoming promotional tours.”
“Go back to sleep!” Tony grumbled through a haze with half of his body on top of Steve.
Tony twisted his body around so he could face Bruce more directly. “How about this,” he began, a bit wobbly from the Jörmungandr, “I’ll ask Rogers out if you ask Romanov.” He attempted to hold his arms outstretched with grin as if he had just easily figured out nuclear fusion.
“There’s no need for vulgarity, Tony.” Steve replaced his hands on Tony’s shoulder to pinch him.
Tony turned to look at him. He looked worn, but he was smiling a little. “I, uh, actually…since this shit with Thanos is coming to ahead, I think I might just go back into the city early…I have a prototype autopiloted helicopter that I just synced with J.A.R.V.I.S…” He answered, shrugging.
“No, it’s not that. I just had the shittiest weekend.”
“Right away, Sir.”
Bruce nodded. “Let’s just hope it doesn’t come to that…” he then walked around the console, “but I do think the mini reactor will help somehow if it comes to pushing Synergy to its limits…yet…”
“Tony!”
Steve looked down at Tony’s hand before looking up, shooting Tony his own sly grin. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, Tony.”
Tony glared at Steve. “I knew this was a fucking mistake…I can’t trust you...”
Thanos stopped laughing to grin at Tony. “You’ve wasted all your time here with me…” He vaguely explained.
“No, Tony. You don’t get to do that. I’m basically walking on eggs shells around you. I don’t really know what you want from me…”
“How’s Peter?”
the benefit of the doubt. He was way out of line.” The two paid for their snacks before entering the theater. They sat down somewhere in the middle.
Steve stopped and peered as best as he could through the glass to see two figures standing in the lab. One figure was quite animated with their gestures while the other stood somewhat still. Steve looked back and forth down the hallway before inching closer toward the glass.
Tony groaned as he put his head into his hands with his elbows on top the table. He felt a hand caress his arm.
“Oh, hey, Steve!” Happy greeted him immediately, “how’s it going?”
Steve shrugged as he tried to figure out what Bucky was trying to get at. “All she told me was that you mentioned we used to be serious…”
Steve reminded himself as he reached the bedroom.
“Hey, Steve…” Tony let out quietly, trying to smile, but he cringed from how awkward he felt.
Steve sighed, but then he nodded back. “Maybe…but you would know better than me.”
“So, the best advice I can give you when it comes to promotional tours is to keep smiling no matter what. They usually field the questions for us, but if you get a hard ball, try to counter with something positive about the program.”
Tony nodded, still smiling. “Yep. Are you busy?”
But what he saw kept Tony from moving any further. Down the corridor, as more people gathered near the source of the bang, Tony could see smoke and fire spewing out of his lab.
Steve reached out an arm to stop him. “Hey, what’s going on?”
Tony scrolled down until something caught his eye. It was a notation to a function that had been rendered obsolete in the newest iteration of the device.
Peter stepped back, mimicking a thoughtful pose he had seen both Tony and Bruce do many times before answering.
Peter smiled with a nod. “Of course! Are we going to see my dad later?”
“You almost killed someone!” Tony was now struggling against Steve, “do you know how many lives you put in danger?!”
Tony cooed again as he took his time looking around the space. “Jesus fucking Christ. This place is sweet!”
Tony sighed; he really didn’t feel like talking about Steve, especially with Pepper. It just reminded him of his many failed past relationships.
“Was I obvious? “Bruce asked, readjusting his eyeglasses. He was grinning a little, but it was on the shy side, typical for his anxious behavior.
I slept with Steve last night!
Steve crouched down before receiving a hug from Peter who nearly toppled them over from the force of the hug.
Ever since Steve began staying over at Tony’s, Sam had been super supportive. Bucky, while not as vocal as Sam, seemed like he was fine with Steve’s current relationship status. Steve found some time to devout to his oldest friend, but he would still have to cancel on Bucky more than he wanted to in order to spend more time with Tony. However, Bucky appeared fine with it; he hadn’t said otherwise. Steve figured that his oldest and dearest friend would at least tell him if he had an issue with Tony. He hoped so, anyway.
Steve lied to himself.
Tony and Bruce walked over to Shuri who was now standing up with a small piece of the Synergy’s device’s vibranium core in her hand. The three of them looked at each other before looking at the core.
Tony chuckled. “Why are you sorry? Didn’t it feel great?”
Tony accepted the tablet. Immediately, he grinned the widest grin. “Banner! This is amazing!”
Tony stopped, sighing to himself as he took his time turning around to face Peter. “Steve doesn’t spend the night all the time.”
Steve reached downward to free himself, letting out a sharp moan as his naked hard cock made contact with Tony’s. Tony pushed upward before using his body weight to push Steve onto his back, straddling him, jerking forward with each thrust.
“So, I’ve heard. Have a good rest of your day, Mr. Rogers.”
“First, T’Challa’s sister’s name is Shuri.” Tony corrected as he leaned forward, “second, does the name ‘Thanos’ ring a bell?”
“...we need to put the device on lock until further notice. No missions
Loki’s expression softened before he shook his head. “Would love to, you know, support Synergy and all, but I have to get back to something I’m working on but keep me updated.” He snapped his fingers in Steve’s direction, obviously insincere about the whole situation, before disappearing back into his lab.
Tony groaned loudly, slamming his face with a pillow again.
“Synergy has the ability to replicate any material possible due to its vibranium core.” Steve ended with a wink and nod at the crowd which earned him even more adoration.
Tony looked back up at Steve before leaning in more, wavering a bit before placing a hand on Steve’s knee.
“Um,” Tony laughed quietly before continuing, too amazed with what was happening, “would you like to go to the master bedroom?” He asked softly.
The group said their goodbyes before Shuri ended the call. Tony rounded the conference table but in doing so he accidentally locked eyes with Steve before the two looked away quickly.
Tony made a face, mostly at learning that Bucky and Sam might have been trying to inadvertently cockblock him.
Both men lingered a bit, now expressing the goofiest grins at the other, before Steve walked over to the island. Tony rubbed his shoulder as he passed before walking to the counter to finish the dinner that Steve had mostly prepared.
Tony hardly said goodbye to his friend before hanging up. He knew Rhodey was just teasing him, but he was trying to tread lightly with Steve in order not to scare him again.
They stayed like this for a second or so before Tony pulled away. “I’m sorry, Steve…I have to go. I’m sorry…” He whispered before letting go.
Tony slammed his fists on the table again. “Just tell us where you stashed the damn weapon, Thanos.”
Steve smiled at Tony before letting out an unexpected, relieved-sounding sigh. Something about it puzzled Tony; even though in his lowest moment he oscillated back and forth between breaking up with Steve and worrying about losing him, it never occurred to him that Steve might have been fretting about them breaking up also.
Steve smiled meekly as he commanded himself to relax. He turned to face Tony more directly, immediately caught up in Tony’s scent reminiscent of his shower. Steve breathed deeply as he reached over to wrap both hands as best as he could around Tony’s waist. Tony let his body be pulled closer toward Steve who used the opportunity to run his hands along Tony’s backside. Steve gazed at Tony for a second or two before moving inward for a kiss. Tony kissed him back slowly as Steve held onto him even tighter. After a moment, Tony gently broke away, but he kept his hands on Steve.
He walked back inside the building up to the security desk. “I have an important package arriving this afternoon,” Obadiah began, staring the guard down, “please make sure it gets delivered to my office promptly and personally.”
“I thought maybe you needed another journal for your lab notes.” Steve explained as Tony fanned the empty pages.
performance.” Tony ended with the sharpest edge to his voice, simmering on Steve’s erratic behavior.
Leaning up against the opposite wall with his arms crossed, Fury scoffed before pushing himself away from the wall to stare down at Loki.
“Do you want to fuck me, baby?” He whispered, grinning at Steve.
She took in a deep breath. “I sent these sequences to the Synergy Team…”
. Tony hoped, his paranoia mixing a bit with apprehension.
, like some cynical cinephile.” Tony smirked as he effortlessly caught the returning rubber ball.
He bit his bottom lip and squeezed his eyes shut, just waiting for Tony to explode. But instead of righteous anger, all Steve heard was hysterical laughter.
Tony squinted his eyes again as he kept up the charade. “Yes, of course. Absolutely no mercy, whatsoever.” He then clenched a fist in faux rage.
Steve nodded as he rubbed Tony’s body with both hands again, kissing him slowly. Tony wrapped a hand around Steve’s neck, pulling him close before Steve flipped over onto his back as both tried to catch their breath.
He then tapped once more on the device he was holding before turning around. He tossed the device at the other scientist who clumsily caught it as Thanos briskly walked away.
Steve followed him, waiting for Tony to find his copy of the house keys before letting them inside. As soon as they entered, they were met with a lingering moth ball scent which was accompanied by a visual array of antique and modern-looking furniture covered in plastic and cloth sheets ahead of them. Steve looked around as Tony walked to the kitchen: the space ahead of the foyer looked like the living room which had a fire place in the middle; on the right of the living room was a small space that connected to the kitchen and then to what looked to be the dining room. Steve looked to his left to see a hallway that probably lead to more rooms.
Tony sighed again as he stopped what he was doing to rest his hands on his hips. He surveyed the kitchen before looking at Steve.
“Oh, what?” Obadiah snapped back to reality as he realized that one of the tech conference staffers was trying to get his attention.
Steve shook his head. “Every time we speak, I end up saying the wrong thing…that’s why I wrote him that stupid letter…”
“I knew Bucky through my mother’s friendship with his…we became close that way, especially when my mother needed help taking care of me…”
Peter indicated his eagerness by nodding energetically. “Ready!”
into you. You got that too nerdy smart guy thing going on.” Tony had waved his hand around as if it magically demonstrated Bruce’s attractive personality.
“How did you find out?” Dr. Selvig asked quietly, his voice trembling.
“Steve, you should call him…” Bucky paused, “…when have I ever steered you wrong? I’m with you till the very end…even when you’re too busy to hang out.” He teased.
At that point, Steve had looked over at Tony, both looking at the other as Shuri finished. Something about the way Steve was looking at him choked Tony up, so much so that he had to physically turn in his seat to look away from Steve.
“Sir,” J.A.R.V.I.S. interrupted suddenly, “Mr. Parker’s stress levels are higher than normal.”
“As long as you’re honest and cooperative this time, Loki. What happened in the lab cannot happen again, understood?”
“…and if anything, external forces have been trying to stop us since we started this project.” Steve crossed his arms.
Tony winced; he knew everyone was reacting to the fact that if he had been in the lab with Steve, the explosion would have definitely killed him. Yet that wasn’t the thing that was bothering him the most; he was too focused on Steve’s well-being to fully process that outcome.
“So, makeup sex is really hot between the two of us.” Tony exhaled after a moment.
Virginia Potts
Tony stared at Steve for a minute longer before pushing himself away from the table. Steve watched him walk over to one of the consoles.
Tony sat up straight in the bed, looking around his bedroom before nodding. “Uh, sure! Yeah just give me a minute. I’ll let you know when I’m close to your place.”
. You act all cute and innocent, but I’m on to you.” He answered, now practically wagging his finger in Steve’s face. To Tony, Steve was the one who kept sending mixed signals.
Tony rolled his eyes, but then looked away from Steve. “Rogers, it’s fine. You just caught me off guard, okay?”
“Do you know the name of the first computer?” Peter looked up at Tony intently.
Tony rose from his stool to hoist Peter onto his lap without missing a beat. The mask nearly slapped him in the face.
Tony kept his back facing him; he could hear small sniffling noises which prompted tears to slide down his own face.
handsome. Right, Tony?”
Sam paid for the tickets. He handed one to Steve as they entered the building and headed toward concessions.
“What about the mini reactor?” Steve added, “can that help somehow?”
“Well…ah!” He smiled up at Thanos, “this must have been a reference to the core.”
“Really?” Steve gawked at his friends, “of all the times when the two of you should be clamoring to offer your opinions?”
“Sam’s hanging out Shuri's tonight,” Steve chuckled, “I was just on the phone with him and it sounds like he might be staying over at her place…would, uh, you like to come over?”
“How many planets are in the solar system…,” Tony repeated as he looked over at Steve. He winked before looking back at Peter, “…nine.”
Whispering from the press pool grew in unison as Pepper motioned for Rhodey to take the podium. He confidently strode up to the podium, producing an official looking piece of paper to read from.
last night.”
Tony looked over at him, now waiting patiently for Steve to continue although he wore the most painful-looking expression on his face.
Steve nodded, walking up to Tony to kiss him before leaving the lab. “We’ll see you later, okay?” He smiled as he left, waving at Tony from the corridor.
“Tony, I look absolutely ridiculous.”
creepy.”
“Okay, Banner and Thor,” Tony pointed toward Bruce and Thor, while Steve was driving, “you two stay in the vehicle and Rogers and I will meet Romanov and Barton outside.”
“So, how’s Peter?” Pepper asked as soon as they were alone again.
“So, before I go all the way in, I can’t touch your cock, even though I really want to…” Tony massaged Steve’s hips, “I guess it’ll make you tense.” He kissed Steve as he pushed himself forward.
“Our world is becoming more unmanageable…and uh…and destructive by the minute…,” Steve could feel his nerves getting the best of him and he was only practicing with Tony.
Rhodey glanced at Tony before shaking his head. He leaned forward so that his forearms were on his thighs, hands crossed.
Steve shook his head, but he let it go; he wasn’t going to question Tony on how he chose to parent his child.
Natasha conveyed her sincerity. “Do you remember seeing anyone else working in the labs that night before going into Stark and Rogers’s?”
“…now, I don’t even care. The memories hurt, sure, but he wasn’t a father to me, and I was his biological son. He was cold…and calculating. He never told me he loved me…never told me he even liked me…”
Tony nodded, taking a moment to sit up. He breathed heavily as he hunched over. Peter sat down on the floor with him, patting him on the back.
“I took a few photos of the files before he got back…” Pepper sorely confessed.
“And shut the fuck up! You are
…” The colleague corrected, clearly weirded out by the scientist’s insistence on using such a bizarre name, “we can’t go further without the watch.”
Steve rubbed the back of his head, laughing nervously. “Thanks, again, Dr. Strange.”
obvious that he was in love with you…” he then turned to face Steve, “…it’s still obvious…”
“Tony.” Bucky coolly addressed Tony before walking up to Steve’s bed. Tony continued to watch Bucky as he took his time approaching.
“Thanks, Tony, but…” Steve paused for a moment, “actually, thank you, Tony. That would be great.”
After learning about Clint earlier that morning, Steve wasn’t sure how to process his emotions. After Tony and Bruce had taken the time to upgrade the device to the new recommended safety measures, Steve had been sure that the team would be able to use the device more effectively. Now one of his teammates was in the hospital and the program was at a standstill.
“S-Sorry…” He answered.
It was finally later in the week and Tony was on his way to have dinner with Pepper.
Tony yelped out loud, realizing that he had lost track of time. He whipped out his phone, tapping on his security app, seeing that Steve was indeed in the lobby. Tony pressed the button that allowed visitors to access the private express elevator before backing up against the kitchen island.
Steve, without wasting another moment, flung the blankets off his body as he got up from the bed to find something to wear. To Steve, Tony looked too distressed to drive, especially while it was still dark outside.
“Um no.” Tony nearly mumbled, turning around to stare at his friend.
“Wow,” Bruce’s voice materialized as they worked, “this is going more smoothly than I had hoped.” He joked.
Steve rolled his eyes at Tony before smiling at Peter. “I’m fine, Peter. Thank you for checking in on me.”
Steve nodded with a grin; he was amazed with how comfortable he was becoming with Tony’s sense of humor.
Bucky then looked around before slapping Steve on the ass with his bionic arm, causing his friend to yelp loudly as the few people standing between the aisles and the pharmacy technician turned to gawk at them.
Obadiah whistled loudly as he shut the front door before strolling to the sitting room in his penthouse. He had purposely missed the press event that evening to secretly review some contracts he was hoping to bid on for Thanos’s device.
Tony rubbed his chin as he proceeded to ignore Clint. “When are these shindigs, Thor?”
Nice work, Banner!
Steve sighed as he slowly walked into Stark Enterprises, making his way to the main space to find Bruce working alone. Steve walked ahead to the space he shared with Tony, but it was empty. Steve glanced at his wristwatch before he looked around, turning to walk back to the main space.
A strained silence appeared between them as Tony fought internally with himself, half accepting he had definitively missed his chance with Steve.
A smile crept up on Bucky’s face. Something about it was both relieving and unnerving to Tony. Bucky lingered before laughing to himself again. Tony shrugged as he tried to decipher Bucky’s mannerisms.
Steve peered over at Tony as he placed the Synergy device on the ground. Although he tried to not let his dream bother him, worrying about it had unfortunately translated into avoiding Tony a good part of the week until the day of the board presentation.
“I love you, baby.” Tony whispered as he hugged Steve against his body.
“Actually, that may work…” Shuri added before pausing to pose thoughtfully, “since the device is easily portable, we can take it with us to the resort and work on it during some down time…we don’t need the lab amenities to finish this last phase…and if it comes down to it, we can come back into the city if the worst happens…my brother’s resort isn’t too far away from here…and I’m sure he can get us back out quickly.”
it’s just a science fair, not a tech expo.”
After some time as the rest of the guests filtered in, the ambient noise hushed as music began playing. Everyone turned as they watch the bridal party walk through the space and up to the altar. Tony trained his eyes forward once Steve appeared, paired up with one of Shuri’s best friends before splitting apart to stand at the front on opposite ends.
He searched desperately around the balcony for some escape before seeing Bruce talking to some board members. Tony quickly walked up to the huddle, hooking his arm around his friend’s.
“…I, uh…” Tony started quietly, “…can only imagine, but that must have been tough…growing up.”
“Be on the lookout for the device in the future. I can truly guarantee that Synergy will not only save lives but will also make this world a better place.”
Tony looked even more surprised, so surprised that Steve wasn’t sure how to gauge his reaction.
“Steve, I really don’t want to talk about you and Sharon, okay?” Tony groaned loudly before Steve could punctuate the end of his sentence. He spun around to look over the railing again.
“Hey, Rogers.” Tony appeared in the living room stretching, “sleep okay?”
Bruce was eating dinner with Tony and Peter in the outsized kitchen in Tony’s penthouse housed in Stark Tower. Peter and Tony usually ate whatever the hired chef prepared for them, but Bruce had offered to make something for them, which Tony was grateful for. It was good for Peter to socialize with the people Tony respected the most. There was no way Peter would grow up isolated like he had.
“Well, you’ll become a tech expert after working on this for sure.” Tony called over. Steve smiled as he glanced over at Tony who was spinning around an image of the Synergy device. Unexpectedly, he couldn’t help but actually start to appreciate his lab mate’s handsome features, which he promptly mentally kicked himself for because they were supposed to be working, not ogling.
Tony nodded for Bruce to continue and Bruce nodded back emphatically. “…turns out that if we construct a mini reactor, we could use it to help the queue in the device.” He tapped a few times on a tablet he was holding to show Tony what was he was referring to.
you’re going to use this debacle as an opportunity to get close to said ex-boyfriend.
Tony shook his head. “You’re not taking advantage of me at all. Besides all the sex stuff, I would like to buy you things…I really don’t understand why you won’t let me be your sugar daddy.” He winked at Steve again, flaunting that alluring magnetism of his that first drew Steve to him.
“I’m just being realistic, Tony—” But before Bruce could finish his thought, Tony shouted “Rhodes!” as Van Morrison sang again “…I shall reveal you.”
Steve took his time slowly turning to look at Bucky. “He won’t let me get a word in whenever I try to explain…and I can’t just send him a text…I really messed up…”
“…of course…I…that felt so good.” Steve finally responded.
Steve sighed. He wanted to leave Malibu as quickly as possible; this whole amateur spying thing was starting to sound like a bad idea. However, he was glad that he had convinced Tony to let him tag along. Who knows what would have happened to him if he were alone?
The remaining team had split up into two separate helicopters to meet Strange at Mount Liberty before heading to the medical clinic in Harlem.
He placed an arm on an armrest, rubbing his forehead with his other hand, as he stared downward at the main drawer of his desk. He furrowed his brow, groaning again, as he scooted his chair closer to the drawer, opening it to find his mother’s ring. He studied it, placing it delicately in the palm of his hand, thinking about Steve wearing it, before quickly tossing it back into the drawer.
Steve chuckled as he watched Tony walk up to the island. “Maybe…we can find some time to spend together…the three of us I mean…maybe next weekend?” He stayed near the entrance to the kitchen before joining Tony at the island, “…well…I guess I don’t know what your plans are…”
sure, why haven’t you turned me in? That was like a fucking year ago, Thor. Where’s your evidence?”
“…do you think you would ever try to make things work with Ms. Potts again?” Something about Steve’s question seemed pained, which caught Tony off guard again.
Steve’s body jerked upward into Tony’s mouth as he entered. Tony grinned, holding Steve down with one hand while using the other to stroke him slowly as he licked him. Tony looked upward at Steve who had his eyes closed, moaning with Tony’s every movement.
The Synergy executive committee was meeting with the senior members of the board in the nicest conference room in Stark Tower. Obadiah was sitting at the head of the table giving his opinion on the next possible move for Synergy, facing Tony who sat on the exact opposite end of the table. As he spoke, Obadiah kept glancing furtively in Tony’s direction which annoyed Tony to no possible end.
Sharon laughed. “Yeah, I guess he never mentioned it. He talks about you all the time.”
As Steve reached his bike, slinging his work bag further onto his back before mounting, he thought about Tony which translated into thinking about not having met Peter. Steve sighed to himself: he knew he needed to hold back and give Tony some space. Steve usually operated that way, so he should allow Tony to do the same.
“That party was awesome. Tony’s so cool!” Sam nearly exclaimed on the subway ride home. Sam had more cocktails than he had expected and was basically leaning on Steve for balance.
“Uh, you wanted to see me?”
“…fuck, baby…” Tony moaned, pushing his body back onto Steve’s fingers.
Obadiah straightened up in his chair. He rolled his eyes again as he rose from his chair, walking over to the nearest window to look out onto the cityscape.
Tony laughed. “I’m a lot of things, but I can assure you that I’m
Tony had led Obadiah, and god knows who else, to believe they were sleeping together. Yet, Steve quickly forced the theory out of his mind; what would be the benefit of that?
Steve laughed at the suggestive tone in Tony’s voice. He opened his eyes again to see that Tony was sitting on the edge of the tub.
Both Steve and Tony stared after Clint, confused by the compliment.
Steve took his time approaching the console near Tony. It perplexed him to hear Tony talk about something personal considering how he had reacted when Steve asked him about Howard Stark yesterday. But Steve figured it was more a comment reflecting Tony’s efforts in trying to ease him into their working relationship than anything else.
Steve stared at Tony before looking back at his tablet, trying not to become more frustrated with Tony bringing up Sharon.
Steve walked out onto the balcony up to the ornate railing. “Wow, this place is beautiful.”
fires in our lab and that was before the workday started.”
Tony moaned quietly as Steve scooted them around in the bed to lie lengthwise. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck as Steve held him close against his body, letting his hands roam over Tony’s backside. He heard Tony make a few quiet noises through their kiss before breaking away to rub the tip of his nose into his neck, pushing himself more into Steve’s body. Steve pushed back until he had Tony completely on his back and he was above to the side. He reached out a hand to stroke Tony’s face.
“If you have to get back to Peter, I don’t mind, Tony.” Steve whispered as he drew nearer.
But before Peter could answer Tony, Steve had appeared at the entrance of the lab with a plate full of cookies. Both Tony and Peter looked at the other before dropping their tools to race toward Steve, nearly knocking Steve over as they grabbed at the plate.
“Wave back, baby.” Tony whispered to Steve, managing to do so without his mic picking up his voice.
Tony used a finger to scroll through the sequences before he landed on one to show to Peter. He hoisted the nine-year old up in the air to get a better look at the projection. Steve smiled as he quietly observed.
“Steve…hold on…” Tony sighed as he eventually let his arm drop, but Steve stood in place.
The two turned around as soon as youthful laughter drew near. Peter ran back into the kitchen with what looked like a pair of eyeglasses attached to a fake nose with a mustache. The glasses were also equipped with other items that had been glued to it like feathers, gems, and some other things Steve was unable to identify.
Tony kissed Steve before reaching for the bedside table. He almost toppled over again as Steve caught him before reaching for the table himself, finding a tube of lube and a condom. Both Steve and Tony looked at each other simultaneously, perhaps silently signaling exactly what they wanted in that moment.
“Peter,” Tony joined them, “you should ask Steve to be in your comic.”
Steve breathed deeply a few times.
I don’t blame you. You are hot. 😉
“Tony, I’m good. Promise.” Steve managed to mutter although he had the silliest grin on his face. Tony only responded by chuckling some more, keeping his hand firmly in place.
“Steve…” Tony figured he should just get on with it, “…I’m sor—”
As it appeared that Pepper was there to stay, Obadiah looked at her before holding up a finger at the press pool, shielding the microphone with one hand.
Steve caught himself. What was there to hide? Steve was genuinely trying to work on his friendship with someone he cared about. And he was close with Peter, so it was also important for Steve to see him.
Steve laughed quietly again. “Okay, I’ll see you in a bit.”
The security guard sitting at the desk glanced upward to see a mail carrier holding out a giant package over the counter.
To Tony, Steve looked incredibly confused.
“Tony! That’s great!” Bruce exclaimed, very much unaware of his own strength.
“I took the elevator!” Peter shouted with glee, holding up his watch which was also rigged for the nine-year old to program the private express elevator with ease.
Mr. Beck laughed. “Research and Development. My lab wasn’t too far away from yours.” He leaned forward a bit, “actually we ran into each other once. It was in the employee express elevator late one night…your husband was there too, I think.”
Tony laughed back before looking at Steve again who looked amused by the back and forth, but his expression short-circuited Tony’s thought process.
The lobby was empty save for the security guard at the front desk. On the way over, Steve scolded himself for not calling first. He knew he should have called, but he didn’t want to run the risk of Tony not answering. He thought that if maybe Tony saw him in the lobby, he would see that Steve was truly sincere about making amends.
“Well, you can make a mess all over me whenever you want, baby.” Steve felt him kiss the top of his head.
“Loki…”
“Hey, Rhodey,” Steve patted Rhodey on the shoulder as soon as he reached the group, “do you know where Tony went?”
Steve tapped his phone in the palm of his hand before rising from the bed. As he got ready for dinner, Steve told himself that he’ll just give Tony some space to figure things out, knowing he shouldn’t pressure him.
Bruce mouthed “I’m sorry” before covering his mouth, shocked by his action. Tony looked at Bruce then the phone then back at Bruce.
Steve waited with Tony until the car the latter had ordered arrived. He flinched a little as Tony reached over to give him a hug. He managed to hug him back, but it felt uncomfortable. Tony patted him on the shoulder with a grin before opening the door to the backseat.
They spent about a few hours on the process. Steve took notes as Tony worked at the console. It didn’t take much for them to find a sold rhythm; in fact, it surprised Steve that they were already working so well together.
“Yeah,” Tony felt himself getting surprisingly choked up, “he said something to me once…about how tough I was no matter what happened.”
Tony continued to stare at Steve, clearly ruminating over his comment. He laughed to himself before slowly approaching Steve.
“What? Is Steve Rogers born a woman this time?”
Steve smiled, but he looked confused. “Peter knows how to use a smartphone?”
Tony walked to the edge of the bed, shuffling around anxiously as if that had been the first he was alone with Steve in his room.
As the device finally stabilized, it generated the rest of the specs as Natasha and Clint carried a couple simulated people to the mobile clinic. Thor and Bruce busied themselves with assembling the equipment.
Tony took a moment before answering. He kept his arms crossed, looking side to side before looking directly at Steve. “Okay, fine, Rogers. But you have to promise me we’ll always work as a team.”
Steve breathed deeply as he held onto Tony. “Tony, I don’t want to hurt you.”
Tony groaned to himself as the memory of his antics during the first simulation popped into his head.
But instead of playing along, Steve’s expression turned stern again. He looked solemnly at Tony.
Tony smiled to himself as he finished his coffee before reviewing the specs once more.
Pepper made a sour face before pulling out her phone. She tapped on it a few times before handing it to Tony. Tony looked perplexed as he accepted the phone.
“You told me on the fucking phone before we came out here that you weren’t ready to be in a relationship,” Tony threw some clothes around without really picking anything to wear, “yet, we fucked last night and then you follow me into the shower. What the
Shuri looked back and forth between Tony and Bruce, still wearing a smile. “That’s a really great offer, Mr. Stark—”
Tony rose out of his chair, placing his hands on the table. "Obie, what the
Somewhat stunned at first, Tony immediately regrouped; after all, they were pretending to be married.
Everyone nodded. Steve adjusted his chair to get a better look at the map, but in doing so, he inadvertently scooted his chair closer toward Tony, which he had thought was physically impossible given the space. Tony didn’t seem to notice or didn’t care; he stayed in place with both elbows on the table.
Clint sighed. “All I remember is trying to find those damn numbers before my legs gave out.” He looked at Natasha before looking up at the ceiling.
As soon as the door closed behind them, Tony leaned up against the door. Bucky walked to the opposite side of the hallway, placing a hand behind his head, seemingly trying to come up with the best thing to say.
Steve cringed when Sam snapped another photo of him. “Oh, come on, Sam. Don’t put that on the world wide web, please.”
hottest fuck I’ve ever experienced. You are so
“Oh my god…” Steve and Tony turned around at the sound of Strange’s voice who had appeared behind them.
Steve laughed as he crossed his arms again. “That’s fine as long as it’s not one of you—or me.”
Peter nodded emphatically as he glanced at Steve before looking back at Tony. “If I win, could I also stay up an extra ten minutes?”
“Hey, Tony, sorry we couldn’t make it to your party over the weekend. Family members are starting to arrive in town for the wedding.” She rolled her eyes.
Tony walked up to the setup with Rhodey and Pepper, finding Bruce and Natasha already seated. They sat down, chatting for a bit, coupled in pairs with Tony sitting directly in the middle. As he listened to his friends, all he could think about was that the day had finally arrived where his friends were in great, healthy relationships and he had just gotten into an argument with his ex-boyfriend after having sex.
Tony’s facial expression contorted a little into a look of concern, but then he laughed again, seemingly fine. Well to Steve anyway.
Tony continued to smile, now on the verge of smiling ridiculously from how close he and Steve were. They laid like this before eventually falling asleep.
Steve nodded with a smile as he walked over to one of the tables to store his workbag.
“…we’ll get through this, okay?” Steve said quietly, but Tony wasn’t sure if Steve was referring to Synergy or their relationship.
“Perhaps you have a more effective way?” Thor grunted as he opened the other side of the backseat to tie up Loki with the cables.
“Hey…” Steve turned around to see Tony walking into the kitchen, but he stayed near the entrance.
“Do you think it’ll work, Tony?” Peter asked, looking incredulously at their creation.
“What about this?” Steve held the diary out for Tony to look at.
Steve gripped Tony’s arm tightly as he tried to shuffle around. “S-sorry…” He repeated, grimacing.
Despite Synergy’s lingering safety concerns, having been an active participant in the program led to a few great opportunities for Steve. He accepted a position with New York City’s public defender’s office that had an outpost in Brooklyn. That position was soon followed by a teaching opportunity at Columbia University after one of Steve’s former law school professors reached out to him once the project ended.
Ever since he left Tony’s penthouse, Steve had been trying to replay last night, but all the details were fuzzy. All he remembered was getting into an intense conversation with one of Thor’s friends about mythical or historical battles or whatever before waking up. The one thing he could remember, however, was his dream about Tony. Steve had woken up and fled in horror because he thought he had a dream about making out with Tony, and then, still thinking about it as he woke up, practically fondling Tony’s mattress.
Peter nodded slowly as he looked up at Tony. “I’m sorry, Tony…”
Sam laughed. “Yeah, okay, Steve.” He chugged the rest of his beer before tossing the bottle toward their recycling bin. It bounced off the edge. Sam groaned as he walked over to pick up his discarded bottle.
you want to me.” Tony responded as he pushed downward into Steve, grinding against his body. Tony took a moment to effortlessly remove his briefs before grinding on Steve again.
To keep operations at Stark Enterprises hidden from Obadiah during the Synergy closeout, Tony had been working more often in his home office in the penthouse. The office’s software and hardware were protected by an intricately constructed security system that only Tony had the access codes to. Also, if anyone attempted to break into the system, J.A.R.V.I.S. would self-destruct once triggered. However, Tony preempted losing his beloved computer system by creating an encrypted system that was only accessible through Peter’s wristwatch.
Tony laughed once more, but then he relaxed. “It was hot, relax, Rogers…and…don’t apologize and don’t ever feel embarrassed when you’re with me…especially when we’re like this…”
— Tony panicked as the phone rang a second time, irrationally thinking that Steve might be in bed with Sharon although he had just spent the last few minutes convincing himself that their relationship wasn’t serious.
Hi everyone,
Thor nodded slowly. “I want to see him.”
Tony continued in and out of him, groaning with every movement. Steve moaned as he felt his body push into the mattress; he could feel himself coming near the edge, and the feeling was unbelievable. Steve gasped and moaned, losing himself as Tony fucked him. He reached downward to feel himself, but then stopped. He then felt a hand on his cock as Tony stroked him and fucked him at the same time.
“Tony,” Bruce called from behind, “we need to figure out something quick. We can’t sit on this.”
“Why not?” Peter looked up at Tony intently.
Unfortunately, the rest of the weekend wasn’t so gentle with him. Steve ended up spending all of his free time obsessing over people thinking he was having sex with Tony. He wondered if anyone had ever mentioned it to Tony; he wondered what Tony would even think.
“Uh, w-what?” Was all Steve managed to get out.
“Hi, Steve!” Peter quickly responded before turning back to his game.
“Good morning, J.A.R.V.I.S.” Tony called through another yawn as he walked up the small console.
It was nice having you over for dinner…sorry about making you get a babysitter!
Sam nodded his head as he continued to listen.
After another hour, Steve and Tony paused for a break. They stood chatting in the lab for a couple minutes before they were interrupted by Clint, Natasha, and Thor.
“Let me introduce you to my teammates, Sam.”
He sighed to himself as he walked to his desk, slumping into the chair, scolding himself for even thinking about dating again. Tony groaned, placing his head into his hands as he rested his elbows on top of the desk. After a period of trying not to sob alone in his office, he leaned backward in his chair, sniffling.
Both Gamora and Nebula nodded. Thanos swiveled in his chair to face his computer monitor.
Steve got up from the bed to take a shower, meeting Tony later in the dining room. That day, they managed to go through the boxes in their target rooms before moving on to wayward items in the basement. That night, they ordered dinner again and went to bed late, exhausted from the work that day. To Steve, Tony appeared completely unfazed, but something about it was preventing Steve from talking to him about it, especially after having kept the diary against Tony’s wishes.
twelve hours?” Steve scrunched up his face in disbelief.
“Yeah, okay, Tony. But I’ll plan for when—if you end up staying over.”
“Look, Tony…” Bucky hung his head as he sighed to himself, “ever since Steve broke up with his ex-girlfriend, I’ve been maybe a little more than over protective of his feelings…uh...Steve is usually
Tony exhaled with relief. “Yes! You still have it?”
Tony cleared his throat after patiently waiting for Peter to finish telling him about his day.
Tony walked up to the counter, signing in on the hospital visitor list before making his way to Steve’s room. He waved at some of the nurses he had gotten to know while visiting Steve before entering the room. Tony hesitated near the door, watching Steve sleep; the machines hooked up to Steve were humming quietly. Tony sighed as he walked up to Steve’s bed, placing a tote bag on a bedside table before sitting down on the edge of the bed.
Tony made a face before looking down at his shoes. It was true that if he hadn’t stopped them, they probably would have slept together that night. But it wasn’t as if Tony had forgotten that crucial piece; he was more fixated on being open finally with someone about his dad.
Steve considered it as he waved back at Bruce. What was the worst that could happen? He might end up feeling miserable in the morning, but maybe it would do him some good to let loose once in a while. Although he was sure Tony was only joking, he knew his lab mate would ensure that he would indeed get home in one piece.
“Uh, are you sure, Tony?” Steve almost mumbled.
“And…you
“Did you take her to the vet?” Steve asked.
“Uh, is something up, Cap?” Tony teased.
Tony attempted a chuckle as he ran with Steve toward Peter. “So, I was joking when I said this will be ‘a science fair project that will end all science fair projects’.” But of course, the joke was lost on Steve.
Steve stared at Tony, waiting patiently. “Yes, Tony?”
. Steve thought.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., bring up an image of the Synergy device, please.”
“It just happened this past week, Tony. Why? Is this going to affect Sam’s security clearance?” He joked.
He then calmly walked over to his desk to call May about their plans, now seeming more relaxed and relieved that Steve would be there with him.
Tony glanced around the room quickly before taking a seat next to Steve who looked just as grave as everyone else. Natasha was standing near Thor on the opposite side of the table and Fury was perched at the front with his arms crossed. Tony took a moment before settling, lingering as he looked directly at Steve before acknowledging everyone else once more, noticing that Clint was missing. Bruce took a seat at the opposite head of the table. He looked just as confused by the subdued atmosphere as Tony was.
To anyone witnessing the exchange, it would have seemed as if being on a plane with each other for under an hour appeared to cure their dissipating camaraderie brought on from earlier in the week.
“I was distracted the last time…personal issues…you know the deal.” Tony nearly mumbled as he looked down at the device in his hands. He turned it around a few times as he heard Bruce sigh.
Tony nodded. “Could you take us there, please?” He smiled, causing the staffer to blush.
“Really? What’s the hold up then?” Tony could tell that Rhodey was trying to walk the balance between being happy for him and concerned.
Tony thought to himself as he held up shirt after shirt, not really looking at himself in the mirror.
“Good to go.” She answered as she and Clint maneuvered around one couple to get closer to another, which was their intended target for the evening.
Tony stopped laughing, wiping his eyes as he turned to face Steve. He kept his expression rigid to show that he was finally taking the conversation seriously.
Tony kept his eyes on his notebook. “Quota.” He carefully enunciated.
Steve turned to face Tony, and Tony could tell that Steve was trying to remain as calm as possible in front of their kid and his best friend, but his true feelings broke through the façade.
Tony nodded quickly. “Yes, of course! You can also spend the night…if you want…of course…”
Tony grinned to make the moment lighter, but he was so upset with himself for bringing up Pepper. “Uh, no. Definitely not,” he leaned closer over the table, “I’ll admit it took me a while to get over it, but we weren’t—aren’t right for each other.”
“Nice to meet you…Loki?” Steve hadn’t meant for the greeting to sound like a question, but similar to when he met Thor for the first time, he was confused by the choice in nickname, because surely “Loki” was not Thor’s brother’s real name.
“So,” Steve started, clearing his throat, “Sam just told me he’s planning on moving in with Shuri.” He offered causally.
As soon as they neared their target, Clint dipped Natasha who used the opportunity to pick the pocket of one of the men they were dancing next to, finding a computer chip. Clint then spun her around as she repositioned herself upright, allowing Clint to whisk them away from the couple.
Tony calculated the equations then read the solutions to Steve who quickly entered them into the device. The device began generating spec by spec. Everyone on the railing, this time including Obadiah, gazed down, amazed with the vibrancy of the device.
Steve, as he stopped a few feet in front of Tony, stared at him attentively. “Tony, don’t ever blame yourself for that. You know it wasn’t your fault.”
Steve nodded slowly as he motioned for Tony to come inside. Tony walked into the apartment, waiting for Steve to close the door. Tony looked around the space as he felt Steve rub his back before walking ahead of him.
“Please,” Lupho practically got into Tony’s personal space, also shooting him daggers, “enjoy the party. We’ll have one of our people send for you in a moment.”
Tony gave the officer a thumbs up before waving for Steve to follow him inside the precinct. As they entered, they were met with semi darkness: all of the lights in the building had been turned off which cultivated the eeriest vibe as Steve and Tony took their time entering. Tony handed the Synergy device to Steve before pulling a tablet out of his bag.
Tony moaned again as he felt Steve’s hand travel underneath his shirt, rubbing the top half of his body before Steve began yanking the shirt off. Tony sat up to let Steve tug his shirt off, now basically straddling Steve’s lap. Steve wrapped one hand around Tony to lie him back down on the bed on his back. Tony pushed upward into his body with both legs drawn up against Steve’s sides.
“I just did what you told me, Tony,” Steve smiled, “we worked together.”
Steve blushed instantly, taking the ring off quickly to place back into the jewelry box; he wasn’t sure how to respond, although the comment made him feel warm inside.
Steve sighed but then he smiled. “Tony? Really?”
“Yeah, I don’t trust him either, Rogers. I’ve got Pepper on it.” Tony answered him with confidence as if he could read Steve’s mind.
Not long after, Tony and Steve were back in their lab. Tony was leaning up against a table, arms crossed, as he watched Steve parade in front of him, modeling a pair of the team’s new safety uniforms.
Tony slammed the door to his office close before throwing his work bag to the other side of the room. He looked around the office for something else to throw, until his saw in the corner of his eye a framed photograph of himself with his mother during a family vacation when he was little. Tony had found it while going through the boxes at the house out in the Hamptons. He stepped to the bookshelf and grabbed the frame. He paused for a moment as he looked at the photo before placing the frame back down on the shelf.
Steve cleared his throat again. “Synergy has the ability to replicate any material possible…due, uh, to its vibranium core,” Steve kept his eyes on his notes before looking up at Tony, “it’s not only stable, but efficient.”
Tony counted to himself while breathing deeply, wiping his eyes as he turned slightly to exit the bedroom.
Peter sat up straight on the floor as he continued. “Do you know the name of the first person on the moon?”
Tony felt the color drain from his face. His mouth bobbed open a few times as he tried to answer, now feeling his face turn red.
As soon as they were left alone, Tony scooted closer toward Steve.
Strange held out a clipboard to read Tony’s medical chart. “We had to do some extensive reconstructive surgery on your arm which had been severely injured in the blast…” he took a moment as he read down the chart, “everything else is fine, but I suggest taking it easy for about a month.”
As he listened to Fury explain Clint’s condition, Tony clenched his fists on top of the table. He felt a hand caress his shoulder, turning to see that Steve was attempting to calm him down while still facing the group.
“You know, Cap,” Bucky leaned forward to sip from his coffee mug, “this coupled with the whole couple suite fiasco, I’m surprised you guys haven’t fucked
Bruce marched to Loki’s chair, wedging himself into Loki’s personal space. “Oh, you won’t like me when I get angry.” He slowly responded, never breaking eye contact with Loki.
Meanwhile, Tony was standing near Rhodey, but he was close enough to Bruce and Natasha who were standing not too far away by themselves.
“Oh, well…” Tony added, too shocked to elaborate.
Forget losing control of the original Synergy project; this impending crisis was now becoming the nightmare Tony had been dreading the most and there seemed to be no clear path ahead of him. Needless to say, as Tony quickly came up with a feasible game plan, there was too much on the line to make a snap decision in the heat of the moment.
“Well, that’s great.” Tony began as he handed Steve a plate, “I’m glad you’ll have your squad back.” He tried for as lightheartedly as possible which seemed to work because Steve just grinned at him before picking up a utensil to eat.
it that you do?” Fury crossed his arms as he glared at Clint.
Tony slammed a pillow against his face and silently screamed. It had been a while since he had the nightmares. Maybe seeing Pepper had triggered them again.
Tony counted in his head, taking a deep breath; he was trying to forget about his conversation with Obadiah and instead focus on the positive aspects of his relationship with Steve; how well Steve got along with Peter; and how close they were becoming despite Tony’s worries in the beginning.
She smiled back at him as she walked ahead. “Thank you, Bruce.” She answered in a low voice. Bruce could barely respond he was so entranced.
Bruce sighed in between bites. “She’s not interested. Trust me.” He mumbled as he sank lower into his chair.
Steve scrunched up his face, trying not to look so shocked. “Uh…what do you mean?” He asked slowly, his hand now sliding away from Tony. Based on the interaction from earlier that night, Steve knew he needed to choose his words carefully, but he wasn’t sure what to say.
“Uh…” Bruce said after a moment, “…this can’t be right…” He waved for Shuri to look at the tracker.
Tony sighed, trying not to lose his cool over the whole situation. He pinched the bridge of his nose. “I don’t understand. Peter would have said something about this.”
Steve glanced downward at the desk drawer with the chip inside.
“Steve, I need to tell you something before I go down there…” Tony rested both hands on Steve’s face, “this is absolutely
Steve kept smiling before his expression changed slightly. He then walked up to Tony, giving him a tight hug. Tony, somewhat surprised by the suddenness of the hug, took a second before hugging Steve back. They embraced each other for some time before Steve let go to kneel in front of him, which quickly freaked Tony out; he wasn’t sure if Steve was about to propose or offer him a blow job.
“We only did the best that we could do, Tony…” Steve quietly offered, still standing quite a ways away from Tony at the entrance of the lab.
Pepper chuckled. “Wow. Never thought I would live to see the day when you admit that someone knows one of your projects better than you,” she teased, “he was definitely a good choice then.”
“Tony, how can I—we trust you,” Steve pointed to everyone else in the room as he corrected himself again, “if you’re not honest about the project?”
“…uh…” Tony started up again, looking away from Steve toward the bathroom, “…uh—sorry.” Tony squiggled underneath Steve who looked confused by Tony’s reaction. Tony finally feed himself before jumping off the bed and racing to the bathroom, slamming the door shut behind him.
kidding me?” His heart started beating with the hugest wave of embarrassment. It was already bad enough that he humiliated himself on the regular, but now his friends were, too?
Obadiah sat down in his desk chair after unbuttoning his suit jacket. Steve sat down after, waiting patiently for Obadiah to continue. Obadiah leaned backward in his chair. He appeared to be studying Steve; He took almost a whole minute to speak.
“Thanks,” Tony shrugged, “…I really needed that.”
have an aesthetic opinion.”
, he liked it a lot but would never admit so to Sam.
“…I was working on something for a school competition and I got a
Then, without any warning, Tony slid an arm around Steve’s shoulder, which prompted the latter to blush right on cue.
Steve pulled away to look at him intently. “Let me take care of you tonight, okay?” He whispered softly as he rubbed Tony’s cheek.
Steve nodded, swearing quietly to himself as he gasped loudly, coming into Tony. Tony couldn’t help himself as he felt Steve come inside of him, rubbing his cock harder as he came all over his body and Steve’s.
Tony finished tucking Peter’s blanket underneath him. “What’s up? And keep in mind that you only have a few minutes left until official bedtime.” He said through a grin.
“…and let’s try not to alarm everyone while we’re here, shall we?” Tony concluded, before pointing to Steve.
Steve groaned as he pushed away from Tony, tossing a pillow at him.
Pepper sighed. “Tony, I’m getting a really bad feeling about this.”
“Okay, you have to keep this a secret. This is just between you and me, okay?”
"Boytoy then, it doesn't matter," Obadiah interjected, "the thing that does matter is the solvency of this company and Stark Industries can't survive if its namesake is out gallivanting with whomever so happens to be sleeping in your bed at the moment."
Steve watched as Tony looked away from him, unaware that he was causing Tony so much stress on top on the arms dealers confrontation. Steve hesitated before continuing again.
“Tony, are you sure you’re okay?” Steve asked quietly.
irritated that Obie is sabotaging Synergy.”
“That’s fine. Anthony sent out a memo that he’ll be back from the west coast tomorrow afternoon.” Obadiah volunteered.
But Tiberius held still as he leaned inward to stare at Tony before looking over in Steve’s general direction.
“Well, what?” Steve blinked a few times. He didn’t like the sudden shift in his friend’s tone.
“Okay, have fun.” Sam was in the kitchen drinking a cup of a coffee as Steve passed the opening, carrying an overnight bag on his way out to work.
“Uh…nice to see you two ladies on such a lovely evening…” Obadiah managed as he straightened himself out.
. Steve’s…” He waved a hand around a few times as if that explained who Sharon was while laying heavy emphasis on her name as if it hurt to say it out loud.
Steve waited as they lingered on the couch; he wasn’t sure what to do next.
Tony moved toward him. “Steve, I—”
Loki kept grinning, but then his face relaxed as he rested both hands on his hips. “Sorry to hear about Clint.”
It was early in the evening and Tony was sitting in a nice, quiet restaurant with Pepper, still sulking over the fight he had with Steve the past weekend. Tony had made dinner plans with Pepper a while ago; part of him wanted to cancel, but he needed some sort of distraction from the argument with Steve and his lingering suspicion that Steve was possibly keeping something from him.
“We’ll have to reconvene with our team before we speak with you further.” Whoberis said coolly, not even taking a moment to acknowledge Tony directly.
Tony smiled, telling himself not to take a hold of Steve’s hand. He turned to face him.
“Iron Man?”
As soon as it stopped, Steve and Tony almost fell out into the foyer before running toward Tony’s bedroom. Steve grabbed Tony by the waist again as they entered, pulling them down onto the bed. Tony kissed Steve as he tried to remove his uniform, but the intensity between the two made him fumble.
Tony couldn’t help his heart from beating any louder; he dreaded what he was about to hear next.
Nebula looked down at her sister’s hand on her arm before yanking away. “Don’t let father hear you say that. He’ll get rid of you before Stane.” She answered sharply.
Steve let out a gasp as the finger entered further, eventually hitting a spot he had never felt before and it sent a rush throughout his body.
Natasha sighed as she rested her hands on her hips. “It took some work; whoever’s been doctoring the security footage did one hell of a job.”
Being addressed by Tony must have given the student the hugest wave of confidence.
Steve shook his head. “No, I’ve definitely moved on.” He looked up at Tony and smiled. To Tony, something about it seized his heart.
“Tony…are you okay?” Steve asked quietly.
Tony turned around to peek at Steve through the glass; it appeared as if his lab partner was trying to give him some space to figure out babysitting logistics. He gave Steve a thumbs up which prompted a smile from the latter.
Tony made a whiny noise. “What? Why? I thought he was going with Bruce?” Although Tony had been impressed with Steve’s resume, he didn’t feel like hand holding the newest team member, especially with all the background shit going on at Stark Industries and in his personal life.
Tony grinned as he accepted the box from Steve, opening it quickly to see that it was a journal with a felt cover.
Steve turned pink again. He wasn’t sure how to respond, especially with Tony standing not too far away.
Tony swallowed, taking a chance. “If the two of you were living in the same city, would you try to make it work?” He asked, almost annoyed with himself that he had. He hoped he didn’t sound desperate.
date.” Sam nudged Steve in the arm as the elevator made its way up the tower.
The crashing sound from the waves woke Tony up instantly. He tried sitting up straight but then realized that he was tangled up with Steve on the latter’s bed in their hotel room. Terrified, Tony tried to pull himself free as his companion slept but began jerking around too much. He yanked on a blanket that had been wrapped around his leg and Steve’s body, but the force of the pull and his increasing panic propelled him off the side of the bed.
Steve nodded a few times; his face was flushed. “S-sorry, Tony.”
“…I would love to, Bruce.” Natasha answered.
“Tony…oh my god…Tony…” Steve whined, holding a pillow underneath his head.
thing you could help me with.” He grinned widely before continuing, “you could take a shower with me, you know to save water and money, or whatever.” He ended by waving his hand around casually.
“Welcome back, Sir.” J.A.R.V.I.S. greeted as normal.
Tony coughed before looking up at Steve. “Uh, would you like to stay over? I know it’s a weeknight and all, but—”
Steve sighed, trying to turn over to face Tony more directly, wincing from the pain.
Tony smiled as he unstrapped the robot. “We might need to take the arms off, but it should be good. I made sure to measure the width before we moved forward.”
Rhodey laughed nervously as he patted Tony on the shoulder to get him to focus. “There’s a question about the near infinite number of items that the device can replicate.”
After a minute or so, Tony turned slowly to directly face Steve. He swallowed before responding. Steve began to fidget due to how uncomfortable the situation had become. Without answering verbally, Tony nodded before rising from the chaise lounge; his expression suddenly switched as if they just hadn’t had a very awkward and tense conversation.
Loki groaned loudly once he saw Thor approach his small table on the sidewalk next to a café. The two hadn’t seen each other for about a month now and sporadically since the Synergy program had been officially abandoned. However, Fury had been intermittently tracking Loki and Dr. Selvig as part of S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol.
“You know what,” Steve sighed before looking away from Tony, “you got a lot of nerve giving me a hard time when you still see Pepper, Tony.”
“Hey guys!” Bruce greeted a little too loudly.
“Use your fingers, baby.” Tony whispered.
“…I guess he left the company. And it was not pretty…”
Ever since seeing Steve in person since their breakup, Tony couldn’t stop thinking about him. After they broke up, Tony suffered through a serious bout of depression that led him to drinking constantly. The episode had happened mostly while Peter was away at a summer camp for a couple months, but Tony had managed to get himself together before the worst happened. During that time, he had also received every single one of Steve’s messages and calls but was too upset with himself and how their relationship ended to answer.
Thor’s laughter subsided as his attention was caught by something out of the corner of his eye.
Steve’s smile widened, instantly making Tony feel warm inside. “Deal.” He agreed.
“I found it in the kitchen…” Peter answered quietly.
Obadiah nodded as he followed the staffer inside one of Middleton University’s main buildings connected to the roof helicopter landing pad. Roosevelt Island included an extension of the university’s campus that focused on technology and innovation, and it was also the site of the international tech conference that would officially begin that evening.
Tony nodded but then he groaned loudly, remembering the same advice Pepper had given him a while back.
“Thanks for driving us, Steve.” Ned leaned forward to smile at Steve who smiled back.
Tony turned around with a huge grin on his face before he used his fingerprints to access the private express elevator.
Tony inhaled deeply as he knocked on the door to Steve's apartment. He waited a minute before the door opened to reveal Steve.
Steve had trouble comprehending Tony’s reaction last night; while he was recovering at Tony’s, Steve believed that he, Tony, and Peter were becoming close, almost like a family. Steve didn’t understand why Tony didn’t seem to feel the same way.
Tony blushed before nodding. “I think so. I’ll let you know how it goes.”
“Tony, I’m not doing this.” He crossed his arms as soon as he made sure his towel was secure around his waist.
“Oh, okay.” Steve smiled as he wrote his name and signature on the sheet.
Steve nodded as he watched Tony pack up his things. He then looked up at Steve with a coy expression.
Steve stopped rubbing Tony’s back. “But what, Tony?”
“…everything appears fine. But…” She trailed off, glancing upward quickly to acknowledge Tony and Bruce.
Steve nodded again, unable to stop himself from smiling even wider. He let Tony hold onto him for a while, almost falling asleep. Not too long after, they eventually untangled themselves to change the sheets before calling it a night.
Thor noticed Steve’s apprehension and chuckled. “When we were children, everyone referred to us as Thor and Loki. My brother is quite the trickster!” Thor slapped his brother’s shoulder once more before Loki finally reached out his hand to greet Steve.
Tony sighed as he reached over to rub Peter’s back. “It’s okay. Just don’t do it again.”
Steve smiled at Peter who was now turning red from the attention, but before he could contribute, they heard the front door unlock to the apartment.
Obadiah looked at Thanos then at the device. It looked more or less like the device Tony and his team had constructed with a few modifications that could be gleamed from Howard’s original schematics. The original device that Thanos had constructed with the help of Dr. Selvig and the parts Loki had stolen from Stark Industries had been used as a guide to build this new weapon. Thanos also bought a shipment of vibranium off the black market after the Wakandans curtailed their exports once Synergy shut down.
“Steve! Steve!” Peter had appeared suddenly in the room, waving around a few dozen sheets of paper that comprised his comic. He ran up to Steve, tugging on his sweatpants.
Steve stared at him as Tony tried to visually convey that he was fine. After a second or two, Steve finally let go of him so they could walk to their lab.
Peter giggled. “That’s the same thing!”
“Mr. Stane, I’m going to try to say this respectfully, but you have no idea how much work Tony’s put into ensuring the team’s safety.”
“Uh, do you think…” Tony began, turning around to lean up against is his console, “…I should invite Steve to the thing I’m having at my place next weekend? That’s not desperate, right?”
Eventually, Peter successfully parallel parked into the spot. Steve patted Peter on the shoulder before exiting the car.
Peter shook his head quickly. “He stays over a lot during the week and on the weekends…”
"Tony, I'm not saying I won't spend night," Steve laughed nervously, "just that we probably need some space…I think I've been here for too long and we probably just need a break…"
Steve continued to fuck Tony with his fingers before Tony sat up straight again. He rocked his hips forward slowly, smiling down at Steve before positioning his body to lower down onto Steve’s hard cock. Steve closed his eyes and moaned as Tony’s body squeezed his cock, bucking upward into Tony as soon as he was all the way in.
“No powers.”
Obadiah stared back at Tony as he clasped his hands together, still leaning to the side in his chair.
. Tony thought to himself again as he plopped his head into his hands. But before he could feel more miserable, Tony felt a hand on his shoulder. Mustering up enough sensibility to not appear like a love-sick fool, he turned around to greet Steve.
Steve sighed as he looked downward before looking directly at Tony. “To be honest…I kind of wished you had said something earlier…”
Steve rolled his eyes. “My mother used to make this for me all the time, so it was easy.”
Alternative Universe set a few years after the end of Synergy, and Peter’s high school is planning a trip for the honors students to spend a week in Venice. Tony and Steve, being the parents that they are, wade through normal relationship drama/comfort while also trying to save their kid from a deranged ex-Stark Industries employee who also so happens to be Peter’s science teacher.
“Shit,” Tony stopped for a second, “I don’t have a condom.”
“Team, I know this doesn’t look good, but—”
Steve smiled before leaning downward to kiss him back. “But I will this weekend.” He reminded Tony.
As Tony approached, the doors opened to reveal Steve who also looked stressed and worn, however also seemingly managed to keep it together better than Tony.
Tony squeezed his eyes shut. He wanted to be with Steve so badly, but he couldn’t do it like this. Steve wasn’t that type of person and Tony didn’t want to be with someone like that. Not anymore anyway. He had gravitated toward Steve because he was different, and Tony didn’t want that to change. He realized he wanted to wait and get to know Steve better than ruin anything between the two of them with meaningless sex.
“Yeah, he seems really excited to finally meet you.” Steve volunteered as casually as possible although he didn’t want to talk about Sam wanting to meet Tony.
Steve nodded as he tilted his chin upward to kiss Tony. “I hope it’s not awkward.” He teased.
thing I would want to do, Pep.”
“I asked you over here, Tony, because I know you have trouble sleeping.” Steve turned around to look directly at Tony, “you know me…why…why would you
“…we’ll have to do a couple things to get you loosened up, baby…” Tony whispered.
“What?” Bruce looked at Steve, “wait, don’t you know?”
Both Peter and Tony laughed loudly in response to Steve. Steve settled against a table, watching them work with an amused grin on his face.
Steve turned a bit at the mentioning of Loki’s name. He was halfheartedly listening to Tony and Bruce, but now mostly focused on the external conversation.
Tony smiled as he thought about seeing Steve at Stark Enterprises, his nerves subsiding somewhat.
“And I just told him that you have some very personal issues to deal with. No details, I promise.”
Tony shook his head a few times. “No. Everyone else is also unaware. Even Fury. Banner and I are the only ones…”
“This is probably one of those instances where being a hero just makes you look ridiculous.” Tony teased, yet communicated that he was serious about Steve’s continued recovery.
On top of that, Steve hadn’t seen Tony all day to ask for advice on how he should proceed with meeting Obadiah but figured he could convey neutrality easily while also being on guard. Also, if anything about the meeting appeared awry, Steve would make sure Tony was aware.
Tony laughed quietly. “Aren’t you the one who would stop at no cost to save Synergy? Well, here’s your chance, Rogers.”
“Okay!” Peter jogged out of the kitchen to his room, leaving Tony alone, sulking over Steve and Peter missing each other.
“Don’t say a word.” Steve half-jokingly, yet half sternly commanded. Sam put up his free hand in surrender before chuckling some more as Steve plopped down on the couch. He exhaled deeply as he put his hand over his face, head leaning back.
“Yep.” Steve responded before practically spinning around on his heels to exit the room. He didn’t wait for Tony as he quickly marched to the elevator doors, pressing the button to the lobby a few times in a complete state of panic.
Steve scooted to the middle of the bed. “Tony, come on. You know that’s not what I meant.” He watched Tony walk to the end of the bed.
Steve smiled, which eventually got Tony to smile back at him, albeit something about it felt off to Steve. They finished their breakfast in near, if not complete silence before Steve needed to get ready for his physical therapy session.
Yet something about Tony going straight to the possibility of sex instead of apologizing for treating him the way that he had confused Steve about what to do next. Tony had broken up with him; he was the one who ignored him. Why should he forgive Tony so quickly after what had happened between them?
Tony lingered before nodding again. Steve watched him rise from the bed and shed his clothes before sliding underneath the covers on the bed. Steve waited a bit before joining, rubbing Tony’s back as soon as he laid down. Tony was facing away from him, but Steve pulled him close to his body.
“You don’t have to make breakfast, Steve.”
“Thanks, Mr. Rogers.” The nurse took the clipboard back, “you can leave whenever.”
“I can pick you up from your place then we can take Peter over to May’s.” Tony finished, dizzy from the kiss.
“I’m only working on this because my dad began it. He couldn’t even figure out how to get the damn thing to work.”
“There you go, Banner!”
Tony choked back a sob as he nodded his head. “Yep.” He felt Steve’s hand linger on his shoulder before he finally let go.
“Could I borrow your phone while it charges?” Tony asked meekly as he finally remembered how to act like a human.
Bucky waved his hand with a grin. “Hopefully it won’t come to that, but he’ll play nice since it’s his graduation.”
“Am I allowed to say that this is really fucking hot?” Tony murmured as the elevator shot up to the penthouse.
Steve looked toward the direction of the dining room, making sure Tony couldn’t see him. Without further hesitation, he grabbed the diary from the pile of junk, walking briskly to his overnight bag to place the diary inside underneath his clothes.
“Okay, I’m back in…maybe I can use a coin or something…” Tony searched around the room as the device continued making the horrible sound.
Steve attempted a smile, but his expression morphed into a cringe as he thought about Bucky’s implication.
To Steve, Tony appeared astonished that he was willing to dance with him. Steve thought it was cute but was wary of making Tony feel more insecure about it.
Pepper looked back and forth between Tony and Obadiah, still extremely confused. Obadiah lingered before clapping his hands together, making the situation even more awkward than it had already been.
Tony’s expression turned coy. He shuffled around shyly, before making his way over to join the group.
Steve glanced at Bruce once more, who only shrugged once more before turning around to walk over to the console with the exploded Synergy device. Steve watched him walk away before sprinting out of the lab to catch up with Tony. He managed to catch up with his new partner before he disappeared down another corridor.
Steve turned toward Tony, who looked to be on the verge of cracking up himself.
“Tony said I can look at it when it’s stable.” Peter chimed in, slightly stumbling over the word “stable”. He was bouncing in his chair as he listened to Bruce explain the project. Bruce was really trying to have a conversation with Tony, but his friend’s attention was occupied elsewhere; Tony was holding his phone underneath the table while facing slightly away from Peter and Bruce.
“Maybe the two of us should follow that advice.” She grinned, simultaneously kind while letting Steve know she too was on to him and his relationship woes.
After all, Obadiah must have known that the buyers out in Malibu were connected to Thanos and Loki’s firing was still very much suspicious. Even so, Tony knew the board wouldn’t believe him considering his past image, so he needed Loki to say out loud that Obadiah was involved.
Steve slid one hand down Tony’s neck, rubbing it before moving it further down his body while keeping the other on Tony’s cheek. Tony leaned in, rubbing Steve’s backside with both hands. Steve turned them around before laying Tony on top of the bed. Tony scooted up the bed as Steve met him, they resumed kissing as Tony spread his legs while the top half of his body was propped against the headboard. Steve pushed his body down in Tony between his legs as Tony hugged him against his body.
science teacher. Boy, I’m bad with faces…and I guess names.” He shrugged with a laugh.
“Maybe this weekend, the three of us could do something together?” Steve asked.
Tony chuckled as felt himself finally gaining control over his emotions and feelings toward Steve.
“Well, maybe…” He tried. He thought maybe he should clarify this terribly awkward situation, but then he thought about how apprehensive Tony acted around him last night, which seemed unusual to Steve; he was used to Tony flirting more and instigating it.
“…I snooped through Loki’s personnel file in Obadiah’s office when he was out…” She added before groaning.
The officer’s mouth dropped open as she glanced at Tony then the device then back at Tony before craning her neck to gawk at Steve. Tony nodded at her with a widening grin as the realization set in.
Bruce, who was also sitting at the conference table next to Pepper, turned in his chair to address the group.
“What do you think of the new upgrades to the device?” Tony began, determined to change the subject to avoid looking silly.
“Stark. Rogers. I need you to get to Mount Liberty ASAP. There’s been an incident involving a visiting diplomat…” Before Tony could finish his sentence, Fury’s voice filtered in through their earpieces.
Clint nodded as he motioned for her to hand him a water cup with a straw in it. “Yep. It might have been one over, but it was close.”
“What, Rogers? If I do what?” Tony filled in the pause for Steve.
But instead of giving Tony a hard time about it, Strange kept smiling at Steve. “Well, I’m glad Tony’s capable of kind word,” he grinned before turning around to reenter the room, “but, he’s not so bad either.” Strange’s last statement prompted a loud groan from Tony.
“Hi. I’m Steve Rogers. I’m here for—”
“Hi.” Tony walked to the front desk as he addressed the security guard who immediately jumped at the sound of his voice.
Pepper inhaled deeply as she shook her head. “No, Tony. That was for a company press conference. We had plans to go to Fratelli’s, but you forgot and scheduled that event instead.” Pepper’s voice never faltered; she gazed intently at Tony.
Steve let Tony’s cock slide out of his mouth before he laid on top of Tony, unzipping his pants, pulling down his briefs to grind his exposed hard cock against Tony’s. Steve pushed downward into Tony who pushed upward, his hands clenching at Steve’s backside before grabbing his ass.
“So, uh…” Tony started up, trying to refocus on his plan and Synergy, “I have some things I would like to test out before Shuri and Banner go back to working on the device…”
Steve let go of Tony knowing that he did all he could, but it still didn’t seem to work. Tony grabbed his suitcase before rushing out the bedroom much like he had after their last argument. Steve watched Tony leave before sitting on the edge of the bed again.
Thor chuckled heartily. “Indeed!”
Everyone else looked at each other before Steve turned to face Tony directly. “Tony, what do we do? This is serious.”
“What does the wizard look like?” Peter continued with the ruse.
Tony stared at Steve before staring at the woman, just realizing that he didn’t even see her enter with Steve while also realizing that they were there together, like possibly on a date.
“We didn’t think we would have any showing from Stark Industries this year, so it’s wonderful to have you here, sir.” The staffer continued as he showed Obadiah into the room.
Steve’s jaw went ridged as he realized that Tony was more upset than he initially realized. He nodded slowly as he placed both hands on Tony’s arms in an effort to calm him down.
Steve didn’t seem to notice, however; he laughed instead. “Yeah, it’ll be great because I’ll get to see Bucky almost everyday now instead of once in a while.”
Tony turned slightly to gauge Bruce’s reaction. Bruce nodded as he crossed his arms. “Yeah, I can tell, Tony…” He said with a sincere expression, “but please don’t let that be the reason why you won’t talk things through with Steve.”
“It is now half past six, Sir. Mr. Parker should arrive in a few minutes based on past received data.” Tony sighed after J.A.R.V.I.S. informed him once again of the time; he had barely finished the thing he was working on.
Steve watched Tony shuffle through a few playlists before landing on one he was the happiest with; Al Green’s “Let’s Stay Together” saturated the lab. Tony spun around and sauntered back to the table in time with the music, resuming his position on top the table after retrieving the wayward rubber ball. Steve grinned as he continued to observe him; it was nice getting to see this side of Tony.
“Uh, should we go to our space?” Steve asked, looking behind himself as the group left the main space.
Obadiah walked briskly out of the building as he pulled out his phone from the inside lining of his sports coat. He groaned to himself, realizing that he was receiving a call, and not one he was looking forward to.
“Uh, sorry…” Tony quickly picked up the clothes and the tablet, tossing them into his suitcase before motioning for Steve to lie on the bed. Steve looked at Tony then the bed before looking back at Tony again.
“Sorry for causing a fuss about it.” Steve offered meekly before picking up the device.
Steve had never been in the presence of such a diverse group of people. The project was becoming more of a reality, but that didn’t intimidate him at all.
Thor embraced Bruce in a tight hug. “This was indeed quite a glorious endeavor!” He shouted with glee, still holding Bruce.
Some crumpled-up pieces of an iron frame that once held up a section of the bleachers landed in front of the group. Ned screamed as Peter pulled him further away from the rubble.
couple suite fiasco, Steve?" He repeated sternly.
“Of course, but you’re already being helpful by being an effective teammate.” Tony answered with a smile.
Steve laughed as he turned to follow Clint. “Of course, I’ll see you at the island.” He then jogged down the hallway.
Thor leaned forward to place his hands on the edge of the table. “I haven’t spoken with him since he left Stark Industries…I heard that they had taken him to a police station, but someone else paid for his bail before I could get there…he also hasn’t been answering his phone….but I am sure I will find him at Jotunheim…”
“How do you feel?” Tony asked quietly as Steve spooned him from behind.
“Yeah,
Steve’s office assistant popped her head into his office. “Mr. Rogers? There’s a visitor here to see you.”
“Did you like what I did to you in the car?” Tony asked quietly as he kept rubbing Steve’s arm.
want him to find us like this?” He questioned, heavily emphasizing the word “don’t” as he seemed to be analyzing Steve’s behavior.
Bruce and Shuri looked at each other before facing Tony again. After a moment they reluctantly agreed with him before Tony dictated some more instructions.
Another period of uncomfortable silence passed as the room was only filled with the sound of muffled crying from both Tony and Steve. Tony stopped himself by inhaling and exhaling deeply, telling himself he needed to turn around, face Steve, and explain himself. After all, he did owe him that.
Tony flinched. “Hold the fuck up. What’s this about, Fury? This is one of Thanos’s daughters,” he pointed at Gamora, “Rogers and I met her out in Malibu.”
Steve shook his head. “I don’t remember what happened between leaving Thor’s party and waking up this morning…”
As it became clear that his friend’s thoughts were occupied elsewhere, Bruce halted in the middle of the hallway with his arms crossed. Tony kept walking, completely unaware that Bruce was no longer walking beside him.
The two sat in silence for a bit before Peter spoke up.
“Banner. Rogers and I are about done.”
Tony felt his face flush as he smiled back at Steve. He was surprised that their conversation at dinner hadn’t erupted into the explosive dumpster fire he had expected; actually, something about talking to Steve in such an intimate setting made Tony miss Steve even more. Yet, as he continued to watch Steve from a distance, he was still confused by Steve’s intentions.
Steve awkwardly hugged and kissed Tony back, but his guilt was crushing his composure. As soon as Tony released himself from the hug, Steve quickly walked over to the table he usually used to store his things. He took his time opening his work bag, finding Howard’s diary sitting on top of his notebooks and writing instruments.
“Sir, Mr. Parker will be arriving in five minutes.” J.A.R.V.I.S. called.
Tony and Peter smiled and high fived each other as the robot moved slowly. However, suddenly, a terrifying noise arose from the robot, causing Peter and Tony to back away further, somewhat panicking from the robot’s startling state.
Tony glared after them
“…my father died when I was a few years old. So, it was just me and my mother for a long time…”
Bucky sighed. “Steve, chill. Why don’t you enjoy this extravagant party?” He waved his hand around affectively.
Tony walked to the side of the cabin where Steve was standing to see two free seats in front of a nicely carved, wooden table. The cabin had its own resort feel to it: a tasteful amount of gold trimming lined the deep mahogany wood paneling lining the interior of the plane. All of the amenities that one could ever possibly need during a longer flight was available at a short grasp.
“That fucking tech conference.” Tony said out loud and really to no one as he proceeded back to the command center.
After talking at dinner, Tony and Steve walked together to the party T’Challa had put on for the wedding guests, not really chatting to one another as both were trying to digest the serious conversation they had at dinner. However, despite this, something about the atmosphere between them had shifted greatly; they barely parted ways as they approached the venue, lingering as if wanting to say or do more.
“Because you
the time.”
Tony laughed. “Did Rogers tell you about the device we’re working on? Obviously, I can’t get into specifics, but your roommate here is quite the tech nerd. Although he doesn’t like to admit it.” Tony motioned toward Steve with his fork.
Tony nodded again as he motioned for everyone to pack up their things. “Okay, Rogers, stand by for the info for the detonator and we’ll get the fuck out of here.”
“How long do we got, doc?” Tony asked, peering down at his wristwatch as the group rushed down a corridor.
“Sharon? Why would Sharon be here?” He took a step toward Tony as he spoked, causing Tony to quickly move to the side.
“All of the husband shit at the event.”
“Please take a seat.”
“Hey, Tony! Are you here?” Tony nearly fell out of the bed at the sound of Steve’s voice.
Tony looked out the window in his office at Stark Industries, telling himself that he needed to do what he should have done a long time ago. His mind whirled before the inevitable knock at his door interrupted his mental entanglement. Tony turned as the door cracked open to reveal Steve.
Tony thought to himself.
Steve blushed as he tried to remember what he wanted to say but something about the way Tony was looking at him in the moment arrested his thinking process.
Steve watched Tony stare at the box for a second or so before slowly opening it. He delicately moved some pieces around before handing the box back to Steve with a smile, although his expression was weary.
Steve groaned loudly as he removed his hands from Tony’s shoulders. The two of them were sitting on Tony’s bed: Tony was on the edge with his legs hanging off the side and Steve was behind him giving him a massage.
“Okay.” Steve answered quietly, smiling meekly back at Tony.
“I’ve just changed my mind about the teams. I want Rogers in your lab.” Fury directed with his voice a little low.
But instead of doing neither, Steve hugged Tony at the waist, tightly.
Tony blinked a few times before shrugging. “Uh, not sure. Figured I’d leave it up to her.”
Pepper frowned. "What happened?"
Tony laughed nervously as he beat himself up on the inside for making such an empty comment.
Tony rolled his eyes as he pushed himself away from the table, approaching Steve. “It’s called style, Rogers. Who doesn’t want to look good while also saving the planet? You and Banner have poor taste.”
“Ooo, the ‘facilities’.” Sam joked. He did a little shimmy as he waved their waitress over.
Steve’s internal clock jerked him awake. He yawned, blinking a few times before looking over at Tony who was practically curled in a ball, dead asleep, and snoring even louder than last night. Steve attempted to readjust his body, but then he realized that Tony was sleeping on top his outstretched arm. He gently pulled himself free, wincing momentarily as Tony let out a huge sigh before turning over on his other side. He promptly went back to snoring.
Steve nodded before pointing behind himself toward the inside of the suite. “Should we keep exploring?”
Gamora shrug. “Maybe…but do we really want to take that chance? It may help father build the weapon he wants.”
Tony closed his eyes tight with another sigh before turning his head somewhat to face Steve who looked quite concerned.
“Dr. Banner, who works here at Stark Industries. One of their best scientists.” Fury pointed to the anxious looking man next to Natasha.
“Okay, so have you ever been fingered before?” He asked.
Tony took another deep breath, thinking he should just turn his phone off for the rest of the night.
Tony waited before tapping on May’s number in Steve’s phone. “I think it’ll be okay to see him here…it’s been a while, hasn’t it?”
All Tony could do physically at this point was stare at Pepper, completely speechless. The words hit him hard, making him feel suddenly sick to the stomach. He would have excused himself if he weren’t afraid of ruining things further with Pepper. They both stared at each other for a moment or two longer as Tony tried to mentally connect the dots.
“…uh…okay…” Tony put down the device. “Is this about the upcoming simulation for the board?”
“So how was your first day?” Clint inquired as Steve took a sip out of his beer. He was standing with Clint and Thor on the opposite end of the cocktail bar from where he could see Tony talking to Bruce at the bar counter.
amazing.” Tony grinned at Steve, reaching out a hand to caress Steve’s side.
Bruce laughed quietly. “I was trying to convey the seriousness of the situation without giving away too much. But like I said, I think it helped.”
Peter jogged toward Steve, carrying a giant bowl covered in saran wrap. Tony caught up with him, taking the bowl so that Peter could greet Steve without losing the dish they brought for dinner.
. Tony thought to himself as he searched the scene.
well, Rogers. On the outside, you ooze innocence, bravery, patriotism, whatever,” Tony was waving one of his arms about as he proceeded to give a physiological run down of Steve, “but…” he then turned around slightly before placing on hand on Steve’s thigh, “on the inside, you’re
Steve nodded. “I think so?” He looked at Tony who had turned around with the plate.
"I really don't know what you have to say to me without Pepper being here, Obie." Tony shot back before returning to his phone.
Steve laughed nervously. “Well we’ll have to keep that to ourselves.”
” Tony reminded himself as he walked into the café, seeing Steve already seated at a table near the back.
Tony shook his head as he picked up his drink. “You’re wrong. She’s
Steve sighed; he wasn’t sure if he should tell Tony that he had read the diary and he was beginning to feel guilty about keeping it instead of throwing it away.
Steve made a small cute-sounding noise as he let Tony pull him even closer for a kiss. Steve relaxed as he kissed Tony back, taking the opportunity to feel Tony’s chest, lingering a bit to rub his nipples, before moving his hands to his backside, sliding his hands under the fabric of Tony’s underwear to touch his skin.
Steve moaned as Tony started sucking on his cock, taking his time at first before moving faster. Steve placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder, trying not to squeeze too tightly. Tony licked up and down before straightening up again. He grinned at Steve, removing the rest of his clothes before helping Steve with his.
“The one that’ll be on Roosevelt Island?” Gamora heard Nebula respond.
“Uh…did you…uh, ever feel…like that, uh, when…you were with me…?” Tony asked quietly.
Happy Belated-Birthday, Tony!
“…did you have a nightmare, Peter?” Tony asked softly.
“You know, Rogers. You know more about me than most of my closest friends…”
“Right away, Sir.” J.A.R.V.I.S. answered as Tony rode the elevator down to the Synergy labs.
government connections. Howard would have killed for such access.” Tony whipped back around to face the console. Steve took a chance, even though it wasn’t the wisest decision he had ever made.
Steve held out his hand toward Tony. “May I see it? I think Sam has the same one.”
Steve smiled. “Same. Thank you for asking me.”
Steve opened the door to his apartment to find Bucky and Sam loudly playing video games in their living room. Steve nodded at them, walking past his boisterous friends to his bedroom. He hadn’t told either of them that he had confessed to Tony that he loved him because Steve had been feeling overwhelmed by the inundation of constant relationship advice.
“Well…hopefully…” Steve kept his eyes on Tony, “I’ll get to do some pre-summer things with the two of you before you head out…”
Steve laughed as they watched the lights on the robot twinkle for a moment. Peter tapped again on the tablet.
“Everyone else,” Tony motioned toward the team on the screen, “I guess I’ll see you at the ceremony tomorrow.”
that, Stark.” He joked which prompted Tony to let out a very awkward-sounding laugh.
“However,” Mr. Beck began, “I’m putting in a request that Peter see the school’s therapist.”
Tony felt Steve’s hand let go of his shoulder. “Okay, I’ll see you later. I’ll let you know when we’re about to leave to visit Clint…” He answered softly.
“Okay, I’m all ears, Tony.” Pepper stepped closer toward Tony, indicating that she was also concerned that they may be overheard.
Tony chuckled as he used his fork to point toward Steve. “Peter, why don’t you tell Steve about your art class?”
Pepper looked at Tony, making it obvious that she could tell he wasn't okay, but Tony shook his head as he tried to focus on the meeting's agenda so he could get out of the room as quickly as possible. Obadiah ignored them as he immediately began discussing some important items.
“Yo, Romanov. Rogers. You wanna grab drinks after work?” Clint had his hands up against his mouth to project his voice. Steve looked over at Natasha who was nodding.
Tony continued to swing his legs back and forth. “I wouldn’t say you were the easiest to read, just that I could probably figure out what you like to do in your free time.”
“Uh, no, not really…” Tony quietly admitted, and thankful that Steve was alone, “I can’t sleep…also Peter’s over at May’s, so I feel like I’m being crushed by utter loneliness…” He laughed, but it hurt.
a millennial? That’s a first.”
“It’s Tony Stark.”
He knew he needed to get over it; he had been through breakups like this before and managed to survive. But now it felt like he would never find anyone. Maybe it would be better to just focus on Peter and work. Dating only brought him heartache. Yet, he couldn’t lose Pepper completely; she was one of his closest friends.
“…but the first person I was ever with…our families were close. It was really fucked up though because he’s an asshole and we never said anything nice to each other…”
Tony immediately interrupted Bruce by holding up one finger as he shouted “Rhodey!” as soon as he heard the lyric “…I shall reveal you” from “Caravan” playing on low volume. Over at the bar, Rhodey turned around from his conversation with Steve to call back.
“That felt so amazing…” Steve finally let out.
Tony squiggled a bit. “Haven’t what, Steve?” He ran a hand through Steve’s hair to indicate that it was fine for him to be open about whatever seemed to be bothering him.
“I need the two of you on the finishing details for that postponed simulation for the board. We’ll also use it as an opportunity to guard the device closely while we track down Loki.”
“Will do. I’ll see you both tonight.” Rhodey stopped short before exiting the office. He put his hand on the door and turned slightly to look back at Tony.
Steve sighed once more as he tapped once on his phone to pull up Tony’s number. He waited for what felt like a century until he finally tapped on the icon next to Tony’s name to call him. It rang twice before a weary sounding Tony answered the phone.
“…Mr. Stane only served as a cog in the wheel. He wanted to take the company away from you, Mr. Stark, and would stop at nothing to do so. Once he handed over the device, I was planning to eliminate him…tying of up loose ends as it were. You know it goes.”
Both men stared at each other, ignoring everyone else around them. After another second, Steve shook his head to snap out of his daze. He pointed back toward his office.
“Enjoying yourself, my young friend?” An empty smile plastered Steve’s face as he turned to face Thor who was beaming at him.
“I know, Banner,” Tony shook his head again, trying to focus, “give me a second.”
Steve laughed, hanging his head before looking back up at Tony. “I actually forgot about the first simulation…we worked so well together after…”
Steve smiled as he pulled Tony even closer to his body. They made out before the elevator doors opened into their suite’s foyer. Steve reached out to hold the door open with one hand while still holding Tony at the waist.
“Shit, Steve…” Tony gasped as he pushed back onto Steve’s fingers.
“So, how about this, eh? Not too bad, right?” Tony held his hands out as they walked into the space.
Tony stared intently at Steve who was now leaning against the counter. “Tony, you not only figured out how to get Synergy to work, so I have no doubt you’ll figure out how to keep the team safe.”
Tony told himself that looking through wayward emails would probably be the best way to take his mind off the upcoming weekend. He faced his desktop as he scrolled through newly received messages before looking through messages he had flagged “important” to read later. After answering one email to a company investor, a new email popped into his inbox; it was addressed from Justin Hammer.
“Thanks for the flight, T’Challa. That was really nice of you.” Sam straightened himself out as soon as T’Challa let go of him.
Steve laughed as he listened to Tony and Peter race each other through the penthouse. After a moment, he exhaled heavily to himself, looking around the bedroom, irritated that he still needed help moving from the bed to the bathroom.
Steve reached out a hand to rub the back of Tony’s neck. “Tony, you’re absolutely amazing…” He whispered.
Tony continued to laugh, never showing any signs of letting up. Steve crossed his arms as he sat up in the bed.
Pepper nodded somewhat. Tony could feel her watching him. However, he looked up to see that she was wearing a caring smile.
Tony slapped his forehead with a groan, nodding as he retrieved his phone from his pants pocket. He had missed several messages since last night, having been so caught up with his emotions and Steve that he forgot to check his phone until that early afternoon.
Steve chuckled as he turned to watch Tony and Peter sprint toward then duck underneath the robot.
Tony chuckled. He ran a hand through his hair a few times before yawning loudly. “Well, don’t run off too quickly. Why don’t you stay for breakfast? I can make you an omelet. Peter’s aunt will probably drop him off around noon.”
“Cap,” Bucky started up again with a muted sigh, “why don’t you just call Tony or text him? Just tell him you fucked up.”
Tony chuckled as he entered the kitchen, walking over to the island to ruffle Peter’s hair before giving Steve a hug.
“Thanks for the invite, Tony.” Steve whispered through the hug.
Peter sighed again as he jerked the car out of the parking spot, which was more than enough space for him to parallel park.
Tony, who was standing next to Bruce and Thor on one side of the conference room, shrugged before answering.
“You wanna try it, Captain Rogers?” Tony asked, smiling widely at Steve.
Steve tilted his chin upward to kiss Tony on the underside of his chin before straightening up. He rubbed Tony’s body before rubbing more lube on his cock, taking the condom to roll down the length of it. Tony whined with pleasure as he watched, anticipating the sensation of feeling Steve inside of him. Steve smiled, as he kissed Tony one last time before gently pushing himself inside. Tony’s body jerked from the reaction, causing Steve to hold onto him tightly with one hand.
“Do you want Steve in your life, Tony?” I think you need to answer that for yourself.”
Steve shook his head. “I did something with Tony…”
Tony slid down to the bathroom floor against the door, holding his head in his hands as soon as he made contact with the floor tiles. He had trouble trying to figure out why it was so difficult for him to say to Steve that he loved him too. He even had been thinking about asking Steve that night if he would like to move in, but now he struggled to think clearly. Tony rubbed both hands through his hair thinking back to what Obadiah said about their relationship.
night with your ex and his kid when you
troubled at the same time?” Tony asked rhetorically before returning to the photos. Pepper groaned as she watched him.
“No, he doesn’t talk about it because he’s taking himself too seriously. Although you refuse to get a smartphone, I’m not surprise you’re already a star player, Cap.”
“…and don’t get upset, but I mentioned to Steve this morning that you may be a little stressed at the moment…”
Steve nodded before a few minutes of awkward silence fell between them. Tony told himself to just get it over with. He reached out for Steve’s hand, holding it tightly. There was no way to ease the pain he felt and the pain he would undoubtedly inflict upon someone he truly cared for, but knew there was no future with.
Steve craned his neck to look out through the open bedroom door to ensure that Tony was out of sight. He then flung the covers off his body, taking his time turning himself so that his legs could hang off the edge of the bed. Steve glanced at the door once more before steadying himself, wincing as he anticipated the inevitable onslaught of pain.
Tony looked confused as he answered. “Steve, you don’t have to do that…” He let Steve continue rubbing his arm.
. That doesn’t even come close to what I’ve said to you.” He looked upward at Steve with a genuine smile.
Tony clapped his hands as he motioned for Steve to avoid an incoming projection of the Synergy device so it could display its vibranium core once more. Steve nearly hopped out of the away, realizing that he almost missed his cue. As he turned somewhat to face the crowd, the holographic image of the device began generating specs for various items to be replicated.
Peter laughed, rolling his eyes as he rifled through his backpack until he produced something square and poorly covered with Christmas wrapping paper. Steve made a sentimental face of appreciation as Tony grinned from how goofy the wrapped gift looked.
Tony nodded. “He’s fine. And it’s not Synergy-related either.” He quickly added. That seemed to convey to Steve that Tony didn’t want to address the issue any further.
Mr. Beck nodded. “Everyone can benefit from a little therapy.” He smiled back at Steve and Tony, but of course that made Tony feel even less reassured.
Bruce scoffed. “Okay, Tony. You were all…,” he hiccupped, “…weird and awkward around Steve the first couple weeks.”
“I’m using Steve’s phone.”
Steve made a cute whiny noise as he let Tony hold onto him, turning his head to a degree to kiss Tony who was in the process of nestling his nose against his ear. Tony turned some more, ending with half his body on top of Steve. He breathed deeply before pressing his lips against Steve’s again, moaning quietly as he pushed downward into Steve, but not too much.
“Tell me which shirt I should wear.” Tony grinned as he held up two different shirts for Peter to look at.
Tony rolled his eyes again. “They’re super close…I don’t know…Steve could have anyone. I wouldn’t be shocked if they used to date or at least messed around in the past…”
Tony slowly looked up in Steve’s direction, a little unsettled by Steve using “we” as if they were still a team.
you were into anal, Captain Rogers.” Tony winked at Steve and Steve winced again, thinking back to when Bucky poked fun at him at the pharmacy.
Tony turned around to look at Steve; he looked to be mentally processing the situation before answering, taking a moment before addressing Steve again.
Steve smiled as he finally let go of Tony. “Of course, Tony.”
. Tony felt like leaving. What was the use? Steve seemed willing then would always pull back. Maybe he shouldn’t have touched him, but it felt like he could. Tony beat himself up over reading too much into things then sighed thinking that he definitely blew his chance with Steve.
“That design expo…” Thanos started.
“May I sit next to you?” He asked, pointing to the chaise lounge Tony was sitting on.
Tony managed to convince Fury and the team to keep the new revelations concerning Loki to themselves which included excluding the full executive committee. Tony hated keeping Pepper in the dark, considering everything she had done for him up until that point, but he was afraid that the information might leak to Obadiah who would then use it to his advantage.
Since the last few weeks or so, Steve had graciously listened to Tony complain about having to host this event. He tried to be as supportive as possible and even offered to help prepare for it.
tell me you were seeing someone else, you didn’t even tell her that you and I used to date, Steve!” He motioned back and forth between himself and Steve.
Steve shrugged as he groaned. He never understood why everyone else he knew was so casual when it came to joking about sex.
Soon after, the three of them walked together to one of the docks where T’Challa kept one of his private yachts. They found Sam and T’Challa with a couple bodyguards, already on the yacht chatting.
one? Maybe…actually…”
Another pause. “…uh, okay…that’s really nice of you considering…but uh…” Tony’s voice trailed off.
Tony barely looked at him before looking around hurriedly, but Steve hugged him tighter. The four of them chatted for a bit before Steve and Tony were left alone.
Fury rose the table. “We need to prep a bit for the board meeting. Stane?” He motioned for Obadiah to follow him out of the room, and Fury winked at Tony as they exited.
He watched Steve hesitate before answering. Steve looked away from Tony, dreading his reaction.
Tony shook his head back, reaching out to take a hold of Steve's hand. "Steve, it's okay, really…uh—"
Steve closed his eyes as he neared the edge, letting out a gasp as he came into Tony’s mouth. Tony waited before straightening up, lying down on top of Steve before rubbing himself against Steve’s body. Steve pushed upward into Tony, gripping his body as tight as he could without hurting him. Tony kissed Steve on the cheek as he came, groaning loudly as he placed both hands on either side of Steve.
“You’re so amazing, Tony…” Steve whispered, hugging Tony against his body.
Tony beamed as he handed Steve his phone.
“Too bad Tony’s out of practice though. He’ll probably mess everything up.”
Bucky chuckled, but his tone sounded sympathetic. “Okay, then what’s with all of the updates I’ve been getting from Sam?” He turned slightly to face Steve.
Peter giggled. “I don’t know! You figure it out.” He answered, stumbling over the word “figure”.
Tony motioned toward Thor. “Whatever the fuck it is, we need to get in. What do you know, Thor?”
“And I wish I were more like you when I was your age. Probably would have saved me a lot of heartache.” Tony laughed, mostly to himself, even though it wasn’t funny. He concealed how he was feeling by drinking out of his water glass.
“Um, yeah…I just,” Tony took a moment before continuing, “I’ve been getting this weird feeling in my chest lately…I’m planning to see Strange about it Wednesday morning.”
“…this Thanos and whatever the hell he’s building is putting the proverbial damper on Synergy.” Fury added as the team watched the footage that had been projected above the table.
Tony was out on the balcony of his penthouse with Bruce. Peter was staying over at May’s for the weekend and Tony needed someone to distract him from not obsessing over Steve. Neither one had made a move to reach out to the other since the blow up in the conference room.
“I don’t think we can apologize enough for what happened,” Steve quickly dashed Tony’s daydreaming, “but Tony, we could probably do something for the school.” Steve looked at Tony before nodding in the direction of the principal. Tony looked back and forth between Steve and the principal, but he wasn’t entirely sure what Steve was getting at.
“For some reason, I
As it became clear that the conversation had reached a logical conclusion, everyone began to murmur to one another. Tony, still standing, looked downward at Steve before sighing heavily to himself. He glanced around the room once more before rushing out of the conference room without speaking another word.
After a few minutes, the elevator chimed with arrival, causing Tony to yelp again. He then commanded himself to chill out, running a hand through his hair a few times before standing right in front of the elevator. The doors opened, revealing Steve who was smiling, but Tony could tell that he was also nervous.
“—I know you’re just being nice.” But Bruce had barely missed a beat from Tony and Rhodey’s sing-along.
“…but I’m glad we did meet…you’re down to earth and the most intelligent person I know…”
Tony stopped next to the bed, leaning on one leg. “Uh, you can change your mind if you want…I won’t be offended…” He offered meekly.
Sam laughed loudly at Steve’s expense, but Bucky only smiled a little, as if he were unimpressed.
The group chatted for another hour before Steve excused himself to find Tony. He spotted him over by the temporary bar talking to the man who was with Bruce and Pepper earlier. Steve smiled as he approached, taking note that Tony had noticed him making his way over.
“Well, I can see I’m not appreciated.” He responded, but Natasha only laughed at his expense.
Sam smiled. Steve could tell that he was trying his best not to give him a hard time considering how upset he was.
And as soon as Rhodey finished his statement, Tony rose quickly out of his chair, marching out the conference room. Everyone else, too stunned by the situation, tried to ignore it as Obadiah only shook his head.
Steve, baffled by Loki’s strange demeanor, waited for him to reenter his lab before walking past to head toward his own. He remembered that Tony had told him not to worry about Loki, but he knew he needed to keep an eye on him in the future.
“I’m sorry he didn’t even say anything to you. I know he’s going through a lot, but he should have said something at least.” Bruce walked toward Steve before stopping short.
“Uh, you can also stay over…if you want…no pressure…” Tony added quietly, trying to sound jovial, yet he was annoyed with himself because he had been repeating the same line for several days now.
“…I had a meeting with him this past Friday in his office. He left for a second to place a phone call, so I…ended up looking through some of the files on his desk…” She sounded so embarrassed.
Steve smiled back as best as he good, laughing a bit before continuing. “Uh…no longer can we rely on traditional methods to protect and sustain ourselves and our fellow people…this calls for alternative means…” He managed to vocalize.
“Stop stalling!” He now had his hands cupped around his mouth to project his voice, “Sam said we gotta get ready to go!”
Tony then told himself to focus on Steve.
Steve smiled as he followed him, waiting for Tony to gather whatever he had been working on in the office before following him to the bedroom.
“Hi, Tony.” Steve responded, his voice lowering as he let Tony linger.
you want…” Tony moved his head so that he could whisper into Steve’s ear who was, at this point, completely speechless.
“Peter? Are you okay?” Steve could tell that Tony was trying to remain as calm as possible.
Steve rolled his eyes. “Tony, that’s not funny. This thing looks dangerous.”
Steve bucked upward into Tony once more before he felt himself let go, quietly swearing to himself. Tony kept one hand on Steve’s chest as he kept moaning, trying not to laugh from Steve swearing again, his body eventually slowing down before lying on top of Steve. Steve wrapped both arms around Tony, holding him as he also came.
“…is that why…Steve doesn’t spend the night anymore…?”
“…so it’ll just be me and Bucky then. We figured it would probably be best to have Bucky move into the apartment out in Brooklyn instead of finding a new place…”
“Come in!” Tony shouted as he shuffled some papers around on his desk.
Bruce chuckled before he proceeded. “No, I’m serious, Tony. You work well with people who don’t take your shit and well, Steve seems to be your best match.”
“I’m going to stay late and try out somethings…then probably help Shuri and Banner…” Tony said quietly.
“Is this because of Synergy? Tony, you don’t have to do this. I’m disappointed that the government didn’t pick up the program, but that doesn’t matter—”
Whoberis nodded, stepping in front of Lupho; the move appeared to irritate the latter.
Tony was at his boiling point; he knew the meeting would be a waste of time. As soon as he heard about the leak, Tony knew Synergy was finished.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., before I forget, please set up a meeting with Riri to discuss what we’ll end up sending to the film makers for my dad’s doc.”
“Three hours and forty minutes until landing, Sir.” J.A.R.V.I.S. responded.
Tony nodded, staying near the door before taking his time to walk back to the bed. Steve watched him the entire time over. Tony stopped short as Steve looked up at him, reaching out for him as he finally met the bed.
Loki looked upward at Tony as he took his time answering. “
“Rogers, is it fair for me to assume that you’re lame as well?” He sneered at Steve before turning to pour two shots.
As the elevator doors opened into the penthouse, Tony quickly exited the elevator car to shed his jacket before walking briskly to the master bedroom.
One last 😏
“We’re not friends, or even beyond that,” Steve angrily cut Tony off, “we’re barely work colleagues, okay? I’m here because of the team and Synergy,
He stared up at the ceiling, now thinking about the time he and Steve went out to Malibu. He laughed as soon as he remembered how terrified Steve was to use the facial alteration device.
“I’ve never slept with Bucky, okay?” Steve shook his head a few times, confused by the argument they were having, “I don’t know why you’re so upset about something that never and won’t happen.”
“Right away, sir.” J.A.R.V.I.S. answered promptly.
He took a moment to see where Steve had gone off to, seeing Steve standing next to Bucky on the other end of the near empty space. Steve was in the middle of a huddle flanked by Bucky and Sam’s in-laws. Tony waved at him and Steve waved back before turning to listen to Bucky. Tony then shifted in his chair to watch the firework show from afar.
Steve repeated to himself as he walked Tony out of the apartment building.
“Steve, wait a sec,” Tony grabbed Steve’s arm before he could get further down the hallway, “I have to tell you something…”
“Talk to him. I just pay for everything.”
“Thanks, Tony.” Steve handed Tony his jacket as he walked ahead of him a bit.
Tony watched Obadiah saunter away. He swore to himself before turning around to head to one of the smaller conference rooms were Fury had called the Synergy team for their meeting.
Bruce looked at Tony before slowly nodding. “I’ll just be on the balcony.”
Tony leaned into Steve’s embrace, but he looked away from him so he could stop himself from rolling his eyes, trying to find another excuse not to attend the event. Yet, Tony knew he couldn’t let his team down, even in the worst moments. The team had put so much work into the project that it would be more of a blow to morale if Tony opted out of the event than selling Synergy to a weapons contractor.
“He’s lying.” Nebula seethed, “let’s get rid of him now.”
Tony could sense that Steve was waiting to respond. “That’s understandable, Tony. It’s normal to regret something like that especially when it’s connected to a traumatic event…” Steve finally contributed.
Peter’s eyes grew big as he bounced in his chair. “Okay!”
“Specs coming your way, Banner.” Tony spoke into his earpiece as soon as the device stopped glowing and generating.
Steve nodded meekly as he did what he was told. He felt Tony rub his shoulders with both hands before one hand travelled down his body, taking its time before Steve felt Tony gently squeeze his ass.
Also, R.I.P. King T’Challa 😢 Wakanda Forever.
Steve chuckled as he inched up the bed. “Yeah, but it’s still early.”
Steve thought back to his conversation with Bucky again.
Tony winced as he fumbled, trying to fish his phone out of his pocket to see that Rhodey was calling him. He glanced shyly over at Steve before sprinting out of the lab to answer the call.
the prominent clients in this business.”
“Indeed, Rogers.” Tony clasped his shoulder again as he too gazed at the device.
As the record spun around, Tony stood next to the player, tapping on it a few times with one finger, appearing to be thinking deeply. Steve continued to watch him before rising from the floor. He walked over to Tony, placing both hands on his waist.
Steve grinned back; he knew Tony was joking but something about the offer was obviously appealing. However, he was afraid of misreading the proposal as sincere when it was obvious, well to him anyway, that Tony had to be teasing him.
“Okay, we’re sending the first set to you now, Stark.” Natasha called in Tony and Steve’s earpieces.
Tony effortlessly whisked the sheets of paper away from Steve so he could continue reading the instructions.
Steve nodded back slowly as he then followed Bucky back into the elevator, riding it back up to Bucky and Sam’s suite.
Steve nodded as he sat down in his chair before explaining to Tony what happened at Roosevelt Island.
As he met Tony at the door, Steve watched Tony press an ear against the wood, listening. Steve inched closer, hearing muffled crying through the door. Both Steve and Tony glanced at each other; Tony shook his head with a sigh as he slowly opened the door, finding Peter sitting up in his bed crying.
“Well, maybe once…”
Okay! 😊
Peter jumped off the bed. “Okay!” He then sprinted out of the room.
“Giving
Tony scrunched up his face. “She’s my research assistant, Rogers. Besides, I know she would tell me if I were exploiting her in anyway.”
Tony nodded wearingly. “I’m okay. Did you see anyone drop off some mail? I got this letter in my private mailbox.”
Steve laughed. “I would be honored to be in your comic, Peter.”
Obadiah nodded as he walked inside, too anxious and jumbled to remark that the conference room didn’t have the same amenities he typically enjoyed at one of these events.
“So, what did you want to talk to me about?” She asked, folding her hands on top of the table.
Steve heard Tony chuckle. “Just a Rather Very Intelligent System, or J.A.RV.I.S. He’s my computer system.”
chance. After that, you’re done. Understood?”
As soon as he reached the lab, Loki looked around and through the glass façade; he could see the Synergy device sitting on top a console.
Steve took his time answering. “I know that I don’t have experience when it comes to relationships…but why would I be weird about you seeing Pepper when you see me almost every night?” His expression softened, just enough to ease Tony.
“…uh, become…a different…person.” Tony finally finished which prompted everyone including Steve to clap after the presentation.
Fury nodded, uncrossing his arms to rest them on a chair back in front of him. “I agreed, Stark. How long do you think it’ll take before we can use the device again?”
Riri turned the chip around and around in the palm of her hand. “Uh, it’s like a key, isn’t it?” She looked up at Tony, inquisitively.
“Uh, it’s not Mr. Barnes, Mr. Rogers…” Steve’s assistant entered the office, slowly closing the door behind her. She looked to be on the verge of trying to contain unbridled excitement.
“Hey, uh, Peter’s still here if you would like to say goodnight, Rogers…he’s inside with May, probably in my office…”
“Uh, would have been better if you had stayed for breakfast.” Tony tried for as facetiously as possible without grilling Steve.
“Don’t worry about it.” Loki responded.
Tony shrugged. “It’s mostly him, but thanks.” He answered as coolly as possible.
He smiled as he reached out a hand to caress Tony’s neck. “I don’t like talking about past relationships, or lack thereof…” he laughed quietly which seemed to ease the atmosphere between the two.
Steve watched Bucky take a swig of his beer as his friend lightly grilled him about any possible detail related to Project Synergy.
“I couldn’t sleep, so I thought maybe I would look through some of the legal documents in the lab before you arrived.” Steve avoided eye contact with Tony as he walked into the lab. He hesitated before going any further near where Tony had put out the fires. He had been in dangerous situations before, but he had hoped to avoid accidents on his first working day at Stark Industries.
“Ugh, I really shouldn’t get into the middle of it.” Sam looked around before returning to directly face Tony.
Steve laughed as he watched Tony walk into the bathroom. He tried sitting up again, but then fell back down on the bed, groaning loudly from the pain shooting up his body.
Bucky and Steve were standing out on the balcony attached to Steve and Sam’s apartment. The space was more of a little extension, part of an old fire escape, but Steve and Sam often hung out on the extension on warmer days during the year.
“I’m going to find Loki!” Thor was almost halfway down the corridor.
“Like a merry motley crew. Why did I agree to do this again?” Tony tossed one of the files across the desk toward Rhodey who caught it before it slipped off the edge.
The comment incensed Tony who then immediately scrunched up his face in irritation. “Bucky, I’m just here to talk.”
“…I…” Tony looked down at the floor before looking up at Steve, inhaling and exhaling deeply.
“Sir, it appears that the email is free of any potential viruses.” J.A.R.V.I.S. quickly answered.
Tony rolled his eyes, but Bruce continued. “If for some strange reason Steve turns you down, I’ll cancel on my colleague, okay?”
“But you really need to take more breaks more often. That’s the best evidence I can give you and your stress levels.” He waved bye to Tony before exiting the office.
Steve didn’t respond as he continued out of the basement. Tony turned around to face the device.
Steve smiled slightly. “Yeah, I’m sorry, Sam.”
“Uh, why?” He finally responded.
Bucky was smirking at Sam as he drank out of his beer glass. He was standing near Steve who was standing close to Tony at the bar counter. Sam flanked the end facing the rest of the group. Tony perked up as he looked over at Sam who went completely silent.
Steve looked around hurriedly before spotting Rhodey chatting with Fury and his wife.
Fury turned to point a clicker he was now holding to project an image of the explosive the team had first encountered at Police Precinct 16. The team either gathered around the projection or stood up from the table to get a better view.
“Another alternative universe has a positive outcome. Earth-0943.”
Steve remained calm as he checked Tony’s pulse, relieved that he was still breathing. Steve then hoisted Tony’s body over his shoulder before running out of what was left of the conference room. He ran down half exposed hallways, running past the remains of the tech expo’s main event space, seeing flames and smoke everywhere. Steve hurriedly looked around for an escape, dodging pieces of the building as it came crashing down. He knew he needed to get to the side of the building facing the water so that the team could see them from the helicopter.
As they followed the group of doctors inside the building, both Steve and Tony simultaneously glanced at each other; Tony grinned, and Steve smiled. Reality quickly interrupted the brief moment between the two as soon as they realized they needed to catch up with the doctors who had already disappeared into the building.
“Tony, for the hundredth time, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with you.”
“Was I though? Next time, I’ll listen, okay? I need to earn your trust back, Tony.” Steve answered sternly.
“Night, Tony.” Steve sighed before trying to relax so he could fall asleep.
Tony considered it before shaking his head quickly. “No, it’s okay. Remember, nothing out of the ordinary.” He cracked a worried smile that fell flat with Steve.
“Did you get any more details from the file?”
Steve nodded as he leaned to the side to kiss Tony. “Yeah, I agree with that.”
Without really thinking, Tony clicked on Pepper’s name to call her. It rang a couple times before she answered.
Steve laughed, repositioning himself directly on top of Tony again. “So are you…” he whispered, kissing Tony’s neck before moving to his lips.
And stayed tuned for the next two installments to Earth-0943!
(See the end of the chapter for
Clint was standing at the entrance to Tony and Steve’s lab, fumbling around for a piece of paper he had shoved in his pocket that had the access code scribbled on it.
Tony nodded wearily. Mr. Beck smiled before scratching his chin thoughtfully.
He felt like leaving the party all together. If Obadiah thought they were sleeping together, did everyone else think so, too? Was their relationship too close? Steve hadn’t thought so. Well, okay, he often easily found himself returning Tony’s flirtation, especially of late. Also, Steve had been texting Tony more lately, but it wasn’t like anyone else knew about it. Besides, Tony was flirty with everyone. Wasn’t he?
After their call from the west coast, both Tony and Pepper were sitting in the former’s office, going through some tedious company items before they heard a knock at the door. Both glanced at the other quickly, but before Tony could answer, Natasha peeked in.
Tony turned around to perch himself against a counter facing the island and Steve, taking another moment; he knew he needed to stop stalling and get to the point.
“…fuck, Steve…” Tony gasped, breaking away slightly from Steve’s lips as he dropped his hand on Steve’s face to his neck, now rubbing as he squeezed. Steve’s breathing grew harsher as his thrusts against Tony’s cock turned sharper and quicker. Tony smacked Steve’s ass, managing to stick a hand down Steve’s pants as he sped up his motions.
Thanos grinned, slowly turning his head to look at Obadiah. “Good. Everything is finally going according to plan.”
Tony sat up bit before answering. “The time in car—,” his eyes widened as it became clear that he had realized what Steve was referring to.
Tony nodded as his expression changed. “Steve…I’m really sorry…I…”
Tony thought, but he couldn’t even say out loud or even silently mouth. He shook his head, feeling his chest restrict with pain so much to the point that Tony thought he was about to have a heart attack. Tony clenched his chest before slumping to the floor again, trying to convince himself that he could be vulnerable with Steve.
He covered his mouth with one hand. “I’m so sorry, Tony. I can’t believe I assault—”
Tony knitted his brow with irritation, but he didn’t pull away from Steve. “I’m your ‘friend’? Okay.”
“Uh, Steve…cares about you too, Tony…er, I mean, he told me.” Bucky offered.
really worked…I was a kid then…”
Obadiah whined to himself.
“…you want me to come from just rubbing your ass?” Tony asked; his voice grew quieter and deeper.
“Steve, listen…” Tony interjected as he uncrossed his legs to lean forward in his chair, “Synergy needs you for this to work. The team needs you…I need you…” Tony was staring intently at Steve much like he had the first day the team had gathered for orientation at Stark Industries.
“Then Thanos will find a way to get it.” Tony finished the thought for Shuri with his back still facing them.
He didn’t have to be present during the conversation at the event to know Obadiah was trying to use Steve against him. That part should have been the most upsetting revelation. But something about Steve practically losing his shit over the idea they would end up in bed together bothered Tony to no end. He had been completely fixated on it since that morning and could barely focus on anything else.
Tony carefully nestled himself on the bed next to Steve as he whipped out a few sheets of paper containing Steve’s updated recovery plan.
Tony sighed as he straightened up to cross his arms. “Loki, I don’t have time for the melodramatics. We know you had something to do with Selvig damaging the device; we know you doctored the security tapes;
“Tony...” Steve whispered, almost like he had upon waking up mere minutes ago. The thought made him feel so stupid.
“Okay, okay,” Tony started with a coy expression, “I think the most important question that’s weighing on everyone’s mind now is…” he pointed in the direction of Steve’s backside, “how long do I have to wait to tap
Strange pointed to a few items. “As you can see, we’re running low on supplies.” He then called for an intern and a nurse before studying some information on a tablet.
Steve couldn’t help himself as he smiled back down at Peter. He shook his head a few times before wagging a finger at Tony.
“I really thought you would have to negotiate. She could really work anywhere she wanted.” Bruce said almost immediately as Shuri disappeared out of sight down the hallway.
to know.”
He waited anxiously for the elevator to arrive, now fidgeting with various items that decorated the space in front of the elevator entrance.
The thought had come so easily to him, but he wasn’t entirely sure where it originated. Okay, so he and Tony would spend the night together and sometimes get dinner, but besides work, the two would only see each other a couple nights a week, if that. Would Tony even want to spend more personal time with him? Especially since the talk Tony had given Steve about needing to be more responsible? Steve hadn’t even met Peter yet, which had been bothering him a great deal lately, so why would Tony even want to go on a ride with him?
Steve, as he continued to kiss Tony, ran a hand down the length of his body, stopping short before he reached Tony’s cock. Steve buried his face into Tony’s neck as he began to feel around, taking his time before rubbing and squeezing Tony as he held on to him with his other hand.
“Oh! It’s a long one this time.” Sam teased back.
“…uh, is it okay if…we don’t talk about this the rest of the night?” Tony whispered through his agony, attempting to sound breezy, but of course he sounded more hurt than anything else.
Bruce sighed. “Everyone messes up, Tony…maybe Steve thought he was helping somehow.”
Tony laughed quietly. He looked downward before responding to Steve. “One of my meetings got canceled at the last minute,” Tony peeked upward at Steve through his eyelashes, “so you’re stuck with me the rest of the day, unfortunately. Sorry.”
Tony turned to rise from the bed, but Steve managed to take a hold of his arm before he walked away.
Obadiah, appearing a little taken aback, adjusted his jacket again, but he kept his hand on the microphone, grinning.
“…Tony?” Steve’s calm voice broke through Tony’s mental dilemma.
Tony sneered. “You fit the profile
Tony groaned. “Fine, whatever.”
“Shit.” Tony wasted little time as he propelled himself away from Steve and out of the bed, trying to put his pajama pants back on before jogging out of the bedroom.
Bruce shook his head again, reaching out to get Tony to calm down before he said something he would regret. Steve looked back and forth between them, alarmed by Tony’s tone and Bruce’s demeanor.
“Bruce…” Shuri whispered, looking in the direction of the niche in the counter Obadiah had hidden the weapon the day before, “it’s over in that counter…”
Steve walked back into the bedroom as Tony kept searching around. “Uh, Rogers…” he called for Steve as he walked into the bedroom, “…I think there’s only one bedroom…”
“You can sleep with me, if it’ll help, Tony."
He was just sending a message to his lab mate, not courting a potential date, or laying down the law. Would Steve even receive his message? Tony wished he had gotten a look at his lab mate’s phone.
“You’re breaking hearts all over the world anytime someone pays you a compliment, Rogers.” He continued to smile as he joined Thor and Bruce out in the hallway.
Tony frowned as he glanced downward at Steve who was at this point nestled near his shoulder.
Everyone in the conference room “ooed” and “awed” as an exploded holographic image of the Synergy device rotated above the table. Tony was standing in the front with Fury, waving his hand about as he explained the team’s latest work to the Stark Industries board, Pepper, and Obadiah. He could see Obadiah watching him intently down at the opposite end of the table, but it didn’t bother him like usual; he knew Obadiah was waiting to interject to poke holes in their research.
Both ends of the connections went quiet before Tony thought of something to say. “You know, this is one of our usual sleepover nights…do you think it’s too late for you to come over…?
handled.” Thanos grinned slightly, emphasizing the word “handled” for effect. The grin was marred by a wicked scar on his chin. Obadiah flashed back the most PR looking smile he could muster, without cringing.
Steve nodded again as he settled on the opposite of the island. “…so, I think…” he started, looking down at his plate before looking up at Tony, “…I think I'm going to go back home…I think I might have overstayed my welcome…"
now.”
Rhodey nodded back before closing the door. Tony sat up in his chair with his elbow rested on the desk, chin perched on top, pouting again. He pulled out his phone, tapped and swiped a few times until he found the photo he had taken of himself and Steve at the graduation, staring at it longingly for the hundredth time. He sighed heavily.
“Uh, thanks, Rogers…” Tony said quietly. Steve smiled back at him but noticed that Tony was shuffling around, trying not to look directly at him.
“Making pizza? By hand? Sounds like work.”
“Make sure you use your mirror, Peter.” Steve added.
Tony had a few prototype phones in the works that he would occasionally alternate with the newest Stark phone as his personal phone to test for possible upgrades. His current model was the Stark X, a great phone with an awesome camera, yet equipped with a shitty battery life.
“That’s quite the statement, Colonel. If that’s the case, then no need to worry.” Obadiah grinned once more before clapping his hands together.
“Peter, why don’t you tell Tony what you learned today?” Steve asked Peter who had taken a break from his story to eat his food.
Tony inhaled and then exhaled deeply as he sat down next to Steve’s bed. He set his work bag down on the ground before taking Steve’s hand.
As Tony approached the lab, he saw Steve working at one of the consoles. He took a deep breath before entering the lab.
Rhodey nodded with a yawn. “It was a little tiring. I almost missed my flight in from D.C., but Pepper and I managed to get in with some time to spare.”
The comment made Steve’s face flush even more. Tony laughed as he patted him on the arm before turning around to look at projection of the uniform.
“Then don’t.” But before one of the scientists could finish his statement, Thanos had spun around to glare at him.
“Okay, I think we’re going to have to keep a look out on Thor. He’ll try to go rogue on this with Loki, especially considering he hasn’t heard from him since his arrest.”
“Yep! Actually, I just remembered that I left something with Bucky and Sam! I’ll be right back!” Steve pressed the button to the lobby multiple times through a surge of terror before the doors finally opened.
“Will you be here later, Steve?” Peter looked at Steve, as he shoveled a ton of scrambled eggs into his mouth.
“It’s not it, Banner. We can still reinvent Synergy; it just can’t exist in its current form now that someone out there knows its mechanics.”
“Oh, hey, Steve!” Bruce waved at Steve before turning to listen to Tony.
Obadiah nodded, but he was annoyed on the inside as he thought back to the last board presentation when the team simulated the highway car crash. His contact in the labs had managed to tamper with the device off hours, which is the real reason why the device was shaking uncontrollably while Steve was inputting figures. Obadiah had expected the mistake to reflect poorly on Tony, but that meddling Steve Rogers had managed to salvage the calculations somehow.
Tony smiled back, nearly blushing from how close Steve was, as he considered the idea. “Okay, thanks, Cap. That’s really helpful.” The grateful sounding tone in Tony’s voice made Steve chuckle.
The woman looked back and forth between Steve and Thor before moving to the side to let them through the hallway. Thor walked ahead as Steve remarked to himself how conceited the atmosphere of the place already appeared. However, Thor remained unbothered; Steve could tell that he was hellbent on finding his brother.
He moaned even louder as he felt Steve through the fabric of their clothes. Tony unzipped Steve’s jeans, feeling Steve through his boxers before pulling his cock out. He kissed Steve one more time before leaning downward to meet the tip of his cock, rubbing it with his thumb before using his mouth.
Tony then wrapped a hand around Steve’s shoulders before making a move to lead him away from Thor and Loki. Steve sighed to himself with relief; he had become uncomfortable around Loki, trying to figure out where he might have seen him before.
Bucky shrugged with a conniving grin, while holding a cup of coffee. “I’m going stag, per usual.”
“…how bad is it?” Steve asked cautiously.
Steve laughed quietly before taking his time turning around to exit the office. He lingered a bit before closing the door. Tony let out another groan as soon as he was left alone, clenching his chest, trying to tell himself to be calm.
He swiveled back and forth in his chair. It was strange to think that Steve possibly “liked” him, but what did that even mean? Bruce wasn’t clear…or maybe he was. Was this a sly attempt on behalf of a friend to tell him to go for it? Bruce did comment on Tony possibly getting or asking for a date in the future with Steve, but maybe he was also teasing him. Tony couldn’t be so sure. He probably meant that Steve liked him enough to tolerate his antics, but then again, that could also be the way the rest of the team treated him.
“I gotta catch a flight, but are you good, Tone?” He offered before leaving.
Bruce looked at Tony then down at his lightly soaked shirt then back up at Tony. “Just go over there. Jesus.” He sighed before stalking over to opposite end of the counter to where Fury and Natasha were chatting.
“…I don’t know, but I think the reason why Loki left has something to do with Dr. Selvig.”
Steve winced at Bucky; he was sure he looked dumfounded.
“…the first time I ever did this…” Tony began, “…the person I was with hurt me and I don’t ever want to do that to you, Steve.”
Steve cleared his throat again. “Rogers.”
Steve forced himself to smile back, although it was becoming difficult to do so considering whatever was going on between the two of them. He took his time reentering the room, walking over to the side of the bed he was sleeping on before waking up and climbed in. Tony slid in right after him, hugging the edge. Neither said a word to the other the rest of the night.
“You should just do that now, Banner.” Tony leaned back into his chair with a huff.
“W-Where’s Tony?” Steve could hardly process what was going on.
But before Tony could figure out how to explain himself, Steve gave him an out as he wrapped his hands around Tony’s.
“Hey, Banner?” Bruce stopped to turn around to face Tony.
Mr. Beck smiled slightly before leaning back in his chair, swiveling back and forth. “No worries, Mr. Stark. We can wait a bit.”
“Well, thanks again for inviting me.” Tony answered.
“You know, that makes the most sense. I don’t know why I didn’t see it before…” Bruce removed his eyeglasses to peer downward at the device, transfixed by Shuri’s solution.
Steve punched in the last figure. He looked at his watch; his timing was getting better with each practice run. He walked away from the Synergy device while looking down at the tablet he was holding. He had managed to figure out and memorize all of the possible figures and functions that could ever be entered into the device. It had only taken him about a week or so to be super quick about it, but he was finally willing to give himself some praise.
Tony laughed as he helped Steve tug his pants off. “Oh my god, how are you this sexy trying to undress?” He teased.
Tony waited a moment before responding; this could either go extremely well or devastatingly spoil the night. He then transferred his energy into his sexiest bedroom self.
“Hey, Tony. T’Challa’s taking us out on his yacht.”
