. What does that mean? Tony tries it out on his tongue. ‘Pretty. Pretty?’ He looks back at Steve, his head cocked to one side in question.
, and the voice is just a thread, she can ignore it, and she finds her eyes drifting closed as she rests her head in her hands, propped on the table.
When they walk over to the picnic blanket, Steve keeps a firm grip on Tony’s hand. Clint and Natasha and Jane are there, munching, and they look up and grin and wave. Even Clint gives a small smile, and Tasha tells Tony, through a mouthful, that his flower crown looks nice. Tony grins back, pleased. ‘I can show you how,’ he offers, and Tasha nods.
When Tony comes down, she’s tucked into the hollow of Steve’s neck, warm and safe, her body and mind drifting on an ocean of warm hazy contentment. She loves Steve, she
Mr Karolidis nods, eyes bright. ‘Very nice girl! Lauren, that’s her name. They’re gonna get married, two years, three? I said to Natalia, I’ll walk you down the aisle. Her good-for-nothing father, he won’t do it, but I’m her pappouli. I’ll walk my granddaughter down the aisle. Me and the cats.’
The lovely
one, and he likes it better than all of them. It fits into the palm of his hand, and it’s small, like him. Tony can’t stop smiling and smiling, and he says thank you three times, and Phil smiles back at him with crinkles around his eyes and helps him wrap it in a serviette to take home.
embarrassing, and she ought to just put her head up and smile and say she’s fine, nothing to worry about, just resting. Except when she puts her head up and tries to grin like usual, it goes all wobbly, and she
Tony looks shyly up at her, and she’s smiling, looking lovely and soft and kind. ‘Happy birthday, sweetheart,’ she says gently, and puts her hand on his shoulder with a little squeeze. Tony basks in it, leaning happily into the touch, and her face goes even softer.
Tony lifts her face swiftly. ‘Greengreen

‘I… wow,’ Tony stutters.
Steve kisses her cheek softly, smiling. ‘You really are a sweetheart, aren’t you?’ she murmurs. She flicks the shower head with her thumb, and Tony lets out a sharp whimper and bucks her hips, because the spray has gone light and tickly again, and Steve’s other hand is coming round again to gently part Tony’s folds so that the spray can tickle her in all the most secret soft delicate places.
Tony’s whining, her knees giving out, but Steve rises back to her feet and catches her, making little hushing sounds. ‘It’s okay,’ she murmurs, ‘it’s okay, darling. Just one more thing, then we’ll button you up again, all safe.’ She strokes the nape of Tony’s neck with her fingertips, slow and deliciously soothing, and Tony turns her face and snuggles it into the swell of Steve’s warm naked breast, the nub of Steve’s nipple trailing across her lips.
‘Y-yes?’ he says, a little bit choked, and drops his bag and offers his arms eagerly for his hug. Steve wraps his arms around him, tight and good and firm, with his pointy chin pressing into Tony’s neck. Tony rests his head on Steve’s shoulder and sighs blissfully, closing his eyes.
‘Hey, it’s fine,’ Steve says quickly, and that’s when Tony registers the flowers, and what the hell, why didn’t JARVIS warn her about this, this is another one of those tragic moments where she spectacularly messes everything up, and her heart drops down, down, down, and it – it just hurts, after this morning.

, he can feel it, and he glares at Mr Karolidis under his own brows, because Mr Karolidis doesn’t understand. It’s
‘Hurt,’ Steve says softly and clearly, pointing at the gash. Tony slowly raises his eyes to look at Steve’s face, uncertain; and Steve’s eyes smile at him a little, his face and voice gentle. ‘Hurt,’ Steve repeats, still pointing at his hand, and then, holding Tony’s eyes, he slowly brings his pointing finger up towards Tony’s chest wound. ‘Hurt,’ he repeats, and oh, Tony knows what the word means now!
He brings his hands up shyly, and places them on Steve’s chest. It’s very warm and smooth, and it feels so strong under his hands that it makes him shiver, but in a good way that Tony doesn’t quite understand. Steve is breathing faster, and he’s looking at Tony in that soft wondering way he has sometimes. Tony looks up at him through his lashes, questioning, and Steve smiles at him (so
Tony breathes into Steve’s neck, her breath hiccupping a little. She wants, she just –

‘This is my Mamá,’ Darcy tells everyone proudly. She’s standing at the front of the class for Show and Tell, and she’s actually got her Mamá right there to show everyone! In her police uniform! It’s so cool, and Tony’s sitting next to Steve at his desk, looking at her in awe.
lately
Steve hesitates, and Tony sucks in a hopeful sniffly breath, and then Steve’s hand comes to rest carefully on Tony’s back again. ‘It’s – it’s okay,’ Steve says again, and his voice is kind of – soft, and Tony likes it. He cries a little bit more, and Steve starts carefully patting him.
Then Darcy bounces on her feet and says ‘Come look!’ and pulls Maggie over to the long shelf at the back of the room, where the plane is sitting. Tony and Steve trail along behind, Steve still firmly holding Tony’s hand.
Tony’s just gotten out of the car outside school when he hears someone say, ‘Hey. Tony.’
Steve draws back just a little, then, looking down with a furrow between his brows, and Tony follows his gaze. Steve is looking at Tony’s hands, taking them gently in his own and turning them over to look at the reddened palms. ‘Poor hands,’ he says softly.
Darcy props her elbows on the table and cups her face in her hands to think about it. ‘We can be if you wanna,’ she decides. ‘But you gotta be nice to Tony.’
He moves his head, and there is the Stranger, sitting by the fire and stirring something in a bark container strung over the low flames. Tony huddles into the skins, watching, afraid yet fascinated.
There’s a gentle hand in her hair. Steve’s hand. Steve strokes Tony’s short curls behind her ear, and says, ‘Tony. You okay?’
‘GET DRESSED, STEVIE, WHO THE HELL HAS SEX ON CHRISTMAS DAY,’ Bucky roars, and Tony giggles harder.
‘Can you help me make a cupcake?’ Steve asks abruptly, and then adds, ‘Please.’
Then Steve flips them so that she's on her back, pulling Tony onto her chest. And – God, it's incredible, Tony can
‘Sorry,’ Steve says again, quietly. His throat feels raw and his chest aches. But he has to tell Tony something, and he closes his eyes and doesn’t look at him. ‘I – I don’t care if y’like – Pepper Potts better. It’s okay.’ There. He said it.
‘Please, please, please, please,’ Tony chants wildly, her fingers pulling at the white cotton, and Steve makes a little ragged sound, amusement and arousal together, and kisses her again.
Tony doesn’t want to give up contact with Steve’s body for more than a few moments, so they end up showering together, which leads to other, very nice things. There’s a few minutes of soapy bodies and writhing against each other under the warm spray, but then Tony bashes her elbow on the tiles and screeches because it
‘Thought you might enjoy it,’ she says. She reaches down again, and then Tony makes a little surprised ‘oh!’ sound, because something tugs slightly inside her. ‘It’s alright, darling,’ Steve says, looking amused, ‘Just the cord to pull it out with.’ She strokes Tony’s thigh, then softly cups the vee between her legs for a moment, hushing Tony when she wriggles and whimpers. Her hand travels slowly up, across Tony’s stomach and up across the scars between her breasts, and then she strokes her thumb gently into the hollow of Tony’s throat, her collarbones, her fingers wandering softly over Tony’s skin.
Steve stood in front of the skyscraper and tilted his head up so he could see the top of it, barely visible on the cloudy day.
Without visual input, Steve’s traitor mind immediately supplied the hundreds of things Tony could do with his hand twisted into Steve’s hair. Pull him around wherever he went, shove him to his knees, press him into the couch.
“Those are big words for someone about to pop off.” Steve arched again, their familiar bickering transforming into flirtatious banter and it was enough to make Steve’s own cock twitch dangerously close to falling over the edge.
Tony smirked. “Yeah, that. So it’s okay if you can’t like, you know, tell me about your life. Or don’t want to. Like, I get it. You might have a life, a family, or like a super secret job, or something. I don’t know what I’m saying, but I do know that I’m saying that you don't need to say anything--”
Tony spun the ring between his fingers. The deep, dark garnet stone, framed in bright gold, glinted in the light. They were his colors, but they looked foreign on the jewelry. He focused on its engraving - a triangle, circle in the middle of it with a line cutting vertically through it, the top point to the center of the base. It was beautiful, even with the jagged crack someone stabbed into the very center of it.
“--and that’s the first quarter, ah, Mr. Stark, fashionably late as usual.”
“Can’t say I thought about much more than punching you in the face and updating that gorgeous Captain America suit of yours--” he turned his head and bit at Steve’s ear hard and fast, almost as if he just wanted to make Steve gasp again. “But then you bullied your way onto my mission, my bed, and now my arms. So I have to say, I’m paying attention now.”
“Okay,” Steve agreed. He pulled out his wand and pointed it at his hand. “Whenever we’re ready.”
“None of that,” Steve chastised. “Put on that cock ring before you start having a little too much fun with yourself.”
“I just realized I’m going to have to be thankful to this MRI-wannabe sleeping torture device for bringing us together.”
Except this wasn’t Steve’s fight. It never was, and it wouldn’t be until Tony tapped him into it. And right now all Steve could tell from the situation was that Tony wanted him to keep distracting Stane far more than he wanted him to strangle him. Because on the bed, Tony moved silently to his knees.
He didn’t look at Steve when his gaze left Stane. Instead he took a steadying breath and slid his hand into Coulson’s, introducing himself.
The orchestra crescendoed into the middle of the first act, and Tony shifted in his seat in the front row of his box at the Met. Every movement pressed the plug into a new angle, and he floated between pleasure and overstimulation as the opera faded into the background. The fact that at any moment anyone could turn them a passing gaze only amplified Tony’s problem.
“You get the things you want,” he breathed out.
Steve smiled. “How’d you figure all that?”
Anthony dropped his wand and stepped back, tilting his head in assessment. “Rather dashing, actually.”
“Aren’t doing this for you. And neither should you.”
Coulson fixed him a stare, a beat of silence filling Steve’s office. “He likes to trade with nefarious actors.”
Steve may have said something that sounded like, “The best gift I could ask for,” but it was swept up into their first kiss.
That first evening, Steve tried to push thoughts of Tony away, but his shame and self-disappointment bubbled over the next twenty four hours and by the following day, he was researching.
He leaned back and Tony slipped his hand into his pocket and the vibration stopped. Steve gasped, somehow missing the sensation that had tortured him for hours. But then Tony was lifting off from his cock. His tongue licked at his lips as he watched Steve, catching a drop of come that he had missed. Steve followed his tongue, eyes glued on his abused lips. He wanted to reach out, could see the bulge in Tony’s pants.
The sensations eased after a moment, then sped up at random, sometimes coming from just the ring gripping the base of his cock, sending tremors up through his shaft, and other times coming from the plug, stretching him so wide, so open for Steve that he could just walk up here and slide it right out, a perfect hole for Steve to slide right into. His hips jerked behind the podium, and no one could see, no one except Steve. The sensations abruptly stopped, and Tony bit back a whimper.
There weren’t many things about Tony that left Steve off kilter, but seeing him in polo gear was one of them.
Bucky bumped his shoulders lightly against Clint’s uninjured side. “Oh come on, Hawkeye.”
Pepper tipped her head in curiosity, watching. Steve caught Tony’s arm and then his gaze, whispering something to him. Tony gazed up at him with open adoration, and that was when it hit her.
“Good morning,” Steve greeted him.
The car pulled to a stop and out popped a broad shouldered young man with a bucket hat and sweatsuit on, a puffy coat casually thrown on top. He adjusted his black shoulder bag and waited as a shorter man with platinum blonde hair, skinny jeans, and a leather jacket slid out behind him. The last two.
“No. If I’d known this last time,” he began, tone firm, shaking his head at Steve. “Tony may be willing to risk that you could be sent back to his world, but I’m not--”
“Steve?” Tony asked, not moving and voice so soft it was barely like he spoke at all, but it was enough to remind Steve where they were and why.
It wasn’t until the second act that Steve realized Tony hadn’t been entirely forthcoming about the toy.
“Tony Stark. Who are you?”
“And you’re American.”
The cage was barely big enough for a large dog. Crouched low, Tony's shoulders brushed the crisscrossing metal that formed the top. He was naked and filthy, caked with dirt and blood and in the corner of the cage was the source of most of the foul smell that filled the room.
Bucky piled on another blanket, hoping that the weight of an additional quilt would go the extra mile, when it came to keeping his injured boyfriend still. Clint was not one for still. Yet here he was on the couch, injured from battle, arm unable to bend in his cast let alone pick up his faithful bow and arrows.
“Please stop,” Anthony pleaded. “We’re about to face him.”
“We’ll have to thank SHIELD for the date idea.”
Steve adjusted the strap of his bag over his shoulder, juggling the folders in one arm and his shield in the other. He turned to push the door to the locker room open with his hip, shuffling in awkwardly, so as not to drop any of his precarious collection of things. The room was filled with voices which was unusual. This locker room and the attached gym was for all the Ultimates, but Steve and Clint were the only ones who tended to use it.
Bucky turned his head back to Tony, and Steve watched their display at the foot of the bed, Tony and Bucky teasing all three of them with a filthy kiss, tongues twisting wildly together and moaning throughout. Steve’s hips tried to find some relief, lifting into the empty air.
Tony gasped, nodded.
There was a grunt through the comms, a flash and then the rip in space started to stitch itself back together again, with Tony stuck forever on the other side.
"Is that all it was?" Steve couldn't help but ask.
With the target obtained, Steve pivoted on his heel and began his retreat. Like before, no one noticed or cared about his presence. He slipped from R&D and back into the elevator, pressing the correct floor for his briefing this time. Glancing at his watch, he still had three minutes.
Steve swallowed, answers to every unasked question flying around his mind but he could hardly manage to stammer out the one word reply. “SHIELD.”
Something twisted in Steve’s stomach when he typed Tony’s name next to Obadiah Stane’s but he needed to do it to get his search results. The twisting stopped like the precipice of a roller coaster and dropped when the webpage loaded.
“Ah,” Steve replied, voice tight. “A model. That makes sen--Showing him around the grounds?” Steve--Professor Rogers, the
“Looks like you’re ready for a long day at work.”
Tony spun the ring on the desk closest to him. “It’s weird hearing that accent out of my own mouth.”
“What?”
James didn’t answer, at least not with words. Instead he swan dived into the water.
“You should tell Fury we could send a SWAT team in there and gut the place. No private citizen, or corporation for that matter, should hold that much manpower.” Rumlow leaned against his doorway, sending Steve a toothy smile. “Don’t you think, Cap?”
He went to sleep that night only after tossing and turning for hours, the scent of Tony fixed fully in his head, evolving from scared, distressed and sour, to citrus mixed with honey. His hand wandered as he drifted off, wrapping around his cock on its own at the memory of happy, flooding slick wafting off of Tony as he sat on the chaise lounge. The memory of walking over to him, of leaning in and absorbing that smell, to bending over and kissing him--
...he was solid
But then a voice cut him off and it was like everything just...
Steve met Pepper's gaze but he didn't really know what to say to her. He just followed Tony into the bathroom to see him washing his face in the sink, the water pink as it bled down into the plug hole. Something tugged in Steve's gut.
!  You don't say one damn word to them, you understand?  They're trying to ruin us!"
"...Steve?  ...I'm not mad at you.  But I
"But that shouldn't even matter! I don't even notice shit like that."
. Steve was completely out of his comfort zone. Not just with the collars but everything. There was a reason Pepper had to be the one who dragged him out shopping; Steve was terrible at it. He had good reason. He'd never had money before, him and Bucky had barely 'shopped' in their lives for anything more than food. And it didn't help that he didn't technically
Tony leaned in to speak to Steve softly.  "Your call, Steve. I think Maggie Frond sounds like a total bitch.  But you know what they say... keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Plus, we can scope out who's there. The omegas in that room will be the ones that need you most, and the Alphas in that room will be ones we should watch our backs around.  ...and you have my permission to be quietly indignant." He smiled a little and nuzzled Steve's jaw.
"So you guys are gonna hover over me while I go through Dad's stuff?  What if I don't find what I'm looking for?  Then will you leave me alone?  I can't make any promises.  Creating a new element is a damn big order, even for a genius like me.  And it takes time.  And frankly, I normally only work like two hours a day and that's with Pepper breathing down my--"
"Good luck out there Captain; keep an eye on Stark for us."
"Wouldn't want to be Waffles right now."
?!  No!  He's drowning, shut it down!" barked Tony.  He rapped on the glass.
"Is ten grams a lot?" Steve asked, genuinely not knowing how bad that was.
?  Every time I ever bit your neck, I felt like I was going crazy.  How does anyone have that much self-control? Or is he just so fucked up in the head he doesn't do stuff unless they tell him to?  What's his
He didn't like this room.  It had a bunch of associations that weren't his.  Even inside the helmet, he imagined he could smell singed hair and taste something metallic.
"Maybe I was a bad choice.  You... you let me bond you. Maybe you shouldn't have.  I'm not a good Alpha. Not a very strong one, you know? I'm sorry.  If you want I can distance our bond." Steve looked like he wanted to protest.  "You
"He wants what I can't give him," Steve whispered, sounding miserable as he pushed his hands over his face. He sniffed, wanting to be stronger than this. But in that moment he just felt overwhelmed with guilt. He felt sick with it.
.  The food was great and the alcohol was strong and everyone was being a hell of a lot more welcoming now that his collar was off.  Tony was actually
"We have to send him away."
"Calm down, Rogers.  We're all professionals here and we were sent on the instructions of SHIELD and the World Security Council," said Rumlow.  "Listen, give me your phone and I'll try Tony for you again. If we can't get him then we'll take you to base so that you're safe, which is what the WSC advised us to do."
"Answer," Steve called back, setting the running machine to a lower pace so he could speak to her properly without sounding breathless. He kept it at a  fast pace walk but nothing more.
Steve still smelled incredible but it wasn't the same intoxicating, mind-numbing scent as before.
-- aww--
Tony shook his head.  "I'm not an infant, Rogers.  I can walk all by myself,
"My mom played piano.  She would walk past and play the opening notes of Ode to Joy whenever she was happy.  It was like laughter. She did that less and less as I got older. Dad drank. Sometimes, I would pass the piano and play those notes, just to piss him off.  I don’t know why I did that. She took the blame for it. He blamed her.” He paused again, letting the silent spool out. "And... and that's all I really remember.  Not her voice or her laugh or even what she looked like, outside of the photos. Just those eight notes on the piano."
"Sir, this is a restricted--"
Fury dropped a suitcase onto the table a little loudly. He opened it to reveal a dozen needles inside. "These won't cure you," he stated and pushed them over for Tony to inspect. "But they will buy you time. As for a permanent solution, we believe you can find it in your father's work."
Pietro ignored him, walking hurriedly down the block, wanting to put some distance between them.  He hadn't meant to cause a scene but...
Steve let his fingers brush against Tony's as the other moved close. He really needed a shower after his run.
, it was wild. Everything was disposable; no one fixed things anymore.  They just got new things.  And admittedly, it was all shockingly convenient, the one-time-use culture of the 21st century.
real.  But let's face it, you're hormonally and emotionally compromised right now.  The psych eval was rough for you.  You've recently bonded, for the second time.  It wouldn't be hard for them to get into your head right now.  How do we know they're not trying to engender sympathy by mixing up your memories of Bucky with the Winter Soldier?  By getting you to associate the two of them?  I've been thinking about this a lot, and I think that, somehow, that's what's happening.  Maybe they found a way to... I don't know... make the Winter Soldier smell like Bucky so that when he comes for you, you'll be incapable of defending against him.  Psychological warfare, Steve.  I've seen a hell of a lot of it in my life and it's just as effective as bombs and guns and tasers."
"Pietro.  Stop pacing."
Steve nearly dropped Trickshot. "Every two weeks?!" he echoed, appalled. On his heat, Steve was a mess. If he had one every two weeks he didn't even know if he'd be a full person; no wonder some of the omegas seemed willing! That was all they knew; they had to be half out of their minds.
The hair on the back of Tony's neck stood up; Tony felt his lip twitching, wanting to curl up.
"It's okay.  Good omega," murmured Tony.  He leaned down, kissed the mark, nuzzling it with his lips, trying to find any familiar ridge.  His own mark was still there, mostly gone, though. Still, he could see one or two small dimples that were slightly out of place from the primary mark, left there by his own teeth.  "Okay... here we go..." He put his mouth gently over Steve's skin.
"Where's the body, I need-- I need to take him home--"
And here: a picture of Howard and Maria sitting on the couch together, smiling at a camera, and there,
His Alpha. He had to keep him safe.
"--which he kind of was in the car, to be honest, so we sedated him, as ordered," continued Rumlow, ignoring Tony.  "Here's the k--"
"Steve.  Steve, it's gonna be okay," he said.  There was blood on Steve's face and Tony could feel himself shaking inside the suit, literally shivering.  The blood was his, from the cut on his lip, but he wasn't thinking clearly; the mere picture of Steve with blood was terrifying, the worst thing ever; he stomped into the ER in the suit, clutching Steve like a ragdoll.
"...it's just an
"Are you guys actually okay with this?" Steve asked abruptly.
the greatest.  Steve doesn't have hackles, either, we can't all have
"I think Aria's having a lie-in for Christmas," Steve murmured as he slowly picked at pieces of waffle. His appetite had lulled. Everything had lulled really. Steve seemed sleepy despite the fact he'd been awake for an hour. It wasn't a bad thing. He almost enjoyed this feeling of doziness. "Very well deserved.  So... are we having a day of Christmas movies? Because apparently they're a thing and I've not seen a single one."
"I can't just show you here Tony. We have to leave the house. In which case, we both need to get changed. And you definitely need to shower. And brush your teeth. I want them to have a good first impression of you."
Tony, of course, growing up in the seventies and eighties in the upper crust of society, had never really been aware of such things.  Omegas were all well-behaved in his neighborhood. No one would keep an omega that wasn't, after all. The omegas were pleasant and servile and Tony had never seen anyone have to raise a hand to one, at least not in public.  In the country club, the omegas floated around with a pleasant sort of desperation to please, and Tony couldn't think of a fault with a single one of them.
"Hm?  Yeah. Yeah, totally," agreed Tony blearily, struggling to sit up.  He stretched; the dander on the back of his neck rose and then went down reflexively.  Tony gave the back of his neck a vigorous rub just to make sure it was flat.
He jumped onto the guy's back, scrambling over him, trying to grab the arc reactor from him.  One of his hands was wrapped around the omega's throat.  He was gasping for breath.
Fury paused to take a breath.  He was truly living up to his name.
"Yeah?  What's that, huh?  You just left half the fucking team out there,
Onscreen, one of the character was screaming, "Mike!  Mike!"
They stepped outside. Steve let out an awkward shudder as Bucky lit up his cigarette, his eyes distant and glassy.
"Well, it makes sense that his brain would, wouldn't it?" snapped Tony, bristling a little.  "I thought the point of that exercise was to figure out why Steve's been mentally hunted by the Winter Soldier, not to remind him of all of his World War II survivor's guilt."
"Steve," said Tony suddenly.  "You wanted to start a charity.  Let's do it together.  We can name it after him.  That... that would be a good thing, right?  ...right?"  Tony looked up into Steve's eyes, seeking some absolution there.  "He was an omega, he wanted... he was behind you.  He believed in you.  In the future and omega rights and stuff.  We should do that, in his name..."  He trailed off, searching Steve's face for approval, for forgiveness.
His omega was cold; Tony's whole world suddenly tilt-shifted and rearranged itself toward making Steve comfortable.
.  His Alpha.  He felt conflicted on whether or not it even counted.  He didn't feel traumatized, exactly.  Mostly just sad.  But that was not the story he was allowed to tell.  Not yet, anyway.
Maggie Frond had already pulled away and Tony was left with a lot of very confused emotions.  He wasn't even sure if they were his or Steve's. For a split second, Maggie Frond had almost seemed... nice?  Sexy? Maternal? Some weird combination of all those things? He was offended, deeply, on Steve's behalf, but had no idea how to react.  He looked at Steve in alarm for some indication of how they felt about this.
sorry, Steve," whispered Tony back conspiratorially.  "I didn't meant to mark you, I just got caught up... I'm not saying I'm one of those douchey Alphas that goes all feral and takes omegas, I'm just saying I-- I didn't mean to, I'm kinda drunk-- not that being drunk is an excuse, either--"  He laughed nervously and ran his fingers through his hair.  "Wow, okay, I... I sound like a moron, I sound like an asshat, I'm sorry.  If Pepper were here she'd-- you know, she's very into omega rights, she doesn't know how hard it is... I'm sorry, are you... are you going into heat again? I shouldn't be here."  He rose, took a wobbling step forward, and grabbed the couch to stabilize himself.
for the morning..."
"A white tulip bouquet connotes an apology or symbolizes forgiveness.  Shall I send one to Miss Potts?"
"You know how bad this looks, right?" asked Tony, plucking a strawberry off the plate and popping it into his mouth.  "You know what a
"Nice to speak to you too," Maria replied dryly, having heard Tony swear. She sounded tired, like she hadn't slept since they'd taken in Wanda and Pietro. "Steve, there's something I should tell you. Phil wasn't sure but..."
"The one and only," confirmed Tony.  He reached up to cup Steve's cheek. "A Shamrock Shake will make everything better.  They didn't have them in your time, but I promise, they're... what would you call 'em... the mutt's nuts."
"I don't know what that means ma'am," Steve told her. "Can I go out and look at it?"

Steve turned a little a pink. Oh God, he had done that, hadn't he? The night after the shoot
Was this normal, post-heat?  Tony wasn't sure. Steve looked tired suddenly.
magazine.  Have you heard of
"Hey," Steve returned softly and went to sit down next to him, smiling faintly at the invitation. "I... I imagine there won't be much to show. I assume it's changed a lot in the past few years, huh? Aria's thrown the word 'hipster' around a lot. Whatever that means." He went quiet at the mention of his mother. Steve distantly remembered his amnesia after the ice, not being able to remember his mother's face.  Guiltr tugged at his gut. But he could always remember the day she died vividly, the way she'd clung to his hand so tightly...the way Steve had cried when Bucky had made him let go.
Bucky eyed the man, lip still curled up, but the man was in a submissive posture.  Bucky was easily the most dominant one there. He eased himself back onto the barstool and turned his attention back to the television to watch Steve longingly.
Steve broke away to murmur that he loved him; Tony nosed his jaw in response.  "'M'mega," he mumbled.  He slid out of Steve gently, rolled over, peeled off the condom, and tossed it aside without any indication that this action was in any way unacceptable.  Yet another indication of a life lived with a nameless, faceless, ghost-like presence of staff that revolved madly around Tony at all times.
"...what's he doing?" asked one of the men in the lab coats.
"Sorry, sorry, bad timing.  But seriously.  Are you you two still...?"
He got into the car and started her up whilst Tony settled himself in. "Kinda wish I could drunk right about now," he admitted, affected by Tony's own nervousness. "But I don't wanna know how much alcohol that would even take..."
Clint looked to Natasha; she gave the slightest shake of her head.  She could read people like books and it was obvious to her that Tony's overly cruel remarks were a result of hurt, not maliciousness.  The way his eyes kept sliding over to Steve with an expression of longing and grief told her everything she needed to know.  The guy was clearly smitten.
," Aria sighed.
Tony was confused about why Steve wouldn't want to wear his dogtags (he thought they looked sort of hot) but didn't protest.  He climbed into Steve's lap and took Steve's hands, guiding them between his legs. "You're already good... so good..." he purred, kissing Steve's lips.  "Feel that? That's for you... I'm going to mate you, Steve... I'm going to make sure you're all filled up with my knot... go ahead and use me however you like... I'm all yours."  He licked at Steve's skin, tasting his sweat, enjoying this. His brain was slowly going into that weird static mode he'd felt in the plane. Steve's smell was warm and rich and familiar and made him both exhilarated and sleepy.  He was already stiff. He had a vague idea that he should go get condoms but he didn't want to leave Steve and he doubted he would remember to use them by the time Steve's heat was in full swing.
Now he felt guilty, too.  Like he had no right to be upset, since it was Steve, not him, who had been force-bonded.
Karpov was right; the average person clearly didn't know what they wanted or what was good for them.
The words became all the more chilling after he'd watched the man plummet to his supposed death.
"Mr. Stark has shut down all administrative privileges except for his own."
"I have a name!" Steve called back, although his tone was good-natured. "Behave yourself, Wilson," he told Sam playfully before he pulled away to give Clint a proper welcome. Clint hugged him tighter than usual.
He spread his thighs as if to make a point and then groaned in relief when he felt the first press of fingers. "Fuck, Tony. Please," Steve said breathlessly, rocking his hips down into Tony's touch in encouragement. His cheeks were flushed, his lips parted, eyes fluttering shut. Steve looked serene, and he felt it.
Happy helped them shoulder through the crowd of reporters to the car.
"You know it won't be a good person, Donner.  You know that anyone who bonds you is going to be someone with a chip on his shoulder about Captain America and he won't be gentle with you.  The people offering to buy you aren't exactly interested in your well-being."
"What if
"Did you honestly think I wouldn't find out? Using Colonel Rhodes was rather lazy of you."
"David, what is it?"
"Soldier," demanded one of them.  "..
"...JARVIS... JARVIS, did Rothstein have special tickets, by any chance?"
"Tony?" questioned Pepper, watching him move back and forth in the middle of the cabin, a slow waltz with himself.
"Just letting you know," she said.
They didn't arrive late. They arrived
"She's just been ignoring my texts, that's all," Steve murmured. They would talk quite a bit, usually. Pepper had his dry sense of humour and would often tell him funny old stories about Tony. It was nice. Or it had been...
"Thank you Aria," Steve said. "For everything."
"You can.  You
"I'm here, I'm coming up behind you. You lost about six!"
"Omega," clarified Natasha, her eyes eyeing him sharply, her gun still trained on the older scientist, even though his hands were still on his balding head.  "In the east, we say bears and rabbits."
When they got back to the house it looked about as awful as Steve expected. Happy was snoozing against the couch right by the door and Aria was ushering a very drunk woman and gentleman out the door. "Where the hell have you been?" she asked, peering over them both.
"They left me here," said Bucky mildly.  He didn't really question why he ended up anywhere; he assumed HYDRA knew what it was doing.  He wasn't supposed to ask why.
like that... you're so lucky... it's because you're an omega.  It's not fair.  I'm, like, his biggest fan."
"Steve?" said Natasha.
"Do you think I would be asking if I could help it?" Nick actually sounded frustrated or....unnerved.  "You were sent there as backup.  I was hoping I wouldn't have to call on your.  But our primary SHIELD agents were decommissioned due to circumstances outside of our control, and we need the two of you to step up to the plate.  It's a matter of international security.  Trust me, we wouldn't be calling on you as our first choice."
Was this a bad dream, maybe?  Some sort of flashback?
"I'm not going to share him," said Tony.  The words were growled, not spoken. Gleason noted the bristling, the slight curve of his upper lip.
"Stark?"
They followed Natasha through the observation room and into the hallway; Fury was walking toward them.  Tony bristled, the hair on the back of his neck spiking; Natasha gave Fury a lingering look as they passed by him.  He didn't speak to them. Steve didn't know what that meant.
"But they're there... by choice?"
Sean appeared.  He was younger than Tony, but not by much; he had on a pair of slacks and a button-up shirt and he'd loosened his tie.  Clearly, the guy had just come home from wherever he worked.  He smelled like cigarette smoke.  "Oh, hey."  He held up his hands.  "Listen, I don't want to fight. I'm happily married,
"Where ever you want, pal."  Steve was thankful that she didn't press him.
again. He was shaking with excitement too. They'd done it! Oh Malick was so in for it, and Steve would be glad about it too...if he wasn't terribly worried for Donner. He seemed so sweet...he deserved better.
He curled into Tony's touch on instinct as an arm snaked around his back, and fell into a truly deep sleep.
The line went dead; Tony looked up into Steve's eye with a tender smile.  "...that's how you feel, too, right?  ...I mean about... about bonding.  It's about the same for omegas, right?"
"He...he threw me against a wall and I just...yeah.  We didn't know.  Me and Tony.  We... I guess, during our honeymoon... y'know?  Yeah."
Fury being shot was one of the few elements of Steve's story Tony didn't feel the need to compartmentalize.  He didn't know Fury well.  He certainly didn't wish him any ill will, but it wasn't close enough to home to bother him.  Steve being shot or hurt was another matter.  Tony was already coping with that in the only way he knew how: through denial and compartmentalization, laced with as much alcohol as he could physically drink.
Howard looked over at Tony again and pointed with the hand holding his tumbler.  "Do you know him?  Is this how you're spending your break, dragging home some street zero who's on the crack?"
shit and it makes me go crazy!"
"No, I didn't hear you."
"...yeah," agreed Tony.  Nonetheless, he couldn't shake the feelings of guilt.  Guilt and loss and... everything bad, really.  He gave himself a shake and then gave a practice smile in the mirror.  "I doubt he'll miss his own dinner.  Heck, bet he'll beat us there.  ...where's Dani?  I need another drink."
It was weird to think Peggy was Tony's aunt whilst she'd... kind of been Steve's crush. They'd both liked and respected the hell out of each other. But Steve's old mate had only just gone missing and they were fighting a war. Perhaps if Bucky hadn't been on the scene and there hadn't been bullets flying, things would have been different. But timing wasn't kind to them, and it didn't matter in the end anyway. Either way, she'd apparently had a significant impact on their lives. Steve could still remember her voice as he went down in the plane, as vivid and crisp as if it were yesterday...he wondered if she'd be well enough for a dance now. Steve could still remember the steps and he was sure she'd appreciate the humor in it. But the walks around the garden alone had tired her out so much...
"Steve, you're officially on lockdown.  No leaving the premises. They want eyes on you at all times."
He found a television in a bar.
at your earliest convenience. So you can offer some rebuttal to all the bullshit." She hesitated by the door. "I'm sorry. I didn't realize what that sounded like before I said it." She sounded sincere and something warmed in Steve's chest.
Maybe Tony was just confused; he was utterly disoriented; at some point he'd realized he was no longer actually upright but was upside down, sliding along the pavement in a blur of hot tarmac and metal and fire.  Interesting, although time had sped up outside his head,
"My favorite movie is
Tony led Steve up the stairs, out of the workshop.  He had wanted, so badly, to get some work done on the Mark VII but he felt like Steve needed to be away from technology for a while.  Swimming pools and sunshine were timeless.
"Wow... thanks, I mean... I'm seriously such a big fan, you are so cool... sorry, thanks!"  He backed away.
In the doorway, with Tony watching, Steve wrapped up his conversation with Phil.  "We should talk about this another time, maybe," Steve suggested, and Phil hummed in agreement. "Maybe have a poke around if you have the time; don't worry if you don't. I imagine you have a lot on your plate.  I'm gathering lots of intel here and I can relay it back to you later."
"It doesn't need
Natasha's silence spoke volumes.
"I will never get used to how much you guys swear in this century!" Steve laughed, shaking his head.
"I'm not making a joke.  I'm asking.  I don't understand why male omegas need a special doctor."
He glanced back into the hall; the twins had stepped out, wrapped up in bed sheets. "I'm pretty sure Sera has someone in there. She's number five," the girl offered and Steve went a little pale.
"It's okay... I got you... we're okay..." murmured Tony soothingly.  The words were without any real meaning, just comforting white noise.  Steve's body was stiff and shaking.  Tony was shaking, too.
"I've got enough broken fingers already.  Pep, go call Banksy. Tell him we need him here, tonight, like, right now."
He relaxed, however, only once Steve had moved up.  He closed his eyes at the light, wet touch of Steve's lips on his.
A moment later he was snoring softly.
"What do you mean?"
Dr. Gleason gave him a funny look.  "Well, yes.  That's where the cervix is.  It's not dissimilar to a prostate exam."
Tony's eyes widened.
Tony squinted a little; he seemed lost in his own thoughts and didn't bother returning Steve's smile.  "Yeah, yeah, Trickshot came up.  Ron kept complaining about him. ...something about
Tony was angry at himself for letting the asshole who did this get away.  He should have gone after him and killed him, or taken him alive, but instead, he'd let him go, too busy dry-humping Steve on the floor like an animal.
Tony lifted his nose into the air and huffed a little, trying to figure out where they were.
"It's locked," he reported.
but now...now Tony touching his neck felt nice again.
The waiter with the flop of brown hair appeared and wordlessly pushed a whiskey over to Steve before walking away. He downed it before anyone could notice it. Least someone was on Steve's side.
"Oh my God, me and Boswell's is June first, too!  Totally traditional date."
"Anything?"
"Turn on the lights?  Steve, we severed the power source.  Until the guys on the outside hook up the jennies, I can't do jack-shit," said Tony with a frown.    "Just intimidate them by candlelight.  Where are you guys? We're downstairs, give us a location."
Well,
Natasha didn't look amused.  Instead, she looked away from the instrument panel long enough to look at Steve, mouth the word "
"Tony sounds like a jerk.  I'm sorry you lost your pup," he ventured while the omega cried, gripping his hair in his white-knuckled fists.  That didn't help, so he tried something else. "You can ask my forgiveness, if you want. I'll forgive you."
"Uhhhh-huh," agreed Tony wearily.  Steve had cum into his hand; seconds later the two of them were limp, soaking into the bed, sweat and semen smeared between them, both panting softly.  Tony was well-aware that he was panting a lot harder than Steve. He was older and Steve was, after all, a workout junkie. But even Steve looked a bit dazed after coming undone twice.
"You were eavesdropping?"
"Also, Natasha called Aria.  She wants to talk to Steve and says it's critical, something about Clint."
"Ah!  Mr. Stark!  A pleasure to see you again, and you too, Captain Rogers," said Richard, nodding pleasantly at them.  "And-- my God, if it's not little Donner Malick. Where's Gideon, Donnie?"
a heat. Which you can't do if every omega in that annex was essentially in pr or post-heat... or just plain heat. They can't consent properly."
"...yes," said Pepper grouchily, who was wiping Tony's face off with a cloth.  She reached into her purse again, found a tube of concealer, and began dotting his face, blending it in to hide the bruises under his eyes and the small scar on his lip that Justin Hammer had left there last year.
"It's better than Triple Sec!"
"Don't want to be late!  Seriously, Frond's one of the best in the biz... I'll get you a copy of her book, she's like... like the Cesar Milan of training omegas... she has three and they're the best-behaved omegas you've ever seen..."
"Two and a half hours."
"...Colonel Karpov?" he asked, confused.
"You mean... how you were treated, because of your status?" Louis asked tentatively, trying to bridge the gap between Steve's words. Steve trembled. His eyes looked glazed over.
one!" said Steve firmly.
The vulnerability in Tony's voice made something tug sharply in Steve's chest. The blonde swallowed, phone getting clammy against his ear from the heat of his face. He swallowed and paused to think before answering.
. Even if it was only a hot meal for Bucky to come home to, the other still appreciated it. Especially in the winter times, when it was so cold outside Bucky used to tumble straight into bed from work and Steve had to bring him dinner on a tray. He missed those days sometimes. Being smaller...knowing what it was to struggle. He didn't miss the stress but he missed the comradeship, how close it had brought him and Bucky together.
He went back to eating breakfast, keeping a straight face.  He was glad to know Steve was okay.  Sort of.  Unless Steve couldn't mate.  What a terrible fate, to have to endure heats and never be able to get relief.  Then again, they made suppressants.  And lots of omegas chose to suffer through their heats instead of pairing up with an Alpha.  Hell, that's what Steve had done only days before.
The girl's attention, at least, was no longer on him; she had turned to an omega sitting next to her.  He was holding a bunch of papers and books and things.
"It's a party!" George said, speaking a strange high pitched accent. Maybe he was doing an impression of someone... but Steve didn't recognise it.
"Fifty shots a day is what I call Tuesday," joked Tony, trying to grin.  "And if he's right, if I'm drinking eighty-six ounces a day, I'm
Tony's eyes fluttered open and he stretched, smiling.  "Merry Christmas, Stevie." He reached out to touch Steve's cheek and struggled to sit up.  He grabbed his glasses off the nightstand and observed the breakfast in front of him, going straight for the bacon and coffee.
made it work.  Tony was getting thoroughly aroused, and his thoughts were swirling with memories of both Steve and that fucking redhead--
"Coulson!" Sitwell hissed in disapproval. Gleason's eyebrows raised.
He sidled up to Steve as Steve groaned, curling up, and wrapped an arm around him, nosing into his neck lovingly, his whole body tensing.  He felt the back of his neck tingle and a swelling between his legs. "...I love you..." he murmured softly. "...I got you, Stevie..."
miss women," said Tony.  He shrugged a little. "But I flirt for the cameras.  ...Steve, I'm forty years old. I don't have the stamina I did when I was twenty-five.  ...it's just that... after I came back from Afghanistan... I felt like if I didn't keep it up, everyone would... would think something happened.  So I kept going. But no, flirting's just... just part of my reputation." He paused, then said, "Y'know, before you were unfrozen, there was a big story in the news, that I slept with all of 2007's Maxim cover models.  So here's... a big secret. I only bagged five of the thirteen. The others, we just
"Steeeve!" exclaimed Tony with delight, leaning into his touch immediately.  "This is Steve, my omega!" he informed the bartender happily.  Loudly, in a stage whisper, he added, "
"No!"
.  I mean, look at the number of times DUMM-E has hurt me, and I still keep him around.  ...useless piece of junk."
"Do you have two collars just so you can bet your omega?" he asked Mike, trying his damnedest not to slur his speech.
"Na-night Stevie. Now move your ass."
"So I guess this is the last I can eat or drink until tonight, huh?" Tony said, putting an elbow on the table and looking out the window.  A couple that was exiting had stopped to admire Tony's car; Tony watched the man circle it while his partner (girlfriend?  wife?  omega?) waited impatiently.  Tony looked back over at Steve; he was examining the key fob in his hands.  "Listen, I know this isn't your home," said Tony, suddenly.  "I know everything is weird for you, but I hope you can learn to love my time as a sort of... second home.  It's a good place to be in.  Even with all the bad things that happen in it.  I mean, we're not perfect, but we're getting better.  I think.  Y'know, two steps forward, one step back--"
None of the questions were anything compared to dealing with the bigotry of Gideon. Most of the questions were respectful, polite... there was one about Steve and Tony's relationship and where it stood now. It came from the
"Main stage is this way," said Tony, turning and leading Steve through another alley.  Steve followed him; Happy flashed a pass at a guard who was standing by an unmarked door, and then walked into a covered area.  Below them was poured concrete with an epoxy finish; above them was scaffolding, wires and lighting gear criss-crossing.  Someone walked past carrying a car battery.
Tony's eyes lit up.  "Yes! Yes, I'll do that!  Take me back to the hotel! No, wait!  Keep driving! Send someone to go get my laptop!  They can meet us en route! ...that way!" He pointed to a random direction.
"We are," said George, tapping away on his phone.  "Do you have
"Aaand for the record." Steve almost felt sheepish and set his menu down so he wouldn't feel tempted to hide behind it. "I've never actually been on a date before," he admitted. "So I don't quite know how this works. Aside from food and conversation...I guess it's a lot of firsts this week."
"I don't need help," snarled Tony defensively, glaring at her, hair standing up.
"Utterly devastated," said Natasha frankly.
"Excuse me a moment," he said to Natasha, giving Steve's hand a loving pat.  He slipped out of the room, closing the door behind him.
"But I'm his doctor. I can't treat him if I don't know what's going on," Gleason pointed out and moved to sit down on a sofa opposite Pepper with his bags in his lap. He didn't want Phil to take them by accident. He would have tried to introduce himself but the omega seemed quite obsessed with his task.
"But...then what's the point?"
"What are you making?" Steve asked, peering over the tables and honestly having no idea. There was obviously method in Tony's madness but it meant that, for Steve, it was quite undecipherable.
"Did you say Pitbull?" asked Tony, hackles rising.  He scanned the room attentively. He and Pitbull had a long-standing feud that neither of them remembered the cause of, although both suspected it had to do with the title "Mr. World-Wide," which both of them had laid claim to.
"I had all these... these visions.  Of us.  You were so mad at me.  I couldn't talk to you," said Tony.  He was staring at the ground instead of Steve, his hand still on his neck.  "...you're not mad, though.  Right?  That wasn't real."  He glanced up, then down.  "It was different than when we did it together.  It was just me.  I couldn't feel you."
He tried to smile. It didn't meet his eyes.
"It's impossible to synthesize," said JARVIS.
"...Mr. Bennett, I think.  I think he talked to Mr. Bennett."  DeSoto dared to glance up, almost hopefully.  "...could
He swigged the orange juice, then added, casually, "I saw Gleason on the way out.  He, uh, gave me like... like a pamphlet for some support group."
." The woman was an omega, young. Her hair was done up into pigtails; they looked cute.
Once they slowed down Steve let his legs fall back down either side of Tony. He reached up to run his fingers through his Alpha's hair gently. "Mhm. Perfect. So good Tony..."
Eric laughed and patted his shoulder.  "Man, I like your chutzpah! I
He didn't know what the answer was and had decided just to wait.  Steve would come back and Tony would just... follow his lead. That wasn't an ideal solution, but it was the only one Tony could think of, and he stayed up late turning it over and over in his head.
"What?" asked Tony, who did not know how to talk to children and did not appreciate being called "mithter."
Tony heaved a sigh.  "Please tell me you're not analyzing our mating patterns."
"Uh-huh..."  Donner waddled out of the room.
But then his eye caught another person in the room.  A young man was standing against the far wall, watching them.  He wasn't in a lab coat, or any sort of uniform. He was wearing a pair of track pants and a t-shirt, and his long hair was threatening to fall into his eyes.  He had a goatee, the same silvery blond as his hair. Tony wasn't sure how he hadn't noticed him before. He was an omega. He didn't look at all upset or concerned; he was eyeing them with bored curiosity.
believe it, but she’s tipping her face up towards Steve, wonderful perfect Steve, and Steve’s bending down towards her lips.
One evening Tony asks Steve again what the ‘pretty’ word means. He crawls over to where Steve’s sitting grinding herbs, and rubs his head against Steve’s shoulder. ‘Pretty,’ he says insistently. ‘Steve, what’s pretty?’
Tony picks the envelope up with fumbling fingers, trying to screw up the courage to turn it over and open it, because – because it’s easier to rip a band-aid off quickly. But at that moment, of all things, the morning silence shatters with the emergency call to assemble. And Tony shoves Steve’s note deep in her pocket, shoves the hurt down just as deep inside, and suits up. The world needs Iron Woman, not Tony Stark and her stupid,
That’s… okay. Tony lets out a relieved breath and edges into the seat, unzipping his backpack and pulling out his pile of stuff. Mom had given the list of stuff to Dad’s PA, because she was busy and couldn’t get it herself. But Tony had tipped out the bag she’s brought onto his bedroom floor and written his name on everything. He got the S for Stark right every time now. He used to get mixed up about which way the curl went, but that was ages ago, when he was little. Now he knows it’s the same as the logo on Stark Industries, of course. He knows all his letters now, and numbers up to 100, and he knows lots of other stuff too.

Someone’s thumping on the workshop glass with great enthusiasm and determination, damn them. Tony makes a grumbling noise, because Steve stops what she’s doing to listen, and what she was doing was sucking a wonderfully thorough bruise onto Tony’s neck.
It's evening, and Tony wanders down to the kitchen. She's been in the workshop for hours, fixing the rotator joints on the suit's gauntlets, and she's tired again, but it's the good sort of tired, the sort of tired that comes from working and testing and tinkering with things until they're

‘Cool!’ Natasha says, fascinated. ‘Can I han’shake with you, Tony?’
Steve’s big hands are very gentle. He cleans the wound with warm water, and Tony flinches and squeezes his eyes shut as it throbs and stings. Steve strokes his hair comfortingly.
‘EMERGE, SHIELD-SISTERS, FOR WE HAVE A LARGE MOUNTAIN OF GIFTS!’ That’s Thor, and Tony starts laughing in earnest.
When she glances up, Steve’s watching her. ‘You’ve done this before,’ she says.

But today he has something particular to ask Mr Karolidis, something he wants to do to say sorry to Tony for being mean and making him cry. He waits until he’s sitting at the table holding his glass of milk. (Mr Karolidis is very big on feeding Steve milk. He says it will help Steve to grow up big and strong, and Steve’s still faintly hoping he’s right.)
"OPEN THE--"
"I mean, like, with you being shorter and not very dominant."
magazine.  They might be a good fit."
Aria was already texting Pepper with her other hand, checking she was actually okay. Steve seemed to have spaced out for the entire event.
Tony felt bad; omegas couldn't distance the bond.  If George's Alpha didn't give him up, then George was still stuck with him, at least emotionally.  It seemed like a terrible fate. But George seemed pleased with himself for running away, getting an education, and partnering up with Project 84.
"Tell him Tony's very busy helping me adjust to the 21st century and we'll call him back later..." Steve told JARVIS, letting his eyes slip shut again.
Tony hung up, turned the phone off, and then snuggled back into Steve's bed.  The sheets smelled so good.  Tony was looking forward to Steve leaving so he could jerk off to the smell.  Maybe rifle through the medicine cabinet once he was done sleeping.
Peggy had had a proper wedding because her husband was a beta. She'd shown Steve the pictures. Angie had been her maid of honor.  At the time it had been controversial for an omega to be present for a their Alpha's wedding ceremony. But that was Peggy. She loved ruffling feathers and breaking all the rules. The pictures of the ceremony were beautiful and the photo of them laughing over the cake (the top of which fell off onto the floor) were downright adorable.
"Perhaps he has nothing to say."
"But we don't know about what the boy's capable of," pointed out Pepper.
.  With-- with his back straight and-- and his hands-- it's the right position.  It didn't look right. He was-- the way he was kneeling-- it was all wrong. I could feel it, feel his panic, I-- I didn't get there soon enough, he was touching his neck, he-- he was rubbing him, right here--" Tony pointed to a spot behind his ear.
Why hadn't he been there.  Why hadn't he been shot instead.  The memory of Steve bursting into the reception room covered in blood was burned into the back of his mind, and while he'd been able to handle it in the room full of people, now that the dinner was over, it was hitting him, full-force.  It was a living nightmare.  Steve wasn't supposed to be mortal.  He was Captain America, he wasn't supposed to get hurt.
is what it's like.  And now I can handle it.  And now, I guess, I know the worst thing in the world isn't there being another Alpha or thinking I'm not a good Alpha.  It's losing you. This was all a huge wake-up call. It was like Afghanistan all over again." Tony had begun to perk up, only to wilt as he blurted the last sentence.  "Only instead of me, it was you. And instead of building Iron Man and escaping... you got force-bonded. God, Steve. I'm sorry."
On the radio, a fourth person had joined the fray.  "Well, it's all very well for
He leaned over to nuzzle Steve's neck, hoping their earlier argument would be forgotten and they wouldn't have to talk about it.  The lights were down on their stage and the audience's attention was on the performance on Set 2, giving them relative privacy.
"Shit, I meant... there!  Him! Steve Rogers!" Paul turned and pointed to Steve.
His question answered itself; eight men walked out of the building, shaking hands.  They were well-dressed. Several were holding briefcases... but only one was handcuffed to his.  That had to be the guy.
"God, do you ever turn it off?" groaned Natasha.
He struggled to sit up.  "Damn it, no drugs, come on..." he griped, trying to pull out his IV.  The heart monitor went wild.
Bucky's mark.
"...what a remarkable woman," said Stern behind him.
Steve changed gears.  "I should have been there for him before, and I won't make that same mistake again," Steve said resolutely. "And if Tony really cared about me, he'd know I had a duty to protect my ma- my friend."
He was starting to discover some unpleasant side effects from the arc reactor, but these, too, he kept hidden.  Even Pepper didn’t know.  Tony was managing it himself and was doing a decent job, in his opinion.  The palladium was degrading into rhodium and it was poisoning him, but a cursory Google search had revealed that chlorophyll could mop up free radicals from the blood.  So Tony just had to keep choking down smoothies and he’d be fine. He turned away from Steve and began striding, confidently, toward the meeting room.
Time slowed to a crawl and Tony watched Steve's body arc through the air, coming to an abrupt stop as it hit a wall.  Tony felt like he was being impacted himself; all the air left his lungs; he could have sworn his heart stopped for a moment; he was watching his omega get hurt, maybe even killed, and he couldn't stop it, there was no time...
"I'll call Lowenstein," said Pepper wearily.
"I can't... I can't make sense of this..." said Wanda.  "It's like... like he thinks too many things at once, there's too many connections, I can't--"
Tony beamed at her.
"It's my floor!  I'll do whatever I want!  We already have the set up for the photo shoot!
He spread his arms with a look of smug triumph.  "Ta-da!  Sober as a judge!  Would you let me lick you if I wasn't your boss?  If I fired you, right now, would you feel more comfortable?"
like last year... except instead of ruining the car, remember, you and me and Mercedes--"
"Yay," repeated Donner, dazed.  He clung to Steve and George's hands, panting softly.  "It-- it hurts."
"What sight seeing were you thinking of?" asked Steve.
Steve sighed. "I feel like if I searched for Bucky I would lose Tony in the process," he conceded. "It kind of...feels like a choice."
it.  It was unnatural and obnoxious on him.  But it fit Gene perfectly. Gene had a faintest hint of a very posh south accent and Tony would not have been surprised if he was from Carolina "old money," or the son of a Texas oil baron.
Cooper seemed to notice and, jealous of the attention, abandoned the dishes to commandeer Steve's attention.  "Want to see my room?" he asked eagerly.
He felt confused and unsettled.  He didn't like the way this guy smelled or the sound of his voice.  Or what he was saying.  He knew him?  No he didn't.  They'd never met before.
was very lucky," Steve breathed. Off the top of his head he could probably count about ten different scenarios where he'd almost been taken and lost his 'virtue', as it was called back then, and only gotten away by the skin of his teeth.  And that wasn't even counting all the sticky situations Bucky had gotten him out of. Sure, he owed a hell of a lot to Bucky but he also owed a lot to
"And I'm in the middle of an international crisis," replied Fury.  "You two can go back to chatting in a minute. Rogers. Leg."
"I'd have to ask my manager, sir."
before I
"How come you and Tony ended up together?  He's supposed to be a crazy playboy guy, isn't he?  And he's like, totally unhinged, and walks around in robot suit?" asked Five.  "Is he like your other Alpha?"
Tony liked this new game.  Tony would never admit it, not in a million years, but he was a sucker for uniforms.  Maybe it was just the power they represented.  But he'd never seen Steve, in real life, dressed in his, and it was a thought he'd turned over a few times since discovering Steve's identity.  That was probably what Steve would be wearing to the White House dinner and Tony was looking forward to it.  Something about seeing an omega,
Aria ignored him and offered a cell phone to Steve.  "Clint Barton's been calling me about every five minutes.  He wants to speak with you in private. Emphasized that he doesn't want Tony to have anything to do with the call."
Steve blinked away slowly. He'd been so deeply asleep that the landing hadn't even woke him. Huh. So much for good survival instincts. Steve smiled at the feeling of Tony's hand in his hair and looked up at him sleepily. "Hey," he murmured and reached hand up, his thumb swiping close to the chafed, swollen red skin around Tony's eyes. Yes, those omegas in the crowd had been products of their situation but that most certainly did not excuse attacking Tony.
"What was it before?"
He had a sudden urge to spar. Steve would have to arrange it with Natasha sometime. She was of the only people who could handle his strength.  He bet these women could, too.  These
Pepper heaved a world-weary sigh.  "Just e-mail me, will you?  Are you sure your heart's okay?  Are you taking it easy?  How's the leg?"
Yep.  DeSoto's fingers were still in his ears.
Natasha smiled in turn and cocked her head. "Ваш акцент улучшилось. Вы практиковали."
Tony perked up a little when Steve waved to him.  He walked over to the edge of the pen and gestured for Steve to come over.  He was curious to know what the people in white were like. They looked like a bunch of normal kids, college undergraduates lounging on the quad, eating finger sandwiches and chatting.
to live their lives as spades, wasting all their potential, when they could be changed, improved, made to be--"
"Oomph!  Princess, c'mon, that was too hard!"
, he knew the words to her songs… he liked to sing along as he ran!
Tony swaggered toward the door, rubbing his neck stiffly.  He was becoming obsessed with checking his blood toxicity.  He wanted to check it again before putting on the suit.  But it wasn't like he was going to do any heavy lifting.  He just wanted to strut around for a bit.  People loved the suit; they loved Iron Man.
"Hey Pepper," Steve said, perking up instantly at the sight of them. She didn't seem mad at him, right? Maybe Aria had been right. Maybe he was just paranoid.
"She said she wanted me to wait till I was twenty five, so I'd be sure," Hal said. "She's only five years older than me, but I wanted to finish my degree and Master's still. Now I'm doing my doctorate and teach, and she works at some big industry thing. It worked out well." They were clearly an incredibly smart pair and both doing well for themselves. Hal's Alpha hadn't limited her success; she'd bolstered it, supported her through further education. They were the perfect example of what an omega and Alpha could be as equals.
Peggy laughed and rolled her eyes.
Phil sighed, weakly texting back.
Kerry grabbed a clipboard and scribbled madly on it, then held it up for George.
"It was hell.  Didn't you say you'd come up with a... a preventative method for us?  It's nearly fall. Is Steve still going to cycle normally?" asked Tony.
.  And guess what?  You and Barnes aren't going to be fighting over Steve.  Steve
"What's that?" demanded Phil.
"You were bonded once. You don't remember that. They took everything away, didn't they? S'why I stopped feeling you. But the bond is broken." Steve leaned forward again. "I know you felt me. And I know you felt Tony. When I kept seeing you outside, a part of me knows that was real.  Somewhere in our subconscious, we're still tied together, somehow."
, you cunt-faced spade!"
"Not different enough," Steve found himself saying without thinking. "There's still a lot of issues in education around omega needs. There isn't enough accessibility for suppressants and safe spaces for heats. And there's still a lot of prejudice. I can't even believe, that with today's technology, there's still issues surrounding the availability of abortion. Everyone talks about equality, but not nearly enough people actually
"Well, yeah, but... c'mon..." said Steve, blushing in earnest now.
"Erika from Natick?" asked Tony in confusion; he worked closely with Natick on the development of fire-retardant fabrics.
Maggie Frond strode over suddenly to Steve and put a hand on the back of his chair.  "Please stop laughing, Captain Rogers."
He waltzed out of the bathroom before Steve could get him any more aroused and slid one of Steve's towels around his waist.  He wiped away the steam from the mirror.  "Steve, do you have a razor I can borrow?  ...please tell me you don't still use a straight razor.  My face is a disaster, Steve.  My beard is supposed to look like the Stark Industries logo and instead it looks like someone from Nike tried to shave me in my sleep.  Ugh."
Tony beamed at Steve.  While Steve fiddled in the bathroom, Tony zipped around the room, checking the orchid by their bed and getting himself a drink from the bar and making minor adjustments to the telescope by the window, the whole time talking, more to himself than Steve, about all his plans for the Mark VII.
Tony looked down and considering his drink, then took a sip.
Steve wondered how Natasha, Clint and Laura... his brain mercifully didn't conjure up the mental image. Steve wasn't sure he could have coped with that.
The two scientists didn't move, watching with interest, Karpov stifled a yawn and reached into his jacket for a flask, looking thoroughly exhausted.
"...and people like Tony here, we'll continue to do so."  Steve half-smiled. "So I guess... all I have to say is... thank you for listening and... supporting me, and my bond, and... uh, being awesome."
"You have to stay near the suits."
The man in the suit glared at the man in the lab coat, and he knew that the man in the lab coat had asked a stupid question.
.. and now he couldn't do anything.
Tony felt excited.  Maybe this was the thing about DeSoto that had interested him on poker night.  Wanting to know more about what happened to "bad omegas."
"No, I didn't!"
"We called Dr. Gleason.  Figured that was the guy who... knew the most about you.  Fury's trying to get him added as a SHIELD consultant and get him clearance in case... you know," said Natasha.
"No, you definitely ruined me," said Tony, with a grin.
Fucking heats.
was the cherry on the cake. No- actually, you know what was? Afterwards.  It was Tony being fucking grateful that you'd made me lose it! I mean-"
in your day, Steve.  Number one on the '43 charts:
"Oh shit," said Tony in alarm, jumping back.  Several people stared.
He nudged the tip of his cock against Steve's entrance.  There had been no foreplay, but Steve's body was responding automatically; he was already wet and Tony sank his length in, shuddering, the back of Steve's neck still in his mouth, muffling a groan.
The arm that had been out of place no longer looked out of place.
"No," Steve said, and frowned. "But that's not going to happen. I don't think so."
"Shit." Mackenzie blinked.
"Steve, I'm not going to leave you," he said softly.  "...what was it we used to say? That... that we'd..."  He fumbled for the words. They were just on the very tip of his tongue.  "...that we'd be together 'til the end of the line?" He gave Steve a weak smile; it felt weird; he was out of practice, making facial expressions like that.  "...ain't no one gonna scare me off. You're stuck with me, kid." He watched Steve longingly on the other side of the glass.
"I'm sorry,
“Don’t ever compare me to a dog again,” snapped Steve.  Somehow, the thought of Tony finding him “cute” made it even worse.  He wasn’t there as a form of entertainment, and he didn’t like hearing Tony’s skewed opinion on his existence without even being able to defend himself.
"...Tony?"
"I like it like this!" protested Tony as a second hairdresser began poking at his head.
"I'm sure," repeated Fred, in a tone that sounded like he didn't believe Steve whatsoever.
He stepped forward, not hurting him, but pressed Tony up against the wall with his forearm. "I do
be giving a live demonstration; sorry, horseshoes--"
Steve was talking, but Bucky was still basking in the amusement of seeing Steve behind the wheel of a car.  He was actually pretty good.
It was Madeline Turner's card that Piper had given to him.  Tony pulled out his wallet and held it up. "This is what Piper gave us."
"That explains the destruction of the living room yesterday, sir," said JARVIS.
Tony's stomach flopped.  Vanko couldn't possibly have friends, could he?  Who the hell would want to be friends with him?  Sure, he was smart; smart enough to have reversed engineered a palladium-core RT node.  But arc reactor aside, he was unstable, unhinged, dangerous.  Who would want to help that guy?
Happy looked, well... happy. Least someone was apparently having a good night.
"I only started having problems with Bucky since I went in the simulator," Steve breathed. "I really don't think that's a good idea. I was awake for months and nothing. I saw him in the simulation with a metal arm I couldn't have possibly known about. I mean- if you want proof that the simulation is bad for me then that's it. I'm not going back in that thing. No way." Before Sitwell could get a word in edge-ways Steve had convinced himself of his opinion.
Tony's jaw tightened.  "Yeah. I'm coming."
Tony Stark and Steve Rogers," he said.
"Yesterday he bit me. It felt like I was dying.  And then I saw him through the window."
"Tesseract?" repeated Steve.  That rang a bell.  Not a good one, either.
"Braggart," said the guard, watching the screen.  "...the hell's he doing now? He bit him and now he's just walking around with a hard-on.  How bad did Karpov screw up his brain?"
Donner seemed confused at the idea. Rhodey sighed. Maybe he shouldn't have gone down the honesty route... but he couldn't have kept all this up till midnight. He really wasn't that good of a liar. And Donner looked so unsure he'd hoped to reassure him, but the mention of Steve had just scared Donner out all the more.
Rhodey's words made sense.  Logically.  But Tony's hackles remained up at the presence of a more dominant Alpha.  Rhodey kept his distance from Tony and Steve.
A lump formed in his throat.  He tried to swallow it with more whiskey.  He had a million questions for her; she was one of few people Tony didn't mind looking ignorant in front of.  But he didn't speak because he felt like doing so would cause a deluge of emotions and after his total breakdown in front of her after finding out about Bucky, Tony felt it was important to maintain control around her for a while.  He didn't want her to think that bonding had made him into an emotional mess.  His eyes darted up to meet her green ones, which were flooded with sympathy.
Steve grabbed a robe (one of his own this time, which meant better coverage) and waited for Tony to grab his before they cautiously made their way downstairs. He could still see the tepee in the kitchen but didn't sense Phil inside of it. Pepper was on the sofa with a coffee, scrolling through emails on her tablet.
"Well, I think you can be forgiven for that, Steve.  Come on.  Let's go down to your party."  She offered Steve her arm; Steve took it.
Tony nuzzled into Steve's neck with a quiet whining noise; his hand dipped into Steve's shorts.
Bucky's reaction was immediate, but probably not what Karpov had expected.  He let go of Steve and slammed against the glass door, clawing, snarling, instantly feral.  The threat of another Alpha to his omega had broken whatever last bit of consciousness was holding him together.
Steve managed to make out some kind of light in front of him, supposedly the exit. He set down his basket on the floor, feeling bad, but he couldn't walk out without paying. He walked into someone. "Sorry! Sorry!" And then stumbled out onto the street. He still couldn't really see, and, God, he was
Natasha's eyes narrowed.
Aria rolled her eyes.
sandwich.  You guys would be the bread... you don't call a sandwich a 'bread sandwich'... y'know, you name it based on the filling...."
Mackenzie cam back in about ten minutes.  "Okay, I'm sticking with you guys. I mean... I would have to anyway... since Steve, you know, has the... you know, the bond to... the... asset."
"They'll probably pay a 'consultation fee'," Angela piped up from her desk. "They use that phrase a lot. It's all legal- getting help with a match, getting advice. You're paying to be introduced, not
"When you say 'we', do you mean omegas?"
"I want to go to the archives. I want everything they have here.  Including those videos of us. I don't want SHIELD to see them," Steve said quietly. If they took Bucky in but Tony found out they'd kissed... then Bucky really would be dead.
"Aria's in the kitchen I think," Steve filled in for her.
Natasha frowned.  "I can only tell you what I saw.  I showed up and he was on top of you.  It looked like... he was going to..." She was speaking quietly, but still censoring herself, just in case.  Laura was distracting Cooper, getting him to help with the dishes, although she clearly had an ear turned to what Natasha was saying.  "...I told him to back off. He reacted the way any Alpha would. He got aggressive, told me to back off, started bristling, laid himself over you.  There was no way to get him off, so I tased him. He tried to attack Sam, again, because he saw another Alpha as a threat, so I tased him again. And then we left him.  ...that's really it. Was he going to...? I don't know. It looked that way. You were pretty much unconscious from hunger and getting over an induced heat. We don't know what happened to him afterwards.  But we know from intercepting HYDRA communications that they don't know, either. He could be anywhere. ...what's your plan, Steve? He's not the person you used to know. ...and I don't think Tony's quite ready to be in a trio with another Alpha."
"Right!" said Happy.  He did a quick scan of the room, found an empty spot on Tony's desk to set the take-out bag, and then shoved his hands into the tangle of women to separate them.
repeated Bucky, looking completely and utterly lost.  Arguably, it was a sign of progress that he had an expression of confusion instead of his usual thousand-yard stare.
"I think I'm gonna go for a jog. It's a nice day outside. I won't be more than an hour," Steve assured him. The sun was pooling into the house enticingly through the huge walled windows. He was never usually this cooped up indoors for this amount of time. He just hoped nobody was going to harass him out in the real world. He just wanted to jog and that was really it.  "Okay?" he checked and took the other's hand, squeezing his fingers lightly before he tilted his head down to kiss his temple.
Wait. His lungs were fine, weren't they?
"You really have. I remember your first week undercover, when you called me from that gala. You were so furious with him. I don't even remember why now. But you were being all that
Steve felt a strange sensation in his chest. He reached up a hand to his own chest, feeling his own heart beat.
," he finished lamely.
"Trickshot didn't have a choice," snarled Waffles.
Steve wasn't sure what a 'houseboy' really entailed but he didn't want to ask. Boswell seemed so calm and gentle; it was hard to imagine him force bonding anyone...but it had happened and Steve couldn't ignore it. It was one of the reasons he didn't really talk to Boswell all that much one to one. He found it hard to get over. Every time he looked at the man all he could think about was
"If stalling is a form of avoidance, then yes, sir, it appears I have."
, what do you think?"
He suddenly saw a brown eye staring at him.
"He went to bars, a bit," Steve said with a shrug. "But I didn't go out much. Omegas weren't really supposed to go to those kind of places, you know?"
Aria texted Pepper minutes later.
"I was just looking for the car keys," said Tony.
Steve had been advised that the "real" Captain America, the one overseas, was an Alpha; the one they portrayed in newsreels and spoke about on the radio was a strong, dominant, boy-next-door type.  It was good for people's morale, they said. Steve should never tell anyone the truth, they said; it would be too much of a shock to the American people to think that an omega was fighting their war.  He was kept away from most social functions stateside, because the knowledge that Steve was not really an Alpha was privilege, secret intelligence and they didn't want anyone sniffing out his true status.  Steve remembered being escorted to the White House, where he'd had to use a different bathroom than the other Howlies.  He remembered being barred entry to a bar in England because of his status.  He remembered being told he couldn't leave military bases to socialize with citizens because it would devastate them far too much to discover his real status, and spending long nights alone while the other Howlies painted the town red without him.
"He's sixteen, Maria, what did you expect?" said Howard, looking entirely nonplussed.  He took a sip of his drink.
"I want to be an omega," insisted Cooper.  "How come you don't know?"
"...was worried you wouldn't come back," said Tony, with forced casualness.
Steve went to the bedside and sat down heavily. He ran a hand over his face. "Your brother."
dead, why is Steve still thinking about him?" demanded Tony.
do you think you're doing?" she demanded.  "Who let you two in here?"
. That was a scary, modern-day word. But then Steve had technically performed on stage countless times with the USO... and that was all live. He couldn't see the crowd properly but he could see a lot of people and the bright green light of the camera above. He wondered how close the thing was to his face, how much of his expressions they would be able to see.
"Steve Rogers!  ...so you were
Steve let out a groan of frustration. "Fiiine," he muttered, sounding almost petulant. He leaned over and fumbled around in the jaw before he produced the appropriate box. He grabbed a condom and then ripped the thing open with his teeth before ducked down and sliding it onto Tony's dick. Steve was half shaking with anticipation and frustration. It was evident he really wanted this. That he needed it.
DeSoto was still watching Tony attentively.  Tony took a sip of coffee to buy himself some time.
He thrust harder, faster; he felt Steve quivering and whimpering beneath him, Steve's own body moving, seeking out its own pleasure automatically.  Every time Tony hit Steve's prostate, Steve's whole body clenched deliciously around him, tugging the knot.
He was relieved when they moved on to all the fun stuff.  Tony had been itching to take an IQ test; he was too many standard deviations for his intelligence to be quantified accurately and most tests concluded he was somewhere in the low 200-range without giving a solid number.  Word association was quickly abandoned almost immediately after Tony associated "trust" with "fund" and "capital" with "gains;" he beamed at Dr. Brazinski as she dug a pile of ink plates from a drawer of her desk.  She was finding what she typically did; that the smarter a person was, the more they liked to play around during the tests, making it difficult to access what they were really thinking.
Tony made sure he heard the car starting before he dropped his mask.
"His picture's on your fridge," hissed Tony.  "The
One, Nine, and Seventeen were waving at him, looking excited.  Whoever had made the choice to go with white clothing for them had clearly done it for a specific reason; like most omegas, these were easily half blonds, and the whiteness of their clothes made them shine.  Nine and Sixteen were blond; One had dark hair and sideburns like Steve's. Either they were coming back in fashion or Steve was influencing a fashion trend. Or, perhaps most likely, it was a combination of the two.
you'd meet Miss Frond... she can help you... you know, Donner here used to be terribly behaved but we set him straight, didn't we, Mags?"
Tony looked at Steve worriedly and shook his head.  "I talked to Pepper, but, Steve... I don't think I can get the money fast enough."
With that, he pulled the goggles back down and went back to welding, humming to himself loudly.  The shop was Tony's happy place; even buzzed as he was, his hands were steady as he worked.
Slowly, Steve produced a smoke grenade from his pocket. He sent Tony a small nod, waiting for one in return (Tony gave Steve a small, tight nod.) before he lobbed it across the street.
In the back, Tony had passed out on the floor, propped up against the wall, a screwdriver in one hand and a martini in the other.
Donner looked up at that.
Steve grabbed the plate of half-finished food and took it upstairs to reheat it again before making coffee, with an extra shot of
"Come with me, Mr. Stark," said the police officer wearily, guiding Tony away.  Tony was not the slightest bit upset. Actually, it had been wonderfully cathartic.  He looked over his shoulder at Steve with a grin.
"Yeah... yeah, it is... but there's less and less of it..." said Kerry, patting him awkwardly.  "Are you sure you're okay?"
"Thank you... JARVIS," Steve replied slowly. It was strange, talking to an AI. Maybe he would get used to it in time. He downed a bottle of water and quickly slipped into the gym shower before heading back to their room to change into his clothes-
"In the second guest bedroom's ensuite," JARVIS filled in and she sighed again.
"I didn't," said Pietro.  "I've been looking all over for you since I heard about the fire.  I'm just very fast. What did you do that for?"
Tony leaned down to nose against Steve's neck; collars were no longer designed to "protect" the bonding gland, and Tony could see the mark just above the rim of the silver-plated vibranium; without thinking, he bit, sinking his teeth into flesh, aggressively, animalistically; his fingers were digging into Steve's hips, probably bruising them; he was already balls-deep but still pushing, pulling on the back of Steve's neck with his mouth like maybe he could tug Steve further onto his cock, which was throbbing so blissfully inside him--
‘Darcy said you three made a plane together last week,’ Maggie says gently, crouching down so she’s at their level. ‘Can I see it?’
‘My good girl,’ she says again, soft. ‘You did
He twists his head up to look at Steve, and – and the light is glimmering on Steve’s face, off Steve’s eyelashes, and Tony thinks he knows what ‘pretty’ means, now. He reaches up to shyly touch Steve’s chin, and says, ‘Pretty Steve,’ and Steve opens his eyes wide and looks down with a surprised face. Tony face feels suddenly hot, even in the cooling evening air, and it seems like Steve’s neck is a good place to hide it. He buries his face in Steve’s warm skin.
for a few moments.
asthma.
After a few minutes Maggie goes away and comes back hand in hand with a tall lady with red hair like Ms Potts, except for that it’s straight and short instead of long and curly. She has a nice smile, like Maggie, and when Darcy sees her she jumps up and runs to give her a hug. ‘Mummy!’
The throbbing pain of the wound spikes suddenly as he shifts the wrong way, and Tony lets out a soundless hiss and claws at it. And oh, it hurts, it
Tony,’ and then shifted so that she can rock against Tony’s hip and hand, clinging on to Tony’s shoulders for purchase with unsteady fingers. After Steve has climaxed in just a few minutes with a small choked sound of shock, biting softly into the hollow of Tony’s neck, Tony caressing her face and back and skin with gentle little touches as she comes apart.
“Magical artifacts from other dimensions coming face to face with my exquisite science, what could go wrong?”
“Right, yes,” he began, trying to find his words and push away the distracting sensation of his hard cock squeezed by the firm ring. With every shift on his seat the plug moved within him, and trying to pull up his latest creations was a feat he only managed to accomplish because this was not the first time they’d played this game. They both loved it, Steve at home, doing whatever domestic chore was on his to-do list today, all while sending Tony’s teasing images or erotic orders. His husband never lacked for imagination, and put his strategic and creative mind on ways to drive Tony insane.
“Fascinating,” Tony said, more focused on the pads and mats leaning against the wall than Anthony’s reply. His eye hit a bit of metal shining in the light and between two mats was the metal curve of a shield. It wasn’t painted but it had the same spherical indentions, the same star in the middle.
Steve sat down on the chair next to him. “Well, about that--”
Steve gripped the book to his side and took an aborted step towards Tony. “I just want to make sure you’re okay--”
He had to tell him the truth. “Tony…” They continued down the aisle, the entire floor of the tower, no walls or rooms or hallways, was jam packed with so much stuff it pulled Steve’s attention. “Wow.”
When they reached the limo, Steve slipped into the backseat, desperately hard, mind racing as he wondered what Tony’s plan was. What he didn’t expect was Tony sliding to his knees between Steve’s legs.
“A hawk that can’t fly,” Clint grumbled.
“See that’s what I used to think too--”
He was so absorbed in the reactor’s glow that when Tony’s hand slid to Steve’s hip he startled. The hand stilled and so did Steve, willing it to stay. Then it moved, sliding upwards until it could wrap around the fabric of Steve’s shirt and draw him close enough for the other hand to join it.
The words caught in his ear. He’d heard them before, back in the 40s, in hushed tones, usually to describe an illegal abortion. Steve’s face must have displayed some of his horror because the woman smiled indulgently. “It won’t hurt your omega. We have plenty to choose from, from condoms--both for you or them--along with implants and suppressants.”
He squeezed Tony closer, and it made the man squeak, so Steve loosened his grip. The movement had been enough to break Tony’s thoughts, but instead of saying a word, Tony chose to hold Steve tighter and bury his head in his chest.
Steve’s blood boiled.
Tony’s face couldn’t hide his surprise, and Steve felt his wings shift behind him. It was starting to hit him that he had wings. He could
He sketched, trying not to think, which was probably how he ended up drawing a rough sketch of the window display from that day on the sidewalk. The clothing that had transfixed Tony, with its sleek, dark fabrics, and finely cut corners. Tony had stood in front of a three piece suit, the crisp, buttoned vest framed by an open jacket.
Instead he pulled his backpack around and unzipped it. He opened his sketchbook to the page he’d been using to recreate the day he met Tony. Carefully, he ripped the paper free and slid the book back into his bag. Then he pulled the burner phone out of his pocket. From the front of his backpack he pulled out a pen and left a message on the back of the paper.
“I should go get us supplies.”
“Close it.” How he managed the words, he hardly knew, since the feeling under his skin had started to build, coalesce, a pressure that felt like a sob but all encompassing.
“Of course he’s al--You’re not supposed to be here. Who do you think you are? What is it to you? He’s fine. Get out.”
Steve’s eyes shot back up to Tony’s. “I’m. I mean. Sorry. Of course. Sorry. The suppressants. I couldn’t not, is all. But I--” Steve abruptly stood, walking towards the pool and trying not to panic. Tony caught what he couldn’t hide, what was impossible to suppress: his reaction to Tony. He didn’t deserve another alpha sniffing at his heels, taking from him what he wasn’t offering.
“I’m sorry, there must be a mixup here.” Tony leaned over the couch, eyes trying to catch Steve’s. Steve would meet them, in just a second, he only needed to plant three more peach trees before he could look up from his Nintendo Switch.
“I haven’t a clue, but we need Steve to see and--”
He turned around to see that Tony had moved now and was standing in front of the cage with the sweater zipped up. It fell to the middle of his thighs, providing him with privacy and swallowing up his frame as he wrapped his arms around his waist. Steve felt a rush of warm relief, to see him standing, to see him clad in Steve’s clothes, to see his gaze raised enough to meet Steve's eye, even though it dropped away quickly. His legs were too thin, his collarbone sharp under the sweater.
Tony looked down at his legs, took a step forward then another, hardly steady but still moving. “I think so. If any security guards see us, though. They won’t let me leave. Not anymore, with Ana and Jarvis gone--” Tony broke off, voice breaking.
“A battleship that transported you to
Darkness, just the light from the hallway behind Steve shined through the door frame; all he could see were shadows. He could still smell Tony and now he could hear him, whispering and sniffling and shouting, but not coming any nearer. Steve fumbled for a light, knocked his knee into a chair before he found it, pulling the string of a standing lamp which cast the room into a low light.
Steve tried to focus on the conversation around him but his own mind tormented him. It was a charity benefit, he should be schmoozing. But all he could do was slide his thumb along its smooth, metal surface, feeling the tiniest of edges where the colors changed.
“I didn’t need the ‘Previously on’ portion of the meeting, but your concern is noted.” Tony sent the board member a smirk and he volleyed another insult back. It was their usual repartee and it helped Tony sink into the meeting.
Happy Wednesday, everyone!
“I’m….free.” The tight edges to his tone betrayed the shock he was slipping into. Steve turned him away from Stane, ducking his head so all Tony could see were Steve’s eyes.
Tony’s day wound down, but Steve had kept winding him up for the entire afternoon. The vibrations from the ring and plug keeping him on edge. His last obligation of the day was a virtual webinar, live streamed from the SI auditorium into the screens at laboratories and universities all over the world. A few local, interested parties might show up to see it live, but it was never very many. Still, Tony took his place behind the podium and waited for the hour to strike five.
“We seem to be missing two,” Namjoon said.
Tony eyed a broom hanging against the far wall, then glanced back at Steve. Now that he had a way back, he realized there were a few things he needed to do before he left.
Tony sighed. “Not really the point Anthony. The point is, now that we found it, how do we get Steve to bleed on it.”
“I want to keep kissing you--”
“Boys, boys. Don’t make me be the adult here,” Tony cut in, walking onto the balcony with three glasses of wine and a pillow wedged under his arm. He handed out the wine, then tossed the pillow onto the wooden floor of the balcony and followed its trajectory, lying his head on top of it.
Tony was in hyperfocus. His snug red breeches were tight around his thighs, narrowing into leather boots. He held a riding crop. Steve tried to clear his throat and swallow at the same time and ended up coughing instead. No one was around to hear, just Steve and his tray of refreshments, so he kept his eye on Tony as he approached the makeshift field.
“Trust me, I’m experiencing a similar surreal sensation. Is there a reason you’re not answering my question?”
Tony caught his glance. “Go on, pick it up.”
The sun was starting to set when he finished the sketch. Looking at the building, he considered his chances but knew he was going to go inside anyway. He pulled the mask out of his bag and fixed it onto his face in the empty alley by the back door. The kitchen staff glanced his way but when it appeared like he knew where he was going, no one questioned him.
Tony whined, nodding, and then Steve pulled out and came. Hot spurts landed across Tony’s hole, against the small of his back. Steve slumped onto his back, his rough hand reaching around, and Tony came to the feeling of Steve’s hand and his body rubbing his come into Tony’s skin.
“Oh, it’s nothing. More often than not alphas come in without their omegas, and they submit prescriptions for much worse things for them than suppressants. The law, as they say, benefits the powerful.” The pharmacist sniffed, her cheeks pinkening as she changed the subject. “Anyway, you definitely don’t want to hear my opinion on Alpha Law, so let's get you sorted. How old is your omega?”
Tony sighed, squeezing his eyes shut and taking a deep breath. Then another. Then another. Scenting Steve, Tony’s shoulders lost a bit of their strain. Before Steve’s eyes, Tony used his scent to calm down and he’d never purred before but the bubbling in his chest felt like the beginning of it. He cleared his throat and it brought Tony’s wide brown his to him. “Lose to me in chess?” Tony whispered.
Tony nodded, and without any finesse or care, Steve advanced, lightning quick, snapping Stane’s wrist until the gun fell into Steve’s waiting hand. Stane’s face turned red with pain, grunting and hissing every vile word he could seemingly think of. “You think he wants you, boy?” Stane snapped at Tony. “You think he cares about you? He’s using you, just like I used you, just like anyone who's ever met you has ever done, will ever do. Because no one cares about you. They just care about what you can give them, what they can take from you. You’re--”
Tony’s whole body tensed. The plug was designed to be unforgiving, able to shift inside Tony until the vibration rested directly on his prostate. It was a feature that made his cock twitch in the middle of the workshop all throughout the crafting process, and now the sensation was far better than anything he’d imagined. He gripped Steve’s arm. Remembering the dark glint in Steve’s eye when he slid the dark blue plug inside him--Steve loved this. Tony clenched, desperate, turning into a needy mess for Steve.
“I like you, too.”
“They aren’t together,” Tony stage-whispered to Steve.
One of the rows of shelves to their left had a box with a lid half opened, photographs spilling out. “I bet there’s some great baby photos of a tiny-Tony here.”
“Anything,” Steve breathed out, sleep making his words mushy.
“Steve?”
Thank you so much for reading! More to come soon.
Steve laughed under his breath. “They know that already. We’re just here in case one of them gets attacked regardless.”
Tony took another deep breath, this one less shaky even though it looked like his knees might buckle under his weight. “Take me away from here. He’ll be back soon and when he sees that--” Tony gestured to the remains of the cage. “--it’d probably be enough.”
They stood by the stage as the members walked through their songs. There were a lot of open vantage points, and it made Tony consider putting on the Iron Man armor, so that he could fly around during the show like he was part of the special effects, but that wasn’t in the cards, and ultimately unnecessary since the shapeshifter had to be close enough to make eye contact with a member of the group. He and Steve had to be vigilant and ensure that no one got close enough to look a member in the eye.
He had no idea who the pair were but he knew enough to know that he could find them on the internet. He knew the omega’s name was Tony and that the alpha was on the board of a company named Stark Industries. A company he wasn’t completely unfamiliar with, but by no means knew the inner workings of. With a couple strokes of the keyboard, he discovered there were seven people on the board and each one had a corresponding photo.
“Markets falling, industry still booming, I’m sure there’s not a whole lot that mainstream news outlets can tell you that you don’t already know about from briefings.” His eyes narrowed. “Well outside of finance and the latest commercial gadgets. Speaking of things SHIELD’s an expert on, we’re missing a nanomask and I’m doing a basic ask-and-hope mission to see if it turns up. Do you know anything about it?”
Tony cut off his thoughts because he hadn’t lost anyone yet. He scanned every street, looking the the familiar shoulder length hair, the stride he’d be able to place anywhere.
Steve groaned internally; it was barely an hour into the day and he was already on edge. There were a few agenda items that the mission crew member was supposed to do everyday. Between the two of them, they worked through testing the samples in different gravity levels, check on Jared, their pet axolotl--who was gathering information on the effects of outer space on axolotls--and completed a few wellness tests.
She’s just – just so lonely, and

She’s – she’s messed up
‘What’s it mean?’ Tony asks, nuzzling at Steve’s warm pinkened neck, but Steve just laughs and kisses her nose.
He glances shyly at Steve through his eyelashes. Steve’s looking at him, too, steady and curious. His eyes are blue, like the sky, and he doesn’t look shy at all. ‘I’m Steve,’ he says. ‘You should sit here.’ Then he goes back to carefully organising his pencils. He has lots of colours.
so much to see Steve's face like that. 'Steve.

‘Look,’ Tony says proudly, holding the knife out towards Steve. ‘For you,’ he explains, touching Steve’s chest gently with his finger. He watches Steve’s face hopefully.
‘I –’ Steve gets out, and then snuffles and sort of quivers and tries again. ‘Tony, I – m’sorry… don’t know what – woke you. Last thing I wanted was to bother you,

‘People shouldn’t poke anyone’s bottoms except their own ones,’ Tony explains, thinking it through. ‘Yeah. ‘Cause you don’t have

Then Darcy looks up and sees him, and her face spreads into a big smile and she waves and beckons enthusiastically. Her Mamá’s looking over and smiling too, and Tony suddenly feels terribly, awfully shy, his body going all tight and stiff and scared.
Tony sighs contentedly, turning her head on the pillow, as Steve starts gently buttoning her up. The fur is very soft and warm, and she feels safe, like a rabbit must feel inside its fluffy coat. There’s a hood, too, and Steve slips a warm careful hand under Tony’s neck, lifting her head a little so she can pull the hood over her messy hair, smiling down and stroking a curl aside. ‘There we go,’ she says, and her voice is soft and warm. ‘Can you wait here for a moment, honey?’
‘Hug,’ Darcy prompts, and Steve actually shifts gingerly closer and puts his arm slowly and carefully around Tony. And now Tony’s being hugged from both sides, and it’s – nice, it’s

After a bit, Tony realises there’s one thing that he can do to get Justin Hammer to leave him alone. He’s never really tried before, but one day he opens his mouth and taunts back at Justin, and realises to his delight that he can say mean enough things that Justin goes quiet and turns back around in his seat and gets on with his work. It’s an important discovery. Tony’s not very good at fighting with his fists, but now he has something he can hit back with, his tongue.
Next chapter will contain a Christmas party, and, finally, a first kiss! You can read this first kiss from Steve's POV
nice, and he doesn’t know why he’s still crying. He blinks at Steve through wet lashes, and Steve is watching him with a sort of worried face.
‘Such a good girl for me, aren’t you? You’re being so patient, Tony,’ she praises. ‘I’m so proud of you, sweet thing.’ Her hand is damp with Tony’s slick; she brings it up and licks one finger, enjoying the taste. Tony watches her with big wondering eyes, and Steve smiles a little, fondly. ‘You taste so sweet,’ she explains, and then gently smears a little at the corner of Tony’s mouth.
When he feels strong enough, one warm day, Tony crawls out to sit next to Steve in the sunlight, dragging a big soft deerskin with him. Steve looks up, smiling, and says, ‘Tony!’, and for the first time, Tony smiles back, hesitant, a little questioning tweak at the corner of his mouth. Steve’s smile brightens, his eyes crinkling, and Tony shifts closer and curls softly into his side, wanting to be close.
Her mouth closes around Steve’s nipple, warm and wet and suckling, and Steve groans deep in her throat. ‘Tony, baby,’ she gets out, ‘We don’t have to – you – ’ but Tony only sucks her breast in deeper, laving her tongue across Steve’s areola, tasting the perfect, silky, pebbled texture of it before tracing the tip of her tongue around the nub.
God, I love these two darlings so much. Next chapter: Tony cleans Steve up and wants very much to lick her. ;)
But Steve glances up, and sort of laughs, a sort of sniffle-laugh, but still a laugh, and says, ‘Yeah. Yeah, I should – I should do that. Thanks,’ and grabs a handful of tissues and blows into them hard. Then she clears her throat, and looks up at Tony properly, and her face is still blotched and pink, but she looks like
There is a Mrs Karolidis, too, but she is very tired and sick. She lies in her bed and sleeps, rousing a little to smile softly and drowsily at her husband when he goes to sit beside her and squeezes her hand. She doesn’t remember some things, like who Steve is, or that she’s not still living in Greece, but she remembers Mr Karolidis. It makes Steve feel sad and screwed up tight inside, sometimes, and he doesn’t really know why.
‘Don’t EVER touch my stuff AGAIN,’ Steve says aggressively in Tony’s face, and Tony can’t help it, he lets out a little stupid sniff and dashes his hand angrily at his damp eyes. Stupid,
she sings softly, and smiles a little, looking down at Tony’s face. Her eyes are very blue.
. If you'd like to take a guess as to which species it belongs to, please go ahead. :P
It’s such a relief, sometimes, to just slip away into that warm, soft headspace where Tony can be – just very small and very helpless, but with Steve always there to look after her. Steve is kind and strong and can tell Tony what to do and – and just take charge for a while, and it’s good, so good, and Tony doesn’t know quite how she ever got so lucky as to have Steve, lovely perfect Steve.
When the bell goes, Thor catches them both and slows the swings to a stop. Tony's legs feel funny and wobbly when he tries to stand, but Thor puts a big hand on each of their shoulders, safe and steadying. Darcy flails round and flings her arms round Thor's neck and says, 'Thankyouthankyouthankyou!'
Oh, and Rhodey! And Pepper! Both coming! And both of them have promised not to bring any work along to the party! Tony’s going to tease Pep
It is totally going to be the best ever party. There’s a tree, a really great tree and everyone had helped decorate it together, and Dummy and Butterfingers and You had helped put up tinsel everywhere (even if some of the stuff did end up in weird places like the shower cubicle and inside the microwave). Tony had tried to get Dummy to make punch, too, but Dummy had put machine oil in it, which was a horrible waste and Tony would totally donate that useless bot to a city college except that it was Christmas.
Tony eases awake to quiet singing, low and tender. She’s warm and comfortable and content, resting against soft, naked skin, fingers stroking her hair; and she remembers,
And then Tony starts
Steve looks grumpy every day. He's not talking to Jane at all, because Jane comes over to see Darcy and complains about it. Jane's the kind of person who likes to make friends, but Steve won't talk to her at all, she says.

‘Steve?’ Tony says uncertainly. ‘Steve, where are you – what are you doing?’
‘Really?’ Tony says softly. ‘You –
He hitches his backpack resolutely on his shoulders, and starts trudging towards the big doors.
‘No,’ he whines, and Steve sighs and rubs his chin. Then he shifts forward and puts his hand on Tony’s shoulder, careful but firm, guiding him backwards against the skins. Tony doesn’t want to, but Steve is very strong and very determined, and Tony feels weak and wobbly anyway so he stops resisting, letting himself rest back onto the skins. Steve crinkles his eyes, pleased with him.
When she peeps back up at Steve, Steve's standing there warm and sun-washed and lovely, looking down at Tony with the oddest expression on her face, soft-eyed. And when Tony meets her gaze, Steve just quirks the corner of her mouth up, and reaches out to slide her hand through Tony's hair before she goes.

Tasha’s shouting gleefully, saying that everyone helped to choose it, and Steve is standing tall and looking pleased and proud.
Steve brightens. ‘It was Tony’s idea,’ he tells her, proudly. ‘He’s real good at making stuff. An’ Numbers. An’ everything.’
‘No,’ Tony says, jumping up in relief at having something to do, ‘no, here’s good, really good, I’ll just move these –’ and she pushes and rearranges things on the bench so that there’s a space for the box of flowers. ‘There!’
