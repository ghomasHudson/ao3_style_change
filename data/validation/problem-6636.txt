"Hey," Steve breathed as he stepped inside, smiling at the sight of Tony still curled up in his bed. He leaned in the doorway. "How are you feeling?"
"I slept on the couch," Steve said quietly. "Just so you know, I have somewhere to be in an hour." He glanced down at his phone. "But you're welcome to stay here and sleep, or just... hang out," he finished eventually.
With his tongue sticking out a little in concentration (a habit Steve was aware of but had no control over) he managed to do his tie and tuck it into the waistcoat just fine. Steve glanced up to catch Tony watching. "...Do I look okay?"
"I made my decision a very long time ago, Nat," Steve breathed and then made his way out of the gym.
know you had that spot back here?" asked Tony.  It came out a little more accusatory than he meant it to.  It wasn't like Alphas didn't have scent glands, too, just that theirs weren't hard-wired to any special mating gland.  Theirs were for the sole purpose of enticing omegas and establishing standing with each other. And speaking of establishing standing, how dare Maggie Frond compare Tony to his father.  That shit wasn't fair. He wasn't as dominant, yeah, but who the hell was? Howard Stark had the soul of a dragon.
Gleason's eyes flickered up to Tony's face with amusement. "Please, just use protection. Heats, even induced ones, will cause a spike in fertility."  He rose. "We'll talk about the drinking another time. But considering previous issues with blood toxicity-" Said information had clearly come from Pepper. -"we should keep an eye on that."  He looked to Steve.  "Keep the wound cleaned. Tomorrow you'll want to undress it and give it some air.  With your metabolism it should be healed by the end of the week." He turned back around to face Tony and pointed at him. "No biting it till then, okay? Else you'll risk infection."
Tony nosed Steve's groan again and Steve's dick twitched longingly against his face.  Tony kissed it softly, then glanced up, anxiously.
"Heats can easily make you depressed Steve. And anxious. The heat is messing with your head. I know the real Steve who can't wait to kick more HYDRA ass."
"I had never, ever felt anything like what I felt when you went into heat, Steve," said Tony, still smiling nostalgically.  "I wanted you so bad... you know there's still a dent in his plane from you trying to pull down that door? I was obsessed. I mean, I still am, but-- but before we bonded, all I could think about was you."  He remembered moodily wandering around after Pepper, every third thought about Steve, the way he smelled and moved and spoke and looked. "I dunno what I did to deserve finding you," he said, with uncharacteristic sincerity.  He stretched out to pat Steve's arm.
Tony's work schedule, like his feeding schedule, was erratic.  He worked when inspiration struck him.  Only rarely did inspiration strike at convenient times.
He got up and crossed the room to grab a bottle of Jack from the bar before settling back down to keep pawing through the materials.  He eventually fell asleep, curled up with the bottle and picture of his mother and Ana trying to get him to hold a tennis racket properly.  In the background, a collared omega was chasing a rogue tennis ball, and all four of them were laughing.
Steve woke up early and showered before dressing in gym gear, stuff he could get sweaty in. Knee-length shorts and a tee, along with trainers. He cooked waffles for himself and left some on a plate for Tony before he headed out.  He didn't bother waking his Alpha.  He could think of nothing he wanted to hear from him.
Currently, in fact, Tony was nursing the bottle of single-malt, relaxing back against the pillows.  He wanted to argue more with SHIELD about going up to the lodge but Steve suddenly seemed so down, so tired, and Tony was worried he might be getting sick or something.  He didn't know how heats worked; lots of omegas seemed lethargic in post-heat. Maybe Steve needed to stay home and rest after all. What was the point of hauling him up a mountain if he would be too tired to do anything fun once he got up there?
is, they were all betas.  A thousand, fifteen hundred... fuck, man, maybe even two thousand women.  And they were betas, Steve.  I've probably slept with, like, less than ten omegas and they were all on suppressants.  They didn't act or smell or seem like omegas.  I
There wasn't camps in the forties that he knew of. An omega was an omega and that was that. There was barely any consideration given into the prospect of changing them. After all they were not proper people; they weren't
"He's literally prepared to give you up for one night with another person, and you're still gonna go back to him," Steve deadpanned, offering the water for Tony to drink. "You're an intelligent guy, Donner, smarter than me. You got into
"Because it's true.  He thinks you're a pale substitute and he'd give you up in a heartbeat to live out some sick fantasy with me.  He doesn't love you, Donnie," said Steve firmly.  The words hurt to say.
She turned to glance at them, then did a double-take at Steve.  Alerted by her movements, the man turned as well.
He relaxed, however, only once Steve had moved up.  He closed his eyes at the light, wet touch of Steve's lips on his.
"How hard can it be?" interrupted Tony, throwing a hand up.  "Hold on, let me check--" He covered the phone. "Hey, Steve, is your giant pink dildo dishwasher safe?"
auction, but shouldn't we try to stop all of 'em?  This shit's illegal! And even if it weren't, it's fucked up.  I wanna put
Steve smiled. It was small but sincere. "If you want that," he added.  He wanted to give Tony the opportunity to say no, if for some reason he was inclined to.
"Yay, Steve," said Tony blearily, breaking out of his song to raise his glass.  Pepper snatched it out of his hand.
Steve had just stepped out of the shower and finished changing into clothes he hadn't spent twenty-four hours in.  He looked up at the knocking from his balcony and blinked.
Pepper found a stressed-looking Steve in the living quarters. He was dressed smartly, perhaps a little windblown from his bike ride over, his hair slightly puffed up. His usual perfect appearance was showing cracks. He was pacing with his hands running over his face, clearly trying to calm himself down.
They all stared at the door uselessly. Of course, there was only a sliver of glass they could see through and the only thing that was visible was the metal staircase.
Tony groaned a little.  He reached out without looking to find Steve's waist and put an arm around him.  His earlier ire was melting into affection. Their interview had been a good reminder of just how much he loved Steve and he wanted to hole up in the lodge with him, curl up in front of fire under a blanket with a couple of cups of cider, enjoy the season together.  Forget about charities and PR for a while.
Tony had automatically taken his half of the bed, leaving the other half open for Steve if he wanted it.  But maybe Steve wanted to sleep on the couch. Maybe he didn't want to sleep with Tony anymore, because Tony wasn't as good an Alpha as Bucky and couldn't even mate him properly.  Tony didn't know and so he didn't want to push Steve. He didn't pat the bed invitingly or make any motion for Steve to join him, not wanting to be pushy. Every time he asked anything of Steve, it backfired.  Steve was clearly going to do whatever Steve wanted anyway, so Tony saw no point in directing him. He wasn't dominant enough.
Steve ran the pad of his index finger on the inside of Bucky's wrist, curious to see if he would get a reaction. He tilted his head, blue eyes bright. "I wish you could get closer," he whispered, words leaving his lips before he had a chance to even ponder them.
"Bucky. Bucky, please don't do this. Don't do it. You don't want to-- you don't want to do this!" Steve was screaming. No, he was begging. He didn't care. He didn't care what they thought of him. Fuck, he was close to crying. Because it wasn't just HYDRA doing this to him, it was
Natasha swore and hit the trigger, not willing to waste precious seconds.  Bucky's body immediately convulsed; since he was in contact with Steve, so did Steve, but that was unavoidable collateral damage and Natasha trusted that once they got Steve to the safety of the jet, he'd be okay.  He healed fast; it was most important just to get him out of here.
"When we break open the camps we'll find him," Steve whispered and turned to Tony with a smile. "We'll find him for sure, Tony!"
"Life working for SHIELD is never uneventful," Steve breathed in diplomatic answer and Ty half smiled in understanding.
Tony felt furious.  How dare his body betray him like this.  He was mad at Steve. Steve had tried to kill him, he couldn't trust Steve not to kill him, and Steve had a fucking side fuck, something he hadn't allowed Tony to have.  Steve didn't deserve--
"...but Steve's allowed to go if I'm with him, right?  I mean, we're bonded, I'm his Alpha..." Most modern Alpha-only clubs at least made an exception for bonded pairs.
"Tony's doing well, considering, but it's the twenty-fifth anniversary of... you-know-what, so he's just kind of out of it all the time."
When Steve returned to the bedroom with a cup in hand Tony hadn't moved from his spot. He swallowed, something tugging in his gut. "Hey," he held out the cup. "Why don't I show you what I drew?"
Pepper let out a barking laugh, clearly a stressed sound, and ran a hand through her hair. Steve put a hand on her arm. "I'll make you a coffee," he told her and she shot him a grateful smile. She had a complicated coffee order but Steve still remembered it from being a PA. He had been a good PA and he almost missed it; Pepper had been a good person to work for. It was why so easily they'd fallen into such a good friendship now. Or at least, Steve hoped.  Lately, since his heat, things had felt weird between them.
Tony let out a small, soft sigh of satisfaction and placed both of his hands on Steve's head, spreading his legs and leaning his head over the back of the couch.
Steve knew there was old feelings there. But Bucky coming for him was serious. And yet Tony was more concerned with who Pepper was dating...that said it all, really. Some wake up call it had been, Steve thought. Tony wanted to Steve, so long as he could think about Pepper being his too. Tony must still want a trio, even if he wouldn't say it.  But Steve had been
"As long as it's not cold. I just...I hate the cold." He understood that they didn't have proper linings because they weren't fitted and they were easier to try on. "That's the thing. If you want to pick one for me, I don't want it in the papers when we go to the conference. If it means that much then only you get to see it. Not the whole world." Steve squirmed a little underneath and smiled triumphantly when he heard Tony let out a noise in response.
"Karaoke is the best goddamn thing in the world," said Tony.  He gave Steve a quick peck on the lips and untangled their hands, then gave Steve a friendly slap on the ass.  "C'mon, Sam.  First round's on me.  I got this splitting headache and I thought I was going to throw up but..."
Tony had tuned out somewhat after letting Steve make his own order and gotten distracted.  The lounge rotated and Tony was pretty sure he could calculate their velocity. He was involved with the math when he heard Malick's bit about collars and Steve's bit about going naked.
"No.  Now. if you don't have anything else ground-breaking to say, we should probably head back upstairs."
Mackenzie held Tony's shoulders firmly, guiding him out of the room; Tony was too upset to say any words.  One of the sergeants threw Steve's arm around his shoulders and half-carried, half-dragged him out. Donner waddled after them.
The Alpha had been a very angry man. He was very angry at Steve. Donner wondered what Steve must have done to him. From what he'd seen Steve seemed to make a lot of Alphas angry by simply existing. But Donner didn't understand how he was being landed with all that. He looked like Captain America, he guessed, but he didn't
Steve was quiet for a while. Memories were dancing around in his head and dragging him in and out of reality. None of them really especially good. Steve had been so lucky to end up here, to have made it this far. He almost felt guilty. No other omega from the forties got this chance.
He wasn't sure where he would fit in, considering he'd pretty much invited himself along.  But it didn't matter. The nice thing about the suit was that it was multi-purpose.  It had a ton of features--  the augmented reality in the helmet's HUD would be useful for mapping out the inside of the base -- plus it was capable of brute-forcing its way through anything.  Doors, even walls, didn't really stop it. Nor did bullets, for that matter.
to get in." He paused.  "Unless he's like, a super-genius."  He looked the blond up and down.  "I don't think he is," he added, sounding almost disappointed.
Tony's shoulders sagged.  He'd been so certain... he smushed a piece of potato under his toe miserably.  The other girl, presumably Banjo, rushed over silently with a dustpan to sweep away the mess immediately.
"Right, right, Morgan!  Morgan, this is Stan, he's my new PA... I know, not as cute as Pepper, but damn, look at these guns, huh?" he said, giving Steve's arm a squeeze.  "He's gonna put Stark Industries out of business, am I right?  Here's your drink back, babe--"  He handed her the empty martini glass.  "--make sure you say hi to Rima for me, she's here too... Rima won the title this year--" he informed Steve.  His words were slurring just the slightest bit; he didn't specify which title.  "--not that I'm saying I won you, obviously, you can't win a person, that's not what I'm saying--"  Tony's mind was a three-ring circus, capable of thinking multiple things at once; he had bounced back to the previous topic but a moment later he was rubbing shoulders with another women in impossibly high heels and impossibly blonde hair.
"Sure, absolutely, Cap," said Marcus, reaching up to slap him on the shoulder.  "You did great.  I promise, you'll look good, we'll make sure."
"Director Fury is still trying to call back sir," JARVIS announced. "I believe he's quite concerned.  Also, he seems aware that your power and phone line is working normally."
Pepper reached into her purse to pull out of bottle of Advil.  "No. No. And no," she said, firmly. She reached over to tap the binder.  "Sign."
"We're pretty certain we've identified Karpov as one of the men Steve saw and spoke to," Sam piped up and Fury nodded.
Steve let out a quiet sound as Tony's knot squeezed out. He shivered, feeling a little spent slip out down the curve of his thigh like a claim. "If anyone can handle this, it's us," he murmured in agreement. "We've got this. We really do."
to do this anymore. I didn't ask to be a super-soldier. I just wanted to make a difference in the war! And I did.  We won.  It's over, isn't it? I goddamn died for all you people and you act like I owe you something. Yes. I screwed up. Royally. Sure, you can lord it over me forever, or accept the fact that I 'm an actual human, not just some mascot, and I make mistakes!"
Pepper propped her elbow onto the counter, avoiding the crack, and sipped her wine with an appreciative sigh.  "Stark, Sr., casts a long shadow in this household." She frowned a little. "...you should probably prep Steve for March.  Tony visits their graves. He gets... moody." That was a polite way of putting it; Pepper assumed Aria would know what to do with that information.  "Anything I need to know about his father?" she asked bluntly. She'd been involved for so long in Tony's affairs that she was pretty sure she knew more about him than he knew about himself.  Actually, she was sure of it. Tony didn't know his own allergies (opiates) or blood type (A+) or whether or not he was registered to vote (yes) or dentist's name (Robert Jelicich). Pepper's enormous cache of information was her first line of defense against Tony's precarious hold on his own sanity.  In the last decade she had rarely been caught off-guard; in instances when Tony suddenly discovered something about himself he didn't like, Pepper was usually already prepared to handle it.
Steve went back to swimming, and Tony retired back to his padded lounge chair, lazing in the California sunshine, sipping vodka and orange juice as he watched Steve glide through the water.  There was a tinge of guilt to Tony's admiration. He didn't want to be creepy and objectify Steve; Steve had been through a traumatic experience, after all. But it was damn near impossible not to ogle at him. His body was perfect, after all.  Muscular, but, because he was an omega, still slender and lithe, with little body hair. And then there were those big blue eyes, so expressive...
Steve's expression and voice were so pleasant and gentle he could barely be conceived as rude. His question sounded genuine.
Steve smiled and offered a hand to shake. Katy took it. "It's a pleasure to meet you too, Miss Perry. Are you opening the show?"
It was an oddly intimate moment, when Tony finally looked down at him. Even with those ridiculous sunglasses on. Steve sighed and looked over Tony, over the suit. Did he still have two weeks after spending a night in that thing? Probably not. Steve's phone chimed in his pocket- a text from Natasha, most likely. Or maybe Pepper. But he had a feeling the CEO had lost faith in him somewhat, and with good reason. Considering his CV was mostly lies Steve really had done alright at the whole PA job thing, or so he thought.
Steve was grinning from ear to ear. Oh if this was true it was brilliant. "Happy is one of the nicest people I've ever met. I don't see how he's a six, Tony," he said. "I think anyone would be lucky to have him."
"I promise it's gonna be okay," Steve murmured and pressed a kiss to Tony's shoulder. He didn't know what to do to make him feel better. Right now he just wanted the other to come back to him.  "We don't have to do anything today. We can just stay in and ignore the world. We don't have to answer to anyone. It's just us here," Steve whispered and nuzzled against the curve of his neck gently, staying well away from the scar.
Steve and Tony exchanged a look.  Steve appeared to be in his twenties and Tony, recently turned forty, was showing his age, especially with the hangover.
Tony was trying not to laugh but Steve's silent, mirth-filled vibrating next to him was infectious and he was trying to silently contain laughter too.  It was like being in church; it was funnier because they were trying to suppress it.
Tony dug his fingers into Steve's wrists, thrusting into his wet, silky body lovingly; each twitch of his hips was heaven and he hadn't even sunk the knot in yet.  His eyes were closed and Steve's smell was surrounding him; it was pure bliss.
"JARVIS told me not to worry about on the way over," Steve said. "But I'm keeping it on, it doesn't bother me that much- they know where I live anyway," he pointed out. Clint shrugged.
"No, of course not.  You're better off now than you were when we found you."  Karpov blew a smoke ring. "Myself... I'm bonded to my work.  To you. No program is perfect, of course, but you... you're as close as it gets."  He gave him a sideways look, then reached out to touch his cheek.
He found both women in the kitchen. They were talking quietly to one another. Steve realised he had the PTSD specialist this evening, too... wonderful. It would be a therapy-heavy day.  He couldn't help but wonder how much of SHIELD's concern over him was because he was soldier, and how much of it was because he was an
Tony walked into the room suddenly, hair tousled.  He was wearing a robe but it was open and he seemed entirely unconcerned with his nudity.  He reeked like sex.
He didn't know what the answer was and had decided just to wait.  Steve would come back and Tony would just... follow his lead. That wasn't an ideal solution, but it was the only one Tony could think of, and he stayed up late turning it over and over in his head.
"Hips up," commanded Tony.  He ran his tongue over the silicon to moisten it, not that it was really necessary, and then gently put a hand on Steve's thigh to spread his legs.  He nudged against Steve's entrance with the head of the toy; Steve wriggled sweetly, expectantly. Tony's mouth watered as he pushed it into Steve, watching the length disappear into Steve's glistening hole.
him. And surely he doesn't know, he's...you know, with a load of other Alphas." He grimaced and Steve grimaced in turn. "You'd just think a guy who's that much of a statusist would be hung up on stuff like that."
The director checked his watch impatiently as he tapped his foot just on the other side of Steve's cell.  "...late," he muttered in annoyance, then looked up at Steve and Bucky.  He smiled. "Well, look who's awake. Having fun yet, Captain? ...things are about to get even better.  I'm glad you approve of your new mate. It will make this much easier, no doubt."
Tony honestly wondered at how he managed to stay so in love with Steve.  The average length of a relationship for Tony was a handful of months. And yet, they were ten months into being bonded and... well, there had been that terrible two and half months, and Yemen... but aside from that... aside from that, as they approached a year, Tony still feel a magnetic pull toward his mate.
, fuck, sorry, ow- sorry- oh, God, you broke my dick- no, it's fine--"  Tony wiggled a little, accessing their situation, then wrapped his arms around Steve and rolled over so Steve was on top of him.
And he was damned if he was going to let that son of a bitch, who had stolen his father's arc reactor designs, beat up his naked omega.
He stayed where he was, as far away from Bucky as possible and said nothing more. Steve wasn't sure who was standing in front of him right now; Bucky, the Winter Solider, or someone else entirely?
"Hey there, Stephanie. Just take a seat for me..." Steve remembered her name. Another ex. She was very drunk, bless her. He carefully lead her down into one of the sofas to take a seat and looked over at Rhodey and offered him a nod as the other disappeared after Tony.
Tony felt fear like he'd never felt before coil in his gut.  Suddenly, he was back in Afghanistan, waking up to discover a bandage around his chest, wires trailing away from it, that he'd woken up to some sort of horror movie, that he was in hell-
Steve let out a ragged breath. "Is there anything I can to make it better?" He asked softly, knowing there was nothing he could do to make it actually
Tony swaggered toward the door, rubbing his neck stiffly.  He was becoming obsessed with checking his blood toxicity.  He wanted to check it again before putting on the suit.  But it wasn't like he was going to do any heavy lifting.  He just wanted to strut around for a bit.  People loved the suit; they loved Iron Man.
Trickshot's arm shot out and he grabbed at Steve's arm.  "Don't tell Clint about the rape kit. About any of this.
Tony waited until he had slipped past them and padded away silently down the hall before he looked at Steve.  "Even if you convince him, he'll never be able to say no to Gideon if he shows up. That guy has zero backbone."
tell me Tony Stark's buying?" asked Sixteen eagerly, looking thrilled at the idea of being in a trio with the two of them.
Rex?"  Tony thought Rex seemed pleasant and attractive.  He had a strong jaw and high cheekbones and bright blue eyes.  His smile was bright and his teeth white and straight.
The three of them looked up when the door slammed.  They had been playing cards at the table; Maria was mercilessly destroying the other two.
He wanted to be a good Alpha for Steve and he felt like he was failing.  Steve had been shot at, injured, and Tony hadn't been there to protect him.  Steve had gotten knocked up and then lost it, and somehow, that all felt like Tony's fault, too.
"...you're gonna have to wear turtlenecks for a while," said Tony, cracking a sad grin.  He looked away again.  "...I don't know why you do this to me.  I've never... felt..."  He trailed off.  That was it, that was the problem.  Tony didn't like to feel things.  He liked to do things.  He liked to make things happen.  Intimacy scared the hell out of him.
She managed to set the plates down beside them with glasses of water without really looking. Pepper then went to take Phil his plate of food, leaving it by the edge of the tent. "Phil?" She called over the music. "I've made you food."
Athena was still watching them attentively; she put a finger in her mouth sweetly and smiled at Steve.
my mate. Nothing will change that. Okay? He already took so many years of my life; they were wasted on him. I'm not letting him take you away too," Steve murmured. Maybe he believed Bucky had actually loved him he would have felt differently, but right now all Steve could remember was pity.  "And I'm also not going to let HYDRA use him to hurt us."
clinging to it like a bat, trying to catch his breath, hoping he'd scrambled their sensors for long enough to figure out a plan  He wasn't sure how many drones he was up against. Eight?  Ten?  Minus the one he'd slammed into the roof with.  Not only was he critically outnumbered, but he was also trying to avoid missiles that were being shot at him and probably landing among civilians when they failed to make their mark.  First priority was getting them away from the Expo, away from the crowds.  Away from Steve.  Away from Pepper.  At a glance, Tony was somewhere around Avenue D, which put him west of stage 3 and south of an observation deck, with the Oracle Dome to his right and an excellent jerk chicken joint to his left.
"It's sweet," Steve said, his eyes flicking up to Malick's face, his tone completely sincere. "That you think I'm pretty."
"He wasn't bad to me, but he wasn't good either. I was very sick, it was a difficult time for both of us."
But before Tony could respond Pepper was with them. "We have to get out before the press swarm us," she stated. "Let's get back to the hotel, pronto. We'll give police statements tomorrow. I'm not- Jesus Christ. I'm not dealing with this today."
While he was at it, he should probably look up heats.  The amount of things he didn't know about omegas was vast.  He hoped Clint would be cool enough to explain things to him; it was embarrassing to be forty years old and not have a clue about this.  It would be the equivalent of going to Natasha and asking a bunch of questions about how menstruation worked.
But as much as Tony hated to be vulnerable, he'd decided already to pursue this.  He was, after all, a scientist, and curiosity drove him.  Besides, he had nothing better to do.  Pepper was running the company now.  The Expo was going smoothly.  Rhodey and the rest of the US government were probably tearing the suit Rhodey had taken to pieces and arming it, maybe slapping on a new coat of paint.  Everything was turning its gears, marching steadily forward, into the future, and it was all happening without Tony.  Tony rarely had the opportunity to be as not busy as he was now.  Besides, the crushing feeling he'd felt after kicking Steve out had been torture.  An agony worse than death.  He sure as hell wasn't going to try it again.  He didn't want to be separated from Steve.  He wanted to explore Steve and Steve's life and if he got hurt, at least he wouldn't have any regrets about not traveling down that particular road of inquiry.
"...listen.  I knew Howard back when you were still a baby.  He'd cooled off a lot by his fifties. He wasn't a bad person.  But his views were old-fashioned. In his time, omegas weren't people and he had a hard time seeing them like that, especially since he kept two of 'em as servants."
Steve groaned when he heard his mobile ringing. Tony was asleep on top of him and soft inside of him. Gently, Steve rolled them over and then pulled off Tony, pressing a kiss to his cheek and wincing himself at how sensitive he felt.
"Do you mind?"  The young man offered his phone to Steve.  He and Tony both threw up Tony's signature peace sign.  There was a pause.
"My sweet omega," murmured Tony longingly, looking into Steve's eyes.  Steve was blushing, looking uncharacteristically bashful; Tony closed his eyes and nuzzled his cheek, burying himself into Steve, his hips stuttering as he climaxed.  "
Steve looked lost.  As Tony's PA, he hadn't actually needed to do much with Twitter; Tony thoroughly enjoyed Twitter and ran his own account, much to the chagrin of his PR team.
. All the Alphas you think are more dominant than you, I assure you nearly all of them couldn't push through what you did Tony. I've met dozens of POWs in my life time. I've never met anyone whose carried on living like you do. I don't love despite all these scars you have; I love you
Steve ordered the tagliatelle, meatballs and something to do with mozzarella. That and a mocktail that the waiter would apparently make up himself and promised would be delicious.
He pulled down his gown to offer her a nipple; Tony actually did end up vomiting, grabbing the bin by the door and retching into it dramatically.
"I let Clint know when and where we're landing," Steve told Trickshot as they settled down for take off. "So he should meet us there."
He finally moved to begin to eat, chewing on a piece of bacon slowly as he watched Tony flop into bed. Steve's heart hammered in his chest.
"Fire him.  Get me a new one," demanded Tony.  "Don't care if it's not politically correct.  I can't work with an omega.  I'm not my father."  His whole body was shaking.  He couldn't take this.  He was having a breakdown in front of Pepper, of all people, his best friend, the one woman in the whole world he'd give anything for... and for what?  Some blond he met ten days ago?  Just because of how he smelled?
Finally, around eleven-thirty, Rhodey had had enough.  It was close enough to midnight and he was bored to tears.
"No, you don't, you're just in heat," said Natasha with practiced patience, shoving the folder and the box into Steve's hands.  "Rogers. Listen to me. Focus on me for a second. Some of the information in there is going to be tough to digest. There's a picture of his arm.  So just... prepare yourself before you open it, okay?" She tapped the box. "SHIELD doesn't know about this. Let's keep it that way. Clint? You ready to go?"
Unlike her brother, she was wearing a heavy coat and a hat; her hands were buried deep in her pockets.  Perhaps because of the thickness of the coat and the fur collar, or the loose hair sticking out of the hat, she looked younger than Steve remembered.  Like a high school kid.
He was supposed to be sleeping now.  But he was aroused and it was proving to be impossible to ignore.
His own cock was pulsing deliciously against Steve's leg and he was trying not to orgasm before Steve because the idea of doing so made him feel a little bit pathetic (he was giving a blowjob, not receiving one, after all), but admittedly, the feeling of Steve clenching wetly around his fingers was driving him crazy.
"Omegas are stronger instincts than we do, you know.  They're less people then we are... arguably, just as we're less human than betas.  Because we are products of our biology, driven to obey our urges without rational thought."
"...ouch," said Clint jokingly.  He looked over at Steve, expression more serious.  "I wanted to show you what I'm protecting. And... since everyone is shitting all over you for having multiple bonds... I wanted to show you that it's okay, I guess.  That--"
Tony was so lost in thought, his mind taking him back to dark places and shadowy caves, that he almost missed Steve's words.
He kicked at the door twice and it swung open. Steve stepped into the room. And a second later a plate was thrown at his head. Steve ducked (thank you, super serum reflexes) and it smashed against a wall.
Steve stole a few hours himself.  Then he showered, sorted through his emails, and got dressed.  Today it was black dress pants with a white shirt and a blue waistcoat on top.  That was the general style for omegas; waistcoats.  Back in the forties Steve had never had the money, he was always poor and Bucky had always struggled to just scrounge together rent.  Now he had the money and as Tony Stark’s omega assistant, he was expected to dress the part.
He'd seen old pictures in the twenties and thirties and forties of Alpha and omega pairs standing like this, the omega's cheek pressed into the other's leg, eyes closed, face a picture of contentment.  Or gazing up adoringly at their Alphas, sometimes with the Alpha gazing down protectively at them.
The effects of the previous day's work were evident the moment Tony stood up.  He groaned, muscles stiff and cramped. He stretched and his joints popped, especially the right shoulder he'd dislocated so many times in the past.  He looked at the note again; Steve's handwriting was small and neat and old-fashioned. No doubt, thought Tony with a stab of annoyance, that Steve was probably working out again.
A camera operator gave Steve a wave, pointed to the camera ("Look right here"), then held up a hand.  "Okay, we're going live in thirty."
"Excellent question! The best position is probably the omega on his or her side and the Alpha behind them. I know it can get uncomfortable but it's important to hold it for as long as you can, even over night! This especially helps with male omegas who struggle with conception more generally. Staying together over night boosts your average chances from around 3% to 15%!"
"Okay," said Tony quietly, trying to think of something to ask.  "First of all... there's no one else, right?  You don't have any
Steve was weakly clawing at him.  Tony took his hand gently in his gauntlet and Steve, who was already shivering, shuddered harder at the touch of the cold metal.  "You're okay... just relax. Come on, relax. It's over, we're going home right now, we completely the mission and everything, you did great... drink that water... in a few hours we'll be home, okay?  Just a little while longer..."
"Cher and Sting are singers.  Oh, wait, no, actually, Ellen DeGeneres, never mind," said Tony, snapping his fingers as he remembered her last name.
Part of the reason she was involving herself so heavily with Steve's return was that she didn't entirely trust Aria to remain unbiased.  Aria was younger and more political and had been raised by a pair of omegas; Pepper was running damage control. Even Steve's outfit was a calculated move.  Omegas often wore waistcoats only; Pepper wanted him in a jacket for maximum respectability, and felt that a waistcoat only would seem too submissive and obsequious.
Tony gritted his teeth and squeezed his eyes shut.  "Shit. What did Steve say to tell you...? Emily, you are beautiful. You were born exactly the way you were supposed to be and that you can do whatever you goddamn want to and anyone who says otherwise can go to hell."
"I'll do it. It's fine. I get why they want me to sing. If I can take down a extremist Nazi regime in the forties then I can sing on a goddamn stage, and if I make a fool out of myself, I'll handle it.  It's for a good cause, right? Although, I do refuse to sing
"Where's Tony? Where did he go?" Pepper demanded cutting him off, her eyes wide as a suit flew past them. It was quick but Steve saw a flash of red- it was Tony, not Rhodey. The crowd, once jubilant, was now stampeding in every direction without any clear idea of where to go; they simply wanted away from the main stage, where the armed sentinels, once standing stock-still in tidy ranks, were now abandoning, clanking away in every direction, their motives unclear.
Tony swung out of bed and hurried into the main room, excited to know when Steve had found the time to let someone paint an American flag on his perfect stomach.
sounded like it would be hilariously inappropriate, so Tony strode off to go check it out.  If it sucked, he could go get some chow and maybe hang out around the vendor hall chatting up businessmen who supported this kind of bullshit.  Tony had already IDed several people and companies he would no longer allowed Stark Industries work with. Pepper would be that weird mixture of delighted and infuriated, no doubt.
"Tony?" Steve said softly after an hour has passed. There was snow in Tony's hair, stark white against the chocolate brown. "It's getting cold out."
Tony felt nothing but relief when Steve stopped and actually listened.  He began swaying in Tony's arms and Tony nuzzled his chest encouragingly.  He hadn't done ecstasy in years and he'd forgotten the incredible rush. Steve's body was warm and solid against his, his smell familiar and amazing.  He touched Steve's cheeks, his arms, his neck, smelling him, tasting him, kissing him. Steve melted beneath the touch and the two of them were soon making out like teenagers.
The crowd erupted in laughter.  Suddenly, there was Steve, grabbing for the microphone.  Tony slung an arm around him.  The metal was icy on Steve's skin, and impossibly heavy.
beautiful," Steve said, one hand wrapped around the pot of the orchid carefully. He wanted to keep Clint and Natasha's orchid, but that was about it. The rest, aside from the ones Tony had set aside, were essentially from strangers. It would feel weirder to keep them all than to get rid of them.
There was a crack of bone; Tony leaned into the gutter and vomited.  It was like Cuba all over again, when Tony had watched Steve effortless break a guy's leg, his face hard wand remorseless.
Steve almost jumped when both the girls essentially began feeling him up. Maria squeezed his arm and Joan put a hand on his chest. "Oh my! It's
Tony tugged Steve's hand impatiently.  "Can you drive?  I'm crashing," he said.  "Bye, Romanov.  Thanks no thanks for the fucking awful trip.  Seriously, what the hell is wrong with SHIELD?"
"Whatever you want." He rocked his hips forward. Steve's tone dropped to something lower. "I wanna be good for you."
His mouth flooded and he choked, swallowed about half, then pulled off and gagged the rest into the sand.  Oh, fuck he could taste it.
"Oh... Oh, God, Captain--" blurted Tony without thinking.  "Yes-- Captain-- oh, fuck, yes, God-- you gonna take it-- you gonna take what I give you?"
than before. Steve smelt right now. His neck looked right. Bucky was in cryo...and they'd suitably screwed up the Alpha conference. They'd done good, for other people and themselves.  The things in life that had been nagging at them were getting resolved, slowly by surely.
anyone else at the moment, just Steve, and he wanted to enjoy their time together in these early days of their bond.
"Good morning, sir," said Jarvis, hurrying in.  Tony was digging through the cabinets, his hair sticking up in all directions.  "Let me do that, for you, sir, please.  Go ahead and sit."
Tony looked over at Steve.  He assumed Steve had gotten most of that.  Super-hearing and all. "Do you-- do you think he could be alive?"
Tiberius frowned.  "...yes, well... that's true.  It was nice to meet you, Captain."  He stuck out a hand for Steve, then offered it to Tony.
And that was how Steve ended up taking a selfie with Georgina and her mother, the sun glinting in the corner and the blue of the sea behind them. Ian (the parent) asked if he could upload it on Twitter and Steve said sure, why not?  He couldn't recall Aria or anyone else telling him he wasn't allowed to take pictures with his fans, and besides, what was the harm?
Steve half-slept through the drive back and stumbled when they got out of the car. It felt good to see the house though, to just be
He glanced up.  He was looking into a mirror.  His eyes were wide.  His skin was pale.  He had a beard.  He was wearing a vintage t-shirt, from '78.  His lucky shirt.
"It's not a hair donation charity, is it?" asked Tony, tearing open another card.  He skimmed it and placed it in the "normal" pile.  The next letter, addressed to Captain America, was a plea not to trust the government, pointing out that jet fuel couldn't melt steel beams.  Tony put that in the "crazy" pile.
Steve didn't know why he headed outside. It was automatic. He'd seen Bucky out here in the front yard once. His therapist put his hallucinations down to PTSD, but even Steve couldn't deny what Banksy had said. The bond was strong, whether anyone liked it or not. Steve had a connection with Bucky that was unheard of for most bondmates.
Tony had never especially cared for babies.  Granite was no different. Everyone was ogling over her like she was special, but frankly, Tony felt she looked a little weird.  Maybe it was because she was only recently birthed, but Tony felt her eyes were too googly and her head had a weird shape and she was too blue.
Tony pointed to the desk in the room.  Steve's flowers were there, along with the three letters.  "Hey, you didn't open up your other two pieces of fanmail. ...you're not already sick of being loved and adored, are you?"
"Oh, and if you call Natasha Dark Angel in front of her again I cannot promise that you will survive the experience," Steve warned with a grin, blue eyes glinting. He could see her face already. She would be mildly impressed but try to play it down in order to not feed into Tony's ego. Clint would find it funny. She would probably insist on teaching Steve a language Tony didn't know in order to talk privately again... it could become a messy cycle very easily. Especially considering that Natasha knew ten languages, probably.
Alpha, Captain?  He's still alive, isn't he?  What's the nature of your current relationship with him, given his age and Stark's previous reaction to discovering you two were still bonded?"
"...there's no way for us omegas break bonds, I'm afraid, that anyone knows," Gleason said sympathetically.
..."  He wiggled again but it didn't matter.  Tony's knot was too big at the moment. "This is Pepper's fault, I
"Me?  Competitive?  Nonsense," said Tony.  He grabbed a passing stagehand.  "Hey, can I get a cup of crushed ice?  These stage lights get me crazy hot. ...I can't wait to get up to the lodge, we're due for a bunch of snow, it's gonna be great."
"Hey, man, can you talk?  Can you say something?  ...do you think he's homeless?  Maybe some kids beat him up.  Hey, man, come on, what's your name, bro?"
Rhodes watched with silent interest; Corrine brought him a beer and he took a long drink from it, watching Tony.  He'd know Tony for twenty-five years and he had never heard that tone from Tony before.  Not while he was sober, anyway.  He'd heard Tony come close when he was drunk and talking about Pepper, or drunk and talking about cars.  Seeing Tony sober and unabashedly sappy was... weird.  Rhodes had seen Tony act weird a lot of times; he'd seen him high on ecstasy and high on cocaine, too drunk to stand and too sleep-deprived to string together a coherent sentence; he'd seen Tony in the hours immediately following his escape from Afghanistan, seen him after violent break-ups and after Obadiah's death.  But seeing Tony like this, seeing him
"How's it going Steve? The pictures look great, right? Have you seen the ones with you and Trace out on the pool? Stunning!" Alexis beamed, patting Steve on the arm. He was a lot less touchy-feely kind of guy.
The pile of mail had more than doubled.  There were letters, packages, cards, manila folders, plus dozens of flower arrangements (myrtle, lavender, honeysuckle-- all of them obnoxiously fragrant) and several live orchids, the traditional bonding symbol.
T'Chaka beamed at the approval. "In Wakanda we believe that the stronger the omega, the stronger the bond. We appreciate the kind of example you set, Captain."
Pepper let out a noise of protest; Aria was already trying to shoo Steve toward the stairs to get him dressed.  The fact that he was already dressed didn't matter; she was going to go over inch of him to make sure he was presentable.
...Taylor Swift.  Right. The omega pop girl who had “tweeted” at Steve.  So that was Aria’s big surprise.
"If we did, we'd both go insane," said Tony.  "I'm here to pick up Malick's dry-cleaning. Any idea if there's an in-house service?"
Steve was pleasantly surprised by Tony's version of events. They weren't entirely true, no but it still an oddly romantic tale. Sure, they left out Steve's deception, Tony nearly dying, his first heat, Tony slapping his ass on the plane and Steve resisting the urge to accidentally break his wrist...but he didn't bring those things up. He wouldn't. Tony's story was cute and in the end the truth was embedded in it. They fell in love, does it really matter how? Steve squeezed back against Tony's fingers in a silent approval, blue eyes a touch softer than  they had been before. He figured he probably looked a little love sick.
Tony took a few seconds to breathe heavily and collect himself before he went back in.  He couldn't be anxious. No.  No signs of weakness; not in front of Steve.  Steve needed him to be strong.  Steve needed him to be a pillar of strength.  And Tony loved him, loved his omega deeply, primally. He had to; he couldn't lose, couldn't disappoint, not again.
Steve woke up with a start. He was sitting in the living room in Happy's gym gear, his back against the glass window behind him. The tulips were on the table on their side. He got up quickly, his hands shaking. "JARVIS? JARVIS, who's on the property?" he asked, words heavy in his mouth. He needed some water.
"There's a lot of things I should Google," Steve pointed out as he got into passenger seat as Tony did the driver’s. He would have to drive the bike back separately after this to make sure it got home. For some reason he didn't like the thought of it out in a SHIELD base. "They just wanted me to come in about the Winter Soldier, remember? I don't know why they asked for you, too, but they did." Steve hoped it wouldn't be with Fury. He had an awful feeling the director might use this to try and undermine their relationship. Or something. He didn't know.
Tony took his time undressing, watching Steve hunched up on the bed, tense, refusing to budge.  Tony wondered, idly, how long he'd stay like that if Tony just walked away. An hour? Two hours?  Longer?
But that wasn't really what Steve wanted, was it?  He cringed every time Tony touched his neck. Tony hadn't realized he was treated Steve so delicately, but he was only doing it because he didn't want to hurt him.  Did that make him a bad Alpha, to not be selfish? To worry about Steve's well-being?
Tony had not expected Steve to come back; thankfully, he was busy when Steve appeared.  He heard him first, and could smell the faint after-smell of his heat, but his eyes and hands and mind were focused on the circuit board in front of him.  He was wearing torn jeans and a wifebeater; he'd woken to a terrible, burning throb in his chest and retired to his shop as quickly as possible to check his blood toxicity.  Vanko's words floated up again:
America.  You showed them that already.  You and me, and SHIELD... we're all gonna kick some ass, okay?  They surprised you once but that's not going to happen again."
No.  He'd knelt.  That went beyond "being nice."  Steve had knelt and pressed his face into Tony's leg, and Tony had stroked his hair.... and then fucking Coulson had ruined it.
repeated Bucky, looking completely and utterly lost.  Arguably, it was a sign of progress that he had an expression of confusion instead of his usual thousand-yard stare.
"Goddammit," Steve muttered. He saw Tony on the bed and felt a renewed sense of need. He should really, probably be worried about this, the odd episodes of blindness during his heat, but right now all Steve wanted to do was straddle his mate.
"I'm just happy what we'll be doing next week.  And happy that you'll be able to do it with us, Steve," said Tiberius, patting Steve's wrist.
The morning of the security council meeting Steve was actually kind of excited. He couldn't wait to be free of the stupid ankle monitor. He dressed in dark jeans and a white shirt and his new jacket (which he would probably be wearing for the next week straight. He really liked it.)
"Fine. Jeez. We can get food and some cigarettes  if only to stop you from complaining, but then we have to get on the move, Buck," Steve sighed and leaned against the side of the car, watching him. For a moment they were back in the forties again, arguing behind enemy lines whilst Falsworth poured over maps. Except this was a different century and Steve was helping a wanted criminal escape.
"Steve, I... I don't fuck around with women 'cause you aren't good enough.  You're good enough, Steve. You're better than good enough. You deserve better than me.  I'm a bad Alpha. I fuck around with girls because... because it helps me not think... and to feel normal... because..."
"Technically," Fred said. "But they all think they'll do better by it, you know? In this world you have to be  mated to get places."
Tony nodded.  "Guess it does," he agreed.  He felt a lump form in his throat at the thought of losing Steve.  Of going back to a life of opulent parties without meaning.  His grip on Steve's hand tightened a little.  "Please excuse me," he said with uncharacteristic politeness, and turned to where Steve was chatting up the president and his wife.
would love for all their bondmates to be hanging out with good old out-of-control Cap." He was clearly tickled at the idea. Steve hadn't been looking to throw himself out there so soon but Malick had sent them those tickets himself. He'd made it
Steve kept his movements quick and quiet, finding storerooms full of chemicals and dusty, archived files, but no actual personnel or labs yet. It was almost unnerving. And he had this great sense of the weight above of him, pressing down... they were god knows how far underground. Even the air felt different... like it was musty, old. Steve didn't like it. He'd spent too much time in bunkers in the forties to feel comfortable here.
," said Lila, pointing to the back of the dinosaur's neck and then hitting Natasha over the head with it.  Natasha winced a little but made no move to remove the child from her shoulders. She had an expression on her face that Steve recognized.  It was the same one Tiberius had gotten when holding one of the Walker babies.
"Don't worry, I have no self-control.  We'll probably be hate-fucking a half-hour from now," said Tony breezily, taking a drag from the cigarette.
support Steve if he wanted to drink a bunch, but his words died on his lips as the two of them walked down to the living room.
Tony's touch was grounding. Steve let himself be pulled along, ignoring the camera. They were in a pub for godsake; couldn't people just leave them alone?
Both of them understood that, bond or no bond, Avenging would always come first.  Perhaps it was this understanding, more than anything, that solidified their bond.
Steve trailed his fingers over a few of them and felt a sudden urge to draw them.  They were geometrically fascinating.
"--and this is Joan, one of our legal consultants-- we have a sort of impromptu office in this tent-- they're working right up to the cuff, but we're ready to serve the warrant and get in there-- everyone's getting a camera to document what we see-- this is Bo, he's on our press release team, he'll be controlling the media; we do expect a big break so he and Larry will have their hands full with beating back the reporters while we try to get this thing sorted out."
It was probably on all the forms the security council made his sign, but Steve still felt he had a right to be offended at the invasion of privacy.
A rush of footsteps stormed past their door. Steve lifted his head up and moved his hands to cup Bucky's cheeks. "SHIELD is here and you have to decide what you're going to do." It had to be his team. No one else would have found this godforsaken base in the middle of nowhere.
But the moment Steve's lips were on his he forgot about all of that.  Steve's was a familiar flavor, and Tony reacted to it automatically; one hand went to his waist and the other to his smooth, strong jaw, and he pushed into it eagerly.  He'd forgotten the crowd and he couldn't hear them anymore; his world had shrunk into only Steve.
On the way to the airport, Steve pulled in his phone and, when he turned it on, discovered a new series of texts.
Maybe it was fake-out.  Maybe they weren't the same person and that scientist had been trying to mess with Steve's head.  But it was difficult to mess with someone's head while your leg was being broken and Tony was starting to worry Steve had been right all along, about them being the same person.  If that was the case, Tony considered himself well and properly fucked.
George was tipsy, his head leant against the window. Steve sighed. They hadn't managed to say goodbye to Banksy; the guy had been impossible to find.
"Is this really supposed to scary?" Steve asked, sounding unconvinced after twenty minutes of friendly bickering and filming of a car journey and cabin room. "Because I dunno..."
Tony's dander went up.  He had only met one acer in his entire life, Sam, and while he liked Sam, being accused of being an Alpha who liked other Alphas hit him hard.  "I'm wearing this collar 'cause I don't have anything to compensate for," said Tony coldly. "I'm bonded to Steve fuckin' Rogers. If that makes me a weak Alpha, then I don't know whose neck I'd have to bite to be considered a strong one."
It kinda hurt to disappoint him, but this was reality.  Steve was no better than anyone else.  He was just as brutal and violent as Tony or anyone else.
"Yes.  Yes, they are," agreed Tony, running his hands up and down Steve's forearms soothingly.  "But you can't break the rules or you'll get us kicked out, and we have to be here at least long enough for the auction.  We have to help the omegas here, Steve. We can't give them an excuse to kick us out and that's what you're doing. Why the hell were you running off, anyway?  Because of Gideon and Hammer fighting over that guy who looked like you? ...look, that was before they even
"Yeah," agreed Tony.  He could feel the stirrings of a headache from too much alcohol and physical exertion combined with not enough water.
They both had an unintentional lie in. Steve woke around eleven, bleary-eyed and sleepy still as he pushed himself up with a yawn. He stretched out like a cat, back curving before he turned over to look at Tony. The man was sleeping soundly, looking better than he had since Steve saw him by his bedside in the med bay. He smiled a little and reached out to grab his sketchbook from the bedside table. It was where he'd left it. Steve went to grab a pencil too when his hand twitched in pain. Suddenly, it felt cold and his fingers throbbed at the tips. Steve frowned and flexed his fingers once, twice. The feeling slowly returned. Maybe it was phantom pains from his frostbite again.
Tony stared at her for a moment.  "...are you done with that vodka?" he asked finally, reaching for the bottle her hand was on.
"I don't mind bunking with James if room is tight," said Sam, throwing a devilish grin toward Rhodey.  Rhodey was able to smile back at him.
Banksy shuffled over to the coffin and set a hand on it, his other hand gripping a wrinkled sheet of paper tightly.
whether or not they want to be... shot at by Nazis," said Tony haltingly, realizing immediately after he said it how stupid he sounded.  Oh, boy. He was drowning.
Steve stared down at where they were joined together. It didn't look like they'd be able to pull apart within the next ten minutes and certainly not without hurting each other. Steve huffed out a soft breath and ran a hand down Tony's bicep, squeezing gently. "I'll grab a quick shower before I go downstairs; pretty sure I'll stink of sex," he murmured. And he really didn't want to subject Brennan, or whoever the other person, was to that.  "Also, no taping. And definitely
Also he felt like a fucking idiot for not being able to tell they were pair-bonded.  Although, in his defense, before puberty, you just didn't notice that stuff, and Tony's father had died when he was sixteen, so he could be forgiven for not noticing that the guy was bonded.
"Most people rise before noon, sir," said JARVIS.  Tony had forgotten how damned contradictory the program could be sometimes.
Steve sighed softly, swallowing down a lump in his throat. He hated to admit it but he was nervous. v He wished they didn't have to do this. His mark(s) might not have even settled yet and it might be impossible to tell still. They could be getting themselves worked up over nothing. "Okay," Steve let out a shaky breath. "Let's do this."
sorry, Steve," whispered Tony back conspiratorially.  "I didn't meant to mark you, I just got caught up... I'm not saying I'm one of those douchey Alphas that goes all feral and takes omegas, I'm just saying I-- I didn't mean to, I'm kinda drunk-- not that being drunk is an excuse, either--"  He laughed nervously and ran his fingers through his hair.  "Wow, okay, I... I sound like a moron, I sound like an asshat, I'm sorry.  If Pepper were here she'd-- you know, she's very into omega rights, she doesn't know how hard it is... I'm sorry, are you... are you going into heat again? I shouldn't be here."  He rose, took a wobbling step forward, and grabbed the couch to stabilize himself.
Tony had made the three appointments to the jewelers alone.  He had dismissed Bulgari immediately after arriving and being told by a pleased Alpha that it was "about time" that he began "teaching that omega his place."  He hadn't liked any of the collars from Yurman or Hermès, going back to Cartier in the end and custom ordering a collar. He got a lot of raised eyebrows when he demanded it be finished within the week, and even more raised eyebrows when he ordered two collars in two different sizes.
"Okay, folks, listen up!  We're serving the warrant at 6:30 sharp!  Once we've done that, you can all go in, but let's be clear here:
"And who says I'm giving you a blow job, huh Tony?" It was a feat in itself that Steve managed to say the phrase and his cheeks not turn a tinge darker. He was already getting excited himself, seeing Tony like this and the hype from the interview...  "I want you inside of me," Steve murmured, voice low in Tony's ear.
"They're... vouching for me?" Steve repeated. "I don't deserve these people," he shook his head. "I really don't. They're too good to me."
him, Tony was gone, lost in ecstasy in a way he'd previously thought was only obtainable through heavy drug use.
"The worst," agreed Steve.  "...the party's really important to Tony and besides, they already ordered the ice sculptures.  I'd hate to send those ice sculptures back."
Every man in the room was staring at him.  The man who'd been swiveling in the chair had dropped his pencil.
Tony huffed but swung out of bed and stood there naked, arms crossed over his chest.  The arc reactor in the middle of his chest glowed on. Steve, like Tony, had gotten used to sleeping with a light on.
Also I want to reassure everyone that before we go back to our regularly scheduled drama and angst, the party is lots of happy fluff, which I suspect we'll all need post-Infinity War.
"I can't believe she actually said the word clientele! It's like they're not even putting on a face anymore," Ian said, laughing quietly in despair. He shook his head. "I wonder how these 'clientele' choose from the omegas. Maybe they hold meetings, or events--"
"Tony!  Here!" Sam gestured.  Tony pushed back his faceplate and examined the discreet grey box on the wall.  "...is that what you want?" asked Sam.
After getting the meeting with MI-13 out of the way, they were left to their own devices.  Tony let Steve take over the rest of their itinerary, having already seen all that he really cared about seeing.  They spent long, cold, rainy days in Piccadilly Circus, taking pictures with groups of Japanese tourists, and went to view the Crown Jewels, getting accosted by more fans and signing autographs.  It was lazy and relaxing; they spent most of their time holding hands.
"I stood up for him!" Steve insisted. "Now, if anything, they going to talk about how I kneel for Tony in public." Aria gave him a confused look. "It happened one. At the conference. It was an accident."
to be a secret meeting," Steve murmured. "I thought it would be our chance to...work stuff out, you know? For the sake of SHIELD we need to get on better, me and Nick, and I thought this was just a casual meeting.  Well... if anything good came out of it, maybe now we finally will... we both saved each other's asses. Maybe that counts for something. I don't know.  And why wouldn't HYDRA want me?" Steve sighed. "They want the serum, remember?"
anything but they don't like it. Shit. I'm- I'm sorry..." She shook her head and sighed, rubbing at her temple with her free hand. Aria looked tired. She didn't have any eyeliner on today. It made her look younger. "I just worry about this so much. It would be so much easier if Steve wasn't bonded, no offense...I know him well enough now. He's a squishy one. If this goes south he won't recover and I'll be out of a job. He'll go full-time soldier. Bye-bye rights movement. Bye-bye charity. This could be huge and it's all just resting on...
