Keeping manage of twins kept the husbands busy trying to keep up with who was changed and who wasn’t at first, but after two weeks of working hard, they had a schedule. Tony would take one of the twins down to the lab and rock them while working on blueprints. Steve would take the other to the gym in the portable crib.
Jessica shook her head. “No. Luna’s real name is Luca Lovegood. She was taken away from her parents for doing an illegal sex reassignment.”
Violet looked sighed. “Peter I can’t do patrol today. I still have to recover, and I have to stay late at school. I’m sorry I can’t do both.”
Steve smiled and accepted the glass knowing this is all they were going to be drinking until the kids turned twelve, maybe twenty if he could get Tony to dislike drinking, but who was he kidding. Tony, loved to drink.
“I’m sorry we made you feel like that,” Tony told her and got up walking to her and kneeled. “C-can I hug you? Is that weird?”
Wanda, Vision, Sam, and Rhody began helping civilians into the Federal Hall where the fundraiser was being held. Thor and Dr. Strange were looking for the source of the wormhole.
Tony leaned into Jarvis and sighed catching his breath. “Don’t tell them about this. Or any of the other times I’ve done it. I wanna tell Steve later.”
Luna spoke as she put the ring on Peter. “I’m a good pretender. I can pretend to laugh and smile. Pretend to be happy, but with you, I don’t have too. I don’t fake a smile or force a laugh. I can play around and be who I am. Tony always told me to fall in love with a person who enjoys my madness. Not an idiot who forces me to be normal. Who the hell wants normal. I’m glad you don’t. I vow never to be normal, but to always love you in our own Mad Hatter way.”
The neighbourhood though, was less than desirable. Tony was sure the group of men downstairs were planning on mugging him on his way out of the complex later. Good luck with that.
"Where?" Tony finally speaks, and immediately slaps himself on the forehead, regretting his own betrayal.
Thankfully for the nerve-struck genius, Steve’s face was still planted on the pillow, facing the other way.
Steve ran his fingers through his wet hair, flexing his arm as he did and hooked one thumb on the fold of the towel. Steve had always felt awkward in his new body, never truly comfortable to put himself on display like that. Regardless of the fact that he was a beautiful man physically; his broad shoulders were evenly symmetrical, his torso was shredded, abs sculptured.
She kisses Tony gently on the apples of his cheek. "I know you are hurting, I know what happened - Siberia - it was brutal. You came home looking worse for wear but I'd lie if I said I've never been more scared in my life. Because, you know. Nuke?
"I know. I know I left," he whispered, begged. "I know I have no right to, to do this. I can't help it."
In saying that, it was one thing for the Captain to have perfect recollection of events down to the a T. It was another, to have said memories reoccurring in flashbacks and projecting themselves unprompted -solid and clear, in sound taste and flesh - every waking moment like a broken record.
"Right. Of course. You're a junior this year. Okay so how do I say this. The Accords and Siberia are a whole different clusterfuck of issues, I did things I'm not proud of, Cap did things... We went to town against each other because I was a raging lunatic. I went overboard and well, I've got a truckload of issues, kid, you really need  to reconsider your choice of role models. We'll get to that someday. This though," Tony spins the phone on the smooth metal surface. "I wanna talk about this.
," Tony starts to think, but decides against it. "Wow I can't believe how hard this is," He mutters lowly to himself before forcing himself to look Peter in the eye again. He really wasn't just
All he remembers before everything went dark, hardly a breathe left in his lungs, was hearing his name being called out by various voices, but one stood out from the rest. He remembers his head being cradled, held closely by strong arms. The heat radiating from the skin that touched his was unmistakable, the scent as fresh as the ocean.
Steve's blue eyes flutter down to Tony's brown eyes, pupils blown, then to Tony's fingers moving in and out of him. He was mesmerised by the sight, no more than he was enjoying his prostate being hit over and over again. But Steve was floating. Sentences were not forming in his head as he drowned in arousal at a new height, so he mewled the magic words.
Whenever he visited, he spent a good amount of time within the household. Tony got some elbow grease in, fixing whatever mechanics that needed repairing or improvement. The kitchen, the barn. He did some wood work, but could never seem to bring himself to finish his pile. It was an inner struggle, rather than a physical one. Tony would rather admit it was his physical injuries, even his
Steve was half way gone when Tony pulled off and jerked Steve's erection to take a breather. His free hand began to unbutton his own jeans and he kicked them off at record speed, in preparation for the big event. Tony reached out to his discarded jeans and dug into its backpocket; Steve then hears a small pop and swallowed.
Stephen doesn't answer and just circles his sling-ring and the orange-rimmed portal vanishes, leaving the bedroom dark again.
Sam’s words made Steve clasp the device with both his hands and rests his head against them, elbows on his knees.
He looks at her, as though also seeking answers. "Tony he," Steve starts to say, but stops himself. "I guess
“I’d love to Tony. I’ll uh I’ll be right there. Let me get dressed first?” He said, now his turn to be sheepish, aware that he was still in the battle gear he wore for their training session that took place before the brief.
Steve licked his wounds by burying himself with work. If the Captain was not scheduled on back to back missions, Steve spent his time tracking the globe with Sam for Bucky Barnes. If he was really free, he'd visit Peggy in London to reflect how far he's come since Erskine's serum.
"I hope that's ready." She points her manicured finger to his chest, resting the tip at the centre where it hits a glowing, hard surface.
. Can we not talk about this?" Steve huffs, embarrassment creeping up his cheeks. He bows his head and twiddles the phone between his dextrous fingers.
Peter's eyebrows shot up, completely taken by surprised that Tony was directly making a reference of the former Avenger leader.
Tony checks his hair in the mirror before responding. "What the hell do you do here all day anyway after we kicked the purple prune's ass? Luring monsters and ghouls down the storm drains of the mystic world with your magical doodads?"
"Fuck," escapes Tony's mouth as he tilts his head back to the pressure of Steve's hardening length, like a man whose thirst has been quenched. "Fucking
Tony grins inwards as he fills his lungs with air whilst sucking on the hard nipple, enjoying this side of the good captain that he has never seen before. It occurred to Tony that Steve may have taken issue with Tony whenever he reminded the captain that he was archaic,
"Oh, oh my god babe," Tony cries. “I’m close baby you know I’m a screamer. I can’t, I can’t,” Tony was gripping the corners of the heavy wooden table, desperately trying to keep himself propped up while his legs were weakening with every thrust of Steve’s fingers into him. If anybody heard him, or walked into them – there was
Tony was so close that even with minimal lighting, Steve got lost in the man's big dark eyes, his fluttering long lashes, that perfect smile line, those plump lips..
"Whoa whoa whoa the accusations," Tony says, in mock-defense, a palm over his chest. "That's harsh, considering that I married the nicest man on earth. Hey stop eating my kid's munchies, they didn't magically appear okay?" Tony snaps the container away as the wizard fishes for another cube.
“You’ve had a lot to drink tonight, Tony. It’s late. The party’s been over for hours. Time for some sleep, okay? Come on I'll help you get back,” Steve says, clearing his throat more than one occasion over the course of five short sentences.
"Everything alright there?" he asks softly, but doesn't stop sliding his cock against Steve's, doesn't stop caressing Steve's chest.
that aliens are coming to wipe out the planet killing everyone but himself thanks to Wanda's little party trick. So to prevent the incoming Doomsday, he not only made Ultron behind everyone's back, he made a second android baby a few days later. If you ask me, there's a serious case of survivor's guilt going on between the two of you and it's not healthy."
“I hurt him, Sam," Steve finally speaks. "I've got no right to be in his life, unless it's on his terms.”
"I'm gonna scream your name as you ram that steel dick of yours into my ass until sunrise," Tony says, low and husky. "How's that sound?"
Peter rolls his eyes. Tony was never gonna let that go. "I'd really like to meet him someday Mr. Stark. Under different circumstances. If he means that much to you, he's gotta be one heck of a cool guy."
She says nothing at first, but pushes dangerously ahead. "Tony, I'm usually your voice of reason when you're about to do something stupid but this,
They stand opposite of each other in the small hallway in silence for a while. Steve leans against the wall and crosses his arms, frowning in contemplation. Tony does the same but he hooks his arms to his neck, watching his man.
Steve breathes quietly, he shuts his eyes and continues knocking his head backwards against the firm surface, hoping his friend would take the hint and leave him alone. All the while he continues to grip the precious cargo in one hand.
"Honey," Tony interrupts Steve with another kiss, wet and sloppy as he cups Steve's jaw, drawing him in. "It's our anniversary. We've been married for 5 years, and you've been making love to me for much longer than that. You know what I like, what I can take. Let's christen our new vibranium-reinforced bed, - love it by the way, best anniversary present ever - and make the most out of that sound-proof spell I got us for tonight." Tony chuckles lowly at the last thought, remembering that horrendous ordeal of having their four year old walking in on them mid-coitus about a month back because poor Petey thought wolves were howling that night.
Tony lowers the half-drank coffee mug and places it on the table next to him. Only then did he notice the mug was red, white and blue with a
Having found his way back from Siberia, Tony was immediately admitted to the hospital for his injuries, the worst being his broken sternum and five shattered ribs caused by blunt force trauma. The CEO of Stark Industries had been camping by Tony's bedside at the hospital when he woke up screaming bloody murder after being unconscious for 3 days post-surgery. Tony was inconsolable as he emerged from a nightmare; he ripped off all the wires hooked on him and started to claw against his chest, desperately looking for something. All he managed to do was bust open the fresh stitches of his injuries and soon his hospital grown was soaked in crimson blood. Tony turned hysterical when he realized his treasured item was missing. He then began to cry, incoherently pleading for someone,
"Let's not waste more time. I'll get Peter," Steve interrupts in a no-nonsense tone as he makes his way out of the room. He stops at the door and turns to the Sorcerer Supreme. "Thank you, everyone. For letting us know and uh, coming to get us. Dr Strange, I'm sorry, I was out of line earlier."
There was a time where columns wrote really nasty things about Tony Stark due to his less than sterling reputation as the
"I'm right where I'm supposed to be," Bucky replies cheekily, showing zero intention of leaving. "You, on the other hand, you seem a little lost, Stark. You're a good 3000 miles away from home, give or take."
much of an effect on the supersoldier to actually convince him to finally move in. Tony was yelling 70% of the time anyway.
“Steve. Baby. Stop it. Don’t go Alpha male on him,” Tony warns, an edge to his voice that instantly deflates his husband. "I'm actually impressed by what a terribly jealous man you are, Cap. Who would have thought. Any other mean streaks I need to know about that should have been in the pre-nup?”
"We fit, Tony," Steve stresses, almost pleading as he looks into those bambi eyes and tightens his grip on Tony's hands as though the man in front of him was going to disappear if he didn't.
Tony suffered the consequences of the war against the Mad Titan the most, having nearly losing his life having his own armoured tech stabbed across his chest. Tony, if he allowed himself to travel into those dark thoughts, would be overall consumed with guilt- on a personal level, Tony's closest friends he called family, people he swore to protect, they made up the numbers of those who remained lost.
At the end of her words, Tony feels choked. His arms begin to tingle, his breathe becomes shallow and Tony just needs to escape that corridor. He was going to die if he didn't. As the walls begin to close down on him, Tony drops to his knees, feeling like his heart was being ripped out of his chest. He wanted to activate his suit, to get to FRIDAY, to send a distress signal to his family but his hands were dead.
“Hey buddy” Tony says softly, kissing his son’s forehead. “You gonna wish your old man a happy birthday?”
“Tony Stank?” the delivery man asks again, but sensing that he’s got the right address and recipient, he hands Steve an electronic device with a stylus attached to it, for a signature.
Tony leans against the armrest of the sofa and looks around while Steve neatly hangs his coat behind the door and goes to the kitchen to put the roses away. The apartment wasn't half as bad as Tony imagined when he walked up. The wallpaper wasn't hideous, the furniture old but not useless. The air was musty but then again the windows were shut due to the snow. The kitchen island was spotless.
Tony could hear Clint's footsteps twisting in the dirt and stepping away, knowing without looking that his former team mate was leaving him to face his demons alone. Tony glances all the same, and watched the archer's back heading to the dimly lit patio.
“I’m not your personal time travelling magician Tony. Start walking, the church isn't even that far,” he says as he opens the front door. Wong steps out first, followed by the father and son duo.
Whilst Steve's mind was crowded by thoughts of his ex lover, he rarely discussed the brunette openly, vocally. It became an unspoken thing that any discussion regarding Stark would not receive the benefit of Steve's input, even though Steve seemed to speak through his aqua blue eyes when it came to Tony. It never stopped him from paying attention though.
Steve was conscious of the fact Tony was going to notice the steadily rising thumps in his chest if the smaller man continues to lay against Steve. He tries to pry Tony off of him, but the tipsy brunette playfully struggled against his grip and it quickly turns into a sporting event. The friendly altercation between the two super heroes ends with Tony regaining his spot sprawled over Steve’s chest (Steve barely resisted, come on) but he was now in between the soldier's legs.
that you brought me home to my wife and kids. I've said some nasty shit to you in the past. But I owe you the truth, even if you think it's gonna be more shit than usual."
They’d also openly complement each other and had no qualms in being physically affectionate, under the pretense that it was all bromance. The shoulder bumps, the pat on the back, the private lunch dates, the lingering touches during a seemingly innocent pass of a cup of coffee at breakfast ..
Tony and Steve rarely made appearances in New York since they retired from their superhero career and moved away. They visited the city only when absolutely necessary, and this weekend was one of the occasions that called for the Stark-Rogers family's full attendance in Manhattan. Tony had his reasons why he would always opts, if not insists to put up his small family of three at 177A Bleeker Street, despite the obvious security lineup the Avengers facility could provide. Tony was aware that his preference for the spellcaster's company as opposed to spending the limited time they had in the city with their former team factored heavily into Steve's disliking towards Strange, fueling his pre-existing jealousy of Tony's penchant for the former neurosurgeon. Now the Sorceror Supreme was suffering the brunt of it, and it was getting irritating.
“I know. I should still be apologizing for being an idiot back then. I hurt you so much,” Steve says, hugging the tinier man tightly.
After getting tricked into listening to Fury's pep talk, Tony had dragged himself upstairs to get cleaned up but instead he walked in on a muscular man with his blonde hair in his hands, sitting on the edge of the bed curled up like an injured puppy. Suddenly the 220lbs 6”2 supersoldier appeared small and fragile to Tony. That night, perhaps because it was a full moon, or perhaps because Steve was actually
Steve had made no plans on using the phone that fateful evening. Steve had zero strategy in place, no rehearsed opening line. No pleasantries. Just his bleeding heart on his sleeve.
Sam wanted to address his concerns over Steve's high level altruism, but he thought the better of it, a conversation for another time. "Well, I'm glad you're happy, Steve. Tony seems like a pretty complicated person to be in a relationship with - half the time you look like you wanna punch him in the face, the other half of that time you spend agonising over a butt plug he gave you."
Nobody spoke of that night ever again probably because none of them can properly recall what happened, but Sam remembers very well how he had to elbow his dork of a friend multiple times (it was like hurling your arm against a stone wall, painfully) to stop Steve from self-combusting with jealousy.
He taps Toy’s leg to motion him to move, but Tony was relentless. He keeps Steve in position, planting a hand over Steve’s broad chest. Truthfully Steve could easily overpower him, but the captain was not really putting up a fight here. He becomes boneless when Tony starts to grind into him, rolling his hips against Steve's crotch seductively.
"You took care of my family. Despite everything." Clint was a mix bag of emotions but right now he was foremost filled with gratitude, even when his face did not show it. "Despite everything that's happened. What I said to you. Thank you Tony."
He couldn't help but groan though - their fun was at his expanse and he getting nervous about what Sam could be sharing with Natasha.
The sounds of cushions bouncing off the floor and newspaper being shoved around was followed by a groan.
Steve finally laughs but does not retort. “Careful though. I stepped on two pieces earlier – super serum or not, it still hurts like a
forgive on my part. My parents have been dead for 20 over years, I've mourned them and I've moved on. Do I miss my mom? Yes. Did she deserve to go the way that she did? Fuck no. Do I want justice for that? You bet I do. That's what the Avengers are for - we take down HYDRA, we take down the bad guys to the very last one so this, this sort of thing never has to happen again."
"This, better be an emergency Strange, or so help me God," Steve threatens low and dangerously, almost growling without finishing his sentence.
Thing is, it was also obvious to everyone that Tony tragically pined for Steve in the exact same way. He goes over and beyond for Steve on a godlike level but refuses to admit that he was head over heels for the super soldier.
"Okay, okay shhh, I gotcha. I gotcha Tony," Steve coos. "I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'm sorry, you're right."
"You know, it was a kick to the face when you said that you were done trying. That maybe we're just not a good fit."
"It wasn't immediate. I first met him at Stuttgart and it was ...it was weird. I tried to talk to him after we'd taken Loki in but he was just
Poor behaviour such as confessing your feelings to the love of your life, and being able to back-pedal if you don't receive the desired reaction.
way,” Tony considers, trying to hide the guilt in his tone. "What can I say, I married a young one. He has needs,” Tony says casually, tossing a blueberry into his mouth before clasping the container shut. "Besides you keep giving us that crap-ass room at the very top of this fun house, it hurts my knees."
The common factor was that every note-worthy accomplishment of Tony's seemed to be an exaggeration of sorts, always tilting to one end of extremity. He either supremely excelled when he puts his heart, mind and soul to a project (e.g Iron Man armours) or fails spectacularly when he didn't (e.g dating his personal assistant, making her his CEO only to get dumped for not being able to split the difference between being a superhero and a boyfriend).
She only wanted her husband back, and since that was beyond Tony at the time, she told him money would do her no good. But she could use some company. So that day, Tony sat quietly with the mother of three, as she sobbed silently. In the very same kitchen he once sat as one of Earth's mightiest heroes.
"Stevie used to feel like a third wheel whenever we took the dames out on dates. Guess the tides have changed, huh?" Bucky looks at Tony, finally forming a smile on his face. Only then did Tony realise how green Bucky's eyes were. Almost as beautiful as Steve's.
Tony pours water on semi-clean cloth he found on the desk and wipes his cheek. He looks Peter dead in the eye. "But I'm not Howard. I don't want you to think I'm just pushing you around because you don't mean anything."
"We weren't together anymore when Siberia happened. We weren't on speaking terms for a while," Steve says, knowing without looking that Natasha and Sam would be trading looks. Steve had never made a direct, open reference to his relationship with Tony, and he was finally,
Tony manages to stretch a half smile. "So I've been told a couple of million times. What's going on, Potts? It's a lot sexier if you'd waited in silk, maybe a thong would be-"
"Stay," Tony whispers, before easing Steve onto his back and climbing over the larger man, connecting their mouths for a gentle kiss. Their legs were caught in between the sheets, but it did not stop Tony from slowly grinding against Steve. He was going to savour this moment, stretching it as far and wide as he could. Because in their line of business, the superhero business, you will never know when the sacrifice play was going to be needed.
Stephen snorts, refusing to allow melancholy to overcome his thoughts. While he survived the initial dusting, he's lost Christine forever.
Steve scrunches up his nose in disinterest. “Nope, not doing it for me at all,” he says, all but lies.
“But I do have some leftover takeout in my suite that could feed a whole village. Or a hungry supersoldier. It’s Chinese, and don’t worry there are tons of those springrolls that you love, those little dumplings that burst in your mouth, there’s the noodles you can’t pronounce…”
issues." Peter shakes his head, regretting his silly pun. "What I'm trying to say is, it's okay. You know? To have bad days, to check out on the world to check in with yourself."
Tony takes a deep breathe because he rarely ever addresses the tragedy without a neat glass in hand.
"You want to meet? Fine. Send me a text where and when. Don't ever call me again. I've got enough bullets to dodge- not that you care to take one for me these days," Tony said coldly, the only way he could ensure his voice remained steady. He felt his anger flaring, and knew that if the conversation went on any further, he was going to go full asshole on Steve.
“Just trust me,” Tony says flatly. If he allowed himself to be dramatic, Steve would tell Tony that he trusts him with his
Tony thinks, amused. His dick was still recovering from Steve's aggresive rodeo two hours ago. Not to mention they broke the headboard this time.
Each time he visited, unless he flew the Iron Man suit, Tony brought with him trucks worth of fresh supplies - food, home, kitchenware you name it - that would last weeks without the need for replenishing. When Laura insisted there was no room to store it all, her polite way of saying he was doing more than enough, Tony offered to have the needs brought over sporadically.
Tony remembers how streams of water ran over Steve’s face as his lips stretched around Tony’s cock. Tony remembers grinding his full, thick length into Steve, hitting his sweet spot with every thrust. Tony remembers Steve crying his name in pleasure, pleading, begging to feel every inch of Tony as he spilled across the bathroom floor, as he milked Tony into euphoria.
With the gift of hindsight, it eventually became clear to Steve that Tony despite his wide range of character defects, gave Steve everything he could give.
"What did you ask him?" Sam queries, stretching his arms as he sits crossed legged between the Widow and Capt.
“Not a very good idea to be dicing watermelons while - unghh" Tony moans as Steve pulls his boxers off, his half-hard cock catching on to the elastic band and springing awake. "Steve, we're in a kitchen honey," Tony says, pointing out the obvious.
briefly takes him back to last night, and a blush creeps in. Come to think of it, his throat could use a little down time after all that abuse.
"Look I'm not going to pass any commentary on your personal life but I gotta say, it's crazy finding out about your two friends hooking up while brushing your fucking teeth at the sink. I really wasn't gonna say anything, but since Germany lost a good airport because you two had the messiest break up in modern history..."
It was a good thing that Peter remained where he stood, because everything happened in a split second after. Tony struggled against the burly man and flicked his implanted arm, sending a gauntlet from a damaged Mark XLVI flying across the room, shattering glass and furniture to attach itself to its maker. The piece of armour nearly hit Happy square in the face but thanks to Peter's sense and quick reflexes, he managed to web the repulser-powered gauntlet away just barely inches away from impact.
Tony, to his own credit, knew exactly how that app works. Peter had been trying to set an account up for him.
"You wanna meet him huh. Well no promises, kid. I've broken too many to make another. But you know, something tells me the two of you would hit it off. By the way, could you stop calling me Mr. Stark?"
It was the same delivery guy from years ago, who appeared at the compound after the Civil War. Painful memories are associated with that name, Tony Stank, as it reminded Tony of a time where he felt he’d lost everything, and the sense of betrayal was cut even deeper as he read the words on the letter that came with the delivery of a flip phone.
Steve bursts into a hearty laugh and Tony does too. “Oh rubbing it in by giving such a humiliating experience a name, why don't you? Gosh, that was a bad one, wasn’t it.”
it, Stark. The man standing in the middle of my living room a week ago? I barely recognised him. Fucks sake he was doing the whole ugly crying thing - and I've seen him cry before. This was horrible. I would have tossed him out if he hadn't started crying like a little girl on my couch. If that wasn't scary enough, finding out
Tony wanted the day to start as special as he felt, which means he was going to try make breakfast. A scientist he may be, but cooking was never a task he faired very well in. He wasn’t half bad but if all else fails, Tony knew there’s Special K somewhere in the kitchen cabinets.
"Enjoying the ride?" Steve asks daringly. The friction against his dick was good. Oh so good. It was like the floodgates have opened and Steve was helpless against the countless fantasies he's had of Tony flashing their way into his mind and down to his ready and leaking cock. Steve imagines how good it would feel having Tony bouncing off his dick like this and nearly comes in his pants at the thought.
He could still feel himself crowding into Tony’s personal space and lingered just above his lips, waiting for permission before whispering, “Is this okay? I don’t really want a bloodied nose if I touch you without consent.”
Two months later, the internet exploded with the return of Tony Stark at the helm of Stark Industries and the media sensationalised the frequent sightings of the billionaire with his CEO and old flame Pepper Potts, fuelling rumours that he left the superhero business and went back to the corporate world for her.
"I'm just going to lay it out for you," Sam says, cocking his head in Steve's direction, lazily looking at him.
“Trust FRIDAY, she'll keep bogeys off your tail. You should really go for this, Steve. It’s for Sam, he's a brother to you; it would mean a lot to his family too if you went for it. Don’t you worry your pretty little head about us. Petey and I will be fine – we’ll go ride the ponies and eat all the cotton candy without you."
Shuri hesitates for a moment, and takes a glance at T'Challa who was in a conversation with Okoye a few feet away. She looks back at Tony, her cheeky smile disappearing. The princess' words were careful and soft. "The procedure was a success. Sergeant Barnes is no longer responding to the trigger words and poses no threat to anyone. In fact, I'm going to have to leave you right now."
Before long, the armour lands gracefully on the launchpad attached to his suite, located on the pinnacle of the skyscraper. The pathway blinked awake in a domino effect and soon the the entire penthouse came alive.
for Tony's cock. "Is this what you want baby?" Tony whispered as he jerked himself lazily. "Talk to me baby I wanna hear you beg for me."
As uncomfortable as the topic was to Sam, he was aware that his friend was finally living a somewhat normal life - by dating a world-famous, disgustingly rich and very attractive
But the damage was done and Steve continues to glare at Sam, pleading for the man to end his misery.
"He's nice," Tony croaks, before clearing his throat. "You'd like him if you met him. In a normal setting without tarmac, and trucks and planes being thrown in your direction. He'd make you breakfast, tell you to sleep regularly, keep you safe on the battlefield and harp on your safety like a mother hen because he's really that kind of person who cares." Before he knew it, Tony was describing all the ways Steve took care of him, and not exactly a general description Peter was asking for.
“Tony has been an excellent father to both of the twins. Even today we saw how distraught Peter was when he had to sit away from his father. We know that Tony shares all he can with the twins and has the safety on everything. The media even learned not to mess with the twins after the train accident where Steven Rogers tried to kill my client when having a flashback. Steven left the twins unattended for over four hours while Tony was in a coma. Thank you.”
That made things even better. If the man watching him didn’t know what anything was then Tony could build anything he wanted. What he wanted was armor. After ten days of programming and, twenty-eight days of building Tony made a suit that would fit him inside.
She nodded and got up stumbling over her own feet trying to stand in the uneven sand. Coughing she held her hand out. “I-I gotta go…” Luna got the broomstick up without using the command and flew off.
“P-Peter…” Violet looked at him shaking. “We can’t fight them. No, I can’t fight them. All I do is make things appear.” Violet knew how to fight hand to hand combat from Aunt Nat, but her powers never helped in any situation.
“Oh, yes,” the receptionist looked up and smiled. “She is a peculiar one. She’ll fit right in with you two. If you come this way, please. Oh, by the way, my name is Gale. I’m one of the runners of the household.”
The judge just nodded. “Why don’t we get your sister to join you? Violet, please come to the stand.”
Two weeks after staying in the hospital everyone was allowed to come home. Tony sat the twins on the couch putting on the Jungle Book the original or Tony wouldn’t have been able to watch it. The actors were just… pissing him off.
The court began before Violet even arrived. Which had both Steve and Tony worried. Tony wanted to see the little girl more than anything in the world, but maybe he wouldn’t get that chance today.
They both ran up the stairs like schoolboys going to look at a pornographic magazine. One right behind the other chasing the other.  By the time they were up at the top of the stairs Steve was stripping off his shirt and was pulling Tony close to kiss him.
He got Bruce to put it in her brain where the two plastic holes where. Never turned it on until a month after it was implanted. Today he was going to test and see if it worked. Tony watched his daughter struggling to play the piano from the video footage in the lab.  Normally after an hour, she would forget what she was doing, but she continued to play for two hours straight. Studying her every move.
“Violet, don’t wanna walk anymore. Can we sit down?” Peter begged his sister while dragging his feet.
He was there within the hour of the phone call. “Bruce thank the Gods your here.” Tony smiled and held Steve’s hand tightly.
“Along with the Avengers Land opening in Disneyland next week… we thought we could do Comic-Con and have you with us at the grand opening!” Steve smiled and held his hands up.
“I will call with the results. Thank you for coming all the way out here. I would have flown to you, but it was so last minute. Tony is getting dressed.”
“I’m not a strange to the dark…” She hummed along with the words unpacking her book bag. “Hideaway they say ‘cause we don’t want your broken hearts… I’ve learned to be ashamed of all my scars! Run away! They say! Because no one will love you as you are!”
Levi stood. “Your honor, Anthony would like to know if the court needs to know about traveling with the twins.”
It’s been eleven months since the twin's surgeries happened. Peter is almost completely healed decides the fact that he still has a nasty cough, but the fathers thought it was better than Peter drowning in his own fluid in the lungs. Violet had kept from above her elbow up of her arm. Tony, Bruce, and Helen are trying to design a model for when the girl grows up into a toddler.
. One article wrote that the former weapons dealer if cut through his flesh would not draw red blood. Tony wouldn’t argue with that – lately he would likely drip espresso. Black, like his damaged heart.
Two days later, General Okoye arrives at the Stark mansion to personally collect the billionaire. After a brief chat indoors, they finally move to leave the estate with Pepper accompanying them to an unmarked car driven by the Wakandan herself. The redhead-turned-blonde looks on worriedly as Tony walks towards the opened passenger door leaving with nothing but a casual jacket on his back, white t-shirt and dark jeans, and a pair of red-tinted aviators. At least FRIDAY was online with Tony and would be able to send the CEO live feeds of Tony's vital signs, so that offered some form of comfort.
Steve kisses Tony again, quicker than the last before turning to the old man in a FedEx cap and sunglasses. “What do we have here?” Steve asks, more to Peter than to the man holding the package.
Because by that time, he had a feign idea of what the Winter Soldier may have done to Tony's parents.
“It doesn’t make sense, Sam. If I’m gonna put this on, how is he going to –“ Sam smacks his forehead in disbelief at how his warning just flew over Steve's head. “-make love to me? It’s a little too much with Tony already being so endowed-“
watching him the whole night. Tony barely ate anything, and he only had two pieces of Clint's signature finger food.
Steve was on his stomach, his usual sleeping position, tangled under silk sheets and buried under soft pillows. As he blinked his eyes open, he could hear Tony's steady breathing, fingers twirling the tip of his blonde hair. The smell of sex, sweat and coffee filled the room as Steve took a long deep breathe, stirring awake. As he drew out the air from his lungs, he was slightly jolted by the cool wet trail that seeped down his thighs.
Steve was mixed in embarrassment and awkwardness as his pants grew tight at the graphic memory of Tony pleasuring him.
“Later, I want you to keep these on,” Steve says, as he adjusts the frames on Tony’s face, "and wear your varsity jacket," and leans to whisper, “while I suck you off on my knees. You can do whatever you want with me tonight sweetheart. How about that?”
"That's not the only thing you said, and believe me that's not the part that's stuck. I realise that I have been selfish. For the most part, I agree with you."
"He's pretty wiped out. Good luck," Bucky continues, taking in Tony's struggles with too much delight. Tony grunts as he carefully peels his limbs from under Steve. Thankfully the super soldier shuffles, giving Tony some space to wiggle out of his grip, and onto the floor. Steve didn't seem to realise that the warm body he was pressed against was now gone and he continues to sleep.
“I'm glad you find this funny,” Steve says out loud to stress the point home, more to himself than to Tony, as his cheeks heat up in betrayal.
a big deal. Alright? Can I talk please?” Tony’s voice hitches, getting slightly irritated. “We should have had this conversation a long time ago. If I'm going to break my promises to you and act like a tool in front of you, you deserve to know what's going on." Tony pulls out a chair and signals the teen to come over. Peter moves closer and slowly takes his place next to Tony, folding his legs on the seat. "My old man never had time for me, we never talked about stuff and I grew up never really knowing the man. He just never wanted me around and I guess I ended up with a laundry list of issues because of that."
For a moment, the only sounds that were audible were their heavy panting and the slap of skin on skin.
It was indeed unfortunate that whilst the super soldier serum transformed Steve Rogers into the pinnacle of human potential, it entirely miscalculated Steve's short emotional range and missed the account of enhancing that capacity.  Far too late for that now, especially since he had to messily fall in love with a man who shared the same demons.
Steve nods in response. Before either of them could decide on what to say next, a voice breaks into the background.
About a month later, Vision out of nowhere confirmed the Scarlet Witch's theory during physical combat training session. It completely caught Steve off guard and distracted him, earning him a hard kick square in the face from Natasha. Sam had to withhold the urge to curl to his stomach and laugh as Steve stayed flat on the mat, holding on to his bloodied nose while the Black Widow unsympathetically threw a towel to him and it landed on his face. That helped conceal his blush when Vision continued to matter-of-factly state that he has on many occasions found Tony's suite empty throughout the evenings and Tony would usually emerge mid-morning looking very refreshed and appropriately bruised.
Tony even scienced with Cooper once for his lab project, but it got the pre-teen into so much trouble at school that Tony was barred from helping the kids with homework ever since.
Whichever way, there was no room for mediocrity - everything Tony Stark did, in success or in failure, was explosive.
reappear had no memory of having ever disappearing into thin air, even after losing years of their lives in a blink of an eye. They returned unsuspectingly to loved ones who were broken from the initial dusting, and the healing process soon became both ways.
It threw a wrench in the process, as Steve and Tony were forced to reunite under terrible circumstances. Their last conversation at the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre in Berlin drew no conclusion, even when Tony admitted that he missed Steve and begged him to sign the Accords. Steve held his ground firm, refusing to cave into the arms of the man he loved with every fibre of his soul.
Breaking into his thoughts, Friday announces that Spider-Man has landed on his roof. Two seconds later the crime fighting teen emerges from the high ceilings through the windows of the garage and spins a web to lower himself to the ground, upside down like he always does.
Swiftly she sets on her feet to leave her personal space and crosses the boxcar graceful as a cat, and plants herself by the wide open door facing Steve, one boot swinging over the edge.
Tony composed himself and shook his head. The stubborn man needed to have his way, as usual. "Ross said.."
Tony shakes his head, in denial. "You know what I can't get out of my head Pep? Barnes. Something's going on there. He was protecting Barnes like the man meant the world to him. I could have blown off the guy's head the way I blew off his arm but I didn't. Steve just went for me. He went to town with the shield."
“She’ll come around,” Tony offers, sipping his. “Steve’ll talk to her. No better person to, given the circumstances,” Tony means it as a joke, maybe partially. Bucky for some reason looks away in deep thoughts. There was a moment of silence before they continue chatting.
“No better person to lick wounds with than someone with shared life experiences,” Tony says jokingly as he pats his chest but regrets it the moment he notices how tortured Steve looked hearing him say that. He pushes himself off the wall and brackets his husband’s waist. “Sorry baby, I didn’t mean it like that,” he whispers in comfort, grazing himself on Steve’s bearded jaw.
a mile away and having spent so much time with the billionaire over the course of the months, Peter could always tell when Tony was crumbling apart. When Tony finally looks up from under the hood, he sees Peter now standing upright, no longer in his Spider-Man suit and blinking at the burner phone at the edge of the desk before their eyes meet. Peter swallows nervously like he was caught looking at something he wasn't supposed to.
Caught in a dilemma of whether to lash out at Steve or be civil about this whole meeting request, Tony silently wished that Clint was still there with him. The snarky assassin had always had a knack of getting through to Tony. But still stuck in his head, Tony did not realise he had been unresponsive for far too long that Steve started to sound desperate.
“Well Tony’s been busy with his clean energy campaign... it's really kicking off and we haven't really had much time to talk. He's been around the country for the past week. I mean, you saw him leaving mid-way through my own birthday party. He didn’t even get the chance to give me my present before he left. We spoke on the phone after the party and he told me where he'd left it.”
getting juvenile. Steve shifts in his seat uncomfortably, unsure where the conversation was heading to.
Steve could never break the phone. He held the clamshell like a lifeline. It was his only material connection to Tony.
Birdman," Tony lies. "Germany happened because Steve Rogers wanted to ride into the sunset with his cyborg boyfriend to kill more cyborgs without clueing any of us in."
As Steve chants Tony's name like prayer, he runs his hands over his hair, unintentionally flexing and showing off his gorgeous, sculptured body.
"Wong," Steve answers without context, before he goes down on his knees and plants a small bite on Tony’s exposed buttocks, eliciting a soft gasp from the bent over gentleman.
"I thought you were gonna say kill me," Bucky kids but Tony winces. They've spoken about The Incident. Many times before. They've made peace, they've put it behind them. But every now and then the nightmares do reoccur, solid and clear, as though Tony was right there in the backseat of the car watching the metal arm reaching out for his mother's neck. These were Tony's demons though, he was not going to continue punishing James Buchanan Barnes for HYDRA's crimes.
"I just ... give me minute please?" Tony mutters as he slowly blinks back to normalcy. He walks back to his work desk, with Peter trailing closely next to him.
cry as he bows his face, hiding it from Pepper. She pulls him closer to her chest, soothing him through his sobbing. "Oh Tony, baby shhhh it's okay" Pepper coos, slinging her arm around his shoulder and cradling his head to her, her fingers through his hair.
Project Rebirth transformed Steve Rogers from a sickly young man into the perfect specimen of human development and condition.
Tony, at that moment, swam in the thought about his decision of giving up Avenging once they had finally won the battle with Thanos. At the very end, despite their best efforts to set things right, the dusting was not completely reversible - the half of humanity that vanished did not all return. It was a devastating outcome all the same for the Avengers who naively expected a clean victory.
Whilst the both of them were buck naked, thankfully they were covered in a large throw blanket. Tony wonders if this was Steve's doing. The blanket was definitely not there when they fell asleep on the couch last night.
got me back into the US Tony. Nobody else I know has that kind of pull, or interest to keep me under wraps."
his goddamn pants, but stops short of pulling the zipper down. Steve prays that Tony doesn't call him out for noticing this just to add further to his embarrassment.
Tony thinks of that one conversation they had, a random one that Tony decided to slip in a hot topic, and grimaces at the thought of Steve's reaction.
Of course Tony had no idea, at the time, that his phone call to Steve after the whole Triskelion fiasco had
"It’s really okay, Mr. Stark, there’s nothing to be ashamed of. I mean just look at him. He's literally the pinnacle of human perfection, he's a war hero, he's handsome and so ripped -”
Peter dragged Bucky from ride to ride - from the spinning cups to the merry-go-round to a walk across the house of mirrors. He cheered loudly and clapped as Bucky sharply tossed rings over bottles, shot moving ducks off the wall with precision and he never seemed to miss, no matter how lazily he played. Peter was extremely happily that afternoon, hugging all the stuffed animals Bucky won for him from these games, only to off-load them to his Daddy to continue his adventures with his new best friend.
“Your little speech earlier was pretty something. Thor’s all worked up, he’s really hoping we’re right about this base.” Tony said, taking a nervous step into the room. He was sheepish tonight, Steve noticed, and it made his heart flutter even more. Tony had also changed into a loose sweater and track bottoms, a sign that he wasn’t heading to the lab or working on anything in the garage.
way. It's a short story I know, but walking in on them going at it like rabbits - man's the mic drop right there. Thankfully there is still a God watching over me, because Stark was facing the other way so he hadn't notice. I have never clicked on an elevator button as fast as I did that day. After all these years I still have trouble looking at Stark without recalling the image of his white boy ass in my brain."
good for you. Think of your Uncle Thor. He eats tons of greens. Look at how strong he is, wielding good ol’ StormBreaker.”
He knows that he's being petty, he knows from the desperation in Steve's voice that the super soldier was hurting for him and that he genuinely wants to meet to make amends, to fix what was broken. In fact the first few things that Steve said over the phone was admitting that he missed Tony, and that he was sorry. Just thinking about that confession made Tony's eyes sting because God knows how much he needed to hear that.
"Let me do all the work okay? 'S your turn to enjoy the night, mister," Steve hums before he presses a thumb into Tony's puffy, loosened rim and the digit slides into the slick hole without resistance. That elicits another dirty moan from Tony which goes straight to Steve's groin. He groans and bites the hard flesh of Tony's ass, making his husband yelp. "You fucked me so good earlier sweetheart, letting me ride you, filling me up as I come over and over. Now let me show my best fella a good time, alright?" Steve continues suckling at his husband's entrance hungrily, saliva dripping out the corners of his mouth as he tongues the swollen rim, flicking his tongue over and over again to taste, and diving in to open.
“Just noticed you getting hot and bothered over some of my pictures from MIT the other day. Thought I’d treat you with a Tony Stark bespectacled look from the 80s,” Tony says, wiggling his eyebrows seductively. "You like?"
"Maybe. Yes? I mean you know what - we don't have to talk about that now. Sorry. Massive amount of blood just travelled south because, damn.
At first, he wondered if Tony had a change of heart. But whenever he walked by the lab and glanced through the window panels to catch Tony's eye, Tony would return him the warmest, apologetic smile. Tony would occasionally give Steve a silly wave and if his mood was better, he would make hand signals just to confuse the love-struck soldier.
Steven Grant Rogers lays asleep beside him, in all his naked super soldier glory settling flatly on his stomach as the curve of his perfect ass formed a hill from beneath the bedding- that perfect ass that Tony's fingers had done many naughty things to just a few hours ago.
How on earth was Tony supposed to know that Steve Rogers had game anyway? With his 1940's, Brooklyn manners and painfully reserved demeanour, Tony did not peg the man to be
Peter makes a face, contemplating the most appropriate response. "Is that ketchup?" Peter points to Tony's cheek, his finger nearly touching the man. Tony jerks his head back and Peter gets the message loud and clear. "Sorry. You just have -" Peter swirls his hand over his own cheek, points back at Tony to guide him.
Tony only allowed himself to believe that Steve was dutifully responding to his bait out of sheer politeness and responsibility, and not because the other man was equally attracted to him. He pushed away any thought or idea that Steve Rogers would ever feel the same way, convincing himself amongst other reasons that Steve was as straight as Clint's arrow.
"He doesn't, Pep. I wish I had spelled it out for him when I had the chance. Maybe all this could have been avoided. Maybe he'd see it from my point of view. Maybe he wouldn't ... Jesus I'm pushing 50 in three years Pep. You take away the ice, the man is in his 30s. I don't know what made me think we could actually work."
“God no.” Tony replied quickly. "It's irresponsible, even for me, to blow up the kitchen before we leave for Eastern Europe.
knows it's your anniversary and nobody in the next room wanted to make this house call." Strange deadpans. "Barnes drew the shortest straw."
With little choice, Tony forces a hard breath through tight pressed lips, his chest bursting in pain and relief as he blinks back into the present, sweat trickling down his eye. Tony felt on display, as though he was caught mid-way through a stage performance struggling with his words to an eager audience anticipating the next great line. Always a showman who didn't like to disappoint, Tony gives one curt nod to signal that he was okay.
Tony's last words were still ringing in Steve's ears; twelve tubs of ice cream in a span of six days bears witness to its effect. But now the brunette was standing in the hallway of Bucky's not so secret apartment, halfway across the globe, two days after Christmas with...
holding back. I always had one foot out the door, ready to take off at the first sight of trouble. I took advantage of the situation. And you're not wrong about me sending you mixed signals; I realise now that I was reeling you in when it was convenient and shutting you out when things got rough. You have given me so much of you yet I couldn't even give you a straight answer."
"Last I checked I'm still a wanted man, Stark. Not everyone's as forgiving as you are," Bucky says stoically.
Steve swallows, the words hitting him like a ton of bricks. After dramatically chucking his belt aside, Steve fights the urge to look everywhere but downwards. Even without looking, he knows that Tony has
“It was a bad fight, nobody is saying it wasn’t. You did him wrong, he blew Barnes’ arm off – you do crazy things when you’re hysterical. And now you’re not. He’s safe. You’ve sent him a phone. Use your words, Steve.”
"Where's Petey?" Tony asks, channeling some responsible parenting, all the while he reciprocates his husband's advances, shutting his eyes and grinding his ass against Steve's dick in a semi-public place. Tony was slightly disappointed that said dick was still clothed.
To his horror, Sam starts to tell the story. Steve silently wishes for a quick painless death, because like clockwork, his brain was flooded.
Rhodey’s last visit was Christmas where he’d brought a mountain of presents for little Peter, making him Peter’s Favourite Uncle Ever. Of course Tony was careful not to disclose that most of Peter’s toys had since been reassembled or improved, much like the fire truck that currently rested on the table with mini repulsors on its way to getting fitted. Rhodey would have words if he knew what his innocent gifts were being turned into, but he wouldn’t be surprised.
That is, if Tony hadn’t smashed the identical one he’d given him or burned it with the letter Steve had spent days agonizing over. It had been 2 weeks since he received an acknowledgement that the parcel had been delivered safely at the compound, accepted personally by Stark.
They both turn at the sound of Steve's awakening. The blond super soldier sits up from the couch and stretches his arms far and wide. His tussled hair, the slight blush on his cheeks was a sight to behold. When he scratches his neck, Tony's attention was brought to the various visible marks that he had left on his new boyfriend. One nipple was quite well ravished.
Peter makes a face. "Nah, I've always been more of an Iron Man kind of person. Ok I'm bit of both actually. The Red and The blue does make a pretty good combination."
old,” Tony corrects, and turns back to his son. “Thor is more of a Brutus anyway,” he mutters to himself. “Come on champ, a deal’s a deal, if you don’t honor this one, you’re out of business. Not gonna be able to back you up next time,” Tony coerces then waits, allowing Peter to decide on his next move.
There was a pregnant two seconds before Sam narrows his eyes, wondering if Steve had completely missed his point. Of course he did.
“Ah, ah, none of that. We're in this together. I’m just better at making things up as I go along,” Tony says, laying a chaste kiss on Steve before settling on the dinner table to go back to his tablet. Tony flicks the inbox open and goes through the last three Stark Industries-related emails before he notes a particular unread email.
"I got Natasha to help me set up a video call. I wasn't very nice to him to be honest - kind of screamed at him for being a knucklehead and taking on the Mandarin without us. He didn't appreciate the yelling of course; he literally threw a screw driver at the hologram - he was really aiming for my face. Two days later he sends me one of his custom phones with a handwritten manual stuck on the box that said
, clothed and (half) naked. There was desire in those blue eyes, but the same can be taken as curiosity. The fact remains that Steve had only been attracted to women before Tony crashed landed into his life. So it was a fair question from Tony, one that didn't require an immediate knee-jerk response.
"Anyway, you shaved," Steve says, noticing the absence of the messy stubble his husband sported lately as opposed to his signature goatee. He lifts Tony's smooth chin with a finger, rotating his face from left to right, inspecting the handsome man who was just playing along. "And you're wearing spectacles. New look?"
Tony takes his eyes away from Bucky and nods at Steve. "Still running some tests but it should work. Beta-phase in three weeks."
wouldn't shut up about him), Tony has been carefully toeing the line but never over-stepping the boundaries.
"Rogers, we're having a moment here. I promise you; whatever is discussed here will not leave these four-
He watches as Tony's eyes map him, planning on what best to do with the super soldier underneath him. It was insanely hot.
, given that she's noticed frequent purpling bruises on Tony's neck whenever he visited them and stayed over night, which became very frequent of late. Steve later pulled Wanda aside to gently remind her she wasn't allowed to get into anyone's head no matter how curious she was for the truth.
well and openly dedicated love songs to Steve more rounds than he did for any other Avenger. But yup, Thor was literally stuck to Tony's hip the entire evening giving Steve no chance to even socialise with the brunette without being interrupted. With Asgardian mead in the mix, the private party may have gotten a little out of control with the Avengers having to individually file a report the next day for inappropriate behaviour and causing multiple property damage.
“So am I,” Tony bites back without any teeth. “I know you want to go for this. The only thing stopping you is the two of us and I’m telling you not to make us out as an excuse for you to miss a ceremony honoring your good friend. I’ll say it again – we’ll be fine,” Tony says, punctuating the last three words with light punches on Steve's broad chest. “If it gives you added peace of mind, I’ll lock in the nanites on me the whole time you’re gone,” he assures.
The chaos in his head stills at the sight of his ex-girlfriend appearing in his bedroom at - Tony glances at the hologram clock over the minibar-
So it wasn't particularly vengeance or jealousy that fuelled Tony at that moment, yet he couldn't place a finger on why he felt so apprehensive. Perhaps arranging their reunion so close by to where Barnes physical was, was a move that came too soon. Now, 11 months after Siberia, they were finally due to reunite and talk about the hows, the whys, and the what nows.
So Steve's main issue was the safety and privacy of his family. Unsurprising, since Tony and Steve became America's, possibly the world's highest profiled couple when the news broke that the two of them had married.
“I’m really not the best person to even talk about this,” Steve says, hesitantly. “But yeah, Bucky and Nat are going through some sort of a rough patch." Steve clears his throat before he continues. "He uh asked for her hand in marriage couple of weeks ago and she kind of turned him down.”
Given that he's already come twice tonight having thoroughly fucked Steve less than hour ago, it was a rarity for him to get hard again in such a short span of time.
“Daddy’s got presents!” Peter cheers and wiggles in Tony’s arms, drawing Tony back to, well, the present. Breathe Stark, he tells himself silently. This is your life now. Not wanting to step further into the cold, Tony was relieved to hear footsteps approaching him from the living room.
He turns to give Tony some privacy, knowing it was not going to be an easy conversation for them to have. Clint couldn't help but overhear the sound of a flick. And then, with little to no context----
"It was good. Great. The usual. Too much eggnog. I hate eggnog." The answers came out mechanically, as intended. Tony didn't really stalk the super soldier across the globe to talk about how he spent Christmas
"We have gay people in Queens, Mr Stark," Peter suddenly says, very assuringly. “It’s okay, there’s nothing wrong with being in love with another man. I think it’s pretty cool, I mean – Captain America and Iron man. Wow. There are tons of people out there who's been shipping you guys for years.”
Bucky crosses his arms; the whirring was jarringly louder these days and it did annoy the soldier from time to time. "Wasn't scratching."
He was still impressed with himself nonetheless, allowing the proverbially pat on the back, but things could easily turn ugly within the next few seconds.
They look at each other with hopeful, dopey eyes that it makes Bucky feel like a lamp post. So he forces out the loudest throat clear in the history of mankind, startling the lovesick super heroes and drawing their attention back to him.
Tony hated that chore. Farm life or not, there were still things Tony couldn’t bring himself to do. Squeezing udders and dodging vicious hind leg kicks was one of the many. Groaning in silence, Tony softly pushed the door of the fridge when he hears footsteps from upstairs.
Pepper turns her head to face Tony, her red bangs falling across her forehead. Tony instinctively reaches out and pushes the soft strands away with his fingers.
Tony remembers hearing the bathroom door swinging open as he stood in the mist, under the spray of hot water.
“Sooooo,” Tony says to Bucky, dragging the word as they lower their trays of food and take their seats. There were banana splits, buffalo wings, a bag full of popcorn and a ginormous ball of cotton candy wrapped inside clear plastic. Peter sat in between the two adults, happily pinching off the colourful sweet fluff as his eyes roam the carnival, ignoring them while making more plans for the 2
"You'd like that huh Steven?" Tony whispers, using the captain's given name, a show of dominance that he knew did it for Steve. "Would you like it if I fucked your brains out after that?"
“The cameras at the mall were grainy but nothing JARVIS couldn't fix. Honestly, Cap? You literally just stood there and let poor Romanoff do all the work. Bad, would be a great understatement,” Tony says, propping himself up in a swift move.
Awkwardly, Pepper was the first to find out but only because Rhodey was still in an induced-coma at the time.
"I won't pretend to understand how you feel about Barnes, Tony. But I'll try anyway. What I know and I'm sure you do too, since your IQ runs in circles around mine, is that Bucky Barnes
I kicked everyone off the corner to make room for you. Point Break only came by because he felt sorry for me that you didn't turn up!"
"Yeah kinda. What's up guys? It's actually," - Tony glances at the hologram watch on the wall - "legitimately
Tony remembers hesitant yet strong arms crowding into his personal space, slowly boxing him against the tiled wall. He remembers light kisses tracing his wet shoulders, lining his neck and pressing behind his soaked hair, seeking permission.
"Tony, Ross wants you locked up because of him. Sneaking around the globe for a secret rendezvous is .... a tad romantic I guess. I mean," Pepper says, considering their options in her brain. "It's not
"So humor me Tony," Steve presses against Tony as he pulls him back into his arms. "Why are we always here when we visit New York? We could just take the mansion where FRIDAY is always on high alert, or Jim's penthouse a couple of blocks away. Not to mention, we could go Upstate where everyone else is-"
It was only far into their relationship that Steve finally agreed to penetrate Tony, after the older man assured and assured and
Pepper doesn't answer as she guides him to the bed and they sit across each other, their hands intertwined. She sniffles, calming herself down from the tears. "How are you feeling?" Pepper asks, placing a palm over his neck to check for a temperature, also to wipe off the wetness she had left on him.
Steve chuckles. “By the way, I don’t look at men in general either,” Steve says, referring to their earlier conversation. “Just you Tony. It’s always been just you. I love you, so much.”
Barnes. You wouldn't kill him -I know you. But you went after Steve pretty hard yourself. I'm not taking sides, believe me, I am still shocked at how far the two of you let things stretch. I think a lot of it had to do with all your unresolved issues with him, including Barnes and you let it get to you."
Tony was a firm believe in Going Big or Go Home, even before it became an everyday pop-culture catchphrase.
Steve happily receives the blue eyed brunette and hoists Peter into the air before settling the boy on his side, one leg resting on his chiseled abs while the other dangles lazily against his back.
Reason being? Two days prior, the two Avengers were at each other's throats yet again, this time disagreeing (mid-way during combat training, no less) over the infiltration mission strategy for Sokovia. The entire team was present, bemused by the UST oozing from their two comrades but nobody stepped in to interfere. Natasha lazily stretched on the mat a few feet away from the screaming match; Clint swung from scaffolding to scaffolding, shooting moving exploding targets whilst casually paying attention to Mom and Dad arguing. Thor awkwardly stood the closest to them, perhaps worried should they begin trading physical blows. Bruce had removed himself completely from the situation, for obvious reasons.
To be fair, had it not been for Siberia the extent of his relationship with Tony from start to tragic finish would have remained a private affair. The fact of the matter is, before shit had hit the ceiling, before the Accords, before Leipzig, before Siberia happened, Steve and Tony had actually and officially broken up.
Who was he kidding though? After what happened at the bunker, after he chose to use the words “..if you need me” instead of
Social functions were another way of Stark tearing down his walls around Steve. He was the only Avenger Tony would readily invite along, mostly because Steve was, after all a national icon. Any benefit attended by Steve Rogers in a dress uniform and Tony Stark counted as extremely successful. Besides, Steve was too
The outline of Tony's manhood was visible even from his loose boxers and Steve's mouth start to water. It surprises him how much he wanted to be
means now; he's heard the whispers from the SHIELD agents as he walks by the gym corridors after a workout. As much as the lingering looks and the flirty compliments about his Greek god body flatters him, Steve's body has never received a physical compliment.
“Okay let’s not get all sappy about the past. Problem at hand though, is settled – Bucky is crashing for the weekend for some much needed TLC with Peter and I, while you go put on your dress uniform and remind the world what a badass Sam Wilson was.”
Steve lowered the file he had been re-reading for the past 5 minutes, even though his eidetic memory had recorded every word written the first time around.
Pepper envelops herself over Tony this time, calming him down. "You deserve the world, you hear me? If Steve Rogers can't fit you in his, you're better off without him."
he first thing he asked me was whether I did pilates as a workout and in the same sentence he mocked me for being old. I didn't know what pilates was but I knew he was being an ass and it was infuriating."
time – I don’t want to talk about this,” the Falcon warns, punctuating his words heavily as he shifts uncomfortably on the sofa, hugging a pillow cushion. “Talk to
This is his life now, and he devoted it to Peter, promising to be everything his adopted son needed in memory of a young man Tony still feels greatly responsible for.
Steve finally showed some level of coyness as he opens up about how they would usually make love (Sam's brain kept correcting Steve to say
“Come off me, Tony. Let’s get you back inside.” Steve tries to lift him but Tony clenches his legs tightly against Steve’s thighs. The move catches the super soldier off guard, rendering him immobile for two seconds before his brain reboots. “
Steve got there first, only beating Tony by a matter of seconds. Steve's vision completely whites out when he comes, spilling into his stomach and Tony's seed soon overcoats his. There was a pool of semen across his abs, dripping down his waist and Steve was conscious of the fact that it was mostly his spend. He comes like a geyser on a lazy day and this time, he came harder than he has ever done.
He was finding his courage and wit again, seeing that Steve was showing little to no signs of regret from last night. Whilst Steve's morning wood could well be a human biological reaction rather than evidence of emotional reciprocation, the blush that was beginning to form on his cheeks confirms otherwise.
. So far, Tony has never won this fight. Particularly in this setting, it was easy for Tony to sink into the memory of the bedroom the Bartons had expected Steve and him to share.
Pepper slaps his arm. "TONY I meant you actually planned to literally go down on one knee? You romantic little shit!"
When he tries to pry his shoulder from leather of the couch to at least prop himself up, Tony feels sticky, sore all over. He wonders how Steve was going to react when he wakes up. Was he going to freak out? Will he regret the things he let Tony do to him? Would he want more?
The team had finally learned to work like one, as their relationships improved greatly through extended periods of time spent sparring at the gym and training together at the special simulator ground designed by Stark at the compound.
is he?” Sam repeats after Steve, half annoyed, half giving up the losing battle and completely resigning to his fate that he is just never going to get out of talking to Steve about his relationship.
Yet, as he kisses his son’s soft brown hair, Tony has accepted that it was beyond him to undo or reverse what he did not understand to begin with. He did everything that he could, he paid a huge price for it, but life had to go on.
, hates you. If anything he probably thinks you're a bag of dicks -which is fair because you are- but he's grateful for what you did. You know, the whole Time Stone ….. thing,” Tony swivels his hand and swallows hard, hating that he can’t even bring the topic up without his breath going off rhythm. “You took a chance on me, not many would. And here we are. Instead of, well, arguably more deserving people.”
A red fire engine on the broad mahogany dinner table led the chaos in the silent cottage. It was the most modern piece of technology in the otherwise humble abode, mainly because it was completely taken apart - the chassis stripped to its bare bones to fit electromagnetic strips, the plastic tyres were being modified to be retractable and the engine bonnet now housed a mini reactor-like power source.
Steve lowers Peter to the ground and the little man hops happily on the gravel towards his Daddy, who was kneeling down with arms extended.
Shuri laughs and takes one glance at her brother, the King, who pretended to be affronted by the idea of his baby sister dating. "Why, do you have a son, Mr. Stark?"
Late afternoon of the day of the party, Tony unexpectedly paid a visit to Steve at his apartment just as the Captain finished showering. As soon as he heard Tony's
"Tony fits in perfectly. Frankly, I never thought I'd be attracted to anyone after the ice, let alone a man. It took me a while to admit it to myself. I never planned to fall in love with him Sam, but I did and it still scares me how much I need him."
Bucky's mouth stays open. He glances at Steve and back at Tony. Suddenly the whirring of the gears in his metal arm became more pronounced, likely because everyone had stopped breathing for a second.
"Papa, Uncle Wong showed me your statue earlier near the water fountains. Can we walk past it later?" Peter chirps as he feeds his Pop a blueberry before popping a diced watermelon for himself.
In the middle of an open field, under a bed of stars, in the cold dead of night. It couldn't get more cliched than that.
If Sokovia turned out to be one of those before-you-die kind of moments like New York, Tony was determined to go down on Steve one last time.
Opening one eye, he peeks at Laura Barton standing two feet away, a cup of steaming coffee in hand, appearing fully prepared to apologise, but she doesn’t. Tony extends an arm to take the coffee mug to stop her from handing it to him. It was unnecessary to add further awkwardness of him recoiling to an act of hospitality. He was embarrassed enough having been caught choking on fresh air and daisies.
"Don't suppose you've got lube stashed somewhere in that fancy coat of yours," Bucky says with a straight face, rolling his shoulder and flexing his cybernetic limb.
“But hey, I wiggled you an all-you-can-eat cotton candy run. Whaddya say baby?” Tony says, extending his arms to pluck Peter off of Bucky. Peter’s smile reappears as he slides off his godfather’s shoulders. Tony sits him against his hip as he passes the bag full of stuffed animals, a water bottle and extra clothes to Bucky.
Tony's two slick fingers easily slid into Steve's entrance, earning a loud gasp, and Steve, ever so impatient, wiggled his ass before pushing down, fucking himself over Tony's fingers wantonly.
As for Steve Rogers, Tony still loved the man with every fibre of his soul, despite the Lie and every punch that Steve hit him with to protect his buddy. Of course if he was being dramatic about the entire thing, Tony could whinge on the fact that Steve trashed his suit with his bare hands for another man. Then again, Tony left Steve pretty bloodied himself. He even shot Steve at the ribs with a repulser.
As he panics, he pushes himself up, forgetting that Steve was 2 seconds away from coming into his ass. The movement was enough to tip the soldier over and he comes like a geyser halfway into Tony's ass and all over the man's thighs as he pulls out. He tries so hard not to make a sound, given how the moment went from erotically passionate to downright embarrassing but he lets out a silent groan. Using the blankets that were kicked to the edge of the bed to hastily wipe off the traces of semen, he then conceals his husband's nakedness that was directly exposed to three other men, one of whom Steve made no effort of concealing his utter dislike against.
Stephen Strange barks out a laugh, but he didn't appreciate the snark. “I’m sorry if my job doesn’t end after one galactic catastrophe. It doesn't grant me the luxury of retiring and getting hitched, either.”
"NO WAY," Natasha says, punching Sam hard on the arm, her mouth opened so wide that bugs could have easily crawled into it. Mouth still hanging, she turns to look at Steve, who had buried his face in his hands, wishing for death. "
Like clockwork, a heavy tear drop escapes and streams down his cheek. Steve quickly wipes his eyes, sniffles through his nose. The sight just melts Tony into a puddle and he crawls over to Steve on his knees, taking his hands into his own as he kneels in front of the man.
The very next hour, a memo went out to the team prohibiting any act of going through walls, citing privacy laws. Nobody responded to the email but Tony himself, who wasn't even present when the conversation took place, and he was surprisingly very casual about the entire thing.
He makes a mental note to introduce the two brilliant teenagers. At the end of the pleasant walk, Shuri was so smitten by Tony that she proposed that they meet again to compare notes on her Panther Habit and his Mark L suit. Tony was more than happy to set up a meeting, and since Shuri was more often than not in US thanks to the Outreach centre in Oakland, the meeting was genuinely in the books for the two intellectuals.
"Cut him some slack, Romanoff, our boy finally used that damn phone," Sam says, a smile in his voice emanating from a different corner. "He's allowed to be weirder than usual."
“No, no they’ve been doing these services before. To, you know, remember the soldiers who were identified and fought in the 2nd Titan wave - the ones who came back, the ones who never did. Jim goes to most of them, he will be in this one as well. I'm know this one has a special mention for Sam, honouring his service in the Army and with the Avengers and I would really like to be there. But the the whole 'the First Avenger making a rare appearance' news makes me uncomfortable - it's not about me at all. What if someone tracks me back here?"
"Congratulations I guess. Obviously, he's not the little kid from Brooklyn anymore and he doesn't need me to watch over him. That doesn't mean I'll stop doing it."
“You do have a reputation of being a terrible kisser,” Tony says, drawing Steve out of his head. “But
He hugs his baby boy closer as he moves from the window to the kitchen aisle. He glances over at the fire engine - makes a mental note to repaint the bonnet in red white and blue- and opens the fridge with one hand, while cradling his son on the other.
The images of the shield slamming down on him, Steve's back as he walks away from Tony with another man in his arms were brutally vivid in his mind; Tony could physically feel the freezing tundra seeping into his bones as he found himself standing in between his favourite orange Audi and 1965 Corvette Sting Ray Convertible. He leans against the former, confused as to how he got there from his work desk a few feet away and tries to focus on something to drain out the chaos in his head, but his vision begins to blur and nothing seemed to stay in one place for him to lock on to.
Tony starts to tremble above him, losing rhythm a little as Steve spreads precome leaking from the slit of their cocks. He starts to pump them slowly then grows faster, in time with Tony's thrusts. Amongst all of Steve's fantasies with Tony, most of them sexual of course, Steve has frequently fantasised about getting Tony off with his mouth. Handjobs occasionally. But this? This was definitely something Steve had never imagined.
"Why are you like this?" Tony demanded, following and cornering Steve in between the elevator doors after the Captain stormed out of their meeting. "There is a bigger picture here, Steve." Tony said, and it came out as a warning.
"Daddy - I'm, I'm close. Can I come in you, please," Steve gasps as he suckles Tony's neck, his hip thrusting quickly losing rhythm, because he was dangerously tipping over the edge that it began to hurt.
“Rogers,” Steve calls out to the senior man without preamble, before he starts his way back to the house.
Steve breaks his gaze from the flip phone, tiny in his large super soldier hands. He was doing it again – the brooding. At first, he would vehemently deny that he was doing it, nowadays Steve resigned to just shrugging off passing comments. He was tired of denying how he felt about the entire situation, tired of saying he was okay when in fact he was crumbling on the inside.
Tony clears his throat, finding the right words. "Got a message from him. He wants to meet up. See, we're trying to - we're trying -," Tony stops and rubs his palm across his mouth harshly. "
. I can never get enough of you. Tell me you love this sweetheart," Steve growls, his endearment for Tony whenever they fuck. Outside the bedroom, Steve was less casual with pet-names, even after all the years in between them. During their lovemaking though, Steve was anything but reserved - he was a dirty talker.
Thoughts of their cursed last brutal encounter brought along flashbacks of the trauma he endured, physically and emotionally, and soon his chest tightens, his breath becomes uneasy. As his hands turn icy, Tony presses his eyes shut as he counts in his head backwards from 10. He takes in deep, long breathes to regularise his shortening gasps.
They settle under a small tent where a makeshift cafe had planted itself under for a mid-afternoon snack.
you two?” Dr. Strange bemused, shaking his head with Wong in tow, holding the hand of the four year old Peter. The little Stark-Rogers, charming in his beige morning suit and cleanly parted hair, runs to his Papa to be scooped up and seated on his father's broad shoulders. Tony literally had to tip-toe to hand his boy the container of fruits, which the rugrat happily takes and hugs closely to his chest.
“Sorry,” Steve says, passing the phone from one gloved hand to another. He instinctively apologizes whenever he was caught pining away, though conscious of the fact that nobody has ever made a fuss over it.
"Good morning Sir, Captain Rogers," JARVIS suddenly speaks, halting any further movement from the two men. Mid-way with their tongues shoved down their throats, they blink at each other momentarily before bursting into a laugh and drawing apart.
"I knew that," Peter answers all too quickly, but his cheeks gradually turned pink against his pasty white skin.
"By the way Doc, can you portal me to Wakanda after this? I might need Shuri to give me another brain wipe to get that image-"
“Okay pal, calm down,” Bucky says, turning to Tony. “You wanna take this one?” He asks as he nudges towards the bumper cars, feeling bad for stealing Tony’s thunder on his day out with his own kid.
“What if, what if I hadn’t had a lot to drink?" Tony asks sedately, hips still leisurely riding the wave of Steve's pleasure. "If it wasn’t late and there was no party, just you and me. Would you kiss me, Steve?” Tony asks, a glaze over his eyes but he looks so damn sexy, he feels so damn good that Steve just licks his lips in reply. Tony starts to really rut into him and Steve sinks his fingers into Tony's waist to keep him in place. In that moment, Steve decides that he was going to hell for encouraging this. He might as well have fun on the trip over. He bucks his hips up to meet Tony half way and they quickly fall into rhythm.
The cheeky man rolls his eyes. “I ate a shiton of Barton’s masala sausage rolls and my pants are killing me. You can stop clutching your pearls now, Cap.”
Tony remembers hyperventilating in his suit as his eyes darted between Steve's back walking away and the shield on the mat.
If you stare at that phone any longer, you’re going to burn a hole through it,” Sam says, his voice piercing through the silence of the balcony.
Then again, the average four year old did not have Tony Stark as a parent to give the modifications a personal touch.
Tony's megawatt smile appears. He kisses the tip of Steve's nose. "You're a tough nut to crack, Rogers. I've been pulling all the stops, dropping hints like a high schooler trying to get you to ask me out. I didn't even get to kiss you at midnight!"
Clint watches Tony's back as he steps out into the field, guessing that Tony was about to call the suit to leave. It suddenly hit him.
“Nothing," the soldier murmurs lazily in response. "Carry on," he adds in between kisses as he strokes Tony’s soft cock from underneath the genius’ silk boxers while he continues to suck hickeys along the line of Tony’s jaw - like it was the most natural thing to do in a kitchen setting. Steve then hooks his fingers over Tony's pants and drags them down in a sensual motion, wresting a happy sigh from the shorter man who seconds ago was minding his own business and innocently slicing fruits.
enjoy alcohol like a normal person. It's tiring to always be the sensible one, the sober one. Sometimes Steve missed being able to blame an external element as an excuse to give into his inhibitions, an excuse for poor behaviour.
“Uh, okay,” was all Steve could muster as blood steadily travels south on the fast track to sin. Choo choo.
Maybe both men weren't prepared to face the reality and challenges of being in a real relationship with each other.
t-today. I honestly forgot about you coming over and right now, I'm actually trying really hard not to freak out and have a heart attack.” He runs out of breathe, his voice was quaking, eyes watery and his lips quivered. He still tries to smile but a sob escapes him. He forces a breathy laugh, shaking his head.
could have stopped an international terrorist cum maniacal scientist? I don't know - but now you're all
, as Clint would term it - even though the countless drafts and unsent copies that laid waste on the floor of their base camps told a different story.
They both watch in surprise as Peter yawns and nuzzles his way into his Daddy's arms, falling asleep. They share a look, and began packing their stuff to head home.
It did not escape Sam that Steve's quarters has significantly improved over the past month or two - the furniture was unlike any that Sam had seen before within the Compound. He's hung out at Rhodey's place, Nat's, even Vision's -  and though he's never been in Tony's suite, he had a feeling the billionaire had a lot to do with the facelift that only Steve's apartment seemed to have received.
“No. You are going in there, kid. I did this with Harry and I am going to lose him to the war starting. You are going up the stairs and speaking to the headmaster right now. Understand?” Hagrid told her in his best professor voice.
“Luna!” Peter yelled and smiled. He was dressed like Natsu from Fairy Tail. “You ready to go out? Big two-year anniversary. Well… and the Halloween bash there putting on.”
“It is. I want to be home here and go to Midtown High and then go to MIT like you did. Undergraduate in the arts so I can keep drawing,”
Hermione, Harry, and Ron bumped into the shelves holding the magic balls up. The sudden jolt caused the whole room to do a chain reaction. Soon enough all of the balls were falling down breaking into a million pieces.
“He is stable… but I am going to need blood from the twins.” Bruce looked around. “Where are your kids?”
“Tony, now that everyone knows you can come back to the tower to live with us.” Bruce smiled. “I know the lab misses you.”
The drive was quiet. Normally she would talk his ear off, but today didn’t seem right to her. It was like everything was against her. Something just seemed off in every single way. She went inside the school and went to first period sitting next to Peter.
Tony slept the whole flight with an IV in his arm giving him fluids. He only woke up when the plane landed with a big thump. Tony sat up and looked around. “Where are we, Sam?”
“You don’t have to do that, Violet. I was gonna do it after I cleaned everything else. Go play if you want.” Tony told her keeping a smile on his face.
“Lu!” A familiar voice yelled from in front of her. She could hear the footsteps getting closer and closer to her. “Lu! It’s Bucky! Are you okay?”
“I will,” she coughed and held the blanket closer to her. She watched as Peter left waving to her. Leaning back into her pillow she put on the tv watching reruns of Fairy Tail.
He helped Violet into the fighting ring and let the force field go up that held them in the ring. Each of them tied to the other side of the ring not being able to touch one another.
“Yes. Trust me when I say you have a party trick.” Steve told him and kissed his head. “What do you remember baby boy?”
“Daddy…” he cried and gripped Tony’s shirt shaking. “No, no, please dad! I don’t wanna go. I don’t wanna go!”
“Violet, Peter listen. Go tell the waiters that your Papa is having a panic attack to have them get everyone out of there seats and to the front car that we will pay for everyone to go again.”
“I would like that very much. Don’t let me dads scare you off. Understand?” Luna went on her tiptoes and kissed his cheek than skipped inside yelling at the top of her lungs. “See you soon!”
“Sometimes my teammates don’t tell me everything, Tony. Why didn’t you tell anyone you were sick?! Have a concussion no less! I needed to know! We needed to know! I was hoping out of everyone on the team that would be an exception! You use to tell me things all the time.”
The next morning Tony and Steve sat in the back seat of the car while Happy drove. They weren’t leaving New York. They headed right into Brooklyn.
“I see a Lovegood, Stark-Rogers…” the Sorting Hat began. “What should I do with you? Are you as smart as your father or as brave as your Papa… you have the brains, but the bravery isn’t developed. Ravenclaw!”
“Tony, I-” Steve began, but the elevator closed before he could finish. He sighed and got up. “Yeah, court.”
“Sir you already have a party for your co-workers aligned up. You can not bail on it now. Decides, sir I want to celebrate with you.” Jarvis smiles and patted his back.
“But, I don’t wanna go and neither do you,” Tony told him and gripped Steve’s hand lay them between the two of them. “You said if we do anything it would be together. We would Avenge together and we would win and lose together.”
“Луна,” Natasha whispered and took the girl from Bucky. “Your aunt has you. Bucky go get back to the fight. Bruce and I have her.”
Luna slowly woke up in her bed at the compound. She liked that her dad was sleeping next to her just like she did when she was first brought home. Curling into his side, he wrapped his arm around her smiling.
“Anyway! I- we need you to decide who you are gonna live with even though Steve is gonna be living under us eight floors.” Tony looked at them. “We won’t be mad either way.”
“There you both are.” May smiled and pulled them both into a hug. She was dressed as Ariel from the Little Mermaid since Bruce and Natasha were going as Kim Possible. “Clint, Robin Hood really?”
“Well, when we open Avengers Land we have to be in our uniforms. But, we thought we could do something Disney in the parks. Anything for Comic-Con though. We are excited about whatever you want us to do or dress up as.”
Reaching over to grab the glass of water next to him, but ended up dropping the glass onto the floor spilling the water everywhere. The glass shattered into a million pieces on the floor. The man watching him turned around and grinned. “Your mechanical heart really does work. Amazing.”
A projector displayed the building's plans. “Well if I change floor 50 through 70 we can make mini homes and training places for everyone. We can all live under one roof.”
“It’s hero time! Ta ta for now!” Peter wrapped his arm around Violet and swung them away trying to find the cry.
“Cap. Let’s go.” Tony flew behind him and started taking down the floating bikes while Steve handled the soldiers falling off of them with Nat, and Hawkeye’s help. Ant-Man and Wasp were fighting the monsters that kept coming through the hole.
Tony sighed and walked out of the bedroom and held his arms. When he walked down to the kitchen his heart stopped.
“Leave her alone, Draco!” The girl behind her yelled at him. Taking Luna’s hand the girl smiled. “Come sit with us. He won’t mess with you when you're with us.”
“No one can. Come on your making a scene.” Clint told him and pulled Tony to his feet. “You need coffee, and to sit back up in the waiting room.”
“You didn’t. I promise you didn’t. Why don’t we turn on the TV and have you watch that?” Steve asked her.
Going inside he saw Peter was in Steve’s arms. Bruce was working with our daughter. “Why aren’t they crying? Bruce what the hell is going on?!” Tony asked looking at Bruce.
Tony let go of Steve and Rhodey and walked upstairs to his bedroom changing into jeans and a red and yellow Stark Industries shirt.
All I could do was give a nod. That meant something happened. His cancer. “D-did it have something to do with Tony’s health?” I asked gripping my arms trying to hide how upset I was.
“We noticed,” Clint told him and sighed on the headset. “All of them are down. Anyone have any humans?”
“I get married to Violet like you and Daddy?” Peter asked and kept eating his plate full of pancakes.
She held onto his shirt and looked around curiously. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry,” Violet kept whispering into his shoulder.
“No. Purple.” She whined cranky from the flight where all she did was scream and cry. Tony was happy they were in his private jet or it would have been embarrassing.
The medical team sat Tony in the sand then walked away letting the two have their time together, but waited for the signal to go back to take Tony’s body. Steve held Tony as they sat in the sand watching the sunrise. Just as the sun's reflection started glistening on the water Tony started breathing lighter. He was struggling more and more.
I protected myself while keeping tabs on Peter. I forced myself to be born early so then Peter and I wouldn’t be twins and no one would ever think of it. I took the syringe out of my bag that I have carried for the past three and inserted it into the toddler's body.
Tony, Bruce, Nat, Wanda, Clint, and Bucky was helping pack up the Stark Tower for the move as soon as the babies are born. None of them wanted to see the family move, but they knew it was for the babies safety. Tony has made it so then it would look like he was still living here. He gave the tower to Bruce and Nat so they could have a home together with a lab for him, but everything was still in Tony’s name.
“Major Gilbert Bougainvillea. I am the Major of one of Hydra’s armies. I was forced into this position by my father. I never wanted to hurt anyone.”
“Yes. Make a bomb and I’ll live. Got it. But out of curiosity what would happen after I made the bomb.” Tony told them and started to work.
Steve picked up Peter and ran into the elevator playing the game with them. Peter squealed as they rode the elevator up to the house. “Papa I hear daddy!” Peter squealed and ran into the kitchen once the doors open.
“What’s the last thing you remember?” Tony asked her and helped Steve stand up and guided him to the bed.
“I want to grow up with a normal life and be happy with you. You were depressed for years, then MJ showed up and you started being happy again. I couldn’t make you happy. I still can’t, clearly.” I whispered. “If I had known you didn’t want this I would have never quit everything that defined me. I would have been married by now! I would have had another kid! I wouldn’t have close Stark Industries this week since you left me to do everything!”
"That's not an answer, Tony. Just remember what I told you, alright? We're here. I swear it Tony I'll put on the Rescue suit if you so much as break a nail. You hear me? Jim and I will take our suits to Wakanda, AND we'll bring Veronica."
"Tony, I'm talking about your heart. I really don't like this - the idea of you going alone is seriously scary. Rhodey is going to lose it when he finds out, I don't even know how I'm going to explain this to him."
Peter obediently nods and makes a dash to the minibar - by now he knows his way around Tony's garage, his workshop, the mansion even - and grabs two bottles of water; he twists the cap open before he passes one to Tony. As Tony drinks the last gulp of water from that bottle, Peter instantly hands him the other bottle, to which Tony raises an eyebrow to.
"Or I can sit over there and be really quiet, not a problem.” Peter shoves the phone back into his back pocket and twiddles his thumbs innocently.
however she is making her way to the deck. Agent Hill has requested for Captain Rogers to be present, if possible. Estimated time of arrival at hangar 2 in 15 minutes."
“Ohh yes baby I’m all yours. All yours baby open me up, that’s it. That’s it baby,” Tony purrs in encouragement before Steve introduces two slicked fingers without warning, deep into the hot burrows of Tony’s ass. "Fuck fuck fuck fuck." Tony moans as he clenches around Steve's fingers, feeling the burn and pleasure in equal parts as Steve brushes against his prostate. Tony pants heavily, drool dripping from his arm that he was biting to keep his voice down.
” Tony begins to read but stops midway. He clears his throat and decides against vocalizing the rest of the invitation, careful not to trigger his anxiety. “This is a big, huge deal, babe. You have to go,” Tony says, as he approaches the bathroom.
By this time, Tony and Steve had just started exploring their relationship and Steve was really looking forward to being alone with Tony again. To Steve's disappointment, Tony did not appear as eager, choosing instead to lock himself up in the lab with Bruce the second they returned to base, to study the alien weapon. Of course at that time, Steve had no idea what Wanda Maximoff had done to Tony that drove him deep into his mind to create Ultron.
"Well I did promise you dinner," Tony hummed low as he licked Steve's lips, and sucked Steve's tongue like hard candy when he gained entrance. His hands meanwhile began unravelling Steve's naked waist as they kissed, and soon the towel was discarded haphazardly.
A heavy tear flows over Tony's left lower lash, and the hurting man quickly wiped the drop away, hiding his pain from the shadows of the night.
Of course that remark completely flew over Steve's head, so as soon as Bucky was down the stairs and out of sight, Steve awkwardly invites the billionaire in. He offers to take Tony's coat but without pause, reaches for Tony's shoulders to peel it off. They really shouldn't be this domesticated around each other, but that was exactly what this visit was about.
Tony thinks, but bitterly. He's barely spent 5 minutes at the Tower since they broke up - since Tony angrily told Steve to leave that early Thursday morning. And Steve just stood there by the bed, silently challenging him to mean it this time. But Tony never means it. And Steve knows this.
Tony shivers at the memories and steps out of the armour, piece by piece, and takes a long, deep breathe of fresh air. His mind fought to be at ease, but he was feeling much better with his limbs free from the encasing metal. Yet at the back of his throat, Tony desperately needs to vomit. As soon as Tony steps through the entrance of his penthouse, he was ready to lift his shirt over his head and get into the shower but his halts as his eye caught sight of a familiar redhead.
"But she's ... only due two months from now! Right?" Tony cries in disbelief, turning to his husband for confirmation but Steve was already halfway out of bed and into his sweatpants. "Where is she? How's the baby?" Tony asks desperately, returning his gaze to his best friend.
"I would expect this from you Stark, given your pre-marital activities." Tony's mouth drops to protest, but Strange continues. "But the fact that I have to go back in time to fix all the damages this sacred Sanctum has to suffer after every trip you make here, I also have to relive the two of you having sex and it's kind of difficult to ignore the little conversations I'm forced to hear." The wizard tugs the container back towards him and angrily plucks a grape. "So could you
. The only reason Steve even noticed Sam's presence that fateful evening was because the elevator was in his (half-lidded) line of vision and his eidetic memory forbade him to forget things; otherwise, Steve could barely remember his own name by the time Tony was done with him that night.
Sam pats him on the shoulder. "Think of the last time that you didn’t, and where you ended up for it.”
, but he bites his tongue. He begins to regret entertaining the idea that all this interaction was going to lead to a happily ever after. Tony was tipsy. He may or may not regret tonight when he sobers up, but Steve could already imagine himself replaying this moment for months to come with a tub of ice cream in hand if it turns out that Tony really didn't feel the same way.
Tony lays on him, cum be damned, and they kiss languidly to calm themselves from the high. When they break for air, Steve has a loopy grin on his face.
Tony walks out the front door confidently. In his stride, he momentarily forgets that he was barefoot, in his bathrobe over a loose sweater and silk pants while Peter was only in his pajamas. Tony instantly regrets not grabbing a blanket for the toddler before stepping out when he felt a gush of cool air.
"Happy."  Tony barks out a laugh at the idea and Pepper joins him, but she was visibly worry-stricken.
"You heard me. Your baby's on the way, guys," Rhodey says, beaming the biggest, proudest smile across his face.
Steve emerges from it, ushering their son out and closing the door behind him. Peter hops back to the living room dragging a new set of pajamas with him, leaving his parents to talk. “Yeah I thought about it but I was put off when Jim told me they’d publicised my appearance even before I got the invitation.”
The flashbacks were so savage that a permanent frown line began to appear between his eyebrows [he frowned
"You know what, so are you," Tony's says, neutrally. "And this is a pretty shitty secret lair, by the way. I mean, dingy apartment at the wrong side of town? Cliched, even for a man who looks perpetually constipated, swinging a metal arm. Which, by the way, needs to be looked at. I can hear you scratch your ass seven floors down from the sidewalk.
"Morning," Steve says, voice thick from sleep, to nobody in particular. "Ughh," he groans as he swings his legs off the couch, carefully holding the blanket against his crotch as he makes his way to the toilet. A long train drapes across the living room, following him into the toilet.
"Take the suit with you when you go to him. Don't let him sweet-talk you into anything. Don't beat the crap out of each other again either. You will be okay Tony, you'll figure it out and come on top of this like you always do."
He instantly regrets it. He snaps his head away, takes a long slow but deep breathe before meeting Clint in the eyes. "And the good ol' Cap... was
. But when Tony bends to plant soft kisses all the way down Steve's chest and traces his tongue over Steve's nipple, he was rewarded with soft moans. The moans were dialled up to 11 when Tony decides to play dirty and sucked hard at the nub whilst reaching down to stroke the Steve's hard erection.
, Tony curses to himself, realising he's forgotten about their appointment today. And it's actually been rescheduled twice now.
Steve wasted no time in making a grab for Tony's boxers and stripping the man with military efficiency.
He was relieved that the supersoldier did not shove him away. That would result in many broken bones and a lot of explaining to do.
Tony remembers the soft blue eyes pleading that Tony lets him in, to hold no more secrets between them.
This makes Steve laugh into his beer as he tilts the bottle for a drink. It was the way Tony had said it, with his fingers dancing in front of Steve’s face accompanied by a deep, mysterious tone to his voice. It reminds Steve of a character from Sesame Street, the Count, and the lengthy conversation he's had with Tony over breakfast one morning as to why Sesame Street and the Muppets are not one and the same.
“Same, babe,” Tony says, before tipping his head and kissing his husband open-mouthedly and sucking the air out of his lungs. Steve returns the kiss, tongue diving into Tony’s mouth as he slowly backs Tony against the armchair to slowly make out. Before it could get any steamier, a loud throat clear booms across the room and it breaks the couple apart.
"Fuck you, you weirdo," Tony retorts, laughing for real this time as the Sorcerer Supreme unlocks the Eye of Agamoto.
When they were toe to toe, Tony bracketed Steve's waist with his calloused, engineer hands and tilted his head up, asking for a kiss from the taller man. They tipped their noses, trying to determine which angle was going to make the other person taste the best, breathing each other other in.
Sam swiftly gathers the plug and the note, puts them back into the box and hands it to Steve before he gets off the couch to head for the door. "I just remembered about those case notes on Barnes that just got delivered to me that I need to go over. I think it's the breakthrough you're waiting for. Meanwhile, enjoy the rest of the evening Steve. I'm sure you'll figure out your birthday present before he gets back," Sam says, pointing at the card that Steve was now holding.
"Fuck," Steve hisses, rutting his dick against Tony's perineum, grazing Tony's balls and their cocks bounce off against each other. "Love making you feel good Tony, calling my name. Love it that you're so loud, that I make you feel that way."
Tony raises an eyebrow behind his tinted glasses and tugs the container closer to his being with one finger. "Come again?"
Natasha allows herself one last half-smirk. Her mind travels far after that, Steve could guess why, and the boxcar fell silent again with only the sound of the locomotive engine and screeching metal filling the air.
“Tony?” Steve says, his voice raspy. Tony stills, remembering that Steve's senses were enhanced - in
Above all, he was so, so tired of not being able to admit that he painfully missed a certain brunette.
"Thank you," Tony says, quickly taking a gulp of the piping hot beverage. He's always enjoyed the burn down his throat. Thinking of
"Stark, you may not believe it but I do have a sense of self-preservation. I'm not just saying this to piss you off - man, I am
Because it was equally quiet where Steve was calling, he could hear Steve's irregular breathing and in his attempt to force a breath in through one nostril, a clear sniffle escaped.
He hadn't thought that far. His brain just went into overdrive when he saw Steve the day the SecGen called them for a meeting at the compound and sprung the Accords on them. All he knew was that he never stopped loving the man that was Steve Rogers, even after they parted ways to an understanding that they wanted separate things in life.
on the internet,” Tony insists, as he dangles his face in front of Steve and closing in to Steve's personal space on an intimate level, sending a chill down the super soldier's spine. A good sort of chill, the sort of chill that makes him twitch in his jeans. “Something nobody else knows,” he adds, two octaves lower.
At the last word, Steve walks in, a stoic expression in his face – a clear sign he had been listening from somewhere mid-conversation and wasn't too impressed at what the Dr may have been implying about his husband or his choice to give up Avenging to start a family. It was a touchy subject; at one point, Steve and Tony had different ideas as to how they saw their relationship and it has taken them a long, painful journey to come to a compromise that ended with them finally quitting the Avengers, tying the knot and eventually adopting the light of their life, Peter.
?" Tony flares. "Barton, stop. Stop while you're ahead. I mean it, just stay out of trouble. It can't be that hard," Tony says before muttering into his comm .
“You guys talk though, right? About stuff you’re comfortable doing, stuff he likes, or doesn’t like. Talk to him, talk about boundaries and all that jazz. He gave you a butt plug for your birthday – which was a week ago – and you haven’t talked to him about it since?” Sam queries.
….” Peter says defensively, recalling his white lie a couple of months ago that ended with a ferry full of passengers splitting in half over the Hudson river. He doesn't finish his sentence and the room fell into uncomfortable silence.
“'S your unlucky night, Tony. Don’t have one,” Steve says, shrugging Tony off. He takes another gulp of his beverage to play it cool.
“Well in all fairness, Steve thought I was an ass too when we first met,” Tony remembers. “Before I stopped being a metaphoric ass and he fell in love with the real stuff.” The wizard's face twisted in disgust and he was about to retort but Tony holds a finger up. “
," Steve whimpered, his one hand giving a death grip on the headboard of the sofa and the other landed on the the dark brown hair as Tony's head started to bob.
Steve's voice was cracked and shaken. For a split second Tony held the phone away from his face to look at the grainy caller ID for the sake of visual confirmation. Not that he needed it - he was simultaneously relieved and irritated to hear that voice he'd recognise anywhere.
“You know what they say, when in doubt, ask Lord Google,” Sam cracks a joke to himself, settling for season 2 of Say Yes to the Dress.
"Not since he rammed his shield to my chest, no. Why, does Captain America sends his love?" Tony mock-laughs.
"I didn't want to lose him. In the end I lost him all the same. I broke him." Steve whispers, his eyes warming up.
"Steve, I'm sorry. The stuff I said - the last thing I want is for you to leave me the fuck alone. I don't want that. Avoiding you-"
The same can be said for Tony's but his boxers weren't as snug as the blond's. Steve was dying of ecstasy underneath Tony, writhing and mumbling sweet nothings to the thought of being taken like this.
He limps towards the dining table and tosses the kitchen towel over his shoulder before dropping into a seat to join Tony. The brunette raises his eyes from the StarkPad he was reading from, his glasses still resting on the tip of his nose, to study the exasperation mapped across his partner’s face. He minimises the email to divert his attention to Steve.
nd wanted to steal you away from him. Didn't even know you two were ever romantically involved. And besides, I vividly remember calling you a douchebag in the middle of it all and you know what they say about first impressions.”
"Sounds good," Steve says, nuzzling into Tony's neck and melting into his body. Tony kisses the crown of his head and breathe in the scent of sex and sweat. "I'd uh I'd like that very much," Steve adds.
to serve my country, to protect those in need. I was given the ability to do what most people can't, so unlike Tony I wasn't born with this," Steve says, displaying himself - physically perfect and deadly. "When I signed up for Rebirth, I made a conscious choice. This is my purpose, this is what I'm meant to do."
What was intended to be a moment to reinforce camaraderie somehow ended up with him having incredulous, hot sex with Captain America.
"On one hand, you kicked yourself so hard thinking you didn't do enough when the Mandarin happened that you feel responsible for the whole thing - how exactly
"I want to be with you, Tony. I want what you want," Steve breathes, burying himself against Tony's neck, sinking his teeth against the skin and suckling a bruise into it.
Steve passed him an accusing look, unable to withhold his frown. “Why did you order so much for yourself in the first place?”
“I came to the kitchen for a snack,” Steve replies carelessly, "And I'm getting my snack," he finishes before he spreads Tony’s ass cheeks apart. He gives Tony a slow wet lick across his hole, taking his time dragging his tongue across and back, lavishing the entrance over and over before he pushes his tongue in. Once he hears a positively dirty moan from Tony, Steve began kneading Tony's ass harshly as he circles his tongue and prodded Tony's hole with his thumb. It drew a hoarse cry from his older lover, and soon Tony was gasping and moaning because Steve was mercilessly sucking on his entrance and rubbing his thumb into the rim in preparation for further penetration.
Tony looks at the kid and smiles weakly. "Talking about him to someone does help." The dog tags hung low against his chest now, and Tony caresses the surface of the plates where
It didn’t matter that he had scurried into the shower and hastily changed into his nicest soft button shirt and best jeans for the dinner.
“Please Stephen," Tony pleads his case. "You’d bend time and reality to fix cum stains but you won’t set us back a little bit? It's a small party trick on the grand scheme of things," he bargains, his voice strained to a whisper.
, j-just don't stop baby please. Fuckmefuckmefuckme," Tony begs to the rhythm of Steve's hips thrusting into him. Steve dutifully complies, jabbing Tony's prostate over and over again in an increasingly rapid motion. Soon the rattling sound of the phone was drowned by Tony's moans and Steve was quickly inching closer to his 5th? 6th orgasm? Didn't matter. His balls were tightening and he knew he was going to blow his load anytime now.
Then with more heart. "That I miss you? That seeing you again at the compound after so long made me want to crawl my way back to you at any given opportunity?"
"I'm a mess Peter. You really shouldn't be hanging out here too much; I'm really not the best example of a functioning adult right now. Or ever. Hah - joke's on me.  It actually scares me that you once said you wanna be like me while I have no fucking clue what I'm doing these days. I'm not even supposed to swear in front of a kid but I just did. See where I'm getting at?"
,” Tony begins, brushing off Steve’s protest like he didn’t hear it. “- to re-enact the famous Captain America-Black Widow Escalator Kiss.”
"You were building a new team for the Avengers so you can retire peacefully," she finishes, reading his mind. "Tony ... does Steve realises that while he could probably live until 200,
What he actually wanted to say was there were three other people who could walk in on them in this very compromising position, one of them was their infant son. The nightmare of every parent.
Peter was visibly concerned. "Mr. Stark, we can do it some other time. I can go but do you need me to call somebody? I can get Happy, he's just out -”
"Off," Tony commands, finally deciding. Steve gets his drift and starts with his shirt. He  gets impatient halfway through that he nearly rips the buttons off. Tony kneels away to allow the super soldier to strip his pants in peace, and once they were both less clothed, Tony climbs back on top of Steve.  This time he hooks Steve's knees upwards and spreads the man's legs over his thighs.
Whilst she strongly disagrees with the methods of restraining her husband ("That's a little extreme isn't it?"), she accepted that every action held consequences. She told Tony that she tried very hard to persuade Clint from leaving that day, pulling all the stops. She reminded him of his many broken promises in the past to the children, to her.
"Can we skip to your other promise please?" Steve breathed, before he returned the kiss, filthy and desperate.
“But Uncle Thor can lift the hammer because he’s worthy,” Peter reasons, catching Tony off-guard. “And he’s a god.”
His body floated in the Iron Man armour as FRIDAY navigates it back to the sterling building that he owns, once a beacon of hope for the city that almost got wiped out from the map five years ago. A city he helped save, at the near cost of his own life. The Tower, now on the market, still bears the Avengers logo on it even though it has long been vacated from any superhero activity. For a while Tony did take up residence there, but it has been nearly a year since he stepped foot in the premises, opting to instead move into his family mansion a half hour drive away.
“This isn’t an AirB&B Stark. You’re more than welcomed to pack your bags and check into proper accommodation where you and your lovely spouse can stain the walls for someone else to clean.”
Tony watches Steve walking over into the driveway with their son held protectively, wearing an unbuttoned chequered flannel shirt (sometimes Tony thinks Seve overdoes this whole living on a farm thing down to its fashion sense) over a well loved dark Stark Industries tshirt and sweatpants that accentuated his ass for all it’s glory and for Tony’s eyes only.
“Bucky let’s go, let’s gooooo!” Peter exclaims, patting the ex-assassin on the top of his head as he pointed at the next ride on his mental list. It’s a good thing Bucky sports a shorter hair cut now; Peter really loved shoulder rides – he would climb over Steve whenever he could, and would do the same with Bucky. Right now Peter was literally bouncing in excitement, his tiny feet kicking into Bucky's chest as clammy hands draped along Bucky’s face.
Because he’s heard all about that time Tony patiently sat down with Steve going through Amazon and Ebay for hours, teaching him about the wonders of the world wide web and online shopping, and thereafter granting him full access to the billionaire’s Centurion card if Steve ever wanted to get anything for himself. Steve went on and on to Sam about how much he appreciated Tony making time for him despite the businessman's hectic schedule, how sweet it was that Tony would lean on his shoulder as they clicked through the webpages - not that Sam had asked.
So Steve Rogers in fact, had a lot of game. He flirted with Tony all of last night, from the moment he walked into Tony's penthouse fresh out of the shower in his snug button shirt and jeans of sex, to the very last moment before he kissed Tony for the first time.
Violet stayed quiet and kept hugging Peter tight. She started falling asleep in Peter’s arms as she did two years ago when their parents fought in front of them. Peter lifted her legs up on to the bed and leaned his head on top of hers.
“Dad? Papa? You said you were done with one another. Are we going to be family now?” Peter asked them gripping two water bottles in his hand.
“Peter. She’s a wizard,” Steve told him and looked down at his feet. “She’ll be attending the same school you do after the holidays. She doesn’t like it at the school she’s at now.”
“Steve! Look at this! It’s a dress with the Avengers on it!” Tony was so happy he was almost jumping up and down out of his skin. Tony went to pick her up to try the dress on her but stopped at the aroma coming from her diaper. “Missy here needs a diaper change. It’s your turn, Stevie. I handled the last one that was all over her and the crib. Why can’t she say anything when she’s done. Peter does.”
“Does mother know you are wearing her dress?” Tony asked and snorted calling his suit to attach to his body.
They stood outside of the orphanage gripping one another’s hand. They were so nervous about going in that they didn’t move an inch. “What’s her name, Tony?” Steve asked holding his hand.
Peter rolled his eyes. “If you could see your face you would disagree. Even though y-your still cute.”
“I told you I saw them do things in the art room. I’m arm-less not blind.” She snapped and laid her head on him.
“J-Just us… and Lu,” Tony mumbled gripping the blanket. His body was starting to slowly shut down. Every breath was getting harder and harder to take. Not even the oxygen mask could make it easier for him. He was cold all the time now. He hated every second of it. “S-she needs to hurry… home.”
“Wanna play with the crayons on the floor?” Tony asked and got on the floor sitting on the play mat.
Jarvis spoke up in a calming voice. “Ms. Luna, you are at the compound. You are not alone. You are loved and around many people. Natasha and Steve are right in front of you while Mr. Peter is down the hall. Would you like to me notify him of your panic attack?”
“Step three. Special ingredient. Everyone has there special ingredient right?” Draco asked the group standing around them grinning.
Bucky grabbed Tony tight by the arm and walked behind the cars making sure he wouldn’t get shot in the process. The shots kept getting closer to them after every step.
“Marry me as soon as we get everything okay again,” Tony told him and took the water from him. “Jarvis you okay, pal?”
“When you will you take over Stark-Rogers Industries?” Lois asked while flipping to a clean piece of paper.
Tony kneeled and hugged him tightly. “I have you love. I truly do. Fuck…” Tony sat gripping his back. “I was gonna carry you, but I need you to carry me. I need my muscle relaxer.”
It wasn’t even an hour later when Bucky came back with the twins in hand. He had found them in a big spider web on the bench asleep. Violet was the only one awake out of the twins when they arrived at the hospital.
“Can we discuss their medical issues, please? I don’t think I can rest until I know.” Steve told Bruce and bounced his baby girl softly who didn’t react to Sam’s yelling.
Crab and Goyal let go of Luna’s wrists and grinned at the blonde haired boy. Draco kicked her back on to the ground as they all ran off. “BYE BOY!” She laid on the ground holding her side trying not to make any sounds.
“Yes. Flash said if we don’t see Santa that you would die. Cause you're like millions of years old.” Peter cried. “I don’t want you to die.”
Steve turned with fire in his eyes. “Leave my twins alone! Go bug someone else, please! My daughter is hurt and in pain and your not helping anything by asking a million fucking questions!”
The frail Stark-Rogers girl grew up faster than she was supposed too. Everyone in the Avengers including Happy became her guardian to make sure she was raised right. Luna went back to Hogwarts to gain her sight back from Dumbledore. He was more than happy to give it back to her. After the news went out again that there was a hidden daughter of the famous Stark-Rogers couple she graduated from Midtown High and went to MIT online schooling.
“I’m sorry about his outburst. Steve let’s go. Right now.” Tony grabbed Steve by his hood on hid hoodie dragging him out of the store while pushing the stroller. “Why didn’t you just go to the car?”
“We know who you are. We recruited you. Not the other way around. I’m Nick Fury. Call me Fury.” Fury told him pointed at each of the members when he spoke their name. “This is Natasha, Clint, Thor, Wanda, Dr. Strange, Dr. Banner, and Vision. These are your main associates.”
Violet waited for Steve to leave and looked up at Thor who was twiddling his thumbs. “Thor, wanna do something crazy?”
Steve sighed and whispered into her ear. “Baby you didn’t kill her. Loki did. Not you. You're sweet and adorable.”
“You can see, him, her when it is parents week, or on holidays along with summer,” he told them and smiled holding out the letter. “S-she will be starting in two weeks. If you follow the letter you can get to platform 9 and ¾.”
"Pepper would have loved it. Our daughter is going to grow up as brilliant and kind-hearted as her father, and strong, independent and lovely like her biological mother."
Just the very thought deflated Tony a little, but Steve's firm hand was jerking him off in a steady rhythm to keep him stiff.
Tony gulps. This was unchartered territory, and way to go Steve, nosediving right into the topic without a float.
Steve quickly checks the invitation card he had slotted into his jacket, glances at the grandfather's clock at the corner and tells Tony that they were supposed to be at the church
to Steve’s and if it wasn’t for the fact that they were sitting in the dark on the helipad of the Avengers Tower, the blush on the super soldier's face would have given away everything that he’s held inside, particularly the torch he's been holding for Tony.
Tony shrugs. “What did Papa say before he left? No solo rides buddy.” Peter’s face fell as he chews his little lips. “Petey, your Pop wants you safe. If you get hurt, Papa’s gonna freak out like he did the last time and he’ll
with acts of intimacy. Comically, Cap didn't even know the meaning of the phrase until he heard it in a song not too long ago and quizzed, of all people, Tony about it, knowing how Tony would not let it slide. Tony still feels bad for bursting into fits of giggles, but he made it up by sitting with the larger man later for hours browsing through Billboard Top 100 songs.
Steve nods, his cheeks bunching into a smile Tony truly, truly ached to see for the past three weeks. "I'm really happy you're here Tony. There was nothing tough or manly about the way I've been spending my time since we last spoke. Ask Bucky - I've been a mess. But I've also had the chance to really think about what you said."
Steve pokes his head out and nudges his chin towards Tony, seeking some clarity. Tony extracts the email from the StarkPad, converting it into a hologram for Steve’s benefit. “I must have missed this one. Rhodey's asking me to talk you into going for the special memorial service in Geneva?” Tony says, still half-way reading the appended email below Rhodey's.
”, Tony could have easily interpreted his intention of merely offering battle support, and nothing else. Steve’s choice of words in the Letter was carefully dictated given the circumstances of their final encounter -
They closed in on each other, finally at ease in silent agreement that last night was not a mistake on either part. That it was futile to continue denying that they were attracted to each other like moths to flames. Smiles formed in their faces as their telepathy seemed to work again, breathing into each other's spaces as they read each other's minds, which was solely projecting the other person at this point.
He needed to be sure, and until he was 100% certain, until he can figure out the best way to break the news to Tony, Steve was resolute to keep Bucky and Tony as far away from each other as possible. Even if that means sacrificing himself in the act.
Tony blinks. He zones out of his head and refocuses to see Bucky staring into the living room, his back against Tony. Slow turning around with a horrified expression across his face, Bucky stares at him.
The genius never felt stupider, and he sobered up immediately to apologize to both Peter and Happy before breaking down in a puddle of tears. Peter saw a vulnerable side of Tony Stark that afternoon, a very human side that newspapers rarely wrote about. He stood by the door, watching Happy crouch next to the broken man as he hugged his knees and sobbed, apologising over and over again for Siberia, for letting things go that far.
"Cap's a super soldier and all, but it takes JARVIS level of intelligence to hack into the Secretary of Defence and disable all those locks. Wanda's collar. Hence, it
“Parker, I'm gonna stop you right there,” Tony interrupts before crossing his arms and narrowing his eyes at the doe-eyed teen. “I wasn’t coming out to you."
Tony stretches a half-grin. “Oh I didn't. I'd totally given up on him by then,” he says casually as he settles into the seat. "I wasn't gonna ask him again."
Tony steps aside to let him through but Steve makes a quick dash to the storage behind the front door.
In Wakanda, Tony receives a grand welcome by the King himself, accompanied by his younger sibling. The princess was eager to meet the one and only Tony Stark, introducing herself without prompt and Tony took an instant liking to the wise-cracking teenager, far beyond her years much like he was at her age, but smarter. The pair kicked off quickly, leaving T'Challa and Okoye tailing them loosely from behind as the two geniuses dived into their language of science, briefly distracted from the real purpose behind Tony's presence in the kingdom.
“I told you, as I’ve told Steve Rogers repeatedly – it was nothing personal. It needed to be done. I didn’t save your life because I thought you were
He was still haunted by the fear in Tony’s eyes as he fell over the bloodied man in the cold winds of Siberia.
as confirmed by last night's romp - and he may have realised, without needing to look, that Tony was already awake and making stupid faces from the other side of the bed.
"I know you and I don't really see eye to eye on things, but Stevie's all I've got, Stark. He's an idiot who thinks he's right all the time. But he's loyal to a fault. He's a good egg, the best kind, but he can also be an obnoxious punk who needs someone to anchor him. If you can be that person for him, I wouldn't have to worry about him too much."
Horror shot through there faces. Tony’s heart seemed to skip a beat. He knew he needed a real lawyer.
“Love? What is love? Major… I don’t understand! I don’t know… what love means!” She screamed looking at him sobbing. “Major!” She gasped and held her throat as she fell to her side.
“We can ask, Bruce,” Tony told her and walked over and kneeled in front of her. “You don’t have to be afraid of your powers. We can try some new training.”
“That was why. Thank you for confirming he’s safe. If you hear from him tell him I love him,” Luna told him and walked out of the office.
Tony sat back tapping his chin watching everyone. He started tapping his foot sighing. “We could build a tower. Not just any tower. My big ass tower. Jarvis brings up blueprints for Stark Industries subsection 52J.”
Peter shook his head and held his hand out to her. “There are more people inside wanting a picture with us.”
“Let it be on the record that I separated the twins. It was said that the twins could be not separated since they were attached at the hip to one another. I wanted to show the twins how it was to be separated from one another. To learn how to be different people though they are very different. It’s clear to me that the Rogers-Stark twins will be in the joint custody of Steven Rogers and Anthony Stark. Steven will have them the first two weeks of the month and Anthony will have the twins for the last two weeks. They will spend every other holiday with one of the parents. The next year it will flip for who gets them and so on.
“You ready to go drink?” Rhodey asked them while rolling his eyes. “I know I am. We can drink together. I didn’t think we were going to see the day.”
“You seem distracted. Are you okay?” Bucky asked him and sat next to Steve. “You can talk to us punk jr.”
“Friday? I forgot about you, old girl. How have you been?” Tony told her and pulled up another file on the computer bringing up the heat signature on the cameras.
“I hear them too…” Luna told them holding her wand tighter than before. She has never been afraid of dying up to this point, but whatever those voices wanted it wasn’t good.
She was glad her Stark-Tablet was able to read off her assignment. Otherwise, she would need someone else home with her. She hummed to the music while it played. Luna gasped and jumped up. “BLARE IT!”
It’s been two months since the honeymoon and the two were facing more problems than everything else. Steve has been sicker than a dog, some days not even getting out of bed. Today was one of those days that Steve could barely keep his eyes open. Tony being the man he is called Bruce to come look at his husband.
“NO!” Steve yelled then looked away blushing. “Sorry… it’s coming with us. I need it for the nightmares.”
I hate it. I rather die than be there, but for you... it's a different story. “It’s fine… I’m kind of glad you didn’t want to come to the parents week thing. You didn’t need to see any of that. I’m coming home for Christmas than graduating. I have been taking ten classes and passing them after four weeks. By Christmas, I will have finished everything. I am moving home and go to school here. To be home with you both.”
Tony nodded and kept looking at the tiled floor. He was numb from the fight in New York. “What are we doing? Fighting and saving the world? I couldn’t even save my kids. They were supposed to be safe in the tower. They are only ten… they shouldn’t live like this.”
“It won’t. I promise it won’t love. If it does she can always come home. She is always wanted. She knows that. I tell her that every time she leaves. Even if it’s just a room,” Steve whispered and kisses his head, “I love you.”
When the machine beeped it brought Tony back to the real world. He looked over to the test and sighed. Positive DNA match 87.98% match from both him and Steve. Tony turned and looked at the girl laying down and sighed. He knew they had a road ahead of them.
“Tony, she’s the one. I will do anything to adopt her. Sell my arm. Anything.” Steve whispered and walked over to the pair. “She’s a Stark.”
“No. I will just play the violin with headphones in. Please leave me alone.” Violet looked at them gripping her arms. “I’m sorry for waking you up, Hawkeye.”
“Hey, kiddo. Let’s get you home.” Happy smiled and got him in the car seat. “Tony, Steve let’s ride.”
He walked for what seemed like miles until he found a town nearby. Tony laid in the sand holding his chest. All he wanted to do was close his eyes and rest. “Steve I wanna have a family with you… I want a baby. I want to be a father. Better than mine. Save me.”
She rushed off the stage and into the bathroom sitting on the cold tile. Newt followed right behind her laying his head on top of her knees. “I know it wasn’t real. It’s just hard seeing and hearing him each time I unlock some life goal to him. Newt you are too cute to cry in front of.”
Steve sighed and looked down at the girl who was on the floor shaking. “Fine,” Steve put the handcuffs on her prosthetics and walked her up to the gym where everyone was waiting. Everyone stopped when they walked into the room.
Today was different though. It has been a month since Tony saw the twins. He was ready to win them back in court. He got up at 5:55 a.m. to get in the shower. He took a nice long hot shower to make sure everything on him was squeaky clean. When he got out the clock flashed 6:28 a.m. only three hours and two minutes until they would be in court together.
Dumbledore gave me a wish for my wedding. As long as it wasn’t evil he would grant it. After two months of being married and watching my Pops be sad, I can’t watch him anymore. So, I wrote him a letter.
Steve intervened knowing Peter didn’t want to tell anyone his identity especially after Aunt May had a cow finding out about him. “Hey, Lu. Come help Natasha real quick. Your dad needs to speak to Peter about the internship. See if they want pizza for dinner too!”
I told Peter that I would fix everything the day my fathers died of murder. I plan to keep that promise until I die. I lived in the time our fathers died in until we were fifty-seven years old. I found a cure of the serum inside our blood along with how to keep our fathers alive. We try so hard to do everything right, but nothing does.
“I know you do,” Tony sighed and pulled her into his lap on the wheelchair. “Just promise me you won’t take things to fast. I like my intern and don’t want to kill him if he ends up breaking your heart.”
“Never. You are our kid, Luna. We love you so much, Luna. I love you so much. We’re just moving among other things.” Steve whispered and pulled me into his famous bear hug. “There are so many things we need to tell you. Come lay in bed with us, Lu.”
“About sex?” Tony turned and nipped Steve’s ear. “Or about something more pressing? If it’s the second one can we have sex first?”
Tony began to panic but knew he needed to take a few deep breaths. Tumor? Focus he told himself and continued to work. He didn’t work on a bomb though. He made himself a new heart of his own design. Like from his companies at home. It took him ten days to make it all on his own without getting discovered. The guard watching him through the door window looked lost every time he was building something.
Bruce walked over and grabbed her hand. “Hey… shh, it’s okay. They can’t hurt you anymore. Remember your safe. Here with us.”
Tony sat back and stared at the operating room door. “Steve hates himself and blames himself for letting us both go. He thinks one of us should quit the Avengers. I-I think it’s going to be me. Steve needs to be with you guys.”
Peter smiled. “Okay! Thank you, ma’am! Pepper we gotta hide! She got her friends helping!” he giggled and ran out of the room gripping her coat.
“We don’t have the time. Natasha has the Quinjet and we have to go right now. You have clothes and a phone at home connected to the one here. Come on,” Bucky told me and we walked off the platform and over to where the Quinjet was landed.
Luna wore a t-shirt with the Iron-Man and Captain America symbol combined with tye-dyed red, yellow, blue and white. Her skirt was blue with white stars and Iron-Man’s mask around the bottom of the skirt. She wore a heeled boot: one red with yellow and one blue with white.
Fury pressed the button for his communicator. “Have the vans ready and back the public up the building is coming down.” He let go of the button and looked at the heroes. “I want everyone in those military vans. Let’s go.”
“That's not fair!” Peter yelled. “I told you I didn’t want to invent anymore and stopped. You were the one that told me it was fine!”
“You’ve got buffer… man. I could ravish you right now.” Tony whispered between breaths. Sitting on the tile Tony pulled Steve into his chest. “Don’t leave me. Don’t leave me, Steve. Don’t.”
Violet looked at the table and shook her head like she forgot what they were talking about. “… the red room. W-where… I bad,” She whispered and looked at the ground lost in thought.
Luna watched them and held her arms close to her chest. Not knowing what to say she stared at them from behind.
“As you both know… Papa and I aren’t getting along since Bucky came back in the picture…” Tony started.
“I know. He made a music video for the song,” She laughed and leaned into him more. “I’m glad I met you, and that I’m here today. Loving you. I wanna grow old with you. Watch our children and their children grow old. Maybe move back to the city. Buy back the tower… make it our home and keep the compound as a safe house. Give it to Charles Xavier for his academy. Make a mutant hospital. Do amazing things,”
The four of them sat in the back of the train by the kitchen, so no one could see them or identify them. They were singing the hot chocolate song when Steve’s phone started freaking out for the fourth time since they got on the train.
When the elevator ding went off she froze in her spot. Gripping the couch cushion making her fingertips white. Looking over she saw the light from her dad's chest.
“But you could have gotten hurt. You are hurt, Miss. You should know when your powers are giving out.” Steve put his hands on her knees, “I need you to talk to yourself.”
Steve and Tony, in his wheelchair, watched Luna that week talking and interacting with Peter during the move. Peter came every day to help unpack everything and smiled when Luna would walk out of the room. It was obvious to anyone watching the two interact that they were head over heels for one another. Natasha and Clint would snicker while Sam laughed at the two. Luna just shook her head and skipped around the compound.
During those months Luna applied to Midtown and got in with no problems. She was starting out a senior since she was well advanced over the senior classes, but she wanted to spend the rest of the year in high school. Wanting to say she at least went to high school once in her life was always a big dream for her. All of the teachers know just to call her Luna and not by her last name. All of the teachers and subs that they hire all had to sign and got paid up front to make sure they never speak about her.
Once Peter started talking and walking they let Happy return to his old job which he was over the moon with. Not wanting to babysit he would complain every day to the family how this wasn’t in his job description. Tony kept telling him that he didn’t have to show up and also did not need to get paid by him. Which shut Happy right up.
Steve and Tony held hands waving and stopping to answer questions and sign some autographs for the kids. Bruce, Nat, Vision, and Wanda right behind them waving and smiling big. Vision stayed close to Wadna not liking the flashes but knew he has to get used to it eventually.
Bucky took a deep breath and spoke to him trying his best not to break down upset with him. “Steve… it’s been four years since that day. There is so much that you’ve missed. I’m so sorry, Steve. I wanted to tell you because there’s something going on…”
“Violet, that's what she said her name is. She doesn’t talk though.” Peter looked up at them. “I like her!”
“There is nothing to be sorry about, Violet,” Tony whispered in her ear then spoke out loud. “Why don’t you sit here and I am just going to take a piece of your hair. Okay?”
As Tony went charging at the man he noticed that something seemed… off. That’s when Tony notice that he wasn’t there. It was just a hologram. Tony blasted the camera making the man disappear. Tony hit his com and started to speak. “Most of the men are holograms!”
“Peggy.” Steve gasped and cried harder into his shoulder. “She died two days ago and they didn’t tell me. That was her lawyer saying that she gave me trust funds for the twins. I never said goodbye! Goodbye…”
“You're famous. Why wouldn’t it be happening?” Bucky asked him and hiccuped. He drank more than anyone else.
“Peter, you have to promise to tell the truth while in that chair. Can you do that?” The judge asked while looking over at him.
Steve ran his hand through his hair. “Not my best parenting moment. I used my captain voice and she ran down here faster than I could talk.”
Peter took Newt’s leash and walked with them smiling. Luna kept walking towards the crowds taking pictures with everyone she saw with a phone. Peter looked at Ned and MJ who were dressed as Juvia and Gray.
“Well, your turning ten in a few days… and we both know how much you like your anime and all the same movies and shows as us…” Tony started
“Papa made pizza and you said it was the best you ever had that you could never forget it. How could you have forgotten it if it was the best you’ve ever had?”
The press was eating it up alive. They all wanted pictures of the hurt heroes from the battle. “Dr. Banner is inside,” Clark Kent told him and followed them keeping his camera on them the whole time.
Walking around at four in the morning was a great thing. Everything was very quiet and no one was up except who was patrolling the halls. Walking into the lab was nothing at all. No one was there to stop or even tell you no to coming in. Violet was able to go on the lab's computer and look into all S.H.I.E.L.D.S private information.
“Just us at Comic-Con then the others will join us. We are so excited to go see everything,” Steve told her and ran his fingers through her hair.
“Tony, you’ll be able to lead them right?” Pepper asked him while looking at her clipboard. “I’m trusting you both. Especially since your coming out as married for five years.”
Steve held the frail girl close in his arms as he rocked her back and forth. “I have you. I am so sorry about everything, Luna. I truly am. I promise to make everything up to you.”
Luna wheezed and held the paper bag in her hand tightly that she grabbed fro, the night stand. “Our wedding day. It’s two months away. I can hold out,”
“We both won’t be gone. I talk to some agent last night about adoption and I found the perfect little girl. She’s one, very much blonde. She can’t see two feet past her face, but she is adorable. They said it can take six months to get everything ready. We can go and meet her any time.”
Defeated she nodded and went up to the stairs slowly. Tapping each of the steps until she reached the top. She stood outside the door for a moment then reached her hand out slowly to knock when the door opened.
“Violet Maria Rogers-Stark, get downstairs now before I make you,” Steve told her in his best captain voice. They knew that one day she would manipulate them, but not this young.
“Your father is getting looked at. Nat and Clint went home. Bruce just got here from calming down. Thor took Loki home to his world. Bucky and Rhodey are still here though. Sam is helping everyone in the hospital who lost their homes. Pepper sends her love from California.” Steve told him and rubbed his hand.
“It’s moving to fast and heading towards New York. I’ve tried everything,” Steve whispered. “Your father and I will be waiting for you to join us. I’m glad you were our daughter. Luna, this is my choice. If I end up making it out of here we are getting ice cream for dinner for a month. I love you, my perfect angel.”
“There are twenty people in the tower. They shouldn’t be here. Your call what to do Capsicle.”  Tony told him and looked back at him.
“Alright. I’ll go get- never mind their he is out of the castle. Good thing I didn’t have to climb up your hair.” He grinned and walked over kissing his cheek. “Let’s eat Rapunzel.”
“I-I...” Luna whispered and sat in the chair where she sat for Tony’s. “It’s the only thing I can give to them… I’ll be okay. I have something written.”
