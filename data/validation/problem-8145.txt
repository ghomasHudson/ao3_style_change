Steve watched Tony glance over at him quickly before looking back at the road. “I’m sorry…I’m rambling…”
Tony was lying on top a table, sprawled out, bouncing a rubber ball off a nearby wall. Steve was on the other side of the lab, leaning up against a console with his arms crossed. He couldn’t stop laughing from Tony persistently quizzing him about his likes and dislikes.
“Hey, kid…” Tony started, feeling an emotional rush “…yeah, I’m okay now that I’m talking to you…”
“I don’t know what to tell you...while I’m inclined to believe the opposite, Anthony and his team said the device’s core was obliterated in the explosion…”
Tony smiled as he glanced at Steve who was blushing from the attention, waving his hand around awkwardly.
Steve had to prevent himself from backing away; he wanted to stay, but he couldn’t face Tony. He felt too embarrassed by his dream and waking up in Tony’s bed, so there was no way he would feel comfortable staying. He needed to go home and regroup.
Steve stopped short from entering to watch Tony work. He looked down at his wristwatch. It was 7:30am. He wondered how long Tony had been working in the lab.
Tony came up from behind, wrapping his hands around Steve’s waist, pulling him in close to his body. They stayed liked this for some time before Steve turned around to face Tony, placing his hands on his face, leaning downward slightly to kiss him. Tony closed his eyes as he kissed Steve back.
“All you did was fall asleep in his bed, Cap.”
“Hey!” Clint acted like the nudge nearly set him off balance.
“Can I speak with you for a quick second, please?” Steve coolly demanded.
Tony leered at Bruce, chuckling to himself before changing the topic of conversation much to Bruce’s relief.
“I know this situation is
Natasha continued to smile as she watched Clint try to reach for some medicine on a table near his bed. She chuckled as she grabbed the bottle for him.
“So, I did get you something else.”
Steve stayed on the edge, twirling his phone around. He reminded himself to be patient with Tony when it came to their relationship and that he needed to give him some more time.
Bruce shook his head with another sigh. “I’m not entirely sure what else we can do at the moment…” he turned to face the console that displayed the list of sequences related to Thanos’s weapon, “…Tony and I already discussed this, but if we push the device past its current limits, it may end up being more destructive than Thanos’s weapon. We can’t afford any mistakes since the stakes are so high…”
He inhaled deeply. He tried to look as calm as possible, but he needed to get out of there. His face had become flush with embarrassment and he dreaded having to carry on at the party as if someone who was integral to his current employment hadn’t just accused him of sleeping with his team leader.
“Okay, this is too cool.” Rhodey cooed. Everyone around him, except for Obadiah, nodded and murmured in agreement.
“Let me go!” Loki shrieked as Thor threw him into the back of the car. Loki grabbed Thor and the two of them wrestled with each other in the back seat as Steve tried to help Thor hold Loki still.
Tony let go off Steve before turning around to lead them into the main area. They found a spot near the bar counter to settle, patiently waiting for the buyers to summon Tony. After a half an hour, Tony could feel himself becoming fidgety and impatient while Steve seemed relatively calm.
“You know…,” Tony gently took Steve’s hand, “this looks really good on you, especially when we’re fucking.” He smirked, turning Steve’s hand on his chest to show that he was talking about the ring.
Tony leaned backward as he crossed his arms. Maybe it wouldn’t be so terrible having such a distractedly good-looking person working closely with him every day. Steve might even turn out to be a horrible person and Tony would only have to work with him on a professional basis. He nodded to himself that that would probably be the case. Well that and Steve could probably have anyone. Why in the world would he be interested in Tony?
Steve laughed before turning away from Tony again. They were so close on the sofa that he was embarrassed that he was blushing.
Everyone responded quickly as they followed Tony’s orders, filing out of the command center to head in opposite directions.
Steve nodded, looking away before looking back at Tony. “…sometimes I think about you calling me Captain…”
“…Tony…you didn’t have to…you know…” Steve tried, attempting to refer to Tony swallowing.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., please itemize that list for me…” Tony called quietly.
The Synergy team crowded into one of the smaller rooms reserved for private meetings shortly after Fury called the team to discuss the next phase in their project timeline. This tiny room, whose occupancy limit was five at the very most, was the only one available because Obadiah had reserved all the available conference rooms to accommodate a visit by the Stark Industries board for a press event not related to Synergy.
Steve shook his head as best as he could, kissing the back of Tony’s neck. “It’s okay, Tony. Let’s get some sleep, okay?”
Tony continued to smile at Steve as Steve continued to rub his arm. They looked at each in silence for a moment before another word was spoken.
"Tony, what's going on?" She asked, stopping Tony with a hand on his shoulder.
"We want to help," he told her. "Not because we have to, but because we want to. Please let us."
He talked about the ringleader, Steve Rogers, and his right-hand man, Bucky Barnes. Well,
"Yeah. They just got in."
Sooner than Tony realized it, it was lunchtime. Tony didn't really eat all that much, and he definitely never really ate at school, but before he could get out of it, Rhodey had grabbed Tony's arm and said, "C'mon, man, come sit with me and my friends."
That got Steve's attention.
new kid. This was Tony fucking Stark.
"He's got a son. His name is Peter. He looks about ten, if I'd have to guess."
He kept telling himself he was being stupid -- he'd known Tony for a while now. Tony had been going to Brooklyn High for about three months, and they'd become really close since then. They even had plans for their first date, although, since it'd been so close to Christmas when they declared their attraction to one another, they had decided to wait until afterwards.
Even though George Barnes wasn't the greatest guy when he'd been drinking, Winifred stayed with him. He wasn't abusive to anyone but his son, and he was only like that when he was drunk, so Winifred justified that as an okay thing. Sometimes it really pissed Steve off, but then again, Winifred had often gone out of her way to make sure Bucky was protected. She watched out for him, in her own little way, so Steve couldn't hate her
And Tony was dumbstruck. Nobody's parents had ever
"That really is, Antonio," his mother smiled. She had always known that Tony wasn't straight -- she wasn't sure what label to put on it, because Tony never really said anything to his parents about it -- and she knew that Howard would have a hard time accepting their son if he ever found out.
With that, Peter was gone.
It was because of this that Bucky and Steve were pretty much brothers. If you saw Bucky, then Steve was either right next to him or a couple of steps behind. They were a team.
"Hey, Tony, you okay?" James -- no,
"They?"
Steve nodded. "Yeah. Used his manners and everything. I'm gonna show him the playroom after he and his dad get settled."
Deciding on a t-shirt and jeans --
Tony was so thankful that the teacher didn't do that thing a lot of other teachers did, the whole
Steve cocked a brow at his friend, but finally said, "Dad's preaching tomorrow. I'll be home after twelve-thirty."
"Christmas is next week," Joe mentioned, taking a drink of his iced tea. "Do you and your parents have plans?"
-- but nobody had ever told Steve how beautiful he really was. Maybe because it was because nobody really noticed it.
Tony nodded, "Yeah, Pete, it's okay with me."
So, to make his mom happy, he willingly moved to Brooklyn and didn't say
Tony's black eye was fading a little; it was still dark around the edges, so there wasn't a way anybody could look at it and
When he walked into his class that morning, aided by the guy the school had set him up with -- a nice kid named James Rhodes --
He followed Steve to the table, where Sarah, Joe, and Bucky were already sitting. Silently, Tony took a seat beside Bucky.
Leather Jacket kid, the kid who Tony had been watching before class started, he seemed to be pretty damn smart. While Tony hadn't been very happy about being put in a class where he could do the homework with his eyes closed, he decided that he'd go through with the class, because, not only was it a good review for him -- not that he
Steve left the room and went into the kitchen, where Bucky was sitting at the kitchen table, reading the newspaper. He sighed when he heard Steve come into the room.
"You guys like each other," Bucky said, stating it as fact. He'd known Steve long enough to know that Steve was going to deny it. He watched Steve's blue eyes carefully before plucking the cigarette from between his lips and said, "Deny it all you want, Stevie, but you two watch each other like hawks, but only when the other's not looking."
And even though Steve had the reassurance of everyone, he was still super-nervous.
pastor's wife. "Everybody gets gifts on Christmas."
"I know it's too early to say it," Tony added quickly. "We haven't even been on our first date yet, but you have treated me so well and unlike anybody ever has. I've had feelings for you for a long time, but when I saw this, I realized it was love."
tell that Tony was wishing he was anywhere but here. Tony was doing everything he could to make himself smaller, to make it so people wouldn't notice he was here.
. Howard Stark's son. Nobody gave a damn about my personality or what I liked." He sighed and then added, "And they most definitely would've never given me a painting of the two of us cuddling."
"James Rhodes. Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes."
After slamming his locker shut and going off to geometry, which was their first period of the day, that's when their friends Natasha and Clint sidled up next to them.
They had sat down to lunch and Tony had been suspiciously absent. Tony didn't eat all that often, not at school, but he usually sat with the rest of the group and talked to them, but Wednesday afternoon, he was gone from the table. Bucky had mentioned that maybe Tony just wanted some time to himself, so Steve let it go.
Steve was nervous.
Peter nodded.
"Mornings are a great thing, Buck," Steve answered him. After debating it in his head for a few seconds, he decided to grab his sketchbook as well.
"I love this time of year," Sam stated, smiling. "Besides, you won't do it."
"Tell me, Tony, who's the guy you're crushing on?" Steve's voice was soft and tentative, but he needed to know what was going through Tony's head. Even if it wasn't Steve, he needed to know what was going through his friend's head.
"C'mon, Tony, come and sit down next to me," Bucky said, moving over so there was a space between himself and Steve. After shooting him a look, Steve understood why Bucky did that -- he could see the vulnerability in Tony as well as Steve could.
Tony did not have many regrets in life, but the most critical thing he ever regretted was staying with that bastard for as long as he did. The moment he started to see his younger self in Peter, he knew it had all gone bad and he had to do what his mother never could; take his child and go. He regretted deeply he let it go on that long, that he'd ever put Peter in that situation.
how much he affected Tony -- they hadn't gone all the way, and it'd only been a week since that afternoon where Steve had invited Tony and his family to Christmas dinner, but they'd had a few heavy make-out sessions since then that had left them both hard and aching.
The painting was a picture of himself and Tony. His sketchbook was full of drawings of Tony -- even though he didn't really want Tony to know about it -- and, when he'd been bored in geometry one afternoon, he'd drawn a picture of himself and Tony cuddled on the couch.
creating something. Tony's mind worked so fast that not a lot of people could keep up with him.
"Dad, are we safe here?" he asked.
thing, and Tony could've kissed her for it. He knew who he was, he knew that he was smarter than a good portion of the population, but he didn't want to bring anybody's attention to it.
Tony nodded, "Yeah, we grew up together."
"Besides," Bucky added a brief moment later, "Tony loves you in those things."
about it. Maria had asked for no arguments, and Tony had been trying really hard, but he couldn't just let
Tony shook his head. Quietly, he said, "No."
On the first Saturday of December, Steve and Bucky had decided to do some Christmas shopping. It'd been a while since he'd spent time with Bucky, just the two of them, so it was a nice trip for them.
Honestly, Steve hadn't realized his gift would make Tony so emotional.
Steve let Bucky's words sink in for the next couple of days. On Wednesday, Tony arrived at school with a black eye, and he seemed like he kind of withdrew into himself. The Tony they'd come to know, he wasn't afraid to say what was on his mind, he wasn't afraid for people to know what he was thinking. But this Tony -- he was completely different.
. There was a kid standing in the back of the room, about three people around him, and they seemed to be animatedly chatting. He was tall, had a lot of bulk on him, with short blond hair and crystal blue eyes. He had kind of an All-American kind of charm to him, and it made Tony automatically think of fireworks and apple pie.
But then Thursday passed, and Friday passed, and Tony wasn't there for those days either. Steve knew that Tony had come to school, but for Tony to avoid Steve like he did, something was wrong.
to comment on it, even though Steve knew it was going to be incredibly hard for Joe to hold his tongue.
When Tony nodded, Steve shrugged. "I know Rhodey. He was in the Air Force with Sam. Sam retired a couple of years ago, but he and Rhodey stayed in touch. You're a friend of his?"
Tony could tell that he wasn't sure how to ask the question without his father feeling guilty.
"I don't want to talk about it," Tony mumbled, and Steve decided to drop it.
"Hey, Steve-o," Tony said softly when he saw him. Looking back, he saw that his parents were busy introducing themselves to the others, so Steve leaned in and gave Tony a kiss.
It was the same thing Bucky did whenever his dad had been drinking.
And, honestly, Howard often threw money at Tony so he would just leave him the hell alone.
Oh, who was he kidding; knowing the Stark family, it
And Steve just watched him, dumbstruck.
Tony nodded.
"By the way, thanks for raking," Steve said with a smile.
"It's gonna be fine, love," Sarah had told him soothingly on Christmas morning. "I promise."
Bucky came from a huge family, and every year, he challenged himself to get the gifts for his sisters that they'd love the best. Four years running, Bucky had gotten Becca, Lottie, and Nellie the gifts they loved the most, and so now, it was a personal goal for him.
"Are you upset?" Steve asked. When Clint and Rhodey had assured Steve that Tony would love the painting, nobody mentioned that he'd get so emotional when seeing it.
him before.
Steve shot a quizzical look at his friend.
He led him to a table, and Tony stopped in his tracks when he saw that Rhodey was leading him over to where the beautiful boy, Leather Jacket kid from geometry class, was sitting, surrounded by a few kids. Two other boys and a girl.
Maria smiled softly and then looked at Steve, "You're very talented."
new kid, Tasha," Bucky said from Steve's left. "It's Tony fucking Stark."
Being the son of Howard Stark, Tony was used to his father's celebrity. He was used to the way people acted around not only Howard, but his family. If you had Stark in your name, people bent over backwards to make you happy.
"Really?" Sam perked up. He and Rhodey had taken different paths in the Air Force, but after serving together aboard an aircraft carrier for several months, the two became good friends. They still kept in touch every now and again now that Sam had taken his discharge and returned to civilian life. It turned out he didn't want to be a lifer, unlike Rhodey.
"We're okay, buddy," Tony tried to soothe him. He wrapped an arm around his son's shoulders. "Ty doesn't know where we are. There's no way for him to find us as long as I use cash and we keep a low profile."
"What's the deal with you and Nat?" was what Steve decided to answer with, even though that was technically another question.
Steve smiled softly, "You know what, Tony? I'd fucking love it."
There might be a delay in posting the next chapter. Tuesday is chemo day and it takes my mom about four days to recover, and she needs my help. She wasn't responding to the first chemo, so the newer one she's on is rather aggressive.
Steve was -- how he was kind but kind of rough on the exterior, but one of the best guys Tony had ever known. He stood up for people who couldn't stand up for themselves, and he was just one of the best guys that Tony ever met.
"Steve, I..." Tony's voice trailed off, but then he shook his head. "Steve, you should just get outta here. I'll come by your place tomorrow."
and treated like he'd treat anyone else.
This could easily top that list.
"You definitely will be, Tony," Steve smiled. "I can promise you that."
"Tell me about them," Maria suggested, and Tony started to do just that.
"What happened to not asking the guy out?" Steve asked, feeling a little kiss drunk, but managed to string a sentence together.
Tony shook his head, "Sweetheart, I don't
Tony and Steve were still at the table when Steve said, "You wanna go watch the game with Dad and Bucky?"
They decided to do gifts before dinner, and he could see the shock on Tony's face when Steve mentioned, "We got you guys some stuff."
"You okay, Peter?" he asked him quietly.
invited them, after all -- but something about a big holiday with Tony was making him really anxious.
But Tony, Maria, Jarvis, and Ana were coming over for Christmas dinner.
Tony was wearing his jeans and favorite band t-shirt, and Steve was also painted in jeans and a t-shirt, and Tony was sitting in Steve's arms, his head back and resting on Steve's chest. Their hands were clasped together and their fingers intertwined, while it looked like Steve was whispering sweet nothings in Tony's ear. Anybody who saw the picture could tell that it was supposed to have just a sweet, cuddly vibe. The scene was
There is mentions of child abuse, domestic violence, and of course Howard being a shitty parent. But nothing too graphic; most of it is just mentioned in passing.
"Rhodey?" Steve asked, his face lighting up. Tony wasn't sure if his surprise showed on his face, but if Steve knew Rhodes went by Rhodey to his friends, he couldn't be that bad, right?
"You know how much I hate being watched," Sam stated without even looking up. Being in the Air Force had given him a sixth sense bordering on paranoia about people's focus on him. "What do you want?"
Tony looked a little apprehensive at first, but then nodded. The way that Steve knew Tony, he knew that Tony probably hadn't eaten yet today.
Well, Howard would've, if he ever gave Tony the time of day. Maria found herself often wishing that she could do something to make her son and husband get along better than they did.
Steve knew
But Maria had begged her son to just go along with what Howard had wanted. To just do what his dad asked, this once, and skip the arguing.
When Steve looked up from his lunch, he noticed Rhodey was standing there with the same kid from geometry class -- that
Tony sat down where Bucky had made the space, and then Tony looked around the table nervously.
Steve was trying really hard not to think about Tony.
Tony breached the distance between them and gave Steve a kiss, attacking his lips hungrily. They kissed for a few minutes, Steve's hands going to Tony's dark hair, and tangling his fingers in it.
"Thank you," he said softly. He wasn't sure if he could admit how much he'd appreciated that.
Tony was so used to being shunned, especially at the old high school he used to go to. He was the smart kid, the kid who had a father who was not only a celebrity, but an asshole and a well-known womanizer. Howard had stepped out on his wife for
Dinner went nicely, with great food and conversation. As usual, Sarah had made too much, and told Maria that she was welcome to take some home.
"Actually, Antonio, I've known for a while. I know you're not ready to tell me, and that's fine, but I wanted you to know that anytime you're ready to tell me
"We've gotta go out there, Tones," Steve murmured against his lips. "We don't have time for a make-out session right now."
And Sarah nodded.
Steve's gift to Tony was easily the largest package. But Steve was incredibly nervous.
He turned it around and showed it to his mom -- which, Steve knew that Maria and Tony were close -- and said, "Look, Mom! Steve painted me a picture of us!"
They kissed for a while, attacking each other's mouth hungrily until Sarah called them for dinner. Steve broke the kiss.
years -- and almost everybody knew about it.
"Don't be dumb, Stevie," Bucky was saying to him that morning, when Steve was in his closet, trying to figure out what to wear. "Why not just your jeans and one of those ridiculously tight shirts?"
"Hi, Peter," Steve said softly, crouching down to talk to the boy as Tony finished up with the payment. "We get lots of kids around here. And there's a kid's playroom upstairs, about three doors down from you and your dad's room. We put it in just for kids to hang out in."
Natasha was standing in the entrance to Dr. Selvig’s lab. The scientist was working at a console with his back turned toward her, but he didn’t budge.
“Oh yeah, that’s the best part, Steve.” Bruce dipped his eyeglasses downward to look at Steve. He noticed that the older man appeared to be studying him.
Agent Hill turned to address Natasha. “Did you find anything else?”
“I need to get the
“Hey, Rhodey. It’s Tony.”
“Nice work!” Rhodey had appeared behind some of the backstage employees. He walked up to Tony first to pat him on the shoulder before shaking Steve’s hand.
“Hey, safety manager,” Tony called over to Steve, “are we allowed to grab things with the robot?”
“J.A.R.V.I.S., run the test again.” Tony proceeded to sway with the music as he watched the numbers race up the screen.
“Yes. It’s very exciting. I’m interested in seeing what it can actually do.” Steve moved out of the way as Bruce ducked in front of him. Bruce nodded vigorously with a huge grin as soon as he finally stood still.
Sometime later, Steve and Tony quietly rode the elevator down to the lobby. As soon as the elevator doors opened, Tony stepped to the side with his arm stretched out to let Steve out first. Tony followed him closely from behind before Steve turned around to face him.
The bartender kept grinning as he put his hands up in retreat. Tony turned around and smiled.
Tony tapped on his earpiece. “It looks like the situation is more serious than expected. I think it’s probably best to have the three of you wait outside the park when you arrive then we can switch places after the specs are generated.”
“Nice to meet you, Bucky.” Tony offered coolly.
“Nice to finally meet you too, Mr. Stark.” Bucky greeted with a slight edge in his voice that was not lost on Tony.
“Any interests in a super-secret Tony Stark tour?”
Steve’s eyes darted around the room as he tried to sit up in the bed. “I just remember walking into the lab—oh my god, Tony!”
Tony wagged a finger at Loki before exiting the room. “I’ve seen him angry and it’s not pretty.” He then opened to the door out into the hallway to find Steve calmly talking to Thor. Natasha was still on the phone, but then she hung up as soon as Tony appeared.
Tony shook his head with a grin. “No, but I thought we weren’t keeping secrets from each other, Rogers.” He teased back.
Tony couldn’t help his face from expressing how astounded he was with such a simple statement. He could feel Steve's sincerity which strangely felt reassuring. He continued to feel behind Steve’s ear, but then the dull pain in the middle of his chest reappeared.
The object flickered, causing the people standing near him to back away, terrified, while Thanos stood in place.
Steve laughed as he followed Tony out of the kitchen and into the foyer. He found Tony standing near the elevator, studying his watch. Tony grinned at him before he walked over to give Steve another kiss as the elevator chimed with an arrival.
Tony scrolled through some data on the tablet, seemingly unaware that he had grazed Steve’s hand. Steve waited patiently for him to speak.
Steve straightened up to yank off his shirt before he went back to rubbing Tony’s crotch with one hand as the other kept feeling Tony’s chest. Steve moaned quietly as he slid a hand into Tony’s briefs, feeling around before tilting his chin up to kiss Tony.
Steve patted Thor on the back, wincing somewhat from the force of the hug. “Hey, Thor.” He peeped through the hug.
. Coming this December 2021. Here’s a preview:
The minister then asked for Sam and Shuri to share their wedding vows. Sam cleared his throat before laughing to himself.
“Rogers, why are you moving like that?” Tony had walked up to the bed with the kit.
Tony waved the employee off before rapidly pressing the “close door” button through a surge of desperation.
Steve smiled as he reached out hand. “Nice to meet you, Mr. Beck. Peter talks about you all the time.”
… Tony hoped. Steve blowing up on him earlier in the week was still weighing heavily on his mind and he couldn’t focus.
Steve groaned to himself; there was no way he could go on keeping this away from Tony. They had promised that they would be open with each other and Steve was going back on his word. So, he then decided that he would just tell Tony the next day what he found and hoped Tony would understand why he held onto the diary.
Tony motioned for Peter to follow him into the kitchen. The nine-year old ran after him as Tony walked briskly toward the island. Steve followed them, curious to know what this ‘quota’ was about.
Steve groaned as he pumped himself in and out of Tony before finally settling on top. Tony gasped out loud as he let go of his cock. He stretched out his arms on either side as Steve laid on top of him panting.
Tony humped Steve’s body slowly, inhaling deeply before leaning forward to kiss Steve. Steve let go of himself to hold Tony against his body, turning his head to kiss him. They kissed each other for a second before Tony flipped over onto his back, panting heavily.
Pepper and Tony were standing near the entrance to the private express elevator in Tony’s penthouse. Peter had long disappeared into his room to tinker with some scraps Tony had salvaged from a failed experiment earlier that week.
Peter giggled as Tony continued.
“Damn,” Bucky was standing next to Steve at the entrance to the plane’s cabin, “T’Challa’s one good looking dude.” Prompting Steve to laugh and nod back in agreement.
Without responding verbally, as he was unsure what to say without spoiling the mood, Steve squeezed Tony through the hug. He felt a hand slide across his thigh, heightening his heart’s fluttering.
“I mean,” Tony had turned again to face Steve, “it’s okay with me if it’s all right with you…”
Steve turned his head to see that Tony was trying to keep a straight face but ultimately broke it with another fit of laughter, making Steve groan. Tony was laughing so much as this point that the bed shook from how outrageously loud his laugh was.
The elevator doors opened to reveal Tony. “Hey, Rogers.” He reached out to give Steve a hug who meekly accepted it.
Natasha nodded as she looked over at Bruce who smiled back shyly before desperately looking elsewhere. The team continued to congratulate each other, except for Tony who was in the process of leaving the arena. Steve watched Tony exit, waiting a minute or two before following him.
Steve stopped short before addressing Tony. He thought back to the framed photograph of his teammate in Obadiah’s office.
“You know I’m going to need to see the full specs for the Synergy device. Sooner rather than later.” Tony watched Obadiah drum his fingers on the arm of his chair, waiting patiently for Tony to respond.
“Feel me, baby.” Tony whispered as he kept rubbing Steve.
blowing up labs. Someone else sent me these numbers in an encrypted email.”
“Tony, you don’t even know what we’re making.”
“Let’s get you all settled. I have keys set out for everyone to your suites. Just retrieve them at the main desk once you’re ready.”
“Would you like to dance, Tony?” He asked quietly.
Steve nodded as he scooted even closer toward Tony. Tony turned his body some more as he swallowed a lump in his throat, anticipating the worst, but not entirely sure why.
Tony nodded as it became clear that Steve was finished. He inhaled painfully before letting out a ragged exhale. Of course, Steve and Bucky were close; they grew up together, went to college together, served in the army.
“Poor Peter. He begged me to come along. I ended up promising him that we could spend an extra month or so out at the house in Malibu for the summer…well hopefully anyway…who knows with the end of the world looming over our heads.”
Mr. Beck smiled and waved. “Your robot looks great, Peter and Ned! I’m excited to see what it does.”
"It's different," Tony said, finding his voice, even though it was soft, hesitant. "Malibu is always sunny and warm. It's fucking
"What's that for?" Tony asked when they broke apart.
Steve nodded, even though he knew Tony couldn't see him through the oak door, "Yeah, absolutely."
"Jarvis, I'm glad that Tony's got you and your wife and his mom," Steve said. "He deserves all the good things."
Joe was not the regular preacher. He really wanted to make a difference, and he often said that it wasn't his job to judge people. In fact, a lot of Christians hated his point of view -- Joe often said that God created people of all sizes and personalities. LGBT folk should be accepted along with everybody else. He figured that

Peter was silent.
"That's Natasha, behind the counter," Steve introduced Tony and Peter. "There are a few other staff members. Sam lives here with me, and Tasha and Bucky live just down the block. We are a tight-knit group."
had a place in the world -- even people that most others said didn't.
"You don't have to say it back, Steve. In fact, I don't want you to, unless you feel it."
About half an hour later, Bucky sat down to watch TV with Sarah -- which, it had been strange the first time he did it, but Bucky felt like Joe and Sarah were second parents to him, and he spent a lot of time doing things with the two of them, so it didn't really seem as weird anymore -- and Steve and Tony went into his bedroom.
tell what it was, but it wasn't exactly prominent anymore. Steve knew that his parents could see the bruise and were trying really hard
"So what's the deal with you and Tony?" Bucky asked, removing the unlit cigarette from behind his ear and lighting it. He took a drag of the cigarette and then looked at his friend, noting the surprised look on Steve's face, like that was the last thing he'd ask him.
"We're cozier than most," came a masculine voice from behind them. Tony turned and froze; the man standing there was tall, with more muscles and sleekest hip-to-shoulder ratio Tony had ever seen. He breathed in deep as he took in the man's blond hair and blue eyes. He momentarily saw someone else standing there. Tony took a few minutes to remind himself he was safe.
"Ana?" Steve questioned.
The man held out his hand, seeming oblivious to Tony's internal panic. "I'm Steve Rogers. I own this bed and breakfast."
This chapter was once again beta'd by the amazing Bucky_Bear.

surprised when she found out that Steve was the son of a preacher.
"Master Tony talks about you all the time," he'd said, walking Steve through the mansion. "He regales Ana and myself with stories about your school life constantly."
Peter shifted away from Tony and avoided eye contact. This told Tony that Peter wanted to drop the subject for now.
"What's the matter, Tones?" Steve asked softly. He patted the bed beside him, and Tony took the hint, sitting down. "Did I do something wrong?"
, unlike a lot of those so-called 'Christian' folks that are around now. So what makes you think Tony's gonna judge you on that?"
Once again, many thanks to the amazing Bucky_Bear for the beta! You totally rock!
Steve never wanted to leave him. Steve wanted to be with Tony forever.
Even though, technically, he wasn't.
look, along with the scruff that lined his cheeks and chin.
"Tony Stark, right?" Clint piped up. Tony watched him closely, and Steve couldn't pinpoint the look on Tony's face, but he
"The two of you are going to straighten out whatever's going on," Sarah soothed. "It's going to be okay, son. I promise."
"Welcome to the Rogers Bed and Breakfast," the woman behind the counter said with a smile. She actually reminded Tony of Peter's mom. Pepper's hair hadn't been as dark as this woman's, but she was small, petite, and incredibly well put together. He noticed her hair was tied back but still looked like it'd taken a long time to style, and her nails had an immaculate manicure. Her green eyes studied him as she spoke, "Do you have a reservation?"
"My dad found out," Tony mumbled, and Steve watched him closely. He knew that he had to treat this very carefully, or else it could startle Tony and he could run away altogether. When Steve was quiet, Tony continued, "He found out that I'm not straight. He doesn't know that I'm pan, but he knows that I'm most definitely not straight. He also knows that I'm crushing on a guy."
Sam nodded before picking up his rake again.
Everybody in school knew how he was, but nobody wanted to tell his parents. Joe and Sarah Rogers were devout in their religion, but nobody wanted to break it to them that their son was a regular juvenile delinquent.
He wasn't sure how much time passed; it felt like fifteen minutes, it felt like an hour. All Steve was aware of was that he'd spent the last two months wondering what it'd be like to kiss Tony, to know what he tasted like and what his hands felt like while they were caressing his skin, but he finally had his answer. And he was loving every single second of it.
Steve shrugged, "If it's okay with your dad, I'll show you later. After the two of you have settled."
As Steve reached into his locker to pull out his geometry textbook, he gave his best friend a tired glance.
Tony nodded, and with that, Steve turned around and left the mansion.
; Natasha had to go
"Stevie told me what you liked," Sarah explained, "and I wanted to make them for you. We like you, Tony."
"He's too good for me," Steve answered, his face flushing beet red. "Besides that, he's not gonna be interested in a
"He's not just
Tony thought to himself.
Even though Tony didn't really care for sports, and he didn't pay attention to them, there was honestly nowhere else he'd rather be.
"We can trust him," Tony started, but then stopped when he saw the look on Peter's face.
"I mean just what I said. If you ever need to talk, to get something off your chest, just come to me, okay? I promise I won't judge you."
Bucky could easily sleep until one or two in the afternoon if he didn't have to get up. Steve was an early riser -- he always had been, he was up and on his morning jog by
"I'm sure everyone will make them feel welcome. We should just give them time to settle in."
Joe Rogers was a very popular Methodist minister. Everybody knew who he was. Not only was he a minister that everybody had heard of, he was an all-around
"It's okay, doll," Steve said soothingly. "We're all friends here."
"Hey there, Tony," Sarah smiled at her son's friend. "How are you doing?"
So even though Steve was a bad boy and people knew not to mess with him, they also knew that he would stand up for people who needed it. For people who couldn't handle things themselves.
He shouldn't have been, though, because when Tony ripped the wrapping paper off the package, his eyes widened. Even though Steve wasn't sure if he should point it out but were those tears in Tony's eyes?
“And this is Clint Barton.” Fury pointed toward the man still lounging in his chair. Clint only waved at Steve before crossing his arms behind his head.
Steve moved away from Tony’s arm as he glared at him. “Really, you’re not even going to stop me to talk?”
“Steve, I’m sorry…I’m not really in the mood tonight…”
Steve squeaked a small noise as Tony felt around through the fabric of his briefs before taking his time pushing the fabric down. Steve made another noise as his hardening cock sprung out, almost smacking Tony in the face.
Steve returned his glare at Tony. “I just wanted to try something different.”
Everybody expected a preacher's kid to be more reserved, but when it came to Steve, a lot of people were just blown away.
"I make way too much every holiday," Sarah explained. "I always give Bucky some to take home, but I want you to take some." She watched Maria and then added, "I also made a cherry pie. I was told it was Tony's favorite."
"Mr. Jarvis --" Steve started, but Jarvis shook his head.
Not that Steve ever drew attention to it.
After a few conversations with everybody, even Clint -- because, even though nobody would believe it, Clint knew Tony the best, considering Tony was tutoring him in geometry -- he had decided to do something simple, but he knew that Tony would appreciate.
And maybe this school would be different than the one he'd gone to in Malibu. Maybe he could actually finally fit in, and even have friends.
They sat down on the couch together, next to one another, and Steve opened his arms to Tony so he could slide into them. Whenever they cuddled, Steve had quickly learned that Tony liked being the little spoon.
But then everything started to change.
, as Natasha'd put it when she first saw it, but it was Steve's favorite drawing that he'd ever done.
seen Tony eat that much, not in the two months they'd known each other.
five-thirty. However, if Bucky was given the option, he'd sleep all day.
The thought always made Steve laugh.
"Uncle Rhodey told me so," Tony said, which was closes to the truth. "One of them was in the Air Force with him. And you know he would never have told me to come here if we couldn't trust them."
"Look, Stevie," Bucky sighed. "Tasha and I have a thing going on, but you're not gonna deflect. What's going on with you and Tony?"
, he'd said when Tony asked for his name -- who everybody seemed to like -- he sat down and just wanted to be ignored. He didn't want anybody to bring attention to him.
People were always shocked when they found out that Pastor Joe Rogers had an open and out bisexual son; one that he actually loved and protected and
However, Tony didn't have time to dwell on the past or regret his life choices. He had a job to find.
Tony begged to drive himself. The last thing he wanted was to be accompanied to school, to look like the spoiled rich boy that everybody thought he was anyway. He was really happy when his parents conceded.
"Hey, Stevie, this is Tony. Tony, meet Steve. Then there's Bucky, Natasha, and Clint next to him."
here."
"I want them to feel welcomed..." Steve trailed off, thinking back to the hesitation. Tony had shown when taking his hand.
"Who's your friend, Rhodey?" Steve called out, and that's when the boy looked up at him.
"You're different, Stevie. So's your dad. Actually, your entire family. Not many pastors are like your dad, Steve. Your dad is an amazing man, and he doesn't judge LGBT people, and he most definitely doesn't try to tell us what we're doing wrong. He loves
Those were things his parents didn't know about.
"And?" she asked. Natasha was from Russia, her real name being
Again, silently, Tony nodded.
Steve had been pissed that Bucky had stopped him, but, as Bucky said, someone needed to check on the girl and make sure she was okay. She was violently shaking, skin pale and cheeks flushed; she looked barely two minutes from passing out.
That comment just made Steve laugh, because it was true.
. He treated his wife and son like the treasures they were. He never raised his voice to either of them, he never spoke harshly to them, and, most importantly, he never raised a hand to them.
Tony Stark was the son of the technical genius, the founder and CEO of Stark Industries, Howard Stark. Even though Tony was only eighteen years old, some people said he was smarter than his father, but they also said that he didn't want anything to do with weapons manufacturing. Stark Industries was famous because of the fact that they had weapons contracts, but Tony wanted no part of that.
Probably.
"You're welcome to join us," he continued. "Mom and Dad would really like to talk to you."
A few silent moments passed, and then, taking a deep breath, he asked softly, "How'd you know?"
was the word Tony had used, but he'd also used it as a more friendly term than anything. He talked about how
He wasn't sure what Tony was going to say when he showed up at the Rogers' house that afternoon, but at one o'clock on the dot every Sunday afternoon, they had Sunday dinner. It was a tradition and, more often than not, Bucky joined them.
"I'll talk to Mom about it," Tony said, watching her closely. "See what she thinks about it."
"This is my son, Peter," he said to her. "This place is quite charming."
"You wanna talk to me about what's going on, Tony?" Steve asked him, watching his friend carefully. Steve plopped down onto his bed, and Tony took a seat next to him.
Before they escaped the abuse, the physical and emotional pain Tiberius put them through had taken hold. Tiberius had done everything to make sure Tony was emotionally codependent on him. He gaslit and beat down Tony's self-esteem until Tony was only a shadow of his formal confident self.
, but then again, Tony was
Even though Howard, Maria, Tony,
"That month guy come in yet, Stevie?" He asked, not even looking away from his newspaper. Steve looked up when Bucky spoke. He forgot about Bucky's Vulcan-like hearing; nothing got past his friend. Steve just nodded.
The thought hit Steve like a brick wall. Was Tony abused? Did his dad hit him? Did he do worse than that?
"How're you liking Brooklyn?" Natasha asked Tony after a minute had gone by. She opened a container that she brought from home and pulled out a strawberry, biting into it. "It's real different than what you're used to, right?"
"What are you doing, Jarvis?" Tony snapped. Then he looked at Steve, "What the fuck are you doing here?"
Tony couldn't help the puzzled look on his face.
Steve shook his head, "I'm not sure what you're talking about."
Finally, Tony sighed, "We are okay, Pete. For the first time in a long time, we're safe."
Steve was a bad boy. And even though he acted a certain way, he still did the right thing. Stood up to bullies. Punched people who were picking on kids smaller than them, beat up people who wouldn't take no for an answer. One time, his best friend, Bucky, had to practically pull him off a fella who was sexually harassing a young girl and almost attacked her right on the street.
"Yes, Mr. Edwards, I see it here." Tony handed her a few bills and, as she rang him up, he noticed her eyes went towards the boy who was half-hidden behind him.
There weren't a lot of people in Steve's family -- just his parents and himself. His grandparents on either side had already passed, and both Joe and Sarah Rogers were only children. The trip was actually more for Bucky himself.
"What's his name?"
Bucky laughed, and Steve smiled. "It's November, doll," he said. "This kind of weather is to be expected. Just be happy it isn't snowing yet."
They were starting him in geometry; although he was a genius, they wanted to start him in a certain math and then see where he was educationally before moving him to where he needed to go.
There was a new kid coming to town. Now, Steve had been born and raised in Brooklyn, along with practically everyone he knew. Steve and Bucky had known each other since they were three years old, their mothers meeting in the park. Sarah and Winnie became really good friends, which led to Steve and Bucky becoming friends as well.
When asked how Clint could go to school and be deaf at the same time, Tony had explained to his mom that Clint could hear with hearing aids and he also could read lips like a pro.
were safe. Tiberius wasn't going to hurt them. This man, whoever he was, wasn't going to hurt them, either.
to be Tony Stark. Steve himself hadn't ever seen Tony Stark before, but the whole school was aware of Tony's arrival and he was the only new kid that was coming this week, so it had to be him. But what surprised Steve the most was that Tony Stark was beautiful.
"Bring her over here," Steve offered without even thinking about it. He hadn't needed to ask his parents about it; they'd opened their home to other people for Christmas dinner many times before. "Jarvis and Ana, too, if they want. Mom always makes too much, anyway."
Happy Father’s Day, Steve and Tony!
After a short while, most of the guests had dispersed to watch a firework show on the waterfront, while some other guests stayed in the main area, listening to the live band. At this point, Tony was sitting by himself, drinking a virgin mojito. He needed the space to clear his head before possibly making a decision he might regret.
Tony then groaned as he rested his elbows on top of the table to place his head into his hands. “I have no idea what he wants…” he repeated, “then yesterday he told me he just wanted to be friends and that us sleeping together was a mistake. Like, who does that?”
“Sure. What’s your name kid?” Tony asked, taking the students notebook and pen with a more genuine expression.
Steve inhaled deeply as he looked downward at his desk drawer. He exhaled as he pulled it open, shuffling around some folders and papers until he found the chip embedded with the failsafe codes to the Synergy device Tony had given him a while back. Fury had instructed the team to hand over their lab work and destroy any sensitive material, but Steve couldn’t do it. The chip was the only thing he had kept that reminded him of Tony.
Tony chuckled before walking over to a console in the middle of the lab.
Steve attempted a nod, but his neck wouldn’t respond. He clenched the armrests on his chair; he couldn’t go out to the cubicles, but he also couldn’t hide in his office. He thought maybe he should ask his assistant to tell Tony that he was busy with the deadline, but Steve knew Tony would see right through that.
Access codes still undisclosed. The upgrades to the device appear more robust than the original. However, when the opportunity presents itself, do whatever you need to do to get into that lab. And wipe all email traces.
Tony swallowed a lump in his throat as he tried to process this information. “Yep, uh, can I help?” He asked awkwardly.
Loki shifted in his chair. “…that’s all I know…”
Tony walked over to stand next to Bruce as they let Shuri mentally gather her thoughts. Shuri sighed as she walked with her coffee mug over to the console to show Tony and Bruce an image of Synergy’s core.
Steve turned around to join Tony. He laughed as he ran a hand through his hair before placing his hands on his hips.
“Sir, may I remind you that Mr. Rogers has advised against any possible dangerous work.” J.A.R.V.I.S. responded.
Tony moved a hand to caress Steve’s face again. “Steve, it was fine. Don’t worry, okay?”
Obadiah smiled as he leaned forward. “True, but you have a very magnetic personality, Mr. Rogers. Also, I think Anthony would be too busy
“I-I was planning to take Peter to Central Park this weekend…would you like to join us for a picnic or something like that?” He offered meekly, although he still felt shaken up by their conversation.
Rhodey looked confused. “What happened?”
Tony shrugged with a sigh. “I’m not happy about this, but I guess if the doc says so.”
Suddenly, a deafening bang coupled with shouts and screaming erupted outside the lab. Tony’s ears rang as he immediately rushed to the entrance of the lab to see people running down the hallway, shouting for help. He looked around, confused by the commotion, seeing small pieces of debris flying around.
Before Steve could respond, the stray robot Tony had helped Peter and Ned create for their school’s science fair grabbed the giant fair banner that was hanging over head in the middle of the auditorium in the school’s gymnasium. The robot swung its banner clad arm around as it spewed nonsense, knocking into another stand that held a bubbling fake volcano. Steve reacted instinctively, grabbing Tony to find some cover. The hysterical commotion in the space rose as students, teachers, and parents ran around shouting, trying to avoid the rampant path of the robot.
Not too long after, the entire Synergy team gathered at the round table at the helm of the command center at S.H.I.E.L.D. to meet with Fury before interrogating Thanos.
Tony propped himself up onto his elbows. “You are aware that I’m nowhere
“I don’t know how I’ll be able to sleep while thinking about you…” Tony whispered, trying to retain his normal outside composure.
“Hey, Rogers…” Tony shuffled around, trying to find something to fidget with, but his avant-garde statues were the only objects in reach.
“I’m sorry, Pepper. I had no idea…” He said, his voice lowering with every syllable.
“So, how was
Steve sighed agonizingly to himself as he saw Tony already working in the lab as he approached. He looked downward at his wristwatch, taking note that the time was earlier than usual for Tony. Steve paused for a moment, standing at the entrance of the lab before entering.
“Thank you for telling me,” Sharon started, smiling somewhat, “and I had a really nice time with you, too, but I understand. And I also think we’re probably better as friends.” She patted Steve on the hand before gathering her things.
“Really? That would be awesome.” From the sound of Sam’s voice, Steve could tell that his friend was trying to appear cool as much as possible, but his eagerness was still recognizable.
“Uh…thanks.” Steve clenched the tablet before walking over to his side of the lab.
Tony bit the bottom half of his lip as he thought about tomorrow.
“Night, Tony.” Steve waited before hanging up, grateful that Tony had said yes.
At this juncture, Tony was alone with Bruce on the couch after Steve had gotten up to talk to Rhodey at the built-in bar. Tony scooted closer toward Bruce who looked miserable; it was obvious he was brooding over Natasha. But before beginning any useful conversation, Tony flinched with excitement as soon as Van Morrison’s “Caravan” began playing in the background, but he regained some semblance of seriousness through his drunken state to talk to his friend about his relationship problems.
Peter sighed, but then he laughed. “But then you stopped it, so it evens out some how?” He shrugged with a nervous smile.
What if he messed up this thing with Steve? They weren’t serious, which made it easier for Tony to process somewhat besides having to stave off panic attacks around Steve.
Steve nodded. “Okay what do I do?”
“We talk from time to time. She even called to congratulate me on getting into Synergy…” Steve sighed.
Steve nodded quickly as he kissed Tony back. Tony hummed quietly as he let Steve kiss his neck, pushing more into his body.
Tony smiled to himself as he heard Steve panting heavily, bucking upward into his body, at one point swearing to himself as he held onto Tony even tighter.
“Hm?”
The office rolled her eyes with a huff as she continued. “Well, like I told the Shaft wannabe then, we don’t need the alphabet boys interfering in our jurisdiction.”
Peter clapped his hands together as Steve buckled him into his seat. “Yeah! He’ll like that. He works late sometimes.”
Tony stopped the car as he turned onto the driveway, pulling out his car keys from the ignition, before sitting completely silent.
Tony sat down at the island and watched Steve and Peter finish making dinner. After dinner was plated, the three of them decided to eat at the kitchen island, and Peter told Steve and Tony about his day.
Nebula spun around as she marched down the hallway away from Gamora who was left standing alone, mentally fighting with herself over the current state of their father’s mission to build a super weapon that would destroy and kill millions…
“…fuck, baby…” Tony gasped. His movements sped up as the natural lubrication of the water between them intensified the sensation.
He felt Steve nestle his neck with the tip of his nose. Steve then pushed upward into his body and Tony wanted desperately to push back, feeling himself give in. Would it be so bad if they ended up sleeping together that night? When they had started making out, it seemed like more than a good idea, but then unfortunately, the cons of such a decision began to weigh heavily as Steve’s petting neared the point of no return.
Steve grinned the silliest grin; although it was a straightforward note, something about it felt quite personal and intimate. He slumped downward into the bed still holding the hand-written note. He read it over a few more times before exhaling happy, ready to fully embrace the day.
“Tony, please. You just saved our asses.” Tony gently interrupted.
obvious.”
“Please don’t tell me that the government couldn’t afford our troops their own beds?” Alluding to Steve’s military service; the question didn’t sound stupid or awkward, which Tony was immediately thankful for. He proceeded to slowly undress, first fumbling with his jeans before making a whole show of sliding them off. He heard Steve still giggling from the bed.
Steve lingered in the threshold of the bathroom door as Tony looked up at him with a smile. “You gonna come in, Rogers?”
Shuri shrugged, although it was clear that she had appreciated Tony’s kind statement. “Eh, sometimes it helps having a fresh pair of eyes.”
Hey, I’m grabbing lunch with Sam today. C U after?
Rhodey expressed confusion before settling. “I mean…you do look a little miserable…what’s going on?”
Steve looked around as if he were trying to find the source of the voice. “Uh, nice to you meet, too…J.A.R.V.I.S…”
Tony gasped again as he felt Steve touch him. He wiggled, now trying to remove his pants. Steve stopped touching Tony to pull his pants off. He then unzipped his own pants, trying to remove them with ease as he had seen Tony done before, but he struggled to get out them, almost falling over on the bed.
Tony sighed loudly, hanging his head, taking his time before turning around to acknowledge Steve. Steve was standing at the entrance to the balcony, leaning to the side of the opening with his hands in his front pockets.
“Steve…,” Tony began. The serious tone was evident in Tony’s choice to address Steve by his first name.
sounds like a challenge,” but then he sighed as soon as Strange’s expression grew serious, “…kind of. But I don’t know what that has to do with my panic attacks.”
“…hearing you laugh definitely assures me that I didn’t completely fuck up…” Tony added.
weekend, Tone?” Rhodey was serving Tony the hardest grin as the latter walked into his Stark Industries office. Tony grimaced at Rhodey before sitting down at his desk.
“Yeah, it’s a personal preference of mine.” Steve spun around the image a few times. After a couple swipes and zooms, he felt like he was quickly getting a hang of the controls.
Peter giggled as he sat down next to Tony on the bed.
“Huh, play it. Let’s see what happens.”
Sam and Bucky, like they had when Steve’s relationship with Peggy failed, had been trying to cheer up their heart broken friend with their usual bro-antics, but this time was different. Steve thought constantly about Tony ever since the day the latter came over to his apartment to break up with him. Steve thought there was more to their relationship and that they were beyond some of their issues, but apparently it was all one sided.
Steve could feel Tony letting him take control, but he wasn’t sure how long he should continue. Tony smiled through the kiss before placing a hand on Steve’s chest. He bit the bottom half of his lip as he looked upward at Steve. Steve smiled back, pulling away, inciting a subdued laughing fit between the two.
“Oh, my roommate will be there. Just to let you know.” Steve quickly added, squashing that dream. He wanted to spend more time with Tony, but he also didn’t want it to seem like it was a date, you know, in case Tony wasn’t actually interested in him.
Steve’s cheery disposition changed as he looked away before looking back at Tony. “She’s great…uh…she works in Manhattan at the public defender’s office…that’s how we know each other…uh…that’s really it…”
“Remember that board member guy Tony can’t stand who was at the party last night?” He placed the mug down behind him to brace himself against the counter as he crossed his arms against his chest. Sam looked up from his sandwich and nodded.
“So…” Steve began as he regained control over himself, telling himself to remain as calm as possible, “how can I help you?”
Yet, their seemingly conflicting temperaments still meshed nicely in this environment. Steve’s consistent cool headedness outweighed Tony’s dogged hotheadedness, while Tony’s affinity for thinking outside the box encouraged Steve to open up more and embrace the unknown.
Steve nodded once more. “Would you like for me to stay? I just need to get some case files from the office.”
“Obviously you’re aware that the failsafe you originally constructed was enough to safeguard against most disruption to its main hardware.”
Some of the reporters laughed while some others began shouting over each other, trying to be the first to get a question in.
This time Bruce raised his voice in an annoyingly higher pitch that prompted giggling from Peter.
Steve hummed loud enough for Tony to hear that he was seriously considering this seemingly important question.
“Rogers,” Tony motioned toward Steve with one hand before Fury could respond, “I get why you’re not pleased, but, as you
Steve blushed as he let Tony pull him downward for a kiss. Steve laid down on top of him, rubbing Tony’s cock through the fabric of his briefs. Tony moaned as he felt Steve then push downward into his body, rubbing his hard cock against his.
They all piled into the helicopter before Natasha effortlessly maneuvered them up and away from the island. Tony joined her in the cockpit, pointing out toward the island as they rose into the air.
Peter continued to express how excited he was to see Steve again by rapidly listing all the experiments he planned to show him. Tony continued laughed as Peter followed him into the kitchen. Tony waited a moment as he leaned up against the island, watching Peter bounce around with joy.
“Don’t do that, Tony. Please don’t talk about yourself like that…especially when we’re like this…you told me you wouldn’t…”
“Yeah, I’m beginning to think that’s more likely the case.” Tony joked back, walking over to kiss Steve before repositioning himself underneath the robot with Peter again.
“Tony, nice to see you.” Sam chuckled as he looked over at Steve. Steve was absolutely mortified, but he was trying to hold it together without falling apart in front of Sam and Tony.
“I wasn’t even going for that, but now I
Tony nodded, but his expression had deflated even more.
Steve cradled the glasses in his hands before sighing again. But before he could let Sam offer him some more advice, Steve jumped up off the couch as he headed toward his bedroom.
Tony groaned, slapping a hand to his forehead before attempting to end the call. But before he could, the phone stopped ringing to indicate that Steve had picked up.
Steve closed his eyes, now more enraptured with seeing Tony enjoying himself. He kept moving his hand as he licked up and down Tony. He took his time, taking in more of Tony’s scent and how great he felt, letting out a few gasps and moans himself as he worked.
Agents at S.H.I.E.L.D. questioned Dr. Selvig on any other possible employee conspirators, but besides implicating Loki, the scientist was reluctant to provide any other details, especially whoever was giving them orders to sabotage Synergy.
Tony kept himself from grimacing. “Of course, Rogers. I meant it when I said we couldn’t do this without you…”
Just a heads up about the next chapter: I may be a little late...it’s my birthday next Sunday and I have some other things to work on/things to be at, but I should be able to post on schedule! It just might be later in the day then around the early afternoon. 😅😅😅
Tony waved goodbye to the guard, walking quickly back to the mailbox to avoid any more prolonged conversation. As soon as he reached the box, he hesitated before taking the letter, not entirely sure what he would find inside. He flipped the envelope over as he pulled it out, his eyes widening as he realized that the letter was from Steve.
Steve kissed Tony before tilting his head back a bit. “Tony, is it okay…if we…” He started.
Tony laughed as he kissed Steve back. “To be honest, I’m a little nervous…but I don’t know why…”
“Tony,” Steve took in a deep breath, “please, I need to say this first…” He looked downward at the floor before looking back up at Tony, causing Tony to feel the same way he had the last time they slept together.
Bruce’s face flushed from the attention. “Ah, well, Shuri mostly figured out the mechanics behind it.” He tapped on the tablet again, showing Tony a projection mimicking a scenario for the separate reactor, “it’s scalable, so any situation isn’t too big or small for it.”
“Loki, enough!” Thor shouted as he reached downward to grab his brother.
“Well then. It sounds like everything is running smoothly. Keep me updated.” He jumped out of his chair before briskly walking to exit the office.
Tony pumped his fingers in and out of Steve, scissoring them at one point, making Steve squirm each time with another moan. Tony kissed Steve’s neck, feeling his chest as best as he could with his free hand before slowly pulling out his fingers. Steve had been so caught up in the moment that he whined as soon as Tony pulled out.
Steve groaned again as Tony could feel that he was close too. He rubbed himself as Steve leaned forward with both hands on his body, holding him tightly.
But before Steve could finish, Tony burst out into laughter again. He laughed loudly to himself as he slapped the edge of the bed.
Tony placed his plate down on the table as he shook his head. “I don’t buy it. Something’s off. Obie
you were into anal.” He sneered.
Tony spun around, squinting at Steve before laughing out loud, too loudly for comfort.
Rhodey nodded slowly as his expression change slightly. He then smiled, but only a bit to reassure his friend.
Tony nodded. In the moment it was nice, but this wasn’t what he wanted. He wanted Steve, the way they were before.
Tony smiled back at Steve before leaning forward. He held up the device. “Four hours until we get to the hotel, about two hours to get ready and possibly scout out the place, then that would give us the rest of the evening to gather any information we need on the buyers.”
Pepper clapped her hands together with delight, but then restrained herself as best as she could; Fury only nodded but it was accompanied with a typical-sly-Fury smile; and Obadiah’s expression remained painfully stoic.
“Uh, what’s up, J.A.R.V.I.S?” Sam answered as he finally eased up.
Thanos let out a dramatic sigh as he swiveled in his chair to face his daughters. He delicately folded his hands in his lap without responding.
Steve held his gaze toward Tony before finally letting go. Tony almost let out an audible sigh of relief from being that close to Steve for the first time in such a long time. Steve backed away an inch as Tony coughed before motioning toward the kitchen.
Gamora turned slightly to look down at Obadiah who still looked terrified. “Figure out that notation or you won’t even see us before we kill you. Got it?”
He braced himself with both hands before pushing himself away from the bed. At first, everything appeared fine as he stood up; Steve grinned, fully thinking that his strength was finally back. He took one step forward, falling forward as his legs gave out underneath him. He hit the floor face first, taking the bedside table down with him as his arms flung about trying to grab hold of something. The incident caused the noisiest crash as Steve laid stretched out on the floor, struggling to get up.
Steve looked surprised by Tony’s tone as Tony stood up from the desk with a heavy-laden sigh. “I’m sorry, Steve…I’m not trying to get into a fight about it either…but I’m done with Synergy. I don’t really care if the government picks it up or if Obie sells it for parts.”
“Why don’t we talk in the kitchen?” Tony looked around for somewhere to hang Steve’s jacket on, but ultimately ended up stringing it along one of the statues.
“Fucking figures. Obie’s a cad. He likes to stir shit up. You know that.” Tony shifted a bit but was clearly agitated by Obadiah’s antics.
Steve could see Tony watching him from out of the corner of his eye. He thought maybe that was too personal to begin with, but he could see that Tony was smiling.
“We know your CFO, Mr. Stane, is supposed to give the presentation for the converter…” the staffer motioned for the group to follow her inside, “but it would be so awesome if you could do it instead, Mr. Stark.”
“I’m really sorry, Steve…” Tony whispered.
“Well that means a lot coming from you.” Tony smirked. Steve was too focused on Tony to see that Sam was making a face at the two of them.
“Thanks.” He responded, now more annoyed with himself.
“You don’t have to make excuses to get your groove back, Tone.”
“Wow, haven’t seen a paper map in ages.” Clint cooed.
Tony then looked away from Steve, sighing loudly, before turning somewhat to look at him again. “…just because you make me come every night we’re together, Rogers, doesn’t mean I need your stamp of approval on everything I do.” He poked Steve in the chest a few times before backing away to stand in the middle of the office once again. Steve stared at him, not entirely sure how to respond.
“Tony? Where should we meet?”
“Wait, you asked Steve out?” Bruce, as he finally realized what Tony had said to him, turned to look directly at his friend.
“Why?” Bucky shrugged, “because you’re fucking my best friend? You can’t even fully commit there either.”
“So, I already know from our conversations what you like to listen to, Rogers. I hope you don’t mind given the terrible mood.” Steve waited as Tony busied himself with the record player.
. He already said that, Buck.” Sam playfully nudged Bucky in his bionic prosthetic arm as he drank from his beer. The three friends were sitting in a booth at their favorite dive bar not too far away from Steve and Sam’s apartment in Brooklyn.
Tony shrugged with a grin. “Well, it’s Captain Rogers. We’re seeing each other.” He kept smirking at the group to mask how embarrassed he was beginning to feel talking about Steve out loud like this, especially in front of Obadiah.
“Hi, Tony. It’s been so long since we’ve shared a meal.” She greeted as she pulled Tony into a hug. Tony nodded back as he reminded himself not to do something weird like smell her hair or feel up her backside during the hug.
He walked a few paces away from Steve as his call connected with the school’s main office.
“Steve, come on. Just be honest with me.”
Tony stared at the message for a minute or two before he heard a knock at his door. He flinched, but before he could answer, the door cracked open revealing Obadiah Stane. Tony groaned in his head but was sure his expression conveyed neutrality.
“You know, I don’t know if you remember, but I used to work at Stark Industries.” He volunteered.
Steve paid little attention to the incident as he walked inside, greeting the security guard before accessing the employee express elevator. After the elevator stopped on his floor, he walked as quickly as possible to the lab, hoping to see Tony.
"Why would you ask me that?" he asked, and Maria could tell by the look on her son's face that Tony was starting to panic.
Tony wasn't the only one who was shocked; Steve noticed the surprised look on Maria's face as well.
"Antonio," Maria said soothingly as she stood up and went over to where her son was seated, "there's no need to panic. It's something I noticed -- but your dad has no idea."
sounded like that before.
you to say it back until you're sure you feel it. But," he added, looking into Steve's crystal blue eyes, "when you
He talked about the group as a whole. How friendly and outgoing they were. How nice they were and even how Tony had taken to tutoring one of them -- Clint -- in geometry, and, in return, Clint was teaching Tony ASL.
, was the first thing that went through Steve's head when Tony leaned forward and captured Steve's lips in a chaste kiss.
Maria smiled softly. "Yes, dear. I asked how school was going?"
That made Bucky laugh, "We all know why you wear those things, buddy. You know how good you look in them."
Which was how Steve found himself at Stark Mansion on Saturday afternoon. He'd driven his bike there and had almost been denied entry, but then a man named Jarvis showed up and told security to let him through.
"What's in it?" Peter asked curiously, and Tony was happy that his son was showing an interest.
I'm so sorry it's taking me so long for updates. Between taking care of my mom, school, and working, my plate is incredibly full. Not to mention I've come down with a sinus infection that turned into bronchitis so I'm struggling with my health right now too. Thanks for holding on.
But they were too much like brothers to want anything like that.
"Yeah, I'm fine," Tony let him know. "Can you meet me in your bedroom in just a minute?"
Tony nodded.
"Good," Joe nodded. "We'd love to have the two of you."
Sarah nodded, "Yeah, Tony. We'd love to have you guys over here."
Steve felt his heart jump a little when he heard Tony admit he had a crush on someone. Who was it? Was it someone in their little group? Could it maybe be

anything, they had practically anything they could ever want, it was Christmas, and everybody should get gifts on Christmas. Also, when Steve had mentioned some of Tony's favorite foods, Sarah had gone out of her way to make them.
Tony had only been nervous a handful of times in his entire life.
-- he went out into the kitchen. The Starks wouldn't be here for a few hours yet, but Steve had a tradition of helping his mom cook dinner while Bucky always joined Joe in the living room for the Macy's Christmas Day Parade on television.
He sat on the bed, and maybe it was because Steve was anxious, but it felt like an eternity passed before Tony came through his bedroom door. He closed the door with a quiet
When Maria shook her head and said, "I couldn't do that," Sarah just fixed her with a look.
Steve had gone back and forth on what to give Tony. Tony pretty much had anything anybody could want -- and he had the kind of money to buy whatever he wanted. Even though his father tended to be strict about his money, Maria was often generous and gave Tony as much money as he wanted.
Peter sat down beside him and looked up at Tony, his brown eyes just studying his father.
George pretty much left Bucky's mom and his three sisters alone. It was just him.
"Yeah. Said he's been his friend for years. I'm nt sure how to make him feel more at ease and welcome."
People had often said that if there was anybody you could trust, it was the family of a preacher.
"Tony watches you when you're not looking; you shoot glances at him when he looks away," Bucky continued, as if he wasn't fazed by the look on Steve's face. "You are
Unfortunately, Steve knew a lot about those kinds of things because his dad would often talk to those less fortunate. Women and children that were in abuse shelters. Kids that were in residential foster homes and even youth that were in LGBT shelters.
Tony could easily keep up with any conversation, but Steve noticed how, when Joe brought the conversation around to sports cars, Tony seemed to light up and keep up with any conversation that Joe had brought his way. They were busy debating the best model of the year when Steve got up to help his mom take care of the dishes.
Her voice was soft, gentle. It was at that moment that Steve understood why Tony and Maria were so close.
, Natasha had told him in the same breath.
"I've heard that about you," Tony commented. He grabbed his duffel bag and lifted it over his shoulder. "A good friend of mine did research on you guys before I decided to stay here."
Okay, so Tony didn't really know if he needed to be on guard around Steve, or anybody else at this bed and breakfast, but he wanted to let him know, as subtle as possible, that he did have someone in his corner, and that guy had military training.
His father had just finished the prayer when the doorbell rang. They all knew that Steve was expecting Tony, so they weren't surprised in the least when Steve leapt up to answer the door. Usually, they didn't answer the door during mealtimes -- they ate on a schedule, so anybody who was close to the Rogers family knew that they'd just have to come back later -- but they all knew that Steve needed to talk to Tony, and he had made it very clear that he and Tony were going to have a very important chat.
"Steve," Tony said softly, carefully, "when I was in Malibu, nobody wanted to give me anything just because. Nobody wanted to kiss me hello, or just because. They wanted a piece of me, yes, and they wanted to fuck me, but not because of me. Never because of me. They wanted a piece of

shy about anyone you like -- dame
However, if Pepper were still alive, Tony wouldn't have gotten mixed up with Ty in the first place.
"Tony Edwards," Tony replied, shaking Steve's hand after a moment of hesitation. "This is my son, Peter."
The Rogers and Barneses had lived in the same apartment complex for a long time. And George Barnes had a drinking habit that everybody knew about, so it wasn't odd for Bucky to come over and hide out at the Rogers' apartment, because, as he'd often told Steve and his parents, he just didn't want to be around when his old man was hitting the bottle.
Bucky nodded, never once looking up from the paper.
Steve nodded, speechless.
-- but call her that and she'll cut you -- and she knew what it was like to transfer to a new school, especially since she had to go and live with her grandmother in New York after her father -- the only parent she'd ever known -- had died. She had a lot of sympathy for transfer students, because she not only had to go to a new
Everybody had heard about the new kid coming to school. They didn't get new kids very often, but this wasn't just
"You don't even know us," she stated, watching Steve and his parents closely. "Why would you buy us things?"
"Who the fuck decided that seven in the morning is a good time to start school?" Bucky groaned that morning. He was leaning up against the locker right next to Steve's, hands in the pockets of the black leather jacket he was wearing. Bucky looked the same as he did many mornings; dark blue jeans, his combat boots, and a black leather jacket over a grey tank. He had perfected the
But Tony had been the wrong kind of cautious. He knew he financially secure, but emotionally and physically, Tiberius had literally beaten him down and worn him away. He had believed for a long time nobody would ever want Peter except for Ty. Nobody would ever care about Tony the way Ty did. Even then, Ty barely put up with them -- except for when Tony was on the receiving end of one of his fists or angry, demeaning words.
"Buck, are you trying to get me to admit that I have a thing for Tony?" Steve finally snapped, pulling a pack of cigarettes out of his own leather jacket. Pulling one from the pack, he put it between his lips before putting the pack back from where he got it. Lighting it, he took a drag and then continued, "Yes, Buck. I got a thing for Tony. But what am I gonna do about it? Nothing. Not a. Damn. Thing."
"Our new guest has arrived. His name is Tony and he'll be staying here a month," Steve stated, watching his friend. Sam straightened up, wiping the sweat from his brow, and took a drink of water from the bottle attached to his tool belt. He turned to face Steve. Steve knew that face; Sam was waiting for more information. "He's got a boy, around ten, it looks like."
"Pete, we're safe here," Tony soothed his son. "You saw Steve, right? There are two other guys here who are just as big as he is."
Bucky was in a relationship with Natasha, and had been for a while, but everybody knew he was pan. And even though he was, he and Steve had never gone there, and never even wanted to, but Bucky could admit that Steve was very attractive.
"I'm not going to bring it up to your father, so don't worry about that," she added softly. "Just whatever you want to tell me, feel free. I'll always be here for you, Antonio. I love you."
"Stevie, you deserve better than that, and so does Tony," Bucky said. Nobody really saw the soft and sensitive side of James Barnes very often, but Steve knew why he was doing this. "You know how Tony's dad treats him. He deserves someone who's gonna love him, and I know you already do."
Sarah had always had a talent of telling what Steve was feeling, and she'd also always had a talent of being able to calm him down faster than anybody else could. And even though Bucky'd learned how to do it a long time ago, Sarah was faster and way more efficient than even Bucky could be.
Tony just nodded. Steve had a bit of anger at the way that Tony was so timid, but it wasn't at the boy himself. He just realized when somebody's gone through something so traumatic, they just didn't want to be vulnerable to anybody else. Bucky could be like that on occasion.
It was no secret that Tony hated his old man. He hated the way Howard acted, hated the way that he didn't give Maria the respect she deserved. His mom was
"I'm here to see you, Tony," Steve replied, and he couldn't help the hurt that laced through his voice. "I haven't seen you the last three days and I've been worried about you. If I didn't know better, I'd think that you were avoiding us."
Steve showed Tony and Peter to their room. "This is the nicest room we've got," he told him. "If you need anything, Sam, Bucky, and Natasha, or I will be around. If you have any problems or requests, let me know. We want to make your stay the most comfortable."
Bucky usually spent Christmas Day with them. His family did their thing on Christmas Eve, and he'd spent Christmas Day with Rogers family for years. His dad didn't care about him and his mom just wanted peace with their family, so she let him go.
After dinner, Bucky and Joe sat down to watch the football game while Ana, Jarvis, and Maria helped clear the table. When Sarah told them they were guests and she didn't expect it, Jarvis shook his head.
"You know, Antonio, if there's ever anything you want to talk about, you can come to me, right?" she asked gently. Dropping his pencil onto the desk, Tony turned around to catch his mother's eyes.
"I know you're nervous, baby," Sarah said soothingly as she put the turkey in the oven, "and I know that you like Tony a lot. But you need to calm down or else you're going to hyperventilate."
"I love you, too, Mom."
"He seemed...unsure. Like he isn't sure what to expect. There's something about Tony that I just can't put my finger on." He cleared his throat before continuing, "He's a friend of a friend."
"My wife," Jarvis nodded. "We're close with both Master Tony and his mother."
to Tony, and if someone mistreated her, they were automatically on Tony's bad list.
Steve grinned. "A friend of Rhodey's is a friend of mine," he stated. "Welcome to the bed and breakfast."
"First friends you've ever really had, right?" Maria smiled softly. Tony nodded.
And something about Steve, something about how easy-going and how friendly the boy was, he made Tony feel like the weight had just been lifted off of his shoulders.
"But how do we know we can trust them?" Peter asked, his voice shaking a bit and tears welling up in his eyes. Tony hated that look and distrust. Peter was ten years old. He shouldn't have to worry about the trustworthiness of random hotel owners at his age.
much.
And the enthusiasm in Tony's voice made Steve smile softly. He sounded like a kid on Christmas. And even though it was indeed Christmas, Tony had never sounded that small before. Even when he was talking about things he loved, or was passionate about, he had
Truth be told, Tony affected Steve the same goddamned way.
"He mentioned Rhodey."
"Yeah?" Sam stopped raking the leaves again and looked over at him.
"Great!" he exclaimed. He looked back to catch his mother's eye. "I met a really nice group of kids. They aren't as smart as me, granted, but they don't look down on me for it."
When they broke the kiss mere moments later, Tony looked at Steve and said, "Now that my dad knows I'm not straight, nothing is going to stop me from dating whomever I want to. So, Steve, would you want to go out with me? Get dinner?"
Natasha, with her red hair behind her in an intricate French braid, took one look at Steve and then said, "You hear about the new kid? He's coming today."
Instead of Steve being the one to breach the space, Tony did it. A few seconds passed before Tony reached out and cupped Steve's cheek.
Bucky nodded. "What about the dad?"
"What do you mean?" he asked her, trying to act nonchalant.
"He seems like he's got something on his mind, but he's nice enough. I told him if there's anything we can do, to let us know."
and then looked at Steve.
"Seem well-behaved?" Bucky asked, flipping a page in the paper.
. Someone that Joe wasn't
Tony always kissed Steve like it was the last time he ever was going to, and that was bittersweet for Steve. He loved that Tony kissed him that way, but did Tony do it because he was expecting Steve to leave?
"Please, Steve, just call me Jarvis," he answered him. Steve nodded at that.
“How long does it take to generate the material?”
“Yeah I know, I heard you.” Tony teased.
Something was still bothering Tony about this trip; he was confused by Steve’s intentions. Tony remembered that Steve had told him on the phone that he wasn’t looking for a relationship at the moment, but here they were on a wedding getaway for the bridal party, sharing a suite obviously meant for a couple, a situation Steve seemed unwilling to fix.
“Come in!” Obadiah’s voice emanated on the other side.
Natasha smiled to herself although she was exhausted from worrying about Clint all night. She took her time turning to open the door to the room. As soon as she opened the door, Laura saw her almost immediately, waving for her to come inside, rising from her chair near Clint’s bed to give her a hug.
me?” He repeated.
Bruce shook his head. “Loki, you have no idea about the amount of damage you’ve already caused so I would cool it with the assumptions.”
“Nice to meet you, Mr. Wilson.”
“Okay, that sounds like a plan.” Tony agreed as Steve nodded.
Tony let out an exasperated sigh as he jogged after Peter down the hallway to the nine-year-old’s bedroom. “Oh yeah?” Steve could hear their feet patter across the wood flooring as Tony responded to Peter, “I’m pretty sure if I go in there, something will swallow me alive.”
Both Sam and Bucky nodded quicky. “Yep, Steve.” Bucky responded.
Despite the damage the robot had wrought on the auditorium, no one sustained any serious injuries. Yet the following day, Steve and Tony had received a phone call from Peter’s school with an earnest request from the principal to meet her for an emergency meeting that day.
The crowd started cheering louder as Steve shuffled a couple feet to stand next to Tony who had a perpetual grin on his face. Steve coughed, which was once again picked up by the mic. He grimaced, becoming hyper aware that everyone could hear every single noise he uttered.
“Thanks, Steve.” Peter answered as he unbuckled his seatbelt, but before he could get out of the car, Tony gently grab him by the elbow.
Tony grinned. Something about it was alarmingly charming. Well, more like arrestingly captivating, to say the least.
Steve looked back and forth at Tony and Bucky. “Well, uh yeah, but…Tony I thought you said you wanted to relax a bit?” He had worked himself up all night about having a conversation with Tony that he had missed his chance at the dinner and now knew he needed to talk to Tony before the party that night.
“That felt really good…” Steve breathed out.
Steve shook his head, trying to calm himself down. “Tony, I’m—”
Tony nodded again as he let Pepper hold his hand a bit longer before their waiter walked over to take their food orders.
“Yeah. The blonde you said. So much life experience for a thirty-something. He should be interesting to get to know.” Rhodey nodded slightly as he continued to read through Steve’s file, never breaking eye contact with the folder.
Steve nodded as he looked around. “Okay, maybe we can get someone to let us in—”
The longer they stood next to the device, the more nervous Obadiah became, but he wasn’t entirely sure what Thanos was trying to achieve. They had what they wanted; making the device bigger would only destroy everything around it, and not replicate weaponry like Obadiah had originally envisioned.
Tony shook his head. “Everything is fine, Rogers. We’ll have it under control before the fair.” He reached over to pat Peter on the back who nodded back vigorously.
Suddenly, Tony stopped walking for a split second to seriously assess the statement, watching Pepper continue down the hallway. He figured that might usually be the case, especially when he was younger and overly confident in his genius. But Steve was good at what he does.
“Rogers figured out that when we take the device out into the field, we can queue the figures before sending the specs to be replicated. This way, the device will also remember the sequences which will save us some time in the future.”
“That’s okay, Rogers. Maybe next time.” Tony mentally scolded himself for being so open with his last statement, but Steve continued to smile at him.
made it to the museum.”
Steve turned to a degree to look at Tony. “Yeah, of course, Tony.”
told you all that you have no idea what you’re dealing with…so I’m not saying anything.” Loki turned to face Thor, “Thanos is more dangerous now than he’s ever been. You really think I’m going to risk my life to help you?” He turned in his chair, appearing close to leaving.
“I’m sure he’ll be super excited to see you.” Steve whispered as they reached the bedroom.
Steve shot up straight in the bed as he heard Sam calling for him out in the living room. The force of the movement woke Tony who made a few disgruntled noises.
“Hey, Tony…” Steve waved at Tony before quickly shoving both hands into the front pockets of his pants as he walked into the foyer.
“Peter!” Tony cried, “is he okay?”
Even though Tony had initially kept the trip away from him, Steve still felt close to him, close enough to consider their relationship serious although they hadn’t said anything out loud. Steve wanted to have that conversation but knew better not to bring it up while Tony was dealing with his past childhood trauma that weekend.
“You know…,” Tony started, smiling through another kiss as his hands traveled down Steve’s backside, “I could probably come from just rubbing your ass…”
Obadiah stared at Tony before grinning slightly. He brushed himself off before responding. “Relax, my boy. Impetuous anger doesn’t look good on you.” He grinned before spinning around to walk away from Tony in the opposite direction.
Tony straightened up as best as he could to gawk at Steve. “You’ve
Tony stared blankly at Steve before it became clear that he realized what Steve was referring to.
It was the afternoon before the investor event that evening, and Tony was on his way to meet Obadiah and Pepper in one of the smaller conference rooms in Stark Tower. He took the private express elevator from the penthouse to the designated floor, dreading the meeting but thankful that Pepper would be there to facilitate a buffer between himself and Obadiah.
Tony waved Steve off as he laughed to himself before answering. “Steve, that’s really nice of you…” he then moved a hand to rub Steve’s hand on his arm.
Steve turned to Tony who looked despondent. “Tony, it’s not that bad. Like, Mr. Beck said, everyone could use some therapy and that’s better than Peter failing the class.”
“Fury, Thanos is trying to use Synergy to build a core similar to the vibranium one. We have to cease operations before he can get his hands on it.”
“Thanks for fitting me into your schedules,” he began lightheartedly, “I wanted to disclose to you all a close relationship I have with one of the members of Synergy…” Tony inhaled once more as everyone intently waited for him to finish.
Agent Hill walked up to the monitor to get a better look. She nodded before turning to face Agent Coulson.
Steve nodded as he walked to the fridge, he looked around inside without picking anything before slumping into a chair at the kitchen table. He could feel Sam staring at him.
Steve mentally perused through past details concerning his relationship with Tony: Tony had been more than great while Steve was in recovery and Steve felt a wonderful connection toward Peter, also. Steve truly believed that the three of them could be a family someday.
Steve pushed into his body, taking his time before going faster. Tony moaned and squirmed underneath him, letting Steve push more into his body.
Steve nodded as he approached Tony. He reached out a hand to rub Tony’s cheek before kissing him again.
Tony acknowledged Steve, but Steve could feel that there was something wrong.
Then, Steve wondered: could Tony’s behavior be connected to his relationship with his father? Steve wasn’t in expert in psychology, of course, but he had personal experience with mental health issues.
Tony remained on his forearms before getting up to sit down in his chair, opposite from Steve. He thought about teasing him more but decided against it considering that it was obvious Steve hadn’t appreciated him using an untested device on his face.
“Hey! I’m home!” Tony shouted, dropping his work bag on the floor as soon as the elevator doors opened into the penthouse.
“Uh,” Tony began, not really sure what he was trying to say, but he didn’t want to talk about Bucky, “that’s cute…” He finally answered.
Natasha nodded sternly. “Gotcha.”
Tony was lounging his chair, half covering his face from how furious he had become since the meeting started. Part of him wanted to call Obadiah out in front of everyone, but he would risk losing control over any possible contract bids.
Tony groaned as he tried to get up from the floor, staggering from the aches. He leaned up against the desk, trying to give himself enough courage to confront Steve and finally do what he should have done a long time ago.
Steve waited for the sound of Tony’s footsteps to disappear. He hesitated before jumping out of the bed to reach his overnight bag. He found Howard’s diary before returning to the bed, cautiously turning it over and over in his hands. He remarked to himself how elaborate the diary’s structure appeared; the paper inside was heavy and coarse, filled with elegant script and sketches.
“Well, goddamn, Rogers. This is incredible. I haven’t even thought of that.” Tony had his arms crossed when Steve turned to face him again. He was smiling uncontrollably. Steve nearly blushed, realizing he had impressed a tech genius.
“Hey! I don’t know what you’re—ugh…forget it.” Tony picked up a few napkins from the counter to dry his shirt. As he tried to make himself look more presentable before summoning up enough courage to speak to Steve in a casual setting, Tony felt someone place a hand on his shoulder.
good looking.”
“…Steve…I…you’re…the…sexiest person I’ve ever been with…” he cringed as soon as the words left his mouth.
The carrier coughed a few times before answering. “I have this package here for a ‘Mr. Obadiah Stane’.”
Plant another. Wipe all email traces.
“Mechanical engineering.” She answered, now grinning.
But before he could really get anywhere, suddenly the back of his head felt weirdly numb. As Clint tried to process what just happened, his knees buckled underneath him as he fainted.
Tony sighed; he knew he screwed up with not being transparent about the failsafe, but he couldn’t address it now.
Steve waited before leaning inward to kiss Tony. “Tony, just know that I’m here for you, okay? We have to be a team, like always.” He kissed Tony again.
Obadiah’s mouth dropped opened, bobbing open and close for some time as he tried to mentally parse through the situation he had found himself in.
Steve nodded as he turned to lean up against the console. “Tony, I just wanted to say thank you for including me…”
“Tony…” Tony was still facing away from Steve.
Tony crossed his arms as he looked downward at his chest. He knew she was right, but part of him wanted Pepper to embrace the risk and help him somehow.
--ladyslice
The two friends were dressed in their nicest partywear as they rode the private express elevator in Stark Tower up to Tony’s penthouse. Steve knew Sam would appreciate accompanying him to a Tony Stark shindig; also, it sort of gave Steve an excuse not to bring a date.
“I wanted to tell you that I had a great first day before heading out.” Tony swallowed before he turned around to face Steve who was smiling. He had one hand in the front pocket of his slacks; he was leaning, looking incredibly attractive.
The door creaked open slowly, first showing a tiny hand before the rest of Peter emerged from the hallway.
“Come on, big guy. You can let off steam in the lab.” Bruce motioned for Shuri to follow them to their lab.
He rolled his eyes. “I know this is a setback, but we have the schematics. And I’m sure your father can bid for a reasonable price on vibranium. God knows the Wakandans have an immense supply of it…”
“This is a significantly smaller version, so whatever is emanated stays composed. But I’m trying for something bigger.” Thanos responded as he turned around to exit the safety room.
With a bit of a withdrawn smile, Steve looked over at Tony who was grinning. “Well it helps having a great partner. Nice to meet you too, Colonel.”
“Tony, you need to fix this
“Didn’t know I was that popular.” Steve answered, but Tony could sense that he was genuinely surprised by the comment.
Steve chuckled. “I think he would end up having the best time, too.”
“Who the fuck is trying to sabotage Synergy?”
Tony looked quite puzzled himself. “We, uh…well…don’t you—”
Steve took his time reading over each word, studying it closely as if the text would magically rearrange itself into a letter of regret.
“Our newest team member is proving to be a great asset. Excellent work!” Thor nearly shouted out in the hallway which caused Steve to blush again.
Tony stood completely still, too shocked to even open the envelope. He looked back toward the security desk before quickly accessing the private express elevator. During the trip back up to the penthouse, Tony stared blankly at the letter, debating with himself whether he should read it or throw it away.
Tony and Steve followed Strange into a building built temporarily in the middle of the park. As they walked toward the clinic, they came across several hospital beds containing people being treated by several nurses and doctors.
After stomping out conference room, both Tony and Steve managed to avoid each other the rest of the day: Steve went back to the lab, and Tony had retreated to his office. However, after ruminating on their argument and sulking alone in his apartment, Steve finally decided that it was probably best to talk to Tony in person. It was obvious that the failsafe fiasco had only heightened their issues.
spent time together that wasn’t mentally or physically painful…”
He then bit the bottom half of his lip. “Why don’t you do that? What you like…” He offered softly.
Thanos sighed as if he were already bored with the conversation. “Unfortunately, Mr. Stane failed in delivering us the device and its vibranium core, but I found a better use for him—”
“Lovers' spat.” Bruce said out loud to everyone in the room as soon as the door closed.
Tony waited before continuing. “…I also brought some snacks…but those are for me, obviously…” He choked back another sob, “…you know how I like to graze…” he attempted to joke, rubbing Steve’s leg more vigorously.
Tony stared back at Steve as Steve walked away from him. “I’m trying to be patient with you, Tony, but you’re really driving me to the edge.”
“Um? Oh, it’s morning already?” Tony squiggled as Steve held onto him.
Bucky had once mentioned to Steve while the three were out for drinks. Both Bucky and Steve had served in the army together prior to Steve entering law school at Columbia University. However, their paths ultimately diverged; Bucky chose to continue his military career while Steve sought to pursue his dream of becoming a public defender. While serving, Steve had risen to the rank of Captain, which led to his ubiquitous nickname that stuck after he was honorably discharged. Steve found the nickname to be annoying at times; the unit was a team. Yet, even he could admit that his nickname had its moments of endearment. Almost all his closest friends referred to him as “Cap”, especially when he was in a stern, yet nurturing mood.
“Steve, you are so hot even when you’re embarrassed.” Tony chuckled, trying to get Steve to let go of the pillow.
