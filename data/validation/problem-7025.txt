Tony cursed silently as Pepper launched into her explanation of the disastrous board meeting, information that he had never wanted less than at this moment. Shouldn’t saving the city of New York buy you at least a few months of freedom from glad-handing a bunch of millionaires who couldn’t guess the price of a screwdriver if they had three chances each? He was going to take the whole team on vacation, deep undercover on an island somewhere. Bruce could get some color that wasn’t green. Thor had gone wild for that documentary about snorkeling, and Steve could –
On the bright side, they had been right to think that Zemo wouldn’t expect Tony to have company. Soon after the Quinjet landed on the remote oilrig where Zemo’s coordinates had led them, the team had been greeted by a soft voice over an intercom congratulating them on their curve ball.
“Hey guys,” Coulson said, the faintest of movements playing around his lips. “Sorry for the dramatic entrance. But my new ride has cloaking technology, and you were really teeing me up there.”
“My apologies, friends,” Thor replied, still beaming at them as Steve bent to sweep the shards into a dustpan. “I found the Captain’s speech very stirring.”
“What the fuck?” Tony asked: rhetorically, because the fourth floor was almost clear of people by now. He made his own way to the stairs, chewing absently at his lip as he tried to process why exactly Grant’s question had struck him so strangely. He was sure he hadn’t actually seen anything in the Carter collection about shield technology, but for some reason it sounded familiar. Could he have come across it somewhere else? Maybe in Erksine’s notes or -
The warm sensation in Steve’s stomach cooled instantly, condensing into an icy weight that sank straight through his torso. Right. He and Tony were having sex. They weren’t cuddling on Tony’s couch or cooking dinner together or whatever people who were dating did at the end of a long day. That wasn’t Tony’s speed, Steve reminded himself firmly. Or maybe
“Great,” he said. “Well, it’s been fun while it lasted, Rogers. We’ll never have Paris, etcetera. I know the drill.”
“Bold of you to assume the first faculty meeting of the year is going to get out early,” Bruce noted with a small smile. “I’d ask if you’ve forgotten the Great Academic-Credit-for-Internships Filibuster of 2015, but I’ve seen the way your left eye twitches whenever someone says ‘experiential learning.’”
, but then he finally caught sight of the Ace bandages wrapped around Steve’s right wrist — a make-shift splint holding his hand at a stiff angle.
He made his way out from behind the desk and began to move toward the back of the building in a slow but determined totter, waving Tony along with one hand.
"We need to talk about where we're taking Rhodey for his birthday when he gets back from his mission overseas. Thanks for the coffee!" she called after him.
Right, family. Tony cut sideways across the page in search of “Carter” and started running through the names of Peggy’s close relatives, popping each one into Google to check for any time spent at Brooklyn Community College: brother, Michael (no), husband, Daniel (no), great-niece, Sharon (no), daughter, Ana (no), son, Steven –
He thought he should probably ask whether Tony was okay – or make a joke to cut the tension that was making the air in the room feel thicker all of a sudden – but the only thoughts he could formulate were mortifying variations of “wow” and “beautiful.”
“Is there anything that shuts you up?” Steve murmured with a smile, pausing in his progress to press Tony’s back against the wall of the hallway and capture his mouth in a searing kiss.
“Yeah that’s my impression of you,” Steve said wryly, “that you’re a guy who finds it really hard to get what you want.”
“Hang on,” someone ordered him urgently, and the last thing he clung to was the sound of that voice.
“Well, it’s you, Wilson, so that could mean anything,” Tony pointed out. “Steve could pin you while leaking spinal fluid out of both his ears.”
“I’m Skye!” the younger woman said brightly, shooting up from her spot at the table. “I’m the hacker. SHIELD consultant. Field agent. Well soon I’ll be a field agent.” She shot a look at May, who raised one eyebrow almost imperceptibly. “Probably soon. And I know who you are, obviously. Legends.”
“Congratulations,” Natasha announced wryly. “You’ve finally broken the code. I hope you enjoyed playing along: the theme of this escape room was ‘basic emotional communication.’”
Tony’s hands moved to clasp Steve’s sides, and Steve couldn’t hold back a gasp at the sudden stab of pain through his ribs. He’d lost track of how long he’d been chained to the ceiling by his wrists, but the wrenches in his shoulders and back had eventually become monotonous enough that his brain had turned them into background noise. Now the tiniest shift in his position sent a spear slicing across his nerves.
“No no no no no,” Tony whispered, compressing frantically with every syllable. “Please, Steve. Come on. Don’t do this. Don’t leave me. I can’t –”
Tony held out the most recent example for Rhodey’s inspection. Steve was wearing a blue checked shirt tucked into khakis and posing with a grocery-store employee who had apparently helped him find a new flavor of Pop Tarts to try for Thor. The grocery worker – a scrawny teenage boy with a mop of black hair – looked like he was going to cry or possibly throw up after being so close to Captain America. And who could blame him, really, because Steve was giving one of his softest lopsided smiles – one eyebrow quirked as if in apology for how impossibly photogenic he was.
“Steve’s alive,” Clint said quickly. “Tony, he’s alive.” He gripped Tony’s shoulder as Tony pitched forward, clutching at his chest.
“I wouldn’t,” Natasha cautioned. “You haven’t seen what he’s been like in here. I have. That man is not stable.”
“You don’t have to come, you know,” Tony said, ignoring the part of his mind that was already shriveling at the possibility that Steve would take the out. “I know big parties aren’t really your thing. If you’d rather just catch up with Sam and Bucky —”
“Nothing,” he replied, “or something totally normal and not at all emotionally compromising – choose your own adventure, Cap. Anyway, I’m going to go see a man about some sheep: counting, that is, not shearing – probably shouldn’t operate any more machinery under the circumstances –”
Steve sat up carefully, shifting Natasha’s weight so that her head stayed cradled in the crook of his left arm.
“Yeah, well,” he muttered finally, “you’re not wrong about losing the popularity vote. So just try not to put any of my employees through a wall when this hits the fan.”
“He’s out,” Natasha said a moment later, tapping Clint's shoulder, and the two of them looked down to see Tony’s unconscious form sprawled on the ground – one of his hands still stretched toward Clint’s foot. “Time for round two.”
Pepper sighed deeply, pinching the bridge of her nose in a move Tony recognized as analogue to the Jaw Clench of Judgment.
“It’s the same room,” Steve remarked. “And don’t –” He held up a finger as Tony’s mouth opened automatically. “– call me Captain Obvious. Let’s check the next one.”
“Shh, okay Rogers,” Tony smiled, covering one of Steve’s hands with his. “I believe you. And if you’re really that fond of our darkest hours, we can reenact the incident at the Secretary of State's Office as many times as you want.”
“Yeah, sure,” Tony allowed, waving one hand vaguely in acknowledgment. “Ty’s a massive douchebag: no argument here. But then again, I sure know how to pick ‘em, right?”
“You’re not in trouble, are you?” he asked James cautiously. “Because seriously, I wasn’t joking about the college’s life insurance policy, and the health insurance is even worse.”
“Must have taken the briefest of naps on top of the parts for your new utility belt,” Tony explained, his eyes fluttering shut as Steve’s fingers carded through his hair in pursuit of the metal coil.
“You’re terrified of losing him,” she mused. “And you know it’s only a matter of time before that fear makes you do something disastrously stupid. The lovers’ pact frees you from all that.”
“A soundproof one preferably,” Bruce put in plaintively from two doors down. “Some of us are very light sleepers.”
“If Tony needs anything with your name on it, it’s a restraining order,” Pepper snapped, wrapping her arm through Tony’s. “Now go offend someone else with your overpriced cologne. There isn’t enough Bond No. 9 in the world to make
“You have a problem, man!” Rhodey yelled after Clint’s feet as they slithered away from the opening in the ducts. “Get help!”
Next came an order to report for duty at Camp Lehigh signed by Colonel Chester Phillips (a confirmation, at least, of the connection suggested by Erksine’s notes); notes from a doctor’s exam (featuring a truly stunning number of conditions that would have disqualified most enlistees from service); a ration card, with the regiment left blank and the hash marks indicating regular supplies had been collected for only half the period (the missing weeks suggesting that Rogers had either tried to go cold turkey on sweets or had spent substantial time behind enemy lines in September); and a transcript of an order for troop movement, which indicated that Rogers had left for London in September 1943 in the company of James Morita, James Montgomery Falsworth, Gabe Jones, Jacques Dernier, Timothy Alloysius Cadwaller Dugan, and James Buchanan Barnes (one of those names, at least, Tony knew he had come across in Carter’s biography - though Dugan had been going by “Dum Dum” by then).
“For months now my team has been tracking an initiative called Project Centipede,” Coulson continued, “Even before we knew they were HYDRA, we knew they wanted this.”
A wave of emotions passed over Tony’s face, and before Steve could track them, Tony was leaning forward to kiss him. Steve tilted his head upward with a sigh, seeking out the press of Tony’s lips as Tony held him gently in place with a hand on his shoulder. When Tony pulled back, Steve shivered, feeling a sweet sting linger in the place where Tony’s tongue had swept across the seam of his mouth.
“Steve!” he yelled, scrabbling frantically at the hands that Natasha was now using to shove him firmly back in bed.
Steve had been called away shortly after the meeting with Ward and had been gone for two days on a mission somewhere in the Indian Ocean with Natasha and the SHIELD strike team. It was pure coincidence that Tony was catching him so soon after he got back, because he definitely hadn’t told JARVIS to alert him as soon as Steve and Natasha returned to the Tower. And since he couldn’t have known the mission was over, Tony definitely hadn’t moved up his coffee run to increase the chance of bumping into them to confirm they were okay. Why would he be worried? After all, he
“Guess I should have asked what week it was too,” Tony muttered. The cords of muscle in his arms flexed as he ran his hands through his hair. “Are we headed to a floor that has coffee – or maybe a giant syringe of adrenaline? If the Spy Kids are back, I could probably get Romanov to stab me in the neck again. Actually, if she just looked at me the right way, I’d probably have a Pavlovian fight-or-flight response that might be good for a few hours of terrified wakefulness." He cleared his throat. "Uhhh...Ground Control to Major Tom: do you read me?”
“Are you sure you know what you’re doing here, man?” he asked gently. “I know you and Pepper have been having a rough time since New York. And don’t think I haven’t noticed how much less you’re sleeping either. Are you sure this –” he gestured at the phone, “is healthy right now?”
“Of course I do, Steve,” Tony replied simply. “You’re the best man I know. And now I don’t want to be too forward,” he gave a small squeeze with the hand that was resting on Steve’s ass, “given your old-fashioned sensibilities –”
“He’ll take the conditions,” Pepper promised, her eyes narrowing and one foot shooting toward Tony’s shin under the table.
“You’re doing this,” he accused her. “Are you a –?” He reached out and touched her shoulder experimentally, and she rolled her eyes as his fingers made contact with the fabric of her robe.
“Or maybe you’re just getting better at detecting humor that’s pitched at a lower volume than your eyewear.”
Tony didn’t quite look at Steve as he finished, his eyes flitting around to the shadowy baseball posters and pennants tacked up around the room, and a horrible thought crept into Steve’s head.
Steve swam forward to peer through the window on the door, and now he could see water rushing in from the other side as well. Natasha would have been moving slower with Tony’s weight to carry. If they hadn’t made it to the deck before the second explosion…
Tony sighed, rubbing at the bridge of his nose, and for a moment Steve saw the flicker of a different face – another sweep of brown hair – as someone reached down to pull him up from the alley pavement.
He barely made it around the corner and into the hallway before he was being swung around and held against the wall, one of Steve’s hands planted firmly against his chest.
“In Asgard, one year lasts 7,000 Midgardian days,” Thor declared, now back from the kitchen and dipping three tater tots meditatively into a mixing bowl of ketchup, “and we celebrate the dawning of a new age by tapping a barrel of Ymir’s mead and bathing together in the blood of a newly conquered enemy.”
“Glad to know you’re still discovering new reasons to be disappointed in me,” Tony continued, interrupting Steve’s thoughts. “Even after all the years you’ve known me, it’s good to know that I can still find new ways to let you down.”
“That’s what you think,” Tony shot back. He was tapping a high-speed tattoo against the railing next to him, the motion so frenetic that Steve wasn’t sure he even knew he was doing it.
“I’m going to take care of it,” Steve said, all the feelings that could slip past the ice concentrated into that one promise. “Tony is a fighter, Pepper, and if there’s any way – I’m going to get him back.”
“No you haven’t!” Steve replied, his voice almost gleeful with relief. “See?” He wrapped his other hand behind Tony’s shoulders and pulled him up gently, moving slowly enough that Tony could feel the pain lessen as they went.
“Why should I bother about that now that I’ll get to look at your pants anytime I want?” Steve countered reasonably. “Save the artistry for a real work of art.”
“Historians of weapons technology in World War II have the blessing and the curse of being spoiled for choice,” he began. “The atomic bomb, the cavity magnetron, and even the disastrously ill-made and unconscionably named Panjamdrum: the second world war produced no shortage of objects designed to alter and shorten the course of human life.”
“Yeah, I’ve got one,” Tony said casually, using his phone to bring up a projection of his own. “What’s Project TAHITI?”
“This was too lightweight,” Natasha shook her head. “They sent military-grade equipment to take out two men alone and could only manage the digital equivalent of a homemade pipe bomb for five sixths of the Avengers? They’re either stalling us or sending some kind of warning.”
“According to Lord Banner, the markings on the knight’s shield don’t match any of the coats of arms on our muster rolls,” Rhodes continued. “I have Lady Romanov making inquiries among the newer arrivals at court and Sir Barton buying rounds of ale at the tavern, but so far, they’ve had no luck. If anyone in York knows the name of the knight who wears a silver star, they’re not telling.”
Steve had to pause to swallow past a sudden tightness in his throat. He hadn't talked about Gulmira in months, and he wasn't even sure he could get the words out anymore. Tony waited, tipping his head sideways to rest on one hand, as if to offer Steve time to decide what to offer in response.
“Oh for Christ’s sake,” Tony muttered, rolling his eyes. “Tell Barton he can shove – wait a minute, what happened to my TV?!”
"It doesn't take much." Grant peered close, frowning. "Hey, you still look a little pale. You headed to campus?"
“It’s at the base of the skull, by the olfactory nerves,” Simmons added. “They must have injected it through the nasal cavity.”
Steve tore his eyes away from his phone to see that Natasha was observing him, lips quirked and one eyebrow slightly raised.
Not that his mood had anything to do with the fact that Steve Rogers had not rematerialized since the incident with Ty. Tony was absolutely not hoping Steve would be drawn out by his and Natasha’s duet to “All the Things She Said” — or that he would appear after Thor left to round up everyone who looked strong enough to perform the human “flipping” called for by the game’s title. This last portion of the entertainment was perhaps-mercifully kaboshed by the party host, Maria Hill, who successfully redirected Clint’s attention to a tray of mini cheesecakes, and Tony had taken the opportunity to find a quiet spot to lean against the wall, hoping the cooler pressure at the back of his head would settle some of his nausea.
Steve must have gotten a signal from Clint, because his muscles slowly relaxed. Tony heard him set the gun back down, and then his hand moved up to the nape of Tony’s neck, where his thumb swept gently back and forth across Tony’s skin.
He shoved his rolling chair backward across his home office, ignoring the faint crackle of protest from the stray, ungraded paper he ran over on the way, and grabbed his dog-eared copy of Peggy Carter’s only biography, the somewhat regrettably titled
He’d just gotten back from SHIELD headquarters, and when he saw the elevator closing, he jogged a few paces across the lobby to keep the doors from sliding shut. By the time they bounced open to reveal Tony tapping away at his phone, it was already too late for Steve to change his mind. So he took a deep breath and stepped inside, doing his best to keep his posture loose and open.
"Tony, please," he said, reaching out to shake Grant's hand. He found he liked the way it had sounded coming out of Grant's mouth earlier, and there was only a 43% chance it was the commanding, assured way he’d said it. "Thanks again for helping me out - though I still don't get how you did."
No photographs of family, Tony noticed - merely as a professional observation, of course. If he filed that information away for any reason, it was as further evidence that Dr. James Grant was a workaholic.
“I’ll call,” Tony said, drumming his fingertips on the table. Steve finally broke eye contact to look down at the movement, and Tony watched in disbelief as his jaw somehow set even further: like concrete getting pressed into granite.
“Because ‘we tried our best, and that’s all we can do’?” Tony asked, not quite in the mood to be talked out of his stomach-full of dread. “I wasn’t under the impression that anyone in this room was wowing their therapists with an ability to accept their personal limitations.”
Steve woke to the pressure of two callused fingertips resting against his carotid artery: the first touch he’d felt in days that wasn’t aiming to bruise or shred. It took a few moments to adjust his eyes to the shaft of fluorescent light falling in from the open door to his cell, but Steve already knew whose hands were brushing across his neck.
Tony twisted gracefully out of Steve’s hold and then jabbed a few rapid rounds at his outstretched hands.
“That’s none of your business,” Tony responded automatically, sitting back in his chair and folding his arms across his chest. “You’re not the boss of me.”
“No!” Tony gasped, trying to lurch toward Steve’s shoe. But Natasha grabbed Steve’s wrist and dragged him backward.
That earned him a clenched jaw and a furrowed brow. Good. At least Steve angry was better than Steve distant or stoic – Steve as he had looked in the helicopter, so goddamn impassive that Tony couldn’t tell whether he was literally made of stone or whether he was trying to conceal a mortal injury.
“So they just dressed him up like that to – what? Make him seem scarier? That’s super racist,” Clint shook his head.
Steve could see Tony’s eyes widen as he followed Happy’s gaze and spied the dark splotch spreading across Steve’s shirt.
He was startled out of his reverie by the pinging sound of a calendar alert from his computer. He pivoted on top of the desk to check the monitor and swore violently. Shit. In his excitement over his father’s notebook, Tony had completely forgotten that the application for summer research funding was due by midnight - and so far, all Tony had was a completely unusable first line: “You know who I am.”
A little bit of petty delight flushed though Tony, and he ate the rest of his pasta in celebration. "Looks like Professor Perfect isn't so faultless after all," Tony mused. "Wonder if the new Dean has noticed one of his recent hires is a Truant Tricia."
Darcy suddenly tipped her head to the side. "You know you're drinking out of both coffees, right? Isn't the other one for Ms. Potts?"
“So lost and so clueless.” Natasha shook her head. “Maybe they’ll get there eventually. But people these days have lost the spirit somehow. They’re so afraid to take the leap – to make a real commitment.”
Tony stared at him, a vague sense that he was going to get an “I told you so” from Pepper floating into his mind.
“Steve!” Tony yelled, banging against the door that had blown shut behind him. “Steve! Can you hear me?”
Fury was standing at the head of the table, flanked by two women Tony had never seen before. The younger of the two was busily at work on a laptop, but she looked up and let out a small “Oh my God” when she saw them enter. The other woman had more of the dress and demeanor of a SHIELD agent. As she turned to face them, her crossed arms and impassive expression made Tony suddenly think about the thin metal lids that sealed the containers of nitroglycerin in his workshop.
Steve stared at his screen in momentary confusion before a second buzz made his heart leap straight into his throat.
“You’re accusing me of trickery, Rogers?” he replied, “That’s rich coming from the guy who deliberately spilled his beer all over Clint to win our last Smash melee.”
“That Wilson guy’s with her,” Clint responded over the comms. “I gave her the high sign – she’ll know how to get them off the grid.”
“Oh my God, Steve,” he managed, at the same time that Clint let out a loud, “Fuck.” Tony could hear Steve’s pulse thundering against his temple, and it was the most beautiful sound he’d ever heard. He pressed deeper into it, retracting the gauntlet so that he could dig his fingers into the warmth of Steve’s arms. If he held on tight enough, he couldn’t feel how hard his hands were shaking.
“Hey, losers,” Natasha said, popping her head in the doorway. “Clint’s already texting me photos of ‘the Leaning Tower of Pizza,’ so if we want to get there before he’s puking in the bushes and singing ‘Single Ladies’ to regurgitated pepperoni, we better get this show on the road.”
“I think there was talk of kissing me, Rogers,” Tony pointed out, though he knew Steve had to feel him leaning into the touch.
Okay, so…that could have been a complete coincidence. Steve clearly hadn’t meant to imply anything. And now he was probably embarrassed because he didn’t want Tony to get the wrong idea. Or maybe it was just like – a little crush. The pants thing. Tony had very well-made pants, and Steve had noticed. But Steve was definitely not signaling that he wanted anything from Tony, because now he clearly looked like he wanted to bolt out of the room and never return. Speaking of which, Tony should probably be saying something and not just sitting there staring.
“Tony, you have to relax, man,” Rhodey said. “If you don’t get your heart rate down, they’re going to call a code, and Steve –”
It was a transparent lie - Tony hadn’t heard a line so poorly rehearsed since he'd poked his head into Parker's girlfriend's latest rehearsal of
“The vase I broke when I sprinted into the kitchen would beg to differ,” Steve smiled. “But it’s not that. I just wanted to do this for you: a big dinner and sitting down with family.”
Steve distributed his armload of snacks before returning to his spot on the couch, readjusting his arms as Tony sat up to claim a spoon and a carton of rocky road. The anxious claws that had been sinking their way into Steve’s chest while he was out of the room retracted slightly as Tony leaned back against him, and for a few minutes he let himself bury his face in Tony’s hair and breathe. With each inhale, the scent of coconut and jasmine from Tony’s shampoo became stronger. With each exhale, the memory of the Iron Man armor bent over a tangle of explosives – faceplate lifting as Tony shouted at him to run – faded just a little further into the background.
Almost before the doors had closed, Tony had a fist tangled in the front of Steve’s uniform, dragging him forward into a fierce press of lips. Steve wrapped one arm around Tony’s back and wove the other through his hair – scraping at his scalp until he brushed over the place where Tony had almost taken a laser beam to the back of the head, and then he had to clasp the nape of Tony’s neck to stop his fingers from trembling. He was worried about holding Tony too tightly, but Tony pulled him even closer, tangling their legs together and gripping Steve’s shoulders as if he were hanging from a ledge.
“Wait!” he gasped. The pin was heating up against his skin, and he made a small lunge against the restraints to push it into position against the strap. “Please. You have to believe me. If I could tell you, I would.”
“We have to find out what happened in the other attacks. We need to know if there’s any chance Tony – if they’re still alive,” Steve said, unable to dislodge the urgency of that thought even in the face of the hundred questions raised by HYDRA’s resurgence and Coulson’s reappearance.
One week after the infamous Lemon Curd Incident, Tony knocked on the doorframe to the Dean’s office, fresh ammunition in hand.
There, he thought wryly, that sounded a little bit less like, “I didn’t ask to be woken up into this world, but you were the first person in it to make me feel something that wasn’t emptiness, and then you almost died, so I’m afraid that if I stuck around another day I would blurt out something extremely embarassing to the whole team, not to mention to the gorgeous woman you’re dating.”
“He certainly has that effect,” Tony murmured, just loudly enough to make Steve blush even more furiously.
“Trust me, if this were an interrogation, you would have no idea. And it’s sweet of you to think I’d need one to figure this out. No, Steve. This is an intervention. We all want this to work out for you kids – especially because all the mooning around is driving everyone nuts.”
Bruce had carved a meteor shower illuminated with candlelight; Natasha a delicately abstract series of flickering ballerinas; Clint a flock of birds that seemed to wink in and out of flight as the candle guttered; and Thor a somewhat lumpy Jane (again).
“Dr. Grant,” Coulson repeated, his tone as flat and featureless as the cut of his suit. “I hear very good things.”
Truth be told, he had some other preoccupations waiting to take their place. Ever since the night in the workshop, Steve had been finding ways to spend more time with Tony. He didn’t want to push his luck, but Tony had opened the door just a little bit, and Steve was almost incapable of giving up ground once he had gained it. So he had taken to doing his reading in the common areas, where he could often catch Tony coming up for coffee at odd hours. And when he felt particularly brave, he brought his sketchbook down to the workshop and doodled on the couch while Tony went over designs or tested alloys or bantered with JARVIS.
Fury gave them all one final stern look before striding out of the room, May and Skye following in his wake. Skye hesitated slightly at the door, opened her mouth, and then shut it again, apparently changing her mind. She gave them a small wave and disappeared.
"You should all be eating stuffing and pumpkin pie,” Steve grimaced. “I’m sorry you’re stuck here on Thanksgiving.”
“Right away, sir,” JARVIS replied, and the same video started playing on the flat-screen television.
“Agent May is part of a special task force designing the op for this mission,” Fury explained. “This is –”
May Parker always hid a piece of whatever the Sunday dessert was - if it was good - in case Tony stopped by, and he'd heard a rumor today was lemon meringue. The cafeteria was pretty quiet, just a light smattering of students mixing bowls of every kind of cereal from the all-day breakfast counter to get them through a binge study session. There were a few people in line, though, so Tony pulled in at the end and dug his phone out.
“Yeah yeah, go do your grading, Banner,” Tony muttered, clapping a hand on Bruce’s shoulder as he passed back his now-empty plate. “I’m just going to go offer Grant a penny for his most hot-and-judgey thoughts.”
look in return, then turned back to tall, rude, and handsome. "You must be new here because only someone who hasn't actually tried to find a book in this hellhole would be so generous as to call it a 'library.' I'm pretty sure the entire linguistics section is actually cardboard standees of books. It's called 'Smith' for Christ's sake. I don't think there was actually anyone called Smith ever involved. They just wanted it to look like a benefactor had ever had a hand in this cursed knowledge desert so they picked the first name that came to mind. Have you seen a plaque somewhere thanking Atticus or Tessa or Robert Smith for his contribution? I haven't. I'm just saying."
“I guess it makes sense that part didn’t end up in the history books,” Tony mused. His phone was still vibrating in his pocket, and he jabbed the switch to silence it. “But I have to tell you I would have enjoyed my Captain America comics even more growing up if I had known that Steve Rogers swung both ways.”
Steve followed the trail of Tony’s voice back toward consciousness, shaking his head to clear the last layers of haze and heaviness as the taupe walls of the hospital room swam into focus.
“— your last chance to play before we graduate, and the team was just four wins away from clinching the conference title. Not to mention your capstone art project: how the fuck are you supposed to finish the portrait for your portfolio — fuck!”
“Captain.” Steve felt Thor’s strong hand settle on his shoulder. “If Stark is alive, he knows you will come for him. We will not leave our friend behind.”
“So if I go out this door –” Tony continued, walking over to the door on the other side of the room. “I should come in –”
“Right,” he said out loud, turning toward the overhead walkway appraisingly. After a brisk swing of his arms, he took two running steps, leapt, and grabbed the rungs of the second-floor bannister. He flexed once to test whether they would hold his weight, and when they remained steady he curled himself upward, hitching an elbow and then a knee over the edge of the walkway.
“So I ‘got blitzed’ right on the verge of ‘clinching’ the conference championship, huh?” Steve asked. “I could have sworn you said we had just finished the Hot Pockets Bowl.”
Steve complied. And as he watched Tony run through the specs, gulping coffee and nibbling absently at the biscuits, he realized that he knew what Tony was saying even before Tony finally spoke the words: “I’m thankful every time you wake up.”
Of course, the sight of Tony hanging over Steve’s shoulder still attracted the attention of their teammates, who were in the process of cleaning up dinner when Steve toted Tony into the kitchen. It was perhaps because of their varying degrees of fussing (Bruce) and catcalling (Clint) that Tony had decided he needed to regain his dignity with a series of declarations, the first of which he finished right before Steve deposited him gently but firmly into a dining-room chair.
“Tony!” Steve yelled, and Tony let out a small yelp of surprise as Steve tackled him sideways onto the couch. Steve curled his body protectively around Tony’s, and he threw up his shield just in time to shelter them from the disintegrated ornaments, which fell like a shower of harmless glitter into a halo around their heads.
Dr. Grant looked at his own arms as if trying to figure out the connection that his biceps had to do with it. "I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm just trying to be the best teacher I can be."
“Bygones, Cap. The magical scepter of Norse mind tricks was in play. Loki was working us, just like you said. And you may have been right about some other things too: style over substance and all that. My reputation didn’t exactly spring out of my father’s head fully formed.”
Steve’s brow furrowed, something in Tony’s words setting off the same bell that had prompted him to put distance between Tony and Stane. He opened his mouth to press the issue but shut it again when someone from the P.R. team – Sitwell, he thought – poked his head down the hall to give them the universal signal for “what’s taking so long?”
) and contemplated the apparently open doorway, which either had never been or was currently still bricked shut.
It was infuriating, really, because Tony had spent all day reviewing the World’s Most Coma-Inducing Slide Presentations ahead of the Board meeting tomorrow – a meeting for which he’d also promised Pepper that he would stay sober – and so the very least he deserved for so much good behavior was for the supersolider with whom he’d been hopelessly infatuated for the last two years to show a little skin, for Christ’s sake. The only consolation available was that Tony was playing about as well as Steve, having sacrificed only his tie and a pair of cufflinks to win a button-down shirt from Bruce on the previous hand.
“I keep a special eye out for you too,” he continued, his heart fluttering as Tony leaned just slightly into his touch. “And while we’re being honest, I may have been exaggerating just a little bit about how long it took me to get this out of your hair.”
“Well you’ve got me there. You win. I’ll have JARVIS alert the press and print out your award for the fridge: Steve Rogers, still the better hero.”
“I’m awake!” Tony barked, stumbling momentarily before catching himself on the railing. He blinked blearily at Steve. “Oh, you’re not Pepper.” Another blink. “Oh, you’re an
“God, you’re such a pedant these days,” Ty laughed, swaying further into Tony’s space in a way that Tony knew was not remotely accidental. “Is that Steve ‘Stick up his Ass’ Rogers trying his best to rub off on you? You need someone to show you a
Tony was probably telling the truth when he said it was nothing to him. He couldn’t know what it meant to Steve to hear that word offered to him so casually. Tony was generous. He was asking a group of practical strangers to move in with him: maybe it really was easy to give a lot when you had so much to give.
Tony trailed off, looking down at his fingers, which were tapping rapidly against the top of the table. For a wild moment, Steve had to fight the urge to take the nervous hand in his and press it to his lips.
Tony glanced over his shoulder at Steve, who usually greeted references to their childhood of make-believe quests with a small smile and a shake of his head; but Tony’s grin faltered when he saw the strained expression on his attendant’s face. Steve’s jaw was set, his gaze fixed on the ground, and something about the way he had planted his feet – as if he were leaning just slightly toward the wall – immediately set Tony’s nerves on edge.
And, shockingly, Tony meant it. Because after the incident at the restaurant, Steve had started to add silly doodles of the team to the group text. Bruce had dragged Tony up to the kitchen to ask for his help on a research problem while feeding him curry. Thor had begun demonstrating a cluelessness about how to work the television that Tony suspected was a ruse to rope him into watching – and explaining the differential merits of – various series of
The gym was quiet this time of day - only three other guys there. It was precisely why Tony used the YMCA across from campus instead of the student centre gym. There were times when it was fine running into your students, and times when it definitely wasn't. All of Tony's top three were from wretched experience: when sweating profusely, when so drunk he started spouting Wilfred Owen, and the day parents came to empty the dorms and saw their kids' grades for the first time.
After another moment of silence, Steve cleared his throat, searching for some way to assure Tony that he wouldn’t have to deal with any more outbursts of feeling from Steve.
Tony fumed pointlessly all the way home. He took a shower and put on his cozy robe then threw a microwave meal in. He put Dummy in his robe pocket with a handful of grapes to keep him busy and slumped down at his desk, his research spread out in front of him. He dug his photocopies from BCC out of his bag and added them to the haphazard pile. The mushy pasta and vague cream sauce from his packet meal didn't satisfy as he dug his way through it, so he stole one of Dummy's grapes.
“Does this mean you’re coming home?” Steve asked, his voice suddenly unsure as he searched Tony’s face. Tony scooted to one side of the bed to give Steve room to lie down, and Steve curled around him, wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist and burrowing his head against Tony’s chest.
“Steve,” Tony breathed as soon as his partner entered the room. Steve’s face was tight in a way that Tony couldn’t quite sort into his catalogue of Steve expressions, but he was alive and apparently uninjured. Tony felt his thoughts slow to a simmer, like someone had finally turned the burner off under a teakettle.
“Never mind,” Tony said to Bruce, jabbing a thumb at Grant as the meeting finally adjourned just before 6:00. “This is definitely
“Tony,” Steve said sharply, and when he turned back around there was an expression of horror on his face. “What happened last night was not your fault.”
“It’s nothing,” Tony replied, and then grimaced in response to Steve’s raised eyebrow. “Okay, it’s something.”
“I gotta say, Rogers, I would have thought the situation would feel more familiar,” Tony fired back, “because speaking of people who withheld information until they could blindside someone with their guard down –”
Tony’s face hardened again, and he took two steps forward, so close to Steve that he had to tilt his head back to look into Steve’s eyes.
“You know what’s in them,” Tony said, his nerves jittery with the effort of matching his pace to the speed of Arnie’s deliberate crawl.
Steve felt his face flush, and he leaned forward to rest his forehead on Tony’s, grinning helplessly.
“Seems like a bit of a pot, kettle, black situation given, you know –” Tony gestured toward Clint’s bandages. “Not to mention the whole ‘starting fires with your mind’ and ‘appearing noiselessly in locked rooms’ thing.”
He'd lost track of Grant in the parking lot, since their spots were on opposite ends of campus, but he knew where Grant’s office was, and he decided not to ghost on their date. Uh. Arrangement. Agreement. Thing.
“Well if it isn’t America’s favorite PSA,” Tony quipped acidly to cover his reaction. “You here to give me the ‘look what you’re doing to your mother’ speech? I should warn you that mixing alcohol and parental disappointment has not worked out well for me in the past.”
“Because it’s not worth it, Steve!” Tony yelled. He let out an explosive breath and ran his hand over his face and through his hair.
“It was the disc with the Mandarin footage,” Steve answered. “And unfortunately, the fact that it’s now turned the coffee table into a crater isn’t our only problem. Because right before the alert came through, Nat and I noticed something on ‘the Mandarin’s’ table that looked a hell of a lot like the HYDRA insignia.”
Today was not a good day. Today there had been too many civilians and far too many close calls, and the mood in the elevator, which was silent except for the faint sound of Bruce’s fingers worrying at a loose thread on his blanket, was heavy with the latent anxiety they were all too tired to blow off. Even the ding that announced they had arrived at the residential floor sounded hollow as it resounded through the cabin.
He walked out of the room, signaling to Sitwell to follow him. Rumlow moved out of Steve’s line of vision, running his mouth as soon as the door closed.
It wasn’t the first time since moving into the Tower that he’d found Tony passed out in a position that suggested his condition of rest had not been achieved voluntarily. Just last week, Steve had come across Tony in the garage working on repairs to an old Shelby Mustang, and he’d made it halfway through a rehearsed speech asking the pair of legs sticking out from under the car whether they’d like to go to dinner sometime before he realized that Tony had fallen asleep on the dolly, a wrench still tucked in his hand.
And yet, now that Tony thought about it, there had been a story his father had seldom told unless he was past his fourth tumbler of whiskey - and then he had told it every time. It had involved some inscrutable connection between serving as a pilot on a search-and-rescue for POWs and discovering the best fondue in Lucerne. Maybe it wasn’t
James seemed torn, looking back in the office then out into the hallway again. "Okay. I think the best move is to get you out. They'll look for me here, so it's not safe to leave you here. Stay close."
“No,” Ward replied, his face totally neutral now. “But she’s working on it. It was posted to a subreddit speculating about who the Mandarin is and what he’s after. But whoever uploaded it didn’t include any explanation. The post originated from a public library in Trenton, and it was deleted just a few hours later.”
When the water on the other side was almost to the ceiling, he kicked the shield again, and this time the door moved enough that Steve could grab hold of the bottom. He settled his feet against the floor and heaved upward. It was agonizingly slow, and Steve could feel his lungs burning from the exertion, but finally he raised the door to the level of his torso. He kicked the shield through with one foot and then swung himself after it as quickly as he could. He managed to make it almost fully across the threshold before the door’s weight slammed down again, catching him on the left shoulder and forcing out a gasp of pain that wasted more precious air.
When the volume finally came back up, the first thing Tony registered was the sound of someone very quietly swearing at an espresso machine.
“I just want to find my partner and get out of here,” Steve said, still staring dubiously at the apparently solid slope of Natasha’s shoulder.
“I really did have to deal with my dad’s shit,” he said finally. “Turns out he’d been keeping another little hoarder’s stash at the house of an old Army buddy who finally kicked the bucket, and I had to scramble to find a storage unit until I can weed through yet another personal archive of ‘Howard Stark’s unappreciated glory days.’ But the real problem is that I’ve hit a wall with my chapter on Peggy Carter and the SSR. I thought I might be getting somewhere with that German doctor’s notes, but every time I find a document with any combination of ‘Carter,’ ‘Rebirth,’ and ‘Erksine,’ the next page looks like found poetry. I’ve spent weeks just staring into a Black Sea of censor bars.”
Things had been rough since the botched rescue mission. Natasha, Bruce, and Thor hadn’t had much more success in Toronto than the extraction team had had in Jersey. Agent Ward had downloaded some encrypted files while Natasha distracted a room of security guards, but most of the information he’d grabbed had turned out to be garbled nonsense. On the other hand, the away team had at least managed to run their op without racking up any casualties. That must be why they had decided to divide and shock-absorb for those who hadn’t been so lucky. Natasha had been sparring with Steve in the gym to keep him from breaking his fists against another set of punching bags or running the entire coast of New York. Thor seemed to be taking Clint on a tour of all the diviest bars in the metro area, encouraging him to throw himself into darts rather than off roofs. So it had fallen to Bruce to keep Tony company in his workshop. And, presumably, to stop Tony from going back on TV and inviting the Mandarin once again to “come at him.”
A well-lit library, with a second-story walkway, shelves of gold-embossed books, a network of Persian carpets, and chunks of old wood torn out of the floor. The two men paused in confusion. Tony made a noncommittal clicking noise with his tongue, and Steve stepped halfway back into the room they had just left, pivoting between the two sets of sheet-covered armchairs and cobwebbed candelabras.
It was as if someone had brushed Steve’s lips with a live wire, and before he knew it, Steve was wrapping his arms around Tony’s shoulders to draw him closer, groaning when Tony melted forward against his chest. Tony’s lips parted, and Steve pressed deeper, each sweep of his tongue against Tony’s sending a shiver of relief down his spine.
“You've been what I need since the day we met,” Tony said, and as he wove their fingers together, he felt the warmth thread through his chest, tying off edges he hadn’t even realized were frayed. “But you’re going to need a better suit of armor.”
“Think it over, Agent,” Tony said. “SHIELD’s going to be in shambles for a while. And even without the whole ‘oops, some of us are Nazis’ thing, my benefits package is much better than Fury’s.”
“I think the other interested party leaked me the footage on purpose,” Tony admitted, and Natasha quirked an eyebrow. “I dig some digging, and it turns out he’s from Sokovia. His name is Zemo, and he lost some family when my homicidal bot-child dropped a city on them. The report on the incident had been recently published – planted, really. Zemo wanted me to find out. That’s how I realized he was leaving me a trail: he clearly wants a showdown of some kind.”
For the first few seconds after Steve hit the floor, Tony thought it was his own heart that had stopped.
“Yeah, no, fuck that,” Tony muttered, taking another step backward and shooting the handle off the locked door separating him from his partner. Triumphantly, he yanked the door open, only to find himself staring at a solid brick wall.
“We can get out any time,” Steve tried again. “If it takes longer than a few minutes to get us moving, I can always just wrench the doors open.”
“I thought for a moment you were down for the count, Steve,” Tony murmured, and Steve concentrated on the hum of Tony’s pulse next to his, his heart too full in his throat to reply.
“Well, that’s not ominous at all,” Tony remarked as Steve trotted forward to yank at the doorknobs. They were stuck in place – refusing even to rattle in response to Steve’s pulls.
He was just about to let out a sigh of relief, but when he glanced across the room in search of more of their friends, the breath caught in his throat instead: because Steve was glaring in the direction of Ty’s retreat, irritation written on every line of his face.
Steve had been sending them periodic photos from his trip through modern America. They ran the gambit from bemused wonder (a shot of thirty different brands and varieties of toothpaste) to righteous outrage (a close-up on the price of a baseball ticket, submitted without comment), but to Tony’s delight, they were all deeply, constitutionally dorky.
“Good guesses,” Bruce responded with a small smile. “But I was going to ask whether you’d considered inventing time travel.”
Tony tried to use the pause to process as rapidly as possible the revelation that Steve had had a relationship with a man. It wasn’t a surprise, of course, that Steve was attracted to men. Steve hadn’t talked to Tony about his taste in partners, but Tony had spent decades perfecting his sixth sense for when someone was checking him out. He knew the effect of his impeccably tailored pants was not lost on Steve. But he hadn’t known Steve had actually been in love with a man – with Bucky freaking Barnes, of all people.
He could have sworn that he’d heard his partner’s voice a moment earlier, followed by something that sounded horribly like a gunshot. Fighting down the panicked hammering of his heart, Steve trotted in the direction of the sound. He had barely cleared the door to the next room when he stumbled to a stop, feeling like he’d taken a pile driver to the chest. Because Tony was lying slumped on his side, a horrible red stain seeping over his shirt.
"Anyway. The show is next Thursday through Sunday, and everyone volunteered to sell a certain number of tickets, and I was wondering if you wanted to go."
“It’s nothing,” Tony retorted easily. “I’ve got tons of these rattling around for when I need to reengineer something during a boring meeting. Plus I’m pretty sure I can write this off as a donation to an elderly veteran.” He paused to acknowledge Steve’s eye roll. “Just take it, Rogers. Use it to call home once in a while.”
“If I wanted you knocked out, you’d be dreaming of sugar plums right now,” Natasha called out from somewhere behind a makeshift barricade of packages and wrapping-paper rolls. One of the tiny Iron Men buzzed over her head, sending a barrage of dime-sized repulsor blasts at a Rudolph gift bag, and Natasha shot the ornament out of the air with her Widow’s Bites.
“I don’t know,” she admitted, crossing her arms and drumming her fingers thoughtfully against her elbows. “It’s so hard to manage a proper haunting in one night. We used to have
In the next instant he was lunging for his shield, and Natasha was running in his direction. He started toward the kitchen island, knowing she would anticipate his movements, and she leapt into his arms right before he jumped. They twisted together in the air, Steve bringing his shield around to cover her as they landed on the other side of the counter. He barely got the shield into place before the room exploded.
"So she's in the theatre program, and I'm part of the audio-visual club, and so they asked me to do the light design for this semester's showcase performance because the drama department doesn't have a light design course." Peter paused, considering that for a moment. "Or set design. Or, like, most things…"
“Excuse me, sir,” JARVIS announced, “but Ms. Potts has initiated the override sequence, and I will have to put her call through the building P.A. system if you do not pick up your phone.”
after Bahrain. If she’s back in the field now, it’s not for SHIELD, and it’s not for Nick Fury. There’s another angle here, and I don’t like that I can’t see it.”
He rolled up onto the tips of his toes to kiss Steve gently, feeling Steve’s hands brush faintly up his arms. When they pulled apart, Steve let his hands fall back to his sides, and Tony took a step back, watching Steve's face until the searching look in his eyes became too much to bear.
“We need to have a code,” he said finally, dragging his eyes away from Tony’s with a physical effort. Tony blinked, as if in confusion, and the ground settled under Steve’s feet again. “If you need space while I’m on the job,” he continued, “we need to have a code, so you can let me know if there’s trouble. Because you’re not going to convince me to quit – or whatever it was you tried to do tonight. I’m not leaving until this is over.”
Steve shook Ward’s hand, and Thor walked with him toward the elevators, one hand clapped on the agent’s shoulder.
“No,” Steve said firmly, his gaze painfully earnest. “There’s no ‘but’ here. Any trust you put in him that he betrayed — that’s on him. No one does anything to deserve that, and you —” Steve trailed off, uncrossing and recrossing his arms with an energy that seemed suddenly nervous. “You deserve the best.”
“What a fucking mess,” he sighed, staring at the boxes of discarded drawing plans, dogeared books, and semi-functional gadgets littering the concrete floor.
“Fine, okay. I think I’ll just go help him get oriented then,” Tony replied. “Show him the ropes a bit.”
“Tell Pepper I’ll be with her in two shakes of the stick up Agent Rogers’ ass,” Tony called out. Sitwell, who luckily did not appear to be the type to repeat that message verbatim, confined himself to a tap of his watch before he disappeared around the corner again.
“Ahhh yes,” Tony acknowledged, his mind stalling out briefly at the image of the small green branch hanging almost over Steve’s head. “That was a gag gift from Rhodey. He was in town last week. Apparently he thinks I need to get laid to take the edge off – said I need all the help I can get.”
“It’s nothing, my liege,” Steve replied, and there was a breathlessness in his voice that made him appear to shrink, for one sharp moment, into the wiry stable boy Tony had once found curled in the back of the hay loft, hiding an attack of ague that left him shivering with fever. “I must have hurt my shoulder – probably a sprain from carrying the lances yesterday –”
He walked in from the hallway that led to the gym, wiping a towel across his forehead before draping it over his shoulders. Natasha was close behind, dressed for exercise but looking decidedly less winded than Sam. She gave Tony’s shoulder a squeeze and then curled into a nearby chair as Sam perched on the back of Wanda’s couch.
"They’ll have a great time debating if there's a real rule that if the prof is fifteen minutes late they get to leave without consequence - trust me, I know. James." Tony grabbed his forearm and - holy shit, was he hiding cement bricks in his shirtsleeves? - held it for a moment. "Seriously. This is important."
“Steve.” It felt like someone punched the name out of him, and the sound of his own desperation was enough to get Tony moving again, rushing to Steve’s side to start compressions. But just as he got his hands settled on Steve’s chest, he heard footsteps echoing down the hall.
By the time they arrived at the location Maria Hill had given them, two bruises had bloomed on Steve’s temple and jaw, and Tony had to fight the urge to reach toward them as he set Steve down on the walkway above the dam. Instead, he retracted his helmet and stepped out of Steve’s space, waiting.
"Monday! After I'm done learning a valuable life lesson about hangover cures." She disappeared around the corner.
Steve was just winding up for an eye roll when a muffled thumping noise issued from the floorboards to their right. Tony moved toward it, and Steve fell in behind him, one hand hovering near Tony’s arm as he scanned automatically for anything that looked like an explosive. But there was no detectable force causing the wood below them to heave upward. In fact, it looked for all the world like the something underneath was fighting to get out.
Which was perhaps something they had in common, Tony allowed, accepting his coffee in what must be the only campus office currently in use.
There was a pause, during which the only sound was the horrible beep of the heart monitor, broadcasting Steve’s racing pulse across the room.
Tony stacked one coffee cup on the other to push open the door to Smith Library. He tried to wrangle his phone out of his pocket to check the time without knocking his bag off his shoulder as he wiggled through the broken turnstile, but the coffee tower threatened to collapse, so he gave up with a frustrated huff. He wrapped his hand around the seam between the two cups and tipped them both up so he could take a sip off the top one. It was too hot, but the psychosomatic response to the caffeine still felt like a light switch flipping on.
“It’s been suggested,” Steve smiled. “Out of curiosity, how long have you been riding this thing up and down?”
Bruce must have fetched him from the gym, because Steve’s cheeks were pink and his skin was covered in a sheen of sweat. His shirt clung to his chest, and wow that last shot of vodka had been a mistake, because Tony actually gulped at the way Steve’s arm muscles flexed as he gripped the worktable.
“I know you can, Tony,” Steve said firmly, arranging himself on the chair next to the cart. He pulled off one of his gloves and put it between his teeth to stop himself from biting his tongue when the current hit, and then he let Tony position his bare hand carefully in the tub.
“Especially not then,” Tony replied. He pulled Steve toward him and kissed him softly, letting their noses brush together until Steve let out an impatient noise and pressed deeper, pushing their clasped hands above Tony’s head and running his free hand up Tony’s back. Tony found his lips curling into a smile, and he hooked one thumb under Steve’s chin.
“An apt joke, Stark,” she replied with a smile, “because like the fictional spirits of old, I’m here to give you a warning and to save you from a horrible, lonely death.”
At first, Steve had expected to be called in at any moment. The two locations they had infiltrated during their last mission had since been abandoned, but SHIELD had been scrambling for fresh leads, anticipating increased activity as Fury failed to hand over the TAHITI files. Steve asked the team to be ready to assemble as soon as SHIELD found a target, so they spent a lot of time doing light training exercises and sifting through their daily briefings.
“You’re going to need a crash course in how to work an interrogation,” Natasha nodded. “Tony’s a pro at this, and if you can provide enough of a distraction, he’ll get free.”
Smooth, Stark. Incredibly smooth. As if this year hadn’t already been enough of a mess, now he had to deal with a crush on Dr. Workplace Sedition, But Make it Sexy.
“Do you trust her?” Steve asked, and Tony was sure he could hear other questions lurking behind that one. Tony wondered if they included, “just how close were
And speaking of obscure, Tony thought to himself, this blog was pretty far off the “currently trending” path. It had a fairly inauspicious title -
“Is it weird that I’m jealous of someone whose grandkids probably have mortgages right now?” Tony asked, hitting the button for the penthouse suite.
He found Tony standing with both arms braced against his worktable, designs for what looked like the paneling of Steve’s uniform projected in front of him. Steve cleared his throat, and Tony whirled around, the slump of his shoulders morphing into a graceful lounge by the time he was facing Steve.
Tony twirled his cards between his thumb and index finger, doing his best to pass off the sudden firing of his nerves as indecision over his hand. Steve had leaned back in his chair, but his eyes hadn’t left Tony’s, and whatever look Tony had caught a glimpse of earlier was fixed in place now, making Tony feel vaguely like the arc reactor was overheating.
“But you defeated their leader in mighty battle,” Thor said to Steve, his brow furrowed. “The legends say that you foiled their plot for domination.”
“So my enemies are your enemies, but your brainwashed ex-lovers you get to keep to yourself?” he quipped acidly.
The man bristled. "Regardless of what you may think of it, people are trying to study here, and it's rude to be so loud. Surely you can take your conversation outside."
Tony huffed with frustration. He tapped his fingers idly on the keys. No one would know… if he just… peeked. His misspent youth had to come in handy sometimes, right? And unlike hacking his dad's email at thirteen to try to delete the confirmation emails sent by some rather questionable websites he may have tried to pretend to be eighteen to sign up for, this would be a stealth mission. Pop in, find out when Dr. Grant would be too busy to attend Tony's talk, pop out.
“Is that a hint of wistfulness I hear?” Natasha inquired, her eyes searching his face until they drew a flush to Steve’s cheeks. “Not to worry: you’re both so attractive, and you’ll have all of eternity to work that part out.”
“This is how you want to say that for the first time?” he asked teasingly, his hands coming up to brush at Steve’s sides just above the hem of his jeans. “On the couch, surrounded by our catcalling friends and the scorched remains of the homicidal holiday ornaments I created?”
“Why, you got a hot date later?” Tony quipped, his voice flat in a way that made the weight in Steve’s stomach twist.
He knew that Steve felt the nerves too: not only because he was sitting with his arms bunched across his chest like loaded springs, but also because he had turned down an offer to spar with Natasha and elected to work through several punching bags instead – something he only did when he was afraid he didn’t have enough focus to keep from hurting someone.
Here he’d been thinking that Steve Rogers and Project Rebirth might be the key to a new narrative about the SSR, and the entire time, there’d been a whole goddamn secret government agency sitting right under his nose.
“You should call him,” Wanda agreed, handing Steve a small plastic cup of water. “There’s no need for you both to suffer this much.”
“Can’t put anything past you,” Tony confirmed, smiling flatly to unclench his jaw, “but feel free to call me ‘Tony.’ I respond much better to nicknames than I do to public shaming.”
,” Tony retorted. “I said I’d been worried about you, you froze, I offered to blow you, you shot me down, and then nada, zilch, radio silence: I’ll catch you at the
“No, seriously, you nerds. Get out of here,” Tony replied, and they shot out of their desks almost in unison.
“Ah yes,” James replied slowly, his brow furrowing, “sorry...I’m not sure what I was thinking of, exactly. I was a little distracted after the talk. Things have been tense with my, uh, volunteer work.”
“Well then we’ve got to work out some kind of system here,” Tony countered, “because I don’t know if your eagle eyes have picked up on this, but a lot of people get close to me. And letting them get close to me is one of the only things I do for this company that Pepper couldn’t do better.”
“Sleep first,” he agreed, nestling his cheek ever so slightly against the top of Tony’s hair. “And then maybe you can show me that ‘hand of genius’ I’ve heard so much about.”
“It was just sitting on the counter,” Tony admitted, “which means whoever put it here has access to the override codes for the building’s security system.”
“I’m resting right now, Brucie,” Tony grinned, shooting another micro blast from his gauntlet at the sensors. JARVIS added the readings to the graph, and soon Tony would know exactly what frequency of electromagnetic pulse would have shorted out the explosive attached to Harrison’s skull with the least collateral damage.
“See you phrased that as a question, but the way you said it tells me that you already know the answer,” Tony responded with a grin. Steve smiled, reaching out to weave his fingers through the hair at Tony’s temples.
“Interesting,” Tony muttered, training his flashlight over the third, identical sets of sconces. Steve might have chosen a different word to describe the situation, but just at that particular moment, he didn’t feel like reflecting too hard on what it would be.
The eyebrow she quirked in response suggested that she was not impressed by that excuse, but she turned away from them with nothing more than a murmured, “enjoy your ‘points,’ boys.”
Tony scoffed. "Hardly. That paper was a train wreck, and I highly doubt she can bring it up past fender bender by Monday."
Ward snapped the gun toward Steve, and Steve moved. Using the leverage of his one free arm, he rolled to the left and used the momentum to rip the restraints off his right leg and then his chest. He let himself fall off the left side of the chair just as the gun fired and debris exploded from the space where his right shoulder had been. Steve reached up to secure a hand- and foothold on the side of the chair, and then shoved as hard as he could. He felt the remaining restraints snap just as something sharp stung his left calf.
“You didn’t mention it was a Stark missile,” Tony pointed out after a pause. When Steve looked over in surprise, he saw Tony’s lips had twisted into an ironic smile. “The army tried to bury that incident report you wrote, but I found it the day after we hired you. I wasn’t stalking: I promise. I just had to double check that you weren’t out for revenge – which would have been understandable, by the way.”
The team chanted along with the countdown, Clint gathering a handful of tater tots for a ketchup toast with Thor and Natasha dancing her way over to plant kisses on Tony’s cheek and Steve’s forehead before sliding back in next to Bruce.
“I do,” Steve retorted, his voice thick. “I mean, I don’t even know if I can – I don’t know how long I’ll have to live after –”
The two of them were observing their monthly ritual of hitting the local dive bar after a lecture by a visiting speaker. In any previous semester, the talk they’d just attended – an analysis of the figure of extinction in the poetry of Alfred Lord Tennyson – would probably have led to the kind of meandering debate that had first brought Bruce and Tony together over a pitcher of margaritas and a plate of over-salted nachos during their new-faculty orientation. They’d settle into a booth by the door and wander toward a topic about which they both knew
“Got some energy to burn, Cap?” he asked. Then he caught his lower lip lightly between his teeth, and just like that, Steve’s heart was hammering so hard he could feel his pulse in his fingers.
Thor, Clint, Bruce, and Natasha filed out – Thor clapping a heavy hand across Bruce’s shoulders as they passed through the doors – but Steve hesitated, the tight remnants of fear tugging at him as if there were a string tied between Tony’s chest and his.
He got back in and put it in first, tapping the gas to see if he could get any traction. Completely unsurprisingly, the wheels just spun, digging him deeper into the snow.
“Now that’s an experiment we could try if you’re bored,” Tony suggested. Bruce’s frown deepened. “That was a joke, Bruce: to show you how well rested I am. Don’t look so dour. I’m fine, okay? You don’t need to keep mother-Hulking me just because you drew the short straw and got ‘manic Tony’ duty.”
Tony blinked in confusion, his mind struggling to process the sight of Ty’s limbs sprawling across the floor, but soon Steve was facing him again, his forehead creased with concern.
“Kinky,” Tony joked. And then, because he knew Rhodey had been very worried about him ever since his meltdown two weeks ago (when he’d run out of a date with Pepper and called his armor from an alleyway because someone was letting their cell phone ring unanswered, and suddenly he was blasting toward a hole in the sky, air thinning and light fading, and he was going to die up there, and no one would hear him screaming), he dropped the shields for a moment.
That part had been a mistake, Tony was willing to admit. If the reporters hadn’t caught him so soon after the mission – if he’d had time to drown the memory of Steve begging him to hurry with just a little bit more liquor. But the news crews had been camped outside the Tower the morning after, when Tony was still buzzing from pulling an all-nighter to avoid nightmares and childhood heroes. And when the first microphone was shoved in his face, Tony’s mouth had started running immediately.
“We’ve had agents casing all five possible locations,” the Director continued, “and we’ve determined that these two are the most likely for hostage holding.”
The first thing Steve realized as he lurched back toward consciousness was that Tony was no longer next to him. The second was that he was no longer in the library, and wherever he was, it was dark and cold.
“I admit I had anticipated Stark would come alone,” Zemo’s voice had announced, as Steve, Tony, Clint, and Natasha made their way below deck. “The best way to destroy a team is from within. Isn’t that right, Captain Rogers? It starts with something small: a secret, kept from someone who trusted you, causes a rift, and then when the threat comes, you are not where you needed to be. This is what I imagined, anyway. If the mercenaries tracking the Winter Soldier had ended up killing Captain America in Romania, or – what was more likely – if I had taken Iron Man and returned him to you in pieces – either way it would have destroyed whoever survived.”
Steve stood staring at the place where Tony had been, grinding his teeth as he counted slowly to ten in his head. Five weeks on the road, and whatever clear air he had managed to store up could still be punched out of him with one look.
“When I bought that new jacket in Charleston without, and I quote, ‘consulting you,’ you posted a video of someone saying ‘you went over my helmet’ to the group chat. I looked it up.”
Crisco-based dessert, Steve was sure he had gone far enough to reveal the joke; but Bruce and Clint had continued nodding encouragingly and jotting down notes.
Tony cursed, glancing rapidly around the room to consider his options. He couldn’t leave Steve exposed like this, but he had no idea how many assailants were about to come through the door. He leapt up and grabbed the cart Rumlow had used to torture him, pulling it toward them and toppling it over so that it formed a makeshift barrier in front of Steve’s head and torso. Tony adjusted the angle of the cart just slightly so that – after he grabbed Rumlow’s gun and ducked behind a nearby pillar – he could see a distorted reflection of the door in the bottom of the metal basin. By the time he was in position, Tony had formulated three possible responses depending on how outnumbered he was: shooting from cover; distraction plus frontal assault; or conditional surrender. The condition, of course, would be Steve’s life, which Tony guessed – judging by the way Ward had aimed for Steve’s shoulder and leg – HYDRA might still find valuable.
For a few months after the move, Natasha had texted him about missions or about the training sessions with the junior Avengers. But Tony had found reasons to put her off.
Steve responded with a noise that sounded embarrassingly close to a growl, and by the time the doors slid shut behind them, the flicker was already forgotten.
“Shoot, sorry,” Grant muttered, digging his cell phone out of his pocket. “I have to take this. I uh - your talk was really something, Dr. Stark. Thanks for finding those things.”
Tony took the long way around to the locker rooms, checking out the legs attached to the ass as he walked by. Shorts just short enough to be a teasing invitation revealed thighs that could crush a watermelon and calves that could make a drunk man cry. Not that Tony had ever cried over calves while drunk, but he'd never been wasted around these before.
Clint’s head had dropped forward toward his chest as Coulson spoke. Natasha kept her grip on his arm, squeezing hard enough that her knuckles had gone white. Coulson’s posture hadn’t shifted, and he was still regarding them all as calmly as when he had entered, but Steve noticed that his eyes tended to move back toward Clint with some frequency.
“Technically, this is my driveway,” Tony responded, stepping out of the car and following her into the sprawling first-floor common area. “I think the guy who financed the building retains a lifetime right to lurk anywhere on the premises.”
Tony leaned forward on the edge of his bed, wondering vaguely what stage of “romantically fucked” it was when you felt like someone had filled your chest with a flock of electrified hummingbirds.
Tony barely had time to take in that incomprehensible information before an alert pinged on the suit’s display.
The silent auction had been a night full of glad-handing and photo ops for Tony, which meant a night of scrutinizing New York’s wealthiest for Steve. By the time Tony congratulated the last of the auction winners, twisting his head over his shoulder just far enough to mouth “finally” at an angle only Steve would catch, Steve felt sure that he had scanned more Botoxed faces and overpriced cuff links than there were people in Manhattan – let alone people rich enough to afford a $50,000-minimum-bid dinner.
Tony shifted his coffees around so he could take another sip. "I mean, like, missing commas or the bibliography in the wrong format. Maybe a
Steve looked up and caught Tony’s eyes, his heart rate picking up speed as memories of those same eyes flashed through his mind in quick succession: tearing up with laughter over a plate of cornstarched bananas, pinched with fear over a surgical mask, narrowed in concentration over the remote control for an adjustable bed.
Of course, since Clint hadn’t suggested they play strip poker until the team had already made a substantial dent in Bruce’s latest batch of home-brew IPAs, some of them didn’t have many choices left at this point. Bruce had managed to hold onto both socks but was otherwise down to just his boxers, a white tee shirt, and a watch. Natasha had discarded a jacket, a headband, and a boot. And Thor and Clint were both surrounded by piles of clothing, though Tony suspected they were actually stripping at a faster rate than they were losing.
“You fucking idiot,” the same voice had greeted him, and Steve looked up to see Tony sitting by his bed, the lines around his eyes drawn tight over a surgical mask. “You’re supposed to be a tactical genius, and you haven’t learned a single new method for containing explosives since basic training in 1943? I’m going to equip your suit with goddamn ballistic plates.”
“Tony,” Steve said, raising his head and taking Tony’s face in his hands, “I would do it all over again for any time at all – for the worst hour of the worst day we’ve ever had. Please don’t think that I would trade any of it –”
“I don’t know if you know this, but my Draper Prize was actually awarded for achievements in deflection. So don’t think I missed that dodge,” Tony said. “And as much as I enjoy watching a fellow artist at work, you look like you’re about to crack a tooth trying to keep a lid on it. So. You want to talk?”
He turned to return Steve’s glare, but found that Steve’s face was pinched with worry instead, the furrow between his eyebrows pulling at the burnt skin on his forehead. It was so like the expression that Tony had seen on Steve’s face after Steve had carried him to the kitchen – the same expression that had made Tony wonder for the first time whether Steve had more-than-friendly feelings for him. Seeing it now made Tony’s throat feel raw, like he’d been gasping for air for hours. He tried to pass off the scratch of want as mere irritation.
“Told me they wanted me for a whole series of videos,” he was rambling at the unseen recorder. “Said it was going to be a long-term gig and all, which is why I took it on such short notice. I’m pretty busy, you know – I do get work. But they only used the one scene, and now they’ve just left me here to twiddle my thumbs. Which would be fine, but I never actually got paid, did I?” As he spoke, he was clumsily removing what looked like stage make up with a washcloth, gradually revealing –
“Just three, sir,” the crisp voice replied. “And my sensors indicate they are all locked in a standoff with the large stuffed hedgehog on the lower floor.”
“Why else would you be here? You know the stories about this place. Every couple that comes out here ends up shooting each other. Have you started thinking about how you’ll handle it when he tries to draw you into the act?”
“You’ll thank me when you have ice cream,” Steve assured him, but his fingers lingered as they brushed Tony’s hair away from the bandage on his temple, throat tightening with the effort of surrendering contact.
Steve allowed himself a quick clasp of Tony’s arm before he slipped back out of the car. It was for the best, he told himself. Tony hadn’t been sleeping very well, and God knew the man needed a holiday. But when Steve closed the passenger door behind him, he heard an echoing slam from the driver’s side and turned to see Tony walking toward the house.
“What?” Tony asked with exaggerated innocence. “I have models for the whole team. There’s even a little Cap ornament with magnets for the hug and fly.”
They turned to see May standing in the doorway, giving them a look that managed to express both a total lack of interest and the possibility of their imminent demise.
“We’ll talk it over,” Tony said, and he let the jibes and nicknames drop, because the words weren’t meant for Fury. Steve nodded, his jaw loosening slightly.
"Shhh." James reached back and gave Tony's wrist a comforting squeeze. He stepped out into the hallway and made a beeline for the door to the stairwell, but just as they were approaching it, the door banged out, and at least eight men in tac-gear with masks on burst through the door, guns-first.
“Look, I know you’re excited about Avenging, and I’m excited for you,” Rhodey continued. “I just hope you know what you really want from people right now.” He drained the last of his beer. “And for the record, I wasn’t implying that you were
The old wistfulness filled her again as she remembered their faces: all the lovers they'd help escape the poor, cramped forms of devotion that the mortal world would allow. And perhaps Clint could feel the pull of nostalgia too, because he ambled over to wrap his arms around her from behind.
The elevator dinged again as they arrived at the common room floor, and Tony walked off without a backward glance. Steve remained, his eyes tracing the outline of his scuffed shoes against the immaculate marble floor.
“I’ll never get tired of you,” Steve said. “And as someone recently reminded me, I’m a pigheaded son of a bitch. So you know I’ll fight every day to prove I’m right.”
“Yeah?” Steve asked, searching Tony’s face. A small doubt had flickered to life somewhere in his mind, and he tried to summon the will to bring it into focus. But then Tony’s hands were running south down his back, and Tony’s breath was hot and ragged against his neck.
Tony had considered blowing past it or passing it off as a joke, but he knew he couldn’t pull that off. Not with Pepper – not about this.
What Tony hadn’t counted on was the possibility that he wasn’t being held for ransom but used as bait. Of course, he had realized this was something other than a run-of-the-mill abduction when two of his kidnappers turned out to be SHIELD agents who said “Hail HYDRA” to each other without any discernable trace of irony. But then Sitwell had walked into the room, accompanied by three men carrying Steve’s unconscious body, and Tony had lost it.
Which made it all the more surreal when Steve raised his gun, pulled the trigger, and took a chunk of upholstery out of the chair behind Tony’s left hip.
“But I want to see!” Clint whined, and Natasha pinched him on the suprascapular nerve. “Oh fuck, Nat! Fine! Jesus. But this means we’re watching
“Barton,” May called out. Clint ran up to grab the small scanner she had detached from her belt. Hurrying back to Harrison’s side, he moved the device in circles around the agent’s head and neck. Outside, Steve could hear Tony exchanging fire with what now sounded like multiple air crafts, and he had to force himself to focus on what May’s team was saying over the comms.
. And when Clint and Natasha came back from SHIELD headquarters at 2:30 AM to find Tony nursing a glass of scotch on the couch with all the lights on, they had pulled out a six-pack of beers and started casually swapping stories about things that had made them freeze up during missions.
“You don’t think I’m trying?” Tony broke in, a sharp pang of hurt metabolizing rapidly into simmering anger. “This looks like giving up to you? Because I only fight for myself, right? Well fuck you, Cap. You think I don’t care that you had to watch an agent die in your arms because I didn’t get there fast enough?”
Steve stared at him, the events of the past months rearranging themselves in his mind like bones reknitting after a break. Tony pinched the bridge of his nose with a sigh, and Steve could tell he was about to wave the whole thing off again, so he made another leap.
“I need to call some colleagues,” he said. “Do I have your permission to send this to Dr. Banner in our lab?”
“Well, not everyone, obviously,” Tony smiled ruefully. “As you say, my powers of observation are a little selective, and I guess the principle of selection wasn’t that hard to figure out. It’s a small field, and I’m as surprised as you are to find out that you’re at the front of it. God, I’m going to regret admitting that once I’ve gone through a few REM cycles, aren’t I?”
“Nothing serious,” she assured him. “Just got knocked around a little.” She was sitting up now, already surveying the remains of the common room for additional threats. Normally, Steve would try to insist on a medical exam, but until they could figure out who to trust at SHIELD calling in their location could put them in even worse danger.
“Does anyone else need to disguise their concern for each other with mockery, or can we get this briefing over with?” she asked. “I’ve been in this dress for almost twenty-four hours, and if I don’t get something fried to eat soon I’m going to impale the next person I see with these heels.”
“Come on,” Tony begged, counting the beats as he drove his palms rapidly into Steve’s sternum. “Come on, Steve. Don’t you dare do this to me.” He was throwing all his weight into the compressions, but he could already tell it wasn’t going to be enough. Steve’s rib cage was too strong, and Tony couldn’t get enough pressure on his heart. He titled Steve’s head back, pinched his nose, and breathed into his mouth, but Steve remained motionless.
“We need a better plan, I agree,” Tony broke in. “But from what I hear, you’re the just the star-spangled man to see about getting one of those.”
Exhaustion slammed sideways into Tony like a Mack truck, so he saved a screenshot of Dr. Grant's next month so he could book the library and logged out. "We deserve ice cream," he told Dummy, pushing out of his chair. He took Dummy's silence for agreement.
“I’m sorry, did you say that was ‘retaliation’ or ‘deflection’?” Rhodey retorted, and Tony had to concede (privately, of course) that that was probably game point to Rhodey.
The first station on the track was deceptively close – a door that was still within reach if he could only bring himself to make the jump. Just one moment of feeling reckless, and Steve would throw the rogue Avengers’ cover out the window, pick up one of the hundreds of postcards he'd sketched on the back of drug-store receipts and paper coasters (“wish you were here”), and slip it in the mail. Hours later, when Steve cracked the door to the shitty motel room in Gdansk, Tony would be standing by the window, and Steve would reach for him before he remembered why he couldn’t. To his surprise, Tony would reach back: one hand tangling roughly in Steve’s hair and the other gripping the front of his shirt. He would kiss hard enough to bruise, and Steve would take it all, whispering over and over, “whatever you want, Tony. Whatever you want.”
“So what are you doing about it?” Natasha asked, returning to the footage but propping her feet up on Steve’s lap. “What’s your strategy?”
“Clearly,” Bruce murmured, taking a slow sip of his IPA and regarding Tony carefully. “And I’m sure this fixation on an energetic new colleague has nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that you’ve pushed back your research talk three times this month?”
