He placed his hands over the other mans face. His skin was soft, with a slight rough edge to it, probably a result of age, but it gave him more character. He dragged his hands down his jawline and over his neck, and felt more than saw the other man shiver. He could feel his own hair standing on end as he rubbed the lotion over his Adam’s apple and the rest of his neck.
“I had a fully, properly functioning heart. And yeah, I do have pills, but a good doctor. So, he makes sure I need the minimal amount. Honestly, Dr. Erskine changed my life." Steve continued walking while Tony followed.
“Sorry.” Peter said smiling showing teeth that had popcorn stuck. Steve barely contained a laugh and told him it was fine. Yes, he was nearing bankruptcy, no, he couldn’t go to art school and he was working all day, but having Peter and caring for him made it worth it. The kid was the best thing that ever happen to him.
“Oh God, he isn’t supposed to worry about that.” There was silence for a moment filled in by the sounds of the credits to a Star Wars movie playing in the living room.
“There can be impromptu parties you may not be able to handle, he may lose his temper at any moment, ignore you for hours, send you out on pretences, make you wait hours after giving a commitment, there’s very few things he’s punctual about, and he’ll definitely get into your head if you let him.” Rhodey said and Steve contemplated a response.
“JARVIS?” He tried, a bit hesitantly. Although the AI had given him directions, it was obvious his loyalties lay with his creator, and really wasn’t that befitting the egomaniacal image he had read about, he may not help Steve at all.
Rhodey punched him for me.” Steve couldn’t help but chuckle to which Tony threw an affronted look at him.
.” There was a bite in his voice that irritated Steve. He’d been on his feet almost three hours now and he was quite sick of it now.
“But what Rogers? I need to eat? Why are you worried about that? Look where you are and who you’re talking to, no one’s going to cut your pay cause I didn’t eat, just give me a break.”
“Your non-existent love life Rogers? Of course.” Steve sent a glare in her direction and looked around to see if anyone needed help. There was a woman on the treadmill, one using an exercise ball, and the others had different instructors.
“Should I even ask how you know? You’re really missing your calling as a world class international spy you know.”
“You would also be required to try and keep him from… well, doing stuff, you know, stupid, crazy stuff.” Ms. Potts said.
“My outburst?” His response fell on deaf ears though, Stark had already left. Steve wished there was a punching bag somewhere. The gall of the man, which was the reason he was not going to get the last word.
“Yeah - wait what?” Steve said as they both walked to the couch to occupy the space on either side of Peter.
He could feel Tony’s eyes over him the entire time, and when he moved to his left cheek, he looked down. The lighting in the bathroom was amazing, and he noticed for the first time, how
Hi, I'm so, so sorry, but I finals and it took up more time than I thought it would. Please forgive me, I'll try to upload at once a week from this point on.
Friday came far sooner than Steve had anticipated and it seemed he had been quite unprepared for it.
“God, don’t call me that. Reminds me of dad. I don’t wanna remember dad. Call me Tony.” Didn’t want to remember his dad?
“So, it’s the perfect spring day to be out in the afternoon. Besides, I think you’re getting paler by the day.”
“Sorry, I, that’s literally how Bucky and I became friends. Only we met in kindergarten. I was a really small kid and Bucky stood up for me.”
“Oh alright.” Bucky said as he stopped tickling the eight year old boy sitting between him and Sam on the couch.
“You going to go the store again during the week Stevie?” Bucky asked as he walked into the kitchen, which was practically in the living room. “You have to, y’know, you’d become hypoglycaemic during the training sessions otherwise.”
“Good, stay clear of the porn, will you? I have a personal collection and I don’t really want it messed with.”
“Yes.” He didn’t need to see him to know he was lying. He soon got back in his bed. “Alright, where is the field trip your school is taking you to?”
“Follow me.” He could feel his heart drop to his stomach as he walked behind her down a gleaming hallway.
“I guess I am.” For the briefest moment, Steve thought he saw something in Tony’s eyes, unguardedness, maybe but it was gone as some as it had come.
He was pulled out of his seething anger when his phone rang in his back pocket, and a smile was filling his face, seeing it was Sam, which meant only one thing
“Did I do something wrong?” The look of worry in his eyes made Steve want to hit himself. He placed a hand on the boys forehead.
“Yeah, he’s some rich guy from Norway. His wife is a patron of art. So he set up a scholarship and you have to submit a portfolio to win it.”
"StarkPhones. Just like smart phones, only better, because look who's making them. Maybe clean energy, that'll take time though.”
“Secret stuff.” There was a strain in his voice as he moved his arm inch by inch, attempting to bring it up to his knee.
“Then tell him I won’t leave until he comes out, and that I’ll start banging on the door while I stay here. I don’t care exactly how immature it is.”
“Well, you didn’t do a very good job the first time around. I’m just trying not to let that mistake repeat itself.”
“Not enough, if you’re skipping meals to feed the boy.” Steve felt his neck snap as he looked up at Bucky. “Peter told us, he’s worried you aren’t taking care of yourself.”
“No, I’m sorry. It probably didn’t sound very right, did it? I only meant, you’re an engineer and he’s a military man. So how did you to meet? How’d you become friends?”
“Yup, probably that. I’ll be in the lab. Bring me some food, something that doesn’t require a fork.”
“What job opportunity? Are you planning on leaving the air force?” Out of the three of them, Sam was the only one who still held his job in the military.
“It was never about making money Steve! It was always about protecting the country, the soldiers. That’s what dad did, and that’s what I set out to do. But, somewhere along the way, I think it just turned into one big arms race, one that I was winning, may I add. But when I was captured, I realised my weapons in the wrong hands were killing American lives, as well as innocent ones. So, trust me when I say that I’m not making weapons again.”
“I - what?” Steve wished he had a dollar for every time he embarrassed himself, he really would not need this job at all.
“Mr. Stark, please, you have to take your medications with food, Ms. Potts told me as much. If you don’t like this, it’s fine. I can cook something else for you to have.”
“No, she told me she was tired of the way her boss was going through psychologists and care takers, and that Rhodey’s friend Sam from the air force suggested a military veteran. Ergo, Steve Rogers.”
“I know”, Steve picked up the razor blade and asked Tony to move around to have his back to the mirror. It would give Steve better access.
There was silence for a moment, but instead of JARVIS saying anything again, the door opened and Stark was standing in the doorway, with a wench clenched under his arm, rock music was playing inside that made Steve want to cover his ears.
“Oh come on, I’ve only know you a week, and you’re basically an American boy scout, how am I supposed to insult you exactly?”
“Yeah, I was! I was a really small kid. I was only able to do this after I turned fifteen.” Steve clarified, pointing towards himself.
So, he decided that stopping in his tracks with his jaw hanging was an appropriate reaction when he saw the man in the living room when he first came into work on Saturday.
I hope the shaving scene was okay, I'm sorry if I've done anything wrong, but  I've never seen a man shave before so I didn't have much to go on.
Moving with anger, he grabbed bread from the pantry and started slicing it with perhaps a little too much force and set about making a double decked ham, egg and cheese sandwich. He crudely cut it into four pieces, which miraculously didn’t look bad and put them on a small plate, walking towards the workshop the second time that day.
“And that stubbornness is the reason you won’t wear a cast. I mean, come on, it’ll help with the pain Tony.”
“I get it, but just try to show some sympathy, when we found him in that desert, it was terrible Steve, he was dehydrated and wounded, it was not pretty. It would’ve been traumatic to anyone, let alone a civilian.” That Steve could get.
He could feel the Captain Rogers persona slip and he was now back to Steve who used to pick fights in back alleys.
“You know Nat, I think you’ve forgotten that you’re the only one who’s met the guy.” Clint said from behind them where he was doing the ribs.
Stark had been using his weakness, dropping innuendos here and there at times when Steve least expected it and, to his horror, they made him go red in face every time.
“Not an opportunity for me, but for you.” Steve looked up sharply from the dishes he was loading in the dishwasher while Bucky shook his head.
“Somehow, I’ve got a feeling that a lot of people would pay a fortune to hear you talk about those.”
“I don’t think so. But I’m sure that you know better.” Steve said as he and Tony fell into step beside each other. “There’s no point staring at me.” He said, pointedly ignoring the other mans glare and walking ahead.
“I’m a burden to you.” He felt a part of his heart break at the small voice in which Peter was speaking. “Ever since I came, you’ve had difficulty with everything. You don’t even eat. I don’t want you to leave me, uncle Steve.”
“Okay good.” It was hard, but it had to be done. “Peter.” Steve sighed and pulled the lone chair from near the bookshelf. Peter didn’t even have a study table.
“Revamping my company, that kinda stuff. Damn it.” He said as he let his hand fall back to his side.
“I’m parched.” Natasha said, falling into step with him. He didn’t know why it even surprised him at this point, she would never strop trying to meddle into his
“Well, I was thinking you should get out of the house for a little while.” Steve said, trailing after Tony.
The article written in this chapter is taken from the MCU newspaper and has the same title, but the article is written by me. I'm not sure how similar the two are because I only read that article once. Here's a link to it -https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/20856/is-the-age-of-tony-stark-consistent-with-the-appearance-of-his-father-in-the-cap
him to be respectful, but he had expected some decency and human courtesy, but it didn’t seem he could even manage that.
“Uh…not really. I um, I had a surgery when I was about fourteen.” Tony stopped in his tracks and turned to look at Steve.
I feel like this chapter is a bit rusty, but try as I might, I couldn't do much to change the way it is. Please let me know what you think of Steve and Tony's interactions in this. Plus, we meet Bruce Banner and another hero is name dropped.
“Okay, well there are some papers you’ll have to sign, but we’ll leave that to Monday. Is there you’d like to ask?”
It really was the perfect day for a walk in the afternoon, the sun was shining brightly but not scorchingly so, and there was a slight breeze in the air that made walking comfortable.
“I have a home theatre, come on I’m gonna show it you.” Tony said turning around to face Steve. “It’s unlike anything you’ve seen before.” He then turned back to walk to the door.
For someone who needed the job as much as he did, he was definitely stacking the odds up against himself. He’d forgotten his suit that morning in the rush to get Peter to the Leeds, who then took him to school, so he was sitting in the gleaming offices of Stark Industries in a skin tight white t shirt and a pair of tight fitting jeans. Hardly fitting for a job interview, but he didn’t have time to go to Brooklyn to get his suit.
“And the sky is blue. Come on, everyone has negative opinions about me except Rhodey and Pep, probably Happy too, but that’s probably cause I pay him”.
“You can call me Pepper. There’s not much to tell, there’s a file in the living room on the couch, it contains your contract with SI, health insurance papers and some documentation that you need to sign, I’ve marked the places where you have to. Tony needs to take his medicines with his lunch, the medicine box is in the kitchen, JARVIS will tell you where it is, he’ll have to take them at two, so try having lunch before then, feel free to help yourself to anything you like as well. And Happy will drop you off at the station in the evening. He’ll also be there to pick you up tomorrow. Also if you need anything, just call me, JARVIS will program my number into your phone.”
“Yes, I was a part of the rescue team. He, uh, he was there for four months, kidnapped by a terrorist organisation. They tortured him to such an extent, he lost functionality of his right arm. He’s locked in his home since he got back, PTSD, won’t talk to anyone, wants to shut down weapons manufacturing. They need someone to stay with him.”
“Try not to burn the food.” Steve shook his head but smiled nonetheless. “Hey, y’know, if nothing else works out, you can always get a sugar daddy.”
“Good morning Mr. Rogers, Ms. Potts told me to expect you. Sir and Ms. Potts are in the living room, you can get there by walking straight down this hallway and then taking a right.”
“Oh.” Those were good ideas, but Steve was quite sure he would get another sarcastic response if voiced it, and so kept it to himself. The rest of the session, which lasted an hour, passed by in relative silence.
“Yeah, Pete as soon as dinner’s done.” He heard a set of footsteps running across the small space between the kitchen and the living room, till they stopped right next to him.
“Riiight.....” Bucky drew the word out as he always did. “And what exactly you planning to do? Another job?” He already had two jobs, as a gym trainer and in a cafe.
“Okay, so Monday, at 9:00 am, come to this address. Tony was hounded by the media, so he’s no longer living at Stark Towers. You will be expected to stay with him till seven, at which point Happy will be there. I’ll introduce you two. Also, this is what we’re offering you.” She slid a piece of and a letter towards him. The pice of paper had the address of a house upstate, while the letter had the proposed salary. If he hadn’t been used to unforeseen situations his eyes would have bulged out; they were offering him far too much just for accompanying a man. He wasn’t about to kick a gift horse in the mouth though.
“Tony?” The fact that he asked for help surprised Steve. “Of course where is he?” Hopefully, it wasn’t too bad.
“Oh, Peter. We could be homeless and I’d still never leave you, unless it was in your best interest. I can’t promise you that the future’s gonna be better, I can’t promise you I can give you everything you want. But I can promise you that I will do everything within my power to take care of you, to make sure you have th ebest childhood possible, that you have everything you need. You don’t need to worry about me, it’s my job to take care of you, and I promise to keep getting better at my job. You are the most important person in my life Pete, you’re my kid. And I’m never leaving you.”
“I don’t know all the details, but he lives alone. he’s apparently suicidal.When they realised this they decided to hire someone to keep an eye on him. They’ve had therapists at the same job but no one stays for more than a week, he drives them away. Apparently there’s some guy named Jarvis too, but all Steve has to do is talk to the guy a little, make sure he eats, doesn’t mix his medicines with alcohol and all that.”
“I thought you were also furious like me,” Bucky grunted lightly. “He doesn’t deserve to walk away after all this time.”
So, he decided to help Peter on modelling a new design for the sixteen-year-old boy's web shooters. Only he knew about Peter's secret alter ego, which was the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Even his Aunt May, who was Peter's only relative remaining, doesn't know about it. According to him, he didn't want to risk losing another loved one again.
After what seemed to be a long shower, Tony stepped out of the bathroom with a red towel hanging around his waist lines and took a peep at the clock. It was an hour after noon started. Then, he remembered about Steve's call in the morning. He was travelling back to New York, his original hometown. He didn't come back for Tony, but he came back to defeat the new villains.
He closed his office door, pulled down the blinds, and crouched at the back corner of his decent office. Tears started to cascade down his cheeks. Giving up slowly became an option to him.
"It seems that the Captain America is a hero after all even though he had made big mistakes in dealing with the Sokovia Accords' issue," she clarified with pride in her voice. "I don't know about you guys, but Steve Rogers and his friends deserve a second chance. They are human, and so are we. The decisions are on you, Director Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross,”
A minute had passed and the rest of the team had arrived with Bruce rushing into the room. They welcomed their leader back and patted Steve carefully to avoid any sudden pain. Steve beamed widely to see all of them were here for him. It was nice to see the six of them back together after a long time; maybe seven if Bucky decided to stay and do therapy.
He dismissed that thought away. Tony would never give up on him. Both of them vowed to never abandon each other for the rest of their lives at the altar. He loves his man and Tony loves him too. The echo of their wedding reassured him of their solid relationship.
okay?” Steve was about to form the ‘I’ syllable and Tony cut him off. “And don’t give me the ‘I’m fine’ bullshit.”
Rhodes (he made it clear not to call him Rhodey after what he did to his best friend) and Carol hoisted Tony up, proceeding to the medical room and checked up on him. Steve stood there, stunned with everything going on. A month had passed since the Blip. His best friends, especially Bucky and Sam were turned into ashes in front of him, followed by half of the people in Wakanda and apparently, fifty percent of Earth’s population and the universe. Everyone lost their loved ones, including themselves. The day the Avengers lost a battle because they became divided and parted ways. And their co-leaders weren’t together to guide them.
better get going.” Nat corrected, then she placed her hand on his shoulder. “Tony, you don’t have to do this alone, you know. Let us help find Steve because we are his friends, and you are our friend, too. The more assisting hands, the better.”
Tony stared at him for a while, not believing what Steve had said. “I’m gonna pretend I didn’t hear that.”
His time was running up. Alone on the deathbed and staring at his old sketchbook, he dwelled on the thought of enjoying the life Tony used to talk to him on the other side. The life of getting together with a loved one.
He took out a gun beneath his scrubs, aimed at the said doctor’s legs and fired. The bullet managed to graze below his kneecaps. The man stumbled to the floor and turned his head towards Whitehall, his black eyes begging for mercy.
Steve nodded unwillingly. Although he believed he could withstand a hundred more of those jolts, he didn’t want to waste his energy just for resisting. He should save his strength when he could find a chance to escape, even just a tiny one.
"Yes, Pepper?" He took a glance at her assistant who was entering his bedroom with a notepad in her grasp.
With Steve in a loopy condition, random dreams and hallucinations were bound to happen to him as he concluded HYDRA had sedate him in large volumes. Tony settled his forehead on Steve’s forehead, respiring the same air with Steve. Words of fondness and encouragement spouted out of his mouth for his husband to listen. He hoped Steve didn’t have problems like nightmares and self-loathing when under sedation.
Bruce managed to stitch Steve’s incision up in less than ten minutes. Tony carried his body and flew to a S.H.I.E.L.D. medical centre not far away from the ruins of the Triskelion, along with Thor who had created a wind tunnel to travel there faster. He met up with Helen Cho and her colleagues and demanded an immediate check-up on the man. They settled Steve’s body on a gurney and rushed to the ICU, leaving him alone in the foyer, wishing a godspeed recovery for Steve.
The walk back to his temporary room left him crestfallen. He kept his head low to hide his sad face, despite getting a handful of stares from the people of Wakanda. Steve didn’t care, his life came undone after the so-called Civil War. The thought itself made him uncomfortable.
There was a total silence surrounding them. Thor would always tell the team about his adventurous tales back home. Even if the stories may be exaggerated but authentic, they wouldn’t want to face one of those Asgardian stories if they ever came to Earth. Loki was one of its examples, and the God of Mischief alone had messed up half of New York City. Imagine a larger threat than Loki…
“You’re not worried about the bad stench?” The soldier asked, but backed away when the genius hissed at his question and slid through the shaft. Tony didn’t care if he had to create a new gizmo to get rid of the bad smell, Steve’s safety was his top priority. Bucky then entered the bin and followed his best friend’s husband.
When time flies, it's actually been a month since Tony last received the news about Steve. He knew that if Steve was captured by the cops, his boyfriend would be detained and locked in the most heavily guarded cell in the Raft. He understood Steve's condition.
The goon’s face suddenly went frightened as Bucky instantly shot him below his left shoulder and he dropped down to the floor in a heartbeat.
“We’ll meet back at the jet,” he stated hastily, making a beeline for their planned entrance along with Bucky.
But why he didn’t remember feeling trapped in a cold, dark place with his limbs and torso bound by metal straps?
"That’s me,” she introduced herself. "I was the one who became your boyfriend's therapist during these civil times,"
Surprisingly, those were the only shots fired. Both of them looked in the opposite direction from the room and spotted a goon who was wearing a pair of goggles on his head. The guy seemed shell-shocked looking at the dead man, probably indicating that the doctor was their supreme leader.
“Of course that got her to wake up,” Steve commented, getting up and putting his book in the bag he had with Jamie’s stuff in it. “Well, let’s get going then. Sweetness awaits.”
"He's just a troublemaker! Haven't you caused my family enough-" Rachel shouted, and Tony glanced over his shoulder. Steve was trying very hard not to just pick her up and throw her over his shoulder, not with so many cameras watching. Tony didn't care at this point.
“Vee! It worked!” Tony grinned, looking at the eggs. All of the stones were gone, and each egg had changed color; Red, Blue, Yellow, Green, Baby Blue, Black, Purple, and Pink. And they were wobbling back and forth. “Vee!” He picked up Vee under her front legs, holding her up and smiling. “It worked, Vee!”
Loki tilted his head at Tony, then smirked, and Tony felt a little sliver of dread. "Then I will simply have to get to your mind." Tony frowned, and tried to jerk back before the point of the scepter was suddenly at his temple. All he saw was blue and a small voice in his ear before everything faded.
Steve chuckled and nodded. “Yeah, I did do a lot of that. I talked to some people, too, learned some stuff about the Twenty-First century. But, it’s nice to be back home.” Mary raised an eyebrow at him.
"This is important," Tony told Rhdoey, leaning in a little. "Justin Hammer is not allowed to touch this suit. I don't want his squirrelly little fingers anywhere near my baby. This is the first suit that I built after getting out of that gods forsaken cave." Tony spit off the side just thinking about the little weasel. "And, this next condition, is even more important than the first one."
“And my job isn’t the least bit dangerous?” Mary asked with a raised eyebrow. “Loki didn’t find out about Peter because of you Tony, he knew about him before he even made it topside, the day he came to Earth. Our jobs each have their own set of dangers, our own enemies, and we try to protect him from that. Was this something that we planned for in our future? To have a child that would be in danger?”
"But you won't call anyone. I know this, and you know this. Those aren't the only copies I have of those," George said motioning towards the pictures. "One of those finds its way into one of the hands outside, and it doesn't matter what I do, the whole world knows about your son."
Tony groaned, falling onto the couch, pressing his face into one of the pillows. What was wrong with him? Sure, he had known Steve for over a year, technically, and he turned out to be the man that he had idolized as a kid, (and maybe an adult), but that didn't mean that he trusted him. Right?
Steve looked back over at the too-pleased-with-herself Jamie. "Alright, we gotta have a talk about throwing food. We don't do it."
Tony laid in the bed the night that his parents had died in a car accident. Vee trilled softly, moving up to try and snuggle with him. He stared straight at the wall, not pushing her back, but also not bringing her up to his chest like he used too. After that night she spent more time in her pokeball, or left at the apartment while Tony went to work. Soon, they moved to Malibu, after the new house was built. Vee at least had company in the robots Dum-E and U, and eventually Butterfingers, but she knew that Stane was to blame for Tony becoming distant.
"I'm glad to see that you got the tree finished on the night of Christmas Eve, Sir," Jarvis said and Tony was in the process of rolling his eyes. "I was certain that you would still be working on it until Boxing Day."
"I'm not going to sit idly by on some kind of house arrest." She was about as stubborn as Steve. Tony idly thinks that they could have been siblings in another life.
"I'm two!" Peter went to jump off the bed and Tony wrapped his arms around Peter's waist and sat up. He let the toddler down on his feet and watched him scramble out of the bedroom, to no doubt wake up his mom. Now that Peter was gone from the room, Tony took a moment to run his hands through his hair, and let out a yawn, the night of no sleeping catching up to him. He wanted to watch Peter sleep, but he also knew that he would have nightmares, and he couldn't subject the little boy to that.
“I’m not sure,” he said, pushing up his glasses on his nose. “I’ve never actually dealt with cloning, not to this extent, so this is all new to me. “But, it would make sense to see a general downward trend in the aging and growth, such as what seems to be happening with Steve.”
“We made the weapons before the enemies could fire their own.” Tony looked at her, leaning forward a little. “I have so much more to protect this time around, and I can’t lose any of it. Before, I didn’t care, that wasn’t on my list of priorities. But now, those are my only priorities. I need to create something, I’ve been working on an idea. Something to stop the aliens at the door.”
“I’m starting to think that perhaps these aren’t deliberate attacks anymore,” Steve said. Tony saw Rhodey and Falcon walking back over to Steve, looking at the windows as well. “Anyone with half a strategy, even a last minute one, would know to keep assaulting the same spot. This doesn’t feel very organized to me.”
Tony was seething. Who was this man to judge him? Who was he to bring up Peter? "He doesn't even call you by a title, you're not even Uncle. But to him, I'll always be Daddy, and that's more than you'll ever be." Tony needed to push back, he need to tackle this, bring him down, because then Tony wouldn't have the time to agree, to say that Steve was right.
"Wade wants me to ask his mom if they'll move in here, again." Tony rinsed his mouth out, before leaning in to inspect his nose before the temperature of Steve's shower fogged up the mirrors completely. "Can you imagine what kind of chaos that would be?"
"I'm, looking for something." Tony stopped and closed the drawer he was looking through, fingers coming up to tap out a rhythm on his arc reactor. What was he looking for? "It's too hot in here, too hot." He tried to take a deep breath, but it felt like his lungs weren't expanding enough.
"But, what if I really wanted pancakes?" Tony asked the little boy, reaching his arms on either side of Peter to cut the waffles that Bruce had made. Steve went over to Bruce, nodding to him. Bruce motioned to a stack of waffles already made, various toppings sitting in smaller bowls.
"This isn't working," Tony whispered, and Mary listened very closely. "We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof."
"Hope you aren't spoiling him, too much," Rachel said as the car started to move. "He's a sweet and well-behaved boy." Mary's mother never made it a secret that she didn't exactly approve of Tony, specially since she was used to seeing the playboy that Tony used to be before Iron Man.
"Still your son, though," Steve said gently."He still talks about you all the time, says he had fun with you last week, until you guys had to come home." Tony nodded but didn't anything, but Steve didn't feel as much tension rolling off of the man as before.
"You were yawning during your bath, baby boy," she told him as they turned down the hall, Steve following behind.
"I don't think I'm the one you should be telling this, too," Bruce said quietly. "My panic attacks tend to leave me turning green." Mary sighed and rubbed the spot between her nose, nodding. "When they come out, have Steve take him to his room. I need to get a treatment ready to try and stave off a bad case of pneumonia, or worse."
The browser popped up, pulling up an entry in a blog, and the two SHIELD Agents looked at each other. Twitter was brought up, looking at the trending topics, and they knew this was about to get bad, fast.
Tony wrapped his arms Peter, pulling him into a hug, kissing the top of his head. “I think, that you should ask Steve yourself. But, I also think that he’s going to love the idea.” He felt the smile spreading across his face, and a slight tingle of what could have been tears. Tony dropped messy kisses on Peter’s cheeks, pulling a little giggle from him. “I have it on good authority that he feels the same about you.” He could feel Peter’s face grow little warm, but knew that he was probably smiling. “How about you go get changed and take a shower first, yeah? He’s still going to be a bit in the bedroom, and you are a stinky boy!”
"Found Phil for you," he said quietly. "I'm sure he'll be in tomorrow, he's with Peter and Wade right now. Don't tell him I called him Phil, though. It's always Agent, no matter what." Tony took a deep breath. "This isn't how I pictured this going at all, and please don't yell at me when you wake up and see what happened. I promise that I'll have beaten myself about it more than enough already." He turned away, facing the door but staying on the bed. "You know, I remembered you when you came into my office all those years ago. After we slept together, of course." He let out a humorless chuckle. "I remember thinking that the sex had to be good with someone who looked like me, because I was just that good. And I think that's also the reason that we don't work together as a couple, because I would be just too much, and you would never back down, and it would just get too ugly, too fast."
“I’m suspicious of them.” Bucky said, still looking between the two boys, a glance down to Jamie to make sure that she was still behaving.
“It wasn’t really relaxing, or a vacation,” she told him. “He still had to report to SHIELD all the time. Do testing, get a psyche eval, go through training, all the fun stuff.” Tony made a little face, then remembered that Steve had told him about the nightmares and insomnia he had suffered through. Mary was right, this would be the first time he could truly relax and not have to worry about anything other than having fun.
"But there's also the chance that it'll draw the kind of positive reception we're looking for," Steve countered. "It might draw in more help, more volunteers, and supplies."
“Yeah, that’s Daddy. Don’t tell Peter you saw him, though,” he said, walking over to the bed. As he sat down on the edge, Jamie abandoned the crackers and wiggled from Steve’s grip. He set her down on the bed, watching her crawl over to Tony, carefully sitting down by his head. She started to tap Tony’s cheek with her hand before Steve leaned over to stop her. “No, no, Daddy is sleeping.” He kissed her hand a little, pulling her back a couple inches. She blew a bubble with her lips, but didn’t look away from Tony. “I know, I want Daddy to wake up, too.”
When they reached the side entrance to the Community Center, all the cameras setting up around the building, Tony and Steve saw Pepper waiting for them in the doorway. They both walked in, the door closing, and Pepper stood in front of Tony, smoothing down his tie of non-existent wrinkles.
"He'll come out here as soon as he's done," Coulson told her. "Take as much time as you need, the Director will be handling Tony for the next couple of weeks." Mary nodded a little, her arm still around Peter's middle, even as he tried to scooch closer to the TV. "He doesn't know you'll be here, so it should be a nice surprise."
"Ah, yeah," Tony said with a little nod. The hesitation in Peter's voice was what he was afraid to start hearing. He hadn't expected the boy to be jumping in excitement, but this could go downhill pretty fast. "She's Mr Steve's, so she'll be with him, and I'll be there too, to help, raise her. Like I do with your Momma." Steve nudged Tony's side a little, but Tony already knew that his words were floundering. He could talk circles around people at meetings and press conferences, but when it really matter, Tony had a lead tongue that didn't know what the hell to say.
" Mary raised both eyebrows now. Another song started, this one she recognized, and slapped a hand over her mouth before she laughed. This song also skipped to the chorus. "
“Nope,” he pat Steve’s chest a couple of time, then turned to leave the room. Steve rolled his eyes fondly. “You get to unpack everything, and do laundry, now. I’m going to go get the little monster, sticking you with all the chores.”
"Yeah." Tony sat down on the edge of his bed. Now that he was coming down, knew where he was, his face flushed hot. A stranger had just talked him through a panic attack. He let out a little moan and dropped his head to his hand.
As he put the phone down, he saw Natasha, Sam, Hill, and Fury all looking to him. Steve took a deep breath then stood up, arms straight, hands fisted. "Let's make a plan."
“I’m sure a little exercise wouldn’t hurt, Tony,” Rachel piped up, sharing an identical smirk with her daughter.
Mary walked forward and rapped a knuckle against the glass of the door softly, getting Steve's attention. She motioned that they needed to come out now, and he nodded a little. Steve leaned his head down, pressing his nose to Tony's hair, mouth by his ear, speaking to him. It took a little bit but Tony nodded minutely, and Steve was picking him up. Tony carefully arranged himself, pressing against Steve's chest and Mary saw his body shaking; most likely a mix of the cold, shock, and whatever emotions were wrecking their way through his body. Tony didn't tolerate many emotions well, treating them as a weakness. She was glad that he hadn't passed that particular ideology onto Peter, encouraging the boy to cry is he sad, or to talk to someone if he was feeling upset.
"Better be something damn important," Tony replied, quiet enough that Peter didn't hear him. "My son is upset, and Mary is-
Tony rubbed his face with his free hand. "Did you tell her that we would have picked her up?" His voice was still laced with sleep, but anymore sleep and he would have started to have a nightmare, and he couldn't do that with Peter in his arms.
"Cap," Tony breathed. He hadn't meant to say any of that stuff to him, he hadn't meant it. "I didn't-"
Steve and Mary looked at each other, her clearly waiting for an answer. Steve licked his lips a little, really thinking about it. She had a point, Steve and Tony weren't going to be having any heart to hearts about Howard, and it was obvious that there were things that happened in Tony's life that Steve didn't know about. Again, not for a lack of trying on his part.
right now. I'd fight you, Steve," he said with a wobble in his voice, pin pricks behind his eyes as tears threatened to form. "If you tried to deny me the drink, I would physical fight you over it, and I wouldn't stop."
Steve reached over and pushed the bag back, grabbing two of them and holding them above Peter's head. The little boy tilted his head back and opened his mouth. Steve dropped them in on his tongue, making sure they didn't slide back in his throat. "Miss Meg is coming up with the twins, and my friend Bucky is coming with her."
"I'm lost, pretty freaking scared, and I just wanna get my kids." Meg's quiet voice said, reminding Tony that she was still there.
“Because your beard lets all the kids know that you aren’t actually Prince Philip,” Tony said with a smile.
Tony wiggled in his seat a little, the high praise making him uncomfortable. “Yeah, well, you know,” he shrugged casually, playing it off. “It’s just my way of telling you that I need help with the Tower, and you’ll still be helping and all that. I’m working on some redesigns for the Tower, and I think you’re just the man to help me with it. Plus you know, you’re helping.”
Turning around, Steve went down the hall to try and find Tony. He just had to follow his voice. "-slap him with a gag order, a restraining order for sure, I don't care." Tony would definitely need a break after this. "Anything to get him off TV." There was a pause, as Pepper was probably speaking. "I don't care what they know about my sexuality, that's never been a secret to any of the press. But this is not the time to be reporting on this kind of bullshit." Steve found Tony pacing back and forth in the main entrance.
"I'm feeling better," she nodded. "I'm glad to see you up and moving though. I know I wasn't the only one shot."
Steve walked over quietly, and slid down on the floor, wedging himself between Tony and the couch. He reached down and lifted Wade’s legs so that he was now sleeping on both Steve and Tony, and shook his head at the weirdness of the sleeping position. His arm went out to wrap around Tony’s waist and he gently dropped a kiss on the back of Tony’s neck. The sleeping man hummed a little and turned his minutely.
“Did you steal that pokeball?” Howard accused his son, turning his attention back to the little boy. “You know you aren’t supposed to go into the lab unless I’m here. And you’re forbidden from looking through classified items.”
They all knew that this was part of the job, that at any moment something could happen, and this was why Fury was Director. He would do whatever it took to keep the danger from reaching topside, to keep the world safe. He knew that, she knew that. She also knew that she had to get out of these as well, to warn people if he couldn't stop it. To get back to Peter, Phil, and Tony. Hopefully by now Phil would have gotten Peter to Tony, and he'd be gearing up Steve.
“Because you would have accepted it so much easier if I told you, ‘Hey, Howard’s Golden Boy is back, I’m his Handler, and oh yeah, our son adores him.’” Tony scrunched up his nose a little. “Yeah, that’s what I thought. Peter’s told me about the Captain America collection that you showed him.”
It was something that Tony had seen when he had jumped out of the plane in the Iron Man armor, as he was flying over the Expo. Even with all the people there, but the lights, the lights made it all make sense. He could barely make it back to the Manor fast enough.
"Yup!" He smiled. "He said I had to ask you first." Steve couldn't get a clear image of this man in his mind. He wasn't around that often, but he never went over Mary's head as a parent.
"No, sorry, got a little off topic." Steve rubbed the back of his neck with his hand, other hand still in his pocket. "I just wanted to say, that if you need to talk-"
Tony scratched the back of his head, and both women turned to look at him. "He's not mad at me.... Or rather, he is, but I wasn't the target." Mary's eyes widened a little, and the card game was forgotten. "Colonel Wilson hired someone to try and take out Julie, and possibly Wade. He thinks that Julie's taking away his parental rights so I can move in on his territory. He's lost his mind."
Steve looked into Tony’s eyes, hands warm around his smaller ones, and Tony knew he’d see the wetness building up. “He put my son in danger,” Tony whispered, his expression crumpling into pain, to hurt. "If it hadn't been dormant-" Tony's clenched his jaw, pain shooting down. Steve pulled Tony into his chest, wrapping his arms around him tightly.
The man on the bench jumped a little when Steve called his name, walking over to him. "Oh, hey," he said, sitting up a little bit straighter, fidgeting, and looking around. Steve walked over, sitting down on the bench on the opposite side. Tony looked like a skittish cat getting ready to run away.
"Is Daddy coming here now?" Peter asked quietly, looking back up at Mary. Tony was gone from the screen. Mary pulled him back against her chest and nodded.
"Daddy said one day, he would take me flying," Peter said with a grin. Steve and Coulson both looked at him. "Mama said that I had to be much, much, much older before that happened."
"Where'd you get that arm? Hmm?" Tony spoke, knowing that the others would hear him now. "Please tell me you didn't get it from HammerTech."
“Yeah, you can be an asshole, but so can I.” Steve said, cutting him off. “We’re both stubborn, and I’m sure that we haven’t even encountered the worst of it from each other. You can be blunt, because you’re done with bullshit- I know, language,- and you loathe manipulative games because that’s what you’ve had to grow up with, to live with, but you also know that that’s how the world of business that you live in has to be played. Doesn’t mean you like it.” Tony lifted his head a little to raise an eyebrow at him. “Everyone is selfish in their own way, but as a whole you’re generally a selfless person. You’ve just become so good at hiding all of that, of playing the role that everyone sees, that you don’t want to pull attention to the big things that you do.”
"Cause I'm sweet!" Tony laughed and hugged him close to his chest. Peter had a devious little grin on his face.
Tony jumped when he heard Mary's voice coming from the ceiling. He was looking through his dresser, but he wasn't sure for what. "Yeah, it's me. Jarvis called me." Jarvis, he could trust Jarvis for everything. Which Jarvis had called her though. "You're AI, Tony." He must have said that out loud. "What are you doing right now?"
"Is Mr Steve gonna move here, too?" Peter asked. Steve opened his other eye, and Tony glanced over at him. They locked eyes for just a second.
Tony sucked in a breath, trying to breath after it felt like he had deposited most of his internal organs into to the toilet, again. "J," Tony wheezed out, pulling himself over to the sink to grab the washcloth that was there. "More labs." He grabbed the washcloth, putting it over his head, and let out a little breath as the coolness hit the fever he had started to run. Tony was deftly trying to ignore the possible red he saw in the water, and was more focused on why he felt like absolute shit when he had done nothing but eat an actual meal, and go to bed earlier than two in the morning.
Tony looked down at the scan and wobbled his head a little. It could have been worse, and he could see the wound. He could pull out the bullet, then bandage it, and if Bruce got back in time, get him to treat it properly. If not, tomorrow he'd call for a house visit from his doctor. Glancing behind he saw that Steve had pulled down the top of his suit, the undershirt seeing better days, but Peter was helping clean up some of the cuts on Steve's arm. He was preoccupied enough to miss Tony reaching for some forceps. It wasn't going to be pleasant, but this was something that Tony could deal with, bullets were something that Tony knew.
"Steve's gonna pretty upset if you keep appearing to everyone but him," Tony said easily, keeping his eyes on Bucky's. "Specially since he's a new Daddy. Named his kid after you and everything." Bucky seemed to move, fingers flexing a little. Discomfort? "Can't imagine Cap's best friend trying to avoid him."
"She's all for it!" Tony motioned with his hands. "It's not like I'll keep repeating the process, just one time, while pregnant."
"Still pretty early, just after 7," Steve told him. "Peter's still making breakfast with Bruce." Tony nodded a little, rubbing his face with his hands again. "I thought I would come in and see if you were awake, they were just putting the batter in the pan." Tony hummed and nodded. "Also, thought maybe you could use this."
"I don't even think you have peanut butter in this house," Steve told him. "Or any kind of nut, actually."
Except, he didn’t recognize any of the constellations. He turned his head and realized that the stars were all around him, not just above him. Tony twisted his body in a circle, but it didn’t feel the same as if he were in the water. No, he was back in space. His feet touched ground and he suddenly fell to his knees from the surprise of something solid beneath him.
Steve was quiet as he listened, afraid that if he said anything it would spook Tony, that he would realize where he was and stop talking. "Howard had put all of his eggs in Bruce's basket, with the research, to recreate the serum. He had told Bruce that he would give him the 'Vita Rays' needed to complete the process if Bruce could remake Erskine's formula." Tony let out a strained laugh. "His message wasn't meant to reach me when he died, it was meant to reach me after Howard used the damn serum on me." Tony saw Steve's jaw drop, "I'm a little conflicted on if it was Hero worship, or if he really did love me, enough to turn me into the next you."
“Shut up, Barton,” Steve hissed, frowning as he watched Tony. Hazel eyes moved, too quickly to be normal, looking at Clint as he got closer to Tony.
Tony slowly looked up and he watched as Steve very slowly, can carefully, slid off of the bed, onto the floor next to him. The bed. He was back in the bedroom. “Tony, you had a nightmare,” Steve kept speaking to him, his tone soft and soothing, calm and quiet. “I don’t like the way you’re breathing, can I take your hand? I want to put it on my chest, so you can try and match your breathing to mine.” That was his Steve, trying to help him, no one else trying to be him. He managed to give one nod and a larger hand, (but familiar), took his and gently placed it on Steve’s chest. After a few seconds, Tony tilted forward and put his forehead on Steve’s chest as well. Steve sussed softly in his ear, other hand rubbing his back in circles. “You’re okay, I’ve got you.”
"Unfortunately, we still have a couple hours until end of shift," Coulson took a seat and put the manila folder he had been holding onto on her desk. She took it, flipping it, and opened it, looking at the paper on top. "I can pick up Peter for you from school."
His hands stopped, a small gasp coming from his lips when Steve's fingers traced the skin around the arc reactor. The crisscrossing of scars around the modification that had once been too sensitive, always covered, then dulled by the palladium poisoning. It seemed the new element had brought feeling back once against to the area, and Tony was pressing his head back into the mattress as Steve explored the skin there, careful to not touch the reactor itself. Bright flashes erupted as the sensation raced through Tony's nerve endings.
“You usually couldn’t care less what they say,” Mary told him. “Anyway, they’re only going to do it because of what happened with SHIELD, so even more reason to ignore them.” Tony shrugged a little.
"I'm not sleepy, Mama," Peter claimed, wiggling around in her arms until she was forced to put him down, still holding onto his hand.
"Tony," Steve frowned but Tony was waving it off. "I kind of do know him," Steve confessed, and it was now or never. "It's Bucky, the Winter Soldier is Bucky Barnes." Tony stared at him. He made very deliberate movements then, getting a mug, and pouring his coffee into it. "Tony?"
Tony took a breath, flexing his hands on the steering wheel of the car. “I don’t know if I can do this.”
Steve put Tony on his feet, and kept his hands on Tony when the smaller man stumbled, his knees buckling. "Barton, where's the jet?"
"Some pictures have been circulating, and a couple of pictures of your shield were caught," Mary explained. Steve frowned and walked over to Coulson and his tablet. "Ever since the Battle of New York, and really, that's what it's be termed as? People have been dying to figure out who the 'new Captain America' is."
"You have the information now, you should tell them what you know." Steve and Tony looked over at Meg. "I know I'm a poster child of not telling right away, but my secret wasn't actively trying to kill anyone..... At the time." Bucky snorted again, now looking through information on Wade's father. "Mary deserves to know, just as much as Julie does."
Any other time, Steve was one of the quietest people that Tony knew. But his ears picked up everything right now. He felt Steve kneel down on the ground next to him, but Steve hadn’t touched him. Tony pulled himself into as small a ball as he could, trying to hide inside of the beanbag.
"I asked Jarvis at the door to let us surprise you." Mary smirked a little. "Peter kept asking when we would be coming over here, and if you had someone coming over for Christmas, like Grandma and Grandpa."
“I bet if he shows any interest in the new movie coming out soon, he’ll want to go to Scotland,” Bruce said to Sam. Tony just smiled. “Tony, we have enough projects together, not including all the solo ones you have, that you don’t need to add another to the list.”
"Of course," Steve nodded. "It'd be our pleasure in fact. I'm sure the boys have been missing each other, they haven't talked for, what? Three, four days?" Steve said, looking at Tony who was smirking.
The HUD flickered to life and Tony saw the footage in the corner, a flight plan to Baltimore next to it. "Tony?" She whispered. "You're still there, right?" He was able to match up the banging on the video feed to the banging over the phone. There were two females standing outside of the bathroom door of the store she was in, and Jarvis was able to identify one weapon.
Steve had picked up in one of the many ebooks loaded on his phone, (and tablet), still on his mission to catch up with pop culture. By his count, Tony would be almost done with his first sessions, and since Tony hadn’t stormed out, he figured that it was going pretty well so far. Until Tony’s phone started to ring. Steve lifted it up, seeing Pepper’s picture on the phone, and frowned a little.
Steve had been watching the magic users all tense along with Tony’s body. Pietro looked troubled as he watched his sister, then Tony let out a strangled cry of pain, his back arching from the bed. His face wreaked of pain, of being in agony, and even Loki was jerking slightly. The dark haired man had closed his eyes, leaning in, the green glow around his hands brightening slightly. That’s when Tony let out a scream, making Jamie whimper and press her face into Steve’s chest.
He pulled the boots off, and plopped down on his back on the couch, closing his eyes for a few minutes. One eye opened when he felt a tug on his shirt, and looked at Peter standing in front of him. “Hey, buddy. What’s up?” Tony opened both eyes and pushed himself up a little bit. When Peter shuffled his foot on the ground, he knew something was up. Peter had picked up some of his nervous habits.
"People did have sex back in the forties," Steve quipped. "They just didn't talk about it as openly as they do in this time period."
"You know, I'm not totally convinced that the show is fictional." Steve raised an eyebrow as he grabbed two sets of silverware and they both headed back out to the bar, Tony leading the way. More often than not, if they were up on Tony's floor, they would eat at the bar. Tony would wrap his ankle around Steve's foot, and pull their stools close together. He didn't like eating with a plate in his hand, preferring a hard surface.
“That’s because Peter follows what Wade does, and Wade is on a mint chocolate chip kick right now,” Tony grumped a little. “All I have to do is get Wade to start eating the superior Butter Pecan, and all of my troubles will be solved.”
He ran over to Steve's room, knocking in rapid succession before he just pushed the door open a second later. Steve was lying in the bed, but he looked, wrong. His body was too straight, too stiff, and as Tony moved closer he saw that his chest was moving too quickly with shallow breaths.
“Phil is getting my parents,” Mary started as she worked on mixing a new batter. “Meg’s got the twins, and Bucky,” Bucky shot her a look, “and Julie is on her way up. Bruce was up all night, so he said he’ll join us for lunch, and Barton and Romanoff will be back in time for the party.”
"They dated for a bit, and she told me that he was in the military on active duty." Steve was still trying to put together all the pieces of this as well, but he figured he won't get that until Bucky decided to talk to him. "Still iffy on the exacts, but he actually worked for Hydra, and was one of the Winter Soldier's Handler's. Bucky sought her out last week."
“This is so cool,” Peter said. “It’s different than Disney World.” Steve smiled at him, watching as the staff wheeled their luggage in. He had the shield settled in an art portfolio case, while Tony had brought one briefcase Iron Man suit, with another on the jet that he could activate with his watch, just in case. They were under no delusions that just because they were on a vacation meant that they were safe.
"He's done that to me a couple of times," Steve told him as he pulled off his shoes and socks next. Tony watched Steve in the mirror, smirking a little. His next move was usually pretty humorous to watch. Steve slid open the shower door, frosted glass today because Jarvis liked Steve more than Tony apparently, then swiftly pulled his shorts and underwear off and hopped in the shower at the same time. One day Tony would get Jarvis to quit frosting the glass doors.
"It would seem that your Captain is having an interesting reaction to the cold." Tony jumped at the sudden voice that came from the back corner of the room. His hand shot out as if his gauntlet were on his hand, and froze when he saw Loki's green eyes staring at him. Green eyes that used to be blue a week ago.
Steve put a few bottles in the diaper bag in the dining room and glanced over to see Peter talking to Jamie. He raised an eyebrow, but didn’t interrupt. Jamie looked restless though, and he wasn’t sure what she was itching to do.
"And you weren't around when he eventually married, and had a son," Mary countered. "That Howard was older, and had seen more, then when you knew him." Mary stepped closer to Steve, and it was clear now why she was trusted to be Steve's Handler. It didn't matter that she was several inches shorter than Steve, she held herself better than several Generals that Steve had known in the Army. "If you read the files, then you know that Tony was also only Fourteen years old when he lost his parents, so I'm not sure what exactly you and Tony would be reminiscing about. Tony was born thirty years after you went down in the ice. Had knowing who Tony was had become necessary information for you to know, then I would have told you." Mary met Steve's narrowed gaze with her own.
"It's okay, I'll always be here to remind you, Daddy." Peter hummed, taking his fork to eat some of the pieces of his waffle. "But, we can have pancakes tomorrow," Peter said after he swallowed his bite. Bruce and Steve glanced over at the boy. Tony didn't say anything, he looked like he hadn't even heard him.
"Is he disappointed?" Tony asked as he grabbed his plate and a fork. Steve tilted his head a little in question. "I was supposed to give him and Wade a fun weekend." Tony closed his eyes and took a couple of slow and deep breaths. Sentences with more than four words sometimes left him feeling out of breath.
"Oh, I've heard," Loki drawled. "The mindless beast, make play he's still a man." Tony's fist clenched, still riding the anger train. "How desperate are you, that you call upon such lost creatures to defend you?" What Tony would give to be in that room with Loki right now.
"Tony," Steve insisted, pulling back to look at him properly. "Does this have anything to do with that research Bruce is distracted with?"
"When those animals were unleashed, they were actually out collecting DNA samples," Bruce said as he picked up the conversation. "Everyone who had gotten attacked, or scratched in some way, it was collected by AIM." Tony watched Steve start to put something together. "You, Clint, and Natasha were involved in that fight."
“Bucky came up to watch her, actually,” Steve admitted. “He needed to make sure that she was alright after all the excitement.” Steve kept an eye on him for a few second longer than usual. “Do you remember what happened?”
“Is this a connection with the same entity that you had dealt with?” Strange asked Loki, receiving a nod in answer. “Then perhaps we may have more of a situation on hand than I thought.” He looked back at Tony now. “I would ask for you to take a seat so that we can continue. You may be having more than just nightmares, and it would be within everyone’s best interest to deal with this quickly.”
The quinjet rocked a little with the sudden appearance of the lightning storm. A lightning storm that seemed a little too unnatural. Steve looked over at Loki and saw that he actually looked unnerved. "What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?" He shouldn't be mocking the prisoners.... This wasn't a normal prisoner.
"He's still just young man!" Tony said, and he found himself surging to his feet suddenly. He started to pace in front of the couch. "What kind of life has he lived?? Only knowing sickness and war?! That's not how anyone should live." Tony shook his head, running his hands through his hair. "He deserves to go out there and be like everyone else, discover the world, date someone normal." Tony dropped back down onto the couch, his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands.
"Jarvis, classify new arrival as Young Lady Jamie," Tony said, shooting Steve a small smile. "Full name to go on record, later this week."
Tony hummed and he and Steve started walking again, towards the dining room. "I don't know, I saw this really big bunny just now, hopping down the hall, not a boy."
Hovering over the roof of his home, close to the roof access, he stayed. "Kill power," he commanded to Jarvis. What he was not expecting was to fall through the roof, through the baby grand piano, through the roof, and land right on top of one of his collector cars. Dummy released the fire extinguisher, and Tony let his head fall back.
"It was the right move at the time," Bucky told him, and Tony gaped a bit. "They wanted to make more Winter Soldier's, they still do."
"Is this the first time you've lost a soldier?" Steve was not expecting the almost violent reaction from Tony at his words. Tony whipped around, his voice quivering with anger.
"Thanks, J, whatever would I do with out you?" Tony smiled a little. "Jarvis is going to be your greatest asset, Petey, mark my words. Anyway, yeah, so when I was younger I didn't exactly make the best of choices, and I just want you to avoid making those same mistakes. I made my choices because of how I grew up, and I've tried to make it so that you didn't go through that, so this could be a warning track for absolutely nothing. I wanted to rebel, so I did a lot of, er, questionable things. Drinking, a few drugs, and just don't, don't even try that stuff, it is not worth it, trust me. And yeah, I slept around a lot, but I like to think that I wasn't an asshole about it. I don't remember a lot of it.
Tony heard Bruce sigh. Heard him sigh about four times in fact. It took Bruce Banner exactly Three minutes and Twenty-Three seconds to make a decision. "Alright. I'll come as soon as I can."
"His arm was run over in a work accident," she said. "Mr Allen is one of the nicest people I've ever met. His food is the best."
Walking out into the dining room, he put the bowl down in front of Peter, who grinned widely, and accepted the spoon form Steve. "Thank you!" He said without prompting, and Steve smiled at that.
"This is not a piece of equipment. I'm in it. It's a suit," he blurted out quickly. "It's me!" Stunned silence is what he would have wanted earlier. Then the plane started to roll, and he was quickly losing his grip. One more high speed roll and they shook him loose. His sensors inside the suit spun, and he grunted when he suddenly hit something.
“If you’re going to make that distinction, then I probably haven’t slept in nearly five weeks,” Tony muttered.
"If you put on your bracelet, I can wake you before a nightmare sets in." Tony had created a bracelet tied to Jarvis, one that could sense when his body was entering different states of sleep, and tracked his vitals. In extreme situations, the bracelet could emit a small shock to the wrist, enough to break deep sleep. It allowed Tony to get some sleep, but try to avoid most of the nightmares he still had.
She trilled again in approval at the nickname. “Vee! Vee!” Tony giggled a little, wiping any remaining tears from his eyes, and started to pet her with both hands.
"I didn't say that it was a good solution." Tony rolled his eyes and took a drink of his coffee. "He and Meg have been talking." Steve jumped back when Tony spit out his coffee, wide eyed. "Would have been my reaction, too."
"Why don't you come help us unpack, and we'll get your room ready for tonight," Mary told the little boy. "Not safe with all that broken glass up on Daddy's floor." Peter hummed and nodded, hugging Mary around the neck. Coulson fell into step next to Mary and they retreated for the elevator.
"He doesn't like her because he thinks that we're going to start ignoring him," Tony gave a parsed down version of their talk. "Whatever you do, do not stop the Art lessons unless it's serious. Like Avengers, or broken bones. He already thinks you're going to stop those."
"Stark!" Something blew past Steve at the same time and he ran over, looking down, before Iron Man shot back up past him, firing shots at the invading aliens. Steve let out a bark of laughter. "That little shit."
"She remains stable," Jarvis said, if not sounding a little sad. "I have contacted medical professionals that you trust, Sir, and they are on their way. I have a twenty-four hour surveillance on her room, and her vitals sir." Another rectangle appeared, showing Mary's vitals. Tony glanced over to the bedroom door that Mary was behind, and almost jumped when he felt a hand on his shoulder. Steve was still standing there looking at him.
"Fantastic, so you don't actually work with Mary?" Tony looked back at him, not taking off the sunglasses though. "Do you actually work, if you're here? And you're able to watch Peter with such short notice? Thanks for picking him up from school, though. When I can't do it I'm usually stuck in a board meeting. Did Mary tell you what I do?" Steve was barely able to finish nodding before Tony was continuing. "I'm trying to get a big project into the works, and fast. I want it done this year, and I've got a lot of work to do on it still. Work actually needs to start as soon as the snow is gone, not that snow stays long on the streets of New York."
Tony turned on the woman, and Steve blinked. He'd seen this level of anger back on the Hellicarrier. Tony needed a break, desperately. Steve could see the cracks in Tony's armor. "First, I am trying to take all the time I can, and if I could I would never let go of my son. If you hadn't noticed, though, this city was invaded by Aliens yesterday, and I was unlucky enough to be a part of that, and that meant Peter had to be with me. So if I could shield him from everything, I would." Tony's jaw was clenched, and Steve could see him trying to keep himself from advancing on the woman.
"Look, there's cake, and Peter wants to share." Mary made a motion to Peter reaching for the little cake.
The directions took him out of the main city, and to a closed housed community. Parking his bike at the corner, Steve slid his shield on his back and eyed the gate. Wilson probably had the whole community wired with cameras, and they were probably all on the look out. The guard house at the gate had one person in it, but he looked like he had spent some time in the military.
Little Tony took a breath before he pressed the button, the red light glowing briefly before arcing out. he held his breath, closing his eyes for a second before a soft cooing sound was heard. Eyes popping open he found himself looking at an Eevee, sitting in the grass. She looked around, obviously searching for her owner, then saw Tony holding onto the Pokeball. Her back end went up, front end pressing down, and she started to growl. Tony’s eyes widened and he dropped the pokeball before pulling his hands up to cover his face.
Tony fidgeted a little, but couldn’t bring himself to look away from her. “I passed out on the workshop couch last week sometime,” he admitted quietly.
"Wade can tell what people are thinking sometimes," Peter told him. He was sounding calmed down a lot from the nightmare now.
"You're gonna ignore me, cause she can't do anything," Peter huffed out, and Tony could see a little scowl forming on Peter's face. Tony ran his hands through Peter's hair. "Mr Steve won't be able to give me art lessons anymore because of her."
Steve took a couple steps closer to Bucky, not wanting to scare him as he saw him get lost in his thoughts. "I'm here, Bucky. No matter what, I got you. I'll help however you need it, whenever you need it, and even if you think you don't need it, or are too afraid to ask. I'm there."
“I’ll let Jarvis doing the aiming,” he bit back. The faceplate slid over his head. “Go.” Tony turned towards where Steve was fighting, letting Jarvis take a lot of the controls. “Run scan, J,” he said quietly as the suit landed on two of the AIM agents. Steve glanced over at him, and Tony motioned back towards the car Natasha was running back too. He nodded before he threw the shield again, ricocheting it off of two pillars in the parking garage.
The day after getting back from a surprisingly enjoyable vacation, he and Bruce had jumped into the test results of Jamie’s aging, and the Serum that Tony had made during his stay with Hydra. They needed to create the item that would ‘activate’ the serum, if only so they could understand if they could make something to counter the effects of the serum. Tony wasn’t convinced that there would be anything, else Bruce would have found it to try and reverse the effects of his own Gamma accident, but Bruce was convinced that any research was good research, and Tony never disagreed with that. It would also help put Tony’s mind at ease if they had something that might stop something from happen if Steve or Jamie ever came into contact with the second-rate serum.
Rhodey hurried back into the room, uncapping something. "Peter," Tony got the little boys attention back from Rhodey. "You're gonna feel a little poke, but you're going to feel better, alright?" Peter tried to nod as he wheezed in a breath. Tony held onto his hands, rubbing his knuckles. "You're doing just great, Daddy's so proud of you." The pen was pressed to Peter's leg, and the little boy winced at the feeling of the needle.
"I'm fine," Tony bit out. He needed to get readings from Jarvis on Mary, then needed to see if he could bug Fury again about Coulson, all the while keeping an eye on Peter. No doubt they would have to start coordinating about cleanup of the city as well. The Tower needed to be worked on again thanks to-
"When we spoke, you said you had people." Bruce held up the picture a little. "You mean, your son, you wanted help, so you can be around for your son."
"I was wrong, this is one of those bad comedies." Tony rubbed his forehead a little. "Well, I've assigned Todd, after the weekend, to be Julie and Wade's personal guard for a while. Wilson is in DC right now, but we're keeping an eye on him."
"Why so quickly?" Steve asked as he opened the dresser and pulled out his last pair of jeans that were clean. He really needed the clothes. He was probably going to have settle for the one red shirt he had left as well. Steve had planned on going back yesterday to grab some clothes, but then, well, Tony had happened.
"Come on in, Tony." Mary opened the door, leaving it open for him. He could smell some food in the oven. Closing the door he dropped the glasses and hat on the table, and saw Peter jump up from his seat at the table.
"Your birthday is coming up," Peter said, pulling him back from his thoughts. "Are we going to have a party?"
Tony pushed the door closed with his foot, plopped down on the bed and held his arms out. "I'll take her, check her diaper, wait for Mary with hopefully some blankets, while you get all freshened up."
Steve watched Tony for a second, and decided not to comment on 'stuff'. "Alright," he nodded, then put his silverware down on an empty plate. "Do you have Peter tonight?" Tony shook his head, cradling the coffee mug in his hands. "Great. Why don't you come on down to my floor tonight for dinner then?"
“Mmmm,” Tony wrapped his arm around Steve’s neck, pulling him closer. “For us. You’re a lot more relaxed yourself.” He moved his fingers through the short hairs at the back of Steve’s neck.
"-but he should be finding someone who's stable. And possibly female. Not that I'm judging, because, hello, if there was another species out there that actually looked hot, I'm pretty sure I'd be there."
"As soon as I find out what the plan is, I'll let you know, Tony." Rhodey looked over at the silver suit. "I know that this is taking a lot for you to do."
"So, do I have to act as your PA for now?" Mary asked, unaware that Tony was narrowing his eyes at the older scientist as Banner smirked. "Not that Jarvis doesn't already share your calendar with me."
Steve eyed Tony the next morning, seeing his clothes laid out on the bed again when he got out of the bathroom. Tony was grinning, Peter in front of him rocking back and forth on his feet. “You love us, you can’t deny this,” Tony started and Steve narrowed his eyes a little at him, but Tony only grinned wider.
"Sir, I can confirm that Captain Rogers’ phone did make the calls," Jarvis informed his creator. "I am unable to track his phone." Tony's body went cold.
"Steve, don't be silly, I found a big bunny," Tony said, shaking his head. "I do have to show this to Peter though."
“Papa!” She whined out. “’addy!” Steve couldn’t take it and he took big steps into the hallway, moving with a purpose to his daughter. “Papa!” Her arms went out when she saw him, and he obediently scooped her up, bringing her up to his chest.
"Please tell me you’re going to appeal to my humanity," Loki said, like nothing was wrong. Tony pretended to pour a drink, holding up a glass towards Loki, ready to chuck it at his head. He needed to be smooth for two more seconds. "To bargain for the return of your child."
“Mr Steve! You’re back!” Steve grinned at the voice of Peter, calling out as he and Tony emerged from a hallway, the boy on his Daddy’s back, arms wrapped around Tony’s neck. Steve noted that Tony looked a little lighter, a smile on his face, and looked like he may have gotten some sleep recently.
“Alright,” Tony chuckled a little. “You can both have a corner piece of cake, and an extra scoop of ice cream, if you help your moms pass out the cake and ice cream to the everyone else, okay?” The boys started to whisper to each other, in their made up language that Tony was still trying to decipher, before looking back at him.
Peter jumped slid from Mary's lap and ran over to the seat, a booster seat on it, and Tony lifted him up onto it. With the hat and sunglasses on, at first glance everyone would see a father and son having fun, wearing matching outfits. Mary couldn't help but smile when she watched her son, and Tony, thinking about how the older man had changed from the first time they met. Coulson put an arm on the back of Mary's chair, prompting a slightly bigger smile. The move hadn't been so bad, so far.
"That's different," Tony tried to argue. "I'm working on important stuff, lots of stuff, stuff." Steve raised an eyebrow at him. "Work stuff. Of course." Uh huh. "I've got your harness." Tony said and turned around, heading back for the table he had been working at, Steve following behind him. "It works on a magnet system, which should make things easier than trying to hook it."
“Knowing them, they’ll probably be gone for a few hours,” Tony smiled softly. “School isn’t out for nearly an hour, and they’ll probably end up taking them for ice cream, or some such nonsense.”
"That is the point," Tony said, looking up at him. "That's Loki's point. Barton would have told him everything, about Mary and Coulson, about Peter. He hit us all right where we live. Why?"
"We have a lot of information about the 1940's," Coulson said, referring to history and technology. "We can recreate practically anything with the tech that we have now."
"Why do you think I asked you to add thermal heat to my winter clothes?" Steve asked, happily keeping his arms around Tony. "Come on, let's go inside. I'm sure Meg's got some coffee and hot cocoa ready."
“Get out of our room, Rogers.” Tony pointed at the door, and Steve left, his laughter echoing in the hallway.
"We're still dating, let's not jump any steps," Tony told the boy with a smile. Peter hopped over, then pulled himself up to sit between Tony and Steve, in both of their laps. The two men had to move their arms to rearrange, but they didn't mind.
"Jarvis says that Daddy can't bake," Peter said like it didn't mean a thing. Tony willed his cheeks not to turn red.
Tony looked up to see Coulson stepping in to take his bride back from Steve as the song came to an end. Had Steve added that just now? Was the alert late, or had he simply missed it? Was it a question, or just a coincidence? Was Steve- Oh shit, he was coming to the table!
This chapter took a little longer, because as of late I've been going through my own anxiety attacks, so I had to write parts of this chapter in a way that didn't remind me of my own, so sorry for the wait, and sorry if any of it was a bit unrealistic.
"No, Peter, wait," Mary called from the background. "Don't hang-" The line went dead as Peter hung up the phone, and Jarvis started playing his music again. Peter had just called him Daddy.
His bike was still in the same spot, thankfully untouched, and he ran over to it. He slid the shield on the front as he slid on the seat, pushing back a little so he could rearrange Wade to sit in front of him. He wasn’t going to take the chance of Wade behind him, so much more so when a couple more bullets hit the street behind him. Steve started his bike, looking behind him, and saw the guard was running out with his own weapon.
As he spit out the last of the toothpaste he heard his AI pipe up. "I would recommend a blood test, Sir." Tony frowned a little at the suggestion. "With my limited scanning, I can find no foreign substances that would cause you to be sick."
“You look good in them, really good.” Tony smirked at Steve’s admission as he sat down next to him. “Unfairly good.” Tony snorted softly. “I never knew that you had prescriptions, but why make the change now?”
"I find it hard to believe that nothing is happening for you, today," Tony said to him as Peter ran off. Oh, Tony may not be his biggest fan, but he could see that The Neighbor was incredibly handsome. Those blue eyes captured you first, he could see them even through his dark sunglasses, and his hair was immaculate. Tony longed to rough it up with- Tony slapped his consciousness. Now was not the time to think about this handsome man, that he would rather have in his bed than his former dating possibility.
“Glad to see the office didn’t kill your sense of dramatics,” Steve said as he pressed another kiss to Tony’s neck. “How long have you guys been asleep?”
"You remember when Daddy said it would be a good idea to buy a few boxes of cupcake mix?" Peter nodded. "This is why. Everything's alright, but we should probably, most definitely, open some windows."
"You must have been deep inside your mind at that point." He let Steve get a little closer to his face, most likely checking his pupils. "You were trying to get away from me, before I could pull you out of that little pit. Looked like you could have hurt yourself even more."
Jarvis had informed Steve that a lot of files on the Winter Soldier had been released in the Hydra internet dump, still no pictures, and that he could access them whenever he was ready. Steve would wait for Bucky to tell him about it, but it didn't mean that he wouldn't look for his best friend.
Steve moved back and stopped moving his arms. Tony had grabbed his wrist, moving to break it before his eyes locked in with Steve’s. They widened and he suddenly stepped away from Steve. Steve held his hands up, showing him that he wasn’t hurt.
“Hurting it so much that you sneak into my playlist,” Steve replied, eyes closing and practically purring at Tony’s touch. “And it’s not exactly my gift, I just get pointed in the right direction and I go with it. Meg is constantly adding songs as well. She lived the Nineties, and early Two-Thousands, so she’s the resident expert.” Tony groaned and buried his face in Steve’s neck. Steve hummed and turned his head a little to kiss the side of Tony’s head. “I love you.” He felt Tony mouth the words back against his neck and he smiled.
"Tony?" Pepper had moved a little closer, pulling his attention. He looked up at her, then folded the paper in half, shaking his head. She nodded once to him then turned to Mary. "I'm sorry, but there's nothing that we can do for you. I can have someone from Security-"
"You were a man on a mission," Steve told him. "When you found out that he was still alive, you were ready to set fire to something. And then, when we needed more time, you did something incredibly stupid, but you bought time for Clint and Natasha." Steve's thumb brushed gently by Tony's mouth. The marks would heal without issues. "That was all you, and you did that without any prompting, because you care. None of us would be here if it wasn't for you, and that means you matter."
Parking, the four split into the two groups, and Tony walked next to Steve as they headed for the level where they were supposed to meet with Thor. In the elevator Tony glanced at Steve, and the taller man moved a little closer to Tony, letting their shoulders almost touch. Tony resolutely did not think about how the small motion calmed him down a little.
Tony carried Peter to the Kitchen, sitting back down at the stool, but the snacks, looking over at Rhodey and his progress. Peter leaned over in Tony's arms, using his finger to wipe some peanut butter off the chopping board and putting it right into his mouth.
“Heart condition, seriously people!” Tony put a hand on his chest. “I’m going to put a proximity bell on you.”
"Shall I put you through to the safe room, Sir?" Jarvis asked sadly. Tony blinked his eyes, feeling the wetness there, and just nodded.
In the end it was decided that Bruce would stay with the Fitzpatrick's to watch Peter and Wade, and Bruce would be able to keep Peter from seeing Loki again when they got back, Tony didn't want another reason for his son to have a nightmare. Clint and Natasha had come in a borrowed vehicle, and they said it would be better for them, plus Tony and Steve, to drive that back to SHIELD, then take a Quinjet back to the mansion. There was enough space to land on the helicopter landing on top of the mansion, even if it would draw a little bit of attention, and the Quinjet would be the easiest way to transport Coulson.
"You two don't live together?" Steve wondered what kind of man this father was. "You aren't married?"
“That is so unfair,” Tony muttered as Peter hugged her again, giving her a sloppy kiss before grabbing his book bag.
"You're up front about it, too," Steve said with a chuckle. Tony leaned up a little, trying to catch Steve's lips, but he pulled back just a fraction. "I'll reward you for watching two episodes of this with me."
"What's so important that you wanted to talk in person?" Mary put a glass of water in front of Tony, with her own glass in front of her.
The weather for the wedding was perfect, something that Tony and Mary had fretted about. Just a light enough breeze, not too much to drown out the voices at the ceremony. The sun was out, but too bright, fluffy white clouds lazily gliding through the sky to cover the harsh glare, but keep the day looking bright. There was no wedding party, and forty-two guests were in attendance, not including Peter and Wade who stood up front with Mary and Phil, (respectfully), each holding onto a ring. Pepper had accepted Tony's handkerchief to keep dabbing at her eyes, in an attempt to keep her makeup from running. She said that nearly everyone cried at weddings. Tony wiggled his nose when the newly-wed couple shared their kiss, swearing that he was just chasing away a sneeze. That awful burning feeling, of a sneeze, of course.
Steve's mouth opened a little. "You made a pen that can make any color it sees?" He looked up at Tony to see him nodding with a smile. "This is, this is amazing, Tony. It's seriously genius." Tony preened a little bit, and Steve smiled. "Thank you, this is really great."
Captain America wanted a fight? Oh, Tony would give him a fight. Tony would take Howard's perfect ideal and he would wipe the floor with him. Until fire exploded in the room. Tony gasped, breathing in the hot air and coughing, almost choking as he was slammed into the edge of the doorway, Steve landed on his leg.
"Who's Manuel? No, those will need to go last, please be careful with that, that was my mother in laws." Mary asked, while talking to the movers.
"Tony!" He often heard that tone when he bought Peter something that she didn't actually need, and she knew that it was overpriced. "I only mentioned once that I was thinking I might move when my lease was up, not that I was going to move."
Armor. It was time to revisit the armor that had saved his life. He had other lives to save, to protect.
"Thank you, Jarvis." Steve looked down the hall where Tony had disappeared, then went to check on Peter, just peeking his head in the doorway, then looked in on Mary, before finally retreating to the room Tony had given him.
Wade started to giggle, which actually sounded a little bit like a cackle, and Bucky frowned. “You just played me, didn’t you?”
Peter's hand went out to Tony's arc reactor, and laid his head against Tony's shoulder. "Phil is sad," Peter said quietly. Tony's son was too observant. "He loves Mama, too."
"Even villains take the days off on Sundays, so I'm thinking the 25th," Coulson continued, highlighting the day.
Tony had never been more thankful for an uncomfortable position when trying to sleep. He had nodded off a few times, but never fell deep enough to sleep that he could dream. He tried pushing every aside, just enjoying that Steve was actually there, he was warm, and alive. He'd be going home, and he see his son, his Peter. He could try and pretend that none of it happened, at least for a little bit. That's all he wanted. To keep pretending that he was going to be okay, that the only thing he needed to worry about was that he was turning thirty-five in a couple weeks.
"Mary told me about that," Steve said, pinching his side a little. "That doesn't count, because Peter wasn't even one yet."
"That is something that people usually do ask me," Tony agreed. "This is weird, the tables have turned." Steve hoped that maybe Tony would distract himself with- "Seriously, what happened?" Damn.
Tony shook his head a little, moving his tongue. Oh, he felt it working. The new element clicked into place, and then hit his veins, and it started racing through his body. He gasped again, rolling his shoulders. He coughed a little and chuckled. "Tastes like metal shavings." He moved his tongue, the taste feeling like they were coating his mouth. "And coconut." That one wasn't so bad. Tony took a deep breath and vaguely saw Bruce covering his eyes from the glow of the reactor as it got brighter.
“I’ll be sure to say that when I reach Forty,” Tony smirked. “And again at Fifty, when he’s still a young, blon-“
“Now you’re learning, Cap,” Tony said with a grin. “Maybe we can get Aunt Pepper and Happy to watch the kids for a couple of hours before we leave.” He smirked when Steve wrapped his arms around his waist. “I thought I was supposed to be the bad influence here.” Steve hummed and he could feel it vibrate in Steve’s chest. “You should probably put a shirt on, much to my extreme disappointment.”
“Yes, we saw with your foray to what Midgardians call a ‘shrink’,” Loki said with a smirk in his voice.
“I think I like the protection of my Captain America suit,” Steve told him, but let his eyes linger on the bit of chest that Tony was showing off with the off-white shirt. He could see a bit of the arc reactor as well, but it was a little muffled by the shirt. “But you can wear that around the Tower more often if you want.” Tony raised an eyebrow at him, smirking a bit.
I have pictures up on my Pinterest of the exact outfit that Steve is wearing. Mmmm, it would be a perfect ass indeed.
"Daddy!" Peter shouted, wrapping his arms around Tony's uninjured side. Tony tightly wrapped his arm around Peter, holding him close, and trying to turn him away from the assailant. Tony swallowed and looked back over at the mysterious man again. "Please don't hurt my Daddy."
“Okay! I think I have everything!” Peter declared as he ran back in, four books wrapped up in his arms. Mary took them to pack them into the bag before zipping it up. Tony bounced up from the bed to his feet and Peter grinned. “I’m ready, Daddy!”
"Too late," Tony whispered, watching the missile hit, the sphere of orange fire engulf the ship, destroying it. It was enough, it was enough to see, to know he had done it. His eyes closed.
“No one knows who you are,” Steve stage whispered to him, bumping his arm with his own. “It’s not like we’ve exactly advertised your identity, and you don’t fight with us, so you’re pretty much the best kept secret that we have going for us.” Steve reached up and sunk his fingers against Bucky’s scalp, ruffling his hair a little, before the man pushed the hand away. “Since you’ve started using, whatever Meg buys you for your hair, you look less hobo now.”
"Once," Steve nodded. "Obviously before the big change, with Bucky. Not what I came here to talk about though." Mary let out an amused hum. "I need to know how to woo Tony."
“Oh! I think I left my books upstairs!” Peter took off running, heading for Tony’s floor before either parent could say anything.
The moment Tony felt the tip of the scepter touch his head, he lost himself. He didn't feel himself falling to the floor, didn't hear any of Peter's shouts, all he knew was that something was inside of his mind and he didn't like it. Tony couldn't describe what it felt like, it was nothing and everything at once. A force caressing his mind, riffling through his memories, holding him, pushing him down, and ripping into him all at the same time.
"Good thing he doesn't entirely grasp the concept of being obscenely rich, yet," Tony said with a little, self-deprecating, smirk.
“A pleasure to have you back, Captain Rogers,” Jarvis’ voice filtered through the speakers. The elevator started to move on its own.
It took a couple extra minutes to get Jamie to sleep, but she was quiet, with a hand curled around the corner of a blanket, and peacefully asleep. Steve went out to the living room, dropped himself onto the couch, and Jarvis connected the call. "Steve?"
He made his way back out to the living room, this time Dr Strange was standing up, his red cloak always in place. The second person was still sitting on the couch, but his head was slightly cocked, making it clear that it was Loki still around. Tony wiggled his nose a little and walked past the man who more than likely saved him, but he could find himself to care at the moment.
Steve hummed in thought. “I bet you could beat them all, though. And, you could make more than pasta.” Tony squawked and turned big eyes to Steve. “You can’t live on pasta and hot chocolate forever.”
"Daddy!" Peter launched himself at Tony, wrapping his arms around Tony's neck. Tony gasped a little, surprised, then realized what was happening and he wrapped his arms around Peter immediately, closing his eyes tightly. "Daddy, I was so scared, and then you were gone, and I couldn't find you, then Mama was there..." Peter started to let out little sniffles, bumbling through his words and thoughts.
Tony swore he could only see colors in that moment. Every touch, every feeling, every shift of their bodies, it sent a ripple of color, lighting up everything inside of Tony. His brain was a wonderful work of color, some spots glowing brighter from Steve's mouth, others flaring every few second from Steve's hands and fingers. Tony's own hands were a constant glow, sending pulses of bright light to travel his limbs, and he swore he could map out the internal workings of a human body from this alone.
“Like the owl from the movie, right?” Tony grinned. “All dressed up like her Daddy!” Steve groaned, but was smiling.
“Please tell me that you have locations on at least one of them,” Steve asked, keeping eyes on Tony.
'Sir, Captain Rogers would like a moment of your time when you are able.' Jarvis's text appeared across the top of the tablet. He didn't want to interrupt the family time unless it was important. 'He says that it is at your earliest convenience, and to not rush.' Tony rolled his eyes a little.
"Tony? Can you hear me?" Steve moved his hand to his chest, his breathing still strong, and felt and heard the moan of pain coming from the genius.
"This is real nice, kiddo," Tony said as he looked at it. Peter put it down on the coffee table. "What's this boys name?"
"It's too late!" The Doctor was looking like Tony after a five day workshop binge. That was never good. "She wants to show us something! A new universe."
The woman stepped up to Loki, pressing two fingers to his forehead, and his own memories started to play around them like a hologram. Tony felt dread snake through him when he realized that they others must have seen everything, just like they were seeing Loki's memories. Tony dug his nails into his leg a little when he saw the familiar hand of an alien approach Loki, then he forced himself to look away.
"Yeah, well, technically he hit me." Tony took in a breath, letting Jarvis take control of the directions for a few seconds. "Now, are you going to come by and see what I'm working on? Peter misses you, too." Guilt trip, that's what good parents did, right?
"Yeah," she nodded. "Dr Banner and Jarvis explained my injuries to me, so I'm not too surprised I'm still in pain."
“I don’t like the sound of that, Steve,” Tony said quietly. The cart returned and the doors opened, the two men shuffling on board. “Those don’t look like thru and thru’s.”
"It is not my fault that you have a great many things that you wish not to share with others," Loki lazily threw back at him. "Sit down before you fall and break something." Tony offered a half-hearted glared and Steve gently pulled him over to one of the cars, opening the door for him to sit down in. Tony leaned back, spreading out in the backseat of the car.
“I like Happy’s name,” Peter mumbled, finger tracing the arc reactor. “He says he drives you around. Like when we was in the limo.”
"Some scientist got a little over-zealous in the lab," Tony told him. He leaned over, looking over the couch, frowning when he thought he saw something small sail past the window. "We've got it under control though."
"Pepper must be on some kind of medication after so many years with you." She grinned at Tony's indignant 'Hey!'.
"This doesn't change that he's still dangerous," Steve said calmly. That was probably only making Tony's mood worse, in retrospect. "But, we had already agreed that he wasn't working with these scientists, and now we know for sure that they're doing human experiments." He leaned in on the table a little. "You said it yourself, we can't afford to let them continue these experiments, not when there's a possibility that innocents have been caught in the crossfire."
Everything had happened just days before Tony's birthday? Steve looked at Bruce with big eyes. They couldn't let Tony's birthday pass like this, could they? Bruce had got to get more juice, and fill Tony's cup with coffee, leaving Steve with his lingering thoughts.
"Agent?" Now Tony was raising his eyebrow. Coulson was with Mary today, and he had sent Natalie to go pick up Bruce. No one knew that Bruce was even coming except for him and Jarvis.
“Is there anyone else that might know? Maybe something about magic?” Steve asked, shifting his legs so he could pull Tony into his lap. “Maybe the Fantastic Four might know something about the portions of space that you saw?”
Tony tapped a stylus against his arc reactor as he stared at the screens that Jarvis had pulled up for him. Had Tony just been looking for information on any of the three adults in this search, he would have come up with a frustrating lack of information. But he had Meg’s information to go off of, and the information that they were all linked to Hydra. He used the stuff that Natasha had dumped onto the net from SHIELD, and it he was able to connect a few more dots.
He was convinced that Meg was being secretly trained by her Aunt, and that she wasn’t actually active Hydra. Tony had read through the files, the few that he had been able to dig out, and they had lots of suspected interest, but the death of Jacob and Etta had thrown their plans into chaos. Since she was a low level interest at the time, they hadn’t really ironed out anything concrete. It wasn’t until Hilda had started sending in reports, showing how naturally her niece had taken to her many ‘self-defense’ classes so easily, that some of the higher ups had started taking notice. Then they sent in Emil to seal the deal, bring her into Hydra, and take her under his wing to train.
So sorry for the long waiting my darlings! I was sick with what felt like the plague/flu, (there were jokes with a friend about becoming a zombie, and whichever one of us recovered had to kill the other for the sake of humanity), there were hospital visits, and nursing home visits, and generally lots of sick people involvedl (sitting in a hospital room wearing one of those masks for hours on end gets annoying. How do people wear those out in public all the time without overheating their faces??) Also, I'm dealing with snow, because my state SUCKS with weather (seriously, my state never knows what season it is), so I'm currently dealing with sinuses, but I can work with that at least.
It was cold, and dark. He was wet, and he couldn't see. There was someone there with him, he could feel them behind him. Tony turned on his foot, but there was nothing there.
"Steve," Bruce said, trying to slightly diffuse the situation. "Tell me none of this smells funky to you?"
There were other cars around that had been, cut??, by whatever weapon this man had. It was a good thing his legs didn't want to work with him just yet, cause Tony needed to keep close to the ground. He skirted around the damaged car parts, watching the man walk past him, eyes only on the F1 racing car that he had just been in. Tony grabbed part of a red car, watched the man slice through his own car with his whip, pushed down the fear, and swung at the mans head.
“Dinner is usually a nice way to break good news,” Meg murmured, drawing her legs up underneath herself on the couch.
Steve put two glasses of juice down in front of Father and Son, and couldn't help but smile. It was just he and Bruce in the kitchen at the moment, and Steve knew that Tony felt comfortable enough to let go in front of them, to not have to put on a mask. He was slightly amazed at the quick change though, the man that was lost in his mind in the bedroom, and the father out here that acted like nothing was more important than making Peter smile. It was now Steve's mission to make sure that Tony's birthday stayed this way.
“Howard obviously altered the formula,” Bruce cut off Tony’s tirade. “I think, that he altered it to be ingested orally, through food and drink, since the only other alternative would be direct injection into the body.” He started to clean his glasses out of nervousness. “Nothing’s really changed, it’s lying dormant, in fact, but it’s still there. Has been for years.”
Steve blinked a few more times, watching Tony. The man looked tired, but he could tell that he still knew what he was talking about. Steve gave a few test punches, feeling the new fabric against his taped knuckles. "I talked to Dr Banner today."
"And don't you forget it." Tony wore his shit-eating grin. "Stop taking in strays, though. You get me attached, and then I'm forced to see the good in people, and it just gets annoying."
"Gross, Banner, how could you even suggest that?" Tony stood back up, leaning against a table. "No, that is not a girlfriend, a wife, fiance, any of that stuff. She's a friend."
"It's almost nine in the morning, Tony," she told him. The engineer blinked a little, unaware that that much time had actually passed. "After last night-"
Bucky had clenched his jaw as Steve spoke, listening to what he was saying, and hearing the words start to line up with some of the more recent thoughts he had been having. He woke up every morning, and he wasn't expecting to see one of his Handlers there in front of him, he was getting used to the idea that he woke up on his own volition now. No one was waiting off to the wings to take him back to the Chair, or back to freeze him. He could make his own choices now, and he had help.
Tony had managed to avoid actually having a conversation with Steve until dinner time. He wasn't looking forward to telling him that Loki was the reason that he had had a nightmare, and yet that Loki hadn't broken free and Thor had offered little to no explanation about how it had happened. Seems he couldn't put it off any longer as Steve cornered him in the hallway past the kitchen.
"My teacher says that I'm really good at math, but that's because my Daddy has been helping me with my numbers," Peter continued to ramble on, eating bites of ice cream in between punctuation marks. "I can already count to a hundred. Daddy says that if I can do that, then all the other numbers are just as easy."
"A birthday present from you, Mr Stark," she smirked back at him. "Everything looks beautiful. The chairs are going up outside as we speak."
Pepper looked at him. "And what do you plan to do with this information if I bring it back here?" He hated that tone.
"I happen to know that they have an excellent cancer center at the hospital, and they'll give you any treatment that you need." And if he happened to know a few people on the Board of the hospital, well that never hurt as well. "You're sick, I can hear it," his voice softened. "Wade can stay here with us as long you need, and when you get checked in, I'll bring him over to visit you."
"That's right! Presents!" Tony chuckled and Mary sat up, still holding onto Peter. "I'll meet you in the kitchen, don't eat all the food before I get there." Mary nodded and the two of them disappeared from the room. Tony looked out one of the windows as Jarvis had raised the holographic blinds completely. He didn't remember waking up in the middle of the night, and he wondered if Jarvis had to use the bracelet. When he ran his hand around his wrist, it was empty. The bracelet was still sitting on the bedside table.
“We’ve seen you practicing it with Miss Meg,” Wade told him, trying to get him to change his mind. If anything, Wade knew that he was stubborn, and he would get what he wanted if he wanted it badly enough. And he wanted this. He’d be able to protect his Mom, and Peter, and himself with training.
"Try giving him an order?" Steve shrugged a little. "Have you read through any of the Winter Soldier files that were released?
"I'm here, Petey, I'm right here." He rested his head gently on top of Peter's head. He was vaguely aware of Steve moving to the other side of the bed and sitting down. When he moved his eyes to look, Wade was sitting against Steve's side, watching his best friend. Steve's head leaned down to talk to Wade quietly, rubbing his arm. Wade nodded at something that Steve said.
"I tailed her transport," Bucky said with a nod to the nursery door, before turning his eyes too look at the baby in Steve's arms. Steve followed his eyes, his arm bringing her a little closer to his chest. "Stark got her out of the lab."
"Tony, you can't fly everyone to Africa for Peter's birthday." Mary was looking between Steve and Tony at breakfast. Steve was cooking and Tony was pouring juice, and a coffee for himself. "I know he likes the zoo, but we're not going on a safari."
“Hey, Wade,” Steve said softly, keeping the eye contact. The boy nodded once at him. “Do you think maybe, that it’ll be alright if we sit and talk for a little bit?” Wade didn’t say anything, and he could feel the slightest bit of apprehension coming from Julie. “Your mom was pretty worried, so I think we have to tell her what happened. I know it’s probably hard, but we can just get it over with now, then we’ll leave you two alone-“
He should have done more, he should have saved her. He orphaned two newborns, and of course they would be at the Tower, Steve would want to take them in, it was his friend. Tony didn't get the right to say that he might have been her friend, not anymore. And here he was, telling Steve that there was another baby, even though it was no one's fault, but-
"I can-" Tony turned a look on her and Mary stopped talking, giving a small smile back. "I'll stay just like this until you come back."
“I’ve been able to shield your mind, yes,” Dr Strange nodded, setting his hands on the counter, folding them together. “I can’t remove whatever influence was left there, but that would be more of Loki’s expertise. I can’t erase the progress that the Titan has made, or what he will make towards Earth, but we know that we’ve at least slowed him down.” Tony grunted a little with a nod.
"You are such a mother hen," Tony half complained. The doors shut and they were brought up to Steve's floor.
“Don’t worry about it,” Steve said with a smile. “I made sure to clear it with the higher ups about training. I think it’s important that we start training as a team, no matter who can or can not respond to a call out. Knowing our strengths and weaknesses will work out to our advantage.”
Mary gave him a soft smile, then put a hand on Peter's back, rubbing gently. "Peter, wake up baby, we're home." Peter snuffled a little in her shoulder, wiggling a bit. "There's a surprise for you baby." The soon to be two-year-old sat up a little in her arms, still tired, then stretched his arms. Mary put her forehead against the boys, and whispered something to him.
"Peter's safe," Steve said quickly. "Jarvis took him down the elevator to a safe room?" Tony's shoulders slumped with what he thought was relief. Steve felt a little guilty at the next question that he was going to ask, but he needed to know. "I need to know, are you good-"
It was a lazy morning, every one staying around the table, Tony, William, and Rachel sipping on cups of coffee, Peter resting against Tony with the beginnings of a food coma going on. Steve had been about to start clearing the table, but Coulson and Clint hopped up and started doing it. Coulson gave him a pointed look, and Tony explained that the recipient of the birthday didn't do any grunt work on their special day. It was Parker Law.
"I want to hear everything," Tony told him, Peter's smile infectious. He then reached out one arm to snag Wade around the neck to pull him over to them. "I saw you trying to sneak up on me!" Wade just giggled, a little maniacally Tony thought.
"Second, as much as it hurts to see Mary like this, this is not my fault. This is no one's fault but the man that did that to her, and we caught that bastard. I won't stop making sure that she keeps getting the care that she needs until she's back And third, it's not all about my image, but I need to keep some kind of legacy for Peter, something Good for him to inherit so that he is haunted by my failures, and by my shadow. I need to make sure that he is able to be his own man, and do what he wants when he grows up, not make up for my mistakes."
"Tony?" Tony glanced over at Steve, nodding a little, shaking his hand when the blonde extended the formality. Wow, did he had a hell of a grip.
Tony whistled low and long. "Yup, no more bitching about how I spend my money on you," Tony said with a nod. "And you are so picking up the ice cream and pizza tab on Supernatural nights from now on!" Steve laughed and kissed him again. He tightened his arm around Tony's waist and started to move them back towards the kitchen.
"Yeah." He nodded once, putting his hands in his pockets, hoping they weren't trembling. "Well, right now, priority is making sure that Hydra isn't going to come back for Jamie, or the Serum. Or, apparently, the Winter Soldier who has defected from his overlords."
The skin was cold, but he desperately searched for a pulse. And then Steve's hand shot up and grabbed his arm. "You could've saved us." He was dying, Steve was dying in front of him, and it was his fault. Steve couldn't breathe, he was covered in blood, and it pained him just to get the words out. Tony was unable to look away as those once bright blue eyes faded, the spark dying. "
"I'm sorry, I didn't hear that." Tony looked around, feigning deafness. "I was distracted by the high pitched squeals of a little boy." Tony repeated the action, making Peter squirm again with another laugh. "I think you said you wanted me to keep doing that? I mean, if you're sure!" Tony laughed and blew one more raspberry.
"She's fine, she's with five agents." Five agents? "They're about to arrest Obidiah." Oh no, Coulson, and-
"Maybe you should lay off the coffee for a few hours, you're still a little hyper," Rachel suggested, and it was enough to make Tony laugh.
Tony smirked as he faced Steve, catching the faint blush on his cheek. There was no way that America's greatest heroic symbol was actually checking out Tony. Either that, or Steve was exploring the changes of his sexuality, and Tony would feel a little proud if he was the one to make that happen.
“She was aware of what was happening,” Tony said as he dropped down on the couch, putting a hand on his sore stomach. “Well, that’s good news at least. Steve’s with Bucky, so if he somehow gets triggered, we know that he can stop that.”
“Sir,” Jarvis interrupted softly, but Tony didn’t stop in his motions. “Captain Rogers requests a moment of your time.” Tony let out a soft sigh before nodding. He dropped a kiss on Ruby’s head before putting down the brush and pushing himself up.
"Tony, he did something to you back at the battle," Steve started and Tony narrowed his eyes a little. Traitor! "You didn't act like the others, though."
"Apparently, my former boyfriend, the father of my children before he died, used to be one of his former Handler's." Steve looked back to the front of the bed. "That's why he was following me before your visit in January. I didn't know anything about it."
Tony watched him carefully. He saw the moment that Steve fell in love with the baby, saw it in his eyes, saw in his stance, even seated. "Yeah, Cap," he said quietly. "If you want to do this," he added, and Steve looked back up at him, a small wrinkle between his brows. "I'm just, giving you all the options, even the unpopular ones. You know what it's like to help with six year old, how to handle that. But, a six month old, that's all different."
"It's very serious," William said, nodding as he tried to keep a grave expression on his face. "Incurable, in fact." He crossed his arms over his chest. "It's a very common thing, called 'Fatherism.'"
"Do you mind holding him for a bit?" Tony asked Steve when the soldier looked at Tony oddly. "I told him that I would see if anyone else could have visitors, he wants to make sure that everyone else is alright." Steve nodded a couple times.
"New York has changed a bit," she said, smirking a little at his snort as he looked out the tinted windows.
"I've got a couple schools just waiting for us to get down there, then he'll go in to take a standard placement test," Mary told him. "You know, I'm not happy about the move either." Tony stopped to look at her. "I didn't ask for it. I'm not sure how Peter will take it, either, he's only ever known Malibu as home."
Mary took a step forward and Tony moved back. "I have to go," he said and moved for the elevator. "I have work to do, I have a deadline for SI."
“And that will keep him safe?” Steve asked, stepping to the opposite side of the bed form Loki. “We won’t have to worry about this happening anymore?”
“That’s a great idea, Petey!” Tony declared. “We’ve got two Princes!” His eyes looked over to the highly amused actor who was supposed to be Prince Philip. “They should be kissing Her cheek!” The two actors had of course recognized Tony for who he was, but the great thing about all staff at any of the parks, was that they weren’t supposed to outwardly react while they were acting. That went for any celebrity. “If that is of course agreeable?” He knew Peter was turning puppy eyes to them.
Steve snorted. "I think that's a given." He glanced up when he caught Mary's movement, and waved a hand to her.
Warning, this Chapter is very long. Longer than when I finished up the first Iron Man movie in story. I got carried away, and kept typing. I was watching Avengers while I was typing up this chapter, so that was guiding me as well. I'm not gonna say too much else, but I hope that you all enjoy this chapter, and no regrets for the longness of this chapter!
“That’s why I started working on a space ready suit,” he said with a nod. “I have an underwater suit, better than just the basic capabilities the other suits had. All of the suits that I’ve made, and have been working on, will be able to move independently as well, not just fall around the user. The next suit I’m looking into will have each part moving on it’s own, able to come at my command. I’m still working on the name, but I feel like it has to be obnoxious. Something like autonomous and propulsion, maybe something else in there.”
"Where do you live?" He asked as they walked to the elevator, the doors opening as soon as he pressed the button. He glanced down at the carrier, holding the small baby, eyes closed as it slept. He hadn't even asked for the baby's name.
"No worries," Bruce assured him. "I can always send over the scans, too. I'd almost rather he stay in one place than keep moving around, makes him much less of a target right now."
“We’re all set, I’ve got three key cards, and the room is ready.” Peter hurried ahead of them, and Tony wrapped an arm around Steve’s waist. “What do you think so far?”
"To be fair, we haven't exactly planned out a lot in the past two days. While that's usually my standard MO, I'm feeling pretty at a loss here," Tony confessed. "I figure, I'll go in first, and I'll lead with you moving in. Then maybe you can come in? I don't know." He groaned and rubbed his face. "Play it by ear?" He leaned back against Steve's hand that was still on his back. "I would die for this kid, I'd do literally anything for him, cause that's my baby boy on the other side of these doors, but I'm just really hoping that this doesn't crash and burn."
"Sure," Tony said, cutting him off, shrugging one shoulder. "If that's what he wants to do, we've got room. Uncle Bruce will be there, too, so the more the merrier." Tony just didn't want to see Peter disappointed right now, and if he wanted Spangles to come back with them, then so be it. He nodded his head to Steve then turned around and walked off, several goals in mind.
“Tony!” Steve had moved when he saw Tony bring Clint to the ground, but a cold hand on his arm stopped him. Steve ducked down and turned, grabbing the wrist of the person who grabbed him, pausing for a second when he saw the blank face of the Iron Man armor behind him.
"And now it's my turn," Steve said, and saw Tony give him a look. Tony thought that he was never going to be able to guess. This was going to be a good moment. "Depends on the occasion for you." Tony raised an eyebrow. "Right now? You're wearing boxer briefs as well, but that's because there are people here. When you're going to a Charity Gala you wear custom boxers, usually a soft material, but when there's some kind of party, or you're home alone and don't plan on working in the workshop, you wear nothing."
“He kicked me out of the kitchen after I spilled a bowl of pancake batter,” Tony grudgingly repeated. Steve raised his eyebrows at Tony. “Just because it’s tradition, doesn’t mean that I can actually make pancakes, well.”
"Mr Stark." Oh good, the man knew who he was already. One more notch in the things that Tony was going to bitch at Fury about.
"Well, I think I already did this morning," Steve commented. Tony blinked, his eyes blank suddenly. "When I gave you the bracelets."
Tony had lost the helmet during the fall, and as he looked around he didn’t see any other parts of the suit. He had been left with a gauntlet and one boot, and he wasn’t about to take those off yet. He might be able to get a signal out to the others with those. He turned and started heading towards what had made the mini sandstorm that he had fallen into, and frowned when saw that it was of the same metal as the things that had been crashing into the Tower.
"Hey!" Tony shouted, aiming his hand up as the man turned around. "I'm over here." The whining charge of the repulsor was the only warning the man had before Tony shot. And apparently the only one he needed. The man used the whip to deflect the shot, but Tony fired again. To the same result. A whip wrapped around Tony's wrist, then his neck, and threw him to the ground.
"Rachel and William are taking Peter and Wade to Disney World at the end of April," Tony said, but didn't move from his position around Steve. "I talked to the school, and they said that if they keep their grades up until the week before, then they'd be able to go, and move on to the fifth grade." Tony let out a little moan. "Uhn, my son is almost in Middle School, he's almost half way through his basic school career." Tony moved to snuggle in a little more with Steve, and he happily obliged by wrapping his arm, the one Tony wasn't already laying on, tighter around his waist.
"He did that because he wanted to, and because my mother scares him a little." Mary smirked a little. "He let them stay at his place so he could get time with peter as well. It was nice, because it let Phil and I go out on an actual date without interruptions." Mary's phone went off with a text, and she grabbed it form her pocket. "And speaking of dates, I've got one I need to get ready for. Any other questions you have about Tony, are going to be things that you're going to have to ask him about."
"I don't think he will, think about where he took Peter." Coulson smiled. He had given valuable knowledge to the Smithsonian for the exhibit and had already gotten a private tour. He knew that Peter would love it, and subsequently Tony. "It anything, we might be sitting there for a couple more hours," he chuckled.
"Someone came prepared," Tony teased. "What did the good Doctor have to say?" He asked and started to lead him down the sidewalk to their first store.
“You’re a horrible person,” Steve mumbled out, trying to get Tony to let him turn back towards the bedroom. “An absolute instigator, with no shame.”
"They found him in the arctic, still in the plane that he crashed, saving the world," Coulson told her, looking through the window. "They started to unthaw him, and then he started actually showing vital signs. The man survived after almost sixty-five years in the ice." Coulson looked at Mary now. "They think that he's going to wake up within the next couple of weeks."
"-hasn't been seen in public since his bizarre and highly controversial conference," the reporter said, and Tony was already having ideas. "Some claim he's suffering from post-traumatic stress, and has been bedridden for weeks. Whatever the case may be, no one expects an appearance from him tonight."
"Alright, I'm explaining this all in one, so everyone get your pens ready." Tony waited for the voices to die down enough. "I'm going to preface this with the fact that those pictures were obtained illegally, and all of them have probably been removed by now." Jarvis would have caught them, and started tracing them, taking down every hosting source along the way. "Yes, I have a son, and I love him very much. No, he is not here with me."
"Come here, you gotta see this." Steve walked over, and sat down behind Tony, his leg pressing against Tony's back. He looked over him and saw the baby on her stomach, looking at Tony. She was making little noises that Steve could only guess were determination, and she was moving her arms and legs. "She's starting to crawl."
“I wanted to thank you for letting us move in.” Tony didn’t want to tell him that it wasn’t Vee’s first time living here, but he just nodded. “This might seem a little silly, but I was wondering if there was a reason that you weren’t there to give me the credentials in person, like you had with the others?”
“I am far from complaining,” Tony confirmed with a nod of his head. He pushed closer to Steve, pulling the blonde’s hand closer to his side and threading his fingers with Steve’s. “Never knew someone could feel this way….,” he admitted. “I mean, yeah, there’s a certain kind of happiness and joy with your children, I’m sure you know that by now.” Steve hummed and nodded. Yeah he knew that feeling. “But, I’ve got that, and I’ve got a really good relationship going with my son right now, the best it’s ever been. And I’ve got our new baby girl, and that’s, that’s something else. That alone is more than I could have ever for with my life. Then you come along, with all your, Steve-ness, and you just, you spoil me. That’s what it feels like. I’m not entirely convinced that I’ve earned it, or deserve it, but I’ll be damned if I let go of it now that I have it.”
"Flares!" Tony shouted, and smoke and light filled their visions, giving him the opportunity to get away.
"I think that you actually wear boxer briefs," Tony said after a few seconds, not wanting the moment to turn awkward. "That is my final decision. You don't strike me as a boxers guy, at least not in the new century."
"Give Tony special permissions," Steve added, throwing Tony a smile. "I think I have a first name for her."
Tony leaned back in the chair, opened his mouth, and tried to wheeze in a breath. His father had been Hydra. He had worked with them. And they were going to use him like just another tool. But, wasn't that what they were doing with him now? They were using him to stabilize the Serum, with the formula that Bruce had made, provided to them by Howard, and they were going to use it on humans.
"I don't like that we haven't heard anything else from the assassin, but I'm going to take no news as good news at this point," Steve said to him, looking back at him. "We're still on guard, and combing through street footage. And I know that they're tracking down the fake company names, so we should have a lead on them, hopefully, soon." He ducked his head down a little, trying to catch Tony's eyes. "There's something else on your mind. You usually wouldn't fret over things like that."
"I just had to reconnect the Tower to the servers," Tony told him. "He never technically left the building, the power was just turned off. I got lucky actually, the Tower didn't take too much damage compared to the rest of the city. Cap helped me get the windows replaced, and we're working on the damage to the lower floors, but all living areas have been cleared to live in. Makes it easier to work there if I'm already living there." Bruce just hummed, nodding.
“Steve, have you taken on a new friend?” She didn’t think it would happen, was pretty sure that it never would happen.
"You could always send a text message," Bruce said from his seat, and Tony groaned, flopping down onto the couch.
“Why don’t you tell me about what you have planned for next week?” Tony asked, drawing Steve’s attention back to the present. They both shifted until Steve was leaning back against the bed, Tony leaning against him.
"Uh," Tony ran both hands through his hair, quickly catching his breath. "I will be, yeah," he nodded. He rubbed his hands dry on the blanket, realizing they were sweaty, (and there was no red on them), he reached out to adjust the blanket that Steve had wrapped Jamie in. "How long have you been awake?"
"Never know until we look. Jarvis, where is a projector we can use?" Bruce asked, putting the film reels on a chair nearby.
“You sure? There’s a lot of traffic around, we’re probably at least forty minutes from the Tower with no traffic,” Tony said, stopping by the door.
Steve followed Tony to the bedroom, putting Wade's bag on the bed. Tony grabbed his tablet from the bedside table, and turned to leave, but Steve didn't move right away, blocking the door. Tony raised an eyebrow at him. "You don't like things being handed to you, right?" Steve asked and Tony looked a little confused.
"She said that you would know what to give a boy as a present." Oh. Oh, Peter's crush was another boy. Now Tony know why Mary was handing this off to him. "She said that you like boys, too."
In these moments, they weren’t superheroes, or Avengers, or anything special. They were two people, on a rarely, if ever, taken vacation with their kids. And that’s how Steve wanted to keep it, snapping silly pictures of his boyfriend that made their kids laugh.
“Tony-“ Steve tried again, as Tony pulled the fabric off of him with one hand, the other holding onto Jamie. Tony smiled at him, leaning in to giving him a soft kiss.
“Because it’s a birthday that I can remember!” Tony let out a little huff, leaning back in his chair. “So, you tell the Air Force that I want my best friend here for the festivities.”
"Am I going to have worry about going outside every time now?" Julie asked, her tone showing a bit of her worry.
"Yeah?" Rhodey put down a glass of sparkling apple juice for Tony, who wrinkled his nose a little, but accepted it. It was about as close to alcohol as he was going to get until Mary picked him up the next day. "How do you feel about that?" It had only been four days since Tony had come back home, and while he had had the arc reactor for longer than that, it had only been four days that he had had any time to come to terms with what happened over in the desert.
“I’m unbelievably relieved to hear that.” Steve stripped off the top of his uniform and Bucky could see the bits of exhaustion in his shoulders. He remembered seeing the same set in a much smaller body, something that had followed up on the heels of breathless coughing, sleepless nights, and too much ignoring his limits. Their team had been going out and searching for stolen relics and artifacts from SHIELD and destroying Hydra bases. Bucky was more than happy most of the time to let them go out as he was still working on his memories, and he and Meg figuring out how to actually get the Winter Soldier under control.
So, this took me a little longer to finish, because I was thinking I could wrap up the first movie in this chapter.... It happened, but it took a little longer. But you guys get a Really long chapter in exchange. Obviously, this is no where near the end. I'll be posting some pictures, on my Tumblr, into the crazy planning I went through for this, and how this ended up way beyond my expectations. (megaranoelle.tumblr.com) Unbeta'd as usual.
"Too concerned??" Her eyes widened a little at his words. "Tony, you just pulled out a smoking core from your chest, I think I have right to be concerned."
"I want a red one!" Wade exclaimed. "Then Pete and me, we're gonna be Jedi, only he'll be on the Light side, and I'll be on the Dark side."
"You did perfectly, sweetheart," his mom replied proudly. "You and Peter were the picture of perfection up there." That made both boys beam proudly.
"Yes, Sir, but I think you would rather not have to dig it out of the snow." Tony blinked and glanced up when the possibility was presented with him. Then his mind put the words together.
“You know, you’re right,” Tony said quickly with a nod. “It’s late, we should go up and get to bed. The kids will be waking us up, as per usual, and it just wouldn’t do any good if I was too tired to get up.” Steve glanced back at him, one eyebrow raised up. He slid his hand into Tony’s, but continued getting closer, dragging the inventor closer with him. Steve felt the pull of Tony's hand on his, but he kept getting closer. With his free hand, Steve gently turned the left hand of the Iron Man suit and looked for the MK stamp.
"Not legally," she shook her head. "My Aunt always called me Meg, so I just started going by that. It's how I was always registered at schools, too, so I always have to fill out that little tab of 'Other Names' on applications and forms." Meg pushed herself from against the wall. "I need to go check on my kids, and then I'm going to lay down. Lock my door, put Jarvis on sentry mode, I don't care. Just, let me know if something happens?" Steve nodded a little and they watched her make her way back to the nursery.
He still knocked quietly before stepping inside. Julie was sitting on the couch, holding onto a quiet Jamie. On the loveseat next to the couch was Wade, holding onto Peter, both looking asleep on the couch while some movie played softly in the background. Peter had his knees drawn to his chest, arms wrapped around his legs, cheeks and eyes a little puffy from crying.
Tony sprinted forward, past Rachel, trusting Steve to get Rachel. He was right when he heard Rachel huff and protest, more quietly, to Steve. Tony stopped in the middle of the walkway, not letting George move any further. "She has a point. What are you doing here?"
“I know, and you did it.” Steve praised, and Tony relaxed in his arms. His whole body felt sluggish, and his brain was having a hard time keeping up. He was just so tired, and he hurt. “Stay awake, Tony,” Steve’s voice seemed to bounce around his ears. “Come on, stay with me.” He was shifting again, and he though he felt other hands, smaller hands, on his arm before blacking out.
"Three minutes, max." Tony swallowed at the words. He shot at the chitauri, getting to his feet. "The payload will wipe out Midtown." Midtown was where they were, was where Peter was.
Steve reached over and put his hand on Tony's arm, nodding to him. "I'd do it again, without hesitation."
"New element?" Steve asked. He had noticed black lines on Tony's neck on his first visit to the lab that he and Dr Banner had been working. If he thought back on it, the project that he saw on the table, the one that he thought that Tony had been working on because he was bored, it was blue, much like the glowing reactor in his chest. Tony hadn't brought up a personal pet project, he was working on a new reactor. "Why did Tony need a new reactor, Jarvis?"
"Mmmm, Peter doesn't like strawberries this week?" Tony guessed, taking a big swig of coffee from his mug. "Is he over that yet, by the way? If he's going to suddenly love them, I want to make sure I have some next time he comes over."
Bucky had his hands behind his head, legs stretched out on the bed, watching the stars light up on the ceiling. Jamie was on his chest, pointing every so often at one that blinked a little brighter than another. When Bucky didn’t say anything, she turned her head and patted his chest with her hand, pointing up again. “Yeah, I see it. I don’t know what it’s called though. Your Daddy would probably know though.” She seemed satisfied with his answer and turned her head back around.
“No need to be a dick about it,” Tony mumbled under his breath before pulling one in. he straightened a little in his chair and nodded. “Yeah, alright, let’s do this.”
"So, they've taken Bruce's base formula, and now they're trying to splice it with your own Super Serum DNA," Tony finished, hopping up to sit on the counter of the lab. He caught Bruce looking at him, willing him to spill the rest, but Steve was already starting to look like he might lose the color in his face. “Luckily, Clint found a nifty thumb drive that has lots of information on it. Bad news is, each folder is hit with its own encryption barrier.” Tony leaned back on his hands, before leaning forward again a few second later. He was feeling extremely restless now. “It’s slow going, trying to unlock off of it, but I’m making progress. Which is why I’m sure that I’ll manage to find a list of locations, and find that research lab for you.” Bruce’s stare was still on him.
