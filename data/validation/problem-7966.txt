What had started as a plan to make a short video for Steve had turned into one of the hottest goddamn
Tony did his best to suck down a shaky breath as Steve told him, but it was difficult to contain himself as his body responded to its conditioning. His hips rolled up instinctively after Steve’s thick fingers; the metal cuffs kept him from moving much at all, but Steve noticed his positive response and rewarded him by curling his fingers just so and smoothing the lubricated pads of his fingers over Tony’s prostate.
“Oh, god no, I don’t want anything to do with the conversation,” Steve answered in a rush, and Tony snickered so suddenly he nearly squeaked. “No, I just—I’m happiest listening.”
Tony gasped softly and stared at him as if he had been struck in the face. “You…. Steve, you cannot mean that. You are a hero, a—you’re Captain America.”
Tony, who knew many things but would have been hard-pressed to ever identify Blackmun at all, couldn’t help but look impressed. “You in politics or something?”
Except Jane wasn’t leaving alone. Steve was grabbing his leather jacket off the chair he hadn’t bothered to sit in once and followed Jane through the crowd - back to Tony!
Before he could think of a diplomatic way to raise the suggestion, however, Tony’s little group was already swarming him with questions.
“I can’t help that you think I’m cute,” Steve told him with feigned innocence, and Tony’s smirk almost slipped into a laugh.
“Not why I said it, sweetheart,” he promised, pressing a soft, lingering kiss to Tony’s lips. “Maybe another time.”
“Please, Steve Rogers,” Tony said as he and Bruce rushed to keep up with Steve’s furious march out of the Governor’s offices. “Enhance your calm, this was a misunderstanding—”
“Because I am at home and comfortable, and wanted to assure myself I don't have to leave,” Thor explained honestly. Tony couldn’t find a flaw in that logic.
“Which conveniently brings us to what is legal,” the Chief Director said. “In your time, adulthood was bestowed at the age of majority. Here, adulthood is a legal status with requirements. Completing all educational requirements brings one to silver class status. Silver class adults must complete the mentorship of a minor to become independent, gold class adults. Since you have accomplished neither, you are considered a minor.”
Long minutes passed before Tony reluctantly pulled off and let Steve’s cock slip from his lips. The loss of his warm mouth left Steve shivering even in their hot shower, but a calm had returned to him. His limbs were heavy and uncooperative, as if this short time away from his daily stress was all he needed to remember his exhaustion. Patiently, Tony helped him up and led them out to the bedroom. They fell into bed, dried but tangled in each other through shared kisses and supportive arms.
“I love Black Panther as much as the next guy,” Tony promised, “but it was
,” Tony added with a pointed emphasis. “So you tell me: who could possibly compete with you?”
Steve night as well have accused him of high treason. “Proposing?” he coughed up as his uncomfortable surprise grew into nervous laughter. “Steve, you know as well as I do what it takes to be success in politics. I need a good wife, I need to grow up.”
Without any answers from the source, Steve turned on Bucky with murder in his eyes.
“This is either going to sound crazy or cliche,” Tony warned them before he turned the laptop around with the lid nearly closed. “They were all young, attractive. All single. No signs of sexual assault,” he added, because it needed to be said, “but I think sex had a lot to do with this.”
“You thought,” Tony growled against Steve’s laughing lips as his shock dulled into disbelieving joy, “you really thought I wouldn’t want to lock this down?” Tony stole another kiss, a filthy, unhurried slide of tongue and lips and scraping teeth until he had to pull away, panting against Steve’s swollen, spit-slick mouth.
“Ambush weddings probably include photographers,” Steve replied in a whisper. Then, a little more quietly, he said, “Hey, Tony? You ever think of this?”
Ya no me quieres? - Do you not want me anymore?
Steve blinked at the unexpected response to his excitement about a rhinoceros gargoyle. Luckily, he was smarter than people gave him credit for.
“Let’s look at him again,” Steve said after a brief scan of Barton’s report. “He might still have family in the city. Besides, Barton’s got a scribble here about Stark being into the elderly, that doesn’t feel right…”
“Is there a reason you got eight of them?” he wondered, and Steve huffed a laugh that ended in a groan of embarrassment.
At no point in all of Tony’s efforts to comfort the Captain did the man look at him. He simply looked out the window at the sparkling city that passed by and absently rubbed the back of his left hand, as if Tony did not exist or had never spoken. Tony could only wring his hands as he gripped the steering wheel. This man was his responsibility, and if that was not already the most important responsibility of his life, Captain Steve was Tony’s hero. Letting him down was not an option.
“You could’ve gotten me a ring, you know,” Tony teased with such a fond, loving smile that Steve relaxed and let the embarrassment pass. “Any ring, Steve. A donut. You went through all this trouble?”
Professor Stromwell continued looking down her nose at him in silence until she held up the clipboard of seat assignments again and called on, “Sharon Carter.”
“I will,” Steve promised, pocketing the thumb drive and taking Tony’s card in hand. Tony Stark. “I really mean it, Tony. You’ve been a great help.”
When Steve returned to the present, he needed a moment to recall what they’d been talking about. “I keep it to remind me of what’s most important in my life,” he explained eventually, before letting go of the ring and shifting on the couch to lay out on top of Tony, stretching out with care until they were both comfortable.
Steve reached out to the detectives who had worked with them from the 62nd and 20th, and nearly all of them answered the call. En masse they stormed building and the apartment itself. Dunn or Kline or whatever he called himself wasn’t in sight, but there was no question they had their man. Photos of Tony were meticulously pinned to the walls like tiles, making it impossible to guess at the color or wall paper in any room of the apartment. A great variety of photos were taken outdoors all across the city, and contextual clues made it clear Kline had been following Tony for months.
“Hey darling, that smile of yours is—what’s going on?”
“Not just any flowers, Pep: special flowers that made Steve smile like it was Christmas or, like, like the flowers regularly volunteered at soup kitchens on weekends and still came home to rub his feet after a long day. And on a day when I’m away? That’s no coincidence, no fucking chance—”
The ten minute video began with a familiar scene in Tony’s workshop: Tony slumped over a workstation, his face obscured by a welding helmet while he grasped a torch in one hand and a slim piece of metal in the other. Fortunately his grip through the gloves had gone slack enough that the torch had gone out without causing more than superficial damage to the table.
“I have never had so much fun at a Christmas market as I did today,” Tony laughed when they were back at the palace.
By sheer luck, the game became a thriller. Detroit took the lead early in the first and second period, but the Rangers turned it into 2-1 before the second break, and equalized in the third period.
“Thank you, Your Honor,” he heard Tony saying on his way back to the bedroom, and Steve quickly scraped the sheets and duvet around his lap before Tony came in. “Yes, Your Honor, and not a minute later.”
Tony didn’t flinch, he didn’t blink. He watched Steve as if he expected to see a sign that he was joking any second.
Steve pulled away from the kiss abruptly. “Clinic, then dinner. Lots of it—” he cut off with sudden inhale as Tony rolled the condom over Steve’s cock with a triumphant smirk. But this time, Steve didn’t let it go as easily.
It was almost too soon when they pulled up to the Burgary.
Steve grimaced, because Tony wasn’t wrong. “It sounds so bad out loud,” Steve muttered. “But that’s… I can’t help it.”
“Yes, mom,” they chorused, and turned their horses around, riding off in the direction of the east lake.
“What?”
From across the bullpen, they heard Natasha chamber her SIG. “Wilson. I believe my partner asked you a question.”
It seemed old habits died hard after all.
Tony’s jaws worked in agitation, and when he spoke his lips curled back in distaste, as if he didn’t want anything to do with the words he said. “It makes me feel great! Okay? It’s no big deal. It makes me feel
An eternity passed before Jane made any effort to extricate herself from the handsome band of young men. Slowly, Tony dared to breathe again; there was only so long a man could maintain a look of ‘casual sexy apathy’ for a stranger’s passive study before an itchy nose ruined the whole image.
“I can’t tell you how sorry I am for putting you in such a difficult financial position, Tony,” he said as he sat down in a chair next to Tony.
An uncomfortable silence stretched between them at Bruce's backhanded reply. Tony's gaze drifted from Bruce's face to the delicate golden chain around his wrist, and the golden engagement band on his right hand.
“Do you trust me to say no if I don’t want to do it?”
After all, in approximately twenty hours, Steve would be hard at work eating pies and sabotaging yet another attempt to win the three-legged race. He deserved his rest.
“Hey!”
His lack of experience seemed expected, if not outright appreciated by the people who growled and rumbled with glee every time he stumped or grasped for anything to steady himself. The way they watched him, the lust in their eyes, told Tony volumes of how badly they wanted to be a part of breaking in a new human pet. Terrified that they might try to make it all come true by taking him from Steve by force, Tony closed his eyes and dreamed of a private time between himself and a human lover, a man who knew just how to make the most of his body with the vice-like strength of his hands, the slow, controlled roll of his hips, and self-assured confidence of his voice.
“Yeah, there were some seashells. I checked; there was no toilet paper under them.”
“At least four, but I’m half asleep so forgive me if I remember more tomorrow.”
The summer solstice was barely a blip on the radar in old Machtberg. A pagan tradition had no business in an advanced, post-industrial country, and at most it was considered an excuse for families and friends to end their work day by going out to barbecue, taking their boats out on the water, and letting their kids stay up late enough to watch dazzling fireworks light up the night sky.
It took concerted coordination, but Tony pushed himself to sit up so he could look out the window before turning his attention to Steve. “Are you cold?” Tony asked, puzzled and bordering on concerned. “You’re shiv—wait, did you see something? Something out there?”
“Wow, hey, easy, big guy,” Tony murmured softly, holding on to Steve’s arms for support and rubbing Steve’s arm gently in a comforting gesture until Steve helped him sit down on the wide couch. “Nothing like that, nothing bad, nothing without consent. Extensive, enthusiastic consent.”
While Steve and the other masters were acquainted, it occured to Tony that for the first time, he wasn’t alone in his fate. A human pet stood beside each of the other masters, both of them female. Tony recognized them as humans immediately, but that didn’t mean much anymore. Seeing other humans was so rare that any sense of kinship was lost to the shock. If he was honest, he’d forgotten what girls looked like.
“Where’d you go, Buck?” Steve called far too sweetly as he stalked from room to room, “I won’t hurt you, I just want to talk…”
“I’ve never seen someone turn that shade of red before in my life!” Tony gasped between breathless giggling, wiping tears from his eyes. “My god, that was good, that—that was gold, Jesus.”
“Sure,” Steve said, resisting the childish instinct to wave goodbye as he watched him go. Once the door closed behind him, Steve glanced at his own watch. Hawley’s meeting would start in twenty minutes, surely she’d be in her office by now.
didn’t look.
He offered the pink peonies to Tony again, but this time he did so at a distance. Tony looked at the peonies for a beat before looking up at Steve.
“The doors will open for exiting without a scan,” he explained while they waited for the car to be completely lifted out of the underground parking lot and returned to solid ground. “The retinal scan initiates the return of your conveyance. No meeting has yet been called for the morning, Steve Rogers, why do we not use this time for you to begin driving?”
“While
Steve rubbed gentle, soothing circles over the small of Tony’s back, easing him down from the high of his orgasm. When Steve was sure he had all he could get out of him for this round, he disengaged the device and pulled it free to allow Tony’s ass temporary but needed rest. Muddled and cozy as Tony was after his high, he rolled away from Steve as soon as he was released, crawling instinctively under the covers to fall deeper into sleep.
“007 is being cleared for active duty as we speak. He’ll want leads on Scorpius. Explosives haven’t gotten anything out of it, but, since this was what got you hired in the first place,” Bucky reasoned, “I thought you might have more luck.”
“And I would not find a better Prince for my kingdom, but your people need you. They have not had dependable leadership for decades and you are their last tether in a new government. I would sooner see our kingdoms united than allow you to abdicate.”
But what worthwhile, serious person can read his course syllabi and miss the very first assignments listed on the page? Maybe it was true what they all thought about him when they looked at him - another dimwitted blond with a rack the size of Kansas and an ass to rest your drink on. Maybe he should drop this nonsense and go back to modeling while he still had the body people were willing to pay to dress up.
He might as well have been a little boy on Christmas morning.
“You city folk get so sensitive about compliments,” she said with a roll of her eyes and a shake of her head. Then, as if nothing had happened, she changed the subject by putting the shopping bags down on Tony’s workbench. “Here, Tony. One of these should fit. Now, I don’t want to see your underwear showing the rest of the time you’re home, you hear me? I raised you better than that.”
Soon enough, Steve found Brock in the kitchen by the drinks, talking to Maria Hill. Steve didn’t even have to speak for Brock to notice him and forget about whatever Hill was saying.
“Only with people who want to kiss me or punch me,” Tony purred, practically bragging. “And you don’t seem that violent to me.”
And while he didn’t really know her yet, something told him that a friend like Natasha wouldn’t let him fail in this intimidating new world. She would have his back. In return, he’d do his damn best to have hers.
It was a big party in a big lodge upstate, full of people ranging from best friends and absolute strangers. Bucky and Steve had driven up early in the day to help Sam and Sharon set everything up, and by the time Tony arrived, Steve had a small crowd of followers offering to buy him a drink at a party with an open bar. Not that Tony could blame them. Steve’s proportions were unreal, and his broad chest and bared pecs practically begged to be touched. But as much as Tony typically loved seeing people gawking at his man, gawking at his nearly-nude man was another matter entirely.
“What about the Constitution!” Tony shouted just as Steve slipped into the room. “What, are they so busy justifying the second amendment that they just skipped over the first? This is fundamentally un-American, Chief, how could you let—”
“Wait, Tony. This sounds, I definitely want to hear what you found, but I’m not there at the moment,” Steve explained, but he rushed past the minor inconvenience. “Can I meet you somewhere? A coffee shop? Diner?”
Five of the jets were finished with the traditional steel grey, designed with Tony’s unrivaled stealth technology to help them navigate unseen and undetected by any contemporary technology. The last plane was gilded red and gold, and it carried the king. It was unmistakable and designed to be visible from the air and from the ground, even by the naked eye.
“Very,” Steve said with a frown, though as Tony started to get a clearer picture of his surroundings, he realized Steve wasn’t actually moving to exit the stretch car.
“I, uh,” Tony stammered. He stared at Stephanie, wide-eyed, as if now that he was finally here, he wasn’t sure what he could possibly say. “I, I was wrong. I thought—I misheard you and Clint. I thought you were binding yourself to the Chief because she is a Woman. Because you thought, you know. That she is better.”
Steve hesitated on the threshold into the kitchen. Now he saw that he’d caught Tony in the middle of carving up a golden brown, crispy baked chicken. A deep dish of mac and cheese sat cooling on the counter nearby beside a plate that was already loaded with steamed broccoli and carrots. The food filled the air with irresistible spices and the promise of butter, and not for the first time in their short acquaintance, Steve really wished they’d met under different circumstances.
Tony hummed to himself, satisfied. “Every report of the Assembly talks about you, you know. Everyone is realizing how handsome you are. I am not sure I like that you are now out there in the world without me…”
“You’re burning up, mein Schafes. I’m calling a doctor,” he said with a pinched, worrying frown. Tony couldn’t have cared less. When he mulishly insisted that all he wanted to do was sleep, Steve changed tact. “You can sleep as long as you like, you’re staying home today.”
and comes home to a Steve who, until now has seen his time off to be with Tony while Tony works as his first serious vacation in a decade, is starting to see how comfortable living with no strict diets affects his body. When Tony finally realizes what the problem is (which is the last thing Steve wants to open up about), he makes it his mission to show Steve just how much he is loving and turned on by the softer body and absence of definition.
“Sweetheart, listen to me,” Steve said in a loud but gentle voice. Tony whined but shut his mouth to listen. “Step away from your computer. Take a long, warm shower. I will see you in forty minutes.”
Steve settled him into position easily, strapping Tony down by his forearms and thighs. The cushioned counter was quite comfortable, and if Steve kept his time well, Tony would only enjoy meeting his daily quota.
For the first time he felt an understanding for how important this part of Tony's life must have been for him. In his way, he could better appreciate Tony’s loss. It was tragic and heartbreaking, but still Steve he couldn't stop himself from smiling about realizing this unexpected connection between them.
Tony nestled in close, too. Steve wriggled his hand through the clouds of magic keeping him warm until he found Tony’s hand. Tony returned the squeeze and moved in even closer. Steve could even smell the salty brine in his hair.
“We had a good time finding Iron Man,” Steve sang the same tune to another journalist—Carl this time, maybe?—and he did it with his typical Steve Rogers smile. He had said the same words to six other journalists before Carl already, but Tony had noticed that when he said anything with that USO smile, people gladly gobbled up anything.
“You hungry, Steve?” Tony whispered into Steve’s hair, hoping he wouldn’t wake the man if he’d already fallen asleep.
“Just because I’m here doesn’t mean you can ignore your phone, babe,” he informed Steve in quiet, laughing words. “Peggy wants you to call her back.”
Maybe it was a simple statement of fact, but Steve chose to interpret it the way he hoped Tony meant it.
“You know, I’ve been thinking,” Bruce mumbled without picking his head off the floor. “That… that Amanda? She sounds great for subject number two.”
“Tony, get up here,” he called down before turning to hold his hand out, urging Tony to follow him. “This is incredible!”
Pull himself together. Avoid classic signs of anxiety.
“Why do people play chess?” Tony asked then, without irony. Steve mulled it over for a while, because it wasn’t a question he had considered before.
“Depends,” Tony replied, humming to himself softly. “My treat?”
“Yes, tell them what it’s about,” Stephen urged, giving Tony the space to do his job.
Tony clicked his mouth shut and glared back at Steve while the jerk only grinned back at him.
“What for?”
“You can stand up, you know,” Tony said instead of answering him. “He can’t climb in through the window, he can only reach a few feet.”
“Fits with the theme,” Steve observed casually, though he was a little distracted by the twenty-something blonde climbing up to ride the bull while facing the wrong way.
A smile spread across Tony’s face the moment he felt Steve rising up to meet him, and he followed Steve’s lead eagerly. When their lips finally met in a sweet, indulgent kiss, Tony was still smiling.
Tony muttered a few choice words, but he stalled on his way to the sink, standing still and listening with a thoughtful expression. “Hey Steve,” he asked after a moment, “is that your phone?”
This time, Tony clapped him on the head with the menu loud enough for the couple two tables over to turn their heads. Steve laughed and cursed under his breath, trying to grab the menu out of Tony’s hands, but Tony held it out of reach and poised for another smack.
Tony rolled his eyes and turned to give Steve a flat look. “Steve, it’s okay. I’ll be—Steve?”
Tony gave her a sidelong look and smirked. “He was right,” he told her all too casually. “Steve showed me how to get here. This morning. Do you know what else he showed me?”
“Yeah,” Tony lied, because the truth would probably end their conversation, and Tony would take that beautiful smile (or those glorious biceps) over two dozen overzealous teenagers any day.
Tony openly stared at him. “Looking like a what?”
“And Helen’s coming on Friday to help Tony reattach it,” Steve continued without so much as acknowledging his friend’s lack of self-preservation. “They’ll take a closer look at you then.”
“Never,” Steve lied, returning Tony’s squeeze gently. “Tomorrow, same time?”
The thought of where he’d last seen her left Steve shuddering with disgust, but there was no way to avoid her. From the top of the stairs, he cleared his throat and asked, “Are you looking for me?”
Spellbound, Tony stepped out of the car and gravitated to Steve in slow, shuffling steps.
There was Tony, clear as day, in scuffed sneakers and a travel-worn duffle bag dumped on the floor at his feet.
“Lord, how you tempt me,” Maria sighed, shamelessly undressing Steve with her half-lidded gaze.
“Stromwell does.”
are clearly okay with someone calling me an airhead, Steve:
“It’s not about anyone, and they won’t care it’s me. It’s nothing but a trade, something necessary we both need but the details never matter. All that matters is how fast I can get my dick out to fuck them. And I fuck them hard,” he added more quietly, because even speaking the words out loud had him blushing from embarrassment and thrusting into his loose fist. “Maybe I hurt them, but it doesn’t matter. I just need to come, as fast as possible. I, I use them, and they just take it. And when it’s done, I pull out and leave, and I never care to see them again.”
Steve marched out in nothing but his dress pants, his undershirt, and a frown of agitation. “What’s wrong?”
While the crowd watched as the archery winner got his award, Tony glanced at Steve with a meaningful look. Steve in turn looked at Natasha.
He had his back turned to the kitchen table, but he heard the moment Tony’s absent, thoughtful humming stopped and he set the script down with deliberate calm.
Steve gradually eased into slow, gentle thrusts again, until he was holding Tony close to his chest while he fucked him slow and deep, drawing all the way out before feeding him his cock inch for slow, burning inch. Under him, Tony shuddered with delight, moaning shamelessly as praise and words of affection spilled from his lips.
“Mind against mind,” he said eventually.
More than that, the palace was never as alive as when it hosted dozens of children and teenagers. It wasn’t unheard of for the palace to receive guests, but there was something special about the joy and exuberance that children brought with them. Maybe it was because they didn’t feel the pressure to act sensible and level-headed the way adults did. Since their presentations were in the mornings, the students had a full audience of leading experts in their fields, family, and their kings. It was treat to watch the enthusiasm bright in their eyes when their ideas and projects were praised, especially when someone took the time to explain the value of their contribution and described how their little school projects could be folded into a bigger vision and lead to remarkable changes.
Much too quickly they had picked their way through their afternoon tea and a bottle of pricey champagne. Since Happy was in no condition to drive, Steve insisted on getting him a room there for the night. He thanked Happy again for joining him for dinner and wished him a good night before booking it back to the spa to make his appointment at the Guerlain.
Damnit Bucky don’t be difficult just bring me the ducking soup
“I’ll throw Buck at her,” Sam promised, since Bucky’s attempts to flirt back with 004 always ate up time. “You think you can handle outfitting her solo?”
“You broke up with me,” Steve said slowly, still reeling from the nausea of understanding. “Because in ten to twenty years, investors might change their minds, and some people might lose their jobs?”
“It’s been a week, Rogers. That’s not good enough. The Commissioner is tired of this author-angle you’re driving. The Commissioner feels your scope is guided by your infatuation, and—”
Tony’s powerful back and strong arms shook in anticipation, but he stubbornly found the strength to press up for more. Steve reached for him, arranging Tony just the way he wanted with his thighs spread and his back arched to show off the perfect, round curve of his ass. As Tony understood what Steve wanted from him, Steve allowed himself to indulge, sweeping his hands up and down Tony’s front, gently squeezing and kneading his pecs, his firm, defined abs, until his hand slipped down to cup and stroke Tony’s hard cock through his trousers.
Steve scrolled through the TV guide listlessly, not looking for anything in particular but hoping something would catch his eye.
“You’re such an asshole,” Tony laughed shamelessly, but as his laughter eased to a chuckle, he quietly said, “Hey, it’s really late over there. I’ll let you go. We’ll catch up soon, alright?”
“Something isn’t right. This doesn’t fit the pattern,” Steve said once he started to process what was happening, keeping his voice low so only Bucky would hear. “This scene hasn’t been published yet.”
Tony’s fingers twitched with the need to reach out for Steve’s hand and take his ring back. For the first time in his life, he felt that phantom weight on his left ring finger fellow socialites had often told him about, an undeniable reminder of a part of him that was missing. For them it was a well-paying MRS degree; for Tony, it was only Steve.
Steve huffed a soft laugh and squeezed Tony’s hand gently. “I liked it better when you called me Steve.”
“Who isn’t?” Bucky wanted to know while Clint groaned about how Natasha was never, ever chaperoning Lila’s dates ever again. Sam offered him the half-finished bottle of vodka for comfort.
“Unless it’s a kidnapping situation, no, Bucky, I’m not worried,” Steve said in a tired voice. “And I’d appreciate it if you stopped accusing him of anything before you’ve met him.”
“You showed me a part of how you celebrate Christmas, Tony,” Steve said to his very willing captive. “Before we sleep, I want to show you one way that my family celebrated, before the war. It won’t take long—”
“Already? You sure?”
What occupied his thoughts long into the night wasn’t death, but the chance to grow old. At least the serum hadn’t taken that sliver of humanity from him. In the early hours of the morning, it occurred to him why this all felt both exciting and so damn intimidating:
“All of what?” Tony eventually had to interrupt him to ask. He’d never seen Steve so unnerved before, and he really didn’t like it. “Steve, what are you saying?”
“Easy, pet,” Steve murmured ruefully, petting Tony’s hair to comfort him while he did his best to push his own robes aside to reach his cock. He wasn’t hard, but he took himself in hand and guided Tony’s mouth to his cock, rubbing the head over Tony’s lips in encouragement.
That one heartbeat of doubt was all it took. His attacker kicked him in the gut with steel-toed boots and wrestled themselves free.
“A cave like this should not be so empty,” Clint pointed out once Tony’s torch flickered and died in a gust of smoke, slowing their pace to nearly a halt. “We should turn back. Only a predator could live here undisturbed.”
Tony hummed in non-committal agreement. “What if I don’t want a drink?”
“The premiere? That’s what you’re thinking about?” Bucky muttered, clearly unimpressed. “Steve, you know how long it takes me to compose a tweet. Now the whole world is going to have an opinion before me. You couldn’t have given me a heads up?”
“Probably cause you’re dressed like a dude who owns peacocks,” Sam pointed out, but Steve only gave him a flat look.
Being turned down now was sobering in a way Steve hadn’t imagined.
Slowly, he turned around to face Tony and his beautiful smile, the one that could light up a room with that dazzling mischief and made Steve forget the world around him.
“Okay, maybe I have
“Second date.”
“What? No,” Steve said instinctively, but Tony continued tugging at his shirt and blinking big, puppy-dog eyes at him until Steve grunted his frustration and yielded. “Fine. Just remember you asked for this.”
Bucky smirked and smugly asked, “Remember the redhead FBI agent?”
“Twelve days are already more than I can handle,” Tony grumbled instead, and Steve laughed. He could see the affection warm and glittering in Steve’s eyes. He’d never forgive himself for taking it from Steve.
What were the chances that Tony had gone camping with someone other than Channing? What were the chances that they didn’t enjoy romantic trysts in paradise under the starlit sky?
So that last one hadn’t been made yet, but Tony knew it was on the horizon. One day he'd be sitting in Steve’s arms, munching on cheese and grapes as they learned about the inevitable: the end of life as they know it.
“Hi Tony,” he said with a smile of surprise. “This is Steve Rogers, we met the other day. You helped me with some computer files.”
Bruce followed him faithfully out into the bullpen, where natural sunlight spilled from the expansive sunroof overhead to warm the friendly faces who filled the room with buoyant chatter.
Steve spun around in surprise to see Tony stepping out of the patisserie, a look of concern clear in his expression. He seemed to have sized up Steve’s hurt side in an instant, his hand held awkwardly in the space between after an aborted attempt to better see what had happened. Steve smiled when he wanted to wince, and stood up straight when his body only wanted to rest. Gently, he took Tony’s hand in his and brought it to his lips, kissing the soft skin of Tony’s hand and his calloused knuckles before simply holding his hand.
“In seven years,” Bruce said quietly, as if Tony needed reminding. He glanced down at his watch with a frown and tried another approach. “Tony, uh. When, exactly, is your flight?”
“In the attack,” he said quietly, and Tony was struck by how young he seemed. “I was certain I was gonna die. I thought I’d never see my family, my Éliane again.”
Even Bucky had called once, but instead of leaving a voicemail he’d sent two text messages. ‘I’m not gay but I get it,’ the first one said, followed quickly by, ‘Does that mean you work for me now??’
He could practically see the tired, sluggish wheels turning in Steve’s look until he finally gave in. “Alright. Thank you, Tony,” Steve said, quietly. “Good night.”
The conversation had turned on Steve so quickly that he nearly got whiplash.
Unfortunately, the only game Marple liked better than chase or fetch was keep-away. Even a decade of track didn’t hold a candle to a dog whose wishes had come true, and with a particularly elegant leap, she dove into the woods and took off.
Tony laughed and inched forward to adjust Naser’s estimation. “Oh wow, so close!” he said in praise, gently guiding Naser’s hands together until it was a little less than two feet apart. “About, that. Eighteen to twenty inches. But that’s not so long, right? When you think about how long their necks are?”
“You weren’t—”
Bruce gave him a skeptical look that tried to convey how badly he was failing with that attitude already, but Tony was too grouchy in the aftermath of his meeting with Yinsen to acknowledge him. They continued to sit in companionable silence in Bruce’s office, Bruce cleaning through his weekend’s worth of shit email, while Tony flaunted his freedom to consume sugar by cannibalizing half a dozen donuts on his own.
“The look that always gets you—”
Bucky seconded Sam’s decision. “We’ll be at the deli if you need us.”
Tony grunted in understanding and quietly turned to his new task. All the machinery was in place, and the broad aspects pre-programmed. Bucky already armed the pen with a sonic taser, a carbon dioxide laser, with a one time use self-destruct explosive package. Sam programmed the stinger with its GPS tracker, wings, and four total doses - two lethal, two tranquilizers. But the stinger needed to sync up with the pen’s targeting system, and it needed to find its way back to the pen fast.
“Why’s that? You can fix anything,” Steve pointed out. Tony’s downturned lips quirked up in a little smile.
Tony pursed his lips and shrugged one shoulder. “You’ve met my mother.”
They were minutes from their suite, minutes from having absolute privacy to enjoy their time together uninterrupted. A security attendant could notice them on the cameras at any second, or a housekeeper might turn the corner on their way to the elevator and see them. Every passing moment increased their chance of getting caught.
Steve was caught up trying to remember why the shape and style of the window niggled at the back of his mind—it was recognizable; he knew it meant something, damnit!—when a thunderous crash barrelled overhead and the world dropped out from under him. In one heartbeat he hung weightless in the air, and in the next he collided against the floor as it swelled up to meet, clattering head-first against the hardwood like dead weight. His feeble grasp on consciousness blurred with the darkness encroaching on what little he’d clawed together.
“Steve Rogers!” he shouted over the ruckus, “Rumlow, I believe I know where he is!”
It took him a minute, but Steve was the first to realize he’d been identified as the sugar baby. There was a certain ironic truth there, and the first chance he had, he asked if Happy had noticed it, too. As close as Happy was to Tony, Steve barely knew him. Before now he’d only spoken to Happy in passing, and besides his loyalty to Tony, Steve knew next to nothing about him outside of his role as chauffeur and bodyguard. This was the first time they’d had a chance to sit and talk, or (as it happened) to share a laugh at the transparent assumptions of their waiter.
“I, uh,” Tony stammered, blinking up at Steve in his shock. His Steve, his kind, gentle Steve? “Um, yeah? Yes, please?”
“But he’s hot, so does that matter?” Bruce asked, looking from Thor to Tony in his confusion. When they both gave him a weird look, he rolled his eyes and said, “I was drunk, I wasn’t blind.”
Graham brought out his guests one at a time - Rob Brydon, Miriam Margolyes, Tony Stark, and Channing Tatum. On the small screen of Steve’s laptop, the crowd’s cheers burgeoned with excitement as Channing Tatum came on the stage to wave, greet the couch, and take his seat.
The world was a perfect place, holding and being held by the man he loved. It was so easy to ignore the world, even if that included his intimidating agent. Steve mumbled something half-heartedly and nuzzled closer - only pulling back when Tony jerked under him with a gasp and a shudder from the scrape of Steve’s stubble.
Lust surged through Steve like a live wire, wild and uncontrollable. Desperate to taste more of this new drug, Steve fisted Tony’s hair with both hands to hold him firmly in place, devouring his mouth and swallowing his tongue, his moans, and his breath until Tony startled awake from near suffocation to shove and pound at Steve’s chest and arms for freedom.
“Steve?” he said softly, and Steve quickly shook whatever was on his mind to give Tony his attention. “What do you think we could achieve together if we tried?”
. In answer to a question he’d never thought to ask himself, his libido clearly didn’t care that Tony’s interest in this moment was about Steve’s fake dating profile designed to catch a serial killer - it only mattered that Tony still had an interest in Steve’s anything.
“What’s this? Detective Stark has a heart? A romantic heart?” Sam gasped in feigned astonishment.
“Deal.”
Steve looked at the offered Hostess box and at the handsome man offering it to him. He knew better than to say no.
“I mean, I don’t know anymore—can we talk about all this later, Steve? We’ll be late to the ball, the car’s waiting. Let’s nail Wayne and then we can talk.”
“How do you feel about lemon?”
Steve glowered at Bucky for his unsolicited judgment, and unlocked his safe again. Again Bucky pushed the door shut before Steve could get his hands on a gun or a rifle.
Thor and Bruce shoved their way into his office so fast it was obvious they had been eavesdropping at the door, and for once, they seemed to agree: they were both
Steve pressed him further into the mattress in return, then slid in behind Tony’s body until there was no space between them. With one hand, Steve hauled Tony’s top leg up and in a deep, rumbling voice Tony had never heard before, ordered Tony to spread himself for him. Tony reacted on instinct, hooking an arm around his top leg to do as Steve asked.
“A king who cooks,” Tony murmured, fascinated by the concept - as if this was a new species of monarch he was discovering in the privacy of his own palace.
Steve was still staring at the chest of fucking blankets that so casually seemed to double as a gun rack when Maria gently touched a hand to his elbow. She didn’t say anything, but she give him a meaningful look and gestured at Tony with her head.
Taken with what Bucky had learned through Natasha, the threads of evidence were finally starting to weave a clearer story. Steve had to tell Bucky; whatever happened in his personal life had to come second to the case. Lives literally depended on it.
Steve looked at him and, with a straight face, asked, “You mean when you talk and chew loudly in theaters until you get me punched in the face? Or, when you invade my personal space without permission?”
. I’ve been riding him over ten years, I don’t need a saddle. We’ll be fine.”
“They got you some good stuff there, babe,” he laughed softly and patted at Steve’s offered treasure. “You keep that, I’ll have some later, okay?”
“Thank you, Mr. Tony,” she said, and her smile, impossibly, grew bigger.
“That is not the definition of life!” Tony cut in with such a sudden outburst that even the passing New Yorkers turned their heads.
“Creeper,” Tony snickered, and Steve reached up to smack him.
. Puppy me, please.”
The sentence trailed off without an end, because Steve wasn’t too sure what was most honest. Flawed?
“Listen, Steve’s wouldn’t say it if he didn’t mean it. If he’s anything but a thoughtful, helpful, caring man, he’s hiding it
Again, he shifted down. There was less friction against his cock now that he sat fully on Tony’s thighs, but with his hands cupping Tony’s mid-back, Steve closed his eyes and forcibly tried to ignore the thoughts of soon getting his hands on Tony’s lower back, and soon after that, he’d be digging his palms into the firm curve of Tony’s ass.
“Alright, let’s do it,” she agreed with a ready competitiveness. “Tony: do you know what Steve’s first role in a movie was? Any movie.”
Steve melted into him with a soft whimper of feverish excitement, but just as he was getting into it and had both hands rucked up under Tony’s sweater, Tony pulled him away by the hair and pinned him with a heated look.
Brock’s face fell. Only then did it occur to Steve that this wasn’t going how Brock had planned it, meaning that
“Tony,” Steve whispered a moment later. “What if it attacks from behind?”
Tony swallowed back what felt like a dry fistful of nerves. He wasn’t sure what the right thing to say was, but he also wasn’t ready to let Steve do anything he wouldn’t do himself.
“No!” Steve rushed to say, and Tony lifted his startled stare from the boxes to Steve. “No—I mean. At least… maybe? Someday,” Steve whispered then, quietly. “It’s… it’s not the endgame anyway, it’s. I mean, that’s—that’s the benefit of being men, right? This—we can choose, choose this for our reasons, not for, for ‘starting a family,’ or whatever. But, for me,” he added, his lips twisting wryly as he tried to get the words out right. “It’s stability. Knowing that... someone wants to stick around. With me.”
“Counter offer,” Tony replied immediately, pinning Steve with a serious look as he said, “I take
“Sweetheart, I think we’re going to need more tha—
“Dad! What—what did you—Steve!”
Antonovich was a ghost. His neighbors hadn’t seen him for weeks, and his credit cards and his cell phone showed no signs of activity since late October. Steve put out an APB, but Long Island City was out of his jurisdiction. Even with the local precinct's cooperation, it felt wrong not to be directly involved in the hunt. His previous crimes had only been days apart, and Steve could feel time slipping through his fingers. He needed this bastard caught before three victims became four or five or six.
“If it was not her 21st birthday today, it was so recently. Hers would not be a relatable story.”
a rational Tony might have responded.
“Can you picture me, breeding you? Filling you with more than my cock? Leave you gaping, dripping with my—”
“Sweetheart, you don’t know how their lives work. Maybe it is okay for them,” Steve said in the gentling tone that meant he wanted Tony to let it go. Not because he thought Tony was wrong or jumping to conclusions, but because Steve didn’t like that these strangers could make Tony that uncomfortable so effortlessly.
“I can see my fucking reflection,” he said, his tone so surprised it approached horrified. “I didn’t—how did you do that?”
Steve stared at him in silence. Bucky closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose to stave off the inevitable headache, but by the looks of Agent Hammer, Steve suspected headaches were only the first of their problems.
“This is some Mission Impossible shit,” Rhodey whispered, reaching to touch the skin with respectful care. After all, this was one of Tony’s prototypes. “I can’t believe you made this—”
“It’s a long drive to Manhattan, Steve,” Tony whined, but Steve only laughed and kissed Tony’s pouting lips.
“Cities are cities,” he eventually said. “Geneva’s beautiful, but I’ve never seen mountains like these. We don’t have alps back home.”
“Maybe it was a high school sweetheart and they just thought that’s what they had to do? It wasn’t uncommon back then,” Bucky offered as a possible theory. “Or they got pregnant and her dad insisted.”
With a weak twitch of his fingers, Tony squeezed Steve’s hand. It took Steve a moment to remember that he had kissed Tony’s palm only minutes earlier. He tried not to laugh.
Despite his best efforts, Steve only won the pie eating contest once in the past three years. Somehow, with all the other events and events they engaged in that day, he avoided being sick or crashing after inhaling eight whole fig and pear pies. It hadn’t been until much later that night in the privacy of Tony’s old bedroom that he’d let Tony hold him and rub his cranky stomach for hours until he could sleep.
“Second,” Steve pushed on, doing his best to keep a straight face. “Tony, I’m all hair. If anyone should be worried, it’s me—like, we’re lucky it’s not coming out of my ears yet, but fair warning, it’ll probably happen in a few years time, okay? I didn’t think about grooming cause I never thought you’d… uh,” Steve gave Tony a bashful smile he hoped conveyed ‘come to bed with me,’ but instead he said, “Catch me looking like a hairball.”
“No fucking way,” Rhodey murmured as Tony beamed with excitement. “You made a fucking mask?”
With a smug grin and an unfriendly salute, Hammer led his team to an unoccupied conference room. They shut the door behind them to cut off any interference from the police officers and set up their war room.
It was an unknown number, but given his line of business, he answered it anyway.
“Sweetheart, what flowers could ever compare to you?”
Tony huffed at Steve’s attempt at humor and pushed his way in. “I’ve been wearing those clothes for thirty hours, sue me. Where’s the food?”
“There’s a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes,” the guy deadpanned sarcastically. “If you eat carbs.”
“We will increase security of the palace grounds; this was not on Rhodey, Steve, this has nothing to do with you—”
“It’s going to be fine. And then I’ll come home safely, and you will be here, safe and alive—”
Pepper’s only outward sign of confusion was a small wrinkle between her eyebrows. “With all due respect, it is part of their job to care for His Majesty. You can trust them.”
“Now, hold your horses, Tony. Not that it matters, but Laura’s grown up just like everybody else, and she’s a beautiful young woman. She even took home the Flower Crown in last year’s Rose Fair, and she’s a kind, remarkable lady besides,” Maria told him, then turned to Clint with a proud smile. “Forgive your brother, darling. He likes flashy blondes and little else.”
“What?
The man’s smile pulled down into a frown the more Steve said. “Just like that? After you went through all that trouble?”
Somewhere between her apology and mention of Phil Coulson, Steve noticed that something big and shiny was missing from Sharon’s left hand.
There was a long, pregnant silence on the other end of the line.
Tony sipped his tea with a quiet hum. He could agree to those terms …for all of five seconds.
“Yeah, I am,” Tony shot back, a paragon of maturity. “He’s actually at the bar with his friends, we’re getting together later tonight. It’s really new still,” Tony added quickly, “or I’d introduce you.”
“Sounds like you’ve locked one down,” Tony said with a quiet sense of pride. “The others?”
“Let me talk to him, Sparky, this isn’t what I—this isn’t about you,” Tony was whispering behind him, and boy, he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t tempted to let Tony handle it.
“Tony, wait. Hang on, I didn’t mean—”
Every slide of their lips grew hungrier, more needful, until Steve’s tongue and his teeth had chased all awareness of the world around them from Tony’s thoughts. When Steve pulled off to suck and nibble his way down Tony’s chest, his abdomen, Tony could only whimper for breath and claw at Steve’s shoulders.
instead of a night-time date at a bar? Are you familiar with the concept of ‘mixed signals,’ Steven?”
They found Maria at the dining table, tying up a tea towel around a basket full of flaky biscuits.
There was nothing ‘to the point’ about Thursday.
If his head wasn’t spinning already, Tony might have hung on to that thought - to the realization that Steve was coaching another creature on how to fondle him, how to turn him on, how to fuck his ass open for a successful harvest. In his sorry state, the thought alone was enough to unravel his last defenses. Instead, he pressed his face into the cushions and did his best to make Steve proud, to lie still and mimic a sleeping boy as best as he could while the student timidly finger-fucked him.
“I’m coming with you,” he told Tony as much as the medics, and with a final look at Bucky to be sure he got the message that he wasn’t kidding about a compromise, Steve climbed into the back of the ambulance after Tony.
“Tony! What is wrong with you, oh my god!”
“Steve, Steve Rogers, how could I forget?” Tony laughed, his voice honeyed and deep. It sounded grounded and gentle, and so very different from the caffeine fueled anxiety Steve had met earlier in the week. “You were my lucky star, Steve. What the hell did you do?”
“Tony, I’m trying to tell you I have feelings for you!” Steve raised his voice to interrupt the greatest hits of Tony’s biggest fears. “I, I have liked you for a long time, I thought it was—it was fondness or a weird next level friendship, but, but...”
party,” he heard some women giggling. “It’s going to
The front door opened and they heard Howard’s voice calling through the house. “Maria!” he shouted, coming through with a basket of eggs. “Remind me to have someone fix the roof on the coop, would ya? Make the eggs, boy,” he paused to tell Tony as he pushed the basket into his hands, then went sat down on the bench by the door to pull his boots off while talking to his wife.
“They can know,” he said with practiced calm. “Orphaned, from New York. Atheist, nihilist, gay.”
Natasha raised a brow and gave Tony a curious look. “He gives to charity and arranges benefits for the most important social causes of our time. You think a man like that is going to turn around and do horrible crimes?”
Sharon’s hesitant smile grew with genuine relief, then she quickly excused herself. She had a court case to get ready for, after all.
For the next push, he tried to raise his hips to avoid the torturous grain of Tony’s jeans against his cock, but with the changed angle of his thrust, Tony winced sharply and tensed up under his hands.
The porch screen was thrown open with a resounding clatter. “I thought you might!”
found ways to misdirect Rhodey. On one memorable occasion in Lisbon, Tony convinced Rhodey he was turning in early, then ran out to his balcony and climbed onto the stone railing so he could jump across the two meter gap into Steve’s arms. Steve vehemently rejected the dumbest possible plan he'd ever heard of even as Tony took the final leap, but nothing would have stopped him from catching his reckless sweetheart and hauling him to the safety of his room where he could take out his shock of adrenaline on Tony’s hide. When Steve woke up the next morning, Tony was gone and one of his bedroom doors had been taken off its hinges to serve as a bridge between their balconies.
“I can’t do this,” Steve told Tony, because what else could he say? I can’t take advantage of you. I can’t lie to you. I can’t tell you how selfishly I’ve abused your trust.
“Rogers.”
“Whatever, boss. It’s your future divorce,” Sharon muttered, following his lead without another complaint.
Clint and Tony frowned at each other across the table, unhappy but unsurprised.
“Ma’am, if we get out of this car alive, I will eat anything.”
For the last time, Steve shifted down. He tugged the end of Tony’s shirt down in an effort to cover his bare lower back, then, with a final push, he thrust his palms up into the meat of Tony’s ass. Tony’s bones popped twice in quick succession, first his spine and then his pelvis, and Tony melted into the floor in his relief.
“You are right,” Tony agreed. “Time is of the essence, I will not delay—”
. At least, for him. “I am
Steve’s head snapped around so fast Tony almost felt a vicarious whiplash. Tony cringed—he knew where this conversation was going, and he wasn’t sure he liked it. “I think I’ve heard of this,” he admitted with a queasy smile.
“Tony? Is that you?”
With a particularly pitiful quiver in his voice, Steve asked, “You got anything good in there?”
“I need us to talk about the sex outside of sex,” he finally said. Tony lifted his head to watch him and found Steve smiling at him - sheepish and adoring, but sure of what he wanted - and Tony couldn’t help but smile back and steal a quick kiss from the lips he’d missed for too long.
With her boss on extended holiday, Sharon knew she could have done one of two things: taken it easy, or continued to run the office the way Steve had taught her over the last three years. She stepped in for his meetings where she could, responded to emails when she could, and otherwise scheduled everyone else to see Steve when he returned.
It was a trap. Steve knew it was a trap; he was intimately familiar with these traps.
A bottle of water and some Tylenol in a shot glass were waiting for him on his nightstand. He touched his face cautiously and found the soreness tripled with the faintest touch. So, it hadn’t been a nightmare after all. He helped himself to two pills as soon as he could wrench the water bottle open, and he finished half the bottle before turning to see if Tony was awake.
“Not tonight,” Steve growled playfully, replacing the wig stand on Tony’s desk so he could pull Tony into his arms. “It’s been weeks, Tony. Yours is the only face I want to see tonight.”
He distracted himself the best he could. He looked around Steve’s place again, this time with the hazy light of dusk throwing the open floor plan of the apartment into a dream-like relief. Steve’s living room was bigger than Tony’s apartment: the couch could have comfortably seated eight adults with room to spare, and even so, there were two additional armchairs for more guests. There was no TV in the living room, and where one might have expected a TV, there was a grand piano instead, beautiful and well-kept like the day it was made.
Both meals sent to my room get over here before I eat it all
How they got dressed, how they made it back to Boston, and how they got to Tony’s apartment was lost to Steve, but he did remember tumbling into bed with Tony’s thighs around his waist. The dimmed light in Tony’s room mimicked the setting sun, and with unhurried devotion, they found their rhythm again without the obscuring cover of darkness.
“I can get started with the house, trade off when you get back,” Clint suggested, “I’ve got the stables to get through, I think we got mold—”
Steve’s voice echoed like war drums down in the cavernous tunnel, and Tony hissed at him to be quiet. “You are my ward, Steve Rogers. I will not allow it.”
“He can hold his breath for three and a half minutes,” Tony told her anyway. Carol stared into the middle distance and tried to ignore him as he continued elaborating. “We timed it. For science. I only took two minutes and twenty-four se—”
Steve had told Tony to be as bold with his demands and as rough with his mouth as he wished. At the time, Tony hadn’t known about Steve’s fantasy of being used for sex—for someone to see him as nothing more than a cock for someone’s anonymous, meaningless fuck. Instead, Tony had been cautious, and only risked a few tentative tugs of Steve’s hair. A good top was hard to find, and Tony didn’t want to scare him off.
“Not now, Tony,” he said instead, apologetic. “I think we need to talk.”
“Hello, Tony,“ Steve whispered into Tony’s soft hair, smoothing his hand down from Tony’s cock to his leg. Steve squeezed the tender flesh of his inner thigh to encourage Tony to spread himself for his master, and Tony did as he was told.
Tony looked up at Steve with a small frown of confusion, not familiar with the reference until Steve treated him to a masterful rendition of the classic
“Professor Nigel Brandon recommended you for a current vacancy in our department,” Sam explained, exercising somewhat more patience than his counterpart. “If only half of what he says is true, the next ten minutes will be very good to you.”
“White peonies symbolize regret,” Steve explained with uncharacteristic calm. “Pink peonies are for romance, but also for prosperity. For your new job and your new place.”
If Steve could’ve talked, he would have told Tony he didn’t want to be thinking, thank you very much. The way Tony was working the lather over his shoulders and his back, all Steve wanted to do was lean against Tony’s solid weight and give in to sleep. But his tongue was uncooperative and his lips couldn’t do it all on their own.
Tony stiffened as if he’d been struck, and Steve stopped talking immediately. He watched as Tony’s expression changed from a confident smugness to sickening understanding. Pale and increasingly uncomfortable, Tony couldn’t bear to look away from the three pleasant faces Steve had introduced him to earlier. “You mean…”
Steve had never seen so many cocks in the same place at the same time. Not even in gay porn did you get such a high density of cocks per square inch as in Chapter 6 of his
Some of them would not return, and for what? Rumlow was not threatening their way of life, their laws. They were either dumber than Tony had ever imagined, or braver than any New Yorseylvanian gave them credit for.
“Not that it’s anyone’s business besides mine and Tony's,” Steve replied, cooler than any man threatened with Thor’s vengeance had any right to be. “But everything I’ve learned about Tony only makes me want to know him better. And maybe someday we can find the time to go out, the four of us?”
“You keep saying that. What is on that computer, nuclear launch codes?” Steve wondered while he thanked the hot dog vendor and stuffed the change for his ten into the tip jar.
“He said the divorce was for me, that he didn’t want to take advantage of me,” Steve explained, but even he didn’t seem convinced. “That I deserve better than someone twelve years my senior.”
Tony packed himself into the passenger seat and reached in the backseat for their first of many bag of chips. This one was Cool Ranch, and Tony popped it open and was munching happily by the time Steve made his way to the car. He stood in the open door of the driver’s seat staring at Tony for a long time, but something must have told him Tony had no intention of giving up his Doritos to drive another two hours, and he eventually slid in behind the wheel.
“Let him?” Tony moaned on the next attempted crack, and as Steve readjusted over him, doing his best to ignore the smooth elastic edges of Tony’s black briefs pressing into the heel of his palms, he tried to continue his line of thought.
“Hello?”
“You know what we didn’t talk about yet?” Tony said with an air of mystery that had Arlene quieting a little and peering at him through her tears.
“So, Stark fled,” he explained, clapping Steve on the shoulder. “Less than ideal reaction, but chin up, Stevie. It only gets better with practice.”
“Or that Lois Lane is your mother,” Clark added with a proud smirk. It was usually adorable to hear how proud he was of mom, but it really wasn’t helping right now. Not after a day of listening to Tony’s excitement over an invitation to Wayne’s annual charity masquerade ball. Yes, it was very exclusive, and yes, it was the perfect opportunity to dig up some dirt, but that wasn’t why Tony was excited.
Steve was still staring at Tony in awe when he heard the Governor speak up in his deep, soothing voice. “I must concur with the silver class officer,” Pierce intoned with a kindness that struck Steve as scripted. “Steven Rogers, could you perhaps share with us your first impressions of our serene New Yorseylvania, 2164? I only hope the unusual circumstances of your early probation has not interrupted the tranquility you carried with you from the Cryo-Prison system.”
Tony reached for Steve’s hand and brought it to his lips, kissing his fingers before pressing his cheek to the back of Steve’s hand. “I had dinner,” he promised in a whisper. “Stay?”
Tony followed him obediently, but he glanced around him with concern, keeping close to Steve as if trusting that Steve wouldn’t let him get hurt. After all, even on a different planet people understood the value of an investment.
Steve glanced at Tony, but Tony was too starstruck to notice. Whoever this man was, Tony’s full attention was on him. Steve frowned to himself. What did he have left to lose?
“Steve!” Tony breathed in his sudden shock of alarm. “Oh, god—forget the cops, she knows about you! We have to get you somewhere safe, right now. Get my phone! Steve?”
Tony thought he knew what that meant, and whatever it was deserved a frown. It deserved to be ignored, pushed away, and told to fuck off.
“Oh,” Steve said in understanding, but he couldn’t think of anything else to say.
“If?” Stephanie echoed with a watery laugh, as if she couldn’t believe what she was hearing. “There is no if, Tony.
“You want my help, and that gives you permission to treat us like shit?” Steve bit back as Tony finally got between them as a physical barrier.
The first thing they saw as they pulled up to the house was Maria, standing on the porch with her arms crossed over her chest.
have evidence of was Steve. Steve had come a long way from that unremarkable afternoon in Australia when he confessed how he felt. Like everything else, he’d taken on the challenge of pleasing Tony with dedicated enthusiasm, trying anything twice and leaving no suggestion unexplored. The least Tony could do was recognize his effort.
Without preamble, Steve got into position, lined himself up, and pushed his hard cock into the stretched hole left by the toy. The excessive lube he had fucked into Tony’s ass was enough to ease the way, but he hadn’t slicked himself up or used a lubricated condom, and the friction left Tony hissing through his teeth with mild discomfort. The pain took some of the edge off, and every shallow thrust helped spread the lube over the full length of Steve’s cock until his every movement left Tony moaning with satisfaction.
Steve moaned softly under his breath, and quietly asked, “Would that be so bad?”
“I’m sure something changed in his schedule,” Steve said much too casually. “Maybe—maybe whoever he was meeting with wanted to meet in Brooklyn instead? Maybe he’d made a mistake when he said Harlem; it happens,” he decided, nodding to himself. It did, people made mistakes every day. People changed their minds every day, too.
Somewhere between the hurt and the fear, Steve picked up the phone.
class was enough to leave him speechless, but Tony acted like it was something entirely expected and typical.
Steve shrugged his shoulders and looked away, but he didn’t say anything.
Steve blinked back at him in surprise, then gave a little helpless shrug. “Doesn’t everyone?”
. Six years, do you understand? Six years I’ve been dating, and nothing. No-one stood out. But two fake dates with you? The first time I
Fear for your diet
“Tony, do you hear something?”
Steve woke up more than ten hours later. There was no alarm ringing, no staff member in sight. For the first time in what felt like an eternity, he was well rested and alone.
“Dandasana,” Tony corrected at the same time as Colin said, “It’s a low plank.”
After another long day of sowing as much doubt in Tony’s painfully insightful connections between Bruce Wayne and a certain local vigilante, Steve was faced with a whole other problem. Wayne’s Charity Ball was a
“Yeah, I know who you are,” Steve admitted coolly. “You’re the man whose son calls him by his first name. You’re not wanted or welcome here.”
Steve turned back to him in a flash, stone-faced. “There is no
“Nothing would make you happier?” Tony muttered bitterly before he could stop himself. Before he even recognized that his hackles were up and his teeth were bared. “How can you say that you love me to the point of pain, end our relationship, and tell me to move on in the same breath?”
He was only gone for a minute or two, but Steve could have sworn it was much longer than that before he had a plain manila folder in his hands. Tony tucked himself in beside Steve on the couch, following along over Steve’s shoulder as they read Marham’s first fertility rites from
Usually, Tony understood what words meant when people spoke to him. He blinked back at Steve, and eventually asked, “Draw what?”
The question was so simple, and yet Steve was already squirming. He pulled his blankets to cover his lap, rubbing slow, pacifying circles over his cock with his open palm. “Sometimes,” he admitted in a whisper, choosing his words carefully. Some things weren’t easy to share, even with an encouraging partner. Tony was unusually quiet. In words softer and gentler even than a whisper, Tony urged Steve to tell him more.
But Tony knew it wouldn’t happen. Their story would end soon, and it would be Tony himself who would turn his back on Steve and walk away.
Tony was silent on the other line for a short time. “Uh… sure. How?”
He wasted no time pulling his sweater over his head and unbuttoning his jeans. Tony unstopped the tub and turned the shower head on, so by the time Steve had tossed the ring boxes safely on top of his pile of clothes and stepped in beside him, they could stand together under the warm spray, indulging in the intimate canopy that kept the rest of the world at bay.
Tony reached to soothe his fingers over Steve’s cheeks, cradling his face tenderly to express himself better with sweet, chaste kisses.
Tony grunted quietly as consciousness returned to him. Someone was shaking his shoulder. “Tony? Sweetheart, I’m back.”
“Sweetheart, if you only knew how happy you make me,” Steve whispered with tears gathering in his eyes.
Flood lights came all around them at the same time, temporarily blinding them against the vacuumous darkness of the night. Steve startled back with a wince of pain, covering his eyes and squinting up at the house to make out what was going on.
- he felt a cautious hand cup and caress his ass. The human-like skin was cool to the touch, and when the student’s long, slender fingers swept down and up between his ass cheeks, Tony almost lost it. The alien’s skin wasn’t just cool, it was smooth and slippery, like flawless silk dipped in water.
,” Steve huffed unhappily, because he knew what that felt like, and despite his hopes and dreams, this
“No,” Steve insisted, shaking his head adamantly. “No, I won’t, you’re wrong. How could it be the right thing if we’re not together?”
“We call her the LaWsp,” he said with a smug grin, pronouncing it law-sp to emphasize the wasp. “Laser Weapons System Pen.”
By the third escalator, Tony had wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist, and proceeded to lean into him until Steve was supporting most of Tony’s weight.
He traveled to D.C. to speak with senators from New England about a multi-state investment in the technology Steve presented at the General Assembly, then flew onward to Sacramento for a meeting with California’s Governor. No sooner had they touched down in California than Coulson got a call from South Korea. It nearly was the final straw.
He started to pull out farther with each thrust, until he was almost pulling out all the way every time. Tony’s head tipped back in pleasure, keening needfully with every breath. He was still clutching at the couch cushions, but he grabbed on to the cushions behind him and arched up as far as his position allowed. His body was stretched and full in a way he had never felt before, but he was a drowning man thirsting for more: he still needed
“Tony, you asked me not to come or watch it live on TV,” Steve reminded him in a gentler tone, “and I promised I won’t. Unless there’s some freak acci—”
“That’s—no! That’s not how that works! Don’t you hear yourselves? Toxic fucking masculinity, why do I even talk to you two?” Tony muttered, but before he could continue, he was interrupted by his ringtone. When he saw the name on the display, he gave both Thor and Bruce stern looks, then picked up.
Steve blinked back at her. He was so wrapped up in feeling sorry for himself he didn’t think that this might bring up hurtful memories of her own. As far as Steve was concerned, he wouldn’t want to be reminded of this morning’s pain two, three, or even fifteen years down the line.
A hopeful smile stretched across Steve’s lips, warming his expression like a star rising in the darkest hour of night.
“This has been the fastest twelve minutes of the day,” Steve agreed, and with a smile, Tony rocked his leg against Steve’s.
“He introduced me to King Akeem and Ambassador Amayo. I lunch with them all tomorrow.”
Compared to the internet and smartphones of the 21st century, Taco Bell should not have been that confusing. Still, between the uncomfortable misappropriation of an ethnic identity that never belonged to Taco Bell in the first place, and the horror on their menu, Steve was ready to bolt by the time it was their turn to order.
“Yes,” Tony said again, more calmly and with more surety, and Steve smiled at him like that one word was everything he had wanted to hear. “Dinner,” Tony added, because his skin just itched in the silence between them. “Let’s do it. Now, today.”
“I can see that you are upset, Steve Rogers—”
“I misjudged you, Rogers,” Maria said after another stretch of silence, once the shock of Steve’s stunt faded away. “You’re really something else.”
“Fuck you, it’s entitlement,” Tony said, cutting him off. But this wasn’t the hill Steve intended to die on, so he nodded and made a show of accepting Tony’s conclusion.
“I’m officially sitting down and listening,” he prompted, taking a drink from his own bottle.
“You’ll be there, too, won’t you?” Tony asked with a smile in his voice, and a moment later he asked, “I’m guessing she lives out in Brooklyn? That might be too tight for me.”
“Babe, the reason I wanted to come here tonight was to discuss our future.”
They would have gotten away with it all, too, if it wasn’t for the long line of purpling hickeys blooming down the back of Tony’s neck. Tony hadn’t spotted them in the mirror and Steve had been too worked up the night before to resist. He didn’t even get to wish Rhodey a good morning before he was frog-marched back to his room where his stylist could clean him up.
“Steve,” he said in a tight voice, “do you call me an airhead behind my back?”
“Mostly my brother,” Tony replied, smiling at the memory. “He’s a pain in the ass, but I haven’t seen him since Christmas first year of college.”
“You can’t fire
They were trapped. Whatever this great Sorceress was, wherever she was hiding, Clint was powerless to flee. Tony sat on his back like a drugged sack of potatoes, and he would undoubtedly fall to the ground if Clint moved too quickly.
Despite his partner’s horrified reaction, Steve’s logic made sense. Tony would never have considered it, but there were few alternative explanations for how Rumlow had evaded their overview of the city for so many days.
“I don’t eat before coffee,” Tony eventually said. “Nothing cold to drink, either.”
“Right. Forgot about that,” Clint mumbled, frowning at Steve’s point. They sat in thoughtful silence for some time, Clint counting blocks of stone in his cell and Steve picking at little tufts of pilling fabric on his dress.
“Listen, I heard what happened,” Rhodes said in that infuriating calm Steve couldn’t stand anymore.
Steve tried to laugh it off for him. “Yeah, I’m fine, it’s fine. I’d be more worried if I was that horrible woman who made me look bad in front of the professor. But,” he said with a brighter smile and perkier tone. “You’re here now, that’s what matters. How was your summer?”
“Everything
He plucked at his soaked training top in consideration. It was sleeveless, always a plus, but it was old and worn. The gun metal grey had faded over time as it became less tight and more transparent - and while the latter was a plus, the former was not flattering. While it was wet from his sweat, it clung to his skin and showed off the his pecs and his abs, but it would be a race against the clock to get the right picture before the wicking fabric dried.
that much more enjoyable. Every face, every voice, every smell,” Tony listed slowly in his reply, shamelessly undressing Steve from across the table with nothing but a look. “Every touch.”
Her words snapped him out of his frozen stupor, and without a word Steve grabbed his briefcase and hurried out. His escape felt like an out of body experience - distantly, he heard Hawley demand he stop and finish their conversation, and he heard her bark at Sharon for barging in uninvited, but his legs carried him out of there of their own accord, working on instinct to get him as far from danger as possible.
With a quiet huff of amusement and a quick glance at Peggy, Steve shook his head slowly. “Right, sure. From the beginning, Tony and I decided to plan our working schedules together. We make an effort not work on different projects at the same time. Sometimes he declines on projects he likes because he wants me to take a certain part, but this past year was great for him, a lot of exceptional opportunities came forward and, for me, it’s been a pleasure to have the time and presence of mind to be there for him.”
“Duffle!” Tony managed in a gasp, trying and failing to look for the bag he’d so carelessly discarded minutes ago. “Lube’s in the duffle, Steve—get it, baby, please fuck me—”
Tony turned the weapon in the palm of his hand, and with a powerful swing, he cracked it over Steve’s face. The force of his blow turned Steve in the other direction, but he stubbornly kept his hand over the towel, putting pressure on Tony’s wounds.
“Explain, please, sir,” Stephen said with an all too innocent smile. “There are a lot of people who want to know.”
“And you, you are not an average man, you—what if I am unable, or something tears?”
“I want something facing center ice, if possible,” he replied, “preferably padded.”
He snuggled in close, and with an arm draped over Steve’s shoulders, he held the bag of frozen broccoli against the swelling on Steve’s cheek while combing his fingers through Steve’s hair with the other, rubbing and gently scratching at his scalp from time to time.
“No solicitors wanted,” Steve mumbled around the tail-end of his yawn. “Try a library if you want the paper.”
“Uh, no. First mistake: that was the Maria Stark Foundation, not me—”
“Without a doubt,” Steve answered immediately. “I love him more than I’ve ever loved anyone.”
“You heard them fighting your whole childhood?” he asked quietly, following Tony’s lead into a long hallway.
Steve, who was already in the process of buttoning up his jeans and buckling his belt into place, came back to bed to stand between Tony’s knees. He didn’t patronize Tony with an answer, and instead leaned in to give him a kiss on the forehead, then another kiss on the cheek.
Tony thought he heard Steve rasp something along the lines of, 'too much?', but before Tony could care to ask, Steve licked it off with the flat of his tongue. Tony couldn't have moved a muscle if he'd wanted to, but the way Steve couldn't stop touching him, couldn't stop staring at him made him feel inexplicably appreciated. This was something Steve had dreamed of doing, a fantasy he had never dared to think would come true, and making it a reality was all Tony had wanted to do. So when Steve could only grope his ass and expose Tony for his own pleasure, another fantasy successfully brought to life, Tony felt Steve’s gratitude and his adoration deep down to his bones.
“What’s he done to you?” Bucky muttered with a borderline homicidal concern, and on Steve’s right, Sam was just shaking his head with a frown.
, like a sane human being who doesn’t stalk his boyfriend,” Steve whispered emphatically. “They’re there for dinner, Buck. It could take hours. We can’t loiter in a bank for two hours.”
“You upgraded,” Natasha observed instead as she took in his new apartment. It was substantially bigger than the one-bedroom hole Tony once shared with Steve in the Lower East Side. Back then they barely paid attention to decor and design; they worked long hours and preferred to come home to their shared, comfortably familiar mess. Now, Tony had new, stylish furniture, living plants, and big windows with floor-length curtains that brought the large living room together with a refined, stately touch.
After two years of unwavering friendship and support, Tony was the first person Steve called when the doctors gave him the worst news imaginable. He couldn’t remember where Tony had been at the time, but he knew that Tony was at his side within hours. Tony stayed with him as Steve’s whole world slipped through the cracks between his fingers. Sarah had never told Steve she was sick; she hadn’t told anyone. Her cancer had spread before any symptoms were noticed. The treatment would not be a cure, not for her, so she chose instead to relieve her son of that burden as long as she could.
Tony went down in the middle of the woods with a shout and a crash. The impact knocked the wind from his lungs and his head spun from the knock of face-planting into the ground, but those were the least of his problems. His foot was stuck and twisted under him. Sharp, burning pain radiated from his ankle, overwhelming his awareness of anything else around him. Worse still, he was too far from the trail to call for help.
Steve rumbled against Tony’s ear. “I want you naked and in this position by the time I come back, sweetheart. Can you do that for me, show me how bad you need to be fucked?”
Wedding bells. Crying and applauding family, children laughing. Clinking glasses demanding they kiss over and over again. The flutter of wings as doves are released in celebration of their love—
Her words were benign, even inspiring. But there was something about the way she looked at him that made Steve sick to his stomach. Hawley didn’t seem concerned or interested in Steve’s career; she looked at him like he was a piece of meat, the same way most people looked at him after realizing the body modeling this year’s Calvin Klein catalogue belonged to him.
“Steve?”
Heads turned in his wake and people who noticed him coming stopped to stare as Steve passed. The armor never failed to impress, and the satisfaction kept Steve smiling and relatively warm the whole way to the party.
Howard’s brows climbed up his forehead, but his smirk was more telling of his mood.
“It’s not like that,” Bucky said quietly, and hangover or not, he looked wistful. “Q… had a relationship with the former Bond. His Bond died four years ago. I think it was the real deal. I don’t know what happened to him, nobody does,” he admitted in a quieter voice, “he disappeared, and his body was found later, desacraged. I think only H and Q know what was done to him, but I heard it wasn’t pretty.”
Steve pressed a kiss to Tony’s neck, then nuzzled into his hair for a moment to breathe Tony’s scent in deeply. His knees almost buckled for the faint woodsy, citrusy smell of him that Steve could have recognized anywhere, and he stood there, indulging in the miracle of having Tony in his arms again and finding his calm in slow, deep breaths.
him, and he only just managed to lift his head to look down between them in time to see Steve guide his cock up to Tony’s hole and press in. Steve hadn’t bothered to shrug out of his robe or even push his boxer briefs down his thighs; he pulled his hard cock out over the waistband of his underwear, rolled on a condom, and pushed into Tony’s stretched, slicked up body with one smooth, confident thrust.
“Do you understand what I’ve asked you to do, Tony?”
Steve grunted in question, but as he blinked his eyes open and took in more of the space around him, particularly under him, he realized Tony wasn’t joking. Steve’s arms were wrapped around Tony’s waist and legs, and in his sleep, he had settled his head on Tony’s gloriously firm and supple cheeks.
As they walked by St. Paul’s, Steve pointed out Friday Street, where Londoners once gathered to buy fish on Fridays, and Bread Street that centuries ago was filled with bakers and their delicious treats. There was Milk Street and Honey Lane, and farther from the water they came to Poultry. Steve explained that Poultry, along with the rest of the butchers and cattle merchants were able to be this far from the port because of how they received their goods. Bakeries and fishmongers relied on wheat shipments or fishermen who delivered by the Thames, but cows, sheep, pigs, birds were walked into the city from Smithfield, a meat market that had helped shape London and England since medieval days. It wasn’t by accident that highways like the A1, A40, and 201 all touched Smithfield. Today they were highways that led into the city center, but centuries ago, the two broad streets where designed to allow cattle to reach Cheapside, which ironically was an old word for ‘marketplace’ and had nothing to do with low prices.
“Do you need another ice pack, Orfeo?” he asked, gently but firmly so that the young man might feel compelled to answer honestly. After all, most would not otherwise want to ask their monarch for favors.
“Sweet talking me does not mean you get away with saying hurtful things,” Tony replied with a little pout that left Steve’s heart aching to reach for him. “It has been two days. I am not
“They offered the captaincy to me, actually,” he said, quietly, as if Tony wasn’t hanging on his every word already.
“Talk to me,” Steve begged, swallowing down against the swelling lump of tears threatening to choke him. This was Tony, he tried to tell himself, it was no-one else.
“Where,” Steve croaked, clearing his throat as he tried to speak. Tony looked around them for water, or anything for Steve to drink, but the room was purposefully left empty for hearings with newly released perps.
Steve took deep, measured breaths as he listened to Tony’s words, breathing in through his nose and out through his mouth. When he looked up at Tony after that, he looked marginally regrouped. Tony smiled at him then, just to try, and when Steve smiled back, the world became a better place.
“Anything to keep the bitches happy,” Tony said with a self-satisfied grin, and he snickered shamelessly in his triumph when Steve facepalmed (loudly).
“Listen,” Stephanie whispered then, doing her best to smile for him so her news would sound like a victory. It
“Listen, speaking of future,” Tony said then, pursing his lips as he struggled to find the right words. “What are you comfortable sharing about your past?”
Steve stilled mid-hum with his teeth teasing at Tony’s nipple. He picked up his head and gave Tony a flat look.
(See the end of the chapter for
“When I was a student? Yes, that was before I was a lesbian; I was still sorting myself out, as you do at university,” she started, answering thoughtfully and fearlessly in a way Steve rarely witnessed in Hollywood. “I was on my bike and we stopped at the traffic lights, where there to my left or right, whatever it was, there was a car; an open car with an American soldier inside. And something crazy took hold of me then. You know that feeling,” she added, looking to Rob on her left and Tony to her right.
“With the custard from those pastries I love.”
Those weren’t shadows on his phone; it was the movement Steve had been waiting for. Ceramic souvenir clocks were being taken off the shelf in a hurry under cover of darkness. Steve picked up his pace.
How come?
“I’m so bummed I didn’t get the memo about dressing up like tired hags,” he said with an intentional shrug to show off the definition of his shoulders and chest, “but maybe that was just a theme for you and your most delightful friends.”
“It’s just… I think Tony’s really interested in Bruce, dad,” Steve said quietly. “Everything he does fascinates him. How am I supposed to compete with a charming genius billionaire? Not to mention,
He refused.
They had stared back at him as if he’d said he was feeling fluish with a spot of polio. As if he had personally insulted them by admitting he was a man who was free to sow his wild oats indefinitely but chose not to. The indignity!
“We don’t have enough back from the lab to start itemizing the new evidence,” Bucky said impatiently, in part because evidence already came back with clear descriptions. “What do you want us to do until then, sit at the desk and guard our emails?”
Steve kissed like he had a lifetime to spare and Tony was all that mattered. At first, it was only an innocent touch of his lips, soft and imploring against Tony’s. Without pulling back, Steve wetted his lips, tasting Tony’s bottom lip as he did; Tony moaned shamelessly and listed forward in eager pursuit, yielding at his first opportunity to Steve’s kiss.
In turn, Maria told Steve that his first hunch about the financial records had turned up something important after all. In his absence, they’d found evidence of handsome compensation for both sex workers in question.
All Steve had to do now was resist the urge to reach out for the warm comfort of another body. He took slow, even breaths, and pretended to be at peace.
“Steve?” Tony called his name gently, but he said it with a smile, as if he could guess at the effect of his casual acceptance. “Hey, darling? You alright?”
Tony pressed his lips together in a clear effort not to laugh, and as Bucky started through the crowd to lead the way, Tony wrapped an arm around Steve’s waist and pressed in close to his side. Steve lifted his arm to hug Tony close and bring him in closer.
Steve eyed him suspiciously, though other parts of his body were far less subtle about what he hoped Tony was suggesting. “Tell me more.”
“Sorry, almost there,” the man promised in a firm tone, and Tony stilled without needing to be told twice. Instead, he held on to Marple where she curled around his head. His worried girl trembled under his hands, but she wasn’t leaving him, and through the staggering pain from his ankle, Tony had the wherewithal to wonder how he’d ever gotten so lucky.
“I hope you’re hungry,” Tony said and pulled the door open to let Steve in first. The hostess didn’t even ask for names or a reservation once Tony walked in, and simply asked them to follow her.
He really shouldn’t have touched it -  by now, he should have known better.
“Slowly,” he finally conceded, though he sounded worried, as if he wasn’t sure it was possible. Steve wanted to assure him that he was fine, that he knew now his trust wasn’t misplaced in Tony, but before he had a chance, he was distracted by one well-slicked finger pressing into him again, smearing lube as far as Tony could reach. He heard another condom wrapper being ripped open.
“I had Potts check out the warrant, it’s legit. Now, unless you want to take a trip down to Gotham PD in handcuffs, I suggest you let it go.”
“My last assignment of the semester,” Steve said as casually as he could. “I still can’t sleep, ma. This is the only way I can stop thinking of him.”
“You can’t even ask me to give you another chance,” Steve asked, his lip curling up in a smirk of satisfaction as he saw recognition dawn on Tony’s face. “You demand that I give you another chance?”
Steve shook his head before Tony got to explaining, even waving it off. “No, no I’ll—I’ll be fine, just, just anxiety. You know. I mean, I’m better, usually, heart still acts up sometimes.”
Time hadn’t diminished Steve’s dedicated enthusiasm. Even now, after a year and with nothing left to prove, Steve wasted no time pulling Tony’s cock out of his sweats, guiding Tony’s legs over his shoulders, and swallowing his cock down with the hunger of a starving man.
Steve acknowledged her report with a nod. “Get a hold of PR,” he said as he considered the first print of a manuscript that had just come off the press. “Have them whip up a press release: Foster is doing Ellen.”
“Then that’s good enough for me,” Steve said, and he climbed out of the car before Jane thought to say anything else.
“Another way to what?” Tony said, still staring at Clint’s enormous white teeth.
His position was difficult to maintain and he ached in the added stretch, but Tony was determined to do it for Steve. Steve, who peppered adoring kisses to his shoulder and throat as he eased into Tony’s body inch for endless inch, until finally Tony was afraid he wouldn’t have room to breathe.
“Rhodes, you disobeyed a direct order from your king. I should not have to repeat my husband’s command,” Steve said in tight-lipped anger. “In seven hours, he and I will retire and I need the Iron Legion to be well rested.”
“I need that computer back.”
It didn't help that he had no hobbies or friends to distract him from the upcoming performance where all those students were waiting for him, eager to touch a Terran male for the first time. If Tony hadn’t already been dying from his imposed celibacy, his undeniable excitement for the demonstration would have been his undoing. To think Tony’s body would be their first practical application of textbook instruction on his species’ sexuality. The thought of being used by these determined and ambitious future harvesters, to be coaxed and pried open then fucked through multiple orgasms to fill canister after canister, a living cog in the machine to be exploited endlessly without regard for his needs… it was almost too much to bear through his imposed celibacy.
“How come it ended?” Steve found himself asking before he thought better of it. “With Pepper.”
The nervous tension around Tony’s eyes eased as his incredulity gave way to tender admiration. Steve couldn’t help but reach for him, but swallowed down the impulse to lean in for a kiss. It had all moved so quickly and he wasn’t sure where they stood with boundaries of intimacy, but already he knew he would move heaven and hell to live in the adoring light of Tony’s affection. This was nothing like the passionate lust or determined possessiveness Steve had enjoyed in bed with men who openly said they loved him - men whose carnal interest took over the moment Steve made himself available. But Tony’s gaze was lost in love with Steve’s eyes and maybe something else—something more than his pecs and his lats and his glutes.
Tony rolled his eyes without shame. “What, like you have other friends in this town?”
From the bank of responses to his cock, Tony’s look of grateful relief was a first. He rolled onto his side to face Steve, and gently cupped Steve’s face before pressing closer to kiss him. It was a slow, passionate kiss, nothing fervent or urgent, but eager in their reacquaintance.
“Steven Grant Rogers!” Sarah cried as she got over the worst of her fright, and immediately she started wiping at the photo album with her cardigan. “These are my all favorite pictures, if you’ve ruined any of them, I will put you over my knee so help me God—”
“You know as well as I do that’s all political,” Tony brushed off in a way he never would’ve been able to do a month ago. “SNL is a, an honor.”
“Unless you mean you literally choked and someone called 9-1-1,” Steve drawled, but JARVIS interrupted him before he could continue grilling his best friend for details.
“I can’t,” he whispered in a small voice.
Slowly, Steve pushed himself up on his knees. He wiped a hand as clean as he could in the grass around them, then tried to clear out his eyes so he could take a look around them. Before he had to wonder if anyone had noticed them breaking into the country and whether he’d need to discuss border control with Tony in the future, he saw a dozen armed soldiers on horseback making their way up the craggy, inhospitable mountainside.
He was forced to endure ten more minutes of Bond’s latest magnum opus before finally only Bond’s panting breath came across Tony’s headset.
Tony’s heart skipped a beat and nearly stopped. Steve was walking away, Steve was leaving him.
In the two weeks leading up to the demonstration, Steve gave Tony a break from harvesting. He didn’t bother framing it as mercy. The interlude, however brief, was intended to help the students deal with Terrans who weren’t routinely penetrated. Tony hadn’t been worried when Steve first told him, but as it turned out, Steve knew him best. From the start, he promised Tony that he could taste his cock twice a day to help get through the dry spell.
“Be straight with me, dipshit, is it broken?”
During their twenty-two month relationship, Steve enjoyed the coveted front row seat to Tony’s dogged dedication to his work, to doing right by the victims and their families, and - in the end - landing the opportunity of a lifetime with the FBI. They’d been comfortably between the ‘drawer at his place’ and ‘meeting the parents’ relationship milestones when Tony moved to Virginia.
Tony squeezed Steve’s hands gently, looking at them for a beat before turning back to Steve and looking him straight in the eyes as he guided Steve’s hands around his body to squeeze his ass.
“What—an
How could one feel weightless and still not move? Tony’s heart pounded in his chest and his eyes burned with the tears lodged in his throat. He struggled to form words, to get the air past his leaden tongue, until finally he gave up on words and hauled Steve to his feet so he could fall into him, to hold on and breathe him in and find his balance again in this crazy world that was spinning faster than ever before.
“Maybe they have an understanding. There are more ways to express love and share in each other’s lives than monogamy.”
Steve set his jaw to keep all the words he wanted to shout from reaching Tony’s ears. In his lingering silence, he could so clearly see the spark of Tony’s delusional hope fade in his eyes.
“I love this job and I can afford to rent an apartment - a flat - in South Kensington,” Tony drawled. “It’s a studio, but it’s mine. Unless you voted for Trump, I don’t care if you work for the Devil himself.”
“How come I never knew,” Tony wondered out loud, then pressed more firmly against Steve’s chest to push him down onto his back. “Lie back, let me look at you.”
“You sound like one of those people who has everything figured out,” Tony said quietly. “Who works out and eats healthy and gets shit done.”
After all these years, the question almost made Steve laugh. “Sweetheart, they’re straight. There’s a whole precedence for marriage in order to have families. You can’t compare us to them. Marriage vows didn’t stop my dad from leaving,” he said as casually as he’d ever managed those words before. “The law won’t make a relationship more or less serious. Honest communication does that, and you’ve never missed a step. I don’t need more than that.”
P.S. Mind the updated tags.
“The car that you ruined, yes,” Tony said with a sigh. “And no, I’m not making you another one.”
Steve frowned into his chocolate milk and narrowed his eyes at his own reflection in the kitchen window. “Not until you tell me why you want to see him so badly,” Steve replied coolly. “You’ve already met him, haven’t you? You and Aunt Jackie both met him months ago.”
“It makes me happy,” Tony replied, like it was the simplest question in the world. “It reminds me of you.”
For the first time in all the months that they’d casually known each other, Maria’s lips pulled into a surreptitious smile. “Maybe you’re alright, Rogers. And if this trial,” she started to say, but her words abruptly trailed off as she noticed something happening ahead of them. “Is that Coulson?”
Steve dialed both power dials for spinning and bucking up to 10, and Rhodey reached over and reset the timer. The training wheels were off. The next sharp turn-and-buck to the left had Tony grabbing for his hat before it flew off his head, and from then on, it became a real show.
One after another he served the students as they practiced fingering him open and fucking him to fill their canisters. The suction cup over his cock helped distract Tony through the worst of them and kept the cushions he rested on fairly clean, but thankfully most of the students were simply forgettable. The majority were even unable to get through it without Steve’s intervention and guidance. The most successful student had the power to inflate its joints, and Tony had keened like a wounded animal as he was fucked with three long fingers, each shaped like thick, beaded dildos. Steve had been so impressed with that harvester’s potential that he had rolled Tony over and briefly removed the suction cup to allow the student to practice using the canister as a cock sleeve and jerk off a male Terran for his ejaculate. That was the only student who filled 100 percent of their canister, and Tony almost teared up to see them walk away.
“Sitwell, I am here to tell you your attitude is tiresome. Frankly, I’m relieved to say I have to let you go,” Steve replied, a fact relayed as plainly and effortlessly as if he had said the sky was blue, the earth was round, or pointed out how Sitwell’s decorative compass pointed due Ego rather than due Class.
Clint squinted at Steve as if nothing he had just said made sense. “…what?”
Maybe the space Tony was filling was bigger than Steve had ever imagined.
“Is this,” he whispered, a frown of confusion on his face. “Steve, if this is too soon, I don’t—”
, Steve thought to himself while his best friend and his boyfriend continued their fiery argument that somehow had nothing to do with Steve or Steve’s opinions whatsoever.
Tony narrowed his eyes at him, suspicious of the word ‘short’ so close to a blatant compliment. “I’m not sure I like it when you’re clever,” he murmured thoughtfully, mostly to himself, but Steve’s face warmed with a little smirk, as if he was amused that Tony had caught on to the jab. But he had handled Tony’s admission better than Tony could have hoped for, so he wasn’t about to question his good fortune—after all, Steve had every right to be angry about the blatant lie.
There was a moment of silence where Steve could practically see Tony’s mind working over Steve’s words, but eventually he nodded and put his phone away. Steve gave him a grateful smile, then together, they started looking for Avis.
Tony moaned softly in reply, and he watched Steve run a kitchen towel under the faucet to clean Tony up. The water was lukewarm and comforting, and Tony sighed his contentment. It would only be better if Steve would go back to his gentle probing.
“I wish you allowed my security to concern themselves of my safety,” Tony sighed, expressing his frustration more than a rebuttal.
“So, this isn’t just a prototype,” Steve surmised. “You can actually wear this?”
“Give me one of those waivers,” Steve said without hesitation. “Tony, I’ve loved your writing for as long as I can remember. If my stupid college humor gets me a nod in one of your books, I’ll sign anything you want.”
Barton scoffed and shook his head with a smirk. “It’s gotta be tough being you and having all the answers to the universe, Stark.”
“Oh, I’m not asking for forgiveness,” Tony answered with a soft giggle in his voice, “but do you really think you can fit under the couch with those pecs?”
“Rough case,” the man said with a rueful smile. “You ever deal with someone who doesn’t want to be helped? My client’s building a better case against himself than the opposing counsel.”
In two months, Tony would walk. In two months, Tony would take his robots and his degree and return to R&D at Stark Industries.
“Let me guess: Steve owned the room.”
“How wou—I don’t have a fucking
“Steve, what are you talking about? And an ambulance, maybe? I don’t want to see it, just—keep it covered or, or whatever,
“How does it feel to be a married man?”
“Yes,” Clint said with a shrug of his shoulders.
Rhodey was a ride or die friend, and Tony couldn’t begrudge him this one time he forgot the bro code. Mostly because Steve was there, and while the rest of Carol’s friends played pool, Steve and Tony sat back and talked for hours. Even after the numerous rematches, when most of the ROTC crew had waved goodbye and left, Steve and Tony effortlessly found more to talk about, more to laugh about, until the bar keep closing up had to kick them out. The T had stopped running hours ago, and Tony had insisted on driving Steve to campus. Steve had allowed it, only if the drive came with a good night kiss.
Clint’s head whipped around to stare at him. “You
Forget the fact that Steve had no idea what the dispute was, what it was called, or who was involved. He didn't know what she was talking about, let alone why he would have an answer in the first two minutes of the lecture. In his sudden spike of distress, Steve could only gawp up at her and try to fill in the blanks with his best possible guess.
, swallowing as much of Steve’s cock as he could.
“Please, Steve,” Tony moaned into the cushions, pleading softly but lying obediently still. “I need it, please.”
“It’s alright, Tony, you have nothing to apologize for,” Steve reminded him, bowing his head to reach Tony’s cheek with a kiss instead. “You didn’t leave, you just scared me, that’s all. Forget that now,” he urged him gently, “close your eyes. I’ll take care of you.”
Steve blinked slowly and stared into the middle distance as he listened to Tony and Channing share a brief exchange that ended with a kiss. It was clearly a
“My mom’s here, Tony. I move back to New York on Sunday, it’s going to be a busy weekend. Can we talk once I’m in New York?” he asked, knowing full well Tony lived in Geneva.
I’m on set rn and it’s not the same without you
“I didn’t even help,” Steve complained, frowning down at his hands and the half-dozen deep, red gashes from the barbed wire. Tony had only just managed to get the bleeding to stop, and now Steve had to sit in the back of the truck while Tony did all the work himself.
The door opened and Stark strode out of the office without so much as looking at the interns (or Steve). Perfectly professional and poised, but Steve had hoped for a smile or look of recognition - anything to make him feel like he hadn’t made a fool of himself earlier that morning.
“He doesn’t sound that great,” Erin announced with palpable distaste for whoever this ‘Tony Stark’ character was. “What crackerjack wouldn’t climb every rooftop to shout at the world about how lucky he is to be with you?”
A week later, Bucky had a comfortable, functioning metal arm he’d warmed up to, and Steve had a floundering, half-assed plan for romance.
“Are you sure about that?” Bucky asked before Steve could continue.
The world stopped and all sound ceased to exist. Steve’s whole being went slack in shock. The empty flute fell from his hand and shattered on the restaurant floor, but Steve was the only one who didn’t notice.
“Thanks to the Captain’s immeasurable valor, Crossbones is in Cryo-Prison where he is serving over a hundred and sixty consecutive life sentences. His name was Brock Rumlow, and he will never see the light of day again. I promise, Jane Foster, you have no reason to fear his villainy.”
“If the murderer is so obsessed about me, why couldn’t he just come after me?” Tony whispered. “I’m alone, I live in a brownstone - I make an easy target, I… they were all so young.”
“Fuck you and your money: I’m not interested,” Steve said with a scowl. He snatched his coat off his chair, turned on his heel, and marched across the lobby to the elevators.
“Then I’m not letting go.”
“What, today?” Tony blurted out before he could reconsider his word choices. He cleared his throat quickly, trying to think of ways not to sound or look too disappointed; he was going to introduce Steve to Rhodey, to Pepper—to everyone. Quickly, with a small, but genuinely hopeful smile, he asked, “Is it so urgent that it can’t wait until you’re back?”
Steve made a point to glance at the wall clock that doubled as a sculpture before answering. “Our sessions up in a few minutes; Francis has had a tough day, though, so I thought we’d wait for him to finish telling Seamus all about it.”
Tony rolled his eyes with a good-natured smile, but he got his business card out anyway. “Don’t sweat it, Steve, Steve Rogers,” he teased, scribbling something on the back of his business card before handing it over. “My number’s on the back. Not sure how long I’ll be here in London, but, call me.”
He didn’t say a word. Steve watched as Tony, in his nervous way, filled the void.
“I can follow your logic Steve Rogers, but you simply cannot accuse the savior of our city of being connected with this vicious multi-murder-death-killer.”
“Yet.”
. “If he is available tonight, I’ll see what happens, but if he isn’t, I’ll have to move on. Right? Cut my losses?”
“Wait. Wait one moment, Tony Stark, sir,” she finally said with a noticeable tremor of fear in her voice. “My father, Raymond Foster—he, he told me—these are only characters, are they not? Fictional characters? If you say the legendary Captain America is a real man, then so must—so must Crossbones, but that cannot be: such evil cannot be. Sir, how could you suggest that a mortal man would live so long?”
“We’re watching Blade at Tony’s tonight,” Sam explained, and Tony perked up with a grin. “BYOPNB: bring your own pizza ‘n booze.”
“Two years ago, I fell in love with you in a way I didn’t think was possible. Every day, you show me new reasons to love you more. But you’ve only just started your career and I don’t want to rush you,” Steve acknowledged, doing his best to be clear with his words even as his voice trembled. “You don’t have to answer today; you don’t have to answer ten years from now. This is just me telling you that I’m never better or happier than when I am with you, Tony. You’re my best friend, there’s nobody whose opinion or trust I value more, and I want to build a life with you.”
“You bein’ ridiculous,” Steve mumbled, his words muffled by the bag of broccoli pressed against his face.
BURN THAT PICTURE
“Whatever he is or isn’t, he deserves his privacy, dad. Tell him I’ll get Tony off his case,” Steve said with finality. “Not that I know how, but he doesn’t need to worry. I’ll think of something.”
“To your single room,” Rhodey continued, in case Tony hadn’t realized just how much more obvious and reasonable the reverse of his plan had been all along. “Where nobody knows who he is, or what he’s doing here.”
Steve lifted his head and started to pay attention once a real concrete plan started to be explained. Nobody had yet explained why a police uniform, and especially one so formal and well made as the one he had been given, was unsuited for Taco Bell.
There was no reason left to argue, and Steve had no arguments left to make. He lifted his palms in a universal sign of surrender and walked away.
“I thought we said we’d take it slow?”
“Snore snore snore,” Hammer drawled sarcastically. “So the guy had a penchant for male nurses, big deal. They roleplayed a little, took each other’s temperature, spiced up the week. It’s not a crime, detective. It’s a little weird, but it’s not suspicious.”
“I’m only applying to Harvard Law school,” Steve explained patiently. “That’s where I want to go.”
Tony glanced back at Bruce, who was at a loss for what to say, and the Chief Director, who was running low on patience. In the end, there was nothing Tony could do but face Steve again and say it even more plainly.
Clark chuckled quietly to himself with the reminder of old, happy memories. “He’s a different Bruce around you. I think it’s who he could have been once, maybe.”
Funny, cause Cap’s costume is more colorful
‘What do you think you’re doing?” Fury demanded as the footage on the wall switched to archived files and folders from the Cryo-Prison, many of them classified and protected. “Silver class personnel are not authorized—”
“I will be faithful to you and only you, for as long as you will have me,” he promised her as he held her securely against his body with one arm, and cupped her face with his free hand. “These eyes and this heart will be all I will ever worship.”
move, Steve, if I had been a little more aware at the time, I would have had my wicked way with you on the kitchen floor.”
“Tony, that’s incredible!” Steve shot to his feet in his excitement and wrapped Tony in a fierce hug, so grateful and so happy - until he realized what he was doing. Quickly he let go and stepped back, but luckily Tony was still smiling (if a little breathlessly, after an unexpected supersoldier squeeze).
Steve could have teased Tony for hours just to watch him. The lean, cording muscles of Tony’s neck and shoulders, his spit-slick lips bitten red with the effort not to make any demands on Steve, the sweat already gleaming over his flawless tan skin—spellbound, Steve drank in the sight of him gulping down air only to choke into silence when Steve pushed into him with two thick fingers. The strong muscle of Tony’s rim pulsed against Steve’s fingers, and as Steve thrust his fingers into him to the last knuckle, he saw Tony’s jaw go slack and his eyes roll back in pleasure.
Out of the shadows emerged unsavory men and women. They looked as if they were made from the darkness, with their dirty teeth and bloodied knuckledusters.
Tony’s sleep-happy face shone with a smile until he just couldn’t stop himself from laughing. “You’re such a liar,” he giggled quietly, shaking his head to himself. “Your back okay?”
“I think I ate two sausages and half a pound of potatoes on my own,” Tony announced immediately, because hell yes, and he’d do it again given the chance. “So much wine. Steve ate every sausage.”
She pursed her lips, then with a huff she hung her head and groaned. “Whatever,” she muttered. “Genius.”
Until he walked up the stairs to the open door of 45 Dunston Street and realized he’d been had.
Tony couldn’t have designed a better out of this relationship if he’d been given an algorithm and a bottle of whiskey.
“I’ll die on your doorstep!” The voice threatened from the other side, “Have you seen a dead body, pal? You know what dead bodies DO? First thing: they evacuate everything. EVERYTHING! Shit and guts all over your doorstep, and I’ll make it extra shitty just for you. Is that what you want? You want me to—”
Hammer eyed the redhead agent standing beside him, but her expression betrayed no opinion. None of the eavesdropping agents were facing Bucky or Steve, except for the towering blond - Steve 2.0 - who from the back of the war room shrugged and asked nobody in particular, “What’s the harm?”
Lila ran around the counter to get to Steve’s side. “Can I help, Uncle Steve?” she asked, already dragging a chair over so she could be tall enough to work the pans. She’d grown up with Tony all her life, after all. She wasn’t used to hearing no.
When Tony still didn’t answer, Bruce leaned in with a serious expression. “Wanna tell me how that makes you feel, Tony?”
“Tony. Tony Stark,” Tony told him, even though he knew he’d never hear the end of it from Bond now. Being requested by 007 was the last thing he needed, but it wasn’t like he could refuse. This was his job.
“Oh. Uh, well. Thank you, Mr. Stark,” Steve faltered awkwardly over his words, “but we’ve already been introduced.”
“Yes, please!” Steve said immediately, followed soon by Clint’s ready agreement.
“What—what the hell for? This can’t wait forty minutes?” Tony asked in utter bemusement. “People have been waiting a long time, some people don’t even live in the city. Twenty minutes?” he offered, before Steve or Bucky had a chance to say no to his first question. “Just, twenty minutes.”
“Not since my cousins got really bored that one winter in Montana,” Tony grinned, barely even letting go of Steve’s hand for the security check. “I’ve never even seen Madison Square Garden before.”
“Thank you, Officer Jane Foster,” Tony replied smoothly despite his anxious, twitching fingers. “After you.”
Steve, he should have trusted his own instinct and confronted him weeks ago when it all started—
In two more minutes, Steve would say
“Hi, Tony,” he said quietly, and with a final pat to Dum-E’s claw, he made his way to Tony’s desk.
“Rumlow ain’t home, he’s got a big fish to fry,” some other voice giggled in the dark. “But guess that tells us on what side of the line y’all stand...”
Steve’s hands closed like two vices around Tony’s ass and spread him apart until it nearly stung. Bared, exposed, and trembling with excitement, Tony could only cry out as Steve licked and sucked on his furrowed hole until Tony could feel the excess drool and saliva trickling down his crack.
Irony had an uncanny way of rearing her nasty head when Tony least needed it. How was he supposed to explain to his committee that he, a lauded genius saddled with the potential to lead his generation into a new era of technological advancements, had lost his entire presentation to a fried hard drive?
Tony muffled a strangled groan against Steve’s shoulder, and his hips jerked forward, willing and eager to comply with Steve’s demands.
“...What are you talking about?” Brock said after a beat. “Steve, what are you doing here? You’re not here to see me, are you?”
“You’re out of your mind.”
But it was one thing to tempt himself with the memory of Tony’s keening moans and gasping demands, of his strong thighs and his sinful lips. It was another thing entirely to do so with a video featuring Tony’s best friend and half a dozen helpful grandmas. Steve left the remainder of the video unwatched and husseled himself into a cold shower before bed.
Steve had looked ready to jump out of the third storey window after her, but Tony’s wince made him turn around. With one last glance after Romanov, Steve doubled back for Tony. He pulled a knife of the sole of his shoe to free Tony’s hands and feet. It was a standard MI6 issue and Tony couldn’t stop staring.
“You say that like I’m the only one making poor life choices…” Tony whined mulishly. “Meanwhile, who was shamelessly flirting with 002 in her own office on Monday? Hm?”
He and Tony had gotten rooms across the hall from each other again, and they grunted goodbyes as they shuffled into their respective spaces. The smell of a warm meal greeted him as soon as he wandered further into the room, and Steve dropped everything in his hands to rush forward and check what was waiting for him on the cart.
“I really like seeing people’s passion for something, whatever that may be,” he said, “usually people are performing, or to some extent aware of social etiquette and pressures, but those moments when people find a way to unapologetically be themselves and share something they love with you, it makes me feel… it’s this energy, it makes me want to sit there and listen to them talk about it for hours.”
“You’ve been saying you want to buy a car for years,” Bucky replied half-heartedly, absolutely unmoved by Steve’s rationale. “This is a bank. Figure it out.”
“And you call yourself my friend? I thought he was going to tear my groin—”
Tony grinned at him like he’d made some silly joke and shook his head. “Having sex, of course. Put it on.”
“Oh,” Tony whispered, starting to feel a cold sweat trickling down his spine. Damn him, why hadn’t he asked sooner? “That, that’s really specific.”
“For a bisexual, you really sound like a straight, privileged prick.”
, by Kesha!”
As the words came out of his mouth, he wished he could shovel them back in. What the hell was that, ‘you’re a good dancer’? He cringed with his entire body, and silently prayed that someone nearby was on that level of Jumanji where the animal stampede comes through so he could have an excuse for running the hell away from everything happening in his life on this phone call.
Tony snickered into his bag of chips, but otherwise was quiet as Steve slowly learned how to maneuver the car by navigating them out of the parking lot. It was a little shaky at first, and they jolted forward when he took the stop sign out of the parking lot too abruptly, but it didn’t matter. Nobody was around to get irritated or pressure Steve into moving any faster. Tony didn’t even bother telling him about the blinkers at first, instead just talking him through how to get back to the highway, when to speed and what to look for, and brave, trusting Steve dared to push it to 65 mph on the one-lane highway in his first twenty minutes behind the wheel.
