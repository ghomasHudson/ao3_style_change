It’s dangerous, out there. Tony has to actively remind himself he has more to worry about for now. In here. Lots and lots to worry about.
“It looks so beautiful on you.” He marvels, entranced by the sight, even though it doesn’t gleam in the low light of the room. There is no fancy light show as in the pictures or stores, there is no sound to accompany the sight, like an audio effect as in a commercial. It’s beautiful in how real it is. It’s beautiful to see in on her, it’s beautiful because of what it represents, what they tried to make it represent, on the chance she gave it and all it meant. It’s… beautiful. “You’d look so beautiful. I just know it.”
Not because they’re not skilled enough to be on the team, because they are, but simply because… it wasn’t planned.
He thinks of Pepper, despairing on a rooftop, telling him she’ll quit because every moment with him feels like dog years. He thinks of her quitting because she sees the bullet holes in his armor and can’t stand the idea that he’ll die for it. He thinks of her quitting when his nightmares woke her up and his armor threatened her for trying to keep him safe, like it had a life of its own, like Iron Man itself had been trying to stop her from stopping Tony.
Tony looks at Thor, but he finds an equally pleading stare looking back, both of them standing on fences in the matter of
“No.” Steve says firmly. “Tony had the Ultron project created long before Wanda got to us. Bruce told us so. He had it planned for years, she can’t take the blame for that. If Tony saw something and decided to go ahead and create Ultron, that is not Wanda’s fault.”
Nebula to talk about something that isn’t all the horrors Tony is imagining he will find outside. “How didn’t you get attacked when you showed up, with me dead on your arms?”
, it softens the blow. It makes him feel less like he’s completely disappointing her every time he chooses the fight over her, which is a constant worry, a constant voice at the back of his head, the paranoia that never leaves, the
“Exactly.” Tony accuses. “So while we sit here, arguing about this, people are dying out there, and we have no way of stopping it. Finding him and bringing everyone back is the best way to make this right. It fixes everything, and no one dies.”
all the horrible things the media says about her, but this is not only about that, but about her feelings for her teammate. How can- How can Steve tell her this is not right, when he doesn’t know where Wanda and Vision stand? He can’t say she’s wrong because he doesn’t want to interfere in their relationship.
They all jump at the same time, shocked by the news. “Is he ok?” Sam asks, at the same time Clint asks “Where is he now?” and Steve demands to know “What about Ross?”.
It’s hard to see, so hard, because the air is so gray it’s almost black. Dust and dirt fly through the air in visible particles, soot and smoke, a cloud of darkness that floods the senses, a
That messes with Steve’s mind much more than he’s comfortable admitting. Not only because it explains
Tony sighs, tired, all of a sudden feeling like his soul is being sucked out of him, like the mere negative feeling of the room hits him like a physical blow, and he says, knowing that what will follow will not make it better. “She wants to go out there with us. In an armor, like me.”
“I thought I said we weren’t talking about it yet, but—” Tony sarcastically interrupts, a little louder this time, and Bruce still completely ignores him.
As a gesture of goodwill, Jarvis removes his hand from the gun. “Do you have a name, Mr. Deputy Chief? Or is that classified information?”
“Nothing.” Bruce admits, after a tense pause. “He could. He might already have done that, even. But what choice do we have?”
, from the far too close projection of his glasses; When he feels, just next to the periphery of his eyes, the light coming all the way from the front of the jet dim a little. The cold, soft blue morphs into bland gray, slowly, but surely, and once it starts, it doesn’t
been pretty good. Was it normal that people just ignored one another after sharing something that intimate and that intense?  That sexy? Hell, Steve still got a bit hot under the collar every time he thought about Tony’s grip on his thigh as he was coming, how perfect the arch of Tony’s buttocks had felt against him, how good his hair had smelled.
He’d known Tony had a wonderful, enticing body, but to get such concrete evidence of it – he let his hands find purchase lower, pulling Tony even tighter against him by the meat of his ass.
”Sure,” Steve agreed dryly. ”It’s the people ogling me or not ogling me that’s the problem, not the tabloid articles tomorrow writing about what happened to Captain America instead of the theme of the event.”
Steve knew cut one head and two will take its place was Hydra’s motto, but sometimes he couldn’t understand how the hell did the organization manage time after time survive in the shadows. Was it the corrupt nature of humanity itself or was it some sort of divine balance that required snakes and rats to persist as long as there was somebody who would stand up to them?
Barnes stared at him with an unfathomable look. Then he snorted. ”How do you say it in the 21st century? Oh yes. Been there, done that.”
Yet, after what had happened, Steve would have expected something to have changed. He knew Tony must be busy, but to have him show his face even once – that would have been nice. He understood it probably meant a bit more to him that it did to Tony since it had been his first and only time to do anything like it, but was it too much to want some sort of – acknowledgment?
Normally fighting for your life with someone smoothed out most of the angles and let you fit together one way or another, glued you together. Not exactly with Tony. It was a problem because Tony clearly didn't trust him enough. Steve had given it time, been present at the tower, tried to include Tony more in the strategic side of the team leading, but there was still a distance between them.
Steve did. Unintentionally, he hissed when Tony sprayed the wound to clean it. The cool liquid made him break out in goosebumps.
Steve racked his brain for a few seconds. Then: “I didn’t know you would feel like this against me; it almost takes me apart again.”
A bit like now: from slouching over a project to straightening up and putting on a decidedly nonchalant face.
Steve had maybe twice in his life flexed his muscles intentionally, and both of those times it was to intimidate. For reasons he didn't want to examine too closely, he turned a bit and reached down to where the bedside table was, to pick up a glass of water left there.
With a low burn starting to simmer under his skin, Steve walked to where Tony was, stopped less than a foot away from him. Tony had straightened up from his slump against the table but Steve still towered over him. Answering Tony’s stare, Steve was pretty sure they were going to kiss. He let his gaze drop to Tony’s lips.
”Of course I do,” Steve said, because of course, he did, and also because he didn't want to address the benefits thing.
Standing up he noticed he didn't have his too-tight get up anymore, but a simple hospital gown that was too airy to have been closed from the backside. He wasn't the only one who made the observation.
Tony knew the patriotically colored icy treat was his own joke, and not a new one at that, but it still hurt. When he unwrapped it he was sure he could hear the
Steve chuckled even though he wasn’t really familiar with the phrase. The lull in the action brought him back to his senses.
Tony visibly searched for words. Then he laughed, a desperate sound. ”I think you're hot, sexy, the, I don't know, bee's knees. I want to do you, or you to do me. I want you to touch me and not
All in all their conversation had been a complete disaster, but it could have been a lot worse, Tony reflected later. And to be fair, it had been their first time, there was only room for improvement.
Bucky didn't say it again, but he looked at Steve like Steve was an idiot. ”I'm sure he's got the best intentions. I'm also sure he's got a horrible impulse control. You could have him if you took your shirt off and bicep curled a helicopter again, I can guarantee that. Even I swooned.”
Steve frowned. Was Tony going to go through everybody’s performance during the soiree? What did Clint have to –
Tony got a curious look, his mouth twisted in an amused way like he was wondering whether to say what was on his mind or not. Steve got a bit apprehensive of what Tony might say and he wondered how easily – or not –  they might bounce back from the no-doubt line that would be crossed.
Steve knew Sam was at heart as much of an adrenaline junkie as the rest of them and he was aware that Tony’s armor was standing guard at the edge of the landing pad in case Sam needed aerial help but his heart still gave an extra beat when Sam jumped off the building and dived down to gain speed before opening the wings.
Steve sighed. “I don’t know if this is the time or the place,” he said and gestured around the cell, reminding Tony that the walls had ears.
They especially liked them play up the team dynamics, Tony saying something outrageous to a  reporter and Steve stepping in and playfully reprimanding him before steering him away.
Steve shrugged. ”I never said anything because you were committed already. I tried to forget about it... Then you told me you had broken up. I decided to wait until you got over it. Then all went to hell and
”You see, for all the ingenuity of the Wakandans, they haven't had the same toils we have. They can bullet proof your suit, but they don't alien proof it.” A silence. ”And while the black thing is very flattering, I think I like the blue on you more. It left
what that feels like. He won’t say it, he won’t, this is not his moment, it’s not his life, and he doesn’t want Nebula to think that he’s
Pepper smiles, and holds his hands, and Tony, forever the hopeless dreamer, always the fool who wishes for far too much, dares to think:
“He was supposed to wipe out half the population” Tony says to FRIDAY, so she can consider that information in her calculations – but also as an explanation, and also as a disbelieving plea, and also as an
Steve shakes his head, trying to push away the intrusive thoughts, when he realizes the call is still on and T’Challa is
Wanda, too. Steve can also see the instances where he almost did the same to Wanda. How he had despaired that night at Clint’s, when Wanda admitted feeling guilty, when Steve still saw her as a
I was doing this. We all needed some respite. I hope I did something to add to your experience in this fandom, a little something to think about when considering Steve's character and his actions and decisions in the MCU canon, and hopefully, something that will make you a little more eager not for a fight, but for a reconciliation.
about Pepper that have not been fully disclosed in this chapter, but we will come back to them later, in other people's arcs. Pepper's character is not being perceived and analyzed just by Tony in this story, but by other characters too - and in due time, we will talk about some things that, right now, Tony is just not in the right mindset to see.
You need extra protection. If they try to arrest you and cause you harm under the pretense of being necessary, because you’re too strong, you need something to make sure no one is going to use that excuse to hurt you. You need legal protection. And you didn’t
“Do you think you will ever sign them?” Bucky asks, and Steve is glad that he opted for an audio call tonight, not a video one, because he doesn’t know what his face looks like when Bucky asks him that. His voice is apprehensive, almost regretful, and Steve feels guilty enough without seeing the proof of Bucky’s hesitation in his face.
“FRIDAY said it’d be fine.” Nebula says, a little too meek, and Rocket says absolutely nothing at all, but he makes a motion as if he’s uncertain if he should jump down from the spot where he’d been sitting on the table, perfectly comfortable before Tony
, because apparently, they’ve all been up for a long time, if they even slept in the first place. But it looks like they’ve eaten, at least. They look surprisingly resolute and steady, their bodies still tired and slumped wherever they sit, their formation still wobbly, but their eyes steely with resolve and determination; And it’s equally exhausting and refreshing to see, stirring heartstrings Tony hadn’t realized he still had left inside him, an old, rusty sense of familiarity, that he now feels he has no right to keep.
“What does that have to do with the Accords?” Natasha’s brows scrunch together, so intensely it makes her whole face turn into a grimace. “They thought he had bombed a United Nations conference. As far as they knew, they were trying to stop a terrorist. In Bucharest, the
“I don’t like them. I still don’t like them.” He tells them, scoffing, raising his eyebrows and making a wide-eyed expression for a second, as if the mere thought of thinking otherwise makes him winded. “Do they sound stupid? Yeah, they do. Who the hell would want to slow down superheroes, right? Who would have time to make phone calls to ask for permission to enter a country when there’s war raging inside?”
But he wonders if the opportunity will ever come; and if it does, if he will be courageous enough to take it.
Not only that, let's also explore one of the various possibilities of responses the public could have had to Thanos' decimation - a possibility that would have been explored in canon, or so I've heard, but never made the cut and it was, sadly, stored away in early concept stages. I think it's a very good angle to analyze, a very fair one, and, to be honest, a very scary one, and it wouldn't feel right to ignore it. I feel like it would be dishonest of me not to show you that this is a very real possibility of a reaction, how bad it can get - so I'm not gonna hide it. If you are a person who likes post-apocalyptic stories, like I am, you simply cannot ignore that even though we try our best, some things are simply bound to happen.
to say it, hurts her throat and it hurts her heart. Tony wishes he could give her condolences too, but if he opens his mouth now and tries to speak, he will burst into tears.
“FRIDAY is running some data.” Tony tells her, and it comes out as a reassurance without him meaning to. “We still haven’t found anyone, but you never know.”
“Sanskrit.” Bruce says, quickly. “I can’t read it, it’s a dead language, but they still use it in some parts of India, for religious texts.”
, he can almost hear him say. Maybe it’s Tony’s pride, refusing to let him call, to let him show any ounce of what he must feel like is vulnerability, in asking for Steve’s help.
The lighting changes again; This time, it’s vanishing, like the clouds are moving back to cover the entire sky in ashen darkness, the smell rancid and overwhelming, the air incredibly dry. Tony has no fucking idea where they are, and by the look on the faces of the others, they don’t know either – but they know
Tony looks at the drawing for a long, long moment, his eyebrows arched to high they almost look cartoonish.
He understands where she’s coming from. Past his worry, his screaming, almost overbearing instinct to refuse and keep her where he thinks she’ll be safe, he gets it. Both Tony and Pepper are fixers, they ache for purpose when they are left idle, and they can’t stand the idea of not helping when they can. And they need all the hands they can get. Tony reacted so viciously against the idea of being left behind while the others flew back to the city, what argument could he have against Pepper following them? Pepper, who Tony knows can hold her own, better than he can sometimes, Pepper, who will never forgive herself for standing still when she could step forward and help.
Tony doesn’t answer back, but he does bring all shapes back to the screen, lining them up exactly like before. But after a brief pause, he sends:
“So?” Tony defensively argues. “It’s not like I can’t afford it! And it’s Captain America themed. On fourth of July!”
Bruce looks at him, grateful and afraid, and Tony knows what it feels like to be the only one in the room screaming arguments that don’t penetrate through people’s stubbornness and refusal to listen, so he really can’t berate Bruce for his fear of them not grasping the big picture of this issue. They are all people who constantly need to make harsh decisions over what to prioritize, what is immediate and what can wait; but for Bruce, who can analyze the data better than the others can, probably better than Tony himself can, the long-term issue can look just as scary, if not more.
“Not even in San Quentin.” Natasha exhales softly, as if she suddenly has had a realization. “They will reduce his sentence. San Quentin is a nightmare and the only prison in California with a death row, and Scott served there for
, this is the most amazing thing he has ever created, and it really works! It’s like the time freezes in front of him, the whole world around him stopping to take a look, to admire, to gawk at the brilliance of what he just brought to life, an invention that’s going to shape the entire future ahead of them, and Howard’s name is going to be written on it.
It’s probably not the time it should be getting darker. Tony honestly can’t tell. The clouds closer to the horizon are turning almost black as the sky goes dark, the dim light that weakly illuminated the world fading as if slowly being hidden behind heavy curtains, a slow descent into oppressing shade, and there they stand, in the open, exposed, being swallowed by ice and ash.
, unprompted, amends: “And also, Howard didn’t let me watch anything other than Star Wars when I was a kid, didn’t allow me to do anything, so I absorbed as many references I could just to piss him off.”
The idea that the Stone could have been responsible for that had obviously crossed his mind before, years ago even, but when Vision was created, how else could he explain the difference when Vision so clearly spoke like JARVIS? Not just his voice and his mannerisms; In some ways, also his
It should not be a big deal, but it kind of is. It is for Tony, at least. Okay, maybe Rhodey is right and Tony did have a bit of a crush on Steve back then, but - how could he not? Okay? Tony’s pretty sure half the class had been kinda in love with the guy, even if Steve used to be, and Tony’s quoting here, “
“We’re gonna need air filters, as many as possible, as soon as possible. That should be a good start, before we come up with something faster.”
“I just don’t know if it’s that simple.” Clint sighs. “I want to believe Wanda wasn’t wrong. I do. I like the kid, and if that makes me an unreliable source than so be it, I never hid the fact that I like to cheer for the underdog. Ask Nat. I was SHIELD’s worst nightmare, recruiting strays lefts and right just because I thought they could be good people if they had the chance.”
“Are you saying—” Thor asks, slowly. “That the last person to wield the Stone before us was not Strucker, but Maximoff?”
Can he really claim any kind of right to the fierce protectiveness he feels over these kids? With how clearly he struggled to give them what they needed?
“So much of my old life was gone.” He whispers, too afraid of being so open to speak too loudly. “He was all I had left.”
“I owe Howard Stark a great deal.” Mr. Jarvis says, bringing his eyes back to hers. “But he does not own my integrity.”
“And where would we go?” Tony asks, exasperated, so utterly tired from being prodded and being exposed and being
And he’ll be damned if this is not all his anxiety needs to pop its head over his shoulder, waiting, patient,
“No, you’re not.” Nebula counters, but not as an accusation. Just an observation. The reluctant, sad remark of a simple fact. “You opened up your stitches.”
As soon as the doors open, the dryness of the air scratches Tony’s lungs like nails on a chalkboard, dust and dirt specks coating the floor and floating in the air, visible, tangible,
, and the only supervision we had was the United States government. Wherever we went, we were bringing them with us. And you wonder why people wanted us to sign? It’s because they have no proof we are
“Hello, handsome.” A voice calls from behind him, and he reaches for a gun he stole from one of the guards in reflex, aiming for the chest and with his finger on the trigger. “Come here often?”
“And what will you do? Sit tight while I take a nap, read a magazine and wait until I heal fully before going out to save the world?”
“You know, Tony… I— I lived in some very bad places before. When I was hiding, I had no choice but to… find somewhere to lay low, wherever that place might be. And you learn things. Things about what the people down there are really like, and how they survive every single day.” Bruce unexpectedly says, with all the tone and feeling of an old soul, who has seen too much, been through too much, as it’s still not allowed to rest. “The way those places grow. The things they
“I don’t actually, but I’m getting bits and pieces here and there.” Bruce says like it’s an admittance, but the way his eyes turn sharp to Tony and Rhodey, it’s clear it’s well-aimed poke at them, disguised as innocence.
Nebula didn’t sound like she was fond of any other of Thanos’ charges other than Gamora. Actually, when Tony thinks about it, he realizes that Ebony Maw and Proxima Midnight, if he’s remembering their names right, technically are
, his squabble with his former teammates can wait until they have stopped the world from collapsing into itself to bother him over petty things.
He huffs, baffled, barely believing he actually just heard that. There’s an alien spaceship on the backyard. Oh
“C’mon.” Steve calls her, after they’ve watched the jet leave discreetly, barely making any sound at all as it took off. It flew beautifully, as all Wakandan jets do, and they all kept staring at the sky where it had disappeared into for far too long.
He simply doesn’t. He doesn’t think Shuri has any ill intentions, or that T’Challa might stab him in the back for no reason, but that’s exactly it. As long as they don’t have a reason. Everyone is always trying to look after themselves; but Steve is the one trying to look out for
He wipes the sweat on his forehead roughly, pulling at the skin with far more force than necessary, his hand trembling slightly from what Tony can see, even from far away. If he hadn’t known better, Tony would almost say he looks like he’s going through some sort of withdrawal, his body shivering from the need of a hit of whatever it decided it can’t live without, but no; This is stress, this is adrenaline pumping him full of a rush he has no outlet for, maybe even some rage, boiling inside him like a cauldron, spilling and overflowing with agitation burning hot, but never hot enough to dissipate the cold.
“You know that’s not what he means.” Natasha turns sharply, her voice chiding. Too bad for her that Tony doesn’t
Tony, wants to talk to him, to be sure he’s here and alive and safe and that it’s not too late for them, for the team. That they’re not beyond repair, and Steve is willing to do anything to prove to him that he’ll
” Bruce inquires accusingly, his voice sounding a little too distant through the speaker of the phone. “Is everyone else with you? Where’s Rhodes and Vision and
“Not just because—” Tony huffs, shaking his head and blinking slowly, trying to gather some composure before this goes way out of hand. This subject stresses him out. He’s incredibly stressed out. “He said it would be giving away our right to choose. The thing is – we shouldn’t have the right to choose if
Tony’s nerves are beyond any salvation, his skin crawling and prickly with discomfort – and if this is where he loses it,
“Be careful.” Tony nods, a little too rushed; Too casual and too worried, too dismissive and too pleading, always, always too much. It’s stupid. He won’t dwell on it, not now. “Call in if anything goes wrong.”
Next chapter, we continue with our emotional arc for this round - Thor, Scott, and few other surprises. Things are going to take a really aggressive turn soon, as the high pressure and the stress and the wild emotions running loose gets a lot of our characters very, very on the edge; And it'll all take us one step closer into finally getting some closure on a few subjects MCU has never given proper attention to, which I feel like it should be mended, for our sakes. Can't wait to see you guys there!
, he was safe, and Steve really didn’t want to give that up. He had felt like she was trying to push him away from Bucky again, like the entire world had.
“Not judging.” Sam reassures softly. “I won’t say a word until you finish. Just talk, alright? Put that shit out of your chest and explain it to me.”
Tony hides in the workshop. It’s a tried-and-true method, familiar and comforting, and might be the only thing stopping Tony from doing something he will regret, like confronting Steve about why he’s so uncomfortable at the mere idea of kissing Tony. Steve is not homophobic, Tony knows, because he’s in a team with Natasha, Thor, and
“I’m not ignoring it.” Steve exclaims, so angry he can feel how his face is getting hotter by the second, his pulse thumping loud as a drum in his temples. “I don’t have anything to say about them. I’ve said my piece. They are
. They’re like these… big, sentient trees, that only speak the same sentence over and over again, and you kinda have to guess what they’re tryin’ to say at first, it’s a pain in the ass. But he was my friend. My
Clint snaps his head in their direction, his hand flying over to the side, behind the couch, but he stills mid-movement when he realizes it’s them. He relaxes, his shoulders sagging, and he seems about to make an annoyed comment about Steve’s haste and lack of tact when the
The voice at the back of Tony’s head is all-consuming, evil and malicious, and it threatens to swallow him whole.
“I know.” Rogers replies, equally low, his voice rough even as a hushing breath. “Natasha asked me to give them some alone time.”
His goatee is a mess, unkept and dirty, with a disgusting shine to it as his face turned more and more greasy as the days went by and he never showered. There’s still a faint tinge of red in his lips and teeth, his left cheek is swollen, and he has dried blood on his temples.
For a long moment, there is nothing but silence. Tony feels like all the oxygen in the world is suddenly gone.
Steve had tried to reach out to Tony and explain himself, he had sent a letter who remained unanswered for
, so why… Why was she still fighting him on this? They can’t— They can’t fix this if they are fighting. Natasha, T’Challa, Tony, Vision, Rhodes… They all needed to be on the same side to win this. If they all… If they all had refused right from the beginning, this wouldn’t have happened.
“We have some news.” He blurts out, sounding only a little desperate, which is good, because it almost hides the absolute thunderstorm that rages inside him at the very same moment. Almost. But Steve is sure Natasha can see it in his eyes, the agonized relief, the shameful reprieve, “About the new Reactor.”
to you?”. Her entire face is distorted in disgust, and she’s threatening, she’s every bit of that scary android he thought she could be, and it’s all directed to him. “Why the hell would I lie to you, if trying to help you? What would I gain!? What do you think– I’m not
make work as a tool, he won’t be able to obtain unless they venture inside the hospital again and risk being seen.
“I was going to say ‘less murderous’, but sure, let’s go with that.” Sam huff out a laugh, throwing Steve a playful look, and Steve allows himself a weak chuckle, shaking his head in mocking disbelief.
“So Thanos sent his murderous children first, to get a feel of the terrain, and then came personally to finish the job.”
“No threat.” He repeats, but on his lips, it sounds like a question. Even so, the voice says it back again, confirming it, reaffirming it, over and over again until the words finally
“These past two years…” Tony coughs. “They were… a bit rough, I admit it, not my finest moments, but I thought – I thought we’d been doing good?”
“You’re not fine.” Tony says, and it sounds much more like an accusation than he intended to, but he can’t help it, not even if he can see how strongly the hurt hits behind Thor’s hard glare, even if he knows he shouldn’t pick up a fight with one of the only people Tony doesn’t have bad blood with from his original team, even if Thor doesn’t deserve this pain any more than any of them do.
He doesn’t even know if the others are here too. Rhodey never told him, and Tony never asked, like the damned coward he is. He was trying his hardest not to think about it until it was absolutely necessary, to be honest – and the
, to his face, and he hadn’t felt one ounce of regret. Steve was goading him to a fight on purpose. And Tony snapped back— Christ, he snapped back, and told Steve he was no better than a lab rat, and Steve felt so angry, because
“Oh God.” He hears Pepper’s voice, and the distant sound of repulsor boots activating and firing up, as she probably flies to join them.
“Boss.” FRIDAY interjects. “It has been reported they have set fire to abandoned vehicles on their trajectory. Agent Klein fears they might be marching with the intent of causing harm.
Steve sighs remorsefully, looking away for a brief second, feeling the familiar ache making itself known inside his chest – but surprisingly, it doesn’t hurt as much now. It still throbs, it’s still tender, but it’s healing.
that it’s difficult sometimes for him to reign himself in and have limits on knowing when to stop imposing himself on people – and he screwed that up with Harley, who became a teenager like all teenagers, the kind that hates having an adult constantly nagging at them about the details of their lives.
“Pep!” Tony screams, swallowing down his hiss of pain when he takes the first too-quick step in her direction, the adrenaline forcing him forward much faster and harder than he should, but he doesn’t stop. He climbs the small steps toward the center of the landing pad quickly, gritting his teeth through all the insufferable aches of his legs muscles, the heaving of his breath
“I know you do.” Barton acknowledges, only marginally annoyed. “I know you know. I’m just… I’m being a
and as awful as it is, they can’t be wasting that time being dragged by whatever whims the others may have or their convoluted ways of dealing with whatever fucked up hierarchy they assigned to themselves.
But we still have a few more to go - and if you've been paying attention, you'll know where this is going next ;) I am very, very excited to take us there, friends! I feel like we are due some sprinkles of controversy, don't you think?
that if he was still alive after all that had happened to him, there should’ve been a reason for it.
had been the one to say it, and Steve had rejected everything he said on principle, only half listening to his self-important and ridiculous speech, his web of lies and dreams of control.
“Well, I have an amazing ability to prioritize. Doesn’t mean I was super comfortable doing that.” Bruce points out, voice full of sharp edges, none of them with remorse. “And if you remember, as soon as I got the chance I ran.”
And when they are all there, all of them, together on the grass, trapped inside the gates, gasping and aching, they are ridiculous, they are a failure, because the few people still left behind from the riot run past them painting a miserable sight, the others who squirm on the floor from injuries or pains looking broken and abandoned; They should have stopped this, and they didn’t. They had one job, and they failed at it spectacularly, and it’s so painfully obvious now that
“My vision became true, Stark. I saw Asgard fall, both in dream and reality, and I was to blame, I saw Vision before he was created, I saw Stones we didn’t even know existed until that day.” Thor says, refusing to be persuaded. “It was more than a nightmare meant to wound. It was a
“Sure.” Tony concedes. “FRI, I’m giving Nebula and Rocket access to you. Work on getting some Sanskrit into your vocabulary and in their own systems too – do the best you can to help us crack those books as quick as possible.”
The remorse in her face is so raw and real that Steve’s heart aches to give her some sort of comfort, but he doesn’t know how. He cannot lie to her and say it’s ok, because she knows full well it’s not.
“I can send the ants beneath the rubble to look for anyone who might have been trapped beneath the fall. Lowers the risk of injuring agents by sending them into the debris.”
“He’s my best friend. I won’t leave him.” Steve says in a tight voice, reminding himself the person in front of him not only is just a child, she is also Wakanda royalty. He shouldn’t antagonize her. Even though something inside him desperately wants to.
this feeling – the feeling of being on the cusp of realizing something, but have it just out of his reach, his mind to stretching far enough to make an essential connection no matter how hard he tries. His brows scrunch together harder and harder the more he thinks about it, but the cloud of haziness doesn’t quit, just muddying his brain the harder he tries to scrub it down; Eyes burning so sharply with the dry feeling that accompanies the bone-deep tired feeling that he, irrationally, almost feels like he’s going to cry.
, huh, Tony? Even if they didn’t do something so drastic as destroying an airport, if they just helped someone on the street because it was the right thing to do, would they be arrested for it? And if they were, where would they be held?
She ignores him. In slow, methodic steps, she goes around the car, her boots not making a single sound on the pavement, until she disappears from his line of sight.
Some days, even the sound of the coffee machine beep gets on Tony’s nerves, he can’t imagine what a guy like Steve must go through.
Rhodey scares the living hell out of Tony when he suddenly walks in, the War Machine suit following close behind, and he doesn’t even hesitate in walking past Tony and into the elevator, all of them shuffling easily to allow room for the bulk of the armor, still leaving an open space right in the middle, a space Tony could easily fit into.
The hitching of his breath makes his lungs hurt, and his eyes burn. His brain feels like it will explode from the pressure in his temples. Everything inside him is tight, constricting into itself, collapsing, an imminent demise.
“Basically anything, got it.” Tony concludes. “I can give you access to FRIDAY and you can start by inputting some essential research parameters and that should save us some time. She can run some diagnoses while we’re away, even if her equipment is a little damaged from the loss of the network.”
But I have to warn you, this chapter might be triggering, because it mentions T'Challa's death more than once, and I also should warn you we are unfortunately reaching a point in the story where that will be mentioned recurringly for a while. It's poor timing, but there's nothing that can be done about it. While I trust all of you to respect the identity of the real man over the character, I'd be lying if I said one thing doesn't affect the other, and the thought of death, even just through a character can be very painful in a time like this. So please, be safe - know your limits, and take care of yourself first.
“That—” Tony stutters, shifting his weight from one foot to another, skin prickly with discomfort, and he turns to the side in a weak effort to hide his face. “Mostly. Yeah. But what did you want me to do? To just ignore the complaints of 117 countries and follow Rogers to wherever the hell he went just because he told us to?”
“You think you wouldn’t.” Shuri replies, disbelieving. “But we all try to please people we respect. He will do the same. And to be very honest, pleasing you is not a priority right now. He needs to be himself before he is anything else. Even to you.”
He tells himself it’s about the Accords - and in some ways, it is. It is, because none of it is actually isolated, the problems just meshing together like paints spilled across the table, muddy colors and cold water dripping over the corners, staining everything they touch. Exactly like that, they spill over the corners of the barriers he puts up, overflowing like a dam too full, drowning everything else until all he can see is the flood.
“How is that possible?” Sam says, indignant. “We had no choice. If we didn’t sign it, we would be forced to retire.”
“I don’t think he should be alone.” Tony says, truthfully, because he doesn’t. “So, I guess so. You and Natasha seem to be staying.”
Not that Tony had seen it much, with his own eyes – but Tony thinks he knows more than most. Because he had been there. He had been… He had been back at the Compound when Vision started to roam the hallways aimlessly, the books he found so interesting no longer hold his attention, to find him in the kitchen, staring at nothing, looking frighteningly human and not human at the same time.
“Easier to creep closer.” The man hums, as if he agrees. After a moment of silence, he asks instead: “You wanna know why I’m asking instead of just dragging you away into a cell, Mr. Jarvis?”
“Yes.” Steve affirms, and to his own surprise, he’s kind of annoyed he has to repeat it. He then realizes he truly
?” he replies, “I need number estimates of how much of the vegetation we lost, how much of the ashes have already gone up to the atmosphere, how much of it is in the water, soil samples of places that have already rained on—"
It’s not that Tony became reckless – any footage on the Internet will be more than enough proof to show that Tony's self-preservation instincts are the worst ever registered since 1970, and he knows it –, he had been reckless from the
"I'm sorry." Tony chokes, gulping forcefully to try and push down the odd feeling of swelling he feels inside his mouth, the strength with which the
like a taunt, but Steve won’t take the bait. He simply sighs and gives a minute shake of his head, a silent plea for T’Challa not to insist on it, and the king is kind enough to grant him this small mercy for now. With one equally minute nod, T’Challa changes the subject abruptly, uncaring if it looks too obvious.
“I’m sure he is.” Steve says, crestfallen, feeling so damn stupid for hoping he would hear anything different than he already has.
“Just us.” The man next to Carter says, in a quick, almost skittish tone, before taking half a step forward to make himself a little more noticeable. “Mr. Stark, I’m not sure you remember me, my name is—"
“Alright.” Tony groans, ignoring the way his arm trembles as he brings it to rest on his companion’s shoulder, taking in a breath to steel himself for whatever the hell it is to follow. “To the ship we go.”
Peggy Carter looks at him with a stare that could make army soldiers squeal immediately. Jarvis does not flinch.
Pepper’s eyes are full of questions, but then, her eyes drop to the blue glow of the Reactor in Tony’s chest, and understanding passes in a flash through her eyes before it morphs into concern. “With that?”
He deserved it, he supposes. It’s not like this just happened to him, unbidden and uncalled for, because Steve can pinpoint exactly what were the choices that he made that brought him here. He can count them all, and he can tell exactly where they overlap and where they turn into a goddamn snowball, just piling up on top of one another until it exploded into this mess. He’s not ignoring it anymore. He can think about it, clearly and unmistakably, and even if it’s not
He feels like he was a soldier for much longer than his records say; After all, being a soldier is not something that just stops when you quit the army. As it turns out, it doesn’t even
“Alright.” Bruce exhales harshly, his breath causing static through the phone, steeling himself. “I’ll see you at the Compound. But you got to
That’s how Steve feels when the people-watches. He wonders if Thor, who is beyond their comprehension of time, who has lived and will live long after they are gone… he wonders if he ever feels like that. Like he is always a bit detached, a puzzle piece that doesn’t fit perfectly, and he always knows he never will. Because the puzzle will change, with time. The pieces will fall apart and be replaced, the image they build together is going to morph into something else entirely, and he will always,
“I thought the guy was an open book?” Sam asks, resting his elbows on the table so he can lean closer, his tone full of curiosity and underlaying questions.
He tries to speak, but it comes out as a sob. He bites his lip, ashamed of the sound, and he almost breaks skin with how hard his teeth sink into it, nearly drawing blood. He wouldn’t stand to feel the coppery taste on his tongue again right now.
they might have left behind. Maybe Wanda’s powers were an unreliable source but if we can access other sources that had less…
“I’ll sleep fine.” Rhodey says, forcing strength into his voice. “And so will you. Alright? Call Pepper, tell her to come up, and sleep. I’ll see you in the morning.”
accused him to be, and he cannot find the strength to move and escape from it, after so many months doing exactly that.
Rhodey throws him an analyzing look. Something ripples beneath the surface of his gaze, something sharp and strict, but neither of them give out any clues of what it might be. Rogers nods, the same way Tony’s seen Rhodey’s subordinates nod at him after receiving orders, and he wonders, if only for a second, what could have possibly prompted this interaction when he has never before seen Rogers submit to Rhodey’s position in
“I’m just asking.” Steve says, trying to sound as nonchalant as he can, but it doesn’t help erasing the bewildered look on his teammates’ faces.
it was uttered in; And she gets up and starts rummaging through cabinets and compartments and cluttered surfaces, until she finds a big, checkered blanket dropped on the floor, and hastily grabs it and brings it back to the front of the ship.
“What is this?” Ms. Carter asks, her usually composed expression distorted into shock, absolutely flabbergasted. “Mr. Jarvis, I’m not sure I understood that right.”
"Vision—” She starts, and then immediately stops, because her voice sounds unsteady. After a beat, she starts again, and there is no hesitation in her voice this time. “Vision and I have been talking for a while. I mean… even before he came here.”
“I’m going to say something that’s very personal and very difficult for me and I need you to listen and not interrupt me for a couple of seconds, okay?” She says, dropping her gaze, as she also brushes a soft touch against Tony’s skin, trying to settle him, as she can probably feel the way he’s frozen still while trying not to tremble. “I wasn’t going to tell you this, because I
So Pepper Potts gets the chance to be the first on the hot seat this time around. Let's set up the stage with the most important issue: What is the thing that constantly strains their relationship? Is it Iron Man, or something else? Let's talk about it. To do that, the first thing we need is some comparative perspective: who is Pepper and who are the Avengers in Tony's life, at this point in time? What do they represent? What does it mean, if Tony chooses to act in favor of one over the other; to himself, to the side he picks, and to the side he doesn't?
Tony gives her a curt nod, bracing himself more firmly on her shoulders – and if he ends up pulling her a little closer as he does it, it’s merely a consequence of the strength of his grip, nothing else – and he says:
Tony doesn’t know how close Wong and Strange were. He doesn’t know if they were just co-workers, or if they were friends. How long they’ve known each other, how much they trusted each other. He has no idea. The Sanctum seems empty, and that is warning enough that Strange might’ve been the only person who kept Wong company in this place, both of them
, but they don’t. Not really. Rhodey and Natasha seem incredibly torn on what to do, struggling between the instinct to force them into some sort of compliance or step back in other not to spook them, as do Ross and Carter; Clint and Thor can only seem to stare with grievous, solemn eyes, no answer forthcoming from them.
He doesn’t want her tense like that. Not if she really came to help. Steve will gladly have her by his side, always, because Natasha is a good friend, even after a tough fight –
, when they are at an impasse. This, right here, is an important moment; It’s the moment where they’re standing on unsteady ground, with a choice, and they both are leaning towards different sides. It’s the story of their lives, honestly. Karma. They’re both pondering the option of allowing or stopping Pepper from joining them, weighing benefits and risks, and they’re both
Tony hadn’t even heard her come back. How long has she been here? And where did she came from? He doesn’t even know where she went while she was away.
“Yeah. Well. You can arrange your stuff however you like!” Tony enforces, but then, looks down at the box in Cap’s hands. “Is – Is that it?”
“You’re confirming that Howard Stark’s death was no accident?” Jarvis’ eyebrows shot up. “It was a HYDRA attack?”
“And we’re gonna get him.” Tony insists, as a compromise, as the only thing he can possibly say that it won’t overwhelm either of them – and he feels, right down to his soul, that it’s worth it, that it’s good, and that it’s
There are abandoned cars all over the avenue, crashed into nearby stores and into each other, letting out gusts of gray smoke into the air, smearing oil all over the asphalt and darkening the floor into a deep, thick, viscous black. The doors are all open, and left like that, as if a quick escape has happened. As if suddenly, all drivers just ran away, leaving everything they had behind. And they did. That’s exactly what they did.
But there is some information going around. Reporters have kept guard outside the courtroom for the entire duration of the interrogation, so every once in a while, there is some new detail being transmitted or some rumor going about. Some say it’s going badly. Some say it might be a positive outcome. It’s so hard to tell, because Steve can
But beggars can’t be choosers, he supposes. Not much he can do now, except sit here, with his chest attached to the ship like he’s a damned power bank or something, and hope for the best.
“I know. Honey, I know.” Tony pushes himself straighter and sits up, reaching quickly to grab her hand in his own and swipe a gentle caress across her knuckles. “But we’ve been trying, right?”
She’s right. But because Steve is not one known for pulling punches, nor for being very sensible when he’s so high strung as he is right now – as he’s been the last few… years, really -, he blurts his next comment the same way he would blurt an insult, or an order, or both; accusing and unflinching, eyes sharp on every detail, every tell, an even though he merely speaks, the silence makes it seem like a shout:
Why, if every time she warns him about something he ignores it, if every time she tells him Bucky clouds his judgment and he makes light of it,
“If he ends up destroying the Universe, they get destroyed with it, don’t they!?” Bruce argues. “I’d say that’s a pretty good reason to ask for help!”
“Both have their benefits, I think.” Steve sways his head from side to side, trying to be placating. “Well. I’ve made them. You can have some if you like, but if you want to leave, I won’t stop you.”
“If he can.” Steve says, a bit sarcastically, unable to stop himself. “If the Accords let him help at all.”
“And he hasn’t messaged back after that, has he?” She shakes her head in response. “It’s probably because ‘friend’ is not a category he recognizes. No speech pattern is adequate to use when talking to you, so he just doesn’t say anything.”
Thor’s father, probably. Someone equally powerful. And now he has a sister, who is just as strong? Who
Tony has never wanted him to just disappear or be gone from existence. He’d wanted many things, but never that. So yeah, he’ll give, he’s kind of glad Rogers is still alive, because Tony really doesn’t want this all to go down to one more regret he’ll add to his never-ending list, one more thing he’ll have to shove down and pretend it doesn’t hurt for the rest of his days, especially now that he can’t even count with the help of bitter alcohol to wash off the taste from his tongue.
Tony raises a hand, motioning them to stop, and they do, though out of relief or fear he’s not sure; Because they don’t relax, but they also don’t act like they’ve just been scolded anymore. They just watch him warily, like he’s a wild animal they’re trying not to provoke into attacking. It makes him feel like shit in a very specific way. He has to take a few deep breaths before he can decide what to say, because he feels so goddamn short-winded and tired, and it takes genuine effort to make his voice light and non-threatening.
“I made one for her.” Which is not a lie, but also doesn’t exactly answers Bruce’s question; And Tony thinks it’s for the best, because although he knows Pepper is more than capable of using it, and she will have access to FRIDAY just like Tony has, the armor had been a secret until a few hours ago, because Pepper had never been supposed to actually have the chance to
“You’ll have to forgive my curiosity” he says, equally calm. “But when one’s employer is assassinated, one tends to be wary of potential dangers.”
He shudders involuntarily, closing his eyes for the briefest of seconds, taking in a breath and forcing himself to stay grounded, just for a few seconds more, to take it all in.
“Dark energy is the first component of the universe. Before there was land, before there was even light, there was dark energy, and the elves who could control it. Our stories have a name for it – the void filled with magic. Perhaps our old myths have names for it too, from when humans still worshipped Asgardians like yours Gods. If the force of the stars forged by the encounter of fire and ice pulls galaxies and worlds together, the dark magic of the void is the thing that keeps them apart.”
Tony feels the burning in his eyes before he can stop it. He pouts and presses his lips together, in a frail effort to keep any wobbly words from spewing out carelessly, his head nodding along not in true confirmation, but just in an unconscious, desperate instinct to appease the wave of terrible, suffocating guilt that washes over him, so familiar, always so crushing.
“Are we going to be able to fight this, Tony?” Bruce asks, nearly pleads; Pleads for reassurance, for hope, for anything – and he doesn’t mean their quest for answers, or for any sort of special space metal, or Thanos. He means them, this rift that only seems deeper and wider every time Tony dares to look at it, unable to step away from the border, but also unable to take the leap. “Can we make this team work?”
“You give them life.” Nebula whispers, and Tony is so surprised that he twitches under her fingers, his eyes widening and turning down to look for hers immediately, but she doesn’t look back.
Pepper Potts. PA, friend, lover, CEO, ex-lover, fiancé. That's quite a ride. Honestly, how could I begin anywhere other than here?
Maria nods firmly, her eyes grateful, and she goes back to typing messages in a quick pace, practiced fingers going over the keys with confidence.
Normally, they could send in medical – but what medical? Who? There’s no one to call. The closest agent is Cameron Klein, the one who sent the distress signal; but who knows what his qualifications are. Does he have anyone with him who could help, any sort of medical aid? They don’t know. They have first aid kits here, the man on the floor assures them. They all know first aid, they bandaged the woman’s leg all by themselves, he points out. But that’s not enough, and they all know this.
“We’re gonna have to work something out with the agents.” Tony says, but can’t offer any more details or ideas on
“You can.” The man says confidently. “You still have people you can trust on the outside. Find a safe place and hide whatever you need there,
Nebula looks at him out of the corner of her eyes, and the movement is weird, as her eyes are almost solid black all the way through; But he can sense the motion, can
“I trust you.” Steve says. “And I trust Clint, and I trust Tony. It doesn’t mean I’m not worried… It just means
“How can they be composed of the same chemical properties, have the same energy systems, but act on different things?” Bruce questions, frowning.  “How can they know what to act on?”
Sometimes, it’s a virtue. He’s restless in getting results, in pushing himself up and forward, never letting self-doubt or hesitation slow down his steps, and that makes him valuable. As years go by and metal replaces wood, industries replace fields, and stories about flying cars and time travel and robots stop being about
” Tony says, with a jolt of remembrance. “London, 2013. That’s what you mean, right? Convergence? The huge wormholes in the city?”
“We were glad you came, Vision.” Steve admits, and he too means it, because Vision reaching out to them has given them more than just mere information. It has given them,
Tony had been so angry. He had been so angry, so out of his mind, and he wasn’t thinking, he’d wanted to hurt Bucky, he’d wanted to hurt Steve by hurting Bucky, and Steve couldn’t let him, he was innocent, Steve had already done so much to make sure Bucky would be safe, he couldn’t let Tony just—!
The portal. Barton. Wong. The books. The Gauntlet. Why is there so much going, and why doesn’t any of it make sense?
He’s sick of Tony acting as if he has all the answers and Steve is too damn stupid to understand them. And Steve is
. I made a bad call. When I heard about the Accords, and that Ross was the one proposing them, I just got into my head that they weren’t good. I saw what happened during the hunt for Banner from inside SHIELD’s sources, I knew what kind of stuff Ross could get up to. He was a piece of shit! I couldn’t even believe you’d be on his
satisfied and pleased, full of smugness, as if Steve had just given him the exact answer he was looking for. Steve doesn’t know why that is, but his mind is running wild with the possibilities, uneasy with the look the king is giving him and oh, did T’Challa think he didn’t consider Tony a friend? Fuck, was that it?
“Eight, then.” Steve nods, and completely ignores Tony’s wide-eyed surprise as he says: “I’ll let the others know.”
They have to fly slow. The Quinjet is barely picking up any satellite signals and the dust clouds are too dense, and they can’t risk a fast trip, no matter if the chances of them encountering another aircraft on the way are slim to none. It gets really hard to see. The Compound is far away from the center of the city, remote, for both protection and comfort; But now, even the false sense of peace that the isolated location usually brought is broken, the empty, vacant spaces between the trees is glaringly obvious, it shatters the illusion, it brings the cold, harsh reality in.
?” A voice calls, loud and surprised, and both Tony and Nebula startle terribly, but where Nebula keeps her posture stiff and her hands ready to reach for her weapons, Tony’s entire body sags, and the feeling that bursts into him is so bright he can’t even recognize it. The relief floods him so intensely he feels he could cry, all warm affection and deep, intense comfort in knowing she’s still here, she’s survived, and he hasn’t lost her just yet.
The rain soaks them to the bones, cold and unmerciful, making them shiver and tremble where they lie, and even though it falls to gently ease off the burning flames from the torching trees, to ease the grass from its blazing trail, the freeze of it causing their breaths to come off in puffs of mist; They are swallowed by it, not even the darkness of the night wide and consuming enough to hide their shame, their remorse, the glaring, ugly truth that
“Every place had its own motivation for it, sure, but the PR sure was having a field day going through all the threats and less than polite letters we’d been getting for the past five years.” Tony huffs, sarcastically. “Are you worried about hidden agendas too, like Cap?”
Tony spins around, surprised, and looks at the Stark Industries mug in Steve’s hands so intensely that Steve can only extend his hand and offer it to him, because he’s honestly afraid that if he doesn’t, Tony might try to bite him to take the mug for himself.
Nebula makes a huff so soft it’s almost inaudible and averts her gaze. It feels like it’s on purpose.
Steve’s breath comes out in a shudder, half rage and half exhaustion, his eyes stinging so damn much, he is so
“Which means the cube still has some limitations, even if it’s alien. It could open the portal, but it couldn’t hold it open without collapsing. Gravity would force it to close itself. If we can cross-reference Selvig’s notes with your notes on the Reactor and your father’s notes on the
There’s a moment of questioning pause, and then, they all start looking around to find each other’s gazes, confusion in their eyes; because save from the four of them, no one else knows about Bruce’s initial prediction yet, because it all got so lost with Wong, and Strange’s books, and the riot, and literally
in him insists that the safest hands are their own. Really ironic that this piece of him might play a part in this, considering that he had affirmed, with such certainty, that this man had died in the ice. That someone else came out. Hell, maybe he did. Maybe this is the man he became, the man who refused to back down even worse than before, the man who had his everything, the good
Tony dodges them and their pitiful stares, uncaring, unable to accept their sympathy, and marches back into the common area to find the others talking anxiously, exchanging rapid words and wild hand gestures, with his breathing ragged from distress and hands closed into determined fists, steel resolution solid in his spine.
He’d just meant to lead them to the workshop. But there it is, in Thor’s hand, extended to him, and Tony fumbles in his steps before his body can properly obey the command his brain gives it to
What he doesn’t get is this part. He doesn’t get it. How is signing the Accords taking responsibility? He can see why Natasha signed it. He knows her, probably more than he knows anyone else on the team, even Sam, and he can imagine what was her logic when she picked up that pen and put down her name. Natasha is adaptable. She can thrive no matter how terrible her circumstances are. Accords or no Accords, Natasha would have found a way to succeed, as efficiently as possible, with the least damage and maximum speed. She would’ve played the Accords like a child plays with her toys. She would have reaped all the benefits she could, and she would have dodged all restraints and idiotic rules like ballerina, so elegantly and neatly no one would even realize she’d done it. But she’s one of a kind. Nobody else had her skill or her ability, so she couldn’t expect anyone else to follow the same line of thought as she did.
“I thought I could offer some help, in any way I can.” Thor raises his shoulders a little, a shadow of the innocence and pure heartedness he used to wear on his sleeve still there, still softening him at the edges, and it does ease the ache in Tony’s chest, if not by making him feel better, by making him at least glad
It’s always painful, to realize the rope is giving. That it’ll unravel and drop them both, if they don’t retreat. The weight is too heavy. Crushing guilt, unspoken secrets, too much conflict. An entire universe on their shoulders. It always comes down to this. To a point where the pressure becomes too much, and whatever weaving of connection they tangled between them is not enough to hold them together, as Tony sinks in, as Pepper tries to pull him out and Tony just keeps being pulled down by forces he cannot shake.
“Yeah, I’m done here,” Tony answered. He’d left his suit jacket on the back of a chair and rolled his sleeves up his forearms. The sunglasses were hanging from his breast pocket. He’d obviously combed his hand through his hair more than once, giving an air of light dishevelment.
He finished putting the tray in order. He didn’t move away from their embrace. It felt far too good to be held and to be held by Tony at that.
With a tender lick against Steve’s upper lip, Tony leaned back lightly and Steve was ready to follow but Tony just changed direction and pressed his lips against Steve’s neck – first. Then he kissed Steve’s right shoulder, his clavicle. Steve sighed, every place Tony touched him left aching more.
Maybe that was in itself already cheating, at least according to the Bible, but Tony wasn't a very religious man, nor Pepper a religious woman. They had an understanding about flirting with others, though Tony had an inkling that what was going on with Steve might not have fallen under flirting. He ignored it.
On the other hand, he was so turned on – and God he could feel how turned on Tony was – that waiting seemed like cruelty. He’d certainly waited too long before, maybe the only correct choice was to seize the moment.
Steve stood up and went to the sink. He had both of their come on his skin. “It’s what you wanted?” Steve asked as he wet a couple of paper towels and started to wipe himself clean.
know, don’t I?” Then he seemed to think it over in his head. “Deflowering Captain America – who’d have guessed? Jeez, if my dad was alive…”
Steve was pulled back to reality when Tony’s hands found his ass and pulled their hips tighter together.
They both fell silent. There was still something unfinished about their conversation, the reference to what happened before hanging still in the air between them.
As the trail of kisses was leading down, Tony’s hand came up against his shoulder and gave a small nudge.
He couldn’t wake Tony up, though. They hadn’t done anything, they didn’t quite have that kind of a relationship even if they’d flirted about it.
It had been uphill ice-skating the whole way into the HYDRA plant, even Natasha losing her humor. Tony had wanted to bring an untested droid-army to play, a plan which Steve had emphatically belayed, not willing to risk the mission or the team with an unknown factor like that in play.
Thing was, he had kinda gotten used to it, the crackle of electricity between him and Tony first buried under anger and then distrust. It had been nice to acknowledge it, the evening before, but he hadn’t completely realized how potent it had become.
Tony groaned. “That’s true, but let’s be real here, someone could have come down anytime the last fifteen minutes and turned around and left with no doubt what’s going on in here.”
Steve marched on. ”In a few seconds I will turn around and give you a supportive hug, and I trust you haven't smothered yourself with your pillow by then.”
Now Steve witnessed Tony swallow, take a step forward. ”I can't say I did,” he confessed, his voice low.
Had it only been his personal feelings, he probably would have let it go, but this was about the team, too. They couldn’t avoid each other and be effective in the field at the same time.
There was a lot to what Tony’d said, so much so it left Steve reeling, heart beating fast. He turned around. There was a hint of embarrassment in the look on Tony’s face, but mostly he was meeting Steve’s gaze head-on.
Steve wasn’t generally speaking very much into glad-handing with the rich and famous who wanted a picture with a superhero, but, alas, needs must. They were invited to the awards dinner by the mayor and they needed to keep a good relationship with the city and its elected officials. And, as Tony had pointed out, the public liked seeing them show a united front, posing for pictures on the red carpet as a team.
When Fury cut his connection to mark the end of the meeting and they started to roll out of the room, Steve asked Tony to stay behind.
Tony leaned down to fervently mash their lips together, like he couldn't get enough. Steve welcomed it, wanting nothing more than to stay in that moment where their passion bordered on aggressive.
He hadn't felt too good about himself after that, about the choices he'd made and the reasons behind them.
Tony stood up. ”Are you afraid I'm going to use it against you? Like you owe me something? That I'm paying you so you can't disagree with me? Is that what you think of me?”
Steve had the impulse to kiss him, but it wasn’t quite clear he could. The last time had been agreed upon, now all bets were off. Also, he’d promised himself no more risks with public displays of affection.
It took a few days until the next time he really saw Tony. Steve had seen him passing by more than once and had greeted him in the most normal manner he could, fully aware that it wasn’t suitable for a team leader to hide from your teammates.
Steve knew they weren't talking about Bucky taking out taken girls once upon a time. ”I doubt myself all the time. But not in this. I don't doubt you.”
It wasn't, of course, going to last. Tony gripped their cocks together, adding needed extra friction. Steve guided their rhythm with a hand plastered on the small of Tony's back.
“We took care of each other,” Steve said. “We shared our bodies, our wants. I know what the skin on the back of your neck tastes like and I’ve had your laughter reverberate inside my mouth. Frankly speaking, you giving me a hand, while nice, is not what I repeat inside my head about that day when I go to sleep.”
After a few thrilling laps around the Chrysler building, Sam had dropped Steve off and Steve had joined the rest of the team. Tony had commented under his breath how the wings were now tested for shipping precious cargo.
His vow to himself lasted about two days – the amount of time it took until he saw Tony again. In his defense, Tony kinda initiated it.
”To be fair, I didn't expect his beard would grow so dark, I was confused – okay, point taken. Listen, I know I have a difficult relationship with him. But I'm not waiting for him to –  to notice me, or whatever.”
This was dangerous. Tony was engaged. He didn't think he would have ever tried to catch the eye of anyone else in a relationship, but after the Accords their friendship had been in shambles and this was the first truly positive type of encounter they had had. It was hard to resist.
It was released, all right, but it was too short and poorly made and it dropped all the way to the ground. Steve frowned as he heard Tony curse. Well. It wasn’t that bad. He jumped down and landed without a hitch.
“Looking good, Cap,” Sam greeted him, grinning. He had a good reason to grin, too, seeing how sleek the new wings looked.
He would have been quite sure that everybody else had forgotten about Clint’s weird research if he and Tony wouldn’t have happened to be taken as prisoners a week later and put into the same cell.
”Well, sure,” Tony agreed. ”But it’s not like anybody would believe that – it’s not like they’d believe it themselves. They’d just make the insinuation for the sake of it, to hit their click-bait quota.”
Tony waited for a moment before joining Steve running laps around the practice mats. Sam was right. It was fun to witness an enhanced person using their enhanced skills, especially when there wasn't a mortal danger making it hard to concentrate.
He let the pants be for the moment and instead pushed the shirt up. Tony broke off the kiss for a moment to sit back and peel the top off completely. They locked eyes.
“Your perfectly perky butt hasn’t prevented you from being the record-keeper of near-deaths around here,” she drawled and yeah, she was onto him.
Steve wouldn’t bet on that but what did he know? It wasn’t important anyway, not when Tony’s revelation had other implications.
The man came to stand next to him and began to look for the right angle. Steve shared an amused look with Tony.
Steve fell silent, lost for words. Tony's engagement announcement had thrown him off. The silence dredged on.
He cleared his throat. “In no particular order: the definition in your arms, how confidently you carry yourself, your mouth, your humor – and that what you’re sitting on.”
Tony stood up and looked at Steve consideringly. “Wanna go to SHIELD? We can grab burgers on the way back.”
“Listen,” Steve said when Tony seemed to have the sense not to go into detail about the issue at hand. “I’ll very gladly pretend I never said anything. It doesn’t mean anything.”
Steve coughed, having timed his consumption of the Whiskey poorly. While he wasn’t exactly surprised,  Tony’s frankness had caught him off guard.
“I think your regular suit fits the bill just fine. And anyway, I think you should stick to truth and justice and righteous speeches. Leave the subterfuge to me.”
When Steve got to the rooftop, most of the team was already there sans Bruce and Thor: Thor was away and Bruce just typically slow to arrive. Steve joined the group, Tony and Sam fitting the wings and Clint and Nat offering commentary.
It was almost a relief how perfectly they fit together like this, how good it felt. In a sense, this was what he had been waiting for, an affirmation from Tony that they did belong side by side. He didn't even want to think about how long he'd waited to have this with somebody.
Tony got his oh-no-you-didn’t face on, which inspired both relief and dread in Steve. Relief, because it meant Tony wasn’t that pissed off, anymore, liking it when Steve sassed him back, but also dread because it meant Tony wasn’t far from doing something unadvised.
Tony shuddered, jerked them faster and then, with a half swallowed cry, came. Tony's hand slowed down but Steve was pushed over the edge by Tony sighing his name over and over in his ear while he was still riding his high.
“Were you ever tempted?” Steve asked, genuinely curious. Even if it made sense to him in a way, Tony wasn’t the type to give much thought to expectations and social norms.
A sound of a barely there gasp broke Tony out of his abstracted monologue. Turning his head he saw Bucky Barnes standing in the doorway, a distinct deer-caught-in-the-headlights look on his face.
Undecided but leaning towards the more urgent need he had, he used the grip he still had on Tony’s behind to grind their hips together.
“Waiting to get a car that’s not in your name so you can get caught by the speed cameras. Nobody’s going to believe if I try to tell that it wasn’t
“You wouldn’t? It’s pretty rare to hear someone you know and actually respect to give you that kind of feedback.”
Steve didn’t see Tony for some days after that. It was fine. It could have easily been just part of their normal rhythm: Tony often disappeared for a few days if there was no avenging to make. Hell, all of them did. Even if the tower was their base of operations and they had apartments there, most had lives outside, too. Clint was often away long periods of time as was Thor. Bruce was usually around but forgetting himself in his work. Steve and Natasha were probably most likely to be sharing a dinner, both of them having stopped working directly under SHIELD.
Getting the shirt off was difficult with their position so Steve laid Tony gently on the table and straightened up to strip it off himself.
Steve straightened himself. He forced himself to look Tony in the eye. ”I didn't want us to meet for the first time after what went down in the middle of the battle. I wanted to make sure we are okay enough.”
“I don’t,” Steve said and he wasn’t lying as he didn’t know for sure was Tony more concerned that it was him Steve had named or that he liked men. Probably the former, he thought, knowing what he knew about the upper-class moralities in the 2010s.
do it? Build a drone that emits smoke?” Tony was playing up the affront, but it was nice, Steve thought, to have the banter back.
Steve did have more to say, but a road sign signaling they were nearing the city brought him back to reality.
”I don't want to know,” Sam said. He was short of patience because of some family drama, Tony remembered. He crossed his arms. ”Has he woken up, yet?”
When they kissed again they still weren’t touching by much else than their lips, Tony on his hands and knees above him. Steve slid his hands up Tony’s thighs and slipped them underneath Tony’s shirt. He gently squeezed Tony’s waist before letting his hands find their way a bit lower, thumbs pushing down the waistband of Tony’s sleep pants.
Tony smiled slyly. ”If I film and put it up on YouTube, I can guarantee it will make a lot of people's day.”
“You hurt?” He asked pointing at the blood on his shirt from where he was sitting on the crew bench. Natasha had joined Clint in the cockpit. Thor and Bruce were in New York, alerted, but not part of the pick-up crew.
That seemed to have cleared the air between them, Steve was glad to note. He saw more of Tony around the Tower and they had easy conversations. On top of that, the mission to the Ukrainian Hydra base was executed to perfection. No injuries, no casualties, no damaged property or gear, and the smokescreen worked beautifully, disabling the three laser cannons defending the lab and barracks built under old ruins so they could just barge in.
Tony was a genius, so he was a very self-aware guy. He knew well all the things he wanted to do when he looked at Steve – he had wanted to do them for years. The only thing was that he had never thought there would be the slightest of chances to even
Before Steve had a retort ready, Tony continued: “Having said that, if I ever go down the mad scientist route and you do have to subdue me, please use your tongue.”
Walking in Tony saw Steve actually using the kitchen to make food – he was stirring something at the stove, there were chopped vegetables on the side, waiting to be mixed into the whatever-it-was Steve was making.
Steve stepped directly underneath the hole. “Come on, Tony, I’ll give you a boost,” he said, crouched and made a hold with his hands to give Tony a leg up.
Tony’s hands moved to stroke his stomach above the clothes. Steve pressed a bit more tightly against Tony and – okay, this was becoming far too hot far too fast.
”It's not just plain friendship between you. You want to win him to your side, to like you, to respect you. I think you want a part of him, as big as possible, and in return, you want to give him a part of yourself.”
“I’ve learned to never expect organizations like SHIELD give power or potential power away voluntarily.”
He pushed Tony to lie down, and due to Tony’s insistence, went down with him. He supported himself above Tony with his arms, their faces only a couple of inches apart.
“Yeah, yeah. Full marks, Rogers. Your first time. I’m impressed,” Tony said. Steve glanced at him only to notice that Tony, still sitting on the ground, had his arms crossed across his chest almost in a protective manner and he was seemingly avoiding looking at Steve.
They didn't get a lot of working out done, but Tony got half an hour's worth of footage from several angles of Steve beating up a punching bag (in reality about five different bags), landing aerial kicks into it and finally hitting it hard enough to send it flying through the air and slamming into a wall.
He took the bedding and threw it on the floor. In the next moment, he pulled Tony against him. He let his hands roam down Tony's back, all the way down to his ass. He squeezed it possessively.
Sam looked at them both and frowned. ”What? Don't tell me you get uncomfortable being called friends. I thought we were over this already. I got over you throwing me in prison, I'm sure you've gotten over Steve beating you up, after you, you know, tried to end his boyfriend,” he addressed the last part to Tony before turning to Steve. ”And I know you care for this guy.”
He wasn’t sure but it seemed somebody had something to say to him. Steve kept his eyes closed. After all the years he’d been involuntarily sober due to the serum he was damned if he let somebody disrupt the warm buzz that was welcoming him into sweet, numb unconsciousness. Thank God for the Asgardians.
”I should be wearing pants,” Steve said quietly, but Tony seemed to hear him even through the kid's long-worded apology since he gave Steve a knowing look.
Steve wasn't completely satisfied with that since he went to rummage in the freezer. He came up with a popsicle. He offered it to Tony.
Washing his hands,  Tony glanced at him sideways, ”It never really made any sense, anyway. The electromagnetic radiation wouldn’t stop at skin. And can you imagine what a cancer risk a skill like that would be?” He asked as he turned to the paper towel dispenser. When he found it empty he looked around the white and sparse room before grabbing the front of Steve’s dress shirt.
Steve gulped. Why was it so easy to be like this? He hadn't even thought to start anything, this time.  Would it be like this, always? In the middle of a mission: 'Watch your back', 'I'd rather watch your back'? Would team debriefings with them become unbearable for others?
To that, Steve raised his eyebrows. Tony heard what he’d said and, if Steve wasn’t mistaken, got a bit flustered.
It was casual enough that it might have been innocuous, but from Steve’s point of view, it was nothing but. Tony never sat next to him or got really close to him unless he was mad. Then he was all hands.
Tony looked like a deer caught in the headlights, as the saying went. Steve was mildly embarrassed, but he disliked demeaning and distorting the truth. It didn’t have to mean anything overtly romantic, but how Steve saw it, they had shared something special, something good, and the very least they should have let it strengthen their friendship.
“You’ve made me kind of curious about what it’d be like. With someone like you. And if I’ve understood correctly, you are interested in me but not necessarily interested in something serious. So, what I was wondering was, if you wanted to make a night out of it sometime? We could go somewhere else if you wanted.”
To that, Steve had actually several answers, but he knew it might be too much to be honest about the more physical characteristics that made Tony attractive to him.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said. “I always have the wrong timing with these things, the wrong place, the wrong person. I genuinely hope this doesn’t come between us.”
“I don’t know if you understood but it’s not limited to just Avengers and even so I’m sure Nat doesn’t mind if you choose her.”
"It didn't really work for me. Felt ridiculous to try to knock people out with a patriotic Frisbee. You know."
Surprised and not wanting to cause a scene, Steve went with the motion. With their faces barely a couple of inches apart, Tony pressed his lips to Steve’s cheek. Thing was, the angle was such it was basically the corner of his mouth where the kiss landed, their lips fitting partially together.
Steve felt a prickle of unease and wondered for a moment if the booze hadn’t hit him, after all. While he trusted himself to catch Tony, 100 %, it was dark and he might catch him awkwardly enough to cause some minor injury. It was too late to back down, though, Tony being on the bottom of the ladder. He didn’t jump immediately as Steve had done but instead lowered himself further so that his legs were in the air and hands grabbed the final rung.
Steve made an encore of putting the glass back down, this time turning his back more where the door was. And Tony.
They got to their destination in one piece and in relatively good time. This, despite getting briefly stuck in the midtown traffic and especially despite Tony giving a running commentary about Steve’s driving, complaining first about too slow then too fast, then worrying about the paint job, and then, on the freeway when Steve definitely broke more than one rule speeding, calling Steve crazy. He had been grinning, though.
Looking at Tony looking at him, it made him throb, very literally so. He wasn’t sure how long he could take this slow tease, them not even touching, just looking.
Steve did his very best to pretend there was nothing wrong, but when Marvin Gaye repeatedly told them to
”Rest assured my vision for you doesn't end in an ill fitting robe with a nice view. No matter how nice the view.”
Tony scoffed. “I can easily sabotage it at SHIELD premises. And what are they going to do with it, anyway?”
Tony crossed his arms. ”Look, I know it’s absurd. It’s the kind of thing that bored teenage girls write to each other about but what actually happens only in one of the millions of alternate universes – and let’s be real, even then one of us is probably a woman – and I hope it’s you, the
At one point the team was ribbing him, teasing him about his choice of words for some Hydra underlings earlier the day, during the mission.
Tony was confounded. “But all the things you said? Where the hell did you learn to speak like that?”
Didn’t mean he didn’t put a little more thought to what to wear than he had any other time. He had a pair of very well fitted black jeans he had not worn once since an enthusiastic shop clerk had insisted he try and buy them. He paired it with one of his regular Henley shirts to not seem too obviously like he had dressed up and also because of how well the soft gray material highlighted the lines of his upper body.
Bucky gave him an unimpressed look. ”Firstly because of how Stark acts around you, but that could be just his crush on you. I didn't think it was reciprocal until Parker didn't want to bring Captain America's shield to one of his idols, Captain America, in case 'Mr Stark was there and they were acting really weird'.”
Tony frowned. ”Well, yeah.” For a moment it seemed like there was something else he might say but he finished with: ”The car’s probably here, we should go.”
He wanted to say something, tell Tony how good he looked, how hot it made Steve to see him like this. Before he had any words formed, Tony rested his right hand on Steve – on his
Steve found it kinda funny, too. Among other things. Also, he had noticed Tony alluding to his father. Steve had gotten the impression that Tony was troubled about his father, but looked up to him all the same. Loved him, all the same. He’d have gladly told Tony some of his stories about Howard when he was young, from a time nobody else alive remembered, had he ever felt like Tony was receptive to that sort of thing.
"I haven't exactly always performed inside the law, but I have been able to keep my modesty intact."
"I suppose it can't be anything too flattering if you haven't said it out loud. Or maybe that's exactly it, it's too flattering, you have been embarrassed by what your mind thinks of me really and that's why the silence. Let me guess, "Brown eyes", no, --"
“Too imprecise, we’ll have to cut their visibility as close as possible. But a small drone, maybe on the ground. Small enough it’s hidden by the terrain.”
but to him Tony not having been with men if he mainly liked women was understandable. He’d himself wished a few times it wasn’t men who most often caught his eye. After waking up in the future and having seen how the law and societal acceptance had changed and realizing he had very little to lose anymore, he’d decided to stop actively hiding that side of him. But he definitely had been hiding it, before.
Also, they watched each other, but surreptitiously, sneaking a glance every once in a while, hoping the other wouldn’t notice – or hoping they would.
Steve froze. It was dark in the room but he could see Tony looking almost as shocked as Steve felt. ”What?” He asked, voice considerably less confident from before.
Not that Steve was that old himself, but the guy couldn’t have been over 25 and he still had that youthful, gangly kind of look about him.
A small buzz to relax but not so much his inhibitions would lower. Those he felt he needed too much now, with Tony having sat down next to him on the couch, his knee brushing Steve’s every other minute and his arm resting on the back of the couch, his fingers just some few inches from Steve’s neck if he happened to lean back.
”Having been aware of you most of my life hasn't exactly helped,” Tony said. The way he said it, almost easily, told Steve there was something else. It wasn't his connection to Howard that got Tony defensive around him.
Instead, the soft and sturdy cotton felt amazing against his bare skin: his senses had been much more sensitive after the serum, touch as well as his sight, hearing, smell, and taste. He sighed as he got underneath the covers.
Steve didn't take the hint. When the coffee was ready he continued what he had started to say: “I didn't mean anything with that. I didn't mean to talk about my naked body.”
Tony leaned back on his knees and did just so. Steve got up a bit, leaning against his arms to get a better look of Tony completely naked.
Steve would be reasonable this, he decided. He couldn’t expect anything from him. He’d give Tony his space and not make a big deal out of it.
Tony winced. ”Talk about what?” He wasn't quite sure if Pepper was amused or angry which never bode well.
Steve gripped Tony between his legs again and maneuvered him up into his embrace. Surely he’d never tire of kissing, Steve thought as their lips met once more, their bodies now flush together. Willing them to be as close as possible, Steve hooked his left leg around Tony.
So it was mostly Tony. Or maybe it wasn’t even Tony, maybe Steve was projecting: he wasn’t sure if he knew anymore what was normal behavior from Tony and what wasn’t. Maybe he’d always watched Steve guardedly and maybe he’d always sat up a bit straighter every time Steve walked into a room he was in.
Steve felt his cheeks warm a little bit, mostly from being so transparent. But, he figured, if she was willing to play along, he might as well use the opportunity.
“Alright,” Tony laughed, surprised, “this works. Slightly undignified, perhaps, but I’m not complaining.”
Steve cleared his throat. “The last party, what happened in the kitchen? After I went back to my rooms, I waited for you.”
In the aftermath, with Steve limping from the brutal beating he’d taken, Tony had taken a look at him and scoffed, hurt. Steve spoke Tony well enough to interpret the thought:
Basking in the afterglow wasn’t an option when Tony was still urgently in need, rubbing hotly against Steve’s thigh. Tony had all his weight on Steve now so it was difficult for him to get his hand on Tony. Instead, Steve made the executive decision to maneuver them into a new position, on their sides, him behind Tony.
Steve felt his cheeks heat. ”I don't know if it would have helped.” Then: ”I suppose we could have tried.”
They had a meeting with most of the team, Fury updating the latest from Hydra and giving them the heads up about a potential mission in Central Europe. All went well except that Tony hadn’t looked at him once during the whole time.
Pepper sighed. Her mouth was turned down. ”Every time it's gone bad with us I've felt like your other life has consumed you. The hundred Iron Man armors, the team, trying to protect the whole world, almost giving your life over and over again.”
Steve had finally gotten out of the med bay and to an apartment that was kept for him in the newly refurbished compound. Steve was sure someone had pointed Bucky to a guest room, but he had decided to stay at Steve's rooms.
With his hands already in place, he pushed Tony’s pants down a bit, giving Tony the hint to get them off.
It wasn't only because it was Tony, Steve knew when he felt a thrill go through him, when something hot and exciting unlocked inside him. This human side of him that had wants other than fighting injustice and punching stuff was so often kept under wraps. To let it surface was not only heady, it was addicting.
Steve knew Tony was vain enough that he wanted to ask the obvious question but due to current circumstances, didn’t.
Bucky shrugged. ”So what? We both know there are a lot worse things than a little unfaithfulness. Hell, it didn't really stop me even before the war.”
Frowning, Steve decided not to comment on that. Instead, he went on with his business: “I got a report from Fury about SHIELD mission to the Hydra base we visited last week. Cleaning it up they found the electromagnetic field generator tech they used to disarm you. They offered to give you a look at the SHIELD premises.”
That double-entendre had Tony give into a laugh. ”I don’t know, I’m sure I’ve managed in a lot worse condition.”
”I can’t go back there like this,” Steve finally said, looking down at his ruined shirt after Tony was done. He straightened up and decided that he wasn’t going to try to tuck the now wet shirt back in.
As if knowing he was the object of Steve’s thoughts, Tony opened his eyes. “You’re staring,” he said, voice still rough from sleep.
“Well,” Steve finally said. “Keep me updated about the smoke drones, I’ll prepare the rest of it with Nat.”
”What for? You wanna have a smoke?” Tony asked but was already scanning the electronic lock on the door with his phone.
Steve knew he would not want to get caught with his pants down and there was the thought in his mind that maybe once was enough for Tony – he’d specifically asked for a night – so he wondered if it wasn’t better to try to make the plans Tony had mentioned: go somewhere else, together. Assuming this was a one-off Steve wanted to make the best of it.
Steve laughed. ”Your turn,” he said, but didn't wait for Tony to get it done.  Instead, he pulled Tony up, then he grabbed the hem of Tony's shirt and helped Tony out of it. The boxer briefs followed quickly suit.
“No,” Steve answered, easily enough. That was what he had told himself, anyway. Tony was just one more in his line of unattainable crushes: growing up chronically ill, mouthy, and being more often interested in men than women meant he was great at not letting his feeling develop.
Steve had faced some hard decisions in his life, but most of them still seemed to pale next to stopping what they were doing.
Tony looked decidedly unimpressed at this but knew better than to waste time. He stepped on Steve’s grip and put his hands on Steve’s shoulders.
“My nipples?” Tony repeated. “Out of the two of us, you’re the one with pecs gods envy. And speaking of which,” Tony said and leaned forward, took purchase of Steve’s waist and slowly licked across Steve’s left pectoral and then closed his lips around the nipple.
“The way you look, Tony,” he continued, “the way you smell, it makes my blood hot, short-circuits my brain.”
He already had a song he would use. One of his better ideas had been the purchase of several AC/DC song rights.
”This is very unlike you, endangering a teammate!” Tony called back. He was already climbing, though.
”It's more fun together – well, it's actually torture with this guy, but you can always challenge him to show off his skills.”
Tony had presumably called the car during the 15 seconds he had had his phone in his hands so it wouldn’t probably take much over ten minutes. They were better to leave immediately.
”I have a suit of armor. You definitely don't have to take my bullets for me. Or alien lasers, as it is.”
. It was a battle to choose whether to say something sappy or something teasing. The latter won, in the end.
It was good they were not moving, waiting to be let out of the SHIELD compound, so Steve could turn to give Tony a long and incredulous look without fear of crashing.
”You remember me? But I'm not wearing my suit!” The kid's voice got higher to the end of his sentence.
Tony grew silent, staring at him. Steve, feeling self-conscious and bared, turned to mix the vegetable into his sauce.
So, even when alcohol had very little impact on him in regular doses, he’d chugged a glass to brace himself for any passive-aggressiveness Tony might dish out to him.
Thor had his Asgardian concoction with him and Steve graciously accepted a shot of it in his beer. He’d decided that was his limit, though, remembering still too well the last time and trying to melt into the balcony floor.
Tony was completely immersed in the projection in seconds. “Yeah, we’re not flying in. See here? That’s a goddamn laser.”
”Did you inform Natasha that we took off?” Steve asked after a long silence, realizing belatedly that their escape hadn’t perhaps been the most cordial thing to do for the rest of the team.
Steve pondered that for a second. “Not now, I don’t think. Not for this. I’m pretty sure I’m right and it doesn’t really matter that they don’t trust us: that’s in their DNA. They’re right not to trust us, anyway. Our interests aren’t always SHIELD’s interests.”
”I can guarantee you I wouldn’t be using that skill to take a look at your junk,” Steve said dryly as Tony turned around, hands re-fastening his belt.
The hole was wide enough they could fit both at the same time. He didn’t think any further but grabbed Tony by his side and lifted him off the ground and over his shoulder. Tony exclaimed in protest but Steve jumped down without further ado: he took the impact with his feet but couldn’t quite keep his balance and turned around to fall on his behind so he wouldn’t accidentally slam down Tony first.
“No – “ Tony hurried to say. “Steve,” he sighed. “If I’ve ever been tempted by someone, it’s by you. And not just because of what you said, but because believe it or not, I like you. I do find you attractive, too.” Dryly, he added: “And let’s say I have noticed the at times explosive chemistry we have.”
“Just around the corner,” she guided. They made quick work getting through what seemed a little-used storage area: it had obviously been easier to break into than straight to the prison level without getting noticed.
Tony moved his glare from the supersoldier lying on the hospital bed to the shield in question and back again.
“I can’t believe this. The last time you’ve driven was during the war,” Tony said. “And now you want to drive a Bugatti Veyron.”
”Don't tell me you haven't even once wanted to peel him out of his garbs and polish his gun, or whatever you called it in the army,” Tony snarked. He wasn't angry at Barnes, but he was annoyed his hospital bed -confession had been disrupted.
but held his tongue. When he'd done some serious soul searching after the whole Russian fiasco, he had realized that it wasn't really Barnes he was mad at. It wasn't Barnes that killed his parents, he knew that.
The bathroom, even the men’s, had a bit of a line to it. Tony scrunched up his nose when he saw it and stopped in his tracks.
All the ideas and schemas he had about relationships or dating or just whatever didn’t easily apply to him and Tony. It was hard to see them like – like anything else than what they were, already.
Knowing it was going to be mostly a flight show, Steve didn’t put his gear on. Casual, like Tony had said.
Tony nodded to himself. “Yeah, we never talked about it, but it wouldn’t have been like him to bother himself with people’s romantic interests. It was about what you could do, not who you wanted to do.”
”Just asking,” Tony said, which was obviously a lie. ”I suppose it got a bit handsy on the red carpet, wouldn’t want anybody to get the wrong picture.”
It took maybe a couple of hours in silence before a loud crackling alerted them. Above them, the plaster of the ceiling started to crumble until a clear neat hole was created. Natasha was crouched at the edge of the hole, peering down at them.
Pepper had been correct proclaiming he had always been like this about Steve. Before Steve had suddenly flirted with him, he had just compartmentalized the more sexual aspect of it.
”Such flatterer,” Tony remarked, which was nothing close to what Steve had feared Tony might say, but then Tony slid his hand up from Steve’s left shoulder and cupped his head to pull him closer to Tony.
Tony shrugged. “Very rarely. Men in my business, not really the sort of people you want to put yourself in a vulnerable position with. I mean, I’m sure I’ve probably made out with a guy in some party somewhere, but that’s probably true to most men, straight or not.”
The stop at a burger joint couldn’t have been more excruciating for Steve. It seemed absurd that waxing poetic about Tony had seemed like a reasonable idea to him. Not a big deal. Tony had asked for it, what could go wrong. He knew it wasn’t just his uncharacteristically bad judgment, he had wanted to tell Tony. If for nothing else then for having someone to know he could feel like this, that he wasn’t just orders, training and fighting.
Ten minutes into the red carpet and Steve could hear Tony tell gleefully to a reporter how much he enjoyed working with a team, standing in line, getting ordered around by six-foot-two tall statue of muscle and rules.
As he rushed to his workshop, Tony realized he hadn't cleaned the espresso machine, but decided to let it be. Steve would probably do it.
”It's a different thing if it's for the team. I don't have to punch through stuff to be effective on the field.”
“I hope you didn’t plan this or I swear to God, Tony,” Steve said, mostly exasperated but also slightly annoyed.
He wasn't well versed in kissing – or anything else they were in the process of doing – but every move of Tony's lips, every sweep of his tongue brought forward an answering reaction.
“A techie preferring brawn over brains, no wonder SHIELD’s in such disarray,” Tony muttered but took the picture.
“Because I can’t stop touching you,” Steve confessed, and to run his point home dropped a kiss on Tony’s cheek.
Their lips moved slowly together as they tentatively mapped how the other responded, how this worked. They didn’t touch with any other part of their bodies, the soft yet insistent drag of their lips the only contact.
“Okay,” Tony said, carefully, as if surprised Steve acquiesced so quickly. “Just to be clear, this,” Tony said and gestured between the two of them, “might be new to me, but I didn’t mean I want someone to indulge some sort of experimentation on my part or, I don’t know, guide me through the homosexual experience.”
Suddenly, Tony laughed into their kiss. Steve broke it off and nuzzled against Tony’s face and made an inquiring sound.
In the end, it seemed Tony wasn't so unfazed by the sleeping arrangements his joking around made one think. Instead, he first sat down on the side of the bed, his back to Steve, pretending to check something on his phone. Steve decided to let him get used to the situation in peace even though he was tired and wanted to just grab Tony and force him to sleep.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Steve asked, feeling himself mentally gearing up for a confrontation.
It was three days before the next time Steve saw Tony. Now that he’d admitted his feelings for himself, he had allowed himself to think about Tony a lot more often.
“What?” Tony asked as if he didn’t know. “He was alright. I think. Not that I’m an expert in that, but from the small sample I’ve gathered, spending time in the workshop isn’t a deterrent for you.”
Steve lifted his hips when Tony finally got to pulling the pants down and off, together with the rest of his clothes. He was aware that lying naked on the cold, hard floor of the workshop had not been on his agenda, but that was a distant thought when Tony was staring at him with heavy-lidded eyes.
Tony saw Steve falter for a second, probably thinking back to what they'd said. Tony himself was a bit concerned: he was actually trying to be as neutral and appropriate as he could.
Smoothly, Steve climbed down the ladder. When he came to the bottom step he kicked the release to drop the lower part of the ladder.
“Your face is handsome, Tony. The masculine lines of it betray something more precious: how expressive your mouth is, how enticing the color of your lips. You don’t need a lot of imagination to be caught in thoughts of kissing them.”
Going to meet Steve wasn't because he was planning to cheat on Pepper. If that was the case, he would have ambushed Steve somewhere private. Instead, he wanted to live a few more moments with just the possibility of having Steve close to him in a way he had always categorized as full on day dreaming.
Tony snorted. ”Now and then,” he said. ”Especially when you keep your hand on my lower back for the better part of the evening.”
The upper level seemed to be a gallery of some sort, with pieces whose style Steve couldn’t quite place hanging from the walls. Relatively new, then.
“Come on, you must get tons of compliments. And I’m sure if the public’s opinion isn’t good enough for you, you can ask Clint to name the rest of the people who chose you.”
Tony started to regenerate the broken flesh tissue with the cradle. He put his other hand on Steve’s shoulder to keep him still. His fingers pressed against the crook of his neck. Steve swallowed. This wasn’t really an optimal time to talk about this.
They looked at each other in the eye as Steve, with Tony’s cooperation, repeated the motion. Then they were kissing again. Steve felt Tony’s hands start to hurriedly unbutton Steve’s shirt. That was fine, he decided. He re-draw the line at full nudity in the privacy-less room.
The second Scotch Steve just sipped. ”Not really. I’ll get slightly intoxicated if I drink fast enough, but it doesn’t last very long.”
”Shut up. I hadn’t expected – ” he trailed off, not sure how to put it into words that the tenderness – even now – was something he didn’t know would happen so easily.
“Never done any of it with a man,” Steve revealed, a lot more amused by the confession of his inexperience than he’d have thought possible. “Or a woman.”
He turned around in the small space between Tony and the counter to finish loading the tray. That left the ball in Tony’s court.
It was the first time Tony visited the kitchen since building the damn place. His sudden craving of tap water was somewhat motivated by the fact that Steve was in the kitchen. Alone.
“So. See you around,” he remarked, finally. Tony said his own goodbyes before turning to look something from a screen. Steve left.
“Why are we stopping?” Tony murmured and – unfairly if you asked Steve – went on to kiss Steve’s neck.
Tony put down his tools. This was going to take a while. ”A start of a series? In part two Thor will electrocute the poor mangled punching bag to the beats of Thunderstruck.”
When Tony didn't continue Steve asked: ”Is it because I knew Howard?” He didn't turn around in case it was easier for Tony to talk when he wasn't looking at him.
“Based on the measurements I’d say its reach is about a mile, not more. And that’s assuming it’s not cloudy.”
Tony was simply enticing. Of course, Steve had known Tony was fit since his raggy band shirts and perfectly tailored suits didn't leave that much to the imagination, but it was different to have an explicit permission to observe.
When the bartender poured him the drink he threw it back in one go, grimaced, and ordered a second one.
“Yeah,” Tony said and went on to ground the beans. Maybe he shouldn't say anything anymore. He put the ground coffee into the portafilter, tamped it down. He sensed Steve was going to open his mouth again and quickly switched on the machine.
Steve hadn’t been strictly truthful when he’d said he’d only kissed one woman before since he’d been kissed a couple of times by surprise, but the point still stood: he had no practical experience to speak of. He remembered Bucky tell him to just take it easy and enjoy it if he ever found someone, so that’s what he tried to do. He took his cues from Tony, relaxed his mouth and let his instincts guide him. He knew it was probably nothing too thrilling for Tony, but to feel Tony’s mouth against his own, to know how Tony’s lips tasted, to breathe the same breath – it went to his head, the heady feeling electrifying his whole body.
When the end credits rolled Tony stood up and Steve felt a pang of disappointment. He’d hoped maybe another film. It was late but it was easy for him to stay up. He could understand, though, that Tony must have been tired.
”Great,” Steve muttered, though not really bothered other than having to explain to Natasha tomorrow what Tony had meant.
They had already decided to stop with the pre-dirty-talk. After Pepper left he would scrap the dozen or so suit designs in red, white, blue and see-through. He would conquer this.
Tony smiled but without any mirth behind it. “Nobody’s ever said anything like that to me. Not even close.”
“I’m sure half the blood they take to develop better pain medication for me or whatever is to develop better sedatives to knock me out if needed.”
”You ready to talk now?” Bucky turned in the office chair to greet Steve at the same time revealed the computer with a YouTube page opened up. Steve could guess what Bucky had been watching.
Tony was obviously still disagreeing about that so Steve tried to slow it down gently, landing a few short kisses on Tony’s lips before pressing his lips against Tony’s forehead.
“It's great. Just fine,” Tony hurriedly said. Then: “I meant the thing, not your body, it's – ah, hell – “ he downed the espresso in one go to shut himself up. It felt like it burned his
“I like how soft your hair looks, how you haven’t colored in the few silver strands. It makes you look distinguished – alleviating the impact of your ridiculous beard for all that it’s impeccably maintained.”
Who the hell was he kidding? It was a big deal for him. He wanted it to mean something, he wanted it to be serious.
They sat in silence for a couple of minutes before Tony straightened up. ”Ugh, I need the bathroom.”
The surround sound audio system, combined with the fact that they were both silent, meant that the song felt like a background music to a movie scene – Steve could imagine too well what happened next in this particular film.
”Here, I found these oh – ah just, just around the corner?” The kid's high pitched announcement sliced through the electric atmosphere in the room and Steve straightened up in a hurry.
“So, I have this problem,” Tony finally said. “See, I’ve had countless of what you might call relationships, entanglements, one-night stands, whatever. Most of them not very memorable and not only because chances are that I was drunk, but there were some people who meant something. Then I thought I’d met the love of my life but she couldn’t completely accept the life I lead and turns out when push came to shove, I chose the superhero gig instead of her.”
Pepper seemed to realize that since she said more placatingly: ”Just how much you minded that he wasn't in your corner during the Accords business. How much you talk about him, complain about him... I swear on Monday you think he's too blond, on Tuesday he's not blond enough.”
Steve didn’t exactly forget anything about the night, but he’d dismissed the memory of Clint’s interrogation as unnecessary to retain.
Somehow the mutual indecisiveness made Steve feel a lot more comfortable and he found that he really didn’t want to leave just yet.
”I – I don't know if that's a good idea. I might have sneaked a look at your chart and you should not leave the med bay until tomorrow, so I don't think I can help you with those. Mr Stark might not let me come here anymore if I helped you take off. Though to be honest, he didn't exactly let me come here in the first place, but I couldn't help but wonder who they were keeping here.”
Steve nodded. ”Yeah. I like touching you,” he explained and immediately made a face at how it sounded out loud.
Tony seemed to find another wrinkle to straighten, except now it was clearly a caress, his thumb tracking the underline of his left pectoral.
“I liked the part where you called them the ‘spineless laboring underneath indifferent masters to bring everybody else down to the same level of degradation’,” Natasha said. “Not that they give two fucks about what you say, but it’s the thought that counts.” She offered her bottle to toast against Steve’s in celebration.
“I can’t honestly say,” Steve said. “I never witnessed anything and he was known for chasing ladies. But he did keep a very mixed company, you know. Throwing parties for artists and the like, musicians, actors and actresses. I’m sure he was open-minded about it, even if it wasn’t something he was into.”
”I’ve known a lot of old wealthy guys who cannot get it up for anything else than the promise of a free meal.”
Steve turned to look at Tony, curious that the man hadn’t just blurted out whatever was on his mind.
Tony tightened the grip of his legs around Steve. “You are a master martial artist, I’m sure nobody thinks your main strategy would be to use your tongue to subdue me.”
“Noted,” Tony murmured, mouth mostly occupied. His hands were once again making their own path across Steve’s body, touching him with familiarity already.
Tony’s physical presence, his smart mouth, his well-fitted suits, but he hadn’t thought what having sex with him might be like. Had he, he supposed he might have assumed it would have been accompanied by a running commentary, laughter.
As Tony was wiping his hands on his shirt, Steve stared at him with a very unimpressed look but that only increased the self-satisfaction radiating from Tony.
The air was thick enough with tension to cut with a knife but Steve soldiered on. “You are richer than I can understand, but your body isn’t pampered or artificial. It’s molded by real work. It has a carnality about it of which the thought would keep me up at night if I let it.”
“Well,” Tony shrugged. “Building these would be expensive as heck. On paper – sure. They’d fry us if we got close enough. But do they actually work? That’s a guess I’m not going to make.”
Tony searched his face and he must have seen Steve was serious for he closed his eyes and said: “Oh, thank God.”
On the fifth or so press of his hips, the bed made a squeaking sound. Again so on the sixth. The seventh time Steve slowed down and raised his head to watch Tony.
Later, after he had made a speech to commemorate a late philanthropist who’d set up a center for veterans, he returned to the table to see Tony was missing.
Steve considered that. That wasn’t the impression he’d gotten, but on the other hand, they hadn’t spent that much time together. The interest he’d shown for Steve’s body had seemed mostly scientific, but of course, that wasn’t much to go by.
Usually, with smaller changes to gear, they’d just test them during regular practice, but sometimes with a bigger development, the team used it as an excuse to come together.
Tony looked parts shocked parts unhappy. It took a moment or two until he said anything. ”Are you saying that all that frustration with the damn Accords – instead of fucking it up we could have fucked it out?”
”What do you mean by that?” Tony interrupted. While he didn't as a rule like when people talked over Pepper, he also disliked being told what he was like, what he was
Steve was pretty certain the upper level was off-limits for the party, but he didn’t object to the change in direction. The two shots had given him, for the time being, a slight buzz, and sneaking off to restricted sections with Tony sounded weirdly appealing.
That wasn’t necessarily the reaction Steve had expected, but he’d take it. Tony was glad, that was a great sign.
Tony agreed to let it go. They drove in silence for a good ten minutes or so, but this latest turn in conversation still echoed in Steve’s mind. What had Tony been thinking? That he has to find Steve somebody so he’d what, forget about Tony? He wanted to express that it really wasn’t a big deal, but somehow doubling down on it didn’t feel like it would get the point across.
“I'm sorry about the video – and about this popsicle,” Tony rushed to say. “It won't happen again. We won't happen, ever. I know that now.”
”Both,” Steve said honestly. ”But to be fair, I don’t really see myself going on dates with women, either. That was a part of the world I left behind. And even then barely.”
Steve seemed to think it over. "I don't think you've ever been on first name basis with anyone. Nickname basis, now, that's a different thing."
In contrast with the hurry they both must have felt, Tony took his time. He watched attentively every time Steve’s chest rose with his breaths, every inch of skin that was revealed as he pulled the zipper down.
Tony hadn’t said much else than directed them to the diner. Sitting at the booth with their orders, Steve concentrated on eating to have an excuse not to say anything. Tony chewed his food slower, looking deep in thought.
”I have several fantasies that disagree with you,” Tony said. It wasn't meant to be any way seductive. Then he seemed to realize that this wasn't really a subject that he should try to harass anybody, even Steve, with. ”Listen, I'm sorry. That was a line crossed. I can sleep on the floor.”
Anyway, it was that comment which gave Steve the courage to wait until the living room was vacated by everyone else but Tony.
”Well, we’d have made out in the upstairs lavatory we sneaked off to, for one. Or just had sex there, and then gone our merry ways.”
Not with a thought but with only a need Steve let his legs open to get Tony fit between them. He squeezed his thighs around Tony’s hips so that they pressed tightly together where it suddenly mattered the most.
Tony interpreted the silence the wrong way, as an affirmation to what he thought. He sighed again. Then, with a slight touch of teasing humor: “Was it for me? The jeans?”
“Thing is, I thought I knew if not everything, then at least most everything there is to know about love and attraction, the things adults do to not feel so lonely.”
When Steve felt Tony’s hands start to really wander again, he glanced at said table to make sure it was mostly empty and took a hold underneath Tony’s butt to lift him up to sit on it.
If Steve had needed any proof it had been a bit too much, here he had it. He had let his mouth run and made this whole thing a hell of a lot more serious it had any right to be taking into consideration it began with Clint having an immaturely high competitive streak.
Tony made a face then snorted. ”Compared to what? Aliens dropping down from the sky? Not really. How these things usually go? Yeah, I suppose.”
”Yes,” Steve said, nodded. He turned around and got all the way to the door before he felt a small window of chance in the gloom that had descended on him.
Tony was saved from coming up with an answer to that by Sam Wilson making himself known in the doorway.
During the award dinner, they were all at the same table, Steve sitting between Nat and Tony. All seemed normal, Tony acting almost like the former aloofness or even the kiss never happened.
That was a non-sequitur if anything was, Steve thought. Maybe Tony was uncomfortable with the quiet, after all.
”Anyway,” Steve continued. ”They’d probably speculate where Captain America sneaked off with Iron Man and to do what, seeing that they already have picture evidence of you getting up and personal with me.”
“You too,” Steve said. He could have helped Tony, but to watch Tony sit up and in a slow manner peel off his sweater held its own merit.
“Is this the part where you say something saccharine about the angle of my clavicles?” Tony asked teasingly.
”I can't remember because Steve gave it to me so damn good I passed out,” Barnes interrupted him, eyes flashing with a challenge. ”You could even say that he fucked my brains out.”
Steve didn't sleep much so it was safe to assume Tony hadn't possibly slept at all. ”What time is it?”
Steve knew he’d probably made the wrong choice: Tony’s tech usually did work, perfectly, tested or not and it wasn’t like he hadn’t had to make risky bets during missions, before. But though the mission had been exhausting, the odds hadn’t been against them, there hadn’t been a need for desperate attempts. So with Ultron and the cluster-fuck that had ensued from it still in mind, he felt like it was his responsibility to see that nothing like that would happen again. He knew Tony thought Steve didn’t trust him, but it was more that he was trying to protect Tony from the what-if-it-went-wrong.
“And I get that not everyone gives elaborate speeches as their side job,” Tony went on to explain, “but I... I’m 45, for God’s sake, and you’ve made me question if anyone’s ever really wanted me, if anyone else has watched me that closely and decided that they wanted it.” Tony grimaced. “I don’t know how to put it in a less self-centered way, but well. It is self-centered.”
But he did his best not to let it show so that when Tony appeared in the middle of the breakfast hour to invite the team to a prototype test run on the roof for Sam’s new wings, dress casual, cold drinks served. Steve smiled in the most neutrally way he knew how and accepted the invitation.
As he’d hoped, he’d barely gotten the beers out of the fridge when Tony appeared. He didn’t say anything, at first, just watched Steve gather the drinks and snacks on a tray.
Steve complied. He sat down on top of the bedding. Before Tony could get any ideas Steve pulled him onto his lap. At the contact he couldn't but arch up, becoming lost in the heady feeling of rubbing against each other.
Back at the tower, in the garage, Steve felt like it was the last moment to say something to save the situation, but he figured that opening his mouth had led him to this in the first place. Shutting it probably was the best way forward. So he merely said goodbye and retired to his own rooms.
Steve shrugged. “I just realized how I’m going to be thinking about this, all the time. About you in my bed, what we did last night, what you whispered in my ear at the end.”
”Steve, I have a lot more money than one could possibly need, even if they are bankrolling a superhero team. And what's more, I'm a capitalist. It means that I sit on top of a pyramid. I invent stuff, but the money comes out of other people's work.
After finishing their ten minute run Tony was sweating already. Steve who had probably done half a marathon or something, seemed barely out of breath. Steve went on to hit a bag. Tony decided to stretch.
An hour or so later, after Steve had gone through current matters with Fury he went to pick Tony up from the lab.
Pepper wasn't really wrong, of course. Tony should have been able to forget about the fact that in a different timeline he would soon retire to his rooms where Steve would be waiting. Also, retrospectively, he did realize the video had been a bit over the top, especially since it was he alone who had made it, not a cheeky, young PR team. Even they probably wouldn't have made it three minutes long, branding it with their own favorite music.
Tony stood up. He was restless and obviously found it difficult to put into words what he was feeling.
Perhaps for a dramatic effect, Tony waited for a beat and then said: ”I think we would have really good sex.”
He continued: “You aren’t very tall, but perfectly proportioned all the same. There’s power in your upper body, you can see it from your neck even if you are wearing a full suit disguising the definition you have in your arms, chest and stomach.”
It had been something, Steve had thought. A man with an energy reactor embedded in his chest to prevent shrapnel from his own bomb entering his heart, glowing in clear white-blue, a light in the dark. Steve had thought about the unintentional symbolism a lot, once.
He appreciated that Tony gave him the chance to choose to continue ignoring the unsaid between them.
He heard warning bells distantly in his mind but felt he had to say this one more thing. “You are stuck up about how smart you are, but my God if the intelligence shining from your eyes isn’t magnetic. It makes me want to just look at you. Have you look at me. Being with you, whether next to you or opposite you, it fires me up.”
He was already half-way there when he felt Tony’s hand curl around the back of his head to guide him down.
He pulled Tony up, pulled him so he was in his arms, now skin against skin. Their eyes met and no words were needed. Steve didn’t think he would ever get tired of the intimacy of kissing. Tony devouring his mouth held an impulse like trying to merge their souls together.
Steve waited for a moment before he jumped so that he got a grip on the edge of the hole. As he started to pull himself up, the ceiling edge broke down underneath his other hand. He lost his balance momentarily and wondered if he was going to fall but someone gripped his arm and started to pull him up.
He sat up and glanced at Tony. Tony was sprawled on his stomach, on top of the covers, his top having ridden up to reveal his bare lower back.
Tony took his seat on the co-drivers side. He waited until Steve was on his side before fastening his seat belt needlessly pointedly. Steve gave him a wide smile. “So, how does this start?”
Lewd joking could have been the side-effect of a more relaxed and happy Cap, now that he had his Bucky (Tony knew it wasn't his place to feel jealousy, but he couldn't quite fight it). When Steve bent down and exposed himself to Tony neither was laughing.
“Because I’m afraid the second we leave here there’s a mission or something. And I’d be far too wired up to concentrate and I’ll die an embarrassing death.”
”Will you take your clothes off?” Steve dared to ask. Tony complied without a comment and Steve considered it a victory that he didn't have to coax Tony to curl up to him. The uncharacteristic silence worried Steve.
Steve sighed again. “I won’t mention it again if you don’t want to, that’s not a problem. But I really wish you wouldn’t avoid me because of it.”
He hoped it was the right answer, the whole situation being more or less like a hellish job interview: not only did you not know what they wanted to hear, you weren’t even sure what it was that you were applying for.
Looking at Tony now, out for the count on his stomach, the sheet covering him only up to his hips, Steve wondered how was he supposed to continue like before when he knew what was waiting for him, hopefully, at the end of the day.
Tony’s legs and Tony was looking up to him with one of his roguish smiles. And there were the hands again, grabbing Steve, pulling him closer.
Later, they had mostly retired inside when the sun had started to set. The wings were a success based on the enthusiasm Sam clapped Tony’s shoulder with when he finally had the patience to land.
He would have given a lot to escape the event tonight, though. They’d finished a mission yesterday to a bad note and the team was still feeling that – Tony especially was still feeling that.
Maybe Tony saw the urgency for he – he leaned down to kiss Steve on his cock. Gently, he let his lips trace the length of it. When he reached the top, he
A silence. Steve wondered if this had been it. He took another glance at Tony to see him looking back at him. Steve raised his eyebrow. “You have something on your mind?”
It left the team in high enough spirits that they convened in the evening to share a few drinks together.
Steve was impressed by how quickly Tony had cleaned up: he was wearing a suit, his hair was styled and Steve could smell the whiff of cologne mixed with the clean smell of a recent shower.
Steve followed curiously Tony scrutinizing the blueprint this way and that. He obviously didn’t understand enough to get what Tony saw in it, but watching him work could be entertaining.
Not sure if it was him or Tony who initiated the change of position, Steve found himself getting on the floor. Knowing the cement floor wasn’t comfortable, he went on to lie on it and had Tony lower himself on top of him.
This was bad, Steve thought. This was more than just some horrible, innuendo laden verbal sparring. This was past flirting, even. He needed to stop it.
Steve didn’t know whether to look down or at Tony’s face, but when Tony’s breath started to hitch on every stroke, the latter easily won the competition for the best view.
”What? Oh, Jesus. Really?” Tony grumbled. He came to the balcony as well, though, and closed the door behind himself.
“You planned this, didn’t you?” Tony asked when they were let in through the vehicular gate to the SHIELD facilities.
Steve sat down on the table. “Could we conceal the jet with a smokescreen? If we drop it from high enough?”
Not really in the mood to talk about before-and-after, he continued: ”You don’t wanna date me, do you?”
Steve wondered if Tony had meant it in a wider context than just the position they were in but didn’t ask. He was too comfortable for any serious talk.
He took the box of coffee beans Steve offered him. He made sure their fingers didn't touch. “Oh. I repaired your suit. It should hold up to aliens a bit better now.”
It was far easier now to just circle his arm around Tony, take a soft but firm grip on Tony’s cock. Tony fit against him just perfectly. They were snugly pressed together from knees to shoulders, Tony’s head resting on Steve’s arm.
“That’s – that feels really good,” Steve explained and for a wild second had the thought that was it possible to come from this alone? It would solve the problem of nudity, at least, to come in his pants, he thought a bit manically.
He was about to go first and be there to catch Tony, but a gun was fired just then. He and Tony both crouched reflexively.
”I'm not your commanding officer,” Steve said to get some time for himself to think. He felt like he was on the brink of doing something possibly stupid, a decision he knew he shouldn't rush, but one that he was afraid had a very limited time window.
What Steve parsed from that was that Tony still hadn’t out and loud asked because not only did he assume Steve would say no, but he himself wasn’t sure he wanted a yes.
“It wasn't, but it's fine now. Even though I guess after saying that we will probably fight some intergalactic love god and get kidnapped together and wake up in a – love lair with pheromones – “
”Steve Rogers!” Tony said, pretending, at least he thought so, to be affronted. ”I'll have you know I'm engaged.”
what Tony had said, but before he could deny it, Steve opened his eyes. Groggily, he asked: ”Excuse me?”
It felt dangerous, but well, Steve rationalized, Tony had very explicitly asked for him to elaborate. And he wasn’t, weirdly enough, embarrassed.
“By saying something off the top of his head, apparently, tore that certainty, that feeling of contentment, to fucking pieces.”
Steve couldn’t really fathom why: they hadn’t been on a mission since the kidnapping so it was unlikely Avengers-related.
Steve took a hold of Tony’s hands to stop him toppling the beer bottles. For a lack of a better place, he guided them to his waist and stomach so that Tony was basically hugging him from behind.
“Steve does have his way with words,” Thor mused. Steve could feel Tony’s gaze on him. Unable to resist, he turned to look at him. It was a kinda mistake since the heat in Tony’s eyes sparked a reaction in his body, a tingling feeling at the back of his neck, low on his stomach.
”Excuse me,” Tony said and gestured first at the tiny bed, then at them in their undershirts and boxers. ”There's not a saint in the world who wouldn't have impure thoughts about this situation and your turn of phrase.”
Alright. “Yes,” Steve said. He wasn’t ashamed and he wasn’t pursuing Tony, but he did get that it was a bit unexpected.
Tony gazed around the room, finding the glass forgotten in his hand to fixate on. “I was... content. Content that whether I ever found anyone again, whether me and Pepper might get back together again someday or whether this was it for me, I had had my share. Right? But then this man – I’m talking about you, by the way,” Tony said the last bit like an accusation even if he didn’t raise his eyes to meet Steve’s.
”I don’t know if you did – I,” Tony started but lost his words as he took Steve in, the sheet pooled on his lap.
Tony shifted in his place, something obviously in his mind. Steve was glad to see he wasn’t so closed off anymore. Steve let Tony gather his bearings in peace and went to get the bottle from where Tony had left in next to a sink in the little workshop kitchenette. He’d normally have asked permission before pouring himself a glass but thought it best to stay silent to give Tony room.
Tony blinked. Looked at the specs and back to Steve again. “Well. Yes, basically. Of course, there’s not going to be clouds below a certain altitude, so getting close enough would still be a problem.”
Steve turned to look at Tony, slightly exasperated. “Well, I didn’t know but I didn’t assume either way. Alright? It’s not my business.”
“Captain Rogers,” the tech started. “I, ah, I’m sorry but would you mind if I –” he said and held out a phone.
“Steve,” Tony said, half in greeting, half in surprise. This time he hadn't known Steve was in the kitchen. This time he had made an effort not to think about Steve.
Whether they’d been left together on accident or on purpose, it was a given that they were probably spied upon. Steve knew it and Tony knew it and they both knew not to talk about the whereabouts of the rest of their team.
Two hours later, sitting on his bed alone, and he was very conscious of how wrong he’d been about that. He’d thought he’d been pretty obvious: he’d joked to the team that he had to go practice his speeches. How else could Tony have interpreted that than as an invite?
Tony, of course, noticed Steve was hard against his buttocks and pushed seductively back against him. Steve tightened his hold of Tony, putting a stop to the movement. ”It's alright,” he whispered. ”Sleep now.”
With those Tony didn’t dawdle – a blessing, since Steve wasn’t sure how long he’s patience would have lasted.
Steve decided to spell it out. ”We should quit dancing around each other like this,” to make his point he gently removed Tony's hand from his chest.
Having relaxed his hold, Tony, most likely disoriented by the fall, climbed off him clumsily, almost kneeing Steve to his face.
Steve supposed he could say no and have this be it. Backing down from his words didn’t sit well with him, though, and he supposed they both knew how unlikely it was Steve had made it all up in the heat of the moment to what? Crack a joke? Had that been the case it was painfully obvious he didn’t have a career in comedy.
”No. No, whatever it is you are suggesting. I just don't want to make old mistakes. This is me trying to think about you more.”
Steve's pulse was speeding, Tony's confession had completely flabbergasted him. He'd never guessed that behind Tony's reservedness was a sexual attraction. He didn't know what to think. It wasn't really – unwanted, he realized. Tony's professed interest in him didn't make him feel uncomfortable.
”You alright?” He asked – Tony had groaned with the impact but it had sounded like out of surprise more than anything else.
Steve closed his eyes and let his head fall back. If you could save a moment, to live in it as long as you wanted, this definitely qualified as a candidate. He knew there was more to come – hopefully – knew this was in sexual terms relatively tame. It didn’t matter. What mattered was the exhilaration of getting to know one another like this, getting to know Tony with his eyes dripping with warmth, surprise and joy: getting to know himself like this.
“Great,” Tony mumbled. Steve prepared mentally to carry Tony if need be. They had to be quick now, their escape was likely already noticed.
Tony had looked up at that and the way he swallowed was a sign that Steve’s sartorial choice hadn’t been in vain.
He leaned his head back, trying to break away from the kiss. Tony didn’t really let him but instead followed him. As a last trick, he licked against Steve’s lips, trying to entice him to continue.
How could someone deny that? Steve sure as hell couldn’t, so he once again kissed Tony. Whether it was his serum-enhanced ability to learn physical talents fast or just the inspiration Tony provided, he found he was really getting the knack of it.  Tony seemed to agree if his bit off moans were any indication.
”Fine. Call the ride,” Steve ordered. He shrugged the tuxedo jacket off and untied the bowtie before taking off the ruined shirt. He put the jacket back on over the undershirt.
Steve got the hint and curled his hand around Tony’s cock, wet with Steve’s come and both of their sweat. Tony thrust into his grip, urgently, with his mouth open.
But now? It meant something. Steve only wished he knew if it was an effort to get friendlier or if Tony was coming on to him.
Steve was tempted but thought it was better to play nice with them at the moment. Hydra had been scourged out of the organization and it didn’t seem like an immediate problem. He shook his head. “Not now, but thanks.”
Having given himself permission to continue for a little while longer Steve put the thought of slowing down on hold and took everything Tony gave and then some. When Tony lifted his hips up to press against Steve but fell short a couple of crucial inches, Steve helped him the rest of the way by getting his right hand across Tony’s ass and pulling their lower bodies together.
Of course, it was likely Tony had just reconsidered. There were dangers to what they were doing, Steve did understand that. Things had already gotten difficult once because of it.
Steve hadn't yet moved, but every passing second made him conscious of the burning need to grind against Tony, to nail him into the bed.
Thinking about it later Steve wondered if he hadn’t screwed up a bit. It was a clearly 1940s strategy to pretend he’d never said anything at all and seeing how Tony had acted weird for several days after their brief kidnapping he started to think maybe he should have tried to have a real conversation about it instead of vague promises that there was nothing there.
Tony was having a hard time not to comment on that. Steve went on: “Maybe I just feel bad creating more expenses than necessary for you.”
”Yes,” Tony said. When Barnes didn't relax an iota, he sighed. ”Okay enough. He should wake up soon.”
”What if I stay the night,” he suggested. ”We don’t have to do anything – let’s watch a film and I’ll sleep on your couch. It probably wouldn’t be as good as you think, anyway, I’ve no clue about any of it. But let’s not call it a night just yet.”
Alright, Steve thought. It seemed unlikely to him that a billionaire superhero with people lining up to get even a second of his attention would be in need of flattery, but. Who knew, maybe Tony was feeling self-conscious after he and Pepper had separated. He hadn’t seen anybody else since, as far as Steve was aware.
”Yeah, yeah,” Tony said, still leaning on Steve trying to get his bearings. ”Let’s not do that again.”
Natasha nodded and went first. Steve watched her drop and roll-land to the lower roof and estimated it was about ten feet or so, not too bad but could result in a broken ankle for Tony if he landed wrong.
”Listen,” Bucky started after a while. ”Maybe you should just give it a go. Relieve some pent up stress, show him some nice time. Heck, for once
Tony’s whole demeanor changed at that, now really looking at Steve, staring him with an intensity and honest-to-god desire in his eyes. “Won’t you come here?” He beckoned.
Steve had many flaws, but he did have a great deadpan. ”I've had this one, too. Does yours end in a cold shower?”
Unlike Steve would have assumed he wasn't meeting Steve's eyes confidently, proud of his beauty and the reaction it had on Steve. Since Steve had already made a placating speech before, he decided to rather show what he thought about Tony's body.
“Yeah. It was a poll with parameters. Who out of all of you, if you had to choose… It doesn’t mean anything more.”
Steve swallowed. If sleep had interrupted the slow spread of heat inside him from before, it came back now, full force.
They had barely sat down on Sam's couch when Sam had to go take a phone call. Steve and Tony were left alone except for Sam's music. Ella Fitzgerald, Steve recognized, even though he didn't know the song. Steve hadn't ever seen her live back in the thirties, but he remembered some of her songs. It was nice just sitting quietly together with Tony. Not saying anything also meant less of a chance of saying something stupid.
Tony 's face lit up with glee. Steve rolled his eyes at him. ”Get your mind out of the gutter, Stark,” he admonished him.
Without the press, Tony kept an appropriate distance, but his conversation was still laced with teasing remarks to make light fun of Steve. Steve answered in kind and decided to take the shift in atmosphere as the gift it was.
He peeled the T-shirt off and dropped it on the floor. With a glance to make sure he had Tony's attention, he took his underwear off.
Steve, who didn't really enjoy the taste of any 40-proof alcohol, no matter how expensive, took the offered glass with a dry look. "The shield. You know."
Tony grinned. “Yeah, I was going mad thinking if the sex we had was you having some passing interest, what would it be like to be someone you loved.”
