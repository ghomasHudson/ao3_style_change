Logan wasn't in the mood to let the two chit-chat. Pillow talk could wait. The mutant shoved Steve onto his back and pounced on him in one smooth motion, almost too fast for an ordinary person to track. Logan tangled one powerful hand into soft blonde hair and dragged Steve into a demanding kiss, holding back nothing as he ground himself against the taller man.
"You two wouldn't know 'routine' if it slithered up and bit you on the ass," Fury spat, pushing himself up and stalking out of the room.
Because I'm not so much of a jerk that I really wanna leave anyone hanging, keep reading this if you wanna feel a little better.
On the floor, Natasha and Coulson were obviously far more worried about entertaining themselves than they were about impressing anyone. Still, neither of them were terrible. Spotting Clint watching them, Nat held out a hand to him.
"Shh, it's okay. It's okay, Coulson. Phil. You'll be alright. We'll be alright," Clint soothed, trying and only partially succeeding at keeping the tremor from his own voice. It was like getting punched in the throat to see the man so traumatized. It was hard to breathe, to think, but Clint made himself. Phil needed him to keep it together, because his handler was obviously struggling with that right at the moment. Clint gently slid his hand behind Phil's head and leaned in, pressing their foreheads together. "We're still alive, and we're gonna get out of here eventually, so we have to hang on, okay?" He swallowed hard around the lump in his throat, unsure if he believed the words.
"Ditto," Logan admitted with a chuckle. He ran a hand through Scott's wet hair, nuzzling at his stubbled throat. They were cuddling, he realized. It was a surreal epiphany, but one he enjoyed nonetheless. "I still remember wantin' to beat ya in a very different way."
Phil sighed. The truth was that since his return, he'd found himself unable to corral his racing thoughts at times and not a lot had worked well. "The important thing is to take care of yourself. Right now that means distraction. Drinking's off the list and after last night I'm pretty sure you'd be due for a lot worse than a hangover anyway." Forcing a smile, he suggested, "Go see if Darien's done playing barista. I'll do whatever research my clearance level allows." //And try to stay busy enough not to think too hard about any of this.//
"Well, everyone gripes about my aggressive-aggressive, so...." He shrugged.
Tony smiled and forced himself to get out of the bed, kissing Steve's forehead. Morning breath didn't worry him too much, but he was pretty sure that more lip-to-lip contact would result in him staying well past lunch. "Definitely grabbing them some food and coffee," he agreed, ruffling Steve's hair. "And you better. Come by, I mean. I think Fitz is freaked out by the fact that we're dating, and at the very least he needs to be subjected to me eye fucking you for a few minutes."
Tony gave Steve's hand a reciprocating squeeze and grinned a little. "I'm mostly in one piece. At least eighty percent. I mean, all of my organs are here and on the inside where they belong," Tony pointed out obstinately. When Steve gave him another of his patented "looks," though, Tony sighed and rolled his eyes, sagging back against the gurney. "Fine. I guess since I won't be talking you into a handjob in the hospital, I'll go to sleep."
Logan smiled his satisfaction, dragging a finger across his lover's prostate before he fumbled some lube from the coffee table onto his fingers and thrust a third into Scott's body. "Fuck, you're tight. And fucking beautiful like this, too," he murmured. He loved how responsive Scott was behind closed doors. He'd seen the man take terrible beatings with barely a reaction, but a little pleasure, and his lover was squirming and making the most beautiful sounds.
As Nat relaxed, Clint sat up a little, unceremoniously wiping his mouth on the back of his hand and glancing at Darien. He gave the man a knowing smirk. //Nobody's that gay,// he thought to himself, watching his newest toy fondle himself. Nat in the throes of passion was a sight to behold, and being anything like human was qualifier enough to find the show arousing. He braced his hands on either side of her waist, but he knew better than to do anything too presumptuous. Instead, he submissively brushed his cheek against her stomach as if silently asking for whatever pleasure she was willing to throw his way.
"Mmm... perhaps," Loki allowed with a sigh. Mortals were more confusing than he had expected. More resilient. Stronger. It was actually incredibly frustrating. He let the issue lie for a moment, resolving to see what he could do with what was left of Coulson's mind after Creed was finished. Perhaps he could still find the answer then. Loki finally returned his gaze to Stark. "As for the sleep and sex that you missed out on, I suppose that's something I could make reparations for."
"The nude sushi would've been completely fine. But if you'll lay down over here," Tony pointed to a nearby work table, "I can make do with chips and a sandwich. I'm good at improvising."
"No back up, but we could use a lift." Now that he had his bearings, it was easy enough to give her instructions on how to reach the gas station, random and remote as it was. "Once we get back, a once over in medical would be appreciated."
Bruce glanced toward Fitz, wondering at the man's apparently sour expression, before pushing the button. The numbers ran, and Jarvis displayed the results. "We have a winner," Bruce said quietly. Something else occurred to him a moment later, though, that tempered his excitement. "Jarvis?"
Everyone froze mid-swing. Except Hulk, who gave his opponent one last smack against the floor before releasing the trembling man to scowl at Thor.
Logan carelessly threw a blanket over Tony, "I ain't kissin' you good night."
"That is rather a lovely thank you," she answered, blushing and smiling and feeling her heart flutter nervously. "Shall we?" Jemma nodded toward the tower. It wasn't that she was eager to get back, but she knew there were larger things afoot. Bruce might well be called on to do things that she knew made him feel terrible. "For the record, if you're up to it when things are taken care of tomorrow, you're always welcome to come and hide in the lab with us, decompress."
Clint had flinched a little at the touch before remembering it was Phil. He edged away from the puddle of what was mostly bile and took the rag, wiping his face down before taking the other rags from Phil's hand and moving out of his line of sight to clean himself up. He tugged his pants back on and slowly sank to the floor next to his handler. He opened his mouth to say something, then gave up, whimpering as he pressed his face to Phil's chest, his arms winding tightly around the man's waist. He'd barely thought of the way Loki had used him when he'd been abducted, had almost managed to forget, but Creed had torn that wound open and added fresh ones to go with it. "Phil... I can't," he rasped as tears rolled down his cheeks. "I can't do this. I can't do this again." With Loki, he'd submitted, offered himself up, even begged. He'd always assumed that it had all been the influence of the tesseract, but the way Creed had... "We have to get out of here."
"In good working order, sir, but I would have recommended testing them in the lab, first."
"What, my field suit's not tight enough for you?" Clint countered with a smirk. He had to admit, he'd been skeptical the first time he'd suited up. He was pretty sure he was about to spend an entire mission with the most profound wedgie the world had ever known. He'd been pleasantly surprised when the ridiculously high-tech getup had actually proven to be pretty comfortable. "Because I'm pretty sure you can see the outlines of everything in that getup."
"A suit?" Thor echoed incredulously. He gave the table a thump, making the food and trays on it jump. "Glorious! You shall do great honor unto the Man of Iron's memory!"
Clint couldn't help the flush of shame in spite of Steve's reassurances. "Thanks." A beat. "I mean, for not... just, thanks." He was glad that Steve wasn't judging him, but that almost made it feel worse, in a way. He was pretty sure he could've handled Fury screaming at him better than Rogers' quiet forgiveness. Trying to focus on something else, Clint looked over the overwhelming display of foods - half of which he couldn't have guessed the identity of - before picking a quiche and some four cheese macaroni. It was a weird combination, weirder for his choice of coffee as a beverage, but it was food he recognized and that would contain the stuff he needed to keep training and fighting. As they settled at a table, Clint unrolled his silverware before deciding, "Best bet on curing Nat and the others is still gonna be turning Loki into a puddle of goo." He looked between Rogers and Coulson, eyes intense, even a little manic. "The hammer hurt him. Not just a little. I'm pretty damned sure I broke something. I don't know how long he'll take to grow it back, but if I can hurt a god, I can kill him."
In which Natasha is surprisingly cuddly, and she keeps an eye on Clint and Phil.
"I thought we'd head back to my place," Tony replied airily. "Show you around a little, well... really, I thought I'd show off a lot." He could be quite shameless when it came to flaunting his wealth and genius, and he enjoyed the idea of trying to impress Steve. Tony mentally patted himself on the back for achieving a win in getting Steve to leave the party. He awarded himself an extra point for the awe Steve conveyed over his car. "Look at you smiling over there," Tony noted with a hint of smugness. "See, you're having a better time already."
"Begs the question of why you're still so dressed," Steve countered as he grabbed for Tony's shirt and dragged it off over his head. He pressed a hand briefly over the arc reactor. If he could trust one of Tony's stupid gadgets to keep him alive every day all day, Steve knew he had to trust in the man's other plans too. He let himself be soothed by the idea and sealed the silent promise with a kiss. Steve let himself get back into the moment, and slim fingers dove down to unfasten Tony's fly slowly and deliberately.
Coulson stood, ready to offer the chair next to the bed to Steve. “Nothing that can’t be fixed. There seem to be a few triggers left in place.”
We were due for a bit of fluff. Have some fluff!
Natasha made a sound of protest and kicked at the floor to get Logan's attention, her head shaking emphatically. No deal made with Loki could be trusted no matter how easy the price seemed. She had no idea what he could do to a mutant's mind, but she knew what Loki could do to a human, and the aftermath wasn't pretty.
The sound of the blast had completely thrown Clint's concentration, and an arrow fluttered side-to-side and across lanes. He'd expected something far more laser-like and far less explosive. Looking at the glowing edges of the decapitated mock-up, Clint realized Scott's ability was all of the above. "Jesus," he muttered, lowering his bow as he surveyed the damage.
Clint was buzzed, but not nearly buzzed enough to pretend he wasn’t aware of everything he was doing. It was a bit late to play coy or pretend that it was still part of the joke. He'd done his best to fluster Coulson, and that hadn't worked, but he'd stayed pressed against the guy well after it was obviously not working. Coulson hadn't pushed him away, either. It occurred to Clint that while Nat had been his original target, blowing off steam with his handler might not be such a bad idea, either. "Well," he murmured, leaning in close to Phil, pulling them tight together and slowing his movement to a graceful sway as the music's tempo dropped, "I was kind of curious." He shifted his hips against Phil's, the slight change in angles sending a thrill through him. "And now I'm thinking I wasn't imagining things when I saw you in your PJs the other night..." He lowered his voice and leaned in to rasp into Coulson's ear, "and I might be feeling a little left out after hearing about you and Nat."
The place was loud and somewhat dark, but didn't seem terribly grungy. There was a fair number of guys wearing biker leathers, and no shortage of guys wearing leather in general. A bald-shaven barkeep full of piercings and tattoos plopped a microbrew in front of Clint without prompting, then regarded Darien blankly. "What's Edward havin'?"
The feral mutant barely seemed to hesitate, grabbing the arrow and ripping it - barbed tip and all - right back out. "You must be the idiot I'm about to kill. Seriously, who brings a bow to a gunfight?" he chuckled, a trickle of blood running from the corner of his mouth. Victor dodged another arrow, though it still lodged in his shoulder. He smirked at first, then his eyes widened as burning pain began to spread from the wound.
"Not leaving it laying around for them to pick up," Clint countered, grabbing a carabiner clip and securing the hammer to his belt, the weight oddly reassuring as he drew his bow. He glanced at the weapon Coulson was holding, raising an eyebrow. "Not sure you should play with that," he remarked, ducking just in time as something went flying through the space where his head had been. Straightening, he felt his blood run cold as he realized who he'd just dodged. "Claws. Huge. You must be Logan's brother," he deadpanned before firing an arrow straight into Creed's chest.
Fluff and smut. Tony and Steve earned some. Especially given what's coming down the road... trust me.
Scott was glad to relax and glad that Logan hadn't put the brakes on. He leaned into the embrace and let himself enjoy the reprieve. There had been a desperation to what they'd done together before that hadn't let them really explore. Passion was great, but they couldn't treat every sexual encounter like they'd never see each other again. It wasn't healthy or sustainable in the long term, which was something Scott definitely wanted them to have. As his lips parted beneath Logan's, Scott's hand raised to the man's hair and trailed down the back of his neck.
Thor clenched his teeth together at the hurt look in Loki's eyes. //All of this is my fault.// The thunder god couldn't help but blame himself. He'd hurt his brother in ways that couldn't be undone, and all for the sake of his image. He'd let his friends kick Loki around, and when the moment of truth had come, Thor had lied by omission and denial. He had loved Loki; he'd just been afraid to admit it to anyone. Even himself. Thor opened his mouth to deny the accusations, but the words stopped cold on his tongue when Loki changed the subject. Without thinking, he placed a hand on Loki's shoulder and promised, "I will speak for you, brother."
"So, what you're telling me is, I shouldn't've been staring at her cleavage." When Coulson gave him 'the look', he held up his hands. "I'm kidding. And you're weirdly good at the 'dad' look. Just so you know." He sighed as he leaned back in his seat. "You know, I have to give you credit. Not many guys would walk up to gods and telepaths and talk to them like it was a completely normal thing."
Tony looked up, honestly surprised by the offer. He glanced back at Bruce, who nodded. "Okay." Back to Simmons before he snapped at Bruce, "You can keep 'em. But food and water's your responsibility."
Logan grinned. Scott drunk was turning out to not just be entertaining, but more or less the most amazing thing ever. As if to keep Scott focused, Logan casually ran a hand up the man's thigh, hooking his thumb in Scott's belt. "Just don't take too long," he said, grabbing a shot for himself. "Hate to have to fuck you right here in this booth. Might have some explainin' to do when we get back," he said, giving Nat a faint smile to let her know he hadn't forgotten she was also on the menu.
Immediately Fitz quailed only to find his spine again a second later. "You should be careful, Jemma."
Coulson pointedly ignored the self pity. “You haven’t spoken to the rest of the team much, but I doubt it’s a surprise to you to hear that they aren’t particularly thrilled to have you in the tower. You don’t remember what happened with Stark, but they do. They’re not bad people, but it’s hard for them not to hold it against you.” He waited a beat for the words to sink in. “Given that, Captain Rogers has still spent almost every waking moment when he’s not on duty with you. He moved rooms to be close to you - despite what the rest of the team, Stark in particular, might think about that.” Coulson raised his eyebrows and smiled faintly. “Are you sure he wouldn’t notice?”
"Mhm." Bruce grabbed another muffin and finished off his mocha.
Victor was beautiful much in the same way as Thor: tight and muscular, but with a darker edge. That edge was the part that made him tolerable and even a bit fascinating. Loki bared his throat, giving Victor the access he desired. His own blunt nails raked over the man's neck. "You heal quickly, yes? I tend to bite."
At Steve's touch Tony could feel his resolve beginning to crumble. It was a subtle breaching of the wall he'd erected, the crack spidering outward. Tony, barely holding it together already, visibly shuddered as the emotional weight of everything he'd been trying to forget threatened to cripple him. "What do you want me to say?" His voice was little more than a whisper. "That I relive that moment every time I close my eyes? That the only way I can forget is drinking myself blind? Or... or how I can't even look at you and remember...?"
Surprises weren't exactly among Tony Stark's favorite things unless he was fully aware of the surprise in advance, of course. And this day was turning out to be just full of surprises. "Better late than never, right?" Tony quipped, the beginnings of a smile threatening to quirk his mouth. "So, you caring about me and all... does that mean no more pissing contests when we're being manipulated by alien technology? Because I rather enjoyed that."
Tony wasn't far behind his lover, arching against Steve's body as he came, his free hand digging hard into the blonde's muscular shoulder as he gasped softly. He collapsed boneless against the mattress, his body jerking a few more times in the aftermath before he fell completely still, grinning stupidly at the the other man. "I think... I think there wasn't a lot of point in that shower you took," he observed, reaching up to drag Steve into a languid kiss.
Clint had taken a moment to remember Ward as well in spite of having trained him as a fledgling agent. Something still didn't quite sit right with Clint when it came to Ward, but he figured it was just the fact that the man was kind of a dick. Clint's eyes fell closed as soon as he settled into his seat, and he was half out of it when he felt a firm hand push him back into it and yank the harness down over his head. His eyes flicked open to look up in startled confusion as Ward smirked cockily down at him and clipped the harness in place.
Steve's eyes widened at the sight of the gash. "Tony!" He reached out, fingers brushing along the edge of the marred flesh. His eyes widened at the sight of the wound only to narrow as he looked back at Logan. "Not everybody here can heal as quickly as we can." Teeth grinding together it was all Steve could do not to yell, but he didn't want to make the situation worse than it already was. A leader needed to be calm. Losing his head wouldn't help - or at least not as much as he would have liked. It wouldn't undo the damage. Steve tore his gaze away from Logan to fix on Tony. "Does it hurt much? I hate to say it, but stitches would probably be a good idea."
"You're about to tell me you're getting up," Steve muttered against Tony's chest, "and I'm not entirely sure I approve." He wondered how many times they'd have to save the world before they earned a real breather. Steve shifted and blinked sleepily before he pushed himself into a sitting position. He was stiff from lying in the same position all night, but it had been well worth it. "Guess it wouldn't be very patriotic of me to tell you to stay in bed with me until lunchtime, huh?"
Logan nodded his agreement, snagging the soap and scrubbing down. "I think I kinda agree," he said, pressing his lips to Scott's throat before herding him out of the spray so he could rinse off. "I might get insecure without you to cuddle. And besides, all the fun people live here," he pointed out with a wink.
Clint felt a twinge of satisfaction at the praise, but he knew better than to make too much of a show of it. Instead, he flicked his intense blue eyes up at her as he nipped at the inside of her thigh in mock defiance. He then kissed his way back to her waiting heat, his tongue shoving aside the scant fabric of her thong and slowly teasing at her entrance. His fingers remained tangled in the waistband of the panties, and after several moments he tugged down, settling back on his knees for a moment as he helped her slide one leg from the undergarment. He wasted little time in resettling between Nat's thighs, his tongue dragging over her outer lips before slowly delving between them and dragging over her clit.
Bruce couldn't help a faint snicker at that as he helped himself, grabbing a couple of sandwiches for himself and retreating to a corner.
Tony had risen from the bed as they spoke. He really wanted to get in the shower, but now his interest was piqued, and he was rarely inclined to let go of things that made him curious. He thought a moment, watching the god. "You're talking about an alliance. Joining the Avengers. I thought you'd talked yourself out of that already." He cocked his head at Loki. "You should probably figure out a plan for that if that's the idea. One that doesn't involve being manipulative, because I'm pretty sure Romanov is better at that game. And probably sooner over later. They may not risk everything to come get my dead body, but I'm pretty sure you've made them mad enough that they'll do whatever it takes to drop that creepy ass hammer of yours right on top of you."
*****
"Go fuck yourself." Logan fixed his attention on the small television on the shelf behind the bar. "Had enough of you government spooks."
It was Phil's turn to look almost bashful, going slightly pink at the ears and smiling. "Okay. Good. Then I don't think there's anything that you should be scared to talk about." He was satisfied to hear that Clint was staying of his own volition and not out of some misplaced sense of doing right by Natasha. "That said, I think we probably do owe her a drink or something." Phil couldn't believe she'd seen the potential when it had been so off the map for him. "I'm really, really grateful for the chance." He knew it wouldn't be the same as whatever life Clint had hoped he'd find someday with Natasha, but he hoped that it could still be something satisfying for both of them given the opportunity.
The idea was strangely hot, the thought that Steve would want to preserve the moment and with such a degree of effort. That combined with the sight of Steve's gorgeous eyelashes fluttering against his cheeks was enough to make Tony half crazy. He leaned forward to press a kiss to the back of Steve's neck, bracing a hand on the couch. "Think I'd like that," he purred, watching gorgeous pink lips quiver with pleasure. Steve was obviously relishing the moment, and the look of him so turned on was something Tony wanted to memorize in every detail. "Maybe you should draw us both." He punctuated the suggestion by jerking his hips forward, burying himself fully in his lover's tight heat.
Knowing Tony had a lot on his mind, Bruce looked over at Fitz-Simmons. "Maybe we better start putting together a prototype, then." They only had access to three Hydra weapons. It was all Fury could talk the Council out of. Hopefully, it'd be enough.
Clint carefully hid the feeling of satisfaction he got from seeing the nervousness in Darien's stance. Instead, he just shrugged. "Depends on who you ask. Also depends on whether or not you come willingly." Hawkeye crossed his arms over his chest and fixed intense blue eyes on the other man. "I'm with an organization called SHIELD. We work for the government. You might've heard of the Avengers?"
They stayed focused and relatively quiet until Logan finally came by in response to a text from Bruce. They all presented the situation to him, then Tony gave him a hopeful look.
When she rested her legs over his, he grabbed one of her feet and started to run his fingers over the arch, trying to soothe the no doubt tired, sore muscles. He looked up at the last words. "I appreciate it," he said, his smile turning a little sad. He wanted to tell her that she could do exactly that, but he knew better. He knew what the answer would be. They both did. He pressed his lips together and focused on rubbing her feet. "I guess it's alright. Just kind of... I think I will give him a high-five actually. Make the bastard blush," Clint decided.
Scott laughed out loud at the image and settled himself in more firmly against Logan. It was like being wrapped in a cocoon, safe and snug and warm. He needed that sense of security even if they weren't likely to have long to enjoy it. "Okay, when you put it that way, I should probably talk to Coulson." Scott paused. "I didn't get a whole lot of what was going on, just what I could figure out from the chatter. Care to paint me a picture of how bad things are going to be around here?" If the gun could knock Logan on his ass after one use, he wondered what the hell had happened to Steve trying the same thing twice.
Tony hadn't missed their reactions, but he could tell it wasn't malicious, and Steve hadn't seemed to notice. Bruce wasn't making eye contact at the moment. That could wait. Either til the meeting, or until after, whichever Tony felt like waiting for. He made a point to settle into the seat next to Steve, then looked to Fury. "So, Nick, which one of us gets yelled at first? I feel like you should probably start with Logan, but-"
Natasha smiled openly as she saw the faint traces of strain around Clint's eyes. In the field, Clint's poker face was second to none. In bed it was absolutely terrible. She drew him down for a long, lingering kiss. She was getting closer by minute, so it was an easy choice to let Clint off his leash. "Now I want you to fuck me as hard as you can. Make me cum for you."
"We've been keeping him in the hallway. He's been waiting for any news about you." //Or about Bucky.// Natasha decided that the last bit might be better kept to herself and tilted her head instead. "Would you like me to get him? I wanted to make sure you were up to it first." Out of everyone, she knew that Steve would be the hardest to face. He knew enough for the whole situation to be embarrassing and not nearly enough to offer the comfort Tony really needed.
Scott raised an eyebrow as the men seemed to give up any pretence of play. He smirked and nodded in their direction. "Romanov is disturbingly good at this."
It was dangerously hard to focus on what Tony was saying. He wore a casual, dark blazer with jeans and a white shirt that was unbuttoned just a bit too much. Just enough to be completely distracting. Steve sat in the front row - a privilege afforded to all of the Avengers, though he'd been the only one to take Tony up on the offer - of the Stark Symposium. Tony's speech was the kick off for a three day scientific binge of presentations of a very hardcore, very technical bent.
Scott couldn't help laughing, the sound genuine if quiet. "At the moment, I could probably do worse than hanging around and being your maid." He took a swig of beer and then looked toward the windows. "I guess I should dig out my shades and get some sun soon." As little as he wanted to go back to constant care and concern over even the smallest gesture for fear of hurting someone, Scott knew he was damn near useless without his powers. "It's so much fucking easier to wash my face, though."
Phil hadn't watched most of the movie. He kept looking down at Clint. Watching his face move and his fingers twitch was fascinating. Soothing. He lifted one calloused hand to his lips to kiss it and let the sense of real peace wash over him. The three of them were together and safe. Healthy and sound would come later, but Phil knew that together they could manage all of it. He was fairly certain that he'd sleep a lot better that night.
"Adrenaline," Clint replied dismissively.
Clint laughed. "I'd offer to join you, but I think that might defeat the purpose," he said, not quite managing to get all the thickness out of his voice. "Just think of it as revenge for poking me in the ass for an entire afternoon with no follow-through." While he'd never really thought of any real relationship with Phil before Nat's intervention, Clint still distinctly remembered fantasizing about how the whole scenario could have ended. Of course, he'd wrongly assumed that it had had nothing to do with him. //Well, that's what happens when you assume…//
We need some victories every now and then, right?
This chapter is almost pure porn. Once the porn starts, it doesn't stop until the last few paragraphs, so if you don't want the porn (this is filthy, guys. sex with multiple partners in the back room of a biker bar filthy.), you can skim over those parts or just skip this chapter. Plot will return soon, honest.
As the plane took off, Logan noted Hawkeye staring at him and tilted his head. "What?"
Clint listened intently, relaxed but alert. The archer straightened a little and focused more, though, when Coulson mentioned him. He'd known from the get-go that Coulson was one of the few agents who didn't still look at him a little suspiciously every time they saw him roaming free with full access to his weapons and mission files. ?With Loki back in the picture, the subtle sideways glances had become wary stares. Coulson was a lot of things: polite, soft-spoken, diplomatic, but he wasn't a liar. Clint knew when the man said he trusted the archer, Coulson meant it.
"Probably by Agent Romanov."
Steve gave the man a dirty look, but he didn't ask Tony to stop. Steve didn't really want him to, and from the smug look on Tony's face, he knew that well enough. His expression softened into a smile as he gave Tony's a squeeze. "A dark corner might not be privacy enough for my taste, but that doesn't mean you can't still get lucky tonight if you play your cards right." He glanced up and caught a flash of movement from a nearby table - a man discreetly trying to tuck his cell phone out of sight. Steve barely resisted the urge to roll his eyes. "I guess it was too good to be true to think we might not get noticed."
Bruce snorted as he pushed himself up. "I think I'm going to go get some sleep."
"Nice of you to notice." The next thrust made Tony wince, but the Soldier didn't slacken his pace for a second. He had his orders. The point was to debase the man as much as possible and leave him a wreck. That was all that mattered. He ignored the other man's pained groans as he thrust hard and fast into the body that had been so willing a moment before. "What do you think finding you like this will do to your hero, Mr. Stark?"
"Feeling's mutual," Scott agreed with a smirk. He stepped under the flow of the water and held a hand out to Logan. "It's like you always look surprised... which I guess maybe we kind of both are with all of this." He closed his eyes and looked almost concerned for a moment as the water heated his skin and washed away the sweat and cum. "I've felt weird all day," he finally admitted. "Like... it's like when I'm charged up, power-wise. I don't know how to explain it, there's just this... this pressure. Energy, maybe? I'm sure there are perfect scientific words for it, but that's the way it feels, like something's curled up waiting in the back of my head. I've felt it all day, but I still feel normal too. I don't feel like I'm about to blast a hole in the wall. Or you. Which is good, I guess, since the dick took my glasses."
Loki didn't have time to turn fully before the blow caught him. It hit with crushing force, and the god crumpled to the floor, clutching his side. He found his feet quickly. Pain was becoming far more common than it had once been for him. Loki's eyes flashed with anger. "How DARE you use that hammer against its rightful owner!" He leveled his staff at Clint and channeled every bit of anger he felt into the power that fed it.
Darien had to fight the urge to kiss the frown off of Clint's face. He reminded himself that their relationship wasn't that kind. At best they were friends. He shook it off and poured Clint a cup of coffee. "You look like a man who needs it black right about now."
Steve laughed aloud at that and agreed at last. "You've got it. I'll bring you guys lunch, okay?" That would give the group a break and let him slip in without it being some kind of juvenile deal with him going to hang out with his boyfriend. "Now go and work before I start kissing you. We both know we're not gonna stop if it comes to that." As it was, his fingers itched to grab Tony and drag him back into bed.
Fitz scoffed. "Doesn't mean he isn't crazy."
It was Fitz' turn to look stricken and stare at her, both shocked and somewhat amazed-looking as Simmons seemed to finally think better of the tirade. He raised his eyebrows as she stopped and tried to fill in, "What she means to say is that we're working on it. Very hard. We're hoping that using some of the nano technology SHIELD has been working on, we could create something that will help with the fluctuating energy patterns, make something that's adaptable enough to keep it from being able to draw so much from the user, though that... well, it doesn't solve the problem of what it does draw from at that point."
Tony’s flippant demeanor disappeared, and his eyes narrowed as his expression darkened. "Practical? You could've disarmed him. Or just disappeared. You did it for fun. Because you could," Tony growled. "I saw the video. You enjoyed it. If you really think you're going to be part of the Avengers, you need to get it through your head that we're more than just insects for you to step on when it suits you. Especially considering that we 'insects' have managed to upend not just one but several of your plans."
"Quality over quantity," Pepper answered with a wavering smile. "Anyone who saw the two of you together knew what you meant to each other. It doesn't matter if it was a week or fifty years, Steve."
"Indeed, that is the man. Thor is but Loki's puppet, and even if the spell is broken - the Lady Frigga could surely do so - it would mean her life. We are being held hostage, and this will not stand. Thor showed his brother mercy before. The course was not the right one." Sif had thought it a foolish way to handle things in the first place. No one as untrustworthy as Loki would hesitate to go to any lengths to secure his freedom - just as he had in the end. "Heimdall, the gate keeper, aided me in my escape. My departure will be noticed, but I do not intend to return alone."
Bruce, hands still in his pockets as he moved to another row of shelves, started looking through the massive collection. "I think I saw this place on an episode of Hoarders."
Normally Steve might have tried to swat Tony's hand out of the way, but as it was, he couldn't bear to let go of his hold on Tony's hip. Coupled with that was the fact that Tony looked sinfully gorgeous stroking himself, and soon Steve was gasping out a warning that the end was close. Feeling the heat of Logan pressed in against him, Steve let his eyes flutter closed for just a moment. He savored every sensation surrounding him, let it wash over him as he finally began to move more quickly. His hips snapped forward faster, though Steve remained ever mindful not to squeeze too hard or move too fast. If he hurt Tony through losing control, he would never forgive himself - besides, the last thing he wanted to do was kill the mood when everything felt so good. Steve shuddered and buried his face in Tony's neck as he finally came with a gasp that sounded suspiciously like the billionaire's name.
With Steve out of the armor, it was an exercise in every ounce of discipline he didn't have for Tony to remain still long enough for Simmons to make sure he was alright. The second she gave him permission to move again, he was across the room and tugging Steve up against him. He didn't give half a damn that the man was covered in sweat or that there was a significant audience. He needed to feel his lover against him, to breathe him in and touch him.
“I know he didn’t care much for it, but he was the right man for the job addressing the public and being the face of our forces.” Coulson had eventually managed to get over any sense of hero worship enough to have some real conversations with Steve. He’d been surprised to find how ambivalent the man’s feelings were about some of his work during the war. It had been less surprising the more he saw Steve in action and the more he realized that despite the man’s natural charisma, he preferred being useful to being a figurehead. “I suspect that you’re more capable than you give yourself credit for, but I understand that facing the public may not be your first instinct right now.” He hesitated and then ventured, “I can guarantee you’ll be in some SHIELD-ordered therapy for awhile, and your psychiatrist may not agree with this, but in my experience, hiding isn’t the way to get through it. Putting yourself out there is.”
"Don't haveta tell me twice," Victor returned, grabbing his cock and shifting slightly. He pressed forward into tight, yielding heat and shuddered, his claws digging into Loki even further. "Fuck," he rasped. The god felt perfect, just tight enough, just hot enough... He had to move slowly, letting himself adjust to the sensation. "God, you feel good."
Steve breathed a sigh of relief and then climbed out of Tony's lap, holding his hands out. "I'll walk you to the lab." It would take all of three minutes, but that was three more minutes he got to spend holding hands with his lover. Besides, he couldn't keep hiding. He wanted to hide. He would have been infinitely more comfortable hiding. It just wouldn't help anything. If he was going to keep helping the team in the small ways he could, Steve needed to keep himself in the game. "I don't mind the holding hands part either, but... yeah, I kinda don't want to just hold hands." Being with Tony was too good to confine things to only the sweet and romantic even if it meant pushing himself away from what was comfortable. "We might just have to go a little slower than we would've otherwise is all."
Holding himself up against his lover, Tony looked up at him pleadingly. "Just gimme a couple more days? Please, baby," he whispered, looking more scared than he had in a long time.
Tony screwed his mouth up, trying to remain stoic while pushing the memories out of his mind. The thought of talking to someone about what had happened made him feel sick all over again. "Well, you'll have to forgive me, but somehow I don't believe that," he murmured, tossing the bottled water he'd been handling across the room. Tony scored an impromptu goal when the bottle landed in a waste paper basket. "Right now I don't think I'll ever be able to talk about... anything." He glanced up at Natasha, almost worriedly. "Steve... has he been by?"
The more he woke up and the more he realized that it was real, the more Steve's heart sank. He'd imagined a lot of things that might happen while he stumbled his way through helping Natasha and Logan. He'd imagined a hundred things, and somehow the idea of being brought back to such a useless state wasn't one of them. And Tony... he couldn't understand... he had no way of knowing all the hell that went along with it. How could someone like Tony, a man who could have anyone, want to be with someone who could barely breathe on his own? The tears were falling before he even realized he was in danger of crying.
"I'm relatively certain that you helped," he challenged pointedly.
"Tony, that's a little much, don't'cha think?"
Logan glanced between the two of them. He already hated them both. Steve reminded him of Scott's unending douchebaggery, and Stark just seemed too slimy. Still, Stark was right. Sitting around wasn't his style. "Alright. Fine. But I ain't wearin' suspenders," he said, giving Steve a pointed look.
"I love you too," Scott answered, unable to keep the smile from his face. He would never have pictured being with Logan as something easy or comfortable. As it turned out, it was both. "I never thought I'd be at a place in my life where so much is changing all at the same time and you of all people would end up being the one who treated me like it was normal. Thank you."
"Mmm... good. My evil plan has come to fruition." Steve gave a little wriggle beneath the man, just enough to feel Tony's strength. "Then I guess the only real question left is whether you'd like to bend me over the couch or fuck me up against the wall." It still made him blush to say things like that, but he knew it was worth it. He knew how hot it got Tony, and watching that spark of lust light in his lover's eye was something he'd never get tired of seeing.
It took less than a minute for Natasha to round the corner and take stock of the situation. "Clint, now's not the time. We need Loki in the plane, and we need him there fast. You're on herding duty, not killing duty. Creed didn't do anything to your brain, right? So you still remember that those two," she gestured to Steve and Tony, "are actually in charge at the moment?"
Tony was momentarily overwhelmed with the two struggles he was so firmly planted between. Figuring Bruce could cope with his current problem, Tony focused on the blue chick tangled around Steve. "Okay, you're gonna have to get out of my kool-aid, hon," he admonished, trying to aim in a way that'd only strike the python-esque mutant woman. Realizing that wasn't going to work, he dropped his hand. //I'm gonna hate myself for this, sooner or later. The two were too low to the ground for Tony to aid Steve with a flyby, and that left one option.// The armored superhero threw himself into the tangle, trying - unsuccessfully - to catch Mystique by the throat, the hair... anything. Armored up, he didn't have the agility to fight the woman. "Jarvis, ditch the suit."
Logan grinned broadly at Scott. "Afraid you're gonna kill me?" he asked, obviously amused. He'd seen what Scott's abilities could do unchanneled, but he was pretty confident that if he could survive a nuclear blast, he could cope with whatever happened in that room. "I'll be fine. Unless I'm makin' you nervous?" he teased.
"Oh, believe me, anytime," she agreed with a throaty chuckle before stealing a kiss from Scott too. "You boys are absolutely beautiful, and if you ever need a little extra something? Call me. If I'm free, I might just show up." Natasha slipped from bed and didn't bother cleaning up before she tugged her pants and shirt back on, balling up her underwear in a hand without any apparent shame at the idea of walking through the Tower holding it. She gave the boys a final wave before sauntering from the room.
Surprised and frankly flattered by the invitation, Phil smiled. "I'd love that," he answered earnestly. It would be nice to relax with someone who might enjoy the scenery as much as he did. "I think after all this, we'll need a day or two off." He sat back in his chair and tilted his head at Clint. "I know you don't cook, but how do you feel about assisting with dishes?"
Scott wondered if he would have ever been able to do the same things with someone else and suspected not. He trusted Logan with his life, so trusting him with embarrassing sexual proclivities didn't seem like that big a deal. It was so damn much easier than it had been with Jean that it was laughable. When Logan dragged all three fingers against his prostate, Scott's whole body bucked, his legs spreading wide to give Logan as much access as humanly possible. He gladly bared himself for Logan in a way he never had for anyone else. "You're so fucking hot like this. Sometimes I'm not quite sure if you're going to fuck me or eat me alive."
"Few days," Tony answered. "I mean, it's just a flesh wound, right? Mild internal injuries at best. So, probably tomorrow I'll be fine." //If I'm not, they can just sew me back up, because I'm not waiting anymore.// The billionaire leaned up, nibbling at Steve's ear as his hand drifted low over the blonde's abs. "Seem a little restless," he said, his hand stopping right at the waistband of Steve's briefs. "Hard time waiting it out?"
Thor bit his tongue. He wanted to tell the mutant to mind his words, but Logan wasn't wrong. Loki deserved no quarter, no kindness in light of the things he'd done. "We will get the Man of Iron back, and we will make sure that my brother troubles your people no longer."
"Still nice to know." Phil honestly wasn't sure how to explain it. He knew that until he had a few hours to do nothing but scrub off several layers of skin, he wasn't even going to feel halfway down the road to normal. It was hard to realize that Clint still looked at him with such affection when he wasn't in the mood to be around himself. The feeling of Clint against him was warm and reassuring. It was the strongest reminder of the need to survive he could ever hope for. He considered saying a hundred different things and let them all go. It wasn't their last chance. They weren't going to die, and he wasn't going to tell Clint Barton he was in love with him while there was so much other baggage attached to it. They deserved a better memory and a better time. "I don't suppose you've acquired any new ninja skills involving taking down walls with nothing but floor mats and shredded shirts?"
"Doesn't matter." Steve stepped into the shower but didn't let the separation linger. He dragged Tony in after him with a grin and pushed the man up against the wall. "This spot?" He nipped and then sucked at it. Normally it was Tony who managed to put his lips in precisely the right place to make him lose his mind. It was a luxury to have the shoe on the other foot and even more of a boost to his ego to have made Tony lose the thread of conversation when they were talking about the suit. "Made me feel close to you, though," he murmured between kisses, "being in the suit and hearing Jarvis." Steve's teeth scraped over the skin, and his arms circled around Tony beneath the pounding spray of the water. "It was like having a piece of you with me."
Loki let the mortal go. It was enough for the moment. Stark needed to compose himself, and he needed to consider his next step. He could bargain for his life alone, or he could ask for more. Asking for more would require a show of faith beyond helping Barton. It would mean giving them Stark whole and mostly unharmed. Just letting Coulson and Barton could would mean nothing, especially after what he suspected Creed had done to them. Even if the Avengers were willing to take him in on a trial basis of some kind, it would mean creating a whole new host of enemies in the Brotherhood, who likely wouldn't appreciate being abandoned. //They have to learn to be less trusting sometime.//
Happy to have her own weaponry again, Natasha settled for using it, pulling her guns from their holsters with obvious relish. She had a neat window made out of the target's central body mass a few seconds later, the paper fluttering from the impact.
Scott sank to his knees quietly and took Clint Duran to the base. It didn't matter anymore why he wanted the man, just that he did. He wanted to get Clint off, and he wanted to cum again himself until he forgot the man who'd been his lover that morning. The world was hazy and vibrant and confused, and Scott wanted to forget.
"Sushi? Or Thai. Either one." Tony paused, then gave Steve a pout. "Wait, you're planning to leave to get this 'food' of yours, aren't you?"
Fitz paced around Tony, memorizing specs and tapping notes into a pad in his hand. "There are so many variables," he muttered, obviously frustrated at the multiple trains of thought moving through his head. Realizing it sounded rather bleak, he cleared his throat and met Tony's gaze with a quick, forced smile. "Not that we can't handle all the variables because we can. All of them."
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve and sighed into the contact. His hands moved over the lean body pressed against his own, but there was less of a disconnect with the kiss. The kiss was still Steve. Maybe not as forceful, but the movement, the tempo, the particular way Steve's tongue slid against his and the way he sighed at the touch were all very familiar. Tony's hands slide down over the blonde's ass, kneading lean flesh as he moaned against soft lips. "Need you," he murmured against Steve's mouth, his hips grinding up against his lover's.
As they walked into the store, the clerk stared at them in near-shock. She was a lean, dark-haired young woman, and she did a double-take when she caught sight of Coulson. "You... it was you." She walked around the counter, staring hard at Phil as if to reassure herself she wasn't imagining it. "Remember? With the donuts? And the bag of flour?"
"Even at the lowest output, this gun... If you have to use it, it'll kill you. You might be able to take Loki out with it, but you wouldn't be coming home." Before Tony could tout his stunt in New York or raise any other objections, Bruce gave him a level stare. "This isn't just you now, and you know it. Think of Steve. Think of how you felt when you thought you'd lost him. And think of how he'd feel."
Tony didn't have to ask what it meant. He was being afforded a brief private moment. He glanced over at Steve's abandoned sketchpad, taking it gently from the desk and looking at it with genuine fascination. It was a bit of a stab in the heart as he realized that every one of the sketches was of him. He set the pad aside and looked up at Steve, tugging him close and pressing a kiss to his lips. "I'm gonna be fine," he insisted, wishing he could somehow make sure the words were a guarantee.
"Mmm... I hope so." The dream was promptly dashed by Tony's phone ringing on the nightstand. Steve reluctantly picked it up when he saw Coulson's face on the screen. "Agent? He's here. Are you- yes, of course." Steve offered his lover a rueful smile. "Phil needs to talk to you."
Tony nodded, still chilled from the way Loki had smiled at him. He definitely knew what a mouse felt like when a cat had it in its grips. "Yeah. More or less." He looked the plate of food over. He wasn't hungry. If anything, he was a bit nauseous, but he knew he needed food, that the upset stomach was in his head. He helped himself to a bit of bread and fruit, hoping it would be enough to calm his stomach. "Just the sketchy details. Fury's not a real giving sorta guy. Sounds like you don't really need 'Midgard' that much."
"The same team he was just willing to gut a member of?" Coulson waved it off before Scott could answer. "Barton has that effect on people. So does Stark for that matter. If we thought either one of you was dangerous, you wouldn't be here. Just remember we're on the same side, and keeping too many secrets tends to make things worse, not better."
Clint frowned at the idea that Stark was being anything but productive when it came to recovering their allies. "Yeah," he agreed, glancing at Coulson. "I'm sure we can convince Cap to let him go... and shouldn't he be too injured to be fooling around, anyway?" Not bothering to wait for an answer, he looked back to Nat. "We definitely need you back out there with us. Agent May scares me." He was joking, of course, but the woman was a poor replacement for Nat, highly skilled or not.
"Hey, fuck you, pal, I-"
Victor groaned softly as Loki's cock slid perfectly against his own. He knew that he would only be able to take what he was allowed to, but that didn't mean he wasn't going to enjoy what he could get. Razor claws dragged over Loki's skin, and Victor was surprised at the thin trails of blood left in their wake. He wondered absently if it was an illusion for his benefit, but didn't care enough to ask. He was far more focused on getting getting the god to moan for him. He smirked down at his partner as he started a steady rhythm with his hips, letting their cocks slide together. "Hmm... never made a god scream before. Wonder how my odds are...."
Logan shut off the water, much as he wanted to stay there with Scott. "Stark and his science buddies want me to go look at their newest raygun, I guess," he said, grabbing a towel and running Scott down before taking care of himself. "Then I'm gonna drink all the beer I can find that looks like it belongs to Stark. And maybe work out," he said with a smirk.
"And, yes, we wish your help in killing him. We brought him in last time. It didn't work out. We need to eliminate the threat," Natasha answered, gaze cool and measured. "I'm guessing you've realized that at this point. If he can use you to rule in his stead and control you, threaten your mother, kill Tony... it's off the rails. There's no end game that doesn't involve him dead in my book."
He didn't bother with greetings or to acknowledge their remaining prisoner. "Did Jimmy say anything? Did he mention me?" he wanted to know.
"I like it." Clint gracefully rose to his feet and offered a hand to pull Phil up with him. "You know, assuming you're alright standing up," he teased as he tugged Phil to his feet. He let Phil lead the way, trying to play off the fact that one of his feet had fallen asleep as well. He hooked an arm in Phil's as they walked, unable to keep from smiling faintly at how pleasant the whole thing was. "I think you officially chose well. The date, I mean. This was... is... fun. And I could sure as hell use a cup of coffee right before bed. Because I don't know how to act like a grownup."
In which Tony should be rest, Steve should probably be saying no, and they're both failing miserably
Steve's expression softened slightly at the news. "Good. That's good. Look, we're all kind of on edge right now, but let's break for awhile, and then we can meet with Fury this afternoon. We all know we're going to have to use the hammer somehow. We just need to get clear to pull it out of the lab and do it."
Logan grabbed a second beer and passed it to Scott, then settled at the small dining table with his own. He watched his lover closely, seeing the worry in the man's eyes. The moment before was already fading strangely from Logan's memory. He held out a hand to Scott. "C'mere," he said, offering the man a gentle smile. "You look good, y'know. Without the shades."
"Sleep sounds like heaven," Simmons agreed with a happy sigh. She noticed that Tony was already drifting away and smiled a little sadly. She hoped there ended up being absolutely no need for the hurry. "Sweet dreams!" she called out to his retreating back.
Clint nodded, still shaken. Too much was coming apart too fast. He'd fucked up in a way he wasn't sure he could even make up for, and now Nat might be in the same boat he'd been in. Then another thought occurred to him. "You don't think..." His voice broke and he cleared his throat, genuine fear in his eyes when he looked at Coulson again. "You don't think that this... whatever it is... is contagious, do you?" The idea that it might happen again, that he might lose himself again, was utterly terrifying.
"Good. I was hoping you'd say that. Think one or two of your friends could come along for the ride? I'm guessing Frigga can handle things up here, and we need all the help we can get. Between Loki and his new buddies, this isn't exactly going to be a cake walk. More casualties aren't acceptable. Especially not Barton and Coulson." Whatever happened, Natasha was set on bringing her boys home. They were the most central part of the odd collection of people she was willing to consider family. "If it's still possible, we also need to bring Tony's body home. Rogers deserves the closure."
Loki finally smiled and leaned back against the pillows, one brow arched. "I know you think very little of me, but do you honestly think that I'd kill a man who is so damn good in bed? That would be a crime."
"And to Charles Xavier, yes. Unauthorized. Off the record to a point. They're willing to help with the Brotherhood if we need it. Xavier sent me some information about them. It's a start." He glanced down the hallway. "It's probably good that Nat came back or I'd already be in Fury's office getting yelled at."
Phil recovered slowly from the sight and finally shook his head. "I'm even more convinced now that you're the terrible influence," he decided. He tried to look disgruntled, but it was difficult when the sight of Clint taking half of the bar down had been far too close to more intimate activities, and it had left him barely able to think about anything but the night before. "Terrible influence," he grumbled again before returning to eating. Phil couldn't quite drag his gaze away from Clint again, though, watching the movement of his throat as he chewed and the wicked glimmer in his eyes. "You're making it very difficult to try to re-establish that I'm actually not easy."
Suddenly Mystique arched, gasped, and went slack on top of Steve.
"Don't," Coulson cautioned softly. Unwittingly he quoted Natasha, "Don't do that to yourself, Clint." First names were rarely part of their communication, but the situation warranted it. Besides, sitting together in so casual a setting without the protection of suits and armour and rules made Phil feel distinctly exposed. "Most people would have given themselves permission to fall apart after that. I wish I'd been there to see it but I know what you did. I know how hard you fought."
Tony felt himself go cold with fear when the doctor said Steve was on life support. Then came the news that the serum wasn't working, and Tony felt certain his heart stopped. He barely heard Coulson prompt the doctor for more information or the reply. If the serum was neutralized, it meant that Steve wasn't going to be healing as fast. If at all. Tony's stomach clenched, and he had to swallow hard to keep bile from coming up.
"No one's perfect. Personally I always vet their ability to make cookies. Life's too short to skip dessert." Phil held the door open when they reached the meeting room. "Sir," he greeted Fury. "Any updates?"
Logan had a point on that score, but Scott still didn't feel right about it. Clint was a bit of a wild card, but Coulson seemed like a decent guy. Fury was a whole other story, but... Reluctantly, Scott nodded tersely. "I understand what you're saying. I do." His expression slowly faded into a smile. "I just have a gut feeling that we're doing this the wrong way." Given that they'd already done it the wrong way, had already hid things - how much, even Scott wasn't sure - he also didn't know whether they could fix it or not. "If I'm going to be part of the team here, I want to be part of it. I don't want to stand off to the side and only jump in when things are bad. If I wanted that, I would have stayed at Xavier's."
"Thank you. I'm going to take this to Fury. Just... stand by." Steve felt lighter knowing they had at least a vague direction to head in.
Back at the bar, Logan tore his gaze away and considered leaving. //Or I could be a man about all this and just accept that I don't always get what I want.//
"I think I can get behind that sentiment," Logan decided, kissing Scott again. It felt like it had been too long without the other man pressed close to him. "Been a long day. But glad for the happy ending." He glanced around the rec room. "I think everybody else is gonna be busy. Wanna use that big screen TV and catch a movie?" He wasn't sure how good he'd be about keeping his hands to himself, but he was willing to try. They needed the quiet and the normalcy.
Steve laughed in surprise at the rather apt description. "That's... yeah, buddy, that's one way of putting it. I'm on the road to recovery thanks to Dr. Simmons. Should be back to normal in another few days. And..." He took a breath and started again, "And Tony left me a suit. I'm not great at it yet, but I should be able to fight enough to make a difference and at least put out some crowd control with Jarvis helping me."
"I hope you don't mind if I'm not physically able to stop touching you for awhile," Scott whispered as they walked down the hall. The Tower was eerily quiet. He didn't like the still silence. He didn't like how strained everyone's faces were. He'd been through it before, they both had, and it never stopped being horrific. "I barely met the guy. It's still..." He didn't know how to put it into words. He also knew that Logan would understand anyway. They entered Logan's room in the same silence, and Scott wrapped his arms around Logan and just held him. "Okay, sorry, you probably need sleep. I needed that first."
The gatekeeper nodded. "As you wish."
Nat was more than aware that she'd been put in a position of playing baby-sitter in their particular group. Loki had wounded her by hurting the people around her. Clint and Coulson had suffered far more directly. They frankly still weren't sure how the latter was up and walking around. "The difference is that this time we know. We also know that we can beat him because we have. Even when he had an alien army behind him." The redhead gave a casual shrug. "This should be cake."
SHIELD's director rose as well. "Is Romanov back too?"
This chapter is... it's all plot, actually. Just plot. No smut. I know, weird.
Steve had been exposed to the idea of that through Tony himself, so he hoped the man would appreciate the joke. He made his way down to the corner to get a decent selection of chips and sandwiches from the deli. Steve did his best not to look ridiculous or winded as he carried the haul plus two bottles of soda into the Tower. He was absolutely and categorically not going to be bested by a lunch order. Steve was winded by the time he reached the lab but still smiled happily at the sight of Tony standing by a computer doing his thing. The man never failed to look in charge of everything when he was working in the lab. "Lunch is served."
Tony barely paid the two any attention. He was still fixated on Steve. "I'm going with you." When Steve looked ready to protest, Tony gave him a stone cold stare of determination, one he rarely wore and even more rarely pointed at anyone he didn't hate. "If you're about to shuffle yourself off this mortal coil, I'm going to be there with you for every last second you're still with us." He wheeled himself to the door. "Coulson, bring your crazy sniper. We might need backup if things go weird. Let's go."
Bruce held up his hands defensively when Coulson gave him an accusing look at the sight of Stark out of his chair. "Unless you want the big guy to babysit him, you should just be glad that he hasn't actually torn anything," he pointed out, then glared at Tony and his useless explanation. "You're not going to like this." He tapped a few buttons on a floating interface, bringing up a 3D projection of the hammer into the room. "We had to use some other no-touchy tech - specifically, one of the Hydra weapons - to even extract anything from this... whatever it is." The hammer was replaced by a schematic of a modified Hydra weapon. "Good news is, we can use this to fix our friends."|
"Nothin' smart to say?" Victor hissed in Phil's ear, tugging his shirt open and sending buttons flying. "Don't feel like telling your fucktoy that he's gonna be okay? Or maybe that you'll be fine?" He laughed quietly, nipping roughly at Phil's neck. "Wonder what kinda sounds you'll make when I fuck you."
"After I get through the door," the scientist replied with a nervous smile.
Logan noted that there were a few guys already eyeing him, and glanced at Tony. "Uh, I think there was an idea about getting drinks *and* women."
The words were pretty intense coming from Tony, and Steve accepted them with the same gravity. "I'm glad to hear it." He laced their fingers together. "You don't ever have to say things like that if it isn't comfortable, but just so you know, it's amazing to hear it." He could tell what Tony felt. Knowing the man cared enough to make himself say it made Steve's heart swell.
Tony groaned at the sensation. He'd gotten turned on the second Loki started working hands over his ass cheeks, and the feeling of the hard shaft pressing against him was more than enough motivation to drive him to his hands and knees. He glanced back at his partner, shivering pleasantly at the blue eyes following him, ignoring the fact that the gaze was far more predatory, far less gentle than what fit Steve's face. Dropping his head, he rocked back against Loki, his cock slowly getting hard in anticipation. "You make me so hot, Steve," he murmured. "All that time in the lab... missed you. Missed this.
The muscles in Clint's jaw twitched as he stared hard at Natasha around the bulk of Steve's suit, but he lowered the hammer nonetheless. "Fine." His gaze drifted suspiciously to Tony. The archer had really been expecting to get to off Loki, and he still didn't trust that Tony wasn't some kind of illusion or fake or who-knew-what-else. He stepped back to Phil's side, though, his eyes moving to Loki suspiciously.
Tony was silent until Bruce nudged him. "Huh? Mm. Yeah. That'd be a good idea." He looked up at Simmons. "So you're smart enough to figure it all out. Look, I'm not planning to take one for the team, but if Logan doesn't want to or something just doesn't work out, we need a backup plan. We've gotta be ready next time Loki turns up. Like, *really* ready."
In which the team confronts Loki and it goes about as well as you would expect (ie very, very badly).
"Come in, please, gentlemen. Agent Coulson, it's excellent to put a face to the voice." Xavier's chair crossed over to them with a touch to a discreet button. He held his hand out to each man in turn. "Jean, would you close the door, please?"
Tony shook his head. "Nope. Think I'll put some files together for him. In case he decides to ask, and all. And maybe make sure he's not gonna be the first one Loki reaches for if he decides he needs another drone. Come to think of it, maybe I should talk to Clint..."
A diagram popped up, illustrating Tony's injuries to him. "You've narrowly missed losing what's left of your liver, sir, and you've got a torn muscle wall, but that seems to be the worst of it."
"This feels perfect," Phil agreed, surprised at how much having Clint lying against him centered his whole being. It wasn't something he'd let himself hope for, but he realized in that moment how many sleepless nights could have been saved with the simple reassurance. Clint's presence reminded him that the man was safe and sound, was warm and alive against him. He let his eyes fall closed and felt sleep slowly beginning to call. "Could definitely get used to this," he murmured, already drifting as he wrapped an arm around Clint's muscular back.
"Plenty." Scott headed into the kitchen, his arm brushing against Clint's as he passed by. The contact felt electric, and he tried not to dwell. Instead he grabbed two beers and passed one to Clint. "I won't be offended if you don't finish it. Drinking on the job and everything. I just... this has been a pretty terrible... uh, year, actually. A terrible year," he mused, popping the top off on the edge of the counter and taking a healthy swig. Scott leaned back against the counter next to Clint and couldn't help looking the man over. "I'm sorry we haven't gotten a chance to talk much before under less dire circumstances."
"I don't know, honestly." He looked sheepish when he admitted, "In high school, I almost got the shield on my arm. In retrospect, it's better that I didn't." It was one thing having Steve know he was a bit of a fanboy, it would have been very different trying to explain the tattoo. And somehow he knew he would have ended up awkwardly explaining it whether Steve ever saw the damn thing or not. Certainly it lacked the emotional resonance of a proper memorial tattoo. The sentiment was sweet, the idea one that left Phil gently squeezing the other man's hand as they walked. "I tend to be indecisive about it. It's permanent." He gestured to the booths showcasing everything from fine art to jewelry to photos of the artist's work on skin. "How do you choose out of all this? That's why I like festivals and shows. I can enjoy all of it without having to decide."
Clint smiled, the expression predatory, giving Coulson's belt loops a tug to remind him to move. "Speechless?" he rumbled, pulling Phil closer. Their bodies still weren't quite plastered together yet, but Clint could feel his handler's body heat, and he found himself honestly wondering whether Phil would be game for more intimate contact. MUCH more intimate.
Fury dodged. "Shit. I'll fill in the other affected parties. You write this shit down in the computer so it's common knowledge." He paused and gave them a significant look. "Before the reunion scene, gentlemen."
"Yeah, sorry, I would've tried for more, but... the stuff you have to do is kind of important." Steve sighed as they walked, wandering through the halls without any definite destination. He spotted a couch set near one of the windows for lounging and dragged Tony over to it. If they went upstairs, he wasn't sure just how focused he could keep Tony - or himself - on their deadline. "I don't want you to think that I don't want the time, though. I really, really do." His fingers locked together with Tony's, and Steve looked down at the strange contrast created by the too-slender fingers that were his again. "Still wrapping my head around the fact that this isn't freaking you out more."
Clint didn't need to ask questions. Faster than the eye could follow, he had his bow in hand, deployed, and an acid-tipped arrow nocked and trained on Logan's chest. Clint knew it wouldn't kill the man, but he figured the acid might slow him down if it came to it. "Stand down, Logan," he growled, his gaze flicking to Steve, reassuring himself that the Cap had noticed and was ready to act.
When Clint woke, the three of them had shifted somewhat, but were still cuddled fairly close together. Phil's arm was comfortably around his waist. The archer tensed a moment later when he realized they had a mission. He knew Jarvis would've woken them if they were late, but he was fairly certain it was still the wee hours of the morning. He stayed still, not wanting to wake Phil or Nat until it was necessary, and not really wanting to peel himself away from either of them, anyway.
"We could have Jarvis tell them," Bruce decided with a smile. He doubted that Coulson, Nat, or Clint would come to the party. They'd all likely had enough of the god. He wondered if Scott and Logan would allow themselves to be dragged into it, as well. "I don't want to give them a guilt trip. Just see who shows up. We can even invite Ward and May since they definitely pulled their weight on this one. I guess if nothing else, the three of us could have a quiet night of popcorn and high fantasy. And actually going to sleep and not waking up until we're done."
"Uhm, shouldn't you guys be after the protein bars or something?"
Despite the man’s larger bulk, Coulson’s instincts were solid. He brought a knee up into Bucky’s stomach and, when his grip loosened slightly, ducked out of the hold. As he straightened again, Phil brought out a taser and held up a hand. “This thing can take down the big green guy. Now might be the time to think about calming down.” Despite his tie being disheveled from the hold and his posture being tense, Coulson sounded calm in the face of the apparent danger. “Mr. Barnes, I need you to think about what you’re doing right now.”
Unable to get a decent grip on Tony's wheelchair, Clint stood back and looked to Coulson. They didn't all need to sit at Steve's bedside, but he'd be damned if he'd leave even Tony Stark to face something like this completely alone.
"If the gurney happened to fall down an elevator shaft while on fire," Coulson began in a carefully neutral tone that still got him a raised eyebrow from Natasha, "I'm just saying that I happen to know what paperwork to file in that eventuality. That's all." It was damn hard escorting the man when he really would just as soon have been dumping a body as booking him. It was a pretty fact, but it was true just the same. Only an abiding sense of duty and a desire to not end up in prison himself kept Coulson from making the call. That and the fact that he knew he needed to stick to his guns if he expected Clint to do the same.
"He's alive! Oh, this..." Jemma could think of no other way to express how she felt but with a broad smile.
Tony shivered at the feeling of that darkened gaze upon him, the possession there. Part of him bristled at the idea of being used as nothing more than a toy, but that part of him was getting quieter with every graceful shift of Loki's body. The god felt too good to deny. Tony hadn't missed the effect he'd had on his partner, and he tugged lightly at Loki's nipple with his teeth before shifting to the other one, dragging his tongue across the hard nub before covering it with his mouth. His fingers pressed a little deeper into Loki's body, questing for that one perfect spot inside him.
A few moments later, as if on cue, and Loki and his escorts were stepping into the lab.
"I should imagine so. You're not too stupid to realize that he could kill you one day, and yet you keep him." Loki shook his head as if he was utterly unable to understand what SHIELD was thinking. It boggled his mind to think that anyone would purposefully keep around a creature that could destroy them. It had hadn't served Thor well, after all. Reaching out, Loki ran a hand down Stark's arm, curious to watch his reaction. This time he couldn't pretend it was Rogers. He was wearing his own face. "Then again, I suppose I haven't exactly thrown Creed out of bed either, so perhaps there's something to keeping a pet monster in the house."
"But we don't know what," Clint put in. He had his war face on, but internally he was near panic. He still had nightmares of losing it and killing other agents, other Avengers.
"You have to try the pumpkin," Simmons insisted, stepping up to the counter and ordering for both of them without thinking. She did it most of the time, making coffee runs for herself and Fitz, and only afterward realized it might be a bit pushy. "Sorry. Habit. Bad habit, probably. It's actually been... well, since I got out of the academy, I haven't had much time for dating. SHIELD is rather all encompassing, I find." Normally she absolutely adored the challenge of being presented with one truly impossible puzzle after another, but there were days when Simmons wondered how she was supposed to make a life of her own when it seemed that SHIELD owned every inch of her.
Phil's breath was ragged despite his best efforts to control it. It hurt too much for him to relax properly, which only made the pain worse. He prayed that Clint wasn't looking but didn't dare look himself to be sure one way or the other. He just wanted Clint to be okay. He wanted not to hear what Victor was saying and not to be forced to acknowledge that the man had a point. He wouldn't be able to forget it. He couldn't do that. //But I can live. I can live through this, and so can Clint.// Phil clung desperately to that idea and tried to let it be the light in the dark.
Steve could barely begin to express his gratitude. "I owe you. Big. Like, waxing Lola for a year or..." He shook his head, still smiling, and gave Tony's hand a squeeze.
Victor shrugged. "Dunno. Are all you Asgaardians into wearing drapes and antlers?" He shrugged, turning and leaning back against the cell bars, clearly unconcerned about Natasha or what she might try. "Besides, I'll take what's on offer sometimes, too. You offerin'?"
"And why should Bruce be here?" Tony groaned as he began to stir. Every inch of his body hurt, and he moved his fingers reflexively in Steve's grasp. No bones broken as far as he could tell. A few cracked ribs, maybe. He hoped being buried under a mound of crystal hadn't punctured one of his lungs. Tony could already tell he was having difficulty breathing. His vision blurred, but he could just make out Steve's concerned features through fluttering eyelids. "Did the whole damned roof fall down on my head?"
The door closed quietly, and Phil tried to look utterly at ease as he climbed back into the safety of Lola's driver's seat. "You're lucky you didn't get your mind melted," he commented as they started back toward home.
Feeling bad for the guy, Scott offered, "Not that it's any of my business, but... there are worse things to have get around the water cooler." He shrugged. "You could choose to look at this as excellent personal publicity."
"I wouldn't." Tony pointed to the cuffs, already having located stashed blueberries from the lab and popping them into his mouth. "Stark tech. Piss them off enough and they tighten up for awhile. Fury's not screwing around."
"Some good vodka sounds like the perfect way to end a lovely day," Natasha smiled as she finally stepped away from Clint. Her work wasn't done, but things were moving in the right direction, at least.
"Bruce has a sense of humor. I can tell. He kind of smirked a little once," Tony said, leaning against Steve. "And you smell like Old Spice and Brylcreem. Which I didn't even know they made anymore."
Logan sniffed at the air. Nothing but the city and the loosed zoo animals. //What's a god smell like, anyway?// he wondered to himself, taking Scott's direction. He froze after a few steps. There was an eerie sort of keening hum coming from the west, pitched so high even he could barely hear it. "There's somethin' that way," he said, pointing toward the tiger habitats.
Scott wasted not a moment in leaning in to kiss Logan soundly. The day had been downright joyful overall, and he was buzzed from it in addition to being exhausted from the tension that led up to the good parts and the lingering uncertainty about whether they'd manage to get Barton back into his right mind without breaking him. "Dinner? I'm not really hungry, but I'll sit with you while you eat. Or we can snack in your room. Or... just..." He let his forehead fall against Logan's shoulder with a sigh. "Let's be not with people, huh? I'm tired of people."
Tony looked almost pained as he nodded his assent. "Yeah. Not in the mood for a performance piece tonight," he said. It was a fair bet that at least a few in the crowd knew who they were, and an even fairer bet that a few cellphones had recorded what just happened. Tony couldn't have cared less, but he was sure that Steve might not be as big a fan of the world wide web being plastered with pictures of them necking. "Think we should collect the angry badger and get outta here?"
Clint offered Nat a wan smile. He liked the idea of unwinding on the range too. He would've rather not had company, but he wasn't going to argue. He figured the relative intimacy of the night before had probably filled the woman's quota for the month. "We still have those Loki-shaped targets? I think that'd make me feel even better."
Steve’s jaw clenched at the words. He wished that they were true, that the only action Bucky had seen had been in the 40s, long ago and far away. Instead he let out a long, slow breath and ventured, “That might not be true. We don’t know what Hydra might have had you do. You were with them for so long, Bucky… it could’ve been anything. If you’re starting to remember, just let it come. The more we know, the better, even if it hurts.” As the man’s friend, Steve just wanted to tell him to forget it all and try to move on. As the leader of the Avengers, Steve knew they didn’t have that luxury if they wanted to catch the people who had masterminded the attacks on Tony.
Tony felt Steve losing a little of his careful control, felt the kiss turning almost bruising. He didn't care. He needed everything Steve had to offer. In truth, a fair part of the parade of women he'd had around lately had been to try and distract himself from what he really wanted. He couldn’t shake the worry about things going the way they had with Pepper. Impulsiveness had, as usual, won the day with Tony. It was too late to hold back. Drawing back to speak-and because he was pretty sure he'd lost circulation to his lips-he panted, "Touch me. Don't make me beg." Another pant. "Please."
Loki read the warring emotions in Tony's face without any great difficulty. "You don't need to look so worried. Even if your compatriots were to swoop in and rescue you, there's no need for them to know any of this." He smiled, his bright blue gaze dancing with amusement. "Our little secret," Loki whispered as he leaned in for another lingering kiss. Stark wanted him, and he didn't want to feel that way. That was fine as long as he didn't let his higher nature talk him out of having a good time. They both needed it in entirely different ways. In one fluid motion, Loki went from sitting next to the man on the bed to climbing onto his lap, arms draped lightly over Stark's shoulders.
It was a relief to have it brought up so casually, and Steve smiled his gratitude. "Yeah. Really good. Better than I thought we could be." He'd spent a lot of time losing things since his return and feeling utterly out of place. "I finally feel like I'm the right place and the right time, and..." He cast an apologetic glance at Clint, "and I feel awful feeling so good when things are such a mess."
Phil blushed and decided, "Let's go with some more making out under the tree. I don't think I've had enough beer to think a tattoo is a good idea." He rose and snagged his bottle, gathering the trash and then tossing it into the barrel nearby. He knew without testing the theory that Clint would have left it all on the table. Phil had never been able to divorce himself from thinking about who would have to clean it up after working a stint as a janitor in high school. "Besides," he added as they headed toward the grassy area again, "I'd get an arrow."
Clint wanted to squirm under Coulson's scrutiny. He felt his pulse spike as he gathered his thoughts to explain. "I... the hammer for one thing," he said. "And... and Loki." He wrapped his hands around his coffee mug as if holding onto it might somehow keep him on an even keel. "He... I don't know what that new staff does, but he was going to either kill me or p..." he swallowed hard, "...possess me again. And you." He took a shaky breath, taking a few more seconds to gather his thoughts as he stared a hole through one of the walls. He finally looked back to Coulson. "If it hadn't been for the hammer, both of us... but... we were on the plane, and I could already feel it eating away at me." He stared at his coffee. "Not sure I'm more afraid of losing my teammates or losing myself." It had been more terrifying, he realized, that it had been Coulson. His handler was the one person that Clint was comfortable with aside from Nat. The two of them meant everything to him. The idea that he wouldn't have been able to save Phil without the hammer was utterly terrifying.
(See the end of the chapter for
"That's the easy part. Just remember that we're going to be seeing things that we can never unsee." Coulson led the way to his own room, a modest but comfortable suite that looked like an odd cross between a library and the room of a twelve year old boy. There were framed posters mixed with leather bound volumes of Shakespeare, but Coulson walked past it all to a study filled with file cabinets, a sleek computer, and a collection of monitors. It took a few keystrokes to bring one of the monitors to life, and they were looking into Logan's suite. "Just don't say I didn't warn you. Anyone who's ever had to watch Stark for any length of time has had to get therapy."
The archer started awake, momentarily confused as to where he was. When he finally figured it out, he also remembered he owed Coulson coffee. The archer rolled off the couch and dragged himself into the kitchen. It wasn't hard to find what he needed; the place was meticulously organized. Hoping Coulson liked his coffee as brutally strong as Clint did, the archer put a considerable serving of grounds in the maker and then settled at the bar and quietly waited for it to brew.
"You knew all this time? Wait, of course you did," Tony said, leaving the wheelchair behind. It was sobering to think that Steve would need it at all, nevermind that he needed it more than Tony. Still, Tony was too happy that Steve was going to be in his bed again soon to let it dampen his mood much. He made sure the brakes were set on the chair, then raised an eyebrow at Steve. "Need a hand?" Tony had to fight the urge to coddle his lover. He knew it wouldn't do Steve any favors to treat him like he was made of glass. He also didn't want Steve to think that Tony was unwilling to help him in any way he could.
"If I was too dumb to know that, I don't think you'd even be here with me," Darien countered as he took hold of Clint's hips. The man was hard and ready, and he started in without giving Clint a second to adjust. Clint could play all the games he wanted, but Darien wasn't in doubt about his own skills and worth. He knew he could drive Clint just as crazy as the man drove him. He sucked hard and then pulled back until Clint's cock almost left his mouth only to dive forward again until it bumped against the back of his throat.
Coulson was glad Clint had the strength to let go like should have already. He gave a shake of his head, not a negation, exactly, but a way of giving himself a moment to get steady. He took a few slow breaths and finally managed, "Yeah. Lucky." He felt lucky to be alive, but he wasn't sure how far that feeling went. It didn't feel right sometimes. The spell cast by the place had been broken. "We should head back. Check and see if Tony and Bruce have found anything." Before they faced Loki again, he wanted Natasha fighting with them. "We're going to fix this, and we're going to beat Loki with Thor's help or without it."
"Don't make me separate you two," Bruce called from the corner.
Steve had the grace to blush at being called out. "Give us a half hour, Clint." He knew he couldn't afford to let Tony stay with him no matter how much he wanted it, but that didn't mean he was above insisting on keeping Tony to himself for a short period of time. "Bruce could use the breather anyway." There would be no good argument to that and Steve damn well knew it.
Loki threw the ruby lenses down at Logan's feet the moment he appeared again. "Done. Let it never be said service here is less than prompt." His salesman's smile broadened. "Don't let her tell you otherwise. Still feeling well? I'd hate to send you home worse for wear than when I found you."
Logan looked around the room as if subconsciously expecting to see some visible manifestation of the AI in question. "So, basically, you're tellin' me you gotta build your friends?"
The kiss was enough to leave Phil pleasantly breathless and to bring a blush to his cheeks. He didn't miss Natasha smirking to herself, but she kept her gaze on the screen, giving them a faint illusion of privacy despite the fact that she was more or less inside their personal space. Considering how close the three of them were - they'd tried every sexual combination possible between themselves - it didn't feel as horribly embarrassing as it probably should have. It made Phil self conscious, but it didn't stop him from laying another slow, sensual kiss on Clint's lips.
Despite the immediate vote down, Coulson couldn't help but feel grateful that Natasha had even put a vote in his direction. The Avengers required something less polished and less administrative than a SHIELD team of the normal variety might. "Barton has the most combat experience of anyone here that's still on the list, excepting Logan."
Logan didn't take too much note of the random voice, figuring out easily that it was some sort of A.I. Besides, there were better things to focus on. He grabbed Steve and pulled the blonde into a long, eager kiss. When he withdrew, he grinned and opened his mouth to give the man a compliment when a blue glow caught his attention. "Woah... What the hell...?"
The mutant just laughed, holding out the transporter. He sobered quickly enough, though. "You two are gettin' outta here. Sorta." He eyed Clint up and down, smirking when he caught the faint twitch in response. "Don't look so excited. Loki's not lettin' me have a goodbye fuck. Shame, too. Would've liked to make you moan a few more times." Without giving the two a chance to think it over, Creed grabbed them both and activated the transporter.
Drawing himself up straight, Steve took a step closer. "Hello. I don't suppose your boss has any messages about what he wants?"
"Sirs, it's time-"
Logan wasn't sure he could have stopped if he'd tried. Leaning forward and settling his weight on hands planted to either side of Scott's torso, he began slowly thrusting, shivering as the pleasure thrummed through him. Leaning down, he brushed his lips against Scott's before nipping roughly at his throat. It was hard to keep perfect control, to keep from simply pounding Scott into the mattress. The man awakened every instinct, every desire within Logan.
Darien shivered at the intensity of Clint's gaze but found himself agreeing, "Yeah... yours. I'm yours," almost immediately. The words spilled forth of their own volition, but Darien didn't regret them. He was pretty sure he wouldn't have regretted anything that kept Clint interested in fucking him. His muscles clenched down hard around Clint's cock in a silent plea for more movement. Darien was smart enough not to demand anything, though. He was far gone, but not so far gone that he was ready to risk pissing Clint off just to cum. Not yet.
Tony's mind was still firmly in his suite with Steve when he got to the lab, and he barely said anything to anyone for several minutes as he settled into his desk. When Bruce cleared his throat at him, Tony looked up sharply. "Oh, uh... Anything new, kids?"
Watching Victor touch Clint made him feel sick. He'd always reacted poorly to his agents being hurt, but Clint was more than that. They'd woken up together that morning to the sound of Fury's ring tone, and they'd curled up together the night before. That Victor knew it made the situation more maddening. "Leave him alone. If you want to play with somebody, start with me." Phil had no real plan. He couldn't stand up to Victor on a physical level. Neither of them could, frankly, and anyone who could best Clint in a fight was likely to be able to take him without much trouble too. Which meant that the best he could hope to do was buy them time.
Bruce's eyebrows raised a little. He hadn't thought of it that way. "Well, strange as it sounds, that would be more reassuring than the alternative." When the pair looked at him, Bruce shrugged. "That being that Tony Stark has Stockholm syndrome and that Thor's even dumber than we initially thought." He smiled faintly. "But you're right, Jemma." He'd completely forgotten that he probably should have at least called her by her last name in front of Fitz. "If he wanted to get away or at least make sure he wasn't killed, he could have done a lot of things differently. Hell, he could have posed as Tony."
Loki took a step back. He wasn't sure Sif could kill him before someone else could intervene, but he also wasn't entirely sure anyone else would intervene. "As Mr. Stark pointed out, I may be of some use in aiding Mr. Barton with his," Loki flicked a glance at the archer and his glowing gaze. It was familiar, and he looked away again. Guilt had its own time and place, but this was not it, "With his condition. Excellent as he feels now, he will feel a thousand times worse than where he began once he sets down the hammer. Isn't that right, brother?"
The words had sent a chill even through Jemma's body. She could barely imagine what the loss felt like for Bruce. "We won't have it done in time for this round, but if he decides to keep using the suit, we can certainly see what can be done with integrating things, perhaps even... well, perhaps modifying the suit that Mr. Stark was working on. He's left some notes, a few bits of programming. Stark Industries owns most of it, but I suspect that Ms. Potts might release a thing or two for the sake of keeping Captain Rogers safe." They'd reached the tower, but Jemma was reluctant to pull away. "If you... it sounds silly, but if you need anything? Just come by. I'll probably be in the lab half the night anyway. I find I don't sleep a great deal before days like tomorrow."
"Always," Coulson agreed without any hesitation at all, "though I suspect you're underestimating Clint."
It was a couple of hours before Logan calmed enough to feel he could talk to Scott again. He wasn't sure what to think of what had happened, but he wanted to give Scott the benefit of the doubt. He let himself into the man's suite, stalking back to Scott's bedroom. "You okay?" he asked, leaning against the door frame.
Coulson smirked at the reference. "That it is." He led the group over. A retinal scan, thumbprint recognition, and a few codes later they were inside. It was marginally warmer, and Coulson shed his coat onto a rack just inside. It was an oddly homey touch in the otherwise sterile building. "Might as well get comfortable. It may take awhile to go through all of this."
"Steve," Tony said his lover's name gently, taking the hand from his chest and threading their fingers together. He pressed their foreheads together, looking into bright blue eyes. "Listen, I know I've taken a lot of crazy ass risks. But I thought about it yesterday, and... I can barely handle thinking about how much it'd hurt you if something happened to me. I'm not scared of dying, not that much. But I am scared of leaving you." He took a deep breath. "I don't plan to go into things with a bomb strapped to me, but... I seem to recall someone telling me that there's not always a way out. We can't keep letting Loki get away. He's eventually going to succeed and then it's a lot bigger than you, me, or even SHIELD. I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that the whole team comes back, but if I have to, Steve, I'm gonna lay down on that wire."
"I want you to fuck me," Scott panted on cue. He actually trembled at Logan's breath against his ear and the commanding tone of his lover's voice. "Please, baby, I need you." He didn't want to leave Natasha out, but she didn't matter for the moment. Nothing mattered but having Logan sliding inside him.
Tony rubbed at his wrists, wondering just what that might mean. Deciding to test the waters, he stood, swaying a little, his hand pressed against the nearest solid object. "Well, I'm sure it'll grow back. People like you have a tendency to do that when you're not killed thoroughly," he observed, feeling a little breathless as he worked to hold himself upright. It wasn't as tough as he expected, but it still wasn't a world of fun. "Good to know I didn't skip hours of sleep and sex with my boyfriend with nothing to show for it."
The idea of leaving cut Tony like a knife, but he knew Steve was right. They both needed the rest. Tony risked leaning up a little to press another kiss to Steve's forehead as he held the pad in hand, smiling at the last footnote. The relaxed, caring smile was one he hadn't worn in a long, long time, but it came unbidden when Steve professed his love, even in writing. "Alright. I'll go rest. For you. Just you," he promised. He started to hand the notepad back to Steve, then stopped. He carefully tore the small corner off, the last two words Steve had written, folded it neatly, and then placed it into his wallet. "Love you, too," he returned as he did so. He pressed one more kiss to Steve's forehead, then drew back a little and quirked an eyebrow at the blonde. "You’ve gotta get out of here before I get better. I think there were plans about what I was gonna do to you once I get the stitches out," he said, winking a before he carefully rolled the wheelchair back out into the hallway with Coulson. "Any chance of catching a lift back to my room?" he asked.
"Thank you," Scott answered, too tired and overwrought to be anything but stiffly formal. He swallowed and climbed into bed next to Logan. Once upon a time, the man wouldn't have so much as said a kind word to him in such a situation, let alone given up half his bed. Scott should have been ashamed of his own weakness, and he was in a way, but it felt too good having someone close to let himself overthink it. Instead Scott closed his eyes and finally drifted into an exhausted sleep.
While Clint looked shell-shocked, Natasha looked damn near turned on. She hit the button to bring the targets forward and whistled low at the sight of it. "I like your style, Summers," was all she said, but her smile spoke of plans already being made somewhere in the back of her head.
"Okay, for starters, Liberace... First time we've met. Second thing, you're a little crazier than they warned me about if you think I'm volunteerin' someone to join me. And third," he popped his claws, "you didn't do yer homework." The feral mutant swiped the blades at the bars to the cage, fully expecting them to go through it like it was nothing. A sharp blast of blue light and a pained howl filled the room as Logan was thrown violently back against the rear wall of the cell. He shook his head as he caught the brief scent of burning meat, //That's me,// and shoved himself unsteadily back up to his feet. He glared at the god, teeth clenched as he fought back stupid rage that'd likely just get him cooked even more.
"I put him up in the room next to mine," Steve informed the man, realizing they hadn't really followed any sort of procedure in terms of signing Logan in or setting up lodgings.
Phil was more than slightly disoriented by the shift. For someone used to knowing precisely where he was and what was going on around him at all times, it was not in the least bit pleasant. He stumbled as they hit normal flooring and locked his gaze with Clint's. He took a breath to steady himself and continued to watch Clint for any sign of injury rather than looking at their captor. "So you have us. I'm assuming there's more to this plan than all of us sitting around and making small talk?"
"It would be good to be there. It's good having something to do." He caught the odd expression on Logan's face and made note to talk to him later. He met Clint's gaze and gave a hint of a smile, though it was far sadder than the one he'd offered earlier. "Funny how strange it is being around people. I guess I kind of went off on my own there for a bit."
"You could start with me," Tony offered as Logan dove in to raise a hickey on Steve's neck. The smallest of the three of them managed to wiggle between Logan and Steve.
"No you haven't," Coulson answered calmly. He felt anything but. Coming so close to Barton being lost to something from Asgard again filled him with the closest thing he'd felt to panic in a long while. "Limited contact with this thing. We get it inside and we get it to the science team. Dr. Banner, you're welcome to accompany it down... but don't touch it. No skin on skin if we can help it from anyone."
Scott wanted to protest, but he couldn't find the breath to do so. It was probably for the best since otherwise Clint would have just taken it as an excuse to torture him. He settled for moaning helplessly as Clint fucked him. The angle meant that Clint's cock drove hard into his prostate with every thrust, and it was almost impossible not to let go. Scott's toes curled, and his whole body felt like it was on fire with sensation. "C-clint... god, please... please..."
Though Phil certainly appreciated the bravado, he knew better. The reason Loki was dangerous wasn't his near-immortality or his strength, it was the fact that he knew how to manipulate people at least as well as Natasha, which was a pointedly terrifying idea. "If it helps, I promise not to go toe to toe with any gods unattended this time."
"Ramble all you need to," Coulson answered, smiling warmly in response. He would have been lying if he said he hadn't wondered the same thing for a few horrifying seconds. They'd passed the minute he saw Stark break down crying on the man's bed. Tony was in love - actually, really in love - and Coulson felt relatively safe in saying nothing was going to break that, at least not easily. "He's probably going to have doubts about a lot of things even when he's feeling better. It can't be easy to have your whole sense of self pulled out from under you in the space of a few minutes. He hasn't had to deal with asthma and normal aches and pains in years even if you don't count the time on ice."
Logan slid into the shower next to Scott, listening intently to the man and trying to work out how to tell Scott that Loki had done them a favor. Or at least claimed to. What Scott was saying backed that theory up. "He just took your glasses?" Logan asked, brow furrowed. "He told me he fixed your... Uh... Your injury."
Clint let himself get caught up in the contact, nearly forgetting Nat was there even as his hand tightened on her waist a little. His tongue cautiously worked its way into Phil's mouth, exploring gently as he felt his skin flush. He actually whimpered softly before he realized just how much he was enjoying the contact, then drew away a little guiltily, eyes searching Phil's face. He knew it was delicate for them both, and he didn't want Phil to feel pressured or worse to bring up the trauma they'd both just endured.
Though Steve felt the tears pricking his eyes again, he ignored them in favor of clinging to Tony and trying to soothe him through his pain. He could only imagine the fear he'd felt and didn't even want to ask what Loki might have done or said while they were alone. Shivering, he clung to his lover and tried to forget everything but the fact that Tony was safe and alive and in his arms. "You're here, and I'm here, and I'm not letting you go again. I won't, Tony. Not ever. I swear to God, I won't ever let you go." His voice broke, and he stopped trying to talk or do anything but hang on for dear life.
That was the general idea, and Scott took more of the other man into his mouth. He loved the pressure of Logan's hand on his own. It let him feel other, smaller signs of what the man was experiencing. He could feel Logan's hand twitch when his tongue swiped beneath the head of Logan's cock. He felt the muscles of his thighs tense as he pulled back and then forward again just as quickly. All in all, making Logan feel good was pretty fantastic. Watching him feel good, the loll of his head on the couch and the tensing of his body, was even better.
"No, Jarvis, it's fine." Talking to the computer was odd, but it made him feel closer to Tony. He liked that a lot. "What did you want to show me?" He felt his throat closing up at the sight of the clutter. There were half-full coffee cups, some with various colors of mold clinging to their insides. More electronics than he could identify littered every surface. He saw no fewer than a dozen completely ridiculous-looking things that might well have been robots, and a toaster that looked like it was being modified to some state that made Steve frankly uneasy. It looked as if Tony could walk in any second with a snarky remark and a smile. "Jarvis?"
Victor's lips parted, his breath hitching softly as he watched Loki work. He looked perfect there, kneeling before the feral mutant. Victor couldn't help but thrill at the thought that a god was on the floor, sucking him off. And Loki looked like he was enjoying every minute of it. Heeding Loki's earlier words, Victor cradled the back of Loki's head in one rough hand and pulled him forward, watching his hardening shaft disappear under those perfect lips.
Logan's hands settled on her narrow waist for a moment, just enjoying the feeling of her perfectly toned body moving fluidly against him in response to Scott's attentions. Slowly, he moved his hands up to the curve of her breasts, fingers tweaking her nipples. He pressed himself firmly against her back, letting her feel the swell of his arousal against her ass through his jeans as he leaned down to lick and suck at her neck. He could hear her pulse accelerate as Scott's tongue started working her. "Guess he is just as good," he rumbled in her ear, sounding more amused than surprised. One of his hands strayed down to run through Scott's hair and Logan's hazel eyes stayed fixed on his lover over Natasha's shoulder as Scott worked his magic.
As if in answer to Phil's wishes, Clint slipped through the doors, looking more relaxed if no less worried. "She's in pain, but she's not in any danger," he said, then tilted his head at Coulson. "We need to talk." His gaze flicked to Logan. "Alone."
Scott let out an unconscious groan at the prompt, his hips moving desperately against Logan's hand. He supposed it was true. He'd heard plenty of repulsive things hissed at him while he was in the hands of the slavers, but that had been something different. It had all been about power and fear. This was about giving himself up and trusting Logan completely. There was no real comparison. "Yeah," he gasped, "j-just for you... just for you, baby."
Sif took the suggestion in stride. "It is a plan as good as any we have yet made." She led them carefully into the palace. As promised, there were enough guards aiding in their entry that it was a relatively simple task to get inside. A good way down from the lady's chambers, Sif turned to them. "Magneto will be with her. He will be ready. We must be as well. On my mark, we shall advance into the room. He must be restrained at once. The lady may well be able to assist us with her own skills if she is well and whole enough to do so."
"Wonder how Scott's doing with Lady Sif. She seems... interesting, actually," Natasha observed. The woman was icy cold in battle, but she didn't seem like a bad sort. Of course maybe that was just the fact that she hated Loki with equal passion. It was the kind of thing that made Natasha feel closer to anyone. She eyed Clint carefully. "You and Coulson should get some rest, hit the showers. We can baby-sit him the rest of the way down."
By the time a nurse came in to show him to Tony's room, Steve felt sick to his stomach. He'd ignored every call from Fury and only answered texts from Pepper. Still Steve forced a wan smile when he saw Tony stretched out on the bed. "Hey... how are you feeling?"
"I'm guessing you're not here to give out hugs," Bruce observed, eyeing Loki before giving Jemma a conspiratorial smile.
Clint glowered at Logan but stood down. "There's something off about him, Coulson. He's been compromised." The archer looked somewhere between scared and wishing he had his bow with him. //Not that it'd do much against that guy,// Clint realized.
Tony strained to reach his tablet, fingers grabbing uselessly at the air for a few moments before he sagged back into his lover. "You... are insufferable," he grouched, though didn't actually sound offended. He glanced at Steve, admiring his face in the dim light of the reactor. He lightly carded his fingers through Steve's hair before slowly drifting off, his hand resting lightly against his lover's cheek.
Tony couldn't help but grin broadly at the rough grab at his ass. "You're cute when you're impatient," he decided, pressing his lips to Steve's as his fingers skillfully unfastened the man's jeans completely blind. Shoving the rough fabric down around Steve's thighs along with the blonde's underwear, Tony slid his hand down Steve's lean stomach to palm his cock, watching bright blue eyes. It fascinated him to no end to watch the bright hues darken with arousal.
Natasha looked to Bruce. He was on the edge. She could see it in the tension of his shoulders and the way he held himself, as if he was afraid stepping the wrong way might wake the Other Guy up. "Be ready. If she can't zap him back to normal, we try the hitting him on the head thing. You're pretty much the only one who can do that without taking some bad hits themselves." Some of the assembled warriors made noises of protest, but Natasha simply arched an eyebrow at them. "One of you boys mind taking care of him?" she inquired, nodding toward Magneto. "We'll pick him up on the way home."
"C-contrary to popular belief, turnabout is actually really mean," Tony pointed out breathlessly, his fingers pressing against the wall as if doing so would somehow help him retain his grip on reality. Seeing Steve Rogers kneeling on the floor, looking up at him with darkened blue eyes, was almost enough to make him lose all his sanity. Knowing that Steve wouldn't relent until he'd had his revenge, Tony finally managed, "I think you were gonna suck me off... but if you changed your mind, I'll be needing a straight jacket."
"You are honestly amazing. Thank you." Steve tucked into the meal with relish despite the fact that he hadn't thought he was that hungry before Tony started cooking. "Do you think Logan will be willing to take that thing on again?" It was one thing risking your life for a lover or a teammate and another thing going up against a god for more nebulous purposes. "Even taking into account the idea of revenge, it's dangerous."
If he hadn't seemed so damned sincere, it would have been smarmy. As it was, Nat found the whole thing kind of funny. "Thanks. Now let's go wake up Thor before his brother can do anymore damage."
About the time Tony's teeth caught on his nipple the man's fingers also found the mark. The effect was immediate and electric, a shudder running through Loki's body and a needy moan escaping his lips. He wasn't playing things up for effect, but he wasn't holding back either. He wanted Stark to know just how good it felt. All of his skin had taken on a faint, powder blue tone with darker patches slowly creeping in. There were odd lines threading through the whole of it, an underlying pattern emerging on the surface. Loki's lips parted, and he slowly smiled. "I almost hate for you to stop, but I rather like the thought of what you'll do next."
"Well, uhm, I think we might be stuck with the suit now," Tony reminded Steve. "But since I get to say when it makes an appearance, I think we can still keep this exclusive. Fiji's nice. Or I could buy an island. Which one would you like?" he asked, dead serious. As he talked, Tony ran his hand over Steve's abs, dipping it teasingly low before moving it to much more innocent territory. He knew Steve would have nothing serious for the moment, but it didn't hurt to remind the blonde of more intimate play.
"About exactly as long as you really need it, and we both know that won't keep me here." Steve wanted to take Loki down for everything the alleged god had done, but he wanted just as badly to remain by Tony's side every step of his recovery. "Doesn't mean we can't make good use of the time we get. If we do this right, you might end up with some fond memories of these injuries."
"Fourteen, asshole."
This is one of the chapters (along with the next one) that makes that dubious consent tag needed. The events are important to the plot overall, but skim the smut if you think that might be a bad scene for you.
It hurt like hell to watch Clint suffer. The whole ordeal had been painful. Phil had spent it sitting with his forehead on his knees and his arms curled around his legs. He didn't want to see. It was bad enough hearing the moans and gasps, some of them pain and some of them even more disturbing to consider. As soon as the cell door closed, he uncurled and reached out to soothe a hand over Clint's back. He drifted away to grab the leftover shredded parts of his shirt and rinse them with the water, passing one into Clint's hand so that he could wash his face off and holding the other for the rest of the cleaning that Clint would likely want to do. "Breathe for me, Clint. Just hold on."
Tony couldn't help the somewhat undignified whimper that slipped out of him at that last. "Fuck, Steve," he breathed, hand tangling in Steve's hair to jerk him into a rough kiss. "It's entirely too hot when you talk dirty," he decided, using his weight to more or less pin Steve to the bed. He nibbled at Steve's neck before starting to slowly kiss his way downward, nipping at the blonde's slender body before he slid his hands down to part his lover's ass cheeks. Tony's tongue was prodding lightly at Steve's entrance before the blonde could have a chance to figure out what was coming.
Bruce smirked. "Kinda refreshing."
"Hey, woah... What's *that* supposed to mean?" Logan asked, though he seemed more amused than anything. He knew that his relationship with Scott wasn't the most likely looking thing to ever happen. In fact, he was pretty sure that if anyone in the mansion found out, they'd probably faint from the surprise. Still... Since Nat was mostly occupying the front half of Scott on the dance floor, Logan slid in behind his lover, leaning over Scott's shoulder to look the woman in the eye. "Does it really seem that insane?"
"Sir, Director Fury was very specific. You're benched," the woman replied. Though the blond would have barely cleared Tony's shoulder standing, her expression brooked no protest.
Logan tensed. "I didn't want to explain it all to Fury. The bastard asks too many questions," he explained. He moved closer to his lover, running a hand through Scott's damp hair and nuzzling his neck. "You need this. You deserve to have something good."
The archer took a shuddering gasp, trying to calm himself as Darien rammed Clint's throbbing shaft down his throat like he was starving for it. "Fuck!" he gasped, his knees shaking as he fought to hold himself up. It was rare he got someone so willing to do just as he asked, who didn't chicken out the first time Clint demanded something unusual from them. "Fuck, your throat... feels so good..." he breathed, already feeling close to the edge.
"No, boy scout, I'm afraid not, given that you don't even know my boss." She glanced to the woods from which she'd appeared. "Why don't you come out in introduce yourselves." Turning her attention back to the group, the woman added, "I'm Mystique."
"Except all the books can kill you," Bobby piped up, lifting a strange-looking thing he suspected was some kind of gun. "Probably. I'm not even sure what half this stuff is."
Clint had to struggle to pick from among several ideas that sprang to mind. Finally, his eyes fell on the armchair in one corner of the suite's living room, and he smiled faintly before looking back at Darien. He dragged the man to his feet and over to the chair. Settling onto it, he gave his cock a few lazy strokes, leaning back and giving Darien an imperious look. He patted one leather-clad thigh with his free hand. "Straddle me," he murmured, his voice a low, commanding purr.
In which Phil & Clint bond and Fury gets an idea of what Loki wants.
"Hmm... big, gorgeous blonde teddy bear to cuddle all night?" Tony tugged Steve close and pressed a steamy kiss to the  taller man's lips, heedless of the security cameras he knew were in the elevator. "I think I'm alright with that." The elevator slid to a halt, and Tony more or less dragged his companion to his suite. "But gotta sleep. Not up for more fooling around. Yet." Tony practically walked out of his clothes and into the bedroom, flopping into the massive bed and holding his arms out. "Hold me? Kinda cold in here."
Loki sighed and ran a hand through the woman's flame-red hair. She shuddered, eyes still squeezed shut, but didn't lash out. "This could have been so much easier. I told you that fighting would only hurt you." He continued to stroke her hair for a moment and then rose. The Avengers would be less than pleased. Loki couldn't help but smile faintly at the thought. After what they'd done to him, the humiliation he'd endured at their hands, it was the least he could do to pay back the favor. "I'll still send you home, my dear. What's left of you." Loki cast his gaze over the Widow once more and strode away from the cell, not so much as glancing back.
Scott didn't really care how they looked. He enjoyed swaying to the music with his arms slung around Logan's neck and their bodies indecently close. The rest was details.
"I knew I liked you." Phil poured himself a cup and appraised Clint carefully. "Thanks to you, this one may even live."
Politely disregarding the more awkward parts of the conversation, Bruce held up a tablet for display. "Still getting a good energy profile on it. It's kind of hard to do."
Natasha nodded. "Okay," she agreed simply. "For now, how about something to eat?" The pair had been holed up alone in Phil's suite almost exclusively since their return from what she'd heard. They needed to get out in the world and be reminded of the people who cared about them. She smiled faintly at Thor. "Lunch sound good to you?"
"There could be charges. While I'm not opposed to escaping from the police, I don't want to have to meet with Fury first thing in the morning." Natasha found buzzed Scott rather charming. He was cute to start with, but relaxed and unencumbered by his recent experiences, he was pretty adorable. She let her hand drift up his leg while she tossed back another shot. Natasha grabbed one more from the tray and sent Clint a quick text, I'LL OWE YOU CAB MONEY. HAVE PLANS FOR THE NIGHT. She was feeling pleasantly buzzed herself.
Clint bit his tongue, hoping the pain would distract him from the touches. Phil's voice filtered through a moment later, and he latched onto that mentally. When it was over, Phil would be there for him. That was all that mattered. The feel of Creed's tongue dragging across one of his nipples made him arch and tense and claw at the hand holding him down. The archer bared his teeth and made a strangled sound of protest. Reflexively, he started to beg Creed to stop, but bit the words back, knowing they'd just encourage the mutant. Bright blue eyes fixed on the ceiling as he felt his pants tugged away, and Clint did his best to breathe and think of anything but what was happening.
It felt like they were walking the green mile, and Coulson didn't care for it. He'd sworn immediately to Clint that he wouldn't let the man touch the gun, and he wouldn't. He just didn't want Steve touching it either. He noticed that Bruce hung back in the lab, which was probably for the best. The Hulk tended to gravitate toward Tony, and considering there was very little chance of Tony not getting upset, it would be at best a volatile situation. There were all silent on the walk because no one knew what to say. Coulson watched Steve's hand gravitate to Tony's shoulder, holding on while he still could, and his heart broke for the two of them. Even if everything was absolutely, completely fine, facing something like that, facing the thought of losing someone like that- He cut off the thought with a shudder. He wished he'd put on a suit. It would have felt less vulnerable. Standing there in his glasses and t-shirt with a bound Clint by his side, Coulson felt utterly and completely useless.
Tony was nodding his assent. "Yeah, I'm sure Fury's gonna be all kinds of full of questions. Not sure how much information I can give, though. Maybe Fitz-Simmons can figure something out after a check-up. I'm guessing that the modifications they made to the suit saved me. I don't know what else it would've been." It gave him chills thinking of what it had felt like to use the gun. Tony was certain he'd died. "I can upload my suit's logs to see what my vitals did, too."
"You know, I might be able to swing that kinda subtle," Logan decided, smirking faintly. "Well, I'm sure if we walk around here long enough, I could find someone who needs their face remodeled."
The warm greeting and the real smile on Steve's face made Phil feel genuinely better. The man was going through hell, and he was still willing to spare what little happiness he possessed with them. "Thank you. It's very good to be back." Again he found himself on the verge of reaching out for Clint's hand and barely stopped. "How about we all get some food and reconvene?"
Obviously annoyed with his less-than-perfect landing, Bruce grunted as he finally disengaged from the chute. "You'd think SHIELD would've come up with some no-tangle ones or something," he groused.
"Yes, but - "
"I actually can't make any promises. It's been awhile since anyone was here to find out," Phil answered honestly, "but I give you permission to wake me or roll me over if I'm keeping you awake." Phil, who had followed the man's example and stripped down to his boxers, slipped into his side of the bed and urged Clint, "Roll over. You looked like you were about to face a firing squad a minute ago just because you're turned on. Believe me when I say that is never offensive so long as I can claim part of the credit for why. Now lie down and just let me hold you for awhile."
Tony smiled, twisting his wrist loose just to catch Steve's and pull him in for another quick kiss. "Then it's a deal," he decided, "No breaking." Tony made sure to throw some bacon in a skillet to begin slowly sizzling as he gathered materials for the pancakes. He had to remind himself that he didn't have to cook for six people; Steve likely wouldn't need as much as even Tony did. "You better make that coffee good and strong. Phil went to the wrong coffee place, so I didn't get the good stuff this morning. He's a terrible babysitter."
Clint was fiddling with the hammer as they walked, aching to bring it down in the middle of Loki's back. He refrained, though. Mostly because Phil had told him not to. He was half praying for the Asgardian to give him a reason to disobey.
Coulson steeled himself, ready for the rejection before he even heard it. He knew that he and Clint weren't alike. They were very different people, and even if there was an obvious mutual attraction and they did have a good time together, it was assuming a lot to think Clint might have even the vaguest interest in spending social time with him as more than friends. "If you wanted to come back to my room tonight, that would be nice," he managed, barely able to meet Clint's gaze as he put the offer forward. "Even if you just want a cup of coffee, I just... I'd enjoy that."
"Shit," Logan muttered, moving to try and get a clear shot. "So much for the easy shot." He found himself wishing he was more of a marksman. The gun wasn't exactly something you could take to the gun range. Logan managed to get what felt like a steady shot, and the beam landed a decent glancing blow. Logan grunted as his vision blurred for a moment and the weapon weighed a little heavier on his shoulder. "Stark, that didn't work. And I think I've got two more shots left. Maybe."
They took Magneto down to the very deepest depths of the building, locking him away in a plastic cell. Thor smirked as the agents around them stared in awe at him, reflecting how tiny they were as he followed Nat back out of the cell block. "So now we meet with the Hawk and the Son of Coul?"
Logan couldn't help grinning in a slightly sadistic manner, and he chuckled as he thought about it. "And that's why she's not just hot, she's incredibly hot," he decided, then pressed a kiss to Scott's lips. "Not as hot as you, but still..." He sighed. 'Rough day' didn't begin to cover it, but he couldn't squelch the sense of satisfaction knowing that Nat had brought them a couple of prizes, at least. "Maybe they can help us find Loki's hideout. And maybe they've got a few dozen bruises for their troubles, too. Broken bone or two wouldn't hurt my feelings, in fact."
Clint nodded, swallowed hard, and gave Phil's hand a squeeze. Normally, it wasn't that difficult to debrief. Then again, normally he and his handler didn't get abducted by a psychotic, superhuman rapist. "I got dragged out of the vent, sir. Creed sliced it open with his claws - they're metal, and that's not in his file, by the by - and pulled me out. He had me by the armor, so I had to squirm out of it. We fought some more. Arrows aren't real good against a guy that heals that fast. He managed to get hold of me, made Ph -  Agent Coulson drop his weapon. Then he used some kind of tech to take us out of there. Probably something Loki gave him." His frame tensed even more, and he looked ready to fight or run as he took another deep breath. "He kept us and..." He trailed off, looking away and swallowing hard, unable to continue.
A guttural roar wrenched itself from Tony's throat as he was forcibly claimed by that mammoth length. The pain was blinding, stealing his breath away and causing his muscles to tense. It also had the effect of giving Tony a momentary rush of clarity. The haze of the drug cleared, and his eyes widened in shock. "What the hell? You're not Steve..." Tony struggled, but to no avail. His wrists were still firmly bound, and although his legs were free, he could not wrench himself loose. The Soldier had fully impaled him, claiming him with such intensity that hot tears pricked at Tony's eyes.
Clint stared, dumbfounded for a few moments before he cracked a grin that slowly turned into a solid belly laugh. He wasn't sure if it was relief or true amusement, but he had tears in his eyes and was clinging to the edge of the counter to hold himself up before he finally got a grip. Sniffling and wiping the tears from his eyes, he finished mopping up the coffee and tossed the paper towels before moving to refill his cup. "Gotta say, that... you had me going there," he said, pouring out the last of the pot into his cup. "Damn you and your poker face, Coulson. You had me convinced for a minute there that you had me in your spank bank." Not that it wouldn't have been flattering, just a bit awkward. Especially after having caught a few glimpses of the outline of Phil's package in his PJs. //Yeah, that'd make this whole handler-asset relationship a little awkward,// Clint reflected with a smirk as he started pulling together another pot of coffee.
Tony grabbed onto Steve's hand when he walked by. He didn't try to hold Steve back, just held on lightly, keeping contact as long as he could while Steve walked past him. He swallowed hard as the blonde's fingers finally slid completely away. "Love you," he murmured softly, looking frightened and small in his wheelchair.
Logan ignored him. "I like the 'no hidin'' part. Though I ain't lookin' for a spotlight on me, either. I don't like reporters."
Steve's expression brightened at the sight of Tony. He still looked gray and shaky, but he smiled all the same. "See? Still here." His fingers brushed over Tony's gently as he passed with Natasha's help.
"Yeah, well, you're a bad influence. Or a good one. I don't even care," Steve murmured as he rocked into Tony's grip. It wasn't that Steve hadn't always enjoyed sex, but being with Tony was something altogether different. He supposed it was the feeling behind everything and the way Tony made him feel like he could never quite catch his breath in the best of all possible ways. Smiling, Steve murmured, "Love you. Also, not to take away from the moment, but I'd like you to fuck me into the mattress."
Phil and Clint weren't meant to feature in this fic as more than background. We happen to be in love with them, though, so things happen. Enjoy our lack of focus!
In which Loki plays games, Logan makes questionable choices, and Scott gets a gift that may come with strings attached.
They made it to the lab without incident, though Coulson was told firmly and more than once by different agents that the cuffs had to stay on. He didn't like it, but he didn't protest. It made sense. It did. They arrived in the lab to find Steve entering a beat after, pushing Tony in a wheelchair with one hand on the man's shoulder as if he was sure Tony would bolt out at the first opportunity otherwise, which was probably true. "Natasha wanted us to make sure that everything was going well."
Clint felt his stomach clench in fear, and he sat up like a shot next to Nat, face noticeably pale. "Sir, maybe I - "
Before Logan even had a chance to say no, Stark was on his feet, "Sounds good." Tony grabbed Steve's arm just as the lights in the room went down, highlighting the dancefloor with spotlights of various colors. "You ever danced to music like this?" he asked the blonde as the beat got slower but no less charged. He pulled the taller man close and gave Steve his best bad boy grin, the one that could always keep Pepper from staying mad at him for more than a few seconds, the same one that had him taking his pick of who he brought home anytime he wanted it. His hands were on Steve's hips, holding him bare inches from his own body as he showed Steve how to move.
"Friend's a strong word. But I'm Logan. I'm with your Avenger buddies, if you hadn't guessed."
Coulson recovered quickly and nodded, offering the woman his hand. "Agent Phil Coulson of SHIELD, and this is Agent Clint Barton. I'm sorry for coming without notice, but the situation we're in is... delicate. Could we speak with you privately?"
"He's an amazing friend," Steve countered. He was grateful to the man for his kindness and for being there for Tony when he couldn't be. "But I can do industrial strength coffee." He found himself watching Tony intently and searching for any signs of tension or uncertainty. "Think there's a chance they'll let me get away with hiding up here with you for a day or two? Facing everybody right now... I just... I'm still progressing. I'm not sure how to tell the team they're in the market for a new leader yet."
Tony whimpered faintly before he managed to stop himself as Steve worked his neck. It was a sensitive spot for him. "I'd... Uhm... I seem to be getting distracted." Managing to leverage some of the ridiculous brain power he had at his disposal, Tony finally remembered where the item in question was and pulled open a small compartment hidden in the sundeck above the back seats. He shoved a small bottle of lube into Steve's hand as he shifted against the other man's cock. "Pretty well put-together for a loaner," Tony finally managed. It wasn't just that, though. Steve's serum-enhanced body was just the outside aligning to match the man Steve was: a hero. Tony wondered briefly if he was good enough to be with Steve in the first place. It was nothing to do with looks; Tony knew he was attractive to pretty much everyone on the planet that liked men. He just couldn't shake the feeling that he was a borderline villain just waiting for a relapse.
"Having Thor back would be the ideal scenario," Coulson agreed, rubbing his forehead as if it might soothe away his worries. The more time passed, the less he thought Thor would help at all, and the more it scared him. Even with the hammer, could they take down Loki and the Brotherhood without Thor's help? And how did one go about containing a god if they did? It hadn't worked out so well the last time they tried. "Fury either needs to tell us what the hell's going on with Thor or lift the drinking ban. I suddenly feel a distinct urge to be a casual alcoholic for a couple of days."
Steve threw his head back against Logan's shoulder with a sigh as he let one hand trail down from the back of Tony's neck, over his chest - just grazing the arc reactor - and finally down over the hard planes of his stomach. Tony might not have any super strength helping him out in the fitness department, but nobody could ever call him a slouch. "Maybe I kinda like the idea of you begging," Steve answered in a husky whisper before he gave in and slid his hand into Tony's boxer briefs anyway. He palmed the man's cock and felt it jump against his warm hand. "Maybe the begging can come later."
Eyes still scanning their surroundings, Clint reached out and tapped something that sounded solid but didn't seem to be there. A small helicopter seemed to materialize next to them, and Clint gestured to the rear seat. "Get in," he said. He waited for Darien to follow along, then hopped in and took off. Setting the autopilot, Clint glanced back at Darien. "Should be touching down in about half an hour."
It never occurred to Steve to lie. "We were just finishing up with dinner. Talking about maybe finding a bar to go to after, but I haven't really been to any around here," he confessed. Not picking up on Logan's not-so-subtle signals to shut up and shut up fast, the man ventured, "Don't suppose you have any suggestions?" If anyone was going to know a good, casual bar in the area, it would be Tony. He seemed to be able to find a bar absolutely anywhere.
"After you got all pretty?" Coulson countered dryly. "We approach together, we enter together. We're trying to build good will, not ambush them. I want this to be as above board as we can make it." He knew that the X-Men might not be interested in helping. Engaging the Brotherhood when they attacked was one thing. Being part of an offensive to get an agent they weren't even affiliated with home and safe... well, Coulson could see keeping self preservation in mind. "If they tell us to drop dead, then we smile politely and leave. No arrows to the eyeball."
"In that case..." Clint arched his head back and hooked his arm back behind Phil's head to tug him into another, deeper, more lingering kiss before he pulled away. Having his hair petted was soothing in the extreme, and if Nat wasn't weirded out by them kissing a little, he wasn't going to stop. He needed some kind of intimacy with the other man, chaste as it was. He hadn't missed the way Phil had left ownership of the suite vague. The truth was, the archer hadn't had much inclination to go back to his own even before their abduction. Now, he couldn't imagine doing anything but staying with Phil.
"As long as there ain't any more o' you gettin' in bed with me. That sounds like a bad tabloid article." He glanced at Steve. "This gig doesn't come with an ugly uniform, does it? Had all I can stand of creepy leather one pieces."
"Steve..." The tone was soothing, insistent. Tony ruffled Steve's hair, then ran his hand gently down the side of his lover's neck, over one lean shoulder, his arm, down to his hand. It was hard to get used to. It wasn't the Steve Tony was familiar with, and he took several moments to absorb the drastic change. It was shocking, but not in the sense that Steve likely feared. It just hurt Tony to know that his lover was trapped in a body that didn’t fit his spirit. He looked up at Steve as he rested a hand over the blonde's. "Steve, for one, I've read your file, just like I read everyone else's. It came with pictures. I already knew what to expect. I won't lie and tell you that this won’t take some getting used to for me, but that doesn't mean I'm about to run screaming. For another," he pulled Steve's hand to his lips, "I'm not going to sit here waiting because there's nothing to wait for. The gun didn't kill you. It took something away, something we're going to try to get back, but you're still here, and I'm not losing you over this. Serum or not."
"You bet," Tony said, the stress immediately melting away from his features as he took Steve's hand in his own and moved toward the elevator. Back in his suite, Tony pulled his lover into a long, gentle kiss, smiling a little as he drew away. "You know, it feels pretty amazing holding you. You're pretty huggable," he said gently. Jerking his head toward the bar, he smiled faintly. "Think we could use a little wine?"
Tony nodded, sitting up a little. He honestly hadn't trusted himself to make eye contact with Steve for a few moments. He didn't want to betray his uncertainty. It wasn't that he doubted Steve on any level, but Tony had a hard time believing any real relationship involving him had any kind of hope. Finally gathering his nerve, he looked up at Steve and offered him a smile, leaning up to peck a kiss onto his soft lips. "Thanks," he said. "You're my hero." The words were uttered a little more softly, without the usual snarky edge.
Simmons nodded her agreement. It was a sobering idea to realize just how alone and lost in the world Loki might be. "He and Thor were... well, they weren't killing each other. That might be good." She hoped it was good. He needed an ally, and since Tony would be spending all his waking hours with Steve, she suspected, that more or less left Thor unless Bruce decided to take him up as a pet project. "I'm not sure I'm quite ready to ask him to stay for movie night - we should set up a movie night, by the way - but, no, I don't think we should give him a more difficult time than need be."
Loki rolled his eyes but finally allowed, "I suppose it would be the political thing to do." He hated apologies. Making them to his father as a child had always been an exercise in tedium because, frankly, he'd rarely felt bad for the thing for which he was apologizing. With Frigga it had been different. She would fix him with a look of disapproval, and he'd crumble. There was a reason he'd left Magneto to watch her, and it had little to do with the man's strength or skills. He gave Tony a long look before sitting down on the bed. They were past the point of a true struggle for dominance, save a verbal one. Kicking the man out of a chair would have been both petty and ridiculous. "While killing him was certainly more practical than personal, you have a point."
Logan allowed himself the faintest quirk of a smile. "I'll try." //And now that you know he's into guys, it just gets a little weirder... And more difficult to not think about...// He coughed a little as if to interrupt his own thoughts. "That whole friends thing, though... Not sure if you haven't had enough to drink... or need more," he quipped, pulling the fridge open. "One more? And if you're gonna pick up guys, maybe you can just take me along so I can smack down anyone I think might be a sociopath."
Tony swallowed hard, the twist of guilt and fear he felt at the question enough to kill any remaining arousal. He drew himself up, looking away as he wrapped his arms around his chest, feeling exposed. "I'm sorry." He realized that didn't explain a damn thing, and he took a deep breath as he looked into Steve's eyes. "He... he disguised himself as you. I knew it wasn't you. I saw through it, but... I thought I was dead. Loki had told me he was going to use me for awhile and then kill me. I just wanted a little comfort. And I thought... I thought I'd never see you again, so..." He bit his lower lip and trailed off, taking a deep breath. He started to leave out the rest, but it had hurt enough already to keep the secrets from Steve. "The next time, though, he didn't... didn't bother with the disguise." Tony felt panic as he realized that the revelation might mean Steve would never so much as talk to him again, that he might end up losing the man, anyway. He clenched his jaw as he fought back the urge to cry.
Of course, Tony's mind was already going a mile a minute. "Who else knows you can't get drunk? I mean, that's not common knowledge, right? I think we can blame it on the alcohol. Jarvis?"
Clint offered his first real smile. "A van? You do know we've got Tony Stark, right?" he asked, moving fast and without a sound as he led Darien toward their ride. Clint knew that the other man would probably be unable to keep pace with him or move as effectively in a fight, and the marksman wanted to get them the hell out of there as fast as possible. Fortunately, they had a lovely piece of Stark tech right on the other side of the wall. Clint helped haul Darien over the barrier, then followed himself, dropping from it and landing easily on the other side. As he straightened, one easy motion drew his bow and launched an arrow at an incoming Agency goon. The man, silhouetted against the moonlight, dropped soundlessly.
Sorry for a couple days with no updates. I was vending at a convention. Yay work? :)
Steve considered telling Bucky a bit more about what had happened but decided against it just as fast. Bucky didn’t need to know how bad it had been, not until he was back on his feet. Then they could rehash the whole thing. “Right now maybe that’s for the best. We don’t know what you’ve been through. We assume that Hydra’s had you since you fell and... that’s a long time.” The thought of it made Steve swallow hard to clear a catch from his voice before speaking again. “I’m just happy that you’re here and in one piece and Tony is too. We’ll figure out the rest of it later.”
Though he was rather thoroughly wrapped up in his beer, Clint finally took note of the underhanded ribbing he was getting. "Oh, I know how to dance," he said, not bothering to lean back and give the other two more space. He lowered his voice slightly, his expression turning sly. "It's just the kind of dancing that's pretty similar to foreplay."
"Not all of them, my lady," Sif assured. "You will find that there are many to whom we have spoken. Once Thor is returned to himself, all will be well."
"See, now you're putting me in the position of telling you no because it's the right thing to do. You're evil," Steve pointed out, visibly disgruntled as they tangled together. "You're lucky I apparently have a thing for evil. Yes, you should go and do lab things and make science and not kill Fitz-Simmons because I think Phil wouldn't appreciate that." He kissed Tony's shoulder, "But can you maybe do it in five minutes or something? I want a few minutes to cuddle you before you go shower."
"We will," Phil assured firmly. "We will." He held Clint close and kissed his hair, wiping away the tears with one hand. Though he didn't know how he'd do it, he promised, "If there's anything I can do to keep him away from you, I will." Perhaps because of what Clint had already been through or perhaps just because he was more Creed's type, he presented a more enticing target. It killed him that he could do so little. Their best bet was a SHIELD team coming to get them. Their second best bet was the man in charge giving them a reprieve. Something told him Loki wasn't all that likely to release them while they were still of entertainment value to one of his own toys. Seeing Clint stripped down made him remember all to vividly the withdrawn, uncertain man Clint had been for awhile after Loki took over his mind. He still remembered with a chill the realization that Barton had been compromised. He knew how he'd felt hearing it, and he couldn't fathom going through it. Even being tortured by Creed, at least he'd been in control of himself and his reactions to a degree. "Whatever happens, I'm right here with you, Clint. We're in this together."
The redhead gave Logan a wink and ducked out into the walkway. "Yeah, boss?"
Logan frowned. He hadn't really thought if that. "I think that girl with the red hair... Potts? I think she's probably got some of it. Far as Jarvis goes, though... maybe Bruce can take care of it. Or that kid... uh... Fitz. Not really sure, but it seems like everyone's pretty attached to the place. I'm sure it'll get taken care of."
Clint stared hard at the other man for a few moments before lowering the weapon and putting it away. "We kind of figured," he answered, still watching Scott's every move. "Especially after I had to shoot him." Clint perched on one of the kitchen chairs, apparently relaxed. "So, what are we missing?" he wanted to know.
Tony warmed at the idea. He was enjoying himself in Steve's company and he hated for the night to end. "Sounds good," Tony enthused. "Have you caught up on any recent films, or do you prefer the classics?" He couldn't imagine what Steve might make of modern day movies, with their CGI and high definition widescreen. "Me, I'm more of a Bogie and Bacall kinda guy." Tony reached over and covered Steve's hand with his own, offering a gentle squeeze. "And just for the record? I've missed you, too."
Logan grinned a little, the touch raising pleasant goosebumps along his skin. He still couldn't remember anything new, but instincts told him that this wasn't a first time with another man for him. It felt too familiar, too comfortable. Steve was as awe-inspiring without his shirt as Logan would've guessed. The mutant didn't hesitate in reaching out to touch Steve's beautifully-developed torso, fingers tracing over strong muscles. Logan was leaning in for a kiss when he felt Tony press against his back, fingers sliding down his stomach and over the growing bulge in his jeans.
Clint glanced at Steve, who also looked baffled, then back to Bruce. "What?"
"Yeah, popcorn sounds good," Steve agreed. Naturally he rose to help Tony make it only to find that it was as simple as tossing a bag into the microwave. He still hadn't quite gotten used to them and food he attempted to prepare in his own tended to veer between burned and frozen. Soon they were settled on the couch in a surprisingly comfortable fashion, eating popcorn and enjoying the movie. It wasn't until he was settled next to Tony side by side that he realized just how long a day it had been. Somehow he'd never managed to get over the idea that he needed to do PT even when it didn't really change anything. His metabolism more or less took care of it all, but Steve still tended to get up early to run or work out. It felt right somehow and a lot more productive than just sitting in his apartment. Unfortunately with the party at the end of the day, Steve found himself drifting off as the images played themselves out across the screen. Before it registered fully just how tired he really was, Steve was asleep, his head falling onto Tony's shoulder as he slumped back on the cushions.
Logan was pretty sure that if he hadn't just taken his cigar out of his mouth to tell Stark to hurry up and finish talking, it would have fallen out. His next "What?" sounded less testy and more like he was sure he'd just started hallucinating.
"Any chance I can get a hand with this?" Darien gave his dripping cock a few slow strokes. "Or do you like to watch?" He didn't really mind dealing with the problem himself, but being touched by Clint certainly sounded more fun.
Simmons breathed a sigh of relief when the man fell into step beside her. She was honestly too weary to argue the point the way she would have liked. Quietly, she assured him, "We aren't trying to recreate the serum. That's... it's dangerous. I trust my employers, of course," she added hurriedly, "but it's... it isn't... I don't think it's a power anyone should really have. My solution is based far more on reactivating the serum already in Captain Rogers' bloodstream. It would mean that instead of attacking those cells and killing them off, what's left of the serum already would go back to reproducing on its own. His body would rebuild itself. The process would likely be more gradual than the original application, but that might be for the best anyway. Less strain on his system." Simmons bit her lip and wondered if the information dump was too much in Bruce's frazzled state.
That definitely should have set off warning bells. Instead Darien heard himself moan a little bit too loudly considering there were other people around. "Uh... that... you... really?" It was dirty talk. It had to be. Because outside of porn, people didn't do that, did they? //And outside of sci-fi, they dion't turn invisible. And outside of spy flicks, no one could kill a half a dozen guys in under a minute without breaking a sweat.// "Oh, fuck, you mean it. Yeah, okay. Only live once, right?"
Steve's breath had caught at the lurid suggestion, and he was half disappointed that Tony backed down. It was the right thing to do, but it was still disappointing. He sighed and couldn't help smiling at the suggestion. "That's probably a good idea, yeah. I don't think you can help the looking pretty part, but quieter might be better." Tony was great at dealing with the press if loud and unabashed was what the event called for. This cried out for something more delicate. Still stroking his fingers through Tony's hair, he added, "And maybe we can talk about that blow job thing after?"
"Always. Just came off an assignment. I came home to a whole new file. New blood for the team. Welcome." Natasha unfolded herself from the chair, all leather and curves, and smiled when it got a reaction from even Darien. Of course, he looked terrified instead of lustful, but she could work with that too. "I didn't know you'd already taken him for a test drive, but that means he should be easier to deal with.”
The idea of food turned his stomach, but Scott nodded anyway. "A banana sounds good," he allowed. It had hurt getting out of bed, and it hurt even more thinking about putting right everything that was wrong with him. The hangover was really the least of his problems. Scott remained almost completely silent while Logan got the coffee ready. He grabbed a banana and managed to get through both it and the coffee without throwing up. Only then did Scott finally ask, "So I feel like shit, but I still... what I said last night, what I did... I meant that. It's not like I gave up on it this morning."
Steve's hand tensed on the counter, but his anger toward Logan had ebbed already. "I know it's hazy at best. I also know that getting to where this thing is might be our only shot at getting Nat back." He reached out and placed his hand on Logan's forearm. "Please? Anything you remember... it might seem like a little thing, but it could help."
Scott sighed happily at the contact and the assurance that Logan liked what they were doing too. It was lazy, and maybe it wouldn't even go anywhere, and that was nice too. He didn't really care as long as the night ended with them curled up in bed together. While he'd been desperately trying not to freak out in the cell, that was the thing he needed most. Scott had ached for Logan's arms curled around him and the warmth of the man's body, his steady heartbeat. "I really, really missed being close to you."
"I know," Coulson answered earnestly. "Fury told me. I didn't appreciate the bit with the cards. Those were expensive." He smile wryly. "I made the mistake of asking to see the security footage. It looks stupider on TV. Not to mention it's off-putting to watch yourself bleed out." The next part was the part he rarely let himself think and said even less often. "I still don't know how I'm breathing. Apparently it's classified even from me."
Steve smiled. He could hear every unspoken word in the sentence. "Don't worry. Getting everybody back on track is priority number one right now. For everybody." As much as he would have loved to spend the day curled up in bed with Tony basking in the glow of what they'd shared with one another for the very first time that morning, he wasn't going to let the team suffer. "I'm sure between Bruce and Tony we'll have this taken care of before Loki's ribs heal." His smile faltered as he caught sight of Clint's cuffs. "Is that really necessary?"
It was a more difficult question than it should have been, and Steve gave it proper respect by thinking through all the potential ways of putting it through his head first. "It was a lot of things," he settled on at last. "It was you being on the team, it was your dad being my friend - I know, you don't like to talk about him - it was just... you." Steve laughed at how stupid it sounded and pulled Tony in a little closer. "Eventually I kinda realized maybe you were under my skin for a reason."
"Be there. That's all he'll want. Prove him wrong. You show him he's still got you. I'll show him he's got SHIELD." Coulson wheeled Tony off the elevator and into his room. "You need any help, let me know. I know I'm a pretty poor back up for Captain America, but I can make sure you eat and shower and sleep until Steve's up to baby sitting again." Left to his own devices, Coulson worried that Tony would stay up all night reading and get zero of his own healing done.
"I think we've both logged enough hours in medical that doctors aren't all that sexy anymore." Frankly Phil hadn't ever gotten the mystique, but he supposed money was enough of a draw for most people. "I'll be happy to be your private physician, Agent Barton... as long as you pay in entirely inappropriate, government unapproved trade. By which I mean blow jobs." He only half heard the band. It didn't sound half as good as Clint's voice.
Scott watched the man fidget nervously and smirked. The aspirin and coffee were doing their work. He felt half human despite the dull aching throb in his head. "You don't have to freak out. I want to give it a shot. The kissing's good. The rest might suck. I'm willing to do this on a guaranteed return on investment kind of a thing, which basically means I don't think we should freak out however this goes." Scott wasn't sure how capable he was of ignoring any feelings that came up with it all, but he also didn't want to go from one incredibly serious relationship to another just for the sake of not being alone. He was willing, for once, to see how things developed.
Realizing he'd been zoning out entirely from the look on the man's face - //Senator?// Steve couldn't remember - he gave a shake of his head and apologized, "I'm sorry. It was a long day, and I'm afraid I'm not all-" The words cut off sharply when he caught a glimpse of a familiar face from across the room.
Coulson accepted the offer with an apologetic smile. "I'm sorry for interrupting, but I was hoping we could speak."
Steve had the grace to blush. "Give us a half hour, Clint." He knew he couldn't afford to let Tony stay with him no matter how much he wanted it, but that didn't mean he was above insisting on keeping Tony to himself for a short period of time. "Bruce could use the breather anyway." There would be no good argument to that and Steve damn well knew it.
Logan couldn't help a quiet laugh at that. He turned his head to look at Scott from the corner of his eye. "Maybe." He was pretty sure he should have been bothered by the fact that Nat was playing with his boyfriend's hair, but it didn't worry him. Maybe because he knew Scott wasn't going anywhere. Or maybe just the sense of camaraderie that came from her doting on Scott. Or maybe it was the fact that she was hot as hell. //Probably that one.//
Dark eyes moved back to the pair. "So you're building it for the knuckle-dragging savage with questionable allegiances? Bruce, when did SHIELD switch to off-brand geniuses?"
Coulson chuckled at that. "I guess it does help to have a couple spares in your back pocket." He wondered how many of his traditional SHIELD agent nine lives he'd used up coming back from Loki stabbing him through the heart. He guessed more than a comfortable margin. As always, even thinking about it all struck a painful chord, something that ran deeper than fear or unease, and Coulson frowned briefly. He shook off the whole thing and tried to focus on the moment, on Clint sitting at the table enjoying a nice meal with him. Even knowing Clint would probably prefer Natasha's company, it still felt good. "So how do you spend your spare time - obvious, vaguely disturbing sexual exploits aside?"
Clint felt himself shiver a little at the words, the gentle whisper against his ear. His breath caught silently as he tried to force himself to stay calm. The low, intimate croon of Coulson's voice in his ear was oddly intriguing. "Maybe," he said, trying to keep the sleepy murmur in his voice even though he was pretty awake at the moment. "But you'd probably have to work for it. I'm feeling more like napping than talking."
Logan opened his mouth to tell Loki how much he thought of that idea when he found himself back at the Avengers headquarters. Right outside his own door, no less. Deciding that everyone else could wait, he shoved open the door and rushed inside, "Scott?" He wanted to see the man, assure himself that Loki hadn’t hurt him.
Logan's breath left him in a low groan as he cupped Scott's face, thumb tracing over his lower lip before he leaned in for a kiss. "I'm glad that's what you want, because after ya looked at me that way, you're not gettin' away without it," he rumbled, slamming another, harder kiss to Scott's lips as he slid a hand back to cup the man through his underwear. He needed to forget for a minute. They both did.
Phil had been tracing shapes on Clint's thighs with his fingers while the man spoke, and when Clint finally stopped, he shared a small smile with him. "I'm sorry that it took so long, but I'm glad you found a place where you felt safe, comfortable." He'd known from Clint's file that his upbringing wasn't the best, but he'd never known that specific detail. "You, just the way you are, is beautiful. Wouldn't change a thing." He cupped Clint's cheek and drew him down into a soft, lingering kiss. "Wish I could have seen you in the circus, actually. I bet that was a hell of a show."
Phil reached up, briefly tracing his fingers over Clint's bicep. "I think you'd look good with some art. Your arms are gorgeous. Anything that draws attention to them... well, wouldn't be so bad." He shared a smile with the other man as they drifted toward one of the side stages. "Want to grab a spot in the shade for awhile?" There were few trees in the field serving as a makeshift stadium, and the idea of curling up under one of them for awhile with Clint settled in against him was tempting even with so much left to see.
