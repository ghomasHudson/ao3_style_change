Half naked, he looked disconcertingly like a normal woman, just as he had when he'd first changed. The business suits and the armor did a lot to disguise the differences, but without them... Hank could see how Steve could have found him attractive. He wasn't beautiful, not the way Jan was, but then, no woman could survive any real comparison to Jan.
he had been that she hadn't forced him to refuse a glass of the wine that had been sitting, open, in the picnic basket right next to him, perfuming the air with its scent.
Swallowing hurt. "What do you want to do?" he asked, bracing himself for the answer. He couldn't blame Tony if he wanted nothing to do with Steve after this.
Jolted out of her reverie, Wanda looked up at him. "For what? I can't thank you enough. You probably saved my sanity."
a little black dress, and no longer visibly exhausted and depressed, making fun of him didn't feel cruel.
"Which is what, exactly?" On the one hand, it was very flattering and affirming that Hank and Reed had followed Tony's lead and treated Peter like an equal in all matters scientific. On the other hand, it meant he ended up asking more questions than he had since Dr. Connors' class.
The Latvarian franc had fallen against the euro, he saw, as he read the latest report from one of his more loyal ministers. Completely unacceptable; he would have to arrange for several bombings in France and Spain, and perhaps a bubble on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. That should bring world finances into a more appropriate state. Perhaps the assassination of the president of one of Greece's major banks...
"Ask Tony once he comes out of this," Carol said. "I wasn't there, I just heard about it from Clint." She glanced at Tony, her eyes lingering on him for a long moment, then looked back at Steve. "He is going to come out of this, Steve."
Of course, so were the powered ones. Hank, Wanda, Vision. Simon, who had died twice. Tony again, who was still deeply fucked up despite his new cybernetic powers, for all that he'd gotten better lately.
pregnant. No wonder he didn't want to hear Thor talking about what kind of warrior his and Steve's child would be.
Sharon drew herself up slightly, looking as if she were about to object, and then nodded. She straightened her SHIELD-issue jacket and turned back to Tony. "You're right; you shouldn't have brought it up, but I'll forget you said it if you will." She drew in a deep breath, let it out slowly, and added, "Go sit down somewhere and talk to the doctors; you look like hell. Let the professionals take care of things here."
It probably would have ended up with Steve's ears, poor kid. And unmarried parents, and more media attention than any child should ever have to experience.
Everything about this evening had been scripted, with a little help from Jan and Pepper. Tempting as the idea of giving the interview in either business attire or, even better, armor had been, he had deliberately worn casual clothing. It created the illusion of intimacy, and not appearing in costume would subtly make the point that this was about Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, not about Captain America and Iron Man.
He and Rhodey probably looked like a completely normal couple to the rest of the room. If Tony had been his usual self, people would have stared, whispered surreptitiously, never done business with him in quite the same way again.
"You are... you've been in California for a long time. What's it like being back here again?" He'd almost said 'being back home again,' but managed to catch himself. Not everyone on the team thought of the Mansion as home the way he did.
"This one's dead, too." Wanda was kneeling by the man Carol had dropped when she'd lunged for Sin, one gloved hand against his throat. "I think they may all be dead."
"Sex performed to saxophone music" was a gross  exaggeration.   Steve rubbed at the back of his neck with one hand, and  said, "It's in a club.  What's the difference?"
"Electrocuted, then," Steve said. He stepped forward and wrapped his hand around the edge of the elevator door. "Here, I'll come down to the lab with you. Maybe I can help." Tony was unlikely to need his assistance with anything technological, but Steve wasn't going to let him hide in the basement by himself for the rest of the day. He would end up spending hours down there, not bothering to come upstairs to eat, and Steve wouldn't see him again until tomorrow night; the Avengers' labs always had a cot or sofa shoved into a corner somewhere, testament to both Tony and Hank's screwed-up working and sleeping patterns.
Where did Sin find these people?  This one was barely old enough to vote, and willing to shoot his fellows to death on her orders.
"Or mascara." Carol shook her head, and said, "But it's more trouble than it's worth to try and take a general aviation aircraft into New York these days. I could just fly in under my own power, but," she hefted the suitcase she was holding, "it would just look silly flying through the sky toting Samsonite. Plus, I’d be screwed if I dropped it."
Hank was going to be all right.  Anything else could wait until later.  “I’ll just… leave,” Don said, pushing himself to his feet.
"It was always your body," Steve objected. The scars had proved that, and the other details that had still been the same, like the line of his profile and the feel of his hair. His hair would feel the same as a man, wouldn't it? Steve wondered if he would ever get the chance not find out. "It was just... different."
She blinked suddenly hot eyes as Strange nodded – "Yes, really not dead," – and drew in a long, shaky breath. Steve was alive. Clint was alive. Simon and Tony were alive. She still had family left, despite Chthon's best efforts.
"Um, no," Peter admitted. Tony had relatives? She must be talking about Cap. "I'm," he leaned forward, lowering his voice to a near whisper, "I'm Peter Parker, I'm, um," God, this never got easier, "I'm Spiderman. I used to be an Avenger?"
The air was cool against his skin — he had not bothered to turn on the heat in the hotel room, since by Latverian standards the weather was still warm — and the feel of it made his face itch, as if he could actually sense Loki's eyes moving over his scars.
In which case, leaving them in Thor's custody made sense, given that he was unlikely to be susceptible to any human diseases – very unlikely, as Hank now knew from direct experience. Asgardian DNA was subtly different from human DNA in a number of ways that would probably be fascinatingly significant to a geneticist.... And which Hank was never going to even think of mentioning to anyone, because that project was dead and over with and Thor's genetic code was now none of his business.
It made him sound like the kind of man who was so eager for sex that it didn't matter whether the person he was sleeping with was male or female. Which wasn't far from the truth, since he never had minded, but it wasn't out of desperation, or because he didn't have standards, or… and Steve was suddenly very glad he hadn't said any of
He would see this rectified.  Thor examined the golden ring that lay in the center of his palm; so small a thing to seem so ominous.  Loki had sworn that it had the power to summon her, that all he need do was hold it and speak her name thrice.
Wanda, on the other hand, was holding her glass up in front of her with gloved hands and staring at it, a small frown drawing a line between her eyebrows. "Define 'slept with.'"
His eyes were staring to burn.  Steve closed them and let his head hang forward for a moment, his hand still in Tony’s hair.  He felt almost as if he were floating, so tired that his ribs didn’t even hurt anymore.
The gloves would be ruined.  Hydrogen peroxide would take the bloodstains off his tunic and pants, but nothing was going to salvage his gloves.
Steve nodded – he took Wanda or Strange’s word on that sort of thing.  Magic was far from his area of expertise.  Tony was all right; that was the important part.  The spear hadn’t cursed him, or eaten his soul, or opened him up to possession by Chthon.
Tony came a step closer to him, one hand coming up to touch the side of Steve's face. "I swear, I did not do this on purpose." He stared into Steve's eyes, expression uncertain. His eyes were a clear, bright blue, shading to darker grey around the pupils, no hint of oily Extremis black. Steve felt a sudden urge to wipe the smudge of grease on his face away, to clean all traces of SE and his workshop off of him.
"Whenever he gets done with that reporter he was supposed to meet today. Janet Van Dyne grabbed him as soon as he came in the door; you just missed him, actually." She nodded at the corner of a suitcase that was just visible on the other side of the desk.
The pristine black and white tiles of the floor, handmade by a company in Brooklyn that reproduced 1920s-style ceramics, were smeared with mud from Barnes and Sharon's boots now, and the new-paint smell in the air had been drowned out by the scent of blood. They'd have to clean the entire place before the construction crew returned tomorrow morning.
Instead, Wanda bent down and seized a twisted chunk of metal that had until minutes ago been part of a Doombot's torso.  Taking a page from Steve's book, she threw it at the closest Doombot like a discus.
Tony shook his head. "You know," he said softly, leaning his weight against Steve for a moment, "if you hung it on the wall, the cat wouldn't be able to chew on it."
Suddenly, A.I.M., the crowd of reporters filling Times Square, the Fox news helicopter overhead, and the police officers who wanted Steve to come down to the station and discuss A.I.M.'s explosives with their bomb squad seemed like minor annoyances.
So that's what this was actually about. "I know it must be hard, but you got through the party without drinking. You've been sober for months now."
"You need to relearn the way your body moves," Steve said, blocking a kick from Tony and jabbing an elbow into his ribs, slightly less forcefully than he normally would have. "You can't just go on memory. Pay attention to how every move feels; if it's awkward to do, it's not going to work as well as it did before."
There were parties in New York where it was totally acceptable to dance with another man, but this had never been one of them.
Hank's voice sounded inside his head, slightly tinny the way voices filtered through both cellular connections and the Extremis always were.
Clint drew in a deep breath, sucked it up, and got into the elevator. It descended so quickly that his ears popped, the doors opening silently on mad scientist territory. He edged into the room, letting the doors slide shut behind him, trying to be as quiet as possible.
Doom threw back his head and laughed.  "You and your pitiful fellow superheroes are no match for myself and Loki working together.  You couldn't even defend your own home from me, so how do they imagine you're going to stop me?"
She turned to him, looking startled for a moment, before her expression smoothed. "Spiderman. Does Hank know anything yet?"
"Well, then we're lucky that's not what I'm trying to do right now, aren't we?" Tony shoved past Steve roughly, his shoulder colliding with Steve's. It would have been the work of a split-second to grab that both shoulder and his wrist and put him in an arm lock, but that would have taken the fight into physical territory, and even angry, he knew that wasn't a good idea. He could almost see Tony rounding on him, punching him in the jaw, and then thoroughly losing it as he had some kind of flashback to the hallucinations he'd suffered while under the influence of AIM's toxin.
"No." Tony shook his head, the movement minimal. "I can't get sick anymore. The Extremis prevents it."
Tony had a spy satellite watching the cathedral, and several street level cameras planted around the block, filming in infrared as well as visible light, plus a network of hacked traffic cameras, but the ambient chaos energy made them unreliable, the feeds prone to cutting in and out and half the data corrupted. And he couldn't monitor them 24/7 with the Extremis anymore, which meant that instead of seamless round-the-clock surveillance, they had a computer program designed to register "unusual activity" and set off an alert.
Don lifted his head, glaring at Doom with the one eye that wasn't swollen shut.  "You're going to destroy yourself.  No human can wield the power of the Odin force; it'll burn your soul up like a candle, if Chthon doesn't destroy it for you first."
"No," Steve said, thrusting his hips upward and to the side to throw Tony off of him, and rolling to pin him to the ground in a knee-on-stomach hold. "I didn't. You surprised me."
"They've been hired by someone." Jan shrank down, taking flight, and eyed the group, trying to decide which of them her stingers would to the most good on. Thunderball or Piledriver, she decided. The Wrecker's purple ski mask protected his face, and Bulldozer preferred charging blindly at people anyway; he didn't need to see the fight.
They'd have to get in a very long line first. Hank resisted the temptation to point out that that wasn't exactly an incentive to come back, letting Rhodes continue uninterrupted.
Steve didn't reply to that, but Tony could see his anger in the stiff set of his shoulders and the way his hands suddenly became even more careful, their movements more precise. A lot had happened while Steve had been... gone... and Sharon and Barnes had clearly seen no more reason to fill Steve in on certain specific details about their attempts to take down Red Skull than Tony had to tell Steve about some of the nastier things he and Hank and Reed had had to do to try and keep Norman Osborn off their backs and Dickstein and his committee appeased. Most of it had come out in the congressional hearings, anyway. There had been no need to rehash it.
"I won't." Tony waved off her concern and turned back to Hill. "Call the Avengers Mansion. Steve promised you guys our help if you needed it, and he needs to know about this immediately. I'm going to talk to Dr. Deodato, and then I'm going back to Stark Enterprises." At least he could still do his job there without somehow hurting or breaking himself.
"And of course, it's been major news that the two of you, along with several other formerly registered heroes, have reformed an Avengers team with Captain America." Byrne raised his eyebrows, electronic pen poised over the PDA he had produced from a coat pocket. "That must have been interesting to negotiate."
He'd been using that trick more lately than he had since California – the fewer Pym particles Hank expended on himself, the more he had to spare for inanimate objects. And Hank had always liked showing off, if not necessarily in a flashy way.
He'd been wrong about a lot of things lately, but not about this. He couldn't keep this baby. Even if it meant losing Steve. Not telling him about the pregnancy would have been easier, and would probably have hurt Steve less in the long run, but Wanda was right. He had had the right to know. And the guilt over keeping the secret would probably have eventually become even more painful than the misery of having Steve know everything. Probably.
She-Hulk took a step forward, placing herself between Wanda and the pointedly-not-looking-at-Wanda form of Vision. "Speaking of which, Tony, I think we're all curious about what you look like under that helmet. Do you mind taking it off and giving us a show, so we can get all the snickering out of our systems now?"
He reeled back, eyes wide, and Carol snatched the gun out of his hands before he could recover.  She had a moment to notice small details — a stocky build, a gap between his front teeth, a combat knife strapped to his thigh — and then three more men and a woman came pelting around the corner behind him, guns out and ready.
Tony grinned. Joking about it somehow made it feel, if not less real, then at least more remote, less important. None of the other Avengers were willing to touch any subject involving Stane or alcohol in any way that wasn't dead serious and slightly judgmental.
Then he had sworn that he would not move back into the Avengers mansion, that doing so would be to symbolically forgive Tony and Hank Pym their betrayal, just as treating them as the shield-brothers they had once been would be.
Thor was snarling something under his breath, the words a low, indecipherable rumble.  Tony... was still not moving.
“I could have undone the rest of what he made me do, too.  Given everyone their powers back.  I should feel guilty about that, but instead I just keep thinking, I could have had him back.”
Loki made a pouty little moue that filled Don with the desire to wipe the expression off her face, and said, "So bitter. One would think Baldur were still in his grave. Save your anger for those it truly belongs to, brother."
Had it been with Hank, or even before that? Wanda and Vision had broken up, Hank and Tony had both fallen apart, half Steve's teammates had taken off for the West Coast to start a new team, which was a useful and important thing to do, but he missed the days when everyone had been a together in New York, almost like a family.
"I was planning to," Tony said, not quite snidely. "I caught a couple of hours of sleep at the office today, at lunchtime. I can go to bed after I finish this for SHIELD and go over today's security scans from the cathedral and run a probability scan on where the next subway accident is likely to be." Which meant he'd skipped lunch.
his countless military honors was enough to make Tony's worries about whatever Jan was going to make him wear bearable. "He's going to have to wear the full sized version."
She started for the elevator, heels clacking loudly on the tile floor. "We've isolated all of the poisoning victims, since the paramedics said they were violent. We've had to restrain several of them."
The warehouse was lit only by the grey, early-morning light that filtered through its dust-streaked windows. The old building was in the process of being converted into expensive loft apartments, but the ninteenth century core of the structure was still visible in the thick brick walls and the windows' arched tops.
The delicate circuitry that controlled the vault's door and locking mechanism was so much slag, fused together into a lump of gold, copper, and silicon that could almost have been beautiful if it didn't represent days' worth of effort and the loss of a chance to trap Doom where he stood.
"If it involved either orgasms or nudity," Tony said, in an oddly distant voice, breaking in on Steve's inner fantasies, "it counts."
"Personally, I've always found that fighting leads to no sex," Hank said. "So, LA's out then. There's always New Jersey." From Peter, or Steve, or Luke Cage, or any of the other native New Yorkers who'd been on the team, it would have been a sarcastic suggestion. Hank sounded as if he were presenting it as a serious alternative.
Sin turned, either sensing them or hearing Tony's jet boots, and swept the spear sharply in their direction.
Steve thought for a moment that she might be looking for them, but as he stepped out of the shadows, she stiffened, her gaze locked on something on the far side of the room.
"You'd better hope so."  Barnes shook his head.  "I wish we could help more.  I owe Pym for the snake venom thing." Barnes didn't believe in being reassuring; Tony liked that about him.
Once upon a time, that would have bothered him. It still did, but in a distant, abstract way; Tony had gone along with much worse things in the name of expediency and national security over the past year. One corrupt SHIELD agent's death wasn't going to keep him awake at night, especially not one who'd sold out people Steve cared about – it was the innocent people who did that. Bill Foster. Happy. The minor supervillain who'd committed suicide in the negative zone prison, whose name Tony hadn't even known until he'd read the man's file.
"What?" Tony looked up, blinking. It wasn't an act - Steve was pretty sure he honestly had no idea what the two of them had just been talking about. "You know, I think I could get you a ten percent increase in thrust from these, if I just recalibrate a few things and add a few minor modifications."
"That's interesting." The words made him look up, and he discovered that Hank was now standing just a few feet away from him, staring intently at his exposed chest. "You can see that the scars and the breasts didn't originally belong together. If you'd had them when you were injured, this scar," his reached out and lightly tapped the long scar on Tony's right breast, "wouldn't be at the same angle. It would have cut into the side of your breast this way-" He traced his finger sideways, the touch feather-light, and Tony's skin tingled in a way that was both unfamiliar and strangely pleasant. His nipples tightened up in a way that he'd seen on any of a dozen former dates, the skin there suddenly oversensitive, like he had gained extra nerve endings.
"It's good to know that he's happy in spite of everything that happened. I think he'd tell me if he wasn't, but it's still nice to have some proof." Tony's smile shifted slightly, into something closer to a smirk. "I'll have to tap into the security cameras next time."
The Avengers were the only real family he had. It wasn't fair for things to go this wrong, this quickly.
Jan took it from him and stuck it behind her back, snuggling into it, and the tense set of Hank's shoulders eased slightly.
She couldn't remember how she had gotten from Mount Wungadore to Berlin, couldn't remember boarding the plane. The last thing she remembered clearly was stepping inside the cottage she had been sharing with what she
Jan waved a hand dismissively. "I'm sure you can find someone. If all else fails, you can ask Cap or the Falcon to do it."
Steve, noting how tightly he was gripping the case's handles, knew it must contain Tony's armor. He'd gotten it stripped down to the point of fitting inside a medium-sized briefcase again last month, and had been extremely smug about it.
Jan was sitting forward in her char now, leaning her elbows on her knees. "Half of them will spend at least the first hour of the party too stunned and weirded out to exchange inside trading tips and plot Stark Industries' downfall behind your back, and all it will take is a pair of heels and some eyeliner."
better," Steve told her, as he started the long walk up and down the floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, waiting for something to catch his eye.
"I think Doom already has a copy," Wanda said, waving politely to a cameraman. "I'm going to have to tell Strange about this. If anyone can come up with a list of possible buyers for it, it would be him."
Tony being Tony, he probably ought to attach a heart monitor to him, too, just in case. There was no telling how the repairs to Tony's damaged heart were holding up under this new strain. "If you want," Hank suggested, "we could call Beast, and he could tell everyone on the planet about it."
The noble, determined pose never worked as well for him as it did for Cap. Looking unimpressed, Don said, "No, I was there for the 'we'll agree to respect one another's secret identities and not pry into our teammates' private lives' speech that apparently only I remember."
Steve hesistated, steps slowing, trying to think of the proper way to explain this to Rhodey, when Rhodey spoke.
It was nice to have teammates around who hadn't had a front seat view of or a personal stake in the registration disaster.
He didn't have to look to know Steve was frozen, distracted.  Doom was probably counting on that, had likely known the Doombot was still active before tossing that little bombshell at Steve.
It wasn't just the touch — it was the way they were standing, too close, the flirtatious way Tony was smiling at him, the pleasure in his face and body language a sharp contrast to the raw misery in the other photo. The way Steve himself was smiling back, one hand on Tony's arm as if to pull him closer.
"I guess you never found her." Carol's voice was suddenly flat. "Or she'd be in the Raft or the Negative Zone right now."
"It's imperative that it not be exposed to direct sunlight," Dr. Thomas said for the third time. "The damage would be irreparable."
Luke and Jessica  dropped back into their seats as the band started playing a new song.   Jessica Drew raised her eyebrows at them, and indicated Cap and Tony  with her chin.
"You!" Thor bellowed, turning away from the Wrecker and moving towards Loki, mjolnir raised threateningly. "I might have known this was your doing, Loki! Not content with your previous treachery, you join forces with Chthon to destroy Mitgard itself. Odin's wrath over this will make his previous punishments for you seem as nothing."
"I know." It wasn't technically true; he could still increase his size if it were truly an emergency, he'd just pay for it later. Increasing size diluted chemicals in the bloodstream, so he was supposed to avoid it, but only shrinking would actually be dangerous. "I think I did pretty well for someone without powers or weapons." Especially considering that it had been far too long since he'd done this.
Tony nodded absently in acknowledgement, already accessing SHIELD's files on the current Lemurian political situation – both men had belonged to a radical faction that wanted to depose the current Empress and set up a separatist theocracy in her place – and shuffling through satellite newsfeeds one by one. Cracking the new encryption on SHIIELD's data and getting around their firewall took more effort than he had anticipated; he'd gotten used to having all of SHIELD's files at his fingertips, before he'd had to hand control of the organization back over to Fury. He didn't regret resigning as Director at all, but there were times when being locked out of SHIELD's databases once again were inconvenient. "The police are on the scene in the Upper East Side now," he said. "We probably have about six hours before the news reaches Lemuria. Was Barnes bleeding when you left the scene?"
Steve grinned, feeling ridiculously pleased. Pepper was one of the only people left who had known Tony longer than he had, and her opinion was important to Tony; it was good to know that she didn't have any problem with their relationship -- though given how long she'd worked for Tony, the fact that Tony liked men as well as women couldn't have been much of a surprise.
"Cap wouldn't let me take the Ferrari." Because he was still inwardly convinced that Clint was nineteen, and would crash it into a building or something. The only time Clint had ever wrecked a car, it had been entirely Jen's doing. Cap, on the other hand, had been responsible for the destruction of no less than half a dozen of SHIELD's flying cars, and his Harley had been rebuilt twice.
"He thought that if we made Thor a body, his soul, essence, whatever gods have, would come back."  One of Hank's wrists twitched against its cuff, as if he'd forgotten that he was chained up.  "Something about gods existing as long as people still believe in them — this from the man who says he hates magic.  But if you were already wandering around somewhere, Thor's soul couldn't come back, because you were already using it, so we got..." he broke off for a moment, enthusiasm visibly draining away, then finished, lamely, "what we got."
Loki smiled slightly; it was too much to hope that she hadn't noticed the way Doom had stiffened upon hearing Chthon's name. "He plans to use the spear's power to return himself to this dimension and crush it beneath his feet. His pawn is on the game board as well, and you will find him an even deadlier opponent than myself."
The Avengers' living room was a much less convenient place from which to run an international business than Tony's office was. However, thanks to threats from Pepper and a combination of blackmail and bribery from Steve, Tony had agreed to work from home for the day.
Tony gave up attempting to explain how innovative the device was — dimensional portal technology probably all looked the same to the untrained eye, anyway — and told her the abbreviated, journal-abstract version. "There's a characteristic instability in the energy signature that shows up only in high-energy physics equipment manufactured in Lemuria, China, and parts of the former Soviet Union, and judging by the energy signature and the fact the last Antarctic vibranium known to be in Lemurian hands was sold to Latveria, I'm ninety percent sure this device was built by Victor von Doom." Ripping off one of Reed Richard's designs, repurposing and improving it, and then pointedly using the result on Reed's home ground where he'd be sure to hear about it was also a strong indicator in favor of Doom, but it wasn't actually evidence. He told Hill and Sharon about the Latverian dignitaries who'd been given a tour of the Met instead.
"I've been asking myself that for years," Steve said. He had never like killing people, had hoped never to have to do it again, after the war had ended, but for the Red Skull, he'd always been more than willing to make an exception. Red Skull had earned death multiple times over, before the end, but had always seemed to escape it at the last moment, generally leaving a trail of innocent corpses in his wake.
He shuffled backwards, farther under the table, and jerked the table cloth down, hiding them from view.
He was debating the merits of re-introducing fleximetal into the armor's knee and elbow joints when the knocking was repeated.
"Wait, Rhodes was in the armor?" Cap stood up straighter, making it very obvious that he was four inches taller than Clint, his voice taking on that dangerous note it sometimes got when he was talking to supervillains. "I thought they'd just gotten into a fistfight or something. Why have I never heard about this?"
"Nothing." Tony lowered his face into his hands again, rubbing gently at his temples. His voice was flat, giving away no emotion. "The Extremis does this when I overuse it. Turn off the lights on your way out."
There were times when he hated trying to coordinate things with city authorities, especially now that he no longer had the authority of SHIELD to back him.
"I don't know," Sam said.  "I heard some explosions, but I didn't-" and then Steve wasn't listening anymore, because Tony had moaned faintly and turned his head slightly to the side, his eyes still closed.
Tony wasn't kissing back as eagerly anymore, though. His movements gradually became slower, more languid, and then he sighed a little and went limp.
It shouldn't make a difference, but it did. Maybe because of the cognitive dissonance of speaking with someone who sounded like -
The kitchen in Stark Tower's penthouse was not large enough to comfortably accommodate eight people, but the kitchen was where the team had always gathered to hold discussions too informal to have around a council room table, so once Loki had left and the men and women who had fled the building to huddle in little knots on the sidewalk outside had all come back in, and the police had been assured that there was no need for their presence, the kitchen was where everyone went.
"Can we not ask that question?" Clint called back over his shoulder. "He got pregnant the same way everyone else does, and I don't need to hear about it."
"We'll talk about this later," Steve said. Then he turned on his heel and left, leaving Tony standing motionless in the middle of the front hallway.
The weight of the steel beam abruptly lessened, something else taking over the job of supporting it.
Carol sighed, pushing her hair out of her face with one hand. "No," she said. "Tony's actually downplaying how nerve-wracking having everyone sit in judgment of you is."
Doom staggered back, swearing in Latverian, and Steve started to smile.  He couldn't see what Strange and Carol were doing, but from the sound of the curses he could hear Loki hissing, it was effective.
A swarm of SHIELD personnel were carrying Tony and Wanda to the helicopters on stretchers, and three of them were headed purposefully toward where the three of them were huddled on the ground.
Tony had seemed better lately, too, now that his ribs had finally healed and the Extremis-induced nosebleeds had gone away. He'd been less tense, as well. Of course, nearly a week arguing with politicians and military officials had probably put paid to that, but Steve was confident that it would only take a few hours alone with Tony to get him to relax again.
"You're about to not be pregnant now," Hank told him. Pain plus bleeding plus pregnant almost certainly equaled a miscarriage. Which could be relatively harmless to Tony - aside from the losing the baby part - or could be extremely dangerous, depending on
Steve and Sharon were the ones who got Barnes up and on his feet again, and the ones who snuck him into the trunk of the flying car Fury sent down to fetch Tony. They worked together with a smoothness that spoke of experience, and Tony bit back a sudden jealousy. He'd read both their SHIELD files. He knew they'd been on any number of missions together. He also knew exactly what had happened between them while Sharon had been under Dr. Faustus's control, and being jealous of a woman who had been mindcontrolled into sleeping with Steve and then shooting him was petty and wrong.
"You know that wasn't his fault," Luke objected.  "He would have been fine if that place had served food."
Steve was tempted to agree with her – surely even the Red Skull only got so many opportunities to cheat death – but there had been those last few moments before his second, final death when Lukin had been in control of his body again. Had approaching death given him the strength to seize control from Red Skull one last time, or had Red Skull already been gone? It was a question that had haunted Steve, at first, but as the summer had passed without any sign that Red Skull's death had been anything other than permanent, he had let himself relax, let himself believe, finally, that the Red Skull was truly dead and gone.
Except tonight, rather than laughing, everyone seemed to want to just stare at him. Some of them were people he didn't even know, who couldn't possibly recognize him as Tony Stark and were presumably staring because Jan had insisted on a backless dress. The halter-style top, which fastened around his neck and left his entire back bare to the waist, had been a compromise between her insistence that high necklines were not in style right now and Tony's inability to wear anything low cut without showing off a chest full of shrapnel scars.
Steve knelt on the tile floor to put himself at eye level with Tony, and rapped sharply on the shower door. "Tony. Are you all right?"
she was. She'd insisted on coming with them, as had Clint, but both of them were hanging back, following slowly behind the others as if they'd rather be anywhere else.
He could see his chances of that receding as Steve frowned and shook his head. "I haven't spoken to either of them in a week."
Strange winced, but didn't look away. "I didn't notice Chthon's presence in your mind. It didn't even occur to me to look. It was an arrogant mistake, and one that has cost you and many others a great deal."
It was ridiculous to feel as if he'd let the older man down when they barely knew one another, but Tony still felt an uncomfortable sense of shame when he thought about Byrd's probable opinion of his descent into drunken uselessness. Byrd had been one of the few people in either business or in Washington who had taken Tony seriously from the beginning. "He'll still be trying to get Iron Man to work for the government when they force him to retire thirty years from now. Iron Man's armor has never been for sale, gentlemen. That's not negotiable."
"Let me check," Tony said, the words muffled by Steve's costume.  "The mansion's systems aren't totally down.  I might just need to reboot them."  His voice sounded distant and faintly dreamy, and this time Steve didn't think it was due to his injuries.  He hissed through his teeth, an exclamation of pain he wouldn't normally have let himself make, and muttered something that sounded like snippets of programming language.
"He has to have something she wants desperately in order for her to be working with him at all, and if Thor's right, she's just lost her place as his most valuable ally.  She'd turn them over to him, if only in order to gloat about it."  Steve sounded sure of himself, but Tony had known him long enough to be able to tell when he was trying to convince himself as well as everyone else.
"I didn't want the doctors coming in yet," Tony said, not quite defensively. When he'd first woken up, and stretched out a tentative hand to touch Steve's hair to determine whether he was real, he'd sensed the signals from the monitors and reached out with the Extremis to block them, half-afraid that people were spying on him. He hadn't really registered that they were hospital equipment until Steve had woken up and proven himself very real indeed, and Tony had belatedly noticed the IV in his arm.
Strange, seated across from her and cradling a cup of tea in both gloved hands, looked nearly as worn out as she felt, the bones of his face standing out harshly; crafting seals strong enough to stand against a being as powerful as Chthon was a massive magical work, and even the Sorcerer Supreme apparently could not do it easily. Before he had set the seal on her, he had seemed magnetically appealing, attractive in a way she'd never seen before – even Vision and Simon couldn't have compared to the power Chthon's essence had sensed in him, and the trace of Chthon's taint in Wanda had been drawn to it, had wanted to pour itself into him, possess him as it had her.
And so would Wanda, and Hank.  And Clint would be fine, too, stupid broken ribs aside.  They had to be.
Lemuria. One of the Lemurian arms dealers Fury had had neutralized last month had dealt in explosives containing Antarctic vibranium. The money trail Tony had followed through what had felt like half the banks in Europe and Asia had ended in Latveria.
The Avengers Mansion was a good thirty blocks away, but if she took the subway – except that Chthon could probably reach her more easily underground, and if he did, she would be trapped in a metal tube with a dozen potential victims. And even if the Avengers Mansion were still standing, the rest of the Avengers had no magical abilities, no way to fight him. And no reason to help Wanda, or believe anything she told them.
Even with a healing factor, pushing himself like this would have been wearing Tony down, and without it, he was going to end up working himself to the point of collapse.
Rhodey's smile faltered, and he shook his head. "I am not prepared for this level of weird," he stated. "Just turn it off, or down, or whatever, okay, Tony?"
right, aside from a low iron count - not surprising, since women generally had lower iron counts than men - but there might be some anomaly Hank hadn't noticed yet.
Both Sharon and the Winter Soldier stiffened and turned to run when Tony opened the front door, and he had a split second, staring into the muzzles of two guns, to realize how stupid startling injured black ops agents was, before Steve's voice came from behind him, "Put the gun away and get inside, Bucky. Sharon. Nice to see you."
Steve was right – it had been an obvious move, and as fast as Steve was, Tony still ought to have been able to avoid it, or at least avoid being so thoroughly pinned. What was wrong with him today? Tony was nowhere near Steve's level in hand to hand combat, and never would be, but he usually managed to avoid being flat on his back twice in under two minutes.
Flirting with one's co-workers and subordinates was one thing. Actually touching them crossed the line from harmless fun into outright harassment.
He gave Pepper his best puppy dog eyes, and she relented. "He says that dinner is at seven, and he'll meet you at the restaurant."
Steve smiled, ignoring the sting as it pulled at his lip. The term 'boyfriend' sounded silly as a description, as least when it came to himself and Tony, but there wasn't really a term that properly defined what they were to each other. 'Lover' implied that their whole relationship was about sex, and 'partner'... Bucky had been Steve's partner, and Sam. "I'll do that," Steve said.
"Well, I guess you are Spiderman," she said, eyes widening for a second, before her expression eased into amusement. "Second floor, left wing, room 37a. Do you wear some kind of device that lets you do that, or is it organic?" she asked, tugging at the strand of webbing that was now attached to the corner of her clipboard.
Loki's finger slid slowly down the side of his face, coming to rest under his chin. "If you reconsider, Son of Odin, you have but to call me. I am always willing to negotiate. You have but to hold this ring, and utter my name, and I shall hurry hence to do thy bidding." Her hand closed around his right wrist, gripping just hard enough to remind him that she could crush every one of the delicate bones there with a single squeeze, and forced his clenched fingers open, folding them closed again around something hard and round.
Tony started to protest - every hour not spent working on this was another hour that he spent trapped in this alien body, not to mention that Clint has given them forty-eight hours to fix this before he called Steve and the other Avengers on the East Coast, and had them bring Strange in on it - but Wanda over-rode him.
"Here you go." Tony handed it back. "That's the closest functional camera to the crime scene. Hit the star key, and you can switch to the next camera over. If someone calls, let it ring, because as soon as you either close the phone or answer a phone call, the program will terminate and erase itself from your phone."
Tony raised his hands and let his repulsors charge, preparing to incinerate the book in Doom's hands if he didn't comply.  He would find some way to appease the museum later, if he had to.
Strange spread his hands. "Even the power of the Sorcerer Supreme pales beside that of an elder god. I, too, would not be able to accomplish the task alone. I have faced Chthon before, but never at his full power."
Clint thrust his bow between Doom's legs, hooking his other ankle, and Doom staggered forward just in time to slam into Steve's shield as Steve thrust the flat of it at his face.  His momentum added force to the blow, and even with his shield protecting his hand, Steve could feel the impact all the way to his shoulder.
Tony's suit was perfectly pressed, and his hair was neat, mainly because Jan had whacked his hand down whenever he'd tried to reach up and mess with it, but there were circles under his eyes again.
"Mine," Clint said. He held up his own glass and proclaimed, in solemn tones, "I never lost my virginity to Sharon Carter in the back seat of a flying car."
He and Tony might be barely speaking to one another these days, but in a fight, it turned out, their old partnership functioned as well as it ever had. It was almost possible to forget that the person inside the armor wasn't the same man he had known for years, that they weren't friends anymore.
Steve put down the boot he had been cleaning and went to the door. Tony's appointment with Strange must be over.
"Primarily on your heart," she said, because it was always his heart, no matter how many times he thought he'd found a way to fix it, "which was damaged when the Mandarin electrocuted you. And when you were poisoned two months ago. And I doubt it helped when you were electrocuted by that other supervillain last month, either." She rubbed at her scarred cheek with one hand, grimacing. "Under normal conditions, the damage should be completely healed by now, with no sign that an injury ever occurred. Instead, they've healed incompletely, leaving small amounts of myocardial scar tissue, because what healing factor you have left is too busy trying to keep up with what you've been doing to yourself to finish the job. The headaches, the dizziness, the shortness of breath are all warning signs, Tony. They're your body saying 'screw this, I've had enough.' Congratulations; you've managed to turn what was supposed to be my cancer-curing masterpiece into a health-destroying cyberpunk wet dream."
The X-Men would know for certain, would probably be able to give her every detail of what had happened to her brother over the past year, but asking them was out of the question. No mutant who knew what she had done was ever going to willingly speak to her again. Not to the woman who had accomplished with one sentence what Reverend Stryker and dozens of other anti-mutant Extremists had tried to achieve for decades. Even Pietro, if he was all right, might not want anywhere near him.
Tony heard a quick intake of breath from Steve, and, nearly simultaneously, a scraping sound from behind them.  The armor's sensors registered movement; one of the Doombots was stirring.
Tony flinched, and closed his eyes, scooting back several inches so that he was sitting up against the back of the bed. "I didn't mean to," he whispered, voice hoarse. "I don't know what happened. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to."
The metal bent and crumpled, creating an inch-wide gap, and the two of them attacked it together, Steve holding Tony flat to the floor while Thor ripped the crumpled piece of metal off.
Matt's boots were silent on the stone floor as he came to stand beside Strange, the soles made of soft leather, or something else designed to let him move with barely a sound. "Do you... hear something?" he asked quietly. His chin was tilted up, his head cocked slightly to the left, as if he were trying to pinpoint the source of a sound. "Something whispering?" Strange began to say no, his attention still on the coil of energy in front of him, when he heard it, a faint susurrus of sound just within the threshold of audibility. As soon as he became aware of it, the volume increased, until it sounded as if someone – or something – was whispering in his ear, the words too garbled to make out.
Looking at him right now, in the worn out and grease-stained jeans and undershirt he wore when doing welding and metal working and, as now, when he had no other clothes available, it was difficult to imagine Tony posing on the cover of any magazine, let alone one devoted to men's fashion.
"Transian," Wanda corrected automatically. "It's a dialect of Rumanian." Technically speaking, anyway. The dialect spoken around Mount Wungadore bore about as much similarity to standard Rumanian as Portuguese did to Spanish. "I'm very out of practice with English," she continued, offering the flight attendant an apologetic smile. "I haven't spoken it in months."
"Starting with how we can be sure Chthon's influence is truly gone." The words felt stiff in Tony's mouth, accusatory. The last thing Wanda probably needed right now was more blame, not when she knew very well what Chthon had used her to do, and what it had cost them all – Vision, Scott Lang, Clint, until his unexplained return, very nearly the team itself – but it had to be said.
The next group of SHIELD personal who trespassed across his borders to investigate some supposed “human rights violation” were not going to be leaving again.  Ever.
They probably looked ridiculous, lurching down the hallway like a pair of walking wounded, but no one else was awake to see them. When they reached Tony's bedroom, Tony made a faint, amused sound, and said,
"She brought me back from the dead, and she healed Cap's broken jaw that time in England. Maybe she could have kept that guy alive."
The only West Coast team members with any interest in cooking at all were John Walker - whose culinary abilities mainly extended to grilling or deep frying things, which Wanda wouldn't have minded except that he never cleaned the kitchen afterwards - Wanda herself, and Hank, who tended to treat any food he cooked as if it were a chemistry experiment, sometimes with disturbing results.
"You could have been hurt." Steve let go of Tony, pulling away, and Tony opened his eyes to find Steve watching him seriously. "And we wouldn't have been able to help you. I can't believe I never asked for your new override codes."
Staring at her felt painfully awkward, suddenly, as if he were seeing things he wasn't supposed to. Seeing her naked – except he'd already done that. Clint turned away, pacing over to the nearest lab bench, the one where Hank's fume hood sat, looking like something out of a CSI episode. One where they were dealing with radiation poisoning or some kind of death-by-contagious-disease. Beyond it, in the back corner of the lab, hundreds of ants trundled their way through a glass-walled ants' nest, completely unaffected by Clint and Wanda's presence. "I thought I was going crazy, at first, or that... I don't know what I thought." He reached for one of the little test tubes, then remembered that if he touched anything down here, it would probably poison him or give him chemical burns. "That I'd made you sleep with me in return for not bringing you in, maybe."
"Steve, about..." Tony took a deep breath, bracing himself inwardly. "About the marriage. I don't consider any promises made binding anymore, everything's changed."
"He used me to destroy the Avengers. How much did I..." she trailed off, then tried again. "Is everyone that's... left... okay?"
"No, it's all right," Tony interrupted. "I don't mind. Since I'm stuck with this body at least until morning, I might as well start figuring out how it works."
Sam leaned his weight against the door to make sure it was fully shut while Steve keyed in the electronic lock. It beeped once, then engaged, unaffected by Wanda's presence only a few feet away; Tony had designed it to be resistant to energy fluctuations.
If it took her in the throat edge-on, the shield would crush her windpipe or break her neck, but if the hole burned through her chest wasn't killing her, that wouldn't either.
That was always such a satisfying move to perform, Steve reflected. Dangerous to use on anyone who didn't share Hyde's enhanced durability, though; if his shield collided with someone's face at the wrong angle, it could drive bone fragments into their brain and kill them.
"Hm. I guess only Carol counted, then," Wanda was saying thoughtfully. Everyone else was still staring at Steve.
All the medical equipment and bioscience stuff remained, or examining Wanda would have required taking her back to Oklahoma, to his vastly-less-well-equipped-than-anything-Tony-owned clinic. Advanced diagnostic equipment was hard to come by in the middle of nowhere, and Thor had deliberately chosen the middle of nowhere to rebuild Asgard.
Wanda froze; everything in her wanted to turn and run, but her body wasn't listening, and she knew, suddenly, that this, this
It had taken all of Jan' powers of persuasion to keep him from asking the poor kid for a tissue sample from his wrist. '
"You know," Sam said, after he had given Steve several silent minutes to appreciate the woodcut's workmanship, "I keep renewing my membership, but I don't think I've been here in a year."
"Not everyone wants to hear apologies," Wanda said, "or explanations." There was a rustle of cloth as she shifted on the worktable; its hard, metal surface couldn't have been comfortable, but Hank hadn't moved the couch in yet. It, like the ants and other live specimens, would be transported last, after all the equipment was in place. "I... tried to call the X-Men. Only Beast would talk to me, and he won't tell me where Pietro is. He just wants to know how I did what I did, and if I can undo it more completely."
Grant adjusted her glasses and consulted the sheaf of papers on the table before her, the gesture almost certainly for show. "The reports from the scientific division on the green energy project are promising. If we allocate more resources to the project and foreground it, the media buzz should be positive, as should the investor reactions. Alternatives to fossil fuels aren't as much of a concern right now as they were this time last year, but there's still a lot of interest."
"He doesn't belong to a cult anymore," Steve pointed out, in the interest of fairness. "The Triune Understanding hasn't existed in years, and Delroy's part of the reason why." He'd been deeply angry when he had learned that the religion whose tenets he'd believed in so strongly had been a front for a crazy megalomaniac's attempt to build himself a power base.
Ignoring him as if he hadn't spoken, Wanda leaned forward and brushed her fingertips across midtown, bringing her index finger to a halt at Times Square.  "Strange is convinced Doom's ritual to access the spear's power and ascend to godhood will have to be performed here.  Some magics are better performed at a crossroads, and Times Square is the biggest crossroads in the world."
The dizziness and pain were fading, but he still felt shaky, and while he could put on a smile for reporters while far more seriously injured than this, the others more than had this one covered. They didn't need Tony here to pose for the cameras.
Hill stared at him, her face expressionless. "That's fascinating, Tony. Is any of it actually significant?"
"Right," Jan said. "In that case, let's move on to the next item on the agenda. Hercules officially requests that he be moved from the injured list to reserve member status, citing family responsibilities on Olympus. All in favor?"
"So make everyone else uncomfortable, too. Go on the offensive. You can insert your own sports-related analogy here."
"Yes," Tony said, thankful that he was facing away from Steve, that Steve wouldn't be able to see the lie in his face.
"You do realize what those people would do with your X-gene research, right?" he asked. "Not all of them have been impeached or suspended."
At least he knew now that he could still function in a combat or rescue situation even when Tony was involved; he hadn't fallen apart until after they'd gotten to the hospital.
Chthon could have done anything to her, during the long year when Tony had preferred to ignore her existence because he didn't want to deal with it. Used her to kill, warping her powers and will into a weapon the way he had on M-Day. Influenced her thoughts, planted suggestions and commands in her brain...
"Oh, it won't be because I'm a woman." If there was one thing his fellow businessmen excelled at, it was finding justifications for not hiring or promoting women or minorities that didn't actually involve their being women and minorities. Tony had used it to his advantage before; people who'd been unjustly passed over for promotion three times tended to jump at the chance to leave their current place of employ and come and work for him, especially when he offered them the higher paying job with greater responsibility that they should have already had. "It will be because they 'don't believe' I'm really Tony Stark, or because being transformed into a woman has clearly unhinged my mind, or they're concerned for my health, or something."
Steve had only Jan's shouted cry of warning when the first of Sin's serpent squad leapt up from behind the stone plinth that supported a statue of Dionysus and threw himself at Carol. Maybe the man assumed that being both female and completely empty-handed would make her the easiest to take down.
Wanda let her carry-on bag fall to the muddy ground of Strange's minuscule front yard – a tiny patch of green that was a spacious luxury by Manhattan standards – and limped up the front steps, walking straight through the non-existent "Starbucks – Coming Spring of '08" banner.
Tony stared at him, a world of lesser evils and silent evenings spent sitting in a lab with Reed, all three of them wrapped in their own misery and none of them talking about it, in his eyes. Then he looked away.
The living room was dark, lit only by the light from the windows and the faint glow of the digital clock on the DVD player. Tony was a dark shape on the couch, face buried in his hands. As Steve stepped into the room, he heard Tony sigh; he obviously knew Steve was there, even if he wasn't looking up.
Maybe he had torn or ruptured something inside himself yesterday. Maybe he'd been bleeding internally for the past twenty-four hours, in small enough amounts that the effects were only now catching up to him. It had happened before.
Stop it, Steve told himself. The last thing Tony's going to let you do is use him for figure-drawing practice. Talk about just using someone for their body...
It had been a very, very long day. Why couldn't Clint have picked a different night to have one of his periodic crises of confidence over his leadership abilities or perceived lack thereof? And why did the lust spell have to involve
He stared at Steve's chest, not meeting his eyes, as Steve went on, "You would have gone out and taken care of it on your own, without telling me or anyone else or asking anyone for help, just like you tried to do with your stolen armor."
at him with huge, crazed eyes, occasionally reaching up with one questing paw to hook his claws through a loop of sinew or shred a fletch. Then he'd grab a thread of sinew in his teeth and run off to eat it, freezing every few feet to glance back and make sure Clint didn't want to follow him.
Sam nodded. "Longer than you know. Things were getting bad before you came back. Englehart's superhero legislation's going to set a real bad precedent if it passes, but it's a drop in the bucket compared with what was going on before."
The Night Nurse shook her head. "I don't know. Daredevil's account of the situation isn't very detailed. I was hoping you could tell me what's wrong with him. That astral projection form of his ought to be hovering over in the corner telling me how to do my job, but instead he's just lying there."
Wanda blinked. "You're joking, right? This bag has half the clothes I own in it." She hefted the duffle bag, which was, admittedly, large, but still barely big enough to contain a week's worth of clothing, when you added shoes, and offered Jan a wry smile. "I usually try to travel light, but we didn't know how long this would take."
"I'm not dropping down from active duty," Tony added fiercely, "so don't even suggest it. It's not an option right now, not while Doom and Sin and Chthon are all out there."
"In that case, I think you're all right. But tell me if you start experiencing any unusual symptoms; mind control on this scale, for this long, isn't really covered in medical literature." He shook his head, smiling ruefully. "At least, not that I've read. I've missed a couple of years' worth of it."
He shoved the worries aside with an effort, and spent the next ten minutes coaxing Redwing down off the roof of a neighboring building.
And to think that he'd thought the Avengers' biggest problem right now was the fact that Tony was a woman.
"How powerful is she?" Hank had folded his arms across his chest, the glass pipette forgotten in his left hand.
"No," Jan said. "I know what that's like. You used to have a crush on her, and then she betrayed us, and the fact that part of you wanted to forgive her just because she was staring at you with those big blue eyes and looking all wounded made you even angrier."
"It's why we love you," Tony said. Not 'why I love you,' Steve noted. "Don't tell anyone about this, all right? I meant it when I told Wanda that I didn't want anyone to know." His jaw set, and Steve recognized the flash of stubborn determination in his eyes, and the panic lurking behind it. "I just want this over with as soon as possible, and as quietly as possible."
More like witchcraft. Like the spell Agatha had shown her to make her own womb conceive when she shouldn't have been able to.
"Keep people from being killed," Steve interrupted. "I grasp that. I just don't understand why you wouldn't listen to me, why you had to put people's safety at risk."
They should probably be grateful Tony wasn't out there desperately seducing everyone in sight, with the kind of manic, obsessive overkill he'd displayed when trying to get his armor back. Clearly, the loss of his technology was something he'd perceived as an even greater violation than having the integrity of his own body compromised.
"You will get your revenge later," Doom said, with admirable patience. "After we've gotten the spear." There was a reason he usually preferred not to work with the criminally insane, and he was reminded of that anew with each day of his association with Synthia Schmidt. The Red Skull might have been Nazi scum, but at least he had been coherent and lucid. And the thought of how deeply it would have offended the Red Skull to know that he would have owed his ultimate revenge over his greatest enemy to one of the undesirable people his kind had wanted to destroy had almost made the struggle to stand in his presence and not kill him worth it. Doom had savored that thought almost as much as he now savored the fact that it had been his own actions in reviving Steve Rogers from the dead that had brought about the Red Skull's demise. "You do remember the spear, don't you?" he asked the Skull's psychotic daughter, not bothering to keep the contempt from his voice.
Steve shook his head. "It didn't seem like a sacrifice at the time. I fought alongside people who were willing to give their lives for a country that didn't even treat them as full citizens; compared to that, I felt like I had it easy. I wish now, though, that I'd spoken up, come out sooner. I never tried very hard to hide it, I never lied about myself, but... people see me as a role model, as something to look up to, because of what the costume I wear represents. And I don't know if they're always right to do that, but I think it makes visibility important." Tony could hear the sincerity in his voice. Steve never gave himself to things half-heartedly; when he believed in something, he was ready to sacrifice and fight for it. He'd lay money that Steve felt guilty about not being openly out, that he believed it was his responsibility to be an example to others, some kind of duty that he'd been shirking. "I never had any role models who were gay or bisexual growing up," Steve went on. "There were men who everyone knew were fairies or queer or a variety of other lovely words the Bugle's editors are not going to let you print, but people didn't talk about it."
Couldn't he have done that before? They could have been out of here hours ago if... no, Don reminded himself, not with no idea where they were and whether or not Doom was about to come charging in at any second.  Once Doom or Sin had realized that Hank could use his powers to slip free of his chains, they would have taken precautions to prevent it, probably involving some kind of energy bubble like the one Jan was imprisoned in.  When you only had one ace in the hole, it was better not to waste it.
Chthon's energy vanished, burned away, but the power kept pouring out of her, draining away into the dimensional walls until there was nothing left. Until the walls of Chthon's prison were solid again.
"You make it look easy," Hank said. Then he flushed. "Sorry. I know it's over between us, I do. I just... you're the most beautiful woman I've ever known, and I can't not notice it."
Supposedly, anyway. The tight ache in his head at the moment said otherwise, but it was probably just a residual headache from yesterday's attack, made worse by spending half the day staring at computer screens.
Strange would have been able to teleport himself away. Agatha probably could, too, if she had Chthon's power at her beck and call. Wanda didn't have that option.
Loki cocked her head, horned headdress casting distorted shadows on the pavement.  "Think you your mortal weapons can harm me?"
He wrapped his arms around Tony, tightly enough that he knew it probably hurt, and buried his face in Tony's shoulder. The prickly hair of Tony's goatee scraped against his skin, and his shirt smelled like oil and some kind of eye-watering industrial solvent. Steve closed his eyes, and didn't pull away. "I believe you."
"Well," he said after a moment, "you don't have an ectopic pregnancy." Which ruled out Hank's other worst case scenario, since that would have required surgery, something he wasn't equipped to perform by any stretch of the imagination. "I don't see any blood clots either." Which could case pain and bleeding just as a miscarriage could, not to mention embolisms. No blood clots also meant no placental abruption.
Steve caught himself before he finished the thought, reminding himself that they had every right to publish photos taken at public events, just as Floyd had every right to print things that were technically true even if he didn't like them.
"No," he told it firmly, pushing it away from the closing doors with his cane. "You're not going down there."
Sam turned to stare at the damaged lamppost, his eyebrows going up. "If it had been one of the old, wrought-iron ones, it wouldn't have bent like that."
Tony wobbled on his feet, leaning on Steve's shoulder. "Just get me to a power outlet and I'll be fine."
"Which is why you answer your email and run virus scans on your armor while we're in bed together." Steve turned away, stripping off his sweat-soaked shirt, and tossed it onto a weight bench.
"What do you mean, not binding?" Steve demanded, and Tony had to look away from the expression on his face. He was doing this for Steve's own good, he reminded himself, giving him a graceful out now, without the humiliation of trying to make it work and failing. "Nothing's changed!"
Loki dove for it, hitting the ground in a swirl of green cloak and flashing gold.   Her fingers came within inches of the spear's haft—
If someone had asked him, three days ago, if he would allow Strange and Wanda to change him back if the price for it was losing Steve, he would have told them no.
Steve spun around, shield at the ready, to find Atlas stretched full length on the ground, out cold, with Sam sitting on his back. Zemo was standing stock still, covered in thick, ropey strands of Adhesive X; his rifle was completely coated in it and utterly useless. There were grass clippings all over him, stuck to the globs of adhesive. He looked like he'd been tarred and feathered.
At least his absence hadn't been as bad as last month, when Steve had found himself unable to sleep without Tony's warm presence in his bed to keep nightmares at bay. Only after he had finally given in and called Tony at sometime after one in the morning had he been able to fall asleep.
The duty nurse had been right – there didn’t seem to be any serious damage.  “You’re lucky you still have a central nervous system,” he told Hank, as he put the chart back in place.  “What were you thinking? ”
Steve threw his shield at the same moment that Clint loosed his arrow, already running forward as he did so.
Steve hauled him over to the couch and pushed him gently down onto it. There was one free socket on the wall outlet, but Steve unplugged the lamp anyway. It gave him something to do, and for all he knew, Tony might need both outlets.
He’d seen Tony unconscious in hospital beds so often by now that there shouldn’t have been any drama left to it.  Even the IV line in his arm and oxygen canula in his nose, and the wide swath of bandaging around his torso shouldn’t have been anything new or frightening.  He had looked worse after heart surgery, and when Steve had visited him in the hospital after he had stopped drinking, when he’d disappeared for all those weeks.
"I'm sorry," Steve said, wretchedly. Had what he and Tony had done made the spell worse? Goddamnit, they should have been more careful, and not just about using protection. It was possible that the mere act of having sex as a woman had done something to the spell. "I- does he have any idea how to break the spell? Does Wanda?"
The rest of the team — minus Thor and Carol — were waiting in the front hallway. Sam and Jan were already in costume, and Clint, whose costume didn't entirely fit under his clothes, was sitting at the bottom of the steps, pulling on one purple boot. His mask lay crumpled on the stair next to him, waiting.
Clint hated having his own logic turned against him. "Fine," he said. "But I'm coming right back up as soon as they slap a band-aid on me."
Tony closed his eyes and concentrated on breathing, pressing one hand against the ache in his chest and letting the wall hold him up. He didn't have panic attacks. He'd been blown up, tortured, shot, gone under the knife for open heart surgery, and come out the other side of all of it still perfectly able to function under pressure.
The flight back to Stark Tower was uneventful, if even colder than before. By the time they were over Times Square, Jan had lost all feeling in her fingers and toes. Hank was either treating her winter gloves and boots with Pym particles tonight, or he was sleeping in his lab. Which would probably be a more effective threat if he didn't frequently do that anyway, because he'd worked on something non-stop until he crashed.
There had to be an empty hospital bed waiting for Wanda to return to it.  Steve was tired enough that his eyes ached and his whole body felt hollow, and he hadn’t channeled colossal amounts of magical power.
Steve had heard people claim that men who'd broken or been damaged and healed were stronger in the broken places. It would have been nice if that were true, but he knew from experience that it wasn't. He still had nightmares about explosions and ice and falling when things around him got bad, the way they had recently, and he knew perfectly well that that didn't make him "stronger," anymore than the number Ultron had done on his head had made Hank stronger, or being taken apart and temporarily losing his emotional connection to the rest of them had made Vision stronger.
He would never get used to that unmarred perfection, no matter how often he saw it, touched it. Never get tired of it, either. The memory of the gaping wound in Steve's stomach, strangely bloodless in the autopsy photos, the better to reveal the blackened power burns around it, was going to be in his dreams forever. It was there even when he was awake, sometimes, a ghostly overlay when he looked at Steve. It didn't happen as often, anymore, but like the memory of Happy's face the last time he had seen him – black and purple and completely unrecognizable, and totally absent of any life, the sound of his heart monitor a cruel mockery in Tony's ears – he knew it would never leave him entirely.
Steve studied the image on the screen in front of him; the security camera still was blurry and pixilated, but he didn't need to see the woman in the picture's face to recognize her. The way she held herself, the gun she carried, the knife strapped to the outside of her thigh would have been enough even without the blurred glimpse of curly hair.
They were through the door in moments, Steve taking point, with his shield up to block any potential assault. The dining room was a mess; broken porcelain and glass littered the carpet, and half the tables had been over-turned. Things were calmer than he had expected, though not in any way Steve found comforting; most of the people were huddled in corners or unconscious on the floor. Carol was giving a middle-aged man CPR, and a dark-skinned woman lay on the floor inches from the door, hands bloody and fingernails ripped away. Steve had to step over her to enter the room.
Steve shook his head.  “It wouldn’t work.  You’re too tall, and you weigh too much.”  Even slightly underweight from his recent hospital stay, Tony had a good four inches and thirty pounds on Sharon.  Steve could pick him up, with a little effort, but tossing him around a dance floor in some of the more athletic swing moves wasn’t going to happen.
The question was so far out of left field that Clint nearly answered it by reflex, despite the fact that had nothing to do with what he was trying to talk about, but Hank didn't give him a chance. "That's you," he said, waving at the bottom line of DNA. "That's Wanda," the top one, "these two in the middle are me and Jan, and
"Sorry about that." And now it was Clint's turn to be awkward. "I was pretty confused those first couple of months back. The only part I really remember was trying to hunt down the Witch, to see if I could get her to tell me what she'd done. Why she killed me. Why she brought me back."
"Where are the others?" Jan asked.  She was crouched on the floor of her prison, peering down at whatever Hank was trying to do to the circuitry and mechanisms inside the thing's wide base.  "Maybe they'll rescue us."
Seemingly unimpressed, Sin folded both arms over her chest, glaring at him. "He killed Brock. I want him to suffer. And he shot Daddy in the head. He needs to pay." She said the words with a degree of venom completely at odds with her cheerful, freckle-faced appearance. "I wanted him to know I was coming for him."
Her eyes were still tearing up as she rounded the first corner and nearly ran smack into a dark-clothed man with an assault rifle.
"Are you all right, Tony?" he asked. "Were you guys able to stop Loki?" Tony looked unhurt, his armor undamaged, but that didn't always mean anything.
Agatha's house had always been filled with a comfortingly old-fashioned collection of Victorian clutter, but Strange went her one better. The walls were lined with book shelves, most of them jammed with leather-bound books, but some of them holding statues of strange, tentacled monsters, braziers cast in fanciful shapes, crystal balls of various sizes and colors, including several made from actual rock crystal, and one subtlety inhuman skull. The lettering on the spines of some of the books seemed to writhe when she wasn't looking directly at it.
Steve looked away, giving them a moment of privacy; Tony was on the other side of the room, smiling stiffly at a vaguely familiar-looking man whom Steve was fairly sure was involved in city politics somehow. He, unlike Hank, didn't have a single fold of fabric out of place, for all that his hair was artfully disheveled in a way that probably looked intentional, but was actually Steve's fault. Tony usually wore suits and dress shirts, unless he was planning to spend some quality time tearing machinery apart, and he always looked good in them, but when he made a real effort to dress nicely, as he had tonight, the impulse to muss up and pull apart that perfectly constructed armor of suit and tie was irresistible.
They had no idea what the substance the people in the building had been exposed to, or how widespread the contamination was -- all they had was Jan's alarmingly vague description. If they were lucky, whatever it was had only been released on the top floor. If they were unlucky, the building had one those ventilation systems that recycled air from room to room, and the toxin had been vented into every part of the building by now.
Tony checked his watch. It was a quarter to six, which meant that if he wanted to be out of the building in time to meet Steve in Manhattan at seven, he would have to leave pretty much immediately. And so would Pepper. "How long were you going to make me wait before you told me that I was about to be late?" he asked.
Steve skidded to a halt at the base of the Metropolitan Museum's front steps, where a cordon of police officers had blocked off access. Three of them were standing in a huddle around Tony, while the rest of the Avengers stood impatiently a few feet away.
The vault had foot-thick steel alloy walls, with half-inch adamantium plating. It was meant to contain dangerous and potentially explosive tech, including Tony, if the Extremis were ever hacked again.
Clint couldn't think of any response to that that wasn't more immature than he was willing to be with anyone who wasn't Cap, so he went. Like Sam had said, they'd call him if Jan needed him, or if she and Tony suddenly got worse, or... And anyway, Cap wasn't going to let anything happen to them.
"How is that any of our business?" Cap  asked.  He stretched as he sat down, laying one arm over the back of  Tony's chair.  Again with the subtlety and lack thereof.
"If you don't get some sleep, I'm going to get Jan to take you off active duty until-" Tony had his eyes closed, Steve realized, and was frowning thoughtfully, fingers still pressed against the side of his face as if to hold his skull together. Steve stopped pacing abruptly. "Are you using the Extremis?"
"The Wasp is apparently hysterical, and Tony isn't responding to anyone, not even Cap. It's really freaky, MJ. When I went in to see him, he told me to get out before I died, too, but I don't think he actually heard anything I said, and Cap is really scared. He's never scared!" Hank was obviously scared, too, which wasn't as frightening as Cap losing it, but still wasn't exactly reassuring. Peter couldn’t be sure, since there’d been no way he was going to ask, but from the way Cap had been watching Tony with a gaze almost as fixed and unwavering as the one Tony had on him, Peter thought he might be worried that Tony wasn't going to come out of it.
Clint, Bobbi, Wanda, and Tigra looked unscathed, though Bobbi's costume was missing a sleeve, the trailing fabric torn away. Hank wasn't surprised; as long and full as her sleeves were, they were bound to get caught on things.
Steve gave Tony a look, which Tony didn't appear to notice. By this point, he'd probably forgotten that his lab was supposed to be off limits for the day. "Have fun," Steve sighed, giving up. He turned to Rhodey. "I'll walk you out."
"That's not actually all that funny." Steve's voice was only mildly disapproving, making it obvious that his heart wasn't in the objection. "You shouldn't threaten supervillains with hypothetical prison assault."
"I'll..." Tony started, then stopped, and began again, "I should have read those emails. Maybe she was trying to warn us before this hit newsstands, or maybe I could have talked her out of it by giving her something else to print." He sounded calm, his face forced back into a careful lack of expression, but Steve wasn't fooled; he was probably blisteringly angry with himself for slipping up in such an obvious way, not to mention humiliated by the idea of thousands of readers seeing that photo of him at Steve's funeral. Tony didn't like publicly losing control of himself.
"Are you sure you want to? Like, you're not going to be able to take this back. Everyone will know."
"No one. I'm not-" He couldn't think of how to explain this to Bobbi. It was too humiliating and disgusting to blurt out the details to Clint's wife. "Just get me Hank, okay? I need Hank."
He'd been so absorbed in gene sequencing and neurochemistry data and toxin analysis that it had taken barely any persuasion to get him to promise not to discuss the X-gene theory with anyone other than his fellow Avengers and Beast.
something wrong with it, with both of them – but he had never been very good at these kinds of conversations. But if Peter could unmask in front of cameras, Steve could hardly do less.
Jan shook her head — uselessly, since Carol was ahead and to the left of her, and couldn't see the gesture. "If he's hiding, I don't want to think about what it will be like when he stops hiding. Train wrecks, two collapsed buildings, a gas main explosion, that squid... and Tony thinks the air traffic control mix up at JKR yesterday was his influence, too."
Hill shrugged one shoulder. "For our purposes, it doesn't matter whether she's actually hearing her dead father's voice in her head or just thinks she is."
Fury, he was sure, knew Tony was monitoring his organization's communications. The fact that he'd said nothing, and hadn't had any of the various computer hackers Tony had personally hired or promoted into their current positions attempt to throw him out probably meant something. Maybe it was an apology for continually foisting Koening and Gyrich off on him.
On the one hand, Steve probably ought to find Rhodey's explanation reassuring. On the other hand... "Baron von Blitzschlag?" he repeated slowly. "I'm pretty sure I heard his name during the war, and I think it was in connection with Heinrich Zemo." And possibly with Red Skull's German supersoldier project as well.
She was sitting on the floor a few feet away from Clint, and when she bent her head to look at the cards, he had a perfect view of the tattoo at the base of her neck. It was weirdly captivating, drawing the eye from the knobs of her spine up to the edge of her hairline.
"I'm going to need to recalibrate my armor again," Tony added. If anything, he looked pleased at the thought. "Do I have your permission to go, doctors?" He offered the room - minus Steve - a small smirk that once again looked at home on his face, though the lack of a moustache to frame it was still jarring.
"The incredibly disturbing bleeding has stopped," Tony said, in a monotone. "Please tell me that means this is over, I'm no longer pregnant, and we can never discuss this again."
"He'd better hope it's the cell phone reception in Asgard," Steve said, in an undertone just low enough that Ben probably didn't hear it. "Because if he's not either there or on the subway-"
"We may not have to fight either," Steve said, with determined optimism. "Wanda only said that he wants to break free, not that he actually can. Without her to take the spear for him, he's in the same place he's always been."
She hadn't lived there, despite the false memories of sharing the cottage with her "aunt" that had been poured into her head. She'd been a prisoner there, not only in the house, but in her own body, her own mind.
Carol shook her head. "I know that now. It doesn't actually make it easier. How long did it take before you wanted to be in the same room as Hank again?"
The sound of hollow, clanking steps behind her warned Wanda just in time.  She turned, throwing a shield of chaos energy around herself, and a mailed fist grazed her cheek.  For an instant, there was no pain, only a dull feeling of impact, and then her face started to throb.
Steve had only been in his new apartment for a week, but he'd been proud of it. As soon as he'd led Tony inside, however, he found himself gazing around the place with a critical eye, trying to imagine how it must look to Tony.
Steve winced. He'd been dealing just fine with the prospect of Tony getting an abortion, but something about hearing him say it so bluntly, especially while he sat there looking so wan and tired... Maybe it was better this way, though. Losing the baby on his own was more natural, and probably less likely to result in horrible complications.
Sam grabbed his wrist with one hand, fingers digging into his tendons, and slammed the butt of his stolen energy-gun into the man's stomach with the other.  He had been well-trained, wherever Sin had dug him up from; he didn't drop the knife.
He lunged at Tony, and Tony sidestepped, grabbed one of Steve's wrists, and forced his arm up behind his back in an arm-lock. "How long," he asked, saying the words directly into Steve's ear, "fifteen minutes?" He didn't have to try and make his voice husky – lack of breath and proximity to Steve did that for him.
His attacker collapsed to the floor, clutching with both hands at his shoulder, his face twisted in pain.  There was blood everywhere, bright red, and the sound of semi-automatic weapons fire was deafening.
Wanda's lips tightened, and she looks away, rubbing at the back of one hand. "I didn't think of that. I'm the one who brought him here."
None of that mattered right now, anyway, not compared to their real problems, like whether it was really a good idea to have Tony on the team. He needed to stay in New York as long as Strange and Wanda were still working to fix him, and it would be a waste of resources to have Iron Man in New York City and
There was a moment of silence, while everyone struggled to keep their smiles in place for the news crews. "Like Doom," Tony said.
Outside, the air was cool — 57 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the armor's sensors — and the sky had already turned the deep blue of twilight. Carol swooped downward out of the sky as they hit the front gate.
Steve hit the ground hard, just managing to roll out of the way of a kick that would have caved in his skull. Then there was a familiar high-pitched whine of energy, as a repulsor beam caught Hyde right between the shoulder blades.
There was a bright flash in the corner of Steve's vision as Jan used her stingers on someone, followed by another ear-splitting rattle of gunfire. Steve kicked the knife out of the man's hand and looked up to see Sam flick one of his hard-light wings out in front of Clint, bullets ricocheting off it in a cascade of red sparks.
"I'm disappointed," the Doombot said, in a perfect imitation of Doom's deep, cultured voice.  "You used to present more of a challenge than this."
Steve winced. The museum's two-star gourmet restaurant was undoubtedly very nice, but it didn't match the low-key afternoon together that he'd had planned. "It's ridiculously over-priced," he pointed out.
Whatever it was, the thing speaking to her in her dead aunt's voice was involved. Wanda tried again to run, to get as far away from this place as possible, but her body was paralyzed. How long had she been here, in this empty fairy tale cottage with no art on the walls? What had it done to her?
Tony had a point there.  There were times when Steve felt aggressively daring and defiant just for holding Tony’s hand or putting an arm around his waist in public, and other times when he found himself halfway through some blatantly intimate gesture before the question of how people would react and if he really should be doing this in front of an audience occurred to him.  Tonight, he felt like being defiant.
An accident. Of course it was an accident. Tony would never intentionally use his armor to murder someone. But then, once Steve would have said that Tony would never have used his armor against
Even  Logan, who had been lurking at a corner table when they'd arrived, a  bottle of beer in one hand and his cowboy boots on the table, had  refrained from actually lighting a cigar, settling for grinding an unlit  cigar stub between his teeth in a manner that reminded Steve of Nick  Fury.
"You what?" Sam stared at her. He been working with Steve for years, Tony reflected, but moments like this made it obvious that he hadn't been on the Avengers for very long. The sheer amount of property damage they often caused took some time get used to - there were New York City officials and members of SI's board who still weren't used to it.
"Take it from a successful lab experiment," Steve said, laying one hand on Tony's shoulder. "It doesn't look that bad."
Steve slammed a hand down on the edge of the table, the sturdy wood absorbing the impact with a dull thud. "If we let Loki get her hands on that spear, everything she does with it will be our fault." His voice had risen until it was halfway to a shout, his face flushing red.
"And there wasn't a legal way to fight it?" Steve asked, trying to sound as non-accusatory as possible. He managed to keep the anger he still felt out of his voice; the more they talked about this, the more visibly upset Tony got, and if Steve somehow pushed him over the edge, he might never get his explanation. He had to be careful, calm, or Tony would shut down, the way he had in the hotel. "A way that didn't involve taking it back by force?"
Only, she had never told him why, and dying and coming back, getting a second chance... it ought to mean something, right? He hadn't had much time to think about it before, with everything going to hell, and then seeing Cap on the news, alive once more, and then all the reunions in DC, but he had time now, and the more he thought about it, the less sense it made. Why had Wanda chosen to bring him back, and not Vision, or her kids, or anyone else? She'd brought Simon back because they were in love, and had had that link thing going on. Cap coming back had this feeling of rightness to it; he deserved it, and people needed him, and it wasn't as if Clint thought he didn't deserve his own second shot at life (because he certainly hadn't deserved to die), but he wasn't Captain America. He didn't have people who needed him.
"Loki despises us all utterly and is naturally aligned with Chaos," Thor rumbled. "There is nothing to stay her from deciding to help Chthon instead with the intent of turning upon
"The public will start to trust superhumans again," he said, as much to remind himself as anything else. "They already have. This is just a temporary setback."
Tony had been the one to turn off Happy's life support, when he had been slowly dying from a supervillain's beating. Pepper must have known; Tony wouldn't have done something like that without telling her first.
His helmet was still sitting on the workbench, watching him with empty eyes; old Shellhead had the same blank expression he always had, whether he was watching Tony drink himself into a stupor or grieve over Steve's death. Remote. Untouched. Unhelpful.
"Promise me you won't do anything to make this worse," Steve interrupted. It was supposed to be an order, but came out sounding like something entirely different.
Tony claimed to be able to remember parts of his life in the alternate universe Reed Richard's kid had created. Wanda could remember bits and pieces of Magneto's mutant-dominated alternate reality. Sam had had two sets of memories long before either of those.
Damnit, maybe he actually had gone crazy. It wouldn't be the first time one of them had snapped under pressure.
The first Doombot had appeared directly in Wanda's bedroom.  She had been awake, fortunately; she didn't sleep well these days, not since they'd brought the Dee manuscript into the mansion.
Her face went from sneering disdain to childish glee like a switch flipping. "Good," she said brightly. "I have plans for him. He killed my Brock. I'm going to make him beg me for death. Poison would be too easy." She hefted the Luger, her eyes traveling slowly over the Avengers, then narrowing. "That one." She waved the muzzle of the gun at Sam. "He was there when you and your little friend killed Daddy. I think I'll shoot him first."
"Let's move this inside, people," Steve said now, nodding at the mansion's back entrance. "The sooner we get all of this over with, the sooner you three can go home."
Steve jerked himself upright at the sound of Wanda’s voice, the world lurching around him for a moment.  No blood.  Not on his hands, or the floor, or the sheets.  And Doom was locked away securely in the Helicarrier’s cells, though unfortunately not for long.
"I don't know.  All the ones I could see vanished."  Sam grimaced.  "I should have checked just in case, but... she said she'd killed you."  He shook his head, slowly.  "I knew she was probably lying, but..."  He didn't finish, just smiled a little ruefully at Steve and gave a slightly embarrassed-looking shrug.
"I didn't know Mr. Hogan very well, but he always seemed like a real nice guy," Steve said awkwardly, "and I know Tony misses him a lot."
The rifle bullet she carried in her hip pocket was hard between her fingers, warm from her body heat. "That was for you, baby," she whispered. "You and Daddy. We're going to make them all pay."
"That would be from stepping in powdered glass while I helped rescue your ass from that restaurant. The jet boots must have slagged it." Rhodey bent down and picked up the bundle of purple feathers the cat had just spat out at his feet. "Here," he said. "Go chase something."
Leather was very practical for a superhero costume -- it looked good, and it offered more protection than spandex -- but it was also a bitch to get off when it was tacky with half-dried blood. Thank god his pants weren't as tight as Cap's, or getting them off would really have been not fun.
It was nearly full dark now, the sun having set some ten blocks ago, and she could feel the raw throbbing of a blister on her left heel. When she had come to a stop where Dr. Strange's house should be and seen a vacant building she had wanted to scream with frustration– she had nowhere else to go, and was so tired that part of her just wanted to curl up on the ground and go to sleep, except that that would have meant handing herself back over to Chthon – and the realization that it wasn't empty after all seemed to drain the rest of her energy from her.
The mask went flying, metal scraping across asphalt as it landed, and Steve had a brief impression of pale skin, livid scars, and an enraged snarl — Doom had a narrower jaw than he'd always imagined, and broader cheekbones — and then Doom was diving for his mask.
"Well, I hope it's still interesting even without the hors d'oeuvres and women in fancy dresses." Steve had been dragged to more than one of those fund raisers, before Tony had started drinking. Tony had always claimed that he needed someone with him who could talk about art, so that he wouldn't look like a clueless engineer who didn't know anything about culture, or that Captain America's presence at a particular benefit dinner would ensure a better turn out. There were always hors d'oeuvres, the tinier the better, and women dressed as if they were ready to attend the opera.
Tired, and probably nursing a headache. His eyes had been dark before he'd closed the laptop, the oily black of the Extremis spreading across the normal blue like cataracts; Tony was monitoring the surveillance equipment around St. Margaret's continually, keeping track of city police and emergency radio bands, and repeatedly hacking into SHIELD's communications, plus responding to all of his business email and cell phone calls on top of that.
"The museum is not going to be pleased that we couldn't recover the book," Jan said, forcing her mind back to business. "Their insurance ought to pay for it, I suppose, but it's not the kind of thing you can replace."
"Don't-" Steve shouted, uselessly, too late, as Sam folded to the ground with both hands pressed against the sides of his head and Redwing flew to Wanda and dropped the spear directly into her outstretched hands.
With a harsh scream, Redwing launched himself into the air and dropped the canister into Carol's waiting hands. She sprayed it, covering Steve, Sam, and the sole remaining artificial symbiote indiscriminately with a white chemical mist, and the symbiote shuddered and went limp, gradually transforming back into a middle-aged tourist in a garish sweatshirt.
The explosion of pain as Doom's fist caught him in the kidneys was like a flash of light behind his eyes, but then Clint was free, the cloak just a cloak again.
"All right, all right, we're leaving the lab of kitty chew toys now. I'll put you down as soon as you're someplace you can't electrocute yourself."
Wanda tightened her arms around Tony's neck and resisted the urge to look down.  She wouldn't be able to see anything yet, not with so many buildings in the way, and the three-hundred foot drop to the pavement below would only feel more yawningly lethal if she looked at it.
"Clint," he said, "are you looking for Steve?" He realized that he'd been unconsciously rubbing at his temples with his left hand, and halted the gesture immediately, letting his hands fall back to his lap. Apparently, he'd developed a reflexive habit, despite the fact that it didn't hurt anymore.
Doom threw back his head and laughed, the sound echoing off the high ceiling.  "If I weren't planning to kill you, I'd be tempted to offer you a job."  He sounded honestly amused at being threatened with disgusting and overly detailed death, maybe even a little impressed.  "Enjoy the next few hours, gentlemen.  They're all you have left."
Tony sighed, looking down at his feet and then back up. He was still standing in the doorway, neither inside nor outside the room, as if he weren't sure that Steve would welcome his presence, but couldn't quite bring himself to leave. "I stopped selling weapons for a reason, because I couldn't control who had them or how they were used, and damn it, Fury
Jan snatched it up off the side table before any of the others could. "Avengers Mansion," she started, then, "Yes, I know. He knows. Yes, we've all seen it, Peter." She held the phone out to Steve. "It's Spiderman."
He had come within inches of getting half the team killed with his ridiculous plan to have a robot attack them to that he could stop it and save the day - and thus prove that they should keep him on the team. So she had blamed him for letting himself fall apart that way, as well as for gambling with their team's lives and hitting her.
And he was just trying to distract himself from the awkwardness of a one-on-one conversation with Wanda.  Clint sighed inwardly, and made himself smile at her.  She was trying.  He could, too.
He threw a jab at Sam's torso, already knowing which direction he was going to turn in order to let the punch slip past him, and followed it up in quick left hook that connected solidly with Sam's jaw.
He hadn't, of course, beyond assuring Steve that 'Iron Man' still had his back. Once, he would have explained himself to Steve without hesitation, but Steve had the unhappy feeling that those days were over, possibly for good.
"I can think of more entertaining kinds of action," Tony said, writhing in a vain attempt to buck Steve off. Steve was only a couple of inches taller than he was, the difference in height almost negligible, but forty extra pounds of mass meant that when Steve truly wanted Tony to stay put somewhere, moving wasn't really a viable option.
- Tony, but no longer looked like him. Maybe because, when he was around this superficially female version of Tony, he found himself halfway expecting his long-standing interest in Tony's body to be returned.
"No," Steve said, to both of them. "I'm not sure. But I'll do it. Tell Jameson we'll give the interview together."
She hadn’t even been able to remember exactly what he took.  Not Wellbutrin, that wasn’t right – that had been the second one they’d tried, after the SSRIs and the first not-lithium mood stabilizer had just made things worse.
She narrowed her eyes at Wanda. "Tony feels guilty about what happened to you. He's clearly overcompensating. Thor wasn't here to see what you did. Steve forgives everyone, eventually." Even Tony, who had fought with him so bitterly. Even Sharon Carter, who had shot him – not intentionally, true, but a lot of men wouldn't have seen past the fact of the bullet. "But I don't understand Clint forgiving you. Not after what you did to him. I don't see how he can stand to be in the same room as you." That, even more then the rest of this, made no sense. In her experience, men were more likely to shrug off being taken sexual advantage of than women were; she'd known at least a half a dozen guys in the Air Force who'd had sex they didn't remember while drunk, and the greatest source of trauma – that they'd admitted to, anyway – seemed to be the women involved's lack of perceived attractiveness. But Clint had been visibly upset, when he'd told her about it, afraid he'd taken advantage of Wanda, blaming himself for not resisting, for not bringing her back with him. And yet he hadn't said a word against allowing her to come back.
