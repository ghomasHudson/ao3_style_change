When they left the diner, Jan’s heels clicked against the pavement. She waved over a valet, who gave her back her keys.
Something must have shown on Steve’s face, because Gail reached out and clasped his hands between hers. “Steve, don’t look like that. I’m so happy for you. There were men, plenty of them, who fought alongside you, and many of them never lived to a time where they could be themselves. I’m so glad that, even after everything that brought you here, you found happiness like this.”
“Really.” Tony raised an eyebrow. “Is there a reason you want to be out of here at night?” If Steve had noticed, too, that would go a long way in making Tony feel better.
“Like I said, the armor was unresponsive for about a minute.” His face was pale. “A little hiccup. But everything is in working order now.”
Well, Steve’s actual husband was in the hospital, so he couldn’t really bring himself to sympathize.
Steve had been happy lately in general, and why was it, when it was because of someone else, much less his
“What would make you think that?” Steve said, patting down his clothes and carefully stepping back. He had a poker face pasted on, but he was as red as red could be, and not many things got Captain America panting.
Steve thinks it’s all a load of crap, and he thinks he gets more of a say with his lived experience. The idea that he, out of countless others who’ve experienced unrequited love, is the one to suffer from the disease doesn’t surprise him anymore. His life is a series of improbabilities.
Bucky was cradling a sleeping child in his arms. From the looks of it, she couldn't have been older than ten.
“I think he used his energy source in—in his chest.” Even Thor had lost his speech pattern, as he flew in, picking the girl up in his arms.
he was taken aback. Steve could just imagine how the grin would spread across Tony's face behind the faceplate. “You're just as I remember you, Winghead.”
Even in the middle of this sterile room, with its bright lights and unnatural smells, their nest felt like it belonged to the coziest den. Home. He wiggled closer, the easier to bury his snout in the man's neck, panting softly, tongue darting out to catch on the rough bristles of the man's fur covering his chin. He curled his body, the easier to nestle next to his mate. That idea made his tail thump uncontrollably against the floor.
There was a splash on his stomach, and Tony blinked the climax out of his eyes, propping himself up on his elbows.
The shield isn't a blunt weapon. It crushes Tony's sternum, but slashes open his throat at the same time. His jugular gives a rough little cough, before a bright burst of blood floods out.
If Tony had chosen him, they couldn’t have had this. Steve watches Morgan clinging to Tony. Is there a world, where they could have brought new life like this? Reminding them not just of who they lost, but who they have left to protect? They couldn’t have. Tony’s always been meant to create, to work toward the future. Not to be saddled with someone from the past. This is how it’s meant to be, Steve wonders, while Tony gazes back at him. Only for him, Steve thinks, their eye contact not breaking. For the first time in five years, Steve has Tony’s undivided attention.
Anyway, because one of the first thing you learned as a superhero to keep sane was to stick to routine when the rest of the world was doing an impression of a house on fire, Carol woke up, worked out in the state-of-the-art gym, and headed for the kitchen.
“Really? You’re not talking to them before you leave?” Steve says. He’s surprised Tony is still here, to be honest, and not with his family.
Tony stilled, before sighing and ruffling Steve’s hair. “It’s morbid business, but if I don’t do it, then it’s all getting reinvested by Greg. I’m not letting him win, not even in death.”
Steve swallowed. They were ninety stories up, but he had the fullest confidence he could beat the elevator down if he took the stairs.
Sunlight glinted off the face of the photo frame. Steve angled it, and the light washed out the details of the smiling faces in the frame. He had the sudden urge to run his thumb along the edge, but he didn’t.
This was no time to joke. Steve tried to sit up, only for Tony to put his hands on his shoulders to keep him down.
“Does the super soldier serum make you hornier faster? Or were you always this impatient?” Tony laughed as he brought Steve in for another kiss. Steve mouthed at him, intentionally making it wetter than it needed to be.
“Steve...doesn't know.” Tony's mouth was dry. This Reed didn't need to know how he'd—how his other self had supported wiping Steve's memories. Had urged Tony on, because only Tony would hesitate between picking Steve Rogers and the rest of the world.
Rogers opened his mouth, then shut it. “Maybe you could call it a crush. Today proved I don’t know him as well as I’d like to. But no matter how young and stupid you think I might be, the truth of it is I could fall for him. And I know I want to. He's Iron Man. He's one of the best people I've ever known. The future is almost unbearable with him, I don't even want to imagine it without him.”
“Would you look at that? I guess it's not just for paintings after all.” Tony took a step back, straightening his shirt and smoothing out the creases. His lips tingled, oversensitive.
He wasn’t as sentimental to believe that his presence would hasten Tony’s recovery. But being next to Tony made something in him, flighty and panicked, settle. Steve had gotten through the fight with a few cuts and bruises that didn’t even warrant a field medic, but coming here was worth it just for the worry to subside.
future. That's good enough for me,” Rogers said with a nod. He closed his eyes after Tony gave him a thumbs up. There was a zap, and the spot he stood was empty.
Tony suspected that if he went into Steve's room, he'd find some of those old shirts he'd been missing.
“What the hell, Steve? I zip around in a flying suit of armor and you’re acting like I should be taking fewer risks? Why are you so invested in who I do or don’t sleep with? Was your pal Bucky never allowed to go to those whorehouses back in Europe?”
“And you shouldn’t tackle someone who isn’t a threat, no matter how annoying they are. You’re a supersoldier, Steve. You’re not a scrawny stick who can’t make it up a flight of stairs. Lay a finger on someone, and the assault charges can come flying.”
“What my husband is saying,” Sue said, tapping Reed's shoulder so that he retracted his head, “is that the Avengers didn't just spontaneously come out of nowhere.”
Credit where credit was due for the decorations, but whoever had done the mistletoe placement was getting moved back in the priority queue for gear upgrades. That fateful piece of mistletoe had been hung right near the entrance way, and Tony hadn't spotted any others hanging around.
They made it to the bedroom in record time, leaving behind the sounds of chatter and laughter. It was a shame about the military training, because after Tony let Steve go to work on freeing his own pants, he looked up and Steve was fully naked and tossing a shirt to the corner.
The thought of someone knowing their place and turning tail and running sounded like exactly what Steve needed. Steve got off the couch.
“It's a different universe.” Steve looked away, hair falling into his eyes, face shadowed. “She's not Ma. I'm not her son.”
The hologram cuts off, and it’s like part of Steve’s soul been cut off. He realizes, abruptly, what it is. The crushing pressure in his chest is gone, lifted off with Tony’s final message. His last reminder of Tony, his last gift, that Tony loves him back.
No response came. Maybe Tony really was hallucinating. He snorted at himself, before something shifted in the corner of the room.
Steve doesn’t look like he’s gone twelve rounds with Thanos and his army. He looks…good. He’s clean, his hair’s styled, he’s as perfect as ever. He’s wearing their time travel suit and is holding a briefcase instead of a shield. Tony’s wearing a t-shirt and comfortable pants, himself. He has some rules to learn about the afterlife, apparently.
“There aren't any areas which should contain the technology, resources, or energy allotment for such an endeavor.”
Despite himself, and the incessant worry over Bucky, Steve was overwhelmed by the old, focused rush of exhilaration. He held back a grin. It had been months since he'd last fought side-by-side with others, and that was back when he was his usual body. And the last time it had been with Tony, just the two of them, would that have been—Madripoor?
“I’ve talked to Bruce. There’s a lot going on right now, but he says that he’ll put me into contact with Helen Cho for a consultation within the next week. We need to have the surgery performed before the Stones can be returned.”
Carol was watching Steve, pursing her lips. She snapped her fingers. “Never have I ever kissed Tony Stark,” Carol declared proudly.
“That’s…oh.” Steve realized with a start that he hadn't smelled any alcohol on Tony’s breath, not even when he’d half-carried him here. It wasn't alcohol that'd made Tony sick this morning. Something in the pit of his gut curdled.
Steve stroked a thumb over the thin silicone band on Tony’s ring finger. The last time he’d seen Tony out of the armor was when he'd been unceremoniously ejected from the lab so Tony could put on the armor, and he hadn't been wearing it then. Steve hadn’t been wearing his, either.
He knew he shouldn’t stare at Tony at this. It unnerved the other man, having Steve observe him like a cat. Steve knew that, but he didn’t think he was capable of only looking at Tony from the corner of his eye. He demanded your attention like that. It was harmless, committing Tony’s image to memory, and it was stupidly, wonderfully sentimental to think about how simple movements could look so entrancing in someone else’s body.
With all of Tony’s attention trained on him, curiosity sparked, like he hadn’t just vomited up half his insides two minutes ago. Steve cleared his throat, heat creeping up the back of his neck. If Steve tried to play it off, would Tony call him out on his bullshit? Jan always had.
Steve looked at his ring, heart pounding, and slipped it onto his finger, before pulling his gloves on and rushing downstairs.
The faceplate is ripped off now, but there are noises in his ears, warnings of critical failure, and he doesn't know if it's referring to his armor, his body, or his heart. His brain goes dull, because there's nowhere for the oxygen to go, now that his blood is spilling out.
“A month?” A month of just him and Tony sounded…fantastic, really, but Tony didn’t appear particularly enamored with the thought.
“You—you really need to learn some respect,” Steve said, shifting uncomfortably, although it wasn't like Tony didn't
There was a slight banging, like someone tapping on glass, as Steve nudged the unlocked door open silently. There weren’t any signs of struggle. It was soon clear that the sound came from the bathroom, and the sound of retching followed. That door wasn’t closed, a slab of light cutting across the carpet floor, and Steve crept around to peer inside.
Now, when Steve thought about first waking up in the future, he didn’t focus on the pain, or the shock, or the disbelief. It’d been there, he remembered exactly how he’d reacted, but the only thing that he could remember, free of the haze of distance, was the flood of information. It had overloaded his mind, and even though he’d stored away the revelations of the Internet and equality movements alongside weapons that could level a city within seconds, it had all been cloaked in unreality. His life since that point was the same: his emotions trying to catch up with the truth of what he saw and puzzle out what it made of them.
“You ready?” Tony said to Rogers, his voice soft. “As far as the calculations tell us, it'll be painless.”
“Manhattan,” Tony said, slowly, feeling more and more vulnerable as the seconds passed. He resorted to more manual measures to confirm his suspicions. “But not ours.”
Steve didn't feel like he had much of it, and when he leaned back down and Tony parted his lips invitingly, Steve paused.
On time heist T-1, Tony declares a party. Someone’s put in charge of the food (Rocket) and now, several hours later, there are stacks of pizza boxes piled high on tables and copious amounts of empty 2-liter soda bottles littering the room.
“I wondered, if maybe you wouldn’t come back,” Bucky admits, the night Steve comes back from returning the stones. It’d been a few hours for everyone here, but a week on Steve’s end. “You’d get your dance, and then.” Bucky shrugs. “Do what you could until the end of your lifetime.”
Then she just had to do something that Carol Danvers excelled at. Whatever had begun the rift between them, all it meant that someone had to head it off before it got any worse. As long as there was a mission plan, Carol could go in anywhere ready to see it through.
“Steve!” Tony jolted up and slammed into the side of a dumpster. The armor let out a warning blare, before Tony sank back into the brick wall. His chest was heaving as he took stock of his surroundings.
“You don't—don't have a little voice in your head telling you how sexy you are and how fuckable you look?” Tony muttered.
They hold onto each other until there’s nothing left. Tony lowers his arms, blinking at the edge of the vast lake. He squints, because he swears that the water’s falling away. But no, that’s not it. Tony looks down at himself. The tips of his extremities are already translucent, and the rest of his body is quickly fading away.
They stared at each other for several long, aborted moments. Tony stepped toward Steve, closing the door.
“I've been thinking,” Steve said, as they both watched them. “And, well, after talking it over with Sue. It's because of you.”
Tony’s fallen asleep on the table. He’s small enough that his whole body fits, even though he’s flat on his back. Steve holds his breath when he crouches down. Tony’s glasses are skewed, digging into his cheek, bound to leave an indent. Steve pulls the glasses off, and debates on where to put them so that Tony doesn’t wake up in a panic to find them. He tucks an imaginary strand of hair behind Tony’s ear.
He didn’t know at what point he decided it was easier to pretend to be out of love, to let his feelings linger as a vague longing to be with him. That was how their friendship had always worked. Even just having Tony's friendship back was more than enough, after everything they'd been through.
Steve breathed in deeply. He pulled out his own phone, looking at the blank, dark screen and his reflection there. His face was beginning to get blotchy. The more visibly upset he got, the softer and quieter Jan's voice, her gestures, became. Only the humiliation of potentially crying in front of her kept his eyes fixed squarely on the screen.
Their lips met, and before Steve could surge up and shove his tongue down Tony's throat, Tony pulled back. Steve whined, lifting his head, before he gave up and slammed it back against the mat and closed his eyes.
Steve glanced at the clock, and the minute hand hadn't moved since the last time he checked. He huffed, jiggling his leg. He was lounging around the living room, which had increasingly become his evening leisure activity. Tony had a state of the art entertainment system, but Steve had rebuffed suggestions to watch his television in the theater, or watch shows in the privacy of his room. It had nothing to do with the clear line of sight of the elevator.
That won him a laugh from Steve. “Of course you'd notice. It's nothing important. I'm not getting much sleep.”
“You left something.” She holds out his handkerchief in her fist. Steve reaches inside his pocket, but it really was gone.
Steve leaves too, but he can’t escape the constant irritation. Cough suppressants don’t work on him, plus he nearly gags the first time he drinks the syrup. It doesn’t taste much better than it did a century ago. He grows his beard back. No one can line up the dots between the sickly, bearded man who flits along town to town and Captain America. It’s not like the name means much nowadays, other than being the subject of an increasing number of defaced statues.
“Forget the armor!” Steve snapped, and Tony clasped his hand over his chest, offended. Steve reached out and laid a hand on his shoulder, “are you hurt?”
If Steve had been scared once, then Tony had cured him of that. He shook his head, hoping Tony was watching.
“Hey,” Steve said stiffly, “Tony.” What followed could have topped junior prom in awkwardness. Steve and Tony's bodies were oriented towards each other, yet they'd mutually decided to not look at each other. Steve performed a ridiculous looking shimmy past where Tony in the doorway as he beat a hasty retreat, leaving full coffee mugs on the table and on the counter.
Steve squeezed Tony’s hand tighter. She was watching him, he knew, with his red eyes and unshaven face she had always complained about.
surprise her? Steve never had a handle on what Gail or Bucky thought about the Ultimates. They were quick to shush the grandchildren when they asked Steve about kicking the Hulk in the balls, or whether Thor really did shoot lightning from his hammer. He twisted his fingers around each other, strangely nervous, as he asked.
Tony would complain about the no fun later, because there were few things more fun than getting his hands on a naked Steve.
“I'm dying,” Tony said, finally. “That doesn’t mean I don’t love you.” His voice was resigned, and weary. “Maybe it would have been easier if I didn't.”
Steve breathed out. “You wanted them to think that we’re the ones who are married.” The words left a bitter taste on his tongue, and to think that the idea would have brought him so much joy not so long ago.
“Doors, closed!” he ordered. They slammed shut as Tony lunged for the repulsor on the table. It'd still shoot, and hopefully not take out his arm with it.
Or not—maybe if Tony hadn't been so cavalier on his own for so long as Iron Man, he wouldn't pull stunts like he did now.
Steve didn't reckon that would work in this case. People had described in detail about how his Cap look and his Cap voice worked (“patent it,” Johnny Storm had suggested), but from the markedly displeased, half-demanding looks Rogers aimed at him, Steve didn't feel anything other than bone-tired.
“All right. This time, I'll get you,” Tony grinned, and his next punch was intended for Steve's solar plexus. This time, he stumbled when Steve's body slipped his arm, and in the next instant he was on his back on the floor, blinking up at Steve.
“Did I do the right thing?” The instant Tony says it, he’s afraid. But Steve has to know the answer. He’s seen the aftermath. He has to tell Tony that…
“I got my second chance right here, Cap,” Tony says. His daughter clings to him, but Tony doesn’t look away from Steve. Addressing him. Knowing him.
A chuckle came from behind him. “There's always your bedroom, if you need a place to sleep.” Steve smiled at him indulgently, but going back to his bedroom meant leaving Steve here, and Tony was sure that it was Steve's presence that was making his eyes droop comfortably.
“Good. That's not letting you off of our discussion about you about jumping on mysterious objects of unknown origin.” Steve stepped back and looked around. “But first things first. Did that orb teleport us?”
“You're joking,” Steve finally said, and neither of them believed it. “Why...why would you tell me this?”
“Thank you,” he says awkwardly. He reaches out, but then Pepper turns her hand over, opening the cloth. Several bunched-up petals fall out, and they watch them together until they settle on the floor.
Tony spun around at a sound of a throat clearing. Sarah Rogers held up a hand. Tony was distinctly aware that this was the first time he'd seen her face-to-face without the armor in-between them.
He mostly certainly didn't imagine this, Tony in his apartment standing a few tantalizing inches away, looking at him like he could devour him. Steve couldn't stop looking at his lips, and it was odd he didn't feel more embarrassed at how much he
“Really. I've known the two of you for a long time. I know what happens when you two aren't...normal,” Carol said.
“Don’t be so difficult. Steve! Tony!” Jan leaned in. “When did this happen? Wait, doesn’t that mean Steve should have drank last round?”
People couldn't exactly walk into the lobby of Baxter Building and gain an audience with the Fantastic Four. Most people wouldn't bother, not with the building being a lightning rod for attacks, accidents, and every other sort of destruction.
I have to be better, I can be better than this, Tony tells himself, like a mantra. Like Steve. What would Steve do. Because whatever Steve's doing, it's working, the more supers defect to anti-Registration, the more dissent grows among the people, desperate for any end.
He meant it to comfort, but he heard the resentment in his own voice, and Gail hadn’t missed it. That they’d still been able to be together for so long. More than twice his own lifetime, with someone they loved. The thought of him and Tony being so lucky was a distant dream.
Steve shook his head harder. He shuddered, rubbing his arms like he was cold. “It's not about how I looked. You couldn't know, how I've been acting these past two weeks. If you did, then you'd—” he tugged at his hair. “You smelled so good,” he blurted, “and I couldn't stay away from you. I didn't
Right as they reached it, Tony stopped, spun Steve around, and pushed him back. Steve gasped as he almost slammed into the couch, surprised at Tony's show of strength.
“I figured that—we never really worked out the details of how the Ultimates were going to operate. After we broke with SHIELD.”
been a while since they've spent time here together. Steve had his own apartment, and he had missions for SHIELD that couldn't be disclosed to Tony. It was a long time from when Steve had come out of the ice and before he knew Iron Man's true identity, when they'd pass sleepless nights together talking in the mansion common areas or the library.
For once, Tony had helped bring together a team who all liked each other. No room reading where Tony had to mediate and disperse the energy and laughter. He could take a step back if he wanted to, or needed to.
Tony hummed, and Steve knew that he hadn’t fooled him. He’d never been a good liar, and that was why, though SHIELD had thrown around the idea at the beginning of Captain America being a covert ops masquerading with a secret identity, they’d swiftly shelved the idea.
Natasha picks off some of the olives on her slice and pops them in her mouth. “No thanks. Unlike certain people, I’m not interested in emotionally unavailable men.”
“I never said anything about that,” Steve said. “This is—it’s our home.” No, that was the wrong answer, and more words spilled out trying to correct his error. “Letting strangers in is...disruptive.”
“You can come out now,” he said. “I'm tired of not knowing what's in my own mansion. Or my own head.”
Steve crouched down again, peering over the edge. The Hydra agents on the ground didn't have the time or focus to aim at him, although there were some very wide shots sent overhead. He had his distraction to thank for that. And what a distraction it was. Rogers punched, kicked, and swung his shield his way out of any crowd that tried to surround him. He was still favoring his left shoulder, but Steve doubted anyone else would have been able to tell.  Tony provided aerial cover, weaving in and out effortlessly. Time traveling robot to Hydra, maybe, but brilliance in human form was more impressive to Steve.
Rogers, quickly picking up that any unspoken demands wouldn't be answered, leaned back, an odd sense of expectation between them. “Everything that's changed?”
“Right, back to their original times, to protect against forces of darkness, whatever that chick said.” Tony waves his hand around and breaks eye contact when he starts pacing. “I remember. But how’d that get you to end up here?”
Tony sat down in front of Steve, thoughtful. “Okay, okay. Is this a boundaries thing? Was it that I didn’t ask beforehand? I figured the place is big enough and my room is sound-proofed enough that I don’t have to phone you when I bring someone back, like back at the dear old academy.”
“It's not the past, not here. And I'm sure the FF of this world's great, but wouldn't you rather spend your last few hours here with her? Didn't she say to go back to her, before you left? The Captain America I know doesn't break a promise like that.”
Those threats, of Sentinels to keep the superheroes in line, anything to assuage politicians' need to serve their people, they're all laughable. The American people are no longer angry at superheroes.
His eyes fixate on the road ahead. Natasha doesn’t press, but her disappointment at him dodging the question hangs over them like a veil.
Natasha had kissed him on the cheek, almost at the corner of his eye, and when they'd parted and he'd clapped his hand over his face, she'd smiled and said something about laugh lines before leaving him.
“That's it?” Steve frowned. “But there are plenty of superheroes that aren't mutants, or Richardses.”
Tony raised an eyebrow, like he knew exactly when saying nothing made for the best effect. The feeling of shame was creeping back up Steve's neck, and Steve didn’t understand why he cared so much about something so small. It wasn’t like he’d exactly been clamoring for Tony’s attention or company before now.
“Cap!” There’s a thumping on his back. Steve’s eyes fill with tears as he coughs, again and again, body desperate to expel the foreign substance.
There’s so many words to say, but Steve only has to speak enough not to call his bluff. But, he thinks, it’s enough to say what he wants.
Tony’s breathing hard, and the hand holding the daffodil is shaking. “It’s okay. Steve. That’s the whole point of this whole damned thing. We’ll get them back to you, Steve. I promise. And if they don’t love you back, then I’ll repulsor them myself, you hear me? But first things first.”
“You were at the best parties growing up, weren't you?” Tony leaned his hip against the desk, and threw Steve a smirk. “I mean, if you already have plans with any cute former SHIELD agents, it's fine. No need to feel obligated, just because the rest of us have no strings attached.”
“Wasn’t taking any more chances, not after going for three weeks without food. Who knows where we could have been stranded during our time heist.”
Steve has nine lives to Tony's one, and the ice took one. Then Tony's team catches up in Seattle and Tony throws Steve into the Needle. Extremis tells him he's broken half the man's ribs and his pelvis. The man escapes anyway, but now he's down to seven.
The words grated like sandpaper against Steve’s temper, and he nearly barked his next words. “You're his co-leader. Who else would have it?”
Natasha doesn’t respond, and Steve doesn’t know how she feels about him not telling her. But he knows how she feels about herself.
Wanda took one, and really, that was incredibly inappropriate, what with Vision in the same room. Although Steve couldn’t say he understood what was going on with her, Vision, and Simon right now. Unlike other teammates, he didn’t obsess himself with the details of everyone’s love lives.
“That’s what the whole cabin in the woods thing’s for, Cap.” Tony waves a hand. “Or maybe it was, once. When I held Morgan for the first time, I almost forgot how badly I wanted children, and this was a choice Pepper and I had made together. It didn’t feel like it’s something for me, or us, anymore. It’s for her. Even now, the only thing keeping me going through this is thinking about all the kids who didn’t get what she has.”
Halfway down the next street, there was a thud behind him, and Steve ducked, slamming his Avengers alert at the same instant. Something sailed over his head, but that didn't matter as much as the man in front of him, catching the—
A decade ago, Tony would have found that unsettling. Now, he tries to tell himself that really, it’s sort of peaceful.
“Don't think too hard on it, darling, or you might miss your chance. It's a limited time offer, you know,” Tony said, tapping on the side of his head.
He'd almost up and forgotten it himself, but then again, he didn't like to dwell on the old crush. That was all it had come to in the end: infatuation. Even now, thinking of how much he had craved Iron Man's attention, and how any time spent together, especially alone, had been snuck away, bright spots of the day to be combed over and over until the memories had become worn with the familiar warmth of comfort. A crush, and one Steve had handled well enough externally, but the idea that he had let his feelings for his teammate become one of the axes his early life in the future had revolved around made his neck flush.
Steve shrugged. A small part of him had always known that there was no way he and Jan could have ended up the way he wanted to. They were too different, even if he agreed with all Tony said. Love really wasn’t enough, or maybe it was that Jan hadn’t loved him enough, not when her heart belonged to Hank. Steve would never understand; the times he'd argued with Jan had been painful enough to deal with, although he would have weathered them for her. Hitting her, though, was so entirely foreign, and only what a weak, pitiful, cowardly person would stoop to.
Natasha keeps Scott outside, talking about their next step of the plan, when Steve scrambles for the bag in the passenger seat, coughing up petals like he hasn’t in years.
“So if we're about ten years out,” Rogers ventured, “then does that mean the others are still around?”
, he thinks, as Steve stares uncomprehendingly at him, as his chest cavity caves further inwards. He's capable of this much, of making Steve Rogers hate him like scorched earth, that consumes every ideal that created him.
Tony shied away from his gaze. “Of course not! What, you think I run on radar? My defenses should hold up against anything in any modern army's arsenal since we started sticking arrowheads onto sticks. I don't know if it's something Hydra has that F.R.I.D.A.Y. wouldn't have, which I would be
been through a lot. I just wanted to assure you that, no matter what, that I'll always consider you one of my closest friends.”
“Of course I don't!” Steve admitted. “I never did. But that doesn’t just mean I can get things however I like them.” It wasn’t like he could tell Tony, admit to Tony and ask him for something just for the simple factor of
“Mind control works when you can get them all on the same page,” Sam replied. “Like a hivemind. Not knowing what year it is would be counter-productive. I'm thinking it's something else, and this something else went badly.” His voice trailed off.
Steve had been trying. Tony had tried, many years ago, to put the team together on their own. But now that they’re both here, together, Steve has no hesitation in his mind that this time, it’ll work.
For a minuscule, non-statistically relevant portion of the population, unrequited romantic feelings induce a stress response from the body. In the chest cavity, a seed is formed, and that seed germinates into a flowering plant. The symptoms begin from discomfort and shortness of breath, and as the flower grows, they turn into a worsening cough, chest pain, and at the terminal stages, suffocation.
The sound of repulsors made Steve turn his head. He was still getting used to Tony's new armor. Tony was back to the familiar red and gold, but it was sleeker, shinier, newer. It seemed the older they grew, the faster Tony went. Meanwhile, Steve's fallback old man jokes had grown steadily blacker.
” Jan said, her face a healthy pink. She always drank, to the point that if she didn’t have to, she took offense.
Like a felled giant, the monster toppled over, eyes still open, tongue lolling out. The now-darkened orb rolled out of its socket onto the street.
“RT?” Rogers asked, but there was no response. The all too familiar dread was already settling over Steve, and he saw it reflected in Rogers's eyes.
God, Tony didn't deserve this. Not when he was a traitor. Not when the only reason Steve could stand to look at him was because Tony had wiped his mind. He felt sick, suddenly, ready to throw up.
Tony didn't want to admit it, but he felt ready to go off any time now. From the bulge in Steve's tight,
He couldn’t quite make out Tony’s eyes in this light, shadowed by the setting sun behind him. He tried to look for something in the long moments that passed.
Oh thank god, so this isn’t the real afterlife. Tony allows himself a small smile. Wherever he goes next, he’s going to have a lot of exploring to do. He looks forward to it.
Steve had worked that part out long ago, but he wasn’t interested in keeping up any persona but his own. Better yet, he wanted to be left alone.
“I have a sanitary bag in the car,” she tells him. “Or there’s a whole forest around here, if you need a moment.”
“You say that now, but you’ll be a sight to behold when you squander all your life’s savings and inheritance and end up in the poor-house.” Tony tapped at his screen. “What charities do you like?”
Steve never panicked, but Tony's words nearly did it. Tony had painted a bullseye on his back, and some Hydra agents aimed upwards. Metal pieces flew out in all directions before a loud blast rattled the street, hurtling a loud shock through the air. It was a invisible explosion except how it rippled through the Iron Man armor.
There was a diner, small and with a smoking section, across the street from the hospital. Jan bit back a retort, when she asked him to pick any place he liked, and he pointed there.
“Tony.” Steve’s voice hitches. Tony’s looked into those eyes and believed him with his whole soul. Tony’s looked into those eyes and called him a liar. Tony doesn’t know what he can find here, now.
“What brings you here?” he asked, and thankfully Tony's eyes snapped back up to his face, fixated, but he didn't answer.
“Not the expensive stuff, either. It's the ratty t-shirts and undershirts, or sweatpants that I've had for years. But there's a reason I keep those around! They're more comfortable to work in.”
“Should you be out on the field?” Steve asked Tony, heading him off at the entrance to his lab. The Ultimates alert had been pulled. It was the first time they'd seen each other eye-to-eye in the past two days.
Steve gasps as his world comes into focus. The compound, there’d been an explosion, and oh god where’s the gauntlet—
“Fuck off,” Tony said, as Stark employees began to stream into the room, ready to help him into the armor, like he knew he could cut off any conversation with other people in the room. Steve steeled his jaw, turning away and adjusting his own helmet as he prepared for battle.
“There are many of them who work alone, true. Spider-Man, and Daredevil, although the media isn't so kind with them.” Sarah seemed taken aback at Steve and Tony's bewilderment.
Steve tried to think of the Tony Stark from back then. What he knew of him: the distant Avengers benefactor, always kind to Steve, but rarely seen despite owning the mansion he resided in.
When Tony sank its hand into Steve's fur, he pushed its head up, seeking the contact. His tail swished back and forth cautiously, but by the time Tony had brought both hands to scratch behind Steve's ears, it had become a little rotor of wolf tail.
Tony moaned, and Steve's fingers slipped under his shirt, a shock against his bare skin. Steve made him
“Well, I’m glad we’re both finally back in one piece, in one place. God knows we both need some semblance of stability if we’re going to keep kicking alien ass.”
Luckily, Steve was still wearing his regular clothes, but his shield was long out of sight. There were no other obvious ways out, but Tony still had one of his repulsor gauntlets. It was only a matter of time if they were working together.
“I think that we're spending enough time ironing out the differences between our universes,” Tony finally cut into Reed's excitement, which was a hard thing to do. Not that he found it difficult to understand, but it was a rabbit hole they, or their Earth, didn't have the time for. “Can you help us get home?”
After even she grew tired of talking, she pushed his water at him. Steve picked it up and drank it in one gulp. It was the most delicious water he’d ever tasted. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d had anything to drink. Maybe when a nurse had offered him some in a paper cup. Jan pushed her water toward him afterward.
It was still a lot of skin, Steve thought, averting his eyes. It wasn't like he hadn't seen more in the gym locker room, so it really shouldn't bother him. Maybe he should put in a word for the campus dress code, but he supposed he didn't have room to talk. He still wore his Capwolf costume around when he felt like it, and it was a long time from Halloween.
Tony deposited Steve neatly on the roof. Steve dropped down as Tony whirled around, the sound of bullets ricocheting off the armor.
Steve suspected he said it to scare him off, and it might have worked, once. Now, seeing how far Tony would go to keep up appearances, it just exhausted him.
In this world, the Infinity Gems didn't exist, and even if Reed didn't believe in absolutes, it was the world safe from incursions.
“Because, I figure the last thing you actually want the paparazzi to swarm is what’s going on with Tony. They’re like buzzards. They'll pick at anything. It can easily come to them catching onto your special relationship and haranguing Stark Industries about it. You know the instant Tony wakes up and hears there’s a scandal going on with his company, he’ll be out of that bed, and even Captain America couldn’t stop him then.”
Steve startled a bit. The TV had been on as background noise, and was now cycling through to an action movie, with a tall blonde in an abandoned warehouse loading her gun.
Steve was shaking his head. “I wasn't thinking about things like that,” he insisted. “I didn't care about something like that. I just thought that...if you saw me, you'd be afraid of me.”
They’re sharing a single peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and Steve gets up to go to the kitchen to see if there’s any sort of protein.
Tony froze, but she didn't miss the flicker of shock over his face. “Everything between us is perfectly normal,” he said, slowly, like he was tasting the feel of the lie coming out of his mouth.
“Well,” Tony says. “You go figure it out. You have the Infinity Stones, don’t you? Lots of ways to find out.”
Carol, who always put in a terrible show at poker and most board games except Yahtzee, tapped her glass of cider on the table with a wicked grin on her face. “Alright, cut it out with the crying. I think it’s time to make things more interesting.”
“I'm old, not senile,” and before anyone could argue that point, “anyway, I'm calling the alert off. I'm fi –safe.” That won him a sharp look from Rogers, but it's not like Steve wasn't telling the truth there. “Fill me in,” Steve added,
Steve's heart skipped a beat when he saw Tony's face. “Tony!” Steve felt around his neck, the other man broken out into a cold sweat. But at least he was breathing.
When his doorbell rang in the late evening and Steve peered through the peephole, he found the last person he'd expect to see on his doorstep.
There was no other explanation he could find. This was one of those—what Luke and Peter referred to as a—
Steve bites his lip. His face is turning red. Someone else might call him an ugly crier, but Tony just brushes his fingers across Steve’s cheek again. “I don’t know. I’m not sure what’s left for me anymore.”
“You said it already, no one's leaving before midnight. Everyone's split off into their own little groups, no one'll notice. Or we can wait a few hours.”
“Oh my god, Steve,” Tony said. Steve could feel Tony trembling from the effort of keeping his own giggles in. Steve doubled over, and every time he thought he had it contained, Tony would make another funny noise and send him off into another cycle. They both leaned toward each other, close enough that Steve could feel the breath of Tony’s laughter on his skin.
The edges of Tony's lips quirked up before he drifted out of consciousness, and Steve couldn’t resist the urge to run the back of his fingers across his cheeks.
“I don't understand this universe. Even if it has to do with time bullshit, you've never had encounters with the multiverse, nor have you even noticed any strange readings. And they're not easy readings to ignore.”
It’d been a few weeks since the incident in South Dakota. Tony admitted to it to Steve from his hospital bed, expression paling even further with the words, that he’d given Steve CPR. Steve had thanked Tony for saving his life, but it didn’t erase the uncertainty and trepidation in Tony’s eyes.
“Well, congratulations. I didn’t think it’d be possible, for you to be with someone who eclipsed even your popularity.”
She asks like she assumes Steve doesn’t want to see Tony. Well, it’s not like Steve has done anything to discourage that belief. He’s spent the last five years hiding from Tony. Steve’s never heard of a case of hanahaki disease disappearing because the afflicted fell out of love. Maybe he was the first to try. He doubts he’s the first to fail.
Jan took a drink, shrugging her shoulders. Right, they’d dated for a bit a few years back, but luckily, they’d both gotten a hold of themselves and broken up.
Lie as he liked, from the beginning, Tony's armor had only protected his own heart. If they couldn't look out for their own, what duty did they have to the American people, now?
“So, is Captain America homeless, now?” Tony studied Steve’s face. “She didn’t throw your things out into the street, did she? She can be petty, but I would have pegged her as too proud for histrionics. It’d explain why you look like what the cat threw up, though.”
To have Tony at his side, but to be by Tony’s side, as well. To be there, to help Tony take things head on. That was what he was good for, after all, the first line of offense, the leader of the charge. Together, they could face anything.
But that’s nothing, right? It’s not about him. When he snapped his fingers, all he wanted was to leave her that most precious of gifts: a chance. He hopes it’s worthy of her. That’s what he meant, when he promised whatever it takes.
He hefted his light bag on his shoulder. If Tony hadn’t noticed him, then his butler would be by soon. It took him a minute to remember Jarvis was one of last week’s casualties. He winced and tried to come up with a memory of the man other than him dryly remarking on Tony’s indecorous mannerisms, plethora of vices, and poor taste.
“Tony? Tony!” Steve reached out to shake him, but thought better of it. “Avengers!” he barked into his comm, to no response. His hands curled into fists. “We need to get him out.”
The other Steve Rogers – scale-mail and head wings but loudest of all the blazing, wholesome determination, narrowed his eyes. “Is Hydra that desperate now, recruiting geriatrics?”
Steve closed his eyes. “I’m sorry.” It was silly to say that he’d forgotten, but whenever Steve saw him, Bucky was so full of life, you’d never even think he was sick. A part of him knew, it must have been a show, that Steve was company and company meant liveliness. He thought of Tony, on the mornings where he was so tired, he’d roll over and pin Steve down using a limp arm. That and his disgruntled grunt when Steve tried to move was enough strength to keep Steve still.
The Steve here was in his current uniform, with the Avengers “A” and everything. Still the same slogan, though, and maybe “I want
Her eyes were fixed on Steve's, and that was it, wasn't it? That look of conviction, whether it was against dictators or supervillains or strange armored men, was unmistakable.
Steve held onto her hand, and she looked like his whole world. Tony should have known that Steve was a clingy mama's boy, and a lump formed in his throat at the scene. Suddenly, Tony missed his own mother more than he had in years.
Gail didn’t say anything. Her face barely registered a change in expression, and Steve was glad that he didn’t have to explain to her the sudden interest in men. He didn’t know if Bucky would have been so blasé about the affair, and he was incredibly grateful that he wasn’t in the room.
Steve swallows thickly, and his throat tightens like he’d forgotten he’d need to carry out a conversation with Tony. “Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?”
When Tony's fingers touched the wall, the window to the other side was gone. The room was deathly silent on this side.
He tried to twist his body as he fell, but one leg, then the other, were pinned, and his elbows and therefore his arms followed in short order.
“A lot of things have happened. You wouldn't understand. Tony is...it's not just the Avengers you've known for a decade. We're not always on the same team. We're not on the same team right now.”
The good, the warmth, the rightness of the world situated in the exact set of variables of who and why he loves, revealing his self to himself. The clarity makes it worth it.
“That’s im—” impossible, Steve wanted to finish, before shutting his mouth. But it was, the wrongness of it, of Rogers thinking that whatever he had with Tony was somehow
Not that he would need the shield here—his opponent couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. The agent doubled over Steve's fist and crumbled unceremoniously to the street, next to a campaign sign for Pleasant Hill mayoral candidate.
“Still, with just the two of you?” Sarah sat down on the couch. Steve took a seat next to her, and she patted him on the knee as he scooted closer to her. Tony remained standing in the corner of the room.
Even Hank seemed sufficiently deflated, and he didn’t care about romance other than what Jan made him care about. Steve’s cheeks grew even hotter.
“I can save the congratulations for him, too,” Clint finally said. “I don’t know what was going on in your head, but for once, and I don’t know how the hell he did it, Tony made a good choice.”
“Avengers!” Steve called into the comms. There wasn't even static, anymore. How bad had the time anomalies gotten? They hadn't heard a word, and, shit, what were they thinking,
While everyone got ready, Steve racked his brain. He’d long been banned from using anything anachronistic. He had to come up with something good. Just because he didn’t approve of the game didn’t mean he could lose.
He sneaked a glance at Tony, who was swirling his apple cider around in his glass, having an internal argument whether anything he did counted as kissing himself.
better than I do,” Tony said airily, when he remembered details from years’ worth of outings with Steve with no issue. Steve twisted his fingers around each other, his skin hot and clammy, and he fancied himself sickly for a moment. Anything to get out of this.
He couldn’t handle this after all, he thought in a distant panic. It'd been a long time since he'd wished to be put back into the ice, but the idea of never getting the chance to yell at Tony for scaring him so much was enough.
“After Brucie?” Tony scoffed. “We’ll be lucky if they don’t have our heads on a pike for letting another one of our team free.”
Tony let out an affected sigh. He let go of Steve’s shoulders and eased him into a sitting position before framing his hands around Steve’s face. “I don’t know. You’re going to have a lifetime of opportunities to prove me wrong.”
And Steve, damn him, sitting on the other end of the table for dinner, and on a different sofa during the gift exchange, and being such a good team leader that he was making small talk with everyone else on the team. Even before the kiss, Tony might have felt slighted that Steve was treating him like any other member of the team, but now it was even worse.
Tony’s words break through the haze, and Steve can focus again, like a switch has been flipped as Tony zeroes in on Plan B. Steve can imagine the gears working with each shift of Tony’s expression, far too fast for Steve to do anything but watch.
Steve didn't answer, and part of Tony wondered, hoped if Steve felt what he did. That it was the other's presence that made this easy, and kept the shadows away at night.
“I saw the poster you have of me back at the Tower, I figured you could use an upgrade,” Steve said, and was that a smirk? It wasn't like Tony was doing anything untowards about it. Steve should have seen the newspaper clippings Tony kept of Bruce Banner, or the photos of the Chitaru aftermath on New York, because try as hard as he liked, he was still a sentimental SOB.
“That two alpha males in one place thing really isn’t working out, is it? What a shame. It was the same issue with Greg and me as kids. So, it wasn’t the sociopathy that drove us apart, after all.”
After they'd finished their stretches and checked the wraps on their hands, Steve stood in front of Tony, crossing his arms. “We're going to go through all the basics, but now that I know more of what you're capable of and how often you're actually fighting, I'm not going easy on you like last time.”
There was a lump in Tony's throat, and Steve was looking at him like—like something he'd only seen in dreams, with wonder and disbelief. Like he couldn't believe of what Tony was capable of, just like Tony felt for him.
“Well,” Tony said, eyes going from Steve’s face to his hands, where his fingers were twisting around each other. Steve placed them flat on his knees.
Steve was struggling to speak—Tony watched his Adam's apple bob a few times before he finally spoke.
“This world doesn't have an Avengers team?” Tony asked again. “What do you do when you face world-wide threats?”
He bolted upright. Steve. The room was empty. It figured that Steve would leave after he'd seen that Tony had fallen asleep. Was it Steve, who'd covered Tony with blankets? But that was ridiculous, Steve would have woken him up, or, failing that, would have carried him to the couch.
Steve’s eyes stung when he huffed. “I’m stubborn, and old-fashioned,” Steve quoted back at her. “It’s my way or the highway, and nothing gets through my head if I don’t want it to.”
“Well, it's not quite that simple.” Tony came on over to pull Rogers into a hug. When they’d parted, Tony grinned. “Just the act of coming into the future has irrevocably changed the past, creating a diverging timeline that could be radically different from ours.”
There’s a slight shuffle, and Morgan Stark pops out, making her way over to her mother. Morgan’s eyes are wide when she reaches Pepper, holding onto her hand.
He soon discovered he wasn't long enough to drape the furs over the man. He paced back and forth, a whine threatening to escape his throat. Finally, he arranged the furs in a pile the best he could before rising up, holding his paws steady on the edge of the counter. He gently tugged at the back of the man's neck to ease him off his stool, settling him atop the furs and tucking them carefully in around him.
He didn't even try to deny what he'd been doing, too scared of the possibility of angering Captain America more than he wanted that fat paycheck.
The funeral’s over, but Steve can’t stop looking over the lake, long after the arc reactor was out of sight. The sunset casts long rays over the water, glittering and orange. Steve’s always been a city boy, but it’s so beautiful, he thinks he understands Tony a little better now. He leans on the railing of the deck in some effort to get closer.
Natasha elbows him in the side, and Steve grins. There’s been no shortage of speculation from within SHIELD or the Avengers, but he and Natasha have never been like that. He wouldn’t give up what he has with her for anything.
Steve didn't nod. You couldn't make promises like that, not in their business. Sarah had sensed it too, and she let her fingers trail down Steve's face before stepping back.
“He closed the rift,” Steve concluded. “Except he needed a power source, and—” Steve's hands were trembling. “He used the easiest option.”
They'd been friends, yes. He'd been led around by Mr. Stark at the beginning, introduced to his new world, the future and fame and luxury. He'd trained Mr. Stark in hand-to-hand combat.
“There’s no need to apologize, Steve,” she says gently. “In fact, if there’s anyone who should be sorry, it would be me.”
“Believe me, I am, and I think it’s bullshit. It’s just sex,” Tony told him, and smiled at Steve’s expression. “Am I offending your delicate sensibilities? Would have thought that someone who lived during a war would be the last one to judge me. Then again, you weren't a typical soldier, were you?”
“I'll be right there,” Tony confirmed. “Stay there, Steve, and don't stare down our friendly too much.”
There was a stunned silence. Tony's fingers had stopped moving on the back of Steve's neck. It was an ugly, twisted mistake that had crawled its way up Steve's throat.
Steve kicked up, catching the vampire in the gut. It let out an unholy scream as it was thrown back against the TV, cutting off Ricky Ricardo mid-line as the screen toppled over.
“I'm fine. Just shut down for a minute.” The faceplate slid back, revealing Tony’s face. As flippant as Tony sounded, it was clear his words didn’t match his expression.
“It’s not a failure to think of your family right now, Tony. That empathy of yours and the drive to do better with it is why you’re here. Love…love makes us stronger. Us as people, and us as a team.” Steve swallows past the blossoming pain, but his heart beats strong and steady. “We trust you, Tony.”
“A few days, huh?” Pepper asks. The wonder in her voice, and there must be a part of her wondering what it’s like, to be able to extricate the feelings that smother everything. For the yawning expanse of grief to end. Steve senses that she’s a practical enough woman to see the benefits of it. She blinks quickly, wiping at a corner of her eye while smiling a private smile with herself.
“Really now,” Tony said finally, and his thumb rubbed against the rim of Steve’s ear, his other hand on Steve’s chest. “You're so clingy today. Are you sure you can’t get drunk?”
“Well, yeah, but you’re loyal. To a fault, some would say. And Tony, who’s the most charming, people-pleasing, loneliest man I can think of, could appreciate that.”
Steve followed his gaze, looking down at himself and biting back the wry smile that threatened to break out. “You know exactly who Hydra considers worthy of their brave new world. You really think I'm with them?”
Steve’s eyes light up at that, and he tries and fail to hide his smile, wow, is that a rush to see, like staring at the goddamned sun.
“So, a bridge to the multiverse won't work. What we need is a time machine,” Tony said, crossing his arms.
Then the impossible happened. Rogers was aiming the stunner in the downed Hydra's directions, and the next he doubled over, clutching his shoulder. It was the same shoulder Steve had shot earlier, except this time he'd been hit with an actual bullet.
“Don’t think about what-ifs, dear. Those hurt too much, and Lord knows you’ve dealt with enough hurt already.” She sighed. “With Bucky, I’ve prepared for it for a long time. I know it’s coming. But that doesn’t mean that whatever happens now won’t have me being true to myself.”
Steve pulled back his cowl. Even more people were staring now, some in appreciation and some in wariness of the superhero unmasking himself. Tony didn't blame any of them.
“Your call,” Tony says, offering him another out, as he raises his time GPS, eyes fixed on Steve. He’s giving him an out, but Steve doesn’t want those anymore, not when it comes to them.
Jan sighed, running a hand through her hair. Exasperation was far preferable to pity. “You really can’t stay here in forever.” She frowned, and Steve stared back. She broke eye contact first. “It’d drive Tony nuts to know you’re doing this.”
But the wolf's demeanor didn't live up to its majesty. Its head was low, ears flattened back as it staring up at Tony. It moved in an awkward shuffle, tail wrapped firmly between its legs. By the time its body was fully exposed to the light, it stopped. It was trembling.
“In Never Have I Ever. About kissing you. I drank, but it wasn’t true, not even on a technicality. Being kissed
Tony's not sure when it changed. Because once, he fought for the American people, as their voice. He was backed by politicians, activists, mothers and families, their voicemails of support overflowing his mailbox. Superheroes need accountability. A death of an innocent child can no longer be excused, justified by the need
“This is impossible,” Tony said. This universe was impossible. So many of his personal readings didn't work, which made sense, but what Reed showed him of this Earth didn't add up. None of Reed's research into the multiverse made any sense.
He hadn't been lying, but the thought of following through with his feelings when he didn't know how Tony would react felt overwhelming.
It wasn't nearly the same grapple that Steve had used on Tony. He'd relied on his superior physical strength to help pin Tony down, but who needed brawn when you were a supergenius? One of Steve's legs was down on the mat, and the other had been forced over Tony's shoulder. Tony leaned his other shoulder against Steve's arm. He grinned, and sweat ran down his face.
“Including me,” Tony said. “So really, if I'd been sleeping like the rest of the pack, it would have been fine.”
“Speaking of which,” Tony continued, “how are you faring? I remember how you felt back then, which is...now, for you. This isn't too much, too fast?”
Obviously it had, but Tony's readings gave him pause. He would have thought hat the orb had fried his systems, somehow, but his sensors still worked. But the uplink to any Stark satellites were down, endless pings disappearing into the ether. Even his not entirely legal backdoors into SHIELD systems weren't giving him any responses.
“Yes.” Steve takes a deep breath. “Yes, you did the right thing.” He’s blinking fast, and his eyes are shining. Tony’s on the cusp of something, a problem he couldn’t solve for years. He thought he’d given up on understanding, but his heart races with the possibility.
Steve followed the movement of his hands, his forehead pressing against Tony's side, and Tony's stomach dropped. Then Steve lifted his head, and fitted his lips over Tony's cock.
Steve brought his feet up to the couch, wrapping his arms around his knees and burying his face there. He was trembling, and he knew if he unwound from this spot, then that was it. The dam would collapse, and he couldn't show that. If Tony showed him kindness now, he wouldn't last.
Even though there was an entire moon's worth of Worldkillers whose blood would be on his shoulders, even though there was a reminder in his palm of exactly how the fate of their Earth rested on his shoulders, it didn't matter.
“Oh, believe me, they didn’t need my help. I’ve had over a dozen requests for interviews, and even more in congratulations. A lot of friends and family are pissed at me now, turning away all the flowers and gifts in the past twenty-four hours.”
Tony had teased him about it. If he'd had a different temperament, Tony told him, he would have made an excellent agent, tasked with the most clandestine of ops—a supersoldier whose existence was known by half a dozen people, and whose face was known to none. That was how they created loyalty, Tony said, by taking away everything from someone but the cause, and wasn’t that Steve in a nutshell?
His heart’s been so awash in a gaping expanse of emptiness for so long that even here, where he’s allowed, he can’t shed tears.
Tony whistled low. “A pity. You two made for a gorgeous couple. Your children would have been beautiful.” His eyes were bright where he looked up at Steve. “Want to drink your sorrows away?”
When Tony had said that the first time, back in that bar, it had filled Steve with a sense of awe. The feeling was so much that it even made Steve’s throat choked up. This time around, hearing it, Steve felt uplifted. A swoop in his stomach, like when he flew with Iron Man.
It did. Even here. If Bucky hadn't been at this place, at this time, then an entire town would have been kidnapped. Steve imagined a five-year old dropped in the middle of a Hydra base and fought an involuntary shudder. If Bucky hadn't been the Winter Soldier with all the experiences that had given him, would he have been able to prevent that? Steve averted his eyes.
“Me too.” Steve can’t believe it. Tony’s forgiveness is here, flippantly given, but Steve basks in it.
In this world, Sarah Rogers was still alive, and even though both her and Steve would bristle at the thought, she was alone. In this world, the Avengers were just a fancy in someone's eye, but without someone with the drive to begin and lead them.
Steve lets out a low, agonized sob. He reaches out, tugging at Tony’s hands until they’re chest-to-chest. There’s a second to pause, ask for permission, but that moment passes when Tony puts his palms against Steve’s cheeks.
But that was different from Iron Man. Iron Man was...he'd confessed things to Iron Man, lulled into a sense of security and impulsiveness by sleepless nights and bad dreams. Fears, insecurities, regrets more insidious than the ice. In return, Iron Man had told him about himself, why he was fighting, what he had to make up for, the tales offered with hesitation, like he was afraid it would lessen Steve's opinion of him. It never did. Steve fought alongside Iron Man from the start, and Iron Man knew Captain America and Steve Rogers in equal part.
“Steve,” she whispers. She pities him, like everyone else does. Did. But only she understands why. Steve wonders how Sam and Bucky would react. In the end, he’s happiest with Pepper finding out first. She’d understand him the most, and he’s glad, with all the connections he’s lost lately, that he’s been able to form a new one.
Tony gives his sixth eulogy in a month. He pays out death gratuities and survivor benefit plans like they're bonuses. There's paperwork with his signature out there, with his tear and blood stains hurriedly wiped off.
“Whoa, okay.” Carol pointed a finger between the two of them. “Where'd this come from!? I thought you two were fighting!”
Rogers's eyes still bore a hole into Steve. “Then who are you?” The hesitation told plain as words that he wasn't as unsure of the answer as the question suggested.
The man looked between them both, looking more and more nervous. “I mean, if it’s an issue, I could leave. I really don’t want to get on Captain America’s bad side.”
Steve rushes to the nearest trash can, ready to cough up the phlegm. It’s painful as it comes up, scratching against his throat and leaving a burn behind. When he finally spits it into the trash, he doesn’t understand what he’s looking at. Had he managed to swallow a piece of paper without realizing? It’s wet and disgusting, but curiosity gets the better of him as he picks it up gingerly between his fingers. It’s a flower petal, he realizes abruptly, rubbing it carefully as it rolls up and finally crumples between his fingers.
“You have to wake up,” Steve said, and his own voice made him jump in the silence of the room. He reached out, grasping Tony’s hand, ignoring how his own hand trembled. “You wouldn’t go down without a fight, would you? How would you like people to remember you like that?” The beeping of the heart monitor would never leave his mind as long as he lived.
“I don’t know if I can. I don't know what I’ll do without him,” Steve admitted. It was a stupid thing to say, to the woman who’d lived most of her life with her best friend, when it'd only been a few months for Steve. Steve was happy, comfortable, even. He was also —
But, in the end, you did what you had to do with what was on hand, and if that included sending men who qualified for the senior discount into the field, then so be it. Thus, Steve had upgraded himself in rapid succession from handler to support to punching his way through Hydra infested small-town America. That was how he had ended up here, with—
He remembers Tony’s hand clasped in his, and the shock that went through his body then. This feeling is different, like Steve can’t breathe. Literally, as he stuffs his mouth against his elbow and his body vibrates with his messy, suppressed cough.
“I don’t have any plan to, but if you need the place to yourself.” Steve gritted his teeth. “I’m sure Richard would appreciate my absence.”
Steve picked up the mug and breathed in the smell. Whatever the taste, it had a enticing, heady aroma. It reminded him of Tony.
“Yes.” The answer was immediate, and after a pause, Steve continued. “This world isn't so bad. But it's not home.”
They have all the Infinity Stones. They’d succeeded, or rather, no one had failed, not after hearing Clint’s story of Vormir.
If Tony went, it should be on his own terms. Flashy, a spectacle, a daredevil dive into sacrifice and glory, and not a trace remaining but his renown. He’d made enough of his mark on the world, Tony would say, enough to want his life to be more memorable than the circumstances of his death.
The man took no time in rushing out, not even minding how his camera swung wildly from its strap and banged against a few tables as he ran out. Steve felt an impossible headache coming on watching him go, as the supersoldier serum had nipped those in the bud.
Steve grunted in non-surprise, rolling his shoulders back. “Well, let's hope this world is welcoming to visitors.”
Tony doesn’t want to risk not being there for his family. Scott’s getting more and more agitated, and Natasha’s careful to hide the resignation in her voice. But Tony’s obstinate, and nothing they say can get him to change his mind. And can Steve really blame him? Tony had told him once, that this is what he wanted. A farm with Pepper, and Steve had honestly thought he’d meant it as a joke back then. There were so many ways he couldn’t read Tony back then, but that part hadn’t really changed. But here Tony is, a farm with his wife and daughter. He didn’t have that before the Avengers. He probably couldn’t have done that on the Avengers. Isn’t that why Clint had kept retiring from the team?
The shield clipped her boot, and she shot a blast after it. No time for checking if it'd hit its mark, now that Steve was defenseless. Steve braced himself, ready to dodge in either direction, but Carol was anything but predictable.

No one was there to greet Steve at the entrance to the penthouse. Not that he minded; it gave him more time to swallow his pride.
Pepper bites her lip, but she doesn’t say anything. He comes to the awful realization that she understands how he feels.
Steve bounded quickly, so that when the ogre could track him with his eyes, he already had it in a headlock. It roared, scrabbling at him with thick, jagged nails. Steve squeezed tighter, sending kick after kick into its spine. After a roar, something smacked against the side of his head, sending him reeling. He whipped his head around before he was grabbed by the scruff of the neck, swung around so the ogre could look down at him with its nauseating breath. Steve grit his teeth and blinked the sun out of his eyes. But no, the sun
