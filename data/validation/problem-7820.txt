The rhythm changes, abrupt and sudden, fast and thick. The change in angle means Steve hits deeper now, enough so that Tony thinks he can almost feel him on the back of his throat. And he knows, from the way sweat pools in the shadows of Steve’s arms, from the little grunts wrung from Steve every so often, that the angle has changed something for him too, made him feel Tony
It would be funny how quick the team has slipped into domesticity if it wasn’t so tragic. After the battle of New York, they parted for a long while and Steve wasn’t sure if the Avengers Initiative would in fact simply fade into a failed experiment, one that just couldn’t stick when so many unknown entities were involved. But what they do, saving the world, is quite a niche pastime, and there is only so long you can
Poor Pepper was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and sootings and attentions that Antonia could give, and it was heavy work. Pepper listened quietly, only interjecting to agree “yes it was true, Miss Stark was right, it was not worthwhile to think about them – she’d think about them no longer.” But to Antonia’s dismay no subject change could prevail, and the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Hammers as before.
Tony's left eyebrow quirks up in question and
with Captain Rogers, first in interest and affection. Having had it and taking it for granted all these years, she had enjoyed it without reflection or care; and only now in the dread of being dismissed, did she realize how important it had been to her. She had been first with him for many years past. She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent or perverse, slighting his advice, or even willfully opposing him, quarrelling with him for the simple fact that she felt she
Life is full of percentages. Of calculated risks, and less calculated luck. And Steve is a numbers man. He’s not, by any means, a genius (Bucky would snort at the thought) but he can’t explain the way percentages of success and failure float in front of his eyelids in any given situation. It’s what made him great in the Army, rising through the ranks quickly and quietly before his honourable discharge. It’s what makes him great now as a security consultant.
“Is that, is that a-“ He can’t get the words out, “Is that a Pollock?” Immediately drawn to it, he barely hears Tony’s reply.
man.” Tony groans out, as Steve twists his fingers in a particularly filthy move that means they skate across his prostate and cause sparks to light up past his eyelids.
“Oh!” Mr. Hammer crows, “but what is this?” he reaches down and plucks the picture from her grasp, and Antonia flushes at the intimacy before them both.
she couldn’t cook. The audacity.”
The look on Steve’s face goes through pure confusion, to amusement, to down-right
“I merely wanted to point out that as I am in the room, I can probably recount every single detail of my letters myself.” Natasha spoke softly, voice light in tone with her hands remaining folded on her lap. The very picture of a distinguished lady.
if the knowledge and feel of how he’s already got Tony near wrecked doesn’t spur him on. He’s suddenly fiercely glad of the gutter talk he’d been subjected to in barracks, of Bucky’s stories, because it’s what makes him cover a finger in lube and lean forward to take Tony in his mouth at the same time as circling a slick finger round his hole.
He tips forward, capturing Tony’s lips with his own.
“You are usually out and about nowadays whenever I visit,” he turns now, focus settling on Antonia like a warm shroud placed around her shoulders, “Always in the company of the prodigal son.”
“For what?” Steven replied, and Antonia was suddenly aware of the intimacy of their situation. Most other guests had adjourned to the dance hall, leaving them stood together in the eave of the dining room, utterly alone aside the soft music of chatter accompanying them.
“Steve –“ Tony sounds
to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition. He seemed by this connection between the families, to almost belong to her. And she knew that others thought it a good match, if for how much the very being of Clint Barton was thrown in her face. She had a great curiosity to meet him, a decided intention to find him pleasant and of being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure in being coupled by friends’ imaginations. Perhaps of recent, the idea of him had perhaps interested her less, but she thought that perhaps only due how hard she had been working on her matchmaking.
“Yes – what should hurt me? I walk fast and will be home in twenty minutes.”
“I will take my leave.” He finally says, “thank you for the dance, Antonia.” He bows once, quick and sharp, treating Antonia to the sight of his back, all leashed and powerful muscle looking tense and ready to leap into battle, before straightening up again, and striding off the dance floor. She misses him flexing and rubbing his hands, can’t see his cheeks ruddy and red, can’t hear his breath uneven and close to gasps.
thought Antonia wryly as Miss. Hill’s face transformed.
“I thought gentlemen rode in carriages?” Steven bites back, tone devoid of humour, and Antonia looks at him questioningly. She thought they had buried whatever grievances they had. She raises her eyebrows at him, but before he can follow himself up, a raised cough of attention causes her eyes to skitter across and land on Mr. Hammer, who smiles and raises his glass at her in toast. She smiles, awkwardly, and raises her own, hiding her grimace behind it.
“Don’t worry about it.” He tries to inject aloofness into his voice, but even he can hear it fall flat and break.
” Tony surges forward and captures Steve’s lips with his own.
Mr. Hammer was first seen at church; but though devotion may be interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bridge in a pew, and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to settle whether she were very pretty, or only rather pretty, or not pretty at all.
“I must depend on Antonia’s sense far more than you do, or at least am so anxious to hear her rebuke this with her wicked tongue as she will want to do, because I cannot agree with you. How well my darling looked last night!”
Their subjects in general were such as belongs to an opening acquaintance. On his side were the inquiries – “Was she a horsewoman? – pleasant rides? – pleasant walks? – had they a large neighbourhood? – was it a musical society? – an active one?”
“We will discuss no more, you are always so keen to find me disagreeable.” Antonia remarks in a cool tone.
“How serious?! I can think of but one thing – who is in love with her? Who makes you their confidant?”
“I think I’d rather dance with the aunt than the niece.” He muttered to her, not unkindly but certainly not pleasantly, yet Antonia could not help but giggle. Clint brought something out in her, a childishness which she couldn’t help but indulge.
“I don’t think it’s any of your business.” Tony bites, words sharp, sees Maria flinch when they cut her.
Forget that this thing has a time-limit.
She knew no better solution than to offer the now crowd of people around her a couple of shillings and inch her way forward through the clamourous and excitable group of strangers. But her purse was too tempting to be forgotten about once she had offered them some small measure of it, and they followed her with a demand of more.
The very day that the portrait was finally done, and Mr. Hammer entreated with taking the likeness down to London to choose a frame, provided a fresh occasion for Antonia to help her friend. It had begun as a usual day, with Virginia at Hartfield soon after breakfast; after a time going home to return again to dinner. However this particular day she returned far earlier than usual, with an agitated and harried look, grin affixed to her face so wide it would nearly split her face in two.
worse.” Antonia intoned, stressing every word in hopes the mention of his beloved would awaken him from the excitement he was infused with.
Her obvious and distasteful shock at the want of two drawing rooms, at the poor attempt at rout-cakes, at there being no ice in the Highbury card-parties. She wanted unbroken card packs with separate candles, more waiters engaged for evenings, more proper order and civility than she apparently viewed from Highbury. It drove Antonia wild.
They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls, “Well my dear,” said he, as they entered the room, “I have brought her, and I shall leave you together.”
Tony’s breathing, but only just, and Steve knows better than to try shake him awake, unsure of what damage has been done and unwilling to remove him from the suit which might be
She smiled and they stepped up the steps together, and when Steven let go of her arm and she walked up to Mr. Barton she pretended she didn’t feel bereft at the touch.
Miss Hill was clearly more spry than she looked, for she made it downstairs in quick time to swing the door open wide; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to, pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.
Steve laughs softly until he catches Tony’s eye. The man is watching him with a look so intense Steve could almost drown in it.
“Miss Hill!” Antonia cried, tone pleading, when Miss. Hill opened the door to them on the third knock, “I know that it is Thursday and therefore there is no possibility of hearing any news of Natasha, but, well.
), but it had been an unspoken agreement that when Steve came to pick Tony up in the aftermath of breaking the chains of his Howard-made shackles that the only place he was driving was to his little threadbare apartment.
He’s just starting to think his stomach is about to rebel and expel itself from his system in protest, when the lab door thunders open, startlingly loud into the quiet of tinkering and metal on metal. His supervisor, Hank, looks up ready to shout at the offender, rendered mute by what greets him.
Mr. Hammer is pale now, and in this state of stewing anger (her) and swelling resentment and mortification (him), they had to continue together for a few minutes longer. If there had not been so much anger, and ill words, there would not be so much desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room. Finally they found themselves at the door of his house and he was out before another syllable passed, and she could not find it in her heart to swallow her anger and allow her manners to wish him a good night. He complimented her with such anyway, coldly and proudly, with a colouring of fear, then finally she was conveyed to Hartfield.
“Oh my darling,” Tony says, voice broken and flayed open, “Am I glad to see you.”
“There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,” said she afterwards to herself. “There is nothing to be compared to it. Warmth and tenderness f heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all the clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will. It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear mother so beloved – I have it not – but I know how to prize and respect it. Pepper is my superior in all the charm and felicity it gives. Dear Pepper – oh the coldness of Natasha Romanov – Pepper is worth a hundred of such – And for a wife – a sensible man’s wife – it is invaluable!”
He’s barely surviving, this half-life, going through the motions like a ghost, ice crawling back up his throat ready to choke him. One dream nearly kills him, a vicious one that has him confessing at Tony’s deathbed, one sacrifice for another. It leaves him shaking and screaming, waking sweating and disorientated. It takes a moment to focus, recalibrate, and in that moment his door is flung open, and Tony is there.
The pair giggle quietly together, heads bent towards each other, and Antonia leans on him to regain her composure. “I was convinced he was in love with Pepper, how could I have been so stupid?”
Mr. and Mrs. Hammer appeared; and all the smiles and proprieties passed.
“You’ve got a nose for trouble, ain’t ya Stevie?” James - Bucky - Barnes says, Brooklyn accent thick, voice heavy with humour. All Tony can blur together is tall, dark hair, and a fond smile directed at his mark like it’s never out of place when he’s around. He feels something sharp settle in his lungs, jealousy like broken bottles in his heart. Here’s someone who knows Steve Rogers like the back of his hand, knows everything that makes him who he is, that brought him to Tony. He’s not sure how he feels about it.
Maria turns to Tony, tears free flowing now, mascara like rings around her eyes, “Anthony-“
the damage she had done. “Oh dear. I now recollected what you mean, but my thoughts were of something else entirely. It was not Clint Barton that I meant. I was indeed thinking of a much more precious circumstance – of Captain. Rogers’ coming and asking me to dance when Mr. Hammer would not stand up with me. It was that kind action; that noble benevolence and generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other person in that room.”
“What an excellent idea!” he chirped, “Sheepskin to cover the seats in carriages in winter – impossible to feel cold with such precautions! How wonderfully cozy we all are.” He accompanied this with a shuffle, moving toward Antonia with a smile. Bruce caught Antonia’s eyes and smirked, shrugging ever so slightly much to her annoyance.
“Rogers you are a God.” He murmurs in between gulping down the drink so fast Steve’s surprised he doesn’t burn his mouth. The silence that follows isn’t so much comforting as it is awkward – he’s never known Tony to be so quiet. Watching as Tony turns back to whatever he was working on before Steve entered, he clears his throat and begins to speak.
Mr. Barton looked questioningly at her, “What do you mean?”
Bruce and her made light work of the trip in the second carriage, idle chatter and jests accompanying the drive so much so that before long they were arrived at the vicarage. The carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr. Hammer, spruce and smiling, was with them instantly. He was all obligation and cheerfulness. So very cheerful, that Antonia began to think he must have received a different account of Virginia that what had reached her.
He stays up long and late, into the small hours of the morning, looking at his reflection and settling in the knowledge that he was someone deserving of this most historical and ancient love.
Tony looks round the kitchen with unseeing eyes, rakes through drawers until he eventually stumbles across a pen, and spins back around into Steve’s waiting arms. He writes his college address across Steven’s skin, writes his mobile number there too, the ink dark against the green veins. “I’ll be back at college in three days.” He explains, not having to further suggest the words exchanged between them are safer there. Howard can’t touch them, taint them and own them as he does every other aspect of Tony.
It was in this state of scheming that Captain Rogers and Antonia decided to furnish a visit to Box Hill. It had come about one afternoon when Antonia was so very down at the prospect of not being well travelled.
Steve fills out every square inch of the khaki suit to perfection, trousers pressed within an inch of their life and the medals pinned on the left hand side are polished to shining. What Tony can’t get over, however, is the aviators perched on Steve’s head haphazardly like he’s pushed them up and forgotten about them throughout the day. Which, knowing how distracted Steve can get by drawing the New York sunset, is probably exactly what happened.
“What have you done?” He breathes, voice dropping when he sees the bandage encompassing Steve’s upper arm, “
Maria. I find no fault with her. I love to look at her,” Steven flushed at being so honest, “And I don’t think her vain. She is occupied so very little by how beautiful she is. Her vanity lies in her cleverness. I know you all insist to see her as an angel and nothing more, and I’ll forgive you for in being her mother lies your bias. But I won’t play into her vanity, if I’ll be the only one that she hates me for it.”
The next time they are called out, it’s originally minus Steve
“How could I help it? It was not so very bad. I dare even say she did not understand me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Brock had laughed,
“And what did you say to the Cages?”
Antonia refused to be swayed, “I don’t think so Steve. Natasha Romanov may be the champion of the written word or pianoforte; but
The confession completely unmanned her, renewing her shame, and the sight of Pepper crying so prettily made her want to hit her head against the nearest hard surface repeatedly.
Antonia’s courage returned, and she walked on.
Tony is not even ashamed to admit he lets out a squeak of delight before his eyes are laser focused on Steve slathering lube across his fingers, dropping down the bed to press kisses across Tony’s thighs and whisper a breath across his hole. The gentle exhale makes Tony’s eyes roll back in his head, lost in the sensation.
He drops Tony onto the bed gently, like he’s fine china that could break at the slightest rough movement. Tony may say that Stark’s are made of iron, but Steve knows better. His love is made of stardust and onyx, and he will not treat him like so many others, like it doesn’t matter if they push he’ll only bend not break. Tony is a precious gemstone, like the rare black Opal, and should be treated as such.
that makes Steve who he is. He wants to break him apart and put him back together in divine adulation that would leave them both shaking.
it though?” Steve blurts out, frustration and exhaustion clouding his voice, “How can you stand to watch anyone suffer?”
But he digresses. The long and short of it is, that he is shit hot at seeing the risk, calculating his room for failure, and choosing the best option. He prides himself on it, it is what has earnt him the begrudging respect of nearly every military field. But it still doesn’t explain that when they are all sat amidst takeout and blueprints at headquarters late one night (as nearly every night is spent), upon the conversation finally taking a turn for the personal, he does something stupid. When Nat and Clint quiz him for the millionth time, relentless, he looks up from where he’s poring over paperwork and interior layouts, opens his mouth, and blurts “I’m dating Tony Stark.”
He continues to sink into Tony’s heat until he bottoms out and they moan in tandem at the sensation, Steve breathing hard through his mouth to stop from coming immediately, “Jesus, honey.” is all he can say, drunk on finally and completely having Tony as
The car is silent to begin with, Tony staring out into the dark, Sam mumbling in his sleep in the backseat, Steve focusing on driving entirely too much for a guy who once drove a truck one handed into a glacier.
Steven’s gaze sharpened, “What did he do Antonia.” The words are toneless. This is not a question, this is a demand, this is a soldier ready to do battle.
Tony knows, when he’s beaten and bloody on the locker room floor watching Steve through the eye not crusted over with blood, that he will never love anyone as fiercely as he does Steve Rogers.
The picture she gazed upon was indeed flattering. It had been painted not long after Steven’s conscription had ended, in fact if she recalled he had been released not a day earlier for returning. Antonia remembers nothing but profound gratitude for the Almighty as she flung her arms around him on the steps of Hartfield, and her mother ushering them both in with tears in her eyes.
Steven’s face was red in apoplexy, “A man does not imagine any such thing Antonia, don’t turn this into one of your lectures! Miss Potts refuse Mr Rhodes? It is madness. You must be mistaken.”
“He’s dead.” Her words are blunt, brutal, ripped from her lungs on a gasp of air. “He’s dead. And I am not. We don’t - we don’t get happy endings, Anthony. Not for us. Not from this. Not from him.” He doesn’t need her to expand on who she means, “Do not ever tell your father if you get a soulmark. Everything is currency to him, and this,” she strokes long delicate fingers across the slivering petals and Tony hides a shiver, “this is your highest price. The only price you will always be willing to pay.”
It’s a realisation that sends hot shame running down his back, that sets his cheeks on fire and mind reeling. The feelings that have been burgeoning inside him refuse to be tampered down, and he can no longer excuse them as empathy, or concern for a teammate, or even awe. They refuse to lie dormant, and in a rush Steve remembers what these taboo emotions used to grant him. It brings back memories of back alleys been beaten and taunted. Of jibes in class and doctor’s visits that classed him as ‘diseased’.
The Starks had been settled for several generations at Hartfield, a branch of a very ancient family – and in comparison the Hammers were of no consequence. Hartfield was the lifeblood of Highbury, not only keeping the majority in employment, but lending its sprawling land to tenants. In fact, the only estate that rivalled them was Donwell. And, well, that belonged to Captain Rogers, left to him by his father. He had not wanted for it, but responsibility was a heavy burden, and when it was either accept the mantle that Donwell carried or leave it in the wind, there was only one choice. And so the two estates reached forwards together into the heart of England and carved their mark.
She shook her head in response, “Oh it doesn’t really matter, dear heart.”
“Jarvis, don’t you agree?” Antonia was full steam into a fully fleshed argument, colour flush on her cheeks. “That of course Steven is not the secret admirer of Miss Romanov, and certainly did not gift her a pianoforte without anyone’s knowledge!”
Antonia was dumbstruck now, in humble horror at the ruination she herself had spurred on with idle thought and misplaced emotions, “Have you any idea of Captain. Rogers returning your affection?” she asked, voice hoarse.
The bitterness clogged Antonia’s throat so she nearly choked on it, “Pepper I will only venture to declare that Captain Rogers is the last man in the world who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he already does.”
He kisses Tony’s shoulder as he presses in slowly, watches Tony’s face for any hint of discomfort. A twinge of pain shoots through him in feedback from his love, and he slows to a stop, waiting until it’s gone before pressing forward again, mouthing at Tony’s skin all the while.
They leave not soon later, quiet for a moment before Pepper begins.
She felt all the honest pride and complacency of a woman in alliance with the present proprietor, like Donwell was a second home rather than the household of a friend. Its ample gardens stretched down to meadows washed by a stream. The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike it, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular unlike the manicured lawns of her own household. The house was just as it ought to be; willful, sprawling, yet with a backbone of character much like its owner. She wandered about the estate in perfect happiness for as long as she dared before it was necessary to join the others.
He smiled, graciously, hiding annoyance deep down, “Ah – no thank you. As you can see – most of the guests are here now.”
Towelling himself dry he sits on the edge of the bed, head buried in his hands, and the minutes drag into hours, which bleed into days, and before he knows it there is a soft knock at the door and his eyes are burning from lack of sleep.
“There’s no turning back now.” The words are directed at Jarvis and Happy who are beginning to fold into Maria’s car. Tony feels hope burn his lungs, “If you come with us. There won’t be a job on your return.”
The next morning brought Mr. Clint Barton again. He came with Mrs. Marvel, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially. He had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home, till her usual hour of exercise; and on being asked to choose their direction of walking, immediately fixed on Hartfield.
Tony balks, hurt shooting through his eyes before it’s masked as quick as it arrived, “Do you know, you’re not the first to assume the worst about me.” He looks up, smile sad, “You’re the first to be wrong, though.”
of us is such a fanciful and troublesome creature! I am sure you would not hold your tongue so well if my mother was not here.”
“Antonia, you have done nothing to be ashamed of. It is he who should hang his head – abominable, detestable
Every single time Steve goes up against danger and comes up short, you can find Tony beside his hospital bed, knuckles white. The serum works overtime in these periods to stitch Steve back together, and Tony is forever terrified that this will be the time Erskine’s formula calls it quits.
“And my idea,” said Captain. Rogers, “is that if he turns out anything like that, he will be insufferable. A practiced politician – a jack of all trades – who reads everyone’s character and knows enough to skim the surface but not enough to care or encourage. To display his own superiority in knowing everything and dispense shallow flatteries! My dear Antonia, I know you far too well to even try to endure such a person.”
Antonia had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she made a point of Pepper’s going with her, that the worst of the business may be gone through as soon as possible.
“Is Miss Stark sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of?”
concern you, and there is no need to feel uneasy. But I don’t say it is not a disagreeable business – but things could be much worse.”
“Because I don’t need to. I was on the point of walking, but Winston here wanted an outing. Didn’t you, old fellow?” he speaks to the horse now, eyes roaming over the animal’s face.
“Sorry,
“The Bartons are probably at fault,” said Captain Rogers, coolly; “But I dare say he probably would not come even if the door was open to him.”
Maria did well, she felt, to conceal some of her most privileged and precious thoughts on the subject, in the face of Steven’s arduous care and consideration of Antonia. There was only so much he could attempt to conceal his affection for her daughter, and as yet there were words that lingered, unspoken by both parties. She would not affect her daughter’s destiny as much as she would not force Steven’s hand. She would be happy, delighted, if the match was to come about. But she was too old for matchmaking, and the quiet if obvious transition which Mr. Rogers soon made afterwards to “What does Jarvis think of the weather, shall we have rain?” convinced her he had nothing more to say at the time of Hartfield, or the young girl he cared so much for that lived within it.
thought of you as a suitor for my friend. I am sorry you are mistaken, but I never gave you any sort of encouragement. I have no thoughts of matrimony at the present.”
The chatter in the room continues, enough for Mr. Marvel to lower his voice beside her, “We hope there will not be another put-off. Between us, I hope he will have no reason to stay away, His grandmother is – she is an odd woman! – But I never allow myself to speak ill of her, on Clint’s account, as I believe her very fond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond of anybody, except herself; but she has always been kind to him, if not to me. And it is compliment to himself that he should excite such affection in her, as she has no more heart than a stone to people in general.” His eyes grow dark, “And a devil of a temper.”
“Yes – oh – yes!” he replied, “I was going to mention it. A very successful visit, I saw all the family and felt much obliged for your preparatory, if in jest, hint. If the talking aunt had taken me by surprise, it could have been the death of me. Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper. Yet I was not able to get away for at least an hour or two. The good lady gave me no chance of escape.” The pair giggle, forward into each others space.
“My father is home and he - he won’t approve. He doesn’t think I have a mark.” And Tony knows, knows that this is a story he will have to share, one day, between whispers and affirmations and happiness, but it’s not a tale for now. Not when he’s so incandescently happy he vibrates with it, “I have to go.”
“Hey T.” Steve says, “You ready?”
Advanced healing has its perks, one being that even if he practices throwing his punches against a sandbag to the point his knuckle wrappings become red with blood there is no scarring, and by the time breakfast rolls around with the other Avengers no one is any the wiser.
The gardens are thick with silence in reply to her outburst.
“Why Miss Stark, do not even think that. Your dancing makes Miss Romanov look like a shrew.” Clint Barton joked back, and Antonia let the words warm her.
“If you’re sure.” Tony replies, and Steve is hit with a rush of tender affection for this miracle of a man. He could not do enough to deserve him in a thousand lifetimes.
“My worries about the match were for him, I thought he could do no worse. But he was so in love with her – he IS so in love with her, he would not be reasoned with! For Christ’s – I even thought of you! I even though ‘Antonia will think this a good match’”
“Were I in love, it would be a different thing. But I have never been in love. It is not my way, or nature, and I don’t think I ever will be. And without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a gilded situation as mine. Fortune, employment, consequence, I do not want for any of these. I believe few married women are half as much a mistress of their husband’s house as I am of Hartfield. And never could I be held in such high regard, to be thought of so truly and beloved and important in any person’s eyes as I am my mothers.” Merely a few weeks ago, these words would have been true, but for whatever reason they now seemed hollow on Antonia’s lips. She doesn’t pause too long to study that, banishing such odd thoughts from her brain.
“They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?”
Tony whimpers.
The right side of his mouth curls into a smirk before he answers, “So you don’t want to share me? You sure cause I think Clint might be down for that… or maybe we could call up Hammer…”
So that’s how it happened. And now we are back in again with the clusterfuck that is Steve G. Rogers life.
“We’re going. Can you pack a bag quick? Anything you forget we can get you.” And Sarah looks at him like he’s grown two heads, and he doesn’t mean to be sharp but every minute they spend delaying is precious seconds wasted that he could be by Steve’s side. “Sarah.” He says, short, and she comes round, “We have a military escort. We’ll be in Africa by tomorrow evening. Can you pack a bag quick.” He repeats himself, watches Sarah slowly register the order like it’s coming to her through water.
He’ll frame well thought out, perfectly structured and passionate chains of language without a second thought. Tony considers it a phenomenally attractive part of him, thinks it like foreplay at times (which, judging by the disbelieving and disgusted looks Pepper occasionally shot him in the middle of a Steve diatribe, Tony hanging off his every word, he thought he might be less subtle than he thought).
When all’s said and done, Steve’s lucky he has such great friends. Those that take one look at his broken shell at work the next morning, and let him hurt internally without digging into the wound.
With such thoughts, Mr. Hammer’s civilities were woefully unreciprocated, and ridiculously ill-timed; but she remained polite, while feeling very cross – and thinking that for sure Mrs. Marvel would bring forward the same information again at some point during the visit. And she was not wrong, when she finally was happily released from Mr. Hammer, and seated by Mr. Marvel at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality, to say to her.
“Make it stop!!!” Bucky chimes in, voice in staged fake horror.
“You are a dark horse, Captain Rogers.” She said now upon their arrival.
“I’ve been thinking about getting in touch with Reed, seeing if he can give us some information about adapting the synthetic fibres within the Four’s suits.” Tony goes for nonchalance – as if Steve’s well-being isn’t something he is invested in all that much, but Steve knows Tony well, and Steve would bet his shield on the fact the genius has already emailed Dr Richards about the very same thing. Waving off everyone else, Steve limped up to his room and collapsed onto his sofa.
“It’s fine, he’s been informed.” They step out together when she’s ready, and her steps only falter slightly when she tracks the black car waiting at the bottom of the drive. Happy’s stood by the back door, friendly airs and graces he puts on for Tony gone. He looks imposing in a sleek black suit, looks the part, “Anthony, what did you do?” Sarah asks, quietly, and maybe the question is more rhetorical than anything else. He tells himself that’s why he doesn’t answer.
“Oh EUGHH.” Clint gags from behind them.
Steven’s smile is like the summer solstice sun.
“Yes, well, I knew her from Weymouth.” He replies, apropos of nothing.
In hindsight, Antonia realises that perhaps jealousy coloured the majority of her feelings toward Miss Romanov, and made her unkind in the first instance. And, well, can you blame the pair for being at war from then on?
“I don’t-“ Steven starts, stutters and stops, “As a friend! Friends indeed. I have gone too far now for concealment. So tell me then, must I have no chance of ever succeeding?”
They are fighting these monstrous looking animals in Queens, 50 foot high and look like they’ve been turned inside out with teeth that, individually, are the size of Steve. When they first spotted them, having been put on call by S.H.I.E.L.D, Bruce vomited on his shoes. They are the stuff of nightmares and Steve knows he will be getting no sleep for a while.
of you, before leaving without so much as a by your leave. A wham-bam-thank you ma’am. But hey, at least you can tell everyone you fucked Tony Stark right? Should have made you sign a fucking NDA.”
“I am ready, if the others are. I believe Bruce and Elizabeth will be glad to get home to Harriet in such weather.” Antonia beams at Steven, so aware of not only her needs, but her families. Maria hates the cold, dreads it, and her health Is not what it once was, a slight chill able to knock her for months.
He’s not sure whose idea it is, but Tony ends up lifted onto one of the kitchen counters, legs moving instinctively to wrap around Steve’s waist, encourage him closer. He feels flayed open, wants to invite Steve in to the darkest parts of his soul, let him stay there forever. He can feel the feedback of his own maelstrom of emotions singing back at him in the most glorious choir song, feels the mark at his collarbone
, that this reaction is all for him. He wants to swim in it, get drunk on it. He feels the ghost memory of Steven’s lips against his from last night, and viciously wants a repeat so bad he aches with it.
They are intimately, achingly close now. Tony insistently trying to ignore how perfectly he fits into the space of Steve’s arms, like it was made for him. He can count every individual eyelash against Steven’s cheek, can see every fleck of green amongst the ocean blue of his eyes, sees the freckles like constellations across his nose. He watches Steve’s eyes flutter shut, like he’s fighting against sleep, like he’s as desperate to soak Tony in as Tony is to Steve.
“Dependency, trust and respect is not ‘charm’, Antonia.” Steven smarts in response, “They would feel they could trust him, the nephew who has done right by his father, would do rightly by them.”
Tony’s aware he’s bitten through his bottom lip to prevent himself screaming, knows the mad smile he graces his father with is bloody and unhinged.
dearest Captain, please know that our friendship has never been out of pity. Not for me, not even close.” Antonia says it like it’s the only thing she wants him to know. The only thing he needs to hear.
The silence that falls stretches out like thick toffee and Tony gulps first. Steve tracks the movement and it almost looks like Tony goes to speak before Steve’s phone snaps the moment as it buzzes three times in quick succession.
“You can have all the seconds you want. We don’t have to do anything else tonight if you want.” And whilst he feels his erection wilt at that sentence, he knows he means it. He’d give Tony anything, he’d open his rib cage and pull out his heart for him to hold in his hand if he could. He can go without, if it’s too much for his love.
Steve fixed his lover with a look. It was a look that Steve thought seemed firm and amused, but Tony had transcribed it to mean
What follows is nothing too much of note, Antonia thinks, just simple gentle guiding of Pepper through dinner etiquette with a series of frowns, nods, and smiles where appropriate.
Tony loses all sense of time, it could be minutes or hours when Steve next hitches his legs up to rest on his chest. He can’t help the immaturity of sticking a toe in his lover’s ear, sticking a tongue out when Steve groans.
“I will, however, be calling on Miss Hill in the morning, if you need me to pass on any felicitations.” Said Antonia, and if her mother found the sudden announcement of a visit to their old mutual family acquaintance, she did not speak it.
Steve is almost ashamed, Thor has a better grip on Earth than he does.
For such an earth-shattering realization, a paradigm shift in Steve’s very soul, the world doesn’t suddenly stop turning. It’s kind of a let-down, considering the upheaval he feels, but he welcomes the reprieve. Tony is a day away from being released from hospital, maybe less considering how ferociously he is terrorizing the nursing staff. All indications point towards him being back to his usual self, and that thought terrifies and excites Steve in equal measure.
Miss Romanov was, how well she carried herself. Her height was pretty, her figure graceful, not like Antonia’s almost garishly tall features that Steve poked fun at regularly. Her face was a graceful beauty, one that did not slap you in the face but one you would remember and wish to see again. Her hair fiery, a memorable dash of colour against a pale face.
The phone keeps ringing.
“Steve?” His voice is barely a whisper, breath ruffling the golden curls of Steve’s bed head, “Steve.” He repeats, voice firmer, watches as Steve stirs into wakefulness.
“I have been asked by the group to have a chat with you Captain, do you know why?” Nick Fury’s voice is one Steve could go his whole life without hearing ever again. It manages to sound patronising, world-weary and respectful all at the same time, and Steve hates it.
Steve is snoring softly by his side, one hand still in Tony’s, knelt by the bed like he’s praying for forgiveness. It looks horrendously uncomfortable, Steve still fully clothed down to his shined shoes, and Tony feels a wave of gratitude and affection sweep through him like a tidal wave.
Virginia smiled weakly as he looked toward her, before the smile turned to a grimace once his back was turned. For the pose they had chosen, whilst best to show off Virginia’s lithe figure and milky skin, involved holding a vase
Steve chokes off a moan and arcs into the touch, feels lust spark across his vision like fingers skating across guitar strings.
Tony’s eyes, liquid honey poured over just browned toast. Flecked starlight amongst the backdrop of the sun. Steve uses them as an anchor, holding fast.
“Why should that bother you,” Steven replies, broad back still facing away from her, “You would never dream of accepting an invitation from the Cages.”
“So that means you’ll meddle later,” Steve (correctly) infers, “Nat?” He asks as she walks away, drinks in hand, “Nat?”
“Oh, ah, no, no thank you Mr. Hammer, I am quite comfortable for now.” She elbows Steven subtly, for she can practically
“We didn’t think you’d have ended up getting back on a fucking unicorn.” Clint snorts, and Steve treats him with a glare.
“Oh?”
It is upon one of these conversations that Virginia pauses, gazes at Antonia awhile in a way that suggests to Antonia she is about to ask a question she will not like.
“You are most welcome.” Steven replied, voice quiet in a way that usually was reserved solely for Antonia.
He feels his release build behind his eyelids, fast and sure, and Steve has enough presence of mind, roleplay be damned, to groan “Tony, I’m gonna – you gotta.” So Tony clenches down as they both fall apart together, groan into each other’s air like a prayer.
Tony tries not to look too hard.
“I need to be invited to one of your ragers Thor, they sound right up my alley.” Tony comments, and upon Thor’s look of confusion, groans. “You have no
Antonia frowns, “Nothing lucky about it. Just talent, and intuition.” She boasts, watching as the sides of Steve’s lips quirk up in an all too familiar gesture that meant he was trying to stop from smiling.
He’s never looked so attractive.
Mr. Marvel was exceedingly disappointed – much more so than the remarkably sanguine Mrs. Marvel. Though the disappointment does not last long, as hope always seems to conquer it, and before long they are in agreement that Clint’s arrival in a few months would be a much better time of year for his attendance. How clever he was to be rearranging to better weather, when he could surely stay far longer.
“Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse when you ask in such a way. But what is the matter? Is she really not ill?” They left, and set a pace quick for Randalls.
"Are you referring to the little elderly woman who has just taken her dentures out, or the man in the suit and goatee?" Steve asks with a hint of humour when Sam shakes his head quickly.
Once Steve was armed with proper ammunition (a steaming cup of Italian roast in one hand and a sandwich in the other) he padded down to the workshop. The walls to it were glass, so he stood and watched Tony work, glad of the brief interlude.
Unbeknownst to her, Maria Stark watches her closely, feels her heart break in sympathy for her daughter still so oblivious to her own feelings yet clearly undone in the face of them, “I don’t know why everyone is suddenly affected with such wanderlust. I am sure Captain Rogers will realise his folly and be back soon.”
“I don’t…” Steve pants, like he’s run a mile, “I don’t give a fuck what fate thinks I want. Words on my skin before I am even born have nothing to do with who I am now. Who I love.”
sooner.” Mr. Barton says, smile still affixed to his face. His eyes trembled with mischief and delight, and Antonia found herself warming more and more to this man. He did really look and speak as if in a state of permanent enjoyment.
He doesn’t get to find out if that’s the case as the monster gets thrown aside.
“Mr. Hammer indeed!” cried Pepper indignantly, “It certainly does not proceed... So superior to Mr. Hammer.”
“I am so pleased you liked the pork” Antonia interjects, voice loud and startling, “We aim to take great care of our pigs here at Hartfield.”
Natasha had not been gone a quarter of an hour, when Clint Barton entered the room. Antonia had forgotten to think of him – but indeed they had been right to name his relative as the cause. He had been detained by her nervous seizure, but had he known how hot a ride he should have and how late, he believed he should not have come at all. Nothing killed him like heat he said, he could bear cold or wind or rain but heat was intolerable. He sat down loudly, at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of Mrs. Stark’s fire, looking very deplorable.
“It is very unfair to judge of any body’s conduct,” Steve snorts in response to this, but Antonia merely raises her eyebrows and barrels on, “without intimate knowledge of their situation. If you have not been in the interior of a family, how can you comment or say what difficulties of any individual of that family may be. We cannot be aware of his aunt and uncle, whether they have a particular temper or anger toward him showing any favour to his father.”
Some change of countenance was necessary for both of them as they walked into Mrs. Marvel’s drawing room – Antonia must calm her racing heart and flushed face, Steven Rogers must disperse his odd gazes and serious tone. Antonia must smile less, and Captain. Rogers more, to fit them for the place. Antonia could not help the smile as nature prompted, show herself just as happy as she was for it was a true enjoyment to be with the Marvels. Mr. Marvel was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserved, as to his wife.
“The estate your friend’s husband owns in Ireland, is quite stunning or so I am told?” Antonia deliberately leans forward and points the question to Miss Romanov.
“Hey.” Tony says back, even softer. They stare at each other, eyes swimming, for what feels like only moments, before Tony leans forward and presses a kiss to Steve’s lips. It’s chaste and easy, Steve’s hands going up to tangle in Tony’s hair.
The house belonged to people in business, with Miss Hill occupying the drawing-room floow; and there, in the very moderate sized apartment, which was everything to them, sat a crackling fire, a tumbling selection of sweet cakes on the table by the window, and Natasha Romanov.
The unfortunate part of the advanced healing is that, well, no one knows how it works. There are no men like him who he can ask, or case studies he can read over. He is the original, the one and only and unfortunately the one S.H.I.E.L.D. test endlessly to see how far they can push the bar. So it’s practically impossible to know what hit will kill him – and one day it
he is to have this man). The water beats his back just this side of painful, wrenching a groan from him. He looks up through the rising steam, stepping further into Tony’s space, asking a silent question with hands that still slightly shake. Tony knows already, hands moving to wrap around him and capture Steve’s lips with his own.
And this moment should be for them, “I love you too.” Tony whispers, repeats it louder when Happy pulls Steve from the room, “Steve!”
Mr. Hammer looked suitably alarmed, though before long he enquired after their attendance at Randall’s, “I assume you will be in attendance tomorrow?”
“And there’s no reason why you shouldn’t see it for yourself. We shall find a way.” Voice firm, and Antonia couldn’t help but beam, for when Steven said so, so it shall be done.
He pauses, air rattling through his lungs and
it was well publicised that since Stark Inc had shaken off his weapons industry shackles, it went hand in hand with Stark’s public sobriety.
“Steve wants me for my sleek and beautiful body. Can’t blame him, I am gorgeous.” Clint preens, before Natasha slaps him over the head, “Ow, Nat, rude.”
“Aw baby, you wound me.” Bucky feints a swoon, earning a small smile off the usually solemn Natasha. Bucky’s an idiot sometimes, but Steve watches them interact with a hazy sort of softness and knows that Nat wouldn’t have him any other way.
Sees the proof that Steve could never be his.
“We have a new addition to our party.” Antonia smiled as everyone settled in their places at the dinner table, waving toward Pepper, “Virginia-“
It was now the middle of June, the weather rolling into a crisp summer; and Mrs. Hammer had sadly overheard of the plans to attend Potomac Hill, anxious for the group to name the day. She barely bridled her impatience when a lame carriage horse through the whole visit into uncertainty; it might be weeks or mere days before the horses were useable for such a visit, but it meant postponement for the short while.
“It’s okay, I get them too.” Tony replies, voice awkward, eyes painful as they dart around the room landing on anywhere but Steve, “Look – I know, for whatever reason, you don’t want to hang out with me anymore. And that’s fine – I’m not going to hold it against you. You lasted longer than most. But –“ and Tony takes a step further into the room, air becoming thick and heavy and stopping Steve from breathing properly, “But can I just ask, and don’t let my intense vulnerability here become any kind of factor here, can I ask what I did?”
He’s ripped momentarily from the experience by the sight of a condom box, open and half used, and he swallows. This is Tony’s world after all. This may feel like a lot more, a LOT more than a one night stand to him, but that’s not to say it feels the same for Tony. If anything, the way Steve feels right now is probably due to Tony’s ... wealth of experience. And he’s not shaming the other man for that, he’s not. He just feels suddenly overwhelmed against the shock of his own inexperience, the months since he’s taken a lover of his own shrieking at him. He calculates the risk, silently, of how disappointing he’s likely to be against the sum of Tony’s knowledge, and comes out wanting.
“Ma, where do you want this thing? It weighs a ton!” Steven Rogers voice bursts into the quiet room before he does. Tony can’t stop the way his entire body
“Pot. Kettle.” Steve huffs, walking past Bucky with his precious cargo, takes Tony to the living room and propping him up on the couch softly. And, because Steve Rogers is wonderful, he leans down with an achingly fond glance, one intimate and private yet Tony’s viciously glad Bucky’s there to see it, speaking quiet “want anything, T?”
. Golden beauty painted with a Celtic brush, full lips and flushed freckled skin. Tony’s soulmark burns like a house fire against his throat, pulses there like a fluttering butterfly. Steven gasps, and when their eyes connect he swears, low and Gaelic, arms empty. There’s a crashing sound, somewhere, in Tony’s periphery that comes to him like it’s underwater. They stare at each other, panting like they’ve run a marathon, and Tony knows
The laugh Maria graces them with from the car across the drive is light enough to float through the air.
It’s all sped up to a blur, and he hurries through checking Tony is still open and fluttering ready for him, lust crawling along his spine as he watches Tony’s hole wink at him. He sheaths himself in a condom, before running a slick fist down his cock once, twice, watching Tony’s eyes eat him up, before it’s nearly too much and he staves off any further feeling with a groan and leans forward on one hand.
like that. You can’t just not talk to me for weeks, you can’t just avoid me and then say all
“Thanks Tony.” He speaks soft, oblivious to the fact that the genius’ face reddens slightly.
Steven, entangled in the welfare of his own mount, could do no more than tip his hat at her, wish her a safe journey home, and tell her he would meet her at Hartfield, to check they all arrived safely. He said the last with a pointed stare at Mr. Hammer, a thunderous set of his jaw that gave Antonia comfort, at least she could see he was loathe to leave her. He spoke quick to Thomas, her coachmen, who turned and nodded, before sharply kicking his horse on, and the sight of Steven so in command had Antonia a flutter. Thus the door was shut on Mr. Hammer and her, and they were now to have a tete-a-tete drive. How she wished the roles of Steven and Mr. Hammer were reversed! She would have been thankful for his jokes and smiles on a journey such as this. She wrapped herself further into Steven’s cloak.
“Oh, a material difference if difference at all. No doubt you were much my superior in judgement, at all of six years old. Does not the lapse of twenty one years now bring our understandings a good deal nearer.”
Antonia was not really in a state of spirits to care about Clint Barton’s arrival, except the disappointment it brought to Randalls. The acquaintance at the time held no charm for her at all. She needed to be out of temptation, for a while, until she could be assured that Pepper’s heart was mended.
“I see no probability in it, unless you have a better foundation than what you mention. His good nature and human kindness would be enough to account for the carriage. He holds a great regard for Miss Hill, independent of Natasha Romanov. But Miss Romanov the mistress of Donwell! –“ the very thought caused Antonia to feel ill.
Tony growls at this suggestion and chases that smirk down, grabbing hold of the lapels of Steve’s jacket and dragging him into a kiss so dirty he can vaguely hear Clint hollering at them to get a room.
No seriously, Steve
Elizabeth Banner was a pretty, elegant little woman of gentle and quiet manners, that also hid a layer of steel beneath. When first courting, Antonia had worried incessantly that Bruce’s ill-humour would swallow her whole, but upon watching the two interact, she realized she was worrying over nothing. Mr. Banner was nothing but utterly respectful, so irrevocably in love he was. Captain. Rogers used to joke that Elizabeth could have told Bruce the sky was green and he’d have nodded and agreed for all the world to see. And not only did she reveal his adoration, but also his capacity to learn. They truly were ideally suited, and each complimented the other so perfectly it was enough to make Antonia heartsick.
“Oh no no!” Cried Antonia, laughing carelessly, “Upon no account, please tell me anything but the truth of what you are thinking!”
Steve just
The first time Steve truly sees Tony’s soulmark is one summer evening in the hallway of his and Bucky’s apartment. Tony’s been staying here with him since him and Maria left Howard.  He could stay elsewhere, could do what Maria has and rent a lavish penthouse on the south side (
They walked together. He was silent. She thought he was often looking at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wanted to speak to her, of his attachment to Pepper; he might be watching for encouragement to begin. She was terrified, and could not feel equal to lead the way in any such subject. But regardless, she turned to face him fully with all the dread of being lead to a firing squad.
"Hi I have a reservation under Mr. Carbonell." He says behind sunglasses and a dodgers baseball cap. He'd find it funny, how little makes him anonymous in the sharp light of the oncoming sunset, but he's too hyped up to care. Steve's moulded to his back, huffing a laugh against Tony's neck that has every hair standing to attention.
say this. He has taken advantage of me, but he has not injured me.”
A happier sight greeted her mortification – Captain Rogers, cutting a figure across the room and holding a hand out to Miss Potts. She caught Pepper’s look of surprise turn to gratitude, and she nodded once before standing. The pleasure and gratitude that filled her own breast was doubly so, longing to thank him if he was not so far away. She hoped if she caught his eye her countenance would express as much.
The quinjet cruises through the sky silently, and Steve stares through the windows at the beautiful sight of New York set alight. Behind him sit a genius encased in a metal moving suit, a demi-god who wields lightning like he would a knife, and the smartest man he’s ever met whose alter ego could kill him in fell swoop but instead has his back in every fight.
With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again at the Cage’s dinner, and for a longer time than ever before.
Antonia nods, face fully aflame now. She is resolved more than ever to no longer keep Pepper in the dark. She should be fully recovered now from her cold, and it was only fair that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before Mr. Hammer’s return. An uncomfortable penance of communication, she was warranted, and Antonia would bear such a grievance gladly for her idiocy.
Antonia barks a laugh at this image, for a wrathful Maria is one to be feared of. Steven grins, beatific across his face. He is still holding her close to his heart; but she does not move to correct him, neither does he pull away, and instead they sway there a moment or two, allowing the quiet to settle around them gently.
Now, little known to Antonia, at this very moment a conversation was being held on exactly how troubling Antonia’s new project was. For whilst Antonia believed her machinations very welcome, to others they were viewed with a less rose-tinted eye.
They did not speak, but the silence was not awkward, even for a pair who were used to bickering back and forth for as long as the hours in a day would allow them. Antonia found her throat was dry, words unwilling to come out. She felt flush, and blamed the exercise for the heat in her cheeks. Steven spun her round the floor like she was made of silk, guiding her across the floor without missing a beat, and in that moment Antonia truly felt graceful.
Bruce groans. “I think Steve's got more sense than that.”
So anyway, it goes like this.
he thinks. Steven takes one moment to look back to the room he’s just left, to stare at Antonia as she stokes the fire once more, the flames silhouetting her in perfect amber glory. He turns and strides out into the dark, not noticing Antonia turn to look her fill of him with a look of sadness on her face.
So, she mused, they were not to talk of their last meeting.
Eventually coming to the door of Miss Hill’s abode, she knocked and heard a bustle behind the door. She heard Miss Hill’s voice, and as she was ushered in by the maid the aunt and niece both seemed to be escaping into the adjoining room. Natasha she had a distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and before the door had shut them out, she heard Miss Hill saying “Well, my dear, I shall
"Uhm." the receptionist sweats now, beads of it rolling down his face, "uhm, I don't think I have a reservation under that name."
The weather continued much the same all the following morning, and the same loneliness and melancholy plagued Hartfield – but in the afternoon it cleared. The wind changed into a softer quarter, the clouds carried off, the sun appeared, and summer reigned again. Antonia resolved to be out doors for as much as possible. Never had the tranquility and peacefulness of her gardens attracted her more. She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce, and she joined her mother for a few turns about the garden, commenting on what needed pruning or shaping for the height of heat ahead.
"What Sam?" Steve looks up from where he is poured over his portfolio, careful that the scalding hot coffee doesn't leave any rings.
Jan had press-ganged him into. Steve is deadly gorgeous in pressed black slacks and a rumpled emerald coloured shirt that looks painted on with the top two buttons undone. Tony finds his gaze often catching on the sliver of Steve's throat that's on show, watching the rise and fall of his husband's chest with a hungry gaze. He wants to mark him, wants with a ferocious possessiveness that would frighten him if he didn't have the gold band around his finger telling him Steve was his in a forged bond as old as time.
“No.” Tony answers truthfully, watches the hurt glinting in Steven’s eyes too quick for him to mask it, “you are so much better than what I expected.”
He loves every part of Steve, he knows he does. That includes soldier Steve. He knows the reasons, the pair having flayed themselves bare to one another. Steve is a kid who had always pushed himself, thought he wasn’t going to live for long so was hell-bent on going out with a flash and bang. He hasn’t lost that side of him, the knowledge that a little pain is a good enough trade for making a difference. He is so inherently good, and he think that is why this cynical and paranoid America that has been created in the aftermath of Vietnam, of 9/11 and Iraq, just
When they stop for air, its Antonia’s turn to speak, and she does so from the warmth of Steven’s arms.
This gives Mr. Barton pause, “She. Pale – so very pale. If a young lady can ever appear to be allowed to look ill – she did so.”
“Passion? I’ll give you passion –“ Steven steps forward into Antonia’s space, one shaking hand reaching up to frame her face. The moment grows thick, draped in silence as Antonia stares into Steve’s heated eyes. Her limbs feel like jelly and she can do little but wait, biting her lip in anticipation. Steven breaks eye contact to tracks the movement, zeroing in on the now flushed skin.
" Tony barks, looking between the two employees like he was watching a tennis match, who both refuse to meet his eyes.
“They think you are …unhappy.” Fury’s voice is confused, of course it is. He’s S.H.I.E.L.D. These guys didn’t know what to do with the Man Out of Time, panicking and shoving him into a room with forties memorabilia and magazines expecting him to blow up if they so much as showed him a tube-top or Wikipedia web page. They have no clue what to do with him, his situation is unprecedented – there is no rule book, no set of guidelines or protocols and that scares the hell out of them all. They don’t understand why a man who is perfect in every physical way could possibly be suffering mentally because they see the abs and the super strength and then see photos of him before and assume he should be perfectly happy.
“How? – They were invited, were they not?”
Steven’s mouth twists something fierce, an emotion Antonia cannot name flitting across his face, and Antonia continues, “Even if he has nothing else to recommend him than being well-grown and good looking, he will be a treasure at Highbury. We do not often see fine young men, well-bred and agreeable. Mr. Hammer is proof of that.”
“I am so glad you told Mrs. Hammer you would not need her help - she really is insufferable!” Antonia began, smiling as she stoked the fire into full warmth, “And your talk of
Dusk falls around Tony’s shoulders like a shroud, sadness quick to follow. He should of taken up Rhodey’s offer of a Thanksgiving with him, but he’d stupidly thought the Stark house might have been a reprieve. Might of thought that the grades he was tracking this quarter were enough to ease the endless assault Howard waged against the son that would never be good enough. It was a horrible dance they played, Tony always striving for some form of validation from a father who did not grant it, hating himself every time he automatically sought it anyway.
“How very kind, Miss Stark. But something so very unusual has happened.” Miss Hill’s tone was giddy, and she beckoned them in quickly.
“Of course this isn’t casual. I am stupidly in love with you, you foolish man.”
put it there.
“Miss Stark! Mr. Jarvis!” they heard a voice call them from one of the windows above the market, “I was just to run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while, and give us your opinion of our new instrument! Mr Barton is already here!” she waved them up, insistence clear on her face, and Antonia could only spare a glance at Jarvis before following the summons.
When his hands
“Over there,” Tony mumbles with a slow wave, “M’think I’m gonna pass out.”
Tony keys in his own number, muttering something about how he'll have to get Steve a better model than this hunk of junk, ("An iPhone, really? We're gonna have to get you a better phone than this if we hang out more often.") before ringing his own phone once so he has the number, and handing the slim screen back to the lost for words Steve.
misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to wonder that
Clint whips round, eyes wild, “Yes, the files. The files that totally weren’t made up. The files that definitely exist, and were not just a ruse to come over here and check on your back story. No sir. Those files will be somewhere, let me just go... find.... them?” His tone kicks up into question, before he darts out. Steve mutters a curse, and wonders how Clint ever operated as a sniper.
“Oh yes, it’s quite beautiful, Natasha says. But she has decided to come visit us in Highfield instead!” Miss. Hill is overcome with enthusiasm, talking before Miss Romanov can even get a word in edgeways, “Natasha said Ireland is so very beautiful. Mr. Coulson says… what is it dear?” she asks at Natasha’s glare.
Steven huffed a laugh, and his gaze upon her was deeply fond, “Nonsensical girl.” Is all he could mutter in response, no heat behind it, and Antonia had to resist the urge to stick out her tongue.
It was a sad change. They have been meeting almost every day since his arrival. Certainly his being here had given a great spirit and whirlwind to the last two weeks. He had
There’s a moment before the IED explodes that the hairs stand up on the back of his neck, and he throws Bucky back with a force he didn’t know he possessed. He barely gets a moment between serenity and chaos to think
And it isn’t a curse word and angry shout flip out. The emotions that have been bottled up inside come loose and explode through his body. It’s a punch through the wall and screaming until his voice cracks flip out. An earth-shaking, tear the place apart flip out. Steve didn’t realise he had so much anger inside of him until he’s standing holding the debris of his rage in his hands observing the wreck he’s made of the place. So many people assume him to be calm, quiet and rational. They forget he used to be the skinny kid from Brooklyn always looking for a fight, and ready to punch his way out of each one.
I shall be happy to walk into the same room with you.”
“Very natural that you should be so grateful!” Antonia bit back her excitement, let what sense clung to her guide her still, “But, be careful. Do not let yourself get carried away with your feelings. Check your feelings while you can; do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking for you. Be observant of him. Let his behavior be the guide of your sensations. I give you this caution now, because I will never speak to you again on the subject. I am determined against all interference. Let no name pass or lips. He is your superior, no doubt, but there have been many happy and unequal marriages! But, know that I know the man in question and I approve,
“Huh? Yes. I think so. Pepper curates my art portfolio.”
Steve still, after all this time, has to resist the urge to jump every time that polite English voice speaks from around him. Tony has told him time and time again that it’s not in the ceiling, but he can’t help staring at the light fixtures when he replies.
It’s Bucky, “Hey man. I’m not here to bug you. Just wanted to run some plans Nat and I have sketched out around Stark’s systems. I think we’ve made some good progress.”
“I thank you for your concern; but I assure you that you are quite mistaken. Mr. Hammer and I are very good friends and nothing more,” she walked on, amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from partial knowledge, not well pleased with her friend for imagining her blind and ignorant, and in need of counsel. He spoke no more, and Antonia relegated his observations to obscurity, ignoring the gut feeling that had her wondering whether he was right.
Tony slaps a hand to his neck, the sound echoing round the room like a gunshot. His heart is thundering now, panic a catch in his throat. He feels Steve at the end of it, questioning and worried, and is lucid enough to push whatever reassurance he can back to his mark. Maria isn’t a threat.
The words promise something else. They sit around Tony’s shoulders like deep-seated comfort, hold him close as he watches Steve leave with a wave.
Steve? Did someone freeze you by accident? It's Tony Stark! I've got to take a photo, otherwise the guys at work will never believe it. He's much hotter in person, don't you think?"
Antonia couldn’t understand what feeling was fluttering in her breast, it was not quite excitement, almost nerves, for the heated gazes of Mr. and Mrs. Marvel on her, expectant and overwhelming. She was happy, she knew she was happy, and knew she ought to be happy. She was a little occupied in weighing up her own feelings, and trying to understand the degree of her agitation.
Pepper, for her grace, bore the admittance so very well. She refused to blame Antonia, and dismissed any moment Antonia tried to admit her shame.
“I was blind to their – attachment. I blush when I think of some of the things I said and did. But please believe me when I say that I have no other reason to regret that I did not know their secret earlier.”
Howard’s on his feet in moments, face turned to puce, “Like
strong supersoldier that can carry his weight in one hand and reach for Tony with the other, Tony would find it dreadfully dull on anyone else but his Steve) and clasps Tony’s hand in his own, grips it tightly against Steve’s cheek.
“I wonder, Miss Stark, that you are not married. For you are so charming, even if you are as stubborn as a mule.” Virginia grins as Antonia huffs a laugh in response.
It takes a lot to injure Steve.
“You think I want this life?” Tony’s voice is broken now, waves round to the room, “think I need money and dinner parties and people you think will be good for me? Steve is good for me. Have you not noticed, or enjoyed, my productivity with regards to R&D for SI has gone up 23% in the past six months?”
“My best, I would say. My best and my last.” Antonia gazed onto the portrait, “Steven would never sit for a portrait either, always vastly too busy, so I stole this from him one evening he fell asleep in front of the fire at Hartfield. The fire makes for such a warm glow across a portrait I feel. But my mother and I decided never to show him it – far too much a flatterer we felt. Too handsome – and Captain. Rogers would never let me live it down.”
thing the ball was cancelled, for she wasn’t sure the Marvels could handle such an occasion, particularly without her experience on hand!”
If he’s really quiet, he can almost feel Howard’s laughter,
“Antonia, what have you done to our Steven?” Maria queries once the doors are shut, and Antonia whirls on her with a glare.
Mr. Clint Barton was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved.
had certainly had not been in the wrong, and
“A gentleman should arrive in a horse and carriage. If the Coles, who are
The words were rushed, by the end Antonia’s face aflame as she remembered exactly what Steven was referring to, “Ah. Please.” She waved her free hand quickly, stopping his apology dead, “Please, let’s think nothing more on it.”
" Sarcasm drips from Tony's voice now.
together using the palms of his hands. He rubs them hard enough he can see stars against his eyelids, but even that won’t quiet his brain.
“I... that is. I got personal leave.” Steve’s voice is trembling like a leaf, words threadbare and soft. It’s so unlike the normally stalwart and unshakeable foundations of his Steve that Tony feels panic in his lungs.
“I need to show you something.” Steve continues when it is clear Tony is going to stay mute. He strides past Tony into the apartment, spots the phone broken on the counter and his jaw locks.
. Injured means not dead. Injured is fixable. And Anthony Stark is a fixer by trade, taking broken bolts and pulling them together. He has to believe he can fix this, because mercy have forgiveness on his soul if he can't.
“Ah!” a giggle escaped Miss Hill’s lips, whether forced or not, “You are so kind. But then you are always so kind.” The words are a whisper, and Antonia cannot hide her blush, moving forward to clasp a hand of Miss Hill’s.
He falls forward and they lay there a moment in utter silence, both unable to process the ecstasy of what they’ve just shared. Steve slides out of Tony, who whimpers in his absence, and Steve summons the energy to get up and dispose of the condom before flopping back to the bed, energy spent.
Well, more specifically, Tony’s wet room. It’s massive, the floor dark marble that slants just enough to notice into the middle of the room, the walls grey slate. Steve’s main love, though, was the rainforest shower that sprawls across the ceiling, controlled via a remote with more buttons than was strictly necessary.
“Excellent, I shall ring for the coaches. I have – taken the liberty – of bringing an extra coat. You never wrap up warm enough, Antonia.” He hands the proferred item to her, and she takes it gratefully. It’s true she only brought one extra item with her, a shawl more suited to summer than winter, but she likes the way the red brings out her eyes. Conceited to be sure, but it appears Steven knows her so well to guess her wardrobe.
“Want to spar for a bit?” she asks, the emotion she was displaying before gone and voice monotone. Steve nods, and they take up their places on the mat.
won’t ever matter when there is you.”
“You don’t have to hide the fact you are pleased that the ball is cancelled. No fake disappointment!”
Mr. Clint Barton did not come. When the time proposed drew near, Mrs. Marvel’s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse. For the present, he could not be spared, and his letter spoke at length of his “great mortification and regret”.
“Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming wife.”
Tony wishes so fucking hard that it was true.
“Can’t sleep either?” Steve asks, and is met with silence, Natasha eyeing him up, probably taking in the fact his forehead is still damp with sweat, and his eyes wild.
“Me?” Pepper colors, astonished, “why should you caution me? You cannot think I care for Clint Barton.”
The long and fine fingers carding through black hair.
“This is the luxury of a large party,” said she –“one can get near everybody, and say everything. My dear Antonia, I am longing to talk to you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how Miss Hill and her niece came here?”
“Well you’ve got the classic ‘bewitched him with his penis’ on 10/1 odds, the ‘Steve’s secretly a superhero and you are both part of a super-secret gang and the relationship is a ruse’ at 27/1 or the good old fashioned ‘Steve’s a dark horse and a secret millionaire and you met at a society dinner’ at 12/1.”
” Antonia praises as though she was praying at the altar. Steven only shakes his head.
“You speak as though you envied him.”
Their relationship errs on unhealthy according to Fury, who is angry that Steve is now wiser to the organisation-that-once-was-S.H.I.E.L.D.’s deception thanks to Tony. Angry that Tony no longer caters to curried favours in the military thanks to Steve. He doesn’t have his pawns anymore, instead only able to watch as they grow to kings on a chessboard Fury himself had set up to watch fall.
“You’ve hired prostitutes before, but not for a while, and never someone who looks so much like your perfect match. You’d be nervous, but I’m expensive and exactly what you wanted and all you’d be able to think is how you’d have paid double without a fuss for how my lips will look around your cock.”
“Would you be so kind,” said she, “when I am missed, as to say that I am gone home? I am going this moment – my aunt is not aware how late it is, nor how long we have been absent – but I am sure we shall be wanted, and I am determined to go directly. I have said nothing about it to anybody, do not want to cause distress. Till they all come in I shall not be missed and when they do, can you tell them I am gone?”
“There is no necessity for my calling this morning,” said Mr. Barton, all smiles and civility, “another day would do as well.”
Antonia was giddy with this news, and assented to his proposition of Mr. Clint Barton and Miss Potts making their party perfectly complete.
The party was rather large; and already, at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general; and while politics and Mr. Hammer were talked on, Antonia could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbor. The first remote sound she felt obliged to attend, was the name of Natasha Romanov. Mrs. Cage was telling that she had been calling on Miss Hill, and as soon as she entered the room had she been struck by the sight of a pianoforte – not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte. The end of all the dialogue which ensued was of surprise, and explanations from Miss Hill. The piano had arrived from Ireland, to the great astonishment of both Miss Hill and Miss Romanov. Utterly expected – and of course – by now – they were satisfied that it could only be from one quarter. A Mr. Murdock.
crash against his mind so much so his throat thickens with unshed tears. To think he was so close to losing this. He’s not allowed down that rabbit hole long before the light that is Steve pulls him back, curls into him and falls asleep there. He’s mesmerised watching the rise and fall of his bonds chest, lets it lull him to sleep.
Steve answers in a knee-jerk fashion because apparently his life can't get much more embarrassing, "No, I think you are gorgeous as well. I'd love to sketch you."
Having arranged all these matters in her mind, put them to right, she was just turning to the house with freshened spirits, when the great iron-sweep gate opened, and two persons she never expected to see together entered. Clint Barton, holding Pepper in his arms. The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder; they were all three soon in the hall, Clint delicately placing Pepper into the chair closest to him.
Steve can only presume ‘Pep’ is Miss Potts, since she rolls her eyes but acquiesces with a quick nod before leaving Steve utterly merciless under Anthony “Forbes number 1 of 100 under 40” Stark’s undivided attention.
Later, he would call it jealousy and Antonia would be gobsmacked that Captain Rogers was capable of such a base emotion, but that was for far later, and private conversations.
“It was something to feel that I could have stayed here forever. My regard for Hartfield,” he stepped toward her, and she could hardly draw breath, eyes wide, “Its, it is very warm.”
Now Steve’s the one swearing, “Fuck Tony, the mouth on you.” He drops his forehead to Tony’s, and the pair grin at each other, sweaty and flush. It shouldn’t be this easy, something in Steve wants to warn him. But right now, linked to Tony in a way that feels like forever, he can’t seem to care.
But tonight is different. Tonight is his own day of independence, and he’ll hold onto it with bloody fingers before anyone can take it from him. Bucky rocks his shoulder against Steve’s own as they walk through busy Brooklyn streets, “Anyone will be lucky to have ya. And if you don’t have a mark, it doesn’t matter.” He says, instead of asking Steve how he feels, because their bond is forged of brotherhood so thick he probably already knows the answer to that question. Steve feels excited and terrified all at the same time in a melting pot of nerves and delight that rocks his stomach.
I know and I'm sorry, I'm a terrible person.
“It is possible she is simply more tolerable of Highbury gossips than you are. But perhaps, she is delayed on far more pleasant business?” Steven rocks up on his heels behind her, seeming buoyed and exciteable, “I have good reason to believe your friend will soon receive wonderful news. News that you will be happy to hear.”
Nevertheless, Steve acquiesces, only because he thinks he’s not far from being able to come like this, untouched on nothing but the heavy words of Tony’s arousal. He sheaths himself, and gives his cock a few lazy swipes with lube, a proud flush sweeping up his skin when Tony makes a noise between shock and arousal, and presses forward.
not on the cards.
“Holy –“Steve doesn’t finish, sprinting across to hold the man up as he goes to fall to the ground. Lifting him into a chair, he grabs an ice pack from the freezer and holds it gently over Tony’s forehead, who winces as it’s applied.
used to sit is now covered entirely in bold, upper case letters. The words are large, blocking out the memory of what used to sprawl across Steve’s arm.
(For whilst she promises herself she isn’t a matchmaker, she can’t help a gentle nudge here or there, lest she never see her grandchildren.)
They leave together, and Tony only pauses a moment to kiss his other half desperately and try not to fly apart at the seams.
“Look at it! Isn’t it beautiful?” Steve shouts, grin so wide it nearly splits his face and he whoops with the sheer
It’s everything Steve never thought it would be, even when he let himself dream it. It’s a battle cry, it’s a call to arms. It’s every angry word left unspoken and teeth clashing and Tony swears against his mouth when Steve bites his top lip a little close to painful.
"He's got as much sense as a screen door on a submarine." Bucky deadpans, and Bruce snorts half of his beer up his nose, choking.
“No –“ Antonia laughed in response, “but I am sure there may be some opposition to his returning. Such language for a man entirely dependent on his aunt and uncle to use! Nobody but you, o’ decorated Captain and natural leader, would imagine it possible. Nobody but you could use such language and still remain in favour. You could charm the birds out of trees.”
Especially considering that Steve will never ever return those feelings. He can’t.
“Oh very well,” exclaimed Miss Hill from where she sat beside Captain Rogers, “then I need not be uneasy. ‘Three things very dull indeed’, that is tailor made for me you know. I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as I open my mouth, shant I?” said she, looking to Captain Rogers to share the self-deprecating joke. His answering smile was soft and gentle, reassuring and kind.
Antonia called on her the next day to find her doom already signed with regard to Randalls. She was exceptionally feverish, skin alight with heat and sweat, a bad throat causing her to croak every assurance that she’d be better soon. Antonia sat with her as long as she could afford, attempting to raise her spirits by insisting on how much Mr. Hammer would be depressed when he knew her state. Upon leaving, she impressed on her how awful the evening would be, how devastated Mr. Hammer would be on hearing she would not be making the evening, and how much they would all miss her.
Antonia couldn’t believe he’d seen through her as clear as glass, “Yes you are ever the pragmatist – knowing nothing of passion or ardour so great you could choke on it!” Antonia bursts out, before biting her tongue.
Steve thought of AVNG at the bottom of an out of date beer bottle. It had tasted foul, but that bitterness had made Steve stomach something even worse. Pension for a Sergeant was decent, honourable discharge making it more so, and the fanfare with which he had come home had … helped. But he couldn’t help but think of his troops who didn’t have the same. And it was that ferocious loyalty to his team that had his mind alight with ways to put their skills to use in a post-war world. Of turning the experience his team had into attractive sells to potential clients. Thus, AVNG was born. At first a baby he was fiercely protective of, now a corporate behemoth that was synonymous with security protection. And it made him burst with pride every single time someone got in touch asking for a quote.
As for Mr. Hammer, his manners did not appear – but Antonia was not surprised. He wore a sneer affixed to his face the entire meeting, like he somehow was the winner in this charade. Wedding visits were an awkward ceremony at any time, and he seemed determined to make it more so considering he was in the room at once with the woman he had just married, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had been expected to marry.
Antonia’s heart tears in two at his answer, and she cannot begin to fathom why, “This is a sudden idea, is it not?”
“I am away to London.” Steven speaks soft as though not to spook her, but awkward. It hangs on them both now, the last words that were exchanged, between the two, “Do you have anything you wish me to take?”
“Your jokes sit uncomfortably on you, sir.” Antonia retorted, “And of course I would have. There is always a look of ill-fitting when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them. You are not striving to affect some nonchalance and bravado now, for you fit the bill regardless.
“Oh do not bow Steven, it sits so poorly on you.” Antonia grinned, and rose up to bounce on her heels. Steven was the most intimate family friend she knew of. Whilst Antonia might be the lifeblood of Hartfield, Steven was very easily the unshakeable foundations that stayed unchanging throughout her life.
“Nor did I!” says Miss Hill, voice timid still in a way quite unlike the woman, “Just yesterday morning she spoke about wanting to stay for the whole summer, but by the evening she was decided. I will not know what to do without her. She will look after Mrs Smallridge’s three little girls, and the salary is… more than generous.”
“It’s not that you aren’t gorgeous and whilst I’d love to watch you get all up in my business for a bit both professionally and personally, I’m very good at what I do. I only let Pep hire you to amuse herself into thinking that the place is safer when realistically it’s as safe as it can be. I should know, I designed the place.”
Antonia looked graciously.
Tony feels like he’s standing on the edge of something. He can feel how easy it will be to fall in love with Steven Grant Rogers, how wonderful it will feel. He knows now, what philosophers speak of when they say that the bond is inevitable - like a siren song. He can’t ever imagine being able to walk around with this bond in his head and think of anything else. Aside maybe computers. Although his brain is now just an amalgamation of COMPUTERS AND STEVE with rainbows and love hearts peppering each individual thought.
