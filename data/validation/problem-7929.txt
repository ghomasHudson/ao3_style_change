And that’s, just. Well. Time may be running out and the situation is dire and so on, but there is no universe or scenario where Tony is able to ignore that, and he would defy any warm-blooded Earth mammal to do otherwise. He turns away from the panel to obviously, ostentatiously eyeball Cap.
The phrase
Tony chewed on his lower lip, rapidly flipping between scans, trying to make sense of the systems he was seeing, the ways they interacted. “Probably not? Maybe a rental, once?”

“Steve! You simply
“Yeah, it’s real
Steve always finds it a little difficult to go from fighting all-out in the streets to the delicate dance of high-stakes socialization within the space of a couple hours. Thor only has one mode, which he deploys with gusto on the battlefield or in a ballroom, and Hank is terrible at social events even if he’s had all day to prepare for them. But Steve likes to think he’s not so bad at this sort of glad-handing meet-and-greet normally—he did an awful lot of it in the war, after all. And now he doesn’t even need to feel like a hypocrite:
He shut the external speakers down and yelled into the comms even as he pulled his gauntlet out of the ship, twisting and turning to not knock anything loose as it went until it came clear of the hull and he could—fuck, he’d made a kind of big hole in the side of the ship. Probably it wasn’t going to fly with that. “Capsicle! Get your All-American ass back over here, we are good to
, it was obvious that they’d been seen, and in fact a moment later heavy rounds tore through a ship one row in front of them. Tony ducked and swore, trying to keep from jostling the gauntlet he had jammed into the side of the ship. Everything would have been 10,000 times easier if he could have interfaced directly by way of the Extremis, but whatever systems the Vog’ila had going on, they weren’t talking to him. There was code and programming there, but it was barely recognizable as such, and he had no chance of learning the language, syntax, or even the basic underlying logic of it under these particular circumstances.
“Well, we made it off the planet,” Cap said. “Let’s just—”
“Two hours until we have to leave for the gala,” Wasp reminds them as they clatter into the Mansion’s foyer. Jarvis stands nearby with a mop and bucket and an extremely disapproving expression directed at the spots where Thor is dripping acid onto the hardwood flooring. “Stragglers
Clearly Tony is not going to drop this until he gets some kind of answer. Steve looks down; taking his gaze momentarily off of Tony is the only way he can think clearly enough to form a complete sentence. “If you—you could. You could. If you wanted to, to… to do that. To me. I wouldn’t, uh. I wouldn’t be opposed.”
He carries the chestplate to the bow and sets it down on one of the seat-things near the control panels. Conditions there are so bright that he can’t even raise his head to look directly out the window, and the control panels are functionally useless, the lights and colors on their surfaces bleached to nothing by the overpowering blaze of light.
,” Tony says, putting a theatrical leer into it. It works. Cap sits up a little straighter and smiles in a way that indicates he’s tracking a bit more closely than he was before. Tony unwinds the flexistraw and wordlessly holds out the pouch again.
“Already had one, this one’s all you.”
,” Tony drawls, and then he’s crawling onto the bed, over Steve, laying him out flat on his back. He knocks Steve’s hands to the sides, and then it’s Tony’s clever fingers undoing buttons and tugging at fabric, kneeling up to maneuver Steve however he needs to until it’s skin on skin and Steve is panting and shivering, nearly overcome just by the sight of Tony’s hand somewhere on his body.
Tony keeps rubbing Steve’s back.  Steve times his breathing to the circles. He can almost feel his body trying to tighten back up, to push Tony out, but the more he focuses on his breathing, the easier it is to deliberately relax. After a while Tony pushes forward again, curling down until his forehead is pressed to Steve’s back and he’s flush with Steve’s ass. “God,” he groans. A warm feeling surges through the pit of Steve’s stomach. He’ll do just about
Of course Cap doesn’t move. His misplaced sense of comradery won’t let him retreat to a slightly darker part of the ship while Tony can’t do the same.
“No trophies,” Steve says firmly. Thor sighs, drops the centipede fragment and starts to wade out of the crater. The creature’s acid doesn’t seem to be having any effect on his skin, but the leather of his uniform is in fact smoking slightly, and the metal fittings are starting to take on a cloudy, etched look. Well, if it gets bad before they get back to the Mansion, Steve supposes he can always call up a rainstorm.
Tony smiled, his heart pounding in his chest, thinking he’d rip his own lungs out and hand them over on a silver platter if that’s what Steve asked him to do.  “Sure,” he said.  “We’ve got to have room for all our kids, don’t we?”
He was just excited.  And maybe a little nervous.
,” Steve said now.  “What if I trip or something?”
Steve’s not like that, Tony thought.  He means it.  He’d never say it if he didn’t mean it.
“I know.”
no,” he exclaimed. “
Sam laughed. “If you’d asked a year ago, she probably would have said no. But now? Yeah, Steve. She thinks so.”
“My god, you are so beautiful,” Tony mused. Steve flushed with both embarrassment and happiness, and Tony chuckled softly. “Oh, I know,” he said, running his hand gently over Steve’s face--his cheek, his chin, his mouth. “I know you get a little...flustered when I say that, but baby, my god. My god, I have
Steve knew it was bait, but he didn’t take it. He just shrugged instead. “It’s been a long time,” he said, then smiled a little at Tony. “Maybe he forgot me.”
“Yeah. Guess so.”

There was only one time when Steve lost his temper during one of these encounters.

Tony switched the cat from one shoulder to the other.  The cat allowed the manhandling with no fuss, just letting Tony maneuver it any way he wanted, all the while gazing into his face with enraptured green eyes.
“What are you accusing her of?” Nat asked.
“Sam.” And he was still crying, tears still falling, but just hearing Sam’s voice made it a little better.
He knew his mother worried about him, worried that he didn’t have enough friends, but he told her he was fine, and she believed him. Or at least she pretended she believed him. And that was almost the same thing anyway.
“Guess you boys had better stick to hand-holding, then,” Nat quipped.  “Unless you like being watched.  Then, have at it, right, Thunderbolt?”
She smiled fondly.  “I remember, dear.  Maybe you should cartwheel home.”
Tony’s eyes were before? Why did it feel like he was seeing them for the very first time?
prison, Nat.”
But he didn’t. He stayed awake instead. Just holding Steve, just touching him, just watching over him while he slept. Just being with him. Knowing that he wouldn’t see him again for a long time, he didn’t want to waste a single second of
One year.
“I was home a couple weeks ago.”
“Don’t worry,” Tony soothed, kissing his spot until Steve sighed.  “I wouldn’t dream of insulting your precious Brooklyn.”
You know, Steve, his
Steve held him tighter. Kissed his shoulder. “I missed you too.”
He ignored the paleness of Steve’s skin.  The high-strung, jittery way he scratched his knee, the restless movement of his eyes.
“Guys!” Sam said loudly.
“Do you, Mr. Stark?  Do you, really?”
“Thanks.”
He took a few steps toward the building.  It looked like it had once held cut logs and machinery.  Tony didn’t think it held anything now.  Except the lingering scent of lumber and machine oil.  Maybe a family of raccoons or skunks.  Maybe a few ghosts, too.  There could be some of those.
Howard took a step toward him. Tony stood his ground. He wasn’t afraid of his father, he never had been, and if he was being truthful--really, honest-to-god truthful--the times Howard stepped menacingly toward him were some of his
“No. I’m okay.”
“I was going to offer to buy you a drink,” the guy said in a slightly lower voice. “But you’ve had three since coming in.”
Steve’s eyes said plainly.
Steve stared at him with half-crazed eyes. "Take
“It’s a thank-you.  For activating the protocol that night.”
“What do you need to know?”
“Do you think you can do that?” Nat asked.
“Does that mean you’re dreaming, or I am?”
“Yeah.  I liked it, too.”
Tony twirled his hand vaguely.  “I told you, the spitting.  It’s very off-putting.”
long time since he had been with anyone. That the last one had been a three-night stand right after he and Pietro called it quits, and that his first--his
Tony squeezed his knees together against Steve’s, trapping him.  “I remember,” he said dismissively.  “Anyway, you apologized.  Do you believe that?
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony squeezed him tight and buried his head into Steve’s chest. “I love you, baby.”
He waited for an agonizing length of time that was probably only five minutes before Steve messaged him back.
On Wednesday, he was stocking shelves when his boss came over to him. Steve was kneeling on the floor. He wasn’t stocking tomatoes this time--it was boxes of cereal--but he was still reminded of the day months ago when Tony had come and stood over him just the way his boss was doing now.
To that end, he walked down the hall, but stopped short of his own bedroom door.  He opened the one that used to be Steve’s, and now was no one’s, but it was the last place in the Tower they had been together.  The last place where they had made actual, physical love together, and Tony wanted to keep that memory with him, keep it close to him, to give him strength until tomorrow when he would see Steve in the flesh again.
“Factory direct it would do zero to sixty in 5.8 seconds.  It topped out at 155.”  Tony cocked his head.  “But I tinkered.”
Sam rolled his eyes again. “Yeah. I know all about you and him,” he said.
“I love you, too. Get here soon, okay?”
“Who was the other man?” Steve asked, and Ross smiled cruelly.
“All four of us in bed, huh?” he asked, cocking an eyebrow. “Sounds like a pretty full house.”
Tony looks genuinely startled. Whatever he thought Steve might say, it clearly wasn’t that. “What on earth are you apologizing for? You did
“If I’d
“Are you—”
“Oh, give it here,” Iron Man sighs, staticky through the helmet’s filters. He holds a gauntlet out to the Wasp, who hesitates, then pulls a small vial from a pouch on her belt and hands it over.

,” Cap says, and he was already a little pink in the cheeks from the heat, but Tony is willing to bet that if he looks back again, Cap will have gone bright red.
He only realizes that Tony is maneuvering him when the backs of his knees hit the edge of his bed and he sits down with a hard
“Absolutely
“I’d like that,” Steve says, softly.
He pulls the entire bundle out of the wall, careful to not disconnect anything, and starts rapidly carving notches into the protective sheathing of each wire in the group. He’s making some assumptions about alien psychology here, but he is guessing that all the cables within a given bundle are responsible for things in the same system. If he’s right, and he can patch them all into the reactor, he should be able to power enough of the ship’s propulsion and basic steering/navigation to get them the hell away from this sun.
Cap is bare to the waist, with about 20 acres of pale smooth skin on display. He still has his uniform pants on, tragically, but he’s also still wearing his thick leather belt, which is not at all a bad look. As promised, his broad shoulders and many, many abs are streaked with shining lines and dapples of sweat. The rise and fall of his absurdly oversized pectorals is even more obvious than usual because he’s breathing a little heavy in the heat and jesus holy fuck Tony cannot be looking at this right now.
Tony allows this clumsy treatment for a few moments, then steps in closer, sliding his hands up to cradle Steve’s face. He tilts Steve’s head until he can press their lips together, gently at first and then with stronger pressure. He draws Steve’s lower lip into his mouth and applies just the lightest touch of teeth.
“Yes, great, thanks, hilarious.” Tony shoots him a poisonous look. “I’m in the middle of escaping from a hostile alien planet in a stolen spaceship and now I’m going to die a horrible death with Captain America making bad jokes at me. I know I’ve lived a life of sin, but you could cut me a
He’s actually not entirely sure that the plate will stay wearable once he powers the reactor up. He’s trying to get close to 100% of the bundle attached, which is an awful lot of alien cabling. Since he doesn’t know what the exposed wiring is made of, he doesn’t know its conductivity, its resistance, what corrodes it, anything. There is a non-zero chance that the whole thing melts to slag after it’s been turned on for a minute or two.
. But once he worked out how to pry up the paneling, it’s easy enough to pull each section, make a very crude splice, feed in a little power from the suit, and watch what lights up. Not complicated. Just time-consuming.

They both straightened back up and ran harder.
“Don’t snark, you’re getting off with light duty here. Usually I’m looking for an assist getting
He resists the urge to check the connections one last time. By now they’re either fine or they aren’t, but either way there’s nothing more he can do. He peels himself up off the floor, grimaces as his legs twinge painfully, staggering a little under the weight of the chestplate as a result. There’s definitely a wet spot on the floor where he sweat through the undersuit. This is not his finest hour, aesthetically speaking.
“Miss Maximoff has incapacitated all guards and Mr. Wilson successfully penned the dogs away.  The only heat signature left belongs to Secretary Ross.  He’s in his bed.  Third floor, second door at the top of the stairs.
“Perks of the job,” he said, when she brought his juice. She was right--he’d had nothing but coffee this morning, and the sweetness of it cramped his taste buds in a delightful way.
“Almost a year ago now.”
That half-smile.  Those big blue eyes from under his lashes.  “Fuck you.”
“I missed you.”
Steve blinked and shifted.  A pink blush had crept onto his cheeks.  His blue eyes found the door, planning his escape.  Tony was both hurt and relieved.
He shook his head without lifting it from his backpack. There wasn’t really much in there. Tony had gone through it a couple times looking for a piece of gum or a pencil, so he knew it was pretty sparse in there, but Steve was prospecting around inside it like he was looking for gold nuggets. “Nah,” he said. “We shouldn’t anyway. Mrs. Perkins is usually home this time of day, and she’s pretty nosy. She’d probably call my mom at work just to ask her who I had brought home with me.”
The thigh plates are farther aft; he shed them earlier, before he realized that the panels he needs are closer to the front. His footfalls are loud. Why are they so loud? Because he’s still wearing the boots, right.

go rusting yourself up. You’ve got to put in an appearance tonight too, you know!”
said he wasn’t going to think about it, does that look like not thinking about it?
“I don’t—I mean, yes. But it felt like you did all the work,” Steve mutters. He’s looking at Tony’s mouth to avoid looking Tony in the eye, so he has a front row seat when Tony leans in further and presses a light kiss to his lips.
“Sorry to corner you, but I wanted to check in. You took some hits earlier today. And you looked like you were moving kind of stiff all night.” Tony slouches against the door a little more. “You have that bad habit of walking off an injury without telling anyone about it.”
Tony shakes his head. “I could go back to my room to get some, but I really can’t abide the thought of running into one of the others in the hall right now—or, god forbid, Jarvis. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but no, I guess we’re going without. I am definitely buying you a huge box after this, though, so you’re ready for the next person who comes around. You can’t just take people on their say-so these days, and even if a woman is on birth control, no birth control is 100% effective.”
. He blinks up at Tony, who grins at him and shrugs his jacket off, tossing it over the back of Steve’s armchair. He slows down to undo his cufflinks, looking thoughtfully at Steve. Steve can’t look away, the practiced motions of Tony’s hands opening his cuffs suddenly imbued with a kind of promise that makes his gut clench in anticipation. He blindly reaches up and pulls the undone bowtie out of his collar, then worries it distractedly between his hands.
“There is literally no way you could have anticipated any of this,” Tony snaps, cutting him off. “Half your fighting strategy instantly ruled out by a quirk of alien architecture? The fact that their planet is subject to ion storms, which cut off the portal signals? We successfully steal a ship but it dies as soon as we clear the planet? Come the fuck on.”
you are!” she trills. “We were about to send out a
and holds the cloths up out of the way until Steve subsides. He wipes Steve down briskly and efficiently, only occasionally detouring for a light grope. He very plainly knows what he’s doing, which reminds Steve that Tony has done this many times before, which makes him feel—well, there’s no use thinking about it. He’s here, at least for tonight, and right now he gets to be the one enjoying the result of Tony’s years of practice and study.
The chestplate is flipped over, the inside layer that normally rests against his body exposed. The padding’s in a hundred pieces all over the floor. If he has to wear this armor again, as he inevitably will-- assuming he doesn’t blow them both up-- it’s going to suck. He has the back casing off the reactor so he can connect as many cables as possible to it.
“Code names, Giant Man,” Steve says. “You’re on an open comm, please—”
Three 10-foot-tall aliens armed to the teeth (did they even have teeth?) versus one Captain America armed with a single shield, and he’d fought them to a stalemate. Tony swung up into the hatch, holding onto the edge of the door with a gauntlet still hot from the welding. He felt like laughing hysterically. Why the fuck not? One squishy human in a homemade tin can and he’d hacked their stupid ship, under fire, why the hell
“Well hello there,” Tony murmurs. His grip on Steve’s jacket tightens slightly.
Tony nudges Steve with the point of his elbow. “Once more unto the breach. Come on, Cap, I could use the back-up.”
Tony shrugs. “Too cheesy? Well, it’s not untrue, anyway.”
“Can you--?”
“I rejoice to see you well, good Captain!” Thor booms. Squinting, Steve can just about make him out high in the sky, silhouetted against the late afternoon sun. He still can’t see the centipede, but he can hear it smashing into buildings and vehicles around the corner somewhere.
“I did.”
the same,” Tony says, but he’s starting to smile a little bit again.
“Yes it’s bad,” Tony hissed. He bent over the control panel, trying to will it to make sense. “We might be able to escape it if we really open up the engines, we’re still pretty far out, but we need to get moving now.”
“So you have this, which I guess you use for its intended medicinal purposes.” Tony hefts Steve’s bottle of clear aloe, which he does in fact use for scrapes and burns. “It’ll do, although really, there are better products out there, I’ll make you a list. But unless you’re hiding them very, very well, there’s not a condom to be seen in this suite, which I have to admit is a little concerning.”
Tony keeps two fingers pressing into the very base of Steve’s spine, stroking lightly over the flat planes of his back with the other hand, every so often encountering a tender spot, bruised from the fight earlier. It’s firm pressure and light touches and unpredictable little sparks of pain; the counterpointed sensations make it hard to focus on anything else. Somewhere in there is the click of a bottle cap, and then a finger is petting cold and wet against him, just stroking over his opening, back and forth, until Steve goes limp against the bed. Only then does Tony push, one smooth motion to get his finger in Steve up to the last knuckle. He gives Steve just a moment to adjust before he starts moving, fucking his finger in and out.
Tony looked up, confused. “Huh?”
than it used to. Steve stops worrying about what his body is doing, whether or not his cock is leaking, whatever sounds he might be making. Tony is working at him with three fingers by the time he’s really aware again, and then it’s only because Tony pulls them all the way out. He whines a little in protest.
it’s all in places my gown will cover. The creature’s down, it’s not getting back up, I am
“No, no, the tailoring is fine. You leave those people alone, they had to make the whole thing practically from scratch on short notice.” Steve should be batting Tony’s hands away from where they’ve come to a stop, lightly holding Steve’s lapels about halfway up, but he can’t seem to make his own limbs cooperate. “It’s just. It still feels a little funny to wear one, you know? The uniform, I’m used to that. And modern civilian clothing is like having pajamas on. But a proper suit… it just wears different.”
Steve swallows hard. This is really,
to hear Cap say things like “you’re not an Avenger” in that calm, matter-of-fact voice he uses to state Great Truths.
No matter the reason, he’s jittery, and that doesn’t help at these kinds of events. The tuxedo fits perfectly—of course it does, he went to Tony’s guy—but it still feels constrictive through the arms and shoulders in a way that his uniform, with all its protective padding and mail, never does. He tries to make small talk with the people who approach him, to remember who sits on the board of which cultural institution, to act suitably impressed at the scope of some wealthy person’s collecting habits, and to smile in all the right spots. But it feels like his timing is off, his answering quips a beat too slow. Everyone is perfectly polite in return, but eventually people find someone more socially adept to talk to, and Steve gets to stand by himself near an empty counter and sample the appetizers every time a caterer passes by.

sexual. Purely sexual. He stroked it with his thumb, teasing the inner seam of his jeans high up his leg. “No,” he said, like Steve had disagreed with him. “No, we’ll leave early. And Morgan can go home with Auntie Nat and Uncle Bucky, and Dodger can go home with Grandma Sarah--who should come to the party too, by the way. She and Sam and Wanda. And Dodger. Oh, fuck yes,

“I can’t,” he’d said that morning when Natasha reminded him. His eyes had cut to Tony standing at the counter with a cup of coffee in his hand. Tony had been checking emails on his tablet, but he had discovered if he positioned his glasses just right, he could still see Steve without it looking like he could see him. It was just one of the tricks he used to keep tabs on his not-as-friendly-as-he-used-to-be friend.
And stopped.
Tony’s fingers were cold in his, but they turned and clasped Steve’s.  “But I
Tony pictured him sitting at his desk, his tie loosened a little, wearing a white lab coat.  He was probably at home in the Sanctum in jeans and a hoodie, but the white coat image made it easier for Tony, so that’s what he went with.
They ate at a pleasant steakhouse, then said good-bye to her folks at the door.  Tony kissed the mother’s cheek, and shook the father’s hand.  Gina said she’d see them later, then she led Tony away, deeper into Manhattan while the parents went back to Long Island.
Bruce came from behind the car--nothing fancy, just an older-model Prius, nothing like Rhodey’s Lexus or Tony’s gas-guzzling, gorgeous old Bentley.  Tony grabbed him in a bear-hug and Bruce looked both shocked and pleased.  Tony released him, grabbed his face in his hand and said, “What did I do without this face, huh?  You’re so cute, I could eat you up.”
Steve kissed him one more time, just a soft brush of his lips, then he stood up. He grabbed his jacket from the back of the desk-chair where he had thrown it, and slipped it on. He went to the pile of their clothing and toed into his shoes and picked up his bag. He didn’t come back for another kiss. Another hug. He stood straight, unconsciously at attention, his back a hard upright line.
"I know," he answered without quite meeting her eyes.
“Really?”
“Nah.  The last one was...four days ago, I guess.  The night after we left Wakanda.”
“Rogers?” Mr. Barker. At the door. “Are you alright?"
“Tony,” Steve called.
“Steve, this is Sir Purr.  Sir Purr, this is Steve.”
“Good.”
Tony pulled the bandage he was wrapping around Steve’s hand tight.  Steve hissed in pain and Tony loosened it again.  “Sorry.”
“Then keep her under control, Nick.”
“Very good.  Better than I remember.”
That last one most of all.
dare go that far just yet.
“Nat remembers, too.  Don’t you?”
“Yeah,” Tony said. “Do you want to? I want to. If that’s okay? I get it if you’re mad and don’t want to, but I want to. I want to see you. I kind of need to see you. Please? Steve? Please?”
Steve chewed his bottom lip.  He didn’t meet Tony’s eyes, kept his own cast down.  He didn’t pull away from Tony’s touch, but did not respond to it, either.  “You left me there,” he said in a voice that was barely even audible.  “At that hospital.  You left me there.  After you
Tony reached out and brushed a hand over Steve’s shoulder. The suit was perfect, not a wrinkle or spot in sight, but Tony could pretend. He needed some kind of excuse, a reason to touch him. When he did, he was miraculously able to breathe again. Like all his body had been waiting for was that contact. That touch. “Look at you,” he whispered, then cocked an eyebrow, gazing up into Steve’s blue, blue eyes. “I guess I can look now, anyway,” he said. “You seem to be fully clothed this time.”
He wanted to make him work for it.
Steve shook his head.
it had my security!”--Steve still found himself looking for them, checking their whereabouts, tracking their movements throughout the room. Clint lounged in the corner, his feet up on the table. Beside him, Laura bounced a baby on her knee, her pretty face alight and dazzled by the room around her. Rhodey stood nearby with a trio of ladies in low-cut dresses, a drink in his hand. Natasha was MIA for the moment and Sam had an emergency with one of his friends at the VA so he couldn’t make it to the party. On the dancefloor, Wanda and Vision twirled in a technically perfect but somewhat uninspired waltz. Steve smiled as Wanda grabbed Vision’s shoulders and gave them a brisk shake before placing his hands on her waist. The implications were clear: loosen up, you, and just dance.
“I’m glad you brought us,” Tony said softly.
“You’re right,” he whispered earnestly.  “I do love it.”
“But instead, I think I’m going to take a page out of the Steve Rogers Playbook.”
“Okay.  Well, thank you for giving
There was a knock on the door behind them, and Pepper smoothed her ponytail.  “That’s the deli.  Wait here.  Don’t touch anything.”
“We’ve fought aliens and people claiming to be gods, but this is the strangest thing to ever happen to one of us,” Steve said while staring at the plant he had placed on the kitchen table. It wasn’t very large, mostly consisting of a thorny stem that made Steve glad of his thick gloves and a few battered leaves. With a frown Steve nudged the improvised pot over so the plant could catch a bit more of the afternoon sunlight.
“Wha—?” Tony spluttered, because that didn’t make sense, he needed coffee, he'd die without coffee. Only he didn’t get to tell Steve that because Steve fucking smiled.
“Now, how did the circuit board turnout?” Jarvis asked in a bid to distract the boy.
“I guess not.” Steve slid back over to Tony, closer than he was sitting before.
"What"
“For luck,” he mumbled as he struggled not to blush. Maybe he was pushing it too far too soon, He wasn’t sure how serious Tony was about all this. He turned to escape before Tony could razz him too badly for it.
There were more seeds, but unsurprisingly the birds had found them and were stuffing them into their beaks. Every single one Tony could see from the shelter of the tall grass was snapped up before he dared to dart out and get it. Finally he found a pile of them closer to the house that the birds hadn’t even touched.
[Sir, if I may, perhaps you should check the shoes you left sitting in the southwest corner of the room.]
“We must rectify this situation at once!” Thor said.
"I know, I've been filmed before."
“Well, I didn’t think Captain America was in the market for a sugar daddy.” Sam bumped Steve’s shoulder.
[Dr. Lyn should be arriving within the hour. It appears the delay is due to an accident on 23
(See the end of the chapter for
“Literally no one in this place would survive without coffee, so what do you think?” Tony said before he took a huge gulp from his cup.
The hot skin was red and swollen. Jarvis immediately took Tony over to the sink to run it under cold water. Tony squirmed a little, but didn’t protest.
"No, I agree with the stylists on this one, your usual look doesn't project 'fire safety' nearly as well."
“No arguments here, I’m just glad it wasn’t me.” Clint shrugged sheepishly, but his easy demeanor didn’t quite reach his eyes.
“Please let me see young master,” Jarvis requested, gently pulling the injured hand closer.
Small red flowers dotted ends of the plant where the branches bent towards Steve. It was a good sign, it had to be, Steve thought as he brushed the tiny blossoms with his finger.
“Then why would I think any less of you?”
“That’s not true. You’re one of the best men I know. Do you think I would have fallen for you otherwise?”
“St...eve...?” Tony’s eyes fell shut.
Tony probably should have been happier to see Steve without a stitch of clothing on him, but the whole being stuck on a raft in the middle of who knew where was really taking its toll. He hadn’t even been conscious when Steve had stripped and pushed them away from the burning wreckage of their plane.
“What about you? Why are you so relaxed, Skipper? Planes don’t just crash, especially my planes.”
Tony is recovering from a broken leg and Steve brings him a crepe.
"Then what did you-- wait, collection?" Steve's eyebrows were doing the adorable scrunchy thing they did when he got confused.
“If you don’t want to be hugged, you don’t have to make it weird, just say so.”
“I don’t need to,” he replied. “I know when I’m needed.”
“I don’t like the water, okay?”
So he did what he did best: he invented something new. Binarily Augmented Retro Framing was the culmination of years of research, all the efforts of scientists across the world, brought together by him. It was dazzling, alluring, and painful, those migraines were no joke. It was like he was really there, changing history. That’s what it felt like anyway.
“Steve.”
Then there was a shout.
The Winter Soldier paced like a caged animal, somehow exuding a sense of danger despite his slim frame. As he watched from behind the one way glass, Tony had no doubt that small body was strong enough to snap his neck if the owner so chose. How could he, when that predatory glare directed towards the door made it so clear?
Steve found the release for the helmet and carefully removed it. Tony’s face was flushed with a thin sheen of sweat. His breathing was harsh and raspy, while his normally well-groomed beard had several days worth of growth. He looked up at Steve with unfocused eyes.
, and will catch anything before it gets to that point.” Clint looked at Steve forcefully, he was just as forcefully not looking at the planter next to Steve.

Tony was frozen in shock. Somehow Tony had gone from being apologized to, to being forgiven without even doing anything and now there was hugging. With a quick squeeze, the man let go.
Hug #5
Written for the one word prompt: sea
Steve sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. “Never mind, I’m the one that’s around the tower the most, I’ll handle it from now on.”
She rolled her eyes at him.  “You’re so cute.  I’ll have some fruit later, okay, Dad?”
Strange sipped his coffee.  “I love it, too.  Now that I’ve made it workable.”
Steve laughed quietly. “Both, I guess,” he said, and tipped his head to kiss him again. Just a short kiss. A soft one. “And for helping me. I really wouldn’t have gotten that grade without you. It’s all ‘cause of you. I’m serious.”
Steve looked at him from under lowered lashes, smiling again.  “Well, we don’t know each other that well.”
“I’m sure he didn’t think that.”
“Mmm. I love it when you say ‘forever’.”
“Nah,” Bucky said.  “Mary Sue McCarthy called me that sometimes.”
Tony came back to the cabin.  “I can get you a drink once we’re airborne,” he said.  “Jerry won’t let me have anything before.  He says it’s ‘disruptive’ knowing I’ve got a bottle before take-off.”
Tony giggled, clasping his knees tight around Steve’s slim hips. The drag against his cock was almost unbearable. “She might be. I might have to work up to her.”
Tony stood by the door. His hand was behind him, resting on the knob. Steve wasn’t sure if he’d locked it or not. He supposed it didn’t really matter. It wasn’t like they were going to fall into each other’s arms. That was over. That part of what they’d been was gone. Just looking at Tony’s desk solidified that. Looking at the photos there. The photos of his daughter. His wife. His family.
camp that night or the next.”
And that wasn’t fair. To Tony or to him. But that was his fault too, wasn’t it? He should have told him. He should have given him the promises he’d asked for. Steve had felt it back then. Had always felt it. Was afraid he would always feel it, no matter what. But it was too late. Wasn’t it? There was no way Tony still loved him. Three years--six, really, discounting their one-night stand--was a very long time. Especially when you’re young. Especially when you don’t really understand how fast time goes by, or how precious it is. How easy it is to lose everything you have in the blink of an eye.
“Yeah,” Tony said.  “After everything.  Besides, it’s better than the convalescent home Strange picked out.”
Howard nodded, and this time the look on his face was something else entirely. Steve could have sworn it looked like pride. “I’m sure you do, Steven.”
“Why’d you call him?” he asked, and Steve sighed, a sound of pure resignation that hurt Tony’s heart and put his hackles up.
“You gotta stay somewhere,” Tony said.  “This is just as much your place as it is mine.”
Steve nodded.
“Yeah, FRI?”
He put his arm around her, used the other hand to scuff Dodger’s fur, trying to ease him as much as his mother. “It’s okay, Mom,” he said, unable to keep the hint of laughter out of his voice. “Really.”
Steve returned it.
Tony grunted and held on stubbornly tight. “Not yet,” he said. “I think I need this for a few more minutes first.”
Tony let out a harsh breath. “This sucks.”
He wouldn't get eight years.
He sighed and closed his eyes.  “You don’t have to fight, Nat.”
Tony squatted down on his haunches in front of him. “Hey,” he said quietly. He reached out, and Steve flinched.
He nodded.  “Okay.  United we stand, I guess.”
“I will, though, Tony, okay?” Steve said, and now he put his own arms around Tony and held him tight. So, so tight. “I will. I promise. I’ll let go. I’ll try and stop loving you. Just not tonight. Okay? Okay, Tony? Can I have one more night? One more night where I can go to sleep thinking there might be a chance for us?”
“What do
Because Tony loved Howard too.
.  Besides, I can take care of myself.”
“He’s coming.  Sam went to get him.”
"You feel so good. God, Tony, so
Steve shifted on the cot, his sleeping face lost in worry.
There had been a fight. A
Steve pulled closer, draping one arm heavily over Tony’s hip.  There was no hesitation, no deliberation, just that smooth movement to close the distance between them, then the warmth of him, the smell of him--aftershave, soap, the more subtle scent of the outdoors, all clean and healthy--and the weight of him enveloping Tony.  He’d only been waiting for permission, it seemed, waiting to see if Tony was ready or willing to share that more intimate space again.  Tony was both.
A flash of righteous anger flared in Steve’s stomach. His fists clenched tighter. “Do you mean
“Me neither.”
When oxygen-deprived stars blurred his vision, Steve shut the water off and stumbled out of the stall.  He wrapped a towel around his waist then leaned against the sink, staring at his reflection.  The clear, high brow, the blue eyes, the blonde hair.
She looked away, troubled, and he thought he knew what it was.  There was only one thing that could make her look like that.  He waited.
SEPTEMBER, THURSDAY 3:00 PM
another shoe.  Is there?”
don’t you own a cell-phone again? Phone sex has gotten way more effective since the dawn of the video-age.”
“We tried that, Stephen,” he said levelly.  “I’m sure you recall.”
“Yeah, baby.”
Tony shook his head, scrubbed a hand through his hair.  “I don’t know, you guys.  What the fuck?  He’s fine one minute, he’s...whatever the next.”  He sighed.  “I’m trying not to freak out, but honestly?  I’m freaking out.  Hard.”
❤️❤️❤️
Steve, look at them.”
“Don’t care,” he answered.  “I
“No, this has got to happen now,” he said.
eye. They caught them again now, and pinned him in place
He fell back, blood spurting, and Tony scooted out from under him, shoving with his heels, clawing with his fingers.  Breath whooped into his mouth, burning his throat and lungs in the most divine way imaginable.
“That was nice of him.”
He clapped his hands together and gold, glowing discs appeared around them.  He held out his hands, and it was as if reality crumbled away around them, leaving a hole in the fabric of the world.  Where the pleasant, sleek sofa had been a moment before, there was now a one-bunk prison cell.  It was dark, cold, and lonely with only a toilet, a sink, and a bed.  It was framed in gold, but the prettiest thing, the most beautiful, glorious, perfect thing, was sitting on the bunk staring at them.
“I wasn’t going to work,” Tony scoffed. “I was just going to get bagels.”
“All night?”
.  Not Nat or Sam or Wanda.  Tony gripped that knowledge and held onto it tightly, his knuckles white with force.
?” He laughed, and Steve smiled at how happy he sounded. “Anyway, I’ll see you Thursday, okay? I lo...um. Is this Mrs. Rogers listening to this, or Steve? If it’s Mrs. Rogers, hi! If it’s Steve, we should probably come up with a code word for ‘I love you’. Maybe if I say ‘buffalo’ or ‘mitosis’ or something then you’ll know what I mean so we don’t embarrass your mom.” Steve smiled again. “So, anyway, buffalo. See you Thursday.”
“No.”
Then Nat was there beside him.  She put her hand on his arm.  Her eyes were frank and hard.
“Yes.  But I have to give you your present first,” she said, and bit his earlobe.
Steve looked up from his books, frowning a little. “Who called your house again last night?”
But someone in the family needed to know where he was.  Why he was gone for so long with no word.  Someone needed to know in case Ross decided to take this matter into his own hands and do something more extreme than mere imprisonment.  Steve didn’t think it would come to that.  He thought Ross liked the idea of Captain America in his pet prison just a little too much to want to end it early.  Steve could hear the phantom-Tony who sometimes spoke in his head say,
52 weeks.
“Give me your com-set.  I’ll go find Stark.  Stay with him.”
His hands tried to move to grasp Tony’s, but he resisted. He couldn’t touch him. If he did, this would be over. He’d give in. He’d do whatever Tony wanted, and the second that happened, he would be lost. And so would Tony. Steve would drag him down with him instead of letting him fly, and he couldn’t do that. He wouldn’t. “I don’t want us to make any promises,” he said. “If we don’t make any promises, then neither of us can break one.”
“Did you?” Steve asked, gazing up at him from under his lashes again, and how could he look so sexy and so innocent at the same time? Tony wondered.
“Please, Tony.  I want you to.”
Tony felt like throwing up.
Steve grinned, looking down at his shoes. Behind him, one of the servers shouted, “Rogers! Still on break, or what?”
of making. He hoped Tony knew that. Hoped he recognized those tags for what they were--a placeholder for something else. Something more permanent.
“Baby?  You awake?”
Steve turned his face away from the offending light, but untangled his hand from Tony’s shirt and patted his leg with it.  It felt like an awkward, silly thing to do, but if Tony had a problem with awkward and silly, he would have left him by now.
A few days later, Steve had come home from school and shopping, his arms filled with books and bags and pizza because he had another essay to write by Monday, and Tony had kept him up until four a.m. that morning doing things to him that were unspeakably dirty and unspeakably good, and now he was exhausted, and his outline was due tomorrow, and he wasn’t even halfway through it, and...and now there was a big yellow cat sitting on the kitchen counter staring at him with flat, green eyes.
She shrugged. “Just different.”
“So, let’s not bring other people into it,” Steve said.
“No,” Tony said, the word coming out on a breath that was nearly laughter.  “Baby, you should have assumed.  Hell,
He shook his head. “I thought you could show me.”
Tony shook his head without lifting it.  “Nothing.  I just want to remember, that’s all.”
as Steve. But it wasn’t only that. It was the sweetness that he exuded. The lusciousness of his character. The generosity of his spirit. Tony wanted to bathe in it. Sink down into it. Swim in it. Drown in it.
“Yeah, he is.”
A wave of “What the fuck was that?” ran through the entire bus when it thumped heavily on the pavement as the tire blew out and the bus slued to the right. When the driver wrenched the wheel and guided them to the side of the road, there was a collective sigh that turned into a dark, wordless grumble when it was announced there was a flat and there would be another wait while it was fixed.
Tony was coming this way.
“I mean Wanda can get into a person’s head.”
Sorry this chapter is a little long. I wanted to get it all out there.
That night, Tony replayed it in his head, except he pretended that Jarvis was his father and was married to his mother, and after Maria put the horse away, they all went into the cabin and had dinner together.  And there was no fighting.  No crying.  No long silences filled with only the sound of cutlery squealing against the plates.  No worry that at any moment his father would get angry, because
They went outside, blinking into the sun. It was still bright, and Steve wondered how that could possibly be. He’d left his sun back in the cabin. Why wasn’t it dark out?
“Oh no, they know,” Tony agreed.
his son was doing with this scrawny, trashy kid in the first place.
Josh dropped his hand away from Tony’s side and stalked away, out onto the dancefloor. Tony glanced after him, back at Steve, then after Josh again.
, what," Tony said, staring at him.
“You have,” Tony assured him.  “You just didn’t know it.”
Tony nodded.  “So, go easy on me,” he said.  “We’re all
,” she said. “
“Cap?”
Tony carried a few boxes, then went inside for a glass of water.  He never went back out.
Tony stepped closer, not just piercing Steve’s personal bubble, but shattering it.  He put his hands on Steve’s arms, touched them, ran his hands over them, gripping them almost desperately.  “I want you to forgive me.”
He breathed, and soon instead of the slow, easy inhales and long, sensual exhales, his breath grew shallow. Ragged. Instead of tenderly caressing Tony’s hair, his fingers fisted in it, pulling the strands, urging Tony to go faster, harder, and he did. He did. Steve moaned in the back of his throat. Quiet but frayed. The breath catching, hitching in his chest. Eyes squeezed tightly shut. Everything--
“Please don’t say October again until you can put it into some kind of context for me.”
Tony raised his head, his hand snaking back up around Steve’s neck.  “Nothing,” he said.  “We raised the kids’ allowances.”
“Neither would Bucky!”  Steve flared.  “He was a hero, Tony, he wasn’t-he wasn’t like that.  He’s not what they made him into.  He’s my family.  The only family I ever had until you guys.”
Tony nodded. Kissed Steve’s hand again. “Okay.”
Steve looked at him from the corner of his eye. His head was lowered, that little smile still on his lips. “How do you do that?” he asked quietly.
Tony saw them in the Mess Hall, identical scoops of army-grade slop on their metal trays, rain coming down outside the tent, turning the camp to soup.  Blake shocked to see Captain Rogers at a table alone, doodling on a napkin while he ate.  Tony saw him standing indecisive for a minute before thinking, “What the hell?” and sliding in across from Steve.  Tony saw Steve look up, surprised but smiling, putting his drawing away while Blake chatted to him.  Tony saw Steve listening, nodding amiably at the kid’s stories.
Steve shoved his phone back into his pocket and raised his hand to signal a cab.
?” Tony asked. He sounded tired. And sad. Steve wanted to kill whoever it was that made him sound like that. Even if it was himself. He’d die if it meant Tony didn’t sound so defeated anymore. It would be worth it.
Also, I didn't proof this very well, so sorry for any typos. I guess that's the kind of gal I am too.
“That’s what it started out as,” Steve said finally. “But now. I don’t know. It’s different over there, Tony.
“Tense.”
That was the thing. It was
And speaking of people FRIDAY had too many feelings about considering she was a machine and shouldn’t have feelings in the first place…
Tony took his phone out of his pocket and pressed 3.  Strange didn’t pick up, so Tony waited for the voice-mail.  “Hey, Doc, it’s Tony Stark.  Can you meet me for lunch tomorrow?  I’ve got something to discuss and we might as well eat while we talk, right?  Don’t say no, ‘kay?  This is important.  The deli down from the Tower?  Albert’s?  One o’clock.  Their corned beef will change your life.  See you then.”
here, right?”
Tony had not stopped walking while they spoke.  His hands moved restlessly, leaving his pockets, coming out to touch the ropes around the boxing ring, running through his hair, then back to his pockets again.  He had orbited the space around where Steve stood, and now he was near the door again.  He was going to leave.  He may feel bad about it, because there was unfinished business here, but he’d still do it.  Steve knew he would.
Tony’s eyes went to the clock on the microwave.  Two-fifteen.  “Make it quick, soldier,” he said.
"Nobody's as pretty as you."
Tony took a step toward him. “It isn’t?” he asked, and the tiger was gone. Eeyore was back. Sad and lonely.
Tony did the same, that sense of pride still there.  Said fella met him at the door and Tony launched himself into his arms.  They made love then made dinner.  Every homecoming should be so sweet.
Steve laughed through it all. The sound was full-throated and happy. He wrapped Tony in his arms, allowing the kisses, kissing back. “I like your brain,” he managed. “Don’t gouge it out.”
He looked at his shoes, smiling an embarassed, pleased smile. “
Tony crawled up and pressed his lips against Steve’s.  Steve pulled him on top of his chest and kissed him hungrily back.  His eyes were closed, but his mouth devoured Tony’s by touch alone, his tongue licking into his soft, wet heat.
“How’s his stats, FRI?”
Tony slapped Clint on the back.  Clint spit on the sidewalk where they’d stood.  Tony ignored the spitting.  It seemed warranted just this once.  “Self-important pricks,” Clint said.  “I hate racists.”
Tony brushed past them and walked out of the kitchen then, but he heard Natasha’s long-suffering sigh and the sound of Steve’s voice no doubt filling her ears with the tales of Tony the Tyrant and his non-apology-giving ways.
Steve reached up and folded Wanda’s fingers into his, then smoothed her hair away from her face.  She leaned into him again and curled up against his chest.  She was still on his lap, and he held her there.  Tears made glistening tracks down her cheeks.
call. It was a little strange, but he called. And they made plans to meet on Saturday. Steve freaked out a little bit when Tony asked--in an unabashedly excited tone--what he had in mind. He’d thought in the back of his head that Tony would make the plans.
Tony nodded. “Alright. Fine. You can change it however you want. But one thing has to stay exactly where it is, okay? I insist.”
“I know.”
“I’ve got good scenery,” Tony said. “The lady who sold me the place called it a ‘million-dollar-view’.”
Tony kissed him some more.  Steve relaxed some more.  “Your mouth says no, Steve, but your body says yes.”
“Yeah.”
He nodded, squeezing her hands. “Yeah. I am.” He rubbed his cheek on his own shoulder to brush away the remaining tear. “It’s what I’ve always wanted. What I’ve always
Tony pulled back a little, staying just out of reach of Steve’s questing lips.  “Am I forgiven?” he asked, then teased Steve’s lower lip with a flick of his tongue.
“What do you mean?”
Tony glanced up, the sound of Steve’s voice stopping him immediately.  “What is it?”
The room filled up with people as the time passed.  Steve knew some of them--Bruce and Natasha. Peter, May, and Happy, a couple people from Stark Industries he had met over the years.  But there were a lot he didn't know, too. A lot who were strangers to him, but seemed to know Rhodey or Pepper. They went to them and embraced them, kissed them, held them.  Pepper let them cry on her shoulder. Rhodey shook a lot of hands, accepted a lot of pats on the arm or shoulder.
“I don’t wanna go backwards.”
“Report!” he shouted, barely hearing himself through the ringing and that shrieking, organic sound that wouldn’t stop, but seemed to cycle up and down, as if something or someone was pausing just long enough to take a breath. But that couldn’t be. Christ, he hoped that couldn’t be. “Barnes! Manelli! Report!”
“She’s six years old, Steve.”
“What’s that?” Steve asked, and reached for it.
Tony swept the little guy up in his arms, making him squeal, then landed him next to Natasha. She curled her arm around him and he lay against her. His thumb crept into his mouth. Nat smoothed her hand over his head and kissed him.
Steve shifted closer, still 80% asleep.  “‘Kay.”  He put his head against Tony’s shoulder as if it were the most natural thing in the world.  Tony left it there.  Because it was.
Getting home to Steve.
Sam gripped his shoulders and looked him over. “You look like shit,” he said plainly. “I didn’t want to say it the other night with everybody around, but you look like shit. When was the last time you slept through the night?”
Bucky looked at him hard for a minute, then threw a checker at him and smiled again. “You ain’t her, Rogers.”
“Yeah.  Funny.”  Rhodey grabbed his hand.  “You call me if you need me.  I know I don’t have to say it, but day or night.  You hear me?”
It was the best thing Steve had heard all day. The best thing he thought he would
“Okay.  No, you’re not like everybody else.  I know that, Steve.  If anybody knows that, it’s me,” Tony answered.  “You’re special.”
“What is
“Please?”
it’s not, but it’s like my mind and my body aren’t talking to each other anymore.”
“Morgan,” Tony said, his voice a throaty whisper. “Let’s go see those stingrays, okay? It’s getting late.”
Tony took a sip of his water. “Who likes me?”
“I wanted to.”
They spoke only once during this ritualistic act.  After the first pass, Steve lathered up a second time.
There was a television in the waiting room, and he tried to focus on that. He tried to pay attention to the insipid morning talk-show hosts, but he couldn’t. It just made him feel even more jittery. His eyes kept straying to the clock on the wall, but in true cliche fashion, the hands refused to move as fast as he wanted them to. And just the way it always did when he was feeling overwhelmed or sad, his mind turned to Tony. Steve wondered how it would feel to have him here with him right now, either telling him jokes to keep his mind occupied, or telling him everything would be okay.
Bucky shook his head again. “Guess we’ll see.”
At last, Bruce looked up.  He seemed decided.
“Yeah,” Steve said, running a hand through his hair. He felt like an idiot. Why did he still feel like an idiot? He was over this. He should be
Okay, here's the thing...
“Is it?” Steve asked into his neck. “I don’t know.”
Tony reached over and turned off the lamp.  He was wearing a black t-shirt.  The reactor glowed mellowly, diffused by the fabric, but still there.  He closed his eyes, listening to the subtle shift of the linens as Steve settled himself beside him.  It was all familiar, all things he’d gotten used to while they slept in the living room together, but here in the bed, the sounds seemed louder, heightened by the fact that Steve was bare inches from him, covered over by the same quilt.  Here if he wanted to touch him, he’d only have to slide his hand along the smooth, unbroken line of the sheet.  There’d be no rough terrain, no sudden drop-off at the edge of the chair, no leap of faith to where the couch began.  Here, there was just the solid mattress, firm, but not too firm, cool sheets, then a warm body.  It would be so easy.
Now he supposed he knew why. He understood that Tony sometimes had business emergencies he needed to deal with, but he would have expected him to at least tell Steve, especially now that they were in a relationship.
shared on discord
Tony gasped awake. Sweat poured off of him, as he peeled back his ratty blanket and levered himself off the oil stained couch. The memory of the dream was sharp in his mind even as everything around him was lost in a haze.
“But I’m wet.”
Steve wasn't going to hold back then. "That's what happens when you aren't paying attention in battle."
Hug #7
“Hey!” Sam shouted, sprinting to catch up.
True to his word, Tony bolts as soon as he spots Steve on the landing pad. There is no way he is letting Steve try to initiate another “talk” with him. He has half a dozen guesses on what it could be about, from the comment he let slip about Ross in that recent interview, to Steve finally noticing the crush Tony has been nursing on him and telling him to cut it out. No -- it’s best to just stay out of range of that for as long as possible.
"I didn't say I was collecting it only for Dad. There was a time Captain America was my hero too."
When they get to the scene, Morbius had already made a bloody mess of AIM’s beekeepers and turned about half into his vampiric underlings. The streets contained a chaotic mess of bystanders fleeing, AIM’s remaining soldiers attempting to reorganize, and vampires attacking both indiscriminately.
"They really didn't need to put lipstick on me."
“Sorry I said mean things to you last time. I was a real jerk.”
“Bruce is on the phone with Dr. Cho, they think they can treat the symptoms, but they can’t formulate a real cure for those people without knowing what was put into them in the first place,” Tony said, his voice sounding slightly tinny.
During the conversation the distance between them had shrunk. Tony hadn’t even noticed Hazel moving along the bed, but now that he really looked, he could see that there was only the scant distance between the bed and the chair separating them. If Tony wanted he could reach out and touch him. He really wanted to.
“Both, I guess. Though I’m the one that really tried to kill you.”
“I miss you,” he admitted to the long and strange shadows the city lights cast on the ceiling.
Peter pulled Tony in for a hug, lifting him off the floor in the process. The kid didn't even seem to notice, he just buried his face in Tony's chest for a second.
Tony trailed off, slightly concerned about the extreme fidgeting Peter was doing. He either had to go to the bathroom or was literally gearing up to bounce off the walls.
Sure enough, when Tony looked in his Ferragamos, two little blue eyes blinked back at him. “Thanks, J,” Tony said, scooping up the little ball of fuzz.
Turning back to the bed, Tony was relieved to find the remaining three kittens snuggled together in a pile. One of them yawned sleepily as Tony placed its sibling in the pile. Tony looked down at the dirty and too thin kittens as he stroked their fur.
Tony shook his head and turned away from the computer. "Oh no, it's way more than a thousand, that's just how many people are on this one part of this relatively new site."
“I thought we were having a moment,” Clint grumbled, pulling away.
Hug #4
There was the crunch of snow and a series of cracking sounds. Steve was numb. He couldn’t feel anything, yet simultaneously he felt too much, hot, itchy, achy, dizzy, and so, so cold. He was cold like he’d only ever been in his dreams, where his lungs filled with frost and his bones turned to ice.
The kitten climbing Tony’s shoulder reached its destination and planted its two front paws in Tony’s hair, its furry little stomach brushing against Tony’s ear. Meanwhile the little knuckle biter decided to get a few kicks in, just in case it hadn’t killed Tony’s hand dead enough.
On the battlefield not having a soulmate almost seemed like a blessing. He could have easily never made it back from some of those missions, there were several occasions he almost didn’t. It was rough just knowing he might never get a chance to tell Peggy how he really felt, never mind missing out on a future with his soulmate.
[According to the most recent data, Steve Rogers is still in Wakanda, Boss.]
"Hurry up and eat it before I decide to feed you gruel instead," Steve said, but Tony was already stuffing the crepe in his mouth.
More hugs from tumblr. Includes:
“You weren’t at the party.” Bucky melted out of the shadows in front of Tony, who was only spared from a heart attack by a ten second warning from Friday.
“We’ve barely been dating a week,” Steve said weakly.
Tony mummered in his sleep and curled closer to Steve, one hand holding on to Steve's sweater with an iron grip. Smiling, Steve brushed the hair out of Tony's eyes and re-tucked the blankets around him. He loved the fall.
The Assemble alarm blares over the tower’s sound system, cutting Steve off. They both simultaneously glare at the ceiling speakers, then look at each other, but the moment is lost.
For the one word prompt: smile
“Always.” Steve kissed Tony’s temple as he drifted off in Steve’s arms.
"There's land?" Steve looked around, trying to catch sight of any landmasses in the area.
"Anyway you just need to look into the camera and say your lines. Try not to be too stiff."
The waves sparkled in the sunlight and a soft breeze ruffled Tony’s hair. Steve surfaced from the warm, blue waters with a smile on his face. A few seagulls chattered away overhead, heedless of the drama playing out below.
I wrote this for
Unsatisfied that the hug was sufficiently comforting, Fury added a few soft pats to Stark’s back, before letting go. With a smile, Fury noticed that Stark looked rather befuddled, but lighter all the same. It was the best that Fury could have hoped for, really.
All the energy drained out of Steve. He stared at his feet, apparently not noticing or caring the way his jacket dragged against the floor. His voice had been hollow, resigned.
