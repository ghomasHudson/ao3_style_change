“I don’t know the details but once the dust settled after Iron Man, he noticed he wasn’t wearing it anymore. They must have taken it off him when he was held prisoner. He was a mess. JARVIS called me because even the AI was concerned for his safety. I’ve been with Tony through a lot and that was the second-worst I have ever seen him. The only time he’s been worse was a few days later when a package was left in his workshop. No idea how it got there. The security footage showed nothing. JARVIS had no record. Inside was an identical ring. No note, nothing. It took Tony a week to function. Then he was back in the lab, the new ring around his neck, no mention of it again.”
Disaster strikes. There are too many explosions going off and too many civilians around. At the center of the disaster is a nasty looking thing and a big green rock that the monster claims will destroy the world. Tony takes as many bombs as he can, and the rock, and just flies up. The suit takes the brunt of the damage from the explosion, but Tony is in pretty rough shape. Pieces of the rock are wedged into his suit and a significant piece is lodged into his leg. He is conscious when they find him, but the damage to his leg requires surgery. As much as Steve wants to follow Tony to the hospital, they agreed a long time ago that the job always came first. A few hours after the explosion, Shield is finally able to handle the clean up without them. Steve receives a message from JARVIS that Tony is stable, out of surgery and sleeping off the anesthesia.
“No, just curious.”
“No, it’s not. Tony never told me the meaning behind it. I just know it’s very important to him. He was devastated when he realized he lost it.”
“What happened?”
“It means whatever you want it to mean. The man who gave me this ring doesn’t exist anymore and that’s all that matters. Now close the door on your way out. I have actual important things to do.”
“Who’s Bruce Wayne?”
“Gotham?”
Bruce sighs, folds up the newspaper and pulls a metal looking box out of his suitcase. He opens it to reveal a green rock. A green rock with spots of blood and suspiciously the same shape as the one previously in Tony’s leg. “Had to get every piece. Don’t want these falling into the wrong hands. Gives my better half the hives.”
“You and Tony have been friends a long time”
“Oh. Well, you weren’t wrong. I did melt it down, that took care of the scratch.”
“Does this have anything to do with the conversation you had with Pepper?”
Tony sprung up. “What?!”
“Are you though?”
“Steve, we live together in a giant headquarters with a bunch of super-powered idiots who would kick my ass if I even thought about cheating on you.”
“That ring has been the hardest mystery I have ever tried to solve. Of course, she told me. We have someone new on the case! I’ve been waiting for you to ask me about it.”
“Sounds like a nice fella.”
“Would love to see you interact with him. Anyway, that’s all I know.”
Pepper looks at him quizzically before closing her laptop. “You’re asking about the ring.”
For as long as Steve has known him, Tony has worn a gold ring around his neck. It’s always tucked discreetly against his chest, near the arc reactor, hidden from view. On the rare occasions Tony is in public without his shirt, no one seems to notice the gold band gleaming against his skin. It doesn’t bother anyone, but it bothers Steve. Tony is an open book. The man doesn’t even believe in secret identities, but he never talks about the ring. Whenever Steve asks, Tony dodges. One night when they lay next to each other, Steve’s head resting on Tony’s chest, mere centimeters from the ring, Steve asks whose ring it was. Tony tenses for a moment and then leers. “Trying to tie me down, Cap?” Steve sputters and the ring is forgotten as Tony continues to tease Steve for watching too many wedding shows and hearing church bells.
“It was a pleasure meeting you, Captain Rogers. Tony, stay out of trouble,” and with that, the whirlwind that is Bruce Wayne leaves.
“What? He still wears it?”
Steve rubs his eyes and leans back in his chair. That ring has a power over Tony he doesn’t understand. He is concerned. Who would send him a new ring? Do they know how much power they had over Tony? Iron is stronger than gold, but it looks like Iron Man’s weakness is worn around his neck. And the worst part is, someone out there knows it.
Tony closes the projection and sits with his arms crossed and an angry look in his eyes. “I may be one of the most intelligent people on this planet but whatever you are trying to imply is not computing.”
“We’ll have to practice a pickup. I had to hide the handle. Don’t want some random guy grabbing on to me.”
“Excuse me, sir. This is a private room,” Steve tells the man. The man’s eyes flicker to Steve for a brief moment and then he looks back at the paper. He is dressed very well in a dark suit that looks as expensive as Tony’s. A suitcase rests against his leg. Something about him puts Steve on edge immediately. “I would appreciate it if you would leave immediately.”
Steve isn’t all that surprised, but he still feels awful. The grief in Tony’s voice is palpable. “Dead,” Steve echoes.
“I don’t see anyone here but you and me. And the bots, but even I’m not that desperate.”
“I’m talking about them,” Steve says pointing towards the center of Tony’s chest.
A few months after they announced their relationship to the team, Steve has a sit down with Pepper to discuss something important. Really most of what Pepper does goes over Steve’s head and he just agrees to whatever he was told. The conversation seems to be coming to a close when an unexpected burst of courage allows Steve to ask the only question he has. “Did you and Tony ever get married?”
Except Steve never forgets.
“Was it yours?”
“So, it’s not yours.”
“I was in the neighborhood, and was concerned for your welfare,” the man replies.
“Rich guy from Gotham. He disappeared for a while, probably partying across the world. He’s Tony at his worst times 100.”
“Why? That used to be something you’d enjoy.”
“Very funny Cap. You know I am a one-man man now.” He said sending a wink in Steve’s direction.
“What are you doing here?” Tony snaps. Steve is too shocked at Tony’s ire to realize the question isn’t directed at him.
“So you have met all of Tony’s partners.”
“A one-man man.”
Tony is glowing as he shows Steve his new suit design. It is lighter but more durable and allows for flexibility.
“Has he always been wearing it?”
“That’s amazing Tony. Really.”
Bruce looks confused for a moment before unbuttoning the collar of his shirt and pulling out a chain that holds an identical ring. “I thought you realized it was yours. I had to call in a lot of favors to get it back. Imagine asking your partner to fly to a warzone and retrieve a promise ring you exchanged with your childhood sweetheart.”
Steve never knew how to take an out. “It wouldn’t be cheating on me if I was the one you were cheating with.”
“Says the man who disappeared for 10 years.”
“I had to fit the tracker in.”
“So, I’ve been told.  You were missing for four months. I had to prevent that from happening again.”
It’s a while before Steve is brave enough to approach the subject again. It’s even longer until he is with James Rhodes alone. Tony leaves for a tech conference and Steve asks Rhodey if he would be interested in “hanging out.”  Hanging out involves drinking some beers and watching the Dodgers on TV and it’s the most normal Steve has felt in a while. He’s almost upset that it was all a ruse to get information.
“And I'll bring the popcorn.”
“Right, well, I’ve gotta speak to you, or forever you’ll have no peace.”
“I want this,” Tony pressed the words into Steve’s lips. He sounded sure. Steve knew better than to argue. He wanted this, too.
He heard the low hum of the voices of dining guests grow a little louder, and sensed the atmosphere shift. Turning around to see what had changed, he saw something he never thought he’d see.
“Close it.”
“It is, but it’s still a toxin, and I suspect your body will respond to it while it travels through your system.”
Despite this, home never changed, even when everything else around them did, and Steve always came back to the one who could assuage him.
Tony starts to feel better and better with every new shade of blush that colors the Captain’s cheeks. “Sure, Cap, you know, I actually wasn’t sure what that thing could do until I put it on this very morning. I was as surprised as you that it could fly. I suspect it runs on some form of electricity.”
“Do you think you could tell me about soulbonds? Has there been much discovered about them over the past few decades?”
“I feel things. Things I can’t explain. Emotions. Other people’s feelings, good and bad and everything in between. But with you...I could feel it from hundreds of miles away when they were still thawing you from your DIY cryogenic cube.” Tony hesitated, for a moment worried he’d already said too much. When he felt a spark of tenderness, he knew it was the push he needed to continue. “I just knew you were in shock, colossal pain, and needed my help. I’ve never told anyone that about myself before.”
I hope you’re well. Thank you for your replies, they mean more than you know.
He let out a small yelp, but didn’t protest. “Tony, you’re ok!” He said again, shifting to hold him.
Bruce approached, giving a quick glance at the restraints. “These really necessary, Bruce?” He gave a small jump to Tony’s gruff, biting question.
The kiss was salty with sweat, greedy, indulgent, relieving. A tiny jolt of electricity burned his neck, and he pulled away abruptly in surprise of the foreign sensation.
,” a deep, familiar voice hisses.
“It’s actually gold-titanium alloy, and, good catch, considering I’m called
“What do you mean, Thor? It’s mind control, what more’s to it?”
“Oh, honey, here, let me help you with that-” Natasha reached out with a steady hand, rendered ineffectual by Steve jerking away.
“Steve, I-”
“So, cheers to today.” Tony raised an empty hand, mimicking a toast. The movement distracted Steve from his thoughts, and he realized that Tony had been talking the whole time. The brunette gave a smile, and pushed himself up to stand. Steve followed instinctually, and the two began to walk toward the entrance to the compound.
After a few too many missteps, Nomad grabs Tony by the bicep, a firm grasp that helps quicken their pace. Their bodies brush against one another, and Tony shivers as he feels Nomad’s breath caress his cheek.
Someone moves, Tony can’t be sure who, and their lips brush together in tentative exploration. It lasts far too long and not long enough before Tony threads his fingers through Steve’s hair and claims his lips in a proper kiss.
Perform? That was a strange way to say it. Tony was pretty sure it had only been twice that he’d overindulged and insisted on turning the bar into a karaoke stage. That was ages ago, and it certainly wasn’t on a bi-monthly schedule.
He can’t breathe.
His balance is compromised by his hands bound together while walking over slippery rocks and rolling sticks through a steep, dense forest. He takes in the scenery, wondering if he can solve where they are, and equally wondering if it would matter if he could.
Not that his deceased lover, former knight of the SHIELD, could have saved him from this. It sits heavy in his heart that the man he loved with all that he could give is gone, and the grief gnaws at him fiercely that he never had the chance to bid farewell. Lately, this feeling has evolved into emotions that make his heart stop. Accepting his own mortality and understanding he will never see Steve before his own demise makes the end seem all the more terrifying. His lover died alone, and soon, so will he.
Before he could process it, Steve saw Tony shoot into the sky, guiding a missile into the gaping circle in the sky.
“This isn’t about Tony, you know that.”
.” Steve turned back to see Tony holding out something small and metal, catching the sun in a bright glittering glow. Tentatively, he took it from the inventor’s hand. Shiny, polished silver wrapped in an endless loop, rolling at the edges in a rounded curve, such that the place where the metal ended didn’t even so much appear to be a defined edge, but an inviting slope continuing in its movement. The detailed craftsmanship was mesmerizing, but there was a soft turquoise glow emitting from the inside loop. Steve examined it closer, and gasped.
“What’s there to remember? We were manipulated, maybe even brainwashed, why can’t we just move on like it never happened?”
Concerned he had made a mistake and worried about what a slumber party with Tony would entail, Steve went out for a walk, picked up a small gift, and promptly retreated to his apartment.
So, Steve started to make a ritual of it. After every battle, he would find Tony immediately after debrief. He would offer him a glass of water, watch him drink, and offer him praise.
Alright, here is a second playlist, curated for The SteveTony Games, Team Canon!
“That night. That night we...that you told me about your soulmark.”
“You can still live here. You don’t have to lose your home just because of some
For now, he decides to stay, refuse the insistent requests from Pepper and Rhodey, and let another song play.
“That
“And yet here I stand.”
He almost recoiled at the cry as Tony’s shouts mounted in crescendo.
“Getting rid of the alien guns doesn't require me to forget my wedding!” Tony spun around, face heated by anger and eyes misty. “Why would I risk this, Steve? Why would I risk you? I’ve wanted this my whole fucking life, to be happy and loved, and now Fury just thinks he can tell us we’ve been
“Let me take care of you.” Steve uttered lowly.
“I’ll just call the team up. 45 minutes. I can’t wait either. So, let’s do it.”
“Tony, I’m so-”
“Alright, Stark, I think I’ve got it. You both feeling ok? In your right minds? Cause it’s not like I don’t support a good marriage, but something’s not adding up for me here.” Fury’s expression was unreadable as always, giving nothing about his intentions away.
“No! Oh, well, mostly, but no, not entirely!” He felt heat stinging his cheeks. “I’m sorry, you were already asleep, so I thought it would be ok, I didn’t expect-”
He was hit with a burst of cold, damp air even before the icy rain fell upon his head. It was invigorating to emerge into the world, to be pulled out onto the sidewalk, wait, no, to be pulled out into the street-
This is wrong. The world is just wrong.
“But there’s nothing there! What do you even remember?”
He couldn’t look at Tony without a compulsion to hold him, he couldn’t hear his voice without longing to share with him his innermost feelings, he couldn’t even be in the same room as Tony without being overwhelmed by his intoxicating smell. His body ached to touch his skin, to taste him on his lips again, a taste that he used to think lasted days, but now knew it was a taste that faded too quickly, and could never, never,
Tony was whimpering, pliant and willing, and Steve knew he was ready.
Tony allows Nomad to bring him to his feet. He’s momentarily unsteady on the broken branches before the blood rushes to his feet.
“Are you sure?” Tony’s eyes were dark with lust, but was he really ready for this? Steve returned a kiss, slow and deep, before hoisting Tony upon his hips. “You tell me to stop, yeah?”
“Oh, Tony…” he began, his heart was swelling with this hope, this betrayal, he felt like he could just lean forward an inch and he would fall into this raging current, be carried away, safe and consumed, he was so close -
Steve silently fished around for his clothes before preparing to vacate the room. He could still smell Tony on his skin, and wished for a shower. But the growing saturation of pale early-morning glow from the window told him there was no time for matters of hygiene.
“See? I told you this is what you like.” Tony returned with an indulgent moan, stretching his head back, allowing Steve to lick along the exposed skin of his sensitive neck. “Gonna get you nice and ready to take me, gonna strip you down, kiss you hard, and take you deep. All without taking this uniform off. ‘Cause I know that’s what’s gonna make you come.”
!” he cried, almost surprised by his own eagerness, as he lost the only layer concealing his excitement. The timid nervousness that had lived in his body mere hours ago was nowhere to be found now.
Still, Tony was here, nestled heavily against his rough suit. He was still holding on. It was time Steve held on, too.
When Tony offered to take Steve out for a night in New York, he hadn’t expected to be sitting alone at a bar throwing back club soda like there was no tomorrow. Forty-five minutes past their agreed-upon meeting time and there was still no sign of the Captain. Maybe it was Tony’s fault for assuming a nonagenarian would be punctual, but he was starting to feel like he’d been stood up.
The conversations came up with more and more frequency. At first, they only talked about it when they were alone. Then, conversation flowed more easily, and Tony didn’t seem to mind discussing it at any time, no matter the company they shared. Even though Steve had found a sleuthing companion that shared his life’s biggest curiosity, it was difficult to shake the feeling that they shared something much deeper.
_____________
“I love you, too.” Tony’s gasping voice was so raw sounded almost foreign. Steve pushed up and caught Tony’s gaze. The emotion was palpable, and as he came down from his orgasm, Steve could feel the trust radiating from Tony’s heart.
Tony’s erratic attempt at escape is short lived, as something sharp grabs at his ankle and he crashes to the ground. He rolls to his side, attempting to view his attacker, and in a flash of movement sees a scythe coming down on him. He hears an impossibly distinct cracking of bone before his vision is obscured. He instinctively tries to move to no avail, and it takes a moment to register that the weight pinning him down is Nomad.
“Where are you taking me? I’ll assume it’s not a surprise team reunion.”
“Forever and always,” he repeated, feeling grounded saying the mantra.
“No foreplay, huh?” Tony raised an eyebrow, to which Steve rolled his eyes. “No, not much. Just keep thinking about that thing you said.”
_____________
When Tony finally pulled away for respite, Steve dropped his forehead to meet Tony’s. Skin touching, sharing one breath, Tony felt warm and rapturous. A sadness tugged at the back of his mind, but there was hope so blinding it was easy to know he was safe, and so was Steve.
At least some of the gear was probably intended for use on a man, to judge from the size of the gag, the shape of the chest harness, and the sheer existence of the cock ring. And the restraints were definitely meant to be used on a bottom with enhanced strength. But there was nothing saying that the intersection of those two sets contained only one individual -- after all, maybe the box's owner liked to switch it up with their play partners -- and, even if it did, there was also nothing saying that that was the owner of the box. They might be a submissive man with super-strength, true... but they might also be dating one. That didn't exactly close off any options.
"Hey!" Steve said, indignant. "That's not fair. That was Kang's mind control. That wasn't you, the same way the Sentient Armor wasn't you. And by the time I'd gotten to you, you'd broken the mind control. And you were
Tony clearly hadn't let Tiberius know about his secret identity, then. Steve was relieved to hear it. He couldn't say why, but he just didn't
And Steve knows this, as sure as anything: Iron Man doesn't think he's welcome here tonight.
Steve stood there, half in the doorway, and he couldn't stop staring. Tony was sitting at the table, spooning cereal into his mouth with one hand, holding the Daily Bugle with the other. The small TV on the counter was tuned to one of the news channels, volume low, murmuring to itself. Tony liked to call this little ritual his recommended daily information allowance for breakfast. It wasn't anything unusual, anything out of the ordinary. It just... was. And Steve loved him.
Of course, that's not the whole story.
was here. It was stupid how much better that made him feel, but it really, really did.
Stephen nods and pushes himself to his feet. "Absolutely. He's all back together. He'll be coming around in about five minutes. Are you
The cancer. Yes. Of course Steve knows. Tony had been diagnosed before Steve had been woken up. He's never known Tony without brain cancer, really. He never knew him before. He wonders if that man was different. If a brush with death changed him, like they say.
Tony's smile went sharp. "I was hoping you were." Then he tipped his head against Steve's shoulder, and Steve realized he was watching what he was doing, oh, God. Steve moaned, and Tony made a pleased humming noise. "Want to tell me how this goes? Or should I figure it out myself?"
That sounded fishy to Steve. But he knew Tony didn't want to hear it.
But Tony thinks he's good at this. It's-- it's really something, all right.
"As long as you're here," Tony mumbled. "Don't want to go anywhere without you."
God, Tony was brave.
"Steve, what are you--"
An invisible force smashes against his wrist, once, twice. Steve is forced backwards and down, away from his goal. He can't see what's coming. He can't brace for it. Even with his strength, it's hard to fight when he can't anticipate an enemy in the slightest.
"What the fuck is an octothorp?" Ghost grouses.
"How are you doing?" Tony murmured into Steve's shoulder.
He'd left Tony a few messages, none of which Tony had returned. Then he pinged Tony's identicard again, hoping that Tony was somewhere getting medical treatment. Tony had been in the ViaStone building all evening and it didn't take a lot of imagination to figure out what he was up to now. Comfort. Consolation. He was sleeping with the man who'd tried to kill him.
Tony pulled away far too soon for Steve's liking. His eyes were wide and dazed, and he was smiling as he licked his lips.
you wouldn't, but I couldn't help thinking of it anyway--" His voice roughened and then cut off.
"I don't think you want to know," Tony said, slowly, carefully, "how I actually want to answer that question."
"It's nice," Tony said, after several seconds, his voice a little huskier than it had been. He wasn't looking up. Steve wondered if he was similarly affected. He couldn't ask that.
Carol laughed. "You were saying?"
"Tony, if he was his bodyguard, then he'd
"I wanted to figure out who it belonged to." Tony was fully aware that his defense was pathetic. He'd violated Steve's privacy. What the hell had he been thinking? "I figured I'd open it up, see what was inside, see if there were any clues about its owner."
Steve wasn't sure if, after all that, Tony had really been listening to him at all.
By the time he made it home, Steve was forced to acknowledge that he'd only managed to keep himself together this long for Tony's sake.
Tony reaches out and fits his hand over Steve's. He's warmer than Steve is. That's rare. It's probably because Steve is still dead.
Steve watched as Tiberius broke apart.
"Of course," Tony said, smiling. "God, look at you. You can have my mouth. Just give me a second, okay?"
hadn't braced, because her feet had left the ground. And because Carol was Carol, that meant she was
He let his hand fall away as he stood up--
"Please," Tony says again. Obviously Steve's going to have to remove some of it, but this-- this is really doing it for Tony. It's a good look on him. It's a really good look. Steve looks like a
"Then...?"
Steve sprints toward them, getting there just in time for Iron Man to touch down. Iron Man sets the kid down -- and the kid promptly bursts into tears.
Tony was waiting for an answer. It seemed to be a real question.
"Winghead," Iron Man says, fervently, "you're the
. Is he joking? That's ridiculous.
was probably a word that someone like Tony shouldn't throw around. But Steve was gorgeous.
Tony was holding up his hand and grinning. "Nice Band-Aids you have here."
"Yes?" Steve asked, faux-innocently, as he kicked his underwear off the rest of the way and showily fondled his cock on the way back up, the leather of his cuffs sliding against his slick, flushed erection. He would have made a beautiful picture.
"It would be my absolute pleasure," Tony assured him, and he was utterly genuine. He tugged at the loosened waistband of Steve's unzipped pants, an obvious suggestion. "You want to get a little more comfortable?"
"You do that," Steve said, breathing harder now, "and I'm probably going to come whether you like it or not. Maybe should have mentioned."
"He was the only man who ever loved me, and he never really loved me at all." Tony's mouth curved, his expression once again graven with pain and sorrow. "I loved Ty. I trusted him. He'd known me almost my entire life, and I thought, here, finally, this was the right one, you know? Here was someone who knew me, knew me better than almost anyone else, knew nearly everything about me, and-- and wouldn't ever turn away. And then he did. It turned out it had never been real." There were tears in Tony's eyes. "I know I've made so many mistakes. I know I've loved all the wrong people. I know that a good half-dozen of my exes have tried to murder me. The bar is set so low that it's
Steve kept stroking Tony's back. He wondered if it was too intimate, if he'd been holding him for too long; this had gone far past a plausibly-deniable manly pat on the shoulder. He thought maybe they'd already started out past there. But Tony didn't seem to care, because Tony was still clinging to him like he was the last life preserver on a sinking ship.
Tony smiled down at him. "Say please."
"Shellhead?" Steve asks, uncertainly. "What are you wearing?"
Goddammit. It's like sparring with Vision.
"Oh, boy." Ghost laughs, obviously delighted. "You sure missed with that throw, didn't you, Captain?"
He reached in once more. A cock ring, with adjustable snaps, and a D-ring on that. Also vibranium. Whoever this person was, they sure liked attachment points. And probably had a dick -- or, at least, their partner did.
People had always stared at Steve. Before the serum, it had been pity, most of the time; he'd been tall and scrawny enough to stand out in a crowd. After the serum, it had been desire, true, but very little of it had been
"I'm here because I'm an Avenger," Steve informs him. "And what is it you're doing here, exactly?" he asks.
He hears Jan, down the corridor: "--and then there's Iron Man. He's been feeling a little under the weather since you woke up, but I'm sure you'll get a chance to meet him soon."
he? Surely Tony would have remembered. Steve had been seeing-- oh, what was her name-- his neighbor, out in Brooklyn Heights-- God, he really couldn't think--
Mr. Stark swallows. His mouth opens and closes a few times, shaping silent syllables; he must need to work out exactly what to say.
Because Tony is Tony, always in motion, he's across the room and over at the office area before it occurs to Steve that he could follow. Tony doesn't have much there: there's a huge, plush chair, and an even bigger desk, the majority of it covered in those holographic screens Tony likes. There's a laptop, pushed to one side, and a very small pile of actual papers. Ever the futurist, Tony is a big believer in the paperless office.
Steve didn't think Tony's complexion could let him blush, but there are bright spots of color in his cheeks, and when he lets the remaining armor fall, Steve sees why: he's wearing black lingerie, a barely-there creation of silk and lace, clinging to the curves of his ass.
"Do you ever think that you're too good for me?" Iron Man whispers. "Because sometimes I think that. I think that a hell of a lot."
He was-- he was so
But Tony just laughed, the air jolting from his lungs as Stone patted Tony's back hard. "Too long, Caesar."
Iron Man's laugh crackles with delight. "Duly noted."
for him. They didn't.
"And we're friends, right? You and me?"
That wasn't going to be enough.
"Steve," Tony says in his ear, his voice cracking with worry, frantic with it, like he thinks for one second that Steve believes any of this bullshit, "he's actually telling the truth. There are old weapons prototypes on that system. But none of them worked right. And they were all dangerous. They were too dangerous to let out, even to the user themselves, or the damage they caused was uncontrollable. And I never sold them, and I stopped working on all of them years ago. I don't-- I don't do that anymore. You have to believe me." There's an audible catch in his breath. His voice is thick.
"Up!" Tony called out, even as he felt himself glow with the pride that he could do this to Steve. "Up, up, back on your knees. Come on! You're going to fall with one good hit?
Tony didn't get it. Like he thought it couldn't ever have happened to Steve.
It pushes several other things to the forefront, too. Tony's underwear slides past his hips, exposing the muscular swell of Tony's ass, and Steve hastily tears his gaze away from the tantalizing glimpse of bare flesh. This isn't like that, Steve tells himself. And he knows that. But he also knows that he spent several days anticipating all the things he thought he was going to get to do to Tony tonight, and even though his mind knows that's probably not happening, his body has been primed for the experience. Having been held hostage at gunpoint is clearly not enough to dissuade him. Tony needs his help. He shouldn't be like this. He doesn't want his body to be like this.
If it was ever going to blow over, that was.
There's more than enough room for both of them on the bed, so that's where Steve sits. On another evening, it might have been an invitation to get up to something, and sometimes it has been; just because sex isn't currently a thing they're having doesn't mean that Steve can't close his eyes and let Iron Man kiss him until he can barely remember his own name.
And maybe, maybe -- Tony would
it. I can't, um. I can't... finish... without it," he admitted, and his face was even redder. "I can think about it and sometimes that's enough, but that only works for so long. And I-- I need you to want it too. Not just to make me happy. That won't work either."
Tony's penthouse almost, but not quite, boasts one of those trendy open-concept floor plans. When Steve gets past the foyer he's confronted with the wide expanse of kitchen, living area, and office area. Just past that is a half-length wall separating the public space from the more private space; he can see a walk-in closet, the corner of Tony's bed, and the door to Tony's bathroom.
Steve's heart jolted back to life. His vision swam.
Tony stared back at him, levelly. "I think you're the only one I
"I know what you do in the dark," Tony says, and Steve feels more tears drip down his cheeks because no one was supposed to know, he was never supposed to do it, and he can't say anything back, his mouth full of Tony's cock. "I hacked your servers. I read your reports. I know you tortured two men last week. Oh, not you personally. But you gave the orders, didn't you? You just let Sharon and Natasha do it."
Iron Man's nod is almost wary. Like he doesn't know where Steve's going with this.
"Please," Steve whispered. A sob wracked his body. "Just stay with me."
"None taken," Steve says, automatically. He knows Tony's not talking about him. He knows Tony thinks the world of him, still. He's sure. He's been sure of that for a long time now. Tony's always been in his corner.
Iron Man makes a horrible distorted-static noise and starts coughing. He's choking on his coffee. After several terrible seconds, he gets the straw out of his mouth, and then he coughs a few more times for good measure.
Tony was still squinting, suspicious. "Radioactive Man killed five people, including himself. I know Ty's got money, but money doesn't usually buy suicide bombers. You know that."
He kissed Steve's nipple, and Steve made an extremely undignified noise. He didn't really care about dignity right now. The pleasure was a straight line to his aching cock, and he was desperate for more. "Oh, Tony," Steve breathed. "Tony, you're definitely a genius. Oh, so that's good." He cradled Tony's head, running his fingers through Tony's hair, careful to avoid the bruised spot. Tony deserved all the encouragement in the world.
The shears are sharp, and they make short work of Tony's bonds. Several seconds later, Tony is lying on the bed in the middle of a mess of short lengths of rope. He's free. He's physically free. Mentally, he's definitely not all there. He's still not quite focusing. His expression, which on any other mission would be intent and professional at this point, is far too expressive. And fear still clouds his gaze.
Steve was out of his depth here. He didn't know how to deal with anyone who was like this. The kind of villains Steve fought on a regular basis were the kind of villains who were explicit and open about their love for fascism, and all he had to do was punch them. It was clear-cut. It was black and white. There was no subtlety. There were no mind games. That was who Steve had learned how to fight. And he was good at it. But Tiberius was so clever and so quick that he had Tony, the smartest man Steve had ever met, believing his every word. Steve didn't think he'd ever met anyone who could manipulate the truth this much. He didn't know where to go from here.
"As I understand it," Steve says, slowly, "even the best odds have some degree of uncertainty. I'm... in a unique position, you might say, to offer you a solution that will definitely not end in terminal cancer. Though I don't know whether or not you'd call it
"Anyone else, anyone else at all," Steve said. "They would have said Strength." Tony was looking at him like that would never in a million years have occurred to him, and that was why Steve loved him. "And I thought at first that you'd say Strength too. But then you didn't. And I just--" He chuckled. "That was it. I was absolutely gone for you."
"Fuck," Tony muttered, distressed, looking down at his chest again, patting the metal implant with his free hand, and, yeah, Steve definitely hadn't been meant to see whatever that was in his chest.
The door swings open and Tony's on the other side, smiling at him as the morning sunshine from the huge banks of windows behind him outlines his tousled hair and edges him in light.
"Oh," Tony said. He blinked a few times, like that hadn't even occurred to him. Steve supposed Tony wasn't at his best right now. "Okay. Makes sense." He sighed, pushed himself to his feet, and paced to Tiberius' half of the DreamVision setup. His movements were tight and jerky. Nervous. "Just say when, Cap. He'll probably come around as soon as I cut the visual feed."
It made sense. Of course it made sense. Tony wasn't going to believe something that didn't make sense.
"Me too," Tony agreed, fervently, and then his gaze settled on something just over Steve's shoulder. The television. The smile was fading rapidly from his face. "What the
, Stephen."
you?" Tony asked, intrigued. "Little black lacy numbers do it for you, then?"
Awkwardly, Steve chucked a thumb over at his kitchen. "I, uh." Oh, that wasn't a good start. "I'll get you something. What would you like to drink?"
, okay?"
"This?"
In an attempt to clarify, Steve tugged on the hem of Tony's shirt. "Is the only thing you don't want me looking at or touching, is it the part where the scarring is, by your heart, or is everything under the shirt off-limits? I'm absolutely fine with either, but I'd just like to know which one, you know?"
He knew Iron Man had a heart condition. But he didn't know about Tony.
. Steve hoped Tony's plans were going to involve getting some sleep. They probably weren't.
, Tony said, sleepily, after the last time.
"Oh, Tony," Steve breathes. "You're so good. Beautiful. So good for me. No one's as good as you, you know that? No one."
Steve's voice also sounded far away, and that
Tony's still not okay. But he's okay enough for this.
Tony clicked over to the private comm line and killed the external speakers. "Sure, why not," he said, for Steve's ears only. "Besides, I hear I've got a hot date to get ready for. Maybe tonight?"
Tony made an inarticulate sound of desire. "
a plan. He can do this. They're going to be okay.
Steve nodded, but the thing was, he still didn't look all right. He was the world's worst liar. "Fine, fine," he said. The words rattled out of him quickly, too quickly, and then stopped altogether. "I just-- I-- can I ask you a question?"
Mr. Hogan -- Happy? -- grins broadly into the mirror. "Whatever you say, b--" Oddly, his mouth snaps shut and he frowns. "Uh. Iron Man."
Steve licked his lips. "
Wow. Tony actually liked him talking. He was a keeper, for sure.
Mr. Stark is alone in the kitchen, standing next to the coffeemaker, empty mug dangling from his left hand. He's once again in a trim, tailored three-piece suit, the sort of outfit that looks like it costs more than Steve makes in a year.
Steve wouldn't say he's afraid, precisely. After all, he was right there on Omaha Beach for D-Day, two years and a lifetime ago. But as he stares at the empty Google search bar on the laptop computer screen, he's willing to admit to a certain amount of... trepidation, churning in his stomach.
"Go on," Tony says, encouraging. "Don't be shy, now. It's just me. You know me. I promise you do."
Tony stared at him like that fact hadn't even occurred to him and that he deeply wished he hadn't learned it. "You have a point," he said. His throat worked.
"Right," Steve said. "Hit me."
"I'm not an innocent," Steve says. "And you-- you look real swell, Tony."
Okay. Well, then. That was an extremely interesting fact that Tony was definitely going to have to remember for later. "
going to be okay.
Tony snorted. "Well, I can't imagine anyone else I'd want to find in your bed." His smile went softer. "Or anyone else I'd want, really."
"Pancakes," Steve said, decisively, and Tony chuckled. "There's a diner down the street. I want to go out for pancakes."
"Eighth floor," Steve confirmed, and Tony was so glad Steve couldn't see the face he was making. Yep, there went Christmas.
Now Steve really has no idea what's going on. He frowns, picks up his card, and types out a reply.
One of the best parts of working with Steve -- other than
All of a sudden, Steve's scheduled appearance on 20 Vision in the morning didn't sound like it was going to be all that fun. The host would want to know what he thought about this, the latest grisly development in what would probably somehow end up still being the ruin and destruction of Tony Stark.
"I can see that," Tony said, grinning, and then he blinked. "Wait, the
"Your phone?" Steve says, clearly confused. His hand drops as Tony moves away, as Tony stands up to get his own phone out of his pocket.
Steve lifted his head and kissed Tony. Their lips met, again and again, Tony kissing him back like he couldn't possibly get enough. Steve felt much the same. He wanted this never to end.
Had it ever been good with Tiberius, for Tony? Had Tiberius ever made Tony happy? Or had he hurt him the way Steve had seen all week, like a cut from the slenderest and sharpest of knives, so smoothly that Tony hadn't even known he was being hurt?
"You can't sleep either, huh? Do you mind if I--" Tony asked, gesturing somewhere next to where he was standing, and he didn't wait for a response before flipping the bedroom light on.
and, oh, yeah, he had him now. He raised his eyebrows. "I think I might know where you can find a guy like that. A guy who is intimately aware of your physical capabilities, but can take direction as needed. And he'd, uh. He'd like to see you in leather, if you're up for that."
Steve's up by 0600 every morning, a rhythm well-trained into him, a familiar routine. But when he opens his eyes, the world around him is unfamiliar. He's stretched out on a couch, covered in a blanket, and at first he can't make sense of the towering shadows around him in the dimness. Then he blinks, and memory comes back to him as his vision resolves: he's in Mr. Stark's workshop. Those are Mr. Stark's machines. The clock on the wall reads 5:46, in bright red digits. Steve's still not used to these clocks.
Looks like Tony doesn't actually need to do the asking. It's nice to know they're already on the same page.
All thoughts of romantic proposals slide out of Steve's mind as he leaps out of his seat, runs to the door, unlocks the deadbolt, and clumsily wrenches it open hard enough to rattle the hinges.
Hell, Tony thought, starting to smile to himself, maybe they'd even find some more of Steve's stuff. That would cheer him up for sure.
Just as suddenly, Ghost releases him.
not ready to touch that one right now.
Tony's smile is heartbreakingly sweet. Obviously hungry for more of Steve's touch, he props himself up with his other arm, trying to get himself closer -- and then his elbow, still coated in slick golden metal, slips out from under him and he crashes back onto the mattress, his hand falling away from Steve's grasp.
Oh, God.
Stephen looks wordlessly over at Tony, a silent question in his gaze.
And Steve didn't -- absolutely
After several seconds, Tony's settled on an answer. "Better than I was, in a sense." He bites his lip. "But-- no. Not okay. Not really. I'd call it more of a... differently bad."
Tony strides across the room, sets his helmet down on Steve's nightstand with a resounding clank, and then sits on the edge of Steve's bed. The frame creaks alarmingly in protest, but it holds Tony's armored weight as he stretches out on his back atop the duvet, boots and all.
Steve could never have imagined this. He'd seen Tony kiss people before. He'd imagined something practiced, seductive, controlled, the way he'd seen Tony kiss people, his every move calculated to thrill and impress. He knew Tony's reputation. He'd paid attention to Tony's reputation. He'd had a lot of furtive late-night thoughts about Tony's reputation, about Tony pulling out all the stops, using every trick in the book just to wow him. But that, Steve realized, had been Tony Stark, international playboy. That had been the mask. The man in his arms now was undeniably
But he has to say something. What kind of excuse can he give for Tony's absence? Maybe he can say Tony's injured. No, he'd need medical records to back that up. Tony's asleep? Not good enough. He can't think. He can't think of anything.
Steve definitely hadn't expected Tony's father to figure into this. Tony hated talking about his father. Steve had never pressed him. From what little he'd pieced together, Howard Stark hadn't sounded like a good father. Or, possibly, a good man.
"Yes," Steve said, smiling. "But feel free to tell me again."
"Hey," Steve murmurs, steadying Tony with a firm grip on his arm as Tony brings up his other hand to lean on Steve for even more support. "Hey, hey. Shh. I've got you."
Apparently that's not how Tony sees it.
Tony glanced up; he looked a little surprised. Either because he'd gotten it right or because Steve was so vocal about liking it, Steve wasn't sure. "Like this?" he echoed, giving Steve's cock another slow stroke, from base to tip.
Steve took another breath and steeled himself. He could say this. He'd come this far. He was brave enough to say it. He knew what Tony felt for him, even if Tony hadn't quite said it, himself. But Steve could be the one to say it. Tony needed to know.
And now they're here, and the date's over.
"Like the knight," Tony confirms.
That was when the pain started.
, laughing hard and trying to suppress it, and Steve has no idea why. After several more seconds, Iron Man's breath catches. His eyes are wide, and he looks over at the half-empty pizza box, lying open on the counter. "Is this about the pizza? I know I didn't tip the guy in cash, but I'm not that stingy, I promise. I tipped on the card when I ordered. Liberally. Handsomely, even. Trust me, Cap, I gave him more than enough money."
Steve turned his head and gave him a brilliant, blissed-out smile. "Always been here. Just another secret identity. Fella like you should know all about that kind of thing, right?"
Tony's smile quivered. "Yes, really. Why would I lie about something so embarrassing?"
Ghost is sitting at a computer, fingers poised over a keyboard. His white cloak is draped over the back of the chair. There's a portable drive about the size of Steve's hand plugged into the computer, wires coiling over the desk. That's probably not good.
And then Steve remembers Iron Man, and the rest of his concerns come rushing back. "Iron Man, is he--?" Steve asks, and the words catch in his throat, as if giving voice to his fears would somehow make them exist, would doom Iron Man.
They've already had the more conventional part of their anniversary celebration. Steve took Tony out to a very nice restaurant -- and
"That's life as a celebrity, Cap." Iron Man sighs. "People think they're entitled to all the juicy details."
"None of us know how long we have left," Steve says, softly. "Not you, not me, not anyone. And in a job like we've got, our lives aren't something we can take for granted. If you want to be alone, that's one thing. I know how to take no for an answer. But if you don't want to be alone -- well, I think we should make the most of what we've got. And I know who I want to be with."
Tony was silent for several seconds, mulling that over.
Maybe Ghost already left? Steve considers the possibility. Even if Ghost is currently invisible, Steve should be able to hear him. He can't. And if Ghost is already out of here, every minute they spend in here is a minute Ghost could be using to get farther and farther away with whatever he's got.
He couldn't, of course, make out Tony's expression as he glanced around Steve's living room. The place wasn't fancy, Steve knew, but it was comfortable. Steve tried not to wonder if Tony was comparing it to his own homes, to Tiberius'. Steve didn't have that kind of money.
Ten seconds later, Steve pinpointed the other thing that had been making his skin crawl: there were no pictures. There were no photographs of friends, family, or even beloved pets. This was the home of a man who loved no one at all. That was a terrifying thought.
Oh, hell. Steve's first, instinctive, panicked thought was that he
"And-- and Mordo?"
The mysterious visitor didn't knock again, but Tony didn't hear the sound of footsteps in the hallway. They weren't leaving. Curious, Tony leaned toward the peephole, and through the fisheye lens he saw--
Once he's through the glass doors, he's faced with a ragtag group of strangers -- a few security guards, a harried-looking receptionist, several employees who push past Steve in a hurry. The mood of the atrium is stressed, but not panicked; they've clearly done this before.
"This is my heart."
. It was wishful thinking, he knew. But it was worth a shot.
"Yeah." Steve took a few breaths to try to compose himself. He was still too close to think straight. "I, uh. I can keep going. I do last longer after the first one," he assured Tony, not that Tony seemed to need the reassurance, "and I definitely don't have to if you don't want to go to all that trouble" -- Tony mouthed
Whatever Mr. Stark told Iron Man about himself, it
"Hey, no," Steve said, rubbing circles over Tony's back. "It's been an honor and a privilege, Shellhead. I mean that. And there's nothing wrong with crying. Nothing wrong with it at all. Sometimes you just have to let yourself feel what you feel. It's okay. No shame in that."
Steve was willing to admit that he hadn't been in his Quinjet seat with his safety harness securely fastened, but that was because they'd taken off about twenty seconds ago and Tony had gotten to the cockpit faster. Trying to clear out an AIM base with just the two of them, Steve could acknowledge in hindsight, had been a mistake, but at least there was no permanent harm done. Unfortunately, that included to the AIM base as well -- if Steve could have looked behind them, he thought he might have seen half a dozen beekeepers angrily shaking their fists.
There were still a few goons on the floor, but they weren't going to be a threat, and Steve could undoubtedly take care of them all by himself. Tony relaxed, lowered his hands--
Oh, hell. Her sponsor was
With Iron Man, the days seem to fly by. And the weeks. And even the months. Steve wakes up one morning and realizes it's been just over five months since the two of them started dating. He lies in bed, stares up at the ceiling, and allows himself to ponder this.
His shield is flat on the floor behind Tony. Tony never even picked it up.
Tony's head snapped up, jaw gone slack, shock followed by the tiniest embers of hope coming to life in his eyes, and the fact that Tony plainly didn't expect anyone, even Steve, to be
again.
Steve tried to find a rhythm, had it, lost it, and then had it again. He realized Tony's fingertips were slipping lightly against his hair, in time, and then a few seconds later Tony started to rock with him. He wasn't trying to thrust in deeper; he was barely moving, really, but he seemed much more pleased nonetheless. Tony moaned a little louder, and that was when Steve realized he was rubbing up against Tony, his hips working, his body searching for more stimulation. Tony could feel that. And Tony liked
"My pleasure." Tony grins at him. "Of all the times in my life I've gotten screwed by the Phoenix Force, I have to say I definitely liked this one the most. A-plus."
He has the feeling that Iron Man likes him. He sure likes Iron Man a lot, anyway, and it seems like it might be mutual. They work together amazingly well on the field, and Iron Man spends a heck of a lot of time around him even when they're not fighting supervillains, so much so that Steve wonders if Mr. Stark is really safe without his bodyguard. Iron Man's smart, too. Maybe not as smart as they all say Mr. Stark is -- Steve wouldn't really know -- but almost any time he's had a question about the future, Iron Man's been happy to explain it, however long it takes. He cracks jokes, terrible jokes, like he just wants to make Steve smile, and when Steve's around him sometimes he feels like Iron Man's presence is the one thing that makes being in this century all worth it.
I can tell you?"
He pointed, and they could all see Tony now; he'd gotten past all the other people who'd been waiting to talk to Tiberius. Tony was smiling and clapping Tiberius on the shoulder. No doubt he was telling Tiberius all about his plan. They'd probably have some business deal worked out by the end of the evening.
"I don't want it to be true either," Steve said, as gently as he could. "But you have to admit that it looks like a real possibility. If he were anyone else, if he had any other relationship to you, you'd be suspecting him already. You know you'd be."
Tiberius laughed. It was a hideous sound. It wasn't-- it wasn't
Of course, now that meant that Steve had to amuse himself until Tony was finished with talking to Tiberius. He glanced around the room as the crowd began to disperse back into their previous little knots of conversation. And it turned out he didn't have long to wait, because it wasn't more than thirty seconds after that when Hank caught sight of him and waved him over.
, after all. It wasn't like it was going to be something bad. "Anything. Hit me."
Because in the meantime, Tony was going to get hurt.
"Okay," Tony said to the box. "Let's just see what you've got in here."
That was okay. There was no shame in crying. Steve would be there for him. Tony would let him be there for him.
"It's okay," Steve says, keeping his tone gentle. "You're safe, okay? You don't even need to try to stand right now. You can let go. I'm here. I've got you."
Steve obligingly wiggled his fingers. "No, you're good."
"Yeah," Tony murmured. "Yeah, I think so."
"Yeah, it does," Tony said.
"So I told Ty," Tony said, miserably. "Because I trusted him. I trusted him more than anyone in the whole damn world. I told him I was bisexual. I told him about my massive crush on Captain America. And he looked at me, and he said it was a good thing I'd come to him first, him before anyone else, because he knew what to do. He told me I couldn't tell anyone else about this. I couldn't tell anyone ever. Because they'd all hate me for it. Just the way everyone had always hated me for it, except worse, because now I knew it was true. He said I couldn't tell anyone it was true." Tony grimaced. "So I didn't. I didn't tell a soul. Because I believed him. I got better at hiding it. No one else ever guessed, after that. No one knew except Ty. And all the while, he was filing it all away, every secret I ever told him, so he could use all of it to hurt me."
. You were always desperate for even the slightest hint of affection. So I gave you more. I always gave you more. You're an addict, Tony. I figured that out twenty whole years before you ever did. So I got you hooked. And you let me do whatever I wanted."
. The word no one was saying. It had to be more than just a scene for Steve, didn't it? Maybe only Tony felt like this.
Tony's eyes are starting to water a little, but Tony already made it clear a long time ago that he likes that. To be honest, Steve likes it too. He knows he's not hurting Tony -- at least, not in any way that's
Maybe this was going to be easy. Maybe they had their name written on the inside. It probably wasn't going to be that easy, but he could hope.
"Hey, hey, shh," Steve said, softly. He realized he was stroking Tony's shoulder. He stopped; he let go. "You're not stupid, Tony. You're brilliant. You've always been brilliant."
question, then it's fair to say that the setback here is in the step calling for you to verify. What we need is something that you know you don't know, and that you can be certain that Tiberius doesn't know either, but it has to be something that can be somehow verified by you, here and now, as true. Even though it's absolutely new information to you. If and only if that is possible, you'll believe that you're not dreaming."
Actually, he was still acting really strangely. He hadn't looked up when Tony had let him in. He hadn't even met Tony's eyes. He was still staring fixedly at the floor as he shuffled in. His face, Tony saw now, was ever so slightly flushed. His cowl was still up, like he didn't even want Tony to see his expression if he could help it.
"I don't know," Tony whispered, and now he sounded terrified again. "God, Steve, I don't know." His breath rasped. "I knew where I was. I knew what I was doing and who I was doing it with. I knew it was something that I'd wanted. But, for the life of me, I don't know whether I'd have said yes if I'd been sober. And I-- I think he knew that. He must have known that."
Tony's smile was still pained. "Not in any way that does me any good right now. I'd trade my next three integrated circuit designs for the ability to spot someone trying to gaslight me." Lifting his head, he regarded Steve. "
His shirt and undershirt had come off easily enough -- and then Tony had, understandably, been distracted for at least a minute by the expanse of
"This is DreamVision," Tiberius said, proudly. "If you want to win gold in the Olympics, you can! ViaStone will provide the programming, and you can do anything your heart desires. Right now, this is what our lovely volunteer is experiencing. She feels just like she's there. She can be whoever she wants to be, feel whatever she wants to feel. But it doesn't end with ice skating, of course."
"So," Steve said. He bit his lip. "Uh. You were saying?"
Tony lowers his hand. "Steve, I'm so sorry," he says, low and miserable. Even through the vocal filters, he's obviously crying.
Tony let his hand fall limply to the bed. "And you
He held out his hands and stared down at them, dazed, as if they belonged to someone else. His left hand was smeared with blood. His right hand was rapidly swelling. It was probably one of the metacarpals. It was hard to tell.
They land. Steve can tell when the autopilot cuts out, because the armor shudders and wobbles as Tony holds his hands out, too slowly. They jolt when they hit the ground. Steve steps off Tony's feet but keeps one hand against Tony's back, out of habit. Tony did say the suit would keep him upright, but if Steve has to he can catch him one-handed. He's done it before. In the armor, Tony weighs several hundred pounds. It dislocated Steve's shoulder. But he'll do it again if he has to. He just hopes he doesn't have to.
Steve took a deep breath. He was going to speak slowly and calmly. If he raised his voice, he lost this. Being right wasn't enough. He also had to have the right tone. And maybe that wasn't fair either, but that was how it was. This was what he needed to do to fight for Tony.
Luckily, Tony seemingly hadn't noticed there was anything wrong. He waved his hand, a gesture encompassing the entire kitchen. "Well?" he said, still smiling, like he was prompting Steve. "Come on in and fix yourself something. I'm almost done, don't worry. I won't get in your way. I've got a meeting to get to at ten."
, their lights glowing steadily, and it's not much but it's enough. Steve watches, his heart in his throat, as Iron Man hits the ground, tips, lands on his back, and skids to a stop. In a few more seconds, Steve is at his side.
"Fine."
He hadn't expected Tony to take his hand. Tony cradled his hand with one palm; his other hand slid over Steve's inner arm. Tony's fingers were warm and callused, softly stroking Steve's two bared fingers, tracing a path over his palm, his wrist, down to the end of the splint and back again. He held Steve's hand carefully, at the same angle Steve had held it forth, obviously trying not to rotate any part of his arm.
At first, the gossip and speculation had stayed confined to Whiplash's death. Tony's supposed rivalry with Trevor Donahue made the cover of one of the weekly news magazines. Steve didn't bother reading it.
It wasn't as tight as Tony's hand, the pressure more diffuse, and the latex definitely obscured how wet Tony's mouth was, because, God, Tony was messy with it already, his lips shining. It was a gorgeous sight. Tony had called himself a cocksucker, and that had to mean he liked it, didn't it? Even if he didn't like swallowing. Maybe he'd do this again sometime. Maybe he'd do it again right now. Maybe he'd just stay right here until Steve had had his fill.
Steve's eyes went hot, prickling with unshed tears. Even in this, Tony was trying to be kind. "It's nice of you to offer that." He could barely get the words out. "But I think it's best if I go. You've made your stance perfectly clear. And I-- I care about you, Tony." He drew himself up, tried to find Captain America within himself, the part of him that knew how to stand tall. "I care about you a lot. And I don't think I can handle watching what happens next."
He was a few steps from the elevator when Tony's hand closed over his shoulder.
, Tony. You were
"Mr. Stark?" Steve ventures, and the man's head snaps up, so fast that an errant curl of dark hair falls into his eyes. A part of Steve wants to push it back for him. "Are
But he can find him, no matter what, and he can hit him. And he can keep Tony out of the way.
The Vishanti wouldn't have made him the Sorcerer Supreme if he were actually stupid, and Tony knows Stephen isn't, but he's too frustrated to get all the words out. Tony hisses. He wants to punch something. He's so tired. They're all so tired.
He hears the rustle of fabric, and he forces his eyes open to see Iron Man taking a folded blanket from the back of the couch. Iron Man unfolds it, and then the blanket settles over him.
Keeping the rest of him perfectly still, Tony glances over to the open doorway, a query and a warning. The voices of the rest of the Avengers are too faint for him to hear now. It's unlikely that any of them are going to need to come back here anytime in the next hour or so. However, Steve's usually a private kind of guy, and in Tony's experience Steve has never before been down to raw Tony on the briefing-room table where anyone could, theoretically, walk right past and see them. But there's a first time for everything, and Steve isn't one hundred percent Steve right now.
. And he was going to think this through.
He glanced over at his bike, then Tony's car. "Okay, well," he said. "Since I'm pretty sure you don't know where my apartment is off the top of your head, do you want to follow me over?"
"So that's it, then," Steve says, flatly. "That's what it is. You're jealous."
"Steve, are you okay?"
He was-- he was amazing. And he wanted Tony.
It was just a feeling. It would go away.
"Yes," Steve breathed. "Yes, but lower."
started having problems."
There was a whole bookcase of science fiction and fantasy, from pulp classics to last year's award winners. Most people wouldn't have been surprised to learn that about a third of the collection was Carol's, and another third was Tony's. They were, as Carol had put it once, the space nerds of the team. But the other third was Steve's. He'd always loved stories about other worlds, ever since he was a kid. Stories about the future. And now he'd found himself in the future. It was even more amazing than he could have dreamed.
That shouldn't be unusual; in fact, Steve should have expected it. Iron Man told him he survived a shrapnel hit to the chest. The scars should, in fact, be a hell of a lot worse than just this. They probably are, elsewhere.
Steve couldn't resist reaching out and tracing the curve of Tony's smile with his thumb; Tony kissed the pad of his thumb as it slid across his lips.
"I didn't know how to say it," Steve admits. His face is hot. He doesn't even know why he didn't offer. "I've been told I'm not bad. I mean, I'm hardly a professional--"
was the one who was going to cry. Again.
"Out of my office now, please," Fury was saying. Tony didn't much care about that either.
"Luckily for me," Tony said, and it was only that Steve knew him so well that he could tell Tony was scared, beneath the confidence of his tone, "jury verdicts aren't determined by Nielsen ratings."
He felt a little weird saying it, because he couldn't think of any other time in his life when dirty talk had included the other person thinking that he, Iron Man, was in any way sexy, but Steve whimpered again in encouragement, and when Tony pressed just a tiny bit, the first two fingers of his hand slid inside Steve as easy as anything, like Steve had been waiting all his life for this.
Oh, hell. Those were Tony's clothes.
And then he's gagging, he's choking-- where's the closest-- kitchen, he'll go to the kitchen--
. That was his answer.
Steve didn't see why he should believe a single word that had ever come out of Tiberius' mouth, and he wasn't about to start now.
routine. And maybe that's why they get... complacent. Iron Man is in the air, tangling with the Black Knight, repulsor rays lashing either side of his opponent's flying horse, trying to draw him toward Hank and Thor, who will make short work of him. The Black Knight, for all his fearsomeness, can't fight at range, and that's where Iron Man excels. Steve avoids a blast from the Melter -- he doesn't know if the Melter can ruin vibranium, and he sure as heck doesn't want to find out -- as he squints up at the swirling figures in the skies. Iron Man keeps spiraling away, just out of his enemy's range--
"And also your unlife, sweetheart," Tony says, grinning.
It wasn't going to change Tony's mind.
God, oh, God, Tony
Tony stroked the side of Steve's neck. "And-- and if someone wanted to?"
Tony's gaze meets Steve's. His eyes are wide. His throat works.
"What?" Steve asked, bewildered and more than a little hurt. No, they definitely did not both know that. "Of course you haven't disappointed me."
It was tempting, but-- Tony shook his head. "Still no. Not without a condom." His last test had come back clean, but he couldn't guarantee Steve six months of monogamy, and they were in a shared profession that did involve being routinely covered in other people's blood. And even if they'd had condoms... well, obviously they couldn't have used the Vaseline anyway.
None of those words, Steve noted, were an apology.
"Stand up,
Guiltily, Steve spends the next few days thinking about just how much his life is like a fairytale. He furtively glances at all the men he passes on the street, wondering if any of them are Iron Man, if he would know him if he saw him. He can't very well walk up to anyone with one of Iron Man's boots, after all.
"Come on," Tony says, suddenly breathless. He raises his hand to Steve's face, runs his thumb over Steve's lips, the dimpled corner of his still-smiling mouth, the near-translucent stubble of his jawline. Steve doesn't have much in the way of bare skin, but Tony can work with what he's got. "Come on," he says, again. "Help me out here."
There was a little too much color in Tony's cheeks. "Oh."
All he had, once again, was the truth.
"Easier if you turn over for this part," Steve tells him, and Tony rolls over onto his stomach and slides halfway off the table, until his feet hit the floor, his chest still flat against the table. Steve has a hand on his back, bracing him, holding him firmly in place. If Steve wanted to hold him down, Tony wouldn't be able to stop him.
"I'm happy to share some of my body heat," Steve offers, after an excruciating minute of watching Tony shake and suffer in silence. "I've got lots to go around."
, that absolutely isn't human. But Tony knows, knows in his heart, that this is Steve and Steve isn't going to hurt him, and an instant later Steve's eyes are blue again.
"Medical's on the way." Steve's voice was tight. "Just hold on, okay? Help is coming."
And then Tony realized three things, in rapid succession:
"You like that, don't you?" Steve asked, whispering the question against the curve of Tony's lips. He felt a little silly asking when the answer was so obviously yes, but at the same time it was nice to know he was doing something right, when he'd never done this before.
And of course, that was when they got to the alcoholism. No one but Tony's closest friends had known about his struggles with alcoholism during the incident with the Carnelian ambassador. But his breakdown and fall from grace as Obadiah Stane had taken over his company had been excruciatingly public. There was a lot of footage of Tony at bars, Tony at parties, Tony staggering out onto the street. One of his less-loyal former employees talked about how Tony, homeless and desperate, had come by his house to beg for money. He'd only wanted twenty bucks. God, he'd been a millionaire the month before that, and then he hadn't even had twenty bucks to his name. The reporter talked about how Tony was a drunk, always a drunk, a danger to himself and others, as if he hadn't been sober for five damn years since, as if all the good he'd done counted for nothing.
That must have been some explanation, all right, Steve thought, with admiration. Still, Tony was a genius, so it had to be a solid explanation, somehow. Tony obviously wouldn't have believed it otherwise.
Repulsors momentarily forgotten, Tony stared in sickened disbelief. "So you're telling me you're causing all this chaos for the sole purpose of
Steve's gaze now was bright with even more hope. He was starting to blink back actual
Of course, if this was all a setup, which it probably was, Tiberius was going to be perfectly fine. But Tony didn't know that.
As far as Steve was concerned, it wasn't enough of an apology. He couldn't say that, either. Tony's mind had already been made up. Tony wasn't going to believe him.
"Right," Tony said, satisfied. "Now if you roll over, you'll more or less be stuck on your elbows and knees. How do you like that?"
Tony's gaze was very far away. He looked like he wanted to be sick. "It was always much worse than I thought it was, wasn't it?" he said in a small voice. "It was all wrong and I didn't even know. He, uh. He said it felt good enough that he couldn't possibly stop himself. But that was another lie, wasn't it? And then he'd get upset when I had to stop because I was choking or gagging or sometimes just crying. And I just thought, if I could get good at it, if I could do it right, he'd finally be happy. I was so
Tony sighs.
He could do this. He could do this for Tony.
Three: The box that the riding crop had come from
"Both," Steve said, with a grin. "He was a lot less classic when I read him the first time, while I was stationed in London. I borrowed a couple of his novels from somebody. Traded them a few of those Armed Services Editions. We all swapped books when we were done with them. I read everything I could get my hands on, in the downtime. Wasn't too picky. But I didn't read this one then. I couldn't have. It wasn't published until the seventies, after he died, because this is, uh." He swallowed hard. "His gay novel. He was gay."
"I don't need a hug."
The oddest transformation happens to the man's face then; he slips on a bright, charming smile, like charisma is something he can wear, and despite knowing that it's happening, Steve is still drawn in.
. Tony supposes he sort of is.
And then there was... him. Steve had grown up dirt-poor, and the only reason you wouldn't know it to look at him was that the Army had decided he'd needed to impress rich people to get them to donate to the war effort, so they'd scrubbed the accent out of his voice and taught him how to hold a polite conversation and shown him which fork went with the salad course. He wouldn't embarrass himself at a fancy dinner, but he obviously hadn't been born into that world.
His worry must have shown on his face, because Tony took it for something else entirely. "Steve? Everything okay?"
"AIM?"
He really didn't know what to say. He wasn't good at this. He didn't have the words for this. He'd never needed them before. And then his opportunity to tell Tony what he thought about that was gone, because Tony started talking again.
Tony set his mug on the coffee table, leaned over, plucked the mug out of Steve's unresisting hands, and set Steve's mug down next to his. Then he slung his arm over Steve's shoulders and pulled him sideways into something that was more or less a hug. Tony's arm was cool across the back of Steve's neck; his palm curved over Steve's bicep like it had been molded to fit there, like Tony had made himself into a suit of armor.
"So," he says, softly, as softly as he can, because he sure doesn't need the rest of the team overhearing this, "if you're not a gentleman, Shellhead, would you like to come inside with me?"
"Absolutely," Iron Man assures him. "Here you go."
"I'll be there."
Steve's shifting his weight and still trying to find somewhere else to look when he meets Tony's eyes. And of course Tony knows what the problem is.
and it was skirting the edge of being too much. Overwhelming. He didn't know what would happen to him when he slipped across that border.
"So what you need," Tony continued, "is someone who isn't afraid to put their back into it. Literally. Someone who knows exactly how much you can take and wants to make you
"But there has to be something the doctors can do for you." He doesn't know if that's true, but he wants it to be. Surely the future has everything. "There are drugs now for that, aren't there? I know I've heard of one. You must have heard of it too, if even I have." He racks his brain. He can't quite remember what it was called. "Starts with a V, maybe?"
Once again, Mordo pointed at Tony. And as the air in front of him began to glow, Tony decided that dodging was the better part of valor.
Maybe he can remake himself again.
"Of course I did," Tony said. "I mean, that's just obvious." And now Steve had definitely stumped him; he couldn't figure out why Steve was happy about that. "I-- what-- how does that even mean--?"
The Maria Stark Foundation gala, as always, was a lavish affair; the huge room was filled with millionaires in tuxedos, equally-rich women in evening gowns poised on their arms. Tony of course had looked gorgeous in his own tux as he'd stood on the stage and made his own opening speech about how he was grateful for their presence, for their charity.
"Okay," Tony says. This is not okay. He runs his hands through his hair. "You might want to sit back down."
So they weren't being especially discreet. The rest of the team was probably going to figure it out pretty fast, if they kept acting like this in public. Tony couldn't really bring himself to care about that. It wasn't as if Thor or Tigra were going to disapprove.
"And I'm so glad you love me," Steve murmured. "He didn't ruin this, okay? He doesn't get to ruin this. You love me and I love you back and that's got nothing to do with him. He's never, ever going to hurt you again." He met Tony's eyes, and he let himself smile. "It actually makes me awfully happy that you loved me first. Don't know if I ought to admit to that. But it's true."
"It's not so bad, really," Iron Man continues. "I just have to charge it every so often. That's why I always have to leave in a hurry. Believe me, I'd rather stay with you. But if I don't get to an outlet on a regular basis, the battery runs out of juice." He laughs. "No one knows that either."
"It's me," Steve murmured, and his eyes were stinging too. "It's real. I'm really here. I swear to God." Tony the atheist probably wasn't going to find that much of a comfort. "I swear on my shield. I've got you, Tony. I've got you. You're all right."
"Yeah, but not from me." Tony still looked faintly guilty. He took another breath, gathered himself together. "Anyway. So it's not unexpected that he still wants to win," Tony continued. "Whatever that means to him. But, admittedly,
Tony wanted to tell Steve he didn't want that. Tony was vain enough to know that he'd been good-looking once. He'd been unscarred. But then there'd been the shrapnel, and the heart surgery, and even after that he'd just spent months on the streets. He was scrawny, out of shape, and he looked it.
"I really didn't," Tony said, quietly. "You got the edited version. Because what actually happened, in most of the dreams you were in, was that he gave me a whole lot of nightmares where you informed me that you were never, ever going to love me. For a variety of reasons that he was very happy to have you enumerate." He exhaled raggedly. "Then he figured out it was even more fun if he had you tell me you loved me first before telling me that it was all a lie and that you would never feel that way about me."
For a few seconds it seemed like Tiberius hadn't heard. His face didn't change. But then his smile grew wider.
Oh, God. No, no, no. Not this. Please, not this.
Tony had expounded upon his D&D theory of personality several years ago, one late night when neither of them could sleep -- and because it was Tony, Steve had listened to him explaining for twenty entire minutes about how to play D&D, including a nearly-incomprehensible digression on something called "THAC0." As far as Steve could determine, it all sounded a lot like playing make-believe with toy soldiers about being in a Tolkien novel, except with a bunch of dice and a whole lot more numbers. But Tony had explained the whole thing, and he'd talked about character attributes, and how, in his head, sometimes he liked to work out what other people, real people, would be like if they were in the game.
He put his hand on Tony's shoulder. "You're not the only person whose father ever hit him."
"Hey there, handsome," Steve murmurs. "How's it going?"
"Oh," Tony added, as casually as possible, "and I'll take the box too, of course. Sorry about that."
He's still holding Tony's hand. He leads him to the stairwell, pulls the doors open, and leads him up a flight of stairs. Tony's footsteps echo. Tony's breathing over the comms is heavy again, fast and ragged, like he's panting. Tony says nothing. But he's still following, and he's alive and breathing. Steve will take it.
Dropping his hand, Steve squinted at him. "Yes?"
"Of course I know him!" Steve retorts. "I know everything I need to know about him. And I care about him."
, Tony told his chattering hindbrain,
"You do not. You'd be so frustrated if I agreed with you all the time."
"Glad to hear it."
“Alien invasion, Captain. I think the severity of the situation screams for some sweet songs to enhance the mood.” The armor shoots through the sky as the guitar fades away and something much more synthetic-sounding plays in Steve’s ear.
He removed his hand from Tony’s cock to scrounge around in a small outer pocket of his pants, retrieving a small bottle of lube - a necessity Steve always maintained in his uniform, since the hours were few that he wasn’t wearing it these days.
“Can you manage a walk?” the voice says, but it’s not really a question. How does he know that voice?
“I’ll spend the rest of my days doing just that, if you will have me for your own, my heart’s gleam.” Tony doesn't care any longer. The secrets and deceptions are meaningless compared to being held by the lover he had believed he lost.
Doused in kerosene.
His stomach sinks, heavy and metallic as if filled with lead, but then, he realizes what Iron Man is doing about it.
you felt, it was all thanks to that microscopic foreign mind-controlling device. It was all for the Chitauri’s gain, it was all to destroy us. All you felt was a manipulation aimed to get us all
His room was cold, and vast, and empty, empty,
Tony tries not to stare at how gorgeous Steve looks, slumped over his food, eyelids heavy and pink lips slightly parted. A song he’s never heard plays on a single speaker somewhere in the corner of the small restaurant. The words are sung in Turkish, maybe? Probably.
Steve uselessly extended a hand to ground the brunet, but he had slipped out of reach. Tony had approached the raging fire in the corner of the lab. All Steve saw was a glint of metal in a modest crucible before pungent fumes ensnared him.
Frustrated and a little discouraged by this knowledge, Steve wondered what good it would do to broach the subject with Tony Stark. Until they finally met, and spent some time together, and Tony casually mentioned the perplexing subject.
He held them there a moment, searching Tony’s expression. It was a moment of complete and utter intimacy, both of them laid bare, sharing something so profound. He felt his cheeks heat, unsure if he was slightly embarrassed or simply adjusting to the complete vulnerability between them. All he knew for sure was that he felt astounding reverence for Tony.
“I would hope so.” Tony's words were biting, his face screwed up, eyes growing a bit watery. “Why are you being like that?”
“Eh, that’s the one Rhodey swears by. In all fairness I don’t think he’s actually tried it.”
. In his rage and desperation, he had been ready to destroy the suit, right then and there, to leave Tony, burn it to the ground, and run - but when he realized how defenseless and unprepared Tony was against him, he hesitated. He felt wide, brown eyes search his face frantically, and the next thing his mind registered was the loud clanging of vibranium against frigid concrete.
Tony stood before a freshly-thawed Captain America in a vacant common room of Stark Tower. Seven hours ago, Tony had woken from the dead of sleep, overcome by profound grief and loneliness unlike anything he’d ever felt before. It didn’t take long to find the source of his pain, and even less time for his silver tongue to convince Fury to release the super soldier to him.
“Fine, fine! He just kinda brushed it off, said he didn’t remember anything. ‘There’s nothing to talk about if I don’t remember!’ That bullshit. Have you tried talking to Cap?”
“What’s that?”
Tony jolts from a restless slumber, heaving to catch breath in his lungs, but no matter how hard he gasps, it just isn’t enough.
“Prefer it to what? Imprisonment?” He spits the words like ash from his mouth.
“You’re strong, Tony. Nothing’s gonna take you down. You’re invincible.
“There was a time when I would agree with you. But not any longer can I humor such a despicable notion.”
“For tonight, yeah.”
“Please tell me nobody kissed me-” He’s saying it like he knows what he’s saying - he doesn’t - and all he can think about is Steve-
He’s moving faster, and faster, hoping he’ll make it to the other side, until everything goes black.
He’s in love.
Steve was bewildered, and honestly didn’t know the answer. “Look, if we forget it,
.” This phrase finally stopped Tony’s spiraling, and Steve knew it was the only opportunity he would get to push forward. “You’ve overcome so much, Tony. You have. Not just survived -
“Tony, are you alright?” Steve sounds concerned, but Tony’s not entirely sure if there’s a hint of judgement to his sharp tone.
There were probably more bars here, maybe Steve had been taken to a more private section of the restaurant?
“Erm, well, no, not directly, at least, not anymore,” he admitted awkwardly. “Do you?”
And now, Steve sat tensely on the edge of an oversized couch, eyes darting around to observe every stimulus. His expression was neutral, but Tony knew there was immense suffering hiding behind his furtive eyes.
“There’s more incoming - team, you know what to do!” Steve commands.
“Fury and Hill think it has to do with Cap’s shield. It isn’t operating as it once did. Tony compromised it to make a wedding ring. And rumor is that he carved out a piece of his reactor to combine with the vibranium, but Stark won’t confirm.”
“God, Tony, you look so good,” he moaned as he trailed kisses and alluring caresses across his skin.
“Right pocket,” Tony grabbed his pants from the floor and tossed them to Steve. There he found a small bottle of lube.
“Probably shouldn’t ‘ve told you.” Steve’s voice was low, almost a growl he was unable to contain.
No, he never loved me.
Steve lets go of the hand he’s been holding to wrap his robust arms around and pull Tony the rest of the way into his lap.
“Uh, Steve?” Tony asked in a startled voice. “Are you, uh,
Steve lets out a laugh - a genuine laugh, and Tony is suddenly at a loss for words.
am I listening to Pink Floyd?” Steve dispatches the attacker and leaps forward, on to the next target.
“You’re more deplorable than the tales describe. I never imagined the good Captain would be capable of such atrocities.” He can barely choke the words out. He’s seething, and shattered in a way he hadn’t thought possible, but would rather die than let Nomad know how broken he really is.
