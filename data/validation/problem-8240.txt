“I like him.”
"Thirty-seven," Steve corrected. "Thirty-eight, if you count me rescuing my own dumb ass."
“STEVE!”
“Don’t mind me.”
“Is what the money?”
“Big mistake.”
? Steve had heard that question too many times over the past few days. He tried to phrase it in a way Tony would not only understand, but in a way that would get him to believe the words.
"You got a hot date, or something?"
He didn't say anything else, just allowed that thought to linger.
“Uh—”
“I don’t see that happening.”
“Probably the next time your government agencies forget to coordinate with each other.”
"And I need this."
"Tony is a lot more than that."
“Go ahead.”
That earned him another smile. He understood, then, that this was Tony's comfort zone. Banter was something he could do, and it was as good a place to start as any.
"Sometimes I don't think you know," Tony replied. "But you're hiding something from me. Pep won't tell me, so it has to be big."
"It's an arc reactor. Same thing that powers this tower and my house in Malibu, but smaller. There's a magnet in here that keeps the metal away from my heart. Yinsen helped me build it." Tony angrily pulled the undershirt down to cover it up again. "Sacrificed everything to help me."
“He’s …” Sam tilted his head. “Hot, in a broken, Midwestern, loner in high school who joined the military and saw too much shit kind of way.”
Because the last time Tony mentioned Afghanistan they ended things on the spot. Or perhaps it was because Steve didn't want to feel any closer to Tony than he needed to be.
He blinked.
"Good week?"
"You don't have to sleep with him! Just make the world, especially the board, believe you're dating him. He will take you to lunch and you can take him to dinner. Have some overnights at his penthouse and go to a few galas with him. Stop him from throwing things at photographers and, most importantly, keep him from making an ass of himself in public.”
Steve reached across the table and said, perfectly neutral, "Nice to meet you."
“Busy.”
"First question, how did you two meet?"
“But I could die.”
Then Steve stopped cooking.
Tony wrapped his arms around his middle and curled into himself, abandoning his milkshake to stare at the table.
"I am sorry, Tony. I told you that I wouldn't leave unless you asked me to, so this is me not leaving."
"You know you don't have to hide from me, right?"
“Steve, you know I am never busy in a way I
“You, mostly.”
was calling it. Steve’s whirlwind “romance” with a billionaire tech mogul. Monday was filled with Tony Stark. Tuesday had been all about Tony Stark and then Steve left. On Wednesday ... Well, Steve hadn't meant to type "tony stark" into Google, his fingers did it of their own volition. He stared at five different photos of his own face plastered on the phone screen beneath headlines like, "Tony Two-Dates" and "Another One Bites the Dust.” Steve rolled his eyes; it had been a dumbass move to walk out the front door. He barreled right through the photographers and hailed the first cab he saw.
Then the line went dead.
Steve jumped as a disembodied robotic voice rang inside the lift. The elevator doors closed, but none of the floor buttons were illuminated as it began its ascent.
Sam shrugged and admitted, “He’s not my type.”
"It is on the 61st floor, sir."
Steve glanced at himself in the mirror before brushing his teeth. He looked relaxed, and Steve supposed that was a good thing. There were so many moments over the past ten years when he assumed he would end up like his father: a soldier dead because he was in the right place at a bad time. But now? Steve had Tony Stark and his robots and the biggest tech company in the world.
“Tony’s not certain about their relationship yet,” said Contessa Valentina Allegra de la Fontaine. “Steve Rogers is a new toy, shinier than the toys he’s had before. Steve’s paid for all the dates and they were set up by Tony’s ex. Steve is too good for him and Tony knows it. End of story, really. There’s no way Steve sticks around because Tony will fuck it up. I give it a month.”
Sam chuckled then nodded to Natasha.
“It overlaps sometimes.”
“I know.”
my money.”
“Oh.”
“That’s good.” Tony nodded. “He likes to feel superior to me.”
The room felt bigger than it was. A large, half-circle couch dominated the center of the room. Steve took note of a coffee table and a few scattered chairs, then the work desk shoved toward the right side of the room like an afterthought. A well-stocked bar ran along the back of the room, but it was the floor-to-ceiling windows that took Steve's breath away.
” Steve sagged backward in his chair and tossed the fork onto his plate. “How could you think it was about money? I made you dinner tonight because I wanted to eliminate the barriers I put up between us. None of my feelings for you are artificial. I wanted to date you, Tony.”
"It's your room," Tony countered.
the way I shoulda been for her. I wasn’t man enough to do that. I don’t wanna fly across the Atlantic just to watch my life play out in somebody else’s.”
"Ah, shit, my ma is rolling over in her grave." Steve dragged his palm across his face and glanced up at the ceiling. "She told me never to swear on the first date."
"Before me, how many people knew about your sexual preferences?"
Steve chuckled and admitted, "I don't understand much of it, but I do like watching him work. Watching things go from a bunch of blue holograms to scraps to a fully-formed prototype? It's art."
Steve hopped up from the seat and Tony ran down to take his place. Steve gave the DJ his selection, knowing it was cheesy as hell, and trudged up the stairs on the side of the stage. He sighed as he took the microphone and jokingly began,
“Seriously?” Sam sighed and shook his head. “What the hell is stopping you?”
Steve frowned. He didn’t answer.
"No," Steve insisted, "I honor my commitments."
That was the name Steve settled on. He asked and Rhodey said anything was fine. Steve settled on Rhodey because it was what Tony called him. Not James.
“Request taken under advisement. Potential problems have been identified. First, I’m here and you are all the way over there. Second, you’re taller than me so I’d need either a stool or a running start. Third and, most importantly, I like when
"Planters?"
"It's quite the thing."
“Red, white, and blue,” Steve quipped.
"It is not a competition."
"He's an asshole."
“I know a good place.”
“No, Tony—”
"A lot of things happened in Austria, Mr. Stark. You need to be more specific."
The elevator dinged and Steve made a face. Tony laughed.
"Yes. If you can't handle it, you better leave now because that was nothing."
“Yes,” von Doom smiled. He offered his hand, which Steve accepted. “Aldrich was speaking about you. Seems you pissed him off a few weeks back.”
“Sleep with him and call me immediately after it happens.”
Steve's phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out and saw it was a text from the number saved under Pepper Potts.
than I truly do.”
“I’d really like that. Tony hasn’t met any of my friends; you’re all overseas.”
“That’s one thing I can’t understand. If you loved Barnes so much, why don’t you blame the military for taking him away from you?”
Tony sprinted over and stuffed at least half a slice down his throat.
Steve nodded to the cameras and asked, "Tourists?"
, Steve. My thing that I have to do. That is the very
“You said you liked this Sousa guy.”
"Well now I'm asking you," Sam quipped. "What did you think of Stark?"
“Because this is meant to be fake, a setup, a convenient arrangement for Tony to get a reputation boost and keep what is rightfully his. If this was fake, I wouldn’t have answers.”
“I know I’m not one for being early—”
“That’s different. This company is my legacy, my business, my blood, sweat, tears, and my fucking
“I’m gonna go back to sleep now.”
The worst part was that Tony was not entirely wrong. Steve wanted to move on from Bucky because that love held him back, but he didn't know how to move on without forgetting the way Bucky made him feel. Steve never wanted to lose that. At least he was certain of one thing ...
He bounced those words around in his mind because they were true. Steve didn't want to leave Bucky in the past, didn't want to forget their friendship like it meant nothing. Even though they couldn't be together, their friendship had been the most important, most real thing throughout Steve's life. But his ma said,
He stayed in his apartment the next day and only turned on the TV for noise. Steve cleaned for awhile, and when that was done he had a sandwich delivered. Wednesday slowly wasted away and the only thing that kept him moving was knowing he had somewhere to be on Thursday.
"—he will meet you for dinner later, awake and sober, to make a real first impression. There will be people there with cell phones, so photos will surface quickly and the circus will begin. But this way it will appear more authentic."
A half hour later, the limo came to a stop on a familiar street. Steve could see Tony walking down from the end of the block, the same block where Steve had Thorapy each Thursday. At least, Steve was fairly certain that was Tony walking toward them. Happy opened the door moments later. Tony looked in, caught one glimpse of Steve, then stepped backward.
“So tell me, which of those things scares you more?”
She winked and insisted, “You’ve got better tits, though.”
“Then consider the contract void as of today.”
"Aye, aye, Cap'n!"
Steve replied, "I have a VA group for that."
"Good evening, Captain Rogers."
“Tony doesn’t believe in pauses. With me and Buck, for so many years there were these pauses in the middle of conversations because we couldn’t say something. Long, agonizing silences where everyone could
“You’re right.”
“No, Happy is not a fucking carpool, Steve! You can’t call him up when you feel like it and expect him to be there.”
"Captain Steven Grant Rogers."
Colonel Rhodes walked toward Steve, hand outstretched. He accepted the handshake as Rhodes continued to smile at him. Tony had an adorably confused expression on his face.
He did a quick turn to take it all in then smiled at Steve.
Tony offered, "Fuckbuddy?"
“How much time do you spend on your bed, staring at the ceiling?”
Steve warily asked, "Where are you?"
“I talked to Peggy yesterday,” Natasha said as they made their way to the elevator.
“Quite well, quite well,” she replied, voice hoarse from years of smoking. “People’ve been comin’ in here, talkin’ about you.”
“It means people like you should carry a tree wherever you go because you aren’t worth all the oxygen you're wasting."
Dr. Gilbert frowned and wondered, “What the hell does that mean?”
Miss Potts smiled.
Steve opened his front door and gestured for Tony to go inside. As if guided by the smell, he walked right into the kitchen. There wasn’t enough room in Steve’s apartment for an official dining room, so he made due in the small space across from the pantry. Steve locked the door behind them then rushed over to pull out a chair. Tony rolled his eyes but Steve thought he secretly appreciated the gesture. There was a lot that he didn’t want to reveal, but Steve was learning to read him. Tony rested one ankle on top of the opposite knee and leaned back in the chair.
"I'm sorry for bringing up your workshop. I didn't ..." Steve paused and turned Tony so they were face-to-face. "It never occurred to me that it was your private space, but it should have."
Steve followed Tony through the store and watched as he pulled stuff off shelves only to let gravity take it into the cart. He narrated everything, explaining each decision with as little enthusiasm as possible.
Nat high-fived him and said, “Four-for-four.”
to call was Tony.
Tony grinned up at Steve, whose heart nearly jumped out of his chest.
“Stay here, Steve. Live your life, go on your runs, go to the VA … I don’t want to push you to change everything.”
Dr. Madani nodded then asked, "Who else would like to share?"
of things, Steve. And after I’d gotten done with my talk all anybody wanted to ask me about was you. Which is great because I like you. I like you a lot and I haven’t known you long but most people would’ve left by now. You did leave, but you came back and it was
-An engagement ring for Wong. -he kept his purse and set out to leave. -and you're going to help me choose, roll.
-Before we begin with the explanation, I hope you don't mind that I've warned others.
Peter only laughed at the faces of his parents, That smile was pure evil, clear in a good way.
In that the chestnut hurried to reach his partner and hugged her very strong. –You are my hero Steve...
Ring (IronStrange) Part I
-Will you shut up? –He got angry. –perhaps it was fear.
-by God... –sighed the scientist. –but why don't you tell your boyfriend to save you?
-Child. --said Clint. --Nobody said anything.
-Fuck! He's coming this way! –the chestnut quickly receded and the blond did the same. –S-he stopped... –sighed with relief.
After that encounter with the captain, the Winter Soldier returned to the room of his Kotenok to see if he was already better.
-Steve. –The chestnut turned to see the love of his life, his eyes shone, he knew that his blond would take care of the problem. –What happens is that...
-We got a warning. Gamora spoke, watching everyone closely. --And Peter wanted to participate because he's in love with Tony.
Plump (WinterIron) part IV
-What? The Sorcerer was astonished. -Of course not, I would never deceive you because you are all I need to live...
-Get the out of the way, Stark's upset. –How about I come up and jump!
-Hi guys. –Bruce saluted, was entering the hallway when he noticed the behavior of his friends. –What do you see? –approached them. –Oh... so that's it.
A the office came the guardians of the galaxy. --We are the guardians of the galaxy and we are here for the contract. --said Peter Quill very excitedly.
-Of course not Kotenok... -smiled fondly. -You're beautiful.
-I don't know...
-Tony! –Ran into the living room. -I came as soon as I saw the message! What's wrong!?
-I do not want to interrupt, but... –Began Clint. –We have a problem.
Spent a few minutes when they heard the elevator doors open again, but this time they heard some steps that were heard in a refined way.
-Here it is...-He kissed the child's cheek to what he only laughed at what his father did.
The captain removed the curtains from the shower and opened the door with Peter holding another shampoo container upside down spilling all its contents.
-It's typical of you... — said the spy.
Just when Tony came in and saw all the candidates smiled, did not know that he had so many people behind him, however his smile was erased when a certain Titan came in.
-our son.-The blond stressed him.
-Wow, what did you tell him? -questioned Sam.
The chestnut came to the corner with no worries when suddenly he stopped dry, he carved his eyes to know that what he was seeing was real, indeed, it was.
-What do you propose? –The philanthropist looked earnestly at his friend.
IronStrange
They spent a few minutes when the door of the elevator was heard, the two Avengers did not turn, they knew that with only a second that the lost sight of this one would escape and then they could not sleep by means that their new enemy wanted to take revenge.
-I'll also participate in this contract. -- talked Thanos. -- With Stark next to me the universe will be balanced.
-The last time I saved you from something, even if it's simple, Steve got jealous because he wanted to be the one to help you. –He frowned only to remember that. –He wanted to be your knight.
-I like you to be cheesy...-said the chestnut tenderly.--let's eat.
-I also wish to participate in conquering the hearts of the tin man.
-the same I say Legolas.
-that was... Cute... In a way, my love. — He approached the child and no matter what other eyes would be upon them, he kissed the millionaire. -That's one of the things I fell in love with you...
-Listen to me Anthony, I love you more than you imagine. -He held Stark's face. -I love you. -and right after he kissed him on the lips. They lasted a few seconds until they were separate. -Who told you You were fat?
-do not ask how the he came here because we do not know. –said the archer.
-I think they like it....
And continued to observe several rings, looking for a special one for someone special.
Tony had come to the sanctuary at Stephen's request; They had about two years of being boyfriends. He had asked him to accompany him to buy some things.
-Good. --The blond had the bridge of his nose. --The first clau... --and as if by magic it was interrupted again.
Peter watched him with those big eyes that both remind her of her husband, then turned and watched what he was doing, and then looked at his father again. -Dad...-he talked, Steve laughed about it, his son was blaming Tony.
-To the others? The blond was confused. --Why?
-Come on Tony. "The Sorcerer encouraged him." -he asked me to please because right now he's arranging for the wedding... If it makes you feel good, I found out a few days ago.
The blonde watched everyone, was silent for a few seconds before continuing, it wasn't going to be for someone else to come in and interrupt him, that was already fed up. --Well, continuous, the first rule of the contract is ... -- and again it was interrupted, to which the blonde only took his hand to his face.
-A Goliath spider, to be exact. –commented J.A.R.V.I.S.
-and I know... but it's getting on my nerves.
-I think so...
-Steve... -he recharged in the other's shoulder.
-by the way... -he got confused. -Why do I have to keep it?
-It was Wong's request, not mine and you know I respect that...
Okay, really no one expected such a character wanting to participate in the contract called "Conquer Tony Stark." Now all you needed to do was specify the contract and sign it. Who would take the heart of genius?
-I hope he's not late. --spoke Clint who was coming in. -- but Bucky didn't specify the time and I also want to participate in the contract to win over Tony.
-You do it. –Ordered the millionaire to the archer.
The Sorcerer looked curiously at the rings, wondering what the ideal would be. -What do you like Tony? Do you think this is the right one? Isn't it too expensive?
-I don't think it's right to kill her. –He said and immediately felt the eyes full of fury of his partner. –I mean, let me get her out of here. –The blonde major went to the kitchen and returned with a large plastic container, slowly approached the arachnid and in a fast movement caught the tarantula. He placed the lid on him and made him one small hole for the oxygen to enter, then left it on a ledge. –See? It wasn't that hard. Tomorrow I'll make sure to take her where she belongs.
-I'm afraid to lose him. -he shrugged his shoulders.
-Do you think he wants revenge? –asked Clint without taking his eyes off his enemy.
-I support Tony. –followed him Barton.
-who was it?
-it's for you. —The sorcerer smiled, he rose from his seat and placed himself on the right side of the millionaire. -I want to spend the rest of my life by your side, to see you and make you smile, to be for you in times of need and above all to protect yourself and make you happy. -Knelt . —Anthony Stark, Will you marry me?
-Hey! -- complained Quill. --Stardust will be mine.
-Yes, it's a huge fucking spider. –Cursed the chestnut.
-Hi Tony, what are you doing? –He asked with his typical mocking half-tone, when he came close enough he noticed what his companion was seeing. –Wow! –He stood next to the chestnut tree as his eyes enlarged.
-No... Dad. --and with that he realized that he meant Tony.
Peter just plowed a year-old baby and four months, despite his age was very intelligent but innocent, with his face could melt anyone. That day Steve went into the bathroom and found a bottle of empty shampoo, so he could tell, someone had spilled all the contents of the container on the floor.
“Tony! Open up!”
“How long will it take?”
“Don’t tell me you can’t see the ingenuity in this system.”
“The Mandarin?” Steve frowns. “I heard the name on the radio.”
“I’m asking… for your kindness. I know I’m asking a lot. Maybe too much, and out of place. I owe you… my life, Tony. Everything that I have now, a home, a renewed purpose. I owe it all to you.”
Tony. One minute of inactivity and he’s fidgeting like a kid with a rash.
“May I recommend Mark 35 then, the Disaster Rescue Suit you named ‘Red Snapper’?”
“It’s fine. I got you.”
“Yeah? Watch me –” and he’s suddenly pinned against the side of the car, his front flushed against the window. Zippers, so many zippers bite into his chaffed flesh while Steve and his dead weight is all but against him. “Get off me.”
bracketed by Steve’s arms, chest pressed up against the door. When will he ever learn his place?
The tips of his fingers are glowing bright orange. His skin has gone translucent.
“Steve?”
undergoing liquidation of some sort…”
And they call bullshit on that one. Clint makes for his knee and Tony flinches so hard the couch he’s sitting on propels backward by an inch. “
Never mind that Ghost is probably the root of all problems. They can only play with the cards they’re dealt with.
exit that the Agents did not just come through.
“Better?”
Tony stops dead in his track when he catches an unidentified figure kneeling before their headstones. This is private property. The hospice and Foundation complex out front are accessible by the public, sure, but this is blatant trespassing. And for this shmuck to come all the way here without alerting security? Tony flexes his right wrist where he wears a red and gold bracelet, while his left tightens around the handle of his umbrella. He approaches in tiptoes, the light tap of PVC sole on granite drowned out by the cascade of rain around them.
“It’s fine.” Tony pulls the zip down and Steve’s cock springs immediately into view. Man has been walking around commando the entire journey from the Triskelion to Malibu? “It’s
“Come to Papa!”
“That was reckless behaviour.”
Holding the last of Tony’s weakened smile in his thoughts and prayers, he secures Tony’s torso in the crook of one arm, and steadies the rod with the other. And he pulls.
Eight sharp, Steve drops by the Avengers’ dining room for breakfast. Solitude is money, and so is Tony, so Steve’s heels squeak to a halt at the sight of Tony in the flesh, shoving gluten-free waffles down his throat.
Face frozen without expressions, the intruder strides over, and would’ve closed the distance –
“Invited. It was Operation Paperclip after World War II. SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic values. They thought I could help their cause. I also helped my own.” Zola’s mugshot fades out, and is immediately replaced by a silhouette of the Red Skull, and the ominous HYDRA emblem.
Tony doesn’t comment for a long while. He deliberates while he continues picking his leaves and debris, and even uses his handkerchief – actually Steve’s, he gave it to Tony to mop up nosebleeds – to scrub off traces of mud over Maria’s name.
God, what took them so long?
– he couldn’t walk away. Before he got his stuffing punched out, this tall boy suddenly swooped in and kicked everybody’s asses into Sunday. Steve thanked him, shook his hands, and they traded names.
riddling the backseat. Steve loses control of the car and swerves sharply into the divider, but Tony doesn’t see anything tumbling off with the inertia. The impact activates their airbags, dousing yet another stream of screeching expletives.
“But, I can get us into Insight. Before he attacked, I was going through SHIELD’s databases and cracking the drive. I’ll be honest, the drive itself wasn’t very interesting. The syntax was foreign to me – which is quite a blow to my ego. But
All evidences pointed to the pink of health. Nothing was wrong save for the pool of biological damnation in his lap.
to go there either.
“Always so polite. Is anti-dandruff good?”
“Think about it, Tony. Your programme enhances facial and vocal recognition, capable of tracking unique characteristics like walking gaits and speech pattern to generate identity fingerprints with high fidelity by using a network of CCTVs. It’s not perfect. I’m not sure if cosmetic alterations and good acting can fool your cameras, but it’s better than what we have at the moment.”
Steve, pulling his punches because his mortal friends can’t handle the beating. Tony grunts under Steve’s hulking body, and turns them around so
Tony’s legs grow pliant by the knees, and the view –
What’s available of the Avengers, anyway.
“Needy, huh?”
“Red, white and blue!”
Steve’s chapped lips burn against his skin. His shirt is a day’s old and doesn’t smell like fabric softener anymore. It still gets in the way, and Steve growls when he can’t access more than he should like. It all goes down to Tony’s crotch. He needs a sign. He elbows Steve gently in the ribs. He grits his teeth against the little gasps he would’ve unleased and regretted.
“Yeah, I’m gonna stop you right there. And you’re gonna say that the Avengers don’t get despatched much for those kinds of threats, since we’re doing run-of-the-mill jobs that people below our paygrade can do. So, might as well up and join SHIELD for the challenge.”
Tony feels
Not enough. Stupid shirt –
“I know him.”
That midnight though, SHIELD demands an urgent teleconference with the Avengers because of suspicious electromagnetic activities in a country off the coast of Mediterranean – Sokovia. That’s when the issue gets hairy. SHIELD has no representatives there, and neighbouring allies are reluctant to offer entryway across their borders. Why SHIELD think the Avengers will be of any help is anybody’s guess, Steve thinks darkly as he strokes the “A” printed on the forehead of his cowl.
Fingernails graze the underside of Tony’s buttocks. At the first twitch, Steve withdraws his hands. He returns with a firm nudge around the knees, and Tony parts his legs obligingly. He doesn’t remember if massages often proceed this way – Steve is showing his inner thighs a good time, and again, fingernails scrape relentlessly against his bare skin.
He quickly wriggles his index finger, and Steve releases him with a loving shove. Just to be clear. Tony swivels his chair around and points at him, “You. Is this your van?”
the road less travelled. This is
It’s the sanest thing he’s heard this morning. It probably shows on his face because Tony gives up his pretence,
“Captain Rogers, do you receive?”
“Come on, come on.”
“I’ll see you at breakfast,” he says, and he drops them in Tony’s palm. What else is there to add? Should he give his thanks for the entertainment? It had been such fun. But, when Tony takes his keys without a word, without even looking at him in the eyes and walks up the stairs without ado, Steve knows sleep won’t come easily tonight.
“It’s five-thirty,” Steve whispers as he combs Tony’s hair briefly with his fingers. It took a while for Tony to fall asleep, even after he commandeered Steve’s left thigh for his pillow. “You up?” Steve hand had rested atop the arc reactor for some glorious three hours the night before. Sometimes, he tapped a steady
Multiple silhouettes dawn on them, and Steve pushes Tony behind him. “Get back!”
This time, it’s for real. He’s alert, his senses linger on – which means, everywhere is perpetually hurting, and it’s intensifying – and he has no idea how to
Just one lousy second before he replies, “Yes.”
“For the car? That drawer.”
The hands go down, down, down, and they clamp around the knees. There’s a bit of force applied, and Tony unfolds his legs, letting them hang freely off the bed like he’s straddling it. He much prefers his lotus pose, this one is not great for balance, so he’s forced to lean backward into Steve’s chest.
My judgement isn’t any more inferior to yours. ‘Enemy mistakes are lucky only in the respite gained. Being observant, thoughtful, and
“… You want to make it go away?”
to spell it out to the politest person on Earth who wouldn’t take anything for granted. So, he does the whole rigmarole – tells Steve that there’s always a room for him at the Tower, that he welcomes Steve’s company anytime.
“It doesn’t stop there, Steve.” Tony scrolls further down, his brows knitting even closer. “More than half of the Senate members are here. Uh,
“You sound surprised.”
He keeps at it. He’s
“We’re uniquely positioned to cornering the immunotherapy market. Our proprietary platform has consistently produced T-cells that are sensitive towards target antigens, and showed extended survival
Tony was right.
Clint is nocking three arrows onto his bowstrings. Steve doesn’t have to watch on to confirm if they meet their targets. Tony winces when Clint whoops at the mini-Chernobyl he has going on in his shooting range, and sticks a finger into his ear. “If I stay here any longer, I’m gonna bust an eardrum.”
holding unit for said alien tech fifty miles out, and the enemies are evacuating. Nobody is fast enough, hardy enough to intercede, and all manpower are tied to the Cineplex. Steve considers taking the Quinjet down himself when
“Morning,” Tony grunts, not bothering to even grace Steve with a glance. His eyes are glued to the newspapers, a shallow frown set on his features. Steve shuffles to the counter for coffee when from the corner of his eyes, he spots Natasha and Clint tapping on the remote frantically. He tracks the direction said remote is pointed at, and takes a cursory look at the TV screen, and… boom.
He almost pulls the driver’s door off its hinges. In the darkness though, the tablet Tony passes to him outside of Fury’s operation theatre shines so brightly on his dashboard it sears into his retinas.

that Steve has snuck into his pocket. It’s nondescript, having muted metallic sheen without engravings or sticky labels to at least clue him in on what to expect when he plugs it into a computer. He checks his suits again, makes sure they’re all still downloading whatever JARVIS is feeding them.
“No,” Tony shakes his head, “Bionic Man was in my house because he wanted Stark Tech. Blueprints, schematics, freaking doodles. I think he even went through my thrash. Point is,” he kneads his temple with the heel of his palm, “Someone is poaching technology and information – very likely for weaponizing Insight. SHIELD pins everything on Nick, and sics Bionic Man on him to close the loop. Pierce stinks something funny. I looked up Insight’s database. They require Nick
“... That would be funnier yesterday.” And thunder claps above them. They just can’t catch a break, can they? Steve draws away, and thumbs at the bag under Tony’s eye. “You’re burning up.”
So, Steve follows Tony back into the kitchen, and retakes the spot he stood at not too long ago. The tiles still feel warm.
“No, it’s not. Let go – it’s been a long day. What do you want from me?”
“Close your eyes. Deep breath.” His world darkens, and he trusts Steve’s mesmerising voice to guide his way. “Hold it in. Three, two… one. Exhale, slowly. Three, two, one. Deep breath… three, two, one…” Steve’s voice is a constant, his mantra of calm and reason, and it comes from his left. “Keep going. I’m starting the procedure.”
Tony left brow floats. “Say what?”
He scoots a safe distance away from Steve until it seems platonic enough to the public. The crunch under his butt tells him that Steve’s snuck something else inside his pocket during the heat of things. How clandestine.
“I want to hear a bedtime story.”
“I’m all ears.”
“You mean, you didn’t spend those hours weeping over my dead body.”
“CTO, then?”
After Steve leaves, Tony tucks himself painfully into his sweatpants, and wonder if the next time, he should also ask specifically for Steve. Just in case.
“I’ll have to stop you right there, yes? Pepper, Pepper,” he takes her hands gently in his, and she frowns a little. “OK, breathe. Come on, humour me. Breathe, hoo…” It makes her look like she’s giving birth, but that’s fine, too. Pepper being nervous makes
“And walking right into it is your plan?”
Steve hooks his arms under Tony’s and pulls. It’s so easy to dislocate a shoulder, snap a spine – so easy to hold this body hostage against Tony’s obnoxiousness. “I’m letting go of your left arm,” he mutters, hip still thrusting in rhythm. “Touch us,” and proceeds to stick his pelvis out the best he could so his cock, neatly stacked under Tony’s, is readily accessible. He’s considerate like that. “Come on, now.” His has a slight curve upward, and it’s frankly, supremely embarrassing to have it bump against Tony’s at the slightest shift. Some colour might have shown on his face, but this is his parade. He makes sure his prey is as good as stuck in a quicksand.
“ENIAC,” Tony exclaims triumphantly. The floorspace is almost completely occupied by hunks of metals with cables protruding from the back and
A camera is training on them. The ocular zooms in on Tony as he shifts to stand closer to Steve. “It’s some kind of recording,” he whispers, upon which the monitor buzzes, “I am
A cruel hand slides southward, from the toned expanse of Tony’s stomach to the mound between his thighs. Fingers close around the warmth and musk, and the rough texture of a Tom Ford slacks probably worth several months of room rental. He kneads at Tony’s hardness, incessantly, mercilessly, knuckles probing into crooks and undersides of flesh and bones.
“I’m thinking aloud here, JARVIS. Can we at least send him a message somehow? Tell him to stay put?”
I can’t have this!”
“It’s that drive.”
“No, I don’t. Is this one of your casual flings that you often brag about –”
The propulsion in his boots almost rips his legs from his hip. He’s feeling the tell-tale heat again, a sign that Extremis has been activated. He’s injured somewhere, and it does hurt, acutely. The best form of anaesthesia is just worrying about civilian death toll upon impact, should he fail.
He kicks the door off in one try – it’s already half-hanging from the hinge – and vaults over the divider. Why are there cars – God, why are there still cars coming this way? Tony runs like life demands it, waving maniacally and yelling at these suicidal drivers and motorcyclists to
Steve is beating around the bush, and Tony gets. Taking out SHIELD is no different from setting up explosives in select corners of a childhood home and watching it implode. “You have a home here with me, Steve,” he blurts out, and inwardly swears when Steve slowly turns to face him again. “With the company. Pepper loves you.”
“HYDRA is not a one-man outfit, Rogers. If we take him out, someone else would replace him.”
“My wallet, Rogers.”
He’d think the douchebags that keep stealing his works and turning them against him would’ve wizened up by now. His doodles, his designs, his engines, his ship. “
“No. Nothing on Iron Man or you.”
Since he’s already “borrowing” the battery…
He feels the Extremis clawing inside him, begging to be released as his own frustration and mounting anger strokes it. “Pepper, leave us.”
“Yeah, I saw it.”
finish first. Before he can protest – or burn Steve’s cock that’s still embedded inside him – Steve flips over to his knees, and thrusts into him, twice.
Steve closes the gap between them, his forehead resting on Tony’s. The stench of a hard-won battle and… near-death infiltrates his senses. He bathes in it. His heart pumps with renewed vigour, and he knows Tony
“There’s a lot of interest in the company’s mission and future direction after the Expo. Some people remember what your father wanted for the country post-War, and they have their eyes set on the next prototypes we’re rolling out from our labs.”
“… Remember the repulsor engines we spoke about last time?”
“Yeah, heard of some.” As far as he knows, the Avengers quarters are as barren as it could be. Just the two of them occupying this floor, the others either on covert SHIELD operations or not in this galaxy. Which means…
“How well is the soundproofing?” Tony eventually gasps, both arms raised above his head to grab at his pillows. “I don’t think – don’t think I can hold back anymore.”
in my chest, it’s almost constant nowadays. I’m dying, Steve. Could be the shrapnel finally doing me in. Or the poison. Listen to me – I’m saying, there’s enough blood on my hands. Yours is the
“We need to talk.” Steve shuts the door behind him, and leans against it. “About the mission just now.”
That aside, all in all, it's a good day's work. Steve attends debriefing at the Triskelion alone wearing a mild expression of one suffering from a case of hemorrhoid. His temper sizzles when Fury holds the door open an extra two seconds after he walks in, clearly expecting someone else and asks, “Where’s Stark? I thought he arrived last minute to the party.” And then, cutting right to the chase, let's say Fury uses very stern words while addressing the risks of engaging targets in remote. They’re lucky there wasn’t a misfire or situations that necessitate someone making
That one is weird. He frowns, and wonders why a hitman this honed will bother with publicly known information. “With SHIELD. There’s a meeting.”
“Yes, Sir?”
“Whoa –”
Down, down, down Steve goes, rubbing along Tony’s thighs, knees, shins and ankles, before coming back up to slide a hand up along an inner thigh, ending
But, it’s all about to change.
“Shit –”
“I wonder if you want to come with me?”
“Can I have a word with you? In private?”
Eyes up here, Rogers. I
It doesn’t stop Tony from fiddling with it as Steve drives them to a row of semi-completed house-ish structures. Despite arriving earlier, Steve hasn’t been going around the neighbourhood shopping for the best unit to squat in. From here, this one seems good enough to take shelter from the elements. It’s also the closest to the road.
to be said. “That’s a battery… to power my pacemaker.” Talking consumes too much air. He needs air he can’t get.
He’s going to die.
“That’s not allowed!” Steve hisses, drawing the curtains to a complete close behind them.
“It’s my pleasure we’re caring about today, not yours. Get down here. Blow me.”
He quickly adjusts his shirt and goes into the drive gear.
inflates his lungs. His own face is steaming, and Steve runs a thumb carefully along his cheekbone. “Find out what’s on the drive.”
“I’m –”
and without sparing Tony another glance, has his attention turned to the disassembled Mark 42.
Steve has never wanted to run through doors so bad his knees are bending. So, what then, now that Tony has essentially invalidated his fears while
“Accessing archive.” The mugshot of a man in his thirties with an impossibly high forehead is next projected. The name “Johann Schmidt” is scribbled over it. “HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom. What we did not realise, was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist. The war taught us much. Humanity needed to surrender its freedom
“… I’m loyal to the cause, Cap. I have been, and always will be.”

“I don’t know, Sir.”
“I’ve a bad feeling about this.”
“Rogers secured.”
Steve breaks contact first.
can’t keep his mouth shut about him currently-not-dying a couple of months ago. “Whatever he told you, it’s over. I’m fine. Pink of health.”
. We look out for each other. Anyway, I’m uh, going up now. Haven’t eaten a thing since supper.”
“… Sure. What can we do for you?”
Fated, huh?
Steve Rogers is a wanted man.
“I should be back in ten minutes. If not, call SHIELD for backup.”
Be that as it may, he instructed Tony to secure the perimeter while he land the Quinjet, and to rendezvous at the hangar in ten. So naturally, Tony strolled down the lower decks all on his own. Five minutes later, Steve heard screams and grunts blaring from his earpiece and he landed the Quinjet on water and swam all the way onboard. By the time he reached Tony in one of the storerooms, he was greeted with what he could only describe as pandemonium. There were char marks in every corner, courtesy of the repulsor blasters, and a battalion of heavily armed individuals strewn lifelessly around them. All incapacitated via non-lethal means, of course, but it sure was a drag triaging them, and then securing lifeboats and rescue choppers to cart them off to the nearest hospital, and then staying back to sweep the area for evidence – intact and destroyed.
Steve sets his food on the table and pads over to Tony’s bed. He notes the minutest tension in those shoulders, and deliberately shuffles across as loudly as he can without making it ominous. A head’s up, so to speak, for his approaching. And Tony settles back into his mattress, his back still steadfastly against Steve.
“A quick analysis on Insight’s security programme indicates that files requiring level four clearance and above are guarded by biometrics. It’s impossible to bypass those with the amount of time we have left.” With that, JARVIS conveniently displays a countdown timer on the top right corner of Tony’s tablet, and it says they have three minutes left before someone picks up their trail.
Not a muscle in the man’s face twitch as he pulls the trigger. The last on Tony’s mind is a sharp stab mere centimetres below his arc reactor, and he’s gone before he hits the floor.
“Is anyone gonna come in?”
Tony jumps – but his collar snags and it cuts so deeply into his throat, his vision whites out – his side feels mercilessly cold, and the loss of Steve’s warmth so vivid. His body slams onto the heated tarmac that sends him curling into himself. A mechanical hand seizes him by the neck, lifting him bodily in the air. His feet find no purchase, and he struggles against the choking restrain.
“Shit, shit - back up, back the fuck up!”
Four thirty sharp, Tony emerges fresh from the shower and strolls into Steve’s designated room. Steve is already waiting, the bed prepared and the lights dimmed. There’s no expectation, no signs, no preambles, and Tony’s got his game face on. He’s the man, the alpha, and no amount of teases and sexual gratification will shake him up and his identity. He lies on his back with his legs parted from the get-go, his cock already at full mass in his pants.
going on?
Steve’s hands leave his body momentarily and Tony hears spurts of oil. It makes him think of a couple of things, neither are wholesome, and when the hands slap over the patch of skin over his hip, Tony almost yelps. The hands are warm, so much warmer than before, so much
compare to his surging grief.
but he’s not-seeing, and hyperventilates, and falls into unconsciousness again –
What’s new about this anyway that sends him up the wall, making him so anxious and jumpy? Sex has always been his go-to choice of entertainment. There’s sadly no cunts in the vicinity, but handjobs are handjobs. If Steve keeps his mouth shut as Tony closes his eyes and pretends there’s a set of boobs hanging in his face, he’s golden.
“Why does it matter, you and I? You need this as much I do. May I, Tony?” Steve’s nose nuzzles against the crook of his shoulder. He’s
His senses returned, and his surroundings snap into coherency.
“Touch yourself.”
“Where’s Nick’s pen drive?” Nick trusted him with it, with his dying breaths. There must be something incriminating in it that puts a crosshair on his head. “What’s in it?”
“… We need to make a compelling case for the people to reject SHIELD.”
“We called your room this afternoon but you didn’t pick up. Natasha was wondering if you forgot to book a slot today.”
Stuck in a 36- by 36-inch cubicle with a speechless Tony Stark can’t get more awkward than this.
And Steve almost tumbles off the stool. “Before something happens that can’t be undone,
another streak of out-of-character display. Not from Pepper, whom he believes would be the last sane person standing on Earth, all things considered.
. Looking at the floor wirings, I bet there are explosives involved.” Which is English for “cornered like a rat” without means to escape to ground level short of triggering those piezo themselves and setting everything off. The hostages are as hapless as their potential rescuers. “I’m going in alone.”
“Yeah? Like I said, answer your phone next time.”
“Punishment does not come before the crime, General,” Steve grits out, the heart monitor beeping increasingly loud. “If there even is a crime.”
Where’s Steve in all this? Steve, Maria, Fury if he’s able – rejoice! Insight is –
But it wasn’t… bad. It wasn’t bad at all. It was decent. More than decent. Tony leaves Steve a large tip with the lady attending to him at the front desk. This neither changes nor validates anything. It’s providing reward commensurate to the quality of service rendered.
No, no, no –
” he raises his envelope to eye level before pulling out the documents it contained. “Is a comprehensive lab report of… shall we say,
Tony takes the cloth off Steve and pulls him up by his underarm. “Come on, we can talk while we shower.”
“Shall we continue where we left off, Mr Stark?”
Steve’s cries harshly, agony shooting up his shoulder and when he
“Only one way to find out,” he mumbles as he taps away on his tablet. “JARVIS?”
“… What?” This is the most forward people have ever been with him about the suits.
Spa Pendry calls his room direct three times in a row that afternoon, and Tony plain ignores them. One problem at a time, and he’s got a thousand and one others served on a silver platter. He puts on a well-worn tracksuit and heads for the gym, see if he could sweat all the bad luck out. Said gym is conveniently located on the same floor as the spa, but on the opposite wing. What are the odds of bumping into a staff from the fucking spa? He kills his phone, stows it into his pockets, and begins his descend to the fifth floor. The elevator door opens and –
sex recording Steve swears has been permanently etched into his retinas. Somehow, the buffering bar with the status “Deleting…” does not assuage the annoyance that is bubbling under Steve’s façade of nonchalance. He grips the handle of the floor-to-ceiling door – those implements that can only be moved by either machineries or three other men throwing their body weights at to get an inch of movement? – and effortlessly pulls at it that the door swings to a close and slams right behind him.
“Cap –”
“Go!”
of preparation to do it right. I’ll hurt you.”
“They want you now.”
“Not yet. I should’ve been.”
“How?” Tony disables internet access altogether on his laptop, and begins to pour over his data. “This is a name list, Steve, and it doesn’t tell us their current whereabouts. By the time we know that, it would’ve meant successful synchronisation between the Helicarriers and Insight satellites. We can’t win this one, Steve.”
In the starry night, their stolen car coasts along the country road. Every turn that Steve takes, he does so as gently as he can. The passenger seat is reclined all the way to the back, and on it Tony lies on his side, not stirring in the slightest. Occasionally Steve checks the makeshift blanket he’d arranged haphazardly over Tony’s body remains tucked under his shoulders. There’s no real need for the fuss really. Even when they run over a dead branch and the car trampolines, Tony never did respond.
“You look the type.”
Meaning, he’s not required to stay in the Tower any longer, and not required to work with Tony until and unless an interplanetary threat descends upon this good Earth.
back in New York. How do you do, Sir?”
“Stop molesting me like that,” Tony grits out, somehow managing to glare at Steve from this angle. “It’s distracting.”
“Where is he?”
“Where, huh? We’re in the middle of nowhere!”
before he’s thinking it, dry humping against Tony’s pelvis, cocks and balls gliding along each other. Too many clothes in between, but Tony is getting harder, and Steve is losing control.
Tony’s lips
“I still do. Stay close to me, stay behind the shield. Throw two more of that fireballs, and we go!”
Then, the door to his truck swings open and sunlight pours in – blindingly brilliant – and Tony shoves the paramedics to the side. He fully expects bullets of the deadliest calibre to riddle him through, but only one canister is thrown over his shoulder. White gas quickly fills up the space and – tear gas? – his eyes and his throat feel flayed. It won’t knock him out – he heals, remember? – so he suffers through them, and readies a fireball in both hands.
“Sure,” Tony grits out. “You forgot tech visionary and philanthropist.” That earns him another forceful shove against the truck, and Steve has had enough. He stills the unruly agent by his shoulder, and six crosshairs instantaneously appear over his torso.
“That, I am. And I see you’re using my company’s proprietary facial recognition algorithm to match my handsome face to a database. Which? SHIELD? New York-Presbyterian Hospital? Redtube?”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about. What about Steve –”
Next Monday morning, on the steps of Capitol Hill, as they ascend shoulder-to-shoulder, a slew of press crews surrounds them, pressing for answers. Tony takes all the questions in his stride, his voice rings true. He apologises that the issue got out of hand. He reiterates that the Avengers are on this case. There’s an industrial saboteur to be held responsible. He tells them that they mean no disrespect, and they’re grateful for the outpouring support that has come forth since the clip was shared on Facebook.
Barnes pushes his palms against Steve’s ribcages, and Tony counts one, two, three. Another breath of lifegiving air. One, two, three. It’s a dance with the dead, to bring Steve back to life. Tony watches, enthralled, lost in grief, and even when Steve sputters and stirs, Tony is still adrift in the Potomac. Until Barnes cocks his head towards him, across the distance and just
Steve empties himself into Tony first, rocking his balls against Tony’s in lazy grinds. The best part is how
rises from the cup he’s cradling gingerly in both hands. His face crumples with concentration and a thin sheen of sweat glistens over his brows. “It works, wow! I didn’t think it would. Are you seeing this?”
Tony leaves yet another large tip for Steve with the front desk, and returns to his room.
God help him, he wants to cross the length of the garage and feel Tony up, every square inch as he rides his orgasms –
“I want to give Saint Pete a piece of my mind. Heaven sucks.”
to have a bird eye view of the enemy, Steve.”
The faceplate lifts automatically, so Tony used that opportunity to smack his forehead with his metal palm and bite back a stream of creative, choice words directed at everything that’s wrong with his life. One Helicarrier down, two to go. Theoretically, the loss of one should’ve been enough to derail Insight, shouldn’t it? Even as Tony looked up in the sky, metal debris raining on him, the remaining two are still resolutely making their ascent into the clouds, and he can’t risk it.
“Great! You’re fine and dandy and all that, Cap, but you and I just aren’t meant to be. Now, hurry along. I have some six-million potential customers to appease.”
Clint has to pick his jaw up from the carpet when he locks eyes with Steve from across the hallway. He looks
“Well,
“Any specific areas you’d like me to focus on?”
A growl of frustration trails Tony’s voice. “Must you ask now?”
and Tony folds upward that his back is flush against Steve’s front. Careful – he could’ve dislocated another set of bones – but nobody’s paying heed to safety compliance, what the hell,
Steve pulls the cock out, and slams it flat against the nest of pubic hair. Balls exposed, he latches onto them, tonguing the tauten sack and Tony’s hands fly up to cup his mouth.
“A little.”
Tony looks – that Steve wouldn’t care to wait, or let
Tony jumps to his feet, and pulls the helmet off. The place where his butt was two seconds ago is
“Thanks,” Tony folds his arm back and winces. “I’m uh, gonna go and pack.”
Lost.
“It’s politics.”
“What are you looking for?”
“Come on, come on…”
Steve dusts his bottom, and turns to the door. “I’ll tell you after I make that fire. If you’re still awake.”
There’s only so many times one can hide behind snark and wit. Steve has seen it all first-hand. Tony downplaying his generosity with nonchalance, masking his grief with nonchalance. Pretending he doesn’t care, so that when it hurts the most, it won’t matter.
“Tell you what. You’re the DaVinci, the Van Gogh. Do us a facial composite. Get the news out to the FBI, maybe. They’ll want to nail the bastard that did Nick in, won’t they?”
“I’m thinking… scrambling the signals between Insight’s control and the Helicarriers. Bounce them off one of Stark satellites instead of Insight’s. Or, I can jam Zola’s algorithm so it doesn’t load.” Tony shakes his head. “But, I don’t understand the syntax. So, scratch that. Uh, you guys like something crazy? I can try reprogramming the ships’ artillery to target each other. Or is that

“How many?”

Scrambling back and forth between the servers and the armours’ platforms, he connects each one manually, and as he works feverishly, he thinks he hears another set of footsteps echoing from the floor above, matching his own pacing.

After dinner one Wednesday, he hangs back in the kitchen instead of returning to his room or the study as per usual. Even a genius has to eat, right? But Tony never appears, and it’s ten thirty. Steve has sat by and stood around and leaned against the kitchen island since seven. Thor would’ve called this “fated”. He grabs a glass of water and makes for his bedroom upstairs, and lo and behold! Here comes Tony Stark from the elevator, grimy from head to toe, clad in clothes that might’ve seen better days.
thing. The right thing and the easy thing is never the same thing, which is why Tony is eyefucking that fancy-schmancy tall flute of black coffee on the menu. If death or imprisonment were to come for him – and he bet all his lofty-but-still-frozen bank accounts that swiftly they will – he wants to go out high on caffeine. As discreetly as Steve can manage, he closes a hand over Tony’s. Briefly but emphatically, because he has this to say, “A heartbeat is long enough to make the right call.”
Guys, it's done! Thank you so, SO much for your lovely reviews, and your support. Working on this and sharing it with you have been such a pleasant experience :) Love you guys, and I hope to see you soon in our next adventure! Take care! <3
The rain doesn’t lift. God, it’s been pouring.
is ordering him to do exactly that?
He takes huge strides – as quietly as he can manage – and enters the archway. He flattens himself against the wall, hiding in the shadows of yet another oaken shelf. He’s sweating and panting and stumbling around in his own house
Right on cue, two figures whisk past them, and Steve instantly tightens his grip on Tony. Natasha flings her brilliant red hair over her shoulder as she cocks her head, a muted instruction to get the hell back in while they handle this.
"I see what you are trying to do, Steven, but have you been completely honest with yourself?"
“We’d definitely film you running, if you want.”
Peggy’s jaw dropped.
"Of course you do."
He walked three blocks north and one block west before ordering a cup of coffee at his favorite cafe. The barista called it coffee, anyway, but it was mostly chocolate and whipped cream. Steve sipped his frappuccino with a smile on his face, determined to make this a good day. It had to happen eventually, didn't it? One good day from top to bottom.
“Trying to decorate for me?”
“What, are you upset because you’ll lose out on the money?”
It might not look like much, but it was the only place he could call home.
Steve arrived at his apartment around ten o’clock that evening. He spent the first few minutes back in his apartment, simply taking it all in.
"What, do you think I'll slip and fall into the toilet?"
“Can I at least nap before we have this conversation?”
She scanned him up-and-down then scoffed.
“That’s a problem.”
“Nothing’s a favor for you, Steve. You keep Tony happy, and a happy Tony makes my job easier.”
“I worked so hard to find you and he messes it up a month in? God, he’s done it this time. I will hang him upside-down from Dum-E by his ankles until he apologizes.”
“It’s safe to say I’ll never be bored with you.”
Steve took them out to a restaurant Happy recommended. He said it was one of Tony’s favorites because they always sat him at a table near the back where no one noticed. They did the same for Steve without being asked. The moment he sat down, it was as if his problems evaporated. Sam was there. Nat was there. With the two of them, everything seemed solvable. They hadn’t been together as a group in over a year. Steve grabbed the business card from the table and crumpled it up into a tiny clump.
Steve asked, “Why would you think that?”
“Yes.” Pepper smiled sadly. “I did. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I watched him do impossibly dangerous things, then we broke up and he got kidnapped by terrorists. He burned himself with a blowtorch? Just the average Thursday. Do I love him? Yes. As a girlfriend? Absolutely not.”
“How wonderful life is while you're in the world …”
They said their goodbyes, shook hands, and Steve hugged Carol because he was closest to her of everyone in the group. She had spent her entire time in the Air Force hiding, too, and with a steeper hill to climb.
"If you're letting his staff plan your dates, it doesn't sound like either one of you wanted this to happen."
He laughed, realizing he left his burger and fries untouched at the diner. Tony Stark was a walking distraction. A much welcome distraction. Steve grabbed a yogurt shake-type thing from the fridge and downed it without thought. After wiping the remnants from the corner of his mouth, he shrugged off his jacket and hung it in the closet. He glimpsed the edge of a grey denim sleeve but ignored the temptation to pull it out.
“I threw parties for Peggy. I thought it was part of being a good boyfriend. I
“I do.”
"Tony?"
“You all may have heard I have a boyfriend now. It’s new, and I am a firm believer that no relationship is real
"He was your friend."
“I really like him.” Steve spun the water glass between his fingers. “He drunk dialed me from Germany last week and said all sorts of nice things. He said I make him feel less alone. He does the same for me.”
"Three-and-a-half years ago."
“You’re right.”
"Why?"
"You really should have," Tony said. "Pep said there would only be one. But you know how it is, one of them can't make a gig so they text one person who texts another who texts another and by the time I get here the whole goddamn press corps is outside."
Tony always seemed to do that, change the subject when things hit too close to home.
“Tony, this is Natasha Romanoff. Nat, this is Tony Stark.”
"Are the rumors about your company true? Are you losing your seat on the board?"
“I’m just thinking, will it be the same for me? Riley and I hid for so long, I want to know what it’s like to love someone without hiding it.”
He warily sighed, "Date's not over yet.”
Stark eating out of your hand. That’s the kind of man who treats sex like oxygen, yet you are still on first base because he
Steve laughed. Well, he had hoped for something to break up his everyday routine. It would be rude to ignore a woman who asked him a direct question, and Steve always prided himself on manners. He took another sip through his straw then said,
“Yeah?”
"When it comes to self-loathing I am king of that castle," Tony said as Steve wrapped his arm around Tony's shoulders. "But I learned to see the good in other people. I believe in the future, and if the future is a good place that goodness has to come from somewhere, right?"
Steve fell back onto his pillow and stared up at the ceiling.
“I am trying to say that …” Steve ran a hand over his face. “Goddamn it. I—”
"Balancing the scales?"
“My preferred schedule would mean I don’t move from this couch. Unfortunately, I have a thing this morning. A meeting thing that I cannot sleep through, but I’m exhausted.”
“Okay.”
“Sure,” Steve said, “maybe next week.”
“So you’re moving in.”
"Tell me, then, what do you think of Mr. Stark?"
"Someone like you?"
"I wasn't alone."
Steve conceded, “That would definitely get you places.”
"Well fuck 'em."
"You are young, but not so much younger than Tony that it's creepy. You are handsome and recently unemployed. Born and raised in Brooklyn, retired Army Captain, honorably discharged. Everything the press loves and everything they never expect Tony to have."
Steve stepped forward to close the distance between them.
"Then I guess I'm doing my job."
“I’m going away for a work trip.”
Yep. Truth hurts. He looked at himself in the bathroom mirror and wondered what Pepper Potts had seen in him that made him right for this assignment. The answer, obviously, was tension in his shoulders, eyes that never stayed put for too long, and fists that had broken many bones over the years. Miss Potts had seen a soldier with nothing to do and no one to protect.
He threw the towel down on the countertop and said, "Pep is pleased some of the cell phone footage of us yesterday afternoon is making the rounds online. Magazines picked up some still photos of us entering the theatre."
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose and finally said, "I almost lost it right then. I think this is a real bad idea."
“Have you slept with him?”
Steve almost believed it.
Steve turned to Tony and asked, “Do you want to meet my friends?”
"The cameras?"
Steve prepared their plates; lasagna, Brussels sprouts, and baguette slices. He sat across from Tony at the table and waited for him to dig in. Except, Tony didn’t. He stared at Steve for an uncomfortably long time. Steve poked at a sprout with his fork.
Tony plucked the invitation from Steve’s hand and read through it. He flipped it over to show Steve a handwritten message.
“It is not a life-altering choice. You’ve been to my place, you like the bathtub, so I’ll get you a mattress that feels like a rock and you will never want to leave.”
"No?"
“I want to date you, Tony, not pity you.”
"He didn't make it out?"
"Yes, ma'am."
“I can hardly come over looking like I just got off a ten-hour flight.”
, are you?”
A button-down or a t-shirt? Steve groaned as he scanned his options: white or grey or black button-down, army t-shirts, and a lilac cashmere sweater Peggy made him buy. A purchase that certainly paid dividends; every time he wore it, she ended up taking the sweater off. The cashmere sweater would certainly send the wrong signal, so Steve settled on the puke-green ARMY t-shirt and threw a black leather jacket on top.
“It’s New York; I’m saving space.”
Steve gave him a wan smile and said, "But now I've got you."
Steve grabbed the magazine and paid for it as the cashier did a double-take. He stopped himself from rolling his eyes, but if this was how life was going to be then Steve didn't plan on leaving his apartment for the next year. He had been entirely alone these past few months. No one outside of the VA noticed him much at all, and there was comfort in that. Steve supposed one date with Tony Stark had shot that all to hell. He sat by the window, angled away and toward the store but with a solid view of the front entrance. He flipped through the pages until he landed on the story titled, "The Mutiny at Stark Industries Has Begun."
"Then sit down."
Steve and Sam looked at Nat, confused. She clarified,
The water was an inch deep when he sank into the bathtub. He leaned against one end, his neck resting on a pillow attached to the lip of the tub. Whoever decorated these rooms thought of everything. Steve stretched out his legs and there were still a few inches between his toes and the end of the tub. He smiled; luxury was in the small things.
"I bought it."
He pulled the door open and motioned for Mr. Stark to walk through. He quickly looked up at Steve before walking into the restaurant. Steve followed him and was immediately enveloped by warm, heavy air. They were seated in the very back, the booth furthest away from the entrance, and they wordlessly agreed Steve would sit facing the door. Tony Stark did not bother to sit down, instead asking their waitress to point him toward the bathroom. She departed after taking their drink order.
“You know you have a bunch of people behind you.”
"This is a good faith agreement, Tony. I'm not a whore and you are not my sugar daddy."
Steve admitted, “I didn’t plan to.”
He was still quite wary about all this. Sam was right; being bored wasn't a reason to throw himself into a yearlong commitment with anything. Let alone a fake relationship with a man who was a magnet for cameras.
(See the end of the chapter for
What a swanky business she must run.
"I am not a prostitute. I don't want to be involved in this sort of business."
"Tony!" he shouted. Steve held out his arms and slowly turned in a circle to give him the full view. "What do you think?"
Tony frowned.
"Are you nervous about the publicity?" asked Ross.
Thursday wasn’t bad. Steve went to Thorapy alone because Tony had a meeting. There were a lot of meetings in Tony’s world. He did manage to meet Steve for lunch before returning to the boardroom. They spent the evening in the workshop, where Steve watched Tony through a myriad of blue holograms and went through all of the paperwork that built up while Tony was away. He sorted everything into three piles: Sign This, Read This, and Burn This.
"You don't know anything about what I want," Steve snapped.
"Tuesday morning."
“What did he do?”
"You fuck hot women at the VA?"
"I'll go."
Steve leaned a bit closer to the phone and revealed, “You said you missed me.”
Steve nodded and said, "Something like that."
Tony stood up to face Steve full-on, and said, “I have been full-frontal on national media a dozen times. Whatever you have to say, you can’t possibly have a more shameful, profligate, oversexed past than me.”
"Technically I am not allowed to reveal information about Mr. Stark's personal life," Happy said. "However, I will say no, this is not generally my function. Would I say that makes you unique? Yes. Now, feel free to—"
"Do you paint over a Monet? Do you Photoshop a sunset? Mr. Stark only ever needs something to reduce shine and conceal the circles underneath his eyes. This is the easiest gig I get, and I can't fix gorgeous so I will leave you as you are."
"First off, all those women were from a New Year's Eve party. I couldn't tell you what we did because, well ... I am in this situation for a reason. While they're real shit for doing it, the board isn't wrong that I have problems. Not that they care
Steve looked over at him and admitted, "For some reason, Tony, I do. But that is a lot to take in."
“Why does Tony have a meeting at 6 AM?”
“May 6th – 12th. I planned to go see Sarah and the kids, then thought I’d come up to New York to see you.”
Steve admitted, “I have no idea.”
“Steve?”
“Not maybe, Steve. I’ll talk to you next week.”
“No, I can safely say I did not know that.”
“Tony Stark, a man of the people,” teased Sam. “What does ‘something special’ mean to a man with a billion dollar paycheck?”
"He doesn't know?" Rhodey asked, seemingly a bit starstruck. "You didn't tell him?"
"We were in a place that was very, very cold. It was mostly a recon mission, just me and ten others. We came to a lake that had frozen over. The smart thing would have been to walk around it, but that would have added a full day to our jaunt and I didn't want to be there a single minute longer than we had to be."
Dr. Madani smiled softly then asked each of them to establish a goal for the week. Some were smaller goals. Commander Hill wanted to take her son out to a restaurant and not be suspicious of everyone within thirty feet of their table. Ross was finally ready to get back on a plane. Not fly one, he insisted, but to sit on a commercial flight.
“You promised to be the best relationship I’ve ever had,” Tony cautioned, “so … Can you live up to the hype?”
“You’re right.”
“I don’t mean to be.”
"Oh, have you?"
"I'm having lunch and one of the guys in my unit happens to be obsessed with TMZ. He walks over to me and says, 'Hey, doesn't this look like that guy you have a picture with in your bunk?"
Steve rolled his eyes.
on this team.”
“Might.”
“You brought Jarvis to my home?”
"I don't know. I would probably be bored as hell waiting for my pension check every month and hoping my friends call me from Afghanistan at three in the goddamn morning." Sam paused then let out an "Ah" of understanding. "Stark's an interesting bastard and you, Steve Rogers, are bored."
No groaning pipes. No crushing ice cubes or doors opening down the hall at three. He'd slept in for the first time in God only knew how long. Steve pushed the covers down with his feet, groaning as he pulled himself into a sitting position. He began his morning stretch routine: head tilt right, head tilt left, try not to wince at the neck pop. Shoulders back, spine cracks—
"Tell me about your other one?"
Their waitress dropped off the rootbeer, but neither Steve nor Tony bothered to break the silence. Instead, Tony stood up and walked around the table to sit next to Steve. Their arms touched and it brought Steve out of whatever dark place he'd been heading to. He kept his spine rigid and shoulders tense as he spoke.
Steve slumped a bit in his seat and stared at the edge of Thor's desk.
"I know that and you know that, but to most people there isn't a difference. For thirty-two years I've been Steve; I've been Captain Rogers for more than a decade. Part of me is terrified to put that aside to make 'Tony Stark's boyfriend' the headline of my obituary."
"How are things in the world of anti-electron collisions?"
“Have they started talking about me?”
“I’m kidding. I don’t do karaoke, but there is one song I think I can handle that sums up how it feels to be dating Tony. And you owe me a very large bucket of popcorn for this.”
“Oh!” Pepper laughed. “I didn’t. That was a delightful surprise.”
Steve pulled out a chair and sat directly in front of her.
Sam asked, “What does he want?”
“I Googled him.”
Tony turned and tossed a beanbag at him. Steve caught it then tossed it into the hole at the top of the board. The corner of Tony’s mouth quirked up for just a moment before he said,
“No, because you’ll like him more than you like me.”
; the repetition kept him sane, a twelve-year habit he couldn't shake.
“How did you know I missed the lecture?”
“Before I forget,” Steve pulled a crumpled piece of paper from his back pocket, “this is for you.”
; Steve had found many men attractive over the years, but he wasn’t allowed to
"I suck at this, but I'll kick your ass at Mario Kart."
"We were together for years. More years than most people have before one of them gets down on a knee, but Peggy's English and I'm stationed here. Was, I mean. I
“Did you sleep last night?” Steve asked, sitting on the arm of the couch.
“He called at three in the morning to ask about you.”
He was hyperaware of Tony's touch. They were talking in front of people, holding hands in front of people, and Steve leaned into him when he extended a hand to Dr. Banner.
Tony snickered.
“What did you tell him?”
“Bye, Peggy.”
"You sleep in separate rooms?"
He didn’t have much of a choice, but Steve couldn’t tell Nat. Not that Natasha would tell anyone. Hell, secrets were better kept
“I think I prepared you for this fairly well, darling.”
"Three?!" Steve half-shouted. "Getting ready takes three hours?"
“There is that, but it takes a couple minutes for the water to warm and it leaks out from the head.” Before Tony could make a joke, Steve held up a hand to stop him. “I was in the army; I heard every possible response to that.”
"They will believe I am different." Steve took Tony's hand in his own and began walking down the street. "It's only a couple blocks away."
Steve didn’t correct her; she was right. Nat was second the same way Peggy was. Always second to what might have been.
“I go through every part of life alone. At least, the parts of life that involve clothes. I don’t want your pity—”
“You don’t need to go to any trouble. I don’t
"Ah, Stark. Good to see you here," one of the men said with a tone that implied the opposite.
"She's quite the lady and won't take shit from anybody. Annoyed more than one of the COs, but she's very determined and a great fighter, always managed to make me laugh. Oh, and she's gorgeous."
"Eleven failed attempts, sir."
Then he waited.
"Truly, Tony, I am not worried. I've faced bigger enemies than the
“This is why I never call you.”
"I kissed him once, on a dare. It lasted so long that everyone knew what we were by the time it was over. I think we both knew that moment was the only time we'd hold each other like that. And then ..."
"Oh."
“Good, then.”
He nodded again.
“Look, Cap, if you and Barnes ever want to taste the rainbow, the Howling Commandos are pro-Skittles. That’s all I’m saying.”
“Oh my God! Are you with Steve? Is Steve there?”
"I made a promise, Miss Potts.”
Neither Steve nor Tony knows what's fake and what's real between them. I got a lot of personal satisfaction from writing Steve tell a bunch of homophobes their existence is a waste of oxygen. Anywho, I am working on another Stony fic as well, so I am not certain when the next update will be published but I hope to have it up soon! Happiness yet to come.
“Morning.”
“Now is when you ask, ‘Why the hell haven’t you done it already?’”
Miss Potts sighed and revealed, "Tony is about to lose his seat on the board."
"Fine."
“You know, I think I might have set the bar too high with you, Steve.” Pepper sighed. “Maybe I should’ve gotten someone a bit more …” She shook her head. “Average.”
“You do?” Tony asked, surprised.
“I could use a favor.”
He walked out of the room and toward the front door, asking Carol when she planned to speak to Maria. He gave her his cell phone number, since his life wasn't Fort Knox anymore, and asked her to text. He held the door open for Carol then stopped when he noticed his boyfriend standing at the foot of the stairs.
"Nah, it was the coffee shop down on Grand."
"I could get used to this."
Steve hesitated to ask, "Do you want me to meet him?"
Steve picked up the pen and signed.
"Nice to meet you."
"If you wanna be two peas in a lonely-ass pod, then you two go right ahead. But Steve?"
Steve laughed.
The receptionist rolled her eyes and tapped her fingers on the keyboard. She glanced at the card Steve held up then back to what Steve assumed was Miss Potts's schedule. With one eyebrow raised, she said,
when this is meant to end eleven months from now?!”
“Sure, let’s go with that.”
“Hi, Tony.”
“Not a type.”
piece is right." That was the second time someone dropped that magazine into the conversation like it was important. "But I hope he's turning things around. Who knows? Maybe that starts with you."
The open duffel bag on the bed taunted him with its emptiness. Steve Rogers had seen war. He killed people, led more than a dozen ops, and still carried shrapnel in his left forearm. But he was not sure how to handle this.
"Why do you keep calling him that?" Tony asked.
“I want to get you something.”
"You get that look on your face when you're thinking about something you are afraid to be happy about."
Tony walked out and continued, “Did you dump tea in the harbor, Steve?”
Steve blanched and asked, "What the hell are you going to do to my hair?"
“Maybe Stark will help you find that bit of yourself again. The past couple years, it feels like I am only talking to half of you. James would want—”
“I need to know if this will be a regular thing. If you’re going to dump me every Tuesday, then say you plan to dump me every Tuesday so I can be prepared for it.”
"That reminds me, Rogers, before this," he gestured to the space between them with his hand holding a second slice of pizza, "goes any further, we need to talk."
There was a brief pause before Sam asked, "Are you serious?"
were wrong."
Steve offered Tony his sandwich and he didn’t even pause his work, just sat it on the small countertop next to the toaster. He paused to take the occasional bite, and Steve sat there watching. The playlist restarted. Steve took a picture of Tony working under the sink. His face was obscured by a pipe, but his legs were spread wide on Steve’s kitchen tile and it was another one of those moments when Tony seemed to forget about being
"That's what I said, isn't it?" Tony snapped. He grabbed a towel from the counter and pulled it taut between his fists as he turned around.
“If you had given me a moment to process what you said, I would have told you the only thing scarier than the thought of losing you is the idea that you will go through this alone.”
The compliments in Tony's world were so strange. Steve thanked her just as Miss Potts poked her head through the door.
Steve shuffled past and unlocked his door.
"Was he drunk?" Sam guessed. "It seems like he's drunk a lot."
Tony gave him the once-over and asked, “Is purple going to be a thing, now?”
“I don't even have a laptop.”
“Mhmm. See, over there? Nobel Prize winner. That’s an Oscar nominee, she’s a Tony Award winner—
"What you hired me to do," Steve finished.
“No.”
“Because Peggy’s fucking great, and Sousa’s fucking great. If he was average or if he didn’t look at Peggy the way I used to look at her, then I could at least look at their relationship and say it was different. But it’s not!” Steve sat up and admitted, “I see
Steve ran a hand through his hair and agreed, "Yeah, something like that."
Tony cut him off with a laugh.
“You dressed up, too.”
Steve closed his eyes and let his arms rest on the edges of the tub. As the water rose, he listened to the water pouring from the faucet. The steadiness of it numbed him and he sank a bit deeper into the warmth as the water rose to the top of his thighs. All the tension of the past few months began to ebb.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That day Bucky understood that he should not stick posters in the complex warning of what the board would be about, and it was not a good idea to publish it on the internet either, of course not.
Many super soldiers watched the goalkeeper closely, Steve sighed and went on. --As the contract said again... --and again it was interrupted.
-Continuous. -- the captain spoke a little angrily. --The contract will be based on the following. -- and as if it were cause of divine strength it was interrupted again.
The captain was surprised, what a way to react. -No Tony, I mean, I mean...
-Don't lie. -he turned to see him. -I'm like a stuffed doughnut. -sobbed. -and that's why you're going to leave me... -and suddenly burst into tears.
-Would you do us a favor Nat? –asked the blond.
-but we can't wait that long, for sure if we take his eyes off him, he'll go away, remember they're some fucking ninjas in a matter of escaping.
-Of course I do... -and so they both went to a jewelry store.
-How do we solve this? It's... too big...
Just as Tony came in and saw all the candidates smiled, he didn't know he had so many people behind him, however his smile was erased when a certain Titan came in.
Shampoo (SuperFamily)
-Just sit down brother and let's listen to the rules of the contract. --Thor told what Loki very politely took a seat.
-Me too. –I didn't take his eyes off him. –J.A.R.V.I.S.?
-I'll talk to him. -his eyes became serious, what was that blond thought to disrespect his Kotenok? -I will not let you say anything to you and our future son...
-Finally, as I was saying... --and again it was interrupted by another person or rather a God.
-No... I say it's going to hurt your stomach if you keep eating that way...
-As I said. ,said the captain a little angry. --The contract will have certain rules like... -- it was interrupted again, that day God was not on his side.
-Really? Of all the Times, did you have to fail this time? –Asked the chestnut with sarcasm.
-after eating a dish with all the food the Doctor recommended, we can eat ice cream. -he smiled.
The captain was in the room with Natasha and Sam when the Winter Soldier arrived.
Steve just smiled and thought "this child came out just like my Little Cinnamon"
-Anthoska... -he sat beside him, on the bed. -I brought you the doughnuts you love so much...
The blond smiled at that image, was tender, but he had to tell him that what he was doing was wrong. --Peter...--he called, the Castañito just turned it over to see while the shampoo was still pouring. --Did you throw the shampoo? --the question was obvious, I knew it was his little one.
-Now if as I was going to say ... -- the door was opened interrupting the Captain, again.
-I'm sorry I'm late but I didn't know what time the meeting was. -- Natasha said, going into the office, took a seat and nodded for Steve to continue.
-Did you throw all the shampoo, Peter?-at the question Tony got confused but Steve wanted to know what the boy was going to say.
-13.78 inch, sir.
-How did you find out? --asked the spy.
-Whatever. --He looked at Buck and preferred to follow. --As he said... --It was interrupted.
-So... Legolas... how much can it be?
-You can continue Steve. Barnes told him.
-What am I, a fat fuck? -The philanthropist was angry.
-Si... -he answered more quietly, sitting on the bed, hugging the pillow. Damn hormones, by the fact of being man the hormones attacked with everything, technically because it's not normal for a man to be pregnant, but Stark was a special.
-and why didn't you tell me?
-I'm hungry... –he warned the chestnut to swim walking down the halls to go to the kitchen, and was in the room when a dark bulge in one of the corners of the room caught his attention, after all that was not normal.
-Don't worry, I talked to Steve, he won't tell you anything anymore... -He came up to the youngest. -just tell me who treats you wrong and I'll see to it that he repents. -he sat next to the opposite.
-Don't you think it's too many calories?, said Steve, who was coming into the room.
-I... -the chestnut was happy and surprised, he had completely believed the wedding of Wong. -Of course I do, I want to marry you and spend what remains of life to your side...
-How much do you measure?
Ring (IronStrange) Part III
-What if I'm fat!?
-Do you think he likes it? -Stranger asked with a tone of concern.
The chestnut was overflowing a lot of emotions, he was shocked when Stephen had said that, he was not expecting it.
Tony was lying on the couch in the living room, watching a movie while devouring a huge box of doughnuts.
-Thank you James...
-it's not funny. –Stark looked at him seriously. –First do something and then you mock if you want.
-I hate you! -and immediately the genie rose from the couch and ran away as he wept.
-Brucie, Steve is not here. –The chestnut tree was more and more desperate to kill that thing.
-I know... –remarked Tony without failing to see that.
A portal opened in the middle of the office and from there came the Supreme Sorcerer. --I'm very interested in the contract that will be signed today, I also wish For Tony's love.
Plump (WinterIron) part II
-Sorry for the delay. --said Peter a little sorry. --but we too want to participate, I know what you're thinking, I like Mr. Stark and no one will stop me from participating in the contract. --He said earnestly.
-Listen just this time I'll pass it. -He pointed it out with his metal hand. -My Kotenok is very sensitive because of her pregnancy, and I'll take care of her eating well. -He took some air. -So stop bothering my TONY!  -That said, he withdrew from the place, leaving everyone astonished.
-Am I late for the contract meeting to win over Tony Stark? --Tony finished half a mocker.
-No problem. -he stroked his head. -Now let's eat you have to eat for two.
The door was opened by the Winter Soldier, he went into the room and it hurt that his Tony was in that state.
-Let's continue this in the room... –mentioned Steve and the chestnut solo nodded, it was time to reward his love for saving his life.
Dos in red suits came in. One of them was Spider-Man and the other was Deadpool.
-Auch... –Said Clint.
-Tony, could you lend me the ring? I want to see him...-he smiled.
-Stephen. -called the genie. -What are we supposed to go shopping for?
-Daddy.
-Why does everyone like to see us suffer? –asked the Hawkeye.
-Do you think I'm fat? -let loose.
-it was a game. -he mocked the chestnut-tree and the opposite only smiled. -but to all this, I didn't know Wong had a partner, and why do we have to choose him? Besides, he didn't even invite me to his wedding... -he made a stew that before the sight of the Pelinegro was tender.
Plump (WinterIron) part III
Baby Talc (superfamily)
-I beg you. –Begged the archer.
-What have you got? -he began to caress his head in a tender manner.
Ring (IronStrange) Part II
-boys and girl, I'm joined too. -- This time it was Scott. -- Sorry if I interrupted but got lost on my way here. -- he sat in one of the chairs next to Thor.
-What?-cried the millionaire from the room.
-What? –he asked and observed what the other two Avengers were watching. –It is a spider...

“Ah, Steve.” Judging by the way Pepper is eyeing the arc reactor that’s not visible under his three-piece suit, he guesses
It’s not exactly a trending research area for all the aforementioned reasons. It’s not all gloom and doom, either. Fatalities in translational studies happen every once in a while.

There’s still an opportunity. They don’t know what Tony is capable of. With Rumlow’s back turned against him, he gathers the last of his power in his right hand –
“I’m here. What is it?”
For the life of him, he cannot sleep a wink that night. He lies in his large bed, alone and cold under all the sheets, still feeling the ghost of Steve’s fingers on his cock. It stands proud and erect in his sweatpants just thinking about it, that he spends a good half-an-hour squatting under a cold shower and downing a pot of coffee after. Sleep is for the weak anyway, and he soldiers through the night working on market analysis. The best boner killer in town.

Steve clears his throat and the two guys snickering behind him hush abruptly.

Tony washes his face and towels his chin dry. “Interesting. Let me guess, you’re not pissed off because some lady isn’t obeying your instructions. I’m gonna go one step ahead and assume she’s doing that on someone

Is that’s why it’s been radio silence the whole afternoon? Because Pepper has been taking the brunt of the heat for him, and now that she’s left, he’s free game? Fair enough. For his part, he’ll be quiet, pretend he isn’t even here. Stark the dead possum. Let everybody cool down a bit. They’ll see sense in due time.
He pulls over and sits very still, ignoring the way his seatbelt is cutting into his chest. Steve is still fast asleep, which is beyond fantastic – so he slips his hand under his oversized T-shirt and clutches the arc reactor.
“… Do you want me to suck you off or not?” Tony slaps away Steve’s hand, and starts worshipping the hunk of flesh. He’s clearly within his comfort zone, servicing and making a show out of it. The way he drags his tongue up from the balls to the tip signifies experience. His lips close around it, and he goes down again. In the warm, wet cavern Steve’s cock hits against the back of his throat.
Maybe one squeeze? A fleeting touch. He’s

, and personally escorts the injured to a clearer ground. He dares not to check the scurry behind him.
And then, Tony is shifting enthusiastically under Steve, hips bucking but not to seek more friction. Steve feels more than he sees the pants shrugged of his legs. Tony clasps his thighs against Steve’s, and his smile is genuine. “So, I’ve been thinking…”
“I haven’t finished.”
– so if you can’t discuss it, don’t.”
“… Yeah. Yeah, I’m uh…” He clears his throat and leaps off the bed in an instant, one arm already reaching out for his bathrobes. Not his, probably, he doesn’t think he comes in them, but the robes are there, and he’s a paying customer, so God help him. “Thanks, Steve.”
“Quinjets, flying cars, who knows? I never expected Insight.”
“I’m here. Ready when you are, Tony.”
The pitch would’ve gone much better if the agency reps had two brain cells to rub together.
“Oh my God. You
“I’m fine.” Steve nods in the general direction of a large door. “It’s been five hours.”
Steve jams the corner of his towel into the shell of his ear. “No, Tony.”
“No.” She pushes away the stack of folders on her table, so there’s absolutely nothing in between him and her, sans the mahogany table. “It’s always more than a hunch with you. What is it, really?”
And Pepper bursts into tears. She falls forward into his chest, and sobs wetly into his shirt. There is a special place in hell for people who make Pepper Potts cry, and he sincerely believes his season pass is ready for collection. He pats her on her back, and she bawls even louder. If she’s going to make a ruckus, he hopes she goes all out.
his luck today, despite the circumstances – and leaps into the driver’s seat. This seemingly abandoned vehicle is
“Hi, Mr Stark,” one of them stammers out.
“He’s practically family.”
The margin of clearance depreciates. The upward thrust of Iron Man alone isn’t working.
“… I know you, Tony.”
The metal hand releases his waist, leaving a five-finger bruise in its wake – curls into a fist and slams into the square of his stomach.
“It’s just mouth.”
forget those words, those harsh, harsh words Tony spoke of, even when he was minutes away from making love to this body. When the rage and lust of the tonic consumed him, Steve let Tony mark him, claim him. That feels like a lifetime ago.
“He’s a businessman.”
“Because I’ve done enough. I’ve taken things way too far. And I’ve no excuse for ever allowing it to get this far.”
Something inside Steve clenches at Tony’s crestfallen features. “Is this what you think of me, really? Does this embarrass you?”
Clint bolts. Steve wants to bolt, too. The pressure on his nose eases and Tony steps away from the door. His demeanour changes completely – God, Clint was right, Tony’s completely red in the face, the culmination of shower steam and vigour of their recent… activities. And Tony just stares at Steve, expressionless, on and on like he has questions queuing up but doesn’t know which to ask first.
for ruining my night, Cap.”
“Nope.”
The clock says it’s ten sharp.
“Sir –”
This is it. He’s gonna die alone.
Welcome to his temple. This is where he prostrates himself before the majesty of bleeding edge science and technology, where humanity on the whole takes another tiny step forward. He stands steadfast on the dais, arms outstretched. His audience is his bots, his symphony provided by equally expensive and advanced Stark-ware. And he, the crafty maestro.
“The Tower?”
“Take off your shirt.”
“Zero casualties.”
– even nicked him on the outer shell –
“Not yet,” Steve waves his package right under Tony’s nose, a surreptitious indication that the day is far from over. “Nick needs a dead drop loaded. I just offered our services.”
“The whole institution is corrupt, Steve! We need to tear it down. The people need to know. Stopping Insight today is not going to be enough. We talked about this, and you know it. This is not winning the war. It’s a stopgap. We need to go straight to the heart of the issue.”
It’s written on the fucking wall. But
at metal projectiles that for some reasons, are homing onto him. And they keep coming back, no matter how hard he fights.
Hey, beautiful people! This is it, the end of all things smutty :p There'll be a short coda after this, like a stinger scene in the movies XD But, as far as the main body of the story is concerned, this is it. I want to thank all of you who have subscribed, reviewed, gave kudos and bookmarked, who have supported this story in any ways - you guys ROCK!
They’re lucky. They’re on a lesser used two-lane country road, not more than a couple of vehicles had driven past them the last five minutes they loiter next to the car. Tony’s steadily burning up, he thinks his eyebrows are singeing. He’ll soon turn into a freak-show so God help him.
“That was a million lightyears ago!
But, instead of going the
“Don’t worry about it, I’ve got spares.” Then, Dum-E bins the ruined gauntlet with a satisfying crash in the metal box that’s labelled “Scraps!”. “I swear, that bot just loves seeing my inventions fail.”
“... I need to punch something real bad.”
“- fine, people. Just fine…” Steve’s earpiece crackles some more, and he jams it deeper into his ear. He has to make sure. “Heavy…”
Not bothering with protesting or bargaining this time, Tony’s hand drops to his crotch where it grips a cylindrical length propping against his left thigh. His fingers curl tightly around it, stroking it lazily, eyes boring holes into the button panels. Probably willing the ascent to quicken telepathically.
in God knows what – Barnes’ innocence? – is blatantly displayed on his features.
Tony props himself up on an elbow and leans across the edge of his bed to kiss Steve fully on the lips. The curtains are drawn, so it’s dim enough Steve hopes Tony can’t make out the mess he’s made of his face. Lips still locking and nursing the other’s, he climbs onto the bed, and gratefully embraces the warm mass that is Tony.
“… Get the coffee going after.”
Walking past Samsung gallery next, he stands rooted before a three-by-three floor-to-ceiling instalment of 64 inches UHD 4K Smart TVs, currently projecting not his face, but of the Malibu mansion he has set his GPS to. He’s supposed to be heading
“Oh, hell no.” Tony tries to loop the lanyard around Steve’s neck anyway. “
friendly terms with SHIELD?”
“Very thoughtful,” Clint agrees, and goes off shooting them arrows at punching bags. Watching them burst, spraying sand everywhere like a caricature of arterial puncture is ghastly satisfying. Suddenly, Steve doesn’t feel too guilty about the damages he’s incurred while perusing the facilities.
“All I’m asking is, give me a chance. Let me talk to him. Let me be
“… We meet HYDRA head-on.”
It’s near lunchtime, but screw that. And everything else. The battery in his phone is running low, and it’s still feet away from its charging dock, unplugged, uncared for. Just him on this cushy sofa, and a throw pillow over his face.
Tony turns around, the aftermath of an orgasm thick in the hard lines of his face. “Come here. I like to finish what I started.”
It works swimmingly – all forty suits are back online, but he doesn’t allow himself a millisecond of celebration. The spare generator is obviously kaput, and this is a really sucky time for a total blackout. Thank God for the arc reactor in his chest lighting up his way. He clasps his sweaty hand over his heart and crouches. He might as well hold up a giant, flamingo pink neon sign in the shape of an arrow that says, “Shoot here!”
Nobody knows he’s born in 1920, for starters. He can personally vouch for the modern society’s
He enters his house like every normal, late-thirties man does – through the roof of his garage-cum-workshop, and lands on the dais reserved for Mark 42. Dum-E wheels over to greet him like a normal puppy would the soonest he ejects himself from the suit. It holds out a wad of unread letters – why do people still snail mail him stuff? – so he pats the bot gently on its servo.
“… And, scene. I’ve swept the area three times over. All piezo are wired to these babies on site, and I just killed them. We’re clear.”
The way Tony’s eyes twinkle suggest not. “You speak German, I speak English. I don’t know how we’re gonna dance, darling.”
Tony promptly chokes on his first gulp.
doesn’t have to deal with the mess. He’d rather spend the next fifteen minutes vacuuming sand from the mat and burying busted punching bags in unmarked graves.
Steve Rogers has been whaling on his fourth Kevlar-fortified punching bag in a row, and is steadily progressing towards his fifth. His knuckles are sore, he’s waddling in a pool of sweat, and it’s only half past nine at night. The ceiling beam from which the bag hangs from shudders at the ferocity of his punch –
“That’s all, gentlemen. Try to stay out of trouble in the meantime.”
“We have to go, Steve.”
“General. How can we help you?” Tony has no recollection of having conducted businesses or negotiations with Thaddeus Ross. Perhaps they had exchanged polite good-evenings’ at a charity gala or two over the last couple of years. He knows of Ross’ reputations second-hand, enough to be wary of the General’s motives and speeches.
That “A” certainly doesn’t stand for Sokovia.
Steve doesn’t look impressed at all when Tony dangles Nescafe in his face. “Return that, and get us water! How are we making coffee when we don’t have water in the first place?”
trust SHIELD with your health.” Tony’s knuckle raps exceptionally hard on the table at that. “I’m just taking a leaf from your book.”
Me, too.”
His macho victory that sets his own face on fire.
“Who says it’s over?”
need to see those hands creep between Tony’s thighs to cup at his crotch. Until he hears the words – soft, distraught – but he hears Tony all the same.
The night is cool and humid with the threat of a thunderstorm, and the scent of ozone is welcoming. Tony climbs out of his seat, and promptly sinks to the ground.
“I’m fine. I’m fine, and that’s the truth. This here?” He taps at his arc reactor through his clothes, and Pepper pinches the bridge of her nose. “Brand new. It’s got a new element. Much better than palladium, and I’m calling it… Howardium. Nifty, huh?”
“You’re always so dramatic.”
“Veech died six years ago.”
Before he could take one step closer, Steve spins him around and stills him by his biceps, fingers digging into the flesh as his bulging eyes rake over the expanse of Tony’s bare chest.
does get out, he bet they’ll be breaking Facebook again.
The quiet and Tony Stark's sole company warms him up. He turns and catches Tony’s wrist with his lips, and trails kisses along the bare flesh with care. Tony stops his ministrations with an equally gentle grip on his jaws, and coaxes him to look up. Look Tony in his eyes, and notice the burden he too carries. More tears leak out of Steve’s, and Tony thumbs them away. He can’t possibly ask Tony for forgiveness. But, he can let Tony in, if only to ground himself to the fact that Bucky Barnes still walks this earth! Selfish? The words when spoken solidify the fact. He needs to… to convince himself that this –
before pushing a button emphatically on the right-hand side of the keyboard. “He’s harmless, Gary. And, you do understand that you can’t tell anybody about meeting us today?”
He rolls sharply away as Mark III replaces him in the hotspot, and resumes barraging the shaft with repulsors. Tony’s suit can’t take anymore punishment. His boots are close to being just boots.
“… Of course it is.” Tony pulls Steve’s wrist off his clothes and zips it back up. He deftly steps aside, effectively freeing himself from the cage of Steve’s hulking figure. “What are you up to next?”
“There is
“Where are the Iron Man suits?”
“We haven’t seen Clint in a while. He looks like he can use the company.”
In Steve’s defence, it is quite insane not to fight back when being whaled on by a pair of reactor-charged titanium gold gauntlets and boots. Wait until Steve sees the codpiece.
Male, tall, built. Steely eyes staring
“Steve! Shield!”
Steve bypasses the arc reactor in Tony’s chest, and the supervising Agents did not complain. Emboldened, the frisking continues in earnest. Tony makes his discomfort obvious, grunting as Steve prods him under his armpits, along his flanks and turns his pockets inside out. “You could’ve just asked,” Tony snaps, annoyed. Steve’s fingers just grazed the length of Tony’s limp cock. All to the blissful ignorance of everyone.
“I uh, took a leak. Fertilised that tree right there, see?” Again, his heart skips a beat and his mouth dries up. Early onset of arrhythmia what-not, please, not now.
“Calm down, Tony. Panicking isn’t going to help.”
“… Why not?” Pepper will be
“Plan B.
“Is something wrong, Steve?”
Steve thinks he knows what’s up. He suspects. He
“Doesn’t change the fact that the satellite they were supposed to hold ransom was already launched.
“You’re thinking it. I’m saying it.”
“I spoke with Fury earlier. I know he’s been giving you a hard time, and frankly speaking part of it is on you.” Steve smiles fondly at the accusation, and so does Tony. This is a precious memory to have of a friend, so Steve holds on to the moment for as long as he can. “We don’t appreciate your contributions to the team enough, I admit that. And I regret that it went down that way. No, let me have this, Tony,” he bats Tony down quickly. “You’re an important asset to the team, no lesser than the rest of us. You and I operate on different functions and mechanisms, and I was too…” Steve huffs again, “prideful, perhaps. I needed to peg you down to the… hivemind. You laugh, now,” Steve smiles again.
describing this… state of being. There is no up or down, early or late. Just, dark. Unending stretch of inky blackness, yet awfully claustrophobic.
“Uh-huh.”
dealing with them again. Once is quite enough. “You’re just sulking ‘cause I don’t have to drink that tonic anymore.”
Steve’s next surprise comes in the shape of the Maria Stark Foundation main complex. Tony parks the car near the courtyard, and Steve, still unsure of why they’re here, merely follows Tony through a wrought iron gate and archway, past some carved stone angels, and then, a sea of marble headstones.
“… Frankly, I don’t think there’s even a mission to discuss.”
come direct from SI’s vaults. Every piece designed personally by Tony himself. The Merchant of Death, the back-then child prodigy of smart artilleries. It’s good business, but something tells Steve money isn’t the only motivation.
Tony might say the blue in the sweater brings out the blue in his eyes.
They’re quickly losing light. Steve activates the flashlight option on his tablet and holds it up by Tony’s ear.
into a truck flanked by six burly men. Looks to him like the proverbial finger is already pointed somewhere.
“No, he’s dead, for real. His last address was fourteen thirty-five Elmhurst Drive. Nick’s mother lived two doors down.”
“Since when do we care about their opinions anyway?”
“… Is he gone?”
“It’s Steve. He says –”
Screw wireless transfer. He has cables long enough to loop around Earth at her largest diameter
“Semantics. Everyone all right?”
“SHIELD is not what we thought it was. It’s been taken over by HYDRA. Alexander Pierce is their leader.” Don’t sugarcoat it for them. “The STRIKE and Insight crew are HYDRA as well. I don’t know how many more, but I know they’re in the building. They could be standing right next to you.” Tony curbs the sudden urge to look over his shoulder, even if he’s sitting flushed against the wall. “They almost have what they want: absolute control. They shot Nick Fury and it won’t end there. If you launch those Helicarriers today, HYDRA will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way, unless we stop them.” A sigh steals a moment, but Steve presses on, “I know I’m asking a lot, but the price of freedom is high. It always has been, and it’s a price I’m willing to pay. And if I’m the only one, then so be it. But I’m willing to be I’m not.”
May the best cowboy win.
“Only, you’re in the car, Rogers. You weren’t part of the transaction.”
“We can take a rain check.”
Too soon. Steve has to shut Clint up with a firm tug on his elbow. “Stark?” he calls out quietly. “Can you hear me?”
"You snuck inside and snuck back out?"
"But who had you told?" Thor asked. "To whom have you said, 'I am bisexual?'"
“I love you, too. I would fight anyone anywhere for you, just name the time and place. Daniel knows this, and he has accepted it. You will always be in my life.
“I know what you’re thinking,” said Nat, “and that’s just his face. He always looks like that.”
"That may be true, but the question you need to ask yourself, Steven, is whether you were fighting
Silence, sure. If there was one thing Tony Stark was guaranteed to fail at, it was the quiet. Steve turned to look out the window, counted to five, and smiled when Tony caved.
He sighed and tried to project some confidence when he said, “Hey, Peggy.”
“WHERE’S STARK?!”
There weren’t any high notes to hit, nothing Steve couldn’t handle. And it summed up everything quite well. The feeling inside Steve’s stomach was a little funny. There was a freedom in it, now, being able to look at a man and admit he was handsome. Tony was so much of everything Steve hadn’t been allowed to want, part of him was still afraid to take it.
“Out.” Steve pointed to the front door. “I am banishing you from my apartment.”
Then he flung himself, bags and all, into the back of the limo. One smooth motion and his butt landed on the passenger-side seat. He placed the luggage at his feet and tilted back onto the headrest. Happy closed the door then settled into the driver’s seat.
Peggy’s smile only got bigger.
"Can I stay?"
“Go right ahead.”
Miss Potts dropped his hand and returned her fingers to their tap dance across her phone.
"That connected zero pieces of information for me."
"I want it established here and now that you are begging me to take you back."
"Now you are here with your face on every media network you've ever heard of, holding hands with one of the most famous men in the world. No matter how good you were at hiding, there is no concealing this relationship. One that you knew would involve cameras."
"You better get back in there."
"Dating a soldier is one thing, but a war hero is something else. Rhodey said you should’ve gotten the Medal of Honor. How did Pepper not know?"
Steve grabbed two glasses from the bar and filled them with water.
Another long pause. Tony pulled his float across the table and sipped until Steve spoke again.
"Grief can do that," Tony said. "I know more about that than I'd care to."
"I'll try my best, but he likes making it difficult."
“You decided this just now?”
, except to hold Tony as close as he could. Tony put one hand on the back of Steve's neck and allowed himself to be led. It was such a good, desperate kiss … Steve broke away only to pull Tony tight against his chest.
“I’ll make some more for you.”
"I believe you would be correct."
Steve answered, "Nobody. The army had lotsa different names for it, none of 'em nice." He took a deep, shaky breath before he continued. "My ma knew I was before I did. I mighta been thirteen when she asked if I looked at Bucky a little differently than I looked at other boys. Nobody said anything back then; it wasn't something people talked about, but I knew I wasn't gay. I told my ma that I looked at Buck the way I looked at girls and she said that was okay."
"How did you know where to go?"
As he waited for the signal to change, Steve watched people walk right by Tony without noticing he was there. Tony glanced over every few seconds, waiting, almost hoping for someone to see him. Like he couldn’t stand to be alone. He was wearing a violet zip-up hoodie and thick-rimmed black glasses, and Steve’s heart did a little flip. Tony was such a nerd, but he rarely looked it. That moment was true Tony Stark and Steve hoped he would see it more often.
“Cap’n Crunch! I’m downstairs.”
After a brief pause, Tony wondered, “Do you bleed stars and stripes?”
Again, they both ignored it.
No answer.
Steve tossed his legs over the side of the bed and felt more alive than he had the day before. His morning routine was the same, but it felt different. Instead of going through the motions, Steve was
By 6:00, Tony had fixed more problems in Steve’s apartment than he knew were there. Tony called Steve into the bathroom and turned the shower knob three-quarters to the right, where the optimal water temperature would be.
at five-thirty in the afternoon.
“I am completely serious.”
Tony's guest room was larger than Steve's apartment.
“No.” Steve shook his head. “My biggest purchase is a fourteen dollar sandwich at the deli. Sometimes a six dollar frappuccino after a run. My apartment is shit, but the cable is cheap enough and my pension covers all of it. Therapy’s paid for by the army as long as I make it every week. I have enough money to get by, and if I had as much money as Miss Potts may or may not have offered me, I wouldn’t know what to do with it.”
That’s the thing. They say, Steve’s just with you for your money. But you haven’t asked for money! You said we are giving you
"I assume Barnes was among the hostages."
"What do you know?"
Sam asked, “Did you like it?”
"If I ever had any doubt, it disappeared somewhere between 'bodyguard' and 'fairy boy.'"
-Tony does the impossible, possible...
-Don't tell me you're afraid of him?  –The scientist smiled funny, resisting the desire to die to laughter.
-... I do not know what happens to Tony...
-Brucie... –began Tony. –Help us. –his tone was pleading and full of fear.
-Nat...-said the blond. -how is it that Tony is pregnant? Is it possible? -questioned the captain.
-Tell me sir. –replied cordially.
-Anthoska... I'm going to love you even fattening up to the point of not being able to get out of bed. -He smiled. -And if you put yourself like a pig you'll look more adorable -he thought.
-Tony!
Plump (WinterIron) part I
-yes. –The doctor answered and came out of that place, turning to who knows where, since he did not want trouble, he went into the elevator and took out his cell phone to write a message to Captain –Steve your "Tony" is in danger. –and with that finished, he sent his message.
-Santo cielo...-Relaxed the millionaire. — Don't you ever do that again, Peter...
-lies... -grumble the younger.
And so they took another half hour, they knew that if they took his eyes off him, his little enemy would escape and it would be worse. It wasn't until our dear Captain America entered the scene.
Ring (IronStrange) Part v
-I didn't tell him anything, just to take care of his diet. -The blond knew he should be careful because when it comes to Tony, Barnes gets into his "killer" mode.
-Como... And after buying the ring, can we go eat?  -The genie made an irresistible face to Stephen.
The time in the complex was passing fast, that's when Steve came into the room meeting with Tony lying on the couch while he was eating doughnuts.
Ring (IronStrange) Part IV
-Are you going to abandon us? –This time it was Barton who put a look of puppy abandoned in the rain for the scientist to yield and help them.
-What? No, Tony, I'm just saying you're eating too sweet... — the captain said.
He was watching for a few seconds, analyzing that thing and looking for possible solutions to solve that because in a way did not want to approach, or crazy did, was then when Barton made his appearance.
-Sorry to interrupt. The King of Wakanda entered, watching everyone. --I was informed of a meeting where a contract will be discussed to win over Tony Stark, however I was not aware of the time of the meeting. --T'challa spoke, and immediately sat in the nearest chair. Gone a few seconds and Rogers didn't say a word, it looked like he was waiting for someone else.
-Just sit down...--He sighed frustrated the Captain, when he observed that everything was already in order, he decided to continue, hoping that no one else would interrupt him anymore. --Well, as I said before all this fuss, the contract must have certain rules, such as... -- the door was opened again interrupting Steve, but this time when everyone turned to see who it was surprised.
Tony laughed as Steve gapped at him for a moment,  “I love you too Steven Rogers.”  and laughed again as Steve wrapped strong arms around his body and kissed him.
“Of course I do Steve.  How could I not?”  Tony came closer and looked up at the super soldier through his long lashes.  “And after you take me out on this date, you can tell me how you plan for us to elope without Pepper killing us.  Because I don’t think it can be done, honestly.”
Natasha settled back into the seat and gave Steve a look.  “I have like twelve dollars.”  Natasha shook her head as she watched Steve give a deep sigh and stare despondent out the window.  He was brooding about Tony again, she could tell.  Nat rolled her eyes skyward and braced herself.  “Have you told Tony that you like him as more than a friend?  Have you even hinted at it?”
“You love me?” he asked as he pulled Tony closer.
Steve was quiet for a while before he asked;  “What if he says no?”
“What?”
“Hey Tony?”  Steve asks and tries to steady himself as Tony turns around.  He was always beautiful to Steve, but never more so than when the genius was relaxed and happy, in his element.
“He’s not going to say no Steve.”
Later after Steve has showered and gone to a local florist,
“Steve, I’ve loved you for, forever.”  Tony told him and Steve smiled and pressed his forehead to Tony’s.
“There’s a Taco Bell, want anything?”  Natasha asked, looking over at Steve.  He was driving them back from SHIELD headquarters in DC.  Some would think making the four hour trip every couple of days was a lot, and it was; but Natasha knew that Steve still held a deep seated dislike of airplanes.
“I like you Tony.  As more than a friend, and I’d like to take you out on a date.”
Natasha rolled her eyes then, because truth be told, once Tony realized that Steve adored him, loved him, there would be no going back, because while it’d taken Steve a while to realize he was in love with the inventor,
“Oh fuck off.” Natasha said, and laughed.
Tony hid his smile behind the flowers.  “I like you too Steve.”
Natasha shook her head.  “Have I ever, in all the years we’ve known each other, steered you wrong?”
Steve’s grip on the steering wheel got tighter for a moment before he exhaled through his nose and relaxed again.  “But what if he does?  What if I lose him as a friend over this?”
Steve rubbed his sweaty palms on his slacks and reminded himself to breathe.  “I uh, wanted to ask if you’d like to go out on a date.  With me.  Because I,  you’re an amazing friend Tony, really you're just swell, but I’d, what I mean to say is that-”  Steve cut himself off and let out a gust of air.
