"At least I can quit making excuses. Steve. There’s something I’d like to show you in the bedroom," Tony starts, and Steve lets out a nervous giggle that’s completely unlike him. "Well, there’s a few things I’d like to show you in there but the biggest one right now is my d—"
Tony starts talking about ballet and football players and his movement in the Iron Man suit, but Steve is too pleased to really question it.
Tony stops what he’s doing and walks over to his new roommate. He’s tall, blonde, and beefy and his eyes are probably the most beautiful shade of blue Tony has ever seen. The old-fashioned hairstyle and his long, long lashes already endear him to Tony in a way he hasn’t experienced since he met Rhodey.
"We’re going home," Steve agrees. "We’re going home, we’re going to get into the shower, I’m going to wash his touch off of you, and then I’m going to lay you out on
Natasha lets the silence settle between them like a warm, threatening blanket. The hairs on the back of Steve’s neck stand up.
Steve makes a soft, empathetic noise and continues to run his fingers softly through Tony’s hair, smiling at the way he relaxes and sighs into the touch.
"Why don’t we grab that box of donuts, I’ll take a quick shower, JARVIS can let everyone else know there’s food in the kitchen, and you and I can have breakfast in bed."
“Hey, I did not invite you here, into my home, just to be insulted,” Tony says, faux-offended. He reaches up to swat Steve’s hand away but ends up holding onto it instead. Tony’s skin is warm against his.
"I had an idea and wanted to make some adjustments to the communicators. JARVIS said you’d put one in your nightstand, I didn’t want to wake you so… Steve," he says, looking at him and finally holding eye contact. "What are these?"
Tiberius’ smile was more like a sneer as he spoke. “Tony and I used to date. Enthusiastically, if I remember correctly.”
Tony’s torn between applauding Steve’s thinly veiled insult and laughing at the bald-faced lie. Steve’s mind is like a steel trap, not to mention they’d had the ‘past relationships’ conversation a few weeks after they had started dating.
Tony looked at him up and down quickly. An odd expression overcame his face. “You actually listen to what your mother says?” He asked.
The first hint that he’s no longer alone comes to him via drawn-out groan, emanating from somewhere around the doorway behind him. The sound is more fitting a zombie-flick than the action that’s currently on the screen.
Steve laughed outright at that, and approached the stage. He peered up at Tony critically before pointing at the pole.
"I cannot believe I got hit by my own shield," he says, voice cracking from a dry throat. Tony immediately slides a cup of water in front of him and Steve takes it greedily with his free hand.
And then his heart skips a beat at his own realization, at the way things finally click into place for him, and his face must be a reflection of his thoughts because Clint laughs at him and pats him on the back.
"Captain Rogers, how has it been working with The Avengers now that you guys are officially a sanctioned team?"
"Tony, I’ve been thinking about this for awhile now and, well, the thing is I really like you. I thought maybe it was just a silly crush at first, you know, you’re handsome, intelligent, and ambitious so that’s not too surprising. But then I got to know you and I realized it’s not just a crush. I think you’re pretty amazing, actually. And I just—if you thought you might be interested—I’d love to see if we could maybe have something here? Between us? And I don’t mean—I don’t want to push you into anything. I’m not looking to jump into anything serious right away, but I thought—oh, hell. Tony would you like to go to dinner with me? on a date?"
Tony steps up into Steve’s space and Steve freezes for a moment before Tony takes his hands and arranges them into position.
"There is not a single part of my body that has not been touched, fondled, caressed, licked, or sucked by you and vice versa." He turns and lifts an eyebrow. "Are you really that concerned?"
Steve’s reporter opens her mouth to ask another question, but Steve can hear someone asking Tony for a picture of the two of them together. Tony refuses, insisting that Steve’s busy with his own interview but Steve can’t resist. He takes a step and reaches over, grabbing Tony’s hand and reeling him back in.
"It’s not, trust me. Anyway, I wanted to ask—since we’re both here and we haven’t seen each other since—do you want to grab some coffee?" Steve asked. He had gone for casual, but knew his face betrayed him. He’d bet money you could read his hopefulness a mile away.
"Well, this is me reminding you," he says. Automatically, his hand comes up and cups Tony’s face, his thumb stroking Tony’s cheekbone as they stare at each other like a couple of love drunk idiots. Dopey smiles and all.
do anything about it while Steve’s still his student. At least, nothing outside of his blatant staring and pretty overt flirting. But Steve ends up dropping Tony’s class the day before the final drop date. He cites the fact that he has overloaded on his art courses and he doesn’t have time to eat and sleep, much less study for something as intense as Tony’s class this semester.
"If you’re saying I looked at him like I’d want nothing better for him to bend me over this desk right now and—"
been asked an appalling number of times, who his favorite Avenger is, Steve often says he could never pick, it would be like picking a favorite child. It’s mostly true. He appreciates each and every one of them and what they bring to the table.
Steve, never wanting to be wasteful, gets on his computer, downloads the software and plugs in the original MP3 player and loads it up with some of his favorite songs from both his previous life, and from what he’s been able to listen to so far this time around. He slaps a sticky note on it that says, “Don’t be so wasteful. Listen to this, it’s only fair. - Steve” and calls up a courier service.
Steve’s happiness in this moment is incandescent. He could live in this singular moment in time and never want for anything more. And in this moment he would pledge his life to Natasha for pushing the both of them into it.
"Uh. Are you alright? Are you freaking out on me? I don’t have a paper bag for you to breathe into but, uh, if you want to talk, I’ve been there… After New—" He stops and takes in the curve of Steve’s cheek.
Steve wakes up to the sound of steady beeping, the smell of antiseptic, and the feeling of a warm hand in his. He inhales deeply and lets out a long sigh.
The silence that follows as they all watch Tony walk to the coffee pot and pour himself a mug is, if possible, more awkward than the conversation that his presence distracted them from. He must be able to sense it in the air because as soon as his mug is full, he turns around and clutches it to his chest protectively, like it’ll save him from what’s about to happen.
Even back then he ran the place. He brought in too much money for the higher-ups to do anything that might tick him off and send him to a competing club. Steve took major advantage of this, finding ways to make the working environment better for him and his peers by threatening to walk if management didn’t acquiesce.
Steve turns his blinding smile on Tony and wow, he completely understands the woman’s predicament. Sadly, the smile drops off as Steve takes in Tony’s expression and nods. Tony pulls him off down the hall and into the empty library, shutting the door quietly behind him.
Steve nearly jumped out of his skin. As it was, he jumped out of his chair and took a step back, prepared to fight—
“So,” Natasha says, taking the empty chair beside Steve. She watches the woman in a slinky red dress walk away before she props her elbow on the table and looks at Steve pointedly, chin in hand.
He freezes. The flood of relief that flows through him is almost dizzying when he realizes that it’s just Tony.
There’s a moment of silence, a moment where Tony is legitimately worried a fight is about to break out, but then Tiberius drops his wrist and takes a step back.
Steve is head over heels for one of the smartest men in the world, a man who was kidnapped and tortured and came out the other end a hero. A man made of iron and so full of bravery that sometimes it takes his breath away…
"Hey, team, listen up," Tony said into the comms and Steve’s heart faltered. "I saw a place on 38th and Madison. Let’s regroup and get some grub before we deal with… the entire world, I would assume."
Before Tony can turn around on his own, strong hands are pushing at his shoulders, spinning him and shoving him up against the door. He barely has time to take a breath before Steve’s lips are against his, his tongue delving into Tony’s mouth.
Two weeks later when he stumbles back in after a tense business trip and Steve greets him with a crushing hug and roaming hands, he doesn’t laugh when he finally has Steve stripped naked and on his stomach on the bed.
When Tony notices the change in the enrollment information at the beginning of the next class, he tells everyone to go out and enjoy the weather—Pepper is always telling him
Steve had the blushing trained out of him pretty quickly during Basic and the following few years with his Howling Commandos did nothing but reinforce that learning experience. Irish heritage or not, he could sit stone-faced in reaction to most anything, his cheeks never once flaring to color like they had so often done when he was younger.
The guy stands in the doorway, turning a shade of red that shouldn’t be so attractive on human skin, like he’s frozen on the spot.
rachel. rachelll. Steve coming back from a run and thinking he'll make Tony breakfast in bed only to run into Tony in the kitchen making Steve breakfast for when he gets back from his run
Tony who is standing over him in bed, clutching a bunch of papers in front of the open drawer of Steve’s bedside table. The relief evaporates as quickly as it came, Steve’s stomach churning.
Steve may not have time to eat and sleep but it turns out he has enough time to bend Tony over that desk a couple weeks later.
A minute later, Tony straightened up with a huff and took the earpiece out, tossing it on the workbench. He really needed to screen his calls better.
steve writing love letters to tony that he never intends for tony to see, he just writes them so he can get his dumb feelings down on paper bc HES SO FULL OF FEELINGS GOD HE LOVES TONY SO MU-HU-HUUUCH. whenever he gets overwhelmed he goes and writes it all down, he has stacks of love letters in his bedside table. and then one day for some reason tony finds the letters and is like holy shit
Steve’s stomach does a flip as he straightens. Tony just asked him out on a date. Tony Stark just seriously asked him out on the date. No sarcasm, no jokes. A legitimate date.
Tony just shrugs and pockets his phone before turning to head down the hallway. “Steve,” he says as he walks away, drawing out the name is some semblance of seduction. “You coming?”
Steve shakes his head and waves his hand. “Oh god, no. I was arrested plenty back when I was younger.” He laughs again. “Got into a lot of fights, you know?”
By the end of the song, Steve’s cheeks hurt from smiling and he finds that the coiled tension in his body has completely evaporated.
When Tony licks his way down Steve’s bare chest, Steve briefly thinks that he’ll have to remember to thank Clint later.
“Aw, Tony,” Steve replies and reaches out to pull Tony close to him. Steve instinctively puts his hands on Tony’s waist and eventually Tony’s hands settle on his shoulders. The music shifts into something slow and they sway back and forth like a couple of awkward teenagers at prom. “I’m always going to need you,” Steve says.
Fix idea: Tony has a half built CA shield on his table in IM 1 so what if he always dreamed of Steve being found & has been designing stuff for him for years. as a pet project or destresser. Then he comes back & Tony tries to hide it from him
Tony’s doesn’t take his hands off of Steve, but he certainly moves them. Quick enough, they’ve found their way to the hem of Steve’s shirt and slipped up underneath to press his fingers into the bare skin of Steve’s back.
Steve struggles to keep his eyes focused as he scrolls through more of SHIELD’s database. He leans back and rubs his eyes, sighing. Since Stark had taken them all in, he finds himself spending most of his free time like this, trying to devour and take in everything Natasha leaked.
Steve pulls back enough to whisper against his lips, voice low. “I’m sorry. I just couldn’t stand the way that woman was hanging on to you.”
It starts out, as you’d expect, with Tony sending Steve a playlist of must-listen music to help him catch up. Because even though it’s been well over a year since Steve has graced them with his presence, Tony knows it’s been a year full of battles and wars and very little downtime for Steve to just… relax.
He manages to get his knee between Tony’s thigh and Tony’s shirt completely untucked before he leans back, panting as he looks down at Tony.
But no, no one else seems to be concerned. Maybe they don’t realize… Tony’s the one who bought them after all. And they’ve been painted over and parts have been carved off to slot together. But he can still see the vein on the sides of a couple of them, for god’s sake!
Steve drops his bag on the lone king-size bed in the midst of a very large, upscale room, before he walks over to the gigantic window. The view is breathtaking and he takes a moment to appreciate it.
He nearly jumps at the sound of his name. A glance around the room tells him that he must have been lost in his own thoughts longer than anticipated, it’s now empty save for himself and one other. (He’s only briefly concerned with the amount of time he’s spent contemplating the dildos in front of him.) When he shifts his gaze, he finds Steve, who’s looking at him with eyes full of innocent concern.
Steve sighs and downs the rest of Tony’s drink and tries to think of a decent excuse to use for rejection number six.
Natasha watches Steve fidget in his seat when Tony walks into the kitchen. There’s something different. There’s… something in the air. Something that wasn’t there before.
Steve came to rest a couple of feet behind Tony as he finished talking. He stood there, holding his breath as he waited for a response.
"I’ve got no plans tomorrow night,” Steve said, giving Tony what he hoped was a flirtatious smile. With his track record on that type of thing, though, it may have been more of a grimace.
"The culmination of a lifetime of work. Ms. Potts has reliably informed me that Mr. Stark frequently toyed with the possibility of your being found. Alive. These were a sort of…welcome-home present from him were that to occur."
“He’s turned down at least five people asking him to dance,” Natasha says, returning her gaze to Steve, eyebrows raised.
So when he walked into the kitchen one morning after a full night’s sleep and spotted Steve standing half naked in front of the stove scrambling his typical half-dozen eggs, he could feel the warmth of blood rushing to his cheeks.
"Yeah, sure. What were you thinking?" Tony asked. Steve didn’t get a chance to answer before Tony continued."Wait, no, I’ve got just the place."
Steve’s brows furrow and Natasha gives him a sympathetic look. A sense of impending doom settles in the kitchen, like Steve is about to be involved in an awkward conversation. His fight or flight instinct is about to kick in and since there are no aliens or robots in the vicinity in need of a swift punch, he thinks flight would be the smart move to make.
He’s debating the most polite way to extricate himself from the situation, glancing around the room for a spark of an idea, when he spots Tony. Suddenly the need for politeness evaporates and Steve simply says, “Excuse me,” and walks away.
Steve walks into the kitchen, a pep in his step from a great night and a relaxing run, and skids to a halt at the scene he’s walked in on.
Damn. Maybe middle-of-the-possible-end-of-the-world wasn’t the best time to try his luck at dating. Especially with Tony Stark.
All of which they ignore for now, enjoying a slow and lazy kiss until they finally part and Tony looks at him, pure joy written into every line of his face.
Images explode onto the screen. Cross sections and plans of what looks to be his shield… except it’s not
Steve’s tempted to move, to have Tony sit up so he can undo the tie and divest him of the jacket. He wants to wipe away the traces of the day that have reduced the man who’s always so full of talkative energy to groans and mumbles and sluggish movements. But he catches the way Tony’s face is relaxing, the way his breaths are evening out, warming Steve’s skin through the fabric of his shirt, and thinks there will be plenty of time for that later.
Steve freezes, halfway between sitting and standing, as everyone turns to look at him. He collects himself slowly, straightening up and smoothing out the front of his shirt before he looks around the room, gives a brief nod, and walks out with his head held high.
He thinks Steve will shake his head and laugh before moving into the bathroom. He’s taken by complete surprise when Steve’s hips actually start to sway in time with the music. His breath catches in his throat when Steve stalks every so slowly towards him.
know better than to say anything about it while they’re making their way through the crowd, though, he can feel the tension thrumming through Steve’s body through the thick material of his jacket. The moment they’re out the door, Steve leads them around the building into the alleyway and before Tony can speak, Steve’s got him shoved up against the wall, his tongue already licking his way into Tony’s mouth.
"Similar enough that there would be… compatibility between our two species. It would not result in offspring but I’ve heard it’s considered incredibly pleasurable for both parties. More so than same-species unions."
Tony laughs and laughs when Steve finds it in the shower. He even laughs when Steve grabs the shower head attachment and turns it on its most forceful setting, dousing Tony as he stands at the sink, toothbrush still in mouth. He lets out an insane little giggle when Steve finally gets out of the shower and walks over to him, rolling his eyes but smiling, before giving him a long kiss and heading to their bedroom to get dressed.
Steve uses every inch of his height to his advantage as he addresses Tiberius again, looking down at him.
“Alright, first things first… put your foot right here,” Tony says, nudging Steve’s foot into place.
Tony pulls at Steve’s shoulder and Steve turns easily, tears streaming down his face. He sniffles and tries to stop laughing, trying to tell Tony something, but it just seems to spur him on. It’s enough that Tony’s own smile at watching Steve is almost painful.
No one else seems to notice that the centerpiece on the coffee table is made up entirely of dildos. Tony, however, walks into the room, eyes immediately drawn to the new addition, and nearly chokes on his coffee. Bruce pats him on the back and gives him a concerned look that Tony quickly waves off, and shrugs before sitting down on the couch and setting his book down on the table. Right next to the dildo sculpture.
he’d love to go on a date with Tony, he’s only been head over heels for him for the past eight months, but then he hears the familiar sound of his shield slicing through the air.
Tony and Steve, in jail (for god knows what. Probably some stupid reason thanks to Tony), and Steve starts to have a panic attack cuz its his first time being in real trouble.
The next time Steve saw Tony was in front of the grand jury. He watched in awe as Tony danced around the questions before finally driving points home that no one could refute. Over and over they tried to trip him up, tried to get him to say anything that would give them legal grounds to send him or the rest of the team away for good, but he didn’t falter once. It was a sight to behold.
Steve catches movement out of the corner of his eye. At the mention of his name, Tony, who is standing a few feet away giving his own interview, turns to smirk at him.
Tony ignores the comment. “Maybe we can try swing dancing next. You know, get a little hot and sweaty.”
Steve answers by removing his pants and stepping up in front of Tony, resting his hand on Tony’s waist.
I love when Tony has fail moments like IM3 where he calls his armor & it gets hits something & smashes to pieces just as it's about to get to him. Or the whole city is burning and he says 'I think I did ok'. So how about Steve fail moments. He's so bloody prefect with his shield throws. Would flirting from Tony on the battle field case Steve to miss the shield (or get hit by it)? Would Tony find out Steve likes him due to Steve's sudden clumsiness around him. I love awkward steve
"Alright," Tony claps his hands together, a wicked gleam in his eyes. "Let’s show these idiots not to mess with the science teachers, shall we?"
Tony gets the hint and from then on simply takes the MP3 player from Steve whenever they see each other (Steve who has taken to always having it on him), adds a new playlist, and hands it back to Steve without comment. If they go too long without seeing each other, Tony swings by Steve’s apartment and they inevitably end up spending the next few hours talking, usually ordering a pizza, and sometimes popping in a movie that Tony thinks Steve absolutely needs to see. Pretty soon, it turns into a weekly ritual.
Tony clears his throat, sets his mug on the table, and stands up. “Fuck yes I am,” he says and follows Steve down the hall.
"Are we going to have a problem?" Steve asks after a moment, his voice is low and threatening. It’s enough to set the hairs on the back of Tony’s neck on end.
By the next day, a couple of rounds in bed, Steve showing a routine on the pole, another round on the floor, and more laughter than he thought possible, Tony learned that the stripper pole wasn’t the only pole Steve knew how to work.
“I’m a little rusty myself, but I can teach you enough to impress the next person who asks. You’ll be buying a yellow gown in no time.”
The look that Tony gives him when they wake up a mess of entwined limbs and unstoppable smiles tells him that Tony feels the same way.
Unfortunately, before Steve can remove himself from the situation, they’re all distracted by a noise in the doorway.
“Ty, it’s been ages,” he says. And he’d like for it to be even longer, but he’s trying the whole ‘civil’ thing lately.
Could you please write a thing where a guy Tony slept with at one point sees him again and is all up in Tony's business while Tony is asking him to back off and Steve goes into full over protective boyfriend mode? PLEASE AND THANK YOU!!!!
“Alright, Fred Astaire,” Tony says, his arms crossed over his chest. He’s clearly trying to pretend he’s upset at Steve laughing at him but he can’t stop the grin spreading across his own face. “Get off your ass and see if you can do it, then.”
A string of garbled gibberish falls from Clint’s mouth, along with a small marshmallow. Steve looks over at him to see Clint staring back, inquisitive.
needs to get out more, after all—and heads over to the art building. He knows that’s where Steve will be.
As he delves deeper, he stumbles on something even more unusual—what looks to be a kid’s drawings. Drawings of Captain America standing next to a small dark-haired boy looking proud. Drawings of that same little boy holding a shield… It’s been a long, long time since Steve has been this lost.
A trick that Tony still hasn’t mastered, judging by the way he lay face down on the stage, a deep chuckle coming from the bar. Tony righted himself and smiled over at Steve who lifted an eyebrow in return.
"We’re going to need a shower after this, I think," Tony said. "And I’m going to have to leave a massive tip for housekeeping."
“I don’t think I’ve seen you around here before,” Steve said. He cringed almost immediately. He was skirting way too close to lame pick-up lines when all he wanted to do was introduce himself.
Instead of parting and pretending it didn’t happen, Steve straightens his proverbial backbone and leans down, tilting Tony’s head up with his hand, and captures Tony’s lips in a kiss. The crowd around them goes silent for the same amount of time it takes for Tony to open his mouth and turn the kiss into something a little more PG-13 than PG (hint: not long at all) and then there’s blinding flashes of light and deafening shouts of questions.
“She won’t let me get any. But,” Steve grinned, “only four months until I’m eighteen and then she can’t do anything about it.”
Tony looked surprised, like it was something he had never considered. “I don’t know… yeah, maybe. Someday.”
Steve goes limp in the chair, like all of his strings have been cut. It’s one thing to see the drawings from Tony’s childhood, he’s gotten fairly used to the idea (as much as he can) that he was a hero to more than one generation. But the other files, things that were made by adult Tony, the ‘coming home’ presents…
Tony mumbles something against Steve’s stomach, the words intelligible but the tone makes clear just how bad the day was.
Steve bends over, placing his hands on the arms of the chair, bracketing Tony where he sits. He leans in close enough that his nose is almost brushing Tony’s.
"You were so distracted by the idea of going out on a date with me, that you forgot to catch your shield?"
“I’m going to lead first,” Tony says. “Just to get a sense of how you move. So just follow me and don’t worry too much about the steps. Though I would appreciate it if you avoided my feet.”
Plates and silverware were strewn about the table and the bed. A variety of syrups sat on the floor near them. Steve had made crepes that morning and Tony was, once again, impressed. Every day, Steve seemed to come up with some new talent or ability that had Tony falling a bit more in love with him.
Tony grinned at him, like always. “Hey, Steve. What can I do for you? Besides keep your ass out of jail, that is.”
Steve turns back to the table and sees Natasha smiling to herself. Clint has become re-absorbed into the television.
rachel can u write (if u want to) steve flirting with tony all the time like in the trailer and tony is just COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS like it's ridiculous but at the end he realizes and MAKE OUTS AND STUFF!!!
He sits down in the open chair and sips carefully at his coffee, eyes not leaving the sculpture. He doesn’t realize his mind has wandered until someone speaks.
He’s only barely just gotten over his unplanned appearance on the front page of multiple tabloids for feeding ducks in Central Park. How was he supposed to know about the perils of feeding bread to waterfowl? It was perfectly fine back in his day.
Tiberius smiles down at him and Tony fights the urge to gag. He reaches up and brushes a thumb along Tony’s cheekbone and Tony flinches back. He mentally berates himself for the showing of weakness, but the idea of Tiberius’ hands on him for any longer overcomes that particular shame.
Tony nodded and joked his way through his brief orientation, and Steve kept right on smiling, the picture perfect gentleman even as Tony paraded around in a red thong. When they parted and Steve went back to his office to make a few phone calls, Tony was a little disappointed to say goodbye, but man did he appreciate the view.
Steve shrugged. “They’re just small holes. They’ll shrink up and pretty much disappear if I leave them out long enough. Tattoos are a different story though.”
“Say, Steve,” Tony says, stopping in the doorway. “I’ve got something you need to take a look at downstairs. You free?”
"Very… very interesting. You’re very… good with your hands. You must know how to work the material well," he says, trying to wind Steve up a little.
Everyone on the team thinks it’s adorable that two full-grown men are exchanging the modern day equivalent of mixtapes. The gossip makes Steve pause and think for a moment, but ultimately he decides it’s just Tony being Tony and doesn’t put much more thought into it.
"Steve," Tony says seriously. "For all intents and purposes, they sent us on vacation. I may be a workaholic but sometimes even I can recognize when I need a break. Why not take it on someone else’s dime? Even if they think they’re pulling one over on me."
So Steve isn’t really surprised when, the day of their first ‘official’ date, a new playlist pops up. The name of which makes Steve’s body heat all over. His nerves are a bit shot, despite how well he and Tony know each other he knows that in their situation even this simple step is a huge one. His stomach is in knots and he keeps bursting into a fit of hysterical giggles whenever he thinks about it. Steve knows that he should resist, that he should wait and see what songs Tony’s chosen for that night when it happens… but he can’t help but peek. He uses his nerves as an excuse, maybe it will calm him down to get insight into Tony’s mind for the night.
Steve has mostly tuned out the ambient noise of the kitchen (read: Clint speed-eating his customary breakfast—an overfilled bowl of sickeningly sweet cereal) while he eats his eggs and reads the news feed that JARVIS has kindly curated for him on his tablet, so he doesn’t notice it right away.
Steve sighed. He could take a hint and he knew when he wasn’t wanted. He let the attempted conversation lapse into silence while he watched Bucky and Natasha on the ramp. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Tony tapping away at his phone. Every once in awhile, though, he thought he saw Tony steal a glance in his direction. It was probably just his imagination.
(Chris Evans & RDJ during a press junket) where Steve and Tony accidentally out their relationship during a press line at an event because they’re so damn handsy with each other
They got along well, Steve and Tony, for all their differences. Tony’s sarcasm and wit always seemed to bring a smile to Steve’s face, and Steve’s earnestness and charm made Tony warm all over. Not to mention, the man was an encyclopedia of dirty limericks that always had Tony laughing.
He had planned on downing some orange juice, taking a quick shower, and then coming back to make breakfast, hoping to surprise tony in bed. If he was honest with himself, he was mostly hoping that if he stopped Tony from getting up, he could keep Tony in bed for other reasons. But those plans go up in flames when he sees what’s in front of him.
The cell door slams shut, echoing down the hall. It’s the middle of the night and the small town jail is practically deserted. Tony stands in the middle of the room, taking in his surroundings, and wondering just how the hell they managed to end up here.
Tony lifts the pillow and glares at Steve, who raises his hands in mock surrender before standing up and crossing the room to turn out the lights. He tries to bite down on his desire to say ‘I told you so’.
How about the cooking cliché? Cooking and sexual tension don't go well together. Do with that what you will! ;)
Steve furrows his eyebrows. He doesn’t know what the answer could possibly be that would turn Tony this serious.
"While I would relish the vast amount of free time your untimely death would give me, I don’t want you dead quite yet."
Or, at least, that is until The Avengers happen. Then he decided maybe it was time after all to stop drinking and to maybe not thrust himself in the spotlight quite as often. He finally grew up, what could he say? It only took him some forty odd years.
He approaches Steve and sets a hand on his shoulder. He’s not big on comforting people and this thing between he and Steve is still a little new (and exciting, which may explain the current predicament) so he’s not sure what exactly he
"It’s been far too long," says the smarmy voice over Tony’s shoulder, sending an unpleasant shiver down his spine.
Tony watches, interested, as they shake hands. By the way Tiberius’ eye twitches he gets the feeling that Steve is giving a new meaning to the term ‘firm handshake’. To his credit, Tiberius tries his best to appear unfazed, but Tony knows him well enough to see the cracks in the facade and the way he clenches and unclenches his hand when Steve lets go.
Steve lets out a small laugh, and sets his sketchbook on the arm of the couch, and cards his fingers through Tony’s hair. Tony’s arms snake around his waist awkwardly, pressing his face even further into Steve.
Starting out as a stripper, he worked nights, spent mornings at the community college taking business classes (getting a few glances the times he didn’t manage to get all the glitter off of him), followed by a strict exercise routine at the rec center, and then he’d sleep away the rest of the day before starting it all over again.
"Now, Mr. Stone. Tony and I both appreciate the role you had in his past," he says as he takes a step forward, crowding Tiberius. "But I’m afraid that’s where you should remain. I’m going to speak for both of us when I say, outside of civil pleasantries, there is and will be no room for you in Tony’s future. It’s all full up, I’m afraid."
Steve smiles, flashing a row of blinding white teeth. His cheeks turn a little pink in an endearingly human gesture.
Tony rolls his eyes. “No experimenting with explosions without supervision. Although I really don’t see the reason why.”
For now, he turns the volume of the television down, and settles in, ready to help Tony in whatever way he can.
"That’s right, I forget you used to do this," Tony added. He picked up his towel and made his way to Steve, settling himself on the edge of the stage, swinging his legs just a bit.
The rest of the Avengers send Tony and Steve to a couple's resort under the guise of it being an undercover mission but mostly to try and get them together.
He spent the next two hours working up a sweat, swinging around the pole, and gyrating to the music. It was a build up, though, to a finale Tony had been working on for months now. A trick that required an insane amount of core control and perfect balance.
While they may not have gotten off on the best foot originally, he likes to think they’ve become friends. In fact, he kind of wishes he could spend
Steve watches Tony’s eyes flicker around, a crease growing between his brows. He laughs and walks over and wraps his arms around Tony’s waist.
"Can you display all the files related to the Super Soldier project and, well, any files directly related to me?"
How about the cliche-iest (?) cliché of them all: Tony and Steve have to hide their relationship for whatever reason (Tony's company/Steve's reputation/people are stupid homophobes) and then something happens, one of them is in danger or hurt, or something and then BAM! It's not a secret any more. :)
“Why did you agree to this, then? I would’ve been fine—you didn’t have to—” Steve instinctually moves to take a step back, hurt and flinching away from the answer. Tony’s hands tighten on him, the intent more than strength keeping Steve in place.
Bucky rolled his eyes. He was about to speak again when someone yelled his name, very loudly, interrupting him.
"Oh, well," Steve laughs. "Tony’s certainly had his share of life experience, but I can’t hold that against him. I guess if anything, I’d have to thank you. No matter how insignificant, every piece of Tony’s past has shaped him into the man I love today.”
On screen, they’re still gossiping about the state of Tony’s love life, which means the picture of him and Pepper has only been relegated to the background behind the hosts instead of taking up the entire screen.
Steve nods shortly but doesn’t move. When Steve opens his eyes, the look he gives Tony makes him forget how to breathe.
That was why he was at the club that day. The bar and stage were empty but Tony could see the glow of the light under Steve’s door, indicating his presence. Not wanting to bother him (yet), Tony set up the music and got to work.
“When Natasha said you should teach me how to dance the first time… you said you don’t dance. But then we all saw you in that picture with Pepper and, well, obviously you know
“He looks lonely,” Bucky said. “Why don’t you go keep him company?” He winked and turned away before Steve could say anything unfavorable.
Steve leans down and rests his forehead against Tony’s. They breathe each other in for a minute, Tony rubbing his hands up and down Steve’s back in an effort to relax him.
Tony smiled at him and Steve felt his face heat just a little, surprised at his sudden boldness. And ‘smooth’ was not something Steve had ever been described as.
Whenever Steve and Tony go on vacation Steve insists on staying at a place that has, at the very least, a kitchenette so he can make Tony breakfast in bed for at least one day of their trip and he always makes breakfast foods from the cuisine of the country they're in :3 GOOD MORNING RACHEL
Steve beams at the reporter with a completely genuine smile. Even though he’s been asked this question dozens of times that day, the thought of his teammates, the thought of his home, makes him happy.
Steve lifted an eyebrow. “She’s my ma. And she’s all the family I have. Besides, I’ve had enough broken bones to last me a lifetime.”
He narrows his eyes at the expressions on the everyone’s faces, and then locks on to Steve. He pauses, searching for something, and then breaks out into a large, scandalized grin.
Steve is about to say something sympathetic that would probably sour the whole mood but he’s saved by Tony telling JARVIS to play the next song.
"It was nice to meet you, Mr. Stone," Steve says, ice in his voice as he puts his arm around Tony again and they turn towards the exit.
Luckily for Tony, he spent most of his life under the glare of harsh, hot lights and it wasn’t unusual for his face to become red with heat, exertion, or simply flush with drink. He always had an excuse handy as to why his cheeks have suddenly gone crimson, and it definitely never had anything to do with something as lowbrow as emotion.
Steve is half-heartedly sketching on the couch, the television tuned to some mindless action movie that he finds himself glancing at every once in a great while, mildly interested. His attention isn’t particularly grabbed by either activity but in a way this
So he defaults to what he usually does when he’s lost and unsure. He looks at Tony. Tony, who’s still smiling at him but with something softer, more intimate on his face. Tony shrugs as if to say, ‘What the hell?’
(They break apart at the sound of someone clearing their throat. The look on the nurse’s face vaguely reminds Steve of small children on Christmas morning.)
Natasha’s head tilts slowly, looking at Steve like she’s never seen him before, Bruce’s eyebrows are making an effort to join his hairline, and Clint’s jaw has apparently come unhinged.
Tony’s eyes widen as his blood rushes south. He finds himself involuntarily leaning forward, but Steve stands up again and heads out of the room. When he reaches the doorway he turns back to look at Tony.
The next day, there’s another box at his doorstep and Steve rolls his eyes because he really doesn’t need two MP3 players and it would be just like Tony to do that instead of updating the one he already has.
Steve is honestly more than a little tired of people ending conversations with him by just walking away and one of these days he’s going to prove that he’s not above sitting on someone to stop them from leaving prematurely.
"I wasn’t just ‘pretty good,’ Tony. I was damned good. Still am. You’d be able to learn a few things from me."
Tony craned his neck, tilting his head up from the pillow it had been resting on, to look at Steve. Steve with the puffy red lips, wide bright eyes, and chocolate syrup smearing his mouth.
Even though he knows full well what’s going on, the smile on Steve’s face still manages to creep Tony out just a tiny bit. He’s surprised that Tiberius is still trying to talk to them, much less the fact that he’s holding eye contact with Steve.
Steve stuck his tongue out, loving the way Tony’s eyes widened when he spotted the barbell. He pulled his tongue back in after a moment.
Steve gives him a long, knowing look, before turning to Tiberius. “Hello, I don’t think we’ve met before. I’m Steve.”
It’s weird. For all that Steve and Tony have been up close and personal in the gym, sparring and practicing as a team and even one-on-one, this feels different.
Steve wakes to the sound of rustling paper, immediately aware of two things. Fact number one is that it’s the middle of the night, if the darkness of the room is anything to go by. Fact number two is that he knows he went to bed alone, but there’s quite clearly someone standing over him next to his bed.
"Tiberius Stone," he says through his smile before narrowing his eyes at the obvious confusion written on Steve’s face.
"Images Ms. Potts scanned into the database. They were found among some of Mr. Stark’s possessions in storage."
He knows he shouldn’t have isolated himself at the end of the bar, tucked into the corner of the room. That’s just asking for trouble. Though, to be fair, trouble seems to have no problem finding Tony. Corner or not.
. When they parted, lips red and plump, they grinned each other other like a couple of lovestruck fools.
It’s almost anti-climactic, after how much Steve had built the concept up in his head. Like learning how to dance was some sort of Everest he would never be able to climb. But, surprising no one but himself, Steve picks it up fast.
Steve was stunned at how much he wanted to fix whatever had put that look into Tony’s eyes, despite the fact that they had just met. Knowing they didn’t know each other well enough to pursue the topic, he went in a different direction.
When Steve is close enough, his pants left on the floor behind him, he straddles Tony’s lap and leans in to growl into his ear. “What makes you think I don’t have any moves of my own?”
Steve grins in response, knowing that Tony is about to do something brilliant. And thinking that maybe later he and Tony can do something dirty.
Eventually Steve learns how to use them as a barometer for Tony’s mood. JARVIS helps by populating the playlists with statistics regarding what Tony listens to. He learns to scale back the banter when Tony’s been listening to what Steve mentally refers to as the ‘Fuck Off’ list, to find an excuse to visit him in the lab when he’s listening to his ‘I’m Sad But I’ll Never Admit To It’ list, and then Steve finally gathers the courage to kiss him stupid when JARVIS kindly points out the list that Tony tends to listens to whenever Steve leaves the workshop. The one that’s full of songs Steve knows that Tony would never admit to listening to. Songs that make Steve smile.
"No scar. Tony’s got a pretty big scar on his, well," his eyes flicker to the screen and back, "that he got a few years ago. So either that’s not Tony, or it’s an… old…" He trails off, realizing what he just admitted to.
“Ballroom,” Tony says. “Eight o’clock tonight, twinkletoes.” Steve’s about to protest but Tony keeps talking. “The Lannister twins here are not invited. I’ll have JARVIS electrify the doorknobs if I need to.”
Steve followed the direction of Bucky’s nod and spotted the person in question immediately. He sat on the small set of metal bleachers in perfect view of all the equipment. Even from this far away, Steve was a little struck by how attractive he was.
"This mission. There’s nothing going on around here that could be considered criminal," he says, picking up a menu from the table and setting it back down immediately. “Unless you count the prices.”
Steve is stuck in the middle of a stilted conversation with a woman whose name he should know but can’t quite manage the effort it takes to remember. He feels bad about it, kind of. Or at least he would if she wasn’t taking every opportunity to put her hands on him, despite him constantly shrugging off the contact and stepping away. She just steps right with him.
"I hope it was the good kind of distraction at least, otherwise the fact that I’ve been holding your hand for the past couple of hours is about to get super awkward."
Bucky laughed. “Sure thing,” he said. He started to head towards where Natasha was standing on the top of a ramp before he stopped and looked back at Steve.
"I’d love to, Steve, but Pepper’s got a few things she wants me to do while I’m in town. We should get the team together soon, though," Tony said. "It’d be nice to see everyone when we aren’t being hunted down by aliens or genocidal robots. I don’t know if I can remember what everyone looks like without blood and dirt on their faces."
Steve leans in a little closer, inches from Tony’s face. “I’m sure your superiors would be interested in data collection. I am willing to be… experimented on.”
Tony doesn’t look at him, his eyes remaining fixed on the pages upon pages in his hands as he turns enough to sit on the bed next to Steve. The warmth of Tony’s thigh against his own does little to settle his nerves.
Steve laughs and leans back, looking at Tony’s face, his heart warming at the expression he finds there. “Yeah, once or twice.”
They lean back into each other and this time Steve nips at Tony’s bottom lip, relishes the feel of Tony’s tongue soft and velvet against his own, delights in the scratch of Tony’s beard against his clean-shaven skin.
What if (instead of finding it annoying as he does in so much fic) Steve actually LIKES Tony's music?
He’s expecting heavy bass and slow, sensual beats. It surprises him when the sound of a bright, happy guitar fills his bedroom.
The air goes still around them. Steve can’t tell if the silence is from JARVIS taking a cue and turning the music off or if it’s just the muffled silence of his sudden rush of adrenaline.
Steve cups Tony’s face with his hand, his thumb resting on Tony’s cheekbone as he deepens the kiss. He tries pulling Tony as close as possible while also pressing forward until Tony laughs into the kiss.
Steve’s mouth snapped shut. Alright, he thought. At least he had a firm, clear answer. He’d gotten over heartbreak before, he could do it again. He nodded shortly and made his way quickly out of the lab.
Steve struggles, half-debating making a joke of them and trying to brush them off. Or, maybe if he asks Tony, they can just forget about the whole thing and pretend it didn’t happen. But Steve’s not a coward. He straightens his back and meets Tony’s gaze unflinchingly. Faltering only once, he lifts his hand up and cups Tony’s cheek gently, stroking his thumb along the soft skin before dropping it back down to his lap.
"I’m Steve," says Steve and his grip on Tony’s hand is firm and confident even if the expression on his face doesn’t quite match. And Tony’s already thinking about how best to move the furniture so he’ll never miss one of Steve’s smiles again.
Steve’s chair screeches against the tile as he tosses his napkin down on a plate still full of food and follows Tony out the door.
"I was thinking that we should hang out sometime," Tony continues. "As in… without other people around. Like a date," He stops and inhales right as Steve lands, rolling into the impact and popping back up on his feet.
At first it was just because Tony was always on him about listening to ‘real’ music, and getting caught up. It’s helpful, Steve thinks. Tony certainly has his preferences, but overall he has a pretty wide range of music available and Steve would rather take a chance and randomly find a gem than ask for recommendations and get nine different opinions from seven different people. He learned his lesson the first time they tried to watch a movie together as a team.
Tony’s only slightly upset he doesn’t see the look on Tiberius’ face as they leave, but Steve’s expression more than makes up for it. He knows it’s petty and immature, but seeing Steve jealous sends a zing of pleasure through him.
Steve nods, eyebrows furrowed. “Hmm, the name’s just not ringing a bell,” he says and then chuckles to himself. “I’m sorry, my memory’s not too great. If it’s not important, it tends to fall through the cracks.”
He sat in the cool night air and listened to the sounds of the city around him, leaning his head back on the patio chair and closing his eyes. It was painful, sure, but it was better than the constant uncertainty that plagued him every time he thought of Tony. He just hoped he hadn’t made things awkward between them. Not that he’d see Tony until the world needed saving again—
Tony laughs and Steve watches as he loosens his tie before flopping backwards on the bed, Steve’s luggage bouncing at the impact. He stretches lazily before crossing his arms under his head and looking at Steve through heavy-lidded eyes.
Barely a month later, Steve has mostly forgotten about the weird interaction between the three of them.
"Well, in that case," he says as he leans down, hovering inches away from Steve’s face. Tony looks at him for a moment, gauging his reaction, before he smiles and presses his lips to Steve’s. The kiss itself is soft and gentle but the man behind it sets Steve’s nerves on fire.
So much for the undercover gig, he thinks. Then he thinks about how he’s going to have to explain to Pepper why he and Steve were arrested. And Coulson. Fury’s face might make it all worth it, though. Either way, it’s going to be a fun day when they get back to New York.
friendship between them, but maybe he can manage to swallow his own pride and extend the olive branch.
By eight o’clock that night, Steve is… well, he’s nervous, truth be told. He knows it’s not a big deal. It’s just dancing. It’s dancing with
Whatever reason Tony has for not wanting to dance with Steve—since it seems apparent his issue is with Steve and not with dancing in general—is something Steve would rather not hear in front of an audience.
So Steve listens, ready to dislike the music the way he had first disliked Tony… but finds himself enjoying it. He actually really, really enjoys it and finds himself listening to some of the songs multiple times before moving on to the next. He’s also a little ashamed at himself for jumping to conclusions.
“My ma? No. She’d never do that to me,” Steve said, absolutely certain. “She might lay in a guilt trip here and there, but isn’t that how all mothers are?”
Steve laughed. “You were, I mean it. You should’ve seen my testimony. Watching paint dry would’ve been more interesting,” Steve said.
Natasha shrugs. “Let one of them teach you,” she says, waving her free hand towards the room at large.
Okay, Steve thought. Maybe he just hadn’t been clear before. He was never any good at the whole flirting and asking someone out thing. He could take charge in all areas of his life except for this one, it seemed. He was going to settle this once and for all. He even had a plan, this time. He was going to find Tony and ask him straight up if he’d like to go to dinner with him. Alone. On a date.
His eyebrow is lifted and he’s leaned into Tony’s space ever so slightly. His voice a little huskier and oh, wow—is he
Steve hesitates, craning his neck to look over his back at where Tony is positioned between his legs. A crease forms between his brows, worried.
Tony hums in response as they continue to sway. Steve resists the temptation to pull Tony close and rest his cheek against Tony’s beard, the way he sees in the movies.
So, tonight I volunteered at some carnival/fair and I worked the glitter tattoo station. I had these little girls give me all these tattoos and I'm covered in glitter! What if Steve and/or Tony worked the station? Fury?
Someone (let's be honest it's almost 100% probably Tony) anonymously deposits a huge bag full of dildos in Steve's room thinking it will embarrass him and/or make him moody and irritated (but instead he gets all artsy crafty with them. Paints some of them, uses some of them creatively in decorations and then leaves them randomly around the tower to the frustration of the others. Tony is impressed, amused and a bit turned on by the thought of Steve handling them while he's working with them.
Within five years, he’d completed his degree and managed to find the financial backing to buy the club. That was the day he hung up his pretty little red, white, and blue g-string for good. Tony was only just starting in the business then, but even he had heard about Steve Rogers and was disappointed that he’d never had the chance to see him in action.
There’s silence followed by a loud peel of high-pitched laughter. He shoots a look at Tony, who quickly tries to school his face back to a serious expression but fails miserably.
shield. It—no, they, as there are multiple designs, are clearly inspired by his shield but they’re all different. And they’re all brilliant. Not only that but there are sketches of motorcycles, upgrades to his uniform, plans for a jet pack, and so many other things clearly designed with Steve in mind, that he finds himself at a complete and total loss.
One day Steve falls asleep while drawing in the workshop, face down and almost drooling into the couch. Tony goes over with a sharpie, pulls Steve's sweats down a little, and draws the Iron Man helmet on Steve's butt
"I’m sorry," Steve says quietly. "I don’t know… I don’t know what came over me. But seeing him touch you like that. I’m sorry, I shouldn’t—"
Everyone is watching now, with a variety of expressions. There are a couple of grimaces, a look of surprise, and one of intense interest as the clip starts. It’s short, showing what little they can on a cable show, starting out with a shot of the back of a man’s head. There’s a bout of laughter, one that does sound eerily like Tony, and then the camera pans down, blurring out the woman on the bed but giving a clear shot of the man’s rear.
But then he hears Tony’s name and he looks up at the screen, only to be greeted by a picture of Tony and Pepper slow dancing. He vaguely remembers Tony leaving the mansion in a tux the night before and has another vague awareness that it was for some gala or another. It must have been something for Stark Industries, if Pepper was there as well.
Tony stared at him in disbelief for a long moment. “You know, there’s a nice secluded bench up on a hill on the other end of the park. Can’t really see it unless you know it’s there and are looking for it.” Tony said, never breaking eye contact.
And then it’s a flurry of activity, of hands pulling and pushing, a door slamming shut, flicks of tongue, teeth nipping at lips, and tripping and laughing their way through Steve’s living room and straight to the bedroom.
Tony tsks as he rolls out and stands up, brushing the dirt off the front of his toga. Then he looks up and notices Steve’s state of dress.
"You weren’t complaining about it last night," Steve replies, dipping his head and pressing a kiss to Tony’s jaw. "This is a little… much, don’t you think?"
Steve spends the day internally freaking out back at his apartment, and when there’s a knock at his door around nine that night, he knows precisely who it is. What he doesn’t know is how to act around the man he just realized he was in love with. He doesn’t know what he’s going to do when he opens that door and is faced with Tony’s smile and Tony’s wide, brown eyes.
Tony’s grin is dirty and perfect and just like him. “There’s a lot I’ll suffer for a week alone with you… I just can’t wait until they find out you and I have been together for months. I’ll have to make sure JARVIS gets a good image of the looks on their faces.”
“Spoiled little rich kid with important parents,” Tony says. There’s something in his tone, though. Steve doesn’t think it’s the whole truth.
"I’ve had my share of experience in the area," Steve says, giving Tony a long look that has his stomach twisting. "You just need to know the strengths and weaknesses of what you’re working with. Learn how to manipulate it, learn how to handle it in just the right way and eventually it’ll do anything you want it to."
"Tony, unless you’ve figured out how to to turn all these machines off, I don’t want to know what you’re thinking," Steve says, dodging a blast before pausing to peer at the distance from his rooftop to the next.
Steve watches as the screen in front of him populates with a myriad of files and folders, scanning for something interesting to start with. There’s one folder that catches his attention. An unusual one that doesn’t fit the naming convention of everything else collected from the SHIELD database. Curiosity piqued, he leans forward and gently taps on the icon.
They were in each other’s space, leaning in further as the exchange went on, Steve’s height making him loom over Tony as he sat on the stage. Tony saw the way Steve’s eyes flicked down to his mouth and he couldn’t help but to lick his lips, drawing his tongue out along the bottom slowly, enjoying the way Steve’s eyes followed the motion.
He’s actually not terrible, to his own surprise. He manages to avoid stepping on Tony’s feet and the only time he even comes close to stumbling is when he gets distracted. Maybe it’s because he’s so used to being eye-to-eye with Tony when he’s in the Iron Man suit. Or maybe it’s because he’s never been around Tony barefoot before. But when Steve notices it, it’s suddenly all he can think of. Tony is kind of short. Sure, it’s only a handful of inches and Tony isn’t really a small man all things considered, but he’s smaller than Steve.
In between calls to assemble and board meetings, they manage to work their way through the catalog of dances Tony knows offhand. When Tony mentions it, Steve is afraid their lessons will end there (he might even think for a split second that maybe he can pretend to be worse than he is—just to squeeze a few more lessons out of Tony) but Tony just shrugs it off and says it can’t hurt for him to learn new things as well.
And when the man sticks out his hand to shake Tony’s, he smiles and reveals dimples in his cheeks that make Tony’s heart stutter in his chest.
That’s when he notices Steve’s hands gripping the steel bars, his knuckles turning white with the force of his grip. His head is bent forward and his shoulders are moving up and down quickly, harshly. Like he’s hyperventilating. Tony wonders if Super Soldiers can still pass out from that.
And if that happens to be nothing more than being a warm pillow for the moment, he’s more than happy to provide that service.
He’s surprisingly graceful and delicate as he steps around Tiberius and positions himself at Tony’s side. The weight of Steve’s warm hand on his lower back replaces the weight in Tony’s chest as he feels the tension drain out of his body.
"You know when I said I wanted to spent time together with just the two of us, this isn’t what I meant."
When the elevator opened, Steve spotted Tony immediately, hunched over something on a workbench, his back to the glass doors. Steve put his palm on the scanner and the doors slid open silently.
Steve laughs but then looks at Tony seriously. “Thank you, Tony. I really appreciate it,” he says honestly.
seeing Tony weekly, at the thought of no more pizz, beer, and movies with Tony’s wisecracks in the background. His lips purse at the thought of not feeling Tony’s warm thigh against his because Steve’s couch is small and sags in the middle and more often than not they wind up pressed against each other’s sides by the end of the night.
A flash of surprise crosses Tony’s face but then he’s reaching behind Steve, pressing the call button, and, would you look at that, it brings him right back into kissing proximity.
Tony, though… Tony, despite any reports to the contrary, had always been an emotional person. His mother used to tell him how much she loved his rosy cheeks when he was growing up and maybe for that reason, or simply because he didn’t have the patience or stability to train it away like Steve, it has just become another fact of life to him.
"I believe the most recent project was updated just last week," JARVIS says and Steve can picture the smirk on his nonexistent face.
Steve shakes his head and Clint laughs again, taking his mug of coffee and leaving the kitchen, his snickering echoing down the hallway.
They were quiet for another five minutes before he saw Tony pocket the cell phone and lean back, resting his back and elbows on the bench behind him. He cleared his throat gently and Steve’s heart stuttered just a fraction, waiting to see if Tony was going to speak. He wasn’t disappointed.
But mostly, Steve is in love with the dorky goofball who makes playlists full of cheesy, sappy love songs for when he makes love to his new boyfriend for the first time.
"Look," Tony said. "I really appreciate it but that’s going to be a no go. I’m just not interested."
“I was afraid if we started doing this, I’d never want to stop. That if I was allowed to touch you… I’d never want to take my hands off of you.”
And that’s when a reporter clears his throat awkwardly and Steve realizes how it must seem to them, the way they’re touching and looking at each other. He feels his eyes widen because he knows it looks like exactly what it is, that Captain America and Iron Man are in love. With each other. And while they haven’t really said they aren’t going to tell the public yet, they haven’t said that they are, and now Steve doesn’t know what to do.
There’s a loud bang that causes the trees near Steve to sway followed by a large crash. He’s out of the water and on his way back to his camp before he even consciously makes the decision.
After the testimony, Steve tried to find him in the halls. He spotted Tony right as he was about to head out the doors.
“What I want?” Steve asks. A grin breaks across his face. “What I want is for you to never take your hands off me.”
Steve owns and runs the strip club but he’s a legend in the business. He came from nothing and worked his way up in the world. The American dream, some would say.
Tony hummed for a second, looking off into the distance. He grinned suddenly. “Not sure about the tattoos yet, but maybe I’d get my tongue pierced.”
Thankfully, Tony had given clearance to the entire team for all of Stark Tower, including his workshop and personal quarters. Steve walked into the building and to the elevator on a mission.
time with Tony than he currently does. So, all in all, this is kind of a win on multiple fronts for Steve.
Tony gives him a cheeky smile and wave. “Hey, Steve!” He says proudly from where he’s currently lying prone on the ground.
Tony loves music. He makes playlists for everything. One day, Tony makes a playlist to fuck Steve to.
He reached out and grabbed Steve’s wrist, tugging him towards the railing and pulling him into a kiss that made Steve’s toes curl. It was a bit unusual, Tony moving up and down just barely as he hovered, and Steve wished he could feel Tony’s warm and firm body against his, but it was good. It was better than good; it was
"Alright, then. What are your thoughts on a second date?" Tony asks, eyes wide and guileless as he looks down at Steve.
Steve bites his tongue at the impulse to correct Clint, to tell him that it’s not an iPod, it’s a StarkBox, and then pauses to consider Clint’s words. It’s true. They (both) could just ask JARVIS to update the playlists. There’s no reason for Tony to swing by his apartment every week just for something that simple.
Then Steve notices the playlists. The playlists with odd names. Some are a mixture of letters and numbers that Steve quickly realizes are times and dates (sometimes he’s even able to correspond them to specific events), there are a handful of playlists named after people (“Clint” never fails to make Steve laugh), and then there are ones that look like gibberish. A string of letters that look like someone smashed their fist against the keyboard while occasionally hitting the ‘shift’ key. Steve’s a little proud at how quickly he manages to decode those.
He may have built a bit of a prickly wall around himself, but Steve thinks Tony’s a good man through and through. Steve also suspects Tony will likely never make the first steps towards a
Steve felt like he had been doused in cold water. Part of him wanted to make his case, part of him felt like leaving and finding someplace quiet to lick his wounds. He tried for the former.
They both led busy lives, though, so their friendship mostly began and ended at club’s doors, despite how badly Tony would like to see Steve off hours. But he enjoyed what they had, he was content with it.
He leans in the rest of the way and presses his lips to Tony’s. It’s soft and chaste and they break apart after just a moment.
Tony turns towards him and grins, his face scrunching in the adorable way that Steve loves before Tony pulls him into another hug.
Steve is clearly trying to keep his attention focused on his breakfast but his eyes keep darting towards the back of Tony’s head as he pours himself a mug of coffee. Tony turns around and leans back against the counter, catching Steve’s glance and smiling at him. Steve says good morning bright—too brightly, even for him.
But that was all blown out of the water the moment he met Steve himself. Tony was never one for flowery language but he swears that his heart stopped beating for a moment when Steve’s baby blues locked on him. It started back up again, double time, when Steve smiled at him.
Nevertheless, that was exactly what he did. Not that he’d admit that he had already been planning on introducing himself before Bucky had said anything. Steve walked up the wobbly bleachers and sat down a couple feet away from him. Nerves fluttered around his stomach once he got his first up-close look at Tony. He was probably the most attractive boy Steve had ever seen in person.
Tony wiggles around for a bit, tries to lift a piece of wood off of him, grunting and straining before he gives up and lets his head thump back onto the ground.
Steve feels his cheeks heat but he mumbles out the answer anyway. “You, uh, you asked me out on a date.”
Tony freezes on the spot, forcing Steve to stop with him. He looks Steve in the eye, all traces of mirth from earlier gone.
It’s more than a little frustrating because, honestly, very little has made sense to Steve for about two years now. Much less seeing a picture of Tony dancing after he explicitly stated he does no such thing.
“The red’s cool. But I don’t care for the blue,” he said, wrinkling his nose. “Maybe… a dark blond with it? Something that looks almost golden?”
“My mom taught me. She loved to dance. It was pretty much the only time I got her to myself. You wouldn’t find my dad near a dance floor of his own volition,” Tony admits.
