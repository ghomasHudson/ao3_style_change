It didn’t seem like the Steve Rogers and the Tony Stark of this world were romantically involved, unless it was hidden from the press, which doesn’t seem likely as it was reported that Tony had just gotten out of a long-term relationship with his CEO. Steve wasn’t so much relieved at this as he was just glad that there would be fewer obstacles between him and Tony, as he would have no qualms about eliminating the Steve Rogers of this world or anyone else to get to his Tony.
Zeke nods. There’s another moment of silence. This time Zeke breaks it, “Will you play with me? Daddy doesn’t play with me. He doesn’t like me. Says I shoulda been Alpha.”
The two captives wake up about a half-hour later. Yahya’s knot has deflated, but he was still inside Tony, causing the Omega to stutter in mortification, though the Alpha paid no mind.
That Tony can do easily. “Well, I have three close friends that I consider family for one. There’s Rhodey. He’s been my best friend since MIT. He saw a small 15-year-old Omega and decided to take him under his wing. I’m grateful for that all the time. Then there’s Pepper. She’s technically my PA, but she’s so much more than that. I’ve known her for about six years, but it feels like so much longer. It’s the same way with Happy, who’s my bodyguard and the best Alpha I know. I love them all so much.
“Zeke and JARVIS can handle the little ones for thirty minutes, Rhodey,” the Omega drawls, “I’m just grabbing ingredients for surprise blueberry pancakes.”
to run into you again.” With that, Tony enters his apartment, leaving Steve alone in the hallway, grinning.
as his father offers his arm. Maria flips the veil over his face as he grabs Howard’s arm. Howard walks him away from the wedding suite through the large doors into the church pews.
away from him. Steve saw nothing but red. He wouldn’t get away with this. In one quick motion, he let go of Barnes’s throat, grabbed the dagger, and slashed his former best friend’s throat. Killing Barnes the same way Barnes had killed Tony. The Winter Soldier never stood a chance.
. Obviously, Steve wouldn’t tell Tony everything he has planned for him, but he has to at least tell Tony the truth of who he is because Tony is smart and Tony would figure out that Steve is lying, so he would have to keep his lying to a minimum. But first, he has to see Tony.
Finally, they look at one another. Yahya must see something in Tony’s face because his face softens and he reaches to cup Tony’s cheek. Yahya then makes the first move and leans in to kiss him. It’s a nice kiss, slow and sweet. It’s nicer than any kiss that Tony has had with Obie. Yahya brushes against the bitten (though it was slightly fading) bonding glands*** causing a jolt of electricity to run through Tony. Yahya runs his hand down Tony’s spine, from the base of his neck to the top of Tony’s pants. The Alpha grips the edge of Tony’s waistband and guides the younger man out of the pants without breaking the kiss. Slowly, they rid each other of every last piece of clothing.
Obie hits Tony for the first time 3 months after getting married. Obie had come home and tripped on one of Zeke’s toys and was nearly ripping the young boy a new one. Tony hated how Zeke shrunk into himself as his father screeched at him. So Tony got between them and calmly told his husband to stop yelling at their son. Then Obie started yelling at Tony for talking back to him and telling him how to discipline his son. Tony tries to calmly diffuse Obie’s anger and doesn’t see the blow coming. He staggers to the ground from the force of it and stays there until Obie walks away.
Tony sighed and rubbed his temple. Nanny Clara was usually an amazing help around the house, but at moments like this Tony wondered if having her around was worth it.
to come back to you. I promise you that, okay? I know the last 3 months have been hard, and it’ll take more than just this to make you feel better, but I’m here and I’m here for you.”
“SHIELD already knew about your children and your current pregnancy. Don’t worry, we can keep a secret.” With that, the agent left.
Steve had “landed” behind a building on E 84th Street and 3rd Avenue, an alley Steve knew quite intimately. It was where Tony’s favorite bakery was located, where Steve would pick up Tony’s favorite sweets (lemon raspberry cookies and red velvet cupcakes) to butter his lover up after a particularly bad fight about Steve’s situation. It was an alley where they would have quick and dirty sex after the Commander had encounters with the Avengers, that was if Tony could slip away from his teammates.
“Then there’s Peter. He’s 7, or actually 8 now. His birthday is on February 24. That would’ve been a little less than 2 weeks after I was taken. He’s an Omega, but I’m going to make damn sure he doesn’t grow up the way I did. I don’t care what the world says about Omegas, I’m going to
They each serve themselves (except Jamie of course) and sit down to eat. Tony makes sure they eat a healthy serving of their vegetables, no matter how much Peter or Harley grumbled. Tony asks each of them about their day as he feeds Jamie bits of chicken. Zeke starts complaining about his summer program, how he has a group project where one of his partners is not picking up their own slack. Peter animatedly talks about how his LEGO building project is going. Harley proudly announces that he finally learned how to tie his own shoelaces and bends down to demonstrate for his mother. Every day since he’s come home, Tony has been utterly grateful for his boys, unable to imagine a life without them.
(As Zeke, Peter, and Harley all grow up, Harley doesn’t understand why their Dad doesn’t pay attention to or give as many toys to Zeke and Peter the way he does him. Harley always shares his toys with his older brothers and pesters his father to play with his siblings as well. Tony’s glad that Harley has yet to inherit Obie’s arrogant Alpha-ness and prays that he never does.)
Tony drops a long kiss atop of Jamie’s head and hugs Pepper goodbye before he guides Harley and Peter out the door, grabbing their backpacks on the way out.
Rhodey was yelling at Tony about something military that he was barely paying attention to. Tony loved the Beta man, but he honestly just wanted to relax and let loose. He just wanted to watch the beautiful Beta and Omega women dance, and he
Steve is in awe, of both the events that have just occurred and the man behind them. The other handful of people that gathered have also dispersed, leaving just Steve and 5J.
Once again, Tony’s heart clenches for Zeke. Tony’s heart needs to chill because he has a feeling things like this are going to come up for a long, long time. “Graduation,” Tony corrects, “Of course, kiddo. You know what, I’ll even try to get your daddy to come. Now, what book do you want to read for bed?”
“Peter’s got a fever and he’s been throwing up,” Tony says immediately upon having JARVIS pick up the call.
need to do this, Rhodey. But I swear I’m trying to stay as safe as possible for my family. I love you, Rhodey.”
“Take care of your brothers, Peter. Aunt Pepper, Uncle Happy, and Nanny Clara aren’t going to be home all the time. And Zeke is away at school. You’re the big brother now until Zeke comes home. Harley, don’t be too much trouble for your brother, or your uncle, aunt, and nanny at that.”
The man looks at him curiously, probably wondering why Steve is still there. “So,” Steve starts, “you’re the one who superglued our neighbor’s shoes to the floor.” Steve cringes internally; of course he did, everyone and their mother just saw the display in the very corridor they stood in.
The first thing that Steve must do to start earning Tony’s trust is to be completely honest with Tony. It was a risk, but a calculated one. It was unlikely that the Tony Stark of this world would like the fact that Steve was a HYDRA asset anymore than the Tony Stark of his world did. In fact, Tony wouldn’t trust him at first. He would probably lock Steve up, given the immense threat that a Steve Rogers controlled by HYDRA could be. But Steve could wait that out. He would play up the trauma of a tortured super-soldier, the very real guilt that Steve did have over not leaving HYDRA soon enough. He would be “remorseful” of his crimes, blame the years of brainwashing. He would play into the abandonment issues and immense desire to be loved that any Tony Stark would have and Steve wouldn’t even have to play that part up because his love for Tony was
“Flatten them out and look,” Tony says as he demonstrates. The flattened out papers on top of the light align all the different parts of the project on separate pieces of paper. You could see the envisioned final product.
When Tony thinks all hope is lost, a mechanized claw holds the glass box towards Tony. Tony grabs it. “Good boy,” he manages to croak out to Dum-E. He smashes the glass box onto the ground and grabs the arc reactor from the remnants. He immediately fits it into the gaping hole in his chest and is immediately able to breathe easier. Despite that, Tony still loses his battle to unconsciousness.
feeling better now. I wanna go to school today. Anna Marie is going to bring her pet lizard for show and tell today.”
“That's a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks.” Tony stands outside of the bedroom door; he doesn’t want to do this in front of his kids.
be his father, had a similar look on his face. Tony’s breath hitches as he catches a glimpse of 4-year-old Zeke Stane at the front of the church, watching Tony curiously. He’s going to be that kid’s stepmother, Tony thinks as his heart rate increases. It was starting to finally feel real to him. He was going to get married.
Obie opens fire at him, causing the Omega to almost fall through the broken skylight. Obie continues to fire bullets, breaking all the glass in the skylight.
With Tony no longer on top of him, Steve pushed himself off the bed and headed towards the bathroom. “You know I have to Tony.” Though his back was to his lover, Steve could feel Tony’s face twist into an ugly grimace. He hated this. He hated that the fight this would likely lead to. He hated that he couldn’t listen to Tony. That he couldn’t just stay like both he and his lover wanted. He hated that he had to leave and do horrible things that Tony would just resent him for. Steve especially hated himself, for doing this to Tony and still always coming back.
Tony puts himself under so much stress, he goes into early labor. His son is born on February 24, 2000.
“Well it’s your fucking job,” Obie growls, twisting Tony’s arm just a bit more, “You are the face of Stark Industries. I don’t care what the fuck happened in Afghanistan, you don’t fucking pull that shit.”
The Alpha scoffs, “As if my men would touch filth like you.” Tony refrains himself from rolling his eyes; the Alpha may say that, but the looks that some of the Alpha and Betas behind their leader send Tony’s way tell a whole other story.
God, he missed him. “JARVIS,” Steve called out as he entered the Avengers Headquarters, “Where is the Tesseract kept?”
“Drive,” Obie commands before he presses the button that puts up the sound-proofing barrier (Tony’s own addition). As soon as it’s up, Obie grips Tony’s arm and twists it behind Tony’s back. It takes everything in Tony’s fragile state not to cry out. “What the fuck was that?” Obie asks harshly.
Some of the time, they sit in silence, both thinking about their respective lives from before, from outside of the cave. At least, that’s what Tony does, and what he thinks that Yinsen is doing too.
Yes, the man was over 25 years his senior, but it was nearly the age difference between his father and his mother, who had married at the same age as Tony. Obadiah also likes to act progressive for the press. He has already stated that he would allow Tony to further his education,
Everhart smirks. Tony doesn’t understand why. In what world does she have any sort of upper hand here? “You must be the famous Pepper Potts.”
The AI starts to protest. “Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations needed before an actual flight is—”
Once the story is done, Tony puts the book away and starts tucking Zeke into bed. “Tony,” Zeke says sleepily.
Tony can hear the ground rumbling on Pepper’s end. Then, he hears a mechanized voice, “Where do you think you’re going?” Tony sees Pepper and Obie in the monster suit. “Your services are no longer required.”
“Is it a good representation of his spring period?” Tony says cheekily, purposefully riling Pepper up with false art history information.
Tony nods, knowing that if he spoke out of turn things would get ugly. Obie lets him go. “Good. Now, I’m going back to sleep. I didn’t exactly get much last night,” Obie smirked. Tony has to stop himself from rolling his eyes. The man was bragging about his adulterous activities as if he was with his golfing buddies instead of the spouse he was cheating on.
As if the Alpha had read his mind, Yahya says, “You didn’t speak about your husband, Obadiah Stane.” It was both a question and a statement.
“Don’t let them find out I’m in Heat! You need to help me through this, please!” Tony all but cries out.
Tony hastily grabs his go-bag and makes his way back to the living room where he found Pepper and all of his children (sans Zeke).
“Okay. Okay. Tony? It’s going to be okay. Peter? Harley? It’s going to be okay. Auntie Pepper is going to make this okay.” Pepper reaches into Tony’s chest cavity once again, this time with the new arc reactor.
reputation. A cover for his indiscretions. I have no wish to join you, but if you want your fifteen seconds of fame, write an article about sleeping with the power couple of the business world. In fact, if you’re going to say something, make sure it’s about me and Obie, not just Obie; that’s in the NDA too.”
Yes, Obie is definitely more at fault than these women who don’t know or owe Tony anything, but sleeping with someone who is very obviously and publicly in a committed relationship is still a terrible thing to do regardless. (There have been some women who walked out once they realized that it wasn’t a package deal sort of thing and Tony wasn’t actually okay with it, but Tony could count that number on one of his hands in the decade that he’s been married to Obie.)
“Okay, you’re going to attach that to the base plate. Make sure you…” Tony trailed off as the arc reactor clicked into place and a jolt ran through his body.
“Uncle Rhodey let it slip,” the teenager shrugs. Tony looks up to glare at his best friend, who had the decency to at least look a little sheepish.  “Don’t be mad at him, we pestered him.” Harley and Peter nod as solemnly as the school-aged children could. Though they are young, they understand death from the years of their mother mourning their grandparents. (Maria and Jarvis, Tony never mourned his bastard sperm donor).
Tony hesitates before answering, it’s not like they can do anything about his Heat now “I was in Heat. Yinsen helped me through it. I didn’t want anyone else to know and do anything.” The implication was clear.
“I know a blind spot in the cameras,” Tony refutes, “I tracked the lines of sight of all the cameras, and found the one secluded nook of this cave that isn’t surveilled.”
that boy the world. I remember being so scared when I was pregnant with him. I was really young. And then my mom died right before he was born. I like to think he ended up okay though.”
Yinsen nods, “We all do things for the betterment of our children, so they can survive, thrive in this world.”
Knowing how recognizable he was due to his counterpart being a famous public figure, Steve couldn’t exactly walk around the streets of Manhattan, and especially not the subway, undetected. It was a miracle that he hadn’t gotten recognized already, and he had no idea how that was the case. The last thing he needed was the Internet blowing up with “Steve Rogers spotted in the Upper East Side,” alerting either Tony or Captain America and the Avengers to his presence before Steve made his way to the Tower.
Later that evening, Tony and the Alpha captive sit in silence in front of the fire as they usually do most nights following Tony’s torture. It is their only source of heat in the dreary cave they are held in.
Sure, it looked and felt like Manhattan. The streets were noisy and bustling. One could see the city brimming with enormous buildings. People were hurrying down the street quickly, everyone having someone to see or somewhere to go. Cars were honking, in response to the vast traffic that perpetuated New York. It was definitely Manhattan. But at the same time, it
Zeke looks down at his plate, shuffling pieces of pasta around the plate. “Nanny Clara says that you’re not going to be around as much. That the baby is actually
Tony. There were enough similarities between the two Tony Starks that he could come to this conclusion. In fact, any version of Tony Stark is a Tony Stark that Steve Rogers could love, would love. In any world, any universe, Tony Stark belonged to Steve Rogers. The Tesseract had given him a second chance to live his life out with the love of his life. And he was going to take it and never let it go. He wasn’t going to waste his chance. Now he just needed a plan to make Tony his.
Tony knows he probably should just investigate the black market weaponry and then pass the information along to the proper authorities, but he couldn’t do that. Not only is this a problem that Tony has to fix himself as the cause of it, there is no intelligence agency he trusted with this. That’s why he started the project Mark Two.
A doctor’s appointment confirms it, but it is glaringly obvious already. Tony is pregnant. Maria is excited to help her Omega child through his first pregnancy. Howard is pleased with the prospect of an heir. Obie is proud as an Alpha sire usually is. Tony is terrified, but at the same time also excited? Zeke has brought out all these motherly feelings in Tony that he never knew he had.
The grip on Steve’s waist instantly loosened and the weight on his chest listed. Steve’s heart sank even if he knew that this was what he asked for because he knew what would come. Tony had pushed himself onto his elbows; his eyes were wide open now, and he looked up at Steve earnestly. “No, you don’t Steve. You don’t have to go back to them.”
Luckily, no one on the subway seemed to recognize him, and if they did, they at least decided not to make a fuss about Captain America being on the same train as them. He didn’t even notice anyone trying to secretly record or take photos of him, on the subway or while he was walking on the streets (and he
“No, see, this isn’t a game,” Rhodey starts to lecture Tony, “You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone. You understand that?”
Everhart looks surprised to see him, before her face shifts to look a bit ashamed and embarrassed. As she should be. “So,” she blurts out, “you have a son.”
Conference Room 38 was encased in glass, as all the rooms in the Tower were, but unlike many of the rooms in the Tower, the glass was seemingly fogged up. It must be an important meeting. Steve barged in anyway.
Tony doesn’t let Yahya get a word in as he continues, “We have to get up early to continue working tomorrow. Or else they’ll come crashing in to bother us. Good night.”
Obie stays in New York most of the time, dealing with SI business. He comes home on the weekends, usually only staying 2-3 days. Tony and Obie spend their first bonded Heat together, refreshing Tony’s bonding bite, and they spend Obie’s Rut together, refreshing Obie’s bite. And they continue to do so for every Heat and Rut to come.
Zeke’s eyes go wide. “You’re gonna read me a bedtime story?” Tony smiles and nods, hoping to seem encouraging. “A Bad Case of Stripes, please.” So Tony grabs the book from the bookshelf in Zeke’s room and begins to read. It takes all of 10 minutes and Zeke’s eyes start to droop as the time goes by.
When Tony comes to, Pepper is standing above him, tears running down the Beta’s cheeks. “Oh my god,” she cries out, “Tony, you’re alive!”
Rhodey releases Tony’s hand, and walks off toward a group of military personnel, probably to debrief. He was a true bureaucrat at heart.
Tony looks to his closest friends and his children. Jarvis would be proud of him for the family he created.
Tony’s Heat lasts for 3 days, shorter than Tony’s usual 5-to-6-day Heats, and if even after it Yahya and Tony continue to share a cot, well, neither of them say anything about it.
He stops for a moment before he continues, “I was raised in China. I was born here in Afghanistan, but my father always wanted to get out. He was a scientist, and research and development aren’t as expansive here as in other places in the world, especially back then. My father got a job in Beijing when I was 4. It was hard for him, as the only brown person at his work, in daily life. It was hard for my mother too. So they assimilated, as much as they could.”
“Me?” Steve asks in surprise. “I’m getting a Masters in Art Education at MassArt. I’m Steve by the way. I’ve seen you around, but I’m pretty sure this is the first time we’ve ever spoken.”
corner of E 84th Street and 3rd Avenue, however, a Starbucks stood where his beloved bakery was supposed to be. (God, a
The bartender walks off to get his order ready when Tony hears a voice calling his attention next to him. “Dr. Stane”
Tony flies off, hoping to make it in time. “JARVIS, How do you think the Mark I chest piece is going to hold up?”
His mother’s funeral is a small affair. It’s just Tony, Jarvis, Zeke, and Obie. Tony, Jarvis, and Zeke quietly mourned, but Obie looked like he’d rather be anywhere else.
“Okay.” Pepper starts to reach into Tony’s chest cavity before immediately pulling back. “You know, I don’t think I’m qualified to do this.”
“Not in the boot, Dum-E. Right here, you got me?” Tony points where the bot should be focusing his attention. “Stay put. Nice.”
“He was still your father,” the Omega continues weakly. Tony can see both Rhodey and Happy rolling their eyes simultaneously at his defense of the admittedly awful man.
Mr. Bassett opens his mouth, seemingly to snap back, but the man interrupts him before he can even begin.
“Thank you, Samantha. Would you be a darling and please heat up the sake to go with that?” Samantha leaves, presumably to get the Japanese food and drink requested.
“Pep, it’s not what you think,” Tony starts, “I’m actually four weeks pregnant.” Pepper’s face shifts into a look of horror before Tony jumps to explain himself. “It’s not what you think now either. I told Rhodey this when we found out at the hospital in Turkey. I went into Heat in Afghanistan. There was another captive, an Alpha, who helped me through it. His name was Yahya, and he died when we were trying to escape. I slept with Obie as soon as I got here so that for nine months he’ll at least have no clue, but I don’t know what I’ll do when this baby is born.”
A month or so into the program, Tony was starting to feel fatigued and achy. He attributes it to being not only a grad student but a househusband and mother as well. But then, October came, and with it did not come Tony’s Heat.
***Reminder: Everyone has bonding glands by which biting it (usually during sex) creates a bond. These bonding bites fade over time. In order to create long-lasting bonds, bonding bites need to be refreshed. This is traditionally during Heat for Omegas and Rut for Alphas, but can be done whenever, as done by Betas. Bonding glands are located on the junction between the neck and shoulder for Alphas, on the junction between the underside of the chin and neck for Betas, and on the back of the neck near the upper back for Omegas.
Steve walks over to the scene of the commotion. There isn’t exactly a crowd as maybe two or three other residents having come out to see what’s going on; everyone else is either out or has decided to ignore Mr. Bassett (which is probably a smart move). “Mr. Bassett, is there a reason you are trying to get the attention of the whole floor?” Steve asks with as straight a face as he can manage.
“That’s amazing.” Obie pauses. “Listen to me, Tony. We’re a team. Do you understand?” Tony doesn’t see the slap coming but he feels the sting and force of it the second Obie’s touch leaves his skin. “But don’t you ever talk back to me like that again, Omega.”
“Can I…can I call you Momma?” Zeke asks, “I don’t ‘member my momma. I like you, and Nanny Clara says you’re my momma now cuz you married Daddy.”
“What am I supposed to think Tony?” Rhodey almost yells, “You’re only one week pregnant! What else am I supposed to think?”
Tony rolls his eyes. “It’s not pus. It’s an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device, not from my body.”
you get this number? In fact, how did you get past the security defense of the call? I gotta say I’m impressed.”
One day, they don’t shove his face into the tank of water. Instead, the shove a sack over his head and drag him out of the cave. Or at least that’s what Tony thinks they’re doing since he can sense the change in light through the bag. That, however, isn’t any help in adjusting to the brightness of the sun that feels as though it nearly blinds him as they rip the bag off his head. Tony notices that they brought the other captive out with him.
Tony tries not to let his smile go bitter. “That is an excellent question. Yes and no. We had a scheduling conflict with March, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else?” Tony desperately wanted to move on from this topic.
Yahya is the best Alpha Tony has ever known in his life, save for Happy, and he sacrificed his life so that Tony could continue living. Tony wouldn’t give up. He
Tony chuckles and shakes his head. “Nah, the proof is there.” He points to his kids where it seems that Zeke is reenacting some sort of story for the younger ones.
Obie looks like he is about to say something before he sighs. “You’re right, I’m sorry. Listen, I think I got the board right where I want them, so take it slow, alright?”
Tony’s heart flutters. Stupid Omega instincts. “Of course, Zeke,” Tony says with a lump in his throat, “Now go to sleep. You had a long day.” Zeke’s eyes close. Impulsively, Tony presses a kiss to Zeke’s forehead.
Pepper is obviously unconvinced. “Sure. I have something for you, by the way.” The redhead hands him a wrapped box it seems. When he rips open the wrapping, he pulls out a glass box that holds the old arc reactor. The metal casing is engraved, “PROOF THAT TONY STARK HAS A HEART.”
“Happy, drive. Cheeseburger first. Let’s get takeout from the diner in Brooklyn that all the boys love. I’ve got to make up somehow for missing almost all of their birthdays.”
Tony makes his way to the bar and makes his order. As he waits, he spots Christine Everhart and immediately spins around, hoping the woman had not spotted him.
Once he finished with his shower and the rest of his morning routine, Steve exited the bathroom, hoping some of his lover’s anger had subsided in the last twenty minutes, but knowing that Tony was probably sitting cross-legged on the bed, eyes burning with fury, raring to go. That’s not what Steve saw. What Steve saw instead made his heart drop into the pits of his stomach; he was not nearly ready for the sight that assaulted his eyes. Tony, with his eyes wide open and his mouth ajar, laid unmoving on the bloodstained sheets with Bucky Barnes standing over him with a bloody dagger.
in place in front of apartment 5J with a cardboard box glued to his hands, hollering and complaining for the whole floor to see his plight.
“No, baby. You’ve got to be a little older to handle this stuff. I didn’t let Zeke help me until he was twelve, and even then not with a lot of stuff.” Tony’s heart started racing when the boy had suggested it. The other day Tony had tested a flight stabilizer and there was far too much power in it. This stuff was dangerous.
All sexes are intersex in some way, except for Alpha Males and Omega Females. Alpha Males only have a penis, while Omega Females only have a vagina/vulva. Alpha Females and Beta Females both have a vulva whose clit enlarges to act like an erect penis and a vagina. Beta Males and Omega Males both have a penis and a vaginal-like opening in the area of their perineum.
“And I had to be the strong one for Peter, Harley, and Jamie. I know that we had Aunt Pepper and Uncle Happy, but they still had their own lives, especially Aunt Pepper who had to deal with SI stuff. I didn’t really have anyone to talk about it with. I didn’t have you, and a part of me thought I lost you forever.”
“Lock me out?” Tony asks confused, “You’re my Alpha. You have control over everything right now. I just build.”
Tony finally reaches home without another hitch. He hovers over the driveway as he says, “Kill power.” The landing was not nearly as smooth as he had hoped it would be. He crashed through two floors, obliterating his piano and one of his favorite sports cars. Tony didn’t know what he thought would happen with nearly two tons of gold-titanium alloy, but that wasn’t what he was thinking of in the moments after the crash. He could only think about his baby, immediately wrapping an arm around his metal-clad abdomen.

Omegas are not referred to as "Mr." or "Mrs." But "Of" to indicate an unmarried status and "From" to indicate a married status. This is a little tidbit I picked up from
that is set right after Tony's disappearance in a mix of Pepper and Zeke's POVs. You can find said one-shot in the
This time he’s propped up onto a chair. There are so many people around him. They’re recording him…he thinks. It’s hard to tell.
Tony recognizes that Obie means to be placating or reassuring, but instead, the older man just looks like a wolf in sheep’s clothing.
“Okay,” Tony says quietly as he nods, picking his head back up. Tony looks at Obie for a minute before resting his head on the Alpha’s shoulder. The other man automatically wraps an arm around the smaller and younger man. “I missed you Alpha,” Tony utters softly, ever so calculating. There have been only a handful of times where Tony has sought Obie out, mostly when he was younger and feeling lonely or craving intimacy. But this was nothing like those times, though he was trying to make Obie seem so. This was a calculated move.
Also I have a slightly specific, non-traditional A/B/O Verse, and this is what I've come up with so far:
Steve raises his hands in mock-surrender. “Hey, I’m not complaining. No one on this floor, or even in this building, would blame you for the measures you took. It’s better than what I would’ve done.”
Obie guides Tony into the building and onto the podium of SI Malibu’s press room, a solid grip on his waist. “Look who’s here,” Obie says in a false-excited tone.
Hesitantly and carefully, all three of his away children sat on Tony’s bed, only coming closer with the Omega’s insistence.
“Okay, here's serious. My old man had a philosophy, ‘Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.’” Tony drolls on as he walks back up to Peter’s bedroom.
“I really regret having to do this. If it weren’t for that new law that’s about to be passed in California that would give you control of all your assets, including the company, then I wouldn’t. It’s already in place in New York too. I wish you could’ve given me another Alpha or two before I had to do this. There’s nothing that can be done for that now.”
Tony twists towards the woman and adjusts the baby in his arms. “Here,” Tony says as he thrusts the papers and pen into her hands, “Sign this. It basically says that you can’t say anything about the house, where it is located, and what really happens in it. Have fun.”
Tony had not anticipated that taking off the armor would be such a difficult task. The assembly bots are all pushing and pulling at all different pieces of metal as JARVIS instructed them.
Rhodey lets the younger Omega lead him back to the kids’ area where Zeke was entertaining his baby brothers with action figures. Tony watches as Rhodey grabs a superhero action figure and starts play-fighting with Harley while making explosion noises, and he thanks whatever entity out there for being able to come back to his family.
He shakes his head, reminiscing the way Howard beat into him the importance of his purity. “Don’t worry. It’ll be ok,” Obie smiles.
comes home for leave for more than just a week or two. He’s home for at least a year, and Tony couldn’t be more grateful.
Howard Stark can be seen beaming all day, as he helps coordinate the day with Maria, making sure everything goes according to plan.
“There is still a heartbeat sir, and no signs of miscarriage. I believe that this ordeal has not had an effect on the fetus,” the AI informs.
Otherwise, Obie is usually in his study, doing SI related work. He rarely comes out unless it’s for food or sex. (Tony’s just fine with that.)
Alpha/Beta/Omega is actually primary sex, while Male/Female is secondary sex as A/B/O determines reproduction and stuff while M/F is more secondary sex characteristics.
, Steve despairs in his head) reaches over with the eyedropper unscrewed from the bottle and drops a bit of the liquid where Mr. Bassett’s hands and the package met. A few seconds later, the box drops from the old man’s grip, landing onto the floor with a muffled
Mr. Bassett. Steve has only lived in this building for a year, and yet he’s still managed to grow to hate the man in that short amount of time. However to Steve that does not count; Steve is pretty sure that everyone in his building hated Mr. Bassett. Hell, everyone who has ever met the crotchety old man probably has some level of dislike for him.
where I retweet a bunch of fandom stuff mostly (variety of fandoms, not just Marvel), but occasionally I'll have an original thought.
“Recent violence has been attributed to a group of foreign fighters referred to by locals as the Ten Rings. As you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission. A mission that could prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way. With no political will or international pressure, there's very little hope for these refugees. Around me, a woman begging for news on her husband, who was kidnapped by insurgents, either forced to join their militia…”
“You can tell him I was sick, Momma,” Harley suggests all too casually, sitting opposite of Tony, his fingers unconsciously running up and down the length of his older brother’s calf. Tony’s heart constricts. He wishes he didn’t live in a world where his Alpha son offered to lie to his father about being sick because he understood that his father put him above his Omega and Beta siblings.
Obie installed poles and hired beautiful women for his amusement, but whenever Tony uses the plane on his own, he takes advantage of it, if only out of spite. He lets the girls let their hair down (literally, that updo hurts like a bitch and cannot be good for their scalps) and just hang out. Obie may objectify these women and make them dance for him, but Tony has made friends with them and likes to dance
“It was. It is now an antique.” Tony lifts up the new arc reactor. “This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future. I’m swapping it up for an upgrade unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump.”
“Hi From Stane. This is Christine Everhart with Vanity Fair magazine. I was wondering if I could ask you some questions. I was hoping to catch you at the award ceremony today. Imagine my surprise when they tell me that not only are you not there, you’re not even in
“Baby, can you tell me what’s wrong? I’ve noticed something off with you all through lunch,” Tony says softly, hoping not to wake the others.
Steve was glad that this Stark Tower also had a side entrance for authorized personnel. Luckily, as he was “Captain America,” the light lit up green after both pressing his hand to the scanning touchscreen on the side of the building and lowering himself to be level with the eye-scanning laser.
“No you’re fine,” the inventor soothes, “You’re the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I’ve ever met. I trust you with my kids’ lives, of course, I trust you with mine. You’re gonna do great.”
The military plane finally lands and Tony can see Happy and Pepper as the walkway lowers. Rhodey takes Tony’s hand and guides the Omega down, ignoring his grumblings. An EMT with a gurney approaches as Tony and Rhodey reach the ground. “Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of it,” Tony scoffs. He didn’t let Dr. Demir examine him because of the arc reactor, why would he let anyone else?
that name. He wouldn’t even be in the weapons business if he had any choice and instead he’s the face of it. “That's not bad.” Tony clears his throat and switches the phone from his right ear to his left. “Let me guess. Berkeley?”
Tony lifts himself up on the bed, despite his friend’s protests. “I missed you so goddamn much Rhodey,” Tony nearly sobs as he reaches his arm around Rhodey. The Beta immediately wraps his arms around the Omega as well.
He knew what she was saying. He could always come to talk to her and she would listen. But there was nothing he or she could do. Omegas can’t get a divorce themselves other than in cases of abuse. And usually, judges turn a blind eye unless it is severe enough that they can’t ignore it. Even if Tony was granted a divorce, he wouldn’t be able to get custody of Zeke as an Omega, let alone as someone who isn’t even his bearer. Not for the first time, Tony feels a lot older than his 18 years.
The way the Alpha said “protect” made Tony’s skin crawl. With the scene he’s caused here, Tony can only pray that his husband doesn’t go back to the mansion.
Rhodey isn’t able to respond before Tony is spotted. The jet he is on tries to shake him off, and in trying to get back into flight, Tony smacks into and breaks off a huge chunk of the jet. The pilot is ejected, but there is no chute. Tony can’t let that person fall to his death, not when it’s his fault. So he follows them in their descent and hopes that he can catch up before they hit the ground. The Omega can hear Rhodey unsuccessfully try to call off the target on his back. Tony is able to reach the pilot in the nick of time and manually forces the parachute out. He can hear cheering on Rhodey’s end of the line.
Tony immediately felt better with his children closer to him, but there was still a pit in his stomach as his kids looked at him expectantly and with a little bit of worry. How was he going to break this news to them? “There’s something I have to tell you all,” he began.
When Steve Rogers woke up one sunny morning, the first thing he saw was Tony Stark’s sleeping face. Steve was on his back with Tony draped over his torso, his head resting on Steve’s shoulder. Steve took a moment to take in the beauty of his lover, the warmth of affection spreading within him. Tony looked absolutely serene in his sleep. His curls were tousled messily, in a way Tony usually does purposefully, but this was instead due to the brunette’s tossing and turning in sleep and their activities from the night before. His long eyelashes rested on his cheekbones, his pink lips pursed in sleep. Steve was in awe. How was such a beautiful, amazing man with someone like him?
“Tony?” The boy finally says, “Will you come to my pre-K grajushun? Daddy doesn’t really come to things like that.”
Pepper starts blurting out rapid-fire questions. “You’re pregnant? When did you have sex with Obie? You came home three weeks ago, and I know he didn’t come home with you. Oh my god, did you have sex with him on the car ride here?”
“Harley’s next. He’s 5, or he might be 6 now. His birthday is on March 14. I got pregnant with him the first Heat I had after Peter.* He’s an Alpha. I got to make sure that he doesn’t get a big head about being an Alpha like most do, no offense. He’s my adorably mischievous one. Peter is usually sweet until he gets pulled into anything with his little brother. The older he gets the more trouble he makes. I love him though. My little rascal.”
He looks around the camp. There are dozens of men, all heavily armed. They start to drag Tony in one direction. He sees a variety of weapons scattered in front of the entrance of the cave. They all have his name on them. Tony’s heart sinks.
(Tony had to fight with the skin of his teeth to go to MIT. Releasing his acceptance letter to the press was a risky move that cost him broken ribs and a bruised jaw, but it was
Obie drawls, “Why don’t you take care of that now while I head upstairs?” Obie (surprisingly) places a small kiss atop Jamie’s head and starts to walk off when he turns back and adds, “And Omega, we’re going to talk about the stunt you pulled today.”
This was not his world, Steve was sure of it. But he was here now, so he was going to make the most of it. He trusted the power of the Tesseract, the power HYDRA fought for decades to acquire. This would lead him to Tony. He was sure of that too. So Steve did what he always did on a mission in an unknown location: gather intel. As his objective is to acquire Tony Stark, he went to go find as much about this world’s Tony Stark as possible.
“That’s right, bub,” Tony nods. When it didn’t seem like Zeke would elaborate any further Tony continues, “That doesn’t explain what’s wrong Zeke.”
No one says anything at first, simply cuddling in silence. Slowly, Jamie, Harley, and Peter all fall asleep. Jamie was due for a nap anyway, and the other young boys were tired from a hectic day. Only Zeke and Tony are left awake.
Once the train reached his desired station, Steve bolted out of the subway car, through the crowds of people, out of the station, and once again into the streets of Manhattan. He slowed down, so as not to seem suspicious, even though someone bolting through the street of New York may not even cause New Yorkers to bat an eye, despite the lack of running clothes. Even still, his pace made a 10-minute walk a 5-minute walk. Finally, Steve reached his destination, 200 Park Avenue, Stark Tower (because even with the singular “A,” it’s still
So Tony stays the night, thankful that his father is somewhere on the other side of the world. He spends the morning with Jarvis who made his favorite blueberry pancakes, just like he did when Tony was a child. Zeke thanks his “Grandpa Jarvis” for the yummy food and Tony almost stays. He leaves for home with Zeke later that afternoon. Obie apologizes when they get home, citing stress and frustration. And that was that.
“Well, I’m not my company.” Tony stomps out to go find his Alpha, not looking back to see if Christine was following him.
Pepper takes Jamie from Tony once again. “You have to go Tony. The boys are done with their breakfast. And you’re going to be
“No. The Springs was actually the neighborhood in East Hampton where he lived and worked,” Pepper says as she pinches her nose, “not spring like the season.”
One of the Alphas, the leader, starts to speak. Tony thinks it’s Arabic; he can’t tell. He indicates for Tony’s fellow captive to translate.
Tony grabs him by his shoulders. “I know, you have a wife and a family. But if they find out and get to me first and I get pregnant, which believe me is very likely, then I will be tied to one of them for the rest of my life. You know that Alphas have full claim over any children they have, but I could never in good conscience just give my kid away to one of these people. I’d rather it be you than them. I know this is a lot to ask of you, but please!”
Yinsen looks contemplative. “I only know of Zeke Stane. Your husband’s child from a previous marriage. But even then, that’s only in passing.”
“Love you too, man. Take care, I mean it” With that, the call ends again. Tony had wanted to tell Thodey about Obie dealing under the table, but he needed a plan first. Hopefully, he had time for that later, right now he needed to get home to his kids.
“Of course, I know that. I’ll keep you updated. Pepper and I have started to look into it.” Tony pats the older man’s shoulder. “Since you’re here, you might as well spend some time with your godsons.”
Howard’s will is read by his lawyer to Jarvis, Obie, and Tony. Jarvis is given a small vacation home in England to retire in for his amazing service, as he rightly deserves. Obie gets nothing. It turns out Howard had yet to update his will since Tony got married. He is still the successor of Stark Industries. It didn’t matter so much in the short-term; Obie basically owns Tony, so anything that is Tony’s, Obie automatically has control over. In the long term, however, Obie would not be able to name a successor after his death if Tony is still alive; all properties would automatically be reinstated to Tony’s name. This was likely given the age difference and Tony’s genes given Howard. Obie is not happy. Tony doesn’t care.
As if on cue, Pepper strides in confidently in a pantsuit with a dry-cleaning bag. Pepper doesn’t even wait for Everhart to fully realize her presence, “I've got your clothes here. They've been dry-cleaned and pressed, and there's a car waiting for you outside that will take you anywhere you'd like to go.”
The repulsors in the boots come to life. Tony has a wobbly start, but he soon gets the hang of it as he maneuvers his way out of the workshop and the garage. It’s absolutely exhilarating. Tony can’t help but let out a few whoops as if he was on a rollercoaster. A little boy on a Ferris wheel might’ve seen Tony, but that’s not the point. This was amazing; there was really nothing like it. And then of course Tony starts to get a little cocky.
“Okay, good, ‘cause I’m staring at something right now and it’s about to be blown to kingdom come.” With that, the phone call ends.
Tony’s heart instantly clenches for the small Beta boy. Though Zeke may not have to go through the same trials and tribulations as an Omega, Tony knows what it’s like to be hated by a father that wanted an Alpha son. “Of course I’ll play with you. But not right now. I have to finish unpacking the house, okay?”
person, so on principle, he tries not to really hate anyone. He hates conceptual figures like white supremacists and extreme right-wing politicians, but not people in his life that are real to him.
“Lies,” Tony gasps in mock-indignation, “I tie Harley’s and Peter’s shoes all the time. I think I’d make it a week.”
Obie looks at him in shock as well. “What? It’s only been three weeks. I didn’t know we could know that quickly.”
Tony can only nod, the adrenaline wearing off. The last thing he thinks before he falls unconscious in Rhodey’s arms due to dehydration and exhaustion,
Tony and Obie clean up and become presentable by the time they reach their Malibu mansion. Tony straightens out his clothes and moves to get out of the car. He notices that
It seemed that Tony finally came to his senses because he pushed Steve away. In his periphery, Steve could see that his counterpart was still frozen with shock.
“Well, I’m a busy, busy man Ms.—is it Ms. or Mrs. or Of or From?—things do come up for people like me. By the way, how
Steve then punched the glass barrier that surrounded the Tesseract. The bulletproof glass was no match for super-soldier strength and shattered onto the floor. Steve ignored the bleedings cuts on his hand as the alarms sounded and bright red lights flashed. He knew that he only had a few moments before the Avengers were informed and they started making their way back.
Technically, Tony lied to Zeke. He regrets being complacent the last decade of his life, leaving Obie to be able to sell his weapons on the black market. He may not have much say as an Omega, but Tony can’t help but believe that there’s something he could’ve done. Then maybe Gulmira could’ve been spared.
Slowly, bit by bit, the paralysis is wearing off. So with much exertion, Tony throws himself off the couch and drags himself over to the elevator to take him down to the workshop. The paralysis is completely gone once he reaches the workshop. He eyes the arc reactor that Pepper had encased in glass and tries to make his way over. He immediately falls over, too weak to even walk, but Tony does not give up. He army crawls his way over to the table and tries to grab the glass box but he can’t get a hold of it. Black dots dance in his vision as he is unable to hold up his weight and slumps over, the arc reactor out of reach.
“Well, I’m glad,” the Air Force officer says softly, “that you had someone there. And that you had someone treat you right at least once in your life.”
“You’ve really earned you title, haven’t you Merchant of Death? I just thought you had some morals, some limits.” Christine hands Tony a pile of photographs. “It’s a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?”
“Take me home please,” Tony tells the driver who is not Happy as the Alpha had gone off to get Zeke from Pasadena as soon he left Tony at SI. Not more than a millisecond after Tony closed the door of the car, Obie rips it open and climbs in. He looks livid.
Tony goes back to Peter’s room with Jamie in tow for the one thing he’s been trying to do for the past hour. When he starts to wet the washcloth when he realizes that the water had grown cold. Tony sighs and gets up to make his way back down to the kitchen, grabbing Jamie as he was starting to make a fuss about his mother leaving him.
“JARVIS! Come on we got to break the ice!” Tony reaches down and is able to deploy the flaps and break the ice manually. The power comes back on in the suit, and Tony is able to gain control again. He flies home, probably coming a lot closer to the highways and oncoming traffic than he should’ve.
Later that day, Rhodey comes down to the workshop to see his best friend playing action figures with his four sons. “Hey kiddos,” Rhodey says as he bends down towards the group, “I need to talk to your mom for a quick minute.”
“He says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile. He wants you to make a list of materials. He says for you to start working immediately, and when you’re done, he will set you free.”
Yahya takes his time prepping Tony, even though Omegas in Heat hardly need any, while whispering sweet nothings and reassurances, leaving Tony writhing in pleasure and whimpering and pleading for Yahya to just
Obie is able to get a hold of Tony and throw him off and onto the skylight. He opens up the suit to reveal himself. “I never had a taste for this sort of thing, but I must admit, I’m deeply enjoying this suit. You finally outdid yourself, Tony!”
He moves toward the table behind Tony, picking up the slips of paper that make up the schematics of the suit. Tony’s heart rate picks up, even though he knew that there was no way for the man to know what all the plans make together unless he aligns them correctly over a light source. “But today, whoever holds the latest Stark weapons rules these lands. And soon, it will be my turn.”
It took a few minutes before the two young Stark kids calmed down, but when they did, Tony decided to abandon all his current work and join them in the play area. He would put everything on hold for his children.
by Fall Out Boys. It was going to be something else (that I will be saving for a later chapter), but I was listening to the song as I was writing, and it just felt right.
. You should’ve come to the house. You could’ve come and seen your godkids, but you didn’t. Now, we’re waiting on you. Let’s go. Come on.” Tony waltzes into the aircraft without letting Rhodey get another word in. Rhodey just shakes his head in exasperation and follows.
The day they come back from their trip, Obie drops Tony off at their house just off the campus of MIT, where they would be staying as long as Tony pursues higher education, before going off to New York to deal with business.
Tony nods. “I’ll schmooze around for a bit. I’ll see you inside. We’ll get some couple photos for People or TMZ or something.”
“You know that I never wanted to make weapons, but I did it anyway. You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. Now, I’m trying to protect the people that I put in harm’s way. I know in my heart that this is right.”
He leaves the bowl of water and washcloth on Peter’s bedside table and hurries over to Jamie’s room. The toddler is standing in his crib, gripping onto the bars with dear life as he yelled for his Momma. Jamie immediately quiets upon seeing his mother.
Tony smiles back. “With them, it does feel like I have everything. Zeke is the oldest. He’s going to be 14 soon. God, time flies by. I remember the day I met him. It was after my honeymoon when I was setting up the house we lived in Massachusetts. I mean, I technically met him before, hell I held him for like an hour at the wedding, but I didn’t really become his mom until that day. No one can tell me he’s not mine, I don’t care that there’s no blood shared between us.”
He finds Obie laying face down on their bed, completely knocked out. Tony avoids making any noise that would wake his husband up, not wanting to deal with however Obie would react to last night. He quickly gets his go-bag packed and Obie stays asleep. However, when Tony looks into the mirror after putting on lotion and sunscreen, he can see his Alpha looming over his shoulder.
Obie stops playing the piano and starts walking toward Tony and the couch. He pulls the Omega onto his lap and kisses Tony’s bonding gland possessively. Obie was probably doing it for Pepper’s benefit, as the Alpha is usually more touchy around other people. Tony just went on“The board is claiming you have post-traumatic stress. They’re filing an injunction. They want to lock you out.”
“Yes, it’s very cool.” They pose for the picture, and Tony rambles, not even really understanding himself what he is saying, but the young soldier seems to take a bit to heart.
Alphas of any secondary sex can only sire offspring, they cannot bear/carry them. On the other hand, Omegas of any secondary sex can only bear/carry offspring, they cannot sire them. Beta Males can sire with a Beta Female or Omega partner. They can also carry offspring with an Alpha partner with much difficulty. Beta Females can carry offspring with a Beta Male or Alpha partner. They can also sire offspring with an Omega partner with much difficulty.
Pepper smiles warmly. “I need you to sign this before you go. You’re going to need to head out now. I know you’re going to want to drop the boys off at school, and that will already make you late.”
“You’re going to do it,” the Omega explains to the Beta, “Go to the central console, open up all the circuits. When I get clear of the roof, I’ll let you know. You’re going to hit the master bypass button. It’s going to fry everything up here.”
Once arriving and settling Zeke into a guest room, Tony rants to his mother about his husband and she patiently listens. Then she says the five words that have always shattered his world, “It is what it is.”
“Way to go, babe! I’ll see you tomorrow. Love you.” With that, the Alpha hung up the phone. Obie really knew how to put on a show for an audience.
When Tony looks up, he sees Zeke standing over him, silent tears running down the boy’s face. In a split second, Tony decides. He quickly packs a go-bag and takes Zeke with him to go see his mother.
Things settle again a day or two after Tony’s Heat. At least until it doesn’t. The Alpha leader opens the little slot in the metal door to yell the command for the captives to put their hands behind their heads, and a dozen of them march in.
He grabbed the extraterrestrial object, and for a second he was unsure of what to do. How was he supposed to use this? He knew that this was the only thing that could possibly help bring Tony back into his life, but how? Steve did the only he could do possibly do in his desperation.
Tony picks up his Beta son with an exaggerated grunt. “What were you screaming about, tiny one? I can’t be by your side 24/7 Mister.”
“You’ll have to go to the Tower and find out for yourself.” With that, Steve disconnected the call and crushed the phone in his hand, letting the pieces fall to the ground as he continued to make his way to the Headquarters building. He no longer had use for it and he didn’t want the Avengers to be able to track him with it.
Steve remains calm in the face of the old man yelling at him. “You know, I’ve heard him complaining about his packages going missing for months, even though they are supposed to be delivered to his door and he always gets picture updates of them at his door with every delivery. The landlord has said he is going to set up a camera system on all the floors, but it seems 5J couldn’t wait and set his own trap. You, Mr. Bassett, had no reason to come near 5J or pick up 5J’s package. You’ve been caught red-handed.”
It is a Friday evening, so Nanny Clara is gone, seeing as with Tony back, she had weekends off again, though with school out she has much more work during the weekdays. Zeke is also home indefinitely.
Tony meets Pepper Potts when she comes in for a job interview as his personal assistant to see Tony trying to juggle a rowdy child, a screaming toddler, and a crying infant. Pepper quickly whisks Peter and Zeke away to let Tony feed an infant Harley in peace. He offers her a job on the spot.
Tony Stark, on the other hand, couldn’t give less of a shit. He has known this day was coming since the day he truly understood what it meant to be Omega in his father’s eyes. Sure, by law, he could inherit Stark Industries and his father’s many properties and assets as an Omega. But his father, ever the traditionalist, would never let that happen. He has known since he was 4 years old and his father caught him building a motherboard. He has known since his father screamed at him hoarse and his mother sat him down and explained his place in this society.
“Okay, I am beat,” Tony declares after all the food is gone, “Boys, do you wanna join me for a nap? I’m tired, but I still want to be with all my babies.”
“It’s an inside joke between me and your mom, kiddo,” Pepper smiles as she reaches out to ruffle the young Alpha’s hair.
Barnes flashed Steve a vicious smile, even as he was visibly struggling to breathe, “No one sent me. You were getting distracted. This nuisance needed to be eliminated.”
“Sir,” JARVIS interrupts, “It seems that Jamie is awake and calling for your attention.” The screen on the wall becomes a video of his youngest crying for his mother.
Tony waits for Rhodey’s response with bated breath. Rhodey is his brother, but he is also an airman, a part of the United States military.
“Maybe Tony could handle it if he didn’t waste his time on those silly degrees he’ll never use and spend his time doing his duty as an Omega,” Howard says bitterly.
Tony is brimming with excitement. He would be bouncing on the balls of his feet, had Rhodey not forced him into a wheelchair right when he left that Middle Eastern hospital.
Harley Keener Stane is born screaming at the top of his lungs on March 14, 2002, named after the motorcycle Tony and Rhodey have been slowly rebuilding unbeknownst to his husband, his own true piece of freedom away from Obie.
“Yeah, well, we’ve got a weapons depot that was just blown up a few clicks from where you were being held captive.”
“Oh my god,” Pepper gasps once she gets close to the Omega, staring at the glowing device in Tony’s chest, “Is that the thing that’s keeping you alive.”
“More than the one, but you already know about Zeke,” Tony fibs. He’s not just going to tell her about Harley and Peter just because she came across Jamie, “I’m just here to remind you that not only will I rip you to shreds in court should you break the NDA, but that if you tell anyone about my children, you will be endangering the lives of innocent children. Oh, I’m also here to watch the show.”
Though Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy are all there, Tony uses this time to focus on his children. He lets Peter and Harley babble on about the last three months, everything from school to Nanny Clara, both boys eager to share with their mother. Zeke, on the other hand, is quiet, Tony having to pry information out of him. Zeke’s worry and sorrow are written so clearly on his face that Tony’s attempts become half-hearted. He knows that he will have to talk to the Beta privately later.
Tony’s first year of marriage comes to an end. In that time, Tony finishes his two Masters in Electrical Engineering and Physics and Zeke graduates kindergarten. Rhodey goes into active duty, so the best friends mostly communicate by phone and snail-mail. Howard still refuses to let Tony work on any SI projects, much to Obie’s chagrin. Tony doesn’t mind much, he’d rather not be designing weapons anyway, and SI and its Board had yet to accept that the future lies in computers. Obie hits Tony a couple more times, but not nearly as much as Howard used to, so Tony doesn’t actually mind much. (And he
Obie grabs Tony’s forearm, spins him around, and slams him against the dresser. Tony could feel the bruises start to form on his lower back. “Don’t you ever,” Obie growls, “make me look that stupid ever again. I don’t care if the kid was
So they go to SI Malibu first to Obie’s press conference. There’s a crowd of people in front of the building that starts applauding as the car pulls up. Obie meets Tony right at the car, opening the door for the Omega and greeting him with a kiss, both passionate and performative. “We were supposed to meet at the hospital,” the Alpha says as he pulls away.
“Peter,” Tony says as he walks in, “what are you doing up? You should be resting, baby. You’re sick.”
Obie lifts Tony’s chin up with his pointer finger. “Did you now, Omega?” The Alpha smirks. “You missed your April Heat. Must’ve had it in Afghanistan.” The touch of one finger becomes a grip between two. “Tell me, did you let anyone else touch you there?”
“Yeah, I feel great.” A chuckle slips out of Tony, and then two, and then Tony is thrown into full-blown laughter.
“I’m afraid Commander Rogers that you do not have the security clearance necessary to access that information and that I must inform the Avengers of your arrival,” JARVIS said coolly. Steve knew that JARVIS never liked him. He could nearly hear the disapproval in the AI’s voice every time Tony brought him home, though he never once made such disapproval clear.
Tony strips out of his jeans, which would’ve been impossible to dance in, and hooks a leg around the pole.**
“I’m okay,” Tony reassures his sons, though not successfully.  His children continue to stand a foot or so away from him. “Just come here, would you?” The Omega demands in exasperation.
Abruptly remembering his children, Tony turns to the play area. Peter and Harley look at Tony with unshed tears in their eyes, waiting for their mother to give them the okay to enter the general workshop space.
When Yahya finally enters Tony, it is almost more intimate than Tony can take. It’s slow and steady, and the Alpha looks directly at Tony the entire time, kissing him sweetly every couple of strokes. He even reaches between them and strokes Tony’s cock in time with his thrusts. Yahya doesn’t try to turn him on his stomach and mount Tony. He doesn’t set a brutal pace from the beginning and expect Tony to just take it.
“From the time that I have to introduce myself when I’m calling you. What in the hell is that noise?”
“We’re almost sordid gossip,” Pepper giggles into Tony’s ear, “The billionaire dancing intimately with his PA.”
As Pepper leaves, Tony is left with his children, hoping that Pepper gets him the information before Obie gets back from wherever he is.
“Override alpha-pizza-theta-Tesla-Jones. Tell me where the Tesseract is,” Steve nearly screamed, a dangerous undertone to his voice. Steve had known keeping a close ear while Tony spoke to JARVIS would be of use to him someday. Nothing would stop Steve from getting Tony back, not even Tony’s own creation.
“Peter. Harley,” Tony sobs as he clutches the two young boys against him, ignoring the ache of his muscles and bones and finally letting out the turmoil of emotions he has felt being away from his family. Looking up, Tony sees Zeke standing a few feet away, lip quivering as the boy tries to keep the tears at bay. “Why are you just standing there, kiddo?” Tony asks wetly. “Come over here.”
They don’t hug for long as they have work to do. They have to finish building the armored suit tonight.
“Sure, go ahead. You’ve impressed me. Must be persistent if you went to all the trouble of getting my personal number for family and friends only.”
Tony makes his way to the front of the house, spotting Obie with a blonde Beta woman. The woman spots Tony first and becomes slightly startled. Tony doesn’t know if it’s surprise over Obie so blatantly cheating on Tony or over seeing Tony Stane with a toddler on his hip.
The doors are thrown open and a crowd of Alphas and Betas slowly walks in, all of them holding guns.
Tony is obviously aged down. He is born on May 29, 1980, instead of 1970. Other characters ages have been adjusted as such (like Rhodey, who meets and befriends Tony at MIT, has his age adjusted so that would still occur).
“Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?”
An hour into the trip, a flight attendant walks up to the duo and hands them hot towels. “Good morning, From Stane. Major Rhodes. Your sushi will be coming soon”
“Where are we?” Tony starts to ask. Then the sound of a latch opening echoes in the cave and a loud voice is heard from beyond the metal doors.
Betas make up about 50% of the world population, evenly split between male and female. Alphas make up about 30%, 20% male and 10% female. Omegas make up about 20%, 15% female and 5% male.
They stop in front of a pile of scrap metal and spare parts. The Alpha leader speaks. Tony’s fellow captive translates once again.
The last thing he remembers before passing out is blood seeping through his bulletproof vest and into his shirt. The last thing he thinks about,
In one swift go, the Alpha rips out the arc reactor. Tony can immediately feel the loss. “I did love you, you know? You were a good Omega, one that I always deserved. You listened to everything I said and did everything I told you, even if sometimes you just needed a little encouragement. You were a good mother. Sure, you gave me a handful of defectives, but you got it right once. You gave me an Alpha son. Oh, and you were a good fuck. I loved having you under me, vulnerable. You’re so pretty when you’re all laid down and adorned in the bruises I’ve put onto your skin. I think I’ll miss that the most.”
Tony laughs humorlessly. “My father married me off to his preferred successor when I was 18, though the engagement was from when I was 16, because I’m an Omega. And Omegas can’t initiate divorce unless there’s a serious case of abuse. Even those are usually brushed under the rug. Let’s just say, I didn’t forget you from Bern because I was drunk, I forgot you because of the severe concussion I got from my husband teaching me a lesson after getting ‘too cozy with some Beta woman.’”
“Hello Captain Rogers,” JARVIS greeted. There was a millisecond of silence before realization dawned upon the AI. “Captain Rogers? But I’ve detected Captain Rogers to already be in the building. I must alert Si—“
After hours of research at the closest library that Steve could find, he found that the Tony here was quite similar to his Tony. Just like his Tony, the Tony here lived a carefree lifestyle up until he was kidnapped in Afghanistan, where he got his arc reactor and turned his life around. The sudden death of Obadiah Stane that was reported to be due to a “plane crash” likely indicated that Stane had tried to kill Tony in this world too. There was some partying that came after Afghanistan, but the abrupt end of it also points towards the palladium poisoning that Tony thought would kill him. Just like his Tony, this Tony was willing to sacrifice his life to save everyone else by taking that nuke into the wormhole during the Battle of New York. There were some differences, though. This Tony had faced some villains like Vanko and the Mandarin that his Tony had not. His Tony had also faced villains that this Tony had not, like the Taskmaster and Doctor Doom. It also seemed as though this world wasn’t quite as progressed as his world, around 5 to 10 years behind.
After sending one last glance Tony’s way, Steve turned around and sauntered out of the room and out of the house, knowing what he had to do next.
“What is going on here?” Tony turns to the voice in question. It’s Pepper, who he had not even noticed had come in.
“You’re the one who was kidnapped and imprisoned by terrorists,” Zeke rebuts, “We should be worrying about you. Not the other way around.”
The elevator doors finally closed. “Going up to Office Floor 67. Sir is in Conference Room 38.” It seems that this JARVIS would also not like Steve. Again, Steve didn’t care.
Obie is not home when Tony finally comes home from the gala, thankfully. Happy leaves once he’s seen that Tony has come back from the gala, waving Tony off as he apologizes again for asking the Alpha for last-minute babysitting. Tony checks to make sure all four of his kids have gone to sleep and is surprised to find Zeke still awake at 2:00am.
Pepper grimaces, “Obie didn’t want me to bring them, said it was too public. He didn’t want to pull them out of school either, but they should be out in 2 hours or so. Happy is going straight to pick up Zeke after dropping you off.”
“For ten years, I’ve been married to you and held this company up. I built this company from nothing! Nothing is going to stand in my way. Least of all an Omega like you!” Obie throws Tony into a bus and sends a missile his way. The explosion blasts Tony into the air, and before Tony can crash down, he uses the repulsors to hover.
Obie is completely unaffected. He just gets up and picks up a car in front of them, filled with a father and her children. “I love this suit,” Obie exclaims.
“It’s your birthday?” Tony asks in jest. In the corner of his eye, Tony can see Peter rolling his eyes.
Tony had crash-landed in the desert after completely obliterating the Ten Rings encampment. He spends days walking, trying to find a lick of civilization. If not somewhere he could contact home, somewhere he could rest and eat and drink water.
**Yinsen will be referred to as Yahya for generally the rest of the fic, unless Tony deliberately calls him Yinsen.
“I know you haven’t gotten anything ready for Afghanistan yet. You might only be there for two days, but you still need a go-bag. And if you want to spend time with the kids before you go, you’re going to have to get that ready now before they wake up. I also have some things I need to discuss with you before you go.”
“Fine,” the doctor bites, “But we took some bloodwork, and the test results came back so I may as well tell you those. Most of it states the obvious: high blood pressure, low blood sugar, low cholesterol, all likely due to malnutrition. However, the test results also state that you are pregnant, about a week or so. It is too early to be detected through your scent, which is why it wasn’t obvious immediately. That should change soon, however. Considering the circumstances, I will hold my congratulations. I will leave you to inform your Alpha about that, and you can talk about your options with him and your obstetrician. I will go get you those forms now.”
The soldiers are running towards them and as they come closer Tony can start to make them out. It’s Rhodey. Rhodey came for him. Tony can feel his eyes watering.
requires, including, occasionally, taking out the trash. Will that be all?” Pepper never lets the smile on her face waver, but Everhart’s drops instantaneously. Pepper directs the blonde to a bathroom where she can quickly get dressed, and Tony finally lets out the laughter he was holding. He loves Pepper tearing down Obie’s exploits.
That’s not his problem, however. Tony can’t put the arc reactor in himself. He needs someone with more slender fingers. He knows just who to call.
“I still use Ho Yinsen since, like my parents, it was the name I grew into professionally. But my family, my friends, and the rest of Gulmira know me as Yahya. Yahya Hadad Khan.”
“That’s alright baby,” Tony coos, “This is grown-up work.” The six-year-old shrugs and turns back to his coloring book while Tony turns back to his personal assistant.
Immediately, Peter, Harley, and Zeke rush in, Rhodey and Happy, who was carrying a sleeping Jamie, on their tails. “Momma,” the Alpha child and the Omega child exclaim in unison as they throw themselves onto Tony, causing him to tense. Noticing this, the two young boys quickly scramble off of him.
He finds Obie by the press taking pictures and sidle up next to him. “Have you seen these pictures? What’s going on in Gulmira?”
He then flies overhead he starts to target the cache of weapons this faction of the Ten Rings held. Unexpectedly, he is quite literally blown out of the sky. He crashes to the ground, but it is not enough to stop him. He blows up the tank that tries to shoot at him before heading towards the sky once again. Then he targets the Jericho missiles and the blast destroys everything. Tony’s work is done here.
Tony can’t help the small smile the started to grow on his face. His boys were all as stubborn as he was. So he lets it go and enjoys a meal with his family.
“Now, don’t let it touch the,” Tony felt the spark of electricity running through him before he could finish, “sides when you’re coming out.”
“Nothing, Wasp,” Steve said calmly as The Wasp continued to scream at him through the phone, “I have not done anything to Iron Man, but I would still check on him if I were you.”
JARVIS is running, fabricating, and painting Mark II, which will take the rest of the night. Tony takes the time to spend some time with his babies.
“Let’s face it. This is not the worst thing you’ve caught me doing,” the Omega says, trying to ease the tension.
“My youngest is James. He’s my baby. He’s 26 months and walking and talking now. He’s a Beta like Zeke, and I named him after the two greatest Betas I know. He was definitely a surprise. I was on birth control that got canceled out by some antibiotics. He wasn’t even conceived during a Heat. I’m glad though. I love him. I love all of them. And I can’t wait to get back home to them.”
When Tony comes back to the dining room to see off his kids, they’ve all finished their dinner and Zeke has started clearing the table.
“He’s dead,” a voice behind them announces. Tony and Pepper turn towards the voice. It’s the agent from whatever agency that approached him at the Firefighters’ Gala.
Then Stark Industries and the Stane family all move to Malibu, in a large mansion on a private beach, a stark contrast to their still large, but relatively smaller Cambridge home. Obie lives with them full time now. It’s a huge adjustment for everyone.
As he walks down the aisle, Tony scans the crowds and feels a bit of tension leave his body as he finds his best friend Rhodey amongst the faces, looking solemn as he watches Tony walk by. Edwin Jarvis, the man Tony considered to
“Override alpha-pizza-theta-Tesla-Jones. Take me to Tony Stark,” Steve said calmly, though he was anything but. This was a risk. This was a different world. With so much different, what was the likelihood that this one override code stays exactly the same?
“Come here,” Tony says as he waves the two young boys over. The young Omega and Alpha don’t waste a second as they dash towards their mother’s open arms.
“You want to know what happened in Afghanistan, Obie?” Tony yells. He painfully and with difficulty twists out of Obie’s grip and rips open his shirt to expose the arc reactor. “I almost died! And I had to put this in me to keep myself alive!”
“My father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero.”
They nearly finish unpacking by the end of the day. There was a lot less than Tony thought. The only thing left was the stuff for Tony’s workshop, which he vehemently would not unpack around a small child. Zeke had really opened up by the end of the day too. He was chatting nonstop through dinner and his bath. It was as Tony gets the boy ready for bed that he becomes suspiciously quiet.
“Oh Tony.” Pepper reaches out to hug the Omega. “We’ll figure it out.” As he holds on to one of his best friends, Tony sincerely hopes that that is true.
When Steve could finally see again, he immediately noticed the change in his surroundings. He was in an alley in the middle of Manhattan, a couple of hundred miles from the middle-of-nowhere, upstate New York the Avengers Headquarters was located, but it was more than just the change in location that confused Steve. The Manhattan that he was in did not match the Manhattan that Steve remembered.
was the best thing that had ever happened to him. Steve was damn well lucky HYDRA hadn’t given him the chair in the past two years, and he wasn’t going to risk that in any way. He wasn’t going to risk losing the best thing that’s ever happened to him. Even if Tony decided to leave him, to end whatever it was that they were, he would still have the memories, and maybe that would be enough.
They don’t completely finish before the Ten Rings figure them out. The explosive on the door buys them some time. But not enough. So Yahya does something stupid. He doesn’t stick to the plan. Tony wishes he had just
“It’s not that simple,” Rhodey sighs, but he does not continue to argue. “I know you think this was something you had to do, but I need you to take care of yourself, Tony. You’ve got four beautiful children that need you and one more on the way.”
Harley and Peter reluctantly let go of their mother so he can move freely. Then, the adolescent Beta drags Tony to the living room where they had an impressive spread of food set up, the younger children on their heels.
“Let’s.” Tony grabs Pepper’s hand and leads her to and on the dance floor, which got them some looks seeing as they were going against conventional dynamic standards with an Omega leading a Beta.
“I was referring to your company’s involvement in this latest atrocity,” the Beta says matter-of-factly.
“There’s just one thing left,” Zeke drags on the last word as he types furiously. “And now I’m done.”
The man ignores Tony and gets closer to Yahya. He forces Yahya’s head down, though the other Alpha resists. “Do you think I’m a fool? Tell me
“He’s all yours,” Tony says as he throws the Alpha by the feet of the villagers that were once oppressed by him, his voice coming out a bit tinny through the suit’s speakers.
Steve quickly made his way to the 82nd floor, knowing that he had to get this done before the override wore off and JARVIS informed the Avengers of his presence. He made his way down to the storage room on the 82nd floor and immediately located the Tesseract. How could you mistake a large, glowing, blue cube like that?
Happy Hogan gets the job as Tony’s bodyguard/chauffeur after Tony finds Happy entertaining the wandering 8-year-old Tony was frantically searching as he patiently waited for his job interview.
“Obie called for a press conference. It would’ve been right after your visit to the hospital, but since you refuse to go, well…”
Steve once had the misfortune of being stuck in an elevator with Mr. Bassett. At that point, Steve had been wary of the man but did not necessarily hate him. However, that quickly changed when Mr. Bassett proudly shared alarming stories about his French soldier father who was in Algeria in the 50s and his great-grandfather who he claims contributed one of the skulls of Algerian freedom fighters that were on display in Paris’s National Museum of Natural History. The old Frenchman declared how proud he was that his country kept them against the wishes of “those dirty camel jockeys” in order to preserve the history of “the great French empire.” It took everything in Steve not to punch the old man, and he really only didn’t because it’d be bad to be on the receiving end of a restraining order against his neighbor; he’d rather not have to move. Needless to say, that hour solidified Steve’s intense hatred for the man that continues to grow each day.
“JARVIS,” Tony interrupts, “Sometimes you got to run before you can walk. Ready? In three, two, one”
“Of course, sir,” JARVIS remarks dryly, “however, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt.”
And with that, the Alpha drives away, leaving Tony standing in front of his home for the first time in months.
“They had my weapons, Pepper. Guns, missiles, bombs, whatever Stark Industries sells weapons-wise, they had. I need to figure out how.”
The assembly bots come together to mold the suit onto his form. For the first time, Tony suits up in the entirely completed Mark II suit.
Tony strides over to where his son is sitting and presses the back of his hand to Peter’s forehead. “Well, your fever’s broken. Did you sleep through the night? Did you throw up this morning?”
Every couple of hours when Tony’s Heat flares up and becomes too uncomfortable to bear, they slip away to the blindspot to dull the ache but come back as quickly as possible so as not to alert the Ten Rings. Sometimes they sleep when Yahya’s knot settles, tired from their activities, but sometimes they talk, when Tony isn’t feeling embarrassed and self-conscious. It’s the most comfortable Heat that Tony has ever shared with anyone.
worry about you. It is my job to. I always want you to come to me when something is wrong, no matter what. Now tell me what’s going through that brain of yours?”
He has shucked off the armor, which is now buried somewhere under the desert of Afghanistan. He has a cloth over his head and shoulders to avoid the beaming sun coming in direct contact with as much of his skin as possible. Tony’s mouth is starting to get dry; he curses himself for not thinking to carry water in any way with him. He’s tired, more so than he’s ever been in his entire life.
The mood in the room instantly shifts. Both Obie and Howard look at the screen in disdain. Tony’s mother becomes nervous, fidgeting with the bracelets on her arm. The appointment wraps up quickly after that. Tony says nothing the whole way home. Obie drops Tony and Zeke off at home and heads for New York with Howard and Maria.
“It’s Ms. And I hope you can take time out of your busy schedule to answer some questions,” bitterness dripping from the words of the woman. Tony notes that she very obviously skirts around the issue of how she got his immediate, personal contact information.
So Tony stands in front of the mirror in his wedding suite as his mother adjusts his faded white wedding dress when his father comes in to retrieve him. Howard walks up to Tony and smiles, “You’re making me proud today, son.” Tony held back a grimace. Of course it would be the day he gets married that would make Howard proud. Not when he built a motherboard as a 4-year-old. Not when he built a nearly-sentient robot dog at 11. Not when he made one of the first rudimentary AIs in existence at 17. No, it is the day Tony will sign his life away.
“How ironic, Tony,” the Alpha bellows, “You never wanted to build weapons, and yet you built the best one ever! And now I’m going to kill you with it!”
Tony crouches down as best as he could in his tuxedo and ruffles the young Alpha’s hair. “Yeah, I do, bub. This is a really important event, and it’s really weird that your Dad didn’t tell me about it, let alone bring me with him.”
Tony drops Harley and Peter at school, racing with Happy to the school to make the boys squeal and squirm in their seats in excitement. (Tony wins, but only because Happy lets him.) Tony hugs them both long and hard, not wanting to let them go.
“Collateral damage, Tony.” Obie looks as though he is about to throw the vehicle, but Tony is quicker. He diverts power into the chest piece and blasts Obie with a unibeam. Tony catches the car as Obie staggers and loses his grip on it.
When the duo arrives in the living room, Harley and Peter are mindlessly watching cartoons as Zeke sits to the side glaring at his laptop as he absentmindedly pushes a sleeping Jamie in a rocking cradle. Tony decides to take advantage of the fact that his kids are distracted and sneaks up behind them. He grabs Peter and Harley and kisses them all over their faces as the two of them shriek in laughter and try to wiggle out of his grasp. Zeke looks up from the computer to laugh at his brothers. Even Pepper breaks out a smile. Finally, the Omega lets them go with one last kiss to their temples.
Being married doesn’t really have any drastic changes, other than Zeke. He spends a lot of time with Zeke, especially in the summer. Nanny Clara’s burden is eased as Tony plays the parental role in Zeke’s life that Obie never bothered to. It’s harder during the year as Tony tries to finish his Masters's degrees, nevertheless, Tony gives Zeke as much attention as he can. He even introduces Zeke to Rhodey. (The boy is instantly impressed with this Beta soldier, and many times says he would like to be like him when he gets older.)
It’s an Alpha son, and Obie becomes as unbearable in the second half of his second pregnancy as he was in the first half of his first pregnancy.
The line disconnects as Tony waits idly for Pepper to come down to his workshop. As soon as Pepper enters, Tony perks up. “Hey. Let’s see them. Show me your hands. Let’s see ‘em.”
“That’s what you always say,” Steve said calmly before he closed the door behind him, though his rapidly beating heart betrayed the emotions he was trying to externally display. Tony said it every time they fought like this. And it still broke his heart every time. Because this time it could be true. This time he could mean it. Steve knew, because of who he was, because of who he was made to be, every moment with Tony could be his last.
The soldier next to him hesitantly started raising his hand. “You’re kidding me with the hand up, right?”
Tony looks up to his best friend and nods. Then he directs his gaze to his eldest son. “Watch the little ones for me, Zeke. We will just be over there.”
“No, no, no, no, no, the less I know, the better. What am I supposed to tell the press?” Rhodey says exasperated.
Of course. Tony doesn’t know if Obie was doing this to punish him for missing the award ceremony or if he really just did not care. Tony was leaning more towards the second option. Nonetheless, Tony knows the routine. He grabs a general NDA that he usually has lying around for one of Obie’s
“Okay, fine,” the Alpha concedes, “But I need something to give these guys, Tony. Give me a bone to throw them.”
On February 11, 2008, Tony Stane should be accepting the Apogee Award in Las Vegas, presented to him by his best friend. Instead, he is at home all the way in Malibu taking care of his sick child because he cannot bear to leave him alone in such pain.
By getting married today, Tony Stark will essentially be handing over his entire autonomy to his Alpha. His Alpha will have to give him permission to get a job, to be on certain medications, to buy certain items. Tony Stark is signing away his freedom today, not that he had any to begin with. And he was ready.
(Tony goes to Zeke’s prekindergarten graduation that next Monday. Obie does not. Tony resigns himself to a life like his mother’s; history has a funny way of repeating itself like that.)
He gets out of the Hum-vee. He’s not even sure where he is going, he just knows that he needs to get out. His ears are still ringing.
Tony gives Zeke a mock wounded look and places a hand over his heart as Happy guffaws from the driver’s seat of the other car. “I am hurt. My eldest child has turned against me. I have nurtured you since you were but a babe, and this is the thanks I get. The job of a mother is truly a thankless one.”
“Alright,” Obie sighs. He shifts the Omega off of his lap and moves to get off the couch. “I should head out now. I’ve got more fires to extinguish back in Manhattan.”
“Are you commenting on the weight of a pregnant person? Now that is just rude JARVIS. I raised you better than that.”
That seems to be all Zeke needs to hear, as the adolescent Beta takes off towards the Omega, similarly to his younger brothers. “Momma, you’re home!” Zeke wails as he throws himself towards the Omega, “You’re finally home!” Tony’s chest becomes tight; Zeke hasn’t called him Momma in years.
Tony hides behind a crate. He runs through all his options. He doesn’t have many. He has to go to his last resort. “Pepper?” Tony asks into the comm again.
“How was the Fun-vee?” Rhodey asks jokingly, but Tony can hear the relief and joy in his voice. Tony can feel the tears falling now. Rhodey goes to his knees and embracing Tony, squeezing Tony as tight as possible, as if he would disappear any second now. “Next time you ride with me.”
“No you wouldn’t. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn’t have been able to stand, much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.” Sure, let’s say it was because he was drunk and not because Obie beat him so hard, he cracked his skull.
Rhodey lets go first, and as he moves back, he gives Tony an odd look. He reaches out and fingers the collar of Tony’s shirt, pulling it down ever so-slightly. “Tony,” Rhodey starts to ask, looking directly at the device in the younger man’s chest, “What is this?”
For his first marriage anniversary, his mother hosts a little dinner, where his father not-so-subtly prods Tony and Obie on when they are going to start having children.
Each time they dunk him, they keep him under just until he edges upon a plane of unconsciousness, then they drag him up again for a moment or two of breath and to scream at him before repeating the process. The pain of it is excruciating. Tony’s lungs are burning. His nostrils are burning. His head hurts and he is dizzy from the lack of oxygen. On top of all that, there is the electromagnet that they put inside him. A couple of drops of water in the wrong place and Tony was in for a world of trouble. (Not that he wasn’t
The reception is a blur. Obadiah and Tony greet people, make conversation, and take pictures. At one point Zeke is handed off to Tony, though the boy stays quiet for the whole hour that he is held by his stepmother before a caretaker whisks him away. After hours of socialization and networking, Tony is tired and ready to go home, though he knows that that is no longer possible.
“Good God, you’re a woman,” Tony says astonished. Tony already knew she was Beta, having picked this transport specifically because none of the soldiers were Alphas, but he had no idea one of them was a Beta woman. A Beta woman in the military is not exactly few and far between, but it is unexpected; most people in service are Alphas and Beta men. (You’ll get an Omega soldier once in a lifetime. It isn't illegal per se, but Alphas usually don't want to give their Omega permission to go into active combat, and they are never taken seriously.) Tony was impressed. “I honestly... I couldn't have called that. I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.”
“Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out you don’t pull out the magnet at the end of it.” But Tony is a bit too late in his warning. “That was it. You just pulled it out!”
And before Steve knew it, the Tesseract glowed immensely bright, blinding him and engulfing the room in a blue light that eclipsed the light of the alarms.
“Push it!” And she does. The blast pushes Tony back onto the roof, but also away from the beam of energy. Obie catches the brunt of it, frying his suit and leaving the Alpha unconscious. The suit falls through the roof and into the arc reactor, exploding on impact. Tony loses consciousness himself.
“No, no, no,” Tony reassures, “I swear Rhodey that is not what happened. It’s not what you’re thinking.”
“Hello, I’m Dr. Demir,” the Beta man says without looking up from the clipboard he had in hand, “And I will be the physician examining you today, From Stane.”
The old Frenchman splutters, seemingly searching for some sort of retort. That’s when the elevator chimed and the resident of the apartment of topic came out. Steve immediately gets flustered at the sight of the gorgeous man. He may have a tiny crush, as much as anyone could have on someone they had never had a conversation with before. And it is a tiny crush, no matter what Bucky says.
Tony walks off the podium to the resounding sound of screaming reporters and just catches Obie’s furious look as he moves to leave the building. As he exits, Tony can hear Obie tell the press that Pepper and Rhodey will be continuing the conference. Tony continues to walk off and towards the limo (God Obie is so excessive sometimes) waiting outside the building.
Knowing that Air Force jets are coming his way, Tony accelerates his speed, but that doesn’t stop a missile from coming his way. He sends flares in response, and the explosion causes him to lose control of flight for a moment. He regains control just as the jets started shooting at him. With the damage he sustained from the Ten Rings, the suit will not be able to hold against this attack, especially as these were not normal bullets being shot at him. So Tony deploys the flaps to fly backward out of visual range and latches onto the underside of one of the jets. Then he calls Rhodey back.
this fic is in. I remember someone commented asking for everyone's feelings on Tony being gone, and they must be psychic cuz I was in the middle of writing this one-shot when I saw that.
Tony, however, cannot bring himself to fall asleep. Being surrounded by his children makes him think of the little bundle of cells currently nestled in his womb and the sire of said bundle of cells. He isn’t sure how he’s going to do this. How he is going to hide his unborn child’s parentage from his Alpha. Sure, in sleeping with the older man today he will be able to fib the due date to make him believe the child is his, but what about after they are born? There is no way that Tony will be able to pass off a child with South Asian features as the biological child of two white people.
“Oh my God, you crazy son of a bitch. You’re pregnant, what were you thinking? Did you really leave the kids alone? Also, you owe me a plane. You know that, right?”
“Can I help?” Zeke says, staring at Tony with wide, sky blue eyes. Tony blames it on his Omega instincts, but he knew there was no way he would be able to say no to the young boy.
Tony catches his hand before the Alpha could get up. “Wait, there’s something I need to tell you.” Obie turns to look at him. “I’m pregnant.”
They don’t work all the time. At night, things wind down, Tony and Yinsen have some kind of supper in the form of whatever gruel they are provided. At these times, their captors don’t rush in and start yelling at signs of them slowing down. Tony guesses they acknowledge that Tony and Yinsen are human beings that need rest. So, at night they take it easy.
“I’m wondering why my husband didn’t bring me here. I thought we were trying to get the board to see that I’m not suffering from post-traumatic stress and that I can handle being head of R&D still. How are we supposed to do that if I’m not at the most important charitable Stark Industries event of the year?”
When Tony gets there, Harley is fast asleep on his brother’s bed. Great. He would have to wake the boy up, seeing as he couldn’t carry both Harley and Jamie at once. It was times like this Tony wishes Nanny Clara was a stay-at-home nanny. “Harley,” Tony speaks softly, “honey, you can’t sleep here. You have to go to your own room.” The young Alpha lifts his head up sleepily, nods once, and slowly rolls off his brother’s bed. Tony takes his hand and guides his son into his own room and his own bed. He sets Jamie on the bed in order to tuck Harley in and presses a long kiss to his forehead.
Must be teething. Tony grabs one of Jamie’s teething rings out of a drawer and gives it to the toddler who automatically puts it in his mouth. Then, Tony shifts Jamie onto his hip and the Omega & son duo make their way to Peter’s bedroom.
This time Tony doesn’t give Rhodey a chance to respond. “Listen, you have to make sure no one finds out about it, okay Rhodey? You can’t let the doctor touch me, please. No one can know that I have the arc reactor in my chest.”
When a handful of them move their targets from him to the hostages, Tony is forced to lower his gauntlets. Instead, he targets the 4 criminals and shoots them individually so as not to harm the civilians. One of the hostages, a little boy, runs over to his father as he calls out for him. Tony pays no mind to the touching display. Instead, he goes over to where the Ten Rings commander, the one who was once in charge of keeping him hostage, is hiding and pulls him through a wall and out into the open.
“Yeah, vacation’s over,” Tony continues to joke. Tony pulls Pepper into a hug first, and then Happy, both squeezing him long and hard.
Zeke nods and tucks his head into the crook of Tony’s neck. Tony then runs his hand through Zeke’s hair until the adolescent Beta slowly falls asleep, the last of his children to do so.
Everhart. Of course. Well, you couldn’t say that she isn’t persistent. This also explains how she was able to not only acquire his personal number but also get past its security. Regardless, Tony loses any respect he had for the woman after only talking to her once. “We’ve spoken before,” Tony says coolly, “Obie, make sure you get her to sign this NDA. Let her know she can’t say anything about the house, the kids, yada yada.”
Jamie, ever so receptive to the scents and behaviors of his family, squirmed in Tony’s arms to face his mother. “Momma, no,” the toddler pouts angrily as he slaps a small hand onto Tony’s forehead.
Tony hears them before he sees them. Tony turns around violently, almost tipping himself over, and there they were. Helicopters flying in his direction.
“Tell me,” Tony spits viciously, just wanting the conversation to end so he could tend to his son, “do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our Intelli-Crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey. That’s all the time I’ve got for you.” Tony hangs up, abruptly, definitely not endearing himself to the woman any more than he had throughout the call.
The two make their way into the plane and get settled. Rhodey looks at some classified documents he probably should not be going over in the vicinity of Tony, and Tony is going over the schematics of the Jericho in order to prepare for the presentation. There’s a sort of comfortable silence that can only exist between true friends.
Once he’s out the door, he’s speeding, to the car, in the car, and getting out of the car. He hands the valet his keys as he tries to get in and to Obie as quickly as possible. He throws quips at a handful of people that try to talk to him as he walks in. Then he spots Obie, who is chatting up someone Tony recognizes as someone Stark Industries is trying to snag as a possible investor.
He has finally done it. Tony has finally completed Mark Two. JARVIS has done all the tests that he needed to after the armor molded onto Tony’s body when Tony indicates that he wants to let it out for a test run.
. Steve was already sure he wasn’t going to like this world.) There were other little things about the area he landed in, about Manhattan as a whole, that didn’t match Steve’s memory: the McDonalds down the block was instead a Shake Shack, the smoke shop that was supposed to be a Japanese restaurant two streets away, apartment complexes that were office buildings and vice versa. The biggest change of all, however, was the tall building in the middle of the Manhattan skyline. It was still the same eyesore that Steve had grown familiar of, yet it was missing something significant. It was missing the big, bold letters along its side that spell out the name of its owner; in its place a single bold letter “A” that Steve knew all too well.
The vehicle in front of them is blown to pieces. They stop, and all but one of the soldiers in Tony's Hum-vee go out into combat. But then, even that soldier leaves as the fighting intensifies.
The Alpha seems to completely ignore Tony as he goes to tend the fire. Tony sits up and finds a mirror on the table beside the cot. He grabs it and immediately starts examining himself.
A Stark Industries missile lands right next to him. Tony starts to scramble away, not even given the time to wonder why
Tony was exhausted all the time after Peter was born. Between finishing his Ph.D. and taking care of two kids, Tony was at the end of his means. Thank God Jarvis had come to help Tony the first couple of weeks before retiring to England.
Obie shakes his head, “I’ve been home a lot because you’ve been gone. I need to go to New York and pacify the Board.”
Of course he did. It’s quite literally the script that Obie gives Tony for the press. God, if Tony could say what he wanted without fear of what his Alpha would do to him or his kids…“Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.”
“Yeah, I hear that a lot. Listen, I know this must be a trying time for you, but we need to debrief you. There’s still a lot of unanswered questions, and time can be a factor with these things. Let’s just put something on the books. How about the 21st at 7:00pm at Stark Industries?”
*Omegas miss 4 Heat cycles immediately after a pregnancy that goes full term. One can get pregnant outside of a Heat; Heats and Ruts are just periods of higher fertility for Omegas and Alpha, respectively. If an Omega’s Heat and an Alpha’s Rut align, there is 99% guarantee of conception (unless the Omega is on birth control, but the effect of the birth control is weakened from 97% prevention to 63%).
Commander Rogers and Iron Man have been fighting each other for almost a decade now, since near the beginning of the Avenger’s conception. Steve wasn’t quite sure how trying to kill each other became falling into bed with one another, but he was damn glad it did. It was the best thing that ever happened to him.
The next morning, he tells the other Alpha to finally agree to do their bidding. Tony has work to do.
“What,” Tony started breathlessly (Steve was secretly smug about the impact that kiss had on Tony), “
“Okay, okay.” Pepper reaches into the chest cavity once again. It’s a very odd sensation for Tony to feel someone’s hand in his chest.
Since Betas' secondary sex also helps determine reproduction stuff, their gender/sex boundary gets muddled. There is a distinction made between Beta Male and Female that is not made for Omegas and Alphas.
“I was different. I always felt that way. And I always felt something missing. So after living and studying in China for 25 years. I went back to the town my family was from, Gulmira. I had never been there. My parents never taught me Dari or Pashto. But I wanted to connect to my culture, tap into this unexplored part of my identity. I learned both Dari and Pashto while living there. I became the local doctor. I was still able to go to conferences around the world and continue my research and medical practices, it was just a tad more difficult. I met my wife in Gulmira; She’s a strong-headed, openhearted Beta. We settled there, and I’ve never looked back.”
But he keeps going for the people he cares about. He thinks of Happy. Of Rhodey. And Pepper. Of Zeke and Peter and Harley and Jamie. But most of all. He thinks about Yahya.
My favorite part was the very last line. I've known that's the way I was going to end this chapter since I started rewriting it.
“We gotta hurry. Take this.” Tony hands the new arc reactor to the redhead. “You gotta switch it out quickly.”
When Tony comes to, he’s in a sterile white room laying on a cot that was definitely not the one in the cave. He looks to his right and sees Rhodey asleep with his hands folded in his lap and his head lolled off to the side on a chair next to Tony’s cot. That didn’t look comfortable.
“Nice try,” he hears behind him. Tony stretches out his arm, palm up before realizing he had already taken that gauntlet off.
“You’ve got From Stane,” Tony says as he places the phone between his ear and his shoulder as he dries his hands off.
Tony was in despair for weeks. His mother was ripped away from him because his father was an irresponsible drunk. His mother was so close to seeing the birth of her grandson. Now his children will grow up without their Nonna Maria. He’s not even 20 and he’s lost his mother.
Steve stood outside the oddly-shaped building for a moment, nearly shaking with expectation. This was it. He was finally going to see Tony again, alive. It had been barely a day since Steve Rogers saw a healthy, living Tony Stark. But still, it was too long. And now he was going to see him again. So he took a deep breath and headed towards his destination.
Obie puts the arc reactor in a briefcase. “Oh, it’s beautiful. What a masterpiece. This is your Ninth Symphony, Tony, your legacy. A new generation of weapons with this at its heart. Weapons that will help steer the world back on course, put the balance of power in our hands. The right hands. I wish you could’ve seen my prototype. It’s not as…conservative as yours. Too bad you had to involve Pepper in this. I would have preferred she lived.”
him to get Masters's degrees and PhDs. See, where Howard despises Tony and willfully ignores the fact that his son is far more intelligent than he, Obadiah seems to salivate at the thought. Tony can practically visualize the dollar signs in Obadiah’s eyes whenever Tony explains any sort of project he is working on to his fiancé. To be fair, it was a win-win-win solution: Howard was able to choose his Alpha business partner and protege as his successor, Obadiah would be the next CEO of Stark Industries and would get the Omega partner he always believed he deserved, and Tony would be able to do the one thing he truly wants to do in life,
Tony spies Pepper across the room, and figures that he has found an out. “Tell you what. You got it. You’re absolutely right. I”m just going to go to my assistant over there and we’ll make a date.”
I have one more essay left and then I am done with this semester! However, I have written the next chapter of this in my bouts of procrastination. I was going to write all of IM1 in one chapter. But then I wrote this and it was this long only covering the first 15 minutes of the movie and less than a third of my notes. So it's definitely going to span a couple of chapters, at least 3 and at most 5. The next chapter will hopefully also be posted in a weekish as well. The chapter title if from
Finally, the festivities are over. Tony and Obadiah say their farewell to their family, make sure the nanny had Zeke, and head towards their hotel, where they will stay for the night before honeymooning in the Caribbean for the next two weeks.
Tony is running his fingers soothingly through the hair of his nearly 8-year-old Omega son as he shivers in his sleep, recovering from a nasty stomach bug when he gets the call from Rhodey. Tony sighs. It was to be expected. He’s lucky it’s Rhodey and not Obie. Thank God it wasn’t Obie.
Immediately, Tony is grateful for the fact that Zeke has been kept late for his program and that Harley and Peter are both at sleepovers. Jamie is sleeping soundly upstairs in his room.
After that, most everything with the pregnancy goes off without a hitch. Zeke is excited to be an older brother now. The only downside is that Obie is around more often, which doesn’t lessen Tony’s load in any way; it just means that Tony has to have sex more often with his husband, which is annoying.
At first, it was writer's block and being overwhelmed with the world and then I was busy with school. I just got out of school, so I finally finished the fourth chapter. I'm hoping to do a weekly schedule for the next five to six weeks before school starts like I did before, and then when I have school again, every two to three weeks. I'll try really hard not to go on a 6-month hiatus again. Enjoy the longest chapter I've written yet.
Steve through open the door of the conference room, and the only two individuals in said room looked up in surprise. Steve took a moment to observe that Steve Rogers was the other occupant of the room, but he charged forward regardless.
Rhodey stays silent. Tony continues, “They had my weapons. The guys that took me. They had my weapons and I don’t know how. But I’m going to figure it out. First thing after I get home.”
Tony wakes up to the sounds of Rhodey calling for him. The Beta helps Tony up. “Tony, are you okay?”
Tony looks closely at the rings. Both have inscriptions on them in Pashto. Tony, who has decided to take on the language of his unborn child’s sire, could recognize one word on the smaller ring.
So the two spend the rest of the day unpacking boxes, Zeke helping as much as the small 4-year-old boy could. Nanny Clara never really did come back, Tony decides to give her a call in the morning. At one point, Zeke drops and breaks a lamp that was a gift from the wife of some big insurance CEO, and Zeke instantly goes rigid. Again, Tony’s heart aches at the familiarity of it all. So Tony just whispers conspiratorially to the young Beta that he thought the lamp was ugly anyway (which he did), and Zeke visibly relaxed. Tony cleaned up the mess, and they went on with the day.
The gorgeous man chuckles. “I actually used regular Gorilla Glue for that seeing as it wouldn’t touch your skin. There’s nothing I could do for you there. Your shoes are a lost cause, so why don’t you just slip out of them and go on your way.”
“Momma,” Zeke sniffles as he launches himself into Tony’s lap. Tony wraps his arms around the small boy, and the two stay like that until the pasta gets cold.
Zeke rolled his eyes. “God Ma, you’re so dramatic. You’ll be back before I even come home on the weekend.”
Also, I lied about IM1 being done in 5 chapters. We are actually going to wrap it up the next chapter with a bit of post-movie stuff before we dive into IM2 in the chapter after that.
“Go to sleep. I should be proud of how well I’ve trained you not to keep weekend work to Sunday, but it is only Friday and it’s summer, bub.”
“I’m okay sweetie. It’s nothing serious,” Tony says, trying to sound placating before focusing on Pepper again.
“I’m fine, babe,” Tony says, smiling at Obie in the way people expected an Omega reunited with his Alpha would smile.
Tony tries to reach out again. He feels a tug on something, anchoring him. “I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” the Alpha says. It’s coming from his chest. He rips away at the bandages.
Tony thinks as he fingers the chain around his neck. Soon, as his fingers glide across the stainless steel, he is met with a matching pair of gold rings, wedding rings. The Omega is instantly taken back to when the rings were given to him.
It was all that Zeke needed to hear. It opened the flood gates. “I thought you were dead,” Zeke says with tears streaming down his face, “I wanted to be hopeful, but a part of me thought you were dead, and that belief just grew stronger with each day there was no news.”
So Tony lays back and lets Yinsen do his work. However, the Alpha looming above him is far too reminiscent of another Alpha. Tony starts to breathe heavier but tries to remind his brain that this is not Obie and that Yinsen is not like Obie. Even though he is an Alpha, he is kind and patient. As if to prove his point, the Alpha notices his distress (though probably without knowing the true reason for it) and gives his shoulder a squeeze of encouragement and sends him a reassuring smile. Yinsen was not Obie.
Obie was stunned into silence. Tony curses internally. It was a miscalculation, revealing the arc reactor to Obie in anger like this. Sure, there was no way Tony could hide this from Obie as the man was his Alpha, but this was not how he wanted his husband to find out.
“It’s an arc reactor kiddo, and no of course not,” the Omega soothes, “It was just the first time we ever did it. With more and more practice, it’ll be easier and quicker, I promise.”
“Come on, stand up. Stand up!” The Alpha whispers harshly, grabbing Tony by his elbow in order to drag him up. Tony tries not to flinch, the action reminiscent of Obie.
He stopped by the local smoke shop, browsing through the store before buying an “I Love NY” baseball cap and large, tinted sunglasses that reminded him of Tony, leaving him with just enough money for a subway ride. It wasn’t a perfect disguise, but Steve hoped that despite his large size, he passed enough as a tourist, glad that he wore jeans and a slightly loose-fitting T-shirt instead of tactical gear.
But sometimes, the silence becomes deafening, and thinking about the past they may never get back is painful. So instead, they play backgammon with an old board they found and leftover washers and nuts.
Tony jumps out behind Obie. He latches onto the back of the suit and grips tight enough that the Alpha cannot shake him out. “This looks important,” Tony says as he rips out some wiring from behind the Alpha’s head.
Alpha/Alpha, Beta Male/Beta Male, Beta Female/Beta Female, and Omega/Omega relationships are the relationships considered homosexual. People who are attracted to sexes different from theirs are considered heterosexual (for example - Alphas attracted to Betas and Omegas). People who are attracted to sexes like and unlike their sex are considered bisexual. Pansexual, though under the umbrella of bisexual, specifically also includes all genders and all sexes, as someone can be bisexual and have certain limitations/preferences.
“And,” he starts with exaggerated stress on the word as he pulls out a little eyedropper box, “I also made a solvent that can get rid of the glue. Unless you have anything else to say?”
Pepper’s smile widens as Tony walks toward her. “Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?” Tony asks in jest.
Just as he expected, the Avengers Quinjet flew overhead, heading to the place he had just come from. As he was sure all the Avengers would go to their teammate and friend’s aid, Steve came to the conclusion that the Headquarters would likely be empty, leaving him to complete his mission in peace with no obstacles.
“Hey honey, sorry I’m late,” Tony says as he approaches Obie, leaning up to peck the Alpha on the lips. There was no way Obie could get mad and make a scene now; Tony has made his appearance intentional now. “You know how Zeke is on the weekends.”
They land in Afghanistan. Rhodey has slept off his intoxication, and if he is hungover, he makes no indication of it. (But he does throw Tony a dirty look, to which the Omega only responds with a sly grin.) Tony makes a bullshit speech about “the weapon you only have to fire once” and sprinkling in a mention or two of his father, again using a script prepared by Obie, and then he blows up the desert.
to be marrying Obadiah. Howard was seeking suitors even older and even more traditional before Obadiah was an option. Then his Beta wife died 2 and a half years ago in a car crash that almost took their son Zeke as well. Tony and Obadiah were engaged 6 months later. The ink on her death certificate probably wasn’t even dry before Howard brought up this arrangement. (Though, it confirmed the suspicions Tony had regarding the man’s previous marriage, as Zeke had been born just 6 months after.)
In a split second, Steve slammed the Winter Soldier against the wall, one hand wrapped around his throat, lifting him off the ground. Barnes seemed unaffected, nonchalant, even though Steve was cutting off his airflow. “What have you done?” Steve growled, “Who sent you?”
“Yes, do it!” Eunhae exclaims. Then all the flight attendants start chanting and Tony relents. He glances back towards Rhodey and finds him passed out on the couch. A small part of Tony is glad; it would be a little weird for the man he considered a brother to watch him perform a pole dancing routine.
Tony gets his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and gets pregnant again about a year later. This pregnancy is also kept a secret from the public, Obie citing the same reason of stock prices except now it’s applicable. He prays for an Alpha son, fearing Obie’s actions should he not produce an Alpha heir for him.
“The 15-mile hike to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described as a descent into hell, into a modern-day Heart of Darkness. Simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages have been driven from their homes, displaced from their lands by warlords emboldened by a new-found power. Villagers have been forced to take shelter in whatever crude dwellings they can find in the ruins of other villages, or here in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant.”
Steve turned away from the body of Bucky Barnes to look at his lover’s corpse, dropping the bloody dagger on the ground next to it. Leaning down, he reached his hand out to close Tony’s eyes and mouth. Unsure of what else to do, Steve sat on the edge of the bed and took Tony’s hand. It was still warm. He gave it a squeeze, willing it to squeeze back. It didn’t. Steve sat there holding his dead lover’s hand with silent tears streaming down his face for as long as it took for Tony to grow cold, for as long as it took for it to really sink in that Tony was dead. Steve always knew there was a possibility that he would lose Tony like this, to death. It’s a hazard of their like of work (not that they exactly had the same line of work), but that didn’t stop it from causing Steve the worst pain he ever felt.
“Anyway, it’s nothing. It’s just a little snag. There’s an exposed wire under this device.” Tony twists and pulls out the current arc reactor in his chest and hands it to Pepper. “And it’s contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short.”
As much as his brain allows him to in this situation, Tony thinks about the people he is holding out for, both in life and in his refusal to build these terrorists a weapon of mass destruction. He thinks of his family. He thinks of Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy, but most of all he thinks of his sons. He thinks of his strong Zeke, his sweet Peter, his mischievous Harley, and his adorable Jamie. Tony’s holding on for them.
“You and dad said you’re gonna have a baby,” Zeke says matter-of-factly, having grown out of “Daddy” in the past year but thankfully not “Momma.”
Hello, the next chapter is finally up! At least two months is better than 6 months! When I tell you that I had been stuck at the last ~400 words of this for weeks, I am not kidding. Now, I have school and an internship, so I'm not sure when the next update is going to be. Especially since I usually waited until at least half of the next chapter was done before uploading, but whatever. I'm done trying to put this fic on a schedule. There is no schedule, just vibes.
Tony is exhausted. He can’t give up, for his family, for Yahya. But he can’t help but lose a bit of hope. He’s been walking for at least 3 days now, with breaks to rest and sleep in between, without any success. He was starting to feel as though he wouldn’t find anything in time. Then the impossible happens.
Tony can hear giggling coming from the other side of the workshop. It’s Peter. Though it has been three weeks since he came back, the young ones like to spend as much time in the workshop as possible. The only reason the others weren’t here was because Zeke was back in school and the youngest two were down for a nap.
“Impressive, you’ve upgraded your armor. I’ve made some upgrades of my own.” With that, the Alpha takes flight.
“No,” Tony says decisively, “I’ll deal with it. Rhodey, he’ll just be mad that you know before him. And Harley, let’s try not to lie to your father too much; he’ll figure it out. Thanks for trying, though, both of you.”
The elevator reached the 67th floor, and Steve marched towards Conference Room 38. Again, no one seemed to bat an eye at the supposed Avenger on their floor. Steve guessed that his alternate was a regular guest at the Tower.
“He says, ‘Welcome, Tony Stane, the most famous mass murderer in the history of America,’” the other captive translates as the other Alpha speaks, “He is honored. He wants you to build the missile. The Jericho missile that you demonstrated.”
“There was another captive there. He’s the one that performed surgery that saved my life in the cave. He helped me build this and the device that got me out of there. He sacrificed his life for mine. He helped me through my Heat, made sure our captors didn’t find out I was in one. It’s his.”
“Keep going! Higher!” Then the boots lose power and the rest of the suit follows, leaving Tony to descend to the ground screaming. “We iced up, JARVIS! Deploy flaps!”
“Well,” the agent butts in, “the doctors still say they would like to keep you overnight for inspection, for your and the baby’s sake. I know this is all very abrupt, but we have to address the whole situation tomorrow. There will be a press conference and SHIELD will give you an alibi. Colonel Rhodes has also graciously stepped up to take part. I believe he is waiting outside with your sons and your friend Happy. I will leave you to it.”
However, Mr. Bassett is a bitter, bigoted old man, in every shape and form. He is racist, homophobic, xenophobic, basically any and every type of horrible a person could be. And
“Alright, alright,” Tony relents, “The truth is I don’t have a fucking clue. Or at least I didn’t until those bastards had me. I don’t know how they got them, but they had a lot of them. I already hated making weapons Rhodey, you know that, but knowing that literal terrorists have them makes that even worse. I need to find out how the Ten Rings got their hands on Stark weaponry. After that, I’m going to figure out a way to get Stark Industries out of the weapons industry entirely.”
So I lied. 2/3 of the second chapter was also done, so I just finished that and decided to post. I won't be able to post for at least a week and a half after that. I'm in my finals week right now which sucks, but it will be over soon.
Thankfully, the man only seems amused at that. “Yup. How was his reaction before I came? I missed that part, obviously.”
In the limo, Tony is visibly tense, nervous about what will come. Obadiah puts a hand on Tony’s knee. Tony stays tense.
Tony and Pepper turn towards the child’s voice, this time belonging to Harley. Harley is doodling in his coloring book while Peter is playing a game of fetch with Dum-E, and both are in the sectioned off play area Tony made for his kids. Jamie is taking a nap in his playpen. Since coming back, Tony’s children have been rather adamant that they stay by Tony’s side as much as possible. Zeke would’ve been here as well if Tony hadn’t nagged the teenager into doing some homework this weekend if only to placate Obie about the Beta missing a couple of days of school.
