As she took a deep breath, Toni told herself to calm down. She tried to focus her mind on something else, because she didn't want to think about her father and her lonely childhood, a childhood that still gave her nightmares.
After hiding the flash drive, Steve allowed himself to be dragged off by Rumlow and the Strike team. Dragged might be too strong of a world but that was what it felt like to the Captain. It didn't feel like he had a choice, and he didn't have a choice. Rumlow—though he would fail—would have dragged him in. There was a reason why he and the rest of the gang was in combat gear, and considering they were collecting him, that didn't bode well. What did that mean?
Toni had wondered before if her father had never paid any attention to her due to the fact that she was a woman and not a legacy that he wanted. Now, she knew that wasn't true. It was clear that she was enough for him. "Who said you were a horrible father?" she asked.
Making her way toward the kitchen, she could smell the food, which made her stomach growl more. She knew the smell of Pepper's food, having eaten it for years. Sure, Toni could cook as she had to fend for herself since she was a small child, but Pepper was always the better cook. She didn't know what Pepper did to her food, but she could morph it in something, something more than food. Toni smiled as the door to kitchen came into sight.
Steve hated when she got like this, so negative and insecure, but he supposed it was his fault for leaving her alone for so long. "Trust me, there isn't," he said, putting on smile. His eyes wandered up her form again, stopping at the dog tags which laid over her shirt. As she usually had them hidden under her shirt and close to her heart, he could guess that she had been recently holding them.
I meant to have this out sooner, but My beta and mine emails got lost in a black hole. haha. It is all good now.
Steve's eyes froze on Thor, trying to figure him out. Thor's very being threw the super soldier off, as most believed him to be a god; however, there was only one God that Steve believed in. Thor's existence would not spread doubt in him, but it was hard not to be insult by the fake god. This was what people considered a god? How could anyone pray to someone like that?
Sam let out a chuckle. "Better be careful, Rogers. You may end up sleeping on the couch for a month."
"No buts," Steve said, cutting her off as he smiled at her. "Now, let's me get this off," he said, pulling at her sport bra.
Rumlow would call Pierce cocky, but he knew better then to voice it, especially when the man was in a 'killing' mood. He couldn't quite understand the reasoning. What set this man off? Should he be worried? "I'll send the Asset after Fury and Rogers before collecting Stark myself." It didn't look like it, but Pierce was itching to pull the trigger.
His tried to think of the other avengers as he tried to clear from his mind. Banner had basically locked himself in one of the many labs in Stark's Tower (Steve knew it annoyed Toni when they refer to it as the Avenger's Tower). Romanoff and Barton were off trying to trace those devices that were stolen from Black Hawk as they could have something to do with Toni's disappearance. Director Fury had some of his SHIELD Scientist and agents looking for some way to get Toni back. Each of them were coming up with nothing.
Toni glanced at the snickering man before turning to Fury. "Okay, so Rogers and I kissed, so what? It wasn't the make-out session that I wanted, but there's next time." She spun to Steve and winked. Again, her hands were twitching at her side, itching to reach for him.
Toni was sending him the death glare to end all death glare. He was doing this just to piss her, and it didn't help that she was already pissed. "You just want it," she stated as she struggled in his arms.
"Mute," She replied, not interested in listening to JARVIS. Sometimes—No, most of the time, her AI seemed to develop a parenting tone, and Toni had no idea of where he gained it from, as she didn't program him that way. "I'm going to the lab." If she wasn't able to sleep, she might as well get some work done. She had to work on the Mark 42.
Pepper, who was the slowest of the four, was the first to arrive as the other had allowed her to. They weren't going to fight her mothering instinct, and she was the only one who truly understood what was going on. "Shit," she cursed as the lab doors came into view. The painted glass doors had been replaced.
"Tell Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes, the truth," she says, monotone. "Your pain is not worth it."
"What?" Toni asked shocked. She reached for the bag to find her muddy and holy clothes that she had been wearing when she first arrived. Her cell phone, to her surprise, was also in the bag. I wasn't expecting to see this again, she thought. Her unnamed device was not in the bag, which pissed her off. "Why are you letting me go? And where is my device?"
Giving Toni a look, Natasha released Toni's hand. "Better be careful. You don't want to make Rogers jealous."
Spector's glance soften as he looked at her. "I don't know how he knew it would turn out like this," he replied, as if he was reading her mind. "But I think you should read whatever is in that letter."
"And how's the device in your chest?" He asked as he forced his eyes to anywhere that wasn't Toni's chest.
He gave her a look, clearly not happy with her tone. His grip on her hand tightened, but he turned to Zola.
That scared the genius. It really did. She never had someone like Steve, who was willing to do anything for her. What if she screwed this? No, she would screw this up, because that was who she was. "Let's go before they break through the door."
"Chicken," she called herself. She took another deep breath as pulled down her shirt to stare at her chest. Her Arc Reactor wasn't as bright as it was supposed to be, which scared the shit out of her, and she had none of the proper tools to fix it. Even in the cave, she had resources, but here, there was nothing. Did the tools she need even exist here? She could die if she didn't get to that device in time. "How much time do I have?" she asked herself. She would have to keep an eye on it and hope she would get to her device in time.
some paid time off until Pepper came back…though Pepper would kill her for that. However, everyone else in the company would be happy. Who wouldn't want time off during this time of year? Everyone would love her for that, and who wouldn't want that? However, she didn't want them to love her just because she gave them paid time off. She wanted them to love her for being awesome.
She took the bag from her back and set it on the table. After she packed up the unnamed device, she heard someone behind her. She internally cursed as she turned around; however, she cursed loudly when she saw a gun trained on her. After getting her annoyance and anger under control, she spoke, "Hello, Agent Carter. It has been a long time." She put on the biggest smile that she could muster.
Before anyone could answer in the room, the door to the theater opened and someone walked in. "It's what roommates do when one of them is having sex," Rhodes stated, eyeing the room. "I've seen quite a few ties on doors." After scanning the room, his eyes fell on the sleeping Toni.
Toni's heart raced as she recognized the man from the bar and her heart beat even faster when her mind registered that it was the same man from the alley. He was the man, who was haunting her dreams, and to make matters worse, he had a knife in his hand.
Toni closed the file harshly as her hands shook. Perhaps her father had been correct about not knowing, because knowing was horrible. Barnes' fall kept repeating in her head as she thought about what he might have had been feeling when he knew he was falling to his inevitable death. What had went through his mind?
Barton broke out into laugher. "Oh, if we're selling sex types, I better get some profit out of this. Avenger Porn would be hot."
. So many things screaming at her at once, clawing at her. With tears forms, she buried her face in her lap, as she tried to force everything out. "Just stop," she uttered, feeling sick.
I will note that i struggled a bit in this chapter with Toni, because I didn't want it to look like "OH, look how weak she is." However, she is separated from her suit, so it isn't like she can take on an army. Besides, Hydra's plan has worked. She is a bit insane...She is not working at her best level.
With a shaky hand, Toni reached forward, grabbing his arm. Steve could feel how cold and shaky she was, and it only worried him more. "Toni," he uttered again as she lifted his arm up. Steve eyed her as she held it up and ducked under it. Once she was flat against his chest, she dropped his arm and pressed her face into his chest. "Toni," he uttered again, wrapping his arms around her.
Toni exhaled harshly as she glared at him. "I'm not being emotional," she said through clenched teeth, though knowing that she was. However, she knew this was for the best, even if her emotions were running wild. She didn't belong here.
He turned back to her ever so slowly with a look that could cut right through a brick wall. "Do I need to torture you again? I promise this time would be worse than the last."
The Asset followed the Brunette, keeping track of everywhere he went. He watched her at every movement, reporting every move and thing that she made. He, however, did not report the itch that he got whenever he saw the brunette with the beefy Blonde, and he definitely didn't report the urge to strange the man whenever he touched the woman. Again, the Asset had no idea why he felt like this, considering he had no idea of who the woman was. He had never seen this woman —not that he remembered—before this assignment, but yet, there was this feeling in his chest. A feeling he didn't understand.
Toni didn't want to think anything of it, as JARVIS would alert her if something was truly out there, not that there could. JARVIS was the
Tony almost jumps, though he'll never admit that to anyone. "Tasha," he utters as he turns his head slightly to the left to look at the master Spy. She's sitting crossed legged in the chair with her head resting on her hand. "Come to tuck me in? Here to play nurse? I would ask that you to put on the uniform but I expect you to skin me alive if I do."
Toni kept back her growl as she held the letter tightly in her hand. On one hand, she knew she should go back to the tower, as there were some questions that she needed to answer and have answered. Plus, there was no doubt that the team was worried. On the other hand, she had no interest in facing anyone. She wanted to hide in her lab, though she kept telling herself that she had to face it. Even if it pained her, her father was right. "Where's Steve?" she asked, not wanting to see him at all.
She wasn't sure if it was because her mind wouldn't shut off, and even before the nightmares, it never shut off. She would wake up every few hours with some new idea that she couldn't get off her mind, and she couldn't get back to sleep until it was completed. If she was honest with herself which she rarely was, there was another reason why she couldn't sleep. It was her doubt and loneliness. Sure, she had Pepper, Happy, and Rhodey, but they weren't always enough, and when they left as they always did, she was alone. Painfully alone. It hard to go to sleep when there was no one wake up to. No one to hold her when she needed it.
Steve put a hand on her shoulder, stopping her before she could say anything stupid. "She isn't an asset, and Fury would be stupid to think of her as one," he said, coldly. "Why don't you three go to the quinnjet? I need a moment with Toni."
She gawked at him, not sure what to make of it. He couldn't be her stalker as there were a few times that she felt eyes on her and he was with her. "It isn't you," she stated.
His bitterness was short lived when Toni suddenly poked Banner with the object that she was holding. Banner's yelp of pain angered Steve and it pulled him into the room. How could she be so stupid?
Toni narrowed her eyes at him. "You watched National Treasure, didn't you? Is that what you did when I was gone? If so, you need a life!" she said, looking back to the helicopter tapping down. "You're supposed to party when mom's away."
For a while, Toni just stood there in front of her parent graves, unmoving. Even with the jest about children, her father's letter shook her to the core, and she couldn't stop trembling. How could he say all of those things? He really loved her? He was proud of her? Believed in her? To know her father thought all of those things meant everything to her. "Geez, old man," she said, softly. "Still getting to me." He had broken through her shield.
"That sounds cool," she said, trying to start up a conversion. She could only take so much silence. "Can I see some of your work?" She had never seen Rogers' work as he was very guarded with it. She had asked a few times, which only resulted in him glaring at her and asking why she even cared.
Toni stuck her tongue at him. "Well everything is an offensive," she said. "Just look at that color on you." She waved at the purple outfit that Clint was wearing. She could never understand the purple, especially since he was a goddamn spy. Spies weren't supposed to be colorful.
The Doctor reached into his bag and pulled out a gauze and medical type. "Hold still." Finding some burn cream, he applied it to her skin before wrapping her arm in the white gauze. After making sure it was typed properly, he let go of her arm, stood, and headed to the door. "Just keep it dry for a few days."
Virginia "Pepper" Potts walked in, wearing a silver top and a lace pencil skirt. Pepper could always pull off the pencil skirt, unlike her. Toni couldn't really pull off the girly look, which was why she stuck to jeans and t-shirts. "Are you okay?" she asked as she noticed Toni's badly wrapped hand.
Toni felt like an idiot for what happened in the bar, but she wasn't going to apologize. It wasn't her style, and it was the truth. She just wanted them to leave her alone. Why was that so hard? Why were they pushing so hard? Why couldn't they leave her alone? She wasn't speaking in French or anything. She just didn't want to talk about her feelings.
"I'm fine," she muttered. "You don't need to call anyone. I got this." She didn't want him to call anyone, because she didn't need anyone. She was fine on her own as she would always be.
"Yea, because her mind won't stop," Bruce replied. "Her brain is always moving, always thinking." He had a weak smile on his face. "It's that brilliant mind of hers."
Unable to look at the details, he flipped to another file which was of Colonel Phillips- also deceased. It was a blow to his heart to see so many of his comrades dead. Again unable to look, he flipped to see Peggy and to his joy, she was still alive and living in England. There was a number listed for her, and for a second, he wanted to call her, but he couldn't do that to her. She had gotten over his death and he was going to allow her that peace.
Confused, Pepper stared at him for a second, wondering what was going on. "What are you talking about? What about the Mark 7?"
Toni glanced up at Colonel Phillips, who was staring at her. Her eyes drifted to the metal suitcase that was handcuffed to his left hand, knowing what was in the case. She also knew that he was going to hold onto it until the very last second. "What's up, Colonel?" she asked with no interest in referring to him as Salty anymore. Sure, the nickname started out of annoyance, but it grew into fondness, which was now gone.
Phillips turned his attention back to Toni, who had started to pick at her cast. He could see in the muscles in her mind work as she stared blankly at the one-way mirror. "Where did the Doctor go?"
"Just say it already," Toni said, preparing for the worst. There was a part of her that wondered what would happen if her father knew the truth.
When Savin was final upright, there was a large, bright (No, really bright) smile on his face, and he didn't look unhappy in the least. He looked glad that Harley blasted him and got away, which was strange. What was his end game? "You're so much trouble, Doll Face." he said.
Shaking her head, Toni shoved the covers back and kicked her feet over the edge. "Damn it," she cursed, closing her eyes for a second. "I guess I better get up," she muttered to herself. Her body protested as she got to feet, placing weight on her legs. "Never too early to start my day," she said, trying to put on a smile. She wobbled as she slipped on her slippers and turned to the door with one thing on her mind. If she was going to be awake at this time, coffee was needed. A lot of coffee.
Toni rolled over her eyes as she sauntered over to the fancy car. Like she was eyeing a piece of meat, she ogled the car, resisting the urge to lick her lips. What? She loved a good car. "O ye, of little faith," she says, leaning into the window. "I'm not going to follow you, granted I might steal this car."
With a deep breath, she rounded the corner and stepped into the garage. Though she was very much a car woman and the sight of her babies brought a smile to her face, she saw her vehicles as nothing more than an escape. While not bothering to change or fix her blouse, she grabbed the keys to the nearest car- a two door, white Audi-, and hopped in. "JARVIS, once the Mark 7 arrives in New York, please reroute it my location."
"And do you think she'll return it?" Steve asked as he got up and slowly crossed to the long panel of windows. He stared down at the crowd as he thought about their lives. They were the lucky ones; they had no idea of what was going on. They had no idea that Toni Stark was missing. They had no idea of how much danger they were in.
At the moment, Toni was sitting at a base of a tree on the edge of the camp. In her hands was a stretch book, which she was using to stretch possible ideas for getting back to her time. She had a few ideas, but she had no idea if any of these ideas would work. All she knew was that she would destroy her stupid device as soon as she got home. She was going to take a few tons of c4 to it.
She really hated to be handled things, but Steve wouldn't listen. She glared at the glass before grabbing it out of his hands. "Thanks," she muttered, annoyed. As their fingers touched, she felt her heart skip and her annoyance die.
Clint narrowed his eyes at Toni before stealing one of the glasses from the table. He ignored the glare from Steve. "I can't wait until you cry, Stark. Don't worry I will take video and post it on YouTube."
As good as that sounded, Steve didn't believe that was the case. Something felt off; maybe, it was the message that she left him earlier. It sounded like she had reached the end of her ropes and was ready to throw in the towel, which worried him more. That wasn't Toni, but she hadn't been herself in some time. She hadn't been sleeping, forcing herself to bed with sleeping pills, and now, she was blaming herself for everything. Even if she couldn't stop it, every death was her fault. Combining everything, it was a recipe for something horrible. "Let's search the surrounding area. She might still be here." He replied, not wanting to talk about what was going on in his head with Clint.
Toni shifted slightly, reaching for the letter on the ground. She brought it to her chest before she leaned back into Steve's chest. "If it isn't my fault, it isn't your fault either," she said finally after a few long minutes.
"Toni," he called, as he got to his feet, following after her. "Stop! Please. Talk to me. This isn't good for you to keep it in." The panic in his voice grew with each step that Toni took from her Best Friend, while concern took over his expression. "Stop."
was not a traitor, even if her commanding officer was telling her so. "With all due respect, if SHIELD is conducting a manhunt for Captain America, we deserve to know why," she demanded, thinking back to the look on Steve's face when he asked her where Toni was. He was worried, and that hit her harder than he expected. He didn't trust SHIELD. He didn't trust that they wouldn't hurt her.
Bruce took a deep breath. "…I don't want to get involved in…whatever happened down in the lab, but we all need to take a deep breath and step back. Clearly, Toni isn't herself at the moment. I don't know what it is, but there's something weighing on her."
Ignoring her gut, she rested her head against his warm chest, but listening to her inner self, she kept her eyes open, even if it was a fight. "Thanks."
"Are you okay?" She asked, annoyed. Her arms strung from the cuts, but they wasn't as painful as the bruise on her face.
However, it was at that moment that Natasha and Clint stepped into the room. With hand on Natasha's shoulder to guide him, the Archer covered his eyes with the other. "Is it clear? Are they dressed?"
She brought her hand to her face in disbelieve. "I don't know. By the way you entered the room and the loud music coming from the lab? She doesn't play this shit loud unless she's upset."
"Toni." Peggy called again. She seemed unfazed by Toni's taunts. "You aren't thinking clearly. You need to rest."
Toni flashed before Steve's eyes, her exhausted self haunted him. It worried—destroyed him, seeing her so broken. It scared him because at times, he didn't believe she would recover from it. Everyone saw ghosts at times, especially if they had gone through as much as she had. That wasn't strange. It would be odd if you didn't, but this was different. Though Steve may not fully understand what Toni was feeling, Barnes was real for Toni. How did Steve help with that? He was also haunted by Bucky. He had his own issues to overcome.
Steve paused, closing his eyes, and took a deep breath. He was a gentleman, and he hated to see any dame in pain. Just by touching her, he could see that she was in extreme pain, and there was nothing he could've done for her a part from getting help.
Toni, even at the point of sheer exhaustion, struggled in her bindings as his very voice was annoying the hell out of her, and she couldn't fucken take it anymore. She couldn't understand why he thought talking to her would change her mind. Maybe, he thought talking to her would work better than torture, and…it might. His voice was so much worse, and his 'I am mightier then you' tone was pissing her off. Beside the fact that she was the only one who could use that tone, how could he talk to anyone like that? He wasn't a god. He was nothing.
Toni sat there a few seconds, taking in the heat from his hand. Steve always seemed to run hot, which was something she needed right then. "I'm fine, just annoyed that he forced me out of the suit with that device." She replied with a light smile. "He won't get lucky next time."
Unable to stop herself, Toni let out a loud chuckle, even though her throat was sore and dry. It hurt to laugh, but she didn't care. "Oh, you're worried now?" she asked, not even bothering to correct them about the nonexistence baby. Let them be idiots. "Why don't you go plant some daisies or something?"
"Crap Science," Tony mutters as he tries to be as small as he can. "Dinosaurs don't look like that."
Phillips stepped away from the table and walked to the door in silence. As he reached the door, he turned around and spoke, "You cannot judge a person when she knows you're watching. It's when she thinks no one is watching that you judge. We'll see who she is then."
"—and she just makes you want to knock her the out with that mouth of hers. She just likes to listen to herself speak—ear bleeding rants, but that," the assassin hissed, "is
Toni couldn't stop the snort rising from her throat. Maybe, her lack of sleep was getting to her, but all sense of logical and reason were out the door, and like any drunk after a few drinks, she didn't care about consequences. Granted, her sense of judgement wasn't at operating at its best and she wasn't thinking things through. With her anger boiling, she didn't care. She wanted to fly into SHIELD's headquarters and blowing things up.
The angry voice started a mere second after Toni got back to Steve's shitty apartment. Before she could jump in the shower to get this paint off her, it hounded her. It was like the ceiling was falling down on her, crashing her.
As if his advice was for her, Toni took a few deep breaths, racking her brain for the right thing to say. In these situations, she never knew what to say and always had the habit of saying the wrong thing. Steve could attest to that as could…Bucky.
her. Where was he? Breathing heavily, she pulled away and glanced up at Steve, who looked –for lack of a better word- hungry. "Where's Bucky?"
It has been awhile. I have been suck on this chapter for awhile, which is why i kept switching to my other Story.
Toni eyed Barnes, wondering if he was this flirtatious with all women or just her. Well, she was pretty different from the women of this time. For one, there was no way in hell that she would ever back down and listen to a man (or anyone), and she refused to let culture roles of this time rule her. She knew that would attract some man to her (as well as turn some away). "I'm really out of your league, Barnes," she stated with a smile.
The Gangster-want-a-be looked up at her, his eyes narrowing. He didn't answer as if he didn't know how to speak, or maybe he didn't know what to say. It was possible that he didn't know who she was, as the lighting was anything but decent. There were barely any light, too dark to make out any features, so it was possible.
Toni's head was fuzzy and she couldn't make out heads or tails of what was going on. She could tell they were on the move but all she could hear was distant voices, and there were a lot of voices, most of them were unknown to her. At first it scared her, not knowing who these voices belonged to, but she heard a familiar man's voice. His voice calmed her and she knew she was safe. She didn't know what about his voice calmed her, but it did. So the more he talked, the better. While resting in someone's arms listening to him (she wasn't sure if it was him holding her), she allowed herself to drift. As she rested, her mind was becoming less fuzzy, and she was able to make out what was going on around her.
Toni gave Steve a look from the corner of her eyes, studying the expression on his face. Steve was weird when it came to PDA. He wasn't ashamed of it, holding her hand and giving her breath-taking kisses in public, but he didn't like to be flashy, showing off to show off. He had no issue with teasing Barton with it, but he got red in the face when someone else sees him, like he was caught stealing cookies. "Yup," she said. "Ready to go."
If it was possible for JARVIS to laugh, Toni had no doubt that the AI would be laughing. "If seems like I am, Miss. A tune up might be needed."
Toni narrowed her eyes. "Honey, I can talk my way out of anything." She didn't know what it was, but her ego wouldn't let her shut up.
she told herself. She kept flinching every time she saw movement, which could be attributed to a few things and not her stalker.
Everything was happening so fast that Toni was having a difficult time keeping up with everything. All she knew was that when Madame Hydra tried to get to her and Steve was there to stop the crazy commander. Toni had always been wowed by his strength, but to see him fight her off and chase her away was something else, and she didn't know what to make of it.
The man didn't response, though Toni knew he knew English. He, a silence bear, grabbed her by her arm and pulled her up. Carefully as not to drop her phone, she allowed him to pull her up, not that she could stop him. Being a super soldier like Steve, there was nothing she could do without her suit. He could carry her around like a rag doll, and though she found that sexy when Steve did it, she didn't get the same enjoyment from this man. "Fuck you," she hissed, as she sung the knife forward.
She was going to fly the suit back and check out the camp for herself. She needed to see that her device was destroyed for herself before she would let herself rest. "Thanks, JARVIS." She slowly pushed herself up with a deep sigh.
He looked up at her and weakly smiled. "I don't know. It would be pointless." He looked so defeated. "I think I might give up."
This is where we find our favorite genius now, preparing the OR to receive Barnes and install the new upgraded hardware. He gingerly placed each mechanism and part down in precise order on a steel table next to the operating station. He was going over the physical procedure in his mind as he mentally catalogued all of the parts over and over again.
Steve startled at the sudden memory, his entire body involuntarily pulsed in shock and he had emitted an almost inaudible yelp. He soothed Ellie absentmindedly. She stirred as he desperately tried to cling to the memory.
want to know about your sex life. And lazy, really? You should be ashamed of yourself. You should take another lap." Gesturing at Steve, he hesitated for a moment before saying sarcastically, "Did you just take it? I assumed you just took it."
The man cracked a smile before holding at his hand and saying, "Sam Wilson. There. Not a stranger anymore."
"Don't Toni me," she demanded. "Why are you here?" She didn't want to talk to him. She had other things that she could be doing instead of wasting her time talking to him, especially when he betrayed her to Colonel Salty. Yes, she knew everything turned out well as she was closer in fix that damn device, but he was the reason why she was in a damn cell for a month. For the longest time, her voice was the only voice she heard, and it was annoying.
With a sigh, he reached for the lump, harshly grabbing the woman's small arm. It was crueler than he intended but the idea of a foreign woman in his bed didn't sit well with him. He didn-
Bruce looked long and hard at Steve. "Really? You're a super Soldier, I turn into a big green beast when I'm angry, and we're friends with a demi-god. And you stop at time travel? We aren't strangers to portals. Time travel would work along the same idea." He huffed in annoyance.
"What the hell?" Toni asked, annoyed, as she pushed out of Steve's arms. "Can't a girl get some action?" Her eye was twitching as she eyed the scene in from of her. "Who…" The words died in her throated as she eyed the guy on the ground with a camera around his neck. She folded her arms crossed her chest and left out a puff. "Really? Here? I swear these guys are like mosquitos."
Shockingly, a protective look formed in Sharon's eyes. "If you're referring to what happened last night, you aren't broken. You aren't a burden." She paused for a second as she took a step back. "You're human, and when we've seen what we've seen, it's impossible to come out unscarred. And there's nothing wrong with that. It just means you deserve your happy ending just like everyone else."
Trying not to look at him, she stared at the sidewalk in front of her. The bag was starting to get heavy and it made it awkward to walk. "It's coming back slowly." She was annoyed at herself for that lie. It was stupid and it was hard to believe anyone fell for it. Out of the corner of her eyes, she eyed him. "It's…weird."
"We need to talk," he said, still not letting her arm go. "Can we talk?" he asked softly, almost as if he was scared. He eyed her, as if she was going to break.
It came at her all at once and she couldn't think without getting an extreme headache. There also seemed to be a raise in temperature, making Toni sweat. To make matters worse, she wasn't able to catch her breaths no matter how hard she tried. It felt like there was something or someone sitting on her chest, not allowing her to. With everything adding on, Toni's head felt like it was in a fog and she wasn't able to think clearly. However, there was one thing that she could make out: she was scared.
"Witnesses!" He yelled as he limped to the containment room. The core was still glowing as brightly as it had been before he messed it. "We have witnesses."
Having been close with Peggy (close enough to call her Aunt Peg), Toni had met the famous Sharon on more than one occasion. Even when she wasn't there, Peggy could go on and on about her wonderful niece. Whenever Sharon was in town, she would tag along with Peggy, and to Toni's annoyance, this included visits to see Howard and her. Now, Peggy and Howard thought they could force them together, thinking it would be adorable if they were friends. However, they hated each other, seeing the other as a spoil brat who needed a good punch in the face. "What you are going here?"
"Understood," Rumlow responded, as he held back his sigh. He didn't like the idea of rushing into their plan, but there was no stopping them now. Everything was falling into place.
Barnes takes the plates, but he doesn't take it upstairs. He harshly dumps it in the trash as he heads upstairs, and he doesn't turn back when he leaves. He doesn't see the pain written on Tony's face when he returns to whatever he was working on. He doesn't see the pain in his back as Tony hunches over his desk. Barnes doesn't see any of this.
"Never piss off the doctor. Never know what I might stick you with," Cho replies, as she scans him with one of her medical devices. "And it doesn't hurt that Natasha is standing guard. No one wants to piss her off. I mean no one… Are the rumors true about her?" she asks, giving him a look. She's being serious.
The door to the room started to open, silencing the loud genius. Mr. Salty walked in with an expression that someone just farted in his face, which made Toni chuckle. "Sound something smelly?" she asked with an annoying smile on her face. "Or that could be just your normal face!"
As if her words angered him, he crossed to her quickly grabbed her chin again. He forced her face up as he forced her mouth open. "I like your tongue so much that I want it," he said.
Was Toni supposed to be impressed? If so, she wasn't. Not at all. Granted that could be because Killian rubbed her the wrong way, though she could do it better herself. No, that wasn't her ego… or maybe it was. "So?" she asked.
Loki, still wearing the same ratty thing as before, stood and stepped to the bed. "I was going to say favorite toy." His fingers traced the edge of the bed.
Steve gently places his hands on Tony's face, caressing his cheek. "Tony, we wouldn't say it unless we meant," he says. "Trust me. I promise you that. We love you, and that will never change."
"Don't let Stark hear you say that. She might get jealous," she replied with a hint of a smile, which resulted in a glare from Steve. "Anyhow, going after him is a dead end. I know, I've tried. Like you said, he's a ghost."
"No, you aren't," he said firmly as he lifted his head to look at her, but she didn't meet his glance. "Look at me."
"Did he?" he asked again, as he stepped to her. He pulled her toward him, and after a bit of struggling, he had her in his arms. It was clear that he wasn't going to let her go. "Tell me." He was angry, but she wasn't sure if he was angry at her or the stalker.
"Who is this he?" Rogers asked, as he eyed the two. There was something in his tone that Toni couldn't read.
The asshole struggled to get to his feet. "That wasn't very nice. Someone should teach you matters. I would be happy to do so." He stepped to her, too close for Toni's liking, but she did not move. She stared him down. "You have some balls."
Steve reached out to grab Toni's elbow, but he dropped him hands when he was inches from her. "You're still having nightmares, Toni?" His voice was soft, comforting, and it pulled her in.
"I needed some air, and running clears my head," he said, looking forward. He had a goofy smile on his face that could make anyone smile, including Toni.
Toni's eye brow rose. Was he really flirting with her? If so, it isn't didn't compute, as his smile didn't match the look in his eyes. Besides, no chance in hell that she would date him. "Captain Rogers knows that I am queen, trust me. He knows and worships me. No, no, I'm just calling you fat. I know a few gyms that I can point in the direction of."
"You know you can tell me the truth, right?" he asked as he looked around. "If someone's bothering you, you can tell me." Barnes had protective look in his eyes that Toni didn't understand. "I can take care of him for you."
Steve gave in and held Toni tighter, refusing to let her ago. "No, I do. I see him everywhere too," he admitted. "I have nightmares too, Toni. I wake up in cold sweats with him and everyone else I couldn't save."
His name really did inspire people to follow him, didn't it? Steve wasn't sure how he felt about that at this moment. "Where can we get our hands on one of these things?"
replace her with. She ignored the ping in her heart every time she joked about it, because she refused to acknowledge that it hurt to think of him with someone else. Besides, it wasn't like there was a person…well that she knew of. Maybe, there was, and if there was, Toni wouldn't blame him. She was a handle full, a horrible partner. Maybe, the media was right. Maybe, he should listen to them.
Shaking her head, she looked around, trying to keep herself awake. She wasn't looking for anything, but she caught sight of something moving along the tents. Its movement reminded her of her stalker, but it couldn't be. He couldn't be here in camp in the middle of nowhere. How could he be? How could he have found her? What did he want? She shook her head as she tried to clear her mind. He couldn't be here. She had to be going crazy. It had to be the lack of sleep... Unless, Salty was lying about this stalker not being one of his and he had him watching her while he was gone. But that didn't make any sense. But maybe, it did.
Banner glanced up from the monitor and looked toward Steve, who was glaring at the monitor. "You okay?"
Still fighting, Toni closed her eyes and pounded her hands against his chest. "Please, Steve," she cried out. "Please." Her voice was heartbreaking. "W-who the hell called you?!" She paused for a second, anger growing. "W-why did JARVIS call y-you?" She let out hard, loud sob. "I'm not weak. I-I'm not seeing t-things!" She was shaking as she bawled. "N-not weak. Not pathetic."
Did someone turn up the temperature? Someone must've turned the heat up, as it felt like it was burning in this room all of the sudden. She felt like she was in hell. Her hands felt wet and sticky as she balled them at her side. Her breaths were shadowed and uneven, and she found herself struggling to breathe. Toni felt herself fall back down on the couch as the room started to spin. She tried to catch her breath before anyone noticed her small panic…not that this was a panic attack. This was nothing. Just her thinking. Overthinking like she always did. That was all it was. Toni did not have pan-
"Won't work," he mutters to himself. He doesn't want to be a second choice. Can't be. It will hurt, and he doesn't want to be second place—well, that's given in any field as he's a Stark, but he doesn't want that in a relationship. He doesn't want someone to 'settle' for him. He wants to be the one and only, and he can't be that with Rogers. Barnes, even when he was gone-dead to the world, is the most important person to Rogers, and there's no completing with a dead guy. He will always pick Barnes no matter what, and Tony isn't a fool. He isn't going to lie to himself and say it's any different.
? Was it a few weeks ago before he left? Was she really peacefully sleeping now? Steve couldn't be sure.
Toni pulled back slightly as she lowered her head to take a look at the tree. Her eyes widened a bit before narrowing. In front of her was a bare Christmas tree that stood over eight feet with a pretty wide radius, nearly 5 feet. It was the perfect tree with thick branches, leaving no open spots. "It's real," she said, taking in the strong pine smell.
The room broke out in laugher as the tissue and wrapping paper went everywhere—not that it wasn't everywhere already. However, it was now down her shirt, in her hair and in her mouth. IT WAS IN HER bra. She was pretty sure it was in her pants. Yes, her pants, but no one was looking own there. For a few long seconds, she just blinked as she didn't believe what had just happened, even as if itching.
"No matter what lies Erskine told you, you see I was his greatest success!" Schmidt yelled as the rafters were suddenly pulled a part, separating the two from each other. It wasn't the rafters that startled Steve and Bucky, it was Schmidt, who had peeled off his skin on his face to reveal his red skull.
How would she know? And why would she care? They aren't friends, and she blames him for her parent's death, which he guess is his fault. His weapons and all. Plus, he's at fault for her brother's death, and for that, he hates himself. Why does everything he touches go to hell? Why is he such an idiot? Why didn't he leave well enough alone? Maybe, he deserves this for causing so much pain. Maybe, this is his punishment for the pain that he has caused. Maybe, Maximoff wants him dead, and he doesn't blame her.
"You wouldn't mind me asking what's up," Barnes asked as he stopped at a turn. He glanced back at her before gradually looking round a corner. Seeing no one coming, he waved her on.
and he had to protect her. If he had to leave to protect her, he would. It didn't matter if he wanted to take her into his arms and run off. He had to protect her from Rumlow.
"Project Insight requires insight. So, I wrote an algorithm," Zola continued on. "And Stark has a part to play in it."
"Don't make me hurt you." Toni glanced down at her feet before looking over her should. "And you don't need to hoover." Why did people keep calling her a dame? She hated that word.
She tried to fit the broken glass back into the frame, though it was pointless. He would surely notice…though he would probably say it was nothing even if it was. It was something he did just to avoid hurting her feelings. Again, that annoyed her. Why did he have to be so perfect?! "Why do you always lose your temper, Stark?" she asked herself, knowing that she wasn't perfect at all. Why was she jealous of Rogers? "Because…" Toni took a deep breath as she closed her eyes. He had everything. He had a loving family and the respect that she dreamt of. There was also the fact that he got the attention from her father that she always wanted. He was everything her father wanted, while she was nothing. He had a whole nation that loved him, while she had a whole nation that wanted to see her fail. How did he get to be so lucky?
Toni smirked. "I do. If anything does, I give you permission to alert the others." She knew even without permission that JARVIS would alert the orders.
Toni didn't have time to think or do anything as the wet cloth was placed over her face, and the bucket of cold water was dumped on her. She tried to scream as the ice water strung her burnt face, but nothing came out; instead, the water filled her mouth, choking her. This time, she thought she was going to die.
"You're in a recovery room in New York city," she stated with a smile. She was a pretty woman, but he wanted to see Toni.
"Geez, thanks," she replied as she glared at him. He was teasing and that wasn't allowed. That was her job. "So where's Rogers?" she asked, changing the subject.
Steve, who hands had left his ears, turned to Pepper, but she wasn't there. She had bolted out of the room, heading toward the lab. "Wait! What's going on? Is Toni in trouble?" He chased after Pepper, and he wasn't alone. Clint and Natasha had followed, knowing something had to be wrong.
With a laugher, Sam Wilson groaned, "Okay, get a room." Acting like child, he covered his eyes. "Shit! Why don't I have camera? I would get a pretty penny for a picture. The media will eat it up."
to talk to him, and after the serum, he was at war, so when did he have a chance to make out with anyone? Well…. There were the show girls when he was a chorus boy. Was Steve a bad chorus boy? How bad-
She was scared to use the device as it might stop her fading reactor, which could kill her. However, she had been preparing for her death for years. She never expected to live this long. She was supposed to have died years ago... and there was a part of her that wondered why she wasn't dead.
Not unexpectedly, the Brunette had pissed someone with that threat she made, and she had suffered the consequences because of it. If she was his, this wouldn't have happened, as he would have kept her safe and away from people who cause her harm. He would've kept her in line, kept her quiet. He would've controlled her, forced her to listen to reason unlike that useless Beefy Blond. Why did the Blond let her do such a stupid thing? Did he not understand why it was dangerous for her to do? Besides, why did the Brunette do that? Why was she so careless in giving out her location? Why was she so willing to go into battle? Did she like warfare like he did?
"It protects my heart," she answered, slowly. It was silent for a few minutes as no one spoke. Toni didn't want to say anything and Erskine was giving her time to think in case she did.
Though Toni was seeing stars, her fight response kicked into overdrive. Her hands flew to Barnes' hand on her throat. Her nails buried themselves into his skin, drawing blood, but Barnes didn't seem to feel it. It was like he was feeling nothing but hatred. His eyes drilled through her like she was nothing; her stomach twisted under his hot glaze. Being held a good foot above the ground, she swung both legs as hard as she could, which seemed to do more harm than good. It was like she was hitting a brick wall, and after a few kicks, she begun to wonder if she had broken something. "What do you want?" She groaned, trying to look anywhere but his face.
"There's not going to be a safe landing. But I can try and force it down," Steve said, his voice coming through the radio. It was a little hazy, but they could understand him.
Toni shook her head. "Why do you get into fights you can't win?" she asked. The future Rogers popped into her mind. It had appeared that nothing had changed, well beside the fact that he could win fights in the future. She felt him sigh in annoyance. She knew he must've been asked this question a lot and that he had been in a few fights with Bucky over it. He tried to pull away from her, but Toni wouldn't let him. She dropped the bag and held him. They both knew he wasn't going to fight her. "You had asked me to talk. Why can't I ask you to talk?" she asked.
Toni couldn't help but wonder if he was going this slowly just to kill her. She arched into him as he found a spot on her neck and sucked. Not that she wanted to, she was unable to stop the groan from escaping her lips as his right hand travel from her back to her chest and flickered his thumb over her nipple. "Oh, God, Steve," she moaned loudly. He smiled against her skin as he continued to caress her soft—even with the scars—skin. "H-hate to stop this…b-but c-can't we take this to the bed room. Bed sex is so m-much better for the b-back." She moaned again as his lips traveled to her collar bone, while one of his hand dipped into her pants.
She eyed him. Whenever he said nothing, there was something. His nothing rarely meant nothing. "Did Sassy tell you about my nightmares?" she asked. That woman told Barnes, so maybe she told Steve. Maybe, Toni should change Peggy's nickname to loud mouth.
He closed his eyes and held her even tighter, and he didn't move for quite some time. "Toni," he called, after a few minutes. "It's okay…" He paused. "Just don't leave."
But again, he's hiding in his lab for another reason, though some might say it's the same reason. But he will refuse that until he's blue in the face. He's not hiding from his emotions….even if it's the truth. He would rather they think he's hiding from Barnes, which the team believes without a second thought. It's common knowledge that the Winter Soldier had killed his father, and even if he did first, the genius doesn't hold anything against the former assassin now. He was brainwashed and all. Can't blame him, even if it was easy to.
"You don't need your tongue," he said, reaching the tool into Toni's mouth. The only thing she could do was try to move her tongue out of the way.
Toni's right eye twitched as she tried to put space between them, not that she could. The zip ties gave her very little room to move, only allowing a few inches, but no matter the distance, it would never be enough. She wasn't sure if it was because she wasn't comfortable with being this close to Maya when she was unable to defend herself, but man, she was sweating cats and dogs, and it wasn't because she felt ill. Or it was? She was feeling
Toni had a few options she could do, but she wasn't sure any of them would work. "No, I'm just a nurse," she stated, as she tried to look shaken up.
"Can't you feel this?" he asked, his hand traveling to her face. He gently traced her jaw line before cupping her face. "How can you say this isn't real?"
"Arrogance may not be a uniquely American trait, but I must say you do it better than anyone," Schmidt said, drawing Rogers' glance. "Did you think you can save her on your own?"
Trip's smile did not falter under Pepper's intense glare. "Not even I could keep up with Captain America. He was on a mission, and there was no chance we could've kept up with him."
She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. "You don't need to. I know why you did. You thought what you were doing was for the best. I would've done the same thing." It was true that she would've, but that didn't mean she had to like it.
Wanda doesn't look startled at his anger. "Why do you think so little of yourself?" she asks, sounding almost sad.
His words snapped her back to reality, and it took a few seconds for her to focus on the determined man in front of her. "I gave you the truth," she replied.
Tony's heart does a little flip, but he doesn't say anything. He can't help but feel like someone has slapped him across the face
He looked at her weird, hearing his last name out of her month. "He doesn't need to know," he stated as he unlocked the front door to the apartment.
a point, but Toni wasn't ready to reveal what they had yet. She wasn't ready to open this up to the world. She wanted to keep it between her and Steve, but it was impossible now. Now, everyone would be waiting for her to screw up as it would be her to do so. "Sorry, Pepper. Yes, I should've told you."
She held her right arm close to her body with her left hand as she walked up the steps to the apartment. She felt so weak that she wondered if she would ever succeed in getting back to her own time. How could she break into her father's company and steal back her device if she couldn't defend herself? How could she get past the guards like this?
Both Peggy and Erskine almost choked keeping back their laugher. "He's a Stark for you," Erskine smiled.
"Very well," JARVIS responded. The yellow lights were still flashing annoyingly, but the earsplitting alarms had died down, almost to a murmur.
"It's fine, Jim," Steve utters, desperation in his voice. "We got him. It's okay. Trust me, please."
"Have you been talking to Vision lately?" he asks, his eye twitching. "Talking to him behind my back? I feel betrayed! Betrayed!" Though he knows that Vision wants to help, he detests the idea of Vision and FRIDAY talking—if that's the correct word for it. Tony isn't sure that he considers it talking if they're only transmitting information, but it's all the same to him. They're talking behind his back, and it pisses him off. He doesn't like when people talk behind his back unless it's to say how awesome he is.
Her eye twitched at the word, father. "Am I going to get it back?" she asked annoyed. Why did he have to use the word father? Just thinking about Howard made her blood boil.
She wanted to sleep, but not want to dream. Not that they would be dreams. Nightmares, really. She knew that for sure, but how did you sleep without dreaming? She had long run out of her sleeping pills, and knowing how everyone liked to hover, she wouldn't be able to get more—not that she had anything to hide. Sleeping pills were normal, granted she knew how everyone else would see it. They would want to talk and try to explain that she didn't need them, but she did. Even while fighting Aldrich Killian and his idiots, she still saw Bucky. Still saw him look at her. Saw his face as he fell.
By the time Toni located Steve and the shooter, they were squaring off on an empty roof top. Toni just watched for a second, amazed at how the shoot handled himself against the Steve, a super soldier. It looked like an even fight, an unbelievable scene. There weren't many people who could say that. Shit, the shooter had just caught the shield like it was nothing…with a metal—Yes, a metal hand. What the hell? Who created that master piece? No, no.
There was no way Toni would touch those pills and the Colonel knew this. If she had been poisoned and that device was blocking the poison from entering her heart, he knew she would not touch it. Was that why she didn't trust anyone? He asked himself. It didn't matter the reason why, because she wouldn't take anything from anyone.
Like the sick mind that he was, Zola adds, "Accidents happened." The computer screen flashed to new sets of images; however, there was a single picture that caught Steve's attention.
. She didn't even notice as it graze her skin, making her bleed; granted, it could've been the Super solder tackling her to the ground with a more force than need that distracted her. She, a woman on her last stable footing, was seeing stars, as Steve
Natasha eyed the super soldier as he slowly crossed back to one of the sofas in the room. Without removing his shield from his back, the man gradually sat down. He bowed his head, folding his hands in the other. He played with them, picked at them. "Steve," the Assassin called, still eyeing him.
There was no denying that, and this was why she needed this AI, who had become a part of her. He was her conscience, allowing her talk through her issues. He was her sounding board, and when she needed the AI, he was her chain to reality. "Fine, take me home." Only one thing came to mind:
Clint took a deep breath as his eyes rested on Toni for a few long seconds. "Take care of her. I mean it, Rogers," he said before he turned and walked up the steps.
"Why is that? Because I'm a woman?" she asked, annoyed that he wouldn't let her do what she needed to do. Couldn't he understand that she couldn't risk anyone else's life? Couldn't he understand that she couldn't take anymore guilt on her conscious?
her, and she was going to slap the man in half if he said it one more time. Also, if he mentioned that creepy doll of his one more time, she really was going to hit someone, because that was downright disturbing. How big was this doll? What did he do with this doll? Was it one of his
Bucky gives Steve a look before the two Super Soldiers chase after Tony. They aren't going to let the brunette escape from them again, and unlike last time, they aren't going to give up. For the first time, Tony realizes this and he's smiling as he's being chased through the tower. He probably looks like an idiot to everyone around them, but he doesn't care. He's happy for once, and he can't wait for what comes now.
"I'm not the one who bolted out of the bar in a fit of jealousy," he counted as he rounded yet another corner. Before anyone could speak another word, Barnes shoved her against the wall and held her there for a few seconds. "Ssh," he ordered as the footsteps got louder.
Steve glanced at Natasha, her brain still spinning. His own mind was going in a million directions. "What about Toni? Answer me!"
Schmidt suddenly looked around as he noticed Toni was gone, but they did not stay to look for her, like he wanted. Zola was able to convince him to leave without her, as the flames started to jump higher, almost licking them.
The Asset, though restrained in the chair, scanned the room, studying each people. Even if he was a master of hiding his emotions (Not that he had many…if any at all), confusion was present on his face. Though he was hardly given any information besides what mission necessary, he was unsure of what to make of this situation or what was happening. What was happening? Who was Barnes? The name sounded familiar, but he had no idea of where he had heard this name before. He knew it from these strange words in his head, but he still had no idea of what the name meant.
Steve closed his eyes as he could feel the blush forming in his cheeks. He wasn't stupid, knowing exactly what Fury was referring to. Natasha had even said that picture of them kissing would be on the 6 O'clock news, granted he thought she was joking. Why would anyone want to see a picture of him and Toni kissing? Why would anyone care?
The only thing that Toni wanted was for the lawyer to leave. She wasn't sure what was running through her mind as everything was going a million miles an hour, but she refused to break down in front of this man. She refused to break down in front of anyone. "No, Sir." she replied, forcing herself to turn to him. She put on the fakest grin that she could possibly put on. "My father just likes to fuck with me. No doubt this is another one of those times."
While Banner worked on duplicating the device, the Captain went on a SHIELD mission, which he had taken to get his mind off Toni's disappearance, but it failed to distract him as she was always on his mind. (Though it might've not been a distraction regardless as he was looking for the stole devices.) Thinking about her didn't divert his attention away from the mission too much, and besides no one could take him (well besides Thor or the Hulk) in a fight. He kept thinking about what she would say in retort to the criminal he was trying to catch, and he had to hold back a few laughs as quite a few snarky, smartass things came to mind.
I think I should clarify something so no one is confused. The future isn't going as fast as the past is. So many months may have passed in the past, but in the present, it has only been a few weeks.
Toni and Barnes found the door to the Data Center in a few minutes, which was around the same time that the body was found. The alert was sounded the second the door was closed and locked behind them, but they both knew that wouldn't hold not with those hydra weapons.
to believe this, because he had to. Toni being dead was not possible, because without her, he didn't know who he was. He didn't know what to do without her. She was his true North, his rock, who kept him steady. Sure, he could handle whatever life had for him, but she kept him sane, even if she wasn't. She kept him upright and on this toes. She had been there for as long as he could remember, and the idea that she was gone scared him.
"So why don't I take you home and you show me how much you like this accent?" he teased, resting his head against hers.
"I'm sorry to have do this, but I had no place else to crash." Fury said, while writing another text. There was no hesitation in his voice, lying as easily as breathing. He turned the phone, showing the text to them: 'SHIELD compromised.'
, she told herself. She knew it was stupid to be worried, but she blamed it on the pain, clouding her judgment.
"Too bad it isn't strong enough to mute you. Your voice's like nails on a chalk board," she said as she leaned over the table.
Toni gave him a good look, narrowing her eyes at him. "You have been thinking about this for a while?"
Toni took a deep breath as she stared at her device, which she hadn't tested yet as she hadn't been able to find a safe place. She didn't want to test it around people as there was no telling what would happen; however, there was another reason why she hadn't. She was afraid to, not sure of what it would do and what would happen. She had it hooked up to a core, but there was no way of controlling the core. Once she turned it on, it had a mind of its own, which she learned from the last time she had activated it.
A part of her—the part that hated herself- wanted to stop and let them kill her. It wasn't like she was any match for them in her current physical or mental state. She could barely think straight, not with the recent head injury she suffered. Her head pounding. She could feel the warm blood dripping down her face onto her clothes, and though she could not see it, it felt like her entire face was covered in blood, blurring her vision.
Barton eyed the CEO from the bar as he poured himself a drink. It was just the three of them in the lounge. Romanoff had disappeared soon after Rhodes having the same mission. She went to find Toni, though her motives might have been different than Rhodes. However, the chances were higher that the master assassin would find the genius before anyone else did. No one could hide from Romanoff.
So now, she just closed her eyes waiting for death as there were no dodging fireballs—not in her state. She waited for the hit, the burning of flash, but it never came. She expected pain, but she just was met with a gentle -ashy though- breeze. Even with the cinders, it was still a blessing against her sweating face. She could sit there for a second and just feel the coolness against her face. It felt heavenly, but now was not the time.
There's an open struggle on the Captain's face, and it's clear that there's something he wants to say but is scared to say it. "Buck's right, Tony," he burst out, quickly and suddenly. "You're riskless and careless. Doesn't listen. I…" He drifts off as he takes a deep breath and rubs his chin. His eyes are glued on Tony. "D-Do you know how it feels to see you disappear into that building, refusing to accept our requests to talk?" His voice is breaking, shaking, but there's something else in his tone. "Do…you care, Tony?"
Shaking his head, Jim took a step toward his best friend. "Oh, god no," he groaned. "I do not need to hear that!"
"You're the one who started to act strangely," she stated, getting to her feet. She dusted the snow off her chest and her knees. "But we shouldn't talk about this now. Lead the way," she said as she waved him to go.
"How are you?" He looked uncomfortable, asking her. "I see your injures are healing nicely and you got your annoying personally back." He leaned back in his chair and eyed her.
Still in the Iron Man suit- minus the helmet-, Toni leaned against the railing, almost losing her balance and falling over (not that she would fall in the suit), but she didn't move from her spot. The cool wind felt nice on her hot face, and she couldn't think of any other place that she would rather be…No, that was a lie. She wanted to be in Steve's arms, but giving the situation, this would have to do. Standing in the hot sun with the strong wind in her hair—which was a complete mess on her head and sticking up in all directions-, she felt okay—not okay. She felt old herself return, even if was only for two seconds.
"You could've died, Tony." Bucky adds, bitterness still in his voice. "Do you understand? Can you with that fucken brain of yours understand how we felt? How we feel? I thought we lost you." He keeps close to Tony, almost as if he's afraid the genius will disappear. "I thought I lost you…"
"You've faced a lot in your life, haven't you?" Erskine stated, seeing through her worry like Phillips had done.
"Relax, Sark," Peggy stated, realizing something must've set her off. She reached a hand out to steady her, but Toni shoved it away. "Come on." Her voice rose. "You need to sit back down. Don't be so hard headed."
Clint threw his hands up as if to surrender. "Geez, just trying help a guy. I feel so unloved," he replied, playing hurt.
"Okay, that table is worth someone's monthly salary and can probably withstand a tap dance, but I'm in no way, shape or form standing on it," she said, giving him a look. Her legs were finally back to normal, and she could jump for joy, but she was too focus on the crazy man standing on Pepper's glass table.
This was why she never opened up to anyone, because no matter what, everyone was going to turn on her.
Toni Stark had always been a night owl, awaking up noon and sleeping at odd hours. Most of the time, she didn't go to bed until the sun was coming up, and when she did go to bed, it was usually only for a few hours. She didn't care who had an issue with it, as it was when she did her best thinking. It was when she felt the most free, but it was also when she felt alone. Alone to think…granted with Toni that wasn't always a good thing, but she was alone to be herself. To drop her mask. To be free of judgement.
Schmidt stepped to Toni, snapped the restrains that held her to the chair, and pulled her to her feet. "We're leaving, Doctor. Gather your things and let's go." He pulled Toni toward the door, causing her to trip over her own feet.
"Do not," Clint replied. "But I will say she's annoying like a cat. Only want attention on her terms."
she thought; however, that thought didn't last too long. There was no way she could take anything that he was giving.
"Because he lied to us." Pierce declared, loudly, as he entered the room. The expression on his face said it all. "Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury, and he refused to share it. As difficult as this is to accept, Captain America is a fugitive from SHIELD."
"I'm sure that Bruce had given you a talking to and James will be giving you one soon, but if you hurt her, I'll dump you where no one can find you. I'll leave you alive but alone with nothing. Nothing. I'll leave to suffer in some desert with no chances of getting back. You got that, Captain?" she asked, calmly. Her voice was calm, which made her threat all the more deadly.
At first the joking was fun, as it helped her forget about her pain, but now, the jokes were getting to be too much. She needed them to stop. "No, I think I'm good. What fun would it be if you don't find her for yourself? And I think the world would drop into madness without a Toni Stark," she said.
When Steve reached the Robotic labs, he felt his heart skip at the sight of her. From his angle, he didn't have a good view of her, but he felt himself relax just at the sight of her. He felt like he was in control of himself now that she was back. He felt like himself. He felt like he could smile, even if he was having a difficult breathing. What was it about her that made him feel like this? He had fought the Red Skull, jumped out of planes with nothing on his back besides his shield, and fought an alien race, but the sight of Toni made him breathless.
"Excuse me?" Toni asked, getting pissed. Why was she the only woman they betted on? There were plenty of women these men could go after. Why the hell did he think she wanted it? She didn't want it… Okay, she did like it and there was times that she wanted. Heck, she hadn't had sex in a while, but that did not mean she would sleep or even consider sleeping with any of these men.
Steve gave her a look, cupping her face. "I'm getting there," he said, letting out a playful huff. He placed a soft kiss to her lips. "You're impatient."
Howard raised an eyebrow. "That doesn't mean you'll get away from me. I'll probably hug you or something once you returned."
She let out a small chuckle. "Not a chance, Salty." she smiled. "So where's my device?" she asked as she buckled herself in tightly. However, if the plane was to fall from the sky, a seatbelt would not save her.
He reached for her and pulled her in. "I have been told that," he stated as he held her. "You can tell me." He paused. "Do you think someone's following you again?" He asked, not letting go.
Steve felt like he had lost a battle as he told Pepper what happened, and that softness in her voice made it worst. It felt like pity, which was something that Steve didn't want. However, he could've been imagined it. Pepper was the first real person he talked to about it, giving her more detail than anyone. Sure, Natasha and Clint knew, but he gave them the basic, an outline really. His voice didn't almost give out like it had with Pepper. He was sure she read him like a book. It was no wonder why Toni had held on to their friendship so tightly. Pepper was something else.
It was that emptiness that filled him every moment of every day, but after one of his kills, that changed. For once, he thought something as one of his targets was familiar to the Asset. It felt like he knew this man, but that didn't stop the Asset from killing him. There wasn't even blink of hesitation in his man. He didn't allow this familiarity to stop him, even if it made him wonder who this man was. Did he know this man? If so, how?
"All I need is some sleep," she replied, turning back to him. He was also wrong about letting people in. If she let people in, she was opening a door to being hurt, and she was hurting enough as it was.
"But there are limits to what even you can do, Captain. Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?" Schmidt said, glaring the Captain. It was quite clear that he wanted to kill the man in front of him and he would enjoy doing it.
She couldn't take it anymore, not right now. "Stop." She said forcefully. "Don't you ever die for me! Ever! You hear me? You're more important than I am."
"I take it the family is back in town?" she asked, look over her Iron Man suit over. The suit was in one piece, though she would have to patch up some marks on it. It looked like it took a beating.
However, it didn't matter if they or anyone else tracked them down, as long as he had his Brunette. For some reason that the Asset could not understand, his chest lightened at the thought of having her. It felt like he was light as a feather, standing on air, at the thought that she was his—though he still couldn't find out why. Why was she so important to him? Why did he need her? And why did he want to run his hand through her mess, coffee colored hair? Again, he wasn't sure, but he was going to find her, no matter what. He was going to find her.
Hello! I am sorry it took me so long to get this, but the next Chapter turned into a Monster. Over 14,000 words beast. So I split it in half. haha. You will get the second half once my Beta gets it back. So you will get two chapters in a short time!
Steve let Bucky walk pass him before he said anything. "This is about me wanting to join the army, isn't it?"
Up in the penthouse, Steve was sitting at the bar using a tablet, which he still struggled with. Steve didn't really understand modern technology, so he wouldn't be of real any help for Bruce. He didn't even try to help because he knew it would be a waste of time. Unsure of what else he could do, he was looking through the security logs with the help of JARVIS, who was doing most of the work.
"What do you mean? What rabbit?" Toni pushed herself up and glared at him, but he didn't say anything. "What do you want?" she asked, her voice cracking. Her throat was dry, aching with every word that she was saying.
Steve and Schmidt walked toward each other on the long bridge. "I'm a great fan of your films." He paused as he looked him over. "So Dr. Erskine managed it after all. Not exactly an improvement, but still impressive."
The Captain felt the air rushed him as he free fell; however, he wasn't worried about the hitting the ground as his eyes were focused on the broken tree that had fallen on Toni. Seconds before hitting the ground, the tree shock and a bright light shown through the broken branches, and Steve let out the breath that he didn't know he was holding. He could feel his heart rest slightly as he saw a red metal arm reached out of the branches.
"Shu-" Her stalker started. The Commander put her hand up to silence him. "You can stall all you want, because no one's coming, not even the love sick Captain, and you made sure of that when you sent him away, so very heartbroken."
"I think that's it," she said, taking the seat on the other side of Salty. Phillips nodded, taking the report from Peggy.
"Well, I'm not the type of girl who need a gentleman," she answered, mad at herself. She didn't want to be the type of girl who needed to be rescued. She wanted to be the knight in her own story.
Toni snorted. She wasn't known to give the responses that people wanted. "Just do it," she muttered. The thought of it the act had to be worse than the act itself she thought. She was getting herself too worked up and she was losing her breath just thinking of it. At this point, she wanted them to do it.
Her eyes lids felt heavy as she tied to open her eyes. "L-lights," she stuttered. She could barely make out anything in the darkness and Toni wasn't sure if was her eye sight or the lights.
Switching the ice bag to her broken left hand, she felt him flinch as she grabbed his hand. Ignoring that and his rapid heartbeat (which she could feel through her grasp), she pulled him to the couch and sat him down. She wasn't going to hold it against him, as he was innocent and naive unlike her; he wasn't comfortable around women. After she had him sitting, she pressed the cold compact to his face. She felt him jump at her touch but he didn't pull away. Though he couldn't really look at her with the pouch on his face, she felt his eyes on her.
happen again. I… g-grabbed her thinking a fan has broken in," He paused, taking a deep breath, "but regardless, I shouldn't have reacted like that. I'll have to live with that, and by chance it happens again, I give your permission to use that on me." He pointed toward the knife. "You can cut me like a fish."
Tony’s close proximity and breath on his neck sent violent shivers crashing through out Steve’s body. He turned rapidly in his seat to face Tony who was sporting a wicked grin.
"I really don't know what to think anymore. The evil wicked people I have encountered previously all said they did what they did to inevitably abolish evil and make the world a better place. But I really don't see how you can make the world a better place by doing evil things."
“Oh Steve, thank God for small mercies.”  Tony whispered as he planted his face into the crook of Steve’s neck holding onto him fiercely.
“That doesn’t matter anymore,” Steve spoke.  “There is no way to stop her from using the keystone.”  Steve stated matter of factly which served to confuse the hell out of him when many displayed an all new level of misery in horror.
He immediately realized that was the absolute stupidest thing to say when one of her shiny black Christian Louboutin pumps collided with his rib cage brutally.
Tony relaxed a little seeing Barnes going through his recent files and not trapezing through Amazon.
His eyes widened in horror as he can see each and every member of his unit and the second unit bound by one of those barbaric tentacles.  He had to think fast.  He had punched out enough of those things to know they had tiny cores that once broke dissipated the charge.  but he doubted he could damage the core if none of the others manage to.
"Daddy? Why are you scowling?" Ellie spoke up suddenly, completely shattering Steve's train of thought.
Steve followed the happy child upstairs to her room. When he walked through the door he was shocked to discover that her room was not styled the way he’d expect a girl her age to have her room. The most notable feature was that her room was red, white and blue themed. It was themed after Captain America. Steve felt astonished and flattered. There was a replica of his shield right over her bed and what appeared to be an army of dolls in all shapes and sizes on the shelves next to it.
Steve felt bile rise to his throat. They were going to keep him confined like an animal. In a tower! He absently thought if a prince would come rescue him. Only, the “prince” he was thinking of, no doubt, was the one that locked him in here in the first place.
Steve was very relieved to know that Xavier was coming back, he felt much better knowing more help was coming in. That man in particular seems to have the capacity to put Steve’s mind at ease and for that he was glad of it.
Not so much of a cliff hanger this time but still kinda leave you yearning for more right? All theories and comments welcome.
"Thought so…" She sighed, then turned her attention back to Ellie. "No worries, auntie Angie to the rescue. Gotta go assist Princess Avalon in vanquishing the dust bunnies, then escape here back to the hospital!" Angie declared epically.
Steve sighed. Of course he did. Captain America braced himself for the fireworks. Sure enough the air-conditioning unit he was hiding behind exploded in a brilliant blaze of debris. He stood amongst the shattered remanence of the air conditioner upon a rooftop that overlooked Von Dooms location.
The fact of the matter is a super virus would also leave physical evidence. There is no physical evidence of any kind that could be found in the patients that pointed to either of those possibilities. Not to mention the sporadic randomness of the cases.
Tony Stark has been known by many titles. Some given to him through esteemed achievement: visionary, genius, American patriot (gag). Some self-proclaimed: billionaire, Playboy, philanthropist. Others attained through assessment: compulsive, self-destructive, narcissistic. And some acquired through the fear, anger and desolation his work had wrought: monster, terrorist, dangerous. However, his most important titles to date were born of his infernal captivity and his desperation to live and to claw his way to freedom: hero, Avenger, Iron Man.
"Tony is the most unpredictable person I know. I had no doubt he could beat you." Steve responded finally with a small smirk.
“You are built like Steve, you would feel mild buzzing at most. I have it calibrated as close as possible to him but I need to adjust it to you since you are the one that’s going to use it.” Tony replied getting snarky.
Steve thought for a moment. A small spark in his soul, utterly resilient that refused to be extinguished, begged for a modicum of reprieve.
Barnes smirked and pulled another gun from his arsenal and with rapidfire precision, that could rival Clint, took down eight more. "166." He replied. "Try to keep up with me." He winked then bounded off shooting down any in his site.
After everyone was thoroughly engrossed in their work, Thor led Steve to the closest and safest location to summon the Bifrost. As much as Steve hates to admit it, flying with Tony is way better than flying with Thor. Even when Tony likes to fling him around like a rag doll, Thor was pretty damn brutal. They’ve landed pretty safely in a clearing far from civilization.
Steve was in his studio slowly adding color to his Coney Island painting.  Even though this scene would usually inspire profound reminiscent feelings that usually consisted of guilt and grief, the Captains mind was blank, completely lost in the process of adding and mixing colors.  He was so deep in his activity he did not realize he was no longer alone or that Jarvis had in fact announced the arrival of his new guest.  He was completely shocked out of his reverie by the sound of Johnny’s voice.
“You want to experiment on my head? Mine?! You’ve got to be fucking joking! I can’t tell whether your stupidly insane or insanely stupid!” He raged. “Did you so suddenly forget what happened yesterday?!”
If Bucky was being framed, then he was likely not in East Texas. At least there’s that. That means the others were nowhere close to finding him. That also means he could be anywhere in the world. Steve groaned in dismal abandoned.
What was he going to do now? He was kind of stuck here. Was this how he was going to live out the rest of his life? Was this empty blackness all he was ever going to know?
He looked about the large meeting room for a moment as the Professor was en route towards the head of the meeting table.
Tony watched the elevator’s descent and heard the chatter of the agents that were about to around the corner. The elevator dinged and he made eye contact briefly with Bucky. The soldier nodded indicating that he was ready.
How on earth had he not seen it before? He was a goner even then. When had his sketches transitioned from Peggy and other elements from the 40s to his new team and Tony? He flipped through more pages to see his teammates faces pop up again. He noted Tony showing up with increased frequency until that’s all there was. The last one before his sketch from earlier was a very provocative scene where pieces of his Ironman armor were coming off to show his unclothed skin underneath. His body was posed in a tantalizingly erotic manner.
“Did they do it?”  Johnny asked astonished.  Steve was about to reply that he hopes so before a great surge of energy exploded into the sky in a straight column.
“The twins’s presence is invaluable, we have so few people left to fight. And I’m- I’m not Steve. I can’t lead these people, not like he can. As made excruciatingly apparent the other day, Calamity isn’t the only threat out there. We need someone who can really lead us.” He stressed in a whisper.
“And do you also know that despite everything and I mean ‘everything’ that has happened so far I can still read you like a book?”
Just as Johnny was about to deliver a smoldering punch into that vile man’s face he stopped midair only a few feet away. Steve watched with horror as a woman came out of the shadows. She was controlling Ben and Johnny making them just float there. She approached them steadily and when she touched their faces they were out old.
After a wonderfully fun adventure of figuring out how to get a traumatized, one armed, bleeding Winter Soldier into a maybe too small diving suit they were in the pressure chamber ready to bail.
Discussing his concerns with Tony will perhaps shed some light on the situation. He hopes that Tony’s opinion on the matter will possibly help alleviate his anxiety. If his gut feeling is right, then at the very least they should prepare for the likelihood that a terrible mission will be underway.
“Well then, if you intend on fighting for this world then we need to get you combat ready. And to do that we need to fix your arm.” Tony said jovially.
Steve turned just in time to see a silhouette leave the doorway as Hank closed the door.  Steve could have sworn he saw a flash of soft blue light.  It was somehow incredibly soothing.  Like all the sudden all his questions have been answered.
She landed with grace and elegance that made Tony want to vomit more than the shields hideous smell did.
“I am going to go alert the others that you are awake. I know a certain genius that has been completely insufferable since you got here.” She winked at him.
"Oh, you are so tempting, soldier. I fear one day I'll give in to you completely." She whispered leaning in for another tender kiss.
After one more go at Steve's plan, the Avengers found that the alien robot thingy made really good fireworks.
“No, Natasha and Clint are down there. What about the Doom bot?!” His outburst cause another bout of coughing.
"I may be wrong but opening the tube first might help you get the suit on quicker." Barnes quipped somewhere behind him.
“Do you know how small of a window .5% is?! If and only if the right conditions are met? We don’t even know what those conditions are if we missed those windows yet!” Tony argued. Barton made to retort but Tony continued. “How can I possibly decipher this code and figure out how to use the data if I can’t even figure out why Steve left.”
He was putting too much stress on his already broken abdomen. The pain was nearly unbearable, yet he managed to ignore it, finding sickening comfort an old instincts. He cleared his mind and assessed the situation, he could almost trick himself into believing pain did not exist when he had a mission.
“You mean, like picking up a spatula, holding it tight and using it to flip over my breakfast?” Barnes asked with a rueful triumphant smirk.
“Even if I did think that, Tony, it wasn’t your choice to make! Besides it wouldn’t work anyway. If she wanted me bad enough, she’d just keep me alive. And even if I could off myself she could easily choose someone else. There’s no telling if she has that capacity and I’m not about to dump this on the next person.” He shifted. “Why put me on house arrest? Why keep me locked up?”
“Well, you are in luck. I might have absentmindedly made too many sandwiches.” He said looking down at the stack of them. Huh… He kinda did. The Captain got lost in the repetition of making the sandwiches whilest deep in thought. Although he could eat all seven of them he probably shouldn’t.
Being confined to a bed could not, would not stop him from drawing on newspapers, grocery bags, and other scraps of paper Bucky managed to scrounge up for him.
“Whoa there bird boy who’s pretty little panties do you have tight up your ass.”  Tony countered back.
They had finished calibrating the painkilling device, completed a full body scan and had somehow miraculously succeeded in the first step of getting Barnes combat ready, they had removed all of Hydra’s old hardware. Everything from the bone anchoring mechanisms in his shoulder to the neuro-cybernetic microchips implanted in his spinal cord at the base of his skull.
In that very moment, Tony finally saw, for the first time, the true hero everybody was quick to revere and idolize without question. Many times in the past Tony had scoffed at everybody’s earnest dedication to Steve. It was rather nauseating to him. Now, however, he understood.
Even the burning of his wrist where Calamity’s mark had been prominent had begun to recede. That too he could feel no more. He almost eagerly awaited his return to oblivion. He was most the way there any way.
Sensing a shift in the air, Barnes hazard a quick glance at Tony. Big mistake. Tony delighted in the visible gulp the soldier made.
“Already working on it.”  Natasha replied sending a nervous glance to Tony who looked ready to be sick.
Soon most of the occupants of the room realized what agent Romanov was about to do to quell Clint’s panicked rant.  That is until the Professor let out a moan of agony.  Everyone shocked to silence as their attention was drawn to Professor in horror.  They didn’t know what ailed him.  He looked stricken and exhausted and in pain.  But before any could inquire about his condition the reason made itself blatantly an unmistakably known by a deafening roar.
The man paused for a moment, then sighed, "Most likely, but I'll let you have it anyway, it's Tony." The man, Tony, replied.
In nearly no time at all Tony had Barnes perfectly situated in the exam station Tony manufactured for him. This time, however, they had Wanda nearby ready to step in the moment Barnes became overly distressed. And just like their first awful attempt at this twelve days ago, all the parameters Tony set up where the same.
Johnny’s eyebrows shot up in surprise but didn’t protest. The children found that exciting an awesome.
With all of these thoughts swirling around in his head he sat and watched as the sky changed colors as the sun was setting.  He continued to watch as the first of the glimmerings stars appeared in the heavens.  By the time the sky was as black as ebony two thoughts kept circling around and around in Steve’s mind like a mantra: no cure, they were just kids, no cure, they were just kids.
“The best possible thing we could do now is to find a way to help the victims. Perhaps we could find a clue as to why or how this creature chooses its targets. If we know that we may be able to predict where it will strike next and be better prepared. But first we need to remain calm and collected until we connect with Asgard for assistance.”
Johnny, seeing that Steve was genuinely curious and not at all upset at having his privacy invaded, continued back to the door.
“I made several more adjustments to it after collecting data from the last time.” Tony remarked. “Now it will transition into effectiveness much more gradually. Personally, I like the idea of being able to turn pain off like a switch but for you, however, a much more subtle shift is needed.”
After they had all promised to meet up again, perhaps for a picnic, Steve and Johnny walked them out to their vehicles.  The children were incredibly reluctant to part from Steve but he promised they would see each other again.
Tony was hoping Barnes could lead his team in the ways he could not. All his attention needed to be focused on solving the Calamity case and saving the world. The soldier certainly had the skills, he just needed the drive, the will. Hell, he even had the loyalty, more or less, already. Natasha trusted him and Clint trusted Natasha. Tony hoped Rhodey would trust his judgment (a longshot, but hey, as long as we are doing the wishful thinking thing.) Wilson was up in the air. Lang and Parker where pretty much along for the ride. And Storm and Grimm could respect a strong leader. He had his suspicions that the Professor already approves, therefor the rest of the X-Men did and Tony figures the twins already trust him. Barnes just needs to trust himself.
Steve woke up with a feeling of all consuming numbness.  It took him a while to realize that he was in fact awake and…  Well…  Alive for that matter.  He looked no better either.  He had prominent dark circles under his eyes and his face was a little sunken in.  He spaced out watching his heartbeat on the monitor.
Everyone else was slightly confused about the revelation.  They know what it means but not so much what it really has to do with the situation.
“The hexilien format algorithm. It’s the program Hydra came up with studying the lore along with the cube and subsequently the universe around us. It’s how they created the advanced weaponry that could not have feasibly existed during the war. It’s how they were able to create the serum and my arm.” He explained lowly.
Steve continued dejectedly, “Everyone is treating me differently, like I’m fragile.  Everyone.  My team won’t look me in the eye and Tony flat out refuses to acknowledge my presence.  It hurts, all of it!  I just wish someone could explain it to me.”  The Captain spoke barely above a whisper.
“Please, just let me go! I’m not worth it!” He shouted as he tried to wrench his wrist free from Steve’s iron grip.
Soon everyone was arguing, yelling and threatening.  The acrimony in the air reeked so much Steve wanted to choke.
He feels horrible, he really does, that Fury almost died and that someone was after him, but damn he was incredibly angry about the whole thing.  He was at least happy that Fury let them know that he was still alive, because if he found out later that his survival was another thing they were keeping from him he was going to lose it.  He was going to give them the best impression of the Hulk any of them had ever seen.
He reached up to the device on his temple.  Suddenly everyone was engulfed by a fierce electrical charge.  Tony’s screams were yet another thing he doubted he could ever erase from his nightmares.
A/N: Yes! Finally! Finally he gets sent back in time. For the longest time I seriously thought we were not going to get here. It is definitely something of a load off. Now all I have to do is play with this situation and at the same time show everybody what’s happening on the other side with Tony and the others, no pressure… I hope this was satisfying enough. This was actually going to end up being one of my shortest chapters ever but I felt it needed an extra scene. The extra scene was Steve’s flashback it fits well and it also will lead into various key points I have planned for later on.
Tony should have known better than to get in so deep. Fuck! So stupid! Please, let’s add that to the list also.
And now he doesn’t have Tony to lean on.  Everything seems to be slipping away, right through his fingers like fine sand.  It’s near the end of the world and he’s sitting there alone brooding.
“No. No. No. Don’t tell me you came back just to leave again! Please!” He pleaded. He grabbed Steve’s face with one hand and looked him in the eye. He could feel his heart break all over again. “Please, I just got you back, can’t lose you again.” He whispered in misery.
He gingerly slipped out of the bed. He felt tight pulling all over his abdomen. He lifted the gown and saw all of the lines of gnarly stitches. Wow, he could see why most of his team was surprised he was still alive. There was also a long jagged stitched up cut on his right arm and on his face.
Tony probably saw him as a bit of fun in the sack, nothing more. Sure he cared for him, but the genius cared for all their friends.
Tony winced. “Play nice” he told himself. He put on a strained smile and shook the man’s hand begrudgingly. He realized almost too late what he must look like when they continued to stare.
"Wait! I don't know what kind of deal you two got going on but I'm going to be damned if I let you take Steve away from me again." He could feel his team rally behind him. "And I am sure as hell not going to let you tear his soul out in front of me!"
He tried so hard… He tried to do things right and everything went so so wrong. Tears threatened to spill even after he had promised himself that he wouldn’t shed a single tear over this.
Suddenly the soldier began flailing. “Get it off! Get it off!” He began almost clawing at the helmet.
“So, hey, how about we have a talk?” He began as casually as he could muster given the awkwardness of the situation.
Steve looked upon the bot with dismay still coughing blood. He realized the bot was about to deliver a driving punch. He placed his shield between himself and the bot. The impact was like nothing he ever felt before, even with his vibranium shield that the Doom bot had successfully struck away from him.
“You’re an idiot. You chose me over your friends, you could have stayed. Why? You could be safe with your team.”
"Jesus Christ!" He shouted to himself as he turned on the tap and splashed his face with cold water. "Oh God, oh God." He muttered in a mantra when he realized that he was still painfully hard.
Her head bobbed back, resting against his shoulder. The fabric of his uniform rubbed against her face, itching, but she had no energy to adjust. It was a battle to keep her eyes open as the man held her tight. She kept telling herself that she had to stay awake that something was off about him. She had to figure out who this man was, but her brain didn't want to function.
The chair was the most uncomfortable chair on the planet and no matter which way she moved, Toni could not find a comfortable position. I wish I could put my feet up, she thought as she couldn't t kick her feet up like she wanted. The pain, which was controlled by medication, was still present, and it was still bothersome, making it hard to think. She needed to have a clear mind if she wanted to beat those asshats. Toni glanced around the room, trying to clear to her mind from the pain.
ornament, which featured the Chibi visions of Captain America and Iron Man Kissing—minus the helmet. Toni wasn't sure about the ornament at first, but she decided she liked it, even if she wasn't a fan of Christmas. It seemed like she wasn't the only either, who liked it, as it sold out in record time, which Clint teased Steve and her endlessly about. Toni teased right back, because Clint was jealous. Just jealous.
She closed her eyes. "He shouldn't have grabbed me," she mumbled. "He also shouldn't have sedated me and forced me to…" She shook her head as she drifted off. She didn't want to think about her nightmares as they plagued her enough.
He doesn’t want to admit it but he knows he has to. Sighing deeply, Tony admits, “I told her I can’t see me and Steve being friends again.”
Steve swallows and shakes his head. The what-if’s aren’t important. He needs to turn his face forward. He needs Tony to understand that they’re on the same page. And knowing Tony, he might not hear what Steve’s saying.
In his most indulgent moments, way back when, Steve would lie in bed and imagine what it would be like to kiss Tony. Lovely, undoubtedly. Sometimes he had imagined them falling into a passionate embrace after a heated battle. Other times he had imagined them turning to each other in the dead of night, when it would feel like they were the last two people left on Earth.  But he’d never imagined this scenario where he’d be kissing Tony to convince him that they’re on the same page, emotionally.
“I just don’t get why it should be us. I mean,” Sam says as he grips his drink with both hands. “What’s the point of it, you know?”
Tony shakes his head. “If I’d chosen the anti-registration side, then things would have gone a lot worse than they did. You didn’t see th-”
“I know,” Tony says, voice blessedly low. “Doesn’t mean I’m not worried about her.” Another creak, softer this time. “Is this how you felt whenever I got banged up?”
“If he doesn’t, we’ll make sure he does,” Rhodey says, exchanging a look with Carol, who has a feral grin spreading across her face.
Wow. She wants to cry. She really, really wants to cry. She’s looked up to Captain America and Iron Man while growing up. Not just as heroes but also their friendship. Civil War had been
“Mmm,” Tony makes a show of checking his watch. “A whole thirty minutes early. Must have been really nervous.”
He clears his throat right as Steve teases, “Don’t worry. I’ll let you watch Grey’s at least once in the next two months.”
“Really,” she answers. She nods towards Steve, Tony, and Cap. “What do you think they’re talking about?”
Steve collapses in on himself; he buries his face in his hands and tries to become one with the marble counter top. It's a bit like a brown bear trying to hide behind a whispy tree; it's fucking comical. He mumbles something into his palms but Tony, for all his genius, cannot speak mumble so he rubs Steve’s back some more and asks, “Mind repeating that?”
There’s nothing to be said to that. Steve silently watches Tony pull a tissue out and use it to blow his nose. Steve waits until Tony’s wiped his face clean before asking, heart in his throat, “Would you do it again? Make the same choices?”
“Took me a while,” Steve admits wryly. Whoa! Since when has Tony’s hand been on Steve’s knee? How’d Kamala miss that? “You might have noticed that I was having a bit of a crisis of my own.”
Steve’s not sure how he’s going to manage to look at Tony because even now, his mind keeps going back to the obscene sight of Tony wiping Steve’s come off his face and sucking his fingers clean. The way Tony had nipped Steve’s jaw. The hard clench of his fingers on Steve’s ass. All those
Ducking his head so that Steve can meet his lover's gaze, Steve tells him, voice insistent. “It wasn’t. You didn’t know what was going to happen. And I’ve
“I can’t believe I let you talk me into this,” Steve sighs as they walk through the gilded doors and into the large hall. He nervously tugs on his black-tie when a nearby socialite shoots him a curious look.
What’s more surprising is how Steve’s hand, more or less, stays pressed against the small of Tony’s back. There’s a couple of moments where Steve’s forced to take his hand back and Tony feels the loss keenly. But every time, Steve’s touch returns and the knot in Tony’s belly relaxes.
A bead of sweat forms on Steve’s forehead. “Why would you say that?” he says far too quickly. “Nothing’s broken. Everything’s fine. Just fine.”
A quiet sniff pulls Steve out of his thoughts. Looking up, he catches Tony rubbing his nose clean. He’s a pitiful sight, if Steve’s honest. With a runny nose and tears streaming down his cheeks. Sighing because he’s got a soft spot the size of Texas for Tony, Steve pulls a packet of tissues out of his pouch and holds it out towards Tony.
So he swallows, takes one last deep breath for good measure, gets ready to fight Tony, if it comes down to that, and steps through the closed doors.
A couple of hours later, Thor brings Enchantress back, literally shaking her until she agrees to take the spell off Tony. As soon as she’s done so, Tony glances at him, blue eyes filled with worry. Steve knows that look. He needs to nip Tony’s concerns in the bud. Needs to stop Tony’s insecurities from raising their ugly head and talk him out of being with Steve before they even start.
Kamala leans against a SHIELD van, observing the agents as they make their way through the debris, magic-detecting scanners moving in lazy arcs over the rubble.
And this letter Tony’s written? It’ll probably be more of his old tricks. It’s probably a non-apology. Tony’ll share his ‘legitimate’ reasons for his unscrupulous actions, avoid responsibility, and appeal to Steve’s emotions for forgiveness. Typical Tony stuff.
Steve re-reads the opening paragraph before his eyes slip down to the bottom of the page to check Tony’s signature. It’s there, in all its swoopy glory. Next, Steve picks up the envelope and double checks the return address. It’s got Tony’s address on there. The postmark on the front says it was mailed near the Avengers hanger in New Jersey as well.
sore tomorrow. And it’ll be worth it. Also, wow. Did Steve fuck him so good that he’s having his first moment of clarity so early on in his heat? That’s fucking incredible
“Despite everything that’s happened,” Tony whispers, “I still care too damn much about you, Steve. And if you keep looking at me like that… I don’t know what I’ll do.”
Nausea forgotten, Kamala cautiously cracks an eye open. The first thing she notices is the thin blue curtains pulled closed. The second thing she notices is Tony’s armored form sitting just out of her reach, looking up at Steve, who is sitting extremely close to Tony. Jesus. They might as well just sit in each other’s laps honestly.
why Tony’s upset with him. He’s tried to kill Tony twice now. But anger licks the edges of his shame and turns it to ash because Tony doesn’t get to be mad at him. Tony’s betrayal outweighs Steve’s actions.
Tony’s face softens in pleasure, the heat in his eyes transforming into something more hungry. Steve’s stomach twists itself into a knot. A small voice in his head is yelling in confused distress because Tony needs to stop looking at him like he cares about Steve when he’s done tons to prove otherwise. Then there’s the louder voice in his head scrambling for an explanation as to why Tony’s looking at him with rising lust. And there’s also that despairing whisper in the back of his mind what’s pleading in an ever growing voice, saying,
Wickedness sparkles in Steve’s eyes even as he smiles innocently at Tony. “You’re the one who agreed to let me pick what we’re going to watch on Thursday nights.”
Tony gasps, fingers tightening in Steve’s shirt. He follows the gentle pressure Steve’s hand applies, tilting his head to the side. Distressingly, Steve’s kisses move away from his lips. He nuzzles Tony’s beard, jawline, and finally the curve of his ear before he teasingly asks, “Is that a yes?”
“Yeah, I’m taking you out tonight. On a date.” Steve clarifies because he’s not leaving any room for miscommunication between them. Not anymore. “A romantic date. I’ll pick you up at 5. Okay?”
They trace the shape of Steve’s pectorals. Learn the lines of his torso. Kiss the shape of his hips. Tony commits to memory the way Steve shivers when Tony’s fingers dance too close to a ticklish spot. The sound of Steve’s pleasure and the way he tries to muffle himself with the back of his hand.
“We won’t do that!” Kamala promises. “We’re just going to create situations where they can meet up. And if we happen to be there, we’ll try to steer the conversation so that they’ll talk.”
As he comes out of his thoughts, he hears Sam saying, “But now that you’re here, we should be okay.”
The hefty amount of doubt in Steve’s eyes would be slightly insulting if Tony wasn’t already knee-deep in his heat. So instead, what Tony feels is an aching desire for Steve to believe. He wants Steve to understand, to realize how
“It does,” Steve answers, helplessly drawn to Tony. He could be 26 and fresh out of the ice again honestly, given how much his heart yearns for this man. There’s just so much longing rattling around inside of Steve, he doesn’t know what to do with it. He wants to tell Tony he still loves him, still wants him. But he can’t. Steve
They all fall silent at the query. Kamala’s mind keeps flashing, Steve’s forlorn expression in front of her eyes. She didn’t imagine that, right? She’s not misreading things,
Steve hopes that Tony understands that. Steve will happily spend the rest of their lives doing what needs to be done to get Tony to see that. Until that becomes a part of Tony’s reality. Tony responds with a kiss. Dry but lingering and sweet.
“Yes,” Tony moans, turning his face into Steve’s fingers. His dry lips brush against Steve’s knuckles and part, dropping soft kisses until they hit fingertips. Tony opens his mouth wider, wanting to suck on Steve’s fingers but Steve moves his hand away. A whine echoes in Tony’s chest, stomach clenching because why is Steve pulling away? Doesn’t he want Tony?
That’s just vague enough to make Sam and Carol turn on him. What’s alarming is that Tony sees Sam’s eyes widen in understanding. He can't help but wonder if Steve’s told Sam. There are good odds of that. But Sam’s also had a front-row seat to the Steve and Tony show so, he might accidentally arrive at the right conclusion anyway. Carol, however, is obviously burning up with curiosity.
Kamala finds herself straightening up to watch Steve. It might be her imagination but he cuts a more imposing figure than before. Maybe that’s because of his new uniform. If she’s totally honest though? She’s not a fan of the dark navy and white star in the center. It’s too dark for a guy like Ca-Steve. But it could also be his face. She’s pretty far away but she can make out his stormy expression easily.
So when she plops down next to him saying, “So. I need some advice.” Tony doesn’t think anything of it.
Kamala could hug the nurse. Seriously. If she could sit up, she would! Behind her, she hears the abrupt screech of a chair sliding back across the floor. Seems like the pair were caught by surprise.
Because here’s the thing. It’s not that Steve’s doesn’t do nice things for him. It’s just that the whole
A small part of her wants to clear her throat and say, ‘Um, hello? Remember me? The reason why you’re here in this hospital(?). Please don’t forget that I’m here.’ But the larger part of her is enthralled by what’s happening in front of her.
Speaking of the man, Steve curses wildly and the car veers sharply to the left, forcing Tony’s shoulder to dig into the door. Which is very irritating because he’d just pushed two fingers into himself and he’s not hitting the right spot now. Someone outside angrily honks at them.
He doesn’t doubt a lot of his decision. That’s not the kind of person Steve is. But this feels wrong. Being on the outside instead of being part of the Avengers. The feeling intensifies to the point of nausea when FRIDAY greeting him with a smooth, “Welcome Commander Steve Rogers.”
to be suave when all he can think about, all he can focus on, is Steve. All the anticipation that he’s built up for tonight has transformed into awe. Suddenly, the night is too short. Dinner wasn’t enough. This show isn’t long enough. Tony wants to spend more time with Steve.
He can’t stop thinking about her eyes; big, doe-like, and brimming with betrayed hope. Remembering her expression has him groaning into his hands. Tony had never thought he’d break such a cardinal rule of being a hero: don’t break any of your fan’s hearts, don’t let them lose hope.
“Yeah but... what kind of a spell would--?” Steve makes a helpless gesture at Tony because he doesn’t have words to describe what’s happening with Tony. This affection after years of drought? Steve’s drowning. “Plus, isn't there some protocol in place on how to handle a situation involving love spells?”
She can’t raise her head. Kamala frantically blinks her tears away. It takes her a couple of seconds to find the self-control to ask her next question. “Did you mean that? That you and Ca- Steve aren’t...can’t be friends anymore?”
Dragging a hand down her face, Kamala corrects herself, “Without Steve and Tony. But also, you gotta admit, Cap and Tony don’t fight with the same kind of efficiency Steve and Tony used to.”
And now, she’s lying God knows where slowly waking up with a monster of a headache. It feels like there are a million sharp, pointy rocks smacking around against her tender brain nerves. Kamala moans pitifully, praying that she doesn’t throw up. That would be seriously uncool. She hopes no one’s around to see her puke.
“We’re almost back at the Tower,” Steve is saying, voice cracking. His eyes are trained out the windshield. His fingers tighten around the steering wheel, making it creak. “We’ll do whatever you want then.”
The breathlessness of the inquiry takes Steve aback. But Steve’s quick to brush away his surprise. Gruffly, he answers, “I was worried that something might happen.” He tells himself he’s lying. He was more worried about the fate of the world than he was about Tony. He can almost believe it.
The first thing he sees is Hank McCoy walking by, eyes on the slim tablet in his hands, saying, “Other than a few bruises, you seem right as rain.”
Tony looks around him and realizes that they’re in his car now. Steve’s in the driver's seat, body turned towards Tony, who is riding shotgun. Why not in here? They’re alone in an enclosed space. It’s as good a place as any other. In fact, Tony’s ready to crawl over the stick and sit in Steve’s lap, greedy and eager for more now that they’re alone. But Steve’s hand shifts, shifting so that the heat of his palm rests square against the base of Tony’s neck and squeezes.
“Does that not work?” Steve worriedly asks. “We can skip the big plans and go for something simple.”
He closes the distance between them, one hand rising up to cup Tony’s cheek and the other going around the brunet’s waist. It’s a butterfly kiss at first. A gentle brush of his lips against Tony’s, here and gone. Not enough by any standards. Tony’s eyes fly open in surprise and Steve holds himself still, hoping desperately that his face isn’t red. Tony’s lips shape Steve’s name. His fingers squeeze Steve’s waist.
“I know. But she can’t afford to be distracted on the field. She needs to learn how to keep things off the battlefield.” Sam’s gaze shifts to him, turning sharper when he asks, “Do you know what’s going on with her?”
“I kinda got into a fight with a friend of mine. A real bad fight. There was a whole lot of yelling and mean things were said. And long story short, we’re not talking anymore. Do you have any advice on what I could do to... you know.” Kamal gestures helplessly.
feel comfortable going? He’d been worried that those questions, and more, would be a stumbling block. Thankfully, they hadn’t been. There had just been a bone-deep surety when Tony had pulled him into the bedroom with a smile and a promise that he was going to make it good for Steve.
It’s like being with someone for the first time is hard (ha, pun) but there’s always... it always feels a bit of a test for Tony. He want to make sure his partner enjoys themselves. To that extent, there’s a fair amount of trial and error that has to be done in real time. What does the other person like, what’s the no-goes. What can he do to make sure the other person is having a good time, you know? It’s the kind of stress that makes him do his best.
, she muses. He’s listening to one of the teachers now, serious expression shifting into solemn sympathy the longer the lady talks. His features soften, taking years off his  face and adding to his overall handsomeness.
It’s a short ride up to the penthouse and Tony grins the entryway through. Steve’s fingers slip out of his grip once the elevator comes to a stop. It occurs to Tony that this is the first time Steve’s been here. Tony hangs back and watches Steve look around the penthouse. It feels good to have Steve in his space. In fact, now that Steve’s here, carefully running his fingers over the back of the sofa, Tony wants to invite him to move in. But that
Something tips Tony off that Steve’s standing at the doorway because he stops what he’s doing and turns around. There’s a split second before Tony puts his game face on and it tells Steve everything he needs to know about where they stand. There’s wide-eyed surprise mixed with guarded caution and fear.
“I know, I know,” Steve raises his free hand up in surrender. Inside her head, a voice angrily yells at the interruption because
“Look,” she tries, pausing for a moment to scrub a hand down her face. “I don’t know about you guys but there’s been times in my life where I got stuck and I wanted someone to help me but they didn’t. Later on I found out that they’d seen me in trouble and wanted to help but felt like they couldn’t. The way Tony talked about Steve? It felt like he was stuck and didn’t know how to fix that situation... It felt like a cry for help.”
“All for you,” he pants against Tony’s chin, meaning it so much more than he wants to admit because that’s it, isn’t it? So much of what he feels for Tony,
Is Tony even aware of the power he holds over Steve? Probably to some extent. That’s how he’s been able to manipulate Steve in the past. But right now, there’s nothing but beguiling concern, demonstrated through Tony’s gaze and the way he’s squeezing Steve’s shoulder. It’s a gentle touch. Nothing they haven’t done before. But it feels different. Butterflies flit around his chest as Tony drags his hand away, fingertips almost caressing. The shiver the gentle touch causes is enough to jar loose the proverbial bone stuck in his throat.
"And it's our—no, my fault that we didn't tell you sooner. I thought we would scare you away if we moved too fast, but it was the other way around." Steve pauses for a second to take deep breath. "I should've told you. We should've told you." He puts on a smile as he says, "I love
A lot of things could be said about the Avengers, but neat? Nope. Yes, Toni had a messy lab—though in her defense, she knew where everything was-, but the lounge was a mess. Toni didn't have a monster- no, a child, she reminded herself, but she assumed this was what it was like to have a m-child, or the mess that come with one. Right now, it looked like an avenger's battlefield, well without the blood… okay, there was some blood. Damn Papercuts! She got them opening presents. She blamed these cuts on Clint who was smirking at her with that stupid look of his. He did it. She knew it.
"You don't get to play that card when you almost killed someone for no reason," Toni snapped. "What were you thinking?" She knew he wasn't. Or maybe he did, but why did he think he needed to protect her?
"How can that be? She was in lab before the Device went off and now she's not?" Pepper asked. "Can you tell us anything? Is she alive?" Her voice was shakily.
Toni, who didn't have time to brace herself, landed hard, and she couldn't recall anything besides the extreme pain. Her head smack hard against the metal computer panel and whipped forward. After the pain ended, it was just pure never ending blackness.
Howard gave her a look as he crouched down to get a good look at her face. "Hey, my theories are good."
seen something, relived something in that camp. He knew the face, knew it personally. He had spent countless restless nights and quiet moments, drowning in sweat and panic, and he spent these moments alone. There was no one he wanted to burden with it, even others wanted him to. Besides, he was Captain America. He wasn't supposed to be weak, wasn't supposed to panic. He wasn't supposed to suffer from PTSD.
Natasha's eye twitched at it. "I can knock him out for you," she replied, as she twisted her body around a man, taking him to the ground. "You will just have to carry his fat ass back to the jet."
Toni's mind froze on the word 'home' as images of home falling apart flashed her before he eyes. Did she have a home? Yes, she had the tower, but this was her everything. It was the beginning of new life, where Iron Man was created—not counting the cave. It was where she was reborn and became Iron Man, and now, this magically place was gone. It was where she was going to have…It was then that she remembered the large fat Christmas tree that Steve had dragged in the day before. She could still smell the pine needles that littered the ground. "The tree…"
Tony nods, not knowing for sure if Laura is Barton's wife. He doesn't remember her name, not that he really cares. "So Barton is a man child? So what does his wife—Lauren, is it? - see in him?"
Steve gave her look before he crossed the dresser and opened it. "Expecting me?" he asked, eyeing the clothes.
"Nope. Now stop playing and let me out," she replied, fighting her fatigue. She felt like she had been punched and crushed by the Hulk.
She pondered how much she should care. Yes, Iron Man was a hero, and she knew Steve could never walk away from someone who needed help, but she refused to be dragged into his mess. He only asked for help when it benefit him, though she guessed the man had a point, considering she was Toni Stark. She only had one level: loud. However, she could keep things quiet if she wanted to. The issue with Fury was that he kept everyone in the dark and then expected people to follow him. It got old real fast.
"You have to understand the situation that you're in." He retook the seat. "You were found trespassing in an empty lot, which looked like a bomb went off."
? He hated that she thought of him of that. He was anything but an old man and he wanted to show her that; however, he wasn't going to fight her, not her. She was the last person he wanted to hurt in the world and he would do anything to protect her. "Well, it wouldn't really be a fight as I would fight a woman. I would let you win."
Bucky shakes his head, pushing away from Steve slightly. "S-Steve thought he could control it a-and…stop me b-before I did anything, but…" He runs his hands up Tony's arms before he falls back against Steve. "B-but I didn't trust myself… Steve either." He pauses to take another deep breath. "Didn't t-trust anyone to keep you safe, so I r-ran. I hid from you, when I shouldn't have. Steve tried to talk me out, t-trying to get me to see you, but I was-am scared. Scared that I might lose you. And with every s-second I didn't see you, I got worse. I d-didn't like the person I was becoming." He's having a hard breathing as he sobs, and it's heartbreaking. "Though it seems like I did by my own stupidity. But I couldn't—can't help it. Every time, I close my eyes, I see you d-dead in a puddle of your own blood, and…I lose it. Lose it. I need you, Punk."
"No," he interrupted firmly. "No buts." He let out a soft sigh. "He would've never blamed you for his death. He would probably yell at me for letting you think that. He joined the army—much like everyone else—prepared to give up his life to serve his country. To save people. No one like war, but he thrived. So…" Steve drifted off, taking a deep breath. "He knew what he was doing when he picked up my shield. He knew he might not come back. He knew he could die, but that didn't matter. He did it to save me. So in reality, it is my fault, not yours."
Hey all. DON'T HATE ME. I am sorry that it took so long. There is really no excuse, but i hope you like this chapter.
Toni laid her forehead on the cold table and closed her eyes. It was stupid to fall asleep in a cold room, but it was easier to think. As soon as she got out of here, she would hack into Stark and the military computers to look for her device, which shouldn't be an issue for her. Granted, she didn't know what kind of computers they had back in these days, but she was a genius. She could hack into anything.
There's a small twitch in Steve's eye as he gets the last name treatment from Tony. Everyone knows what that means, and it isn't good. "Tony, it isn't-"
"You impress me, Sark," he said. "I do not wish to break you and make you into one of these mindless fools." He let go of Toni's face and crossed to the control panels.
Toni could feel Phillips' eyes on her as Howard spoke. Though she didn't tell Phillips very much about her relationship with her father, he had a pretty good idea of how it was like. It was no secret that she hated the guy, though she supposed she couldn't still say that she still hated him. It was a mild dislike. "Who says? I could be the one of ten kids you don't know about," she replied. "…Ten? Maybe more? Seriously, think about."
"And how will you explain it, Steve? How will you walk into her life? She won't know you. Plus, she isn't the same person you met in the past yet. Trust me on that. Trust me."
Toni, silently thanking Steve, crossed to him and patted him on the shoulder. "I was on my way to see Colonel Salty."
Toni closed her eyes are she tried to think. If she remembered correctly, this was when the howling commanders were formed, and that was an interesting group so she heard.
Sharon flipped through the phones on her phone, looking for something. "Even if you had been in love before, it isn't something you can describe. There're poems trying to do just that—girly crap, but nevertheless." She let out a chuckle. "Puky at times. But hey, they aren't wrong. The feeling you get in your chest isn't something you can put words to, no matter how hard you try. Poetic or not. I know what it felt like for me: like I was walking on air. I couldn't get enough. He could just look at me and I smiled." There was a warm smile building on her face. "Butterflies in your stomach. When they hurt, you hurt. You would go to war for them, and just standing by them, you feel at your best. They lift you up without wanting anything in return." The smile took up her entire face, finding the picture she wanted. "Sure, you may fight. You may not agree, but that doesn't mean shit. People fight. It's normal. It's about respect and how you treat that person in those moments."
Toni glanced at her father, who grimaced at the name Sark. "Yup, time for me to get out of here," she replied with a weak attempt at her usual arrogant smirk.
He wasn't sure, but he knew his heart couldn't take it, and he was left lost and confused. He wasn't sure what he should do next. Should he let her go? He wasn't even sure if it could go back to what it was? They crossed a line in that last fight, and there was a chance that they couldn't repair it.
However, this woman brought something out inside of him, and it would be foolish not to figure out why that was. In order to follow his programing, he had to learn why, so he could be an effective tool. He needed to be an effective tool again. He didn't want the chair, and he was willing to do whatever it took to escape the chair, the pain. However, he wasn't sure there was anything he could do about the woman as the very thought of her hurt made him ill. Though he had no of why, he knew what she was: his
"Well, you worked hard on the device. It would be a waste for you not to help," she replied. "Plus, I doubt you would give it to me if I don't accept your help."
Bucky shifts, leaning against the arm of the sofa. "He isn't his type," he says, dryly. Tony feels his heart skip a beat, but he doesn't respond. He doesn't know how to respond, because Barnes's correct, as he knows his type well, considering he is his type.
He knew what she was hinting at, because he was struggling. He was already feeling like he had failed her. "I have her," he said, strongly. "I'm not letting go."
Steve stood suddenly. "Easy for you to say. You weren't there," he replied quietly and coldly, as he flexed his hands. "I think it's best if I leave before she returns."
How did he know this woman's expression so well? How did he know what her tells were? How did he know what the tilt of her head meant? How did he know what the blank stare of her eyes meant? The Asset didn't know, but he counted it toward the amount of time that he had been watching her. It wasn't abnormal for the watcher to get know his target after a few weeks, and he would say that was the case here. However, this feeling was different than what he normally felt from watching his other marks; this time went deeper somehow. It was more than the familiarity of just observing a target. It was different; it felt personal. It felt like he knew her, but how?
"However," she interrupted, "that doesn't mean jack shit." She took a deep breath. "Doesn't change anything."
"Rest? I don't need to rest. I need to find my device." Narrowing Dugan eyes, he lifted his cane and smack her in the legs. "OUCH!" she yelled mockingly as she glared him. "What was that for?" she asked, pulling her legs to her chest.
Tony stills, waiting for Rogers to leave before he orders FRIDAY to call Pepper. He can't have her and Roger teaming up against him again. He can't have Rogers worrying about him. He can't have anyone worrying about him. He can't suffer that kind of pain again. He can't be second best. He can't be chosen last.
Howard ignored her question and kept talking. "I was thinking we could use the Tesseract to give the device a jump and use the core to stabilize it through transport." His eyes were back on the device, studying it with great detail.
The genius forced herself to take a few deep breaths as she pushed off the metal railing of the boat. It dented easily under the Iron Man's grip, as she tried to calm herself with a strong count. "Not now."
Putting the brush down, Barnes straightened himself up and walked to her. "I know, but I can't tell him," he said as he ripped the papers out of her hands. "Just let it be." It was surprising that it didn't give her paper cuts.
Toni ignored the question about Steve as she wasn't exactly sure what Rhodey was going on about. What was he fishing for? Why was he angry? "So what's really goin' on?" she asked, as she would rather talk about anything else but Steve. That flat tone could only mean something bad. "With Mandarin. Seriously, can we talk about this guy?" She said, taking her feet off the desk and leaning forward. Her eyes glanced over to the muted television on the corner.
It made sense, but it still felt like a betrayal to let someone touch the suit. "And who's going to fly it?"
Toni wasn't one to carry ID as everyone knew who she was and she never needed it. If she did need it, Pepper was the one who always carried it. In this case, she was really glad she didn't. She didn't need him to locate that ID. "They are something I'm working on." What else could she say to that? Where is the Device? She asked herself, not liking that it wasn't here. She didn't need it in the wrong hands.
Yes, she knew it was okay to feel emotional, especially after losing Bucky, but she didn't want to feel these emotions. If Bucky ever came back to life, she was going to kill him again, because no one should ever be able to make her feel this way. NO ONE.
She picked up the pieces off the table and slipped them in her bag. Without bothering to change her clothes, she kicked her shoes off and laid down on the couch. She let herself drift.
Was someone speaking to her? Why would someone be talking to her? She was no one in this time, and there were other people around her, who the voice was most likely speaking to.
She narrowed her eyes at him before jumping to her feet. "Why the hell are you here?" she asked as she stepped toward him. He was the last person she wanted to see. "Why aren't you in a cell?" Her body hurt.
"Maybe, you should call Toni? Hearing her voice might make you feel better? She's an ass, a loveable ass, but she does care about you a lot." There was a softness in her voice as she spoke. It was almost like she was jealous, wishing that she had it. "No need to allow them to under your skin."
Skipping steps, Steve quickly made his way down to the labs with only one thought on his mind. The idea that the strong, stubborn, iron-willed genius whom he loved with all of his heart was hurting made him sick to his stomach, and he wanted to punch the man or thing that had done this to her. He wanted to destroy whatever had hurt, and he would do anything to protect her from getting hurt again.
working on very limited sleep, and Toni was aware of what that could do to a person. But there was no mistaking the scene in front of her. She could see the stiffness in the master spy's shoulders. He was barely moving, almost too painful to think.
Even if she was exhausted both mentally and physically, she would never agree to go with him, and he was getting on her last nerve, which was probably a normal thing for her. Everyone got on her nerves. "The answer is still no. I have a dress code for my dates. I require at least a Westmancott, but I prefer an Amosu on a man. You are wearing none," she replied as waved at his clothes. "So my answer is no."
The Colonel looked insulted. "I was not. I was looking at that thing in your chest." He pointed to the Arc Reactor.
Toni took a deep breath as she tried to calm herself. She didn't want the guys to see her like this, but she knew she couldn't hide this from them. She was a mess inside and out; there was no way she could control her emotions in her present state. Maybe, Rogers would be too pissed to notice and Barnes would be too distracted by a pissed Rogers. O' god, she hoped so. She couldn't deal with their questions right now.
This creature I had come to know, her thoughts, her feelings, her aspirations, were gone. No longer was I going to hear her describe why she liked the color of the fugu berry or hear her latest theory as to why the yellow moon always followed closer to the red moon and why the blue moon always seem to stay in one place.
It had a homey rustic vibe to it, but what would one expect from a barbecue steakhouse.  Within minutes a waiter came by with a set of menus.  He quickly went into the specials, obviously trying his damnedest to suppress his excitement over the identity of his guests.  He bounced on his toes happily as he looked between Steve, the shield, the suit, and Tony and then around again as he waited for them to decide what to order.
Steve hated this with every fiber of his being. Of course, he remembered her. He remembered everything about her with disdainful clarity. He remembered the time he spent with her, teaching her, learning from her, loving her. All that does not change the fact that he knew what Calamity was up to. He knew that the beautiful visage before him was either a very convincing figment of his imagination or a sinister specter conjured by Calamity herself. Either way, all this wasn't real.
The meeting room was located deep within the helicarrier. It was triple reinforced and was very stronghold like. In a few short minutes that particular room will hold nine very important people. People that, in their own personal special way, were responsible for saving the world at least twice.
“It says something in this passage, here, about ‘a stage of silence after the day of darkness.’ Day of darkness could mean an eclipse of sorts, artificial or real doesn’t matter. However the records indicate here…” Tony gestured to a different passage.
“Okay.” Tony replied reaching for a wand like device off the table. “Remember this scanner?” Tony held it up for Barnes to inspect.
It was now just a little after breakfast, and we find our Captain on dish duty yet again. After calming down considerably after that… dream, he apologized to Peggy for his abrupt dismissal and reassured her that he was fine. He had also established that no, he was not too overwhelmed to take care of Ellie today and yes, Peggy should go help with the baby shower and that yes, he was well enough to finish his errands.
“Well you are right Tony. Something very weird is happening here. From the current visuals, vitals and specs JARVIS supplied me…” Bruce eyed Tony knowing the genius came by the information through very illegal means.
Suddenly the quiet enveloped them and everything fell motionless, immediately casting a foreboding shadow. They stood stock still in the middle of the street waiting. Mercifully the roads were empty of civilians awesomely adding to the ominous dead silent atmosphere.
Steve meant to leave but stopped as a knife whizzed by his head and embedded itself in the door. He turned slowly to frown at her completely unamused.
"How long have you been here?" He asked, allowing Natasha to rest his head in the crook of her neck.
“Now that Thor’s here we should all be getting back to the case.” Stated Steve trying to adjust himself in his bed.
He didn’t have time to properly suit up so he grabbed his shield and made his way to the nearest exit only to find he was barricaded in by Jarvis.
Xavier listened to everyone as they all traveled down their own thought processes. Until Steve broke everyone’s reverie.
“My apologies, but we could not help but to overhear,” Xavier rolled up to them. “But if we are going to be adding members to this ragtag group of ‘Earth’s Mightiest Heroes’, then we know a few others that have the right to join us.”
“Get Down!” Captain America shouted as a shot rang out a second later. They all dove down immediately. Steve’s right cheek was on fire. He could feel the blood begin to drip down his face.
He made sure to spend time with each of the remaining members of the Avengers. He roped Johnny, Scott and Sam into making desserts with him. He forced everyone into a movie night and somehow a game of Pictionary charades. They were quite gung-ho about doing things he wanted. He almost felt bad about deceiving them, almost.
“Internet,” Kamala dryly points out. “Their vibe was completely different from how Cap and Tony fight.”
While Toni is mentally screaming at Rhodey to stay quiet, Carol and Sam metaphorically pounce on the man.
loudly asks the interloping party, “What the hell was so important that it couldn’t wait till morning?”
When their eyes meet, Steve stops fidgeting and grins. The nervousness that had been pouring off him disappears. Now there’s awe, amazement, delight, anticipation, all rolled up in this complex but happy smile.
!” Kamala explains with barely controlled exasperation, “The Avengers aren’t the Avengers without Captain America and Iron Man there!”
Shame quickly follows the thought. Though it is quick to burn away because this level of distrust is not uncalled for. Begrudgingly however, Steve needs to consider all possibilities and give Tony the benefit of the doubt.
unfortunately, has happened quite a few times before but Steve's still talking. “I don’t know how but he broke his arm! It was hanging all limp and I couldn’t fix it and I just left him there. I shouldn’t have but JARVIS said it was better to wait for you but I thought you’d be mad that I hurt him and-”
Kamala nods, immediate and eager. Tony thinks back to his own school experience, wondering if he’s ever gone through anything like that. Wait. Would his experience at a boarding school be even relevant for a modern day highschooler? Not to mention the fact that he hadn’t really had friends. But that’s another story.
“That’s true. Holy shit, Steve.” Tony shakes his head, smile growing and growing until it’s a broad happy grin. “Okay.”
the voice in his head continues to bemoan in rising cadence. White noise buzzes between his ears as he stares and stares at Tony’s gentle, loving expression. Desperately, Steve gropes in the darkness for the light switch, something that’ll turn his world back right-side up.
Tomorrow's the big day. They're going to put their plan into motion. They’ll wear their new suits, slip the Pym particles into place, set their GPS devices to the pre-determined years, get the stones, and change the world again. No, they’ll set things
Sam’s face brightens immediately. “I can’t tell you how much of a relief it is to hear that. I was a little worried you wouldn’t want to help.”
There’s no soft give to Steve’s body. There’s just miles and miles of firm muscles and sure strength. It dries his mouth, much like how he’d felt the first time he’d seen a naked girl; nervous and brimming with anticipation. And with the same amount of greedy curiosity, Tony’s eyes and fingers feast.
“But, honestly. It really did feel like the right moment. The conversation, how close we were, the way you looked at me... it just clicked. If I had to put it in more concrete terms, I’d say I did the futurist thing you do except for us.”
However, this is a rare first date where Tony doesn’t have to do that. He doesn’t have to be careful with his words or his actions. He can be himself.
Immediately, Tony melts in his seat, hips helplessly thrusting up in his seat as the touch goes straight to his core.
Steve flies down to New Jersey the first chance he gets. He stands outside the gates of the abandoned airstrip and finds himself short of breath. There’s a piercing pain in his chest that Steve finds himself trying to rub away.
Sex with Tony had been amazingly intense. There had been a give and take involved that suited them - Tony taking over whenever he felt that Steve was unsure and vice versa. Ugh, when he thinks about it like that, it’s not really sexy and last night had been
Clapping Sam’s shoulder, Steve says, loud enough for his voice to carry over to Tony, “I’ll tell you about it later. Right now, I’ve got a date to get ready for.”
“Yeah.” He’s relieved that last night’s joy has carried forward to the morning. As he watches Tony beat the eggs up into a frothy mix, Steve kisses the back of Tony’s pink-tipped ear and asks, “Sleep well?”
If only he had enough air in his lungs to throw all his hurt at Tony. But Steve’s breathless with anger and hurt, trembling under Tony’s hurting gaze.
It’s the breathless happy quality to his name that has Steve’s attention snapping to Tony in a heartbeat. As Tony hops off the cot and walks up to Steve, Steve’s fingers curl into fists, leather gloves creaking softly. But in the next millisecond, Steve’s hand tenses in surprise because--
, flashes through Steve’s eyes before he plants his hands on Tony’s hips and drags him closer, letting their dicks drag against each in sweet friction. The electrifying touch, and the fact that Steve’s dick is
attempt. In fact, Steve’s content to lay all the blame at Tony’s feet and call it a day. So, color Tony sour. He knows how he’s messed up but it’s not like Steve’s completely blameless either.
He realizes the motion wasn’t as discreet as he’d hope for because Steve’s eyes are on him in a flash, the polite expression on his face fading away into quiet concern. ‘
could this have happened? He should have known! He should have anticipated this because he knows his heat history and he should have planned accordingly! This is-
Swallowing harshly, Steve closes the gap between them to press his forehead against Tony’s. “I’m sorry I made you feel that way,” he whispers, eyes squeezed shut in misery. “I never meant to make you feel like you’re not good enough.”
“That doesn’t mean I won’t help him when he’s in trouble,” Steve neatly argues around the point that Sam’s just made. Sam gives him a disappointed look but Steve ignores it and resumes talking towards the med-bay.
He remembers the barely repressed hurt and anger in Carol’s tone as she’d told him how close to the edge Tony had been after his death.
It feels a little egotistical to admit that aloud but Kamala pushes that feeling aside as soon as she remembers how broken Tony had looked during that first conversation with Kamala.
for the superhero community. But she’d held onto the hope that they’d make up. She’d thought... well. Hoped. That Cap and Iron Man would eventually make up and be friends again. She’d thought...
There’s a hint of amusement in Steve’s voice when he answers, “Why do you think? It’s because I like you.”
His happiness carries forward to the next morning when he wakes up to the sensation of a dry kiss brushing his forehead. Steve peeks up and sees Tony smiling down at him. He looks devilishly handsome in the morning light. A gorgeous unkempt mess.
“Great.” Steve nods and leans in to kiss Tony once more. For good measure. And then once again because he’s weak and Tony’s very kissable, especially when he looks all rumpled and confused. Grinning, he gives Tony’s hip a quick pat before taking a step back. “I’ll see you then.”
“Momentarily.” The android tells her. “There are a few more pending tasks that have to be taken care of. After that, we may leave.”
Steve laughs in response. His voice is low and husky when he says, “Fair. Maybe what you need is the right incentive to avoid taking on big risks.”
Carol snorts at that, loud and disbelieving. Steve flounders in uncertain waters as Tony shoots the blonde woman a faux wounded look. Is Tony... flirting with him? Can’t be. Steve’s got to be misreading things, right? Sure, Tony’s prone to calling him all sorts of nicknames. But... it’s been years since Tony’s done that. That’s not how their relationship
And the thing that Steve hates the most? The utmost? Is that he’s on the back foot again. He thought he knew where he stood with Tony. He thought he knew his own heart. But now that Tony’s walking up to him? Steve’s realizing that he shouldn’t have come because he
He’s leaning over the gearbox, lips parted with hunger as he lowers his head down down into Steve’s lap, mind spinning even as his heart sings with happiness. He’s going to learn what Steve looks like, tastes like,
if he can help it. Because if he starts talking with Tony about the gorgon’s knot that is their friendship? There’s going to be so much screaming and yelling and accusation hurling. And frankly, Steve doesn’t have the time, the emotional capacity,
“I’m the luckiest man alive,” Tony murmurs into Steve’s warm hand, opening his eyes to peer up at Steve.
Tony’s hand touches Steve’s shoulder; the silence in Steve’s head is deafening. Steve glances at the warm touch before looking back at Tony. “Thank you for caring, darling. But I’m alright. No wounds or anything.”
in the knowledge that in his learning. As an engineer, Tony’s committed himself to a lifetime of learning. And now, as he teases Steve’s length with the back of his fingers, Tony hungers to learn everything he can about Steve, his body, his mind, his heart.
“How do you expect these two to talk when they both act like they’ve got a dead skunk under their noses whenever they meet up.”
“Steve? Darling?” Tony asks. Steve wants to shake his head but he’s frozen in place, staring at Tony in mounting horror. He’d have stayed like that, a living tribute to regret and ill-informed, brash decisions, if Tony hadn’t touched his face with unbearing gentleness. “Are you okay?”
On Sam’s shoulder, Redwing floofs up before he starts to clean his feathers. Sam crosses his arms and asks, “What’d you say?”
“Control freak,” Steve says, fingers fiddling with the buttons on Tony’s shirt. There’s so much fondness coloring those two words that Tony feels the urge to click his heels in happiness.
For the first time today, Tony’s eyes lower in shame. “I didn’t want to hurt you,” Tony admits in a small voice, one hand rising up to clutch at his forearm. “But I knew I had to. The SHRA.... I wanted to tell you about it. Months before it came to pass. But I knew how you’d react. I knew... that if I worked with you... you might lose your faith in everything you stood for. And that... I didn’t want to see you go through with that.”
The suddenness of the inquiry, even though it’s not directed at him, makes Tony sputter. His best friends meanwhile, turn to give him identical curious looks.
Remembering Tony’s reaction brings a fresh wave of cold anger. Steve would never admit this aloud but Tony’s reaction had hurt. He’d thought that Tony would have been pleasantly surprised that Steve had come to help but instead, Tony had just been upset. Why though? Fuck if Steve knows.
“Aggravate him? Is there some kind of booby trap in the spell?” Steve asks sharply, glancing at Sam.
Carol’s eyes are bouncing between them, expression shifting from pissed off to confused to shocked. At Rhodey’s comment, her jaw drops. Tony knows what she’s going to say before she says it. His stomach flips when Carol asks, “Are you dating
A small part of Steve’s mind points out. Another part of him is just as quick to wonder if Tony’s fallen off the wagon again. That would certainly explain this sudden show of sentimentality
Well. That at least answers Tony’s question of whether or not Steve had told Sam. However, the sheer volume of all three exclamations makes Tony wince. “Guys... come on. It’s not that big of a deal.”
It’s an unexpected line of inquiry but Tony turns to give the girl his full attention. He waits a beat for Kamala to finish her sentence. But when she trails off, he helpfully offers, “Reconnect?”
“Yeah...” Kamala sighs. “It sucks when you think about it. They went from being the core Avengers and best friends to total strangers. I can’t remember the last time they’ve hung out together. There was a time they were hanging out in civies
is what he’s wanted tonight to be. Just them, alone, loving each other. It’s a far cry from him more elaborate plans but Tony’ll be happy with achieving 33% of his goals. He ignores his aches and bruises, instead focusing on running feather light touches up and down Steve’s sides, teasing him until their hips grind insistently together. Tony’s a second away from flipping Steve over on his back and sucking him off when someone knocks on the door.
He turns to face Steve, their knees touching, watching and waiting. It takes Steve a minute to collect himself before he starts, each word said with great care. “I know that things have changed a lot since the 40s but I didn’t think it would be a good idea to talk to you about what’s going on with you out in public. Especially not in that crowd.”
Tony’s mapping out a six-month plan to convince Steve to move in with him when he notices that Steve’s stopped moving. In fact, Steve’s now looking at him with a painfully shy, uncertain look. Tony wants to erase it immediately.
Steve closes his eyes, overwhelmed by the scale of the confession. He gives in, raising his arms to hug and hold Tony against him. But as soon as his fingers touch Tony’s arms, the man twitches half a step away from him. Steve manages to grab onto Tony’s wrist, fearing that if he lets Tony walk away then they’ll be back in limbo, the way they were for the seven years before this mission.
Carol slaps his arm, hard enough that his skin tingles. “None of that. Steve’s lucky to have you! And he better know that.”
“To be fair, that’s a DUM-E problem, not a you problem. Now come on,” Tony stuffs the cookie in his mouth before he slaps Steve’s back. “Wolk wif me. Lemme tea'ch you ho'a fix 'em w'en dis haffens nex' time.”
“I love you too Tony Stark,” Steve’s tired rumble penetrates through the happy fog that’s flooding Tony’s head.
to approach Tony with some kind of food that Tony loves before breaking bad news to him is a tried and true strategy used by his friends. Happy’s fond of plying him with cheeseburgers before confessing that one of Tony’s cars got into an accident. Pepper will treat him to sushi and sake before sliding a contract his way that’s sure to get him seeing red. And Rhodey’s bribe of choice is apple pie from this diner back in Boston that
Guilt eats away at the pit of his stomach as he watches Cap chide Kamala, whose eyes glimmer with unshed tears, telling her she needs to be more serious about her training. After the kids leave, Tony tells Sam, “A little hard on her, don’t you think?”
Tony looks gobsmacked. He stares and stares and stares at Steve, lips parted in surprise. He looks too pale under the kitchen lights, making his dark eyes stand out all the more. There’s so much shock in Tony’s eyes as he watches Steve, asking, “You… even after all these years?”
“Vision and Nova are training. Kamala left early due to a family emergency. Miles and Jarvis are in the kitchen making popcorn. Thor will be arriving from Mexico in 5 hours 11 minutes and 25 seconds. Tony is in his lab.”
Feeling slightly cornered, Tony looks to Rhodey for help. Rhodey smirks and answers for him, “Not yet. But he’s got someone that he’s crushing on.”
been processed and Steve’s brain has broken. Because there’s devastation left in the aftermath of Tony’s confession. Steve can’t think. Can’t breathe. Can’t
Tony immediately moves to sit next to her. She pushes her open book towards him, pointing at one of the problems as she explains, “I’ve been trying to figure this out but I keep messing up in my calculations.”
As Tony is muzzily pondering how to help Steve relax, Steve’s hand returns to the back of Tony’s neck. The squeeze this time is tighter: a warning. Not that that makes it feel any less good to Tony, who groans, relishing the pulse of heat the touch sends through him. Tony whimpers as Steve’s hand pulls away, leaving tingles in their wake; the vibrato echoes in his chest.
Steve doesn’t get a lot of mail at his SHIELD office. Most of his communication happens through email or in person. So imagine his surprise when Sharon had shown up at his door in the morning with a white envelope in hand saying, “This came for you.”
Sam starts at how suddenly Carol whips around to face him. Rhodey however, beats her to the punch by loudly asking, “Steve asked him out?”
While looking at Rhodey and Carol, Sam asks, “Do you guys know what’s going on with him? He’s been extra nervous this past week. And he won’t tell me why.”
Tony steps forward - one, two, three. He’s touching Steve’s face, committing to memory the way Steve’s eyes flutter shut before he turns his face into Tony’s palm. Tony’s heart skips a beat when Steve’s eyes part and peer at him.  He’s so effortlessly gorgeous. It’s unfair.
, Tony’s brain whispers to him. Rumiko’s image flashes before his eyes. His blue-tinged mood turns a deep melancholic navy. Tony sighs, sinking back into his seat as he wonders,
It’s not that Tony’s averse to telling his friends about his love life. Well... no. That’s a lie. He doesn’t like airing his romantic laundry out like that. But in this case, the reason is simpler. Tony doesn’t want to jinx things before they’ve ever started. During their last call, Tony had hinted to Rhodey that he and Steve might have figured things out but no one knows that they’re going to go out on a date.
Tony shakes his head, pulling himself out of the memory and it’s tar-sticky fingers. If he falls into the moroseness that’s been clinging to him since his break-up then, well. It’s going to take him a while to crawl out of that hole. And this time, if Tony can help it, he’d prefer not to fall into that particular brand of sadness.
Tony smiles and shakes his head at his husband but he decides to humor Steve. "If that's what Captain America says." He stares at the candle and wishes,
Tony sticks his head through the door and looks up and down the hallway. Faint lighting illuminates benches, a few paintings on the wall, a couple of large potted plants and that’s it. He’s going to guess this is a side of the building that doesn’t see a lot of action. As Tony steps through, waiting for Steve to follow, he wonders what’s up. He slips his phone and Avengers ID card out of his pockets, checking for any news of an emergency. There’s a couple of small incidents around town but the police seem to be handling them just fine. So whatever it is that Steve wants to talk about, probably isn’t Avengers related.
“Come upstairs,” Tony whispers, keenly aware of the fact that he’s got his hand inches away from Steve’s ass.
“We need to do brunch so that I can get more details out of you,” Carol tells him, grinning despite herself. “I should have said this before but I’m glad. You guys... you make sense.”
She trots across the room and takes a seat. As she pulls her books out, Tony asks, “Do you need help with your physics homework again?”
. He finds himself panting, wishing, hoping, praying that Steve’s going to use his teeth on the same spot once they’re naked together. It’s going to be the best sex Tony’s ever had. He hopes Steve’s gonna put his hand on the nape of Tony’s neck and hold him down like that before fucking him into next week.
Steve’s saying something. Tony feels the echo of it under his palms but the words don’t penetrate. He just feels Steve’s heat pulling away and an insistent hand that’s taking him elsewhere. It’s still Steve though. Tony recognizes that much. But why is Steve moving? Why can’t they just stay here and kiss, touch, love? Must they go? Can’t they stay?
Instead of sharing all that, Tony wraps up his arms around Steve’s shoulders and pulls him in, whispering back, “I’m thinking about how much I want to kiss him.”
And of course there was Steve’s general reaction to being around Tony... There used to be a time when Steve was happy to see him. Now it’s just bitterness. That same bitterness has soaked into him. And he’d gone and taken it out on poor Kamala. She doesn’t deserve to be burdened by his bullshit, much less his relationship issues with Steve. Would it have killed him to lie to the poor girl? Nope. But he’d gone and acted like a fucking idiot anyways.
Steve’s fingers finally find the zipper to Tony’s pants and drag the tab down. “Fuck,” Tony exhales, eyes rolling back as Steve teases him through his soaked briefs. “Do that again.”
There’s some quiet conversation happening between Steve and whoever before the door closes. Tony lifts himself up on his elbows, about to ask who was it when he notices what’s in Steve’s hand - it’s a large slice of cheesecake with a candle on top. Tony stares at the confectionery for a second before he glances up at Steve, bewildered. Steve’s smiling back at him, charmingly boyish and delighted at the same time. Tony finds himself sitting up in bed as Steve walks back to the bed, mindful of the flickering flame.
Forcing his attention away to the tasks at hand don’t help him forget that Tony’s still staring at him, rather intensely at that. Steve’s too aware of how the nonchalance Tony is affecting is deliberate. It’s veering into flirtatious when Tony leans back against the closed dishwasher and asks, “Do you really think so?”
Something angry and desperate rears its head up upon the mere concept of spending his heat with someone other than Steve. It pushes his heat-lust aside for a moment. And in that moment of clarity, Tony reaches out to grab Steve by the arm. Fiercely, he tells him, “Don’t you fucking
“You can thank my date for that,” Tony jokes, drawing Kim’s attention over to Steve, who stiffens minutely against Tony. Who drops his hand on Steve’s shoulder, more in the hopes of helping his relax than anything else, and introduces the two. “Steve, this is Kim Andrews, an old friend. Kim, this is Steve Rogers.”
“Promise?” Tony pants, staring at Steve’s handsome profile. The scenery outside, behind Steve, is a dark and gold blur; the light and shadow play happening on Steve’s face is stunning. Steve’s eyes pull away from the road and lock onto Tony, who squirms under the hot gaze. “You promise you’ll fuck me when we get back?”
How is that possible? But right after his admission, Steve’s hands land on Tony’s ass and squeeze. And the fact that Steve’s fingertips are
Sympathy wells up in Sam’s dark eyes when he asks, “You just felt rattled after running into Steve at the school?”
“It’s a hell yes,” Tony swears, voice rough. He’s got no God damned idea what he’s going Friday night but he’ll cancel all his plans to be with Steve.
And given that this is the most civil conversation they’ve had in a while? Steve takes it as a win and quietly leaves. He needs to regroup anyways.
ways this can go wrong,” Miles directs at the ceiling before he looks down to meet her eyes. “You know that right?”
Misery drips off Tony’s frame. And Steve cannot stand it. Carefully, with his heart thudding painfully against his ribs, Steve presses himself against Tony’s side. With his lips pressed against Tony’s hair, Steve whispers, “I’m gonna remind you every day that it wasn’t your fault.”
Spluttering, Tony gestures in confusion between them. “I’m not a fifteen-year-old girl, Rhodey! I don’t gossip about things!”
What was once scary and out of his reach now feels like a dream come true. Tomorrow is going to be fantastic. Sure there’s going to be dried come in uncomfortable places and awkwardness and Steve’s probably going to apologize a hundred times over for biting Tony’s glands so hard that Tony’d yelped in pain
Tony pulls away and licks his lips. Steve blinks up at him, obviously confused as to why they’re not kissing anymore. “Are
