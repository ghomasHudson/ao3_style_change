“Are you enhanced too, then?” Steve asks, nodding at his chest.
Tony continues tinkering with wires Steve cannot see.
Tony can’t look at him banefully through the suit, but he gives it a full A+ effort anyway. “Do I
“Yes, as my memory is longer than that of a goldfish.”
In-person was fucking horrific, over the phone almost made him vomit, so Pepper got the text, she unfortunately landing low on the totem pole of sliding responsibility, which of course meant that Tony was woken up by Pepper throwing a high-heel at him and yelling at a really, really high pitch.
“It doesn’t matter who it is,” Tony answers quietly, confused.
happen – and he pokes him on the shoulder with one of his fingers, and says, “Go on, I want to know what happened,” and
He reaches inside the last, disintegrating the suit up to his elbow for dexterity purposes. He fumbles through the container – a multi-purpose tool, a mini-tricorder, a picture of his first crew on a Starfleet vessel, the berries from one of his first missions with Steve.
“Yeah, JARVIS,” Tony says, because when it comes down to it, the armor isn’t about power or style or authority – it’s about protection. “I’m going.”
He bites his tongue.
When it is all said and done, and Tony is rendezvousing with Steve to beam back, he finds himself walking towards a smaller version of one of the aliens, one he saw gathered within the council when he first beamed down. They beckon him over with a curl of their bottom hand. Tony ambles over, silently remembering an enthusiastic drunken babble Bruce once gave about how gestures were so similar over different planets and galaxies and cultures and,
“Yeah, I don’t think that’s how biology works.”
“JARVIS – take him back to the Avenger. Release only upon destruction of this ship. Go.”
Coulson doesn’t come much further into the room than two steps. “Tony,” he greets. “You’re making it hard to check up on you.”
end in fulfillment of the bond instead of his dismissal from the ship.
“SHIELD headquarters.”
Steve’s carefully gauging Tony’s reaction, Tony can tell, but Tony can’t really see the problem.
Rogers barks out a laugh, then almost immediately sobers, looking surprised at his own enthusiasm. “No time at all for me?”
“Not really a joke. Plus, it’s a coping mechanism, get with the
The machine beeps and Tony turns, taking a plate of food out of it. Steve goes to ask, but Tony apparently anticipates him, because he says, “I should give you a pointing tour of modern day kitchens, probably, hm? That’s the fridge, keeps things cold, plugged into the wall so you don’t have to do anything to keep it cold. Yay, no ice boxes. Top of it is the freezer. Again, self-regulating, yay no ice boxes. Then we got the toaster. You put bread of various sorts in it and it gets – toasted. Is there another word for that? No matter. Then the microwaves,” he says, pointing to what was spinning. “Heats food faster than a stove. The stove you should know, same with oven. Dishwasher over there, it washes dishes, yay for well named items. Coffee maker, smoothie maker, I think that’s a food processer which cuts food and which has probably never been used. It’d take forever to show you how to use any of this, so just ask JARVIS if you need help and can’t figure it out. Though you should try yourself first and see if you can figure it out. These are all Stark products and you’re the perfect product tester for our UI given your lack of, you know, knowledge. Okay, ready to eat?”
“I mean, I was from an Irish community. I had Irish food.”
you not pining over his memory or wasting your days in guilt over choices
Coulson looks decidedly unimpressed. “
“No? Guess that’s something. This whole, what,” his hands float in the air. “Endeavor was about, about you. Trying to do right about you. But in the end, it was about me. Trying to make me feel better. This whole thing has been a slow-moving wreck. Watch as the poor little rich boy tries desperately to give you what he can’t manage to give himself.”
the time for that, so he decides to ignore it through blunt honesty.
The lunches are usually fairly quiet affairs, minor conversation as Steve eats and Tony eats and works on whatever project is on his workbench that day. Their conversations vary, usually starting with ship gossip and meandering to something else. Sometimes it’s some aspect of the future, sometimes it’s something personal, sometimes it’s about nothing that Tony can remember.
everything.”
It takes some time for Tony to realize this – though, in retrospect, not as much as he may have thought it would if he had thought about any of this before suggesting it. It probably would have taken him longer to know Steve if he had anything else to devote his attention, but with his utter concentration, he gets there.
“Give it another half hour or so,” Tony responds. He’s resting his chin on his hand. His eyes are starting to look glazed.
A pause. “I
Another screen appears: YOU HAVE NOT SAVED. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE?
Tony had
“JARVIS, make a note to complain to Pepper about allowing people down here. It’s really hard to be a secluded recluse if she keeps making meetings for me.” He spins, her hand still on his elbow, and points her to the door. “Miss Rushman,” he says, and gives her a little push.
Steve doesn’t know how to do this. Something’s wrong, that much is obvious, but how he’s supposed to subtly needle Tony into opening up is a job far beyond his pay grade. Lord, he’d like to - but what is he supposed to say?
“Good God,” Tony mutters. “That kind of money could have fed 40 families for 40 years, and he spent it on a dead guy’s body being allowed to decay.”
“Not too much a dancer. I have a hard time – letting go, like that.”
He thinks of Scorhak, one of his first teachers, who refused to give him easier work because of his lineage, and instead fought against the board of directors for Tony’s inclusion in all classwork and activities, a support that directly led to Tony having the energy and conviction to put effort into learning.
“It’s Captain America’s,” Coulson confirms. “I’m sure.”
“Too classified for anyone to know what they’re an agency
want it to be that way, but it’s still fact, and you can’t change it?”
He wants to touch – skin to skin – and find out if they were feeling the same emotion when they said yes to the official Starfleet offer.
“Tony—”
“I don’t want any of your cars.”
Betrothal bond formed to T’Prynn of Vulcan, initiated at 8 years of age. Bond broken in year 2250, due to formation of t’hy’la bond. T’hy’la bond status unknown.
“Oh my
They both jump.
“Steve!” She throws her arms around his neck. “Wow, it’s been a while.”
“Hope I never have to, Cap.”
A pause. When it doesn’t seem like Coulson knows how to say it, Tony pushes through, just like he always does, because drawing this out is just raising everyone’s blood pressures, and says, “Seventy years.”
“Oh.” It never occurred to him. “I couldn’t recreate it, though. I don’t have the talent even if I know the basics.”
He spent most of the night staring out the penthouse window, just watching. From all the way up in the tower, it’s almost hard to tell it’s a place of which he is totally ignorant. The buildings, the lights, the busy streets – it’s all familiar. But everything is just slightly off, like one of those ‘find what’s weird about this picture’ portions of newspapers, where it all looks fine at a glance, but the closer you look, the more you find wrong.
he thinks, three seconds before Tony falls right into him, and yes, that really hurt.
“Is this Mr. Anthony Stark? I am calling about an Edwin Jarvis.”)
“Didn’t realize you liked cats,” Steve says, but he’s still
Tony lets it go on for a few more moments, then pulls back. His eyes are bright.
Here’s what Tony says: “I have a solution to that.”
“I am going with Tony,” Steve says, voice firm. He raises an eyebrow. “Are you going to stop me?”
“No one asked you to,” Clint says, and yes, that’s definitely glee. “And then he just grabs Maras’s hand, walks out with his head held high, nods his head at Natasha for her to follow, and we go to the beam up point. No one could see us with the chaos of all the slaves escaping.”
“Yes, thank you Clint, tore the gate off its hinges, sending it flying into three other guards. Then he stood in the middle of the bay and yelled,
Silence on the comms.
“Mr. Stark, Ms. Potts was quite insistent you’d need someone to look after your affairs.”
Afghanistan was like being on a plane that was gonna crash.
“Too risky. I can’t let a solar system rest in the balance of something that might not work, might get knocked over. Half of engineering is failing the first twenty times. Even I can’t mess up pressing a button.”
He finds Tony, thankfully, in the back near the kitchen, curled up on a couch.
He had actually managed to forget for about a day.
“Don’t get yourself into trouble while I’m gone, Tony,” Coulson says as he’s leaving.
He remembers standing with Pepper, his half-betazoid/half-human personal assistant that he hired on an absolute whim (or so he said to those who asked – split second, thoughtless, gut reactions were human. Immediately calculating probability of success based on a quick glance at resumes wasn’t.
“I need to do something else.”
“Don’t talk about Windfarm, I’m already feeling gassy, I ate a breakfast burrito—”
"Oh. Well. Did you do it? I hope the words ‘devilishly handsome’ are in there somewhere. Preferably ink, though I’d accept permanent marker as well.”
“I want one we both like,” Steve shrugs. “I just want something to depend on me. But this is your place. You have to like her too.”
(Before his first counseling appointment, they made him fill out a beginning questionnaire. The third question read, “Are you happy?” with two boxes: no and yes.
There’s no point to lying. Not to one’s t’hy’la.
The scientific mind, the ability to handle input, the bone-deep aversion to skin-to-skin contact, how every project is first put through a logic filter, the physical strength he forgets he carries, the desperate, clawing need for meditation every few days – they won’t disappear. Not with alcohol, not with chocolate, not with partying, not with revulsion-laden sex, not with pushing his body to days and weeks without calming. Nothing will make his blood turn red.
“Okay. Want to restart the game?”
“If it’s not trouble, I would like to beam down and take a look myself.”
He should probably tell his therapist that. It makes sense to him, but so did telling Pepper that he forgot his social security number because it meant she would have to memorize it and thus pay more attention to him, and his therapist really didn’t care for that one.
much time with everyone doing random shit?”
He feels himself slowly surface, becoming slowly aware of the fact that his hand is being squeezed.
Tony shakes his head. “It’s too dangerous. I’m destroying it immediately after. I’m also not writing any of the plans down. When I go,” he knocks on his head. “Then it’s gone.”
“Too war-like?” Tony suggests.
“Why would I be?” Tony asks. He’s cold in here. He’s always cold in here.
Tony blinks, and turns to look at Natasha.
He puts on a grin he hopes passes for cocky, pushes all the emotion down down down into a steel box, padlocks it, swallows the key, and says, “Not bad. A lot of tongue. Bleh, saliva.”
“Funny things are.”
Tony closes his eyes. He breathes.
“Palladium poisoning,” Steve answers promptly.
“Yes, probably,” Tony interrupts. “All the commandos are gone, your whole neighborhood is now gentrified and for sure driven out any stragglers. Peggy Carter is still around, but her mind is going. I visit her about once a year, try to, she was around when I was a kid, but she doesn’t recognize me most times anymore. I can look up anyone else you care about, but yes, they’re probably all dead.”
“He had only had that because he stole it from my dad. No one else has come up with it on their own.”
He leaning in the doorway, wearing one of those T-Shirts with the name of something Steve vaguely remembers JARVIS talking about, something called NASA. He’s in jeans and he looks casual and he looks kinda pissed, and the anger fuels Steve into saying, “It’s my life, isn’t it? Can’t I choose how I want to live it? Whether I want to live it?”
The Avenger isn’t visible from this vantage point, but Tony trusts JARVIS to bring Steve back safely. He doesn’t turn his communicator back on, and, instead, stares down at Levonos II, barely visible from the left side of the window.
“All of this art was too,” Tony says, widening his arms to encompass the room. “It’s incredible to me that with all that there is in the galaxy, every single thing seems to have
He shakes his head, forcing himself to stay on task. He throws the shield up a little, once, twice, catching it. It’s sturdy and solid and just as bright as it always looked in the comics and posters. He’s impressed that the paint job has managed to stay despite being in the elements for 70 years. Maybe he can test–
There’s a dude on the floor, currently in a supersoldier chokehold. His hair is black and tangled, there’s something slightly wrong with his lip, and he looks familiar in that weird way that Tony’s just
As if that’s any better.
He could be talking about Tony’s mannerisms, his brown hair, his curved eyebrows, his tone of voice, his way of speech, his jokes, his movement, his flippancy – any number of things that Tony carefully cultivated over years, but in the end, the answer is the same. “Good.”
That one actually worked, and here they stand.
Steve kicks at something that looks important, and the left side of the machine caves in with a crash.
He just lets the anger rise.
until a week or two later, with a mission to Delta Worra.
It’s just –
“I’m going to send you back.”
“Fuck?” The Captain repeats. Tony wills himself not to have a reaction. “That’s a Vulcan word as well?”
“Just this fantasy creature people wrote about back in my days. They had the—” He gestures at his ears and mimics points, and Tony watches, helpless. “Elves were always my favorite. I wasn’t expecting the pointy ears on a real alien.”
He spends ten minutes with his head in his hand, just feeling bad for himself, when a noise has him lifting his eyes.
Steve nods. He can give Tony that, at least.
“JARVIS, identify,” Tony says, scooching forward on the bed so he’s closer to the action. “Steve, maybe lighten the grip a little, there.”
“Yes, sir. In the room to your right.”
“The Iron Man suit. I have it here—” He lifts his wrist, showcasing where the nano-bites are held. “It has medical protocols. I have an override code where I can put it on another person – I can get it on Steve and send it up to the Avenger. It’s programmed to handle space conditions. It can get him up to the ship, and then I have the doors programmed to open for it—”
Tony shrugs.
Look, Tony has had a lot of tough challenges – making the reactor in a cave with a box of scraps comes to mind – but he’s man enough to admit that getting Captain America’s body out of there unscathed is an absolute bitch.
She turns to walk out, heels announcing her exit.
“Why?”
He can hear Coulson begin barking orders of some sort at the crew, and he hears the tell-tale beep that tells him he was switched to a private channel. It’s Steve, and he’s resolute. “Tony – you will find a way out.”
The wind is knocked out of him, that’s for sure, and he definitely cracked at least half of his ribs, though he can already feel them healing. He hopes his head didn’t crack too hard on the concrete, though, honestly, he may have blacked out for a second, and he’s not really sure.
Tony raises one eyebrow. “I know.” His own meal has been all but polished off. “I was on the memo, being senior staff and requested to work the transporter.”
When his personal line rings, the list is getting damn long.
to get to where I am, and then you come along and suddenly – what, I’m bumped off Time’s list of best tech conglomerates in the world, just like that?”
And so Steve looks closer.
Rhodey sees too much, and sees too quietly. He’s
“Eh?” he prompts.
Might party a bit, maybe some sex, definitely donuts, and hopefully a couple Iron Man missions as well. If he’s really lucky, a couple nights in with Pepper and Rhodey.
Steve tells him in return about his mother, and Tony thinks nothing of it.
was the one who broke his hand. He doesn’t even get a nod of recognition. Hammer lifts his head, and his eyes are glistening. “No one was supposed to be able to hack those, Stark. No one. No one else in the world could have. If they had just done their
Steve does a final look, then glances over at Tony. He gives him a small smile. “Looks similar, actually. At least from a distance.” He points at a black Chevy SUV parked in the lot, which Tony is fairly certain is for Coulson. “Cars look different.”
Steve’s been staring at a discolored spot on the fabric of the loveseat he’s using, intent and tense. He does look up, and catches Tony’s eye.
“DUM-E usually makes it to my tastes, so it may be a bit strong—”
Tony could still see the dinner-plate sized hole in Coulson's uniform. "No." He shrugged again. "But I could prevent it from happening again."
Either Steve hit his head hard this morning in practice – which actually might explain a couple things, actually – or they’re having two separate conversations.
do that to me again, Tony, my heart cannot take it.”
Tony, at the time, had thought
Tony’s going to hit the roof, going fast and going hard, and he’s definitely going to break something – maybe his neck, even.
“Meaning?”
“Commander Romanoff,” he barks. She twists in the Captain’s chair, clearly slightly alarmed, but she frowns at his tone.
Tony can’t bring up the will to even pretend to smile. “We’ll see.”
It takes Steve a bit to figure out, but he realizes that Tony must have told JARVIS what to say if Steve asked about him, but probably didn’t think to forbid JARVIS from answering any information that wasn’t classified.
“No. Who cares?”
“We can’t establish a lock on his position with the interference, but I assume we could beam people down.”
“I’m curious, actually, Tony. Did you think that you would tell me that and I would – I don’t know. Just say, ah, okay. That’s a shame. And then just – what, let it go? Wait for you to die?”
“And?” she prompts.
The door clatters down into the snow, making a bang against the steel floors.
That’s the first Steve’s heard that Howard passed. It’s not surprising, but, for some reason, he had assumed Howard was just old and living in a nursing home, or something.
The quiet hum of the engines can be heard.
“I am not asking you to unknow it. I am asking you to let it go. Stop worrying about. It’s fine, everything is fine.”
He should probably work on his worrisome tendency towards sadism.
He’s kind of glad he is still capable of caring about someone that much – some part of him sort of worried that the part of him capable of giving a shit died right along with him in the 1940s – but he hasn’t really missed the anxious, unrelenting anger that comes with it.
Steve makes a strange hand gesture, and Tony’s supremely uncomfortable that a
His face spasms, slightly – that is a verbal tic that he hasn’t been able to scalpel out of himself, even twenty years off his home planet.
A field with orange grass, a sky of bright green, air that smells of pulled sugar.
When he hits boarding school, it occurs to him he might not want to live forever. His father’s cold, calculating disappointment, his inability to relate to any of his peers, his long, empty days spent playing alone in big, sterile conference rooms – if that was a vision into the future, the cold reality of life, then he wasn’t particularly interested.
“Why?” Tony repeats.
He spins and exits, leaving Steve standing there, sweat drying and heart pounding.
“Thanks, boo,” Tony says, and flings the folder back at Steve, who catches it one-handed, the coordinated dick.
Steve nods. “It was my code name.”
Like Tony would say no – even if Steve wasn’t handsome, even if Tony didn’t like kissing, even if Tony didn’t like men, even if Steve wasn’t impossible to say no to, even if Tony wouldn’t do just about anything Steve asked, even if there weren’t a billion piles of feelings pushing Tony to say yes – they’re friends. Tony would do it anyway.
“You’re not
But the whole point of his new direction is to cut off
“Why are they not standard issue to all officers?”
It can be built in a moment.
Hammer has been slowly and quietly inching backwards, which Steve has not missed. He assumed it was out of fear, but at the last moment, he can see Hammer’s hand settle on some device behind him on a table, and Steve just has the time to yell,
the gratitude seep through the bond – gold and warm and tinged with surprise and appreciation, and a wave of aching desire to never feel disappointment or anger or frustration filter through hits Tony so hard that he must work to keep it off his face.
Tony nods. “I know weapons of war.” He turns to Coulson. “I know weapons. He knows the ship. If he can get me around it, I can deactivate it.”
Abruptly, Steve stands, and turns to face the wall.  “It’s unethical to command you to tell me who it is.” Steve laughs, once, bitter. “I want to, all the same.”
Tony resists the urge to throw a napkin at him. He is not – will not be – that anal. “I’m sure they’re all the same.”
Steve’s middle feels like chiseled marble, so he doesn’t actually move an inch, and Tony finds himself looking up, feeling a little betrayed and a lot confused.
Tony takes pity on him. “No, she’s not. We almost were, for a hot second. Could have been, maybe. But no, that ship didn’t sail.”
“The picture is way nicer than movie screens used to be,” Steve says, gesturing to it. “Cleaner. And the colors are great, far more vivid than before.”
“Of course he didn’t, did he
Not that it mattered.
“I told myself it was a passing thing, that it would go away. It usually does. Or I can ignore it. But I can’t. I can’t, and I never couldn’t understand why it just, it
Tony stops and straightens. He flips his goggles to the top of his head. His spiky, brown hair fills them, and something about it sort of makes Steve ache.
“But yes? You’d trade Obama for FDR?”
is the best in the world.”
“The list. Crossed out number 163 just a few minutes ago. Everything is taken care of. I should really thank you, you answered several of the harder questions. Like numbers 1 and 5. Easier when there’s a backup superhero. It was gonna be Rhodey. Gonna be a new one, even. But now there’s you, and he doesn’t need that on his shoulders. I gave him my villa in Italy instead. And a design of a specialized car, if I ever finish it.”
“If this doesn’t work,” Tony says. “We’re still naming this element after me. Stark-isium. Stark-rilium. Tony-gen. Badassium. I’ll be in every textbook in the world – my dream.”
He wonders distantly if ‘use’ is a mistranslation from standard, or if that’s the word they use to mean eat, which is culturally interesting.
are you aware?”
“Yes. Their race is far superior to humans in scientific knowledge – just don’t ask him to explain what he knows. He is currently in the middle of a time sensitive project.”
Tony sits down.
“Armor, though that’s simplistic.”
“Come on, let’s get in the car. I’ll explain on the way.”
He starts to sift through it. There’s a DVD, which Tony immediately throws to the side – he really doesn’t need to hear Howard’s voice right now – as well as some notebooks and some plans.
“Sure,” Tony says, mind now racing. Has Steve ever left the building without telling Tony before? Where would he go? Did he leave for good?
“I don’t want money,” Steve says, actually affronted. “And I don’t want to lie.”
“Don’t you have an alpha shift tomorrow?” Tony takes the seat across from him, and mirrors Steve’s position, one leg under. “That’s only three hours from now.”
Tony vaguely remembers hearing about the ship being found several years ago, and one of the people causing a ruckus on another starship. “And they made him Captain?”
There’s probably eight cats and about thirteen dogs. And look, it’s not that Tony
“Have you ever been in love?”
He turns to the woman, who gratifyingly looks as impressed as he imagined, and he’s trying to think of a good one liner for her – most of his default ones require winking, which just Does Not Work in the armor – when an alarm blasts.
“Okay, Mister Stark,” he agrees. “I made an update to the—”
It’s not that he’s so much
“I’m not all that concerned with the rank.” Steve gazes around the ship, fingers tapping on his knee, and Tony’s suddenly, viscerally aware that this is the first conversation he’s ever initiated with Steve. “I didn’t know what to do – after. This was something to do. Something good.”

Obadiah had been standing by his side. Tony had ignored the perfunctory “I grieve with thee,” but found it hard to ignore the continuing stream of snide comments about when he’d take over the family’s weapon manufacturing business.
and fall to the ground before Hammer is pointing and shooting.
“Captain,” Coulson says, placating. “We would place you in a good room. We would have the best agents to teach you about the new world. We would train you to get back into the fight. There’s a lot we could offer.”
Three moons orbit Levonos II. Levonos II orbits a large, faraway sun. The sun has an asteroid belt. On the other side of the sun, there are fifteen planets, ranging in size from half the sun to .025x the sun. Each one has intelligent life. None of the life look similar to one another. Seven of the planets are warp-capable. One planet has yet to control fire. In total, they number about twice Earth’s population. There is infinite more amount of other life, life that is taken for granted by organizations like Starfleet – plants, animals, insects, oceans, vegetation.
The suit immediately starts to unravel from his wrist and spread, nano-bites coalescing, covering his arm, making its way up his body, until Steve is completely covered.
“Did somebody else get in here?” he wonders aloud. “Some poor sod who got lost and was looking for shelter?”
Tony frowns. “They have six legs.”
The world dissolved.
Vaguely, it registers with him that he’s kind of being an asshole. Somewhere in his head, he knows that Tony is doing him a huge favor, letting him stay in his place, taking his time out to teach him, giving him a gym to work out in.
The TV loudly proclaims “COMING IN FALL 2011” when Tony drops his fork into his food, and covers his eyes with his hands.
” Three seconds. “Barton to—”
“Of course we do,” Tony interrupts smoothly. “For the record. And accurate paperwork. Please,” he flourishes with his hands. “Continue.”
The Captain takes it in stride, simply nodding at Bruce in welcome.
“Mhm.”
“No, I mean you
“No, it’s fine.” Steve looks as if he’s reaching for the right words. He clears his throat softly. “I just read that Vulcans have an aversion to touch, but you…” He trails off. “I just want to do right by you, that’s all,” he finishes, awkwardly.
They never do.
It takes him an hour, but he decides to check in on Tony.
“And she’s getting there right now, according to her text,” Pepper interrupts. “So you don’t have time to cancel. Bye, Tony!”
“Multi-verse theory,” Tony dismisses. He doesn’t even look up. “You don’t alter this timeline. When you leave, it’ll just be as if you disappeared. When you go back, you create an alternate timeline – an alternate universe. The future you create there is the only one that existed for that universe.”
To that little boy, Tony wishes he could go back, kneel in front of him, take his hand, and say,
That, in and of itself, isn’t that odd.
It’s silent for a minute or two, long enough for Steve to pick up his book again, and get a sentence or two in.
“But the 20
“Hey Tony,” he greets, apparently oblivious to the fact that Tony’s about three seconds and a good hard shove away from vomiting. “You didn’t come up to eat. Just wanted to check in.”
Part of it is the fact that he’s dying. Every day feels slightly worse. He’s getting weaker, he’s getting tired, and he can feel all the strings inside him slowly starting to be cut, one by one, like a puppet about to fall. There’s something strangely comforting about doing something as low-stakes as teaching Steve how to play modern board games while also doing something as important as teaching Steve about the modern world. It’s low effort but matters, and it’s – it’s calming.
This day is not going how either of them expected, it seems.
And if he could prevent it from happening again, and didn't, it would place Coulson's death on his shoulders.
There’s something off with Tony’s tone, but Steve can’t place it. Though it doesn’t seem quite right, he’s fairly certain it’s probably just curiosity. There doesn’t seem to be a single mystery on this planet that Tony isn’t interested in.
“Right.” Another beat. “I didn’t really subscribe to that. Peggy and I – we took our time. And I died, just as they said I would, without having experienced any of that.”
"One to beam up."
Tony pauses outside the door to the main recreation room. He had been planning on his first live-test of a new program he was coding – a simulation, a holographic, 4D recreational experience that would let people create scenarios and act them out. He was considering a few different names – the
” and Tony’s so speechlessly touched that he doesn’t say anything more to try to talk him out of it.
He abruptly cuts himself off. Curiosity is one of Tony’s only inherent traits that had been cultivated, encouraged.
He can roll with the not-expected punches, Iron Man has proven that, so he settles back into the couch and resolves to follow Steve’s thought-bunny down the rabbit hole. Whatever it is, it’s clearly bothering him.
Tony nods at him. He wants to say,
“It would seem so,” JARVIS answers.
be the reason you’ve lost everything, once again.”
“That reminds me – you gotta pick a time to go back. I’m assuming before Barnes died, but that’s your choice.”
“Ugh,” he says, blinking hard. And oh, there’s Tony. He’s the anxious one. “You okay?”
“Sir,” JARVIS interrupts his internal monologue. “I do find myself curious about the heartbeat in the next room.”
Steve’s grip tightens.
He hasn’t been locked out, which he appreciates, though he knows it was JARVIS’s doing and not Tony’s. He’s not sure what to think that he deduces that from a “Welcome, Captain,” from JARVIS. He thinks it makes him warm, but maybe a little embarrassed as well.
Mystified and on his way to panicked, Tony runs over to the door and hits the open button with a shaking palm.
Tony can infer what she isn’t saying. Are you excited because:
“Not to – not to be rude, or anything,” Steve says, interrupting their staring contest. “But can one of you prove it?”
He supposes age has subdued him.
He, unthinkingly and uncaring about the answer, asks Steve what color was most popular for men’s suits back in the 40s.
To have a friend?
Steve walks in, gathers all the courage he doesn’t have, and says without any preamble, “Okay. So what to do I do?”
“They’re ugly now. And by that, I mean the basic cars that everyone has. There’s some great expensive ones, just wait and see my garage, it’s like a zoo for hundred thousand-dollar beauties, but the 1940s and earlier cars were just cooler in design. That’s gonna be a disappointment.”
“No. I’m not sure. Maybe SHIELD, as an agent. I can see the appeal of active duty again, with a team who knows who I am and what I can do. But it seems too—”
To his utter surprise, Steve picks L.A.
like the sort of person who memorizes serial numbers to planes of dead WWII veterans?”
Her mouth is slightly open, like she knows she should respond, but doesn’t know what to say, so he plows helpfully ahead.
He’s alone.
“It’s just the period on the end of a sentence that’s already been written.” Tony wonders how his life got to this point – arguing with someone that his life isn’t worth the energy to try to save. He reckons if he told his twenty-year-old self that, he would have snorted, said,
The door has a window, and Steve signals at Tony to step out of the way of it. Carefully out of sight from the inside, he makes his way forward, crouching, before he stands slightly, just enough to peer inside.
other than himself?”
“Maybe?” Steve half-shrugs, a small smile threatening to widen. “I wasn’t ever made to fall in line.”
“Expedition?” Tony repeats. “What are you talking about, dad’s expeditions?”
, Steve thinks.
“God damn it, JARVIS, there has to be a way to use the repulsors to melt the ice without actually burning him.”
("Leave, then," his father said, tone betraying no emotion, eyes as blank as ever. "Find your way on a pleasure planet, on a mining planet, on a Starfleet base.”
“If it’s easy, it seems like it could be taken advantage of,” Steve muses.
This.
The smarter part of his head knows he doesn’t want the serum to keep him alive forever.
He opens his eyes.
Tony was made fun of horribly the next day in school for his poorly-Vulcanized eyebrows – Vulcan children are purely logical creatures his
“It is
There’s a beep, and then silence.
“Vulcan voodoo,” he snaps. “Just check on him, won’t you?”
“You’re most likely wondering why,” Captain Rogers says, which makes Tony bark an unexpected laugh. Rogers looks pleased.
He sighs, nice and long and unhappy, and scrolls down to number 18, “What to do with schematics for tech that hasn’t yet worked out?”
all my customers. And for what? Because you
He looked at his hand, and its thin green veins, at his wrist and the ever-present concealed suit. He could feel his lungs, expand, contract. He could feel the golden throb of the t’hy’la bond, ever present, ever un-fulfilled.
media –
“Don’t forget that he then punched the man unconscious.”
Because right now, it’s bearable.
Pepper sighs loudly. “Do you have an excuse for disappearing for about a week with no warning and missing your meeting in Japan to introduce the new Stark Phone product launch?”
and went right on. Fucking pitiful, is what it is.
(Here’s a decision Tony makes in his 20s:
“You’re right, you’re too great a risk. We haven’t even considered—”
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
“Steve!” Tony barks, and Steve flinches, looking back up at him. “We need to take these things down. Now.”
Tony shakes his head, even though they can’t see it. He hopes Steve cannot feel the mounting fear through the bond, and he struggles to keep his voice stable. “They lost a lot of time getting us here. We knew we’d be running up against the clock, but—” A swallow. “21.3 minutes.”
“Why?”
Which all sort of falls apart when Steve opens the door.
The metaphorical clock ticks, and nothing happens.
so much life, so much potential, so much existence.
Steve’s been intently staring at Tony, but jumps near a full foot in the air when the room starts to change and take shape. It’s not perfect yet, not by any means, but it’s still hyper-realistic, and to an untrained eye, probably near flawless.
“Very good, sir. Would you like me to open up your latest project while you’re down here?”
“Okay.” Steve nods. That feeling inside his chest – the irritable, temperamental, half-a-step-from-an-emotional-breakdown feeling – finally seems to take a step back, settling down where he won’t be missed. Maybe all it needed was a push. “Okay. Let’s start again.”
“Gotta look to the future,” Tony says, sardonic. “Like me. Anyway, now you know, so now I am going to make a tactical retreat and find Pepper and ask her for some meeting to attend. Pip pip, cheerio.”
He couldn’t help being logical, of being able to compute math without thinking, of reasoning before thinking – but he could control what he did with that fact. He could twist the logic into something all his own – make math into art.
doing. It has evolved from ‘let’s hang out because helping you gives me purpose’ to ‘let’s hang out because it’s all I have to do’ to ‘let’s hang out because it’s the best part of my day’ to ‘let’s hang out because you’re my favorite part of life,’ and God knows Tony doesn’t want it to evolve from there, though it most definitely will if he’s not careful.
“What is his name?”
Tony turns, getting ready to pack up some of his tools for the engine, when Steve’s voice make him pause.
And with that, he stands, slightly wobbly, and heads out.
“I know that, Tony,” she answers, voice softening. “You can do what you want, and if you want this, then honestly, great. But it’s just - uncharacteristic. I’m worried about you.”
“Is this something good?”
The next few days gradually improve.
The Iron Man armor, as Tony calls it, is neat.
Tony makes himself think.
“You don’t have to go back into something military, you know. I mean, really. Do you always have to fight against the bad? Can’t you contribute to the good?”
It came after Tony had offered himself up as a human sacrifice on a mission. In his defense, the leaders of that colony were requesting it be Peter, the young and bright science ensign intern, and like
Steve can feel himself getting angry, it bubbling up from some deep trench inside himself, and it’s making him want to vibrate out of his skin, and it’s enough that he turns to look at Tony.
Tony turns, ready to depart for the beaming station, when he comes face to face with the man himself.
“I don’t know. It’s a change, something new.”
Steve pays extra attention to Tony, who is apparently doing his best to appear as normal as possible. He has what Steve assumes are therapy appointments now, for an hour after Steve’s back from his book club, but other than that, he’s purposefully, pointedly normal.
And something’s telling him that something is off. He’s too - quiet. He talks the same amount, but there’s something phoned in about it, like his mind is elsewhere. Which isn’t actually abnormal for Tony, but it’s the type of distracted. Like he doesn’t want to be distracted, like he has to guard himself from his own thoughts.
“What about beaming?”
Steve looks away, across the hall. Somehow, Tony gets the impression he’s not looking at anything in particular. “I’m – very glad I didn’t die before I met you.”
He springs into action, running towards an end of the roof, building up momentum, and chucks his shield at one passing overhead. It hits its target, and the drone falls like a brick. Steve runs after it, grabbing the shield out of its broken body with a metal screech, and throws it at another.
“And?” Tony prompts.
“It’s not—”
He’s surprised when Steve stopped by his quarters, a half hour before his own beam time, though he’s not sure why. He supposes he figured Steve had his own plans.
Tony swipes it before Coulson can change his mind. He hits the home button – a Stark phone, thank God – when the keypad comes up.
“That’s not good,” Steve snaps, then regrets it as Tony’s head droops even further. “Look,” he starts again. “You don’t
There’s no line drawn? I make weapons that murder
“Yes,” he answers easily. He cocks his head, a small, sure smile on his face.
“That seems like an unnecessary risk,” Steve objects, and Tony rolls his eyes.
And now, looking into the set of Steve’s eyes, Tony thinks,
“Excuse me?”
He looks beyond the console, where the window to the outside is, but is stopped short by a small knock against the interior door.
That’s fine.
He doesn’t need to be known, maybe.
“Tony,” Coulson interrupts.
with an old man in robes, sitting at a table with various instruments. “Did people really dress like that?”
they had cried.
“A big one,” Steve tries to reassure him, holding his hands about a foot apart, like that was what worried Tony about that story. “He must have a hard head. It just shattered on impact.”
“Give me what?”
Almost certainly not a mission that would require Tony.
“We don’t have time.”
take you months? Facebook algorithims are faster at facial recognition. And you really couldn’t figure out how to make it identify the Iron Man armor without me getting out?”
But this isn’t the same.
He doesn’t mean it. Tony would
“You take better care of yourself, do you hear me, Tony?” Pepper says.
“I also seem to remember saying that Iron Man was my property and no one else could have it. And if I decide to put it out of public commission for a while, that’s my decision to make.”
“Tony.”
Tony folds.
to Vulcan – but, over the years, he’s learned he truly doesn’t care for the taste or the concept. Humans haven’t eaten actual animals for a century, but the thought still makes his stomach turn unpleasantly.
“It’s around,” Tony states immediately. “It’s around. Don’t send me off.” He can feel his control start to come back to him. “Please,” he says again, this time a request, not a beg.
According to JARVIS, Tony has been spending almost his entire days inside his workshop. It’s not out of the realm of possibility that something like what the TV is saying is true – but Steve doesn’t buy it.
Tony says. “I lose either way.”
“I’m sorry,” Admiral Fury had said, with very little pity lacing his tone. “If anyone catches wind that we have Tony Stark –
Here’s what Tony says: “I can do that.”
He remembers reading a book on Terran history, long ago, given to him by Jarvis on a birthday he’s now forgotten. It had spoken of old times, of the death penalty, and how some of the criminals had been given the option of a last meal before their final moments.
Tony squares his shoulders. “Request permission to beam down.”
people stuff and honestly Pepper I love the downtime and no Pepper I’m not quitting being Iron Man I’m just taking a public break and goodness Pepper would you look at the time.
“What’s a secret?”
not out the window!”
“Two months, on the day,” Steve repeats. “I won’t forget.”
After a moment of deliberation, Tony lets him in, though he doesn’t lift his welding mask or drop the torch. If he gives him too much attention, Coulson will get
Steve apparently does too, from his place on the couch in the workshop, because Tony gets a truly disapproving glare.
“It’s a lot more than just for calling now.”
“So you didn’t tell—” Steve cuts himself off, and runs a hand through his hair. It spikes slightly in the back. “Look, I may be wildly off base here, and if I am, please tell me, and I’ll never mention it again, I promise. I just, I can’t do this anymore, with you, it’s—”
Just, one day, he’s cooking eggs for breakfast, thinks,
“Why?”
Tony looks away from where his toes are curled in the fuchsia sand, from the deep-green ocean waves that are currently heating his feet. “And why would you say that?” Tony teases. “Me spending 48 straight hours in an engineering lab indicates that I would enjoy a three-day, assignment-less, profiling examination of a pleasure planet?”
“An art exhibit?” Tony repeats, doubtfully.
At first, he also locked Steve out of the common room, kitchen, and bathroom, just out of vindictive pettiness because he
It’s like at the two-week mark, the crisis mode ended for everyone else, and there became an expectation, unspoken but palpable, that he’s going to be Okay now. Which is interesting, because just yesterday he found out that his favorite brand of soda was discontinued and punched a hole straight through the wall and then three hours later broke two plates for not fitting into the dishwasher. And he can feel Tony’s patience starting to wane, the background disapproval and confusion that he’s not Alright, or not Getting Better.
Steve laughs, like he doesn’t know what else to do, still staring at Tony with that restless confusion.
“If the situation were reversed, what would you have done?”
“I swear, if there’s a woman downstairs—”
It felt like his hands did not unclench from holding the battery to his chest even when unconscious. “What do you
“How could you—” Steve breaths, two short breaths, eyes afire. “How could you
“Oh, nothing.”
The grass is green and long, enough to tickle his ankles.
TONY STARK: RECOMMENDED
“Yes,” Coulson confirms. “February 2010.”
“Stark—”
"Friend-Stark." The interruption was made by the member who gave him a tour of the field, which felt like so long ago. "The Avenger is requesting permission to beam you up."
Steve realizes he’s still standing in the middle of the kitchen, his arms by his side uselessly.
(She worked out well. Of course she did)).
“He actually stopped by to see
He keeps his hands laced together.
He, slowly, takes Steve’ hand, and leads him back towards the console, towards the window facing outside. Steve follows without comment.
And he then he smiles.
“Right, because you are the leading authority on what I think, of course.”
“I’m not a gun person,” Steve responds, still watching Doom being taken away.
“Steve—”
“Your dad?” It takes Steve a second. “Stark? Like Howard? You’re Howard Stark’s son?”
“Did it have anything to do with that power source?”
Which brings him to point 3.
Tony heads towards the control monitors.
“Do you have any idea how strong and powerful the Kree race are?”
“I’m sure you’re not, Steve,” Pepper says kindly. “I’m sure this would be fine if I was ever notified about it at all.” Her voice turns pointed, as does her gaze, which shifts back to Tony. “How do you expect me to keep your schedule if you just haphazardly leave and get new projects and things to do without telling me? You thoroughly pissed off Congress a couple of weeks ago. We already got a notice from the DOD that they’re thinking of retracting our Windfarm contract, despite the fact that we already have people on payroll for that—”
He does realize for the first time that Steve’s in pajamas, blue and plaid ones, which just makes this whole thing so much better.
“Why would you need to check up on me?” Tony asks. He turns off the torch and places it on the table, where it rolls off and almost hits him in the foot. He jumps back, landing into his table, and he can see Coulson’s bland smile from behind the slotted eyes of the mask.
Tony thinks.
“Okay, Tony,” he says. A slight pause, then, “Thank you. For – you know, everything.”
“Good question,” Steve says, his fist flying through another.
Steve had let it go, in the end, because it wasn’t worth it. It was just a picture of a clock melting, something reminiscent of a painter he used to like and also just something he had been feeling.
He’s in his workshop, banging a sheet of metal.
about who Tony finds important.
Steve says, and Tony takes his hand off the mouse, and gives Steve his full attention.
Setting up the particle accelerator is infinitely easier than Tony imagined because Steve has massive muscles. Not that Tony
Tony takes so much energy.
Like a math equation that he was able to Good Will Hunting out.
“Tony, if you don’t try to keep yourself alive, you won’t be. If you don’t accept your past, accept what you’ve done, and move forward, you’ll struggle making it through a five-year mission.”
“He could send someone else after you!”
A moment, then, “Stark? Is that you?”
It’s been hours, several hours, and Tony’s at a more delicate part of the wiring process when Steve says, “You seem better.”
And for what end?
“Absolutely,” Tony answers, too cheerful to be honest.
“I guess, yeah,” Steve says shrugging. He pauses, looks like he’s contemplating it, then says, far more seriously, “Yeah, I guess I am.”
be used as an instructional manual. What do
“Rude,” Tony says.
“What if it was the lives of a hundred orphans, huh? What then, Steve? That a good enough reason to spill my secrets?”
“Captain Rogers here,” he hears. “Any luck?”
“Some people who are wondering aren’t only the public. People like Senators, the Secretary of Defense, and Director Fury.”
“I am not.” She stops, and blinks. “Tony, you want out of your own company?”
James Bond villain – why did he never look into acting? “What if stole your phone and told the nurse to wake him up?”
Steve laughs, but it doesn’t seem to be from humor. He rubs his eye, hard enough that it looks like it may hurt, and Tony watches, perplexed by Steve’s mood.
Or so it read on record. Missions rarely played out like they were planned, Tony knew.
With a shake of the head, he heads towards the elevator, leaving Steve alone in the middle of the room.
“Undoubtedly so, sir,” JARVIS answers.
“What’s the plan for the team after I go?”
my business over an impulse? And you act like you’re God’s gift to tech, like no one else could do it!”
“Don’t ever do that again.” His voice is muffled by Tony’s neck. The movement of his lips against skin has the hairs on the back of Tony’s neck standing at attention.
“I was not going to let you die alone,” Steve says, completely calmly. He’s faced death before, no question, but he’s never walked so openly into its arms.
“Yeah, my answer sticks.”
“I understand why rules exist. It’s just the way it is, and it’s never going change. 20
The next two days, they both spend entirely alone.
“Please,” he can hear himself beg. He refuses to feel shame over it. There’re so many better things to feel ashamed of, in his life. “Please. We won’t tell the media. We won’t tell anyone. I just disappear and reappear in the engine room of whatever is your least important ship.”
Tony blinks at him, too fast to not be on purpose, then demands, “Why? What do you mean, why?”
They leave the tower for the first time about a month and a half in. Steve is careful to leave a big bowl of water and food for Roomba, even though they’re only planning on being gone for two days.
of all things is highlighting his weaknesses, so he just nods briskly, says “We’re naming it Roomba,” and then walks out.
For a moment, he wonders –
And then age 38 rolled around. The year he accepted that he was going to die and probably deserved to die, but was going to keep walking, even with a broken chest, even with a self-loathing he hadn’t felt for decades, fixing what he could until he was brought down.
But, perhaps, it still is.
She glances over to Steve with a strange expression. Tony’s not particularly talented in reading human emotions, but if he were to name it, he would say it was pity.
Tony fills his mug with water and sets it in the microwave, then turns to fully face Steve.
He finds that he doesn’t know what to say – yes, somehow, isn’t coming off his tongue yet, and he finds himself responding, “What, just like that?”
Steve was on the other end of the table, coming off an unexpected Beta shift, given a helmsman had come down with the Andorain flu. His head was resting on his folded arms, and he was quietly watching Tony work, silent but smiling.
Whatever the reason for the initial refusal, Steve’s noticeably relaxing against his pillow. “So, Tony,” he says, and Tony glances away from where Bruce is still tensely typing buttons. “What happened?”
“Fine. Cars? Which car?”
Steve sets down his pencil on the coffee table.
("You didn't need to make this, Tony," Coulson had said, bemused, hands minutely stretching the fabric.
“Come again?” Tony says, or croaks, really, because there’s no way that wasn’t a joke.
Another him, most hims actually, would ignore it.
“Huh? I don’t know.” Tony scans it quickly. Then, he scans it slower. Then, he drops the other files on the table, holding only the diorama. Then, he reads it again, first word to last.
right, so Steve internally sighs at himself and takes something from each plate.
“No,” Coulson replies, almost shouting above the wind. “Look at the serial number on the side.”
Coulson looks pained as he answers, “It’s a piece from an old ship from the mid-21
Steve has no reason not to believe him, though he thinks about it often afterwards.
So he definitely wasn’t expecting it. But Tony, at least on paper, is his Type. So much so that he’s absolutely positive if he had any friends left, they’d tease him about it relentlessly. Brown haired, strong willed, stubborn, sassy, intelligent, and pushy. Tony even kicks ass in a fight, which Steve isn’t sure why is a box of his to tick, but definitely seems to be a running thread. Not to mention, every time this kind of thing has happened in the past, it’s been with someone he’s been friends with first.
When you’re born, you stand on the shoulders of giants, each year growing taller. Children are starting higher than he, and no one thinks to make a manual of how to climb.
He thinks of his blood, dripping green, that he was able to donate to save the life of the Ambassador who was shot on a routine mission, so nearby.
“What?”
Tony shrugs, hands raising in the air. “What makes you happy?”
Water spurts out, near a foot from Steve’s foot, completely wetting his pant legs. Not that it incredibly matters – their shoulders are fully damp, by now, wet hair falling into both their eyes.
“Wanna restart?”
Steve stands, and they both advance towards Hammer, who is clutching his hand to his chest.
When Tony made his own personal pledge to be a better person, he never, ever considered it would involve watching Steve walk away.
“Okay?” He scratches his head.  “Did you take it? I hope you took it. You could take their money for slipping them false secrets about me. Like I drink orange juice daily or am planning to bomb Russia or I painted the Iron Man suit green for Earth Day, or something.”
Steve doesn’t know him like Pepper does, like Rhodey does. But sometimes Tony feels like the only reason they are there is because he grabbed them and refused to let go.
“It’s okay,” Tony says, calm. “It is only logical.”
“Oh, the element—” He pauses. “Are you saying…?”
It’s not a project he’s focused on a lot, especially lately, but he does want to leave SI with
“Tony—” And that tone is gearing towards an apology, which he has no interest in hearing, so Tony spins and leaves the room.
Tony glances over in surprise. Steve sounds light, but Tony can’t place his tone.
as he likes to joke with himself, but it needs better filtration – the suit is supposed to offer protection to anyone on any planetary atmosphere, and it’s not up to his own standards as of yet.
“Okay,” Clint says, looking around.  “The mission report said that Steve would beam down into the meeting chamber. That must be this.”
He stays kneeling until his knees ache, and then stays a little longer.
Tony brings them to a stop. “Okay, look – you just have to promise me that you’re not going to like, dismiss me from the ship for this.”
to talk to me. But I don’t get why you won’t even try. Is there something else I should be doing?”
Tony shrugs. “I had some time, I like to be helpful, must make my Captain happy, yada yada.”
Steve doesn’t really know what to say to that. Tony spews out egotism and self-deprecation in equal spades, and, honestly, Steve really isn’t sure which one Tony believes or what he’s supposed to believe.
Plus, Tony gets a feeling that Steve’s probably going to need friends, steady and kind friends, and there’s no better candidate for that than Pepper. It’d be nice for them to get along.
Maybe other people just suck in comparison to Steve.
a friend out of him. He likes Tony, he does, or he thinks he does, but how can he make Tony like him? It would take so much effort to try, to be sociable, to be around another human. It’s far easier to hide away, grunt responses, and speak only to JARVIS, who he can’t disappoint and who doesn’t have feelings to care about hurting.
On day thirty-four, Tony stops counting.
A field with orange grass, a sky of bright green, air that smells of pulled sugar.
Tony takes a moment to breathe through it, to savor the moment before he says it, before it becomes reality, before he says what he guessed after reading over the 21
“People wonder why.”
“The Iron Man suit,” Tony explains. “Nano-bit technology. I hit a button and it’ll disperse. Fancier than the original version. I always keep it on me, especially for away missions. You never know when you may need the protection.”
“Please don’t joke about that,” Steve says, sounding pained.
Other people managed to.
“Oh, that.” Tony smiles, all arrogance this time. “I made a couple upgrades to myself.” He motions to the table. “If you’re finished with your 102nd bagel, I have something to show you in more detail.”
“You’re not going to go.”
There’s a knock at the door, and Tony calls “Enter” without really thinking about it. The door cracks open and in walks Steve. Tony glances up, just barely taking in how Steve seems somewhat tentative for some reason, holding himself oddly in the doorway, and as Tony glances back down at the papers in his hand, his mind catches up to his eyes, and Tony looks back up in surprise.
Tony wants to think of the proper answer, the witty response that’ll smooth this over, the lie so perfected that there are no holes to poke, but his mind is blank.
(After all, as Tony later found out, it was his father’s choice to choose a human bride in an attempt to create better relations between Vulcan and Earth so Starfleet would choose Stark Industries as their photon torpedo contractor. The fact that it didn’t work wasn’t Starfleet’s fault.
“What in the goddamn fucking hell is all that—”
“Doing the hanky-panky, horizontal tango.”
“Good thing I know these halls – otherwise I would have been still searching for you during the blast.”
There was a reason he refused to take the Kobayashi Maru, and it wasn’t because he didn’t know how to pass it.
“Kick his ass,” Tony replies.
“Come on,” Steve says, gesturing to their left.
Tony can’t help but steal a quick glance down – Steve’s hand is open on the mattress, facing upwards. Most likely noticing Tony’s glimpse, it quickly disappears under the sheet.
Tony looks up, slightly startled. But then he shoots Steve a grin – part cocky, part clever, all trouble. “I’m going to do my one good deed for the year,” he replies.
Rogers’s eyebrows raise and he looks at Tony in something like surprised interest, but takes his hand for a quick, strong shake.
And so he tried. Oh, he tried.
He goes downstairs after eating a bagel, pats Roomba on the head, and starts creating a reinforced steel drone that dodges shots. He thinks,
The door takes a bit of doing to open. It broke in several places during the crash, and then froze in the odd shapes. Eventually, he just takes the repulsors to the hinges and hopes he hasn’t hit anything on the inside when they make it through.
“Not with the shields up.” He closes his eyes and presses the comm button again. “It will work. I promise. It will contain the entire blast. It will work.”
“God bless you,” Steve says automatically. His hand is twisting on the stems of the flowers, and Tony is insatiably curious.
“Yeah,” says Steve. “But it's probably more than that.”
“I want to pitch it to Starfleet,” he confesses. “As something to add to the ships, as a de-stresser for officers. If they’re feeling homesick, or whatever, they can come and simulate their home planet. I need to program more planets, and there’s some bugs when it comes to the AIs for other people, and I’ve yet to really figure out—”
“Denied,” Natasha dismisses immediately. “If we’re assuming this is a deliberate cut off, then we have to assume Captain Rogers is in danger. You have no security experience and, despite your strength, no training. I’m sending Clint and Drax.”
Tony ignores the question because it’s stupid, and instead asks, “How do you know this is it?” He, a parka-clad Coulson, and two other agents are standing in-front of a massive plane, halfway rooted into the Earth. “Couldn’t this be anything?”
“The world loves love,” Tony says, apparently without thinking, because his eyes are completely focused and scanning the text on his screen.
“Jesus
Tall – really tall. Blonde hair all pushed to one side. Wide, slumped shoulders. Gold uniform that fits just a little too snug. Eyes, kind eyes, wide in panic and fear. Perfect teeth. Spine as straight as his metaphorical one. Hands, calloused fingers. A world-weary smile.
With a sigh, he hides them in his fist. “JARVIS, disable communicators.” They don’t need to hear him die.
“Hey, comms are off – screw protocol, Steve was the one to break the mind-control device on Grenu, I owe him my life. What’s your idea?”
“Hey JARVIS,” Tony says, fingers tapping on the countertop. “I know what we’re doing tonight. Find someone somewhere willing to give me a couple million of them and deliver, pronto.”
he thinks.
“No, I got a little more dramatic of an upgrade in mind.”
(He didn’t.
– he’s really trying not to confuse Steve, okay – when Steve stands and tells the nice volunteer lady who has been in the corner staring at the Picasso on the wall like she’s an art major that they want to adopt the cat that Tony’s been touching.
“Do not,” Tony laughs, full and real. “Say that.”
He thinks of playing with his pet sehlat, laughing and laughing.
“That is not a Vulcan name,” his father replied, all steel.
Upon learning this, Tony had offered to build Bruce’s room from scratch with his own specs for free, so long as he was allowed to live alone in his own personal space in the engine rooms.
Steve stills – probably yelling, possibly pleading – the armor blocks all noise unless instructed to open a channel.
“Awesome,” Tony says, and means it sincerely for the first time in perhaps ever. “I would love to know what was in that original serum.”
“The Avengers Initiative,” Steve confirms. “Yes.”
Christ,” Tony bites out, his hand immediately going to his cradle neck. “What was that for?”
rejected the bond?”
“I like this guy, who is this?”
Tony had thought, hand balling into a fist.
“Of course it is. And may I say, it’s lovely to hear your dulcet tones. What do you want from me this time?”
“Why’d you need me to?” he asks conversationally, only curiosity, no judgment.
He considers it, for half a second. There’s always
But there was a little boy, six years old, with pointed ears but puffy brown hair, who had sat at the edge of his bed, refusing to feel his own tears, who had placed his head in his hands, and thought with a desperation verging on hysteria,
“Morning, Cap,” Tony greets.
I accepted the reality of the situation months ago, it’s just I got something I actually want to keep and suddenly, I’m what, ten years old again, crying because I realized I’d never have parents who will take those stupid Christmas card photographs?”
Steve fixes him with an annoyed look, then blurts, “Ask if you would kiss me, actually.”
Tony has a theory about things that mean a lot to him – pretend it doesn’t matter to you. That way, there isn’t the pressure for it to go right. The person doesn’t know they have the power to hit you where it hurts, and you can play off anything that happens.
“Expend your worry on something important.” He puts a hand on her shoulder. “Like how to run a Fortune 1 company.”
But then there’s Tony.
why are villains so on the nose? Was he just a huge Tolkien fan? – tries to take down Los Angeles over some anger about a movie that was greenlit about one of his failed attempts at taking down Chicago.
“Right,” Steve says, shaking his head like he’s clearing it. He takes a deep breath, and nods to himself, then looks right at Tony – and Tony’s starting to get a bad feeling about this. “I came in here to give you the flowers and ask—ask.” He grits his teeth. “Ask—”
“I’m worried I’m forgetting Bucky.”
“It is when you have a lot to live down,” Tony counters.
not, “Don’t worry, you couldn’t even if you tried.”
There’s probably a lot of answers. He loved Cap when he was a kid, and it figures something residual is there. He’s extremely curious at what the reaction is going to be. This is something that has never happened before in the history of the world, and he gets to witness it. There’s nothing else to do on this stupid boat. He despises being excluded.
“If it’s a live person, they won’t be for long,” Tony says, but dutifully lets the shield drop to his side and continues on.
Steve realizes at that moment that he’s been successfully interacting with someone for over an hour, and he’s actually a little proud of himself.
“Yeah, I actually got that,” Steve replies.
To let himself feel, to fall head first into the Vulcan soulbond, to let himself have what he’s craved, it would become everything. If it went away, if it walked away, if it died. It would be too much. It could break too much.
“Oh, come on,” Steve mutters, dropping his head into his hands.
not America’s poster boy.”
Later, after Vanko and Hammer, Tony had thought,
“The weapon the Klingon’s purchased fifteen years ago. The biological weapon.” An infinite, infinitesimal pause. “The one that decimated Tarsus IV.”
“Let him tell it, Tony,” Natasha admonishes.
“Minnesota, Georgia, same difference.”
“You’ve done your duty, now,” Tony says, and something about his tone must tip Steve off, because Steve visibly reels back in surprise. “You can go.”
T’Prau raises one perfect eyebrow, looking down at him in a way that emphasizes her four inches over him. She says it matter of fact, dismissive, and Tony is only three, he doesn’t yet know what she’s saying, what she means, but even he knows an insult when it’s directed at him.
“It’s not that,” Tony answers. “She just didn’t know I was leaving until I was already gone.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony says, heart beating, and he can’t help smiling. It reminds him of the few really, really good times in the past with Jarvis, Rhodey, Pepper – how his smile comes on accident, unbridled, and he can’t put it away.
“A phone?” Steve repeats. He’s deadpan, but he doesn’t look confused. Just thoughtful. “I guess making them smaller and portable would be helpful.”
“Steve,” Tony says. Steve’s still looking down at the diorama. “
“I know, Tony,” Rhodey says, digging his elbow into his stomach. “Why on Earth anyone thought you’d be the best person to house someone is beyond me.”
About two hours of Tony typing into a computer and doing something complicated with wires, he spits out a very angry, “Fucking Hammer.”
Tony sighs, closing his eyes and dropping his head onto his arms. His hands tighten on the mug.
“I—I don’t know how to do this.”
Medbay is almost completely empty, sans a young ensign receiving a booster hypo-spray and a nurse taking inventory of their chemical stock in the back.
“Hey, Steve, think you can hold them off for a second? I want to get out of the suit and see if one I just blew still has its computer in it. If I can get a look at its code, I might be able to figure out where the hell they came from and what the hell they’re doing.”
He presses the button. The screen goes green – and they’re live.
“Jesus,” Tony says.
Tony was dripping water from being pushed underneath until he was forced to go into a meditative state then yanked out, he was holding a battery attached to his chest that will electrocute him if it gets damp, he hadn’t had a meal in two days, for all the water his thirst was starting to weaken him, his foot was broken and blue, his right arm was ripped raw and green, and somehow, oh somehow, it was the words that strike something through him worse than anything he has ever endured.
“What do you want?”
(He still filled one box in full, black. A guess at which one.))
His father had explained the business long ago, before Tony could even build a warp drive from scratch.
Binary.
“Jesus, are you trying to seduce me? Is this a honeypot mission or something?”
“I know it,” Tony says.
But Tony’s good at pushing people out of their comfort zones. He prods and annoys and pokes until people get fed up and inevitably turn and push back.
Steve opens his eyes, looking spaced out and confused all it once.
“No, I mean I am calling sitting here freezing my ass off when I don’t have to.”
He leans down under the seat that he claimed as his from the moment he walked on and pulls out a briefcase. He pulls it up between him and the woman – what is her name, anyway? Judy? This is why he needs JARVIS in his glasses as well as the HUD – and opens it, carefully hiding its contents from her until it’s deploying.
“Funnily enough, it wasn’t actually about Starfleet this time.” Steve shimmies slightly up the pillow to a sitting position. “Everything was fine during the dinner, but there was a lag-time in between eating and the meeting. One of the other Captains – Ronan, I believe, of Kree – was in the back corner, messing with some orb-device. Everyone was giving him space, but he was making everyone a little uncomfortable. I guess that was probably what took down communications. Anyway, one of the other leaders went to try to use the lavatory, she found all the doors locked. Then Ronan stood up and started loudly monologuing about his hatred of Xandarians and how killing their leader will be the first message in declaration of war, and then I threw my dinner plate at his head, and then I sort of lost track of things.”
“Ready?” he asks. He’s still and quiet, no smile, no joy.
“Wait, what?” Steve repeats, his eyes wide. “Did you—Saliva? It was bad?”
When Tony was thirty-one, before he was captured, after he was a billionaire, after he was the top weapons distributor in the galaxy, after he made a media appearance that was broadcast to seventy-two different planets, after he had visited 661 planets, after being named the most successful man in the galaxy by
“THAT REAL, ROGERS?”
He needs to make a decision about what path to take or he’ll split in two and cause more damage than either path alone.
Tony’s approach to emotional conversations – pretending they’re not happening – isn’t Steve’s favorite, so, with a hand, he turns off the stove, and gently turns Tony towards him.
“I—” Well, why not. “Okay. I trust you.”
They talk through blowing shit up, and Tony tells Steve, almost unthinkingly, about his first girlfriend sleeping with him to steal Stark Industries proprietary information off his laptop when he was sleeping.
“How did
to feel more, and worse, less able
Steve looks like he’s going to argue, but in the end, he drops Tony’s eyes, nods once, and steps back.
“Pepper,” he says loudly, effectively cutting her off. “I am an eccentric, genius billionaire. Maybe I am tired of the limelight. Maybe I don’t like interviews. Maybe I hired a Russian mail order bride and want to enjoy her for a year in peace and quiet.”
They say as if it should be obvious.
“Hello,” Steve greets. “Miss Potts, I presume?”
“Right. From the element powering the reactor.”
He’s caught up in his own thoughts, purposefully drowning out the extra input his senses constantly throw at him, that he almost misses the question.
Day twenty-two through twenty-nine, Steve learns about Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings, Jurassic Park, Disney, and Indiana Jones. Tony learns that Steve looks like he’s bored all the time but actually only falls asleep during dialogue heavy parts, that he really likes modern special effects, and likes sweet popcorn flavorings more than savory.
He thinks about T’Long, the teacher that introduced him to robotics after school hours, and let him stay in her room, building nonsense while she graded, knowingly or not helping him avoid bullies for an entire year.
Tony stands still for almost a full minute, simply listening, letting the sounds mix through the air. The minors fall and the piano trickles off, final note a strong but quiet C, and Tony finds himself walking through the door, despite instinctively knowing what’s on the other side.
“The new Captain. I know you’ve read the reports.” He hasn’t. His face must betray him, because she raises an eyebrow. “He was found on an old ship, carrying cryo-frozen experiments from the early 2000s eugenics war. He’s one of the supersoldiers.”
He listens to JARVIS’s reports of information Tony has complied as he works out, which brings him to point 2: working till he drops.
“Bucky,” Steve immediately corrects, tone cutting and sharp, and Tony almost reels back in surprise. “Sorry,” Steve apologies instantly. He rubs a hand on the back of his neck. “That’s kind of a – a sore spot.”
He also wears a hat, sunglasses, and purposefully dresses like a poor farmer.
He’s obviously distracted, focusing on some wiring, not the best time to ask an ethical dilemma question – but Steve just can’t keep it to himself anymore.
“My shield? Whatever for?”
The automatic doors spring open with a rush of wind that almost makes him shiver. He catches sight of Steve, who’s sitting on one leg, almost curled into a sofa cushion, one hand holding open a real, antique paperback book, the other in his hair.
(Tony remembers once when he was cornered after leaving his schooling for the day. Sterok, Stonack, and T’Prog had pulled him behind the building, pushed him against the wall, and had pulled out a small knife.
When MIT rolls around, he decides it’s far more fun to flirt with death than scare it off. He sets fire to his insides for fun, and every morning that he wakes up with a black-out memory or feeling like he’s rotting, his own funeral flashes across his eyes.
Jarvis had found him several hours later, sitting in the middle of his room, shaving his eyebrows into a straight line.
“Shit,” Tony swears. His other hand’s fingers find Steve’s pulse, and after a heart-stopping moment, he feels the slow pump-pump-pump of a beat. He hands his head, almost light-headed in relief, before looking up at Clint. “We need to get him medical attention, now.”
“I’m definitely not going after anyone,” Steve says, feeling a little lost.
“The drones were modeled after the armor, they would shoot each other,” Hammer interrupts, angry and twitching. “It had to be your face.”
“Why don’t you want to look into who he is? He had arc reactor technology, if that gets out—”
“I’ll die before we get anywhere.”
He pulls back and disassembles the armor, it folding back into the briefcase with ease. Once it’s off, he turns back to Steve, slightly stiffly. Steve’s wide, blue, innocent eyes smooths some of his hackles.
how is that short sighted? No one else in the world has the balls to just do what has to be done for the best of everyone. I worked my entire
“Okay,” Tony says, spinning around to face Steve. “I think I was going to take you through 1990s music videos?”
“Slow the regeneration process? You’re talking about deactivating the serum.”
As Steve expected, they find a window to the basement around the next wall. Steve pulls the metal bars out to Tony’s silence, and kicks the glass through, shattering it, and they both fold their way down into the building.
He’s sleep deprived and upset and he actually fell over when getting off his chair – and he doesn’t want this to be over, not
“Okay, sure.”
“I’m sure you didn’t expect Steve to be Steve,” Tony says, with probably far too much glee in his voice. “God, I hope we never tell anyone who you really are, Steve, this surprised look of horror when you can crush steel with your fingertips is fantastic. Really, picture worthy. Though did you have to throw him through the wall? It’s a bitch to get contractors up this many floors.”
God, there’s something about Steve’s face, his tone, that makes him just impossible to read. He could be aiming to kiss or shank Tony, and Tony would be none the wiser to either. It throws him off balance – it’s a lot harder to react to someone when they don’t show how they’re reacting to you.
“Me too,” Tony says, meaning it. He knows himself, and he knows how he was at that age. A man of Steve’s caliber, conviction, appearance, willpower. He would have fallen, hook line and sinker, and probably grown up either infatuated or with a chip on his shoulder. That’s one fewer emotional issue to have to work through when it comes to Steve. “You were a big name in the eugenics war, weren't you? Stormed camps, killed bad guys, made a lot of news? You and your other enhanced friend – the Winter Soldier.”
Steve just looks at him like he’s dumb, which isn’t a look Tony’s all that accustomed to seeing, and says, “Of course not. They’re not you.”
It doesn’t make the news.
“Why me?” Tony asks, confused. “Was it to brighten up my room? I can get fake ones for that if this place is too dull.”
Steve looks interested, but they’re basically at the tower, and Tony’s not fabulous at giving layman’s descriptions, so he just asks Happy to pull up in front of the sidewalk.
“I’m not saying I want the position back, God forbid, no, what I’m saying is that it’s really hard to spend all this extra time keeping you company if you won’t let me keep you company. I get that this is all overwhelming, but you haven’t left the tower since you got here, which rivals me on my worst times, really, which is saying something, and isn’t there stuff you want to see and do, good god, this gym isn’t
“This is stupid,” Tony snaps, effectively cutting off whatever Steve was about to say. Steve is actually a bit relieved. “I’m talking nonsense. JARVIS, turn the TV on. I don’t care what station.”
observation. The act of being purposeful about it seems to open up an entire other side to Tony – the physical side.
There’s the worse – like how America’s foreign policy seemed to peak with WWII, apparently global warming exists, fashion has become almost completely inexplicable, chain stores have become the norm instead of the exception, Brooklyn is now for the posh, mass shootings are now a thing, the Catholic church scandal in Ireland, people haven’t gotten any better at telling the truth just because they got a global communication platform, and so on.
about something coming together, and he almost wishes he could just do another one of his 72 hour binge designs again, though he really thinks it would actually kill him nowadays.
“What, Steve?”
“Uh,” Steve says eloquently.
There’s a pause, and logically, Tony knows he can’t
Tony interrupts, eyes caught on his hand. “Wait.”
Pushing it away, Steve makes a split-second decision, and stands right underneath the falling armor.
Tony finds himself snorting before he can think better of it. Steve’s eyebrows raise in clear question, and Tony shrugs, a little too dramatically. “Nothing.” Steve cocks his head 7 degrees to the right, and Tony folds. “Just –
People complain a lot about the state of the world, Steve knows. JARVIS told him. But they’re looking upward from their place on the shoulders of giants, imagining higher.
“Tony!” Steve yells again.
“I thought you’d be upset.”
He thinks of the Vulcan-given computational skills that let him invent his life’s work.
The Romulan chuckled, with little humor. “You think your weapons stayed within the wars you sent them to?”
“Then you can make some sort of machine, some sort of contraption, Rube-Goldberg or something, that turns it on for you.”
Tony opens the door and pulls Steve out behind him.
(Or inherited one, if you wanted to be pedantic about it, which most of the original Vulcan investors certainly did.)
“I wanted to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible,” Vanko says. “You wouldn’t come out in public, though, so I had to come to you. I was looking for you but found—” His hand twitches, probably trying to point to Steve. “Killing you would be great - but what better way to show your vulnerability than to show you can’t protect those you love?”
too much about Tony to be led astray by any of Tony’s diversion tactics.
“Well, hooty-hoo, I’m in love with you, this isn’t mortifying at all.”
“It is time for you to make a decision, Tony.”
Tony recognizes that there may be something else going on here, on his end. It may be less about Steve’s actions and slightly more about the previous betrayals of trust, about Obadiah, about loss of control in a situation where he's already so helpless.
He should know better than to ask Tony a question about his own technology, especially with his fair skin and the radiation of this sun – but apparently, he doesn’t, and thus is put through a near quarter of an hour explanation, all the while he looks more and more impressed.
“We’ll get there in your pop culture education,” Tony says, flapping his hand. “Come on, follow me.”
death because it makes
“Could you do anything with it even if it was?” Steve asks out of sheer curiosity. “I mean, it’s patented to Hammer, right?” It’s odd - Steve never would have thought Tony would consider intellectual property theft.
“I’m just saying.” Tony holds up his hands. “Just saying. You can’t do stuff like that.”
“It—” His heart is beating, oh god, his blood is pumping so quickly. “It looks to be some sort of – new element.”
“You deserved to know, so I told you. Don’t make me regret it,” Tony warns. He pulls his arm free, and leaves Steve standing there, one hand holding the back of the chair, the other still raised in midair.
He may die within a year, but he’s fairly certain even if he did make it to 100, nothing would quite beat the look on Coulson’s face at seeing him holding Captain America’s perfectly preserved, and possible alive, body.
“—for signs, and I just think—”
(One of Fury’s requirements for Tony assuming his position on The Avenger was that Tony have weekly counseling appointments. He hadn’t even argued, which said something about how he felt of his own mind, at the time.
And Tony has every choice to say no.
“Fair?” Tony repeats.
What’s one more stain on his ledger?
He shakes his head.
“I didn’t like being propaganda then, when I even believed in the cause.”
that lets us hack in from the outside.”
But Steve – Steve’s just a person who chose to be around Tony, and keeps choosing to be around Tony, and who, if given the choice, Tony would choose right back.
Tony looks up, head cocking, and a smile starting to break out.
“But—"
He probably doesn’t look impressed enough to Tony’s standards, mostly because he really isn’t sure what it can do, nor does he know what is impressive by today’s standards, so Tony shows him a lot of grainy footage of him blowing up terrorist cells.
Steve can’t back out now. After all the time, effort, money, and thought Tony has put into this? To just step aside and say, hm, how about I
“That’s a valid—”
Tony’s hands slam on the table with a bang, and Steve jumps back.
“Do you want me to write a list?” Steve asks, sounding bewildered.
“And it’s frustrating and disappointing and sometimes you think you can change the facts but you just, no matter what you do, how badly you decide you want it, despite not even caring all that much before, even thinking you deserved it before, you want it
Steve’s was the most uncomfortable, the most painful. It’s not like he wanted Steve to shrug it off, to not care, but to watch the horror, disappointment, and confusion fill his eyes was far worse than Tony imagined. Tony had left the room twitchy and upset, and, not wanting to face that reaction again, had called Rhodey.
Steve returns two minutes later.
“Easy, there, Captain,” Coulson says. His voice is soft and steady, and maybe he had a point when he told Tony to let him do all the talking and to shut his mouth unless necessary.
Steve looks up at the ceiling, and lets out a shaking breath. He’s no longer hungry, and he feels the urge to cry, just like he did in that bar back with Peggy; real, long, heavy tears, just for the memory of someone who no one is alive anymore to remember, who no one knows or cares about how much he truly was, how much of the revered and idolized Captain America was made from parts that Bucky influenced, that Bucky put and held together.
"I'm glad we made it here," Steve says. "Both of us."
Steve shakes his head slightly, and focuses back into the conversation going on around him. At some point, Tony stood and is now leaning up against the countertop. Pepper is a couple feet away, pinching her nose in exasperation.
“Self-reliance is fine when you’re alone, you know that, Steve? As long as you’re isolated, you don’t know what you’re missing. But once someone is around, boom,” he mimes a boom with his hands. “Suddenly you just want to tell everybody everything. Even though it doesn’t make a damn bit of difference.” He turns his head, staring at Steve straight on, and Steve feels utterly helpless.
“Clearly, that relationship didn’t mean much to either of you. I am more concerned with the second part, here. The t’hy’la bond.”
Back in the day, it most likely would have pissed Steve off a bit. Growing up in the depression taught Steve a lot, and one of those things was that most rich people like being rich more than they like other people.
“I don’t know the words,” Steve admits. “But I can just be here for you.”
He stops.
“I’m talking about my dick,” Tony explains helpfully.
At that, Steve’s out of his seat like an arrow from a quiver, heading to the basement with a restless, nervous energy that manifests in his hand opening and closing without his permission.
“No, no,” Tony stammered weakly, blood and water and grime falling from his spit. “No – not Tarsus. I had nothing to do with Tarsus.”
“No. It felt like a dream. My therapist says it’s disassociation, where the brain can’t make sense of what its seeing, so it tries to create a barrier between what you think is real and what you are perceiving.” Tony turns, and Steve is frowning. “I think that’s what she said, anyway.”
Tony huffs a laugh. “You understand me so well, dear.”
“Oh my God,” Steve mutters, and runs a hand down his face, looking pained. “I am poorly asking you if you’re interested in dating me.”
The suit leaves, and, one minute later, without hesitation, he raises the shields.
sharp and hot in his stomach when Tony visibly grits his teeth.
“The saying is Fortune 500,” she says, but the corners of her mouth are twitching.
is going to be there, and is surprised into dropping his mouse a few inches when he sees Coulson.
I said maybe we want him to still have his larynx in case we have questions.”
He puts the berries in his mouth and begins to chew, staring out the large window to open space to where can see the very corner of the Avenger. The berries are hard through and through, and taste somewhat like a plomeek, though there is an odd acidity that Tony did not expect.
Steve’s been looking but not touching, and it’s making Tony twitch. He’s a hands-on type guy. This kind of restraint is uncomfortable.
It didn’t turn out exactly as he hoped.
“I don’t think you’ve fucked up with me,” Steve says carefully. It’s almost ironic, Steve being in this position, when he feels so intimately the words Tony’s saying. He’s good at so much, but when it comes to talking to the people he cares about - he fails. Consistently, considerably.
“This isn’t really why we brought you—”
Though he does make a mental note to ask Tony when everyone got these robot helpers in the house. Tony said the future didn’t live up to the past’s expectations, but this seemed to surpass them.
“Your father ruined my father’s life!” Vanko manages out through Steve’s grip on his windpipe.
Occasionally, though, he wishes he saw Bruce more often.
“The means matters when you’re in Starfleet. You aren’t part of the resistance anymore. You’re part of the empire.”
“No. It was for the Klingons, supposedly supposed to be just a scare tactic against a Romulan army squadron stationed on a planet.” He never knew it would spread – he never knew it would leave that particular planet. He never thought it would be used, in reality – a scare tactic, and at worst a destroyer of soldiers, not civilians.
Steve seems surprised into silence, and Tony leans forward.
“Yes, but that way you can’t brag about being on top. And you know how I love being on top.”
“You have nothing to thank me for,” says Steve, slow, confused.
And fuck – this whole thing has maybe gotten out of hand.
” Vanko hisses, and oh, Tony actually might remember this guy for real. “And then he deported him—”
“Well,” Tony says, stuck slightly stunned in the doorway. “That’s unexpected.”
“I’m not joking, I’m serious, group therapy is a legitimate—”
Steve isn’t too far behind, which takes Tony a second to notice.
“And?” Tony asks.
A logical statement, one that Tony wants to refute immediately. A bed in a cave is not the same as a bed at home. But, perhaps, to someone without a home, it may not matter.
that and not have it be around?”
“Meow,” she replies.
people. Not a person who owns more property than some small countries, who has billions of dollars to decide where goes, more than 80,000 employees to secure the fate of, entire departments that depend on his mind for products that are going to need years of material until he can be (somewhat) replaced – and the list goes on, down to number 104, or so far.
“Sir,” JARVIS interrupts, but Tony can see Steve start to let go, though he keeps a firm grip on his neck, and his other hand goes to secure the man’s right hand, which was twitching. “I have identified him as Ivan Vanko, the son of a Russian physicist.”
He catches himself quickly, makes a quip about his leg being asleep, then quickly exits.
The whine of the transporter fills the room, and Tony shifts in place, watching the beams of light that precede the new Captain’s entrance.
Tony looks over to where it’s standing.
He’s silent.
“Okay, so, you probably want to know what this about.”
Despite the fact he doesn’t really want to, there isn’t really any reason not to, so he lets JARVIS guide him down a flight of stairs and into a kitchen that is easily twice the size of his apartment growing up.
“Oh. There’s a name.”
Maybe he just didn’t want to die anymore.)
“You know what?” His feet clatter to the floor. “Sign me up.”
“No, not that,” he dismisses with a shake of his head. He stops for a second, cocking his head thoughtfully. “Though I appreciate that you know I have the authority to stop a 100+ manned governmental expedition just because my extremities are getting tingly. I’d give you a round of applause if I could feel my fingers.”
On day five-after, which is actually day 18, Tony spends over an hour in his room trying to come up with a single idea of what to do today.
“You doing okay?” Steve asks, as lightly as he can manage. Too serious, and Tony’s walls will slam down.
after his absence. He could run the city on reactor technology, but there’s other things to think about – phones, cars, appliances. And even more – third world countries and community outreach. He’d love to have a better charity guide left in his absence. He trusts Pepper to do it, but it’d be helpful if she had something clear to do.
“New element? That’s impressive.”
The stupider part of his head wants to say it’s because he’s afraid the serum will stop working given his years of inactivity.
“You got it.”
a part of the fence off its connectors, and throws it like a goddamn
“Yeah, see. Anyway, by this point, someone had alerted
It’s not an unwelcome sight to his corrupted mind – that is, until he got a phone call that he better start planning his parents’ one.
“Of course it was, everything was my idea—”
“They discharged me two days ago, Tony,” Steve points out, with some amusement, though Tony catalogues that he does look down at his feet as they continue through engineering.
Tony seems hesitant in a way that Tony is never hesitant, and it has Steve sitting up straighter.
The lock to the door blasts off, and Steve’s immediately pushing through at run, cataloging how Hammer whirls around and his phone goes flying. Tony flies in behind him, landing about three feet in front of Hammer, one knee and his fist to the ground. Steve just
Tony doesn’t know what he’s going to say – dear Lord, he hopes it’s not something vaguely homophobic – but he does know he doesn’t want to hear anything that’s going to make this not happen, so he just leans forward, and goes for it.
“Yeah, it looks good,” he says. Tony glares at him a little, and he wishes, for once, he could know what to say to someone.
There’s a hand on his shoulder, and he’s being spun around.
Coulson hands them off to Steve.
“I am not ready.”
Steve’s a little embarrassed to admit it later, but he spends the next fifteen minutes after that – and there’s no other word for it – interrogating Tony. Tony’s a remarkably good sport about it, despite his eyes widening almost comically when Steve clasped his shoulders and stared him in the eye, or how he leaned back so far to get away from Steve’s touch that he actually tripped over his own foot.
“Are you excited, Commander Stark?”
That first question comes back, Tony’s voice echoing in his mind.
Twenty minutes later, in the debrief, he becomes all-too-aware of the source of her anger.
“All this accumulation of knowledge,” Tony says one day, when they’re watching WALL-E. Steve is trying to make it through all of the Pixar movies. “You now could write like, 70 years of entertainment.”
It’s been about an hour, and Steve’s drop kicked a guy down the stairs, punched through about fifteen bots, survived a four story fall, shrugged off a bot to the face, flipped his motorcycle straight into a helicopter (he’s going to have to apologize – it’s the second he’s gone through in as many months), as well as almost snapped someone’s neck with an uncalculatedly strong punch.
Steve takes a step closer. They’re chest to chest. “You can sink or swim, right? I am not letting you give up.”
The third time he uses a word that Tony has to look up the meaning of, he wonders why he’s even bothering. If he should even bother.
Tony’s waiting for Steve to finish with his morning workout – he wonders why Steve bothers, sometimes; the muscles survived inactivity for 70 years, does he
“I never thought—I mean, never in my wildest dreams—or, okay, maybe in a third of my wildest dreams—”
Or so he had once thought.)
Even then, given the distance, it couldn't be in real-time, and instead was a sub-space communication, text-only for faster travel.
He got a squawk in response, but no lifted leg, and he wondered what that meant in terms of their relationship.
okay?”
That night, Steve asks him to watch Casablanca.
“Thank you,” a voice says behind them. They both turn, slightly startled, and there’s a young woman – probably Terran, though something in Tony’s psi-readings hints that there may be telepathic blood in her. “I did the restoration.”
It didn’t take long for Tony to explain what was going on - though explain was most likely an overstatement. Tony had said, “Hammer owns a rival tech company and he’s had a vendetta against me for a while, especially recently given I embarrassed his skinny ass in front of most of the US legislature. This was a remarkably unclassy way to try to take me out. He probably just wanted it public. Whatever. Dumbass tweeted an hour ago, was able to trace the location. He’s in one of his tech development facilities that is technically supposed to be in Cuba. Again, dumbass.”
“I need you to do it!”
It does come loose, in the end. He needs both hands to carry him, which means needing some creativity to also carry the shield. He balances it against the Captain’s torso, though it’s slippery with the ice, and he silently apologies for treat him like a desk.
And so Steve keeps wandering down this path, completely oblivious to where it leads, letting himself pay attention to everything about Tony, fitting in the physical details with what he already knew about Tony’s personality, finally having an image in his head of a full, complete person. And he doesn’t question his motives, doesn’t question the effects, not even once.
(After the capture, he had quickly contracted.
The next three weeks are – odd.
“What—”
“I don’t want them to hurt anyone.”
Those mushy feelings burst into a swell, a landslide, and Tony squeezes back.
“Tony?”
“On the ship?”
Tony has, perhaps, never felt so satisfied in his entire life.
Steve asks, but only once.
“Right on the money, Rogers, way to go,” Tony confirms. “Good addition skills.”
“Curiosity? Chop chop, which one?”
“I wonder what he’ll be like,” Bruce muses. He has a bit of jam still on his mouth.
“Cats are fine,” Tony says, hand still on her head. “Cats ride roombas, cats keep the internet alive, cats don’t need to be taken out every ten minutes.”
“I know,” Steve says. “I know, Tony.”
“Pepper,” she corrects. “And you are?”
“Natasha,” he pleads. “You wouldn’t know he was in danger without me. I can help. I can find him, I can – I can help.”
Love – it’s too much.
“Sure,” Tony shrugs, and Steve looks taken aback.
“Legos?” Steve repeats. His brow is furrowed. “Wait, aren’t those waffles or something? I saw them in the freezer.”
The team finds out, of course, and they’re – quietly supportive, Steve decides. He gets a couple pats on the back, a knocked shoulder from Clint, a spirited “I am happy for you” from Thor, and even a nod from Fury.
“A lot of ‘my’s’ there, you narcissist.”
“He was monologuing about
“Yes, Tony, they could!”
Steve glances over at him. It seems to take a moment for the words to register. “Yes, but it was before my time.”
Hey, if they didn’t want him hacking shit, they shouldn’t have used Stark Tech.
Tony wonders what he can say that will make him leave without being unforgivably rude. “I suppose I could go and write a quick musical about the timeline of my life and sing it for you. It may contain nudity at the beginning, I warn you.”
Other items, like who to make CEO and where all his shit will go, are easier. He’s considering ranking them by difficulty level so he can actually get started on some of the less daunting aspects, when his phone goes off.
Tony blinks, and pushes his mushy-relationship feelings to the side. He'll deal with them in a moment. "Assessment?"
They weren’t looking for the color. They were looking for it to drip.)
“I have experience with the warhead ships, Director,” Steve says. The concern is radiating off him. “But I don’t have hands-on experience with the warheads themselves.”
Get out of my face with that bullshit that nothing improves. If nothing improves, I’d have been better off dying last year.
“Did you need something from me?”
“What?” Tony snaps, defensively. He resists the urge to cover them with his hands. “What about them?”
“Huh.”
Steve puts a hand onto Coulson’s shoulder. “Phil, how about I walk you out?”
“For me being gone,” Tony says, and something in Steve freezes, clenches, and then speeds up. If it were a movie, an anxious soundtrack would have started, full of strings and low notes.
His foot pushed away the snow – and red, white and blue and the peak of a star is poking out.
His pinky twitches and, horrifyingly, he feels a heat behind his eyes.
“Eco-terrorism.” The bond blanks. “Biological warfare. You didn’t read my full background, did you?”
“Aw, paid off so easily, like a newsie,” Tony quips. “Do you like prison, Hammer? Because it likes you. It’ll be a nice, thirty, forty-year marriage.”
“No, actually, not today. This is actually a well thought out decision. Sort of. It was a little spur of the moment, but my best decisions are.” She’s still staring at him, and Tony rolls his eyes, and steps forward. He takes Pepper’s hands and looks her in the eye. “Pepper, I’ve been thinking about quitting for months now. I don’t care about it anymore. You’re the only one with the experience and who I trust enough to do this.”
Tony skims the rest, uninterested, scrolling until he reaches the end summary:
“From what you told me, I’m sure that’s exactly what he would have thought. He would
There’s silence on the comms, a silence the speaks to being purposefully muted by the other side. Tony waits, and then waits, and after 33.2 excruciating seconds, he says, “Do you copy?”
throw off his AI, but who knows, JARVIS has been creeping closer to sentience for years now. The way he pauses makes Tony grin.
So, with a deep breath and an incredible amount of apprehension for someone who used to be a soldier, he heads through the workshop.
depicts an old Earth food – a soup can.”
Captain (or close enough) – he just told them what to do and they did it.
Once Tony knows what buttons not to push, starts to anticipate how to ask questions to get an answer, figures out what's most likely to make Steve laugh and what's more likely to make him clam up - it gets to be just plain
"It needed to be fixed." Tony shrugged. "I fixed it."
degree premeditated murder. Hammer deserves a long and unhealthy jail sentence.
(Staring at the stars, he thinks there are worse places to die.)
Tony breezes right on by. “Which, surprise, is today, in fifteen minutes, so you can’t back out, and there isn’t any chance of it leaking to any baddies.”
time he tried it, and he’ll think about how he wasn’t thinking about any of that, any of his programming, about how the only thing he was thinking of was Steve’s bright, happy laughing, of his own pervasive contentment, and he will think,
“My mother warned me not to converse with half-breeds.”
Inside the plane is mostly just snow and ice covered. The armor’s feet crunch the snow, leaving wide footprints, and he does consider that he maybe should have asked what exactly it was he was looking for.
The countdown is within a minute, now.
lock off the gate, then opened the gate—”
It’s silent as Tony warms up some left-over food.
“Where are you going?” Steve finds himself asking.
“He’s
Coulson looks like he's making to leave, but hesitates. “Stark, I did want you to know, we are extending every resource into trying to solve this for you.”
Coulson is too good to look fully annoyed, but there’s definitely some type of gleam in his eye. “You didn’t have to come. I seem to remember saying it was a courtesy call.”
Steve’s seen the reactor just that morning, so he ignores that one completely.
“You may not have had any responses then, sir,” JARVIS inputs, and Steve has completely lost the thread of this conversation.
It isn’t perfect – trust him, he realizes that – but he also realizes it IS better. In a lot of ways, and in a lot of ways he doesn’t think the world will be able to take that step back from.
He’s dying, and this will possibly be the last interesting thing he’ll ever get to do.
“We’ll find a way to get you out.”
“Yep. Take a few steps away from the hole, okay?”
He learned that young, before he has any memories that lasted. It comes with the territory – you make one prototype, and it explodes. So you make another. And another. And another. And another.
Tony flips off the screen once he leaves.
There’s what hasn’t gotten better – homelessness, orphans, abused wives and children, poor working conditions, prejudice, stale bread, dishonest politicians, how long it takes to cook a roast, bigger money and dumber heads, rude people, sickness.
“Made a mess of what?” Tony doesn’t answer. “Look, Tony, I want to help, but I’m not following anything you’re saying.”
“Steve,” Tony says, perfectly even, he believes. “A penny couldn’t hurt someone at terminal velocity. Neither could a flower.”
“Oh my God, I’ll never know the ending to the new Star Wars franchise.”
For the first time, Steve feels a spike of unease.
“No,” Steve agrees, tired. “But I could have saved
“On the plus side, you could make your friends insanely jealous with your guessing of plot skills.”
Tony gets high, high enough that they’re specks, and suddenly everything is falling – everything, all the drones, like lead weight, and the Iron Man armor, going down, down, down.
“How long will it take you to deactivate it?”
that? You’re the one experimenting with men.”
Tony stares at him blankly. “Because it’s mine.”
(He still doesn’t know if it was from the Vulcan or human side.)
“Maybe not as a whole, but you can’t act like you know more than everyone at everything. You haven’t exhausted their intelligence. Man up and take the help.”
“Tony, please don’t say no.”
“I am assuming the boy band Nick Fury is putting together.”
Steve frowns his way through making dinner, and only realizes hours later that Tony had clutched that weird power source in his lap the entire ride back to the tower.
“I thought about it, but yes, I turned them down.”
“Hi Tony,” and oh, he sounds so tired.
Tony looks down at his groin, and Steve immediately follows up with, “Your chest glows.”
“Sir?” JARVIS prompts.
There’s a pregnant pause where all they can hear is the running of the fridge. It takes a moment, but Tony sighs, and leans his head into his hand.
about the world –  God, his reaction to Time’s Square and Vegas Tony is dying for, he truly is – but it’d be best to actually think through what order it should all come. It’s going to be confusing; there’s 70 years of puzzle pieces, and if he isn’t careful about what order he puts them together, the picture is just going to be more confusing than if he didn’t do anything at all.
Steve’s lips are dry against his own, but gentle, and his hand is so soft cradling the back of his neck. Tony’s careful with his response, following Steve’s lead and letting Steve have control, pressing back softly but noticeably. Tony can’t help but catalogue the sensations of the kiss: the small exhale of breath as Steve pulls back a fraction, the fullness of his bottom lip, the heat from his mouth, the slow trembling of his hand. Tony lifts his own hand and places it gently on Steve’s hip, fingers pressing in softly, and he can feel the stutter of breath as Steve feels his response.
“The what?” Romanoff snaps.
“Forgiveness, not permission,” Steve says, and the words and his tone make Tony pause.
“You’re what?” Tony questions, preoccupied. He’s focused on the wiring and not paying as close of attention to the conversation than he should, but he did not follow that train of thought.
“You’ve been looking at it from the angle of ‘how can I find an alcohol strong enough that my body will process slower.' But when I was staring at it, trying to think of how a particle accelerator would interact with your blood, I just got hit by this thought –  why can’t we just reverse that? I can slow down the regeneration process long enough that you can drunk. And now I must try it.”
bit brash, and this conversation is probably going to take extreme diplomacy and decorum to explain properly. Tony made an equally valid counter point that his family funded the expedition and he was the one to return the body and
Tony skids to a halt by him, and, upon being closer, he can see a welt on his head and a gaping, bleeding flesh wound in his abdomen. Immediately, Tony covers the bleeding with one hand, pressing down hard.
“Cut the bullshit. I hacked the drones in half a minute and they instantly led me back to you. They had direct coding to go to the tower, shoot at the windows, and then target and kill anyone with my facial pattern? You incompetent idiot? Did you really think I wouldn’t be able to figure it out?”
He knows Tony wants to show him around and teach him. That first week, Tony was startling persistent, sending in food every day for Steve to try, and coming around every morning, afternoon, and night around to ask if Steve wants to do this, learn that, go here, try this over there. He was also startlingly understanding when Steve always, always grunted a no. He just left with a perky, “Okay, then,” and headed out, presumably to work on something in his workshop. Since files kept popping up in JARVIS’s list, he knows Tony was still spending at least some of his time on him, despite Steve’s constant rejection.
“Hey, Rhodey, I’ve been meaning to ask, if you could have any of my houses, which would you take?”
“The costume wasn’t my idea. I didn’t sign up to be a war poster for America. I just don’t like bullies; it doesn’t matter who they are. Even if it’s America. Maybe especially.”
But Steve’s arm is around his shoulders – when did
not to be fact. But what you want doesn’t matter, you know?”
They walk their way through the winding hallways, Tony’s heavy footsteps echoing far louder than Steve would like. His shield is at his side, ready, but they don’t run into a single person through the halls. There’s several rooms they bust open – an empty lab for biology experiments, what looks like a bedroom, and a broom closet.
Finally, Captain Rogers turns to Tony. The tiny curve to his lips is at odds with the strength of the rest of his features. “And that would make you Commander Stark, correct? My chief engineer?”
“Tony,” Steve starts carefully. “You’ve given me someone to talk to about all my problems. Let me return the favor.”
“Then you turned them down?”
“You read about Vulcans, then?” he asks at last.
At least Tony always knows what Pepper’s thinking.
“Actually, Tony, speaking of Coulson,” Steve says. His hands are fiddling with each other a little, and Tony looks over.
JARVIS is drowned out by a startlingly large noise, one that makes Tony legitimately sit up in surprise, one that would make him worry for his heart if it wasn’t already shredded. It sounds like someone threw a microwave through the wall.
“Dandy, I’m sure the tax payers would appreciate that.”
Singular, because it wasn’t the Vulcan way to bury the dead. There was no point, after all. It wasted land and fouled the soil. After the ceremony was completed out of respect for the dead’s achievements, bodies were donated to science and hospitals.
Tony’s done wasting time on this conversation like, pronto. The cold makes the metal casing of the reactor act up with the flesh surrounding it no matter how well integrated it is into the armor. Plus, he’s starting to feel slightly on the wrong side of normal, which has been happening more and more as the poisoning starts taking effect.
Steve looks doubtful, but he does reach forward and press the window button. The window goes down, dutifully. “Huh,” he says. “Convenient.”
“It’s a turtle.” Steve glances up, face scrunched in skepticism. “Or not a turtle,” Tony corrects. “Technically a tortonia. First found in 2147, named by a Mr. Randall Coveney, an explorer from Earth who thought it looked like a turtle.” Tony crouches down next to Steve, and points to it. “They have a similar structure, where their backbone is melded into their shell. However, tortonias aren’t reptiles. They have something similar to mammary glands on their underbelly, which puts them closer to the Earth mammalian classification. It’s not perfect, but I doubt you want me to get more into exo-zoology classifications. Anyway, they can’t be taken as pets, as Mr. Coveney found out, because they feed on a very specific airborne molecule, found only in this atmosphere.”
Steve hides out for most of Rhodey’s visit. It’s late – almost 1AM, when Rhodey skips out, and Tony finds himself alone in his workshop once again.
Steve crouches down and peers at the small blue creature, and Tony senses nothing but fascination.
When he finally sits up, he is greeted by a polite, “Good morning, Mr. Rogers.”
“You can poke it,” Tony says, amused.
He spits it back into the cup. “This tastes like motor oil.”
Tony just says, “I was just curious.”
Tony says it in a tone that is somehow both cocky and yearning for approval. Steve’s starting to realize Tony doesn’t really have a neutral tone. Everything, every sentence, no matter how mundane, is intensified to an emotional level Steve only hits when well and truly on his way to an episode.
“Well, thank you. I appreciate it.”
“What?”
And that’s that.
Tony doesn’t know if it just the hyper-fixation he has on him, but Steve's just – he's interesting to try to figure out. That's always been a problem for Tony - computers have a right answer, people don't. But here's the thing - people
Steve stuffs the unpleasantness of that thought down, down, down. It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter at all.
He had a dream last night, a vision, of him arriving back to the camp and surprising Peggy. She’d run into his arms, un-poised like she never was, and he’d catch her. They’d kiss – and the vision morphs into their wedding, the white lace beautiful on her head. Then a house, a couple bedrooms. A small daughter, yellow hair. A dog. A birthday party for their son, where Steve kisses Peggy on the temple. A steady, day job.
“Sure?” Steve repeats dubiously. “Are you—”
“Yeah, she knows,” Tony agrees. “But what else are we going to do?”
Getting back to a routine is awkward, and the third time Steve cuts himself off when trying to make conversation, Tony just decides to hell with it and puts on Halo.
Day twenty-one, Steve learns how to fix a vacuum cleaner, and Tony shows him how to break it until it’s way more awesome.
“Anyway, so I am sitting up on my perch on a rock, right, and Steve’s holding Maras’s hand, right, and looking down at these twenty some soldiers who are now surrounding him, and Natasha is too far to really get involved but at least
She also sends Rhodey to check on him, which is just fucking rude. Why does no one
He heads straight to the kitchen, which isn’t abnormal, given the lab time. But Steve looks over his shoulder on reflex, glancing at Tony digging in the fridge - and it’s just obvious there’s something wrong. The way he’s holding himself, it just doesn’t look right.
“I’m sorry I missed her.”
“Okay,” Natasha nods. “Okay.”
“I can take you back as far as Project Rebirth. Not before.”
“Whatever you want. You could do anything. Men’s modeling would love to have you. Join SHIELD. Learn yoga. Buy a kitten. It doesn’t matter. You just need to do something. What do you do for fun?”
“You don’t have to say anything. Look, Tony, there’s some things I want to say to

though.” Tony’s getting sick of Coulson’s looks. “What? Like anyone could decode that stupid-ass acronym? You like being mysterious so no one looks into your shit.”
This is his first battle since WWII, and he’s frozen.
Tony’s next to him, shooting and blasting, and mechanized parts keep raining down over him. He’s getting scraped and bruised and he hasn’t felt this type of focused adrenaline since shooting at someone with a swastika armband.
(Ever since, he had taken to pulling a resume out of a pile at random.)
“Yes, Pepper,” he says, and he hopes it’s patient. “I will let you know if I change my mind.”
“You’re not going to let me die in peace, are you?”
“Tony, what did I say about you talking?” Coulson says, pleasant but tight.
“The Jericho.”
“Sharon,” he greets warmly.
“You need to stop living in the past. I’m a futurist, and there’s nothing that’s going to come out of you just treading water. Sink or swim. And I am
Have you maybe not noticed that I’ve been trying to keep this whole ‘slowly dying’ thing a little bit on the DL? Do you just get kicks out of betraying people’s trust or—”
Steve gives a nod to Tony, who aims his repulsor at the door lock, and Steve vaguely hopes he can keep this to a simple assault and not 1
He considers briefly flying Steve home with the armor, but quickly dismisses it. He’s never flown anyone before, and with his luck, he’d drop him. Steve Rogers: survives Nazis, scientific experimentation, and being frozen for 70 years, is killed by Tony Stark having a poor grip.
On the emotional side, he’s so goddamn lonely that he spent two hours lying in bed, feeling his heart beat, and the black hole inside his head start to expand and quake. He gets up to find Roomba, who was sleeping on the couch, and he couldn't quite bring himself to wake her, so he had headed to the kitchen, hoping to wait her out. Cats are awake at night, right?
People have never been Steve’s forte even when he’s in his best environment. Back in Brooklyn, he can remember school boys beating him up in alleys and girls ignoring him as he tries to get their attention during dates. In bootcamp, he can remember boys hazing him and spitting at him when he couldn’t keep up. When he was Captain America, he never knew how to handle women’s attention properly – wanted or not. He wasn’t even particularly good at relating to the men he lead, once he became a
And Tony suddenly feels like he missed the last step when walking down stairs.
Steve ignores this.
Tony smiles. He squeezes Steve’s hand once, then drops them. “How about this? You ask me in two months. Two months, on the day. And I’ll say yes. If I'm here to say yes, I'll say yes.”
“I just told her we were going to get her home,” Steve says.
And there’s Steve, strutting through the hole in the wall with an expression on his face like he has only murder on his mind.
Tony slides across the bench, gently bumping into Steve’s shoulder, who glances at him in warm surprise.
“It’s not that it’s overwhelming!” Steve snaps, interrupting. He tries to imagine Tony as anyone else. Commander Phillips from bootcamp. Anyone else, anyone who he doesn’t care about anymore. “It’s that I don’t see the point.”
Instead of answering, Tony kneels down in the sand. He takes the little pieces of metal that he was forming in his fingers on the way back, and continues to bend and shape. Within a few moments, he has a shapeable prosthetic leg.
His father’s body was already gone, disappeared, completely absent from his life, not unlike his father’s body when it was still alive and pumping green blood. And there was his mother’s headstone, permanent, etched, constantly there for Tony to remember, a constant reminder of dark nights of comfort, of being held, of being allowed to shed tears, of being encouraged to laugh, of playing with toys instead of experiments, of feeling love and feeling someone else’s love, of
“Why are they attacking at the roof?” Tony asks. He spins, a beam of light going straight through another. “What is their aim? Why not target the workshop?”
The shuttle hums to life.
with his time before Steve?
Fury’s gaze is assessing, wondering.
Tony shuts off his tablet. “It does, doesn’t it.”
Tony considers lying.
Steve’s awkwardly holding a bouquet of flowers, red and yellow dahlias, in front of his chest.
“Look,” Tony says, and leans over Steve. He systematically presses all the buttons. The window goes down. The window goes up. The door unlocks. The door relocks. The seat heater is turned on. The seat heater is turned off. “Play with them. You’re not going to hurt anything. And even if you do, I’ll just replace it.”
“Steve?” Tony bumps his shoulder with his, and Steve looks up, slightly startled.
Tony fights the urge to squirm. His red and gold uniform feels scratchy today, and he finds himself pulling at the collar, letting the debrief wash over him.
Tony takes his time down the steps. Finally, with a calming breath, he side-eyes the corner, where Steve is still standing, stock still.
“Okay, point being – Captain oh Captain here just
He leans down and pries the shield out of the ice, glad for the suit’s superhuman strength, because there’s no way he could have brute-forced that thing out any other way.
An hour, two whiteboards, seven equations, four google searches, and a spilled coffee later, they’ve determined that you cannot, in fact, die by being hit by a flower or a penny at terminal velocity unless you’re very unlucky, and Tony has officially forgotten what Steve came in here about in the first place.
There’s something about that smile that really makes Steve think he’s in the latter category. He remembers all those articles he read about Tony’s challenges with alcohol, and suddenly, he feels a spike of concern, of wanting to change days that are already past that hits him stronger than anything has in a long while.
Quiet, total quiet, as they each come to their own realization of what exactly Tony is driving at. Then, Steve, “No, Tony, don’t you dare. Don’t you dare.”
“Does that feel real? Does it?” He pokes him harder.
“Oh, I don’t know, JARVIS,” he says. He clenches his hand into a fist, and it doesn’t shake anymore. “Just call it ‘The Inevitable.’”
“Tony!” Steve yells, scandalized. “I meant toss them in the
People are screaming from down on the street, glass is shattering, and all Steve can do is stare at the armor – at Tony – and feel helpless.

century – they’ll still be laws, and they’ll still be bureaucracy, and they’ll still be rules to follow.” He holds Tony’s eye through gritted breath. “But I will never put rules or organization above my morals. That may make me a bad Captain – so be it.”
And when the punching bag goes across the room, he gets another.
“Yes,” Steve says. “
is what Tony was being told.
Steve goes slightly still, but his eyes – God, his eyes, what is this, why is Tony so fixated on them – his eyes roam the room, as if trying to find something to confirm it. Or disprove it.
“The word of America,” Tony agrees.
“Just – it’s not a good idea to get close to me. And I don’t mean that in the bullshit way people say that when they’re trying to sound cool, I actually mean that it’s a genuinely bad idea. In about a year, I’m…”
“They created the reactor
When gains control and looks up – 3.4 seconds later – he comes to the realization that the pain, the pulse, was Steve’s emotions leaking through the bond.
It’s Steve who drops the gaze first, turning his head to look around the empty rec room. He breathes out, slow but heavy, and Tony can hear the exhaustion. “Well,” Steve starts. He raps his fingers up against the chair he’s sitting on, unrhythmic and nervous. “I suppose this is probably not an appropriate conversation to be having with a subordinate.” He smiles wanly. “Back way when, we were all close in arms, brothers. It wasn’t controlled like Starfleet. I guess I got to get used to how Starfleet runs things.”
Tony Stark – as an officer,
It wasn’t easy to convince Coulson that he should be in the room. Coulson made a probably valid point about how Tony might be a
“It doesn’t have to be your last months!” Steve’s voice raises for the first time. Tony’s never seen him with this type of anger. Not wanting a beat down, but just - angry. Just angry. His words get clearer, more pointed.
“She’s awfully—” Steve doesn’t want to say this wrong. “Self-focused,” he ends up choosing. “It’s not that she’s not a team player, but—”
“Tony, this doesn’t seem like you—”
They both turn back to Steve, who seems to be outright staring at only Tony now. Tony doesn’t blame him as he is obviously the most interesting thing in this room.
“I see,” Tony says.
Tony raises his head from where it was buried in an engineering manual – he only had so much long-term memory, it was pointless to fill it with information that could easily be accessed from a PADD – to see Captain Rogers standing in front of him, a tray of terran food in his hand, and a small grimace on his face.
“Or, whatever ship is most important.” Fury looks taken aback. “You know, I know, worlds know that there isn’t a better engineer in the galaxy.” Untrue, but Fury has never met Shuri of Wakanda, weeks away by warp 8, and Tony has no inclination to enlighten him. “Put me where it’s mission critical that the engines don’t fail. I’ll deliver.”
“Most Vulcan thing about me, baby,” he eventually quips, untrue as that may be.
It’s noon by the time the animals arrive. JARVIS was polite enough to warn the security desk, God bless his binary soul, but they all come up via-elevator.
“Experimenting with—I’m doing
“Well,” Tony says. He makes a hand motion, and the screen goes off. “Enough about me. You can find more out about me on the Internet, if you want. Believe about 33% of it. That’s a good rule of thumb for the whole Internet, actually. Wait, has anyone shown you the Internet, yet?”
Tony looks up – hope is there, clearly, but something else too – maybe defiance.
“Meow,” he says.
Steve doesn’t really remember his reply, something rude that was akin too, “Stop looking up shit from my time period to make me feel normal.”
He catches Doom within an hour, and these new magnetic cuffs are
“What?” Steve says, then shakes his head. “Wait, what?”
“Shoe and the foot are the same size, Rogers.”
"—Because we've lived together for ages, and I'm a SHIELD agent now."
“I wanted to make you one, but didn’t know for sure what you like, nor for sure how to cook one. So I tried.”
He locks Steve out of the workshop.
Tony looks over to Steve, going to make some comment about why super-soldier reflexes didn’t translate to video games, when he finds Steve already staring at him.
He was vaguely aware that there are a lot of ducks to get into rows when people died, and that’s for
Steve looks around the room, taking everything in with rapid eye movements, quietly assessing, and Tony wonders what he’s realizing.
So he accepts the call.
One of the antennae on the alien twitches, noticeably. “Yes?”
Steve comes back at 5PM.
“I do not know.” T’Prau spun on her heel and moved away – only 3.23 meters, but far enough to isolate Tony. He knew it, she knew it.
“You really think they have more motivation to save my life than
Tony looks up at Steve, at the face that’s haunted his dreams since that first handshake. The blonde hair, the soft blue eyes, the slightly melancholy turn to his expression that never seems to fully leave. Like a phaser, all the little pieces that fit to make something greater than the sum of its parts.
When the meeting is finally called to an end, most of what Tony took away was that he hadn’t been asked to join the mission planet-side. His orders were to personally oversee the cloaking device, as well as keep engineering on yellow-alert the entire day, waiting for a signal to jump to Warp 10 at a moment’s notice.
