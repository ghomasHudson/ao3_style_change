“Surprise?”
I am a good person. Right?
I only want you.
“Well… you see after 72 hours of no sleep and trying to be creative and nothing happening, and I got hungry, so I order pizza from this place and they said they had no delivery people, but the owner was so nice he said he would bring it himself.”
“All I can remember are faces and targets. My memories are of a weapon given commands and lists of targets and names to take out. I didn’t know who they were. I swear.But it was still me.” Bucky looked so ashamed and hurt and remorseful. Tony’s heart was breaking a little for him.
I tried to have less hold on you.
I am utterly confused.
I must let go and let you finally….
How could you and him do this to me.
“Well, see as we were running, I stop to get a shiny ring which I think will look good on you by the way and give me a break I was scared and sorta might have talked an army general into lending me a plane and now we are here.  So, count me as a fugitive too.”
“Stank? Didn’t you shower? Do I need to set Dummy on you again?”
Trying not to cry, trying to be strong is taking everything I have.
Steve couldn’t believe what was going on.
“Explain technically.”
I tried to be supportive.
Steve waited patiently for what was only minutes but felt like eternity for Tony to explain the last part of his sentence that he rushed out.
I am all alone and thinking of us.
“I rather take jail, she will kill me.”
My heart feels used.
Why is it unfair?
I tried to understand.
My feelings were the only one to blame.
But I am all alone.
I know I am supposed to cast a side everything and say the final word.
I am so torn and stuck.
But my line has ended.
All there is now is hate for myself.
“You remember them. And yet why do you look like you don’t remember them?” There was anger and sadness in his voice. He has wanted answers regarding his parents’ death for years and now the only person to answer them wasn’t entire responsible for the accident.
Nothing could stop the pain.
Now I know the pain.
This is what it does.
“You know I love you very much right? But sometimes do you know how much I want to strangle you?”
If it was me, why didn’t you ask me to change?
“Surprisingly I got what you said. But, again slowly, spell it out for me, where are you?”
There is nothing I won’t do for those I love.
Idling away wishing you will be here.
“Tony, how long have you had the phone?”
“Wanda?”
“Dr. Stark, if you are both done, might I suggest we get on with the next part of the plan. We don’t want the general to catch on to us.” T’Challa spoke up while handcuffing Zemo.
“Shhh…let me finish. So, this guy came and so I saw him from the security feed and he looked so old and tired and being the nice person, I was, I invited him up. And do you know how surprised I was? The old dude is the same one who brought the letter and the phone and called me Tony Stank.”
“What did you do now?” The avengers who were doing such a poor job of pretending not to eavesdrop got up and now came to stand by him.
Now I get it, his line never ended.
Because in the end, you picked him.
“Nope. You think I would be alive if he was here with me? I am terrified of Natasha but Rhodey, yeah scarier. No, honey bear is at therapy.”
“I can try to talk myself out but, she scares me. I feel if I move her spear will take my head off.”
The word goodbye? What does it actually stands for?
I simply asked that you be honest with me.
With just a snap, it disintegrated.
It makes it worse knowing that saying the word will seal it shut.
“Just one question master genius, come and get you? Sometimes I wonder what go through that brain of yours. Fugitive here. And there is this thing called distance and miles and miles of it.”
When the video showing the murder of his parents started playing, Tony even though he told himself he was ready, because let’s face it, any villain they have ever faced always has a backup plan ready, so he tried so hard to not show any emotions. Still, tears came like water work. He told himself he had it under control, then came the voice that made him want to turn into a little boy and hide within the comfort that it offers. The voice that always calms him down and so filled with fondness and love. Steve’s voice.
Tony melted into the hug and snuggled closer into Steve’s chest. He looked at Bucky and into Steve’s eyes. He understood what he needed to do at that moment. He doesn’t want to lose his family but he doesn’t want to also deny himself the right to mourn and be mad.
Captain America sat lounging in King T’challa’s garden with rest of the avengers enjoying rather a very peaceful afternoon. Everything was going well. The team and Tony talked and made up. He was thankful he didn’t lose Tony after all the fighting. Most importantly he was very thankful Tony forgave him and offered his help in restoring Bucky’s mental state. Looking at his teammates, he could tell how much they all missed their friend, even Wanda who at first never liked Tony. But, no one could beat him at how much he missed Tony. He just wants to hold his boyfriend and forget about everything.
Can you imagine how easy a heart can be broken?
“You are right. Saying sorry doesn’t solve anything but it is a progress.” Tony knew things won’t go back to how they were in the beginning but it was a start.
“Like seriously, how many jobs does he have? I swear I saw him driving a school bus once too. I gotta tell you thou, he is hilarious. Might be secretly a spy you know.”
“Are you in jail?”
“Wait..Steve you knew. And stop saying it wasn’t me. Those are my hands that pulled the trigger. Those are my hands that ended the lives of our friends and the only family we had left. Don’t deny that.” Bucky had crumbled into himself and moved to the furthest side of the bunker.
Just to be near you again.
At first, he would discreetly look at his phone waiting for a text or call from Tony since he mailed the letter and other phone to him. Nothing ever came. Now though, his teammates know about the phone and he doesn’t even hide checking anymore. He was almost giving up that he will never get a call.  It came to the point he doesn’t care what kind of situation, he just needed Tony to call him.
“Yes, my love?”
But that’s where I went wrong.
Even though I wish that you were closer and near to me.
"Aren't you going to show me your bed chamber, my young prince?" Tony asked, lifting his right eyebrow.
"I'm sorry I made you guys worried. I'll be more careful." Steve frowned.
Tony hated avoiding Steve, but he can't help it. Maybe this was the only way for Steve to give up on him or even hate him. He knew this was going hurt Steve, as well as him. After all they say 'time will heal everything'.
Steve desperately hoped the man was in the bathroom doing a shower, but the bathroom was empty. There was no sign of the man, he was gone.
"-I'm Antonio and yes I'm half Italian." Tony cringed at his choice of words. Talk about awkwardness, he literally just blurted out everything he was thinking. Especially in front of a really hot guy.
Steve couldn't help but thought how familiar that man looked to him. At that exact moment, the man's name appeared on the big screen. His eyes widened. "Anthony Edward Stark AKA Tony Stark" Steve read out loud.
He wiped the blood off his hand. "I'm sorry but this is gonna sting a little, actually No. The wound is very deep, so it's gonna hurt a lot" Tony gave him a warning.
Tony went behind Bucky, putting his arms around his torso. He held Bucky tight, paddling his feet hard, trying his best to drag him up. Bucky's body weighed them down. For a second Tony thought they'd drowned. But, Tony refused to give up, he pushed his limits.
He wondered how it would sound when the man were to moan his name out loud. The thought about it made Steve excited. Not that it helped,  when the man started teasing him by rubbing his ass against his crotch back and forth.
Tony gave a slight nod to his dad. He looked at Steve. "If you're free, you're more then welcome to join us, Steve." Tony said with a smile.
"I've missed you too, Tony" Rhodey replied. Tony had met James Rhodes, but he's known as Rhodey at the M.I.T when he was fifteen. Since then they'd been best friends. It's been thirteen years already and it felt like he's known Rhodey for a lifetime.
Something was definitely odd, Steve could feel something so soft against his lips. He was scared to open his eyes. Slowly, he took a peak, that's when he met with those beautiful hazel eyes. Oh, yeah he had stumbled over and had fallen on top Tony. Why was it that his lips felt warm and soft? Oh God! Could it be that, it was Tony's lips.
Vroom! They rode off.
Today was the day, that Tony had to leave. His parents had already arrived to pick him up. Everyone was in the courtyard, whilst Steve was on the rooftop, watching them laugh, clearly they were having a great time.
"I'm sorry..." a familiar voice spoke out of nowhere. Steve looked up and saw a man, who had a beautiful face, with a sharp jaw and angular cheekbones. And those perfectly trimmed beard. The complexion of his skin goes well with his beautiful brown hazel eyes. The man was a clear definition of beauty.
However, the moment Steve came crashing down onto the rooftop floor, Tony had lost his balance and had fallen off the rooftop instead.
As far as Tony could tell, the person he just slept with was indeed his enemy. But, he only slept with Steve because he owed him and he had to pay back, even if it had meant he had to use his body, he'd do it.
Tony smiled at the boy and whispered "You're welcome, little one." He walked out of room and went to his car.
Bucky suddenly chuckled. "Stark, I didn't expect you to make a ship name for us this quick, actually I didn't expect you to even care about something like that. But I really do love this side of you, Stark" Bucky stated with a smug.
"Shit, Pep he's burning up, we need to take him to the hospital." Tony panicked, as he took him in his arms and carried him to his car.
Tony was indeed a genius, but it when came to something as confusing as this, his brain immediately gives up.
But, the thought of Antonio not being right by his side killed him. He barely even knew the man, after all they've just met 7 hours ago and yet Steve was completely drawn to him.
"I-I'm sorry" Tony whimpered softly.
"Not that I blame you, after all Stark is an attractive guy, even straight guys fall for him" Bucky replied with a smirk. He stood up and walked near Steve.
The man wore a yellow tinted sunglasses. Steve immediately knew who it was; Tony Stark.
"Leave me alone!" Tony said, his tone sounded like a child demanding something; it was adorable.
Steve looked at Tony. "I'm surprised you even remembered my name, Stark."
His heart pounded, like it wanted to escape from his chest. Steve refused to look away from Tony, even for split second. He wanted to see the real Tony.
Tony stopped walking and turned his body toward Steve, they were 3 meters away.
"Hey punk, I had no idea what u just said." Bucky replied
Howard choked on air, "Anthony!"
! He was going to fall.
Bucky and Natasha were in a cruise ship, they had an secret mission there.
Howard patted Tony's shoulder. "I'm proud of you, son." He praised Tony.
"Thank you, Stark. I really appreciate your compliments, it means a lot." Steve replied, while getting on the motorcycle.
"I'm sorry" He softly whispered into her ear. "I'm so sorry Pepper, I didn't mean to scare you like that." He repeatedly apologized to Pepper.
Suddenly the car behind beeped. It startled Steve. “Dude, get inside" Clint shouted.
Tony's arms were on the man's neck, whilst the man's hand were on Tony's waist. Tony and the man were making out in public.
Tony was already gasping, his inside felt like it was being teared open. "Ah! Keep going, don't stop." He moaned, as Steve thrust into him deeper and deeper. The agony and pleasure was taking over Tony.
Steve couldn't even begin to understand why he kept having these weird feelings, but he knew who was responsible for it. Obviously, it was Tony Stark and always would be.
However, when he entered this hospital he felt completely the opposite, he felt a warm sensation. He felt safe.
Joseph was afraid this was going to happen, but Tony was not to be blamed for. "What! Why? After all you guys been through? What did Anthony say?" Joseph asked, he needed understand the situation first, then maybe he could comfort his little boy.
Tony knew who Steve actually really was from the beginning, after all yesterday wasn't their first encounter. They've met exactly 6 months ago.
Pepper and Rhodey both giggled. "It's 'cause we deeply care about you, lil Tony." Rhodey replied.
"Hmm! Pepper and Tony..." Bucky muttered. He was actually in deep thought and then his mind clicked.
"Urg! Fine, spilt it!" Tony finally gave up, he came help it, he too curious.
Steve still couldn't figure out why he had kissed the life force out of Tony Stark in the first place. But he didn't regret kissing him, in fact he wanted to taste those lips even more, again and again.
"Hey, Bucky, I've been meaning to ask this, I know it's gonna sound really straightforward but..." Tony said, as he put a straw in his mouth and took a long sip of his drink.
Bucky placed a hand on Steve's shoulder.
"-you're not alone, I'm here. You're safe with me, it's alright." The man reassured him with a sweet gentle smile. His words were very comforting, Steve felt relieved.
"J.A.R.V.I.S what time is it?" He asked while slowly lifting his head off the pillow. But the AI didn't reply. It was as if Tony was talking to himself.
He wanted to escape from the castle for a while. No one knew how the prince of Americ Kingdom looked in person, there seemed be a secret behind that; even Steve wasn't aware of it. They'd only seen him when he was a child. Steve headed out to the city with his red Ferrari, without having to worry about his identity.
"Oh Hey, Bucky. Yeah, actually I am. It's a really interesting story." Steve quickly bookmarked the page, he closee the book and placed it on the nightstand. "What's wrong, Bucky?"
"Steve! What are you doing here?" She asked in surprised.
"Pepperony." Tony replied at the same time as Bucky.
His heart felt empty, like a black hole that was getting bigger each day. Tony couldn't keep these feelings inside anymore, he needed to share it with someone.
Tony smiled at him and kissed him on the cheek. "I love you too."
Steve let out a loud laughter, he couldn't stop laughing. He knew Tony was trying make him feel better and it worked. "You what! You blew up a science lab!"
Tony blankly stared at her. "Ah sorry, you were saying?"
His hair brushed back and forth, in synced with the tender night breeze. The icy blueness to his eyes, reflected emotions that were deeply frozen.
"It's pretty much healed" Steve replied, showing his hand just in case.
Even though, it killed him when she broke up with him. But, now he finally understood that Pepper's decision were indeed the best for them.
They both looked at Tony, eyes widened, jaws dropped to the floor; they were dumbfounded by Tony.
The man looked down for a moment, pouring himself a drink and bringing the alcohol to his soft lips.
Tony itched the back of his head. "Yeah, about that. So much things were going on and I completely forgot, I'm surprised I even managed to ask for his name. Anyway, why would I even want his number? So what if I just to be his friend, he might not want me as a friend. I mean who'd want Tony Stark, a narcissist as a friend? " Tony said.
Steve was a called a freak and a monster. Those names had left a deep scar in him, soon Steve began to stop going to school.
"Captain, finally had the chance to meet you, Nat told me so much about you" Tony greeted with a smile and shook Steve's hand.
Tony had a weak smile, slowly lowering the video camera down. "Me too, but I've got school and million of others projects I need to finish. Don't worry, I'll come and visit you once in a while."
Steve sighed out in relief, the man's attention seemed to be elsewhere, that's why he hadn't caught sight of Steve at all. Even though, he had hid in the most obvious place.
"Mika's Cafè" Tony told him of the place they're going to. Steve nodded and started his bike. Tony tightened his grip around Steve.
"My son is growing up too quick. Urg! I'm getting emotional." Howard pretended to sob.
Steve hated hospital setting, ever since he was a child, it always made him feel noxious.
Steve gripped his shoulders. His hands were shaking. "Tony, tell me you're joking?" It had to be, Tony must've be playing a prank on him.
Every day he would pray for Steve to remember Tony, so they could reunite. Only then he would be able to see his son truly happy once again.
"How is it going Ana? What happened to Jarvis, is he alright...I see. Tell him to rest and get well soon. Take care Ana." With that Howard ended the call.
He wanted to fall in love, he wanted to treasure his special someone and make them his.
"Anthony, young man. You truly are incredible and talented." The king complimented Tony.
The thunder cried out from the blackened sky, the clouds were invisible high above. It was followed by millions of raindrops pouring down into the earth. The wind was howling; it was getting stronger by the seconds.
"Well, it sure felt like it." Steve rolled his eyes.
Tony looked at Bucky. He let out his hand in front of Bucky, waiting for an hand shake. "You must be James Barnes!" He said. Bucky took his hand and shook it.
Howard let out a chuckle. Steve was at edge of bursting into laughter. Somehow, he held it in. It's hasn't even been 5 minutes and Tony was already making him laugh without even trying.
"Urm, Tony. Sweetheart, you actually do and Steve's the real proof." Pepper said.
Steve missed Tony every seconds, he fought the urge to meet him. Steve had to wait for the right time, after all he had many plans for Tony.
No, Tony! Don't you dare to say that about yourself, you deserve happiness. You are the most-
Tony carefully looked at Steve’s hand and sighed in relief. “That’s good to hear-" Tony moved a few steps back, when suddenly he tripped over his own feet.
Steve remained there frozen, His eyes were on Tony and only at him.
"Well I guess you were lucky that he was drunk." Clint stated.
Tony shut his eyes closed and waited for his body to hit the floor. He couldn't feel any pain.
He parked his car in a safe place and took his off his seatbelt and got out of the car.
Tony sat beside a man who laid unconscious on the bed, he grabbed hold of the man's hand.
Steve felt his face heat up, God! He knew he was blushing, as he imagined doing it with Tony. Steve never felt this way about anyone, other then Tony.
That’s when it hit him, Steve was in fact madly in love with Tony Stark. That explains why, most of the times his heart beats like crazy, that was because Steve constantly thought of Tony. How could Steve had been this stupid? It was obvious that he was in love with Stark, why else would he even think about Tony 24/7? Even an kid would be able to tell that Steve's in love with Tony.
"Only if you tell us more about him, c'mon feed our curiosity." Pepper asked.
The guy gently cupped Steve's face, deepening the kiss even more.
3 Months later》
Tony realized what just happened. His dear old dad, took his car and left him alone with Steve.
Steve didn't budge an inch. He was way too strong for Tony. His hand still remained on his waist. "Why, why are you doing this to me, Tony?" He asked, his voice sounded so broken. "I thought you loved me?" He whispered.
"You don't have to be shy, Tony. At least now we know Steve's really good looking. Obviously you'd get distracted. Don't worry, Tony we understand." Rhodey encouraged Tony.
Steve didn't expect that at all, you can't blame him for losing focus. He completely lost his balance. He tripped over his feet fell on Tony. Both of them fell crashing down into the floor.
"So Rogers, how did you get hurt?" Tony asked.
Sarah stroked his hair, gently. "Good morning, sweetheart. I'm so happy you’re okay, I'm so sorry, I should've known you were sick." Sarah said softly, she leaned and kissed his cheek.
Or maybe it makes it worse because I am still stuck in denial over everything.
“No, he will make fun of me.”
But you couldn’t do that.
To be able to hear that laughter again.
Why wasn’t me that you picked?
Or does it makes the memories of you stop playing?
I am honest and have always been with you.
Steve froze.
“Oh, God.” Steve only hoped Tony hasn’t pissed off the Dora Milage.
“Tony….Hello..Hi..Tony” Steve turned away from his snickering teammates.
“Yeah, absolutely. I mean if I were to even move the hair on my chin, I feel like these ladies will end me.”
Did I maybe ask too much of you?
“Okay, Tony, sit tight. I will see if I can get in touch with Miss Potts and Rhodes to get you help. It will take me a while and forever to get to you.”
Did you not find it hard to cast  me aside?
I must let go and say goodbye,
You are with him thinking about the future.
“72 hours?!!!!”
“Okay, let me tell you what really happened. I got really hungry right and you know me and cooking don’t get along and then I got this idea, which pretty much was epic, hello, genius and master here. So, I was like why not order pizza from this place I heard much about, right? I called and blah blah order this blah blah toppings this and delivery that. So pizza guy came and he was like hey, its you Stank and I thought he was saying I stink but then it turned out he was the mailman and then I asked him how many jobs he has and we started talking and I invited him into the house and then he told me about a coffee shop he owns. We got there then I realize I forgot my wallet at home and since I was in disguise, I couldn’t prove I am Tony Stark. And the old man keeps saying I am Tony Stank. Cops came, I stole a car, we ran and yeah in big trouble now.”
“Technically I am not in jail anymore. But I do need you.”
“Bucky, listen I know that you would want to repay me back, but it’s not by handing yourself over to those with hidden motive. Go with T’Challa and I promise I will keep my word and help then you can make it up to me and others afterwards.” To Tony, he believes holding in anger doesn’t help anyone at all.
“Of course, you will give it back. My life with you will never get boring.”
Does it make the tears go away?
My whole being and heart.
I simply asked that you put me first.
“No, it wasn’t entirely you. It was hydra. I have come to accept that. You are still responsible even though honestly you were not in control, it was still you. And sergeant, accepting and not running, thanks.” It wasn’t closure but, it was closer to it.
You said you loved me. And will always do.
“Yes, Tony I do.”
You will never be here.
“Oh, good, for a bit there…wait? Wakanda?!” Steve yelled so loud he made rest of his teammates jumped as well.
Why didn’t you stick with that?
“I am wrong and sorry for my ignorance. I am sorry that I thought I knew better and doubted you. I should have said something as soon as I found out. I was just so scared. I was scared to lose part of my past and part of my present and future. That doesn’t excuse what I did. It will never. I am not asking you to forgive me right away, all I am asking right now is to let me say how truly I am sorry.” Steve tried to not cry, but he still did.
Steve didn’t look convinced. “Look Steve,” Tony said with his hands up in a defensive manner, “I’m going to invite all of Avengers, I just started with you because of proximity purposes. I really think this will do a lot of morale. I think it’s important for us to be a team.” Tony tried to sound honest and wholesome. It wasn’t something he tried often, because wholesome was not a good look for him. Tony was really just banking on Steve being big on teamwork.
Don’t panic Tony. Don’t panic. So, he had his team leader’s thoughts in his head. It wasn’t that big of a deal. No problem. Weirder stuff happened all the time. It came with being an Avenger.
“Are you here to talk about what just happened?” Steve asked, his posture becoming more rigid. It was clear Steve was bracing himself for a fight, or at least an argument.
Steve didn’t have any other commitments, so him and Tony started to hang out more and more. It also didn’t hurt that they were the only ones up at certain hours. Steve because he liked running early, and Tony because he hadn’t slept yet.
As he brushed his teeth and got dressed, Tony was hit with all kinds of feelings and thoughts. It was clear that Steve was on a run. Tony could feel the slap of shoes against the pavement. The feeling of pairs of eyes on his back, pretending that they weren’t looking. He smelled pumpkin muffins being made in the bakery down the block. Tony’s senses were so overwhelmed he didn’t even notice that he was sitting on his bed dumbly with one sock and one off.
Tony would like to say that him and Steve became friends after sitting down and talking about the whole Loki/the world was ending thing like adults. But that would be a lie, because Tony can’t think of a time he’s ever willingly acted like an adult or a time when he was mature and talked about his feelings.
Okay guys, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry that technically this chapter is late. And it's a bit short. The holidays have me a bit scattered. But I'm hoping to have another chapter up pretty soon. And I'm sorry that there hasn't been a lot to Tony and Steve's relationship yet, but when I said slow burn I meant slow burn. So, let me know what you guys think and if you liked it. Your kudos and comments feed my soul.
What really happened was Fury decided that in order for the Avengers to be a team they actually had to be in the same room together and train together. Which theoretically was a good idea. Maria Hill sent them all an email about two months after Loki was taken back to Asgard and told them that they were all to report to shield headquarters bright and early Monday to have a group training session. She phrased it like a request, but Tony took it for what it was: a demand.
"This brings back old memories." Tony stated, while smiling brightly at Pepper.
"So Nickie, now that I'm here let's start the meeting, shall we." Tony sat on the opposite side of table, far away from the others. He took a sip of the hot coffee in front of him, like it was the most delicious thing he'd ever had.
"It's fine. Hey kid, why do you look so pale? Are you alright?" The young guy asked with an anxious look on his face.
Steve nodded.
Steve pressed the elevator button amd waited for it. "It's good to see you, Captain." The British A.I said.
Steve could never, not even for a second thought about going out with anyone, other then his Tony.
Pepper was waiting for Tony in the reception, "Tony, is the kid okay?" She asked with a frown on her face.
"Pft! Yeah, it was when we first met" Pepper replied.
Thankfully, the private royal doctor was among them, he was already there to begin with; earlier, he had came to do a health check on the king.
"Oh sweetie, I'm not a monster. You did save me and I really appreciate that. Thank you, my knight in shining armour. But I seriously hate being owed by anyone." He said and smashed his lips on Steve's, taking away his breath. This time the kiss was intense. Steve kissed back, licking the man's bottom lips and sucking them hard. He slowly released the grip on Steve's wrists.
Tony thought, as a deep sigh passed through his parted lips.
However, Steve's body gave up and he lost consciousness. The last thing Steve saw was that guy's face. The guy who saved him.
After five long years, Steve arrived to his family mansion. He had always spoken to his parents over the phone, since then.
Steve saw the terror on Tony's face, he stepped back and suddenly there was nothing, he was standing in air. In a blink of an eye, his body dropped down.
"If you leave now, we probably won't see you for another decade. Our sons just became friends, we should give them more time to play withe each other." Steve's father looked at Steve and smiled.
So what if Steve's the mafia boss, it's not like they're gang are are involved in anything that's illegal. They're gang are like a family, always helping out people.
"You actually do! You have man crush on me." Tony gasped in surprise, earlier he was just teasing Steve, but didn't realize it was the truth. "Fuck! I didn't realize I'd have someone as hot as you as my fan."
Tony hugged him back.
Tony crashed his head back to his pillow, he felt light headed, like the world was being swept away from him.
Howard shook his hand, with a smile. "So Rogers, do want to join us?" Howard asked.
The sudden knock on the door made him lose focus from the painting into the reality. "Come in." He called out, not worrying about the fact that it might seem a little too weird having countless of painting of Tony Stark in his room.
After a few minutes, the man slowly tried moving his body away from Steve, but he didn't move his arms around the man's waist. Instead, of letting go, Steve secured his grip and pulled the man closer.
Tony thought it would be if the butler were to record it whilst the two of them danced.
"Steve" Tony said.
Tony couldn't help but enjoy teasing her, Natasha's reaction was absolutely hilarious and it was kinda of cute. Tony was extremely happy for Natasha and Bucky.
"That’s the one and only 'Tony Stark', the CEO of Stark Industries and his only 10 years older than us. This guy is literally a genius, he attended MIT at the age of 15. " Bucky answered proudly.
"You know the combination Bucky and Natasha make Uckysha or Natucky. But, I prefer Uckysha." Tony replied with a huge smirk.
Soon, he couldn't bear the pain. His eyes began to close. That was it, he was going to die. Steve was daunted at the thought of that.
Steve's tears streamed down his cheeks. He had never once cried like this before. The gulits were drowning Steve, he felt suffocated. "What have I done, Tony hates me now." Steve muttered to himself. He couldn't even process what just happened. One moment everything was going perfectly, the next moment this happened. Life was full of shits, you can never expect when something might occur and change the whole fucking situation in a blink of an eye.
His head was on Tony's lap, he felt so warm and comfy. When was the last time Steve ever lay on someone's lap, well that was a really long time ago. He began to feel drowsy, his eyes were slowly shutting closed.
Steve was startled by the sudden touch on his shoulder. He turned around and saw his mom.
Steve felt euphoric, it was the first someone had asked him about his wellbeing, other then his mom.
But, for now he had to keep his true feelings for Tony as secret. Steve didn't want to rush into anything, like he said before, Steve wanted to start off as friends with Tony, even if half of the times, he was tempted to kiss the life force out of Tony.
"What happened to Jarvis dad?" Tony was worried about his butler.
They headed out of the museum and walked to the car park.
Bucky gave him a blank stare. "I should be the one asking you that. So, tell me why have you been acting weird since you came back, you punk." Bucky walked to the bed and sat down.
Tony faked a gasp. "How can you guys support me in becoming a friend with a stranger? Aren't you guys supposed to be looking out for me? Seriously, the world is a dangerous place, you can never trust anyone." Tony said in a serious tone. It wasn't that he was complaining, but it’s kind of suspiciously seeing them behave like, normally they're overprotective, when it came to Tony. Like Tony, had mentioned before, these two were like his parents.
"Believe me, Stark's charm makes any straight men, bent. He's fucking hot as fuck." Bucky said.
He hated living here by himself, especially without J.A.R.V.I.S. God knows where he even dropped his phone. Everything from yesterday night was blurry as fuck.
"Oh honey, I had no choice but to come, otherwise Pepper would've killed me." Tony replied, as he kissed her on the cheeks
He couldn't helped  but thought how fucking gorgeous Tony looked. His perfect trimmed beard and those soft swollen lips. Tony was flawlessly beautiful.
"-Steve! I've been looking for you for so long. What did I say about you coming to the rooftop alone? Steve, it's not safe." Tony reminded him with a sigh and sat next to Steve. Tony was recording everything with a video camera. "Anyway, aren't you gonna see me off? Who knows when we'll see each other the next time."
Joseph noticed Steve crying on his shoulder, he gently pat his back. "Now there, there. Let it all out. It's okay to cry once in a while." Joseph couldn't stand the sight of his son crying. It made his heart ache.
For some reason, the thought of accidentally hurting the man terrified him the most. He wouldn't be able to forgive himself if anything were to happen to the smaller man because of him.
His father averted his eyes from the newspaper and towards Steve instead. A bright smile breaks onto his face. His father got up and hugged Steve tight.
"The mission was completed quickly then expected and-" Rhodey cut himself off, as he noticed the blood on Tony's sliky white shirt.
"What the fuck!" Bucky cursed. "Why would Steve- Oh My God! Nat he actually did" Bucky said, as he carefully observed Steve.
"May I just remind you sir, you have an guest coming over right now." J.A.R.V.I.S announced.
His Tony, saved his best friend.
Ever since that day, everything related Tony was locked away, including the portrait of Tony that Steve secretly painted as a surprise for Tony.
Steve looked flustered. "Thank you!"
Tony burst into tears, he couldn't pretend anymore, not in front Rhodey. He sobbed into his shoulder.
Steve's eyes grew bigger, he was dumbstruck by Tony.
"I-I'm so sorry, Pepper. I love you. I'm sorry" Tony's voice trembled. He covered his face with both of his hands, as more tears were dripping down his cheeks.
"TONY!" Steve shouted, his eyes trembled in fear. The thing he was the most afraid of happened.
"I know you can hear me, just please open your eyes." Tony pleaded. "I can't stand watching you suffer, just tell me you're okay."
Steve didn't know how to react, this had been the best birthday party he'd ever had. All his wishes came true. He was truly grateful to his parents for throwing this party for him, otherwise he would never had met Tony.
"You didn't answer the question." Tony reminded Steve.
"No, it can't be. Steven was fine just a moment ago. Doctor, you've got it wrong."  Queen Sarah was in denial, the truth was too overwhelming for her.
Despite knowing that smoking can kill him, he smoked day and night, almost as if he was drinking water. He wanted to be punished for his sins, a slow death would a great punishment for him, he deserved it. He was destined to be alone.
Steve opened the drawer and got out a bottle of lubricate gel and condoms. Due to having skin contact with Tony, Steve's cold hands had warmed up.
"-Boss!" Happy called, he turned to Tony.
"Urm, Dad. Did you know Tony Stark and Pepper Pots broke up. I mean they're so perfect for each other. I've seen them once close up and from what I saw it looked like Mr Stark was madly in love with her. I'm sure he won't give up on her that easily." Peter purposely said that, as he carefully observed Steve. Don't get him wrong, he had no intentions of hurting his dad. He just needed to confirm something.
Steve was in cloud 9, he felt warm and contented.
How did Tony even do that with his eyebrows? Steve couldn't even do the simplest thing, as even winking. Maybe, Tony could teach him too. Oh, how he would love that. Steve waited so long to have a friend and now he finally has got one.
But, Pepper didn't let go of his arm, she was shaking in fear. She had to save Tony, no matter what. "Tony! Stop joking around! This is serious, please." She pleaded desperately, her voice was weak, it was almost as if she was about to cry.
Steve continued to walk in the rain. His clothes were soaking wet. It was during in rainy days like this, he felt worse then being dead.
"May I have this dance?" Steve held out his legt hand. He knew that much, this was the least Steve had been taught.
Five years later》
Time skip》
Steve wondered how it felt to be warm again. He reminisced about the good old days, he felt home sick. Steve didn't belong here, why was he even alive?
Steve pressed his body against Tony really tight. "Are fucking kidding me?" Steve shouted, his eyes were full of anger and betrayal.
Steve pushed his thoughts back aside for now and nodded. He went to the bathroom and took a quick shower. Steve wrapped a small towel around his waist and got out of the bathroom while drying his hair with a towel that was on his shoulder.
So why was he the one being scolded at? It wasn't Tony's fault, so why he getting blamed?
Tony gave him a warm smile. "Unless, you want to go out with me? I'm warning if you get bored and end up ditching me, I'll ruin you're life, Rogers. So, chop-chop make you're decisions, I'm waiting." Tony suggested.
"Tony, I swear if tell him anything about me, I'll end you" Natasha warned him.
"Thank you for informing me, J.A.R.V.I.S" Steve thanked the A.I with a smile and walked inside the elevator. He really liked J.A.R.V.I.S, after all Tony was the A.I's creator. From day one, Tony has programmed J.A.R.V.I.S to help Steve in any way that he can to make everything easier. Especially, with technologies 'cause Steve literally sucked at that. Steve had always felt so welcomed by Tony since day one. He absolutely loved that feeling.
Steve finally met him, after 10 long years. Now he was in front of him. Steve froze, he felt breathless.
It was Rhodey, he hadn't seen him for a while. Tony has known Rhodey since MIT, ever since then they have been best friends.
Steve couldn't help but notice how their body perfectly fitted together. It was almost as if he was made just for him. Steve knew he was smiling.
"Not gonna even lie, but that was a dumb thing to do" Steve admitted with a weak smile.
As he was washing his face, he suddenly recalled something; a pair of beautiful blue eyes. But he wasn't sure whether it'd happened or it was just a dream?
But, Steve gripped him by the wrist and twisted it behind his back. It was impossible for Tony to break from Steve's iron grip. Steve got his face closer to Tony and gripped his jaws. He licked his lips and slowly went down to his neck.
"I don't want you to leave, Tony." Steve spoke, looking up at Tony devastated. He wished Tony would stay with him.
Steve's heart ached, the pain was unbearable. But, not because of the fresh wound on his hand. But because of the thought of Tony being with someone else other then him, was awfully painful.
Steve felt the adrenaline move in his veins, his heartbeat repeatedly echoed into his ears with a *thump thump*.
"Who-" just before Tony could ask him, he was cut off. Steve cupped his face and pressed his lips against his. Steve licked Tony's bottom lips. Steve could taste the bitter taste of the alcohol on Tony's lips. He then slowly parted his lips.
Steve opened his eyes and saw Tony. He somehow managed to hold grip of Steve's hand in just a nick of time.
He was scared, as his lifeless body had fallen into the deep ocean with a big splash. The cold water devoured him completely, leaving his body frozen to the core.
Steve sighed. "Fine, I'll be honest. I just wanted to know how it felt to kiss another man." He lied. Obviously Steve already knew how it felt to kiss a man. After all he'd kissed Tony. That was his first time kissing someone, It felt like a sparked of magic; it was simply addicting. He wanted more.
A person in a black suit walked toward him and greeted him with a smile. It was his private secretary.
But, deep down Steve was afraid.
They both wondered around, taking time to get used to where everything were. The cruise ship was simply beautiful, the perfect place to spend your holiday. Maybe they'd enjoy this after finishing their mission.
Steve got up and refreshed himself. As he was eating breakfast, he noticed a card, with some beautiful banquet of flowers and something else in the bag.
His heart nearly jumped out of his chest, when he realized who the voice belonged to. Steve peaked inside and saw the man he was crazy in love with-Tony Stark.
Tony's eyes sparkled, a big smile formed on his face. "No way, your first was with me. The crown prince's first kiss was with me. My first kiss was with the prince. Oh God, tell me I'm not dreaming."
"Ah Honeybear!" Tony called out with a bright smile.
He parked his motorcycle and took off his helmet. Steve turned to Tony and they both started walking to the Cafe.
Steve smiled knowing that the protagonist did the same exact thing as Steve and yet both of them seemed to be unsure of their actions. Steve could understand how the protagonist must've felt because he felt the same.
His lips moved down to Tony's neck, slowly licking it and slightly biting into his skin, Steve wanted to leave marks on the man, so when the man were to wake up tomorrow morning with Mark's on his body, he'll remember the things they did together.
Even though, the rain was pouring down on them, Steve was able to feel the man's body heat, it was so fucking warm.
Steve was desperate for someone to say that to him. "Bucky, thank you, that means a lot." He whispered, his tears streamed down his cheeks.
"Ah Nat, was right about you. You really are dense." Tony sighed, rolling his eyes. "The truth is you're in love with Nat and you don't even know it" Tony whispered into Bucky’s ear.
Tony looked at Steve. "I know your the crown prince and all, but do you want to hang out with me? It's your birthday, we can do anything you want. If not, I'm going to ditch this party and go home. I have a lot of work to do."
"I broke into his house, okay, you heard me perfect and clear." Steve said.
Their friendship was over and it was all Steve's fault. Steve couldn't breathe properly, he felt dizzy. He took countless steps back.
"No, you're safety comes first, Stark." Steve argued back, while putting the helmet on Tony's head, ensuring that he wore it perfectly.
Tony couldn't help but notice how Steve's expression suddenly changed; he looked upset.
This work is a re-upload of my old work , so if this looks familiar to you, it's coz you've read it before.
P.S. You know who I am. ~(> v < )~ " Steve read the message out loud. He couldn't stop smiling.
"Stark helped me" Steve replied. "So how did the mission." He asked.
Tony gulped, his eyes were shaking in fear. He had never seen Steve this angry before, it was simply petrifying. It was almost as if he was a completely different person.
Rhodey and Pepper chuckled slightly, it was their first seeing Tony blushing because of someone, let alone a man or to be more precise, Steve.
Tony didn't want Steve to see his chest, especially because he had an arc reactor inside the middle of his chest. It wasn't that Tony was insecure about his heart condition.
"Of course, Bye Mr Stark" Steve said as he opened the car door and got out.
This time he heard the voice clearly. "- why can't you just tell Bucky that your madly in love with him, Nat?" Tony asked with a light sigh.
"Stevie! Just what in hell, do you think you're doing with my man?" Natasha asked, she stood there leaning against the door frame, with her hands floded across.
Bucky approached near Steve. "Shit, no way. Stark actually did that. If I knew Stark would've done this, I would happily have got injured too." Bucky pouted.
"Are you trying to escape from me too, Boo?" Steve asked with a dangerous tone to his voice. He couldn't help himself from teasing the man.
"The boy, has a poor health and an extremely weak body. He needs to be in full mediations at all times." The doctor stated.
"Are you okay? Please tell me you can breathe properly." He asked with an anxious look on his face.
"I know you love me, honeybear."
"That's great! Now let's get going then." Howard said, patting Steve on the shoulder and heading out first.
He knew his dad wasn't aware of his true feelings for Tony yet, Steve was a little oblivious and dense when it came to feelings and emotions.
Tony gasped, his eyes widened. "Wait, what! No fucking way. I thought you'd be two or three years younger then me." Tony said. "Damn it Rogers, now I feel insercure about my visuals when standing next to you." Tony pouted.
"You should see yourself in the mirror when you look at her. It's like she means the world to you. Let me guess you also keep feeling these weird things, like you can't seem to explain it but you know that it's a good feeling. Some how, it makes you weak yet strong." Tony stated.
"I'm surprised you've already thought of a nickname for me," Steve admitted.
"What were doing when you noticed Steve?" Rhodey asked, even though he already knew the answer to that.
He knew his mom got a new job and worked in a private hospital, but he never knew it would be like this.
Rhodey sighed. "It does, if you were to look at it from another directions. So, Tony. Let me ask you something." He asked.
He was tall and blond, a perfect boyfriend material, the girls in school went crazy for him. But, Steve was single, he didn't care about dating nor did he want to date anyone. Steve believed in true love, he wanted someone who'd love him for eternity and someone who completed him. Talk about old fashion, for Steve it was worth the wait.
"Nat and Bucky, took care of everything" Clint replied.
"I-I'm so s-sorry Steve, I..." Tony stuttered. He didn't know what else to say other then how sorry he was.
Tony pulled Pepper into a tight hug. He felt her body trembling against his.
He can barely remember what he ate for breakfast this morning.
"Ah you poor thing" She replied in a gentle tone, tousling his hair like a child.
"For a moment, I completely forgot about you're billionaire ego." Natasha sighed, shaking her head.
Tony gasped, "Hey, I'm not little" Tony pouted.
Steve's heart skipped a beat, it was driving him crazy.
"Steve, how are you feeling? Are you uncomfortable? Do you need something? You must be hungry, c'mon you need to eat to stay healthy." Steve's mum Sarah asked.
"I'll pay for everything, just make sure he's alright and inform his family member, but don't mention me at all." He said and walked off.
Steve was over at Bucky's house. Bucky was his best friend since kindergarten.
"Of course, baby." Tony replied.
"We've reached to the Stark Tower" Happy stated. "By the way, you do realize you're smiling to yourself, what were you thinking about?" He smirked.
Steve's lips curved into a smile, he had dance tecahers in the past, but due to lack of communication and confidence, Steve couldn't learn anything.
Why was Tony so different from everyone? Why was he the only one treating Steve normally? No one had ever called him.
"Dad!" Tony growled. Tony's ear turned red. He was blushing.
"-Tony! Are you even listening?" Natasha rhetorically asked, hoping to get his attention.
Steve could never live without Tony. He didn't want waste more time, then he already has. He needed to speak with Tony and fix everything. He can't give up just yet, not after what he and Tony had went through together.
Rhodey and Pepper looked at each other and smirked. Tony knew that face, they were definitely up to something. Tony gulped, that something can't be good. Dear Lord, Tony didn't want to know. He already knew what they're going to say.
"As an apology, would you like to have coffee with me. I-I mean you don't have to it, it's okay to refuse. But, I thought maybe we could start again. I don't want there to be any misunderstanding between us, I don't want to be in bad terms with you. I've admired you for so long, this all feel like a dream to me. So please let me make this up to."
Bucky immediately jumped up, the moment Steve had loosen his grip around him.
"No way! He's my second favourite character too. Looks like we both have something in common, other then good looks." Tony chuckled.
He had seen the real Tony Stark. The one behind all those masks. Oh God! He was beautiful. There was no other words to describe it. Steve's heart tightened, almost drawing the life out of him. Steve clenched his fist, the pain was unbearable.
Steve ripped Tony's shirt open, exposing his bare skin. Steve pulled his shirt collar down. Tony immediately felt a rush of panic. Something was off about Steve; he was different. Why wasn’t he listening to a word Tony was saying? "Steve, what the fuck are you doing?" He shouted, he held Steve's hand to stop him.
The doctor was beside Steve, already started doing a full checkout on Steve, he monitored and did some test on him. After receiving the test results of Steve, the doctor turned toward the king and queen.
Bucky always wanted to meet him; he admired Tony. He was dumbstruck about when he'd found out how young Tony was when he'd became a CEO.
Those words felt a punch in the stomach. He made Tony cry. Now, Tony hated him, his only friend hated him. He didn't even call Steve by his first name, have they gone back to being strangers?
"You what?" Natasha asked in disbelief.
Was he worried about Steve?
Steve's beautiful night abruptly changed; the mood had suddenly darkened, as if obeying the laws of pathetic fallacy.
When out of blue, Steve heard a familiar voice spoke, he promptly stared at the TV and froze.
The painful memory of Tony crying haunted him. He never wanted to see Tony in that state again. The thought of Tony being completely broken to the point he'd shed tears, it broke Steve's fucking heart. He couldn't bear to see Tony in pain.
After an endless run, Tony finally stopped. He panted heavily, his hand were on his chest.
Tony nodded. "I know right, I think we deserve an award for having the best ship name " Tony stated confidently.
Steve cut the cake and after an hour the party was over.
Tony had the most divine smile, Tony looked so beautiful. There was no other words to describe it other than that.
Tony struggled to break free, even though he knew it was pointless. "Please, stop Steve." Tony pleaded, he was scared.
it until now, that you were in love with Stark. That's explains it."
Steve's face turned pale, his heart had broken into million of pieces like a mirror that had crashed into the ground and shuttered into pieces. It's impossible to fix a mirror that was shuttered into million of pieces. That's why they'd replace the broken mirror with a new one.
If only she had a chance to thank the young man properly for saving her son's life. She is forever in debt with the unknown young man.
Tony also shared many stories about soulmates with Steve. He told him about how people who are soulmates would have each other's names written on their left wrist like a tattoo or have soulmarks; that meant they were destined to be together and it was a physical proof of identifying their special bond that they had with each other.
After a few minutes, Pepper slowly broke apart from the hug, but, her hands still remained in his shoulders. "Tony, you're one of the few people's I have in my life and I can't bear to lose you. I just can't Tony, you are far more important to me." She said.
Natasha pulled Tony into a hug. "Tony, I didn't think you'd even show up."
Steve beamed in happiness. He couldn't even believe Tony helped him, that he even called his name.
The last thing he heard was Natasha screaming his name.
Maybe by asking questions would help to enlight the mood- okay fine, he wanted to know more about Steve. So, what! It's not like it meant anything. You can't blame Tony for being curious. Steve Rogers was too fucking hot. No doubt he's already taken.
I also thought I was hallucinating Tony, but it was all real.
"Shit, how could I have not guessed that. Obviously, a rich guy would only could afford to pay for that expensive treatment." Bucky let out a deep sigh.
A voice interrupted them. "Tony said that because he really cares about you, Steven." Steve's mother Sarah Rogers, the queen reassured him.
“Of course, Anne.” Good thing Steve was such a kiss up an remembered her name. Tony had planned on just calling her darling the whole time.
The fact that Tony could still sense all the things Steve was feeling and seeing even though Steve was over four miles away at this point, helped Tony with step two of his plan.
So guys, this chapter is a little bit longer than the previous ones. But it was also way harder for me to write. I hope it wasn't to all over the place. And I hope you like it.
That feeling lasted all of about five seconds, when Tony became so overwhelmed that he felt like he was floating. It happened so quickly he wasn’t even sure at first what was going on. One minute he was laying on his bed feeling sorry for himself, and the next he was in the park.
When Tony and Steve had left the meeting, Steve had even stopped Tony and asked him privately if Tony was really okay with attending the interview. Steve had bitten his lip when he asked, which was distracting, and Tony could sense that Steve was worried that Tony would fall apart if the interviewer even so much as hinted at his relationship with Pepper. It had actually kind of… sweet. Totally unnecessary, but sweet. After Tony had reiterated again that it was no big deal for him, Tony tried to hint to Steve that he could back out if he really wanted to, Shield be damned.
And so, it began. Tony did end up inviting the rest of the Avengers. He had been meaning to do it anyway, but Steve’s little f-you to Shield just pushed him towards it quicker.
Tony didn’t really mind. He figured he could use this press event to get out of some of the interviews he was sure Pepper had lined up for him, because he was sure that she would love a very vanilla interview he was most likely going to give thanks to dear old Cap. And he was used to the whole dog and pony show. He had long perfected the answering a question without saying anything at all.
Tony should have known that something huge was around the corner, especially given how good things had been. Tony should have known that good things don’t last.
It started after a fight with some wannabe magician who was attempting to destroy the world. Which to Tony was the worst possible kind of villain. Magic was bad enough as is, the world didn’t need someone who was BAD at magic too.
Now any normal person would have looked at Steve’s actions that day and stayed far away from him. Or at least would recognize that Steve was dangerous and would stay a professional distance away from him. Tony, being the man that he is, was only intrigued by Steve even more. It was clear that Steve just wasn’t some perfect soldier that did whatever Shield told him to do. Steve clearly had his own set of morals and wouldn’t hedge on them. And it was clear Steve had been through some things and had his own set of demons. Tony could respect that. It wasn’t as though Tony wasn’t dealing with his own shit.
Step one, he needed to put on clothes and get ready for the day because he thought better with his life semi together.
Tony was so deep into his musing that he almost missed what the interviewer asked. He only zoned back in, because Steve noticed the gleeful look on her face which Steve thought could only lead to trouble.
But it didn’t seem like the Avengers were going to leave anytime soon. Thor only lived in the tower part time because he was still responsible for what happened in Asgard. Bruce came and went too because of all of his personal mission trips. But no matter how long he was gone, he always came back. Clint and Natasha used the tower for a home-base after their missions because they still worked for Shield in other capacities. Tony didn’t love that they were still out there doing things that they couldn’t talk about, even though they were all on the same team, but he came to understand that they were spies through and through.
Tony knew that was going to one of his first arguments, so he just countered insisting the only reason it seemed excessive was because Shield only gave Steve one room. And this way he could have his own bathroom and kitchen and wasn’t that just great? And then followed that up with a guilt trip about how the Avengers really needed to put down roots and didn’t they deserve that? And as their leader Steve should set an example. It was laying it on thick, but the two-pronged approach seemed to work since Steve didn’t bring it up again.
P.S. This chapter was inspired in part by an interview that Tom Hardy did where the interviewer asked him about his sexuality and it was horrible.
After his initial hesitance, Steve seemed to enjoy being in the tower. Tony liked to believe that it was because Steve was starting to feel at home in the tower and not just because Steve had nowhere else to go and the tower had a state-of-the-art gym.
Steve began chewing on his lip, contemplating the offer. Tony wished he would hurry up, because it was a good look on Steve and it was making the room seem a little bit warmer every second that went by.
Tony waved his hand around. “It’s over and done with Capsicle. I actually have a proposition for you. I wanted to know if you want to move into the tower.”
“I just wanted to ask you about-” She wasn’t even half way through her question before Tony heard an internal plea:
Step three of the plan involved learning to control the thoughts Tony was getting long enough for him to figure out how to fix it. That probably involved figuring out how it happened in the first place.
Steve frowned. “You think I need to be at the tower,” Steve said slowly, seeming to test out each word.
“That’s the spirit. I’ll send you the passcodes and I’ll make up a room for you that should be ready in a week. Let me know if I need to send someone over to help you with any boxes.” It was really a whole floor, but Tony thought mentioning that wouldn’t make Steve any more endeared to the idea.
It worked. The team was working together better than ever, and Tony would even classify him and Steve as friends. It was a whole new world.
It was hard at first, he wasn’t going to lie. He wasn’t used to having so many people in his space. He had Pepper for a little while, but she was always gone saving the company, saving the world, saving Tony from himself. And eventually he didn’t even have her.
Tony winced. He didn’t think about how this would look to Steve. It wasn’t like the two of them were best friends or anything. Steve probably thought Tony was going to make him live in the tower to keep an eye on him, because Tony thought he was dangerous.
After Tony so gracefully fled from Steve, Steve sought him out. Because of course he did. Steve wanted to know if there was something going on with Tony, because he was acting weird lately and he thought something might be wrong. And it would have been the moment to say that something was wrong. But Tony was a coward and said everything was fine. So instead of coming clean, Tony decided the best thing to do would be to not tell Steve anything and only use his newfound powers for good.  Like becoming better friends with Steve. It was an admirable goal and totally worth keeping a secret from Steve. Totally. Tony just had to keep reminding himself of that fact. Repeatedly.
All of this added up to Tony going to Steve’s Shield issued room after their failed training session.
“Well if you think it’s best for the team,” Steve hedged, “then I suppose I should move in.” Steve still seemed hesitant, but Tony could work with that.
It was just too much for her, and she decided that Tony and her shouldn’t occupy their space and room in the same way anymore. She had explained it all in a way that made so much sense, that it would seem like Tony was being unreasonable if he argued. So, he didn’t. He watched her walk away and tried to pretend that she wasn’t taking a big piece of him with her as she was leaving.
Especially at times like now when Tony could see through the chink in the armor that Steve so carefully put together. The two of them were doing an interview together. Fury and someone from Shield who said a lot of words that Tony had paid absolutely no attention to, said it would be a good idea to put a face to the Avengers. Remind the people that the Avengers were people. Which was ridiculous because the team included an actual god and whatever the hell the Hulk was. And Steve. Who was a super-human, but Tony guesses was tangentially human enough for the Shield people, because Shield still thought it was a good idea to make him and Tony the face of the Avengers. Aka they were chosen to give pointless interviews about their personal lives.
