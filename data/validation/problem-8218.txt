‘Does he want to practise his Greek?’ Natasha smirks.
He gets distracted by Sam moving towards the back of the labs to take a phone call, his sensitive hearing picking up the words unintentionally.
‘Get in line,’ Steve growls, coming up to them after having thrown another inmate into a cell and slamming the door shut.
‘That’s a lot more markings than we thought there would be,’ he remarks, seeing they reach from over head height down to nearly the ground and span nearly his entire arm span.
‘Thank you,’ Tony cuts off whatever Bucky was going to say. ‘Whether you can help or not, I appreciate the offer.’
‘Yeah I’m fine just couldn’t sleep.’
‘Hey, Captain sir, can I have a boost?’ Peter asks. Steve looks a little wary but nods and cups his hands as the kid runs at his, boosting him so high that he sails over the top of Sam. ‘Wow this is awesome!’ he shouts, then shoots webs at Sam’s back, effectively dragging himself through the air to land between his shoulders.
‘Son of a bitch,’ the inventor growls.
‘Did he just admit someone else had advanced tech?’ Clint puts a hand to Tony’s forehead. ‘He
‘Of course, sir,’ the assistant makes sure to note down his exact words. ‘And our friends in the East? Shall I send them any message?’
Then a voice he knows far too well comes over the prison speakers and says a word in poorly pronounced Russian. A word that has ice settling in Tony’s stomach. When the second word in the sequence is said he fires up his suit.
‘Better. It’s been hard since May’s left, especially since Wade is still away on his assignment for Fury, he’s spent the last two nights with me and Steve.’
‘No as we were all a part of that wondrous event,’ the thunder god booms.
‘Only one person would be stupid enough to try and speak to me this early in the morning,’ Tony grumbles, face covered by one hand. ‘Put it through, FRIDAY,’ he gives the call enough time to be patched through and then continues. ‘Ross what do you want this early? I’ve not even had my first mug of coffee so it better be life or death.’
forgive. It was an illusion. It wasn’t real. I
you get the other ones from anyway?’ Sam asks him.
‘You brought me a what?’
‘How is he?’ Steve asks when Natasha walks into the common area.
‘One of many,’ she smiles at the alien as the team fill in the Guardians with their normal Christmas plans.
Thank you so much as always for all your support.
‘Kid,’ Sam’s tone is warning, but still light.
‘And someone needs to be with Barnes,’ he adds.
Motherfucker. Now I can’t see.
‘Fine,’ the merc sighs and comes over to steal some of the syrup from the pot.
A/N: Hi everyone! Well I hope you've enjoyed the last of the double updates, and the start of the proper Stony action. Everything will really start picking up now so be prepared for a couple of ups and downs coming your way!
‘Clear,’ Steve steps into the room, continuing to cast his gaze around as he heads towards the desk covered in equipment on the far side. ‘Nat you might want to make your way in here?’
‘Any news with you, Your Majesty?’
to do at Christmas. Probably save kittens from trees or something.
‘I’m afraid so.’
‘Goodnight,’ Loki says softly, watching her leave. Then he turns to where Bucky is sitting in the shadows. ‘Trying to perfect your sneak abilities?’
Do let me know what you think, getting reviews really does make my day, plus it lets me know if I'm doing the characters justice. Also if there's any requests or suggestions I may be able to find a way to incorporate them into the story.
‘Definitely Francis,’ Wade chimes in, ‘fucker wouldn’t know a mop even if I shoved it up his-’
Oh and he’s managed to avoid Bucky so far, which is a feat in itself as it’s been a close run thing a couple of times. Why they had to make these shirt collars so tight is beyond him, and the tie feels like it’s strangling him. He notices Wanda over in a corner and decides to go over.
‘Because I want you to have a normal life before giving it over entirely to being an Avenger, or any kind of superhero,’ he explains. ‘Because once you start doing this shit full time you can’t just give it up and go back to a normal life, especially if everyone knows who you are. Pete you’re only sixteen, that’s too young to give up everything to help other people all the time; too young to put your life on the line for them. I know,’ he raises a hand for Peter to stay quiet as he pulls away, frowning and opening his mouth to protest. ‘I know you can’t sit back and do nothing, which is why I gave you back the suit, why you come up here every other weekend. Why I don’t stop you from being Spider-Man. But you still need to be Peter Parker as well. You need to have the chance to go through school, get drunk under-age at parties-’
As he pulls away Peter knows there’s a big smile on his face. ‘I take it no one else knows yet?’
‘He did promise not to let the Winter Soldier pick you up for a while,’ his friend reminds him.
‘So you just forgave him? Just like that?’
‘You were the one who wanted me to be the leader in the field. How can I be expected to lead someone who doesn’t trust me?’
‘Tony I-’
story to bore us all with out of it.’
So maybe a bit of background into the second half of this chapter: I decided to put this in because, in one version of the comics, Thanos isn't getting the Infinity Stones to wipe out half the universe in some misguided attempt to stop over-crowding, he's actually doing it to impress Lady Death. Who just so happens to be in love with Deadpool (I think he actually marries her in one of the comics as well), and when Thanos finds this out he curses Wade with immortality using the Infinity Stones. I just mixed it up a little bit for this story.
Before he can reply Rhodes’ voice cuts across them both. ‘Tony you got two transports and five cars just pulled up. Ross is getting out of one car and a shit ton of soldiers are coming out the transports.’
‘You shouldn’t be worrying about anyone but yourself,’ she reassures the younger woman. ‘How you doing?’
‘-hey Matt have you met Steve yet?’ Peter tries to manoeuvre the man away from the situation.
‘Mr Stark how do you think the trial is going to go?’
‘Orange juice?’ Loki offers, and if he’s being friendly to the mercenary just to irritate Bucky then no one needs to know.
‘So, what? The agreement that if he could be healed from the brainwashing he’d be allowed back as a full US Citizen was just a load of bullshit?’ Tony demands.
‘Maybe, depends how annoying you are later,’ he grins in response.
(See the end of the chapter for
They’d taken a couple of days to go over Afghanistan and everything that had happened during his recovery. Tonight he’s finally opening up about Obi, and he’s promised himself not to hold back anything. He’s already kept enough back, and he feels that he owes them the full story of Obadiah Stane. Hopefully it’ll let them piece together some of the things he hasn’t already mentioned.
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘I’m sure Bucky will appreciate it as much as I will,’ he smiles in reply.
‘Tony?’
‘Don’t, Barnes,’ Paul says, standing with his own pointing at Bucky.
wants to ask how you manage that,’ she says to Tony, ‘but I really don’t want to know the answer.
‘Is it just me, or is this going a little too smoothly?’ Wade pipes up.
‘Tony I really don’t think that’s a good idea,’ she says, looking to Steve for support.
‘I’ve been a bit of a brat haven’t I?’ comes down the phone.
Rhodes shrugs. ‘Only by reputation. From what I heard he was one of the best soldiers we had, still has one of the highest number of confirmed kills, but he was dishonourably discharged and I never heard any more from him. Not really surprised he became a merc, quite a few soldiers do if they don’t leave from injury.’
,’ Tony’s voice is quiet through the comms, and Steve knows he’s set it to a private channel.
Strange laughs. ‘No I think I’ve been skating a grand total of five times in my life, none of which ended with me staying standing the whole time.’
Wanda looks downcast. ‘I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to do that now, Peter.’
that’s going to do more damage.’
But Bucky’s all-time favourite experience in the training room came one morning when Natasha entered the kitchen as he was helping himself to a mug of coffee.
Peter really wishes someone could get the man to shut up for once. Matt’s smirk is telling him he can hear every single word, and he’s pretty sure the man wants to punch him hard enough to knock him out.
‘Oh come on nothing more than kissing was going to happen!’ Wade defends himself. ‘I’ve already told him that.’
Tony shrugs. ‘I’m not going to stop you,’ he replies. ‘Just remember we have to work with them so try not to go all ‘Captain America’ on me. Right now I need, Steve Rogers.’
‘I think we should help this attractive man,’ the quiet one adds, ‘he looks to be a worthy warrior.’
Ruined my big dramatic entrance. So rude.
to; he deserves someone who is going to want
‘Great another chat with the psycho.’ Bucky grumbles.
It should have been easier to fight Thanos when he only had one hand. Apparently not. The Titan was determined to get his gauntlet back, and unfortunately Wade was winding him up.
‘I’ll help too,’ Shuri volunteers, ‘I’ll be more help there than anywhere else.’ Tony gives her a grateful smile.
A new enemy starts moving to the next phase of their plan
‘Thanks, Wade,’ he says, pausing at a crossing for the lights to change. ‘I’m not going to be allowed on patrol until we find him so we may have to wait for tacos.’
Bucky cuts off Wanda’s response. -
‘It’s only one lap, Sam,’ Bucky chuckles, ‘so there’s no way you’ll be lapped again.’
‘He’s so cocky, he’s obviously expecting someone to come and get him out,’ the archer continues.
‘You were going to say I’ve been teaching Peter too many of my bad habits. Don’t deny it.’
‘Can we sleep first at least?’ he asks.
and I- I thought the last things I was ever going to say to you were-’
‘Tony,’ Steve says warningly.
‘If he doesn’t already,’ he replies, ‘it’s only a matter of time.’
‘Are they yours too?’
‘Yeah I had that at first, but I think being part of the Avengers meant that stopped pretty quick. You know Dum Dum took over leading the Commandos after I crashed the plane? I always thought he’d do well leading a group. Had plans after the war to grow the team and split into two with him leading the other one.’
‘Can we go home now?’ Peter cuts across the argument. Wade’s hand lands on his shoulder and squeezes. He can’t find the energy to reach up and grab it.
‘What do I need to do?’
‘Paying a visit to a new friend,’ he responds.
‘I also suggested,’ T’Challa picks up the lead again, ‘that we approach different countries for permission to have bases established there, making it easier to perform missions out of those areas; they may be more willing to co-operate if we agree to employ local people in them as well, and funding research within the facility from local talent.’
‘Please don’t tell me he’s got
‘Nothing is happening between me and Loki.’
'That sounds like a challenge to me,' Bucky enters their conversation, putting an arm around Peter's shoulders. 'What do you guys think?'
‘Hey Howard,’ Bucky’s soft voice travels through the quiet as the soldier kneels in front of the two graves. ‘I know I shouldn’t really be here, all things considered, but I needed to see you before I leave again. Looks like I’ve not done a good a job as normal this time, and I’m sorry that means that Steve can’t come back. From what he told me you two had become good friends, and I wanted to thank you for being there for him when he thought I was dead. Not that I repaid you very well for that. Howard, I am so sorry for what I did; I hope you know if I was in control of my mind I never would have done it. I hope you knew that back then.
‘The best part?’ Valkyrie tells the spy with a grin. ‘I’m not even attracted to men.’
Peter bits his lip. ‘I killed him,’ he admits.
‘It’s stopping me from phasing,’ Vision pants out.
‘But-’ Ned cuts him off by dragging him back towards the school. Soldiers are heading their way from the street. Growling in frustration Peter grabs his two friends’ arms and drags them back inside, shouting for everyone else to run.
‘No, no, no, no,’ Peter repeats the one word mantra and stumbles out of the room, pushing past Deadpool.
Steve nods. Before he can say anything to the rest of the group, something happens he never would have expected.
‘Is: I’ll web you upside down half up the side of the Empire State Building, a good enough reason?’
‘I suggest we bring them back one or two at a time. Give them the opportunity to prove to us they want to work together again, give the public opportunity to accept them and see we’ve all accepted we went wrong, and give them the chance to learn to trust us again.’
He muses as he continues to take some deep breaths.
‘All audience members. We’ve got them identified as a Sarah Whittle, August Brain, Emma Lockwood, and two high-schoolers Edward Leeds and Peter Parker.’
‘Yeah…just,’ Peter takes a breath, ‘when we get in, I want to check they’re…you know, actually the team. Is that…is that alright?’
‘Pretty impossible seeing as I never saw you when I was there,’ Bucky retorts. ‘What’s going on, Rumlow?’
‘What-?’
‘Don’t fight it Doctor Banner,’ Peter’s voice sounds calm over the comms. ‘Just trust him.’
‘Yes! Go Pete!’ Wanda cheers from behind him.
‘It was certainly tiring I’ll say that for it,’ Steve agrees, staying where he is at the door and watching the dark haired man.
‘Tony are you alright?’ Peter frowns as he watches the inventor walk to the kitchenette. ‘You’re walking funny.’
‘Wakandans!’ T’Challa shouts. ‘Protect the Jotuns! Kings Guard to me!’
He just sticks his tongue out at her and replies.
‘God this is so embarrassing,’ he whines, settling down in the man’s arm. ‘They’re worse than May! It’s like having far too many parents in the same room.’
He looks down at his shoes and sighs. ‘I just don’t want to be a burden on her.’
‘Err…yeah can I interrupt this conversation please?’ Scott hurries over. ‘Cassie your mom would
‘Now, what’s the next move, Mister Stark?’
‘He’s spending every moment he can working on healing,’ Tony replies, ‘if that’s not enough of an indication I’m not sure what is.’
‘I don’t. But I had a demonstration earlier and asked Tony if I could come pick you up afterwards so Happy drove,’ she explains. ‘Come on he’s waiting for us. Is he always this impatient?’
Loki gives him a small smile. ‘Perhaps it has indeed,’ he agrees. ‘Nevertheless I shall be here when you return.’
He raises an eyebrow at her. ‘You mean like bringing you to a bar full of mercenaries?’
‘Oh?’ Rumlow leans forwards on the table. ‘What proposition do you have for us Mister Stark?’
‘What about him?’ Natasha asks.
‘Yeah. Tell me about it. Let’s get moving.’
‘So we got the first proper special coming up at the end of the week. Yep you heard right. Less than one fucking week people! It’s all focusing on my Baby Boy and him having an “interview” to join the Superhero Squad. Yes I did air quote. Get the fuck over it already. Basically we get to follow that beautiful spandex-clad ass as he does his superhero thing and saves people. Honestly bring the popcorn, anything with that ass in it is going to be awesome!’
‘I’m kind of freaking out that you have had this much interaction with him. Ok now I
There’s a grunt from Francis as Wade manages to kick him in the stomach. But Bucky would say it was more a grunt from the air being forced out of his lungs with the blow rather than one of pain. He frowns, but continues to prepare his shot, resting the rifle on the crates and waiting for his opportunity.
Ned shakes his head. ‘I’m meeting Mom down the shops, I’ll see you on Monday? Who’s picking you up?’
Tony curses under his breath. The plane has now come to a standstill and the stairs are being locked into place. ‘What do we do?’ Wanda asks, immediately sobering up.
‘I am Groot.’
'Me?' the inventor asks, stepping forwards. 'How can I help?'
‘What…’ Wanda’s eyes suddenly light up. ‘You know where he is.’
‘That’s not convincing at all.’
‘Two drinks,’ she predicts.
is the first thing you thought when I left the trip early?’ Peter counters. ‘Not the fact that, I don’t know, I
‘We don’t have time for this,’ Natasha reminds him.
‘And I reset it for you,’ she rolls her eyes as she sits next to Sam, ‘stop being such a baby, you’ll be fine by the time you go to bed.’
‘Next time don’t rely on Rhodey to fly you with the webs,’ Wanda suggests as they all gather around the tree they’d set up in the common area. Sam, Steve and Bucky are finishing up the lights, with Sam perching on Steve’s shoulders to get the lights around the very top of the tree. Vision is already starting on putting the tinsel on, and is doing a rather artful job of it.
‘A sensible suggestion,’ Loki says from his seat, ‘I for one am ready to sleep for a full day; but I suspect I shall not be allowed to.’
?’ Secretary Ross looks at him like he’s finally gone mad.
‘I’ve only just got him to stop keeping a gun under the pillow,’ Peter adds. ‘His hand print is in the system. He’s cut off his hand, ripped his shirt to form a rope, slipped the severed hand through the window and swung it until it hits the sensor and it’s opened the door.’
‘I’ve been gone for
He’s promised to keep his suit on under his clothes so the team can track him if they need to, and he’s checking in through text or phone every couple of hours. They’ve also got surveillance through the apartment just to be on the safe side. It had all been part of the agreement Natasha had made with him in order for him to go home. She’d understood his not being able to stay there, for which he was eternally grateful.
‘I got it!’ Peter says, firing a web at the flying object, and promptly gets dragged along behind it. ‘Hey!’ his shout of surprise is quickly swallowed as he gets dragged face first into the dirt and he lets go of the web. Another blaster sends the ball away again.
‘You mean you two aren’t related?’ she asks, looking back at the girl and back at him.
‘Tony-’ Steve starts to protest with a laugh.
‘It’s a Christmas jumper!’
A/N: Merry Christmas Eve everyone! I hope you enjoy the penultimate chapter of this special. There's one more chapter 'New Year's Eve' still to come, which I'll post on Friday. I hope you're still enjoying this story, if you have been enjoying it and haven't read 'Restoration' why not give it a go?
‘But there is still plenty!’
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘Eventually,’ Tony responds. ‘Though I was hoping you’d do it right about NOW!’
Tony would be lying if he said the comment about Steve helping because he felt it was his responsibility hadn’t hurt a little; but during their chats the blond had actually seemed to be genuinely worried about him so he hoped duty wasn’t his only reason for wanting to help.
‘Oh,’ Steve pauses, suddenly feeling awkward. ‘Um… do you want me to go?’
Peter pulls Ned towards the car with him, trying desperately to ignore all the muttering behind him. Well at least people will believe his Stark Internship story now. ‘Mr Stark, this is Ned Leeds. Ned, Mr Stark.’
‘Just waiting on you, Widow,’ he replies, and Steve can’t help the warm feeling of pride as the computers come to life in front of him, Natasha simply helping Tony speed along the hacking process. ‘This would have been quicker if you’d let me come along you know.’
‘Nat? Get the jet ready, we’re leaving. Vis and I will meet you all there in a couple of minutes,’ he says.
It’s nothing like what she was expecting.
Bucky knows Loki is partly right, but he’s also wondering something himself.
‘Of course I did!’ Sam laughs. ‘I wasn’t passing up that opportunity!’
‘We’re having a discussion about tact,’ he hears Wanda mutter and gives a small chuckle.
‘Peter Benjamin Parker-’
‘Look out!’ Loki shouts, and Peter turns to see a shadowy figure nearly on him.
Tony rolls his eyes as he takes hold of the kid’s other sleeve. ‘Stop playing dumb. The way you look at him I’m surprised your Aunt May didn’t lock you in your room and refuse to let you out.’
‘Don’t try and talk to me like you’re my dad!’ Peter shouts back, not even sure why he’s angry anymore. ‘You’re not my dad and you’re nothing like Uncle Ben so you don’t get to tell me what to do!’
‘Hang on Baby Boy I just gotta update these guys!’ Deadpool turns back and sighs, shaking his head. ‘Teenagers these days just don’t know the meaning of the word patience. Anyhoo where was I? Oh yeah! Doing the author’s job.
It feels strange not eating with the team and being in the facility. He’s still feeling a bit out of sorts when he enters the door and joins the line, wondering who will have been cooking upstairs.
‘One step ahead of you,’ he replies, wincing as he reaches up to flip a switch. The engines roar to life as Sam and Vision fly through the back. ‘Let’s go kids.’ Sam closes the door as the jet takes off, and Steve is just able to catch sight of two red clad men disappearing into the darkness of the streets before it closes behind them.
Steve decides to take pity on the inventor and the teenager and takes a mouthful himself. He can’t help being surprised. ‘Tony did you make this from scratch?’
‘Erm, should we do something?’ he hears Peter ask as his friend shoves him outside.
‘I’m sure we would have had tons of fun terrorising you together,’ he says, ‘I hear that’s what brothers are supposed to do to their sisters.’ She laughs in agreement and they both pick up their spoons again, turning their attention back to the film.
‘This better not be some weird way of saying the interior décor sucks,’ Tony mutters, glancing at the clock and surprised to see it’s nearly three in the morning. ‘Hey FRIDAY didn’t I tell you to let me know when it got to midnight?’
Tony just laughs in response as Natasha makes her way over to them. ‘Here you go, Tony, here’s your present,’ she smiles at him. They’d decided that each person would receive one of their presents at Yule and the rest at Christmas, similar apparently to something called a Secret Santa which seemed to make sense to the rest of the team but still left Loki a bit clueless.
she reminds herself,
He turns to face the billionaire again. ‘Yes,’ he answers quietly.
Strange doesn’t reply and Natasha joins him and they head back to the facility. ‘Hey, Nat?’
aren’t going.’
‘Because the Quentin Beck from this world was fired from Stark Industries for being mentally and emotionally unstable. He also just so happens to be an expert in holographic-illusions. He was one of the key figures in the BARF project.’
‘That all you guys wanted to say?’ Wade asks, snatching the tickets up from the table. ‘Can we go now?’
‘I told you when we faced Ultron we’d do it together, and again when we were all back here. I meant it Tony, every word. Even more so now than I did then. Anything that comes our way we’ll do it together. Tony, I-’
are you telling me of all people?’
‘Nat don’t turn this into a bloody mission,’ Tony moans from next to Steve; he takes the inventor’s hand in his own and gives it a quick squeeze before releasing it. They haven’t told anyone outside the team about their relationship yet and are wanting to keep it that way as long as possible.
‘Well, well, looks like you are going to play ball after all,’ Rumlow sneers when he notices the dark jeans and hoodie that Steve has on.
Everyone turns to look at Loki, and Peter sees the dawning horror on his face and tries not to laugh. ‘Oh no,’ he says, ‘no. I’m not doing it, Thor.’
‘Valkyrie obviously knows them as well.’
‘I’ll make sure there’s a good bottle of whiskey waiting for you,’ he promises and receives a nod in thanks.
‘Tony, stay with me!’
‘I wasn’t here all the time,’ Rhodes responds, ‘and before me there weren’t really many friends around for him.’
‘I’ve got Strange’s Time Stone,’ Steve says.
‘Remind me why I put up with you.’
Peter takes a few tentative steps forwards, then stops when he’s still just over an arm’s length away from the man, holding his hand out as if wanting to take hold of his arm. ‘I’m sorry, Wade.’
‘Aww Spidey you caught me. You do care!’ comes the annoying voice from the alley.
‘Huh,’ he muses. ‘That sounds like one of Clint’s arrows.’
‘Hence why he got in touch with me,’ Nick continues, ‘and we started putting our heads together to try and find a better solution.’
‘This is all what we’d have to build up gradually and would vary on each site,’ Nick agrees. ‘Some bases could be combat centres, others research, and even others focussing mainly on intelligence and each one would need a slight variation on protocol should the worst happen.’
Sam stands up, placing a comforting hand on the other man’s shoulder. ‘We’ll look for him the old fashioned way, Tony. Maybe he’s gone for a walk like you said and he just left his phone here. He’s fine.’
The noise seems to stop, or at least he can’t feel it vibrating through his entire body anymore, but his ears are still ringing. He tries shouting but, although he can feel the sound tearing at his throat, he can’t hear anything. He turns to look at Steve, and sees the black clad soldiers moving towards them.
‘Natasha,’ he grins. The pattern is so familiar because it’s their warm up.
‘And three,’ he counts softly, reaching a branch to cross to the other side of the path, ‘two,’ he scampers along it trying not to laugh, ‘one.’
‘What element did you make?’ Sam asks.
Instead of a verbal answer, Peter turns to look out of the window and nods.
‘I’m waiting, Stark,’ Sharon hisses at him.
‘I should like, Captain, to concede my prize to another. Clint was the only one able to catch me unawares and since he managed to trick the god of trickery I think he deserves the prize instead,’ he replies.
As an apology I give you two chapters this week! I hope you enjoy them, please do let me know what you think of them. I also promise to get up to date with responding to comments as well.
‘Oh good, I’m not sure I could have looked Bucky in the eye again if it’d been him,’ he breathes a sigh of relief.
‘Kid? What are you doing here?’
‘Just in case there’s any nasty surprises,’ she explains at his questioning glance.
‘Strangely enough yes I do mind you taking a look around my business premises when you have no reason to,’ Weasel says, ‘and when you’re in the merc business you tend to get twitchy when people turn up out of the blue asking questions.’
‘He took her somewhere she’d be accepted without question,’ Natasha says quietly, ‘which was exactly what she needed, especially after all the news reports that refer to her as a weapon of mass destruction.’
‘Except Tony,’ Sam laughs.
‘It wasn’t anything too bad, Mr Stark. I just had a difficult patrol and it took a few days to get my head around it.’
didn’t try and get some of that for yourself.’
‘Tony,’ Steve’s frustrated tone sounds near his ear and he stands up to steady him. ‘Will you
‘I do, but she still managed to catch me off guard. Plus I wasn’t really paying attention to them, since we were in, you know,
The Avengers and their allies ready to battle Thanos' army in Wakanda
‘Genuinely didn’t get to say anything before he took off,’ she laughs. ‘Come on, we need to get all of these boxes over to the common area.’
Peter nods. He’d heard all of these people mentioned when they were told about Captain America as part of learning the Second World War. He’d considered all of them, thinking his research would be easy enough to do – all he’d have to do is ask the Captain about them himself. But something just didn’t feel right about focussing on any of them. It felt like he should know them if he was going to be presenting them since they had been important to several members of the team.
‘I swear, Thor, if they don’t arrive to pick you up soon I shall get my Pegasus to take you there and you can freeze on the ride over the Atlantic.’
‘Hey, kid,’ Sam lands next to him as Bucky turns to face the trickster. ‘Let’s get you out of here.’
‘Yeah…’
As always here's your sneak peek at the next chapter:
‘Right. Sorry. Lead the way, Vis,’ she says, hurrying after the humanoid and felling another guard with a well-aimed shot.
Steve just laughs. ‘You make a good point, but I agree we should do this more often.’
‘I have no idea, Spiderling, there’s no point in looking at me,’ he answers the teenager.
‘No, it doesn’t.’
‘-no he wasn’t interested in
‘Hmm?’ Strange looks up from his book.
‘Shit you’ve been spending way too much time with Tony,’ Clint groans.
‘You alright, champ?’
He texts the man.
‘What about without the suit?’
this particular individual never made the list?’ Strange rolls his eyes.
‘There’s lots of them,’ he replies, ‘more monsters than you can count and the only goal they all have is to capture the prince and princess from their castle; you see the princess was supposed to be so beautiful that no one could ever hope to compare. She had long black hair that shone, and sparkling brown eyes and she had a laugh that could melt the meanest heart.’
that tree.’
remotely as well. This is the kind of stuff I would have killed for when I was first starting out.’ The inventor had done more than make moveable grenades, he’d fitted them with microphones and cameras so they could be used to gather information as well.
The children nod and climb back under their covers; Tony runs his fingers through Peter’s hair soothingly, and Steve does the same for Morgan. ‘Are there monsters in it?’ she asks.
‘What about my thoughts?’ he tries something else to try and distract her. ‘Can you read me at all?’
‘We should do it together,’ is the reply, as Gamora takes out her sword.
‘Like my head’s ready to explode,’ he grumbles.
They settle back down, with his head resting on Steve’s chest again, and Tony has to marvel at how happy he is to just lie in bed not doing anything. It doesn’t take his brain long to ruin his new-found peace by reminding him of the situation facing them. ‘Steve? Do you think we’re doing the right thing? Having Wade and Loki here I mean.’
be one to be telling Steve he’s gone too far in his parenting, but he has to trust in Pete’s decision. Not that I don’t agree with him, don’t get me wrong, but we can’t be causing division in the team right before we go up against HYDRA-’
‘Yeah, nothing that won’t be healed within the hour,’ he says, voice small as he holds up his hands for the man to inspect.
‘But you did,’ his voice is equally quiet, ‘you did and you’re still holding me at arm’s length. I
‘Because the comments from certain classmates are going to be bad enough when we get here, I don’t need to add any more fuel to the fire,’ Peter grumbles.
Tony laughs. ‘I’ll ask him to tone it down.’
‘It’s the first time we’ve been alone for any amount of time since you got back,’ Tony says, he’s not sure how his voice is staying so calm, ‘so I suppose I shouldn’t really be surprised we ended up having another argument should I?’
Rhodes doesn’t even have chance to add his view before they’re firing another round. They make quick work of the following three and, while FRIDAY calculates their scores, the three of them sit down to clean their weapons together. This is something Rhodes misses the most from his time in the military; the steady movements of cleaning the weapons relaxes him more than any therapy ever has, and the three of them talk and joke in soft voices as they work.
‘Oh do be quiet, and tell me where you keep your tea things. I need another mug if I have to deal with you when you’re injured and I’m sure you won’t be adverse to one either.’ It appears the lure of tea is enough to bring the doctor out of his grump and he explains to Loki where he keeps the items he requested, so by the time Wong joins them they are already drinking from a mug each and there’s enough in the pot left for the other man as he sits down.
‘Are you telling me, all the years you’ve spent around us, and you don’t know what Christmas is?’ Tony demands.
‘Outfits?’ Peter asks.
‘Thor, Peter already told you all of this before,’ Loki cuts across his brother as the blond opens his mouth to argue again, ‘can we
He shakes his head; he’s in his Jotun form now, and on his head is a crown of ice. Tony has to admit it suits him. ‘I don’t know. I’m worried that it has taken him so long.’
There’s a pause as Ross attempts to stare him down. Then the Secretary spins on his heel, flinging the pardon back in Natasha’s face, and storms off, gesturing for the soldiers to follow him.
Just how long did they have until Thanos arrived? Thor and Valkyrie had thought perhaps two weeks, maybe longer if they were lucky.
‘Merry Christmas Sam,’ Mama greets him. ‘I hope these two are behaving themselves.’
‘Why can’t you just float them over there?’ he asks Wanda.
‘Please don’t piss me off and make it three,’ he groans.
Hopefully I'll have another chapter to upload tomorrow. I'm literally uploading them as I finish writing now, which normally I hate doing.
‘Surprised she risked that considering the work she was going,’ Bucky muses.
‘Peter shouldn’t we-?’
Wanda and Vision are the first two to return, reassuring Thor that his people are settling into their rooms and will soon be eating. Tony’s made sure they can’t access any more of the facility other than the east wing guest quarters until he knows more of what’s going on. Eventually Peter and Bruce enter, the scientist looking especially tired as he rubs his eyes.
all that’s here apart from the kid,’ Rhodes says, fixing him with a firm look. ‘We can help.’
‘Thank you,’ he says. ‘I’m sorry.’
‘Clint? Laura?’
‘No one is going to agree to go to one. Least of all you,’ he points out.
Wanda looks to Loki and Strange, eyes wide, for help. ‘That’s because Wanda’s magic,’ Loki jumps in, ‘is more like my Jotun abilities: something innate to her. Perhaps you will have your own innate abilities that you will discover in time. I didn’t discover my Jotun abilities for centuries.’
‘It’s perfect,’ Bucky answers truthfully, ‘I can’t thank you enough.’
‘Can I just ask: how are you all able to resist punching him in his smarmy mouth?’ Clint asks.
‘On it,’ comes the man’s reply.
?’ Sam demands.
‘Wait.
dating life, let alone someone else’s. I mean, how do you explain to someone your nephew can bench press a car and not expect them to run for the hills?’
‘Hey Pete,’ Ned greets him as soon as he enters the school building with their secret handshake, ‘you finally ready to rejoin school like a normal person?’
‘We tried this before with the weapons,’ the other responds, ‘and look where it got us: on the Avengers’ radar and Spider-Man taking out Vulture.’
‘As part of the support or guest speakers?’ Bucky jokes. ‘Because I’m sure I could be either.’
‘My money’s on Tony, Loki and Drax: two with power and one with the tricks.’
‘You are welcome,’ he smiles at her. ‘Now what would you like for dinner?’
‘The old man’s getting tired,’ Bucky teases.
‘Then why do it at the beginning?’
‘P-Peter Parker,’ the kid takes Bucky’s hand, still sounding dazed.
‘Old habit, Baby Boy,’ his partner shrugs.
Loki curses. ‘It’s one of their war beasts. Take it down! A single one can decimate armies!’
‘Of course not,’ he replies with a smirk in Thor’s direction. ‘I turned him into a toad.’
Christmas decorations are found and Bucky has an interesting conversation with Thor
‘Yeah but you know I’m right,’ Tony grins at him, getting a small answering smile back. ‘I’ve got to go now, Pete, otherwise we’ll miss the flight and Cap’ll be going on about it for
‘Well we’ve got a couple of days where we need to get some actual work done,’ Tony laughs, ‘plus Pete needs to go to school at some point in December.’
‘Trust me I am far from ‘ok’ about this; but then I think I’d be the same no matter who he was interested in. I’d probably be freaking out if he found a mini-Steve to be interested in. But I’ve learned the kid is going to do whatever the hell he wants to, whether I’m ok with it or not. I’d rather respect his decisions so he’ll still come to me if something goes wrong.’
‘So before that…
‘Will do Tony.’
‘We’re doing this by the book then?’ she asks.
‘About an hour.’
A/N: Hi everyone! I hope you enjoyed this chapter - we're only two away from the end now. Thank you so much to everyone who is reading this story, and especially to those of you leaving comments. Please do let me know what you think, and if you have any requests for any other fairytales.
His teacher gives him a strange look. ‘You don’t know?’
‘Matthew Wills, sir.’
‘Guys, I think Bruce isn’t feeling right, he just said Wade can’t be that annoying,’ Peter looks to Natasha and Steve.
The Winter Soldier nods and puts his rifle to his shoulder. ‘We clear down this corridor, Scott?’
A/N: Hi everyone. So who was expecting that little turn of events? I had to throw in a curve ball from somewhere other than the shows and the films after all! Just to clear up for those who may not be aware: in the comics Vanessa is a shapeshifting mutant known as Copycat who Deadpool and the X-Men occasionally face and/or work with. For those die-hard comic fans I am not going to be sticking to comic story-lines because I don't know enough about them so please cut me some slack. I like finding out these things about the characters and finding my own way to work the principle into these stories.
‘Yeah she did,’ Steve admits, looking a little sheepish. ‘But I thought trying to get you back to doing normal things would do more good than having a bored Tony Stark; and hopefully you can stop terrorising the doctors and nurses. Besides,’ he grins at Tony as he hands the tablet over, ‘I thought if anyone could hide a tablet from some nurses it’d be our resident genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.’
Peter gives a wet laugh as he pulls away from the death grip hug he’s had on Tony. ‘But why can’t I go with you?’
Baby Boy, I thought you were hot before, but that was just plain
‘Peter! Never do that again!’ MJ screams at him.
He’s about to offer to help when his senses go off again and he’s ducking another punch, this one goes sailing over his head. ‘Bucky! No fair! And you were using your metal arm!’
‘Allow us,’ the Chinese representative adds, ‘to most sincerely apologise for the events of your return yesterday, Captain Rogers. We were most displeased to learn of the Secretary’s actions and can promise you that nothing like this will happen again.’
‘I just wanted to keep you alive, alright?’ the merc shouts back, clearly having lost patience.
‘Didn’t expect you to come and find me of all people,’ she says as Loki joins her.
of you alive. The other is dispensable.’
‘Uh, hi,’ Bruce says, pushing the door closed behind him. ‘I can come back if you’re busy?’
, I’m a mad
The team starts to help Tony, and there's more than a few revelations.
what to do after Christmas. He’s not leaving for certain, and you could be giving him another reason to stay.’
‘He does?’ Steve looks at his friend.
‘Could be,’ he says, voice cracking a little. He knows his face is bright red as the merc swings his face round to look at him, eyes of the mask wide. Steeling his nerves he takes a deep breath. ‘Please?’
‘It’s me Mr Hammer wants right?’ he says, ignoring his friend. ‘Then take me to him and don’t hurt anyone else here, alright?’
‘Yeah, yeah, whatever. Now go for a run or whatever crazy exercise it is you do in a morning. I need to finish this car.’
‘Wanda!’ Peter shouts amidst the girl’s laughter, but instead of trying to reach her he gives up and buries his head back in the pillow. ‘I hate you,’ comes the muffled sound.
look after himself; not to mention he’s got a good enough relationship with several members of the team, and his aunt and Happy, that I’m sure he’ll let
‘Tony you alright?’ Steve’s worried voice cuts across them. ‘What was that?’
Thank you so much to everyone who has left kudos on this story, for the comments on the last chapter (which I am going to reply to I promise), and for everyone who is still reading this.
Tony shakes his head. ‘I’m… if Ross is involved how many of the Council are too?’
‘Tony…why didn’t you try something with
‘Err not meaning to change the subject, baby boy, but my asshole senses are picking up something across the street. Two shady characters by the parked car in the alleyway,’ the man says, pointing across the street.
Bucky grinds his teeth, metal fist clenching, and then grits out. ‘What’s going on,
‘Regretting volunteering to head the catering department?’ Natasha laughs.
‘Shit,’ Steve hisses a curse as he misjudges it and tips the platform. Before they can go sliding too far, Peter jumps back, misjudging it and nearly falling off the edge into the mud.
‘I’ll be in touch,’ Tony replies with that same small smile Steve remembers from last night. ‘Take care both of you. All the medical bills are taken care of, you just focus on getting better. And remember: don’t mention this to
‘Wade Wilson get your arse in here and try these on,’ he throws a few pairs of suit trousers at the man and then goes to look at Steve’s shirts.
‘Yeah like that’s going to help him stay calm,’ he can practically hear the eye roll in Tony’s voice. There’s a brief pause before the inventor adds. ‘We went through what happened when I woke up in Afghanistan, before I became Iron Man.’ He turns his stool around and comes to make a few last adjustments. ‘I woke up with a magnet in the middle of my chest, and the knowledge that if it was removed the shrapnel that was trying to make its way to my heart would kill me.’ He hands Bucky a set of glasses. ‘Put these on, Barnes, it’ll project what we need to see into the room. There’s sensors in the arms that will latch onto the memory once you start it, if you need to stop at any time just take them off. We’ve got you in the chair simply because it’s a better height for Wanda and Vision to work at. Any questions?’
he can use.
‘Shit,’ Natasha curses, turning and downing the new arrival with a well aimed bite from her glove. Unfortunately the one behind him managed to run. ‘Guys I’ve been spotted. Carry on to the end of the corridor, turn right and you’ll be back by the vans. I’ve got to set the timers now.’
did you not notice that Beck was insane? And how did you fall for all that alternate reality crap he pulled?’
‘That’s the one,’ Tony says, aware of the obvious pride in his voice. ‘Stole Cap’s shield and managed to tie you up on his first day out with the team.’
Tony can’t stop the small smile that spreads across his face. He’s proud of the kid and how much he’s come through. ‘It’s difficult
‘Just reading over some of the information Strange brought with him,’ she replies, setting the tablet down on her table. ‘You alright?’
‘So am I, Pete,’ he says, finally looking back at him. Peter’s not sure who moves first, but Wade’s arms are around him and holding him tight against his hard chest, and he’s gripping the man’s hoodie in his hands, burying his nose in the soft material.
She grins, unable to stop herself. ‘A lot more.’ Then she adds more power to the sphere; where before the light had been twisting and turning like a pool of water, now it was swirling like a tornado, and still she pours more into it.
‘Are you telling me you’re dating
‘Please,’ Laura smiles as the two assassins start to catch up. ‘Luckily the kids slept most of the way, but it was still an early start for us.’
‘Come on,’ he says, tugging his friend along. ‘Sam’s going to come back and get us. We just need to keep out of-’ He stops with a grunt of pain as something sharp catches him in the neck. He puts a hand to his neck and pulls out a dart.
It seems Bucky’s discomfort is similar to his own, and not due to his lack of skill, as by the time Tony coaxes him halfway around the man is gliding fairly smoothly along the ice. Though he sees he keeps shooting glances at the exit near where Steve is sitting. As they come around to complete the lap Peter skates up alongside them.
‘Can we go yet?’ Wade growls, guns spinning in his hands.
Unfortunately the substance has worked quicker than either of them is expecting on the rest of the webs and the kid goes sprawling on the floor, rubbing his head and sitting up. ‘Ow, that hurt. Thanks for getting me out, Dr Banner!’
‘Nothing is happening to him if I can help it,’ Wade growls, eyes going unfocussed as he grips a fork tightly in his hand. ‘And if anyone thinks about hurting him I’ll stab them so many times the four distinct hole marks will be unnoticeable after I’m done with them, and them apart until even you won’t be able to work out how to put them back together.’
‘Alright change of plan,’ Natasha says, ‘you two go in as planned and shut it down. Blow up as much as you can so they can’t piece it back together. I’ll go in and get as much information from their systems as I can so we know what the hell it is we’re up against. And so we can see if this Ajax really
‘You alright, Tony?’ Natasha asks, sitting opposite him at his work station.
‘This just proves something,’ Peter says with a grin.
‘It also means not all of the information is stored in one place,’ Nick adds, ‘even though it could be accessed from every base, if one is compromised its ability to access information stored in the others is automatically shut down.’
Thank you as always to everyone who is sticking with this story, and big thanks to the people that are only just finding it and catching up in one go. We're getting close to the end now, which is a little surreal I'm not going to lie. And of course thank you so much to everyone who has left comments and kudos on this story. Your support is absolutely incredible and I love you all! I'm pretty sure I've been good this week and responded to everyone as well. Go me!
‘Oh you want me to talk about how the man who has basically been like a second father to me stabbed me in the back and tried to get me thrown out of the company, and quite possibly also ordered a hit on me? Or how about the fact that we’ve had to get rid of half the board because they were supporting him? Or the fact that they nearly killed a man trying to get what they wanted? Or how about the fact the company is about to bomb on the market because I’m about to announce we’re severely cutting our weapons production and I might cost potentially hundreds of my workers their jobs?’
‘Strange!’ she greets the newcomer with a smile. ‘Care to join us?’
’ Peter growls in warning.
Bucky reassures him.
‘A moment of your time, Wade?’ he says, just in time for the merc to pause exactly where he needs him.
(See the end of the chapter for
There’s a chorus of laughter from behind and Tony frowns at Steve. ‘Be careful or I’m sending your Christmas present back,’ he warns him.
‘Let Nebula and Gamora,’ Thor groans from his place next to Natasha. ‘They should be the ones to end it.’
‘I want to hear it from you,’ he whispers. ‘Come on, Spangles, you’re making me nervous. Let’s start with some of the easy stuff: is there anything I need to be worried about other than my hand and the reactor?’
if I’m honest. I’m off to bed. I’d appreciate you not telling anyone all of this, Barnes. I haven’t told anyone the full story, tends to make them feel bad and I hate it when people bring the pity party.’
‘You mean you’re in a relationship with one of
‘Perhaps I will, but only on one condition.’
Loki scowls. ‘If this is going to be another rerun of my past misdeeds then I’m not interested in continuing this discussion,’ and he picks up his book again to make his point.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘I was worried about you alright?’ is the hissed reply. ‘Considering who you helped take on to get Tony out, then you drop off the map? I disappear to Hell’s Kitchen for a couple of
‘Maybe I should take up acting,’ Bucky chuckles, looking from Hammer’s face to the device in his hand. Steve cautiously moves backwards towards the exit.
Wanda comes to his side and gives him a hug. ‘You don’t need to be scared today, Tony,’ she reassures him, ‘we’re all here with you.’
Steve had asked the most questions about that time, and it had led on to what had happened with the Mandarin, and how it had all ultimately led to Ultron. A whole night taken up on the events that led to one of the biggest mistakes in his life. By the end of it he was drained. But to see the understanding dawning in Steve’s eyes had helped ease some of his tension.
‘If you don’t move, Stark, I’ll have you arrested alongside Rogers.’
‘I’m fine,’ he protests, he’s not sure if he actually sounds a bit slurred or if it’s just the pounding in his head.
‘That looks like the Bifrost that Thor used to travel on,’ Steve takes a couple of steps along the picture and points at a multi-coloured patch. He looks over at Bucky. ‘Think we should get Loki’s opinion? It might give us a clue as to what the Jotuns are doing here.’
‘I’d rather he be in a secure facility where he can’t harm anyone,’ Ross retaliates.
‘We really do need to stop taking on entire armies when it’s just us,’ he points out, taking to the skies once again. ‘Anyone seen Thor?’
‘But I
(See the end of the chapter for
‘I suppose it’s you I have to thank for the other three labs then? Wondered how long it would take you to find your way here. Following my trail of breadcrumbs.’
’ Natasha demands and Bucky turns to see the webslinger webbing the monster’s face and then swinging up onto its back.
‘If someone tries to sell you spices don’t buy them,’ Clint tells him.
‘Can we take Betty and Harry to?’ he nods towards where his four friends are standing together.
‘Yes he is and he heard every word of that,’ comes the soldier’s voice from behind him.
‘Just make sure you do take time to become a team again afterwards,’ Hope warns, ‘or you may end up doing damage that can’t be repaired.’
‘Why would they come after you if you’re like a long-lost prince or something?’ Peter asks.
‘You are so lucky you can’t see that stare, because it is
‘I could have
‘I hate you,’ he goes back to hiding in Steve’s chest.
‘Peter,’ Tony pulls away and forces him to look at him, ‘there’s nothing
Peter, and even Wade, end up being pretty helpful and moving between all the new skaters and giving pointers and help where needed. Nebula takes to it like a duck to water, and she even goes to help Mantis.
,’ Bucky’s voice is close to shouting levels, and Wanda and Vision take a step back, looking between the two of them. It’s the first time they’ve come close to an argument the whole time the soldier’s been back. ‘Tell me how long we have left.’
Sometimes Natasha takes him for shooting practise, and there was one particular day when the two of them had a shooting competition with Bucky. Which was memorable to say the least.
‘You used to play with the Commandos?’ Steve’s surprised at this revelation. ‘You never mentioned it before.’
‘Please tell me there’s something more interesting happening soon,’ Clint mutters to him, ‘as much as I appreciate needing to remember and thank those that we lost, I genuinely can’t listen to another name today. We’ve been here for over two hours.’
Clint’s eyes light up. ‘I’m listening.’
Loki nods. ‘I think it would be unwise to leave them unchecked. Especially since the destruction of Asgard.’
‘Why don’t we move to next weekend?’ Ned suggests.
‘Done what?’ Rhodes demands.
‘I’d appreciate the help,’ Strange replies, looking to Natasha.
‘I wonder if we’ll get to meet the Falcon? He’s soooo dreamy.’
‘Not to my knowledge,’ Strange has a wry smile on his face, ‘but I can try mine first if you’d like to be safe.’
‘You have been spending way too much time with Tony,’ Bucky rolls his eyes. ‘Natasha’s done a brilliant job of teaching you how to use your speed and slighter build to your advantage because that’s how she fights; she’s taught you how to use your head to win a fight rather than your strength. The thing is Pete you
Peter sighs. ‘You didn’t take all his knives off him, did you?’
‘It’s an Italian isn’t it? I almost feel bad going to an Italian restaurant that Tony hasn’t recommended,’ she laughs.
The plane door opens and Wanda calmly walks down the stairs flanked by two soldiers. One of Ross’ stipulations. As soon as her feet hit the tarmac, however, she starts to run towards them, a bright smile on her face.
Peter smiles and hands her a box of baubles. ‘I think I like that tradition.’
Steve wonders what on earth he was about to hear. ‘Alright.’
you to
‘You facccce Thanossssss,’ Venom hisses.
Tony’s gut twists with guilt remembering the note he’d sent with EDITH.
‘Ah, ah, ah,’ Francis steps out in front of me, swiping at my neck. ‘Language, Wade, we wouldn’t want to upset any
‘And that is?’ he feels uncertainty clawing at his insides.
don’t want to be eating.’
Tony laughs at the look on Steve’s face. ‘Oh babe, seriously? How have you not realised this about those two? I’d worked it out when I first brought Wade here on Christmas Eve.’
‘Tony,’ Steve cuts across the two of them, shooting Rhodes a look to keep his mouth shut. ‘Rhodey’s just worried. We all are. Apart from him and Nat none of us even
‘Do you think you can get them all to the van?’ she asks them.
‘I can’t believe you talked me into this,’ Peter grumbles as he opens the door to Sister Margaret’s.
‘It is indeed,’ he replies, ‘in fact I can do two brands of magic: Asgardian and Jotun. Though some would argue that the Jotun one is not really magic, and more abilities inherent to the race.’
‘I got you a little something extra as well,’ she says, helping him slip the band Wanda had made him over his wrist.
‘I-I honestly didn’t expect that much,’ he admits. ‘Do you, uh, do you want me to leave?’
‘Just how much older are we talking?’
‘Yes and the staff need to clean up your mess, Tony,’ Pepper rolls her eyes. ‘Besides everyone’s about ready to drop, we can’t all keep up with the party-boy extraordinaire you know.’
sweaters?’ Tony asks.
The man raises an eyebrow. ‘The squad who have a member using the new prosthesis right? Why didn’t you come with the rest of them?’
Peter looks around the guests, his Stark Industries badge attached to the pocket of his jacket letting people know he can be approached for help. So far he’s only had to show people where the bathroom is and hunt down some drinks for a particularly obnoxious guy that Natasha had been dancing with earlier.
‘Oh don’t worry, Wade,’ Francis’ grin is predatory. ‘You’ll be too busy soon to worry about little old me.’
Natasha smirks at him. ‘Yeah I thought so. I’ll tell him you’ll meet him in an hour, that alright?’
‘Just a friend May,’ Peter groans, ‘please don’t start the Spanish Inquisition.’
‘I know,’ Peter sighs, ‘but everyone else is feeling the same way so I’m…just trying to hold it in until other people have had a turn?’
‘What I should have been doing for years,’ he admits, ‘and taking care of you. I know it’s selfish but I just want this last chance to do right by you, Tony, because as soon as we step out of this room I lose you to Pepper. I just want one last memory before I do.’
‘Go for it Point Break. We’ll give you all the time we can.’
‘Merry Christmas, Pete,’ Tony gives him a hug, and Peter feels a kiss pressed into his hair.
‘Tony? You ready sweetheart?’
‘I’m paying,’ Steve warns him as he comes round from behind his desk. ‘No arguments.’
‘Wow,’ he says when the man pulls away.
Peter looks up, surprised. ‘Uh, what?’
Tony laughs. ‘Oh yeah, she always used to give me the odd bit of advice on how to deal with people asking questions you didn’t want to answer. Being a woman in her line of work through the war and afterwards, she was well used to those kinds of questions. Best two pieces of advice she ever gave me: give them a diverting comment when you don’t want to answer them; and the right clothes can be just as good as a suit of armour.’
‘Mr Stark I am so so-’ Peter begins, tears forming in his eyes.
‘Fuck off.’
‘Just do it!’ he snaps, turning and impaling an attacker on the ice he forms on his limb, allowing his Jotun visage to fall back into place.
‘No there’s about three more,’ the teenager replies.
‘Do we have to? I was getting the hang of it,’ Peter whines, and Bucky laughs at the pout on the teen’s face.
Peter shakes it before turning around to face the kitchenette, realising he may have a problem. ‘Um… we do have bananas right? And ice cream?’
‘None of your business,’ Bucky snaps at him, glaring to drive his point home. Loki simply sighs and takes out the carton of orange juice, raising an eyebrow in challenge.
‘In answer to your question: yes, I have. No, it isn’t as much fun as it sounds,’ Wade replies.
‘What’s this?’ Natasha asks, taking the piece of paper.
‘FRIDAY make sure no one comes in, black out the windows to the workshop and notify me the
‘Let’s suit up people,’ Fury says.
‘He doesn’t really care about the law as such, Peter,’ Steve adds, ‘so the fact that he
‘I doubt I’ll see you when I’m there, so I’ll just have to say good luck and I’ll see you when everything is sorted with Beck.’
‘Tony what is wrong with you? We’re good friends.’
‘FRIDAY can you let me know if he doesn’t make it to bed in the next five minutes?’ Rhodes asks the AI.
‘Dude can I come meet him?’ Ned asks, passing his phone back.
‘We shall deal with the leader,’ Strange replies, ‘as he is going to be focussed on the stone. You deal with his bodyguard.’
‘In Norway?’ Peter raises an eyebrow.
‘Long story, Baby Boy,’ is the quick response, ‘I’ll tell you some other time. Now come on Frosty the Snowman, let’s get you on your feet, I haven’t got all day.’ Loki still looks wary so Wade huffs again. ‘Oh for fuck’s sake.’ He grabs hold of the man’s arms and helps him to stand. ‘There. That wasn’t too difficult was it?’
Rhodes laughs. ‘Why do you think Tony only ever appears in public done up like he’s just walked out of a designer shop, but around here he’s only ever in the same ratty jeans and band shirts?’
‘Will Vision come?’ she asks.
‘Aw man he heard me,’ the inventor winces as Steve appears in the door behind him.
‘Love you too, Petey Pie. Now let’s go take our presents upstairs.’
Ross lets out a sound that’s somewhere between a snarl and a scream. ‘One day, Stark. One day I’ll wipe that smug look off of your face.’
‘He got to us quicker!’
I hope you're still enjoying this story. Thank you so much to everyone who has reviewed, and to the people who have asked for a Christmas story. It will definitely be coming your way, keep an eye out Christmas Eve! The next questions with it will be: do you mind if there's a slight divergence from this story in that it will be established Stony? And do you want Deadpool to join in the Avengers' festivities?
‘Remember that one year we found a branch on the street that had fallen off a tree so we took that back to yours and used that as a tree?’ Bucky laughs, slinging an arm over the blond’s shoulders.
‘Go ahead, sweetheart,’ he says to the person under me, ‘show him.’
‘What is it?’ Clint asks, eyeing the glass as if it’s about to grow legs.
‘Hey doc do you think you could take a look at this?’ Peter waves the screen. ‘So you know how people use tourniquets to stop bleeding and stuff? Do you think if we somehow managed to tourniquet the area of Vision that’s damaged we could stop the stone from interfering with Wanda’s attempts to heal him?’
‘So I’ll be like undercover?’ he asks.
And now, kiddies, we make lots of noise. The guns all start firing at once, almost like they were on a timer or some shit. Almost like this is a story and it was done for dramatic effect.
‘He’s an insufferable know-it-all-’ Tony holds up one finger.
point, let alone the next turn,’ Sam asks, sounding more like he’s been sitting through one of Tony and Bruce’s ‘science-bro’ conversations, as the team has named them, rather than a dance lesson.
‘Your choice,’ Rumlow says, taking his safety off. ‘You have until I count to three. One.’
‘Ok,’ she says, getting comfortable. ‘Every week we’d take it in turns to pick what to watch from the suitcase of films that my father would try to sell on. It was how we learnt English.’
this, Wade.’
‘I’d just take that as a yes, Spangles,’ Tony laughs, ‘I’m sure we’ll find some time to hang out in the lab around training.’
‘I used to make them when I was little,’ she explains, looking a little sheepish. ‘I just thought-’ He cuts her off by bringing her into a tight hug. He doesn’t need her to say she used to make them with her brother, he can work that out by himself. It might have been one of the simplest gifts he’d received this year, but it definitely meant the most.
‘Do we want to know?’ Steve asks, looking between the two youngest team members.
The laugh that escapes Deadpool’s mouth makes him pause. ‘Oh yeah, good one, Spider-Man. Maybe you should ask your buddy the Winter Soldier just how easy it is to escape from Hydra.’ He takes a deep breath and sighs. ‘I said I’m sorry, alright? I panicked and I went on instinct. In the past that’s the only option I’ve had because I’ve always worked alone. I’m not like you, Spider-Man, I didn’t have people backing me up, giving me snazzy gear and that would come and find me if something happened to me. Most of the people I knew thought I was dead when I got my abilities. It’s always been me, myself and I. So if my methods don’t match up with yours I’m sorry but that’s just the way it’s always been.’
‘I think we may have to rearrange our gallery plans,’ she jokes when he finally returns. ‘Though we definitely need to go eat.’
‘It’s amazing to finally meet you,’ Betty grins.
Wanda shrugs. ‘You could look at it that way I suppose,’ she muses, ‘but they don’t treat me that way and, except for the first time when I didn’t know what to expect, I’ve never felt like it either. I just look at it as another part to my training. It’s easy to stretch the limits of your control when it’s just you and someone you trust in the room, but add the pressure of showing people who are reporting on it, and suddenly you see just what you are actually capable of doing.’
‘Damn you!’ Wade laughs. ‘Just you wait until tomorrow when I’m in full challenge mode and you’ll regret this!’
Steve laughs quietly as he listens to Tony’s side of the conversation. He’s still not sure how he feels about all this, but for now he’ll just go with the flow. He’ll never admit it, but he’s really missed Tony.
‘We will not be cowed by a second rate being such as-’ whatever she was going to say is cut off by the largest axe Tony has ever seen flying into her, and taking her head clean off. The axe goes flying backwards, very reminiscent of Mjolnir, and into Thor’s outstretched hand.
‘I didn’t mean to this time, Pete, I
‘As if,’ Bucky scoffs. ‘Anyone heard from Fury?’
‘We simply had a disagreement, nothing more.’
entertaining.’
She looks back at Vision’s colourless form, then up to Tony, and back to Strange. Wanda closes her eyes and takes a deep breath, and when she opens them again her face is determined, her eyes alight with power. ‘Alright. I’ll do it. Bring me the gauntlet.’
‘Are you insane? They don’t have a clue who you are. Miss Potts invited your firm because of the work you do. I haven’t even told them I
‘I remember Cap’s,’ Tony tries to defend himself.
A/N: Merry Christmas Eve! There's one more chapter to come tonight :)
She laughs. ‘No, I wanted the Dick van Dyke show.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Bucky nods. ‘Yeah,’ his voice is hoarse as he replies. ‘Yeah he did. He probably didn’t tell you he still has nightmares of when I nearly shot him after Zemo got to me did he?’
‘Your ability to phase means that you can avoid harm from the attacks. None of the others have the same ability.’
‘Well I’m concentrating on not standing on your toes any more than I have already,’ he huffs.
‘Do the others?’
‘Alright everyone, settle down,’ the teacher cuts off Peter’s retort as he enters the classroom. Flash and Peter take their seats, both frowning at the other. Peter only breaks their staring contest when Ned elbows him in the side and he turns back to face the front.
‘What are you doing, Pete?’ Wade asks, hands going to rest on Peter’s hips.
‘Of course, Vis,’ she replies, brushing a strand of hair out of her eyes. They’re down in the training rooms practising with her powers; the others had left around an hour ago and if she’s honest Wanda is trying to distract herself from her worry that Peter hadn’t wanted any company yet. ‘What’s wrong?’
‘Of course I am, May,’ he says as he says goodbye to Ned and walks to his room, only half listening to what his aunt’s saying. ‘Spider-Man gets grounded for not doing his homework,’ he mutters to himself as he gets out his suit. ‘If that ever happens Sergeant Barnes is never finding out. I’ll never hear the end of it.’
‘You can’t-’
find someone who will help us to defeat Thanos, but we will have to be careful how we do it. We don’t want word getting back to him after all.’
Wade groans in frustration. ‘I know, Cap, I know it’s just…if I’m wrong I’ll have just been a paranoid bastard about it and made a fuss over nothing.’
‘Fourteen million, six hundred and five.’
‘Maybe,’ she replies, looking back down at her tablet.
‘I’m just testing all the bullshit that comes out of your mouth, Stark. Strangely enough I don’t trust your judgement when it comes to the rest of the team. If you ask me you were almost
Wade’s been making a point of helping to clear up as much as possible, not wanting any of the team to not think he was grateful for being included. Before Tony leaves to follow Steve he grabs the man’s arm and asks for a quick word.
‘Clint asked me to bring this out, apparently he’d promised refills but then remembered he had to go get something for Cooper,’ Bucky says, handing him a glass filled with what Loki suspects is Tony’s best whiskey that the archer always manages to get access to. No matter what steps the inventor takes.
‘You can do magic as well can’t you Mr-sorry I mean Doctor Strange?’ Cooper asks.
‘Reconnaissance then help me get it and return it to your facility if it is what I think it is.’
‘I thought you weren’t supposed to be upsetting me, Cap,’ Tony smirks, ‘and in order to do that I think you need to get up on this bed so I can use you as a pillow until my next babysitter turns up.’
‘Yeah, new kid, I am,’ Flash turns his attention to Harry. ‘And if you want my advice on getting by in this school-’
‘Ten bucks says he chose you,’ Bucky grins at Steve. Trying not to smirk Steve shakes his hand.
‘What? Tony what are you talking about?’
Between the three of them they manage to make it most of the way back to the entrance before they run into trouble.
‘She was a teacher.’
‘They want to meet the man who has successfully had one of their new implants, and the whole squad has been invited to discuss a proposition according to this letter. We’re to meet Tony Stark himself tomorrow at two. So make sure you don’t go anywhere tomorrow, we want to be early. Understood?’
‘How much popcorn do you think we should do?’ Tony asks, opening the cupboard that Steve is sure is filled only with popcorn boxes ready for these film nights.
,’ Wade says, turning pleading eyes on him. Peter sighs but nods, gesturing for the man to continue. ‘Look I know I’ve been making comments about your arse in spandex and all that, but I’m not about to start something like this with someone who is underage alright? I just… I do have
Peter looks down, not able to keep Tony’s worried gaze. ‘Alright.’
‘He’s just scared you’ll be so much better than him and he won’t be able to keep up,’ Natasha tells her, turning her back to the teenager and winking at Wanda. She tries to keep her face neutral and she nods through Peter’s spluttered denials.
‘If by influential you mean by terrifying them into thinking you were going to lead another invasion of Earth, brother, then indeed you have,’ Thor chuckles.
‘Knew it! Sam owes me twenty bucks.’ At his questioning eyebrow she laughs and explains. ‘Sam said you just watched Steve’s ass and never looked away, I said there was something else to it but he didn’t believe me so we made a bet.’
Peter leans around his teacher and takes out his pass from his pocket, handing it through the window to the guard. ‘Will this do?’
‘I give up,’ Peter sinks to sit on the ground. ‘Shall I go see if anyone else can come and help or shall we try and do it ourselves?’
‘He’s saved the kid’s life,’ he replies. ‘And it seems he’s been around Peter quite a bit recently. The last time I tried to do things on his behalf I ended up making things worse for him, so this time I’m going to trust his judgement.’ He fixes Peter with a strong look. ‘The
‘You are working way too hard, Baby Boy,’ the man chuckles as Peter sighs, ducking out from under the merc’s hands and quickly looking around the lab to make sure none of his classmates are around. ‘You’re also way more paranoid than normal. Isn’t that usually Widow’s job?’
‘Then is it-’
‘Who’s that?’ the warrior asks as he takes a seat on the bed next to him, pointing at the ice figure in his hand.
‘Hey the more the merrier,’ the scientist replies. ‘I just hope you aren’t as good as Peter.’
‘Yeah, not happening,’ Tony says. ‘You’re not getting me, and you’re definitely not getting him.’
‘Very well I shall help however I can,’ Vision responds. ‘I must also admit to some curiosity as to these new found abilities of yours.’
Peter pulls his aunt into a tight hug, trying to hold back some of his tears before he started sobbing. ‘Thank you. I love you May.’
‘Come on let’s get going,’ Steve says, giving Peter a worried look before leading the way to the car. Bucky takes his bag, lightly squeezing his shoulder with his hand, before nudging him along, his arm never once leaving its place around him.
‘I don’t know,’ he admits, eyes scanning every car he can see; he reaches into his pocket for his phone to give Sam a call. He knows what’s coming before it happens but he can’t stop it without being too fast for a normal kid. As the boys come closer he nudges Ned out the way and takes the full force of the shove from both of the boys; he doesn’t catch himself, falling to the floor and wincing at the pain in his knees and hands.
‘Of course, Mr Stark,’ a man responds, from his accent Steve thinks he’s German. ‘We shall be discussing this incident with Secretary Ross ourselves.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony dazedly looks in and pulls out a piece of paper, an envelope, and a small, very battered looking teddy bear. He’s just opening the envelope when Wanda and Sharon return. The former agent looks pale.
‘Peter what are you
‘If you’re about to ask why I would care about you getting shoved to the floor I’m going to question Tony’s assessment of your intellect,’ Bucky warns.
‘It’s for your own good,’ Rhodes shouts after him. ‘And you’re still not going to make my suit dance!’
Peter just shakes his head as Ned continues to talk excitedly about how the team had actually talked to him, properly, in front of the whole school. His phone goes off with a message and he looks down, a smile creeping onto his face as he reads the message.
Belinda looks like a rabbit caught in headlights for a couple of moments, before she just nods and scurries out of the room.
‘In her letter she told me to find someone to make them with like the two of us used to,’ he admits.
‘Umm…. Yeah?’ Ned answers.
Valkyrie puts her hand on Nebula’s shoulder. ‘I am the last of the Valkyries; all the others were killed by Hela during our battle to contain her. My lover was killed protecting me. Ever since then I wandered around the galaxy, not wanting to put down roots anywhere because it was too painful to consider losing it all again. So I lost myself to drink and put up walls and pushed away the memories of any companionship I’d had with my battle-sisters and my lover.’
‘Do you promise me to take me to bed afterwards? Because I may just stay down here on purpose if that’s the case.’
‘It’s not
‘I’ll finish with this skate then meet you out there,’ he replies, waving the two dark haired men on. He figures Tony needs a bit of time to get Bucky comfortable before dealing with another person who has a fear of ice.
‘Well I’m dating a robot so it’s not exactly a
‘Trust me, Deadpool is
to ask you on a date at least once, Spidey.’
‘Like three hours, and I really don’t want Bucky to come in and find me like this because then I’m never going to hear the end of it, and if Tony finds out he might be mad that I’ve been working on the shooters when I didn’t run it by him first and-’
Thank you so much to all of you for the love and support you've shown this series and this story. Please, please do let me know what you think of these last two chapters and I will be responding to those reviews I haven't already as soon as I've posted this.
The three of them burst out laughing. ‘I just want to get Bucky in a tutu,’ Peter sniggers.
So maybe the merc wasn’t
Casting a look around him as he reaches the street he heaves a heavier sigh than he would have normally done in public. God he was going to be glad when everyone was back. As he turns to go to his car he notices something at the bus stop across the road. Or rather
‘Why are you giving it to me?’ she asks, looking down at the weapon that fits perfectly into her smaller hands.
‘Maybe, but I think it’s more than just that, Nick. I think he actually
‘Good to see you too, Loki,’ Peter laughs, and he knows from the wink and the grin the trickster has missed him just as much. Sam and Rhodes walk in behind him with Thor and he’s still saying hello properly to the three of them when a pair of arms wrap around his waist and he’s lifted into the air. ‘Bucky! Put me down!’
‘Anything you want to tell me? About school?’
he shoots back, with Loki relaying the message. The whole team laughs and a little more of the tension leaves everyone.
‘Earth had three stones before and it was manageable,’ the Jotun king replies. ‘But I do not think we should test it by adding more.’
‘Why? You tired already old man? I can keep going,’ Peter taunts.
Peter is so engrossed in his newest ideas he wouldn’t have noticed Wade sneaking up behind him until the merc covered his eyes if it weren’t for his spidey-senses.
‘What are you talking about?’ Natasha looks between them.
Hope you enjoy the rest of the story!
So all that's left to do is sign off and leave you with the sneak peek.
‘Alright,’ Strange agrees, ‘we’ll face this Agatha, the rest of you deal with everyone else.’
‘At this point I don’t think they’re any more likely to listen to me than they are you, Pete, but I’ll try,’ Steve sighs.
‘I’m fine, I jumped clear,’ Peter responds. ‘Where’s Bucky?’
Tony glances up at Steve, seeing the soldier has heard the report on his own comms unit. ‘You think it’s him?’
‘You mean you don’t want to get covered in this fantastic shade?’ he asks, holding up a tube of bright pink dust.
‘Shall we go get a film going for when the others get back?’ she suggests. ‘I think I’d rather sleep up in the common area tonight, we can get everything set up so we can all sleep up there. What do you think?’
‘Thanks, Harry,’ he says as they weave between the tables, ‘you didn’t have to do that you know. Making an enemy of Flash isn’t going to make your life here smooth sailing.’
‘You want to tell me what the detention was all about?’
He’s not sure how long he’s on the rooftop when he hears footsteps behind him. He doesn’t need to turn to see who it is.
‘Please remember to breathe,’ Strange interrupts with a raised eyebrow, ‘I dread to think what the Black Widow would do to me should you run out of air and collapse in my library.’
It doesn’t take long to get the situation under control. Tony’s especially proud considering it’s the first time they’ve had a situation since Wanda’s been back and for Peter working with them since Germany.
There’s a rare genuine smile on her face as she looks at him. ‘You’ve grown up quite a bit these last few years, Peter. You shouldn’t be so surprised we trust you.’
‘Good to see you too, Shuri, now you are banned from my workshop for your stay,’ Tony grins at her.
‘Vision?’ he asks, suddenly realising his senses were not going to be as much help in this fight.
‘Get him to help Peter with his homework then.’
Natasha doesn’t look happy with the plan. ‘Are you sure you can do this?’
‘Did you use the “on your left” line?’ Rhodey asks him.
‘Yes thank you General,’ T’Challa rolls his eyes as Shuri snickers at the two of them.
So this chapter took a lot of research into what happened in the comics with the Commandos, but it was actually a lot of fun to do. In the comics Monty becomes Union Jack, and Peggy Carter and Gabe Jones have one of the first inter-racial relationships to be portrayed in comics; since I'm not having Steve go back in time to be with Peggy (spoiler! but I'm sure you guessed that anyway) I actually really liked the idea of having that relationship for her instead. I'd be interested to hear if you guys would like to see the conversation between Tony, Steve and Bucky about the Commandos, either as a special or in one of the main instalments.
Peter’s senses ramp the danger level from five to eleven. ‘Mr Stark!’ Just as he tries to warn him soldiers start to storm the school grounds, soldiers dressed all in black with what seems like a familiar sigil on their uniforms.
‘Thanks. I, um…do we have to go up now? I’m not sure I want to face everyone again just yet after that tantrum.’
well indeed. ‘Wade what are you doing? If you think I’m going to stand here and have an argument over this you’ve got another-mph!’
‘Bucky…be careful.’
‘Let me handle this,’ Natasha winks at him and takes Steve aside.
‘It might be something to consider,’ Wong says to Strange. ‘With the Ancient One gone we still have no Sorcerer Supreme, and our numbers are still low after Kaecilius’ attack; I am not sure what Mordo has planned either, but I do not think he’s a friend of Kamar-Taj at present.’
‘Really?’ Steve rolls his eyes.
‘Apologies. One of my babysitters decided to check we were behaving ourselves,’ he taps his forehead.
‘Miss Maximoff can you tell what Justin Hammer is thinking throughout the trial?’
‘Most people would say they’re the same person, Tony,’ Steve sighs.
‘I take it you’ve had some not so friendly ones then?’ Steve asks as he deals out the cards for the three of them.
‘I can try,’ Sam says with a wry smile, and then the two of them lapse into silence.
‘Scott’s here?’ Tony frowns. ‘Alright tell them we’ll be up in a minute. Come on, kid, let’s get you out your mad scientist gear. Try not to eat him.’
‘Well why don’t you tell him-’
‘Guys? We got more incoming and these things aren’t going to be easy,’ Rhodey says. They turn to look at the barrier and see circular contraptions barrelling towards the army. They’re crushing their own forces but it doesn’t look like they particularly care. It was as Proxima Midnight said: they had blood to spare.
‘You have a
‘Oh really?’ Wade chuckles.
‘Alright,’ MJ appears back next to their table with three bowls in her hands. ‘These are for you, we’ve put one ice-cream and one sorbet in each bowl for you,’ she explains putting two in front of Loki.
‘I’m not happy,’ Natasha says, looking at Thor, ‘but seeing as you two have changed your minds I’ll give him a chance.
‘Thank you for your help today, Vision,’ Loki says, returning to his Asgardian form, ‘I do appreciate it.’
Hope you all had a great new year!
‘Peter!’ Wanda screams, running towards the boy’s maskless, prone body. She reaches him first and pushes him onto his back, muttering in what Steve assumes is Sokovian as he finally catches up.
‘Huh, I think I prefer the legend,’ Peter shrugs.
‘You’d be the next obvious choice after Peter,’ Strange tells Scott. ‘And you’ll be much better use here at the flag where you can provide hidden backup.’
‘I believe the quote was,’ Val looks down at her notes, ‘ah yes here it is. “No one would be exempt from the registration, even if they are someone’s precious intern and think they may have protection from other individuals.” He then went on to say-’
‘So, what I need you to do,’ he says, ‘is slowly make your way towards me until we’ve got the platform titled as far as it’ll go, then you need to jump back as fast as you can to flip me up towards the bars, run up and jump and I’ll swing you over to the end of the bars.’
‘I would ask for you to take it,’ T’Challa looks at Ororo, ‘but if something were to go wrong and you were attacked we do not yet have safeguards in place to be informed.’
‘You called
‘I can be useful!’ Clint protests.
‘Lorena?’ Loki turns to his second-in-command.
‘Any news?’ he asks as he takes a seat on the sofa next to Sam.
Peter and Wanda bond, and Steve makes a confession to Tony.
‘I can’t tell you what to do, Nat, you need to make that decision for yourself. You need to decide if it’s worth risking your heart over again. Do I think he’s going to disappear again? I have no idea. I’d like to think not, but we don’t know what’s coming in the future and what might set him off again; he left to keep everyone safe from himself, we know that even if we don’t agree with it. I wish I could tell you he’s never going to think about upping and leaving us ever again, but I can’t so I won’t-’
He nods, and he sees Natasha rub her temples. ‘Deadpool and… and Daredevil.’
Loki sighs, looks down the table to make sure that Thor isn’t going to overhear them and then turns back to her. ‘It’s not that I don’t enjoy Yule,’ he answers her unasked question, ‘but I always got pulled into the more ceremonial side of things and didn’t always get the chance to take part in the celebrations that I wanted to. So for me, memories of Yule are also tied up with memories of duties performed.’
‘Since when was he actually good at doing stuff?’ he grumbles to himself.
Natasha rolls her eyes at Steve’s muttered ‘Language.’ Tony turns to leave but Peter scrambles to his feet.
‘I hope you weren’t the one to start this,’ Steve raises an eyebrow at the god.
‘Oh for the love of…’ Peter aims a punch at Matt’s head, which the other man dodges expertly, rapping him on the shoulder with his cane for good measure. ‘Believe him now?’
‘Good. See you in the morning, Wilson.’ Then he does something that has the mercenary blinking back tears: he pulls him into a brief hug, before rejoining his boyfriend and heading towards their room.
‘So we need three teams,’ Strange looks at the gathered group. ‘Loki do you think you could mask Nebula entering the facility?’
‘Apart from a couple of bruises,’ comes the groaned response, ‘I’m alright.’
‘Me?’ the inventor asks, stepping forwards. ‘How can I help?’
‘I said you’re actions were wise not that you were,’ he adds as he walks past them.
‘I thought you didn’t approve of using the Time Stone on such matters? Considering you nearly took my head off when I experimented on an
Peter squeezes back. ‘Promise.’
‘You’re the stupid one, Wade,’ he reminds him. ‘I’m getting your arse out of trouble more often than not.’ Then he curses as there’s a crash in the classroom next door. ‘Pool
‘Ok we’re ready,’ Bruce says, and the group peels away from Vision who is able to stand up, although he leans heavily on Peter. ‘We better move fast, I’m not sure how long he’ll stay stable for.’
‘Thank you,’ is his reply, with a big, clear smile.
holding back and hiding all the time, so when I’m here it’s just such a
‘Steve I can-’
Steve chuckles and opens his eyes, smiling up at him. ‘If there is one thing you are never doing, Tony Stark, it is
‘Call for help,’ she says to a woman standing not far from her as she tries to lift the load higher, looking around she spies the park they passed only a few minutes ago and starts to lift it over there. Vision appears next to her. ‘Can you make sure there’s a free space for me to drop this?’ she asks him.
‘No one asked your opinion,’ Peter huffs.
A/N: Hello everyone. Sorry I'm a little late this weekend - I genuinely lost track of what day it was! We're starting to gain more momentum with this story now, and things will really start heating up next chapter (as you'll see in the sneak peek).
‘I shall do the rounds,’ Loki sighs. ‘Just please tell me Strange didn’t get given any.’
‘You ready Katniss?’
The Headmaster looks as if he is going to interrupt, obviously not happy with the question, but Peter doesn’t hesitate. ‘Absolutely,’ his voice is steady, ‘the only reason you’d have to be scared of the Winter Soldier is if you tried to hurt someone innocent. More so if you hurt someone he cares about. I’ve never had reason to be scared of Sergeant Barnes, and I don’t think I ever will.’
I duck down behind one of the SUVs that were parked here when we arrived, letting the idiots use up their ammo. Then there’s a break in the firing.
‘On what exactly?’ Rhodes asks as he joins them at the sofa.
‘Same as always,’ he grinds out, ‘just waiting to die.’
get more of Tony’s spontaneity?’
They’ve come up with several strategies for when Thanos attacks, including sites to hold a battle should it come to that; though no one has breached the subject of what they should do if Thanos were to obtain all the Infinity Stones, and Tony doesn’t really want to be the one to broach that subject.
‘Why us?’ he asks, feeling everyone at the table tense.
It’s Rhodes who saves him. ‘Because he had every intention of getting rid of it. This house isn’t exactly filled with happy memories for Tony. Haven’t you noticed how everywhere he’s lived since has been the exact opposite of this place?’
‘Why? You want him to wait in the queue at the bar instead of you?’ Sam asks.
‘You surprised me,’ the humanoid responds, ‘your web caught one of the weights and pulled it into my back before I realised what was happening and was able to phase to avoid it.’
‘Thanks a bunch, Rhodey,’ Tony rolls his eyes.
‘I know I certainly enjoyed watching you wield that axe, definitely doesn’t beat you working in the workshop though.’
‘-and then you take your partner’s hand and-’
‘Sensible,’ Strange nods. ‘Do you know where in Norway they were?’
‘Well…that was kind of anti-climatic,’ Tony says. Wanda makes a sound that’s half sob and half laugh, and he reaches out to steady her. ‘Alright you two I’m getting you back up to Shuri. Get that stone
He hadn’t been allowed to meet them when they landed back on American soil. He knows it was Ross’ doing but he lets the man have his small victory. It’s enough for him to know that Scott and Clint are back with their families.
Natasha raises an eyebrow at him. ‘Have you looked in a mirror this morning?’
‘His way of paying for my silence and tolerance.’
They flood through the single panel and as they do Steve and T’Challa take off running towards them.
‘A tried and tested hangover cure,’ Loki explains.
(See the end of the chapter for
There’s silence for a couple of seconds then Tony bursts out laughing, tears streaming down his face. The rest of the table joining in, even Vision managing a chuckle.
‘But there is more than that. Look to your mind.’
the hot water isn’t working?’
‘Pete you’ve done this a couple of times why don’t you do the demonstration with me seeing as Bucky is being mean?’ Steve asks, a smile in his direction.
‘Because we’d have to kill you,’ she responds with a wink.
‘But I thought that all went-’
‘Don’t tell me you’re a Scrooge,’ Sam points a mocking-stern finger at him, ‘or you won’t last long in this place over Christmas.’
‘Tony,’ Rhodes growls.
they’re in trouble.
‘That all of them?’ he calls through.
‘Who are you?’ Bucky demands.
‘I missed you,’ he says, reaching up to kiss him.
Tony struggles to keep his mind focussed, because seeing Captain America in nothing but swim trunks laughing with his friend is doing strange things to his stomach.
Natasha smirks. ‘Wouldn’t have anything to do with the view it offers of those two idiots would it?’ She japs a thumb over her shoulder at the two soldiers, who are both too busy sparring to pay much attention to their conversation.
‘Thank you, sir, though you may have to wait until after the ceremony. At the moment I feel like I may faint half way through.’ Bucky laughs behind him and Steve digs an elbow into the soldier’s gut, earning himself a groan.
Steve swallows and takes a deep breath. ‘Would you like to go on a date with me, Tony? I’d like to take you to Giacomo’s if you want to go for dinner?’
‘Err…. Not to seem rude but what is the old lady doing?’ Wade asks.
‘Dude slow down I’m not as fast as you!’ his friend shouts from behind him. They pause long enough at the lockers for them to get the rest of their stuff for the weekend.
Tony turns slightly to watch his approach and huffs a laugh. ‘Just needed a break from people.’
and a man more than ten years older than him.’
‘Hmm this is true.’
‘Am I ok? I haven’t had this much fun in months!’ the archer responds and runs back into the fight. As he takes down another two guards Natasha catches sight of Bucky. Seeing the Winter Soldier in action is something both beautiful and terrifying; he moves with all the grace that she remembers being instilled in her during her time in the Red Room, but the brutal way he cuts down the enemy, stepping over bodies as if they were nothing, sends a shiver down even her spine. She remembers having to fight him before, and is thinking HYDRA might be regretting training this particular soldier.
‘Medical have given him the all clear,’ the soldier reports.
‘It’s very true,’ Bucky whispers, taking the tissue and wiping his eyes.
‘There’s been a lot of…adversity, to the suggestion of HYDRA being involved in trying to control the team,’ Steve answers.
turned seventeen, is going out with a thirty year old mercenary?’ Rhodes demands.
‘I’m here, Tony, I’m here. Just hang on, alright? Strange is going to try and help, and we’re getting a portal ready, T’Challa’s sent for Shuri, she’ll be able to help you. Just hang on a little longer alright?’
She checks to make sure the cars in front and behind, carrying the rest of the team, are both moving before she settles back down to respond. ‘Just…I can’t shake the feeling that HYDRA is more aware of what’s happening than we’ve given them credit for. It feels…I can’t explain it, just a feeling that someone’s watching, and I can’t work out where from.’
fills me with confidence-’
‘Why would I get angry?’
‘Well you know the bi-annual charity gala that Stark Industries usually holds for emergency service personnel? It’s coming up in a month’s time and you’re supposed to be there.’
‘Where’s your bag, Parker?’ Flash’s voice breaks through his happy fog. ‘Or you trying to make us think you’ve got actual proper rooms up at the facility rather than just a bunk like the rest of the staff?’
of trees to cut down; Tony’s got FRIDAY on standby with drones to come pick up each tree as we cut it down so you’ve got to choose at
Ororo nods, she has a kind face and Peter hopes Wanda might find a friend in her. ‘My tribe sees it as a blessing bestowed by the gods, and a sign of rulership. A bit old -fashioned in my opinion, but who am I to argue too much? As long as it doesn’t stop us from moving forwards of course.’
‘It’s not Peter boss, it’s-’
‘If I’d known he was going to be this much of a menace I never would have suggested it,’ Tony groans from where he’s sat at the breakfast bar, purposefully not under the mistletoe but within reach of anyone who does find themselves underneath it.
‘Bucky they’re nearly here,’ Wanda’s whispers, voice scared.
‘-and you’ve found something
‘In some ways he is a different man, Captain,’ T’Challa says quietly, then starts to walk back inside. ‘Losing your family is a very difficult thing,’ he says over his shoulder. ‘To have lost them twice is a pain I cannot begin to imagine.’
‘I have the Space Stone,’ Thor replies.
‘She’s beautiful,’ the dark haired man comments, carefully taking the figure and looking at it. ‘She looks kind too, though I’m not sure I’d want to cross her.’
A/N: Hi everyone! Thought I'd start the new story with a double update, so I hope you enjoy. Please let me know what you think so far.
wishing I’d brought my shield.’
‘Nothing gets past you does it, Mama?’ he smiles and relaxes back into the sofa. ‘I’m just glad to be home.’
‘Don’t call me that,’ Loki snaps, ‘and explain yourself.’
Tony shakes his head. ‘Bath’s fine.’
‘It’s Peter, boss,’ the AI responds.
‘I bet it felt a bit like we didn’t really care about you wanting to keep Spider-Man a secret right?’ Sam offers from the breakfast bar. ‘And we’re sorry about that, kid, we didn’t mean for it to come across like that. We genuinely thought that you’d find it easier to do that with people you knew, and we should have realised that it’d actually make it more difficult.’
Peter looks like he’d rather the ground swallowed him, but he takes a deep breath and walks up to the microphone; his eyes skim the crowd and Steve sees the moment he catches sight of Tony sat next to May. The boy’s eyes widen a little and then there’s a small smile on his face, followed by an easing of his shoulders.
‘Mr Wilson? Miss Maximoff would like me to tell you that if you call her abilities ‘freaky mind powers’ again she will make it so you cannot speak for an entire twenty-four hours,’ FRIDAY’s voice intrudes into their moment. ‘She also wants me to tell you to stop panicking, Mr Parker, and to stop overthinking. For one thing you are giving her a headache, and for another she wants to remind you no one is going to slip up outside of the private rooms. She’d also like you to know that you are thinking louder than the boss does, and she would like some sleep at some point tonight.’
‘No offense but how is ballet supposed to help you?’ he asks.
‘Hey why don’t I show you a few tricks?’ the teenager suggests, skating backwards in front of them.
‘Stand down,’ Bucky says, getting out his own and pointing it at Andrew.
‘How do you know I was going to say anything?’ he counters.
‘I’m happy being the taster thank you,’ he replies and sits on a bench at the counter next to Bucky. ‘Are you not helping?’
‘Boss? Peter and May Parker have just entered the gates,’ FRIDAY says.
be with him.’
‘Just who did you speak to from Stark Industries Stevie, and how?’
‘Still annoyed you don’t get brain freeze,’ Peter grumbles.
‘Due to the fact that you’ve managed to fuck up the surgery that was trusted to you and have been successfully slowly killing him?’ Tony Stark demands, turning an intensely burning gaze on the nurse, who shrinks back at the force of it. ‘You,’ he turns round and jabs a finger into Doctor Blane’s chest, ‘get the fuck out. You don’t come near this patient again. Do I make myself clear?’
‘Right…thank you,’ Steve says, trying to take all the information that’s just been delivered in the most bored tone he thinks he’s ever heard come out of someone’s mouth. He heads back towards the elevators and pushes the call button.
‘Tony I know I don’t have any right to ask but-’ Bucky pauses and, for the first time ever, Tony sees him fidget. ‘Can we go and visit your parents? Their graves I mean, I… I’d like to say I’m sorry in person before I have to go back.’
‘Thor I told you to leave me alone,’ Loki snaps, trying to get his brother to move without touching him and injuring him.
‘Of course,’ he tells her, ‘you came and helped us during our time of need, of course we would offer you a place to call yours should you ever wish it. And it shall always be waiting for you. I shall ask my mother to make all the arrangements after I have left.’
‘Alright Karen start recording ready to send to the police,’ Peter whispers.
‘We already have our Avengers team, why do you think we need them?’ another man adds.
His all time favourite training session though, was when Steve decided he needed to work on using his spidey senses.
me right from the beginning, we might not have been in this mess.’
out of here. Then the two potential targets are out of the way.’
‘I thought I’d save myself the money on replacements.’
‘Our first greatest threat came from Earth and we’re still trying to get rid of it,’ he points out, ‘our second came from outer space. You really think we shouldn’t have
‘I understand now why he did it,’ Loki continues as if he hasn’t heard Bucky’s words, ‘the way we were raising the wolf it was never going to be fully under control and fully trained, and he didn’t get enough exercise so would have become destructive. But at the time I was devastated, and so was Thor. I blamed Sif for what had happened and was furious with him for telling her our secret, but he of course defended her saying she’d obviously done what she thought was best, however misguided. I’m not sure I ever fully forgave her what happened to Fenris, and it took me a long time to trust Thor not to share any secrets again. It was the last time we ever had a true secret between the two of us. I suppose that’s why it’s still my favourite hunt.’
‘Alright, alright. Fucking hell you got your panties in a twist. Need some help getting the spandex out of that tight arse?’
‘Oh and in case you were thinking of tearing it up? That’s actually a copy, the original is back at the facility with Rhodey. I think the President kept an original copy as well,’ Tony shrugs. ‘Can’t be too careful these days. Paperwork does have a tendency to go missing.’
He looks up at his friend, his face set. ‘Let’s get out of here, Buck.’
Nebula brings her tankard up to toast and the two women drink together in a quiet, companionable silence.
Tony laughs, the first real laugh since all this started. ‘Yeah, yeah he is.’
Bucky fixes Tony with his eyes and the inventor can’t quite place the emotion behind them. ‘How long do we have left, Tony?’
Bucky feels a little of the tension leave his body as he heaves out a sigh. ‘Yeah but I didn’t exactly make it better.’
‘We’re nearly half-way done. Give me a little longer,’ she replies.
‘Don’t see why not,’ she shrugs.
‘Oh don’t give me that political bullshit. Yes he’ll live longer than a normal human, but he’s still going to die before it’ll make any difference to your political marriage. And I’m not saying
‘I can’t tell you about the future, Peter,’ Tony answers him, ‘I can’t tell you what’s going to happen in your relationship years down the line. What I can tell you is I know that man loves you.
‘What? Not you too! Come on, Steve, I literally just helped
‘This is August Magnusson,’ Tony gestures to the man stood next to him, ‘he’s leading on this dig. He’s going to take us to see this interesting graffiti.’
Wade bursts out laughing. ‘Please tell me someone has video evidence of that!’
‘You…you’re welcome. Now go on, soldier, get out of here.’
Tony sighs and leads the lawyer back to the group, leaving the team to their discussions. Rhodes falls into step beside him. ‘What’s on the agenda for today then?’
'Hey Steve,' she smiles at him.
Loki reminds him.
‘Just be glad you aren’t with those two,’ he points at Peter and Wade who are currently bickering over something to do with how races should be conducted on ice rinks.
‘Unfortunately,’ Steve heaves a long suffering sigh, ‘he’s usually right as well.’
Tony sighs and faces the teen again. ‘Why are you set on defending him, Peter?’
don’t drink this early in the morning,’ Tony grumbles. ‘Alright guys come on! We’ve got decorations to make!’
‘Oh come on they’re no worse than Steve and Tony used to be,’ Natasha grins at the two of them as she passes.
Please please do let me know what you thought, I do love hearing everyone's opinions on things. Also please do let me know if you have any requests for fairytales for me to take on, or any pairings. I'm wanting this series to be a bit more of a challenge for me with different pairings so let me know if there's any you want to see.
‘Thank you.’ Loki turns back to the Jotuns. ‘We also need to inform you of the impending threat of the Titan Thanos. Jotunheim may need to go to war in a matter of weeks, or the universe could fall.’
‘The guy was going to unmask me and sell us both to someone from Hydra,’ he finishes his story. ‘Karen was getting Droney’s stun dart ready but Deadpool didn’t know that. He shot the guy holding me before he could take my mask off. I,’ Peter looks down, ‘I wasn’t particularly grateful because he’d killed the guy. I ran off and left him there. That’s why I was so distracted with my school work,’ he glances up at Tony, then back down at the floor again. ‘But I saw him the other day on a patrol and we talked it out. He said he was sorry but he was trying to help me.’ There’s quiet in the room. Tony continues to study Peter’s bent head, while the other three exchange looks.
?’ Bucky shouts.
? Fucking
‘Still don’t get why you let me go. It’s not like we’ve never worked together on stuff before,’ Peter’s frowning at Wade, arms crossed.
‘You two,’ Tony says as he makes his way over, three drinks in his hand, ‘are looking far too maudlin for a party.’
‘You didn’t manage it last time Wade, did you? You…’ Francis trails off, frowning as he obviously thinks something through. ‘Shit. You bastard you managed to work out how to cross the barriers didn’t you?’ He cuts himself off with a laugh. ‘You may have killed me somewhere else, Wade, but here you weren’t quite so good I’m afraid. And besides,’ he nods at Bucky as he finally manages to get around the crates and head towards Wade in the centre of the room, ‘you might walk through this, but he can’t.’
‘She didn’t, she got the list of invitations together and got other people to send them out.’
‘Yes.  But there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures. It will take time, brother.’
Steve runs a hand up and down his back. ‘I understand, and I think you made the right decision Tony.’
‘I wouldn’t count on it,’ Wanda’s sing-song voice laughs at him.
‘Because your healing means you
The team gets a warning from a friend, and Tony gets a call from someone from his past.
‘Well we were going to be here for the next year if we waited for someone to talk sense into those two morons,’ she says with a small smile, winking at him.
Wanda growls in frustration, brushing a stray piece of hair out of her eyes and glaring into the blast containment chamber.
‘Wanda get him back to the facility,’ Tony tells her, ‘when you get there get someone to come help. Wong you alright to stay?’
‘Peter? What are you doing? Who are you calling?’ Ned asks as they continue to run. Peter can see more soldiers surrounding the school and urges his friends towards a staircase as the phone rings.
‘That’s his third. Apparently I still need to let him have more because we have to face more department stores.’
‘Bucky and I’ll go lend a hand to the officers getting everyone under control,’ Steve says, lifting his shield as Bucky grabs some non-lethal weapons under his friend’s watchful eye.
Peter rolls his eyes. ‘As long as they’re alive.’
‘What do you want Deadpool?’
‘Would it not make more sense for me to be at Kamar-Taj to recover?’
Steve blushes, making Tony laugh. ‘You know what I mean.’
‘Tell you what,’ Tony is surprised how steady his voice sounds. ‘You two continue to have your little debate session, me and Elsa here are going to have a quick drink and then we’ll be back. Alright? Everyone take five. Come on Elsa.’
‘Fine,’ he mock-huffs, holding his hands up in surrender. ‘You do realise she’ll get to the bottom of it eventually though right?’
He puts a hand to his chest. ‘I’m hurt. Genuinely hurt.’
‘So you arrived early,’ Loki raises an eyebrow at the wizard, having not forgiven him yet for their last meeting.
‘And no one feels like dealing with a bitchy Tony Stark right now,’ Hope says as she scrolls on her Stark Pad.
Then Bucky turns to look at him, and he knows from the look in the man’s eyes he’s only going to accept the truth. And he’s going to know if Peter’s hiding something. ‘Alright, Peter I spent enough time before the war looking after Steve when he was getting picked on to know what was happening back there. Does that kid do it often?’
‘Honestly, Mr Stark? Still a little overwhelmed, but I’ll be fine.’
‘Oh come on!’ Peter feels the need to defend himself. ‘The scars are
‘The right
‘But we couldn’t carry on the way we were either; we weren’t in control of what was happening, we weren’t in control of the damage we were causing. We were at our best place when we had SHIELD at our back, but even that wasn’t safe from corruption.’
‘Shouldn’t have trusted me with getting the drinks then,’ Tony shrugs with an unapologetic grin. ‘But I must admit I’m still impressed you beat both Bucky
Thank you again and big love!
‘Me neither,’ he says, kissing Tony once more before leading them through the doors.
Vision isn’t entirely sure what happens in the next few moments, he’s so happy it clouds everything that follows. All he knows is there’s a ring on Wanda’s finger now and they walk through the park hand in hand, and this time when he steals a brief kiss from her he knows one day she’s going to be something more.
to see you sit down I just let it all out.’
‘Everyone else was killed,’ Wanda reminds her, voice breaking.
‘Representatives from fourteen UN countries,’ he replies, furiously typing away on his phone. ‘Majority of them are pretty reasonable; they’ve been willing to find middle ground with me. Ross is the primary antagonist in the group, but I imagine he’s been put on the naughty step after his stunt yesterday. They’ll be wanting to show you that they’re willing to work with us.’
‘Do I want to know?’ he asks, then cuts himself off with a laugh as Wanda levitates over his cake, seventeen candles burning on the top. The whole thing is decorated like his Spider-Man suit. The team start singing and he can’t help the huge grin on his face.
teaching him,’ Steve argues.
that had been his saviour.
‘Wade what
‘Back to the house at Long Island.’
‘And?’
‘I know, that’s what worries me,’ he laughs against the older man’s chest. ‘And just…no more heroics alright?’
‘Just how many secrets am I going to end up having to keep for you?’ he asks, raising an eyebrow, but there’s a smile on his face which tells Peter he doesn’t mind really.
Steve desperately tries to hold back the acrid, burning taste in his throat as Bucky finishes his story. ‘So you know who it is? The person Tony is interested in?’
‘No way!’ Bucky gaps. ‘You’re kidding me?’
‘I’ll come too, Mama,’ Tony smiles and the four of them head to the kitchen.
The trickster doesn’t reply, instead walking over to Tony and starting up a conversation with him and T’Challa. Bucky tries to squash the glimmer of hope that has sparked in his chest, but fails miserably.
‘I know, and I will, just not yet,’ he promises her. ‘He’s still recovering from everything with Venom, and he’s got to get used to the idea of living here and May moving away. Not to mention Thanos. I think it’d just be a bit too much to add this as well.’
‘No, Bruce, what part of today has been alright? The questioning from Hammer’s asshole lawyer implying I’ve cheated on Steve with Bucky? The fact our relationship has now been revealed to the public through the bastard’s trial? That we haven’t heard from Happy or Wade
‘And we’re back to the Accords. Of course we are.’
having you ruin our shot at getting the attention of the main weapons supplier of the US Army. Do I make myself clear Rogers?’
‘The first is that if you want this then we do it properly this time and we don’t hide away. I’m not ashamed of us, Steve, I never have been. I don’t care about any bullshit you might try and say about it maybe making dynamics in the team weird, we go public and to hell with-’
Peter feels his heart breaking. ‘But Wade…’ he struggles to find the words he wants, ‘why would I find you disgusting?’
Ross’ voice continues the sequence that Tony is surprised hasn’t made its way into his own nightmares yet. He hears a grunt of pain from Bucky through the link.
‘That’s the reason I signed up to the programme,’ Wade continues, looking at the wall to the side rather than at him, even so Peter can read the vulnerability in the man’s frame. ‘I got diagnosed with cancer, well,
Deadpool gives a harsh laugh. ‘Oh don’t be sorry, Spider-Man. It was my own fucking fault. I should have known not to leave the cocksucker alive. I should have made sure they didn’t follow me home. I should have protected her better. I’m as much to blame for her death as the guy who pulled the fucking trigger.’ He pauses before heaving another sigh and look up, straight ahead over the city rather than at the boy sat next to him. ‘When that guy had the gun to your head I couldn’t just stand there and let someone else die because of me. I know I’d promised you not to kill anyone, but all I could see was Vanessa’s body and you joining her. I couldn’t be the reason someone else died.’
A/N: Hi everyone. See I promised I'd be on time this week! Hope you enjoy this chapter, I'm so sorry I still haven't responded to everyone's comments yet. I promise faithfully I will do it before it comes time to post next week.

‘They must be to have this kind of reaction from you,’ he tries again. ‘Come on, Wade, if they’re looking for information on me too I need to know what to keep an eye out for.’
‘Now the rest of Christmas can get started,’ Wanda says quietly to him.
‘No it tastes exactly the same. Plus it’s
‘I don’t know why you’re complaining, it’s not like you wouldn’t have healed within five minutes.’
After Peter had gone home Tony finds himself being dragged down to the facility’s pool by Sam, Steve, Bucky and Natasha. Sam complaining he needs another ‘normal’ person there for when Bucky and Steve start racing.
‘Hmm,’ Steve continues to check him for injuries. ‘How’s your stomach?’
‘What the hell was that?’ Natasha demands, sitting up from where she’s landed not that far from Scott.
They’re interrupted by a tall blonde woman, looking very apologetic. ‘I’m really sorry to interrupt,’ she says looking at Peter. ‘I was wondering if you could help my friend? He needs to go to the bathroom but will need help finding it. He’s blind.’
‘A little before eight,’ he replies, glancing at the bedside clock. ‘I wonder if Wanda and Peter are up yet after the movie marathon they made us have last night.’
what you come out with? Not “holy fuck what fire farted over your face?” You look at my
‘Yeah your mother hen started right then, I was trying not to laugh the whole time we were watching him, you looked like you were torn between shitting yourself and running after him.’ Bucky laughs as Steve takes a swipe at him.
Motherfucker. Now I can’t see.

‘Just go, Tones! We’ll be fine,’ Rhodes waves him off.
‘T’Challa where is the best spot to fight this battle?’ Steve asks him.
Loki’s smile is warm. ‘I would not have minded the conversation. As pleased as I was to spend the time with Thor and to work to bring our kingdoms towards unity…’
Matt shrugs. ‘Your heart rate didn’t increase, which tells me you aren’t lying. Now why didn’t you tell them you’d met me?’
‘Thanks,’ he nods, ‘that makes sense. I’m just…worried about people getting suspicious if I keep running off, I guess.’
‘Right,’ Fury sighs, downing his glass, ‘excuse me whilst I go save what is left of my reputation.’
‘Didn’t see you doing anything useful, birdbrain,’ the dark haired man counters.
‘Steve’s following something up from the HYDRA documents,’ she explains, ‘and honestly? Pete needs training with someone who can match him with strength, and you
‘Of course,’ she says as if the answer was obvious. ‘But it won’t be where they are being held.’
Peter decides to speak to a couple of his own contacts as the search for Tony starts to slow.
‘Yes I agree it has been enjoyable so far,’ Drax nods. ‘I am looking forwards to experiencing more.’
Her question is cut off by Dr Higgs entering the room, her expression is grim but she manages to give them a tight smile. ‘I’ve done all I can without having any in-depth records of what to expect from his physiology. His signs are good and I’m hopeful he will make a good recovery; how quickly or how fully still remains to be seen.’
Peter’s still trying to control his shaking.
Tony holds Sam’s eye, seeing if he can get any clues from the other man’s expression. ‘What makes you say that?’
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve chuckles. ‘Probably because you think you’re smarter than they are, Tony.’
‘Hey Pete!’ Sam greets him. ‘How was the first day back at school?’
‘Need I remind you that I
Steve can hear some of the others arriving, and breathes a sigh of relief that they’re not alone any more. A sigh that turns into a scream when Thanos, clutching the shoulder of the suit, then reaches forwards and grabs hold of the arc reactor in Tony’s chest.
‘Since when have you given a damn about Bucky?’
Rhodes gives a strained smile. ‘Just you wait till you meet him outside of the battlefield, he’s even more of a talker. But he’s a good kid. We’ve managed to keep his identity away from Ross so far. But as soon as he becomes an Avenger that’ll all be gone. Tony’s making sure he at least gets to finish college, since he turned down the offer the last time.’
But if Peter was right no matter what they’d done there was no way they’d have been able to control Ultron. He would always have turned against them.
Tony feels warm. As his brain slowly regains normal function he also realises something else: he feels rested. Blinking he lets his eyes adjust to the dim morning light, it must be just after dawn, and then frowns as the world moves up and down in a steady rhythm.
‘I just do not want you to feel that I’m taking advantage of you,’ Thor tries to placate her.
‘I’ll message Wade and get him to join us here once they’ve finished clearing up and debriefing with Fury,’ Steve’s voice is quiet and strained.
‘How did Pepper cope with you when you planned SI events?’ Natasha demands.
much trouble; and it might solve Brucie’s problem with the Hulk not wanting to come out.’
‘Of course,’ Bucky smiles softly and they continue along the corridor.
‘For being the god of trickery you’re about as subtle as a brick,’ Peter grumbles, but leaves the group to go stand with Vision. ‘You alright, Vis?’
He looks at his partner and sees the same realisation on his face.
to I suppose,’ he breaks off with a laugh. ‘You know, Widow, you managed to help me after I left Earth. You were so determined to wipe out the sins of your past, when I finally broke free completely from Thanos’ control I suppose it was comforting to know there was someone who had also done terrible things, but had found a way to atone. I should thank you for enabling me to be standing here right now.’
‘Well this is going to be fun,’ Wade mumbles, pressing a quick kiss to Peter’s cheek. ‘I love you,’ he mumbles in his ear, ‘I’m sorry I didn’t tell you before.’
Peter’s gone bright red to the roots of his hair and he hides his face in his hands. ‘I can’t believe this is happening.’
‘I got to admit, Cap,’ Sam pipes up, ‘this is sounding crazy. And I’m used to hearing the stuff that comes out of Tony’s mouth now.’
‘Really? Petey-Pie? That’s not staying.’
‘Don’t ask,’ Peter sighs.
‘Check the wall to your right, Cap,’ Peter cuts in, ‘according to the scans from your suit it looks like there’s a space behind it.’
‘Do we want to know how you managed that?’ Steve asks.
‘Do I ever?’ Foggy grumbles as Peter follows Matt across the room to his office. Once there he tells him everything that happened.
‘Ah yes, the infamous Black Widow. I’ve learned all about you since I last saw you Miss Romanov, very interesting.’ As Hammer continues to talk Tony taps some commands into his watch to get FRIDAY on to locating him. ‘And I see you’ve met my new friend Scott as well. How’s the face Scotty?’
‘You know if you don’t make an appearance soon Thor is literally going to come and break your door down right?’ Bucky says as he closes the door behind him.
Wanda works on improving her control of her power; and the team gets called into a hostage situation with a familiar face.
‘I’ll pay you back,’ Scott promises. ‘I just had to get here and Ralph couldn’t fly me the whole way.’
‘Peter!’ Ned shouts as Peter’s knees go from under him.
‘Can you please stop talking as if I am not present?’ Loki grumbles.
‘How long you been awake?’ he asks her, forcing himself to a seating position and leaning back against the stone wall that forms the back wall of their cells. He shuffles along towards her as she answers.
‘Why do you think he’s moving now? He’s known the Mind and Time Stones have been on Earth for years, not to mention that we’ve had the Tesseract on Asgard; he’s obviously known the location of the Reality Stone for a while since it was left with the Collector, and it wasn’t exactly a secret where the Power Stone was after the tale of Ronan’s defeat swept the galaxy. If he wasn’t interested in obtaining all of them he would have been picking them up one by one as he learned of their locations.’
‘This is the mead we can share-’
Peter shrugs. ‘Maybe.’
‘For you information, dear Valkyrie, that leaves me five away from completing the challenge.’
‘See you in a minute, losers,’ MJ waves as she goes into her room.
Wanda fights back the despair. She has no idea what the Scarlet Witch is, but she can see the panic in Strange’s eyes and just prays they’ve done enough.
‘Just get Captain Rogers to speak to him,’ Loki opens a book and goes back to reading. ‘He’ll get Tony to change his mind.’
The force of his own stupidity hits him so hard that he misses a kick to his stomach that sends him stumbling backwards with a grunt.
‘Come on, Pep,’ Rhodes soothes the woman. ‘You know we all care about Tony, it’s just the stubborn jackass won’t let us show him half the time.’
‘You know he actually admitted to me he was really nervous to meet you that first time. He also admitted he acted like the world’s biggest asshole because of it; and he was a little hurt when you weren’t exactly his biggest fan to begin with. Somehow, and I have no idea how, but he managed to put all his past feelings aside and decided to give you a clean slate. Now that’s not something Tony
He pulls away before his thoughts become too dangerous and takes a small step back. Bucky clears his throat, eyes unsure though his face remains fairly blank. Tellingly he’s also keeping their mental link firmly closed, not that Loki can blame him since he’s doing the same.
When Wade looks back at him, he can’t tear his eyes away from the brown ones looking back at him and his chest feels tight, like he can’t breathe. ‘Yeah, well… I just…’ he sighs and, taking a deep breath, starts again. ‘Even before coming here you were the most important person in my life, Baby Boy, and now after this last week I’m thinking that if you weren’t in it that it’d be just one long shit show after eating fifty gone off vindaloo. And I know I’m not exactly Prince fucking Charming; I mean I look like someone hate fucked an Egyptian mummy, my job isn’t exactly shit free, and my personality leaves something to be desired but-’ Wade’s eyes skim over his face, making him wonder if he’s looking for courage to carry on or a reason to shut up. ‘Well I guess what I’m trying to say, not so eloquently, is: if you’ll have me Baby Boy I’d have your back outside of patrols as well as in and, well, want to go grab some tacos some time?’
‘Strange? Strange!’ he calls out as he continues to follow the Cloak; eventually he reaches a smaller room where he sees the doctor slumped in a comfortable, high back chair. The man gives a groan as he enters. ‘Strange? What happened? Are you injured?’
As always here is your sneak peek:
‘Don’t suppose you have any of those suits from Norway on you, do you?’ Steve shouts over the rush of the wind.
‘Like Zemo did before,’ Wanda says quietly.
‘I don’t know,’ he admits, standing in front of the stairs and doing his best to block out Bucky’s moaning at Steve’s perfect timing of being an idiot. ‘But I have a feeling I can guess,’ he growls as Ross moves in front of the soldiers.
Tony sighs, finally opening his eyes and rubbing them with one hand as he sits forward. ‘I promise I’m not hiding anything, Rhodey. It was just a particularly difficult meeting with the committee this afternoon; Ross didn’t like some of the things that I said in a press conference and I’ve spent from around three this afternoon arguing with a roomful of people.’
‘I mean I literally had five seconds to take it in before the next bombshell hit, so I’m sorry my brain didn’t start thinking of other possibilities when I’m trying to process the fact that Tony Stark is now your legal guardian.’ Harry tilts his head in thought. ‘Although thinking about it, when you came out as bi to me and we were talking about different guys you did always go for the broad-shouldered type like-’
‘Congratulations, Vis,’ he grins, pulling the humanoid into a hug. ‘Just how nervous were you?’
‘Well I’ve got to think of something to do for a history project as well,’ he answers. ‘It’s not a homework task exactly, but we’ve got to have an idea to propose to our teacher for our next lesson.’
‘Oh you’re not much use to us dead, Anthony,’ Hammer explains, waving for the guards to drag Tony to his feet. ‘You’re much more use to us as a bargaining chip. Here’s the thing: that reactor in your chest? Not actually yours. It’s one left over from when my friend Ivan was here.’
lets anyone ride shotgun with him.
‘Alright,’ he says, though doesn’t look convinced. ‘You’re only going to be away for a few days tops though right?’
‘Thank you,’ he croaks, taking deep calming breaths as the soldier continues to rub warm circles on his back. He hates that he’s trembling from sheer tiredness.
‘Because…because we didn’t think of it?’ Bruce cringes.
‘We managed it.’
There’s an uneasy quiet again in the room and Peter looks up from his model. ‘Do you really think they would have come back if there were?’ Tony argues.
As the group begins to break off into different groups, talking softly together or going to do last minute adjustments to gifts Loki settles back into his chair with a satisfied smirk on his face.
‘Tony!’
‘All in a day’s work Baby Boy,’ the man replies with a bow, sweeping up his katana as he straightens. ‘Now how about we blow this joint and go get some chimichangas?’
‘You may regret that my dear Captain.’ He sees the tablet in Steve’s hands and raises an eyebrow. ‘Any particular reason you decided to steal my tablet? Did you break yours again?’
‘Why don’t you go to the kitchen Tony? You’re not going to be happy with anything the rest of us prepare anyway,’ Steve all but picks the inventor up from his spot on the couch next to Peter and pushes him towards the kitchen.
‘Seriously?’
‘Hi,’ Peter looks down at the young girl tugging on his sleeve, ‘I’m Cassie, my Dad’s Ant-Man. Are you really Spider-Man?’
‘Are you trying to convince me it’ll all be alright or both of us?’ he asks.
‘How did he manage to miss the fact he was talking to Tony Stark?’
‘I don’t know,’ he trails off as he notices a man in a white suit with glasses stood at the entrance to their school. The man seems to spot him at the same time and comes over to them, a smile on his face that sends shivers down Peter’s spine. His senses are screaming danger, but he can’t leave his friends alone.
, Natasha thinks as Rhodey and Sam come to join them,
‘You…no…I should be the king…’ Lautenus grunts, ‘our father always preferred me…I was to carry on his…’
Through all of it Tony hasn’t said a word, no one in the room has. Peter suddenly realises that at some point in his tirade they’ve ended up sitting on one of the sofas, and the tears have been falling down his face and soaking Tony’s shirt. The man runs a soothing hand up and down his back and Peter suddenly feels like the sixteen year old boy he is. Not a super-hero, not an honorary Avenger, not someone whose best friends with a mercenary with stupid healing abilities, not a kid who’s lucky enough to have an internship with Stark Industries: he’s just a teenager from Queen’s who’s reached his limit with people at school and letting himself be comforted by his father figure.
‘Sure thing Sergeant Barnes,’ Peter says, letting his webs lower him down until he’s on the same eye level as Bucky. ‘Until the next time you try and wind me up.’
‘Not in the mood,’ he says.
Clint grins at him. ‘As Tony would say: “sneaky spy shit”.’ Then he sobers again. ‘She won’t go back to something with him, though, I know that for certain. She…’ he seems to struggle to find the right words, ‘she threatened his conditioning, and when they were separated they started to realise she wasn’t quite the true Black Widow they’d trained her to be.’
‘Yeah,’ the archer replies. ‘As much as I love being here with you guys, if the world’s going to end I’d rather spend as much time with my family as possible before it does.’
‘I have not! Other people dropped them
A/N: Hi everyone. This is the last week of the December double updates I'm afraid, so head on over to see the next chapter. Hope you're still enjoying the story!
Sam notices Peter frowning, his head titled to one side as if he’s listening to something. ‘Hey, kid. What’s up?’
‘This…this is the place I grew up,’ Tony forces himself to release his death grip on the controls in front of him, sagging in defeat into his chair. ‘This is the family home in Long Island.’
Bucky shakes his head with a sigh. ‘Not yet, no.’
Peter frowns. ‘What are you talking about?’
‘Take care of yourself, Stephen, we’re just getting used to you. I’d hate for it all to go to waste.’
‘Me too!’ Peter adds. ‘Can we get pepperoni?’
Peter blushes, but knowing he’s not going to be able to change the merc’s mind just nods. ‘Fine,’ he pouts, ‘but just so you know, when you get frustrated at taking it slow I’m reminding you this is all
‘Even
‘I…I’m alright I guess? I mean…Shuri says she’s going to get started on Vision as soon as we’ve all left, but that it’s going to take her a long time because she wants to make sure she’s doing everything properly. It could….it could take a while, and it might not work but…’
‘That makes more sense,’ Nebula says, thanking Natasha as she stands up. The red head pulls the other woman to her feet and helps guide her over towards the entrance of the rink.
