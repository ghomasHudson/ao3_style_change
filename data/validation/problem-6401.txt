Instead, Steve raises his sunglasses so they rest against his forehead and there they are. Those eyes. Those thrice damned blue eyes. Tony’s not an artist, not by a long shot, but he wants to draw those eyes. He wants to immortalize them in charcoal and oil paint just the way they are in this moment, all fire and heat for such cool eyes, the flecks of green burning like embers in a dying flame. He wants to scratch them out with his bare hands.
"Do you want me to beg for you, is that it? Is that what gets you hard? Having a man at your mercy?" The words tumbled forth from Steve's mouth unbidden, and gods was he prepared to beg.
“Ooh,” AJ said as he flipped his page for everyone to see. “I’m getting huge duality of man vibes. I’m assuming the left side is how you think other people view you?”
A bright blue hologram appeared over the center of their table. Steve stands up and starts to circle it. He could practically see the wheels behind Steve's head turning, formulating a strategy from the bottom up.
,” and any desire he had dies. He should nip this in the bud now. They are absolutely not having a repeat performance.
"Brooke is one of the strongest kingdoms in the realm. People envy her wealth and prosperity, and for that, they will try to destroy her. We cannot afford to be weak," his father had told him when the war with Ma'Hat had first started. Five years ago, in what was supposed to be peaceful trade talks, the king of Ma'Hat had Brooke's envoys slit at the throat like cattle, and they had been embroiled in war ever since.
Steve lets go of Tony’s hand and reaches for Tony’s cock. Tony throws his head back against the pillows as Steve’s big hand encompasses him, his hips rising up in time with Steve’s thrusts. Soon, Tony’s fucking himself into the tight circle of Steve’s fist.
A muscle in Steve's jaw works. It's not the answer the other man wanted, but it's the only answer Tony's going to give him. He can take it or leave it.
“You don’t get to drop in unannounced and say you’re just checking in. You lost that right, Rogers,” Tony spits. “You lost it when you decided that your will was more important than that of 117 fucking countries.”
Comments, kudos, and bookmarks aren't necessary but they're much appreciated. Thank you to everyone that is still continuing to read 💖💖
Tony wants to bring up his dream, he wants Steve to reassure him that he'd never hurt him that they're friends and teammates, and they—
JARVIS hesitated before saying, “Of course, Captain Rogers. But only if you agree to seek out help.”
He crept up the stairs slowly, not wanting to startle Tony. It was strangely silent as he made his way to the workshop, the stairs creaking with each step. Usually Tony had some rock song or another blaring as he worked. Honestly, sometimes Steve was amazed that the man wasn’t deaf. The windows of the workshop were completely blacked out.
Steve paused in the middle of his chambers and turned to fixate on Bucky. His friend, and he was questioning the validity of that term at the moment, sat at Steve’s table where he took meals when he didn’t feel bothered to attend family dinners. His head was bowed, his shoulders shrinking in on themselves. He looked properly chastised, but Steve still had the urge to throttle him. As children, whenever Steve could convince him to actually try, Bucky could easily overpower Steve. However, now that Steve was grown, he was of a height with Bucky and much more of a threat.
Don't get him wrong, the desperation was there as Tony wraps his legs around Steve's trim waist, but there wasn't a selfish bite to it.
. Tony forgot that mentally, Steve was only twenty-nine. He carried himself with an age-old grace and had suffered so
For all of his boasting, it wasn't Rumlow who brought down the stag they had tracked for the better part of the afternoon. It was Bucky. He had slit the beast's throat with his sword after Tony, of all people, had lamed it with a well-placed shot of his bow. After that, the party had warmed up to Tony, and Rumlow stayed out of their way. They broke their fast in a clearing with well-trodden ground, not too far from the game park entrance. Servants made quick work of the rabbits and stag, skinning and salting the meat with precision.
His servant, Peter, woke him bright and early with a chipper, “Good morning, sire,” before throwing his curtains open. The first rays of the rising sun filtered in through his window…and right into his face.
The muscles in Tony's stomach jump, still reeling from the aftershocks of his orgasm as Steve rises to his feet. Later on, Tony couldn't tell anyone why he did it, but he pulls Steve into a fierce kiss and licks the taste of himself from Steve's mouth. Steve kisses him back just as hard until the water is like a thousand icy pinpricks, and their skin begins to prune up. Tony returns the favor and gets Steve off one more time, stroking him off with his hands.
" but nothing ever comes. It's hard to be afraid of a man in bunny slippers and who's currently turning so red he could resemble a strawberry.
He pulled Natasha into one last hug, feeling the solid weight of her body against his, burying his face into her neck. “I’ll miss you.”
“And then there were three,” Tony said, as he and Bruce slowly ambled over to Tony’s car. “Where are you headed, Cap?”
The green flecks in Steve’s eyes are brighter than ever as he places a hand across Tony’s chest and urges him to lie down. Steve’s hand is big, big enough to cover the sunburst-esque scar left behind by the arc reactor. The last time they were this close, Steve was driving a shield down into his chest. Tony remembered hearing the crack of glass and the grating crunch of metal against metal and thinking that his heart had been split in half as well.
made him flush. He knew he was always attracted to men as well as women from a young age. While all the other lads had spent their time flirting with lady’s maids and servant girls, Steve occupied his time in the training yard under the guise of studying the male form for his art. He studied it all right, with his hand shoved down his breeches late at night in the sanctity of his bed. The way sweat made their tunics cling to their muscles, swords clashing and clanging, singing their song of steel, had set his blood alight.
“You did that out of spite,” Tony said, getting to his feet. But in hindsight…maybe tinkering in his lab while running off of nothing but coffee and fumes may have been a safety hazard.
He's not an artist, not like Steve, but he understands the appeal of wanting to capture a moment forever in all of its rawness. He wants to get some paints and canvas and immortalize Steve precisely as he is right now: wild and devout. To
a meeting after a literal alien invasion makes Tony seethe. Bureaucracy never sleeps, he guesses. (He’s
Bucky pinned him down with his gaze, and Steve’s stomach churned. He didn’t like such talk of ugly things like treason or executions and had little patience for intrigue. Let his father play the mind games.
“No?” Steve asked, ignoring the fire in his belly at the words “my prince” falling from the courtesan’s lips. “What’s all this then? The crown prince has to pay just to get someone to sleep with him? A man nonetheless?”
Murray’s Bar and Grill was the most popular beachside hole-in-the-wall this side of the Mississippi. The restaurant was a squat, low building made nearly entirely out of wood. Real fishing nets and life savers and fishing lures adorned the walls. Offering live music, greasy food, and cheap alcohol, all tied up with a magnificent view of the Pacific Ocean, it was easily the last place one would expect to find a billionaire. On a normal day, Tony couldn’t get enough of the place.
“Are you feeling alright?” she asked like she already knew the answer. “Had any headaches lately? Slowing of movement?”
Carmen pounces on him, full-on throwing her arms around Tony's neck. Tony catches her no problem and—Carmen's mood is so
Natasha’s eyes light up as she says, “That had to have been the first thing they did, right? It makes sense.”
Steve's grip tightens on his cock, and Tony bucks up into his fist, his hands flying up to make contact with Steve's skin. "I don't want to wreck you," Steve says, eyes burning. "I want to worship you."
Also for my bilingual readers, if I have any, please excuse my shitty Italian in this chapter, I'm literally just working off of Google Translate
“Hello,” he had cooed at the tan-and-white pup as it had wiggled it’s way out of the cardboard box he and all of his brothers and sisters were living in. It’s fluffy ears flopped forward as it struggled to find its balance on its too big paws.
And there it was. The truth was out, not that Tony tried to keep it a secret much anyway. Sooner or later everyone was going to find out the great Howard Stark’s son was attending
school and they’d all come oohing and ahhing before the day was over. Tony had closed his eyes and waited for the gasps and the questions and the sucking up-
.” Steve punctuated each word with a hard thrust against that wonderful bundle of nerves. Tony bit his fist to keep from screaming. Was his dignity in shreds? Sure. Did that mean he wanted to stop? Hell no. But he wouldn’t give Steve the satisfaction of seeing him beg just yet. He needed just a little bit more, that push right over the edge of a cliff. His cock pulsed against his stomach, leaking pre-come.
“But look,” Steve had said, lifting up the dog that had stumbled out to greet him. “He’s happy to meet you! Say hi to Dodger.”
Tony’s smile got wider and nodding his head at Steve’s motorcycle, he said, “A motorcycle, huh? Isn’t that a little, I don’t know, wild for you? I was thinking you were more of a Beetle man.”
Carmen's face is red when Thor straightens back up, releasing her hand. After that, it's like the others shift into gear. Clint apologizes for his comment. Bruce offers her a kind hello until it's just Natasha who steps up until she's right in front of Carmen. Even though they're the same height, Carmen stiffens up, looking at Natasha like she's about to get chastised.
And that’s how Steve found himself trailing behind Tony’s car on his bike. Giddiness bubbled up inside of him. Steve had seen the Compound as home, but the Tower, the Tower was where it had all started. After SHIELD had fallen, Steve, Natasha, and Clint had all finally taken Tony on his offer to stay in the Tower, Thor following along behind them after abnegating, and that had marked the beginning of their transition from team to
He speaks without thinking, something you'd think wouldn't happen so often to a literal genius. "Steve's been...Steve's been good."
“It had to be because he based it on Erksine’s research,” Tony states, confirming Steve's suspicions.
It’s got Romanov’s attention. And everyone else’s, apparently. Bruce is still sleeping, but Barton’s turned his eyes onto them, that faraway look receding slightly. Thor’s sitting up now, his arms crossed in front of his broad chest.
"What would make Prince Steven break?" Tony said, and Steve found himself with a lapful of him. His breath left him all at once.
Steve doesn’t speak. Tony doesn’t know if he shocked him or offended him, or perhaps Steve was just thinking over what he would say.
," he says, knowing damn well she hadn't gone by Virginia since she started working for him. "And…it's Steve now. He's not so bad when you get to know him."
Tony’s floating. He didn’t know when his couch turned into a cloud, but he’s floating with Steve kissing the bite he left on his neck.
to be treated like this. To be called someone’s bitch, their whore, their slut, or any variation of the word. But a piece of himself, something primal and pliant, purred at the thought of being
“Enough teasing,” Steve said, wrenching Tony’s head back. A whine left Tony’s spit-slick mouth, his fingers digging into Steve’s thighs. “Either you suck my cock like you mean it, or I send you out there with pre-come and drool all over your face.”
When Steve finally pulls his head back, his mouth all red and shining with saliva, Tony has the odd impulse to draw him into a kiss. A true kiss. Not that vicious battle for dominance that had consumed them earlier. Instead, Tony just spreads his legs and waits for Steve to continue.
The sorceress, once again in those same sunshine yellow robes, stared at him from across the sturdy wooden table, her hands folded primly in front of her. Like last time, Steve hadn’t even needed to knock, the door to the Sanctum opening up for him as if through…well, magic. He had been escorted by a young woman, another sorcerer, he assumed given she was also wearing robes and the familiar ring he had noticed both Doctor Strange and the yellow-robed woman wore. His escort had referred to the yellow-robed woman as the Ancient One and suddenly, Steve had a deep understanding for Tony’s dislike of all things magic.
he could come that fast let alone untouched—stars bursting behind his eyelids. Both of them were moaning now with no shame, Tony filling up his already soiled suit—God, explaining the stains to his dry cleaner won’t be a fun conversation—a second spurt landed right on Tony’s tongue, the salty taste of Steve’s come engulfing his taste buds. Tony took Steve back into his mouth who cried out at the sudden onslaught of stimulation, one final last rope of come filling Tony’s mouth. Tony swallowed around Steve’s cock head, taking the load like a good slut and Steve pushed against Tony’s head half-heartedly.
Thank you to everyone who's stuck with this fic even though it's been a hot second since I've updated. You mean the world to me 💖. Again, chapter four should be up before the month is over. Chapter five needs a little bit of tweaking but it'll probably be up in early February.
Aaah!! I'm sorry this was late but work literally kicked my ass last week and I could not write to save my life. On the upside though, this chapter was a bit longer and fluffier so hopefully that makes up for it. Chapter Four might also be a bit late but I'm going to try to stick to updating on Sundays as much as possible. Thank you to everyone who's still with me and for everyone who's just now finding this story, welcome! Be prepared for pain! Anyway, y'all know the drill, comments and kudos are much appreciated. Follow me on
“Two,” Steve said and he tried his best to focus on Tony’s voice, his eyes, his everything. He reached out blindly for one of Tony’s hands and the other man immediately grasped his, intertwining their fingers.
"Maybe so. It's refreshing having another scientist to go mad with," he says, smiling devilishly when Pepper pales.
. Sir Brock Rumlow, one of his father’s more brutish knights, had gone back on a payment after one of Madam Natalia’s girls claimed that he was far too rough. Steve hadn’t seen the girl, but rumors of how badly Sir Brock had beaten her had made their way to court as gossip was wont to do. Bruised ribs, a black eye, and even missing teeth. Hearing the rumor had made him sick to his stomach but seeing Madam Natalia’s revenge curdled his blood.
Steve let his head go and Tony leaned forward to rest it on the desk. He couldn’t rest for long, however, when Steve hauled him up and into his desk chair so that Tony was seated on his cock. The new position gave his legs some reprieve and plunged Steve further into him. Tony moaned, head thrown back and throat exposed. Steve filled him to the brim like he and Tony were made to fit together.
Natasha has risen out of her seat, pacing the length of the boardroom, trying to make sense of it all. “Okay. Let’s say I’m HYDRA,” she says. “I have a super-soldier at my disposal. I try to replicate my serum to create more soldiers, but the trials aren’t successful. I still want an army of enhanced soldiers at my disposal.”
The aforementioned dunce cap had been jauntily placed on top of DUM-E’s robotic arm after he had knocked one of Tony’s gauntlets off of his workshop table. Normally, Tony would have written it off as DUM-E’s usual brand of clumsiness had he not been consecutively knocking stuff off of Tony’s table for four months. The bot had been acting up ever since Tony had returned to Malibu. DUM-E had reacted the same way when they had first moved to New York to live in Stark Tower. Or Avengers Tower as it was now being called. Which was funny seeing as there was currently no Avengers living in it at all.
“I liked it,” Jackson said with a small grin. “Not too many people joke around me these days,” he added.
Tony cups Steve's face in his hand. Steve closes his eyes, leaning into Tony's touch. When he opens them, his eyelashes are clumped with tears.
Tony shakes his head. “I’m not talking about the Avengers. I’m talking about you and me. We’re a team. And you made a promise, mister.” He pokes Steve in his chest.
Steve’s eyebrows shot up involuntarily. He had never even suspected Rumlow shared his attraction towards men, let alone would be bold enough to proposition one right in front of Steve. For a horrid second, he thought Tony would say yes, given the appraising way he looked at Rumlow. Rumlow must have felt the same, for his smile grew wider, warping the hourglass-shaped scar on his cheek.
He waits for the snide comments, the jeers, the disgust to cross their faces but instead...instead they laugh. And it’s not a laugh of derision; Tony’s heard enough of those to recognize them. These are real, genuine laughs.
They would simply talk. The courtesan would still be compensated for his service, and Steve would prove that he was a gentleman and good company to be around.
“I’m sorry, Tony,” Steve said and he knew he was apologizing for far more than what he had said on the Helicarrier. “I had no right to say that you should stop pretending to be a hero.”
"Oh, really?" Natasha says, raising her brows. Natasha looks her up and down, and Carmen, much to her credit, holds her gaze. "I have ideas for your spring collection if you'd like to hear them."
Tony wasn’t worried. Really. The giant bunny waiting in the roundabout for Pepper wasn’t an impulse buy and actually something he’d had in the works for a while. And he had managed to make dinner without burning himself or the house down, and the salmon had ended up being pretty damn delicious if he did say so himself. Now, he was just burning off restless energy in the workshop. Mark 42 was upstairs with Tony remote piloting the suit. This way he could still be a good boyfriend (and host) to Pepper while also getting in a nice workout.
“That was the timeline trying to correct itself. You traveling back in time would cause countless anomalies in the space-time continuum. Space and time would literally rip itself apart, so it targets the anomaly and annihilates it.”
them. His feelings had always crept up on him like a lion stalking its prey, only pouncing when he least expected it. He was starting to like them, even
Perhaps it was the wine loosening his inhibitions or the shock of the evening’s events wearing off, but Steve realized that the courtesan wasn’t just handsome; he was gorgeous, with his dark wavy hair and, much to Steve’s surprise, solidly built. The courtesan was shirtless aside from the gold body chain encircling and accentuating his torso. He looked more at ease in Steve’s rooms than Steve was, his hands at home in the pockets of his crimson silk pants. They were not quite the same shade of red found in Brooke’s crest, but close. The color suited his tanned skin well. In the firelight, he reminded Steve of one of the creatures of old, like a phoenix or a griffin, something powerful and dangerous, but you couldn’t help but be drawn in for a closer look.
Rhodey curses again, enough to make even Tony blush before scrubbing a hand down his face. "I'm going on leave soon," he starts, pointing a finger at Tony. "Don't you dare die before I get to see you."
Fast forward two weeks later and Tony was teaching Dodger to fetch tools from across the workshop. DUM-E had been ecstatic to have another friend in the workshop and had taken to racing with Dodger to see who could get the tool Tony needed the fastest while Tony threatened to give DUM-E and Dodger to a community college and kennel respectively.
Regardless, I know things are getting really stressful right now (like they weren't before 🙄) and I hope this chapter gives you all a little break from reality. Chapter 3 which is really just part 2 of chapter 2 is already written, it just needs to be revised and edited. You guys are getting a special treat in that one. 😉
,” Tony says and there must be something hard in his face because Steve actually listens to him for once and shuts his mouth.
He knows they're right, but being confronted by all of them at once has his hackles rising. Carmen's words are getting all tangled up with Pepper's, and he can't. Stop. Thinking.
True to his word, Steve cleans out every booth they touch,  until he's practically drowning in stuffed animals. They attract a crowd as they make their way to the food court. Tony's feet are aching, and his stomach is outright roaring for sustenance. He and Thor get the biggest plate of ribs they've got to offer. The meat's so tender it's falling off the bone and smoked to perfection. The sauce they used is homemade, all tang and smoky sweetness. He eats until his stomach is about ready to burst.
Tony rubs his chin. “I don’t know,” he draws out. “Not sure if I can trust you with my notes. They’re top secret.”
“And why not? He’s mine to do with as I wish, and I wish he was gone. His mere presence has caused unimaginable trouble.”
"Actually," Tony begins, his brain chugging along at its usual speed of light. "I have some requests…"
“When’s the last time you got a good night’s sleep?” Rhodey asked, shaking Tony out of his memories.
Everything changes one night after a night terror hits Tony particularly hard. He's no stranger to nightmares. Waking up with his heart trying to escape his chest, his hands clawing at the edges of his arc reactor scars was pretty par for the course. Didn't make it easier, though.
The pet name slips out unbidden, but Tony doesn't have it in him to take it back. He doesn't want to anymore. And given how Steve's eyes soften at the name, he doesn't want Tony to take it back either.
Natasha eyed him with a look in her eyes that he couldn’t quite place. “Fair enough. I’ll let Fury know.”
In the spacious solitude of Commander Rogers’ office, Tony felt as if he were going to spontaneously combust at any given moment. Rogers had waited until lunch when the Triskelion was at its busiest to give him the signal; nothing more than a tilt of the head and an arched brow from across the lunch room yet Tony was following him like a dog loyal to its master. Rogers had locked the door behind them, the click of the lock snapping into place echoing in the relative emptiness of the room. Rogers’ office was sparsely decorated and just as severe as the man who sat sprawled in his office chair like he was a king and it was his throne. Heavy clear blues eyes, almost lazily, looked at him from head to toe. Tony felt himself shiver involuntarily. He got the feeling that Rogers was already undressing him with his mind.
“Have you ever been kissed, my prince? Am I the first man to touch you?” He purred. Tony’s hands were busy themselves, working at the fastenings of Steve’s cursed doublet, shoving it down his shoulders.
The experience of having a mouth on his cock was unlike any other. It was so wet and hot, hotter than his own hands. He felt hyperaware of everything around him. Tony's sinful tongue tracing patterns along the length of Steve's cock, the honeysuckle in the air, the bubbling stream to the right of them. Tony sucked him in earnest now, bobbing his head and slurping indecently at Steve's cock. His knees trembled with the effort to keep himself from crumbling. He tugged at Tony's hair, needing to ground himself, and Tony
It’s nothing for Steve to pick Tony up, who only shifts in Steve’s grasp before settling. Steve lays him down face up on the navy blue sofa he called home whenever he came down to visit Tony. Tony stops snoring now that he’s sleeping like a normal human being, and the knot of tension in Steve’s chest loosens just a little. The next morning, Tony stumbles down to join the other Avengers for breakfast. He looks like he got a full night’s rest, his hair flying every which way, the bags under his eyes a little less defined. Steve makes fun of his snoring, and Tony vehemently denies it.
Bucky’s joy was so infectious Steve had to laugh with him. His anger left him entirely as he recalled his father’s reaction to Bucky’s mischief.
Steve draws back, looking slightly more at ease. “What have you been working on then, wonderkid? Want to compare notes?”
His heart speeds up again, and given their proximity, Steve can surely hear it, how crazy he makes Tony. With a declaration like that, how can he not love Steve with everything he has?
“Consider it an order,” Steve said, his tone brooking no argument. He pushed his plate towards Peter again who slowly, carefully reached for the loaf of bread like he expected Steve to snatch it back.
He's never done this for a partner before. Usually, Tony's dates didn't stay long enough to cuddle, let alone shower together, with the exception of Pepper. But this...it had never been like this. It's like he's discovering a new element again or building his suit for the first time. Bringing something into being that which the world had never seen before.
“And what kind of world would we have without chocolate chip cookies?” a familiar voice asks teasingly. One Ana Jarvis makes her way into the kitchen, her heels
Steve had been kissed before but not like this. Never like this, with someone tugging at his hair, pain, and pleasure stitching together to leave Steve hard and leaking pre-come in his trousers.
For the next three hours, Tony shoves Carmen's words from his mind and throws himself into teaching anyone who steps up to the basketball booth about physics. It wasn't
And that’s how Rhodey had found him; a scrawny 15 year old who looked like he was 100 pounds soaking wet, sitting hunched in on himself as if he were trying to make himself smaller.
“Drink with me,” Steve said, filling the second goblet on the tray he’d had his attendant bring up earlier.
It’s weird, being able to joke about what happened to him now. But with Tony it feels fine, like it’s all in the past. What matters is now; this place and the people who go with it. He misses Peggy and Bucky and his Howlies but Stark Tower, the other Avengers,
Tony swallows down the sudden lump that arose in his throat and scrambles to come up with something,
Something in Natasha’s face softens, and she tilts her head at Tony. “I’m not going to pretend I know all of the details, but…you’re good for him. And I think he’s good for you. You’re both...softer. You look happy.”
With his tousled hair and kiss-swollen lips, Tony had the look of a vixen. Beautiful. Dangerous. Alluring.
"Sometimes, I can't believe he's real," Natasha says, breaking the silence. There's no need to wonder who's the "he" she's talking about. Tony thinks it himself sometimes.
There goes Tony's heart again, beating like it wants to leap out of his chest and directly into Steve's hands. He hears the unspoken words in Steve's condition, and he realizes that that's precisely what he's doing. Handing Steve his heart on a silver platter.
The words sounded fake to Tony’s ears. Surely, JARVIS was joking? But no, he wouldn’t joke with Tony, at least not about something like this. But him, Tony Stark having an anxiety attack…it was unheard of.
“Steve?” Bruce asked, a hand tentatively reaching out towards him. “You okay there? You just froze out of nowhere.”
Pepper nods, looking a little less concerned, which is all Tony can ask for. "And the others? They're not bothering you?"
“You do it too, asshole,” Tony said, stomping into the little kitchenette of his penthouse suite. Opening a cabinet, he stood on his tiptoes to reach for the bag of coffee grounds that had been placed on the highest shelf. “Stupid short legs,” Tony muttered. “JARVIS, who even put the coffee grounds on the top shelf?”
Tony recalls Steve nibbling at his throat while Tony admitted that he had always wanted to try a little exhibitionism.
Steve eyes are brighter than Tony’s ever seen them as he slowly pushes inside. Tony can see the entire universe in Steve’s eyes. He can see hunger and want and guilt and something so raw that Tony has to close his eyes. Steve’s cock filling him is a familiar but not unpleasant burn that soon has Tony seeing stars behind his eyes once Steve starts fucking into him in earnest.
“Five,” Tony continued. “The year is 2012. You’re at Stark Tower. Clint wants to call it Avengers Tower because he’s an asshole.”
Steve pushes on. “On the helicarrier...did I come on to you too strong? Because if I did, that wasn’t my intention at all—”
“Gods,” Steve swore, forgoing his manners. Damn it all. Damn his birthday and damn his crown and damn his
He feels rather than sees Steve grin against his thigh before his hands surge up and swing Tony’s legs over his broad shoulders. A yelp escapes Tony’s mouth at the sudden change of position and his hands fly up to grasp at the headboard. The yelp turns into a moan as Steve licks a broad, flat stripe against Tony’s entrance. He licks another stripe, this time across, and another and another, unrelenting until Tony’s writhing against the sheets. Steve’s grip only tightens on Tony’s thighs. He presses his face further into the apex of Tony’s thighs and stiffens his tongue and plunges it into Tony’s hole.
“Erskine’s serum was,” Steve pauses, trying to find the right word. “Selective. That's why he chose me. Do you think Zola’s serum was the same?”
It's!! Finally!! Here!! Y'all do not have any idea how excited I've been to post this chapter. I really think it's my best one yet. Aside for a little warning that there
He finishes his shift with little fanfare, the carnival-goers opting for the rides and fair food after loading up on prizes for the day.
Carmen's beyond delighted when Tony gives her the good news over the phone the next day. "Thank you, thank you, thank you!" Her voice still does that weird squeaky thing when she gets really excited.
Tony let out a snore, turning his head in his sleep to get more comfortable. Steve mentally breathes a sigh of relief. He’s only a
“She, uh,” Tony rubbed the back of his neck. “She misses me. She thinks I’m spending too much time in New York.”
Heat flooded Steve’s face. He had nearly forgotten about the fight aboard the Helicarrier. Steve had a handful of regrets in his life, one of them most definitely being the things he had said on the Helicarrier. God, he had told Tony to stop pretending to be a
Tony inclined his head in agreement and let Steve lead him to the table. His hands shook as Tony caught his eye while he filled their cups. There was something about his gaze that left Steve feverish like Tony could see past his clothes, his skin, and into his very core. It unsettled him.
“It wasn’t your fault, trust me,” Tony says. “I just feel like maybe you didn’t want to jump headfirst into
you'd be," Steve said. Tony didn’t bother to hide the little gasps and moans Steve fucked out of him. He felt so full, like with each thrust, Steve breached his fucking stomach.
Tony shivers, and Steve wants to hit himself. So much for not making Tony comfortable. But then, Tony does the unthinkable. He takes a deep breath and slowly sinks into Steve’s side. Steve freezes like a deer staring up the barrel of a shotgun.
his greatest feature. But he decides to forge on. “That’s hurtful, honey bear,” he says. “Why are you being mean to me? Are you hungry? You’re only mean to me when you’re hungry.”
Tony gets whipped cream on his nose and his lips and Steve kisses it away. Tony tastes like chocolate and coffee and cream. He’s never tasted anything sweeter in his life.
. He knows a few details about Tony’s life, he’s solved a bit of the puzzle; he knew Tony had butlers and maids growing up, but not once did he think Tony knew his way around a kitchen. But he
. They're blank slates before society, or their parents or both screw them over, and looking at their fanart makes Tony dislike most humans a little less. It reminds him of why he fights. At the end of the day, putting on the suit isn't about saving his own life, or the glory of it all, or even atoning for his past mistakes. It's about making sure that those kids who had enough kindness in their heart to spare a kind word and some art to a virtual stranger still have a world to live in the next day. Not that anybody would believe Tony.
“I know,” she repeated with a sigh. “Just one more dance? You certainly owe me more than one given how long you’ve made me wait, Captain Rogers,” she sniffed.
"We strike fast, and we strike hard, leave them absolutely no time to recoup. HYDRA, no doubt, has a number of facilities at their disposal. We find them, and we burn them to the ground. Any operatives who surrender
I'm sorry this is so late but I'm going to try to get back on track! A little warning for this chapter. Spoiler alert, Steve has another panic attack. If something like that might trigger you, it starts at
me to make things work with Pepper.” Spreading his hands out, Tony said, “This is me making things work. Look, I thought about it all night and called her this morning and she agreed to it. I’m trying to do the right thing, Cap.”
Trauma. Steve was all too familiar with that word, having used it many times himself in the original timeline (or prime-line as he was beginning to think of it) after the Decimation. The support group had seemed like it had happened ages ago. Steve had…liked it. It wasn’t perfect by any means, but it had allowed for him to help others in a way he had failed to do as Captain America.
Tony swallowed around him, and that coil of heat inside of him imploded. Steve bit his lips to hold in the groan that threatened to slip past, his knees buckling with the force of his orgasm.
Chris had spun the scissors in her hands a few times, a nervous tic Steve assumed, before explaining, “I served in Iraq about a year ago. I was a combat medic and…my unit….we were…we were scouting ahead and,” she paused.
“How did you—Ty and I—” for the first time in ever, really, Tony couldn’t find the words. His relationship with Pepper had been no secret, nor his relationship with Rumiko, but Ty—
. A book missing from a its shelf. A stray lipstick-stained cup lying on the counter. It was very creepy. And so
per se; Tony simply calculated the angle the kids would have to throw the ball along with the perfect amount of force. The looks of shock followed by unabashed glee after they made a basket more than made up for any guilt he was feeling.
Steve works him over with quick strokes of his hand, breaking their kiss to murmur in his ear, “Come on, baby. Spread these legs for me.”
Tony shifts in his seat and hopes that Steve won’t notice, but of course, when do things ever work out the way Tony wants them to? Steve’s eyes track his movements with all the purpose of someone used to analyzing situations. Is that what Steve thinks is about to happen? A battle?
Bruce had damn near spat out his cup of coffee and Steve hands fumbled the plates filled with pancakes he had been carrying to the dining table.
Steve doesn't say anything, just presses into Tony harder, like he's trying to seep into Tony's skin. Tony throws a hand over his mouth to stifle his moans even though it's just them, but Steve catches his hand and intertwines it with his.
“Not physically. Just...shaken. It was like the Battle of New York all over again. Do you know what that’s like? The thing you trust to keep you alive being your coffin?”
Their lips slotted together like two magnets, instantaneous and unbreakable. Steve wasted no time slipping his tongue into Tony’s mouth. Tony moaned, winding one of his hands into Steve’s hair. Two weeks. He had gone two weeks without feeling Steve’s skin against his, without smelling the woodsy scent of his body-wash. He could function without Steve’s kisses but that didn’t mean he
“Later,” Steve promised. “I swear when I’m done with you, you won’t be able to fucking walk. Count on that.”  And then Steve pushed the head of his cock into Tony and it was like coming home. He missed being full, feeling Steve inside of him like they were becoming one person.
late but its complete now! I apologize for the brief hiatus but I wanted to get Tony's POV exactly right and after writing for Steve for so long, I may or may not have struggled. Before you guys start the chapter, you need to know a couple of things.
"Your Highness," Rumlow said, bowing before him. The others, save for his father, quickly followed suit.
Steve sends Natasha, Tony, and Thor off with a nod, while he, Clint, and the Hulk stand guard. They have their own missions to fulfill.
Tony closes his eyes and does as he's told. Some of the tension leaves his body as Steve's voice washes over him.
Tony ducked down, narrowly missing another piece. Before he could catch his breath, one piece slammed into his crotch, another hitting and enveloping his back, the force of it throwing him forward and off the platform. Tony yelped and fired his repulsors at just the right moment. “Cool it, will you JARVIS?” Any later and he would’ve been a Tony pancake.
Tony supposes that their day has come to an end; The sun has gone out of sight, the edges of the sky tinged with a thousand shades of pink, orange, and violet. They should eat dinner, and Tony needs to gather up everyone's armor and weaponry for some much needed updates and—
Sometimes the food didn’t taste great, he’ll admit that. But it didn’t taste terrible either. It tasted
“Not talking baby? This too much for you?” Steve’s words carried a sharp edge to them like he liked seeing Tony broken down and desperate.
was the perfect time to bombard him. The nightmares had been abstract at first, nothing but darkness and him waking up sweaty and on edge. But then they started taking on shapes. Faces. Memories. So many memories. Memories from both timelines swirled round and round in his brain until some mornings he couldn’t remember
Pepper removed the headset from his head and tilted his chin up so he could look her in the eyes. She was beautiful from this angle. From all angles. Her hair was up like usual, pretty bangs framing her heart shaped face. Her dark blue eyes were shining with love—that had to be love, there was no other word for the depth of emotion in them—and for a second, Tony felt like he couldn’t breathe.
, ended up making a mess and somehow Steve found themselves pelting each other with flour and milk and cheese and anything else they could get their hands on. It had been the most fun Steve had had in years.
He’s still arrogant, especially on the battlefield, but whenever he watches Tony topple firewalls and HYDRA agents alike (often at the same time), he thinks that maybe Tony deserves to be a little arrogant.
Steve’s thick fingers prod at his entrance. His fingers burn, but the pain gives way to pleasure after a moment and soon Tony has a hand clapped over his mouth to stifle the cries that flee from his traitorous lips; Tony hates the little gasps and moans that escape his lips as the other man teases his prostate.
A band of scouts dressed in traditional green hunting livery entered the clearing and declared their findings as if summoned. There
Sweat builds at Tony’s temple as Steve fucks into him with rough, desperate thrusts. His grip on Tony’s hand is tight, too tight, and Tony’s sure he’s going to leave bruises when they’re done.
“To be honest,” Steve said, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly, “I don’t even think you’re capable of pretending. Being Iron Man comes as easily to you as breathing.”
Tony makes up his mind the week before midterms.  He’s killing it in Calculus and Biology couldn’t be easier, but if he has to read one more passage of Hemingway’s bland, uninspiring prose, Tony’s going to rip his hair out.
“You experience things and then they’re over and you still can’t explain them. And that…that bothers me. It bothers me to my very
Tony panted, his heart beating like a drum in his chest. His whole body trembled with lust, fuck, he was practically
Tony inhaled again, trying to shove the nightmare down to the deepest wells of his mind despite his therapist's advice.
Man, he should really put down some more fatigue mats. He's not as young as he used to be, and workshop binges are even harder when you can't stay on your feet—
Dugan's blue eyes visibly brightened at the sight of him. "Sire!" Dugan said, cutting off Rumlow in the middle of his tale.
He wouldn't show his frustration, even as his hands trembled. Bucky approached him and slung an arm around Steve's shoulders.
Steve leaned in close, his chest draping over Tony’s exposed back so his mouth was right by Tony’s ear. “You’re already doing that sweetheart.”
Bucky nodded at Robb as he left out. Robb closed the door, the latch snapping shut with a sense of finality. Steve was finally alone with the courtesan. Gods help him.
alone would make Tony come again; that wet, rhythmic slapping of flesh against flesh, Steve’s rumbly growls occasionally interrupted by throaty swears.
Tony wonders where the others are and waits for a surge of red mist, or a gun or arrow or both to be aimed his way.
And now his home was nowhere to be found. It had been completely and utterly decimated and putting it back together would be like trying to fit a million shards of glass back into a picture frame.
This close, Steve could see that Tony’s eyes were glossy and bloodshot as if he’d been crying. He could smell the liquor on Tony’s breath and the desire to dump the bottle of Jack Daniel’s down the nearest sink overcame him.
Rumlow’s brow furrowed as he puzzled over what Tony said. Meanwhile, Tony turned his attention to Dugan.
Steve, bless his heart, blushes but doesn’t say anything, and Tony’s just reminded of how he looked when he came down Tony’s throat; head thrown back, mouth open, and skin flushed.
,” he thinks with more than a little vindictiveness. Underneath the baseball cap, Tony can see the tufts of hair visible have been dyed a rich dark brown. Even though his eyes are shrouded by a pair of dark sunglasses, Tony knows that behind them lie a devastating pair of eyes blue like the Pacific Ocean at sunrise. Tony would know.
“All fucked out and you’re still desperate for it,” Steve crooned, his voice sweet yet taunting and once more arousal burned in Tony’s core. “I’ll give you what you want sweetheart.”
Tony took a running start at the same time as the face plate, then on a whim, did a frontward flip, jet boots and all. For a brief moment, Tony was weightless, his hands seizing the face plate easily. The face plate snapped onto the rest of his helmet as Tony landed deftly in a crouch, his HUD flaring to life. “I’m the best.”
sign of another body clad in his uniform. All he saw before him was the wreckage of the earlier fight; shattered glass and metal and stray traces of blood.
Before Steve could answer, Rumlow butted back in, “Forget the sword. How does it feel to finally be a man?”
When he opened his eyes once more, he was sitting in a shallow pool of water. The briefcase was still in his hands. Opening the case, Steve counted three stones and breathed a sigh of relief. Looking more closely at his surroundings, he realized that Vormir had disappeared completely. Good. He couldn’t exactly say that he’d miss the godforsaken planet. The real question was, where the hell was he
to help them was tearing him up inside. On Vormir he had wanted to grab onto Natasha and hop back to their original timeline, mission be damned. Only the thought of the remaining stones being left in Skull’s possession stayed his hand.
Years ago, Steve would have mistaken Tony’s actions for arrogance or laziness. Now though, now he could see that even from the beginning that Tony had been working overtime trying to look after all of them. Anyone with eyes could see that they were all exhausted and in desperate need of rest and sustenance. And despite Thor’s protests that he wasn’t a fragile mortal like the rest of them, Steve had noticed the sluggishness to the god’s movements.
“You’ve done it before,” Tony points out. “Look, I didn’t mean to snap, but,” he reaches for Steve’s hand, and Steve thankfully lets him take it. “We’re a team. Aren’t we?”
It’s not that he doesn’t trust her, per se, but he knows where her loyalties lie. If she got one glimpse of what he was really working on, she’d go running back to Fury like a good little agent. He knew how Fury operated now; Hill was here to help just as much as she was here to spy.
Steve strokes Tony’s arm, his touch far lighter than one would expect from a soldier; he touches Tony like he’s something to be treasured, with the soft, exploring hands of an artist. Of a lover.
The others just shrugged and let it go, but Tony could feel Clint's eyes, oddly enough, along with Steve's, watching him. Steve, he figured that the asshole just wanted a front-row seat to Tony's torment, but Clint was a surprise. A nasty surprise. With a codename like Hawkeye, there's not much someone like that would miss...
When Happy answered the video call, Tony was greeted to the sight of Happy’s entire forehead, bringing a smile to his face. Happy could be such an old man with technology sometimes.
“So what’s to become of the…man?” He asked, referring to Bucky’s gift. Steve grew hot under the collar at the mere memory of those kohl-lined eyes and the way his rich silks draped his lithe body…
Tony paused to survey a Pinot Noir. It’d pair well with fish, especially salmon. Tony could make fish. He hoped. “What? Harassing interns?”
They come at the same time, their hips moving together so fluidly like they hadn’t spent a year apart, Tony against his stomach and Steve inside of him. This time tears
“Okay, I’ll compromise. How about we talk to everyone we know, and see if we can set the other dogs up with nice homes.”
Despite being on opposite sides of the country, Tony and Pepper talk more often than people think. Pep’s an early riser, and Tony hasn’t gotten a good night’s sleep since he was born, so it balances out.
“You missed me that bad? Poor baby,” Steve mocked him and it was mean just how Tony liked it, enough to have him pushing back against Steve's fingers.
Pepper sets her mug down and levels him with a stern look that puts him in the mind of a school principal.
Steve shares a look with Natasha, and Tony gets the sneaking suspicion that they planned this. Who knew that the fall of SHIELD would lead to one of the most dangerous alliances Tony had ever seen?
He kissed Steve wholeheartedly, his surprisingly calloused hands cupping Steve’s face, and all thoughts of Lady Carter fled from his mind as swiftly as a spooked horse. Steve quickly moved past his initial surprise and matched Tony’s enthusiasm, kiss for kiss, his hands finding home again on Tony’s ass.
Tony had always been curious, and Steve being an artist had always fascinated him. How could a man, seemingly destined for combat, have the passionate, creative soul of an artist? "Do you...do you miss it?" He asks.
That’s how Tony spent the rest of his afternoon, the incident at Murray’s falling from his mind until all that was left was him and his holograms. Tony didn’t realize he had spent nearly the entire day in his workshop until he got the alarm from JARVIS that Pepper would be coming home soon.
“Once I corrected the anomaly, your body for lack of a better word, poofed into non-existence. You’re in your younger self’s body. His conscience is completely gone. It’s just you in there.”
Lost in his thoughts, he barely realized he had reached the stream until his toes had started to sink into the significantly softer mud. Fully blossomed honeysuckle encroached on the trees, releasing its sweet perfume in the air.
He debates waking Tony up but decides against it. Tony barely gets enough sleep as is, and Steve’s not about to stop him. He sets the plate of spaghetti down on Tony’s table, where he’ll be able to see it when he wakes up. There, he’s done his duty as captain of their little team, and the others are probably wondering what’s taking him so long. But as he turns to leave, he finds that he can’t. Not while Tony’s using a wrench as a pillow, sitting on a stool with absolutely no back support. He makes his mind when Tony snores again.
Steve flinched. Turning around, he saw Tony standing on the outskirts of their little group. Conversations ground to halt once more, his father and his advisers stopping to observe the latest distraction.
He remembered reading them and being amused, what kid wouldn’t be? But Bucky had been the one who had really been into them and all things science fiction. Now
“Please,” Tony said, cursing how his voice wavered. “You’ve barely touched me. I’m not gonna break, Rogers.”
Tony doesn’t say anything. Instead, he’s grateful he’s also in disguise. The paps would have had a field day had they realized it was him and had snapped a pic. Tony could picture the headlines.
Tony had crossed his arms and straightened his spine, ignoring the sting of tears that threatened to fall from his eyes. Lifting his chin, he said, “Do I look like I’m lost?”
“Later,” Steve had said, eyes pleading. “The sooner I finish this paperwork, the sooner I’ll be able to devote all of my time and attention to you.”
“Tony,” Steve murmured, testing the name out loud. It wasn’t like any of the names common to Brooke’s smallfolk, but given Tony’s appearance and accent, Steve figured that he must have migrated from a neighboring kingdom. Steve decided that the name suited Tony.
Now, if God be willing, I think I'll try to update every Sunday but that's not a concrete guarantee. Y'all know the drill. Comments and kudos are very much appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read my fic and come with me on what I'm sure is gonna be a wild ride! Follow me on
Had JARVIS had lungs, no doubt he would have sighed in that moment. “…Very well, Captain. In that case I will try my best to help you.”
guilty, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. Bruce’s words echoed in his mind. It would only be five seconds. Blink and you’d miss it.
Returning to 2012 had done nothing but sadden him and he was ready to just hurl the remaining stones as far from himself as he could and go…somewhere. Anywhere but here. The time bracelet had made him reappear mere seconds after he had battled himself the first time around for the staff and Steve wanted nothing more than to slap his younger self and tell him to pull himself together.
This chapter is a bit of a filler but chapter four is done and I'll definitely have that up before the month is over. If I don't feel free to yell at me, I won't mind. I also accidentally ended up creating an OC for this story 🤷 I hope you guys like her because she's going to show up in a few more chapters.
He glanced at them through his lashes, propping his head up with his hand so he wouldn’t keel over. It was like a scene out of a movie, the way their lunch played out exactly the same.
“Tony,” Steve groans, one of his hands sliding up to intertwine with his. Tony doesn’t say anything, just laces his fingers with Steve’s and wraps his legs around his waist, urging him to go faster.
Again I have no idea where plot came from but she's here to stay now. Don't be afraid to tell me what you think even if it's just a string of emojis.
“You’re telling me,” Steve says carefully. Always so careful. Except for when his hands are shoved down Tony’s pants.
“I mean no offense,” Rhodey had begun, sitting down on his bed. “But who leaves their 12 year old kid alone at college?”
Bruce reddens, and Tony doesn't feel so alone because it looks like Bruce has his own beefy blond problem he needs to deal with. "Sure, since you asked," Bruce responds, leaving just...Steve.
The courtesan said his name, sending a thrill of excitement through him. He liked the way his name sounded on his tongue.
And just like that, Tony’s witty retort died on the tip of his tongue. For four months, he had nearly successfully blocked out any and all thoughts of the tower and its occupants from his mind, instead choosing to throw himself into his work. Until now. Unwanted memories ambled through his mind. There had been food fights and movie nights and many other activities one would have expected a group of teenagers to partake in, not fully grown superheroes. Tony never would have expected Steve to engage in any of those aforementioned childish activities but hell, as Tony looked back, Steve was usually the one to initiate them. And Tony…he guessed he missed it. He missed Steve. And Bruce too. And little Dodger who had somehow burrowed his furry, floppy-eared backside into Tony’s heart.
Pepper tried (and failed) to hide her grimace. “I did see it. It…was extremely hard not to. Question, how is it going to fit through the door?” she asked, pointing at said entry way.
“Nothing’s been the same since New York,” he admitted. The words had a sense of finality to them. Tony had heard that the first step to getting rid of a problem was admitting you had a problem, but he didn’t feel relief. He just felt exhausted. Exhausted and jittery and terrified.
“They’re comfy!” he shouted, stomping his feet. The eyes of the helmet-shoes started to glow, setting Steve off once more.
“Oh, yeah, yeah,” Tony said and place the bottle of Pinot Noir back in it’s slot. Maybe a white wine would be better?
Steve hovers over him. For a moment, Tony thinks he's going to say those three terrifying words. Horror and excitement alike send his stomach rolling, but Steve just says, "Anything for you."
Tony loves seeing her like this. Loose and comfortable with him. After they broke up, a part of him worried that things would be strained between them. He should have known that was impossible.
Tony placed his hands in front of him, sinking even lower to the ground and crawled the short distance to Steve who looked so devastatingly handsome and in charge, his bright blue eyes never straying from Tony’s once. He settled himself in the space between Steve’s legs both of his hands resting on the corded muscle that made up Steve’s thighs underneath the rough kevlar of his tac suit. Steve’s eyes burned with electricity. Tony felt another shiver wrack his body.
I don't know what the final chapter count of this fic is going to me but we're past the halfway point now. I'll try not to let months go in between updates next time. Once again, a big thank you to everyone who has stuck with me thus far.
After all they had done, Tony had the good grace to blush. "No need...I came with you." And surely enough, Tony had spilled into his own hand. Steve had been so caught up in his own pleasure that he hadn't even noticed.
before Steve would see Tony outside of his workshop. Steve and Dodger were still allowed down their, thankfully, but Tony was…different. Jittery. On edge. Traumatized.
He held out the scepter to her. Natasha nodded gratefully to him as she took a hold of it. “Thank you. I’ll make sure after lunch that this gets safely into SHIELD’s custody.”
“You look like you should still be in middle school,” Rhodey had said dryly, tossing his dufflebag onto the bed the opposite of Tony’s. “What are you, like twelve?”
“Natasha’s report was bullshit and you know it,” Steve said, his voice beginning to rise. “Tony, we need
"Tony? Hello?  I swear to God if you've just been using your life model decoy on me, I'm going to fly directly to Manhattan just to—"
grown comfortable. Too comfortable. All of this time spent living in the bubble that was Stark Tower, Steve had forgotten about his mission. AJ had said he deserved happiness, but what had Steve done in this timeline to make that a reality? In that moment he knew what he had to do. He had a phone call to make.
Steve’s hands briefly left Tony to help him out of his clothing. Prince or not, explaining why his clothes were ruined would be mortifying.
I apologize for the long wait in between updates, life has just been crazy and I haven't been feeling that inspired to write. That being said, I still hope you guys enjoy this chapter.
“That’s exactly it,” Chris said, pointing at him. “Sometimes I find myself smiling at something or laughing at a joke and my brain freezes like, ‘Why are you smiling? Why are you laughing? Pay attention! You’re in danger!’”
“You are to tell me when you’re hungry,” Steve said, trying to make his voice sound domineering. “I won’t have my personal servant passing out from starvation, understood?”
“Do you ever let anyone else talk?” Steve finally blurted out, throwing up his hands. “I’m not here to force feed you or drag you off to bed. Although, I’m definitely considering it.”
They hit the floor with a loud thud that surprisingly doesn’t have someone knocking at their door to see if they’re alright.
Tony looks up at him with fondness and lust his eyes. His lips are swollen and pink and his chest heaves slightly. A very large, very horny part of Steve practically purrs in satisfaction that
Steve has lifted the veil off of his face, and Tony can see the reverence in his gaze untempered. Tony's stomach clenches. He feels like an animal, like some feral beast has taken up residence in his skin, wanting to claim and be claimed.
She eyed the stone with mild interest before focusing in on his trembling hand. “Thank you, Captain,” she said.
“And I may or may not have had a quick bite…I didn’t know if you were coming home or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.”
life, Steve was determined to see things through right to the bitter end. But first he needed some answers.
Steve is the first to act, taking Carmen's hand in his own. "Thank you, ma'am," he says. "I know I speak for everyone when I say that we're glad the team exists, and we'll help out any way we can."
It's no great shock to him, not really. There's no fireworks, no lightning strikes, just a subtle shift in his paradigm, like someone zooming out on a camera.
Tony took off his ever present sunglasses, rolled his eyes, and poked Rhodey in his shoulder. “Okay, maybe War Machine is a little too on the nose. But you could’ve at
Two little kids had (thankfully) wandered up to their table. Tony amended his earlier thought; It was
“Watch your tongue,” Steve whispered fiercely, his eyes darting to the door. He could make out a shadow through the crack of the threshold; a guard.
Almost as if it heard his plea, a gauntlet arose from the table and encased his hand. He looked down in wonder as the crimson metal began to engulf his arm until eventually his entire shoulder was suited up. Tony pointed his non-armored arm to the table and the other gauntlet quickly made its way to him, wrapping itself around his hand and arm.
"That's the one," he says, some of his initial anxiety ebbing away. They weren't saying no. Not yet. Or maybe they were just trying to let him down gently.
with perhaps a little too much force, as his desk rattles when the book lands. “That’s false. My ass is definitely my best feature.”
Tony furrows his brows. A carnival does sound fun, and he has no problems with running a booth. It’s the others that are a problem.
He doesn’t know what to expect as Tony’s workshop comes into view. Every time Steve enters, it’s like he’s seeing it for the first time, power tools and inventions in their infancy strewn about like a child just got done playing with his toys. There’s nothing cold about Tony’s workshop. If anything, it’s filled with life. He stops to say hi to DUM-E and U, who roll up to him, waving their arms in what he assumes is excitement. DUM-E grabs him by the sleeve, rolling in the direction of Tony’s main work table.
The search for Loki had unfortunately bared no results and he and the rest of the Avengers were supposed to see Thor off-world that afternoon. The god was leaving to continue the search for his brother. It seemed as if the god of mischief had vanished into thin air. And seeing as he had disappeared with the Tesseract, that very well could have been their reality. Whatever situation Steve was in, it was painstakingly real.
“I’m…not sure how Howard was in the 40s but,” Tony rubbed the back of his neck. “By the time I was born, I don’t even think you would’ve recognized him. He was…cold. Calculating. Everything he did was for the sake of the company. And when I…when I started exhibiting signs of my genius…the things I could do…the things I could create, and at such a young age, too…everything he wanted me to do also started being for the sake of the company.”
They change the sheets together; Tony doesn’t feel like sleeping in a wet patch if he can help it. It feels intimate yet routine. Like he and Steve have done this a thousand times already.
“Well, why don’t I run to the garage and see if I can’t find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?” Pepper grinned wickedly before sauntering over to the stairs leading down to the workshop.
"For the scouts to return," Dugan said. "They think there's a herd of deer nearby. Everyone's itching to take down the stag."
Had he kept them open, he would have seen the mischievous glint in Tony's eye. Steve's shot right back open as Tony lapped at the head of his cock, gathering the precome that had beaded there like it was a treat to be savored.
Tony ducked his head, rubbing the back of his neck. “I meant what I said. There’s plenty of space. For all of you.”
"Look at their shading," Steve says, thankfully not addressing the elephant in the room. "Wish I had drawn like that at their age."
“Go ahead, baby,” Steve says. The pet name flows off his tongue like honey. “Tell me what you need.”
Steve moans, his hands pressed against the marble tiles. He pushes back into Tony's touch, his head falling forward into the spray.
“Yeah, I miss you too,” Happy grumbled. “But the way it used to be. Now you’re off with the ‘superfriends.’”
Steve slicks up his cock, and Tony's toes curl at the thought of all of that going inside him. He wants it, though. He wants Steve like he's never wanted anything else in his life.
?" King Joseph himself could have walked into their meadow at that moment, and Steve still wouldn't have stopped fucking Tony. He might as well have been a feral beast driven only by his most base desires, and right then, he needed to
“Thought this was what you wanted, hm?” Steve murmured all soft and gentle like they were cuddling in bed. “You came in here, interrupted my work. Now you’re gonna take what.
Steve's fingers, slick with Tony's saliva and lube, ghost around his perineum. He's thankful he had the good sense to shower beforehand, although he couldn't have foreseen this happening. Steve always caught him by surprise.
“Hurry up, Rogers,” he says going for boredom, but his voice is just a little too breathless for that as Steve’s breath ghosts hotly over his thighs. “Some of us don’t have all day.”
Tony continues on, the shouts and whoops and laughs fading into the background; he's made it to a quieter part of the carnival where they tucked off all of the arts and crafts booths.
“Well,” Tony rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah. We were just, uh, we were just hosting you while I finished up some work.”
With his other hand, Steve seized Tony by the jaw and forced Tony to look up at him. “Say it,” Steve rasped. “Say you’re my bitch and I’ll fuck your face like you’ve been gagging for it all day.”
“Can Thor really fly?” Bruce says. “I feel like it’s more of a controlled fall. He throws his hammer and lets the weight of it take him where he needs to go.”
“You get to own me for a few minutes out of the day and I get to get fucked like I want,” Tony said, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
“Tony,” Steve speaks his name so softly it feels like a caress. Tony wants to step back. He wants to put on the suit and fly to Malibu, to Amalfi, to anywhere but
Two weeks later, the look on everyone else's face when Tony presents them with the matching t-shirts he designed is more than worth the hour of alone time he promised her with Natasha.
Steve unwinds the bandages around his hands, conveniently avoiding Tony’s gaze when he says, “I’ve been busy.”
Steve kisses him like a thief, all greedy and ruthless, stealing his breath away. Steve walks them backward until Tony feels his legs hit his sofa. They stumble onto the couch, Steve lying on top of him, eclipsing Tony.
Tony whooped clapping his hands together as DUM-E did celebratory laps around the workshop. “Damn, I’m good. Knew all she needed was a choke.”
"J?" he asks. Tony used a separate comms unit precisely for moments like these when his suit might be compromised. "You there, buddy?"
His heartbeat quickens, and he's not sure why. It's not like it's a public declaration of love to ride with someone on a Ferris wheel.
“Well, I was until someone decided to care about my well-being or whatever,” Tony said. “Stupid Rhodey,” He grumbled for good measure.
Steve sighs and says, “Tony,” and Tony hates how his Brooklyn accent curls softly around the syllables, sounding all too much like a lover’s caress.
"Nothing," Steve says. "I just wanted you to have this." Steve hands the bear over to Tony, and Tony...Tony
“She’s organizing a week-long carnival in upstate New York for local orphanages. Think you or any of the others would be interested in working a booth?” Pepper says. “Having all of the Avengers show up would drum up a lot of publicity.”
He contemplated staying and trying some of the life Tony had been telling him to get. But it wouldn’t be
Tony did as he was told, letting his teeth drag over Steve’s length every time he withdrew from Tony’s mouth. Tony knew that his voice would probably have that raspy, throaty quality to it that would let everyone know
"Okay," Tony whispers, feeling like the air is closing in on him. It's hard to breathe when Steve looks at him like that, like Tony
But judging by the glint that had entered the other man’s dark eyes, Rhodey wouldn’t back down without a fight.
“I’ll ask,” Tony says, caving. “And if they say no, I’m not forcing them to go. Tell Carmen she’s getting one Avenger, at the least.”
There's the finger painting table where plenty of toddlers and adults alike are flinging paint onto sheets of canvas. One kid rises from the face painting table with Cap's shield emblazoned upon his cheek and a booth over...there's Steve, drawing caricatures for the kids. There's a curve to his lips. Steve's biting back a smile at the little boy trying (and failing) to sit still in his chair as he draws him. Tony's heart jumps at the sight. He's tempted to slide into the line for Steve's booth himself, but something holds him back. It could be the look of contentment on Steve's face or the kid's near infectious excitement—Tony feels like he's intruding on something private. Someone else's life. Someone else's dream.
So, this chapter is a bit shorter than what you guys might be used to from me, but I feel like it was better this way, rather than trying to cram a bunch of things into it, given how intense the last chapter was. Not too much to say, except I changed the chapter count again, so make of that what you will.
Steve's thumb becomes his pointer and middle fingers. Tony sucks them, lathing at them with his tongue until they're slick and glistening when Steve withdraws them from his mouth.
Tony gasps when Steve takes him into his mouth. It’s a struggle not to come right there, down Steve’s throat, but who could blame him? This was years of adolescent fantasies coming to life.
“Hey, stranger,” Tony says softly when they break apart for air. “I feel like I haven’t seen you in forever. Thought you went ghost on me.”
About halfway through the movie, he grows tired of Tony’s unending stiffness. He just wants Tony to be comfortable. He says so, leaning close to Tony to whisper in his ear. “I’m not gonna bite.”
“This is a new level of lame,” Pepper said and—oh no. Her hands were on her hips. She was mad. She was really mad.
is in good hands, and Rhodey can take over for him on the team, and he can live in his workshop like Gollum in his cave—
Only four HYDRA agents remain standing when they finally surrender. The rest lie, unmoving, the smell of blood and sweat and burned skin filling the room like a sickly perfume.
Steve could see the signs clearly because they were also a part of him. The trouble sleeping, the jumpiness, the hyper-vigilance. Tony had some form of post-traumatic stress. And if he continued down this route, it was only going to get worse. If Steve’s memory served him right, it
"Is something the matter, my prince?" Tony asked with an innocent look that Steve didn't believe for one second.
“What the hell are you two talking about?” Natasha asks, looking at both of them. "Not all of us have a telepathic connection with each other."
Y'all. This chapter felt like the mental equivalent of me beating my head against the wall. For the life of me, my brain could not write this chapter in a reasonable amount of time. But it's finally done, it's here, and it can stop being a pain in my ass. This one is a bit of a sweeter chapter but don't worry if you're a fan of angstier or smuttier chapters. Chapter 5 is going to have plenty of both 😉
Clint and Natasha had only dropped by the tower occasionally, stopping in between missions for a few nights of rest before disappearing off to who knew where in the early morning. No, it had just been him, Bruce, and Steve.
And with that, Steve truly began to fuck Tony’s mouth. Tony relaxed his throat, breathing through his nose with ease as Steve settled into a brisk, brutal rhythm. Having already gotten Tony off, Steve only sought to seek his own pleasure, his cock plunging in and out of Tony’s mouth roughly. God, the
There’s a small but up to date kitchenette off to their right done up in polished mahogany, tan stone, and black appliances for whenever hunger strikes. Tony heads to the left with Steve following behind him. His living area also functions as a bedroom of sorts. Tony had invested in a plush brown leather sofa from a high-end Italian furniture manufacturer. Sinfully soft and draped in luxurious throw blankets, it served as both a sofa and his bed when he couldn’t be bothered to take the elevator to his penthouse suite.
He leans down to whisper something into Tony's ear that sends heat traveling to his core. Tony wants nothing more than to find the nearest flat surface so Steve can fulfill his promise.
“Killian,” Tony said. Aldrich Killian. The name sounded annoyingly familiar but it seemed like the harder Tony tried to remember him, the more the face seemed to fade from his mind. “No, I don’t remember that guy.”
Steve pursed his lips like he was biting back a smile. “I’ll let you guess,” he murmured before closing the gap between them.
Hill huffs out a breath in what he assumes is a SHIELD agent’s version of a laugh. “Will that be all, Mr. Stark?”
“Listen,” Rhodey said under his breath. “The Pentagon is scared. After what happened in New York…aliens, I mean come on—”
“What?” Happy asked. “You know, look, I have a real job, Tony. I’m working, I got something going on here.”
Steve chuckled then propped his elbows up on the table to rest his head in his hands. He was okay. He was okay. He was okay.
“Yes, I need you to count with me, soldier. Try counting to ten with me, alright? And focus on your breathing. One.”
As soon as he speaks, Thor comes back into the command center, his face grave. "There's something you should see."
. His suit, now unzipped to his navel, only showed a sliver of Tony’s torso. The edges of Tony’s nipples poked out of the opening, both nipples peaking in the cool air of the office. He turned to face Steve head on and awaited further instructions.
At that, Steve let out what had to be the first genuine laugh he had had in a long time. “No need to explain yourself. Stark has a way with words, I’ll give him that.”
"Just fine," he says, smiling in a way that surely made him seem manic. "Just swallowed the wrong way is all." He was going to
. It's painful looking at him. Sometimes it feels like his heart's gonna swell up and pop right out of his chest when he looks at Steve.
One more dance,” he acquiesced. And if one more dance turned into two, then three, then four, well it was nobody’s business but theirs in the end, really.
“Tony, you of all people definitely deserve happiness and I want that for you so bad, but going to Malibu…call it a gut feeling but I don’t think that’s gonna end well.”
All the tables along the walls had been filled, leaving Tony and Rhodey to sit in the center of the restaurant. Tony could feel everyone’s eyes on him and Rhodey like they were bacteria meant to be examined under a microscope. He knew that he could say something and everyone’s eyes would snap away from them but then he’d look like the bad guy. He supposed it was fine seeing as everyone had been keeping their distance, although that still didn’t stop a prickling sensation from crawling up and down his neck.
“Hm.” Thor turns to look at Bruce, who looked surprisingly (and thankfully) content with himself. “Would you like to ride with me, Doctor Banner?”
Had it not been for the serum, he’s sure he wouldn’t have been able to pay attention to the movie (which he’s enjoying so far, Elle’s likable and relatable; Steve knows all too well what it’s like to be judged based off his appearance) and the feeling of Tony’s body pressed against his own. He’s hyper-aware of Tony’s presence. His heart rate accelerates every time Steve shifts to get more comfortable, his thigh rubbing against Tony’s. He can smell the remnants of Tony’s cologne, something bright and uplifting just like its wearer.
They stripped and bathed beside the stream, dumping water over each other's bodies with cupped hands. He supposed he should have felt shame as Tony unashamedly observed his body, but what was there to be ashamed of? Bathing each other felt as natural as breathing. When they were sufficiently clean, they found a patch of grass to lie in as the sun dried their bodies and Tony's trousers.
"Nope, too late," Clint says, shrugging his shirt on over the long sleeve he had been wearing. "I've already grown attached.”
, but something in him hesitates. It’s not guilt that makes him rise up from his table outside of the quaint little coffee shop, nor is it pity. Tony can’t
When this…thing between them had first started, Tony had fully expected that we was going to choke on Steve’s cock. And not in the fun way. Although, the first time Tony had blown him, Steve had been surprisingly gentle as opposed to their heated, damn near vicious kisses, keeping a firm but almost kind hand on the back of Tony’s head as Tony had taken on as much of him as he could. Despite lacking the ferocity that had decidedly marked every other one of their past encounters, Steve had still come that first time, his fingers tugging at Tony’s hair.
“Or better yet, tell me,” Tony finds himself saying. Four pairs of eyes shoot to him. If he were a lesser man, he would have wilted under the sudden attention. “I’ve got a bone to pick with Reindeer Games, too.”
Turning to the left, Natasha looking a vision in white, her red-and-blonde hair hanging loosely around her shoulders, gave him a beatific smile and Steve’s heart
This was Steve’s life now. And he was thankful for the small moment of peace, no matter how brief it would be. It may have only been 2012, but Steve knew something much bigger than any of them could comprehend was coming. And he would be ready. He would have to be.
Part of Tony wants to latch onto his arm, pull him through the glass and the rubble of his penthouse suite, and into his bedroom and never let him go. He stomps that urge down with steel-toed boots.
Steve’s cock looked thick, even wrapped in his large hand. The tip, wet with pre-come, was positively
“I have to say I didn’t see that coming.” Natasha’s voice dropped, “But Captain…there’s always a place for you at SHIELD if you want it.”
Comments, kudos, and bookmarks are much appreciated. I always love seeing your guys' reactions even if it's just a string of emojis. Truly, they make my day.
Tony should tell him. He should tell Steve he loves him, but something holds him back. He doesn't want Steve to think it was just a spur of the moment ordeal. He wants Steve to be sure that he loves him, that his soul has completely intertwined with Steve's, that they're
," he thinks. He hopes that maybe she'll loosen up by the end of the day, preferably without anyone getting hurt.
Rhodey and Obadiah stand beside him as they lower his parents' caskets into the fresh upturned earth and shield him from the view of the gaggle of reporters who had somehow made their way into the funeral and buzz around him like incessant flies.
The man, from the glimpse he’d gotten of him anyway, had been handsome, but Steve was still a prince. He had an obligation to his father and to Brooke itself to do his duty.
"Right," he says. "Right." He came for SHIELD secrets; cover stories, mission files, safe houses, that sort of thing. It takes JARVIS no time at all to hack into HYDRA's system.
That wouldn’t do. Tony, while working out, had already come out with three new ideas to improve Mark 42 and if he stopped now, he’d lose all his progress.
Steve knows when he’s beaten; “Fair enough, genius. I know that’s soda bread,” he says, gesturing to the loaf sitting on the counter. “But what else did you cook?”
Steve sets his tablet down. "What we're going to do," he says, his voice colder than Tony's ever heard it, "is go for the head."
One night they had been plowing their way through their list and Tony had fallen asleep about halfway through
Thor had never even gotten the chance to stay a night at the tower, instead still on the hunt for Loki. The thought of Loki on the loose, with the Tesseract no less, left a bitter taste in his mouth. He had had limited contact with the demigod, but the next time he saw him it would be too soon.
“It would be nice to have a place to crash in between missions,” Clint said. “Why not. Maybe living with you won’t be a total nightmare.”
fine; his heart was a battering ram, banging against his ribcage with a skull rattling force that had Tony wheezing.
"They're cozy," Steve says, taking a seat at the island that divides the rest of Tony's private floor from his kitchen. "They're free, and bunnies are cute. What's not to like?"
“Your Highness, my Lord,” Robb said, bowing at Steve, then Bucky. “The courtesan as you requested has arrived.”
Rumlow’s slow perusal of Tony’s body had Steve clenching his fists. He would not intervene. He would not intervene. He would not—
"Natasha is hilarious," Tony admits. He never thought that a ruthless assassin would also be a relentless prankster, but it explained why she got on so well with Clint. She didn't curb the archer's mischievous streak. She
She waved her fingers lazily and her teacup refilled itself (black tea this time with a dollop of honey).
They had had their faults, sure, but when it truly mattered, he and the other original Avengers had worked together so seamlessly during the Battle of New York. They had played off of each others strengths, had used their intuition to take out as many Chitauri as possible. He remembered as they had circled up for that very first time, that he hadn’t felt more alive since before the ice. For a moment, the tension and petty arguments on the Helicarrier had been swept to the side, and they had been a
“Yesss,” Tony drew the word out. “I missed you and your fingers stretching me out and your dirty fucking mouth.”
Tony wipes himself down and gets dressed in record time. He's not going back to sleep anytime soon, and he's caught up on all of his projects for SI and the Avengers themselves. If he's being honest with himself, which happens once in a blue moon, he needs some comfort. When he leaves his workshop, in a strange sense of deja vu, he finds Steve waiting for him, almost like he was summoned by Tony. Steve's hair is mussed; he looks like he woke up in the middle of the night too. He's leaning against the wall, looking cool and mysterious...that is if it weren't for the fuzzy bunny slippers currently dominating his feet.
Rhodey stays when Sunset Bain works her deadly magic on Tony and sinks her claw-like nails into his back, taking his dignity and Stark Industries secrets with her.
Steve’s eyes darken, and Tony practically drags him out of the gym, their hands still clutched together.
On the day of their last midterm, Tony makes three batches of candied yams. The first batch he made, he didn’t let cook long enough and the sweet potato slices crunch in his mouth and taste vaguely of carrots instead of the cinnamony confection Rhodey had described. His second batch, he overcooks, the potatoes turning to mush in the pan. Right when he’s ready to give up, angry tears welling in the corners of his eyes, Rhodey pokes his head into the kitchen.
He sipped delicately at his wine while Steve sputtered out an answer like a fool. “Servants are—you’re not—“
“I’m sorry,” Steve says. He captures Tony’s other hand and brings it to his lips. Tony would be lying if he said he wasn’t close to swooning. “I know we haven’t seen each other in a while—“
Happy, Tony decided, was a lost cause. Taking matters into his own hands, Tony pulled up a web page on his phone. With one hand, Tony typed in the name “Aldrich Killian”. Hundreds of news articles popped up instantly. As Tony scrolled, he picked up bits and pieces of info here and there.
“You heard your friend,” the courtesan continued. “Lay the boy to rest.” The courtesan’s eyes skated down Steve’s body, leaving him feeling strangely bare. “Let the man rise.”
Tony's being unmade. He's unraveling at the seams like a worn-out sweater, and Steve's stitching him back together.
“Gods!” Steve jumped and whirled around to face the source of the voice, dropping his waterskin in the process.
Tony's not going to argue with her, mostly since the others have stopped talking amongst themselves and are looking
, like he hadn’t come at all. He and Steve had always talked about seeing how far they could go while in the heat of the moment, but they never truly attempted…
Steve shrugged, suddenly uncomfortable. Tony had just taken him to unimaginable heights of pleasure. The least he could do was be courteous. "It's the least I could do," he voiced his thoughts. And Tony took his hand.
His heart speeds up, and he's not sure if it's from adrenaline or if he's still recovering from that mindblowing orgasm or something
“I lost him, ma’am. He was trying to make a quick escape. Didn’t even go for the scepter.” After spending so many years around spies and assassins, the lies came more easily to him than they had ever had.
Sorry, I took a while with this chapter, but hopefully, y'all still enjoyed it. Don't be afraid to let me know what you think! Comments, kudos, bookmarks, etc. are much appreciated.
“Alright,” Tony says. “Just give me a second.” He carefully reassembles the HYDRA gun and locks it away far from Hill’s too-observant-for-her-own-good eyes.
“I’m fine, Na…Miss Romanoff.” God, he forgot he hadn’t started calling her Nat until after they had started going on missions together. He had been so
And so here they were, in the Shawarma Palace (self-proclaimed shawarma capital of all of Manhattan), sitting around the exact table Steve had sat at with them eleven years ago. Or now? He still couldn’t wrap his head around the mechanics of time travel.
Steve punches in said code with his knuckles, his other hand too busy balancing a plate of spaghetti. He makes himself known, knocking on the door frame, and walks in, his footsteps purposefully loud. Tony hates when people sneak up on him.
"I'm fine, just disoriented," Tony says, which is the truth. The snow broke most of the fall. Aside from a few minor cuts and bruises, he's alright. It's not the worst mission he's been on. Yet.
Pepper raises her hands. “Just throwing it out there. Again, you need a break. And think of the kids when they see your faces.”
“I’m yours," Tony cried out. “Fuck, Steve, I’ll always be yours.” And it was the truth. There could not,
And just like that, the Avengers have won Carmen over forever. And Tony didn't even have to make any threats. Maybe today won't be a disaster after all.
When Steve's hand strokes his cheek and comes away wet, Tony realizes that he's crying. Steve kisses his cheeks and his forehead and his nose, and when he finally goes for Tony's mouth, Tony lets out the softest, "Thank you."
“That’s a, uh, very good question. I got a team of guys though, who’re going to come in tomorrow and blow out that wall.”
By the time Tony gets an all-clear from the medics, all he wants is to take a nice, scalding shower, and he does just that.
“Yes," Tony slurred out. "Missed you so fucking much. Harder,” Tony slurred out. “Please, I want…I need—“
Carmen tilts her head at him like she used to whenever she thought he had said something stupid. "You're telling me that those five supermodels you call teammates just came here for shits and giggles?"
“But he never spoke of what you looked like when you came,” Steve continued. Steve titled his head looking so much like a golden retriever, had Tony not been so drained, he would’ve told the man how cute he looked.
“Who said you could come early,” Tony says, but he’s all smiles. Steve can’t help but smile back as he shakes away his shock, his nerves and steps closer to the genius.
“One day,” Steve says, picking up speed. “One day, I’m gonna tie you to your bed just like this. Get your thighs all wet and slick and
He had the feeling that she knew he was holding back, nothing got past her after all, but she didn’t needle him about it either.
That had gotten a few chuckles of them. AJ’s grey eyes seemed to brighten as she took in their laughter. “You guys actually laughed!” She said ecstatically. “You would not
“Isn’t that more Clint’s move?” Steve asked, wiping away stray tears. Little chuckles still escaped him every now and then at the sight of Tony pouting. God, he looked like an angry kitten.
“That’s why I said I got it,” Tony snapped. When Tony looked down, he had crushed the crayon into two. The rushing in his ears got even louder. Tony placed a hand over his face and closed his eyes.
Natasha had looked into the past of the poor girl they had found flayed and charred beyond recognition.
“Candied yams?” Tony asks. The name evokes feelings of joy and sugar and well, Tony’s always had sweet tooth. His interest is piqued.
The headache was building again. His hands flew to his temples, briefcase falling to the ground, forgotten. Steve fell to his knees, clutching at his skull. Something was burrowing
“Knock yourself out,” he said, holding back a grin. Tony had asked him the exact same thing the first time around. He just couldn’t hold himself back around any nice machinery, and if that had been exactly why Steve decided to take his bike today, then who was going to judge him?
“Clint, I once saw you pour coffee into a bowl of cereal and call it breakfast soup,” Tony had said in disbelief, “and you want a dog?”
“Hmm,” AJ had said. “I’m seeing a lot of soldiers on that left side. Is that what you think people see you as? A soldier?
Dinner ends quickly after that, the others petering off until it's just Steve and Tony left sitting at the table.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes had proved himself to be just as fun as his best friend and the three of them found themselves near inseparable because of it. Rhodey was just as smart and just as funny as Tony and when the three of them were together, somewhere on the opposite side of the country Pepper Potts felt a migraine forming.
” he thinks. The sky is a soft pale blue that soothes his heart. Cirrus clouds, like pulled apart cotton candy, lazily make their way across the horizon. Maybe after the carnival is over, he’ll take the suit out for a ride and cruise through the skies.
Being with Steve...is not like that. If the others are a fireplace, then Steve is a wildfire. Tony knows that he'll end up burned if he gets too close, but he can’t help but be drawn in by his light anyway.
A strange feeling akin to fear took root in Steve’s heart at the sight. Peter looked at Steve like his life rested in his hands. Just how many more of his servants, his
“Alright, I don’t work for you. Now, I don’t trust this guy. He’s got another guy with him, he’s shifty,” Happy said, his voice cutting into Tony’s perusal of Killian.
He returned their greeting, dismounted, and led his horse to the stablehands currently keeping watch over the other's horses.
Thor chuckles, some of the fierceness in his stance deteriorating. "He's alright," Thor says. "He can still joke."
Steve's shivers. Tony doesn't know if it's from the shower or if it's the thought of Tony's heart stopping. Either way, it's time for them to get out. If they stay in here any longer, they'll shrivel up like raisins.
“You’d like that wouldn’t you, all fucked out and leaking my come,” Steve said. He pulled out slowly, his cock dragging against Tony’s prostate in a way that had him curling his toes.
As they swayed together, the dulcet tones of the jazzy record wrapping around them, Peggy leaning into him, Steve could almost pretend that this was his life. That he had never let Bucky fall. That he had defeated the Red Skull before they both could even step foot on the
Rhodey’s grin quickly melts from his face and is replaced with a look of utter terror as 120 pounds of pure spite land on him with the deftness of jungle cat.
“Fuck, Steve. Quit teasing me, alright? I need you inside me like yesterday,” Tony said, admitting defeat. Steve had been gone for too long and Tony had slept all alone in that big bed, clutching Steve’s pillow to his chest just to get a whiff of his scent. He needed to be sure that Steve was here and he wasn’t going anywhere.
“Before you go,” Tony began. “There’s space at Stark Tower if you ever need a place to crash. For all of you, actually.”
“I want you in my mouth too,” Tony admitted. “I want you to make me gag and I want your come sliding down my throat.”
And so Tony cooks. His head spins the entire time and his hands tremble as he flips the omelette and everything down to his marrow is screaming.
. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. Me? I’m just a man in a can,” he said. It was like now that he had started, he couldn’t be stopped and everything that he had been holding in for the past four months came rushing out of his mouth. “The only reason I haven’t cracked up is probably because we moved in together. Which is great. I love you, I’m lucky. But honey,” Tony took Pepper’s hands in his own. “I can’t sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker.” Tony paused. “But threat…threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can’t live without.” He pointed at Pepper’s heart. “That’s you. And my suits, they’re—”
So…is this something y’all would be interested in reading? I have a lot of ideas in my head right now but it’d be cool to know that there’s an audience for it. Comments, kudos, and bookmarks aren’t required but are much appreciated!
“The man jumps out of planes without parachutes, Pep,” Tony had said, astonished. “If anything, he’s a bad influence!”
"Are you guys coming, or are you just going to gaze into each other's eyes?" Clint shouts from the next booth over.
“We did. There were losses, yes. There’s always losses, Steve. But you look past them. You move on. You find peace for yourself.”
“Thank you, sire,” Peter said once he had finished his bread. “Not many…not many lords would have done that.”
. Tony belonged to Steve. It hadn’t been explicitly stated, but Tony hadn’t so much as gone on a date ever since they started their little rendezvous, and he’d bet his billions that Steve had done the same.
He followed Tony’s instructions down to the very last word, and Tony turned the key in the ignition. “Start your engine,” Tony said.
had been the one to do this to Steve. Pressing soft, open-mouthed kisses along the length of Steve’s cock, the super-soldier’s grip on his office chair so tight, Tony was sure he was going to rip the leather. Tony licked long wet stripes up and down Steve’s cock, occasionally on every upstroke circling his agile tongue along the head.
"In your dreams," Tony says. Thor lets go of Tony when they're safe to land. Tony rolls into the fall, landing in a crouch. The HYDRA gunman spots them, but before they can pull their handgun sitting at their waist, Tony's already fired two blasts from his repulsor, sending them flying. Thor sends Mjolnir flying through the machine gun, shattering it into hundreds of metal shards sparking and sputtering like the last embers of a fire.
“We needed Bruce to operate the machine, ma’am,” he said, extending the briefcase to her. “The Time Stone.” His hand trembled as he opened the case.
“Are you sure? Survivor’s guilt. Panic attacks. Avoidance. That all sounds relatable to me,” she said, sipping primly at her tea. “Just because you came about your trauma in a more unique way than others doesn’t make it any more or less valid.”
,” Tony says. “I spent all evening working on this meal and I’ll be damned if it goes to waste, Rogers.”
Bruce speaks up. "What if we approach from the west? It looks like there's a pretty dense forest; we could use it for coverage."
“Spangles, what the hell are you doing?” Tony yelped when Steve bodily picked him up and tossed him over his shoulder as if he weighed nothing.
on Tony, until there’s no doubt that Tony belongs to him in a way he has only ever belonged to himself.
“I don’t want that dog anywhere near my workshop!” Tony had said to Steve who had been too busy giving Dodger belly rubs.
For once, he had the time and the materials and the semi-peace of mind to draw again and Steve found himself drawing anything and everything. From simple reference drawings of things like bowls of fruit or the silhouette of the tower against the Manhattan skyline, to memories from the other timeline, smudged at the edges, their was always one constant figure in Steve’s drawings; Tony. Tony wrapped up in his Iron Man blanket and Tony with eye bags and dark circles and Tony with sunglasses and sharp Tom Ford suits; it seemed as if every other page was dedicated to Tony. But how could Steve
"I left because I couldn't lie to them anymore. It's only so long I can play the role of the perfect prince. Sometimes...I just want to be Steve."
Thankfully, Steve understood him; his hips met Tony’s with a satisfying smack. “I’m gonna take a leave of absence. So I can be right where I fucking
than his trauma. The concept was damn near foreign to him. For so long, Steve’s identity had been Captain America, the ideal man, the perfect soldier, and to think that it didn’t have to be the only important thing about him didn’t even cross his mind.
It’s moments like these, when the music they put on to drown out the sound of their moans is too loud, and Steve is clutching at Tony’s hips like he’ll disappear into thin air if he doesn’t hold on, are when Tony wants to say, “I love you,” again.
"And you're not fighting alone. You never did. You had the Commandos," Tony says. He doesn't know where he's going with this, but he'll do anything to take that grimace off of Steve's face.
Pepper padded over to him now, concern blooming on her face. The anger was still there, he could see it in her eyes, but at least she was willing to listen.
Steve, with his hair glistening like a halo, his skin slick and golden. On his knees, practically worshipping Tony like a suppliant at the altar.
“It’s older than Cap,” Natasha throws in helpfully, smirking at Steve when he shoots her an exasperated look.
Steve poked his head out from underneath his blanket, a frown marring his features. “He didn’t tell me anything of a hunt. And why so early?”
With shaky fingers, Tony continued to unzip his tac suit only stopping to shrug off his shoulder holster. The leather holster dropped harmlessly to the floor with a light
A fierce jolt of pride runs through him at the sight of Natasha and Clint wielding the batons and bow he made for them specifically, and he fights with a renewed sense of purpose. The HYDRA agents storm them all at once, but what's fifty men and women to six pissed off Avengers?
Dropping their towels, they slide into bed together, tossing and turning until they’re somewhat comfortable, both of them unused to sharing a bed after being alone for so long. Tony curls up into Steve's side, tangling their legs together. Steve's hands stay at his sides, not pulling Tony close but not pushing him away either, making his stomach twist.
. I'll also put a content warning at the beginning of the chapter that the sex scene will be in so those of you who aren't into smut won't be subjected to it. For those of you who do enjoy smut, I literally already have the scene written out and it's a good one.
Natasha rolled her eyes, but he saw a familiar glint in them that after years of knowing her, knew it meant she was amused by something. “Stark. He’s determined on trying shawarma. Says he’ll die without it.”
Tony lifted his head up from Steve’s thigh to gaze up at him. The super-soldier looked all too smug for someone who hadn’t even come yet, a cocky smirk gracing his face. “Let me show you,” Tony said and finally,
“Because I’m bisexual and have no sense of self-preservation. It’s why we’re friends,” she had chirped.
Tony doesn't want to put him on the spot, but he knows Bruce will just try his best to brush his problems under the rug.
"A ground assault would be suicide," Tony says, rising from his seat to take a closer look at the hologram. Steve moves over, making room for Tony to stand beside him. "They could have bunkers, watchguards, tanks, the works. We'd be fish in a barrel."
His break comes faster than he wants it to, but he has to take one eventually and decides the best way to do that is to take a walk. His fellow volunteer, a young man named Jake, says he'll be able to hold down the fort while Tony's gone. Maybe Tony will check on the others, see how they're faring.
“I figured I’d take you up on your offer,” he said, looking Tony in his eyes. At least he tried to. Those sunglasses were damn near impenetrable. “That’s if I’m welcome, of course. Wouldn’t want to intrude.”
He plopped down in the chair across from Bucky and poured himself a glass of wine, having dismissed his personal attendant for some privacy with Bucky.
Steve groaned, his hands hovering in the air, for he knew the second he gave into temptation and laid his hands on Tony, it would be the end of him.
Steve’s the one who breaks the silence, clearing his throat before he speaks. “Tony,” he begins. His voice is rough, unsure like he doesn’t know what he wants to say exactly.
The genuine confusion in Tony’s voice broke his heart. Did he honestly think no one could do something nice for him without expecting something in return?
He doesn’t want there to be any distance between him and Steve, wants to press against him until he can’t tell where they begin and end.
She took a sip from her own cup, and the two of them settled into a peaceful silence. They were sitting in a study of some sort, done up almost entirely in dark wood paneling. Their table was situated right next to a grand window. Through the window, Steve had a nice view of a nearby park. He could see joggers going on their morning runs, a young couple enjoying a nice picnic, an old man taking a stroll through a grove of trees. Normal people going about their normal lives.
Steve tossed Tony onto the couch (gently, might he add) but given the way Tony screamed as he sailed through the air, one would’ve assumed he had thrown the man across the room. “Goodnight, Supreme Overlord Stark.”
Tony has to give it to Steve. At least he had enough sense to dye his hair. A small part of him hates how the dark color suits him. An even smaller part misses the way his hair glinted like beaten gold in the morning sun.
Natasha and Clint had bullied Tony into letting them host movie night in Tony’s penthouse, and they had held them there ever since. The downside to that was there was only so much seating available. At first, there had only been a sofa, more for aesthetics than comfort, but with the advent of their movie nights, Tony had swapped the sofa out for something a little softer and an armchair and loveseat to match. Enough to fit six people, not nine.
She's crossing things off on her clipboard when Tony and the Avengers following behind him pull up in front of her.
“Forget about him,” Tony said. “It’s still your day, and I, for one, am ready to see the rest of Brooke’s famous game park. What are we waiting for?”
“Don’t do that,” Rhodey says, voice slightly muffled from the pillow he has resting over his face. “It’s your best feature.”
“Don’t run,” Steve says. His arms wind around Tony’s waist with all the finality of a lock clicking into place.
"I think I like you like this," Steve says instead, pressing his fingers into the meat of Tony's thighs. A shiver runs down Tony's spine at the hungry look in Steve's eyes.
Steve rested his head against Tony’s. His breath came out in pants, and goosebumps flared up and down Tony’s neck. Tony felt sleepy and like he was floating on a cloud all at once.
“Such sass. Do you hear this?” Tony asked, turning to Steve, finally giving up on reaching the grounds. “JARVIS went all Skynet on me. Wait, you don’t understand that reference, do you?”
When the debriefing is adjourned, he comes away with three things. First, someone ratted them out. Second, if someone ratted them out, then SHIELD was still compromised. Third, HYDRA was messing with human experimentation.
"No." Like an idiot. It's not that he hadn't wanted to go; it was just that between SI and Avengers business and—
He knows enough about trauma and its effects on brain processes to know that, but it still doesn't make it any easier to accept. He wants to be better, and he wants to be better
It’s not like Tony was unfamiliar with anxiety attacks. Hell, he had helped Steve come down from one. But Steve was a soldier who had fought in one of the most brutal wars known to mankind, only to wake up in entirely new century where nearly all of his loved ones were dead. If anyone was going to be having anxiety attacks, it was Steve. And Tony…Tony was a Stark.
He's not the type to place too much stock in dreams. He works better with numbers and facts, always has, and the facts tell him that Steve Rogers is a good man.
Steve starts Tony out slow, with only one thick finger working its way inside of him. The stretch, while familiar, takes some getting used to. It'd been so long since he'd truly been with another man.
“Yeah, there’s a giant brain, there’s a shifty character.” Happy shifted in his seat. “I’m gonna follow this guy. I’m gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it.”
"Natasha thinks she's funny," Steve says. His voice is deep and burly, still syrupy thick with sleep.
“I’m going to finish my report,” Steve murmured, “and you’re going to sit on my cock like a good slut. And maybe, if you do what you’re told, I’ll fuck you just like you need. It’s up to you.”
Steve cut Tony off before he could finish, working a third finger into Tony. His fingers were already so thick, it wasn’t fair that Steve knew just how to work them to leave Tony a trembling mess.
Their first assignment was a simple one, given that not many of them aside from Steve had much experience with art.
“You know what?” Happy started. “You should take more of an interest in what’s going on here. This woman…this woman’s the best thing that ever happened to you, and you…you’re just ignoring her.”

“Okay,” Steve says. His voice is softer than Tony’s ever heard it. It strikes a chord within him, like an electric shock directly to his core, leaving him exposed and bleeding.
“I’m not going to let that happen,” Steve whispers with a fierceness to his voice. Steve frees one hand and grabs hold of Tony’s chin, forcing him to meet his gaze. “You hear me? I’d die before I’d let them get to you. To any of you.”
Tony groaned. “God, I’m sorry, Steve. I swear I didn’t mean to stand you up.” He sat back down on his workbench, cupping his forehead with one of his hands. “This goddamn gauntlet has been giving me trouble all night.”
"Why did you follow me?" Steve asked, cutting all pretenses. He had wanted to be alone, and being in such close proximity with Tony without the curious gazes of the others left him unsure of his next move.
. The mists permeating the land seemed to part for him as he made his way up the summit of a cliff. Two towering pillars of rock interrupted the otherwise monotonous horizon he had grown accustomed to and Steve knew deep in his soul that this is where Natasha had died. The urge to breakdown and sob hit him with a quickness and he came to a stop. He wanted to fling the briefcase off that very same cliff or crush all of the stones in his fists for taking everything and everyone away from him.
“I…I had to force your current conscience into your younger self’s body…it was the only way,” she said quietly.
wasn't the most dangerous mission he had carried out? Returning the stones should have been easier than retrieving them in the first place.
"The sins of the father shouldn't fall upon the son," he says. "Howard wasn't daddy dearest, either."
“I don’t think you’re,” Tony began before suddenly pausing. “Did you just say fuddy-duddy or did I hallucinate that? It’s very possible I could have hallucinated that. I haven’t slept in 36 hours.”
Steve dove into his pasta, shoving a forkful into his mouth before he could say anything else embarrassing.
They come together, oddly enough. Steve’s teeth sink into Tony’s throat, and Tony’s throwing his head back as his come lands on both of their stomachs, and it’s so. Fucking.
A stray tear trailed down his cheek and as Peggy tilted her head up to kiss him, he could taste salt and a hint of something sweet. Something that reminded him of honey.
It's just four words, but it's enough to make Tony blush. He facepalms, under the pretense of annoyance at something one of the others had said.
of pretending Tony wasn’t one of his closest friends. At this point, so what? They lived in a world of Norse gods and Mad Titans, if Tony and the others found out about what had happened to him, what were they going to do, deny time travel existed?
. Life wasn’t kind because in the middle of the night, Happy Hogan had been caught in the crossfire of an explosion in the heart of Hollywood. No, life wasn’t sweet, nor was it kind. And Tony had the sick feeling that it wouldn’t be for a long time.
Tony was making excuses. Even he could see that. Hook-ups? Hook-ups Tony could do, specialized in, even, but Steve's question had ventured dangerously into "date" territory. The last time Tony had tried to seriously date was when he was with Pepper, and that had been a piping hot mess in the end.
Pepper looked over her shoulder at the suit, her strawberry blonde hair swishing with the movement, and winked. “I’ll take my chances.”
Tony's voice startled him out of his reverie. "What about when you're with me? Do you feel like you're playing a role then?"
He wants Steve to fuck him already. Tony can hardly take this slow gentle pace they’ve settled into and voices his displeasure.
Instead, Tony curls a hand around the outdated, clunky flip phone tucked into the pocket of his hoodie and asks him, “What are you doing here, Rogers?”
Brad Pitt), but Steve is the literal epitome of human perfection. It could just be the childhood trauma rearing its ugly head, but Tony feels small underneath Steve. Unworthy. Useless. He’s thrown back to the present when Steve rolls his hips and slides his cock against Tony’s.
Finding homes for the other dogs had gone smoothly, with two Stark Industries employees taking home one a piece and Clint, surprisingly, taking the last pup.
Carmen Solomita was an old friend from his prep school years. A fellow gifted kid, and the daughter of the iconic Italian husband-wife fashion designer duo, Isabela and Marcello Solomita, it was a no brainer that Tony and Carmen would become friends.
“I should tell you to go to sleep,” Pepper says, sighing. “But I miss the sound of your voice too much.” She’s sitting at the island, a cup of coffee in hand. She had pulled her hair into a bun and still has her reading glasses on, the red ones that she hates because she thinks she looks like someone's grandmother.
Tony closes his eyes. He knew the conversation was coming, but he hoped they’d at least have a day to regroup. He’s had the conversation plenty of times with Pepper, with Rhodey, even with Happy. He’ll hear Steve out, but the second Steve even hints at Tony quitting as Iron Man, he’s digging his feet into the proverbial sand.
"I can explain!" He throws his hands up to stop Rhodey's lecture in its tracks. "Someone at SHIELD knew when we were going to strike on the HYDRA base."
“Look for the choke,” Tony said. “Once you find it, open it. Keep the throttle closed otherwise you’ll flood the engine.”
“It’s a carnival classic,” Clint says. “It’s a giant wheel that lifts you into the air. Perfect way to end the day.”
“Do it later, Point Break. You look one thunder bolt away from passing out. Besides, I’m starving, and nothing short of death is stopping me from eating.”
“Dodger won’t stop crying. I think he misses DUM-E,” Steve had said on one of the earlier voice-mails. “I guess playing fetch with me isn’t the same,” he had joked.
the puppy was commanding them to well up with tears. He observed the puppy more carefully and didn’t see what looked like bite marks or fleas but there was a definite gauntness to him that shouldn’t have been there. He looked so sad and hungry and looking at the other three pups in the box, all yipping pitifully, they were probably in the same sorry state.
“Look at you, bargaining,” he said with an tired chuckle, more a huff of air, really. “Tony would be proud.”
“SHIELD is going to continue their search on Earth, but I don’t know how any facial recognition software is going to help find a man who can change his appearance at will,” Clint said, crossing his arms in front of him.
to feel good either. Space and time tossed his body about like a leaf blowing carelessly through the wind. Dying stars and distant planets soared past him in bursts of color and sound. He was dying or being reborn or both, life and death tossing a coin in the air to choose. Steve activated the time bracelet and braced himself for impact. He landed deftly, the impact of his feet against the stone shocking his toes and jolting through his legs. He had made it to Vormir.
Man, this chapter had a lot going on, and I hope I executed it well. This was the first battle scene I've ever written so if it's a little clunky that's why. We're at the halfway point now (unless I change the chapter count again) so things are going to be picking up speed. Chapter 6 will be up...indefinitely. I'll try not to do a disappearing act on you guys.
“Tin man?” Tony bristled. Soon he and Clint were griping back and forth and it was such a familiar sight, Steve almost wanted to cry.
Hailey reach for a box sifting through the magazines until she found a few that were to her liking and got to work. Conversation had started out slowly at first, usually a murmur for scissors or someone whispering to pass them the glue. An indie song played softly on the bluetooth speaker AJ had brought with her; a woman’s light, breathy voice echoed around the room and Steve felt an ease within himself that he hadn’t felt in years as he idly flipped through magazines. AJ had also chosen some magazines but Steve could see her glance up every now and then to observe them. As they all searched for pictures, AJ had broken the silence with a question; “If you don’t mind me asking,” she said. “Aside from your doctor, what brought you all to art therapy?”
"Me neither," Tony says. "Howard...he'd tell me all these stories of Steve and the 'good old days'...Steve single-handedly storming a HYDRA facility. Throwing himself on a grenade to give others the chance to live. I always thought he was embellishing a little. Making war stories more digestible for a kid, you know? But seeing him,
Tony’s suddenly aware that they’re just standing there in their towels, nothing else separating them from seeing each other’s bodies. This time feels noticeably different from all the other times they’ve seen each other in the nude. It’s more than his body being laid bare. "Can you...can you stay with me?"
. Once again, the urge to throttle his younger self hit him. Of all people to accuse of pretending to be heroes, Steve had chosen one of the most heroic men he had ever met. Figures.
Bruce's voice jolted him out of his thoughts. They were ready for him. Bucky and Sam stood off to the side, looking at him with concerned eyes.
“No harm done,” Tony says coolly. On the inside, he’s trying not to scream. He had forgotten that Steve’s hands were so
A sigh of relief escaped him as he entered the main lobby of the tower, greeting Fred the receptionist with a quick nod, as a cool breeze washed over his body. Steve had to give it to the 21st century; air conditioning was literally a godsend. He entered the elevator swiftly, swiping the special key-card gifted to him by Tony that gave him access to the upper levels of the tower, and tugged at the collar of his shirt. All he had worn was a simple pair of jeans and a t-shirt, yet the sweat-soaked clothes clung to him like a second skin. His hair wasn’t any better, weighing down on his forehead and getting into his eyes.
Steve wanted to pull the both of them into a hug but he settled for a quick nod in return. He couldn’t be over familiar with them. Tony and Bruce may have not been super-spies, but they were geniuses in their own right and would pick up on his odd behavior if he were to act like he had known them for years.
He can't help but feel like there's a hidden meaning to her words, and knowing her, there is. She leaves before Tony can get the last word, her hair swaying with every step.
There’s something wet running down his neck and in the midst of his orgasm, Tony realizes Steve is crying too. He’s transported back to their first time, both of them reeling from the aftermath of a dangerous mission. Tony remembers that
end up having apple torte for dessert. As Jarvis tucks him into his bed, the smell of green apples and cinnamon linger on the air. That night, Tony dreams of hundreds of apple tortes falling from the sky. He thinks they
Except when Steve breaks their kiss to lift him up by his thighs and walk them over to his massive bed...when he lays Tony down gently like he's something precious...it doesn't feel like messing around anymore. Messing around put him in the mind of two teenagers fumbling around the backseat of a car, desperate to get themselves off and themselves only.
The impact still rattles his bones, and for an awful second, Tony swears his brain is shaking around in his skull. Whatever guns HYDRA were using
Ana passes on a beautiful summer day when Tony is fifteen, Jarvis following her soon after. Tony hangs up his apron and doesn’t pick it up again. Not for a while.
And as if spending the night alone after that god-awful nightmare wasn’t the worst part, in the morning, things weren’t better. Although the sun shone and the birds were chirping, life wasn’t
Superfriends. Is that what people were calling them? Colleagues, sure. Teammates, definitely. But friends…friends was a whole other ball park. Tony had thought for a minute that maybe something had been building between the six of them. But then life had gotten in the way. It always did.
