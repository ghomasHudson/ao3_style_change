"I wouldn't. So do you want to leave or stay?"
The tension at Pepper’s house had been soothed for the moment. The three of them sat at her coffee table trying to relax. Wine had taken the edge of Pepper and Maya, but Steve remained alert.
, but we're in a position where we can't be reckless. We have a daughter to consider. She needs us. This isn't instincts or hormones speaking, Tony. I'll do anything to protect my child! My priorities have changed. Yours should have too."
“Sure."
“What do you want for dinner?”
“Sorry about that,” he said.
“I miss you too.”
“I don’t know.”
Steve left the privacy of guest room. He toyed with the phone. If he wasn't careful he would reveal too much. She was his friend, hopefully, she wouldn’t pry too deeply. Steve took a breath before calling.
"It's on every channel," said Tony.
"Its summer. No one has class," said Steve. He regretted saying that because it seemed to only stress the pups. They needed some level of order and schedule. "We'll figure out something to do. We can go swimming. Does that sound fun?"
“Trying something new.”
Piper slowly started waking up. She gave a small cry. Steve picked her up, gently rocking her. She nuzzled against his chest. He put a blanket over his shoulder and took her to his chest. Steve relaxed into the chair, humming to her.
“Really?!”
"I'm up!"
“Thank you.”
“Alpha."
"Hm, what for?"
“Barack Obama the first African American President,” said Fury.
“I know. I, too, miss her.”
“Cyanide pill.”
Piper thought back on it, and named her terms. “An Austin-Healey Sprite Mark I.”
“You already had dinner.”
Piper shook, barely able to keep control. Something wilder threatened to overtake her. Another rippled of energy tore through, breaking her limited control. Her eyes ignited with blue light.
"In the simplest term. Your pup will be powerful. In mind and body. She'll do great things," she said.
He forced open the crate Dum-E and U. They could be repaired. He cracked open another box, pulling out Thor's blanket. The edges were singed but otherwise was fine. Steve would be happy that it survived. Another box contained Mark 5. Steve damaged it their fight. He placed on his workshop table. It was in terrible shape.
“Understood?”
“The conditions are not so good. There was a heavy snowfall so there’s a high chance of avalanche. So listen to what I say and we’ll get there safely,” said Fleur.
Steve looked in the backpack Natasha gave him. It held U.S passport and Brazilian money. When pulled open the drawer and saw a few days worth of clothes.
“And Dr. Bloom?” asked Steve.
“Will you go?” asked Tony.
“And I’m not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I’d like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D. is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction,” said Bruce.
“The baby?” asked Pepper.
He offered her his arm again. She searched for a control panel insertion point, moving behind him which caused him to turn to keep an eye on her. He moved, sitting with his back pressed against the wall. She found the insert and pushed her bobby pin into it. The panels lifting away revealing what was inside. She took stock of the work. The basic structure and functions she understood.
Steve wailed, clutching his heart.
“Piper,” said Steve.
Piper’s posture changed, lowering to a more aggressive stance. She growled lowly at the image.
Carpathian Mountains – has the largest population of brown bear in the EU. That’s why I used brown bears a threat.
“Yeah.”
He followed Tony to the garage. There was only one bike. It was a custom paint job gold and red. The bike was in an elegant older style with touches of modern design. He kneeled, getting a better look at the engine.
“No. Do we have any idea who he is?” asked Steve.
Cell-free fetal DNA – is fetal DNA which circulates freely in the maternal blood. It can be gathered from a simple blood sample.
“For someone who hates attention you made an odd choice for your boyfriend,” he said.
“I’ll let you figure out if they’re good are not,” said Rune.
“I can handle it,” he said.
“Boyfriend?” said Natasha.
“Of course, sir.”
“What do you mean?”
She tried following his request, but hunger outweighed her patience. Steve sighed accepting it. Maybe transitioning to the bottle wouldn't be a bad idea. When she was done, Steve put her in a yellow dress. The sunflower headband she wore stood out in her dark hair. He set her down on a blanket so she could play. Tony never was a big breakfast person, especially when he was jet-lagged, so Steve just ate two bagels.
“Uh, Shakespeare in the park. Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?”
“You really didn’t deserve him, Tony. It’s a shame I could have made him perfect.”
Breakfast came early. He moved in front as the tray was pushed through the slot. The pup was asleep. The smell of food woke her. He pushed the tray toward her, letting her eat first. She nudged it back to him.
“Four including the flight. What’s there that’s so important?”
"You really knew the man," said Tony.
He licked his lips.
“You sat with me like that the entire time,” said Steve.
He followed an omega nurse into an office.
“Then spill it,” said Tony.
“Didn’t you have a childhood friend?” asked Steve.
“Steve not Joe,” said Steve.
“An hour,” he said.
“No,” said Winter.
“Then shame on the both of you,” she said. Her playful expression took away some of the sting. “When will I get to meet the little darling?”
“Please, don’t be angry.”
“There’s something special about him that I haven’t felt with other children. We can give him a good life… and… I need to help him. I want you to meet him. Will you come here?
Steve took her hand delicately in his. “Are you alright?”
"You're welcome, pumpkin," he said.
“I made you a little something,” said Peggy.
“Too bad,” said Steve.
The alpha slowly backed down. Steve pushed down the blankets.
“And what we are! What makes me different?!”
At he was always honest. Blunt but well-intentioned. She'd take it over Lena's falsely sweet words any day. With Winter, she knew where she stood. He opened her hand, placing the large knife in her palm. The handle was well-worn from frequent use. Winter had taken great care in keeping it sharp. The blade itself was a bit more than six inches. It was too big.
He had to keep working. He had a family to protect. The suits would help keep them safe.
“You didn’t come here because I batted my eyelashes at you,” she said.
“What time is it?”
“WINTER!”
“Why?!”
"Perfect, your heart and lungs sound healthy," she said.
“Jarvis, how long until his heat starts?” asked Tony.
"Fury knew and he made you do this!"  He would personally rip the director a new for putting his omega and their unborn pup at risk.
"Will I be able to do that scary look you do?"
“Fuck.” Now he had to deal with that on top of a hangover. A hangover he could handle, but a potential fight with Steve no.
Tackling with an equal amount of strength. Rune shoved her away, shaking off the rubble. He smiled, grabbing a large barbell, shaking the hundred-pound plates from one end. It had been so long since he had actually faced a challenging opponent. Rune flung a plate at her, only for her to catch the high-speed disk and throw it right back at him.
He pulled away from her, wiping the mud from her face. "You have nothing to be sorry for," he said, cradling her.
Steve whimpered, begging him to come closer. He slowly strode toward the bed. Tony carefully ran his fingers over Steve’s stomach before his hand traveled lower to Steve’s leaking arousal. He breached him with his fingers and was welcomed by tight wet heat. They kissed stifled their moans.
"I was wondering when you were going to make an appearance, Rhodey."
In front of him was the machine, the source of his agony. There was nothing else he could do but accept his fate. He gave up, letting his head fall against the floor. A pair of polished dress shoes appeared at the forefront of his vision.
“To you too. Did Tony get back alright?"
Her wound had already healed.
Tony joined him on the couch. He rested his head on the alpha’s lap.
*****
"Tony, I'll be fine. If you get worried have Jarvis pull up the footage of me. I'm not going anywhere," said Steve.
“I know you will.”
He got started. Natasha worked on the sauce. Piper started pouting.
“Tony and Steve?” asked Hill.
There was a knock on the door.
“I didn’t mean to scare you. I’m sorry,” said Steve.
“On to the next bike then,” said Phil.
"The assignment takes priority," said Steve.
“It’s alright, sweetheart.”
“You aren’t the only one who’s broken,” said Steve.
"What?!"
As they walked toward their mystery destination it grew colder. Her breath began to fog. The tile floor grew painful cold against her bare feet. She didn’t ask for Lena to pick her up. No, she wouldn’t show that weakness. Soon she was shivering.
“Of course I could.”
“Never about that,” said Tony, caressing Steve’s cheek.
“How will this work?” asked Tony.
Steve shifted, so he rested on his back. He kept Alpha’s hand over his stomach. Steve so wanted to give alpha a pup. That would show challengers this alpha belonged to him. There would be challengers, considering how powerful Alpha was. He wouldn’t share. This alpha was his! He bared his neck to Alpha and whined.
“Most alphas your age already have pups,” she said.
“They like you,” said Piper.
“You been eating it for twenty-three days. Why is it an issue now?”
“Not here specifically, but where you were.”
“Let’s go home,” said Steve.
“Shh.”
“Want more?”
"No."
“Yeah, a bunch.”
“No.”
Thor nodded before taking off.
“Don’t know,” he said with a shrug.
“Frozen alive S.H.I.E.L.D defrosted me,” said Steve.
"Something, I made nearly killed you!"
“That bad, huh?”
“Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you,” said Bruce.
"It's so nice to finally meet you. Steve has told me a lot about you," she said.
“Later, Rogers."
“Steve-
“I remember a shadow, living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I was and should be king,” he growled.
"How more names would that add? And I doubt there were only fifty women," said Steve.
When Tony sent her on a search for weaponized prosthetic limb makers, this was the first place she thought of. People would sign away their souls for what they were physically missing, and fight in the ring until they paid off what was given in replacement. A debt that would never be repaid.
"Hmm."
He glared at Rumlow.
“Hug.”
"Even for you?"
“Take it off before I lose my patience.”
"Extend your teeth," said Bruce.
“Steve?”
“I apologize, Mr. Stark but you must calm down.”
The pup yawned again. He pulled the blankets over her, tucking her in. It didn't take long for her to fall asleep. She'd be up in about an hour. He turned off the lights and took a stance at the far corner of the room.
“Which guest room?”
“Morning.”
“No, I told him I wouldn’t fly back drunk,” said Tony.
“How was your visit?” asked Happy.
“We could be them.”
Matt didn’t press for more. It wouldn't only push the omega away.
"What do we do?" he asked. He didn't want a crowd swarming them as soon as they arrived.
"Want to help me with my latest project?"
“Jarvis air out the room,” she said.
“Clean yourself up.”
“I’ll take a look at this. Bye, Piper,” said Bruce.
That massive weight hit his chest again, taking the breath from his lungs. "What happened?"
Piper growled. More time with that woman. Their limited time together was already too much.
"Please, Steve, let me in. I got you something," said Tony.
“When will I go home?”
"Tony?"
Tony didn’t want to say he went to see Aunt Peggy. It would ruin the comfort of the moment, but Steve had a right to know.
The next one was Life on the Edge: The Coming of the Age of Quantum Biology.
"So it did feature someone. Was it yours, truly?” asked Clint.
Steve quickly dressed. He grabbed his shield and followed Natasha to the quinjet. She got into the pilot’s seat.
“Was there anyone else?”
She sat up when she spotted Lena hurrying into the backyard of her home, clearly flustered. There was no harm in listening to one more call.
Piper rolled her eyes.
“I don’t wanna!”
"Steve Rogers."
Tony breathed in his omega's scent. There was a subtle change in Steve's scent adding to its sweetness. It was so soft he wasn't sure if he were imagining it.
"And I thought that fact escaped you," said Neema.
One of the monitors beeped.
Steve tried getting up.
“I promise.”
“Now I don’t know what you plan here-
Happy gulped. He hoped his employer wasn’t going to do anything stupid.
“Fuck!”
“It isn’t a problem,” he said.
“Do you still want to use my computer?” she asked.
“Does your offer still stand?” he asked.
Steve found confidence attractive, but there’s a thin line between confidence and cockiness. Howard and Tony sometimes had difficulty seeing.
What 'they' was she talking of? The organization always wanted people like her.
"He's a busy man." But it was a perfect excuse to see the alpha in a platonic setting.
“A lot of people were. You were the world’s first superhero. Banner thought gamma radiation might be the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula,” said Phil.
“He could be,” said Tony.
“I don’t need one.”
Piper fell asleep while playing cards. Winter’s simple motion of walking toward her caused the card tower to tumble down. He placed her on thin the mattress.
“The girl.”
Steve got up from the examination table.
“You’re probably right,” said Steve.
“No.”
“Where do you want to put it?” asked Tony.
Around three Natasha had to leave.
“Then what does?” she asked.
“Why?”
“What’s wrong with her?”
Piper woke up. Her head was aching, vision blurry. Piper smiled when she realized she was huddled against Theodore's chest. This was the closest thing she’d had to safety since she was taken from her parents. Piper couldn't remember why she was so upset with him in the first place.
“I hope not.”
“A friend. Nothing to be concerned about." Steve smiled faintly, so fleetingly, before sighing. “I think I might be able to sleep for a bit.”
“He can’t say much. I was getting her hairbrush to test her DNA, so he can start processing it. How is she?” said Tony.
Rune shook his head. He didn’t care why. He just wanted the man gone.
Steve looked away from the man. "Then why are you here?"
"Next time."
Norepinephrine - substance that is released predominantly from the ends of sympathetic nerve fibers and that acts to increase the force of skeletal muscle contraction and the rate and force of contraction of the heart. The actions of norepinephrine are vital to the fight-or-flight response, whereby the body prepares to react to or retreat from an acute threat.
"You know why, Tony."
"Sure." Steve had no idea what he supposed to be looking at, or doing, but he wanted privacy with Tony, so he didn’t ask.
Pepper calmed down enough to realize the horrible stench she was standing in. It mixed horribly with Tony’s natural scent. She gagged slightly. The general rule with all omega was they typically smell sweet.
Steve woke at eight and started working on breakfast. He felt slightly at edge knowing his alpha wasn’t home.
“Yeah, I got that. James Rhodes,” he said.
“Is that good or bad?” asked Rune.
“You have to tell me what you want, sweetheart.”
"Sleep well."
He instantly pulled up a stool for her. She quickly took up the invitation.
“Why are you hiding in here?” asked Rune.
"Are you sure you don't mind?" asked Steve.
“He’s a spy. Captain, he’s the spy. His secrets have secrets. It’s bugging him too. Isn’t it?” said Tony.
He weaved through the maze of metalwork, landing outside of where Steve and Pepper were being kept.
“How?”
“Yeah, she can be a bit much,” he said.
“How's it going?” asked Edith.
After the night he had he sleep was a great thing. His arm wrapped firmly around the alpha. He sighed as the alpha ran his fingers through his air. Steve purred.
Steve made swift work of the task. Once done, he sat at the island, watching Tony cook. It was a treat having an alpha cooking for him. He was used to it being the other way around. When he was growing up, he was expected to rear pups and cook for his alpha after a long day of work.
Steve moved closer. Tony was having difficulty processing. Years of war taught Steve how to deal with death. How could he help Tony through it?
Tony nearly laughed. He couldn't get it up if he wanted to. There was something so disturbing about the idea of such intimacy. It wouldn’t be right. Steve looked like he was about to be sick.
He had to be bluffing. That much C4 in a confined area would kill them all.
"I'm not pestering only openly admiring," said Tony.
“It’s kinda funny. When looking for me, how many international privacy laws did you breach? And you’re giving me grief because I borrowed a key.”
"Piper, apologize this instant!"
"Sir, if she didn't nag, you'd get nothing done," said Jarvis.
What happened?”
“What you doing here, boss?”
Tony didn't know how to react. She was defending an assassin and rejecting her parents. The Winter soldier made no move against her. Could she not recognize them? He took off his helmet.
Steve glanced at the clock. He hadn't realized it was that late. “Why are you up at this hour?”
“Then why do they taste yucky?”
“More than those I’ve met?”
He blinked. A good face?
Ten minutes later, Tony joined him.
“Really good.”
“I’ll be back before midnight," said Tony.
"If you insist on acting like an animal, you shall be treated as one."
“Love you.”
“Not yet, but she should be waking up soon.”
"What happened to it?"
"He's not perfect," said Natasha.
Steve hung up. He fell back into bed, staring at the ceiling. Steve grabbed his shield when someone entered. He relaxing when he saw it was Natasha. She paced the room.
"Star is here," said Tony.
“Where would I go if we got out?”
“Will you go, sir?” asked Jarvis.
“I don’t have access,” said the tech.
"Beta. Steve, he wasn't doing it for power. He wanted to help people by figuring out how you were made. If it had been successful, he might be able to cure many diseases," she said.
Steve nodded. He went to the kitchen. It followed the style same sleek modern style as the rest of the house. Counters were polished black marble, cupboards and drawers were white, and all the appliances were stainless steel. The full-length windows let in a great deal of light. He drank two large bottles of water and brought one back for Tony. Steve took an apple from the fridge and made himself eat it. The returned to the bedroom. The room smelled of sex, yet he enjoyed it. He settled in the large nest. Red splotches of blood on the blanketing worried him. Tony was more marked them him. Some of them were rather deep. The bites and hickies were focused on the alphas shoulders. He would have to treat them. There was nothing he could do for the purple markings on the alpha's neck.
"I won't know until I take a sample. Will you stop me?" asked Dr. Star.
"I thought you’d be his first call,” said Tony.
“No, it’s the opposite,” sighed Steve.
Steve joined Tony.
"Was there anything more than friendship between you and Howard?"
“You always will.”
“You have to go,” said Tony.
“Beautiful.”
Clint was freezing his balls off. Stark’s drones patrolled the base below and would notify him if they spotted anything. The jet’s heating was subpar, its metal framing rattling in the intense wind. Clint kneeled by his prisoner and removed the gag.
Rumlow marched to the communications, readying himself for whatever Pierce had to say. When he entered, Pierce's live image was already displayed on the screen.
“That’s good."
“It’s so much worse. I don’t know what’s wrong with me”, he said.
“If you need anything, we’ll be behind the glass. So if at any point you feel uncomfortable, give us a signal,” said Phil.
“It’s fine I shouldn’t have snuck up on you,” he said. Steve wiped his cut on his sleeve. Clint lowered his bow.
Tony gently kissed him, then led him to his lab, helping Steve into his nesting couch. He didn’t bother with saying he wouldn’t be able to sleep. They both knew that. He wished he could escape the buzzing in his mind. All he could think about was his pup. It must be so much worse for Tony.
"I know. What I said remains the same."
Barny called back immediately, confirming an appointment for later. Steve groaned; he didn't want to discuss things. “When will he be here?”
He caught the flick of her gaze. She was lying.
Tony slammed on the brakes.
“That’s some traditionalist bullshit,” said Natasha.
He was quick to press close. "What were you dreaming of?" asked Steve.
"It seems too simple getting her into this state. What if someone accidentally taps into this consciousness?"
“If you came here to look for a hidden stash of alcohol go head, there's nothing. Steve and I got rid of everything."
“There’s the strength,” said Bruce.
Winter yanked her back. She’d wandered a foot away. That was too far with this woman so near.
They started packing up the few things Steve. They left some clothes there, knowing he might have to stay there after missions. The clothes he packed fit into one box. He placed his dress uniform in a garment bag. How quickly packing went reminded him how little he had. The most cumbersome things to pack were his painting each had to be carefully wrapped. Steve easily grabbed two boxes.
"It's fine, Steve go talk to your doctor. Tell me next time when you're having a bad day. I need to know things. I'm a genius but I can't read your mind."
That was all it revealed. They struggled against each other, landing a strike at every chance. He didn't know how long they fought for. A powerful blow the neck sent him to the ground. A cool metal hand wrapped around his neck, scruffing him. He went limp. Unable to fight the powerful command. All he managed was to hit the emergency button his bracelet. The alpha stomped on his hand, breaking his fingers, but the signal had already been sent out.
There wasn’t a doubt in her mind that Lena would do that. Make her sit in the center of the room doing nothing. Being locked inside a room with nearly nothing to do made her crave for something that allowed her to use her mind. That’s part of the reason she’d so fondly taken to learning from Winter.
"You were hardly on them."
He didn't know what to say to convince her. Her own words should be enough. But her mind seemed set against them. Maybe one day, if she were lucky, she would find out just how much they missed her. He hoped that day would come. The pup crawled into bed pulling the blankets over her head.
Piper stared at him. He was right. And it was such an easily stated fact. They could never change where she came from. Even they stole her memories of it. He was a lot smarter than he looked. And a lot more intelligent than any other child she’d met before.
The question went ignored.
“This isn’t for business,” he said.
Steve was already nodding off.
“Mmm, with that pout, you could get me to do about anything,” said Tony.
"You're looking at my DNA without my permission," said Piper coolly.
Once they finished lunch they moved onto what was next on the schedule. Espionage turned out to be the worse class. She was strapped to a lie detector machine, then made to repeat the phrase the 'the sky is red' until it came off seamlessly as if it were fact. She'd failed utterly and cried through the whole endeavor.
He never expected to smell so sweet. The alpha's momentary possessiveness didn't go unnoticed. Two alphas were interested in him. Before the serum, they only saw him as a plaything. A weak being they could use for their pleasure. They were surprised when he fought back.
The three men fell into comfortable conversation. Steve enjoyed watching the two alphas teased each other. It was clear the two were close. Watching them reminded Steve of him and Bucky. He shook away the thought before it could show in his expression.
Steve slowly stretched out in bed.  He put on a pair of sweatpants, pausing in front of the mirror. Maternity clothes had proven to be some of the most comfortable clothes he'd worn. He wanted to get back into his normal clothes, something without an elastic waistband. It would be nice not feeling like a whale. He was six-foot and nearing the end of the third term. There was nothing small about him.
Steve dragged Thor onto the dance floor, shutting him up.
Steve nodded. They sat at a desk and started planning out the project. There were a few disagreements and bickering, but it was nothing serious. They spent the entire day in the lab.
“Was I good?” asked Steve. He didn’t keep eye contact, fearing the answer.
“No, a confidentiality clause is built into his contract. I’m not breaking it,” said Tony. He did not need Fury on his ass.
"Didn't have the chance."
"And while your out could you go to the grocery store?" asked Steve.
“Yes, there has been a flood of volunteers,” she said.
"You don't mind it?"
Tony helped Steve from the floor.
“I have difficulty trusting people with my things. I would have scrapped Arm if it hadn’t proven useful. He was a prototype for Dum-E, but had an unintentional talent for folding clothes,” said Tony.
Steve huffed but took a bite. It triggered his hunger and ate with ease. Steve brushed the crumbs out of the bed. His stomach growling when he saw the empty plate.
*****
“Then turn down your music!” he shouted over the blasting riffs.
Tony took her from Steve tossing her into the air. She giggled.
"Mr. Stark, you have to calm him, break him from this feral state," said Edith.
“I love you, Tony”. He moved his hands away, giving the alpha a chance to escape, but he remained. If Tony left he wouldn't go after him. He wouldn't try and influence Tony's choice. “Sometimes you are the only thing keeping me sane. Until now I never thought I’d feel this way again."
"Of course you do," he said.
“Because I’m here to train your little girlfriend.”
“Mmm."
“Thank god you two are okay.”
“In your day? You’re not that much older than me,” said Matt.
His keen muscle memory of battle activated for the first time months. The activity he craved for months was finally satisfied. It was over to soon. He continued through the maze of tightly knitted maze of tunnels, Natasha watching his back. An explosion went off shaking the ground.
“Watch your tone. I’m capable of handling her myself,” said Steve.
“What happens to him after?” she asked.
“I don’t know how to put it into words.” It was more that she didn’t want to.
“What is it?” asked Piper.
Her brow furrowed in thought. Then she smiled. “Pass a lie detector test with my Aunt Nat. Then I’ll talk to you.”
“No, on the house,” he said.
"They were tense at breakfast. If they liked this guy, they wouldn't be like that."
"What happened, Tony?"
“Why didn’t you tell me, Steve was pregnant?” asked Clint.
“I had to bring you here. I wouldn’t do anything to put you or our daughter in danger. Trust in this," said Tony.
“Yes, well maybe. I don’t know right now,” said Steve.
“She’ll be here soon. We still haven’t decided on a name yet.”
“When?” asked Tony.
“Why was he here?” asked Piper.
Tony watched as Steve faded into sleep. He was getting attached. If Steve agreed to a relationship, the odds weren't in their favor.
“Sir, he’s awake.”
Steve smiled.
“She's never screamed like that before.”
“Yes,” she said.
“What do you have to report?” asked Fury.
“No one can find out!” growled Steve, pushing away the alpha. He sought out Tony's contact.
“Tony.”
Tony was slow to relax from his position over him.
A bed came into view. There was motion underneath the deep purple covers. He yanked away the blanket. Two omegas dressed in lingerie jolted when they saw him.
He took out a cloth and started dutifully cleaning and polishing his arm. The repetitiveness of the motion was relaxing. He yawned. It had been some time since he had to exert that level of force.
“No, Jarvis. I’m fine. What time is it?”
“I know.”
“Thanks for visiting.”
Steve tucked silver orb back into its box. Tony was likey itching to take it apart. Steve carefully folded the blanket, sitting on the counter. He ran his hand over the soft fabric. He was fighting the urge to tuck it into the layers of her nest. He tapped his fingers against the counter. Steve gave in and brought it to his nest.
Beta Read by AbsolutShenanigans
“These are advanced books, so some of the language may prove difficult,” said Uncle Bruce.
He slowly sat up, waking her. She made a small whine at being disturbed. "Sorry honey bunny."
"Please continue, doctor."
as a wealthy businessman is getting things done when I need to. I couldn’t get Piper for so long and now that we have her we still don’t know how or why this happen.” He hesitated. “Or...”
"Mm, where would be the fun in that?" said Tony.
Steve cried out. Deeply gasping for breath as he worked through the process. Tony was powerless. It was clear that the omega didn’t want to be touched, so he sat loyally the bed. He placed a cool cloth over Steve’s forehead. An hour slowly ticked by. Edith walked into the bedroom.
“Steve, you all right?” asked Tony.
“Calculate Steve’s ring size.”
Tony nosed against his neck.
"Morning, little one."
Pepper resisted the urge to roll her eyes. He never acted that way around her, but he was trying to move on. Maybe she should call the number the S.H.I.E.L.D beta gave her. It could be worth a try.
Steve was tired. He wanted nothing more than to get back home. Finally, he got to the tower. He still found the building ugly but it was home nonetheless.
“Does it always have to end in killing? Are there other things?” she asked.
Piper crept closer but he didn’t look at her. The lack of response meant he didn’t believe she was a threat. He stunk of sweat. When was the last time he bathed? Under the body odor, there was something … something that reminded her of home. He smelled of pine and mint. Piper’s eyes watered at the memory but she pushed back the tears. Focus.
“Is something wrong with the bed?” asked Jarvis.
“You do Steve.”
“Come on”, he said.
"He believed in an afterlife."
“You better not.”
“Do you share his feelings?” asked Barny.
“Why can’t you teach me?”
There was another word he didn’t know home. Another almost head shake, and he had to block her out.
*****
He fumbled with the car but finally managed to break into the cold winter air, stumbling to his knees. Tony couldn’t get air into his lungs. His breath came in heavy pants.
“It wasn’t your fault. You know that right,” said Edith.
Lena woke up her with her face plastered to her desk. She groggily raised her head, wiping the drool from her chin. It was six in the morning. Lena smiled she was leaving to see her family today. She turned on the coffee pot, then walked to the one-way window. Her jaw dropped.
“I’m sorry miss.” Helmut’s eyes widen slightly at the beautiful omega woman in front of him. She had wavy short brown and green-blue eyes. The dullness of her uniform did little do take away from her beauty. He was a faithful husband and mate but there was no harm in admiring. It was like appreciating a fine piece of artwork.
This was about Steve. He needed to be there for him, be a good alpha. He wasn't important. Tony took a breath. He tested the water. It was perfect. He went to get Steve. The omega was exactly where he left him.
“Did this alpha have your consent?” asked Edith.
With another kiss goodbye and Tony left. Steve sighed. He was alone. It wasn’t too far of a walk to Times Square. But being surrounded by that many people would be too confining. Looked like he was staying in tonight.
“Your level doesn’t meet the requirement for that information to be available to you,” said Fury.
Someone was calling for him. A deep rumbling sound helped freed him from the terror of his memory. A calming hand continued to run through his hair.
Steve woke on his couch in his paint clothes. He’d fallen asleep talking with Tony. Steve got to his feet. It was eight in the morning. He’d missed his normal run time. Steve got up and looked over the half-finished painting, he’d work on it later. He changed into his running clothes, joining the trainees for their morning drills.
"Did you tell her what happened?"
“You’re taking an unnecessary risk.”
Piper cuddled against him. He gently rubbed her back. Tony sighed he couldn't let this go on.
"Hospital food hasn't improved over the decades. It's good to know some things haven't changed."
“In the Shawlands. Hunter Smith was last seen leaving a bar called the Water Trough. His apartment is only five minutes from the bar," said Tony.
Winter raised her chin, taking a look at her eye. It had healed completely.

“Could we have at the mansion?” asked Steve.
“Yes, I refurbished her myself. I doubt she’s as fancy as anything your daddy has though,” Barny laughed.
"No matter how grand the ship, there are always leaks."
"We'll figure it out together, Pipes." The pup smiled brightly at him, forgetting her worries for a moment. Calling her, Pipes never failed to earn such a reaction from her. It was the reason he used it so sparingly, not wanting it to lose this effect.
Steve groaned this wasn’t the way he planned on meeting Tony’s best friend. Rhodes knew who he was, every person who served in the U.S military knows him. The alpha wearily found a seat, staring at him.
Piper spent her morning exploring the many rooms of the mansion. She pushed open a large oak door to find a larger office. The bookshelves were crowded with nicknacks and black and white photos. She climbed up the shelf, taking down a photo. It was a picture of the Howling Commando. Granddad and Papa.
Steve purred.
"Let's get it over with," said Steve.
Steve nodded.
“That goo to know. But we will get to that point naturally. We may not even reach the topic today. But you can’t blame for being fascinated by your project. It's not every day; I see something like this.”
They ate in silence. Steve yawned the urge to sleep, becoming overwhelming. Tony started gathering plates.
*****
"Someone else was here," he said.
Steve knew what was being asked. Bruce was politely asking Tony to get his omega under control.
“Pick up, Tony!”
“We have to call her.”
"You're the one bringing her into this!" growled Steve.
“I will. I promise to make this up to you."
Tony missed his positive little girl.
"Steve, she is. I hate admitting, but she is a danger if she doesn't learn how to control her abilities. If a population outside of S.H.I.E.L.D saw what she could do, Piper would be classified as a weapon, not a person," said Tony.
“Then it changed when he had his first heat,” said Steve.
“Agent Hill.”
“You don’t know things I’ve done.”
“Thank you.”
“Yeah, I had them do off a doll that I made, so it not like it's off a picture.”
Steve nodded. There was an audience of S.H.I.E.L.D agents watching them. He turned red. Steve hid his face in the crook of Tony’s neck.
Steve stormed out of the kitchen, slamming their bedroom door. Tony went to his lab. Steve needed a few hours to cool down. Then maybe the omega would come to his senses.
“Is it alright if it’s a late dinner?” Tony asked.
“Nothing that would make me worry. My chest has been sore.”
“Nothing they won’t eventually do to you.”
"Good."
Steve found two bowls and filled them with stew. He set them on the counter. It was still pouring outside. Tony came back wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt.
“He climbed up the elevator cables. Captain Rogers care for you through the night,” said Jarvis.
Lena wanted to further encourage the behavior. She took the remote for Winter’s arm from her pocket. She hit the button.
"After their involvement in the Incident, that's impossible."
“Steve."
A car was already waiting for them. Happy got into the front seat.
Lena scoffed. “My skills far surpass those of stage hypnotists, making someone bark like a dog. What I do is much more complex. I go past the preset morals of the mind and tap into something more primal. When it comes down to it, all of us are capable of great violence, even death. It only requires changing the subject's perception."
"Like I'd forget," he said.
The omega's eyes slowly started closing. "I'll be here when you wake up." His eyes finally closed at the alpha's reassurance. Tony winced as Steve's hand fell away from him. He ran his fingers through Steve's hair. Placing a kiss on Steve's forehead before forcing himself to pull away.
They would have to find a child physiologist to unpack the damage inflicted. He forced down the anger that stirred at that thought. A small whine caught their attention as Piper stirred.
“I need a second to screen for any genetic disorders. It may not be a factor, but I want to be careful,” she said.
“Hey, I have to cut you off. Do you have your taser on you?”
Tony nodded.
“Wait."
“I’ll make you some coffee,” said Pepper.
"Steve, is there any reason you thought you'd be incapable of bearing a child beside the serum?" she asked.
She went rigid when Daddy scruffed her and growled. His hand gently clasping the back of her neck, a gesture reminding her of her place in the pack. It wouldn’t take much for her to shake off his hold, but the shock kept her still. Tears welled in her eyes. She whimpered, bowing her head. The pressure on her neck was instantly relieved upon her submission. Even with her strength, Daddy was the alpha of the pack. She challenged him and Papa, yes, but she just wanted to test her limits. See how far they'd let her go. She didn’t mean anything by it. Piper sniffled, collecting herself before meeting her parents’ gaze.
Steve got up from the couch.
“Looks like you share your father’s fascination with the captain. Otherwise, I doubt you would have that information,” said Fury.
"Just go to sleep!" growled Rumlow tightening his hold around Winter's neck.
*****
“Why? I could tell them.”
"She was the only other person I had these feelings before now. Is it bad that I'm waiting for it to go wrong?"
He saw the angered pained tears streaking down Steve’s cheeks.
They circled closely to each other, searching for the best opening to strike. He lunged. She grabbed his wrist with her free hand, forcing him to drop the weapon. His hand locked on her forearm keeping her close. He tore the weighted end from her slamming it into her. Even struck with that amount force she hadn’t skidded far. Her hand moved to her waistband. By the time he noticed the glint of the blade it was already wedged deeply in his thigh.
"Why do we have to give them anything?"
“I’m sorry, baby,” he said.
The alpha came striding into the room naked. Steve kept his gaze focused on Tony’s eyes.
“Can we get on with this?” said Clint.
“I won’t be like him. I want to be part of my pup’s life.”
*****
“Did you like that?” asked Tony.
Tony went into the bedroom. He settled in bed, waiting for Steve. In bed by 11:30 pm, that was a first. Steve came out closet shirtless dressed in flannel pajama pants. His gaze instantly went to Steve’s necklace than traveled lower. How he wished to mark that beautiful neck with his claim. His teeth lengthened with the urge, but he forced it down.
“Perfectly,” said Steve. His smile faded slightly.
“No.” Neither of them could have possibly known.
"How do you think she'll respond to Dr. Bloom?" asked Tony.
“Happy Hogan’s room."
There no pushing away the thought. It lingered unwantedly.
He snarled when she stepped closer, keeping her posture small.
A drone was still circling around Steve’s head. “Jarvis you in there?”
“We can make an exception.”
“I believe there a terrifying level a genius behind this machine. How does it work?”
Any lingering fear dissipated in the safety of the alpha's embrace. Tony eased him through the terrors, never judging him. They fell asleep in each other's arms.
“I was doing as previously instructed by my handler.”
“It will heal soon enough,” he said.
“Okay,” said George. He tucked it into his pocket.

“She won’t kill me. I’m too valuable.”
“Steve."
The first bike was olive green. It was a bit bulky. He was willing to give it a try. Steve got on it. The seat was wonderfully cushy. Its handles were nice in his hand.
“What would I do without you?” he asked.
Nick glared at her. She would be in a royal pain when she got older, just like her father. He was sure of it.
Bruce took a cotton swab from the jar on the counter. He gently swabbed her mouth.
Steve paced the room.
“So, the bastard lives,” said Rumlow.
“Sir, take a deep breath.”
“You too,” said Alan.
“Hungry.”
"I'll be out in few more minutes."
*****
Tony put the plate in front him with three sandwiches. Steve dug in. When he was done Tony gave him a tub of strawberry ice cream. Steve blushed. He took the tub and settled on the couch.
Now that was an image. The door quietly opened. Steve smiled at him.
“I can understand bottling one’s emotions and unleashing it on a specific day. I would want to hide that away from those I care about not inflict it on them,” he said.
"That's not good." Caring was dangerous. Something that could, and likely
"You don't have to. I can get my own."
“Not that she's liked everyone she's met until now,” said Tony.
He could survive the loss of their relationship, but truly losing Steve was something he wouldn't survive. Steve turned them over. He bent Tony’s gauntlets before the alpha could make another attempt to escape. Now that he caught him he wasn’t letting go.
Tony rolled his eyes.
She frowned. He tucked her in.
“Does she have a family?” asked Steve.
Steve took the other albums from the shelf. They spent the rest of the night looking through them.
“Impressed?"
He blushed. "I'm sorry that I scared you."
“Always thought his first name was agent,” said Tony.
He picked her up, swaddling her in a blanket, and rocked back and forth. A deep rumbling echoed from within his chest. The sound was foreign to him. As he felt her relax he sat down. The pup's pupils were blown. A higher-pitched purr emitted from her. The short glimpse he caught of her eyes her pupils were blown in an instinctual calm. He leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes.
“Thank you.”
“I don’t know, but I’ll make sure she won’t hurt anyone again.”
“All clean,” announced Steve. "You want me to brush your hair,"
They fell asleep holding each other.
"Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?"
“Let go?”
“Well, this is actually kind of familiar,” said Steve.
Tony went through a list of activities. Half them Steve couldn't do while pregnant. They agreed on the aquarium. As soon as he got there he regretted not bringing his sketchbook. They had it mostly to themselves. His favorite exhibits were the otters and whale shark. He took a seat on a bench, watching the giant fish swim gracefully through the water.
"You aren't really teaching me how to protect myself," Piper began. Winter shook his head, relieved, at least, to not have that untruth between them. "You're teaching me how to kill," Piper finished.
“I’ll tell you all the stories I know.”
“Are you sure?” said Lena.
She started crying. This was all her fault. She launched from the bed, hugging him and crying into his chest.
“Answering a question with a question is not an answer.”
"No, I mean really think about him. You don't want anyone prying into who your mystery lover is. Even more so if you want him to move in. You don't want someone to accidentally snap pick and break the news he's alive before he's ready," said Rhodes.
She ran off with Rune. Tony tensed when he felt Steve glaring at him. “Don’t get angry. It was the simplest solution,” he said.
Tony slowed down when he entered the city. The tower was within sight. He landed on the penthouse deck. His armor disengaged, folding back into a suitcase. He ran inside.
“I’m fine,” he said through gritted teeth.
“Loki has him under some sort of spell. Along with one of ours,” said Natasha.
“Sure, this way,” said Bruce.
She pulled up Piper's blood results. There were no traces of it in the sample. Hmmm. Yesterday's incident hadn't fully activated Piper's potential. That was only a peek behind the curtain. The Extremis present in Piper’s DNA likely stabilized when it mixed with super serum already present in the child’s make up. Even in if it weren’t it could likely be stabilized by editing the cure Stark developed. Anger wasn’t the right trigger. But she believed she knew what was. She would have to wait a little longer until she could test it. Lena smiled.
*****
“Her name is Piper Stark she went missing a few months ago,” said Helmut.
At one in the morning, Steve came out the haze. His head rested on Tony’s lap. The alpha’s powerful scent surrounded him.
They went down to the boat and set off.
“I’ll get a message to him,” said Tony.
“Must be difficult,” he said.
"You don't have to do that. Keeping up that mask. It must be exhausting."
"Bruce, can you give us a moment?" he asked.
She shook her head. Sweat beaded on her forehead.
“So I’m not in trouble?” asked Piper hopefully.
Steve showered off the lingering scents of Tony and his most recent interaction. From the bathroom, he heard Rhodes. He'd been hoping Rhodes have left by the time he finished in the shower. Steve force himself out of the bathroom and into the kitchen. He took the seat next to Tony. The alpha still smelled strongly their previous interaction.
“Only a blood sample.”
From her clutch she pulled a compact, appearing to check her perfect makeup; secretly, searching for anyone may have noticed her. Nothing abnormal, only a few lust-struck alphas who'd likely try, but fail, to get her attention. She snapped close the compact, tucking it back into her purse. Her newfound fame was a massive hindrance to her job. She lazily stirred the olives in her martini.
“Death by oil,” said Rhodes.
“What you do that for?!”
"Tony!"
“Scoot down for me," said Edith.
She started wailing. Looked like three hours of sleep would be all he’d get today. He sighed and started walking her around the penthouse, all the while singing Steve’s lullaby to her:
They gave in. Tony flipped Steve over, pinning him underneath him. In one motion, he thrust into his mate. His jaw locked, forcing back a deeply satisfied moan. Their reflection showed Steve frantically biting a hand towel to silence his pleasure.
"Burgers and pie sound good," said Steve.
Steve winced as he took a breath. He was lucky the shattered ribs hadn’t punctured anything vital. It would take weeks for the fragments to mend. Tony sat at his side fidgeting with his phone. Steve knew he wasn’t just playing around. He was likely working on some sort of program to find their daughter. The door opened and Natasha came in.
“Than why did you do it?” asked Tony.
“I know it’s embarrassing,” said Tony.
“Can it wait?” Steve asked.
“He's probably asleep."
Steve got up, grabbing Tony's hand before the alpha could leave the room. Tony squeezed his hand.
It was a part of every Stark's personality, including his daughter. He hoped she wouldn’t be as cocky as in her ancestors.
*****
Tony tensed. This mixture of scent distressed and happy could be. No, he would have smelled pregnancy on Steve. The omega was on birth control, but with his body chemistry, it may not have worked. He wasn’t ready to be a dad! Steve laughed.
"What does Captain America do at three in the morning?”
“No.”
He walked through the penthouse straightening up things as he went. He ran his finger over the bookshelf, pausing on a photo album. Unable to resist he pulled it from its place. He touched the pale pink cover. It was Piper’s baby album. He should put it back. Looking through it would only hurt. But how much worse could it get? He went to the couch, setting the book on the coffee table. He stared at it for a while before finally opening it, smiling when he saw Piper’s tiny painted handprints on the first page. They were so small.
"That's what I thought until woke up puking. And there's this," said Steve offering her the test.
“Let’s get him upstairs.”
"Thanks, Jarvis."
Tony finished he finished off the coffee. Natasha allowed him through. He went to Steve's room, pulling a chair close to bed before collapsing into it. Straightening up when someone entered the room, relaxing when saw Natasha with Steve's shield. She placed by the foot of the bed and took her leave. Steve whimpered his unfocused blue eyes open. There was only a slim line of blue.
"I've noticed an irregularity on our network."
Piper tensed as Winter pulled away. The warmth of his embrace was replaced by a cold edge pressed against her throat.
Steve nodded.
“Fine, thanks to you. Is there anything I could do to repay you?” she asked.
"Can do."
"Ready to go? If you're not, I'm happy to keep her waiting," he said.
“I get it, Steve,” he said.
Tony woke to Steve’s whimpering. The smell of the omega’s arousal hung thickly in the air. Steve was panting his eyes were fully dilated. His fingers clutched the bedding.
“Do you have any idea where Loki would go?” asked Bruce.
“Steve!” They embraced. He nuzzled against Steve’s neck breathing in his scent. “You’re here.”
Peggy swatted him on the back of the head. Tony gave him several cookies. He rested them on his stomach.
“But you’re pretty spry for an older fellow. What’s your thing palaties?” said Tony.
Citizen Cane - is a 1941 American drama film by Orson Welles, its producer, co-screenwriter, director and star. The picture was Welles's first feature film. Nominated for Academy Awards in nine categories, it won an Academy Award for Best Writing
Steve shook his head.
“This was a massive waste of time,” said Clint. Steve nodded. Clint wanted to get back to his family. At least by doing this, he’d be free for the rest of December. He looked forward to all that time with his family.
They were surprised when Pepper came down. She was splattered with batter.
This was not the conversation he planned. It was difficult to predict where it might lead.
“It doesn’t work on me,” he said.
“No." He huddled next to the sleeping alpha. Sleep came swiftly.
“Thank you.” It was an automatic response.
August 3, 2012
Those low sports cars were difficult for him to get in and out of. There was also the fact that he couldn’t fit inside one comfortably. They got into their newest car. Steve smiled when he saw the car seat in the back of the car. He smirked. Tony was only going about ten over the speed limit. That was new.
"I believe we do, sir." A drawer opened on its own.
*****
Steve tensed backing away. The scent of an alpha filled his nose. It was a mix of black pepper and rosemary. The scent belonged to a somewhat scruffy dark haired alpha. In his hand was a cane. He wore a pair of dark glasses and in one hand was a cane. He’s blind. There would no chance of him being recognized. The could smell him, but it would be easy to slip by. He stepped forward his feet crunching in the snow.
“What?!” Edith looked at them. They were serious. "That shouldn't be possible."
“Morning, Theodore.”
“I don’t want to fight you, Rune. I don’t think you want to fight either. I won’t fight, you not like this.”
Piper groaned; her arms were sore from being trapped behind her back. She'd wet herself. Her pants clung to her, irritating her skin. They'd left her like this to shame her into compliance. Lena wouldn't have left her in such a state, or at least would’ve given her pull-ups.
Tony took Steve's plate, dumping it into the trash. It was more than he’d thought Steve would eat. He wrapped his arms loosely around his husband, resting his chin on the omega's broad shoulder.
“We did make a super baby,” said Steve.
“For now, I want you to take things from their pockets without ringing a bell."
“You can ask Steve. It doesn’t bother me,” said Peggy.
Tony unbuttoned his shirt, carefully easing it down his shoulders. She stared at the deep bruises marking his chest. The omega quickly took his vital, only touching as much necessary.
“You’ll have to this time around,” said Edith.
“No, I have things to do.”
"GET OUT!" yelled Tony.
“What part of New York is this?” he asked.
They took off in that direction. Standing in front of a kneeling crowd was Loki. He jumped from the jet, deflecting Loki’s blast.
“Time?” he asked.
“I think I’m going to call him Stanley.”
“PAPA!”
"I'm good," said Steve yawning again.
“Yes, Daddy,” she said.
Bruce stopped and stared at the tired man hunched over in the chair, bouncing an equally tired pup in his lap. There were bags under his eyes and he was unshaved.
“What do you want to read?” asked Papa.
Steve joined him, quickly closing the distance between them. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve. He bringing him close, breathing in that honey vanilla scent. His hickey already left his pale skin. He had to repair that before going to sleep. He gently sucked a new mark on Steve’s neck, causing him to gasp.
"I'm sorry to disrupt."
"Says something about the state of the world when the daughter of Captain America and Ironman can be kidnapped," he said unfolding the paper.
Tony rarely if ever asked his opinion on these matters.
"Right away," said Jarvis.
“Did you ever meet him?” asked Tony.
“It wasn’t my fault she was a chicken,” said Piper.
He was quick to change, knowing if he didn’t move fast enough there may be hell to pay. Steve’s arms wrapped around his waist keeping him close. They stay like that for most of the day.
Steve snarled. “You may be my alpha, Tony, but that doesn’t give you the right to make choices for me!”
Steve's eyes flew open at the touch.
Daddy and Rune woke up.
“Can I come in?”
“What if I hurt her?”
“It’s not that simple.”
She had no true memory of the event except for what was shown to her. He'd seen the knife plunged into her side. Muscle memory proved stronger and more reliable than her mind. It demanded a reaction. Her first instinct was fear, the most natural defense to danger.
Antarctica
“The ballroom then.”
Steve's heart raced for a completely different reason. He nosed against the alpha's neck, taking in his scent. Tony ran his finger through his hair. He nearly whimpered when Tony got up.
"I had close it," said Steve.
“Nope.”
"Senile, his brain has gone to mush. In many regards, Igor thought his son a failure. He left everything to his granddaughter, Lena Toth Zemo.”
“What about your friend?”
Tony had left Bloom with a panic button just in case something happened. He hoped there wouldn’t be any reason for the doctor to use it. It was difficult to leave his pup alone with a stranger. Steve was waiting upstairs in the kitchen.
“What does this have to with our current situation?”
Steve grabbed his gym bag, while Tony made himself a drink. Steve took the alpha's glass away, and circled his arms around Tony’s chest affectionately, rubbing his cheeks against Tony's neck, transferring his scent.
"I understand. I couldn't take him if he were like that. When will he wake up?"
“And what are you now?” asked Loki.
“I don’t have the one that fits that gun.”
“Why call me?” asked Steve.
"Bye, Barny.” Steve tucked his phone back into his pocket. "Jarvis, pull up everything you can find on Dr. Caroline Bloom and Dr. George Wong."
"Thank you," said Steve.
“Be careful,” said Rune.
“Yes.”
“He helps me sleep,” said Steve.
“But you don’t. You’re a spy, not a soldier now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you?” he said.
Steve shot to the other side of the couch. His facing burning. Tony was far bolder than his father. He didn’t think that was possible until now. Steve scowled, realizing how much Stark’s words got to him. A wet spot had formed at the front of his pants. He placed a pillow on his lap when the door opened. It wouldn't fool anyone; the scent of what occurred was still heavy in the air. The director entered. His face remained straight.
. “He feels bad for what happened.”
He pulled away from Steve. Tony poured himself a drink. Steve's eyes were on him. Steve went to their bedroom. Tony downed the drink in one gulp before pouring himself another. He hit the ground. Steve's shield shredded through the glass bottle above him.
“Satisfying,” said Steve.
“We leave at six. What can do to help?" asked Tony.
"Come closer, I won't bite unless you want me to," said Tony.
Piper looked down.
“Jarvis, vent out the room.”
“I think it’s about the mechanics. Iridium, what do they need the Iridium for?” said Bruce.
“How do I explain this to her?”
"That would be a breach of doctor-patient confidentiality." Barny sighed.
“I like to know the full reasoning behind the actions of my opponent,” said Steve.
Piper had told him over and over about the Avengers. They sounded like a fairytale to him, but she assured him that they were real. And judging by the lengths that her parents went through to get her, he was sure that was true.
“Steve."
"When you get further along laying on the floor like will prove problematic," said Tony.
“I was scared!” Tony’s expression softened slightly. “I was terrified of being pregnant. We've never discussed children. I thought I might lose you-
“Mont Blanc Mountains,” she said.
“Might as well take a look at it while you’re here. The damn thing keeps on jamming up,” she said.
Steve rolled his eyes. A translucent screen appeared before them. He watched the alpha worked on equations he couldn’t even begin to understand. Steve dozed off.
Hand in hand, Tony and Steve forced their way through the crowd of cameras. Steve blocked out the questions the best he could, instead, focusing on the shuttering sound of the cameras. When they finally got into the car, he burrowed his face into Tony's neck, pulling away when he could no longer hear the clicks of the camera.
Winter signed his progress had been slowed by the incompetence of Sir’s men, but he should arrive at his tasked destination with enough time to spare.
“Is there anyone close to my age?”
When Piper regained consciousness. She was in a room she'd never seen before. The room was padded. A muzzle was strapped around her mouth. Her arms pinned behind her back. When she struggled to break free, the fabric of the cloth of straight jacket constricted painfully around her.
"Six weeks might have to get it checked out. I've messed up my shoulder before.”
Steve’s mind went blank at the idea.
His teeth sharpened.
The beta took a submissive stance. He grabbed her by the neck, not tight enough to kill, but enough to bring fear. His shield grazing against her neck. She whined. He dropped her. She gasped for breath.
"I don't either." Tony wanted a peaceful life for them, or close to one as possible. “We’ll only give them enough to leave us alone."
“Yeah, it will be there for a while”, said Tony.
“‘Letting’ implies I can make you do anything.”
“You don’t have to do this in a few minutes they’ll be healed,” he said. His cracked ribs would take a few hours to heal, though.
“We know the model’s locked and we are searching for the signature now. When we get a hit we’ll have a location on that monitor,” said Bruce, pointing the screen behind Fury.
Tony took his hand. Steve easily lifted him to his feet. They were done with the subject. Steve would likely never speak of it again. He'd gotten what he needed from the confession. Tony understood trauma.  After losing his mother, he got blackout drunk state and told Rhodes of his sadness regret then buried it. Whenever such grief made a reappearance, he would drown it with drinking. Steve’s coping methods were unknown to him, but they seemed similar to his.
“Who’s Oprah?” asked Steve.
“How about a bubble bath, baby girl? Does that sound good?" She nodded. "Jarvis, get the tub ready."
"I'm an apprentice midwife," she said, offering him a blanket for Piper.
"And yours smells just as bad, so we're even."
“Don’t be afraid I don’t bite.”
"Than your opinion."
He went back upstair settling in his nest coach.
“I have?” he said.
"You aren't complaining. Wait, you let him fight in his condition?” said Happy.
“You sleep better in your suits than with me,” said Steve.
Steve blushed. “I’ve bet you’ve gotten countless proposals."
“For the moment."
“I will be.”
“I’ll drive you,” said Tony.
“He was a friend,” said Fury.
“His blood alcohol content is 0.249% normally it takes more to get him to this state,” said Jarvis.
“It’s with S.T.R.I.K.E team,”
“No.”
“I’m Piper Sarah Margret Stark. My birthday is January 2, 2013. My home is Manhattan New York.”
He didn’t doubt her intelligence.
“This is childish, sir. Ignoring her will make it worse," said Jarvis.
“What are you doing? You’re going to break his finger. He’s injured. He’s in pain. Leave him alone,” said Tony. He was actually jealous of the armor. It was immune to the agony he was enduring.
“A terrorist organization that wanted you,” said Tony.
“Morning.”
Tony stood protectively by Steve. He didn’t trust the woman. It didn’t matter what Steve thought about her. A woman of her abilities working for S.H.I.E.L.D. was unsettling.
“Thank god,” said Steve.
Piper glared at the woman. She wanted to finish that problem. Now it would be stuck in her head all day and she wouldn’t have any way of writing it out.
"It will take time, but I'm sure we'll get there," said Tony.
“How can you tell?”
“Your mind isn’t here, where I need it to be,” said Banner.
Tony held Piper in one arm as tucked Steve into the nest. He was exhausted and his shoulder twinged painfully. Sleep could wait until he was sure Steve was safe. He joined his mate in bed. Piper lay on his chest asleep. He rested his hand on her back. Her eyes opened.
“What’s wrong?” asked Natasha.
“Five more minutes,” he groaned.
“Want to hold her?” he asked.
The deep, lustful tone of the alpha's voice sent a shiver down Steve’s back. From the window, he saw Tony flying in, and he remembered what Edith had said.
Tony was right. The fight wasn't going anywhere. After his heat, it would still be there.
“That’s your opinion, not a fact."
Natasha slammed the door to interrogation. Fury stood in the hall, leaning against the wall.
“Eat.” He said pressing the spoon gently against her lips. “Or they’ll make you.”
“Sound enough reasoning,” said Tony. He lay down on the floor next to Steve.
*****
“Just A Rather Very Intelligent System. My namesake was Howard Stark’s butler,” said Jarvis.
"I don't know what you're talking about Piper. You do have a choice. To either accept gratefully, like a good girl would, or to be rude," said Lena.
“Get out of here, Pepper!”
“Am I pulling you away from your work?” asked Tony.
“I’ve been here the entire time. All you had to do was ask.”
Steve opened the box, letting him see inside. Paper-clipped neatly were all their museum tickets from their dates. Lining the box was one of his pillowcases. When had Steve taken it? Tucked into the corner was a locket with Peggy Carter’s image. The other items were knickknacks Steve collected through his missions.
"No."
*****
"Steve."
"Yeah, that makes sense." He took a seat beside the kid, looking over the shadows. “Think about it. Six dead only five shadows."
"It was handled. We're safe."
“I have some good news. You’ll be allowed to continue your education.”
“It’s my fault.”
"Not long," sighed Gloria, with a sad shake of her head.
Pierce cautiously entered. The child gave no reaction to his presence.
“Is everything a joke to you?” said Steve.
“Why?”
“I’ll take that as a yes,” she said. Her godson’s head was bowed. His guilt weighed heavily on him. She was very aware she was one of the few people to see him in such a state. “The two of you will be a good match."
“Want to watch a movie or something?” asked Tony.
By Steve’s posture, it was obvious he didn’t want to further discuss it at the moment.
"You can expect a full three months of leave," he said.
"I've already sent the elevator. Do you wish me to prepare a bath?"
"What else?" asked Bruce.
“Tony?”
“Keep it the same,” he said.
“An apology for my arm,” he said.
“Done?”
“Being spooned by Captain America."
Hulk jumped into the air grabbing the metal man. Metalman was limp. He slid down the side of a building slowing their descent. They skidded across the road through several cars. He tossed his friend to the side.
It reminded Steve that he had his own call to make. The picked up was immediate.
“Any idiot can pass a polygraph, but no one can pass this,” she said.
They reached a large frost-covered door. Lena hit a button on the wall. The ice cracked away, before swinging open. Piper’s eyes widened. Outside was frozen wasteland. Her stung and watered at sunlight reflecting off the snow. Lena kneeled next her.
“Take a seat,” said Lena.
“I doubt there’s anyone like you, Mrs. Romanoff.”
“When should I expect your visit," said Tony.
Tony’s eyes widened. He thrust deeply into his omega in a single motion. Steve moaned into their kiss. His hand tangling in Steve's hair, bringing him deeper into their kiss.  He pulled away grazing his sharpened teeth against Steve’s neck. His thrusts were slow.
*****
“I’d be happy to answer any questions,” said George.
Steve sighed. He would have to use the pump. A week would give him plenty of time to make enough bottles for Piper while he’s gone.
She smiled. Tony sat down with on the pink fluffy blanket beside Piper and built a block tower with her. Blocks, Legos, Lincoln logs anything she could build with; she never lost interest in them. Piper handed him Plats.
“The four of us won’t be enough,” protested Hill. At least, not enough to do this safely, she added silently. Not all of them were superior-soldiers or owned weaponized suits of armor. “We need at least twenty highly trained individuals.”
Piper didn’t even know if it was even morning. It could be ten at night for all she knew. She waved her hand.
“Sure,” said Happy.
“Unless you’re going to get me home I’m not interested.”
The pup obeyed slowly, taking deep breaths in out. Her body started to relax. Bloom’s word’s soothing words lead her deeper in to a state of relaxation. Piper’s brow furrowed when Bloom’s gentle word scraped painful against some unforeseen barrier. She wanted to stop!
"Thank you, Papa."
“Should we let the local agencies handle it?” asked Steve.
“Tony, the shower is yours,” he said from the bedroom.
He shot off an arc reactor blast, sending the jackass backward. Tony dislodged himself from the metal. He snagged the guy’s keys. Then snuck back into the bar to snag the file. Quickly, thumbing through it outside.
The four styles of fighting Winter knows are Systema, karate, boxing, and muay thia. There’s a great video explaining this on youtube “How many fighting styles does the winter soldier know in Avengers”. It can explain them far better than I can.
Tony cupped his face in hands, cutting off his words.
Tony read it over several times. It seemed to be the oldest. He couldn't voice it, so he gave it to Steve. The omega choked back a sob, before wailing. It shook Tony core - the sound Steve made was near inhuman. Hearing that unnatural cry coming from his mate was wrong. The powerful man he fell in love with was crumbling before him and there was little he could do to help. Tony was on the brink himself. Every day was a battle against drinking. So, he did all he could and held Steve tightly.
He offered the vial to the bot. Dum-E took it carefully in its clawed hand. "Don't drop it, butterfingers."
They talked about sports for an hour. Steve groaned as that cramping repetitive pain returned. He desperately wanted to reach out for Tony's hand. It was an anchor.
Steve put the dishes into the washer and grabbed several protein bars from the cabinet. They were an easy way to take in the calories he needed and had the bonus of being easy to eat while nursing. Piper refused to let him have a real breakfast until she was fed. He placed her on a pillow and brought her to nurse. Steve loved this intimate time with her. It was relaxing for the both of them. Edith believed the reason his PTSD symptoms became less frequent and serious was the powerful cocktail of calming hormones nursing released. It also had an anti-anxiety and anti-depressant effect. His fear was that this calm would break. He was broken from the thought when Piper pulled away early looking up at him worriedly. She must have felt him tense.
“What about you?”
Steve quickly dressed.
There was no stopping his omega. He could lock down the house, but Steve could easily break through its defenses. "Promise me you'll be careful."
Papa was already there, making a small blanket nest on the floor. Whenever they had movie nights, he'd make one for her. Still, she always ended up sitting between her parents halfway through whatever they were watching.
“My face is sore from smiling,” said Steve.
“Jarvis get the tub ready.”
“Daddy?”
The couple relaxed. Tony couldn't imagine having more than one at a time. Edith turned the screen so they could see zooming in on the image. The only difference Steve could pick up on was the size.
“I gotta take the glass out.”
“You'll never lose me." He sat next to Steve waiting for the distress to fade.
“I don’t remember much of anything. Is that my real name?” Winter replied, curious.
Steve nodded. They returned to the bunker. There were only three boxes left. The third one had Howard's notes on project rebirth. There were only two notebooks.
"Do you have a Christmas tree?” asked Steve.
“He’s never been good at answering the phone,” said Natasha.
"You'd enjoy scrapbooking," said Natasha.
“Mr. Stark, it’s time.”
Tony sighed he didn’t understand why Steve was still here. He’d gotten more than he deserved with Steve’s forgiveness.
“Don’t, don’t do that to yourself, Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters and magic. And nothing you or I ever trained for,” she said.
"The makeup sex will be amazing," said Natasha.
Steve dropped his bag.
"It better be interesting if getting me out of bed at five in the morning."
“Omega, stop crying.”
"If someone snapped a photo of you coming in, the press will be here in a matter of minutes," said Pepper.
"Dr. Wu will see you now."
“Do you have complaints?”
The light under her skin started to dim as she calmed. It would be easiest to rip off the boards and lift her out. When he stepped onto the deck. Piper cried and the blue light brightening due to stress.
He relaxed when Tony squeezed his shoulder.
“Who are you?!” he growled.
“We have every camera in the city looking for him. Tony sent us the description. We’ll find him. Right now, we have to get the both of you out of here,” explained Hill.
“All I can.”
He kissed Steve on the forehead. Tony went to the bathroom, soaking a hand towel, before going back to the bedroom. Steve smiled softly at him. He rinsed the blood from the omega's skin. Tony bit his lip as a trail of water dripped down the omega's chiseled chest. It shouldn't be turning him on as much as it did. Steve purred, pressing into his touch, enjoying the grooming. He tucked Steve into bed. When he tried leaving Steve’s arm wrapped possessively around his waist. He was given a small taste of Steve’s strength when he attempted to move.
"Why do I want this person helping with my wedding?" asked Steve.
“Just don’t grow up too fast. Not all of us can move as fast you,” said Rune.
“We do,” said Jarvis.
Winter couldn’t clearly place the woman's face. But her scent caused a muscle memory reaction, making him twitch and tense. His head remained bowed, doing his best not to challenge her. She was dangerous. The pup didn't need to know that kind of pain.
The large alpha’s eyes opened.
“How do you know? You lack any control in that state.”
“Let me check on the stew,” said Steve. He went to the stove and took off the lid. The smell reminded him of home. He easily lifted the pot off the heat. Steve smiled. When he was young, he couldn’t lift the pot. He’d have to get his mom or Bucky to do it for him. Tony led him to the bedroom closet.
“Banner, Thor I got nothing to say to you,” said Fury.
“I prefer sympathy.”
“What do you think?”
“Amazing,” he said.
“Do you want me to put him on the list?” asked Edith.
*****
“Have you had any spotting?” asked Edith.
“What?”
Steve shrugged. Tony was thrown onto the bed. Under different circumstances, it would be far more arousing. Maybe he could convince Steve.
“Stark, don’t you hang up on me!” growled Fury.
No, he would know. The metal springs of the bed squeaked as he sat up. He squeezed the mattress, trying to grasp onto something that would give him some sense of control.  He closed his eyes, breathing in deeply. A soft breeze touched against his skin. In the background, there was a buzz of a radio, reporting on a baseball game. It was wrong. His muscles tensed in preparation to fight as the door opened. A uniformed beta woman entered. Her wavy brown hair was untarnished. She posed no apparent threat.
Piper gradually forced them open.
“Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that coming,” said Fury pacing the room. He stopped between two heroes. As stubborn and problematic as they were still heroes. “Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract. I never put all my chips on that number though because I was playing something even riskier. There was an idea Stark knows this called the Avengers Inchoative the idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people to see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to fight the battles we never could."
Then why would they put her in his cell? His fingers searched his neck for any signs of a claim mark, but there was nothing. The fluorescent light shut off. Winter shook his head. These thoughts weren't his to have. Whatever the pup was, instinct demanded him to protect her. He went to his corner. Hoping distance would stop the questions.
He looked down at her. Her pupils were blown. “Daddy.”
“Three.”
Steve stared at the bloodied cards before. Gut-wrenching guilt pulled at him. He should have taken the time. It didn’t seem important. He flipped over one of the images it only made him feel worse.
Steve shook his head. The alpha's breath tickled his skin.
He tried not hurrying away from the alpha, but his stride only slowed when he reached the S.H.I.E.L.D. post office.  He picked up stamps and a box. Steve shoved it in his gym bag as Natasha came into the hall.
"And you promise to get me out too."
"Is he awake?" asked Fury.
“This agent Coulson.”
“It broke”, he said.
“Will you tell me where we’re going for our honeymoon?”
“So this all seems horrible,” said Bruce.
"Steve, he had a breakdown."
"A fan?"
“I’ll take care of it,” said Tony.
“They’re here!” An excited cry rose from the crowd.
Steve was forced to ground, a blade pointed at his stomach. He slammed it away. Steve quickly checked for any harm before getting to his feet.
“No, now’s fine. Actually, you’ll be saving me from this confounded paperwork,” he said.
"We’ll go over the details with you and Stark together."
“He’s at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center.”
“You have more current findings and methods. Those reports are seventy-one years old,” said Banner.
"Is the water okay?" he asked.
“You’ve done good with her, Winter,” said Sir patting his shoulder.
Piper padded after Lena through the halls to the classroom. She took a seat at her small desk at the center of the room. The subjects either got more advance or went off into different branches of the field. She missed drawing. Papa had cleared out a small part of his studio for her. She pushed back at the thought. It stung. She had to keep reminding herself that they didn't want her anymore.
“My own creation turning against me,” said Tony.
Steve took a breath before taking the shot, cringing at the sharp taste, and coughed.
He ran his fingers through Steve's hair. Tony was incapable of producing the purr that would provide the greatest comfort to his mate. He just couldn't do it with Piper still missing. So, Tony brushed his thumb against the claim mark on Steve's neck. Steve gasped awake, leaping from the bed, tumbling to the floor.
“I like the way it smells." Steve cuddled up against him. “Remember today is date night.”
Steve nodded. "We can paint. I've been wanting to try out the new studio."
"I can't-
“Me too.”
"I'm not doing anything to him. He's designed to take commands. His current state is his own doing. Winter shouldn't resist. Denying or resisting an order will only cause him further harm."
"It appears to be Romania," said Jarvis.
“I don’t want you to, but I can’t stop you.”
Steve slid off his shirt.  Tony licked his lips. His hands moved the omega's hips moaning as they rocked together.
“This is your chance to change the design," said Tony.
Steve was too tired for words. Tony backed off. He gathered a few pastries before returning the sanctuary of his room. This time leaving the door unlocked. He doubted the alpha would join him. Steve wasn't sure if he even wanted him too. His night was spent staring up at the ceiling, unable to sleep.
“I can’t talk about, Pep. If could, I would,” she said.
“They’re good for you, Piper.”
Another knock at the door and a beta in scrubs entered. “I’m Dr. Arjun Havaldar. I am the doctor assigned to your husband’s case.” He introduced himself.
“Different,” he said.
“Why did you forgive me?” he asked.
“He did. It took a while longer for me to forgive myself.” He sighed. "What I’m trying to say, Piper, is you need to reframe your way of thinking. You aren't there anymore."
Tony quickly changed putting on a cap, scrubs, and mask. He walked into the sterile room. Steve lay on the table an anesthesiologist was closely watching Steve’s vitals. A curtain hid the area incision from Tony’s direct view. From the gallery Fury, Natasha, and Clint were watching. Tony took notice of the restraints binding Steve’s arms and legs.“Take those off."
"And Phil you can call me, Steve."
"That's normal given its significance in your life. It was an extremely traumatic event," said Barny.
Carl’s face lit up. “Really?”
She shook her head. Winter washed her until the scent of distress faded from her skin. After draining the tub and wrapping her up in a towel, he put her in the clean clothes had Lena brought. They were too big on the pup, but it was better than nothing. Winter tucked her into bed, hoping rest would be the answer to her condition, and took a seat in a chair beside her.
“There are others capable of solving this,” he said.
“Love you too, Pipes.”
“Loki’s scepter. The energy. The Tesseract can’t fight, but you can’t protect yourself against yourself,” said Selvig.
"For what?"
"Dropping you on your head might help with your smartass behavior," said Steve.
Then his eyes locked on a familiar pair of brown eyes.
She hit the ground as electricity seared the air inches above her. She quickly got to her feet.
“Thanks, Phil,” said Steve.
“Ready?” he asked.
"You're scheduled for several meetings," said Jarvis.
“Talk to him and come back when you’re done,” said Banner.
“And Dr. Cho?” asked Steve.
“How long is the flight?” he asked.
“Piper, what are you doing here?”
“I will never get used to it,” said Piper. She’d already gotten used to things she shouldn’t have.
Steve gave a small nod.
"How are you feeling?" asked Tony.
“How did you know I had trouble sleeping?”
So far, three people knew of his pregnancy, four if he included Jarvis, and none of them the pup’s father. Even so, he couldn’t risk telling Tony, now. This mission was something he had to be a part of. If Tony knew about the pup, he'd try to stop Steve. Steve quickly changed, replacing the scent blocker patches on his neck, and ran home. When he arrived, Pepper was still there, wearing shorts and a cotton shirt. She was watching a holographic image of the tower. The woman seemed far too comfortable in his home. This was his den, where he'd raise his pup! Until he was bonded, Steve didn't want a potential rival tempting his alpha. He shook his head. This mindset wasn't right. Tony would never choose her over him.
Steve purred as Tony's fingers ran circles over his stomach.
who isn't ready?” asked Pepper.
“Granddad was cool,” said Piper. She wouldn’t have known it was there if Jarvis hadn’t told her.
The pup was slagging, too tired to follow the instinct to stay alert in the face of danger. She’d expended the last of her energy confronting Lena. He picked her up. She wound her arms around his neck and hid her face, yawning softly. He nudged her with his shoulder. It wasn’t safe to sleep here.
"How long will you be with us?" asked Tony.
The introduction of the two super soldiers went well. Lena just wished she’d gotten to Sergeant Barnes before Arnim Zola. Zola’s work was sloppy, treating his subject like a machine instead of human. Unlike machines, humans were flawed; that had to be taken into account. Subjects needed to be handled humanely enough to earn the proper responses.
"Yes, sir."
The director left. Steve set the letter on the bedside table. Whatever it contained, he was sure he wasn't ready for. Steve read over the files on his desk. All his friends from the Howling Commandos were dead. His hand landed on Peggy’s file. He took a breath before opening it. A large amount of it was redacted. From what he could tell, she had a successful career. She’d gotten married and had two children. He’d wanted that so badly after the war.
“Yes, it an omegas scent sweetens as they enter pregnancy. So these a very much necessary if you want to keep this a secret.”
“I am a super soldier. And I happen to be really smart too.”
“He was a dear friend,” said Steve. His voice was only a whisper. But he could have been more.
“Clean her up,” Lena said, then left them.
“I’ll call you,” said Steve.
Piper slowly opened her eyes. She wiped the drool from her chin. Her neck ached from her heavy collar. The swelling in his eye had gone down enough for it to open.
“You know you enjoy it,” said Tony, smirking.
“As ready as I’ll ever be,” said Steve.
“Ms. Potts and Mr. Rhodes,” said Jarvis.
He ran. Partly from the kid but mostly from his own panic.
"No," said Bruce. He understood why S.H.I.E.L.D. would want such information along with countless other organizations.
“But sir!”
Thor was shot off the cliff.
"She can't sleep, Tony. It's not that she doesn't want to. She has too much energy," said Steve.
"I'm fine," he said through gritted teeth.
“I will.”
“Everything is good but they are known for their burgers and milkshakes,” said Clint.
He took Steve's hand, sighing at his bruised and bloodied knuckles. The wounds had long disappeared, but the blood still painted Steve’s skin. “You have to wrap your hands.”
“You win.”
"I can't say for certain but I assume it will further empower and strengthen the time it takes for her to regenerate. Extremis soldiers recovered from fatal in hours sometimes minutes and could regenerate limbs. If activated she’ll be able to do the same. I doubt it will happen at such a young age,” said Bruce.
He walked the private plot. Two regal black headstones stood at the center. He brushed away the leaves and twigs that had built up there. No one has visited here in years. He placed his hand on the cold black marble, before taking a seat in the grass. It read:
“I need Stark working at 100% on the scepter. He can’t do that when he’s worried about you. So for everyone’s sake work it out,” she said.
“Because of him,” said Fury, pointing to Thor.
“A band or DJ?” asked Pepper.
“They had to be great, because you’re pretty amazing, Rune.”
“That’s all that matters,” said Steve.
“It always leads there."
"I wouldn't call it history. He's more of an inconvenience. I think he's bitter that chose you an inferior alpha, his words over a prime example of an alpha specimen as him again his words not mine. He's one of the few alphas who enjoyed my scent."
“I don’t think it counts if we’re grounded,” said Steve.
“Then why are you in here with me?” he asked.
“Jarvis is everywhere,” said Piper.
“Jarvis, scan this over for me,” he said.
"They were S.H.I.E.L.D."
Artie Shaw – He was an American clarinetist, composer, bandleader, and actor. Born on May 23, 1910. He was widely regarded as one of the finest jazz clarinetists. Shaw led one of the United State popular big bands in the 1930s to early 1940s. He had many hit records.
Rheingold Beer - was brewed at Rheingold brewery in New York holding 35% of the state market at its peak. Every year the would hold a Miss Rheingold contest the winner would be featured in the beer's advertisement. In the 1940s and 1950s in New York was a highly anticipated event.
“When he’s not that thing the guy is like a Steven Hawking,” said Phil.
“The mission report is waiting in your room,” she said.
“Yes, that's very manageable,” said Pepper.
“You’re stressed,” said Steve.
"Not helpful."
The junker lowered.
She gathered herself before entering the building. Happy screams and the laughter of children reverberated through a massive playground, different activity centers wove through the entire space.
She screamed until her voice went hoarse. Tears burned at her eyes.
“What did you do that?” asked Tony.
“I’m Jeri Hogarth. I represent Mr. Stark."
"You told us there were no prisoners!" said Steve in a harsh whisper, not wanting to wake the sleeping pups.
“They likely are connected but not directly enough to help in Peru’s government. Be we discuss this further I suggest you take two of those pills,” she said.
“Oh, I have something for you; look over,” said Pepper.
He returned to the office. Barny sat peacefully in his chair.
“May I have this dance, Oliva?” asked Steve.
Tony groaned. He couldn’t say no to those puppy dog eyes.
The gentle crash of the waves against the shore was the only sound between them. He expected questions. Instead, he was given an apology and promised his secret wouldn’t be exposed. It was all he wanted and more. The grief of the moment hadn't lost its potency. Steve became lost in the peaceful sound of Tony’s heartbeat and purr. They stayed like the for some time neither, wanting to move. Steve sighed; he was getting too close. He got up.
“He’s on his way home,” said Jarvis.
"People say these shadows are the marks of souls going to heaven. Except the bomb guy went to hell on account that he didn't get a shadow. That's why there's only five."
"Yeah, it’s a limited edition.”
Phil nodded.
"I'm guessing I don't feel like the average omega," said Steve when caught Matt's expression.
“We all have our coping mechanism. Yours is unhealthy, but I understand why you handle it in such a way,” said Steve.
*****
"HOW?!”
“It’s an impressive cage, not built I think for me,” he said.
*****
Each of them jumped to their feet the next morning when someone banged on the door of the jet.
“You clean up this mess. If anything is missing, I’ll know. Jarvis, I want all tech on lockdown,” said Tony.
“Sure,” said Steve.
“Who’s your friend?”
“Does he-
"When I went feral, I didn't fight. I let him take them on alone. I've always fought even in that state."
Steve bit his lip.
Steve smiled. "That has to be one of the cheesiest things you've ever said."
Beach Master – is the dominant male elephant seal that controls beach and mate with the females
"I'm sure they'll be overjoyed," said Jarvis.
“I’m sorry, Daddy.”
"I was told she was an army medic," said Steve.
“I love both of you,”
"Less of a target."
“She’s healthy,” said Tony.
He turned his back to his mate. Tony made Steve face him.
"Feel free to look around, Steve,” said the beta.
The alpha kneeled in front of her. The switch was within arm's reach, but she didn’t try to grab it. One false move and Winter went boom.
“Valid point."
“Get to the assets. Eliminated any unessential staff you encounter and protect the two assets. Once you're done, meet me at the air deck.”
“Spooked but fine,” said Tony.
“I don’t want to get anything yet.”
His answer hit her hard. It felt as if a bucket of ice water had been dumped on her. Sir had been keeping her so busy she had hardly thought of escape. By the time she returned to her room, she was mentally and physically drained. She'd fallen asleep on her feet a few times. The only reason she'd gotten into bed those times was due to Winter carrying her there.
"Have you ever heard of that brand, Edith?"
“Tell him I’ll be right up.”
"We will always accept you. We can be very kind as long as you accept us, in return." Lena’s voice was soft but firm, open … honest.
“It’s only by chance. If you could’ve fit in that playground tube, it would be you."
“Can we have that?” asked Rune.
His phone rang.
“And.”
He made it inside. The place was a mess. There was a passed out one sleeping on a Ping-Pong table. He maneuvered his way through the building. Tony slowed when heard another guard speaking. He shocked the man unisonous, taking his gun. The beta female there was too high or drunk to care that he was there.
“Guess what,” she said.
It was a new sensation for her. She didn't get sick. Booboos healed in seconds. Not feeling well just wasn't something super soldiers did.
“He told you nothing me?” asked Steve.
Piper looked at the small green trees. She'd eat them every day without complaint if it meant she could be back with her parents. Tears started streaming down her face. She tried wiping them away but it only got worse, becoming a full wail.
“I just told you that," said Tony finishing his drink.
“You’re taking this awfully well, doctor. I thought you’d be more hesitant to take on Piper and Rune as your patients given how she reacted to Dr. Bloom,” said Steve.
After spending a few hours with Happy, Tony went down to the lobby. A mass of press was gathered by the entrance. As soon as Tony left the hospital, he was swarmed by reporters.
It wasn’t a flat denial.
“You want to think about removing yourself from this environment doctor,” she said.
It would be a few days until her subjects were fully recovered. There were fifteen fractures between them.
She smiled tiredly.
“I’ll call them, so you can at least get a start. How’d he do?” asked Phil.
“That’s a stupid question. You know exactly how I feel. So, tell me what you want and leave.”
“Good answer,” said Steve.
“Can you tell me a penguin story?” Carl asked when everyone had finished eating and the kitchen was tidied.
“I’ll be careful.”
“Don’t, I wanted and needed this.”
Steve nuzzled against Tony's neck, paying particular attention to the claim mark he placed there. Together they eased back into bed.
“No.”
“Did I wake you up?”
“Sure,” she smiled. “If it’s a girl, Natasha is a great name."
“We’ll have to bring in a specialist to talk with them,” said Maria. None of them were trained in the delicate nature of questioning a child.
"Going through Piper's baby photos."
They went to the control room Fury was waiting for them there. Taking a seat at the table where they first gathered. Several of which were empty.
Steve reached out and touched the image. “Ours.”
“Then don’t take my stuff,” said Tony.
"Steve?"
“I’ll try not to,” said Steve.
Piper finished yawning softly. He fixed his shirt before kissing her on the forehead.
“Shouldn’t we give this information to Rhodes. This won't help your current standing with your husband," said Jarvis.
Tony placed the shield in a glass painting chamber. Robotic arms carefully repainted the old design.
He checked himself in the mirror. His pants were a bit snug around his waist.
Rhodes ran out the door. Grateful to breath fresh air.
“Good.”
The alpha returned to his seat on the counter. He tried to ignore the intense gaze of the alpha. Steve focused his attention on cooking. He sipped as wine. Steve wished he could get drunk just to calm his nerves. He set dinner on the counter. The lights dimmed.
Steve's line of thinking wasn't surprising given the era he'd grown up in. Even more so since Steve approaching his preheat. If they still lived in that era, what Steve said would be very much true.
George met with the parents before leaving.
“Ohh, those shoulders.”
“Exactly.”
“I’ll try,” he said. Steve jaw’s clenched as cramping twisted through the muscles of his abdomen. For the first time in more than seven decades, he was entering the early stages of heat. It would only get worse as his heat grew closer.
"True, but I'm in agreement with Captain Rogers. What you did today was foolish," said Jarvis.
They went into the elevator. Her eyes went wide when she stepped foot in the lab. It was a biologist's dream.
"Hangman," offered Steve.
“They could be highly trained,” said Natasha. There was a clear changed in her voice as she realized the apparent blandness of their task.
“Prenatal vitamins. Take one a day,” she said. Then she handed him some translucent bandages.
“There she is,” said Peggy.
“No.”
Steve returned to the penthouse. His hand went over his stomach. People would want his baby. That would be a constant threat they'd have to look out for.
The feral side gave way to Tony in a desperate attempt to help their mate. Tony looked straight at the man before him, not daring to look down, knowing it would break the forced calm.
Tony groaned as Killian heated his armor.
Steve left, running directly into Kate. They to stop running into each other like this. He wasn't sure if she was doing it intentionally or if it were a coincidence.
"What do you want to do for your bachelor party? As your best man, I should have a clue on what you have planned," said Rhodes.
“Papa?”
“I know.”
"Pickles, we don't have any," said Steve.
He pulled away from her slightly.
“Which makes me love it all the more,” said Pepper.
Bruce handed her over to Steve. She whined wanting to be returned.
“Not your type,” she said.
"That's good too," smiled Tony. Steve was still nosing his neck. “Why didn’t you take your bike home?”
“Could you give us a moment alone?” asked Steve.
“After this session, we’ll figure that out,” he said.
Steve read it over. It held all the key aspects like not being marked.
“Winter?”
“That will keep you alive.”
“I understand your reasoning. It wasn’t wrong, Steve."
"I'm sorry for getting angry with you before. I shouldn't have gotten so upset."
He shoved the book to the bottom of the stack. The other books were more reasonable. He started reading. Steve was halfway through one of the books when Tony came up. He marked the page he was on, before closing it.
Steve ran his hand through hair. He had to say something. What he didn't know. Barny hadn't told him what to say. There was no one there besides him and Tony.
"Could you hold her for a minute?" asked Tony.
“I'm already strong. And I don't want to be big like you when I get older."
“I can do it.”
“It’s fine. I want to get this over with,” said Steve.
“I just sent you the footage.”
He waited for the alpha to take a bite and try it.
“Alpha," whimpered Steve.
Steve was always about a bit self-conscious about his appearance. After the serum even more so.
“Helping my boyfriend move out," he said.
“You did,” said Tony.
She bit her lip, deciding not to ask what was wrong. It didn’t feel right. “Can I be excused? I gotta go potty.”
“He got back safely. I’ve got him calm.”
“I think it was who I was with," said Steve.
“What you don’t want to join the mile high club?” said Tony.
Piper came out of the bathroom feeling nice and clean. The room smelled less strongly of cleaner now than when they’d entered. She did the same as Winter, scenting the room while he showered. Piper climbed into bed, yawning ready for bed. Questions in her mind were making it harder to settle into sleep.
“That old bird is terrifying,” said Happy.
“To break every bone in man’s body I’d say he was extremely angry.”
Airing out the car did little to relax them. Tony white-knuckled wheel.
“Normally, he’s guarded slow to let others near. Yet you managed to crack through his armor in days,” said Natasha.
“How did you know?” asked Piper.
Tony smirked. “How fitting. Him being the universal giver while I’m the universal taker."
“Steve?”
“If that were true you would have gotten a call. No need to rush," said Tony.
“Tony."
When he returned to the kitchen, Tony was swiping through images of different suits.
“More as in therapist. Like the doctor I talk to.”
“Grief that runs as deep as yours has tendency seep into physical presentation, causing symptoms that mimic those of heart attack. After the loss of a child- ”
“Ouch,”
"I'm sure. Get rid of it."
Tony’s hand ran up his inner thighs. His legs parted slightly. The moment was ruined when his phone rang.
Steve took a breath trying to relax.
“Tired, uncomfortable, hot.” The realization hit. “I can’t be.”
“It was something from the past. And I tried getting rid of it so many times. You don’t know how much I regret keeping it,” he cried.
“Well, this one may prove more interesting,” said Edith. She swiped the screen, and a new story appeared.
“Nothing,” he said
“Kinda,” Piper agreed.
“Now you do the same.”
“We’ll find her. I swear,” promised Tony.
The gunfire was all-consuming. Piper fell backward.
"People will try to take out baby," said Steve. Tony's hold around him tightened.
“Who were you put against?”
"I'm happy to have you here. You can borrow my bike. It’s not a Harley but it will get you where you’re going,” said Tony.
"What are you wearing?"
“Steve?”
“Your old cell has been repaired. I’m here to take you back,” said Lena.
“You have to help me," said Steve.
“Pup, wake up.”
“Daddy, look it’s, Captain America.”
“What’s this?”
"Nothing has gotten past animal testing," said Tony.
“After her body was found a large amount of money was gifted to family. Enough so they’d be set for life,” said Bruce.
“What do you mean?”
“No.”
“He has to adjust to me being here,” said Pepper, walking up behind him.
“How’s your head?”
She shook away her shock.
Tony still held it out. He sighed taking it. Steve left for the beach. He laid out a towel and sunbathed, closing his eyes. When he heard someone coming toward him. Their scent was unfamiliar. He straightened taking a less vulnerable position. A camera clicked.
She was brought out of her cell. Her wrists and ankles were shackled. The guards lead her to the interrogation room. She sat in the stainless steel chair. Almost laughing when Rumlow entered the cell. The cameras were likely off. The timestamps would be altered when the footage was shown to Piper's parents.
“Why not?”
“Yes, Steve I’m your boyfriend,” said Tony before yawning. It was nice to see how much the title meant to Steve.
"Keep it that way.”
"Not like this."
Their power overwhelmed them both. In a blinding flash, they were thrown in opposite directions, falling unconscious.
"He was."
“What do you think?” she asked.
"What are you looking for?" he asked.
"But in his current condition, it could go either way."
Lena couldn't forget what she had here. Her mind was in Antarctica, but her heart belonged to Sokovia. It proved a difficult balance to keep, especially when she had a new subject. Henry came in with the newspaper, sighing heavily. Piper was on the front page.
“You’ve seen me at my worst and were there for me. Let me be there for you,” said Steve.
Steve hobbled up and tried following him, but Natasha grabbed his arm.
He went for the door. Tony grabbed his arm. He yanked away.
He yawned. All he wanted was sleep but the cramping agony coiling down his back put an end to that hope. He whimpered, clenching down the mattress. Steve bit a pillow stopping himself from screaming. His eyes watered as the seconds ticked by.
"Come on."
“Thank you.”
Steve’s shoulders went at ease.
“If there was an alpha that hurt you broke your trust and he was on your team would go back for them?” he asked.
Tony got to the hospital. It hadn’t taken him long for California. He found peace in the sky flying at top speeds. A nurse lead him to Happy’s room. The man was in rough shape but he was breathing on his own.
The limited tight faced expression of grief that could be shown in war, but the true extent agony could be seen in a soldier's eyes—that anger and pure unbridled hatred at those who committed such horrendous crime against humanity.
“Then why did you say it?” asked Tony.
“Did Tony know?”
She ignored him and released his restraints.
“You went feral for a little while,” said Jarvis.
“I thought so,” he said. Rhodes’ expression changed.
“You knock him out?” Slight impressed that Stark actually managed the feat.
"Jarvis. Jarvis? Don't leave me, buddy."
“You got yourself great catch, Cap. I don’t fully understand it though,” he said.
“Yes, Sir.”
"Isn't water good for plants?" asked Piper.
The woman at the front desk returned.
"Something simple."
Of course, there was a catch. “What is it?”
“Steve?”
“No,” said Hill.
“I’m telling you it isn’t!”
“Piper.”
“Do you have PTSD?”
"Listen, War Machine was a little too aggressive. This sends a better message,” said Rhodes.
“Hey, Tony,” he said.
“You should be able to,” she said.
He wasn't of the sleepless nights that came with a baby. The battle had taken its toll. How much so he couldn't tell yet.  He'd seen the fearful expression crossing Tony's expression, moments before he fell asleep.
"It's so hard to be patient," said Steve.
"So, you couldn't save him?"
Her voice was tired.
“I was watching that,” said Steve.
“What?” asked Steve.
“How?”
May 11, 2012
“Wake up!"
“Drop the tone or I'll hang up."
"Sir."
“Steve, you okay?”
“Of course.”
“Close the door,” said Lena.
“More,” he begged.
“Tony, you’ve paid your dues this isn’t your problem you and Steve have a baby on the way,” said Rhodes.
“Jarvis, where is the first aid kit?”
“If I make a grocery list, can Happy pick it up?” asked Steve.
"And if it's a girl?" said Steve.
“You just said you were,” she countered.
Rune snorted, before realizing she was serious.
"How much longer?" asked Steve.
"A janitor's closet I think," said Tony.
The elderly woman just smiled. "It's good to have you back. How long will you be here?"
“What do you want to know?” asked Piper, rubbing her wrists.
Steve followed Jarvis’s directions to the lab. It was the same setup as the lab in New York, but bigger. He kept glancing back at the door, so tempted to return.
“Walter Cronkite. He had a nice voice and spoke the truth of what was happening in Europe and North Africa. Is he still around?" asked Steve.
He took a broom and dustpan up. Steve started sweeping up the broken glass. It could have been worse. Tony hadn’t gotten into one his suits. When he finished cleaning up he took a seat at the counter.
"My name is Peter," he said.
Winter picked her up. She cuddled into his neck. He leaned against the foot of the bed. Out of the hazed nothingness of his past, a song came forth. He started humming the tune.
“George.”
“Yet you’re confused to why they didn’t want you around,” he said.
“You are so perfect.”
Bruce sat in the kitchen with Edith. He’d expected more raised voice from Steve and Tony, but they seemed to have figured it out in a peaceful manner.
“Very nice,” said Tony.
“Can I join you?”
"You'll catch the a death out here dressed like that. Come by the fire."
Thor watched as he got things ready. “Is there anything I can help with?”
"I need just a single strand of hair from you," said Tony.
“Did I wake you?”
“See you later,” he said.
chree
“Even if Barton didn’t tell Loki about the tower it was still all over the news,” said Bruce.
"Things are evolving slowly but surely."
“I’ll go get, Piper.”
“They are changing how we met,” said Steve looking up from the packet.
"No, I don't want to wake her."
"It won't get out."
“How was he?” asked Rhodes.
Tony rejoined him, and Steve rested his head on the alpha's chest, closing his eyes. The soothing beat of his mate's heart allowed him to finally rest.
Steve nodded and returned to his room. On his desk was the mission report. He skimmed it over. Then he put it in the shredder. He took the weapon from his holster and cleaned it thoroughly. Once done he showered. By the time he finished everything, he needed to do it was noon. Steve took out his phone. Tony made it for him. Its voice command, which made it easy for Steve to figure out. The phone even explained how it worked. He called Tony.
At five in the morning, he got out of bed. Steve's hand searched for him. He kissed his husband's forehead before pulling the blankets over him. He made breakfast. About an hour later, the rumbling of Steve. Steve stumbled into the kitchen. He tensed when he felt Steve's glare boring into the back of his head.
“Steve, I’m honestly happy for the two of you. There’s no reason to be embarrassed,” said Rhodes.
“I don’t mind. I miss you and Piper.”
“I’m will never leave you, Steve. You will always be my mate. I don’t want us to be at each other’s throats. I know your breaking point. I’ve seen it and have gotten you back. I'm not sure if I can do it again right now. I'd try god, would I try. Do you not see how close you are to falling over the edge. Can't you see I'm just as close to falling as you?"
“People are complicated and not kind complex I like,” said Piper.
“Steve?”
Piper pulled her notebook close. “I haven’t finished this question, yet.”
“No.”
“I love you,” said Tony.
“Alright.”
Steve bolted out from the room. His inner chaos wracked his nerves. Time slowed. His pup was in danger he couldn’t move fast enough. He sprinted the three blocks. The building was nothing but darkened ruins.
Steve went to the elevator. He put on a smile when it reached the penthouse. Piper started crawling toward him. He picked her up, nuzzling her. She purred softly. He purred in return. Everything in him needed this time. Steve took her with him into the bedroom for some cuddle time.
Tony quietly moved to her bedroom. He pulled the blankets over her. She could be a headache, but he loved her with everything in him. He hadn’t thought it was possible to feel that way. Tony didn't know what he'd do without her.
Steve smiled.
“I have to make a call before I go,” said Steve.
"Fine, it takes more than that to shake me up. I just don’t like a stranger so close to our den,” said Steve.
*****
Rhodes jabbed him with the gun.
“I’m going to follow this guy. I’m going to run his plates. If it gets rough, so be it.”
He paused when he saw the massive nest Steve built in the master bedroom. He went to the guest bedroom. The nest there was simple only made a few thin cotton sheets. The omega was spread out, taking up the entire bed.  Even in sleep, he looked uncomfortable. Tony sat on the floor next to the bed.
Tony was right. It was best to be cautious. He glanced at his watch. His appointment was soon.
Winter lay in the center of his cell with Piper protectively tucked in his arms.
“Theodore.”
Jeff nodded. He entered the holding room, quietly approaching the girl. “You awake?”
Nat gave Steve a moment with his thought, moving to the window. Part of her was tempted to say those he lost were watching down on him, but that would be a lie. She'd never believed in such things. Below two flower girls sitting excitedly by the entranceway. Neither of the girls had hair and looked rather sickly.
"Says
Hansen nodded. She got into the back seat of Pepper's car. The drive to Pepper's home was quiet. Steve spent the entire trip watching the scenery pass. At his feet was his shield and Tony's helmet. They pulled into Pepper's driveway. She unlocked the large double doors.
Piper went to the window. There was a beaten-up old Ford truck in the driveway.
“We’re having a baby,” said Steve.
“Steve?”
“Yes, sir."
She herded them inside. They discussed the events. Steve peacefully sipped at his tea. Watson sat in the small space left between him and Tony. He rubbed the dog’s ears.
"Thanks," said Steve half-heartedly.
“That was before the serum,” said Steve.
“Steve, it’s normal for some of your level experience. No need to apologize,” he said. Seeing Steve reach climax more than made up for it.
Steve clutched his head, rocking back and forth.
"We aren't." Steve's hand went to his neck briefly touching the place where an alpha would likely leave their mark.
“I believe it’s a type of candy,” said Thor.
She stood on her tiptoes and touched her hand to New York. “This is where I’m from. New York.”
“Sorry,” said Steve.
“Somewhat,” said Tony.
“Why do adults have to be so complicated?” asked Carl.
“Thank you for doing this,” said Steve.
Steve sighed again. He loved Piper more than anything in the world, but he wanted to do more than be at home with her. Following the daily baby routine wasn’t fulfilling anymore, not that he didn't love every intimate moment with her. He just wanted something more.
“Be still.”
Steve followed Tony to Howard’s study. The room was untouched by Jarvis’s redesign. It screamed Howard. It was painted a deep red, and the smell of tobacco smoke still stuck to the walls. A large desk was in the center of the room. A rolling leather armchair was behind it.
Tony nodded, following Steve toward the bedroom. He stopped.
He went in, taking stock of the bar audience. Country music was playing in the background. There was only one weapon he could spot, the sheriff's revolver. Toward the back, he found who he was looking for. She sat alone with a heavy expression, fiddling with some dog tags.
“I’m not questioning him,” said Steve.
to. Yet, instinct was forcing him. This was wrong. He wanted to be numb.
“Steve?”
“What the hell did you say to him?!” growled the doctor.
No, Tony is straightforward enough to tell him if he needed space. He would call later. He returned to the training facility. Steve parked in the garage. As he walked to the entrance of the building he saw Clint pacing on the roof. Something happened to put him in the mood. Steve climbed up on the roof to check on his friend. He barely dodged an arrow zipping past his face, grazing his cheek.
"Let's get out of here."
"What do you want me to say?" said Tony.
“Keeps daddy alive.”
“Of course."
He groaned slowly opening his eyes. Natasha was sitting across from him. “What do you want?”
Steve smiled and started purring. He was a bit surprised when Piper started sucking her thumb. It hadn’t been a habit before. It seemed to be calming her down. Once they finished Frozen, Sing was next. Steve paused Sing when he noticed both pups were asleep. Jarvis turned off the TV. Steve picked up Piper.
*****
The two fell asleep together.
Tony walked her to the elevator.
“I don’t either,” she said.
"I'm sure we'll come up with something," said Steve. He pushed his nose to Tony's throat, searching for another's scent, but nothing. Shivering when Tony returned the gesture.
His chest ached when Piper whined for him. “There are bottles in the fridge."
Steve was slow to notice the added the destruction of the penthouse.
“As much as I would love that I have work. And I’m not all that good, but I know a few people who’d love to teach you.”
“Only testing some new flight routes,” he said.
Tony wanted to get back to his mate. He sent a text and photo to Rhodes.
“Can you give me a range?” asked Edith.
In 1941 Lillie P. Bliss gave a great deal of her art collection to the MoMA. That donation made the foundation of the MoMa's collection. During the Great Depression, they sold three pieces of the Bliss collection to buy Starry Night.
“No,” he said.
"Do you want to try to play w-
“The average tank in WW2 was fifty-four tons. Seventy years in ice yet you’ve grown stronger,” said Phil.
This was no one's fault but his own.
“A Yutyrannus. No, I don't have feathers so I’m umm … a compsognathus,” she said.
“She was only checking up on me."
“Don’t do anything rash,” he said.
Rhodes nodded. Tony handed her off. Piper reached out and patted out his face. She smiled.
"What brings you here director? I doubt you would have come here if it weren't important," said Steve.
"She's waiting for you in her office," said Barny.
“The one next to the nursery.”
“What happened here?”
“Engage retro-reflection panels,” ordered Hill.
“Get away from her!” growled Tony.
Steve enjoyed the walk, knowing he could handle any threat that appeared. He hadn’t told Tony about the idiots who had tried mugging him. That encounter ended with twelve broken bones between the two attackers. Steve pushed open the door to Fogwell’s gym. The room was painted blue and smelled dusty. It was so old fashion, Steve felt perfectly comfortable there. He was probably one of the few omegas to come here. In his time, omegas weren’t allowed in boxing gyms unless they were arm candy to the alphas that ran them. When he was young, he would climb onto the dumpster outside the gym and watch the alphas box, trying to learn. That was so long ago.
"Steve is in danger I have to go."
“Have you made a reservation?” she asked.
Steve relaxed slightly when Tony left. After ten minutes, he regretted his decision. His stomach turned uncomfortably at the separation. He went to Tony’s lab. The alpha was working on one of his suits.
“Ok.” She nodded.
“I’ve got it.”
Tony was out bedside him. Steve didn’t want to move. He yawned.
“She isn’t-
“It's quite a home,” said Steve.
Steve went kitchen sink and tried washing his paint-stained hands. He got ready for his morning run. The base was quite so early the morning; the trainees wouldn’t start their morning drills till 5:30 am. That gave him a thirty-minute head start over the recruits. It was chilly outside. He sped through the hiking paths and obstacle course. Running past several winded trainees. At eight, he returned to the base. Steve went to his room and showered. He went to his closet. His wardrobe was rather, simple except for his dress uniform. What should he wear? Would Tony care? He settled on a gray t-shirt and blue plaid shirt, dark blue jeans, and boots. Steve checked his reflection. It would have to do. He looked at the clock; it was only 8:30 am.
“Would remember if you did?”
"You're right, I didn't deserve him. Here’s where you’re wrong he was already perfect.”
"They play music," she said.
“So will you tell me what that was about?” asked Piper.
He moved to the center of the room.
He closed the distance between, wrapping his arms around Tony. Their chest firmly pressed together. His face hidden in his alpha’s neck. Sighing as Tony’s hands ran circles down his back.
The suite opened, revealing the president.
The blue glitter pen broke in her hand. “Shoot!”
“Why are you so calm?! It isn’t the first time this has happened! I was so close to hitting her,” Steve said roughly, glaring when he caught Tony smirking. “What is wrong with you?!”
“A few more months before you can do that with me again.”
"I'm sorry for calling on a holiday, but I wanted to tell you I'm moving in with Tony. Will that be an issue?"
The plane exploded behind them.
“What’s this?” he asked.
Loki watched the destruction from his perch. The building may be ugly, but there was something to be said for the view.
“I need a break,” said Steve.
“It isn’t me, though! You don’t think I want to rip him apart for what he did. I’m not that strong of man, Steve.”
“There won’t be much to see at this stage.”
“I’m fine."
“Yes."
"Okay, Steve, but I doubt that will ever happen," he said.
Tony maneuvered Steve’s below him, earning a soft almost playful growl from the omega. It was soothed as he kissed a trail down Steve’s neck, grazing his against the soft flesh every now and then. He moved his knee between Steve’s legs. Steve rutted against him trying to get friction. Those big blue eyes were unfocused with lust. His fingers fumbled with the button to Steve’s pants. Finally, he got undone yanking down the zipper. When he tried yanking them off completely it earned a low warning growl. He stopped. Tony slid his hand underneath the fabric.
"Tony Stark," said Steve.
“Visiting your boo after this?” asked Natasha.
“No, I was checking if you were free. I could come back another time,” he said.
Tony closed the footage from the penthouse. That went better than expected. The elevator stopped on the lab floor. Deep growls echoed from within it. For the briefest of moments, he thought it another alpha challenging him. The baser instinct faded when he saw an agitated Cap. His eyes were dilated, feral.
“Where am I really?” he asked.
The next seventy-two hours were key. She’d have to keep an eye on caged pair, as leaving in them in the hands of techs would end failure. Everything was fragile. Lena sighed. She would have to remain here a bit longer. Helmut was due for leave. Part of her wished Helmut would retire but he was at the peak of his military career head of special forces unit. She would miss his return home. Lena picked up her phone. It was best to tell him sooner. Hopefully, he would be in range. The phone rang several times before he picked up.
“It will work even though I’m different,” said Steve.
“It’s okay to miss them,” said Natasha.
It was a safety for him. As long as that reactor was alight, his mate was safe. His mate would always be there, but it was a safety crutch for him. He couldn’t let his need for a crutch to affect his family.
*****
“I feel it more deeply than you could imagine. The bond between pup and bearer is unbreakable. A blessing when together, but a curse when forced apart.”
“What is your type?” she asked.
“Why not?” asked Tony.
“I promise she won’t hurt you.”
“Are you guys okay?” asked Steve.
"You don't like it?"
It was a noncommittal response.
"You're processing this well."
April 19, 2013
"With you as my husband can you blame me."
“I hope not I was enjoying it before that happened,” said Steve.
“I’ll leave you with the address. If he’s not interesting, you’ll get the thrill of telling me I told you so,” said Fury.
“Can’t.”
“Did you print it brail?” asked Tony.
“Did she break a rib again?”
"Why, Jarvis?!" He flung back the blankets. Now that he was up, there was no getting back to sleep.
“Tony, I can’t. I mean I could but-”
"We're just glad you could make it," said Steve.
“Thank you.”
“Is that a problem, Dr. Zemo?”
Steve went to the bathroom to change. He unzipped the garment. His finger pausing on the fabric of the sweater on the hanger. It was the same one he wore that night in front of the fireplace. He pushed his nose into the woolen fabric before putting it on.
“Then let her go.”
"It's been a long day. As much as I'd love to come home there are a few things I have to take care of here. I've finished my work but I think I have to meet with Dr. Turner." Tony would drop the concern or any complaint about him not being home by him dropping Turner's name.
“Good,” said Steve.
"I guess I would," she said with a smile.
“I heard it over this,” said Thor taking out his earbud.
“How do you feel about going back to Germany?” she asked.
“Steve, you're safe your in the penthouse floor of Stark Tower in Manhattan New York. It's the 17th of January 2012. It is 1:30 am,” said Jarvis.
She looked at the stuffed bunny in her arms, then suddenly plucked out its eyes. She turned the plastic eyes over in her fingers. They seemed normal. Piper tossed them aside, then ripped open its stomach, removing all the cotton fluff, but found nothing. It was just a normal stuffed animal. Even so, she didn't restuff the bunny. Piper joined Theodore. She played with the deflated bunny.
Winter couldn’t remember, but instinct told him she was safe. More than safe, there was some unknown connection between them that he couldn’t even begin to process. It was terrifying, yet he wanted to keep it. She pulled away.
Steve undressed, changing into the gown given to him. He closed his eyes and laid back on the padded exam table. Edith was quick as always.
“Then I’ll help.”
He'd have to order a plastic sheet for her bed and pull-ups. Steve was sure that wouldn't go over well with his daughter. As soon as she’d been potty-trained she refused to wear them, saying they were for babies. He quietly opened the door. Her eyes instantly opened. He sat on the side of the bed. She looked so small in the giant cushioned bed.
His vision whited out. Steve’s arched off the bed as waves of pleasure swept through his clenched form. In the background his alpha moaned, only increasing his bliss. Steve further relaxed when the toy knotted. They both took the time to enjoy the aftershock of their orgasm. The toy’s knot deflated. He groaned uncomfortably as the toy slid from. Steve blush deeply when he realized Tony was staring at him.
The trap door closed. Loki continued to gaze at him in amused fascination.
"Don't tempt me."
“What is it?”
“Friday, I want you there.”
The doors to their prison opened. Killian walked in. Steve raised his head. The man had Tony’s scent on him. Killian opened the door of his cell. He snapped at the alpha when he tried carding his fingers through his hair.
The next morning Bruce had news for them.  Steve sat nervously in the examination room with Tony next to him. Piper was tucked safely in his arms. He was scared.
“Tony, can you show me your claim,” she said. Edith wasn’t going to risk an attempt at touching.
"He'll be dealt with," said Steve.
“She clever. There’s more to her than what she claims,” said Natasha.
They laid back on the couch. Two needed to comfort of each other’s touch. Steve rested his head on Tony’s chest, listening to his heartbeat.
"We had a deal. I'm following through."
Tony didn't know what to do with that. He braced himself for what Steve had to say.
"What's the time frame?" asked Steve.
“It was my mother’s recipe,” he said.
“I’m sorry, sweetheart.” He ran his fingers through Steve’s hair. “Jarvis, how’s Piper?"
Clint’s phone rang.
“Well, it’s an old-fashioned gumption,” said Fury.
“Loki is manipulating you,” said Natasha.
“I’m not a kept omega!” he snarled.
“I don’t need an apology, Steve. I only want to know why,” said Tony.
“She likes you,” said Steve.
Natasha and Clint stripped. Steve signed and did the same. Keeping his gaze focused anywhere but his naked friends.
"I'm your doctor, Steve. I won't judge you. It's an uncomfortable subject, but it's a conversation that needs to be had. Anything you tell me stays between us."
“Tony, come you need to eat,” said Steve.
Tony nodded. The footage appeared in front of him. Something was calming to watching the omega sleep so peacefully. He lost track of time as he worked.
She began crying in full, distress leaking off her. The smell was choking. Winter
Distress was leaking off the omega. It was impossible to think clearly with that smell poisoning the air. Tony climbed into bed with Steve. He circled an arm around Steve, pulling the omega's face toward his neck, running his fingers through the beauty's golden brown hair.
“Can we can gain access from the aircraft area?” asked Steve, prodding the photos.
His eyes widened at the little girl sleeping peacefully on his chest. He shot away from her. The pup whined at being jolted awake. She stood up rubbing the sleep from her eyes. A ragged stuffed rabbit was in her hand.
for him. But
"I've got to go."
Through her interactions with Piper, she’d have the girl believe there was a chance to escape a reason for hope. Hope, she could manipulate.
“Making a flight plan for Tennessee,” said Jarvis.
Tony woke up. He pressed his skin to the cool tiled floor. How did he get in here? He groaned. His head was throbbing. The room was currently spinning.
“I’m sure they wouldn’t mind.”
“November is halfway through. Considering another alpha?” said Tony.
The alpha's heart broke further when he caught his mate's pleading gaze. It wasn't Steve. He did not beg. It showed the true brokenness of his mate.
“What are these?” he asked.
“You staying overnight with Stark?” asked Natasha.
“What?”
“I’ll pull up the surveillance,” said Jarvis.
“You shouldn’t have to do that. You shouldn’t even see me like that. No one should! Especially an omega!” yelled Tony.
“He’ll be transferred to our cardiac unit once treated.”
“That isn’t comforting. Those pups were never the same,” said Steve.
“I’m sorry, Piper.”
"No one I'm willing to call," said Steve.
“Yeah.”
“This is the base, Cap,” said Rumlow.
“Of what?” asked Barny.
"I constantly reminded him I was still me. My heat didn't change that. I wasn't an omega that needed his protection. Eventually realized I still the same person," said Steve.
Steve got to his feet. Instinct refused to let him move from behind his alpha. Loki's armor faded in a mist of golden light. He raised his hands in surrender.
"I won't sir."
“I prefer determined."
He went into the bathroom, ignoring the blatant filth and got into the shower. The hot water lasted all of five seconds before turning cold. He shut off the water as soon as he was clean and changed into another set of civilian clothes. His hand brushed the fluffy white unicorn he'd gotten the pup. Would he even be allowed to give it to her? He stuffed it to bottom of his bag, again, not wanting to think about what may be happening to the child in his absence.
"I mean do not want to leave home," said Edith.
“Power down!”
His gaze traveled over his alpha.
“Yes, she may be old, but she’s kept her sources within S.H.I.E.L.D. She’s better than any virus I could place on their system."
"I was the one who cleared things up, but the higherups wanted Rumlow,”
"That could be fun," said Steve.
“I'm done," said Piper. She jumped down from her seat, putting her plate in the dishwasher.
*****
Steve quickly wiped them away. His chest grew damp. Piper licked her lips and whined. He took her to his chest, gasping when she latched. Steve purred.
“I can hear you thinking,” said Steve. His voice was groggy with sleep. "What's on your mind?"
“Why can’t you give me a real answer!” screamed Piper.
“I didn’t-
“Take a seat. I need to run a few tests to calculate exactly when your heat will hit,” she said.
“I should go,” said Steve.
“You want to stay with daddy?”
“Sorry,"
"He doesn't. Why don't you go wake him up?"
"You needed a map to figure that out?" It seemed like an unnecessary waste of effort for someone like Piper.
"Why that song?" asked Steve.
“No.”
“Happy to help,” he said.
“Move.”
“You’ll adapt, Cap."
“It’s alright. It was an accident,” she said dabbing away at the stain.
He made room for Steve in the small hospital bed. Steve lay next to him. They were both too tired and too in need of each other to be angry.
Steve backed away from the other omega, trying to calm down.
“No.”
“Helmut.”
“Excuse me," said Steve. He rushed to the bathroom. Steve put a pad in his underwear.
It was wholly insufficient that he still couldn’t help his own family. The calm of Steve's voice served to irate him further. So much so he did not notice distress leaking off his mate or the frustration in his posture.
“Now Joseph.”
When they got to his bathroom the large tub was filled water and bubble bath. The sides of the tub were lined with bath toys. Steve helped Piper out of wet clothes, setting her in the warm water. She grabbed from the toys from the side of the tub, instantly lost in her own imaginary water world. He gently started washing her.
“I didn’t say that. I’m considering my options,” said Steve.
"Oh."
"How big is it now?” asked Tony.
"What's the space between your contractions?" she asked.
“Dora?”
Steve looked over the alpha. Olive skin, dark brown eyes, and thick dark hair with a few threads of silver. He stood at 5’11. The height difference took nothing away from the man's powerful aura. It was unlike anything he ever felt before. The man was perfectly dressed in a suit that meant to draw attention. Steve looked away, realizing he was staring. His heart was racing.
“Being here doesn’t mean you're crazy, Steve,” said Barny.
“She wanted to ask,” said Tony.
*****
“Just don’t freeze your well-shaped ass off,” said Tony.
“Thanks, you're pretty busy," said Tony.
"Believe me now?" Jarvis asked, pulling up the footage of Captain Rogers from Time Square.
"Compared to some of the things I've organized over the years, this is simple," said Pepper.
He was harder on the pup than usual. She was nearing the point of exhaustion, swaying where she stood, when they finally finished.
"What do you need?" asked Tony.
Tony leaned back into the nest. He couldn’t deny that it was comfortable. The blanket smelled of Steve. He already found himself calming. The twitching need to work faded. He pushed his nose into Steve’s neck. The omega’s purrs lulled him into a peaceful sleep.
"He's in early labor could be in for several more hours," said Edith.
“They gave me nothing! Those are my names.”
Rhodey called.
“My name is Piper Sara Margret Stark. What’s yours?”
Tony nodded. Crane came in. He was a middle-aged beta with thinning blond hair. Crane ran the normal physical exam, testing the range of motion of his shoulder.
"Jarvis the subject to my 12 o'clock is not a target, disengage."
Steve had seen many photos of the bright red car. It was obviously one of Howard’s pieces.
“No playroom for today,” said Steve.
“We have tried, but the gas isn’t working fast enough!” said the doctor.
“10:30ish.”
Tony chuckled. "Yes, but there's more to it before that. I wasn't planning on telling you until you got a bit older. But I think it will be better to tell you now.”
“I’ll have to ask you some uncomfortable questions,” she said.
Steve gazed at the cards before leaving too. He should have tried harder to bring the group together, instead of getting swept up in it all. They had to come together more than ever. He went to the infirmary to check on Clint and Natasha. He went inside. Nat sat loyally by her friend's side.
"Can I ask one more thing of you?" asked Steve.
“What are they in Asgard?” asked Steve.
"It's okay," he hushed, patting her back.
As soon as they knocked on the door, Peggy launched out, hugging them both.
"Bye, Tony."
He was in his daughter's playroom.
That brief moment of eye contact told Tony how much the single sentence hit a nerve. Pressing wasn’t the answer.
“Really?”
“I wish it could be that simple. But she’ll likely ask for footage of his questioning. She’ll see through the act even if it’s by you. Please don’t break the man. He’s a good person.”
The song ended too soon. They were slow to pull away.
“For Carnival a massive annual festival. Millions of people dancing, partying, and drinking in the streets. Countless beautiful omega dressed in-
“Jarvis, cut it with the Christmas music,” he said.
Tony bent down, taking Steve's nipple into his mouth. At the same time, he twisted his fingers in the motion for his omega to come. Steve wailed softly, convulsing around Tony’s fingers. Slick soaked his hand. Tony's fingers pulled away. The omega moved into his lap. His mind went blank as Steve slid into onto his length.
"Tony?"
Whenever or wherever Piper was, she was safe; knowing that was enough to calm him. He was in a cell drenched in warm orange-hued light. After freezing, he was always thrown into a room like this to defrost. He always enjoyed the process, laying under the giant heat lamp for days, as the heavy stiffness faded from his limbs. Without this given time, motor function, reflexes, and thinking were slowed. The newer versions didn’t have to endure the procedure. It was their loss.
"How does earth wedding compare to one of Asgard?” asked Steve.
"I didn't want this! All I'm trying to do is make sure we have sound future," said Tony.
“A better boxer,” said Tony.
“I’m sure you could have done it yourself,” said Steve.
“Someone clearly misses his pup.”
"I can't help it," said Tony.
"I was working on calming down," said Rumlow.
Steve slowly pulled his head up, wiping his mouth.
“Steve.”
Tony’s arms framed his omega. He pressed firmly against Steve, giving him greater control. Tony pushed into his omega without hesitation. They moaned in unison at the sensation. A tight wet heat surrounded him. Tony wrapped one arm firmly around Steve’s waist, keeping in place as he thrust deeply into him. The only motion the omega capable of was rocking his hips against his. Steve clawed at the glass wall. The omega's pleasured moans were all he heard. Tony pulled out of Steve, earning an angered snarl. The anger was soothed as he lowered them to the floor. He cradled Steve's head in his hand. Steve arched off the tiled floor as Tony pushed into him without warning. The omega’s legs wrapped around his waist, keeping him closed, pulling him deeper into his tight wet heat. Tony motions were fully powered by instinct, eliciting great pleasure from Steve.
Any suggestions on what Steve's pet names for Tony would be?
"Okay I'm on it, I'll have security lock it down. If we need to we can have F32s in thirty seconds. Thank you, Colonel."
Piper didn't want to cry again, so she forced them back. She dragged the mattress over the drawing. Hiding them was one less reason for her to cry. She picked up a red crayon and started sketching out a diagram of Theodore’s arm. Piper focused all of her attention on it.
Tony grabbed the bags from the front seat. He doubled Steve's normal order. Steve was in the kitchen, playing a game on his phone. Tony placed them on the counter. He draped his arms over Steve's shoulders and nuzzled against his neck, breathing in that wonderful scent. Steve's purred at the touch.
*****
“I’m not cute,” said Tony.
“Gym," said Steve.
“Captain, you’re up,” said Fury.
Piper pressed into his leg as the cell wall retracted into the floor. Lena dragged a folding chair inside with her. She was in their territory. He shook his head. No, it wasn't his territory. He didn’t
“My final battle with Red Skull,” said Steve.
“Where is this coming from?” said Natasha.
“Sir, Dr. Star is here.”
"Event of the year?" said Steve.
“That’s not how it works anymore. You’ll be able to choose an alpha, and if none are to your liking, you’ll be allowed to go through it alone with the proper tools," said Edith.
“Nothing.”
“Sir, can I please tell you my findings?” said Jarvis.
He couldn't answer that. God, he wanted to, though. But he could try and comfort Tony any way he knew how, so the pursuit of answers didn't seem consuming.
“Heartbreaker.”
“Time to cut the cake.”
The alpha caught Steve’s slight frown. How could Steve not understand how beautiful he is?
“Let me finish my coffee first.”
Piper tensed when she spotted the light on Winter's collar flashed on.
She smiled hearing her name. “Do you ever wonder what your real name is?”
The desperate tone was enough to take Tony over the edge. They moaned as his knot locked them together. Their breathing was heavy. Tony licked over his omega’s scent gland. Every part of him wanting to sink his teeth into Steve's pale beautiful neck, but he couldn’t, not yet. His knot slowly went down. He pulled out of his omega. His seed leaked from Steve. The omega closed his legs. The heat haze cleared his mind. He lay motionless on the floor. Tony’s hand ran gently over his stomach in a circular pattern. The soothing touch soothed the fire under his skin. Steve turned on his side. He ran his fingers through Tony’s hair. The alpha's eyes were fully dilated. He entered feral state. Steve hoped Tony's mind would return soon.  He’d probably have only today before he entered the same frame of mind. Steve slowly sat up. There were small oval-shaped bruises on his hips.
“Steve.”
"By the time the cure was administered the Extremis had already integrated into her DNA. The bonding likely occurred when Extremis was first introduced to Steve's system. While in utero it adapted to best fit her system. Not only was accepted into her DNA, but perfected likely due to it being coupled with the super-soldier serum," said Bruce.
Steve shook away the thought. Where was his home? His old apartment building was destroyed and replaced decades ago.
He smirked. So sensitive even out of heat. He’d enjoy this. Steve fell asleep. He ran his fingers through the omega’s hair. Tony smiled as Steve purred in his sleep.
Tony nodded slightly, acknowledging that Steve's opinion was set. There was no arguing with it. At least, not now. He didn't blame Steve for what happened.
"Who will teach me?" Piper wondered. Lena’s description sounded ominous and not at all like the school she’d always imagined.
"It's refreshing," said Steve.
"Love you too."
“Let him go.”
“Yes.”
“If not, we'll try him in Fury’s new gadget,” said Natasha.
He stretched out as much as he could in the seat.
“Your boyfriend," she said.
"I know you're there."
“THEODORE!!”
“The honor is all mine.”
“You can’t possibly want to do this.”
“And Gary needs, Tony.”
“1200 cc a dose half this size I’m dead,” she said.
“Trying to change my mind?” asked Tony.
"Sure, but why?" Steve wondered.
Steve was abruptly dropped off at the jet. Tony speed off before he could say goodbye. He tried not to let his disappointment show.
"Looks like it's lunchtime."
Piper glared and ran over to him as soon as he sat down. He picked her up again, setting her in the corner, with a growl of his own. It went on like this for four hours. He finally gave up, allowing the child to sit beside him.
Where was the child getting this will power to fight back? To openly challenge him without fear, even when she knew of the consequences. He thought that side of her had been squashed.
"Doesn't mean I can't slow down, enjoy a moment. We can go out to the beach. No one will bother us," said Tony.
Soon he was happily curled against Tony's side, his head resting on the alpha's chest. He purred as callused fingers traveled through his hair. The position allowed him to scent the alpha’s neck. Steve sighed, breathing in deeply the earthy clove scent of the alpha. He couldn’t pick up on another omega. Tony turned, so they were facing. Steve closed his eyes, waiting for their lips to meet. Tony’s breath brushed against his lips.
“I don’t know how you do it,” said Steve.
"Yes, I have doctorates in many fields, including medicine."
Tony followed Rhodes lead as they made their way through the dock.
Steve forced himself to look the alpha in the eyes.
“Just keep me posted,” he said.
He kicked away a Lego.
Once the mess was cleaned up he turned on the tv, keeping it at a low volume for Tony's sake.  Steve put on animal planet. He rarely watched the news. It was all so political now. He enjoyed nature documentaries. Wild Russia was on. It seemed to be a marathon. Six episodes an hour each it should keep him occupied. Before he could enjoy them he had to make a call.
“It’s alright,” said Steve.
Steve picked up the key from the floor and it to his apartment keys. It may not go to anything, but its sentimental value was priceless. Steve frowned. Would S.H.I.E.L.D allow him to leave? They put such stress on keeping him a secret. Living in the middle of Manhattan with Tony Stark was bound to bring attention. But he wanted this. He wanted it so badly. They could go to Malibu. It was secluded enough. He was willing to move away from the only home he'd ever known to have a life with Tony.
The Hobbit - was first published September 21, 1937
“Then what are you?” asked Pepper.
“You’re a great man,” said Steve.
Steve spat in the man's face. Killian slapped him. Steve still glared at him with stubborn determination. Flinching when the alpha's molten hand traveled to his stomach.
Steve relaxed. Edith handed him a bottle of pills before he left.
Steve got into the car with Natasha. Sighing as Tony disappeared from view.
Tony sped ahead of the jet. Steve bit his lip.  Please, let him be careful. He took a seat in. This was his only chance to rest before the battle started.
When he didn’t respond, she made him make room. She climbed over his knees and elbow to settle against his chest.
Tony caught the gesture. “I’ll be right back.”
“Have you done this before?” he asked.
“What’s that purplish mark on your neck?”
Piper whined, hiding her face in his chest. He rubbed her back. "Shh, it’s okay, Piper.”
Most of them were likely false. Or would automatically set off the bomb. The snaps locking the vest to Winter were triggers, so if opened they would instantly cause detonation. She took a breath, staring up at Winter. His expression was indifferent as ever, while her hands were shaking and a hot sweat had broken out across her skin. If he could be so calm in this situation, the least she could do was try.
“Eat.”
“You feel guilty,” he said.
“He’ll love it."
Steve put his head in his hands. "What kind of parent wants to leave their pup? Is this the postpartum depression coming back?"
“No, insult at all. In that era, psychology was rather primitive. It has evolved greatly. There’s no longer that stigma,” said Barny.
“You think he isn’t watching. He has this whole place under surveillance,” said Pepper.
“Who is he?” asked Pepper.
Steve woke up at ten in the morning. Tony was still working. Had he even slept?
“Yes.”
Steve relax against Tony.
“Jeri Hogarth, I have you done what asked?” said Tony.
Tony swallowed Steve’s release.  He trailed a path of kisses up the omega’s tone chest, pressing their lips together, letting the omega taste himself. He spread Steve's legs slightly. Carefully pushing his finger past the tight ring of muscles. He bit his lip. There was so much he wanted to do, but he had to wait, give Steve time to adjust.
“So you do have a possessive side. I knew there was an imperfection in golden boy personality,” said Tony.
Tony smirked but didn't say anything.
“Like a mechanic?”
“Fury wants me to talk to Sir. I have to decide whether I want to do that,” said Steve.
“You’ve reached your destination, Captain Rogers,” said Jarvis.
“A lot can be gained by such interactions,” said Fury. Sir hadn’t reacted to Romanoff. A pissed off super-soldier may have a better chance of making him squirm.
“Jarvis put a pot of coffee on for Tony.”
“Beautiful,” Helmut greeted.
“Sir, Mrs. Potts is here.”
“Thank you.”
“When it settles, give me a call,” she said. She took his hand, writing her number on his palm.
Steve went to the medical wing once he finished his call. He sighed.
“What?”
“You smell.”
“Call Natasha.”
*****
This time Piper caught the slight movement of his hand, dodging the electric rod and went to her knees.
“I’ll do my best,” said Steve.
Winter clutched the examination table. It creaked under his strength. She was more than that. His arm went limp, hanging loosely from him. What did the beta woman have planned?
Steve resisted the urge glare, but she was right Piper wasn’t at her best.
Steve quivered weakly against the alpha, releasing Tony’s wrists. Tony’s fingers tangled his hair pulling deep kiss. Steve grew in his confidence. Their tongues fought for dominance. His hands traveled down the alpha’s sturdy back. He rocked his hips down on the hardness growing beneath him. Steve gasped as those powerful fingers firmly groped his butt. A panting whimper escaped him. Tony pulled at his sweater. Steve raised his arms allowing Tony to pull it off.
A blue light scanned over him.
Steve was tempted to kiss the alpha to see if he could taste it as well. He pushed the thought from his mind. Steve realized he stood between the alpha legs. His arms frame Tony in. Their faces were only centimeters apart. Heat rose in his cheeks. Tony’s breath brushed against his lips.
"I won't."
“Pasta,”
“Okay, thanks, kid.”
“I’m aware and I’m doing all I can to find him. At the moment there’s nothing else I can do,” said Natasha.
“Okay,” She darted off her bedroom.
Steve smiled brightly.
The glass wall of the cell burst as a blue wave of power emanated from her and she screamed. Her vision blurred. Everything went dark.
It's what she would do if placed in that position as a child. “It depends on how much she wants to get out of it. She’s not an easy child Steve and not the stereotypical way. Piper is aware she’s smart and isn’t afraid to use it to her advantage. That was part of who she was before being kidnapped. Now it’s more present.”
He rushed to the bank jumping through a window. Throwing his shield in time to knock a bomb from the chitauri’s hand. He hit the floor, dodging enemy fire. Steve kicked a desk at his feet, shoving them back. The bomb was beeping. He went to the railing.
“Steve, I would get some sleep while you can,” she said.
“Thank you."
Steve dropped off the bridge they were on, landing on the bus below, tumbling to avoiding enemy attack. He swerved through road at top speed. Making his way to blockade of police cars. He landed on the roof of a car. One the cop aimed his gun at him.
“Come in.”
Their hands entwined.
"I won't."
His voice was tired. In the background, Piper was wailing.
“Every month I have to run maintenance and clean the arc reactor. Normally, I do it myself, but I could use an extra set of hands,” said Tony.
“You’re not one. I know monsters,” he said. That’s what he was. He knew how beasts behaved. She was not him, not yet.
“Are you going to tell them that I’m awake?”
“It’s not some machine I’m trying to figure out. This is me.”
“Why don’t we calm down and get a look at your baby?” said Edith.
“She’s beautiful,” said Steve.
He picked her up, placing her on the counter. She took a big bite. "Ah, brain freeze.”
“I need a week.”
“Slow,” he said. He needed to get back in shape. Good, a task he could focus on.
"Maybe next time. I wanna play with my legos."
“I promise that I’ll try.”
“Enjoying it?”
Startle Reflex - when a baby hears a loud noise or when he falls backward, his arms and legs extend away from his body. This reflex is most noticeable during the first month and usually fades by 2 or 3 months.
He shoved Steve away, crashing back into his desk.
“Tell her to call back later!” growled Steve.
“Isn’t this a bit ridiculous? She's just a kid."
Tony disappeared into the portal. Darkness and enemies surrounded him. Steve’s image disappeared. The result of his sacrifice played out in front of him. He faded into unconsciousness.
“We got off on the wrong foot-”
Steve groaned. A deep soreness penetrated him to the core. The slightest movement sprung forth pain. He heard Tony humming an off-tune song.
“Come on, Steve."
“Fine.” Piper hurried back to her room. Steve moved next to Tony, offering him an Advil and a glass of water.
"No, we've figured things out."
"People, friends, and family. They help anchor you guide you back. If it weren't for Papa and Pepper, I'd probably be half-mad."
“Why does Daddy get to sleep in?”
"Open it."
“I told her no.”
There was a knock on the door. Both the pups tensed up.
“That doesn’t matter,” said Tony.
“What amazing invention are you working on now?” asked Steve.
“Why are you doing this?” asked Piper, exasperated. Lena didn’t do anything without a reason, but she couldn’t figure it out.
Lena yawned pouring herself another cup of coffee. Winter had blanked out, staring at the wall. Piper was asleep. She had a few hours until they woke up. From her desk, she pulled up the information from Piper's transport. Odd, there was an abnormal flux in her temperature.
“There’s still room from improvement,” she said.
“The crazy extents I’m willing to go to for my patients. But I was expecting something different,” he said.
“So happy tears?”
Steve purred, hoping it would help relax the alpha. Tony unwound slightly. Telling Tony, it wasn't his fault wouldn't relieve the guilt.
“Debatable," said Steve.
“Is she mine?”
“It’s okay. We'll be doing an ultrasound today," she said.
“I have to get my affairs in order. A trust fund for the kid and edit my will.” A billion-dollar trust fund that the kid could access when it turned twenty-one should be due.
“I told you about my heat months ago you couldn’t plan ahead!” growled Steve.
her, but never called her anything.
“Are there any other rules I should be made aware of?” asked Tony.
“Loki’s scepter.”
The sun stung at his eyes.  He lay in a crater naked.
"Sorry about that. It caught me off guard," said Steve.
Rune swallowed down his panic. He had to warn her.
Steve went to his studio readying a blank. Jarvis's alarm went off at 12:00 am. He cleaned his brushes. Steve went to their room hanging his paint clothes on his side of the closet. He climbed into bed, falling into a restless sleep he woke an hour later. His heart raced, his breath came in heavy gasping pants. A cold sweat drenched his skin. Tony's side of the bed was empty.
"Maybe I can convince you otherwise," said Tony. Lazily running a hand through Steve's hair.
"You've given more than enough reason to."
“What are you doing?” he asked.
“There’s no distraction from this kind of pain. Rhodes, I've been through hell and back. I would go through all of it a thousand times if it meant having her back in my arms even if it were only for a moment. So, there is no distraction,” said Tony.
From the playground, Piper watched a black SUV pulled into the driveway. On the passenger side door was the S.H.I.E.L.D insignia. It was an armored vehicle, probably stocked with all kinds of gadgets. She wanted to open it up and see what made it tick. For all Daddy’s cars, he didn’t have an actual supercar. Rune came up beside her.
Pepper was impressive. An omega CEO that couldn't be an easy world to work in. To fend for herself in such a world, she had to be tough as nails and smart. Why weren't her and Tony together? A rival that was what his inner omega saw her as. When it came down, he was only a soldier. What was he compared to her?
“I don’t know about that. They didn’t fight that much before I was taken.”
“The ones that came last,” said Piper.
"I don't want that." Deep down, Steve was sure whatever Barny was doing was helping somehow. "I enjoy speaking with you."
"What’s your name, doctor?"
“You love it. Talking about ass-"
“Piper Stark,” said Iris pointing to the newspaper tucked under her arm.
“Where is my daughter?!”
Tony went to the nursery when he couldn't find his mate anywhere else. It was one of Steve's favorite places. The room was ready, but the omega always double-checked to make sure everything was in its place. Tony entered the room. It was painted a muted green. They'd decided against pink for the room. Steve was checking over supplies.
“Fine, just a checkup. Perfectly healthy,” he said.
“Umm, I’m not sure. What does it feel like?”
“Is that what you want? Here’s a little holiday greeting I’ve been wanting to send to the Mandarin. I just didn't know how to phrase it until now. My name is Tony Stark, and I'm not afraid of you. I know you're a coward. So I've decided that you just die, pal. I'm going to come and get the body. There's no politics here just good old fashion revenge. No, Pentagon, it's just you and me. In the off chance, you're a man. Here's my home address 10880 Malibu Point. I'll leave the door unlocked. That what you wanted, right?"
“If that’s true, this will be short. Help yourself to a donut,” he said.
"And you as well, Mr. Stark," she said.
Kill them, before they kill you.”
"What?"
“Which was?” he asked.
He settled into the far corner. His back pressed against the wall, eyes focused on the door.
“Can you show me what’s written on that letter?” he asked.
Doris Day – a famous actress and singer born in 1922. She began her big career as a band singer in 1939.
"It's not as bad as it looks," she said with a timid smile.
“Is someone homesick?”
Piper needed to know where Winter was. Her friend was gone without any explanation. She had to know if he was safe.
Steve turned in bed, his arm searching for his alpha. He sat up. The room was empty.
“That’s better.”
It was past her bedtime. Tony carried Piper to her room and she changed into her pajamas.
"I think so."  Steve burst through the four feet of snow that piled on top of them.
“Tony?"
"She doesn't know I'm your patient."
Steve was purring loudly. He rested on his side with Piper huddled close to him. She was playing with Steve’s hand. The omega smiled at him, beaming with pride over the small being tucked securely in his arms. His eyes were fully dilated in a feral omega state. His scent oozed content.
“Having seconds thoughts?”
Daddy told her only to use this in emergencies. She bit her lip. It hurt thinking of them. She whimpered.
“No.”
“Good,” he said.
“Time,” he said.
She tucked a brown strand of hair behind her ear.
“A week after I was released from the facility, I found out I was pregnant. I was terrified and ashamed. I was trapped with no options. There was no one I could tell, not even Bucky, no matter how much I wanted to. I was so weak the strain of pregnancy was too much and I miscarried. There was so much blood. Bucky found me curled up on the floor near death." Steve took a breath, realizing he was shaking. Tony's arm wrapped around him. He braced against the alpha for emotional and physical support. "Days later, I woke up in a hospital with Bucky by my side. He'd been with me the entire time. The reason he'd been allowed to stay was they thought the baby was his. I broke down and told him everything. He was so angry threatened to kill the doctor. But I couldn't let him. I'd already lost so much my mother, my baby. I couldn't lose him too."
"She's lucky to have you and Tony."
Piper frowned. Why was Lena still there? It made her nervous.
They instantly fluttered close.
“Normally, I’d go for that sort of thing, but I’m happily married,” said Tony.
Steve went to the lab, knowing that was where the alpha was likely hiding. Tony was hunched over a suit of armor.
“Him being too overprotective. He wouldn’t let me fend for myself. I can’t blame him for acting that way. At that time I was small and scrawny that didn’t stop me from trying to fight back. How about you?” asked Steve.
“Feel better?” asked Tony, his arms wrapping around the omega.
"How was she?" asked Tony.
"How about personally?" asked Bruce.
Tony took it. Steve made himself comfortable on the couch again.
“Captain, the bank on 42nd passed Madison. They’ve cornered a lot of civilians in there,” said Clint.
"Do you believe I would hurt Steve and his pup?" she said.
“Steve.”
“Piper will have to be coached in what to say. A very select few will know the truth of her story,” said Pepper.
Tony was exhausted this man was hardly a threat. He sat down but kept a wary eye on Trevor.
“What’s on your mind?” asked Barny.
He nodded. Steve settled in the kitchen. He poked at the plate of scrambled eggs in front of him.
“How many are there?” asked Steve.
“I told you I don’t mind."
“Yes, but not that long,” he said.
"Thor, this is Stark. We've found a half Asgardian child. It’s not any child Thor. He shares fifty percent of your DNA. Maria and Pepper have taken him in. But we need to know what to expect here,” he said.
"She doesn't trust
She smiled up at him. “Thank you.”
“Feels right in my hand,” said Steve. He holstered his weapon.
Steve smiled. His heart sped in his chest. He meant that much Tony.
“TONY!”
Steve felt heavy. He couldn't move. His vision blurred. He tensed when once again he heard a creak. He curled his limbs close, protecting his stomach. A metal hand touched his cheek. He struck out with his shield. Sparks flew at the impact.
"I was five and half when Howard took me to see it. He wasn't much for rating. My mom was so angry when I woke up crying in the middle of the night talking about sharks. Howard ended up sleeping on the couch for the rest of the night."
He wanted to be here. This was his home. The last place he saw his alpha. But it wasn't an option.
“Happy New Year,” he said.
“Do you want me to turn on jets? It will help with your muscle cramps,” said Jarvis.

She gently wiped away his tears.
A man dressed in rags approached him. Steve instantly straightened. The elderly man. He instantly recognized the army tattoo on the man's forearm.
“Chop the vegetables,” said Tony.
"Could I just force it open?" said Steve.
“My feet?” said Steve.
“I prefer only one patriotic hero. The stars and stripes look so much better on you."
"Is that alright, Winter?" Piper knew she had little to no choice. If she threw a tantrum, Winter would surely be punished for her misbehavior. But she didn't want to drag him into this he if didn't want to. He had even fewer options than her.
"Sure," said Steve.
“It might help you relax,” suggested Jarvis.
"We aren't doing that," he said.
“It will take time to unload everything. We have to take it all down from camp,” said Fleur.
Piper got out of bed and carefully opened the door. The hall was empty. To avoid the squeaky step in the stairway, she slid down the railing, which was actually pretty fun. She would be doing that again. To get to the basement door, she'd have to walk past the gym. If she went outside and tried using the playground tunnel entrance, Jarvis would alert her parents.
“I got it!” yelled the pup, jolting Winter from his trance.
To prolong the time before his heat he would have to avoid physical contact with Tony.
“Then why did you keep his letter?!” yelled Tony.
Steve turned red.
“No, they want you there. Their entire reason them being there was to inject you with whatever was in that dart. I’ve already reported my findings to Director Fury,” said Natasha.
He put on her back again and she instantly rolled over again, giggling. Steve smiled.
“I’m sorry, Winter.”
“The stress is exhausting, but I still can’t sleep. Give me a few days, and I'll be good," Steve said.
“Can I look at your car now?” asked Piper.
Tony was unphased by sudden mood change. “You’ll be fine."
Steve slid on a pair underwear. The fabric was uncomfortable against his skin. He stopped at the closet, checking in on his sleeping alpha.
“Tony,” he warned. The man snapped from his stance.
“What are you leaning toward?”
Piper twirled a pencil in her hand.
“Yes, sir.”
“Maybe, but I hope I don’t have to make that choice. It’s not like anyone would allow me to.” Which was a relief. She killed people before, but it was blurry, and she had the comfort of knowing it was in self-defense.
“I’m not violent. That’s not me. I was just-
“And if there’s no one?” Pepper asked.
“What’s there to understand? You want to play with your fucking toys more than you wanted to be with me!” screamed Pepper.
She didn’t invade his space any further. Piper sat down waiting for him to come to her. She forced herself to be still. For two hours she remained perfectly still waiting for him to come to her. He got up offering her his arm.
“You disturbed his process. I’ve seen Winter’s kills. He’s perfect, methodical and efficient. He prefers one clean headshot. This was-
The omega lunged, clearing the distance between them. Tony was knocked to the floor with Steve straddling him. His clothes were torn away. Moaning when Steve's hand traveled between his legs. And there was that rarely seen perfect smirk.
“Come now, Piper.”
“I’m sorry, Piper. I can’t.”
Steve snarled, managing to toss off one of them men pinning him. They should have never trusted her. He should have left her to fend for herself in the explosion.
*****
Tony took a large swig of the drink. The hot sugary drink was a shock to his system. "I'm surprised you remembered how I take my coffee."
“What?”
"Like it?" said Tony.
“Shit, Steve you deserve better than this. Can’t you see how fucked up I am?” asked Tony.
