,” Steve says. The furrow between his brows deepens. “Exhausting yourself isn’t good for your health, and we need you healthy and rested for what’s ahead of us.”
Steve smiles and introduces himself—Airman Bill Levee, apparently, is just as talkative up close. For all that his hand is made of metal, his grip feels remarkably, tangibly
laughing when Tony picks up the phone at the end of the movie and calls Matt Damon and tells him to text him next time, "I'll come pick you up, just stop getting lost in fucking space, asshole!")
“That I do,” Tony says, easy as anything, as breathing, trusts Steve to keep him balanced and leans forward.
It’s a few more minutes of Steve blowing Tony’s mind with kitten licks to his soft palate and firm, intermittent thrusts of his hips before Tony has to pull away with a gasp of “God,
Steve tears his eyes away from Tony (who should really work the sweaty-and-disheveled-mechanic look more often) to take in the others in the room with him. It’s a panorama of people, and the first thing Steve notices, besides their more obvious differences, is how comfortable they all are with each other, to the point that walking in on this moment feels invasive, almost
Steve could cry. If he really wanted to, he could. He kind of wants to. The pose is damning enough, but he’d be an idiot if he didn’t admit, at least to himself, that it’s
to lose the plot. Tony’s mind moves faster than Steve could ever hope to match, mentally or physically; he’s always one pace behind, catching up. It’s fine, though; he actually kind of
Steve is everywhere at once, holding him and pinning him and kissing him until Tony doesn’t know which end is up or who is who. He moans brokenly into Steve’s hot, greedy mouth as he comes, shuddering, in his pants, warm wetness soothing the aching length of his cock. Later he’ll have the good sense to feel some degree of shame, but in the moment there’s nothing for Tony to think about past the heat of Steve all up and down his front and between his legs and against his ass. He feels charged, tingling head to toe like a cable throwing off sparks; it’s impossible to even open his eyes long enough to watch Steve come, too, but he feels the damp spread against the front of his ruined jeans and the soft, choked-off noise Steve presses against his mouth like a prayer.
Steve frowns. “Something tells me it’s not,” he says, leaning down to brush a kiss against Tony’s burning cheek, “but we’ll table that discussion for later.”
Tony tries to lift his head. Fails. Drops it back down to rest against Steve’s massive bicep. That’s fine. That’s better than being able to lift his own head, by a mile. “
Steve blinks. Even struck speechless and dumbfounded, Steve is the most gorgeous thing Tony’s ever seen.
Steve wears the blue shirt. He also goes to the effort of ironing his black slacks and polishing his dress shoes, because he knows Carbone’s reputation as the kind of place one goes to make an impression and/or be impressed. Tony talks about it all the time. “
“Now do you believe me?” Steve asks in a husky rumble once he’s caught his breath. Tony only has a moment to appreciate the fact that he managed to knock the wind out of Steve Rogers before he whips his head back to glare at the man’s smug face.
. and eventually—quickly, even—you learn. you learn to tell him in every which way you can think of, without words, how much you love him, and why. you text him pictures from your runs through Central Park (he makes the photo you sent him that spring, of the adolescent raccoon emerging from a hollowed-out tree, his lock screen for a week before he changes it back to a picture of you in bed drooling onto your pillow). you help him take off the armor when he's dead on his feet. you feed him. you train with him. you listen to him ramble on about bad movie science and cheer when Matt Damon mentions him in that Mars movie. (You literally

Just like he did in California, Tony doesn’t think about the bottomless pit of empty taking up valuable real estate in his stomach as he wanders from the bathroom and starts arranging himself into a vaguely Tony Stark-shaped person.
Tony’s eyes fly open but are heavily guarded when he looks back at Steve from across the table. No take-backs, Steve tells himself.
“That’s right, baby. And I’m gonna give it to you,” Steve promises, looking at him with those big, pupil-black eyes when he says it, and then he pulls back just enough to thrust forward and drive the point home.
In another scenario, Steve skips the question entirely because he already knows, the perceptive bastard, he
“Steve…” Despair clutches at Steve’s heart at that tone. If he knows Tony at all—and he does, really—that tone all but screams
Steve remembers telling Tony he’d try the spicy rigatone alla vodka if he ever came here. Reservations to Carbone are hard to come by, and he should seize the opportunity while he can, even if it’s bittersweet. “Thanks. That’s okay. I think I’ll just—”
A depraved little voice in Steve’s head wonders if Tony’s going to bind his wrists with that blood red tie.
He read it cover-to-cover twice before he went looking for Tony in the workshop to thank him with a hug. One of the few they’d ever shared, and all the more precious for it.
as Tony silently busies himself with heating up the lasagna in the microwave. But Steve isn’t looking at them. He’s too busy looking at Tony, distractedly touching the spot where he can still feel the lingering warmth of his kiss.
Funny how after six weeks away with no contact of any kind, all that R&R and R&D and B&Js and G&Ts, one look at Steve is enough to put Tony right back where he started, heartsore and winded like the hurt is forcing the air from his lungs.
Tony waggles his eyebrows at him and says, “Promise, Cap?” with a gleam in his eye that Steve resolutely does not read into.
Steve laughs softly. “Not better—and I definitely don’t look as good in stilettos.” Steve files away Tony’s visible gulp for later. “But do I think I might be better
“Maybe you’re right,” Steve replies. Bracing his hands on his knees, he says: “So if you’re not doing something because you think Captain America wouldn’t like it, what about run-of-the-mill Steve Rogers?”
It’s enough to crush something in Tony that feels remarkably like one last ember of hope, the bitterly selfish hope that Steve was as wrecked by the breakup as Tony.
“absolutely lovely, but this all coming a bit out of left field. Care to share with the class what it is you’re scheming?”
, and Steve reminds himself it’s not a big deal when Tony beckons him over with a waggle of his fingers and holds him by the elbow once they’re standing side by side, or when Tony reaches up on his tiptoes to plant a big kiss on Steve’s cheek, setting off a flurry of pops and flashes.
you have planned?” he asks carefully, and Tony knows before he opens his mouth that the truth will out, because Steve has that effect on him. He always has, goddamn him. But for once, Tony is almost relieved, because if there’s anyone in the world who will appreciate what it means for Tony to say this, it’s Steve Rogers.
That’s a lie. He wasted it. He knows that now, better than he’s known anything in his entire life, and that includes JARVIS’s coding and what it felt like when Obie forcibly removed the arc reactor from his chest. He spent six incredible, heartwarming, spine-melting, almost-picture-perfect months in a relationship with Steve Rogers, a man he’d been in love with for years before that, and no one knew about it.
, yes, fuck yes, Tony, squeeze me just like that, baby, just like that, gonna fill you all the way up, full to bursting, make you
But now Steve is moving in the opposite direction Tony wants him to, taking all of the warmth and glow of the moment with him.
“It’s good,” Steve blurts out, too loud and too fast. Tony inhales sharply, fingers clenching around the screwdriver hard enough his knuckles go white. Steve feels his face go hot and groans. “I mean, what you did—what you’re doing—is good, Tony. It’s really generous of you to do that for those guys.”
Tony, meanwhile, comes to a complete standstill for all of a second, glancing sidelong in Steve’s general direction, before launching himself across the room to retrieve a bottle of green smoothie from a cleverly concealed mini-fridge. He doesn’t bring Steve one, because he knows Steve doesn’t like them.
Tony tightens his arms around Steve’s waist, and when Steve pulls away to speak, he doesn’t go far, seemingly content to stand there in Tony’s embrace in the middle of the dimly lit workshop.
you fight about it first. it starts out in earnest, a forthright—if frighteningly vulnerable—conversation over dinner that turns into a shouting match to rival anything from the war that of course gets cut short by the Avengers alarm going off and having to Assemble before you can clear the air. he almost dies in the battle, short-circuited by an exceptionally advanced EMP that takes out the RT (and whoo, boy does that make you spiral, thinking back, to the moment
Duncan, to his credit, says nothing as he fills Tony’s water glass. But Steve doesn’t miss the warning look the waiter shoots him as Tony tips his head back for a drink, or the way Tony’s face goes slightly pale as he sets the glass back down on the table, chastised.
, balls deep, dripping with come and lube and holding oh so perfectly still while he waits for Tony to acclimate.
“Trust me, Cap, it’s really not.” Sitting up with a grunt from his supine position on the living room sofa, Tony pops his neck once and drops his shoulders, tired—seemingly—at last. “More to the point, it won’t happen again.”
thing and just having Steve in his arms like this again, it’s hard to complain about the sting for long.
It’s a short walk from the kitchen to the nearest empty room, which just so happens to be a half-bathroom down the hall, because apparently they can’t have normal conversations like normal adults in normal places. They’re fucking
There’s a name for the feeling that fills him at the thought of not being engaged, fake or otherwise, to Tony Stark after today.
, dry and unbearably intense, full of Steve’s cock, his come, his name the only word left in Tony’s head.
“Can’t help it if it’s true,” Steve replies, leaning forward with both eyes rapt on Tony’s face before he hesitates with a wince. “Ah—hold that thought.”
. Such a good little cockslut, Tony. Let me hear you. I want to hear it all. Give it to me.” Steve is fucking
“I’d ask how it went,” Steve says softly from the doorway, resting his shoulder against the jamb, “but I know that groan.”
Of course he remembers this moment. He remembers it perfectly, because it was the first time Howard really hurt him. Not with his hands, although the bruises did linger longer than usual, after.
been a long time since he’s gone on a date, even if he does hate the practice pretty much on the whole. One more for the sake of a stranger’s feelings won’t kill him.
that makes Tony shudder and bite his lip. Steve kisses him again for it. Tony rolls when Steve pushes him over, onto his belly; with a moan, Tony drags his own burning cock against the wet spot under him, reveling in the cool, slick touch even as Steve runs his hands up and down Tony’s back, gentling him again before the next round.
“Are you still thinking about that drink?” Steve asks, moving a hand up to cradle Tony’s face. His palm is so huge, it covers most of Tony’s jaw and cheek too. When his thumb comes up to brush against Tony’s bottom lip, kiss-bruised and tingling, Tony sighs. The temptation to take that thumb into his mouth and suck is so strong, but he knows Steve won’t let the question go that easily.
“Are you okay?” Steve asks, so earnest, so sweet, kissing Tony on the cheek before he leans up and away from him to take in the sight of Tony spread open on his dick. “Oh,
Tony looks up and sees Steve standing where the projector once was, cradling his bleeding hand. The man looks stricken, pale and horrified, worse than if he’d seen a ghost; behind him, the team has inched closer, all of them wearing varying expressions of distress and pity and guilt and sadness, and suddenly Tony can’t bolt out of his chair fast enough. He can’t get away fast enough. He follows his feet out of the room into the corridor and down, down, down to the workshop where it’s safe, where
—he can feel the lack of movement through his hands resting on that broad chest. When Steve remains silent after a few moments, Tony knows he’s waiting for the other shoe to drop. The man is so goddamn smart, and it drives Tony up the fucking
“I did? When?” Tony wheezes. He occupies himself and his mouth with ice chips and doesn’t look Steve in the eye when he answers:
“I—I’m, I’m trying, big guy,” Tony laughs, more breath than sound, eyes watering as he tightens up around the head of Steve’s cock inside him as a result. “It’s a tall order.”
, so slow and deep and steady you honestly lose track of how many times you come. you clean him up after and tuck him in. you kiss him on the forehead before you go on your morning run, every morning without fail (except for those when you're apart, and you still, even after almost two years, catch yourself mid-motion sometimes, about to kiss empty air—you text Tony about it and he laughs every time).
He is trying to muster the same courage that had brought him into Steve’s arms that night, but in the broad, bright light of day, taking those steps into the living room where Steve is sitting on the sofa, blissfully unaware of Tony’s presence, feels like an insurmountable challenge. Doubly so given that Steve is probably well aware of his standing there and isn’t doing anything about it. Tony tells himself that doesn’t smart, but his ability to lie to himself seems to be flaking.
The words come out in a rush. “Hammer decided to crash the party tonight—” Steve’s breath hitches in his throat, fingers flexing around Tony’s wrist “—and managed to corner me for a minute. Started talking about ‘taking another shot’ at reactor tech and I kind of—well.” Tony scrunches his face up and places his free hand over the bright blue circle shining out from the middle of his chest. He shrugs. “You know the drill. Guy gets under my skin even worse than you do.”
Tony moans, arching up against the hard, hot plane of Steve’s body, pushing down on Steve’s magic fingers. “Everything,” he whines, white-knuckling the sheets and biting his tongue to stop anything more incriminating from spilling out. But Steve doesn’t seem to mind it—if anything, his answering groan says he
“Room for one more?” he asks, even as he’s maneuvering his bulk into the mirrored box. Tony, feeling clammy all of a sudden, hasn’t even had a chance to hit the button for the workshop floor.
“You’re not who I was expecting,” they say, lackadaisical like they’re not surrounded by dead aliens that just fell out of the sky. Bruce and Stephen had told him the Ancient One was a bit, well,
“You can take all the credit,” Tony says. He tells himself it doesn’t come out as bitter and envious as he feels, knowing that Sam has what Tony was fool enough to let go of, but now’s not the time for any of that. He jets off to look for Steve, Sam in hot pursuit; the basement is a labyrinth the further in they go. Old brownstones and their ridiculous planning are the bane of Tony’s existence, both as a landlord and as a superhero currently trying to find his ex-boyfriend in the maze of bricks.
. He swallows Tony’s moan with a scorching kiss that leaves Tony dizzy. He hears Steve turn the doorknob and realizes with a jolt that Steve is, in fact, taking him to
It’s not a big deal when Sam, Natasha, and Clint corner him in the kitchen on Sunday night as he’s fixing a plate to bring down to Tony in the workshop.
“Sorry,” he says with a chuckle in an attempt to diffuse tension, “but that stuff is ridiculously good.” Steve’s really glad he didn’t wear the tie now, given how hot under the collar he feels all of a sudden. Tony’s looked at him a lot of ways, but never like that—like the only thing stopping him from launching himself across the table at Steve is the table, itself. “I can see why you’re always raving about it.”
The last test is the hardest. Steve goes down to the lobby via the elevator, carrying the scepter in one hand and the suitcase containing the space stone in the other. He’s dressed in his 2012 uniform again, and he didn’t miss the way it rides up his ass, but he’s got more important things to think about.
you call him every foul, dirty name in the book when you fuck him loudly against the wall and sob yourself hoarse when he makes love to you for what feels like
,” he says, a borderline purr that floods Steve with a kind of desperate want that makes the world tilt on its axis a little bit. That Tony is looking up at him through his absurdly long, thick eyelashes isn’t helping. But then that look disappears like it was never there, and Tony goes back to shrinking in and away from Steve. If Tony had sunglasses nearby, he’d have put them on by now.
So he let him go. And now Steve’s with Sam, who’s seized the opportunity to show Steve off to the world, and who can blame him? If Tony had been stronger, more self-assured, more defiant of the assumptions placed on him by the world around him—
Someone is calling his name, but Tony disappears down the stairs before he can figure out who. He bursts through doors he can’t see and staggers over to the closest workbench, sucking in deep, ragged breaths like he can’t catch up to them. Is that a screw loose in his chest cavity, he wonders, gasping, because that rattling sound seems to indicate something has come undone that shouldn’t have. Howard’s dead, Tony reminds himself, over and over again. It’s a fact as true as any algorithm, so why won’t it take?
He forgets, sometimes—not often, but every now and then—that Steve Rogers is Captain America even without the stars and stripes. All that strength, all that focus, all that goodness, all that genuine earnestness, all that intelligence; it’s all Steve. The rest is just branding.
“Such a gentleman,” Steve says, easy and almost giddy, and Tony smiles because he loves that. He loves making Steve happy. He wants to make Steve happy every day of his life.
Steve leans forward. “Reassure you of what, Tony?” he asks, like it’s important that Tony says the words outright.
“…watching you walk around in those sweatpants like it was nothing, or seeing you dart out of any room I walked into while wearing one of your fancy suits—
Tony looks up from his work and waves his free hand, the one that isn’t wrist-deep in what looks remarkably like a prosthetic arm. He makes a ‘cut it off’ motion to his neck before taking the pliers out of his mouth while FRIDAY lowers the rock music to a dull background hum.
. But that’s okay, because Steve can move him, just like he is now, never pausing in his thrusts as he turns them sideways in tandem to lie back-to-front across the bed, spooning Tony into the gargantuan curve of his body with one arm down around Tony’s belly and the other high across his chest, right above the reactor. Like this, Tony can feel
doesn’t sting a little bit, even as it drives home his rationale for avoiding the entire practice in the first place. At least he’ll have ammunition against Natasha the next time she tries her hand at matchmaking.
Wordless, Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s middle. He knows he’s staring at Tony’s lips like a man dying of thirst stares at a lake, but he can’t find it in himself to care, not when Tony’s looking back at him just as desperately, and especially not when Tony’s closing his eyes and slotting those lips against Steve’s.
They’ve not seen each other for weeks at a time—months, in some cases. But now that this switch has apparently been flipped, time feels precious. The ache that had burrowed under his skin has gone, pushed out by Steve’s touch; Tony wraps an arm around Steve’s neck and the other around his broad shoulders and holds him for the sake of holding him, nuzzling the fine hairs near his nape until Steve shudders.
, and that’s fine, Tony hates himself plenty enough for both of them, but neither does Steve wrap Tony in a hug like Tony wishes he would. Instead, Steve just laughs quietly, the sound puffing out of his nose in a short burst, lips turning up at the corners. He looks ten years younger.
At first he brushed it off as a coincidence. Then it became easier to point to real reasons—their working relationship wasn’t exactly
Tony lifts Steve’s hand and kisses his knuckles. He has so much making up to do, but now’s as good a time to start as any.
you sound so good. Going to make that my ringtone for you,” he growls, hips never losing their rhythm as he fucks into Tony with those long, deep,
“You really don’t have to keep doing this,” Tony mutters, closing his eyes. “It’s late.” He hears the soft brush of Steve’s sweats and bare feet on warmed tile. When Steve speaks again, he’s only an arm’s length away.
Tony’s lashes flutter as his eyes skirt nervously from Steve’s to Steve’s shoulders and then to a random wall. “Don’t tease me, Steve. I have a heart condition.” It’s a joke. It’s anything but.
Tony collapses a second later, clutching his elbows in lieu of the sheets, shuddering as the last of his orgasm, the best and biggest of his life, rolls through him, making a high, broken sound as Steve follows him off that terrifying precipice with a low, soft sound, pressing inside deep, so deep Tony will never forget the feeling, and
The ballroom quickly devolves into a noisy buzz of stunned excitement. There’s no press here per Tony’s “request” (i.e. Pepper’s contractual demands), but that doesn’t stop the guests from frantically reaching into pockets and purses to retrieve their phones and take pictures.
, so much, holy shit, filling Tony up just like he promised he would. It’s hot and slick and so much, breathtaking, and Tony wants it all, grinding his ass back against Steve’s hips to keep him there, inside, until it’s all out. Steve slides a hand under Tony’s stomach and holds him even closer, if that’s possible, pressing them both down into the mattress as Steve’s orgasm pummels him, makes him shoot all over Tony’s stretched and gaping insides until Tony can feel it sliding around inside of him. And all the while Steve holds him, kisses whatever skin that’s closest to his lips, tells him how good he is, how hot he is inside, how sweet he is to let Steve fill him up like this, calling him things like
chuckle. He also missed that gentle brush of fingers against his forehead, right under his hairline, the way Steve knew exactly how to gentle Tony with his touch and voice and presence.
A sound of disappointment moves through the room in a wave, but Steve is already following Tony off stage and into the greenroom, too caught up in the little overgrown curls at the nape of his neck to care about the questions being shouted after them or the sound of tweets being fired off into the ether.
At the question, Tony pauses with hand on his tie, looking out from the shadows at the milling crowd. The string music is posh and lively; everyone is dressed to the nines and they all hate each other. Everything glitters and everything shines, concealing the horrific amount of bullshit roiling just below the surface.
,” he groans mid-sentence, eyes rolling up into his head. Chewing slowly, Steve claps a hand over his mouth to muffle the lewd moan that threatens to escape him as bold, decadent flavors burst on his tongue. Tony was right—this stuff is
Strangers want Tony Stark, the celebrity; Steve wants Tony as a friend and teammate. That’s all. So Tony steals his nice, platonic hug as he trembles and breathes his way out of a panic attack, being careful to avoid nuzzling the soft notch at the base of Steve’s throat the way he wants to. Badly.
“You’re so noisy in bed,” Steve says, but because Tony can’t see his face, he doesn’t see the way Steve smiles when he says it. Something small and hurt curls up in Tony’s chest; he buries his face in the sheets and mutters an apology. Steve’s answer comes in the form of a hand to Tony’s untouched cock, warm and firm, barely moving once it wraps around him. Tony shudders and whimpers, trying desperately to smother his noises so he doesn’t annoy Steve with them, but Steve once again is in his ear, rumbling deeply, “Don’t hide from me, Tony. Never from me. I earned those noises—I want to hear them.”
“I said, I can ask Pepper to put together a press conference for us right now if you’d rather get it over with?”
“Oh, here’s someone else I remember,” Bucky laughs. Tony turns away from Steve, grateful for the excuse, and starts to release the breath he hadn’t realized he was holding.
Tony’s mouth falls open on a trembling gasp when Steve jerks him, an opportunity Steve seizes with relish in the form of a deep, deep, shuddering kiss, because Steve is tall enough and seems to like kissing as a general rule. Tony kisses back, not frantic but not restrained, either, grabbing the back of Steve’s head and moaning as he uses this new leverage to work himself down onto Steve’s cock, slow and steady.
Tony pauses, his big, brown eyes widening slightly in surprise. “Kind of? It is a very nice suit,” he says, and Steve has to force himself not to follow the hand Tony runs absentmindedly down the front of his expensive jacket with his eyes.
Tony looks at the floor, away from Steve. Steve feels it like a physical thing, Tony pulling away, retreating, wanting to hide. Amazing, how a man who almost literally wears his heart on his sleeve
Biting his bottom lip, Steve runs a hand down the front of Tony’s tie, obviously enjoying being able to touch him like this, to see his gift displayed above the arc reactor like a visible claim. Already Tony is imagining all the ways he can get Steve to look like that in public as often as humanly (or superhumanly) possible. He will wear every dorky tie Steve buys him, if that’s what it takes; he will sport hickies and tattoo the shield on his forehead. He’ll put on a charm bracelet, carry photos in his wallet, put a ring on it—anything,
“I thought…I was worried…” Steve’s eyes are downcast, his expression unbearably fragile. Steve ‘I Make Up Inspirational Speeches on the Fly’ Rogers, speechless because of a hurt Tony inflicted, is more than Tony can handle. He kisses Steve, this time. It’s the least he can do.
Tony is too stunned by this development to reciprocate past raising his arms to hover around Steve’s shoulders like useless parentheses.
saintly fantasies involving that throat. He chalks the feeling of Tony leaning into his touch as exhaustion and keeps moving.
No scenario could have prepared Tony for the way Steve is holding and kissing him like he’s just come in from wandering the desert and Tony is a reservoir of cold, clear water. Steve pulls at him until there’s no air between their bodies, plundering Tony’s mouth with precision, opening him up with tongue and lips and teeth, licking and sucking and biting and
Steve looks at him then, and Tony is thrust back to that night in the kitchen, the moment when Steve looked Tony in the eye and just…
This isn’t a scenario Tony’s ever imagined, not once. Of the many thousands of fantasies he’s cried himself to sleep or jerked off or woken up or daydreamed in a team meeting to, this one is wholly new, and it might even be
When Steve wakes up Monday morning, the press conference is scheduled, his suit is pressed and ready for prime time, and Tony is nowhere to be found.
, but when the corners of Tony’s lips turn up in a smile at his own private joke, Steve’s do too. Probably knows exactly what Tony is laughing about, the clever bastard. Steve breaks the flow for a moment to grin at Tony and comb his fingers through his hair. He’s panting hard and heavy like a thoroughbred at the end of a race, but the look in his eyes tells Tony they’ve barely rounded the first turn and
There’s still a commotion happening in the lobby, the fallout of Tony’s self-inflicted heart attack diversion, but Steve manages to force himself away from where he knows Tony is to walk right up to Alexander Pierce. He would dearly love to drop the man right here and now in this lobby, audience be damned, but he has a part to play, yet.
Tony seems to notice their position at that exact moment. Steve feels him blaze with heat where his hands are touching Tony’s bare skin.
“Tony.” Oh, no. He knows that ‘Tony,’ and it’s everything he can do to not shut his eyes as he braces himself for what comes next: “Could you—turn around?”
, and then Steve presses against that devilish spot inside him again and Tony is crying out against the meat of Steve’s shoulder, “Fuck, Steve,
“Nice move, Cap—Sharon teach you that one?” he says breathlessly, laughing. He doesn’t expect the smart, sharp smack to the ass he gets in response, but
Something hits the projector hard enough to not only knock it off the table it was sitting on, but send both hurtling across the room. They smash to pieces against the far wall with a noisy clatter that almost stops Tony’s heart in his chest.
In the moment, the only thing Tony knows is Steve, and Steve’s kiss. It’s soft at first, warm and dry and chaste, their lips only slightly parted, but the hand on Tony’s jaw is firm, molding around its shape and holding him in place while Steve works.
Honestly, the intrusive thoughts he could deal with, but the fact that Tony looks this good after hours of hard labor really isn’t fair.
and mouths ‘Umbridge.’ Del must have ears like a bat, because she smacks him smartly with her prosthetic arm and Tony yelps before devolving into outright laughter. Steve could watch and listen to Tony laugh—that big, gut-wrenching cackle Tony thinks is unattractive but Steve thinks makes Tony look like happiness personified—all day.
It’s the longest three point six eight four seconds of Tony’s life, from the moment he stops talking to the moment Steve releases the breath he’s been holding since he started. Then, like a man trying to gentle a scared animal out of hiding, Steve lifts his hand, telegraphing the course it’s going to take with the slowest flickers of his fingers. Tony stands stock-still and waits, air trapped in his throat, for that hand to find its place under his jaw.
After spending a couple of minutes in each other's arms coming down from the high, Steve presses a trembling thumb against Tony’s chin, scratching the pad against his beard with tiny back-and-forth motions. He whispers Tony’s name softly, intimately, like it’s a promise he is determined to keep.
“Come with me?” he whispers, turning that hand over so his palm is facing the ceiling. His eyes are pleading, happy, nervous, like he’s
“I see what you did there.” They’re helpless, both of them: as Steve oscillates wildly between seducer and nervous wreck, Tony looks like he can’t quite decide if he wants to put on the Stark Charm™ to soothe his own nerves or if he wants to stay like this, in this quiet, vulnerable place with Steve and follow it, wherever it may lead. “Were you jealous of the others?”
Steve bites his lip. “Uh, yeah. Figured you’d be hungry since you spent all afternoon in the workshop.”
Adjusting the loosened knot of Steve’s tie with confident, nimble fingers, Tony continues: “After I’m done, we’re gonna get in my car and drive home, and then I’m going to strip you down, suck you off, and ride you through the mattress.”
“No, it’s okay,” Steve tells him, watching Tony’s shoulders relax with a noticeable drop of a few inches as he says it. He wants to run his hands over them and draw him into a hug, wrap himself around Tony and never leave. He crosses his arms in front of his chest instead. “Like you said, no big deal. We’ll take care of it tomorrow.”
home, as he fell asleep night after night in the suite Tony built exclusively for him, including a bedroom that was never, ever cold.
“I’m fine,” he says. He looks at Steve when he says it and everything. Wills him to believe it so Tony can get away from the softening look in Steve’s eyes and
“‘Rabble-rousers’?” Steve quirks an eyebrow at him as he sits back down. Tony folds his arms over his chest and shushes him.
Tony’s throat clicks wordlessly. Sensing his distress, Steve brushes Tony’s mouth gently with his thumb and bumps their noses together with a playful nudge, offering up a small, private smile that’s all Tony’s.
He’s had years of practice keeping his feelings for Steve from the man. He can handle an elbow and a wink. That shit’s practically child’s play.
This doesn’t happen much, anymore—Tony coming home late from an event he didn’t want to go to in the first place—but it does still happen, often enough that he and Steve have made something of a routine of it. Nothing elaborate: Steve welcomes him home dressed for bed in sweatpants and a mercifully loose T-shirt, leaning in the doorway or standing on the other side of the kitchen island from Tony, and Tony, still dressed head to toe in Ford or Gabbana or McQueen, tells him stories from the night over (Clint’s) leftovers.
Without another word and with all the grace of a major league pitcher, Tony pivots and launches Steve bodily at Sam, who catches him in his arms in a full bear hug before hauling him around the corner behind the brick wall. By the time Tony turns around, Piledriver’s hand has gone slack.
“Better?” Steve murmurs. Tony nods against his chest. He doesn’t let go. Neither does Steve, who seems to fold himself over Tony until they’re more like one person than two, standing there breathing together in Tony’s darkened workshop.
The Ancient One steps forward. “I’m sure you are,” they say. It feels dangerous, standing out here on the front steps like this, but if the Ancient One doesn’t flinch at being exposed, then neither will Steve. They hold out their hand with a beatific smile.
, Steve!” Tony all but shouts. Because Steve is too smart not to know this. How can he not? It’s always been Tony’s need, to disappear into something, anything big enough to take all of him until Tony Stark no longer exists. Iron Man. Stark Industries. Sex. The Avengers.
Tony surrenders to the hug. Wraps his arms around Steve’s neck and hangs there, letting the tears fall as they may. He knows Steve can smell the salt, can probably feel the skipping rhythm of Tony’s heart against his own chest, but hopefully Steve will chalk it up to Tony’s exhaustion running its course and not the fact that Tony is so happy here in Steve’s arms he never wants to leave.
, moaning past Steve’s ear when he drops his head next to Tony’s and holds him down against the mattress with his entire body, pinning him in place with each thrust. Tony hugs him close and loses himself in it, the wet, rhythmic slap of Steve’s balls against his ass, the scorching puff of Steve’s breath against his ear, the burning sensation of Steve’s eyes on him from his place by Tony’s head. When Steve cards his fingers through Tony’s hair and pulls, Tony wails, and he
This one’s come to him like a gift of flowers, beautifully arranged and packaged, leaving no way for him to bow out of it without coming across like an asshole.
The past is past, except when it’s not. Rogers is unstuck, but Steve isn’t. Not anymore. He hasn’t been for a long, long time.
“Pepper’s going to kill me when I get back,” Tony sighs, looking at his watch. The words sound as if they’re coming from far away, like Tony is still in that pocket dimension, somewhere else. Somewhere not here, with Steve, who wants him. Here. With him.
Before long, the frantic kissing ebbs into something more like their first: Steve lowers Tony to stand and cradles his jaw in his hands, nudging their noses together before brushing one gentle kiss against Tony’s lips after another. Slick and wet and hurried gives way to softer, slower, warmer; both of them are panting but neither he nor Steve seem to be able to stop kissing long enough to let air through. It’s too early to say things like
Steve keeps holding Tony. He should let go, but opportunities like this so rarely present themselves. Plus, Tony feels
Shifting in place, Tony notes that the pressure of Steve’s hug is forcing the outer ring of the arc reactor casing into Steve’s sternum. Just like the edge of the marble countertop, Steve probably doesn’t even register that it’s there, leaving a deep imprint in his skin that would bruise if it weren’t for his healing factor; whereas Tony is used to the constant, digging pain, the ache of it holding his chest apart. His heart is constantly exposed, yes, but that’s no reason to hurt Steve with it, even in theory. And that, he knows, is exactly what will happen if he lets this continue.
“Well. Mission accomplished, Rogers,” Tony says over his shoulder, telling himself his eyes are stinging from the buildup of oil on his eyelids, not from tears. He’s just so fucking
it felt to see death in a place it didn’t belong. It would be unbearable to even imagine that moment for more than a second if Steve didn’t have an extra vial of Pym particles tucked away in his belt.
Steve’s toes are nicely filed, he notes; not too long, not too short—perfect, just like the rest of him.
JARVIS’s voice moves gently through the noise in Tony’s brain: “Sir, Captain Rogers is asking permission to enter.”
“Sit down,” Tony says, the question mark unvoiced. Steve is immediately struck, as he pulls Tony forward while Tony pushes him backward, by the sudden shift in Tony’s demeanor: a frisson of nervous energy clings to him still, but his shoulders are straighter, his hands down at Steve’s hips, pushing him gently but firmly back toward the bench at the foot of Tony’s bed. The look in the man’s eyes is downright molten, hot and liquid and burning, and it makes Steve stumble as he sits, snared by that look like a helpless animal before an inexorable lava flow.
“Hm.” Steve huffs, but he doesn’t look at all put out. If anything he looks—happy, if Tony had to put a word to it. Happy, and not a little bit satisfied, like he’s
Around him, heroes kneel, silent. No one talks about what has to be done, what the world will be like without Tony Stark, how they’re supposed to go on—for the moment, everything is still, and just as the blue light of the arc reactor had flickered out moments ago (
horny. “Did Jessica hit you with pheromones or something? Do I need to get Strange down here to run a blood panel on you?”
A headcount. Steve “Mother Hen” Rogers making sure all his chicks are present and accounted for, and Tony is just one more bird in the nest. Not special, not even a little bit. Not to Steve. And he wants—god, how badly he
“Not me.” He tries not to sound so pitiful, but saying it out loud just brings home how much it’s started to wear on him, being the exception to this, the most tender expression of Tony’s affection, platonically or otherwise.
“Steve, it’s okay, I’m just—it’s been a long day, it’s late, I don’t know what this is about, ignore me.”
“Well, since they know you and I are so stubborn we’d both rather show up for a pre-arranged blind date at one of the most-booked restaurants in the city than flake, I’d say the bet’s based on whether or not we appear in the communal kitchen tomorrow morning together or separately.”
He’s tried—countless times, in fact—to dissuade her from doing this. It’s been a running joke between them for years, ever since that first time in the back of the C-130.
“I like the look you’ve got going on, by the way. Very devil-may-care. How long did it take you to decide against the jacket and tie?” Tony asks once Steve’s finished doling out pasta for himself.
The HUD is a brightly colored mess of information: live police reports from the ground, vital signs of wounded civilians, schematics of every building between 28th and the Flatiron, but all Tony needs to know is where Steve is, and if he’s okay.
, and Tony has been on the outs with God and organized religion for years but for Steve he might just be willing to reconsider his stance. “Fucked me all the way open, loose, you-you did that.”
Tony swallows down the bitter pang of his own miserly self-consciousness and arches his back under Steve’s roving hands, purring under the attention and shoving down thoughts of scars and judgment and pain. Steve seems determined to only make him feel
Natasha would be proud of him, the way he punches Skull clean through the side of the mountain on his way out.
Resolved, thrilled, terrified, and painfully needy, Tony does what he always does in these situations, Steve Rogers notwithstanding: he moves to take the lead, because while Steve’s words are still ringing all of the bells in Tony’s animal brain—
Clearing his throat, Steve continues: “What I mean is, do you feel like yourself in that suit, or do you feel like the Tony Stark everyone else expects and wants you to be?”
“Captain Rogers,” he says, and sticks out his hand. Steve shakes it. The man points a thumb at himself: “Captain Freddy Harrison. A little after your time, sir, but an honor to meet you regardless.”
Tony plucks a flute of bubbly off a passing tray and slips a few crumpled hundred-dollar bills, unnoticed, into the waiter’s apron as he walks by. “Thanks, J.”
And Steve is right there, breathing heavy, wet and gasping and grunting against Tony’s tender mouth, their foreheads stuck together like magnets.
of film smacking the floor as the reel spins on and on until coming to a feeble stop. He can hear breathing, heavy and labored and sliding quickly toward panic, and he realizes with a shuddering gasp that it’s
in the process. I want to ignore how much my back hurts, because I’m not as young as I used to be. I want to forget how old I’m getting, how scared I am about this new team. How easy it was for
Steve closes the greenroom door behind him with a chuckle, already opening his arms as he turns around to let Tony in.
Behind him, Steve hums thoughtfully. “Hi, Rhodey,” he says, knowing Tony will pass it on, because of course Steve would, and of course Tony will. Tony scoops ground coffee from a bag, not caring which one he’s dipping into, and fills the bottom of the French press as the electric kettle comes to a hissing boil.
“Gonna fill you up again,” Steve groans, coming down to lie on top of Tony, who moans at the weight, feels safe and protected and held there under Steve, hot all the way through, inside and out. “God, Tony, you’re so
open, until Tony is gasping from it, the thickness, the burning heat, the wet, slick sound of Steve’s cock shifting in his ass. In the quiet room it’s the only thing Tony can hear besides their breathing. At this point he can’t even tell if it’s dark outside, what time it is, what he’s supposed to do next: all Tony can do is lie there and let Steve press inside, deep, deeper, massive, burning.
“No?” Tony responds, hoping his voice doesn’t betray the terrified thrill that goes through him at Steve’s words. In a second it doesn’t even matter anymore, though, because Steve’s got a hand on the back of Tony’s neck and is pressing him down, face first into the duvet, and lifting his hips up with the other, brushing burning kisses down the length of his spine as he does so. Hysterically Tony thinks Steve can’t possibly be planning what Tony thinks—hopes—he is. He’s gross, hasn’t showered in a couple days, but that doesn’t seem to be stopping Steve, who’s spreading Tony’s ass with one hand and licking a hot, wet stripe up from Tony’s balls to his clenching, empty hole, groaning like
He doesn’t let himself linger on the feelings that elicits, even if they are bubbling right under the surface and dangerously close to what one might call
Steve makes a small, noncommittal sound of interest as he rakes his fingers through Tony’s hair. “What offer?”
“Sorry, that came out wrong,” Steve says quietly, now leaning slightly into Tony’s space. Attempting to ignore the fact (and failing) that he can feel the warmth coming off of the other man at this distance, Tony blinks at Steve with all the wherewithal of a deer caught in the headlights.
The elevator lifts them smoothly up, smooth as the suit in flight, the subtle Gs making Tony’s stomach swoop. The only reason he notices time passing is because of the floor numbers flashing on the screen behind Steve’s head.
It’s Steve’s nature to care. Tony can be cruel when he’s in pain, he knows, but even he’s not so cruel as to tell the man in front of him he doesn’t care
He’s still staring at Tony’s heart when Tony bends down to brush his lips against Steve’s cheek. The scratch of beard and mustache makes the hairs on the back of Steve’s neck stand vividly on end; if he had a brain cell to spare he could probably count them. As it is, he’s dumbstruck by the feeling of Tony’s lips against his cheek,
Tony winces. “Harder than it looks.” Steve laughs, so, mission accomplished there, but he won’t let go of Tony’s hand. If anything, Steve just draws closer, brushing his thumb against the back of Tony’s hand like a metronome.
and still Tony can’t muster himself to take the dozen steps into the living room and plant himself in the man’s lap. He can do that, can’t he? Or did the week of almost total radio silence put a kibosh on the whole Steve-and-Tony thing?
Tony tries to look anywhere but at the long, protruding veins in Steve’s forearms and gives up after two seconds. “After the second time I bumped into you out here, I asked JARVIS to notify me whenever you come home from one of these things,” he says, hurrying through the statement like something’s chasing him. “That’s—shit, that sounds a lot creepier when I say it out loud.”
, and he’s not counting them but he’s not going to forget a single one of them, either. This one is hard, fierce like Steve is fierce in battle, charging forward with single-minded focus; Tony moans, kissing back as much as he can in this position, bent-backed and breathless as Steve siphons the air from his lungs and sucks his lips until they’re slick and pliable and helpless against Steve’s. When his arms start to tremble from the effort of holding himself upright, Steve notices, and he moves a hand from Tony’s ass to his throat, holding him there so, so gently, even as he continues to plunder Tony’s mouth like he’s digging for gold. Tony shivers—Steve is so strong, he could crush Tony’s windpipe as easily as if it were a twig, but Steve is also hypercompetent and infinitely caring. He would never let it happen.
Steve’s blood has pretty much pooled completely south at this point, but his heart still gives a valiant pulse at Tony’s words, his expectant, eager smile.
The reporter is breathless as she gives the play-by-play of everything that happens next on screen: Tony’s helmet coming off in Steve’s hands, Steve sobbing openly over his unresponsive body, Steve leaning down and kissing him like it’s the last thing he’ll ever do, right before Sam and Thor come up behind him and pull him away so the paramedics can get to work.
, and then he’s closing his eyes, full hand still raised in the air, as Tony moves to kiss him right under the eye.
Of course Steve would end up with Sam, Tony thinks. Sam is the kind of good Tony could never hope to be—no blood on his hands, at least not like Tony has and can never wash off, no matter how many lives he saves. He’s Steve’s age, and smart, and stable, and trustworthy down to his core. He’s also hot as hell, Tony can easily admit, even if Steve burns hotter than anyone who enters his orbit. Tony once joked with Steve that Tony was the ugly one in their relationship, but Steve’s sour expression had stopped Tony from expanding on that particular line of self-deprecating humor.
“I could do this for hours and you’d love it, wouldn’t you, Tony?” he says, and Tony’s eyes fly open when Steve follows that up with a long, slow graze of his fingertips against Tony’s sweet spot, deep inside. To Tony’s bewilderment, he feels his cock stir, motivated by Steve’s patient and decidedly
Tony scrambles for a handhold, digging his fingers into the back of Steve’s neck and hanging on like a limpet while Steve rolls and bounces him slightly on his thigh and pulls him up hard against his dick every now and then, clutching his ass so firmly Tony knows he’ll have ten individual bruises in the shape of Steve’s fingertips there for a
and Tony wants it so bad he’d be begging for it if he could catch his breath. And Steve, who stammers and blushes so pretty when he’s being earnest and kind and thoughtful,
instead Steve's here, lying in on a rainy Sunday morning, with Tony, watching him sleep, watching him wake up, greeting him with a sleepy smile and a kiss on the forehead and a "good morning, sweetheart" in that gorgeous sleep-roughened voice of his and—
Steve knows this is selfish and reckless and his staying here could break the fabric of reality itself, but he would choose this—he’d choose Tony, warm and alive and smiling at him—every time. There are battles to be fought and truths to be told and lives to save, and he may never get to have Tony in all the ways he wants him in this or any timeline, but he’s willing to wing it and see.
. “Next time you feel like going into a tailspin over whether or not I feel the same way, I want you to remember this,” Steve says, moving his fingers to massage the sensitive skin of Tony’s perineum through his jeans until Tony’s eyes are rolling up into his head where stars live.
, Tony chides himself as Steve guides him through the doorway with a hand on the small of his back—nothing about them is normal.
Tony sags into Steve’s touch, his large, warm hand cradling Tony’s head like something precious; the deeper dark quiets the room around them, makes it less overwhelming, less full of ghosts waiting to cast their own opaque shadows on the empty walls. Tony and Steve are left standing in a dim light Tony knows makes him look sallow; he wavers on his feet, left to borrow from Steve’s strength because he can’t find his own. Lucky for Tony, Steve is right there, braced and ready for anything. Like always.
, and then he’s moaning into the duvet because of Steve’s hands, both of them, kneading and spreading his ass, hot and insistent. “I’m not the boy scout you think I am, Tony.”
Tony fidgets nervously with a mini Phillips Head screwdriver, twiddling it in his long, clever fingers as he stares out the windows at the city sprawled out beneath them.
“Sure,” he says, not turning around to look at Steve, as much as he wants to. It’s for the best, he reminds himself for the thousandth time that day. The less he looks at Steve, the easier this will be for him. For both of them. “Send ’em through the server so JARVIS can throw them up for me when I get back to the lab tonight.”
“Got something better in mind, Cap?” Tony says, wriggling his hips against Steve’s, gasping at the brush of wet fingers against his hole. As if to answer his question, Steve presses them inside, slow and deliberate and so wet, it drips past Tony’s balls and onto the sheets. Something goes loose in the back of Tony’s brain at that, at Steve feeding his come into Tony’s body. It’s so fucking filthy, it’s perfect. Tony gasps against Steve’s grinning mouth, whines despite himself at the gentle way Steve fingers him, soft and gentle. He doesn’t know what to do with his hands. He settles on clutching the bedspread, squeezing his thighs against Steve’s hips.
Now, Steve pushes the orb back through the energy barrier, mouth pressed in a firm line. The burns will heal, in time. He has plenty of it, after all, and the pain is a cheap price compared to what he felt watching Tony die, and it’s a price he’s more than willing to pay if this works.
Tony waves the question away. “No, no. I called LifeAlert and Happy came and took care of him. All fine.” Tony can’t muster a full press smile right now, but he manages enough of one to convince himself, at least. Steve, not so much. His concerned frown deepens, eyes focused and bright with so much goddamn
“Stay,” Steve says, lips tingling. Tony, smiling, smooths Steve’s hair back from his face. His mouth is a gorgeous, kiss-bruised shade of pink that makes Steve’s cock pulse and his heart pound for
“Easy,” she says, “I let them drink until they pass out and then I run back to the women’s barracks with all their clothes so they have to walk across the TOC butt-naked.”
don’t look at each other like they want to throw each other down on the nearest flat surface and fuck the other person stupid.”
,” he whimpers, chasing that pressure against his sweet spot and whining when he can’t get it, squeezing Steve’s shoulders and driving his hips down against his hand for more of those fingers, more,
Life, Steve’s learned too many times in too many devastating ways, is too goddamn short. Tony didn’t hesitate, in the end, so Steve won’t either. Not now.
Steve pulls away with a wet suctioning sound, filthy and loud in the soundproofed bedroom. Tony moans at that, because who wouldn’t. It’s so lewd, so unlike Steve, but he knows if he looks over his shoulder, that’s who he’ll see. And isn’t
This seems like a fork-down conversation. Steve places his on the table and tries not to glance longingly at the pasta on his plate. Steve knows when Tony is gathering himself to speak, which is exactly what’s happening now, so he waits  and doesn’t eat. He does take a drink, though. That much feels appropriate.
The person who opens the door is far from expected, but like Nat told Scott that fateful day back at the compound,
Everything is calculated with Tony’s pleasure in mind. There’s not going to be much more of this he can take.
them to leave. Tony isn’t exactly complaining—Steve’s hands are magic, big and steady and confident, like the rest of him, and they curve around his hip and the swell of his ass perfectly. And he
Except when he does try, pressing his hands against Steve’s shoulders to push him around and down onto the bed, he’s met with pure resistance, a steel wall of Steve Rogers, who looks half-starved and is staring at Tony like he’s a whole meal.
It spills over him like sunlight, that feeling—not just Steve’s body, but the way Steve’s breath trembles against Tony’s lips every time he pulls back for air. The way his strength never wavers, holding Tony up against the door. The way he looks at Tony, taking in the sight of him like a starving man at a buffet; the way he settles the more Tony touches him, making little gasping noises when Tony runs his fingers through his hair and whining when he scratches him gently behind the ears. Tony takes it all in, already breathless at the thought of what other sounds he can pull from Steve.
you've had a little velvet box hidden away in your bottom bedside drawer for four months when Tony wakes up and sees you in bed with him, realizes you've been watching him sleep—so peacefully, the furrow between his brows erased, as you play with his slightly overgrown hair (you wish he'd keep it, but it's a hazard, in your line of work). you kiss him on the forehead and say
When he weaves their fingers together, he gets to watch Tony’s mouth click shut and his eyes go wide. Super-hearing means he can count the beats of Tony’s racing heart without having to feel them. Steve’s telegraphing every movement, every feeling, as much as he possibly can now that words seem to have escaped him.
Steve’s bright red face is projecting what must be a similar train of thought, because Clint laughs at them from his place on the couch, jarring them from whatever trance they got locked into when Steve walked into the room and
, every inch, every vein and ridge, the flared tip of his cockhead where it meets the shaft, and then he’s thrusting back in with a grunt, so hard and deep Tony’s head rocks back against Steve’s hand, “and fuck you any way I want, whenever I want. Feed you my cock until you can’t think of anything else. And you said I could do whatever I want, Tony. Remember that?” He does it again, slower this time—draws out, so slow Tony feels
“Only a few seconds. Natasha did the lion’s share of the work picking the shirt out for me,” Steve replies, blowing gently on his forkful of pasta, saliva pooling in the back of his mouth as he watches the steam trail off it before taking a bite. “Why, do you think I should have kept th—
“You like that?” Steve asks him, pressing his come-soaked fingers in deep, so deep Tony knows he’ll never forget the feeling. “Like having my come inside you?” He gasps wetly and nods, screwing his eyes shut so Steve can’t see the dazed, love-sick look he can barely hold back anymore. “Yeah, you do. You love it. Love being marked,” Steve says, pressing hot, branding kisses to Tony’s cheek, his neck, his chest as he fucks his come into Tony’s soft, open hole, brushing his thumb against his slick rim every now and then as if for emphasis. “You liked it when I spanked you, too, didn’t you. You’re so good, you’ll take anything I give you.”
“Just stressed out,” Tony replies. “You know how it is. Too much too fast too soon—gotta level myself out somehow.” He leaves out the bigger picture stuff, the things he really can’t bear thinking about even as—or maybe especially as—the New Avengers move into the tower: Wanda and Vision, Hawkeye and Ant-Man, the mansion, their
,” Steve whispers as he ducks his head over the bowl to catch a bigger whiff of the red pepper-and-cream sauce, just loud enough he knows Tony will hear him. The other man giggles. It’s too fucking cute. Steve has to remind himself for the millionth time that this is not actually a date, because the words are right on the tip of his tongue.
“So good, Tony, so good, so good for me,” he rasps, a filthy mantra scraped off the tongue he’d shoved up Tony’s ass earlier, and
. He loves Steve’s misplaced sense of optimism and the way he can’t stomach zombie movies; loves his discordant collection of grandpa flannels and form-fitting dark wash jeans; loves his inability to back down and his ability to keep others from falling; loves his bone-dry sense of humor and his foul mouth and his sweet, soft, tender heart.
closer all of a sudden. His chest rises and falls evenly, but Tony—who over the course of his lifetime has studied that chest to within an inch of its life—can tell Steve’s breathing has sped up.
“It took me a minute,” she replies, unwrapping her hands methodically. The air around them is stale with the smell of sweat and warm canvas, but it’s comforting. As close to an old boxing ring as Steve gets these days. “The only good read I’ve gotten on you sexually was when we kissed at the mall.”
is the work of art in this scenario. He stays perfectly still as Steve works his way into Tony’s willing body, slow and inching, stretching Tony to fit around him with all the patience of a fucking saint. Tony groans, clutching the sheets with his free hand; he’s half out of his mind already and Steve isn’t even halfway in, so big and overwhelming with his impossibly thick cock pressing against his walls. It shouldn’t be so difficult, after Steve worked so hard to open him up, tongue and fingers, but he’s just that
Sometimes it’s the only thing that gets him through it. Coming home and talking to Steve in hushed tones over leftovers and water, sometimes tea, with Steve none the wiser that all the while Tony is fantasizing the most mundane things: sickening little domesticities like Steve undoing Tony’s cufflinks and massaging his shoulders before carrying him to bed, or even just wrapping him up in a hug for a few minutes, whispering—
He dials into the Avengers main comm line as he scans each building for heat signatures. “Cap, pick up.”
Tony doesn’t know this woman. Going by the wary skepticism in his voice, neither does Steve. But unlike Tony, who (mostly) knows how to duck out of conversations he doesn’t want to have with people he doesn’t like (last week’s interaction with Justin Hammer notwithstanding), Steve is polite to a fault. Tony listens from his hiding place behind the door (because this is who he is now, apparently) as Steve hums.
, like his pupils have just about been burned out of his skull with want, so blown out and dark Tony can see his reflection in them.
. But Tony knows his interest and affections are very much one-sided, and Tony doesn’t need to flagellate himself over it any more than he already does with everything else in his life. Plus, watching Steve with each of his girlfriends is more than taxing enough.
“Be right down,” he says, and in less than three minutes Tony Stark is strolling out through the front doors wearing bright red sunglasses paired with the shirt, belt, and trousers from the suit he wore to dinner last night. He dives straight into the melee, all flashy smiles and smart one-liners, saying
Tony tries to pull away. He does. But when he gives Steve the universal squeeze for “Hug over,” Steve responds by tightening his hold around Tony’s middle and breathing out a long, warm, humming sigh that goes right down the back of Tony’s neck.
, leaning into Steve’s steady hand for support. Steve can feel Tony’s laugh as much as he can hear it: it feels like home and sounds like rock music and looks like sunlight spilling out between his fingers, bright blue.
It’s not like when Natasha kissed him—hot and hurried and just shy of open-mouthed. This is slow, unbearably tender, and Tony never parts his lips more than a centimeter or two, if Steve could count. It’s
“Not much,” Steve replies, easygoing, like having this conversation isn’t the last thing he wants to be doing this morning. Tony knows deep down that this is just Steve playing nice, doing his best to mend fences for the sake of the team. If possible, the knowledge just makes Tony feel worse, which he didn’t think was possible. “I’ve been working on putting together intel on possible new recruits, like we discussed. Want to take a look?”
is nothing. There’s a scenario here, a variation of this exact moment in which hugging leads to kissing leads to
He’d groused at Steve for ruining his helmet and removed it entirely before moving up onto one knee, a wobbly facsimile of Iron Man’s characteristic three-point landing. Steve had moved in front of him to help him to his feet. The Avengers were busy taking down the last of the Doom Bots and paid their leaders no mind once Steve assured them over the comms that Tony was okay; they didn’t see the moment Tony, one knee still on the ground, put his hand in Steve’s and looked up at him like
He’s smiling, looking vaguely downwards where he knows Tony is, when Rogers looks at him and asks, “Why?”
“From here on out, then?” he replies hesitantly. Steve’s grin is all the answer he needs. Tony steals a kiss off that smile because he’s allowed to test these new waters, damn it. They’ve wasted enough time as it is. He slips off Steve’s leg with a grunt. “Okay, gross,” he mutters, shifting awkwardly in his damp jeans. Steve laughs.
How he’s expected to function now that Steve is supposedly his, Tony has no idea; every desire he’s ever had has suddenly burst forth at once. Some of them are so goddamn domestic, too. But that’s the thing with Steve—what they’ve built over the years, what they’ve been to each other and what they’ve become, it’s all so fucking
On nights like this, as Tony drives himself back to the Tower after having talked and schmoozed and flirted his way through a hundred different people for the sake of a little good Avengers PR, he imagines walking off the elevator onto the common floor and being met with a soft but meaningful
Steve, for his part, takes the hug in stride like they do it every day. Tony likes to imagine it, touching Steve like this whenever he wants to, but that’s all it is—a fantasy. Just like being with Steve is a fantasy, one Tony has entertained for far too many years to count. He satisfies himself with Steve’s friendship, tells himself it’s enough, and if he happens to sleep with the occasional look-alike, that’s nobody’s business but Tony’s (and JARVIS’s, and in one deeply unfortunate instance, Pepper’s).
, and Steve would reciprocate, but this isn’t real life. This is a fluke, a generous departure from their day-to-day lives so Tony doesn’t break his sobriety or go on an insomniac tech bender for three straight days. After this, Steve will go back to his life, and Tony to his, and they’ll be friends, but Tony will have to go on living knowing this is what he could have had if things were different.
Tony doesn’t respond, but he doesn’t have to: the look on his face answers Steve’s question just as well. “Armor or no armor, you
my good poker face,” Steve replies, and there it is again, the same look Steve gave him earlier before the night spun out like a race car with its wheels blown off: intense, considering, and so, so close.
“Breathe,” Tony smiles, reaching up and holding the back of Steve’s head like it’s something precious he wants to protect. Steve gasps, too wrapped up in what’s happening to be embarrassed; god, he’s panting like he ran a mile and Tony’s barely touched him.
Tony didn’t install security cameras in the bathrooms, so he won’t be able to rewind the footage to make sense of how he went from standing flat on his feet in front of Steve to being pressed back and up against the door having the air siphoned from his lungs, but he’s not about to lodge a complaint. He just hooks his legs around Steve’s waist and holds on for dear life while Steve fills him in on everything he’s been missing this past week while caught up with meetings and profit statements and schematics and event planning and now his brain is oozing out of his ears because Steve’s cupping his ass with both hands and is all but fucking Tony’s mouth with his tongue and who the hell needs a profitable global business when there’s
Steve’s cock slip in impossibly deeper, his stomach dragging against Tony’s dick on every powerful driving thrust.
“Thanks, babe,” Tony says smoothly, as if he didn’t just come within millimeters of kissing Steve on the lips. As if
It’s not surprising to walk into the Avengers common area and see Tony Stark working on something no one can quite comprehend. That’s par for the course, really, as commonplace as days that end in Y. Machines, phones, tablets, watches, the toaster after Hulk pressed the cancel button a little too hard—they’ve seen Tony futzing with just about everything that exists in the Tower (and some things that don’t—couldn’t—exist anywhere else except where Tony is).
Tony reaches out for the keypad, fully intending on hitting the button for the workshop floor, way down in the belly of the tower where he won’t disturb anyone. Where no one will disturb him.
“I can give you more,” Steve says, and then he’s grabbing Tony’s hips and stalling his own, leaves his cock inside Tony like the world’s best, hottest buttplug, keeps him full and spread open on his lap as he adjusts him, fixes his grip on Tony’s narrow hips, and then he’s using that gorgeous supersoldier strength to fuck Tony down on his cock, all the way down to the hard, thick base of him and up, almost to the tip, before pulling him back down. Tony
at him, and Tony knows he’d do anything to keep Steve looking at him like that. Like Tony is everything, the way Steve is to Tony. “But
so when you kiss the first time, you think he knows. when you go on your first real date and play footsie all night under the table and hold hands the whole walk home, you think he knows. when, a few days later, he slides inside you, deep and hard and wet, and butterfly-kisses the tears from your eyes and tells you how beautiful you are as he fucks you, wailing, into the mattress, you know, down to your

looking at Steve when he asks it. If Steve could put a word to his expression, he’d say Tony looks downright despondent at the idea, even if they’d already established earlier that yes, this thing was entirely Nat’s idea because she’s an unrepentant troll.
“Tony,” he whispers, just loud enough for the other man to hear. When Tony looks back at him, there are no barriers—no sunglasses, no masks, no playing pretend. Steve’s heart stutters in his chest to see himself reflected in Tony’s warm, brown eyes. He thinks he might want to stay there. He knows that’s what it feels like for him—he’d look at Tony all day, every day, if he could.
the one being kissed. Thoughts of anything alla vodka fly out of his head in a rush as Tony licks the closed seam of his lips and tongues him deep and slow when they open. Steve’s fingers are still grasping the front of the Tony’s shirt; he knows he should release him and stop this while things are still relatively PG. Instead Tony nibbles on his bottom lip and Steve releases that lewd moan he’d held back a few minutes ago right into Tony’s mouth.
That cold feeling floods him again, freezing his heart in place as Steve reaches for the TV remote. The screen flickers on, vibrant colors taking shape as a reporter recounts the events of that afternoon’s attack by the Wrecking Crew and how Iron Man saved the day. The footage captures the moment the bomb exploded, windows blowing out onto the street and the structure collapsing into a heap of rubble and brick dust; it had been fully evacuated by the time Tony showed up on the scene, apparently, and thank goodness.
“You’d better,” Steve growls, so low and rough it makes Tony gasp wetly against his crotch, because apparently Tony is
that sells it. His face is why The Picture™ has been the #1 trending thing on Twitter for going on twelve hours, and why Clint whistled Wagner’s bridal chorus at him when they walked back into the tower last night.
Only later will Tony be able to recall how the next few seconds unfolded: how Steve moved a hand from the deep curve of Tony’s lower back and used it to cradle his jaw; how he notched the thumb of that hand under Tony’s chin to tilt his face up mere centimeters to meet his; how Steve’s long, long lashes flashed gold in the low light as his eyes fluttered shut. Tony might even watch the Tower’s security footage to confirm that’s how it went.
