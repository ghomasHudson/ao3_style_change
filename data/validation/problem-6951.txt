He should’ve figured that — despite college students’ constant fearing over the future, — they would also want to hang onto certain parts of their pasts and childhoods. And rereading their favorite books was a great way to experience the nostalgia of their times before student loans and grade-point averages.
The Ferris wheel began to spin once again and the couple’s seat slowly rose to the top as the carriages under them exchanged passengers every step of the ride’s revolution. Every time the attraction would stop, it rocked the benches attached to it in a soothing, delicate manner.
Ever since the day that Tony had fixed his mother’s family heirloom, a necklace that Steve had accidentally dropped it, the unmistakable truth had crashed down on the blond: That he had fallen in love with the brunet and he had fallen fucking hard. Steve thought that it should have been more evident to himself, after all, he had known about his not-so-secretive crush on his best-friend for years before Tony had offered to fix his mother’s most-prized possession.
However, despite outright declining his friend’s offers of payment and refusing to speak about the subject of his salary, it had always been one of Tony’s biggest worries. But if he worked for a millionaire, and the millionaire liked what he was doing, Tony was sure to at least make enough to last until the next year - and if he had any extra, he’d for sure be spending it all on those pricey bittersweet chocolate chips for his
Lightly grunting as he got out of his very comfy position, Tony got up and quickly headed over to where he had previously heard Steve’s voice call out from. Surprisingly, he was nowhere to be found.
However, neither Steve nor his partner beside him revealed their identities to each other. By now, the two of them were the only people still embracing their masks upon their face.
“I was actually planning to confess my love for him tonight, but I never found him amongst all the people in the masquerade.”
At least there’s one thing that Tony and Steve could agree on: paperwork. Not the most stimulating topic for friendships to blossom from but Tony wasn’t exactly expecting to develop a close relationship with Steve while he worked for him, anyway.
They’ve already exchanged phone numbers and have hung out on several occasions — and Tony would consider all of it “progress” — if he wasn’t almost-one-hundred-percent sure that Steve had no interest in being anything other than friends with him.
“God fucking dammit, Rhodey,” Tony sighed and flopped down on his couch. “Whatever at this point. And tell me - why did you give him my food and why are you telling me this, again?”
Glaring at his best friend, Tony glanced at his clock, checked the time, swiveled around, and started to walk towards the kitchen, “Now if you’ll excuse me, since we’ve been arguing all morning and now that it’s 10 AM, I’m going to go start making myself some
to his problems with the horrific pay and constant berating from Howard for working at such a “disgusting and cheap” establishment. And even if Tony had practically scoured all of New York for the perfect job that could actually bring him contentment, no occupation that he’s been in could satisfy his taste or dreams of being his own cook: the money that his better jobs could pay him couldn’t satisfy him, neither could the exquisite and elaborate 5-star recipes and courses that he had the opportunity to make at places like Obie’s, and the loathsome treatment that he had received from his dad every day that he worked for Howard wasn’t remotely worth the job at all.
Clearing some of the dust away on the main island that was in the middle of the room, Tony gingerly placed the glass containers onto the top of the counter and a soft ‘
Bucky then focused his gaze at Steve and stated, “You do realize that you’re a millionaire, right? You’re a real, goddamn, fucking millionaire, Steve! Your company isn’t going to become corrupted and its stock isn’t going to crash if you just take one little break for a proper dinner for once!”
Tony advanced forward until he was so close to Steve that he swore he could feel the heat radiating off of him.
Surprised, the other Avengers swiveled in their seated positions to look at the bird-themed superhero, intrigued.
They propped themselves up against the railing, perceiving the untouched tranquility that was almost invisible against the noise and bustle of the nearby kingdom.
“I don’t regret ever loving you but I do regret never telling you how much I loved you before… before leaving you.” Steve halted and caught his breath but his passion drove him on. “I know you don’t want to hear me apologize and you never liked me pleading with you either, but right now it’s the only way I can explain how I could love you so much but leave at the same time. I never left. Listen to me, Tony, please, because I never truly left you. I never truly left you because you had never truly left me, ever. In all of my fucking pathetic life, you never left my side, you were always there for me; physically or just in my heart, you were consistently there for me, supporting me, encouraging me,
Tony grumbled, his mind still set on refusing Rhodey’s offer, “What if he’s just like Howard? Or even worse, what if he’s at first, super sweet and then over time as I continue to work for him, he turns into a person like Howard?”
“Have you finished those personal letters those clients that have purchased your most recent artworks, Mr. Rogers?”
And somehow society still thought that being a millionaire meant being able to have 5-star and 5-course dinners every day.
Gripping the book tightly, Tony willed his eyes to focus, his awareness of the blond’s presence evaporating, and finally read the very first words of line 24.
“His heart’s just crushed and shattered into a million pieces, his pride basically crumbled into ashes and dust, yet here he is. Still head-over-heels in love with you. You’re all he ever talks about. All he ever worries about. He never cares whether his own body is functioning decently because he’s too busy wondering whether you really hate him or not, or whether you got out of his house okay without his father finding out about you. He’s obsessed with you like you’re one of his own inventions.”
A million questions raced through Tony’s head as he felt his heart start to pick up its pace, the longer he stared into Steve’s handsome face — Was there any other synonyms that Tony hadn’t used yet to describe the absolute perfection of this person’s bodily features? The brunet was sure he should have run out of words that had the same meaning as “beautiful,” by now.
, an Italian dessert,” Rhodey responded while he walked outside, returning to hand Steve a clean fork from a plastic bag that he had left outside. “It was freshly made just this morning and it’s been chilling in my fridge ever since. Try it, it’s delicious, trust me.”
Birds chirped high in the air as they began to settle down for the end of the day and occasionally, a butterfly would flutter past, floating down onto the tips of nearby leaves or buds of the park’s flowers. The floodlights below them dotted the rolling fields in an unusual pattern of bursts of luminescence and casted long and narrow, dark shadows at the same time. Scattered throughout the tall grass were a handful of fireflies, and the glows of their tiny bodies just made the view around Tony even more mystical and welcoming than it was already.
right off the countertop. Upon retrieving the food, he hurried around the kitchen, eventually finding a fork, and took off back into the living room.
In the corner of his vision, he saw the brunet’s eyes glaze over in thought. A melancholic frown began to settle onto his face and Steve instantly started worrying.
Rogers still remained sitting in the living room and once Rhodey had left the penthouse to the two of them, Tony awkwardly faced him and his unusually-good-looking features, “Well, Mr. Rogers, I’m-“
“Leaving for Broadway isn’t what I’ve been dreaming of my life being because in my dreams… you were always there with me,” Tony confessed. “This isn’t my dream life because
Judging from the number of invitations that were going out to all the people of the allied kingdoms within S.H.I.E.L.D., Steve’s downfall would probably show up tomorrow evening at the party and snatch Tony out of his life before the blond could even find the other prince within the onslaught of guests coming into the ballroom.
Scrutinizing Rhodey’s suggestion, Steve said, “Do you really think that would be a good idea? I’m not so sure about inviting a stranger to come into my house, guys.”
Groaning, Rhodey shoved Bucky, who stumbled a few steps back but didn’t seem fazed. “You fucking asshole; I’ll have you know that my
Tony’s most recent ex was the same person who was playing the person that Alexander Hamilton cheats on Eliza with: Maria Reynolds.
Surprisingly, there were a handful of students older than him scattered around and in-between the shelves, lying in beanbags or sitting upright at various tables, all reading books from their respected section. Coming from a university dedicated to the most recent scientific and technological advancements in the world, Tony was honestly astonished to be actually seeing some of its students reading fantasy and teen-fiction books.
He stared at the spot where the brunet once stood and whispered a sentence that was never meant to be heard by only his one pair of ears.
“Don’t think like that, Stevie,” His mother gave him a firm hug. “That boy with begin to love you soon enough, just you wait. He’s just plain stupid if he still hasn’t perceived how caring and loving you are to him.”
“Yeah… Big event, isn’t it?” Steve stretched, lazily. “It should be fun, though. With all the panic that’s starting to build up among the kingdoms due to Hydra’s nonstop rebel attacks, holding this ball should relieve some of the stress among our people.”
“I was waiting for you to say that,” Tony laughed and returned the favor by pecking the blond on the cheek. “C’mon, before we waste the entire night making out — although I honestly wouldn’t mind doing that — and the carnival closes before we can even step foot in it!”
He felt better about his heartbroken rambling when he realized that he was talking about his pathetic, lovesick life to a stranger who he would probably never see again after tonight.
The prince beamed and continued to spread tiny kisses all over his partner’s hand until he saw that Tony’s attention had diverged onto something else. Steve followed the genius’ gaze up to ultimately admire the scintillating stars above them, although he would much rather prefer to explore and fix his sight on the person directly beside him.
“C’mon, speak to me. Or we can just open up these doors and walk right in - it’s your choice,” Rhodey offered.
“I could say the same about the guy that I was looking for, but you’re also pretty spectacular. Especially at dancing. And looks-wise, too.” The stranger flirted effortlessly.
Based on Tony’s calculations — yes, it was a thing he did now when it came to Steve — he should have a decent 70.0529% chance of achieving success — that is if Steve actually supposedly has the same feelings for the genius that he did, for him. Relatively speaking, Tony’s friends would definitely consider that pretty goods odds that would most likely turn out in favor for Tony — but he had to remind himself that that’s where the other 29.9471% falls in: mainly into two categories.
Deciding not to kill the friendly mood, Tony wiped his face of any negative emotions and plastered on a curious smile as a replacement, “I’m Tony, by the way. Tony Stark.”
Also, did he really have much of a choice at this point? Right now, he was stuck in his apartment waiting for Obie, of all people, to write back to him with a letter accepting him. Since when did he depend on Obie for the answers to the problems that his father created? They were practically the same awful, dreadful person; they both loved micro-managing and being the ultimate top-dog of their respective businesses. He honestly hated Obie just as much as he hated Howard but it certainly made a difference when Obie would actually give him some recognition for being a person that was more than just Howard’s son.
“Yeah,” The stranger visibly swallowed. “He… — I was supposed to meet up with him tonight, but I couldn’t find him. I suppose he just didn’t want to be seen with me.”
While he cranked his pasta machine, Tony brainstormed all the possible outcomes that a job such as a personal chef could bring him. Freedom was a clear benefit and the thought of being able to independently work in a huge kitchen and create whatever the hell he wanted, made him crank the handle just slightly faster.
“And please, please, Tony, believe me when I say this,” Steve’s voice quivered. “But I had never meant to leave you. Never for this long, never at all. I was jealous and upset and it made me make the stupidest, most fucked-up decision in my entire goddamn life: Leaving you.”
, this heartbreak, this tension, this aching, it helps us to learn from our mistakes. But I am, truthfully, willing to forgive you.”
The archer groaned with a mouthful of un-chewed popcorn, “Ugh, great. Now I don’t feel like eating this popcorn anymore because you got that image is stuck in my head!”
Streams of sunlight poured over their bodies, encasing them in a warm luminescence as a dainty breeze brushed past the trees overhead. Along with the hot summer air, nature had automatically created the perfect conditions to just sit outside, cuddle, maybe make-out a couple of times, and watch the sunset.
“Uh, are you sure about this?” An uncertain blond asked his enthusiastic boyfriend. “Tony, you know I’ve never been ice-skating before. Don’t you think I should at least learn before stepping foot on an actual lake?”
Rhodey shot him an irritated look, “Tony, you don’t actually have any reasons to dislike the guy! Hell, I bet you don’t even dislike him at all! You’re just saying that so you don’t have to go to his house and cook for him! And can I ask you again: Why are so intent on not cooking for Steve? Also, I’ve asked you this already but you do realize that this is your opportunity to literally cook anything you want with the tech of a millionaire’s kitchen?”
He just hoped his plan would work and Steve would get what he’s been wanting to tell him for months.
The warmth of the cup radiating onto his face made him sigh in content inevitably, and Tony examined his surroundings in his tiny corner of the massive library while sipping the richly-flavored drink. The whole building was covered in walls of books that lined each shelf with their colorful and intriguing covers and titles. Littered around the library floor, were students of varying ages, and occasionally a college professor, exploring the building’s many historical
Steve couldn’t even begin to imagine how plain and uneventful his life would be without Tony in it; just the thought of the alternate possibilities his future would have been like without the brunet, made Steve realize and reflect on how monumental of a catalyst Tony was, when he first entered his life. It was phenomenally scary; how fate could suddenly just miraculously conjure up a person to randomly appear into your life, interrupting and forever changing it — whether for the worse, or for the better — and Steve was infinitely grateful that the genius had come into his life for the better.
The blond wrapped his arms around Tony, spooning him as they kissed, deeply and ever-so-passionately.
Meanwhile, Rhodey invited Rogers to settle down and chat about Tony’s schedule and what times were best for him to stop by and bring Rogers some food.
Every time the genius’ mind would scurry back to his deep hole of self-doubt, he’d remind himself to try and distance himself more from Steve, in hopes that if he ever does get his heart broken by the blond, it’ll be a light let-down. Judging by the looks of their unbreakable bond that just kept getting stronger with each passing day, it didn’t look like Tony would be spared of any of his feelings anytime soon.
“I always feel like I’m in a fairytale when I’m around you.” Steve responded, with a tender look in his eyes.
“So you’re willing to put up with me and stay with me for the rest of your life?” Steve questioned him with a loving smile.
Steve had always felt that their relationship — although it hadn’t started off as perfect as the storybooks and fairytales said it would have — evolved into something that seemed even too far-fetched to be in a romance novel. Everything, from his college-life to his relationship, felt like he had just suddenly received it or stolen it from the destiny of some make-believe princess’. Things weren’t supposed to turn out this
“Definitely.” Tony agreed while wrapping his arms around Steve’s torso and burying his face in his chest. Steve reciprocated by completing their embrace and locking his hands together behind Tony’s back; his nose buried in Tony’s floral-smelling hair. The touch of the genius’ head digging into the area right above his heart, sent shockwaves of emotion and desire through his body.
As long as he had known the genius, Steve had never been so close to him without more than just friendly intentions. Sure, they’ve cuddled and slept on each other during sleepovers and movie nights, but no matter how many beguiling memories Steve is able to accumulate of their friendship over the years that he’s known Tony, this feeling of desperateness had never existed until how.
“Doesn’t matter, babe! The only thing that mattered is that I got you to successfully ice-skate with me for the first time in your life without any one of us getting injured! And you had a good time, which is a bonus!” Tony smirked while throwing back even more snowballs.
Abruptly, Pepper looked up to survey his expression. Her face lifted into a minuscule, but true smile.
While the blond was inspecting the foreign delicacy, Rhodey said, “If you don’t like it, I’ve still got plenty of other stuff in my car. In fact, I’ll go get them now. Hopefully, they haven’t been ruined by now; the sun’s not out so I’m not that worried. Anyways, let me know what you think of it when I get back.”
“OH WILL THE TWO OF YOU JUST SHUT THE HELL UP AND HELP ME CLEAN UP THIS MESS?!” Clint roared, probably loud enough to be heard from space.
The genius smiled in satisfaction and towed his nervous boyfriend behind him towards the center of the lake. Cautiously, Steve began to gain some confidence as he gradually got used to gliding around on two very sharp and dangerous blades stuck to the bottom of his feet. Not that that bothered him at all — because it didn’t. Obviously.
The brunet gasped dramatically, “After that moment that we just had? Absolutely, not. I’m going with you, whether you like it or not.”
because regardless of the lack of funds or the lack of time, Sarah Rogers was always the person to perform the tiniest and most kind actions to those around her, and more often than not, Steve was the direct center of her attention. And he loved it like that - every second of it until she had finally left him.
“I’m still terrified at the thought that he may have never truly cared for me at all, but I know him well enough to understand that that’s a blatant lie that my self-conscious and uncertain mind keeps coming up with.”
The scientist smiled as he returned to the movie just as Sam spoke up, “I’m down to watch ‘The Princess Switch.’”
Rhodey’s dark-brown eyes were already lighting up as his head immediately came up with a solution to Steve’s concerns. They twinkled as Rhodey smiled smugly, his gaze never leaving the blond’s face as he addressed both Bucky and Steve at the same time.
Accepting defeat — and with the encouragement of his family and friends, Steve stepped onto the pristine, white floor and was immediately swarmed with impatient women, eagerly awaiting him to choose someone to dance with. Ignoring them, he pushed his way past the bodies flooding around him and scanned the room for a dark-brunet prince.
“Because…Because it would show him that I cared. That I truly wanted him back. When we were still together, he…he had never liked it when I courteously asked for something and always insisted on giving me whatever I wanted straightaway without having to plead to him. And this time, I’m going to listen to him. I’m not going to beg him to come back to me. I’m going to let him choose whether he wants to listen to me or not because I never gave him a choice when I left him on that day.” Steve shuddered at the honesty dripping from his carefully chosen words.
Everything was absolutely perfect: the comfortable presence of his boyfriend, the sweet taste of love, kisses, and cotton candy still lingering upon his mouth, the gentle caresses that Steve and Tony would give each other every few seconds — it was all undoubtedly and certainly, heavenly — but the blond still felt that even
At that point, Steve couldn’t hold back anymore as his heart caved in to his natural instinct as he stepped forward, scooped up Tony in his arms—and kissed him. Their lips connected and their bodies fit together perfectly, like the pieces of a puzzle snapping together to form a bigger picture. And that picture was just being constructed and fabricated out of the recent rediscovery of this feeling that Steve just sometimes forgot was always there and when it does finally decide to show itself—it was like floating on a cloud and getting high off of the sunshine up in the sky.
He scoured the bookshelves until he arrived at the start of the fiction-based area, where a blond college student who looked like a football player, was looking for something in the shelves. Ignoring the stranger, Tony glanced at each book’s spines for the correct last name and once he had finally found what he’d been searching for, reached up for the only copy, only to bump his hand with the blond’s while doing so.
According to Natasha, Clint, Bruce, Thor, Bucky, Sam, and basically everyone who attended MIT, it was that big of a problem.
“Aw, come on, sweetheart,” Tony flashed him an adorable smile that seemed to melt all the snow around them. “Please, just this once? I promise that you’ll get the hang of it super easily and then you’ll learn to love it.”
Looking back at his friends, who all motioned him to follow the redhead, Steve shot up out of his chair and clambered up after her in an effort to look presentable to the genius. His nerves fluttered thought his stomach but he pushed through them, gripping his clammy hands into fists as he traveled up a few floors in an elevator and approached a grand, metallic door.
Steve almost wanted to pull away, but when he eventually forced to due to the increasing lack of air in his lungs, he instantly focused his sight on Tony’s flushed face and a small grin began to etch its way onto his face when he saw the starstruck sparkles that danced through the brunet’s eyes as he looked back up at Steve.
“I’ve just got so much work to do, ugh. I’ve barely even started these personal letters and they were supposed to be finished over an hour ago.”
Oh, and he should probably hope that Steve returned his feelings for him. That was probably the most logical thing to do right about now.
The genius stopped himself from almost scowling right in front of this extremely-attractive young man named Steve and bit his bottom lip, unconsciously.
Maybe he should just suffer through it and crash into his bad right after. Perhaps falling asleep will help him to get through the uneasiness that’ll undoubtedly come after eating cheap takeout and frozen
“Thanks,” Steve breathed and Tony’s heart just skipped another three-thousand beats. “I’ll bring it back as soon as I can — this book is just too good to have only one copy in this entire library for the all of MIT to share.”
“Don’t worry, Tones,” She reassured him as she gracefully sipped away at her drink. “I just went to the store and bought a new box of hot cocoa mix. And I’ve been keeping an eye on it ever since I stepped foot back into the tower. Those two haven’t messed with it. Yet.”
The prince and the masked-person fell into another period of silence but the chirps of the crickets hiding in the tall grass filled the soundless void that they had left behind.
Steve’s encouraging smile gradually vanished as he resorted to listening to the beguiling person next to him blither on.
Is this what human interaction was like? Because if it is, then Tony’s been missing out on so much during his childhood.
. Not only was he persistently just there, unfailingly by my side, but he took care of me like I was the last person on the entire fucking Earth. He…He would watch over me when I was sick, when I had nightmares and memories of my...my mother, when I missed her so much that it was physically impossible for me to do anything else other than cry. He never failed me, and I’m not going to fail him now either, especially when I’m this close to at least possessing a small chance.”
“Alright.” Pepper pursed her lips. “I’ll pop back in here once in a while to check on everyone, okay? And I’m going to inform Rhodey about your intentions, I hope you don’t mind.”
His parents glanced at each other before turning back to their son, both with a wide, entertained smile on each of their faces.
Steve wholeheartedly knew that he should grateful but he didn’t ask for this. No one ever asks for mounds of paperwork that people could literally drown in; he didn’t ask for the responsibilities that came with thousands, maybe even millions, of young artists looking up to him. He only wanted to paint and make a stable living off of it. It wasn’t his fault that his fellow college art students
worried about you. This really isn’t healthy and we want to help you so you can have a fresh dinner every night after work, not some leftover scraps that you’ve had for lunch or that we’ve brought home for you after
“Just, treat him right this time, okay? He deserves so much more than he believes he does. And truthfully, I trust that you truly are the one to make him see that.”
Queen Sarah smiled at the foreigners scattered throughout the ballroom, “Now is the time of the masquerade that we all must remove our masks in unison! Although, we are each as unique as the appearances that we wore this fine night, underneath these intricate disguises lay a cascade of the common faces of humanity, which we are all entwined and connected by, altogether.”
, were only supposed to happen in fantasy or teen-romance novels, not in real life. Or perhaps Tony had been wrong all this time.
On stage he was able to live the life of his dreams, with Tony captured in his arms, holding onto Steve like his life depended on it, but when he stepped out of the spotlight—that’s when every little dream, scenario, and act he was able to dedicate time towards and fixate himself on, suddenly crumples to the ground and shatters his hopes in about a hundred-million pieces. Out in front of the audience, the act and the experience was all he ever wanted in life—only for it to be revealed to his heart and head as fake, once he left the stage. Everything in his life was just turning to absolute shit, at this point.
“Hey, sweetheart?” Steve called out to the brunet who was currently lounging on the couch with the other Avengers, waiting for Bruce to finish making the popcorn before the team started their annual Christmas movie night. “Can you come over here for a second?”
Steve, because he was the one who baked all the cookies in the first place, speedily scooped up one chocolate-chip cookie, blew on it until it cooled down enough, and handed it to Tony, then briskly plucked a sugar cookie for himself, knowing that the small burns he received, in turn, would heal in a few minutes.
“It’s settled then, a chocolate-hazelnut coffee and a kiss. Tomorrow, at 9. Don’t be late.” Tony smirked. “Or else I won’t get either one of what I’ve just been promised.”
As the sea of people coursed by Steve, he scoured them all as he searched for Tony, only to give up after the last, few unmasked guests disappeared into the darkness of the night.
The blond remembered when a month ago, he and his friends had spotted Pepper across a coffee shop in mid-Manhattan. She was ordering two drinks, a coffee and what seemed to be a frappe. Before she could recognize Steve in the crowd of customers, he sprinted over to her to ask her if he could speak to Tony. The redhead’s eyes had hardened straightaway when she had identified Steve as the one talking to her.
Steve watched from behind the curtains as the story progressed through the musical and couldn’t help but stare along with the audience as Tony conquered the entire performance, altogether. The brunet truly was made to be out in the open, in the public eye; born to be awed and admired as he was both a natural on camera and on stage. Even though tonight was the university’s very first open performance night, Tony was still nailing every song spot on, and his raw talent unanimously captivated the audience’s attention and every person observing him from backstage.
Now Steve was unmistakably sobbing. Small tears pattered onto the floor but he didn’t try to hide them. He thought that his chest couldn’t be impaled anymore by his own emotions than it already had been, but he was just proven wrong.
The blond’s eyes lit up like a match lighting a candle. He moved at a painstakingly slow pace, eventually stopping right in front of Tony, their noses an inch apart. His head automatically tilted to the side — it was the perfect position for a storybook kiss. And Tony was determined to be the one to initiate it.
Pg. 171-172, Lines 1-23: “the poem” “I’m more than a little ambivalent over expressions of tender devotion” “This one day a year because greeting card companies profit off store-bought emotion.” “A romance-industrial complex so fueled by commodification of feeling” “Serves only to further homogenize all and promote what’s at best, unrevealing.” “It’s not just a lack of precision—this one-size-fits-allness—that leads me to mope.” :I think you and I share the same disillusionment, sprouted from long-buried hope.” “I worry, as you do, love dulls us to cold hollow sockets that ache for a joint.” “If ends are encoded in every beginning, we wonder, then what is the point?” “You’re right to be highly suspicious of seemingly mandated acts of affection,” “When all pretty words are a means to an ultimate heartbreak, a grand misdirection.” “I can’t guarantee that this letter won’t lead to us both one day broken and blue.” “All being said, though? You turn me to mush.”
This would be interesting. And extremely awkward. If the two exes didn’t kill each other first before the final performance weeks.
“That’s… amazing, Tones,” Steve said as his heart began to tug in two opposite directions, attempting to choose whether to be happy for the brunet or to be sad that there would be bad news soon to come: Tony could be leaving Steve, forever.
“Are you boys done fighting? My hot cocoa is literally shaking from the combined vibrations of your voices!”
“What?” Sam shrugged as he glared at Clint’s entertained look. “I like romance movies, damn, why is that so bad? Steve knows this! Go on, Rogers, tell ‘em.”
“Thanks, I guess… It still doesn’t guarantee that he’ll feel the same way about me that I do for him…”
Making up his mind after scanning everything that the moving-carnival had to offer, Tony clasped his boyfriend’s hand and tried to lead him into the fair, but Steve remained firmly in place.
Surprisingly, there weren’t a lot of cons that Tony’s ever-clever brain could think of. Sure, working in someone else’s home might mean that he would be far away from his own home, but he was pretty sure that the headquarters of Steve Roger’s company wasn’t that far away from his apartment complex; it had to be only a few blocks at most. And if he was required to permanently stay at Roger’s penthouse - well, Tony didn’t really have any problems with living in such a luxurious and fancy home.
Tony chuckled, “Steve, if I force my body to be any closer to you, I think we might accidentally glue ourselves together.”
If there was one thing that James Rupert Rhodes was good at that wasn’t sculpting, it was convincing his idiotic best friend to actually take care of himself every now and then. Sure, he wasn’t as good as or as intimidating as Pepper, but he still got the job done.
What Steve had in store for him couldn’t be good if he only needed one line of text to express it, right? Or maybe, Tony could be completely wrong.
Before he could even muster up the courage to fire back, Tiberius scrambled up and fled back into the auditorium, no doubt to complain to some of his bitch-ass friends about what just happened. Whatever, Steve couldn’t care less right now. All he cared about was keeping Tony safe.
“That’s no problem,” Rogers answered for Rhodey. “We can sort that out tomorrow morning; it’s getting late after all. I don’t know about you but I prefer not to have to continue doing paperwork after business hours are over.”
But considering Tony’s reckless personality and his well-known carefree behavior, Steve highly doubted he would even be aware of a fight between the brunet and his ex before it was all over. Tony could be so discreet sometimes. And dangerous.
“Were you expecting me to bring Steve dog food?” Rhodey gaped, annoyed, and took the container out of Bucky’s hands. “Just let him eat already, you asshole.”
“I know, Tones,” He replied in a curt manner, “It’s fine, there’s nothing you can do about it, anyways. Now will you please just look at the whoever got the lead role?”
eat the most popcorn because you’re always the one hogging the bowl!” — and turned to face Natasha, who was also pretending that the two bickering Avengers currently didn’t exist.
“Buck? You get his ass out of that chair yet?” Rhodey caught sight of Steve’s perplexed stare at his outfit and suspired, “I’m guessing not, judging by the fact that Steve’s ass is still glued to that chair.”
“You were supposed to treat him right! FUCKING HELL, STEVE!” The recent college-graduate howled in the room, and his ears started ringing in reminiscence. “YOU WERE THE ONE PERSON WHO
“And Tony, I know that right now you’re probably telling yourself, ‘He’s only slightly-interested in you, it’s nothing serious,’ — ” Steve said with an amused expression on his face. “ — That’s literally how well I know you — but I promise you; it’s definitely love that I’m feeling right now. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have used my favorite book to tell you.”
What if one of the snowballs that Tony had thrown at him had hit his head and now he’s in so much pain that he can’t even speak? What if he has a concussion, or worse, what if that snowball had knocked him out and by the time Tony finds him and manages to wake him up, he’ll already have a severe case of amnesia and won’t be able to remember all his years dating Tony at all? What if he’s dead?!
The disappointment and desolation of his fading existence within Tony’s life, ate away at Steve’s energy and chewed at his mental-stability, wounding him more than any fatal injury from a war’s battlefields ever could. Now, all the prince needed to wait for to give up on his love life, is a ravishing, attractive, and honorable royal who can keep up with Tony’s fast-paced mind, to sweep the genius off his feet and carry him far, far away from Steve.
Steve looked up from his desk that’s currently littered with various paperwork and sheepishly smiled at his assistant.
“Hey, shouldn’t you be preparing for the ball right now, anyways? Your kingdom is hosting it this year, so no-doubt that everyone’s trying to do their best in making the castle look presentable. Although, no castle should have this many red, white, and blue flowers out in the front yard.”
The blond blushed and peered at the pen in his hand, avoiding both Bucky and Rhodey’s questioning looks.
Steve rambled, his throat becoming hoarse from the pangs emerging from his lungs. “I can’t get him out of my thoughts, he’s eternally there and it’s killing me not knowing how he’s doing. And I’ve been enlightened that I’m a goddamn asshole for what I’ve done, and I’ve accepted the probability that Tony could quite loathe me right now, but it doesn’t change how much I want him back. And not for the reasons that you think.”
“Fine, Steve. I’ll let you see him, at most for an hour. Alright?” She finally offered. “Even I have to admit that you guys were the cutest and most perfect couple in the room, no matter how much I want to bitch-slap your face right now.”
he wanted to tell him. It hurt like hell that he still didn’t have the courage to do so, after so fucking long.
Steve’s voice faltered a little bit at the very end of the song but he managed to push through it, nonetheless. His breath hitched in his throat as his face drew nearer to Tony’s, and with one fell swoop, no practice, and a complete lack of coordination, Steve kissed the brunet.
Steve paused what he was doing and gaped up at the sculptor, “Uh, no, Rhodey. I haven’t. I guess, I really haven’t.”
Steve suddenly was facing with the one truth that he was absolutely not prepared for this evening: Tony had probably never come to the masquerade ball in the first place.
“Bucky? Natasha, is that you?” Steve’s face broke into a relieved grin. “Thank the gods — I swear — I don’t seem to know a single person in this room other than you two. By the way, Buck, who asked the question to come here, tonight?”
“Yeah,” Nat answered as she munched on some more popcorn and snuggled deeper into the couch under her massive, fluffy blanket. “But we’re watching it again because Thor hasn’t seen it yet.”
“You LEFT him there!” Pepper’s voice shrill screamed at him from the back of his head as he recalled the day she and Rhodey had stormed into Natasha’s house in the middle of him and his friends lounging around, watching a movie. “You
— a lot. And I really hope you do too; actually I’ve been hoping for quite a while now, — As in I hope that you loved me back; not yourself — Not that I’m saying that you shouldn’t love who you are, but I meant as in like you lov—“
The blond tilted his head down to give the cute, amazing, beautiful brunet next to him an affectionate kiss.
“That’s all I ever needed to hear, Tony.” Steve breathed out. “And just, so I can get it out one last time… I love you.”
pan into his preheated oven and set the timer for 45 minutes, the prospects of an actual good boss and all of the benefits that came with working in the house of a millionaire allured his head and Tony’s rapid brain sped off again; this time, he was determined to find some cons that could prove his point to Rhodey if he decided to turn his best friend’s offer down.
The genius sighed as he shut his eyes, stood on his toes, and pecked Thor on his cheek before quickly taking a step back away from the doorway and its “cursed” mistletoe.
“Anyways, uhm,” Steve politely disregarded Tony’s flirting and gestured to the book still sitting on its shelf, “Did you want that? ‘Cause, uh, I don’t want to take it from you — or anything.”
Steve felt a flicker of hope ignite in his chest. But it didn’t last very long, and neither did the surge of confidence that had accompanied the flash of hope.
Steve rolled his eyes, “For the last time, Tony, it’s patriotic! It’s the colors of our kingdom, so personally, I think that there should be more flowers than what we currently have now.”
Maybe Tony did have a chance with his absurdly-handsome crush, after all. But he didn’t want to make any assumptions until he had read Steve’s actual message.
“Tones! Do you mind if Sam, Bucky, and I got a head start in decorating the tree, right now? Those two are itching for something to do that doesn’t involve snow or ice.”
It felt like his personal laboratory at the university and he thrived in it. The brunet knew that he had always worked best under pressure; his brain just automatically pushed harder and more efficiently for certain ideas while under the careful judgement of others — it started doing that as soon as he had learned how to build his first engine, when cruel and controlling Howard began to constantly lean over his shoulder, watching Tony, as his son built away in his utopia of inventions and machines. And predictably, six-year old Anthony Edward Stark, would be desperate for his father’s approval and purposely performed better whenever Howard was watching him. But e stopped trying after two years.
“That’s a secret, Tony, remember?” The blond ran his right hand through the brunet’s fluffy hair. “You’ll just have to find out when it’s time to open ou—“
The blond looked down at his boyfriend sprawled on the ground with an amused look — God, he loved this man — before replying in a soft and tender voice.
A muffled, “For fuck’s sake, Steve,” came out of the brunet’s mouth as Steve wrapped his arms around his waist in order to calm him down.
The blond didn’t hesitate to roll his eyes, “Just because I play football and I hang out with my extremely-straight friends, doesn’t mean I can’t stand out as anything else by myself.”
The blond took a step closer, fully aware of Tony’s charily gaze on him. He took another step. And then another. And then another, until he was directly in front of him.
“Steve?!” Tony began to panic. “What the fucking hell?! You — you were next to me this entire time? — Oh my fucking, god… You heard my confession about yo—“
Everyone else rolled their eyes but decided to, crabbily, wait for the rest of the cookies to cool down — each one of them hoping that Thor wouldn’t have snatched and gobbled them all up by then.
“I love you. I always had and never stopped. I love you with every little bit of love that I’ve ever fucking have given out to anyone before. I love you more than this fucked-up situation that we’re in, I love you more than this fucked-up relationship that we’re in right now, I love you more than life itself. I love you more than the entire fucking cosmos coalesced together. I love you so fucking much that months could go by with just you occupying my dreams, my head, and my thoughts. I love you more than anything this goddamn universe has to offer me; more than all of the stars in the sky combined, more than any other celestial creation that the universe could ever offer me, more than all of life’s history combined, more than any being could ever even love life. I love you more than I could possibly, ever, in my entire fucking existence, ever tell you verbally. I love you so fucking much that I could never, in all of eternity, ever find a fucking way to describe with my words, or my actions, or my mouth, how much you mean to me, how much I just fucking absolutely love you.”
The blond shook his head as he reached for another sheet of computer paper, “I’m not going to risk it, Buck. This is my life now - might as well accept it. I have, now it’s your turn.”
Kingdoms united in the S.H.I.E.L.D. coalition required royals, like kings and queens, to pass down their title and positions once their children had been married; many of the kingdoms have already assumed new rulers and the commoners of the alliance welcomed the new generation of royals with renewed joy with each individual coronation. By now, the only two kingdoms who haven’t officiated their successors were Americandia and New Ironingham: Steve and Tony’s kingdoms.
It was so enormous of a problem that the only solution, — with the help of Tony’s friends’ pushing and encouragement — was to finally confront Steve about his feelings.
You fucking moron, he scolded himself as his brain immediately began to replay the images of Tony’s hurt and betrayed face as Steve backed off as their mouths were just about to come into contact. He knew how much the musical really mattered to Tony and by refusing to kiss him, Steve felt like he had just personally ruined the entire production of the show.
As his eyes began searching the area around them for the nearest snack stand, Steve gently tugged at his arm and shook his head.
“It’s almost the exact same for me,” The brunet whispered as his eyes traveled across the scenery that was splayed in front of them.
Within seconds, Steve had already won four giant stuffed-animal prizes for Tony and summoned a small crowd around him, each person gawking at his throwing skills, as the blond knocked over dozens and dozens of milk bottles without breaking a sweat. They ended up keeping only two of the plushies because they gave away the others to two crying little kids who they had comforted in the middle of the carnival after they had gotten separated from their parents. Later, when the children were reunited with their family and had successfully stopped sobbing, the parents had thanked the two of them immensely, sincerely. And if Tony was going to be truthful — he actually quite liked the proud feeling that blossomed inside his chest afterwards — it made him feel like a real-life superhero.
Maybe in a couple of years, after Tony had really saved enough to be able to do whatever he liked on his own, he’d finally get back at Howard for all that his dear-old-dad has done to him. And there was a lot that Tony had in mind. Screw trying to make Howard proud - he gave up that long ago when he realized that Howard Stark was practically incapable of loving anyone else other than himself - right now, all he wanted was justice.
“Yeah,” Steve almost choked on his words as he swallowed down his feelings. “I did get cast. I—uh, why don’t you just see for yourself?”
“Hush, Steve.” Tony grinned as he led his unfairly-tall partner onto the thick layer of ice covering The Pond, one of New York City’s many lakes located in Central Park. “Just let your feet guide and glide you. It’s easy, c’mon. See?”
How four hours of pure bliss with his favorite person in the entire cosmos could suddenly turn into his worst nightmare becoming reality was honestly purely comedic and almost ironic in a sense.
Natasha snickered, “No offense, Steve, but I just wanted to wish you good luck, along with Bucky here, in finding a certain prince, tonight.”
“Don’t say that,” Steve chided him. “Who could ever hate someone as fascinating and easy-to-talk-to as you?”
Just as the topic of his friends had reached his mind, Bucky bust through his office door, uncaring for the loud and peace-disturbing noise that he usually caused after slamming it shut.
The brunet anxiously clutched onto two glass containers full of food and shook his head, “Tell me why I agreed to this again.”
“I never forgot. I remember everything about you; your irresistible cuteness, your beautiful blush, and not-to-mention your fucking perfect kisses.”
The redheaded-queen raised an eyebrow at him but gestured her understanding with a flick of her hand as she dragged a cackling Bucky away in the opposite direction.
“Yeah, I know,” Steve grinned as a wonderful thought abruptly blossomed into his mind. “I just can’t wait until next year, when this will happen all over again.”
Turning to Steve, the brunet frowned, “Hey, you okay? Those kids look like they could really hurt someone if they tried crashing into them hard enough.”
“This, the two of us, this is just…” The blond’s voice trailed off as he unsuccessfully tried to form the words to just simply describe all that he was experiencing to his partner.
“It’s just — the carnival date, the Ferris wheel, winning all those prizes — and now this? You did all of this… for me?”
“Are you serious, punk? You know where we’re going tonight - Howard Stark’s! Didn’t you promise that you were going to say ‘hi’ to him today?”
“Tony, I don’t know if this is a good id—“ Steve’s words suddenly got cut off by the force of several kids who were just learning to skate, plowing into his body. Thankfully, Tony caught and steadied him before he could fall face-first into the lake and make a complete fool of himself.
Gritting his teeth behind his lips, Tony firmly nodded and when he was sure that he was out of Rogers’ view, he shot his best friend a highly-irritated face that practically screamed, “You’re not my parent,” but Rhodey blatantly ignored him.
“Mmm, sure, sweetheart,” Steve mumbled into Tony’s side as they realigned themselves to go back to cuddling. “You’re most likely right.”
“No.” Tony’s response was sharp and full of anger. “Two days ago when you tried to “speak to me alone,” you tried to smash your lips onto my face and then proceeded to grab and grope my ass! You should feel lucky that I haven’t reported this to anyone yet because if I had, by now you would’ve already been kicked out of the show!”
“May the rest of your evening be filled with happiness and commemoration of this unforgettable event! Thank you all again, for attending our celebration!”
Carnival lights and street-lamps below glimmered like stars and bathed the people and rides below in bright, white hazes of luminosity. The setting sun shone brilliantly ahead right onto the Ferris wheel and caused it to cast a shadow a-quarter-of-a-mile tall, draping over the pavement below it in a twisting pattern of light and dark spots. Thousands of people roamed beneath the couple, their faces blurred from the sheer distance between the top of the ride and the ground. Many more attractions formed stark silhouettes against the fiery sky as the sunlight streamed past each rollercoaster, The sunset-clouds and stars above seemed to be so close that Tony felt like he could literally reach up and touch them.
although you were never entitled to me in the first place. You’re everything I ever fucking wanted but just couldn’t keep, and you’re just so inconceivably perfect because you have every worthy part of me memorized, because every word that you utter makes me want you back even more than morally possible, because every mistake you make, you somehow fix to be better than it ever was before. And now that you’ve brought me
Steve’s senses ignited sparks inside of his chest and he felt his nerves numbing the rest of his body and only allowing him to focus on the sweet sensation that was taking over his lips. His eyelids instantly fluttered shut as their lips shifted against each other’s, sending another round of adrenaline-spikes shivering down his spine in a ghostly pattern that Steve undoubtedly knew he could get used to. The prince felt Tony relax under his grip and wrapped his arms around the genius’ neck, stroking the back of it in order to conciliate him further.
Throughout the couple’s countless dates, Steve was sure that this one has been, by far, the most perfect: Almost like a daydream.
He halted in front of a grand overhang of leaves and branches growing from an enormous tree right beside a miniature, glistening river. Vines creeped up its trunk, adding to the scenery and the wall of vegetation that Tony was presently peeking through.
“But I’m glad that you did because it helps me remember that you’ll always be with me through every shitty thing that life throws at me… and us.”
Tony exhaled, completely at ease despite knowing that there will be an inevitable ruckus awaiting them when they go back downstairs.
“Oh, shut up, you worry-bug.” Tony swatted playfully at Steve’s offering hand. “I’m fine, I told you. I guess I’m just worried about tomorrow night.”
, Steve wanted so badly to say but the words just got caught in the back of his throat and dissipated within the release of an unsteady breath.
“Why?” She asked straightforwardly, curious at what Steve had come up with in his head. “Why do you plan on kissing him instead of just instantly apologizing?”
His friend sighed and said, “Steve, you really know that you can’t keep doing this forever, right? I’m- We’re
“Thank you for that.” She nodded in appreciation. “That’s all I really needed to hear. That you’re still willing to put in everything you have and could possibly offer to prove that you still love him. That’s all I really wished to hear from you today.”
“Steve, Tony!” Sam yelled at the still-kissing couple who hadn’t moved from under the mistletoe. “It’s been ten minutes and you two are still smooching away! The movie’s about to start!”
“Alright then,” Pepper smiled as she closed his office’s door. “Good luck with the rest of them, I’ll be back in a few hours to check up on you.”
It just had to be pure luck that the annual traveling-carnival had just popped by in New York City and constructed its grand palace of lights and amusement rides within a huge section of land in the middle of Central Park. And Steve and Tony knew without question that this was their opportunity to take the rest of the week off before they had college to worry about again.
“Yeah, right,” Bucky snorted, “Like I’m ever going to accept that you are blatantly putting your health in danger and that you’re overworking yourself for the most pointless reasons ever.”
“Of course, Ms. Potts, take all the time that you need.” The cashier acceded, led them to a door in the back of the shop and unlocked it.
“Are you actually kidding me, Tones?” Rhodey said, just slightly ticked off. “Who knows when you’re finally going to pick your ass off of the floor and go and get a job again? I’m literally offering you one right now and you’re going to get paid really well for it too! Plus, most of your work time would be just cooking whatever you feel like and just giving it to Steve! You can literally experiment with all the recipes that you could ever come up with, in his kitchen and cook whatever the hell you want, too! Now, can you tell me how the hell could that ever sound like a bad idea?”
“Miss, would you mind if we used the back storage room to talk really quickly, please?” Pepper forced a minute smile.
Steve and Tony gave each other unsurprised looks as they continued to listen to the commotion coming from downstairs, aware that the Christmas tree decorating, which had previously been paused so that the team could watch Christmas movies together, — and was now resumed — hadn’t gone as planned.
A comforting silence settled between the two as the guests circled around them began to separate. The pair, unaware of their actions, simply stared into each other’s eyes until they were suddenly interrupted by the clapping that accompanied the King and Queen of Americandia arising onto the grand stage.
And Tony is pretty sure he smiled so hard at the blond that he could still feel the expression etched onto his face, a week later.
Sprinkled across the sky were the tiniest specks of stars, barely visible to the naked-eye. Barely any managed to peek through and shine their light bright enough against the radiance of the setting sun, but Tony admired how hard that they were trying. One particular star right above the couple’s heads, uncannily resembled and made the brunet think about his
Tony’s surprised eyes had been frozen on Rhodey’s face the entire time he had been talking and sighing, his best friend pressed on, “Please, Tones. You’ve been stuck in here for how long now? A week? You know what that does to your body; you know what happens when you don’t let yourself do your crazy experimenting shit in the kitchen after a while - you start to lose control of yourself! Pepper and I really don’t want to have to drag you out of one of those dumps that you plop yourself into, again. It hurts us enough to watch you mope around your apartment; imagine what it’s doing to you, and you don’t even realize it! And as weird as this is saying it but: you’ve got to let that freaky, nerdy chef side of you take over once in a while and just let yourself go crazy cooking! ‘Cause, believe me, it really works for you: it lets you to truly be yourself, and there’s nothing better than me or Pepper walking into a kitchen one day, to find you in there with a smile on your face.”
Next thing the brunet knew, Steve was leading him to the back of the carnival, away from the noise and the rides, and towards a set of hills in a random patch of Central Park that Tony had never bothered to learn the name of. When they finally reached the top of the tallest hill, the genius gasped in surprise as his eyes swept over the breathtaking scene before him.
. A little extra money for his effortless talents frankly seemed like too good of a deal not to take.
“Okay, okay! You win, for God’s sake, Steve,” the brunet laughed as he collapsed onto the snow while Steve gingerly scooted off of Tony to rest down next to his head.
Cursing himself for over-fretting, as usual, Tony reminded himself that it’s probably nothing that Steve’s super-soldier body couldn’t handle and that he was probably freaking out over nothing. But he couldn’t relax until he had solid proof in his hands that Steve was okay and not currently lying on the snow with a brain injury while simultaneously contracting multiple cases of memory loss.
“Absolutely,” Rhodey smiled at the couple and pretended not to notice their fingers beginning to lace within each other’s. “All sound good?”
How an Italian dessert could remind Steve of his mom, he didn’t have a damn clue but it wasn’t bad. Not at all. On the contrary, the intense espresso and coffee flavor of the treat tasted astonishingly similar to how his mother had liked her coffee in the mornings. The chocolate tasted a lot like her chocolate-cake recipe and the scent of vanilla made his heart skip a beat as he breathed it in, reminded of how Sarah Rogers always smelled like vanilla, no matter how long she’s been away from the kitchen. He and his mother almost never had enough money to purchase heavy cream like the one he could feel upon his tongue, and it was the smoothness and silkiness of it that made him almost choke on just the thought of how hard his mother used to work to be able to afford the exceptional, milky-sweet cream that Steve used to love having his birthday cake slathered in. Everything, as a whole and as its stand-alone tastes, felt like the sensations of being caring and thoughtful, and Steve instantaneously knew that whoever had made this cake had loved cooking almost as much as, or even maybe more than, his mother. After all, when Sarah Rogers didn’t have the money or time to go to Spain or France, or to some tropical location such as the Bahamas, she always did have the money and time to bake something sweet and remarkably mouthwatering for Steve to feast on. And it was always the smallest of details, and the sweetest of gestures, that really catapulted Steve’s brain right back to his treasured Ma,
“I refuse to leave, I refuse to just give up, because you’re here to at least consider giving me a chance.” He stomached down the sharp stabs occurring in his chest. “I refuse to leave; not when he never left me, not when he never gave up on me, not when he may still love me.”
“Ha!” Thor bellowed as he instantly reached for at least three cookies, all at once. “Luckily, I am a god, therefore my fingers don’t burn as easily as you mortals’ do.”
liked the chemical formulas of his vibrant, custom-made paints. Or the sturdiness and smoothness of his also custom-made color pencils. However, even those inventions were only his
Steve gestured to the carnival bursting with bright lights and life around them, “What do you think, Tony?”
“Hey, Tones,” Rhodey chuckled as he took in Tony’s in-awe face. “Yes, we finished the whole thing that quickly - you don’t have to ask.”
By the time Tony had noticed that he was already three-fourths done with his university experience, it had already been too late to enjoy it all properly. The best he could do was reminisce his past year with Steve and his band of crazy mis-fits that had immediately accepted the brunet as one of their own.
being too salty, or not fresh enough, or too slimy. Seeing the sight of two people outrightly enjoying his food was more than just a simple reassurance, it was a relief to the insecurities and anxiety that had been creeping into his stomach the minute Tony had stepped his first foot into Rogers’ penthouse. To be honest, the spectacle of such a clean plate was quite soothing to Tony.
It felt like Steve’s entire life had led up to this moment. The moment where fate would decide whether he deserved Tony back in his life or not. But he wouldn’t have had to go through this heart-rending situation if only he had stayed and listened to Tony on that day over a year ago. If only he had chosen his fate better back then, then maybe fate would’ve also chosen better for him now.
Taking a slow and heavy sip, he sighed, “They’ll be fine. They always are. We just have to wait for them to calm down.”
Relieved to be free from the tension and uneasiness that had crawled up his throat while he was talking to Rogers, Tony stopped in his tracks to stare at Steve Roger’s gigantic kitchen with wide-opened eyes. The only other kitchen that Tony had been in his entire life that was this spacious was Howard’s and not even Howard’s could have possibly been this high-tech.
“You do whatever you think is best, Pepper.” Steve acknowledged her, anxiety faintly beginning to overwhelm him as he thought about how Rhodey would react to him wanting to talk to Tony. “Again, thank you for even letting us into the tower.”
. In the past, Rhodey and Pepper had offered to pay him for the food that he always took the time to cook and bring over to them whenever they were too overly busy to make food for themselves, but he had politely declined them - they were his best friends; he was not going to let his
“Honestly, I’m not surprised,” the blond told the brunet who obviously wasn’t listening. “Not only are you an actual genius but you’re an amazing actor, too.”
“Exactly!” The blond clamped his mouth shut from his sudden outburst. “Damnit, I’m so sorry. It’s hard to control my voice when I’m talking about something that I’m really passionate about. But yeah, people should really read the book even if they’ve already seen the movie. They’re just missing out on so much from the book that never made it into the film.”
He heard the other laugh, and he knew very well that Steve had probably just read his mind according to the unmistakable shade of pink on his face.
“You do know that he blames himself, right?!” Pepper glared mercilessly at him. “Right now, he’s sitting on my couch, blaming
Nat didn’t take her eyes off of the TV screen and replied a swift, “The Polar Express,” before she put a bunch of her own popcorn that she was holding in her palm, into her mouth.
“Stay away from Tony.” Steve warned him, cold and calmly. “Step even ten fucking feet near him and every bone in your body will be reduced to ashes and dust before you can even process it and you’ll wake up in a full-body cast in the fucking hospital. Understood?”
“Yeah, but is this work really that important when it’s messing with both your sleep schedule and your eating habits? I swear that if you stepped on a scale right now it would start flying because of how much weight you’ve lost!”
“Pepper,” He mumbled. “You’re entirely right. You always have been and you always will be, but you’re not aware of what I’m trying to convey. I still love him, Pep.”
Right. It was Friday, April 10th. The day Steve was supposed to be going out with his friends to eat at their monthly restaurant of choice. It’s been a tradition ever since he was a kid but lately, Steve’s rarely had the time to even think about dinner.
“Steve, I never stopped loving you either. You’ve always been there to push me on through just plain, daily life. You might not realize it but in all of the time that we’ve been apart, all I could think about was how much you’ve ever done for me and how much you meant to me. All I could find my mind drifting to is just the way you smile to cheer me up, the way you pick me up after a fight with my... with Howard, the way you scoot over on your bed to give me room when I just didn’t want to go back to that bastard, the way you just fucking
nice dinner. You deserve a quality meal too, and you sure-as-hell haven’t had one in probably weeks, I’d say.”
“I’ve been living with you guys for 5 years now, Tony. I think I know how to be careful. Especially around those two.”
“So Steve, have you decided on that one move that you’re allowed to make?” Pepper cut in on his thoughts.
“Yeah. I was looking for LGBTQ+ books a few years back in high school and just happened to stumble upon this one. Ever since I finished it, it’s been one of my all-time favorite reads.”
The prince gaped at his friend, the dressed-up General of the Americandian Royal Guards, who was holding the hand of a lady that he almost didn’t recognize.
After hours of grueling research over fusion power, brainstorming the dynamics in creating an electromagnetic field, and redesigning pre-developed plans for a miniature arc reactor, Tony had eventually called it a day when his left hand started to twitch from being clenched up in a tight fist, for too long.
“I wish I could show you this guy that I’m talking about. He’s flawless — literally. He’s unrivaled throughout all of fucking S.H.I.E.L.D., he’s goddamn hot as all hell, undefeated in sparring and horseback-racing; he’s got the best manners out of anyone I know, including my own parents, and my parents are super-strictly professional. He’s the nicest human being that has ever existed on this planet; no, make that the entire fucking universe. His smile not only illuminates my entire fucking world, but I swear it could light up an entire kingdom brighter than the actual fucking sun.”
“But what if he doesn’t?” Steve murmured anxiously, mainly to himself. “What if he never notices me ever again and runs off to be with this other person or a guest from the masquerade-ball, tomorrow? What if he falls so hard in love with someone else that he’ll forget about my existence altogether?”
Perhaps this really was the best option for him and if all goes well, Tony’s life might seriously improve after cutting away all of his ties from his dad. What else could the brunet do as he tried to pick his whole life up? He can’t just sit around his apartment and keep waiting for his life to truly start again - to really break free from the boundaries that Howard had enforced onto him while he worked for his dad, he needed to work, he needed action… he needed a high-paying job.
By now, Tony had already turned around, facing the doorway to his kitchen but Rhodey knew for sure that he had been listening. Frankly, it was pretty had to get Tony to listen to him but if he just threw in the perfect words and formed it all into some kind of semi-emotional speech, he was almost guaranteed a positive response in favor of Tony’s own health.
that you keep running back to; he’s not going to protect you and you sure as hell know that he’s not on your side! Just because he treats you better than Howard doesn’t mean he’s a better person; he’s just as much of a con-man and asshole as Howard! Steve is really the best option that you can go for right now and hell, if you do decline, I bet you won’t stumble upon a job opportunity that’s twice as good as this in 10 years after today! He’s a trustworthy person, Tones; I know him personally and he has an incredible personality! And if he even dares to think of treating you like Howard does, I swear on my entire art studio that I’ll cover him in all of my clay, roll him into a ball, drop him off at the top of Mount Everest, and watch him roll all the way down to the bottom! I’ve got your back, Tones, and I’m trusting you here to make the right choice to actually improve your life from this stinky, sad situation that you’re currently stuck in. Don’t just do it for yourself, do it for me, do it for Pepper, - please. You know perfectly well that we can’t stand to watch you like this.”
“I know I left him that day, I know that I failed him and that I gave up on him, but that hasn’t stopped me from loving him with everything that I have. That hasn’t stopped me from regretting every step I took while leaving his house, that hasn’t stopped me from lamenting every breath I took while my head was still engulfed in exasperation during that day because I know, and have known for so incredibly long that…that if anything, he’s the one who should be annoyed at me for leaving. That he should be the one upset or the one to leave me. But he didn’t. At least he didn’t want to.”
As the rehearsal days sped by through the school year, Tony and Steve played their respective parts routinely but never got to actually kissing. The genius joked about it once but it only made Steve uneasy and suddenly, mortifyingly insecure.
“He really misses you, he really does. I know deep down that he still loves you, although he might not let you onto that at first because he’s still completely broken over the fact that you had just left him without any word whatsoever, but I assure you that he’s still over-the-moon in love with you — no matter how much Rhodey and I have tried to tell him to move on.”
“I’m sorry for getting so worked up over this, Steve. But have you seen yourself? You haven’t eaten a proper dinner in a week! And I highly doubt that your lunches
His only option right now was to cherish each second that he currently possessed and not let a moment of it go to waste.
And although the moment was passing quicker than the two of them were imagining, Steve fought his body's urge to become nauseous as he began to just grasp the realization that he had actually
, thought Steve as his heart ached with an unimaginable pain. Rejection. Disgust. There goes all of his chances.
“No worries, Steve. All you need to do is to hire someone, tell them what time you usually eat each meal, let them into your personal kitchen - if you’re okay with that, that is - or just tell them to cook your food at home, and sit back and watch your hot and steamy meals be delivered right to you every day. Also, let them know what types of food you like and I guarantee you that their food will be much more delicious than some leftover Mexican or Chinese.”
The redhead continued, “He’s hurt, too. You can see it in his eyes. They flash something unfixable every time he talks about you. I highly doubt anything you try will repair that gaping hole that you had left in his heart a year ago.”
Steve groaned at the mention of the nickname that Tony had given to him when they were children. The horrendous idea came together in Tony’s mind after a certain horse trodding by — that the previous Captain of the Royal Guards had been riding on — broke an icicle from a nearby rooftop, which fell on top of Steve’s head while the two of them were playing outside in the snow. Thankfully, he had only received a mild bruise that lasted a few days, but the humiliation that he had suffered through after the incident persisted on for over a month. Steve knew that Tony only called him that to get on his nerves, but the thought of the accident, even after all these years, was still able to bother him. Sometimes, Tony’s insanely-smart brain was a curse to all the kingdoms combined.
“Everything just feels right about him, Ma, Pa. I know this sounds foolish but he just fits so perfectly in my arms whenever I wrap them around him. He smells like my daydreams; filled with carnations and daises, and the fresh aroma of nature, and he looks like an absolute angel.” Steve breathed out. “Everything abut him is just so captivating, so astoundingly right; like he was made to fit into my embrace or made to be the perfect height for me to rest my head on top of his. It was like the universe created him flawlessly, just for me.”
I might one day transform this chapter into Steve's POV, but that probably won't happen for a while. In the mean time, here's the message that Tony sent Steve looking for:
but I have no idea what the other words mean. And quit panicking! Yes, I brought him some of your other foods like your cannoli and risotto and maybe yo—”
Tiberius Stone. Hell’s finest, and worst, spawn. The perfect person to interrupt his chance to be alone with Tony.
Sure, he could afford food for weeks and maybe even months to come, but that didn’t always mean he wanted 5-star meals for the rest of his life. Sometimes a nice inexpensive burger could really satisfy Steve’s cravings, especially after long hours holed up in his art studio. Speaking of which, a burger and some fries sounded really good to his appetite right about now.
An all-too familiar book jutted out an inch farther than its neighbors out of its shelf, catching Tony’s attention within a few seconds of arrival.
Strangely enough, the location of the book that he needed to find, was in the exact same spot that Steve and Tony had met and talked for the very first time. A pleasant aura washed over his body as he entered the enormous fiction-section of the library.
There was also the opportunity to use some actual good tools and technology to be able to finally make those recipes that he’s buried deep in his head because the tools that he’s needed to cook some of these highly-complicated foods were inaccessible to him. Tony’s never used a smart-fridge or an automatic pan stirrer with a timer before, although they were extremely unnecessary, he’s always dreamed of being to utilize the best types of tech for his most complex and intricate recipes. Curse his brain and its stupid fascination and love of technology.
Clint and Thor, along with Tony, perked up the most in their seats as Steve untangled himself from his boyfriend to get up and take out the Christmas-themed cookies that he had plopped into the oven about an hour ago.
And then the music stopped— finally, after the recommended time for Alexander and Eliza’s kiss ended way long ago, the pair eventually, and for Steve, reluctantly pulled apart.
The brunet smiled, his mind immediately thinking of the sweet-tasting fluff and all of the cavities that he would soon be getting.
“Hurry up, Tony!” Steve said as he hauled Tony across the carnival to ride the Ferris wheel. “I’ve got a surprise waiting for you at the very top.”
Rhodey grinned, “Yup. I couldn’t help myself. I had originally intended to leave it for dessert after dinner but…”
And with those final words, Steve entered the kitchen, scooped up the rag that had been left on the island, and immediately started helping Tony finish cleaning up the rest of the kitchen.
“Surprise,” Steve’s voice was brushed away by the whistling wind and overcome out by the echoes of the view below them, but he grinned warmheartedly, anyways.
Pepper handed out various chips and other snacks to Steve’s friends and left the room just as fast as she had arrived.
Or maybe… this feeling had always been there and Steve had just been burying it away in the back of his consciousness, trying to ignore it for years and more years to come until it finally grasped its chance to release itself.
Steve sighed and ultimately decided to shrug it off. Tony’s dealt with worse things and people than Ty and if he needed it, Steve would always come rushing over to defend him if he needed it. Hopefully, the genius knew this before he got himself in any serious trouble or off-stage drama with his ex.
His fear of rejection hadn’t caused Steve to be afraid of talking to Tony until he started noticing the brunet growing more and more distant with each passing day. Dreading the thought that Tony could be avoiding Steve because he found no interest in being his friend anymore, he began to distance himself from the other in return, hoping that if Tony really wanted to continue to stay by the blond’s side, he would come to Steve first.
And Steve, being the most-perfect human being to ever exist on this planet, had anticipated this and planned it all out — just for Tony.
All throughout high school, the blond just assumed that it was just some stupid crush but he knew for absolute certain that his crush was way too big so for some middle school fling. And after his first year of college, when he asked his other friends about whether or not it was normal for someone to feel this way, almost all of them confirmed that he was crazily—and idiotically—in love. Although, in Steve’s opinion, their brutally-honest assurance wasn’t really helpful in his desperate situation.
“You were, weren’t you?” His mother, Sarah, pried. “You’re so in love, Stevie, it’s both humorous and obnoxious at the same time. But in a good way, of course.”
“It’s alright, kiddos,” Tony smirked as he bent over to pat the kid’s head. “You guys can go back to ice-skating now. Just try not to knock over anyone in the process, sound good?”
“No, I think I’ve known you long enough to assure you that you’re quite an amazing and compelling person, and anyone would be extremely lucky to be able to date you.” Steve said.
Steve sighed as she left and glanced up at his computer screen to scan the remaining buyers that he still had to write a letter to. There were only 5 names left on the screen but considering at the speed that it takes for him to handwrite sincere letters that he was sure wouldn’t offend his patrons, it would take him more than just a few hours to finish them all. Consequently, that probably meant he would have to miss dinner. Again.
“Alright, fine.” The blond said with an amused expression on his face as he grabbed Tony’s hand and pulled him ever closer to him, until their chests were pressed against each other. “I love you.”
, he cooked his strips of pasta with salted water and a tablespoon of oil. Then he sliced the tomatoes thinly and evenly, with the expertise of a 5 star-chef, and covered the bottom of his pan with a layer of tomatoes slices. Then the layering began; the fresh pasta was laid on top of the tomatoes, a thin layer of
“What are you waiting for?” Bucky hissed in his ear as quietly as he could manage. “Just say that you’re going to apologize or something already!”
The genius grabbed Steve’s hand and hauled him through the leaves, undisturbed by the amount of plants that brushed past their bodies as they came to a stop in a clearing right under the shade of the giant tree. A small bridge sloped up and over the river that Steve had seen earlier, its metal railing glimmered with a fresh coat of midnight-black paint and it’s oak-wooden planks creaked under the pressure of their feet.
Inside his head, Tony facepalmed himself but somehow allowed his face to display the teasing smirk that his reaction was unconsciously urging on, “I’ve spoken one word, Mr. Rogers and it was literally just ‘Hi.’ If this is your definition of
He almost declined Roger’s request when he saw that the blond’s eyes were almost pleading him to agree so he caved in, “Alright,
Somehow the brunet knew that Rogers had requested to try one of the dishes that Tony had brought along with him and his head began to fill up with fears all based on the possibility that Rogers will actually start to hate his food. The cocky and confident part of him tried to calm him down; it was unlikely that Rogers would just randomly start to despise his food since almost everyone that’s ever tried something of Tony’s has immediately fallen in love with the flavors and taste of his recipes - but it was still a possibility.
Bucky chuckled and scratched the back of his head, “Seriously? Steve, c’mon, I know you’re busy and all, but you really have to get it together.”
“Alright, then. I’m lighting a medium-low fire for you and Captain Rogers right now. Have fun and Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to the two of you.”
The prince scowled but shrugged, trying to act friendly in front of the curious eyes of the many people beginning to crowd around him and his friends.
Whether or not Tony had heard his compliment would be forever unknown to Steve as the brunet abruptly started to hyperventilate.
“I miss him being there for me — after college, after going to the gym, after a god-awful day — I miss him being there, not to comfort me because he knows that I have boundaries, but to just lend me his presence because he knows that that’s what I need the most in the end. I miss everything about him, but it was just his simple
“Please — Just, promise me that if you’re feeling disappointed that you’ll hide it from me. And hide it well.” He pleaded desperately, his brown eyes full of distress. “Please. Just promise me.”
“Yeah, sure, you saps. Go cuddle on Steve’s nice, soft couch in Steve’s nice, cozy room while I get to deal with Sam and Bucky
was going to be one of his all-time favorite exotic desserts. But only when this certain person, Rhodey’s best friend, made it.
With his face twisted into a look of confusion, the brunet ventured down the hallway leading to some of the team members’ rooms — except he didn’t get very far because Steve stepped out from behind the wall of the doorway and stopped him.
“No, I’m perfectly fine with it,” Steve said as he grimaced at his own pathetic voice. “I guess I’m just nervous, I’m sorry.”
“It’s just… It’s just the confirmation; the knowing that he’s there, alongside me, without a doubt, that he’s there no matter what I’m going to drag him through, that’s what I miss the most about him. The fact that he was loyal to an infinite degree and that he would always be there when I turned around to look behind my back, or when I looked across from our cafeteria table, or when I reached around for him at night and felt his hand grip mine… He would always be there to help me. To… to give me every last bit of his love.”
The blond was, at this point, more than just convinced that he didn’t deserve someone like Tony. If even the whole cosmos didn’t deserve such a blessing of a person, to what degree did Steve deserve him?
It truthfully seemed like, to Steve, that every waking moment in middle school was spent with Tony, whether it was while eating lunch together out in the school’s courtyard or if it was while practicing for their shitty and dumb middle school plays that almost no one showed up to—almost every single happy memory that Steve could recall involved Tony in some way, shape, or form.
The biggest concern that kept pestering him was whether or not Steve Rogers would be a decent human being. But every time he tried to think about the most detestable outcomes that this occupation could bring him, - like what if Rogers was secretly a cannibal in disguise as an artist - his brain reminded himself of Rhodey’s words and he quickly shot himself down.
The nightclub or the bar nearby sounded really nice right about now. Maybe he should even go to the local Chinese restaurant to try some of their supposed “fantastic” cuisine.
What if Tony didn’t want the kiss to happen at all even if it was just part of the show? What if Steve randomly got sick right before the performance days and his understudy took over his role and when the kissing scene finally takes place, Tony falls in love with Steve’s understudy instead of him?
“Oh, Steven…” His mother cast him a dismayed expression. “Please have a little more confidence, darling — maybe he really is meant for you, and you just don’t realize it yet. Even if the two of you don’t work out, there are still plenty of fish left in the sea, honey.”
“I don’t know maybe,” the brunet shrugged as he shifted his body closer to Steve’s until they were basically pressed up against each other.
Come to think of it, Tony hadn’t read a full, proper novel written by an author who wasn’t an aerospace engineer or a quantum physicist, in years. Maybe he should check out a book while he was here - One that was actually worth his time to completely finish from the beginning to the end.
For now, he would go with happy, despite the rising dread currently developing and bubbling up in the pit of his stomach.
Abruptly, Steve realized that he may have just discovered his favorite flavor of anything ever created: Chocolate-hazelnut.
“Well, what am I going to do, Buck?” Steve exclaimed. “I’m still new to this business stuff, and more often than not, I have no clue what I’m fucking doing! Sure, I have Pepper but it all truly depends on me to keep this company running and stable enough to even bring food on the table! I have to keep working, can’t you see? I’ve got to keep learning and improving and once I’m able to run this company in my sleep, I’ll let myself enjoy a good meal.”
pounds is not ‘barely changed! Before you know it, your metabolism is going to fucking eat your entire body up!”
“He’s…” She stopped for a second. “There’s nothing you can do, Steve. Because you’ve already done enough — and look where he is now.”
“Thanks, Jar,” Tony sighed in relief as he carefully flopped onto the couch against his boyfriend’s comfortable shoulder with two cups of thankfully, untampered hot chocolate and handed the one with the Iron Man-themed mug to Steve.
“Yeah — Howard Stark — that’s my dad alright. But we never really got along as much as the media thought we did.” Tony explained. “Having a world-renown scientist as a father isn’t as fun as everyone thinks it is. It gets hard having to live up to his expectations every, single, fucking, day.”
Steve silently led the way to the nature-infused area that Tony had shown him earlier yesterday, neither person speaking a word as they walked alongside each other. Not long after, they arrived at their destination and carefully entered the placid, undisturbed hidden-hollow.
“Hey Steve,” Pepper momentarily stuck her head through a crack in the door. “I brought you something to increase your chances of winning him back. A peace offering, at most.”
“Sorry Tones, but I have no regrets because now I have the upper-hand,” Steve grinned as he began to mercilessly tickle the genius. “Now surrender.”
The gold-covered stranger tried not to acknowledge the blond’s kind words because he felt like he didn’t deserve it.
“I know and I’m so fucking sorry — I know you don’t feel the same way about me and I just want to apolo—“
After several minutes of devouring the whole damn thing and reminiscing his Ma, Steve finished the entire dessert and leaned back in his chair, satisfied and oddly feeling a little bit fuzzy inside. He twisted his face in both confusion and in contentment - it was so weirdly relieving that a simple meal was solely responsible for doing this to him. Who knew that a
The first part, the 11.8767%, would just be the chance of the blond never finding out about Tony's feelings for him at all.
Tony’s face scrunched up in annoyance and quickly casting a glance in Steve’s direction, he sighed reluctantly and stood up.
The couple collided together and went tumbling down, landing onto the soft snow with a subtle crunch under their bodies.
“Hurry up, Capsicle!” The genius shouted, directing his voice to Steve, who was right behind him. “It’s right outside of the castle gardens!”
“Good,” Tony said, flashing him a beam as bright as the sun. “‘Cause I intend on sticking with you for quite a while, so get used to it.”
The brunet almost punched the unexpectedly-attractive man in the face right at that moment. Tony was the only one allowed to call Rhodey “Rhodes;” who was this guy to call his best friend by such a close name and just who did he think he was?
“Uh,” the blond tugged at his dress shirt’s collar. “No, not yet, Pepper. And you know it’s not necessary to address me by that name, right? We’re friends after all, aren’t we?”
And with those final words to feed his unsettling guts, Pepper strode out of the conference chamber, her high heels clacking down the hallway towards the elevator before the sounds softly faded into a comfortable silence.
“Woah,” Tiberius sneered mischievously at Tony’s small but defensive form. “Chill, Tones. I just wanted to congratulate you on your
“Tony! Can’t you wait one second so I can at least finish my breakfast, first?” Steve complained while clutching his honey-biscuit and tried to act sour so Tony could slow down from his excited pace.
“I’m sorry,” Steve apologized in a bare whisper and he could feel Tony barely clutching onto consciousness in order to listen to him. “I guess I’m just nervous. I know how much this musical means to you—it’s your favorite, in fact—and I just don’t want to be the person who screws it all up.”
Heavenly was the only word Steve could use describe that very moment; filled with longing, yearning, adoration, and neglected love. Nothing on Earth could ever come close to the feeling that he experienced as his lips caught Tony’s in between his; the latter shuffling his hands through the other’s hair as they realigned their positions without separating themselves. His mouth captured Tony’s once more as he pressed their faces closer together, catching a startled gasp come out of the brunet’s parted lips before closing them once more. Coffee and lust flooded his senses, creating a perfect concoction of love and tenderness as their emotions were all singlehandedly captivated within the simple action of a kiss.
Every day that separated the two of them tore a hole in Steve’s heart and he could only reminiscence about the times when he and Tony would go to each other when they were seeking help but were too afraid or embarrassed to explain their problems to their parents — or when they just simply missed each other’s presence. When they were young, the two of them frequently found themselves sneaking into each other’s bedrooms at night just because one of them had experienced a nightmare. From stealing each other’s food and hijacking each other’s training-horses, the two of them were basically inseparable. However, it all started changing when the two of them were advised to start looking for potential spouses for when they inherited their respective kingdoms in the future.
Tony was honestly not expecting a handsome, giant hunk of a blond to come bounding towards the elevator like a giant golden retriever. The man’s hair glistened in the golden sun that shone through the window, his sharp, yet subtle jaw outlined the bottom of his face in an eager and pleasant smile, and he was wearing a dark-blue dress shirt with a black tie and a pair of black pants - a little overdressed for meeting your personal chef but Tony didn’t mind - the blond’s outfit wrapped his figure in all of the right places and his muscles were exposed where he had rolled up his sleeves. Tony
But when Tony slowly wandered back into the living room where Rhodey and Rogers were currently talking, his feet stopped as his eyes feasted on the sight of his best friend and his boss blissfully munching away at the remaining pieces of what used to be the
“Oh, yeah, right,” Steve nodded and looked back down at his desk. “Sorry, I forgot about them. I hope that they’re not bothering you too much. I’ll let you know when I’m done with these letters, Ms. Potts.”
The days after their meeting turned into weeks, and then those turned into months, and eventually, the months sped into a whole year of rambling to each other about their favorite books, movies, professors at MIT, historical artists, historical scientists, formulas for quantum mechanics, and basically about every possible subject under the sun.
“Wait, no — that’s literally impossible,” Steve muttered in-between kisses. “Because you’re this beautiful, everyday.”
“It means that I wasn’t a coward for wanting to go to a party. An incognito one, in fact; one where your face is covered up so no one will know who you are and thus, won’t be able to openly judge you.” Natasha fired back at the general. “Besides, have you seen all the royal guards who are actually attending and dancing without a care in the world? Why can’t you be more shameless like them, Ты идиот?”
this time!” Tony giggled as he ran back to the other side of the stage. “We don’t want a repeat of ‘Mr. I-Started-90’s-Dancing-In-The-Middle-Of-Hamilton,’ again!”
Steve found his voice shaking with a gut-wrenching combination of fear and heartbreak, “Yeah — okay, — I will.”
Holding a masquerade ball to celebrate the 45th anniversary of the amalgamation of all six original kingdoms into the land that is now known as S.H.I.E.L.D., had seemed like a bad choice to the young prince at first, but Steve soon found himself impatiently itching for the evening to arrive so he could finally find Tony and ask him to dance with him, without having to worry about the brunet thinking he was unworthy of being seen with him.
Clearly, Howard Stark would never be impressed by even his son’s best efforts to prove his worth to him — but the Massachusetts Institute of Technology would be — after he had presented his new project to his class.
“Steve, if you don’t want to kiss, that’s totally fine,” Tony told his best friend with an oddly pained-expression, without facing him, and Steve immediately felt guilty for pushing him away. “We don’t have to do anything that’ll make you uncomfortable.”
The two of them were supposed to rehearse the end of the “Satisfied” where it ended with Alexander and Eliza kissing but right at the end of Pepper’s performance of the song, Steve chickened out and ran outside into the auditorium’s parking lot where the sun was beginning to set, to catch his breath.
“I can’t believe it,” Tony confessed. “I-I’m fine, I just never thought in a million years—I honestly never even considered that they would ever cast me as the lead, this is—“
No amount of words could ever describe how euphoric this feeling was. Forget synonyms for amazing or nice; fuck trying to find the right words to properly express whatever was happening between the two, right now — there was only one word that fit this feeling, flawlessly — it was just fucking
With a final nod of his head in appreciation, Steve inhaled deeply and pushed his feet forward and dived into the maze of people.
Auditioning for the Columbia University’s unofficial version of Broadway-Backwards Hamilton and actually getting in wasn’t the hard part; the hard part was fighting to keep a straight face as Tony ranted on happily about how excited he was to be sharing the spotlight with Steve. However, the blond didn’t share the same enthusiasm because all throughout the rest of the day he kept having to remind himself that he and the brunet were just friends, despite how much Steve wanted them to be more.
“It’s just…” Steve suddenly discovered that he gravely needed to rant about the wonders about the New Ironinghamian prince and his insecurity about Tony’s emotions toward him, after bottling it up inside himself for far, too long.
True to his word, — as Bucky told him to: “stop moping around,” — Steve turned to the nearest lady, flashed her a heart-melting but professional smile, and began to waltz with her. Throughout the next few songs, he drifted through the flock of masked-attendees while constantly switching partners, and tried to disregard the many high-heeled shoes that accidentally stepped on top of his leather boots.
“Hey, doesn’t that cloud right above us, look like a heart? Or at least, I think so.” Tony said unexpectedly.
“Hey!” Bruce puffed, more irritated than he was angry — thankfully. “I like raisin-oatmeal cookies! Especially when Steve makes them.”
sauce went over it, shredded mozzarella was sprinkled on top, and then finally another layer of pasta covered the top of the dish. Tony repeated the layering process again until his layers nearly reached the rom of his pan, spread one thin layer of
“Yeah,” The unknown person — Golden, as Steve started calling him in his head — said. “That’s probably a good idea. I’d love to spend some more time with you, Mr. Americandian Hercules.”
He opened his mouth to articulate something valuable from the lump in his throat before swiftly shutting it, swallowing a bit of bile down.
“But I’m willing to try.” Steve harshly whispered, only loud enough for Pepper to hear his message. “I
“You dumbass,” Tony laughed softheartedly. “The truth is: I’m beginning to think that my dad was actually sort of right…”
Shoulders slumped, Steve struggled to brush aside his disheartened thoughts and turned to the person standing by his side.
“I got the lead.” Tony repeated to himself, under his breath. “Oh fuck, I actually get to play Hamilton.”
Finally, Steve and the brunet parted and the prince stopped in front of the stranger to regain his serenity and waited for the other to do the same.
Tony took in a deep, calming breath, and while feeling Steve’s eyes closely watching his every move, cracked open the front cover to “Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda,” and flipped to Page 273.
Once “Helpless” started to play, his palms started to sweat and the auditorium suddenly reached a hundred degrees. Ignoring both his heart and his brain pounding within his body, warning him about the catastrophe about to ignite, he forced his voice to start and gradually, the words flowed out of his mouth as smoothly as they did during rehearsal.
He licked his lips in thought as he took his first taste of Steve's gift, contemplating both his next words and the exquisiteness of the drink.
This guy was unbelievably cute when he stuttered. Tony innerly-squealed and congratulated himself on a flirting-well-done.
Steve just gave Tony’s blank face a knowing look as the genius blinked a couple of times as if he still hadn’t processed the information in his head yet.
