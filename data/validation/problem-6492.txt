"So, look, if you've got problems with this sort of thing, maybe you should come back in, like, twenty or thirty minutes—"
"Yeah?" Steve said, and Tony heard the note of challenge in his voice. "She tries anything like this again, I'll snap her neck. She does not lay one finger on you without your permission."
Tony hummed once again, and he nestled his face against Steve's palm, eyes closed and mouth formed into a small, delicate smile. Steve smiled in return at that, and he brushed the pad of his thumb against Tony's lips and said, "I'm going to take that as a 'yes.'"
"No! No, nothing like that!" Tony said, lest Steve think he was hemorrhaging or something equally awful. "Just… You said you wanted a boy. Are you disappointed?"
He shrugged again. "Not really, but it's no worse than the alternatives. The world wants to see Tony Stark, know what happened to Tony Stark, find out who this mysterious 'Natasha Carbonell' is. Let's give them what they want. I mean, granted, I'll have a
"Captain America is your daddy?" he asked slowly, less for her sake than for his own because… yeah, this was…this was not making sense in his head. Clearly Tony's feelings for the Cap were not as purely based in animosity as he was trying to tell himself, but...wasn't the Cap straight?
"Yeah, I know but I couldn't help but notice you were kind of half-hard when you got out of the bed, and I'm pretty sure I felt nine inches of
He scoffed and dropped the napkin. "Yeah, but it's hard to make a living off of that. There's a reason they're called 'starving artists.'"
"Don't you dare say that. You are nothing like Howard and no one thinks you are like Howard. He was not a good father and you are a great one, I never want to hear you say that about yourself."
"Until you decide not to come back. Until you decide to start a whole new life with your old pal Bucky and you leave me and Peter alone."
"Sam he almost DROWNED. And when we pulled him out of the water and we pulled his mask off I got flashbacks to that moment at the pool... seeing Ellie and seeing Tony crumble when he saw her laying there..."
The aliens had arrived and it was worse then anyone thought it was going to be. While Tony, Steve, Bruce, Natasha, Clint, Thor, Rhodey and Sam were all fighting Peter quickly slipped into his suit and followed.
Finally a loud thud gets everyone to stop telling at each other. Everyone turns to look at Thor, who looks beyond frustrated.
"Peter... EVERY MAN WHO WAS ABLE WAS GOING TO THE WAR. MY BEST FRIEND WAS GOING TO THE WAR. OUR COUNTRY NEEDED TROOPS AND I NEEDED TO HELP OUR COUNTRY. THE WORLD DOES NOT NEED SPIDER-MAN. THE WORLD DOES NOT NEED A 15 YEAR OLD BOY TO RISK HIS LIFE FOR NO REASON. Your sister never would have done something like this..." Steve sat down and put his head in his hands and Tony went to sit next to him.
It was a sight Tony would never forget. Worse than his parents dying, worse than almost dying in space, the sight of his little girl in her pink and green swimsuit, wet and motionless, broke him. He kneeled down on the ground, trying to get as close to her body as possible.
Steve took the pizzas out of Peters' hands and handed them over to Bruce, then carefully picked his son up bridal style and walked into the door being held open by Thor.
"Or that you would be on a mission with one of us, die and then your dad or myself or one of your uncles or your aunt would have to take the mask off and realize that it was you?"
“Tony, Darling please breathe. Tony take deep breaths. Tony, I didn’t mean to make you have a panic attack, I need you to look at me and breathe.”
“OBVIOUSLY IT WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH! YOU KNEW OUR DAUGHTER COULDN’T SWIM YET YOU LET HER TAKE THE SWIM TEST! YOU KNEW I ENTRUSTED ONE GUARD TO LOOK OUT FOR HER YET YOU DID NOT HAVE HER WATCH HER SWIM IN THE 10 FOOT DEEP POOL. YOU HIRED TEENAGERS WHO BESIDES THE ONE I ENTRUSTED COULD NOT HAVE CARED LESS FOR MY BABY AND NOW SHE IS GONE.” Tony stood up and screamed at the women, who was now visibly shaking in front of the billionaire. He then fell back to his knees, clutching his baby, his princess, his genius, his everything to his chest. Steve followed, hugging his husband and his daughter close to him.
"FUCK YOU NATASHA, NO WE WILL NOT TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOU LYING TO US ABOUT THE SAFETY OF OUR KID! HOW LONG DID YOU KNOW?"
Peter had never had a sleepover at Harry’s house before and was crying about missing his parents. Harry brought out the gift he had been waiting all day to give Peter, the stress ball he was holding now. Harry said “let’s try something! Let’s watch Harry Potter, and I’ll play with your hair and you play with your gift! Then maybe you won’t feel so nervous anymore!” Peter was unsure if this would work but Harry looked so eager that he nodded. Slowly he found himself calming down and eventually he was able to forget about his anxiety, at least for a little while”
"I said, Get, the fuck, out. Go. Both of you. Family doesn't lie, I know that after lying to Tony about Bucky. You lied about our son, A boy you claim is like a nephew to you. You knew for two months that if Spider-man ever got killed on a mission that we would not only be losing a team member, but our son. That is unforgivable. You are dismissed. Get your shit, get the fuck out of the tower, and go. Now."
“Tony I would never blame you. Peter didn’t drown honey... we are going to find him and everything will be ok.”
"Can you please explain why you won't let us do anything to make sure this doesn't happen anymore?" Dad says, clearly the calmer of the two yet clearly angered by the fact that someone is hurting his kid and that his kid won't let him fix.
Peter got up, knowing that his dad had officially been asleep for two hours and his pops would be awake for his run in an hour and a half, so now was his best chance. He grabbed his packed suitcase from under his bed and then put on his shoes and hoodie.
Peter hasn’t talked to him in a few years, not since Tony got into a fight with his dad. They used to be really close, (and Peter did use to have a small crush on him) so he hoped that now he would help him out. Peter walked up to his door, all of a sudden incredibly nervous and knocked.
2) Go to Wades, pretend you’ll stop being Spiderman so he lets you stay and doesn’t tell your parents
“Since our dads decided they want nothing to do with each other? It’s ok. It’s not like you had anything to do with it.” Harry tried to give Peter an encouraging smile but despite the years of not speaking, Peter knows him well and knew it was fake. “So what did you lie about anyway? You never lied to your dads. Even when I tried to get you to lie, you always said lying was wrong and told them the truth.”
Natasha and Hill smiled like that was exactly what they'd wanted to hear. And it must have been because once breakfast was all said and done, he found himself out shopping with them because he only had the one dress, and the deep burgundy probably wasn't the most ideal for a wedding. Or so they'd told him, anyway. He wasn't convinced. He'd looked fucking good in that dress, and wasn't that what counted?
Steve just closed his mouth and nodded, but evidently unwilling to let that be the end of it, he took a breath and said, "You know, Tony—"
made a choice of sorts between them, and though he and Barnes had history, and though he felt he owed it to Barnes to fix what had happened to him, Steve had chosen Tony.
Steve went to reach out to touch him but then pulled back at the last second like he had thought better of it. "You didn't give me a chance to—"
"Listen, you crazy, crazy man—" He let go of Tony's shoulders and cradled Tony's face in his hands, one hand delicately cupping either side of his jaw, his fingers curled behind his ears and his thumbs brushing Tony's cheekbones. "I— If I had to do it all over again — if Loki or some other crackpot sent me back in time tomorrow and gave me the choice to either crash that plane and spend seventy years in the ice or stay and live out the rest of my days in the era I thought I was supposed to, I'd climb right back into that plane without a backwards glance.
Tony rolled his eyes, and he thought about texting Natasha or Bruce to see what was going on back in New York, but he knew texting them at seven o'clock on a Saturday night was just asking for twenty questions about what was wrong and what was going on.
Sure. It was just that. It wasn't anything more sinister than that. Thankfully, he hadn't stuck around long enough to find out.
—" he again jerked his thumb at Steve, "—could knock me up because, evidently, to her, that's like the most magical thing that you could have happen to you if you're 'bonded.'"
"You? Which would be…pretty weird considering you were kind of a Capsicle when I built him — unless there's something to the whole 'bondmate' theory and your consciousness was somehow reaching through the ether to inspire me."
OK, he really didn't see Steve as the type to make a pact with any kind of religious cult — not even for
"Tony, I'm sorry," he said in that flat and even tone he used when he thought he was right about something and the other person was being unreasonable, "but Bucky's my friend. I— He found me. He searched for me—"
He allowed himself to relax into Steve's embrace, and he put his arms around him and closed his eyes.
"Just because you're old and crotchety and single and childless doesn't mean you have to rain on their parade," Natasha said, a hint of a tease in her voice.
"Because! Cartoons, Papa!" She grabbed his hand and tried to pull him out of the chair. "Quick! Cartoons are starting! I need my Wucky Charms."
"OK," he said and turned around to face her. "I'm gonna let you wear this one tonight." He held up a black shirt with a rainbow prism splashed over it. "Pink Floyd.
She just shrugged. "It's quite simple. If you end this life that grows inside you, you will end your own life. If you allow it to blossom and flourish, well, I think that goes unsaid."
Steve just gave a lazy smile in response, shrugging like he didn't have anything to say for himself, and Tony sighed and rolled his eyes and said, "Fine, whatever. I guess we don't have a choice."
Barnes's mouth fell open, and his eyes went owlish like he knew exactly what Tony was going to say. "Oh, god," he muttered.
"No," Rhodey said and folded his arms atop the table. "I know you. You'll check up on her, and you'll have her entire life story complete with bank account, credit card, and driver's license numbers all before I set one foot out of this place."
"I mean, my name did at least come up, right?" Jim continued, and Steve couldn't gauge if he was joking or if he really wanted to know that he'd at least been considered by Steve and Tony. He threw a look to Tony for guidance, but Tony almost looked like he'd been caught-out before he recovered and said, "Uh, yeah, obviously."
Tony snorted a laugh and took a sip of coffee. "Yeah?" he said after he'd swallowed the sip. "And who are you going to get to lead your Avengers B-team?"
Esmeralda inhaled a deep breath through her nose and drew her finger away from her lips. She folded her arms and drummed the fingers of her right hand against the upper part of her left arm, her long fingernails glittering in the light.
Bruce took a breath, and he opened and closed his mouth a few times before he said, "Tony, don't you think you're being a little hard on her?"
But Bruce had put the kibosh on that earlier, hadn't he? Oh, sure, it was supposed to be a secret, but he wasn't stupid, and neither was Steve. He still didn't understand what Bruce's aim had been this morning, though. Was he trying to dig the knife in a little deeper? Did he actually think he was
a vegetarian (or was at least claiming so today), so he and Steve made their way over to the Lower Level of Grand Central and settled in for a classic American dinner of burgers and fries. Steve loved this sort of fare. He was good about the fancy stuff — he'd had a crash-course of it back during the war — but Steve was a working-class Brooklyn boy at heart, and Steve loved nothing more than to stuff his face with a good burger and some fries and wash it down with a malted milkshake.
it — or he felt something, anyway. But it was just… It was getting harder to be sure of that — to be sure of what he thought he knew. Maybe Barton or whoever it was they'd talked to hadn't used the word 'dead,' but surely they would have given notice if they'd found Steve
Steve just smiled a little, a pink tinge flushing over his cheeks. "Um...yes?" At Tony's raised eyebrow, he added, "Well, I
"Yeah," he said and nodded, "some would. Tony would. Tony said I should have fought for more. I thought what they gave me was too much."
"When we got married? Sure. When we first started going out? Look, I'm going to be honest here. I was not expecting Captain Squeaky-Clean 1940s to be as much of a downright pervert when it comes to sex as it turns out he is."
"Oh," Bruce said, crossing the distance between them as Natasha stepped on the elevator and left for parts unknown. "You are up."
Steve made a 'hmm' sound and said, "From what I saw, we seem to do OK. At least for a little while."
"I was at an orgy. Once," Tony admitted before Steve could spiral any further down into his self- pity. "I mean it's not... I guess when you're young and horny it's kind of...exciting. I'm not— I wasn't—"
Steve nodded, and, palms sweating just a bit and heart racing a tad, he went to make the first move, but he'd never actually been the one to initiate a kiss before so he really didn't know what he was doing. Thankfully, Tony seemed aware of this, and he tipped his head and reached up to capture Steve's lips with his own. Steve let him, moving his arms around Tony's smaller frame, letting himself get caught up into it as he followed Tony's lead and hoped he wasn't embarrassing himself too much. If he was, Tony didn't say anything. Tony just moved so one hand cupped Steve's face while the other grasped his shoulder, their mouths met in slow, languid kisses that truly were the most intimate and wonderful thing Steve had ever done with anyone.
the way he was, and it was always so fucking hard to hide things from Steve because Steve read him so fucking well, but he just swallowed and schooled his face into something like annoyance and said, "Look, like I was telling Nutty over there, it's not the…
Steve just continued to rub, and Tony sucked in a breath and tried to tamp down that twinge of desire that always crept up whenever Steve touched him like that. They'd done enough the night before, thank you very much, and if Tony did anything like that this morning, chances are he'd be zonked out by the time the press conference rolled around that afternoon, and as Steve and the others had found out in the past, a pregnant Tony Stark woken from his afternoon nap was a
to him, someone to support him and needle him and tease him and love him — oh, god, did he love him. Someone that would — and did — pick up the pieces when Tony shattered, like when Jarvis and his parents had died in that awful wreck right before Christmas. For the first time in his life, Tony was alone, and not that he was that close with his parents in the first place, but at least he had them, and at least he had a family, however perfunctory it was.
God, the names he would have to live with from now on. Those stupid and sexist epithets — the ones that got Steve all riled up and got his jaw to do that thing it did where you just knew he was grinding his teeth down to the gums. Jesus, the 'Merchant of Death' tag was easier to live with than that. At least there had been some truth to that. Once upon a time. A little while ago.
Tony leaned forward a little, wincing at a tug of pain as he dropped the broken remote onto the coffee table. "J? What's going on? What's wrong?"
"Follow me," he said, and Tony and Steve left their seats and followed the clerk back to what they took to be his office. It was cluttered, and there wasn't much room to sit, but they moved aside and let him close the door anyway, and he went over to his desk and sat down at his computer and pulled up their application.
— they saw standing before them was actually the man that had spent the better part of several decades charming his way into their headlines and bylines. Because without Iron Man, Nick Fury would never have drafted him to fill out the ranks of the Avengers' roster, and without that, there probably would have been no means for him to end up with Steve.
"Besides," Hill said, and Tony shook his head at what he realized was a private moment he wasn't supposed to have witnessed and turned his attention toward her, "after SHIELD went down, what remained of Hydra fractured into several separate cells. The one that did this might not have had anything to do with the Winter Soldier."
Tony made a face. "Eh, not really feeling the 'Nate,' and, well…" He grimaced a little, hesitating before he said, "I don't know, maybe I'd like… Maybe I wouldn't be
(Why couldn't he have woken up there, in that universe, once again? Someplace where, if he wasn't exactly
Instead, he focused wholly on the situation — one he could control — at hand. He made to pull Tony’s jeans up for him, but Tony slapped his hands away, hissing as he pulled them up. He left them unbuttoned and unzipped, the tight material of the denim resting over his hips. There was no way he was getting them closed at that moment, and Steve thought about getting him off right then and there to spare him the agony, but he was pretty sure a responsible parent would tend to his child-in-need first.
"Nobody says that anymore, man," Barton said and shoveled another spoonful of cereal into his mouth, but Rhodey, who'd stayed quiet the last few moments, got up from his chair and stood in front of the couple.
Steve barked out a laugh a little more loudly than he might have liked, and he tightened his hold just a little bit on Olivia and pressed another candy cane shape into the dough.
Something flashed in Stark’s eyes, something fierce and something wanton, and Stark swallowed and drew himself up to his full height — several inches below Steve’s, but he had to give the guy credit for trying — and said, “And what might you be insinuating by that?”
was hoping for a girl — for one girl in particular? See if Tony was still attached to that little ball of fire that had been taken from him much too quickly?
Steve nodded and said, "Yeah," and Tony shrugged and said, "Whatever," and Bruce and the doctor repositioned the monitor some so that Steve and Tony could better see it. Steve stared at the screen, eyes narrowed, jaw set, mouth pursed into a flat line, almost the way he looked whenever he took in any piece of information he didn't quite understand, and Bruce said, "It's just a sonogram, Steve. It's not aerial photographs of a Hydra base in Sokovia or something."
"...you know Pete, we haven't made cookies in a really long time and we used to always make them on the 12th. Maybe we can do something else?"
"I know honey, trust me, it's hurting me just as much as it's hurting you. But we can't give in, not unless he asks us to. We need to try to stay strong and stick it out the last few days."
Peter didn’t even realize he had been crying until his aunt wiped a tear away from his eye. “I really helped save my dads?”
"But Pops, I've never been to Costa Rica! Dad owns a mansion there so I can just stay in the mansion while you guys enjoy yourselves. Please, please don't leave me alone here." Peter knows it's going to hurt his Pops a little but he does his puppy dog eyes, hoping they will work.
He smiled his small smile, his green eyes always looking like he was half awake. His black hair was longer than Peter remembered it being, it was nice and wavy just like he remembered though.
"YOU ALMOST DROWNED RIGHT IN FRONT OF US! DO YOU NOT REALIZE HOW AWFUL THAT IS? HOW FUCKING HORRIBLE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO SEE OUR ONLY LIVING CHILD DIE THE SAME WAY AS OUR FIRST DID? DO YOU NOT REALIZE THAT IF YOU HAD DIED TONIGHT..."
Tony, Natasha, Clint, Peter, Bruce and Thor (who were both just silently watching the whole thing) turned to look at Steve.
"Don't worry Pete, I've got stuff to do anyway. Stay safe and text me with all the gory, badass details from the fight, ok?"
Peter had been in school for two months and things were fine. Yet ever since the other day, it was his home life that seemed weird.
Clint not allowing Peter to climb in the air ducts with him and not teaching him how to shoot arrows because “That was Ellie’s now and I think you would just break it Pete”
Everyone is silent, when finally Nat decides she’s not going to sit around and get bullied into silence.
At first these types of outbursts startled Peter but he had gotten used to the boxes a long time ago.
"Steve this is one of the top science schools in the country and Peter went here last year. He will be attending it again."
"Peter, keeping all these secrets from your parents is wrong, you really need to start being honest with them."
Steve sighed, realizing he wasn't winning this battle and joined in on the eating of the icing. They had to go buy some more later that day to finish the cookies.
"That's it, sitting here waiting isn't working. Why don't Tony and I fly around to look for him while you guys wait here and see if he shows up" Rhodey suggested, knowing that if they didn't find Peter soon his best friend was going to have a panic attack."
The last one in the box is another frame with two pictures. The picture of Ellie is of her running towards the water with an America swimsuit on. That was probably the only time she ever got in trouble, Steve and Tony told her that if she ran towards the water again without them then they would go home immediately. The picture of Peter is him learning to swim a bit after Ellie died.
“God I feel like such an asshole, I can’t believe the writer made me say all that bullshit...” Wade muttered as he went back inside his apartment, feeling pretty horrible about himself.
“I went in there to check on him and his bed was empty and some of his clothes are missing and... our son is gone Tony!”
“Be careful, she made me that frame when she was 4. We were doing crafts together and she decorated this frame. She said so I could have “a pretty frame for a pretty picture”. I pulled out my camera and took one of her. You can’t see it in the picture but her hands were covered in glue and glitter.” Natasha smiled to herself, thinking about that day. “I developed the picture that day and when the frame was dry I put the picture in, I told Ellie that the pretty frame deserved a picture of the prettiest little girl.”
"I think you forgot to invite me! I'm hurt, really." Peter heard someone say, a voice he knew all too well.
Peter swung off before his Dad could respond, hoping he would make it home before his Pops and the rest of his family, or before his dad came out of the lab to check on him and Ned.
"Aunt Tasha I can't be completely honest when I know all my freedom will be lost if I am. Look can we please talk about this later? I'm trying not to think about my parents."
“Captain Rogers, I assure you that the lifeguards did the very best they could…” Ms. Rida tried to explain, hoping the fear she was currently feeling was not too apparent.
"So Spider-guy, do you want to come back to the tower with us?" Clint said, wincing at the pain in his ankle.
Clint froze, he looked over at Natasha who currently had a poker face on but he could see the fear that was now in her eyes.
Peter was the one to run out of the room to get one of his uncles or his aunt, even at three he knew that his two daddies crying on the floor meant things were not ok. He ran into the training room, even though he knew he wasn’t allowed to go in there and grabbed his aunties leg.
Peter just looked down at his feet and grabbed a napkin, wiping his face. "Flash is the fucking worst" he muttered while he'd just apologized and agreed quietly.
“Steve that was one of the most heartfelt apologies I have heard in quite some time, which is a good thing considering how much of a douche you just were. We will discuss this later but right now we need to go learn about our kids' whereabouts.”
Steve hadn’t realized that for 12 years his family had been comparing his son to his sister, and that for 12 years Peter just let them continue to hurt him by doing so. Steve had never felt like such a horrible parent. Deciding that instead of a run he was going to spend the day trying to show his son that he appreciated and cared for him, Steve walked into his sons room.
As Steve went for his 5 am jog he thought about his life. Steve never imagined his life would be like this. He never dreamed that he would be living with his husband, Howard Starks genius son Tony, in the year 2023, with a nine-year-old daughter and a three-year-old son. He thought his life would be more tragic, more lonely. Instead, he managed to marry the most beautiful and amazing man and create two of the best children in the world, modern technology making it so that Tony and Steve were able to use both of their DNA to create children.
Just as he starts doing them his dad walks in with Natasha. "Alright Stevie, we bought everything Pete will need to survive for a week without us and I found this really sexy American flag swim suit that will make your ass look..."
“You’ve had a long day. How about you grab the air mattress from the closet, I order us some Thai food and then you sleep, ok?”
"Um, he only really hit me in the eye, he shoved me to the ground and down a few steps so I know I probably bruised a rib or two and my elbows. Besides that I'm fine. Really Dad's, I swear."
“Tony, what were you dreaming about?” Steve said softly, sitting down and gently pulling his husbands' hands away from his face.
"I'm sure young Peter just hasn't looked at a clock yet, he must return at some point," Thor said with semi confidence. He said the same thing when it hit 11, and then again at 12.
Peter watched as one of the aliens attacked his pops and his dad went to go save him, not realizing that three more were about to attack him.
Sorry I have been gone for so long! I hope you don’t hate this chapter! I used google translate for the Russian so if it is wrong I’m sorry. I promise this story is not abandoned, I just didn’t have time and I didn’t know how I wanted to approach from here. I know how I want it to end but I have to get there first. We are not near the end at all so if you are enjoying this story then just know it’s not over yet! Again, sorry for the wait and I wrote this at 1:00 am so I might have to edit it later.
Natasha couldn’t mask her feelings when it came to this picture. She tried to keep her face straight but the tears in her eyes showed her true feelings.
"Wow, that's been whole years worth of lego building, I'm impressed." Peter said while unwrapping his muffin.
"Sweetie I'm sure everyone will love whatever cookies you pick for them, just please stop eating all the icing," Steve said with a roll of his eyes. "That goes for you and Peter to Tony."
After getting ready for bed Peter laid on his bed and touched his lips, falling asleep with a small smile on his face.
"I completely understand. I promise that I won't bring Bucky here and that I'll never lie to you again. Sweetheart all I want to do is make this right and I'll do my best to gain your complete trust once again."
"Exactly. So fine, go on your trip but don't act like I'm being unreasonable when we both know out of the two of us you are the possessive, jealous and unreasonable one. I'm going to my lab, I'll send Peter up to say goodbye and I'll see you in a week." Steve reached out to grab Tony's hand but he walked away and towards his lab. Steve sighed once again and waited for his son to come upstairs.
Peter ignored the shouts and continued to fight, swinging onto one of the ships. The aliens, unfortunately, saw this coming and while Peter fought two of them, another drove the ship towards the lake they were fighting near. The aliens pushed Peter off the ship, and while he tried to   Use his webs, he realized he had run out.
"True," Tony chuckles slightly, "but just because I occasionally choose to ignore mine doesn't mean we are going to ignore yours."
"Sorry, Pete didn't see you there!" Tony walks over and gives Peter a kiss on his forehead, laughing when he sees the slight look of disgust on Peters' face and the blush on Steve's.
Natasha giving up on teaching Peter Russian because he wasn’t picking it up very easily “Ellie could speak full sentences in Russian in two weeks!”
"Yea yea shut up Tones. I'll make us some lunch and be back down in a little bit. Don't over think it and don't over work yourself."
Tony got up and grabbed his phone out of his pocket, quickly calling the dean of Peters school and walking away once she picked up. Steve decided to simply pick his son up bridal style and carry him down to the living room.
Steve looked at him for a moment before pulling him around the waist into a kiss, "Thank you" he whispered.
"Honey bear, I'm sorry but I can't. If I leave I'm going to have to face my husband, who I feel like I have failed and my son who has almost died multiple times in the past few months because he is a superhero, and he was too scared to tell us. He didn't trust me. I can't... I can't face them yet. I know Peter is going to try to take his suit back so I'm just going to continue working on it, making it the safest fucking super suit anyone has ever seen. That's all I want to do."
"Alright, I know when I'm needed but not wanted." Wade said, winking at Peter (which thankfully no one noticed) and then he was gone out the window.
Steve grabbed his bags and left, Peter watched until the door closed then sighed and walked back downstairs, disappointed but not surprised.
So Peter remained in his Pops arms, with his Dad sitting next to him, eating pizza and laughing with the rest of his family. Relieved that for now, he had still managed to keep his secret safe.
Sam opened his mouth to say something but chose to keep his mouth shut instead. Clearly Steve was not ready to forgive them, and nothing he said was going to change that. Sam just hoped that Steve and Tony had a change of heart before they lost their son.
"While I no doubt our friend with the eye of the hawk would be a fine and capable leader," Thor began before he nodded toward Steve, "my loyalty is now and always shall be toward our Captain. And his beloved bonded."
She nodded. "I shall return your form to the way it was when I first came upon you that day in the rubble."
"And you're right," Tony continued. "We're not just… We're family. We're fucking in-laws. And I mean even if we weren't, I think we moved beyond just being casual acquaintances when you held my leg back so I could literally expel a human being out into the world."
"I am, Steve," he said and pushed his chair back to stand up. "You know I'd follow you anywhere," he added and stepped around the table. He clapped Steve on the shoulder and continued, and Tony couldn't tell if he was disappointed or relieved, "But I don't think I'm ready to be an Avenger yet."
"Trust me," Steve said when he realized Tony was hesitant in his steps. "I'm not gonna let you fall."
"That was a good six or seven hours ago, Tony," Bruce said because he was a sniveling do- gooder that liked to see him suffer. "I wouldn't turn down a slice."
"I know. I wouldn't have thought it, either. I can handle it, I think — I mean being in the same room with it — but I'm not sure I could get a slice down without upchucking it right back up."
the strangest thing to happen to you. God, I could tell you so much, but you made me promise not to say anything more than I had to."
"He's not out yet," Natasha said. "And I don't think you can deport natural-born American citizens."
Tony just held Natasha's gaze, and she winked at him and said, "Something like that. So, Steve did his homework?"
Deep breaths. Deep breaths. In. Out. In. Out. He wasn't there. He wasn't trapped on the wrong side of a wormhole. He was in his penthouse, in his tower, in New York, in the year 2012. He was currently cuddling with an alternate universe daughter from the future, but other than that, there was nothing odd about the situation. He was fine. He was OK. He couldn't panic. Not here. Not now.
"Painting a room upstairs," Steve said and motioned in the general direction of the room. "Tony wants to use it for an office—"
Barton glared at Steve with his murder face then turned to the others and said, "You know if it's ever a choice between us and the princess, it's always going to be the princess, right?"
"No!" Tony said. "No, it is. It's goddamned awful. Hawkeye collectibles? Really? First of all, she's too damned young. She'd choke on the pieces. Second, it's not my fault he bought up a couple pallets of the damned things and now he can't even give them away. Iron Man flies off the shelves for a reason."
Tony just shook his head and buried his face in his hands, his elbows braced on his knees. "I can't believe this is happening."
"A series of tubes," Tony said in all seriousness, but when Steve nodded his forced understanding, Tony said, "I'm bullshitting you. It's— Yeah, OK, that one's kind of dated. It's…"
Steve made some disinterested motions with his hand, mumbling something kind of incomprehensible, but knew he was deflecting and really did want part of the sandwich, and he rolled his eyes and held it out to him.
He actually wasn't ready until quarter-after-six, dressed in the most chic and sophisticated maternity wear his ill-gotten gains could buy, a splash of makeup on his face (he really,
Tony hummed and said, "Delectable," as he turned his head and brushed his lips against the slight scruff of Steve's unshaven cheek. He mouthed at Steve's cheek a moment, darting the tip of his tongue out to touch at the skin, before he turned his head once again so they were pressed cheek- to-cheek.
"It's because if we call it 'fucking' it devalues it. It doesn't mean as much. I think in his mind, anyone can
He snorted a laugh. "Yeah, well, not with Pep as SI's CEO. She lives to remind me of shit and make my life miserable."
Whatever. He stuck the glasses back on, and Steve laughed and snagged an arm around his shoulders to pull him into a half-embrace and said, "Ah, Nattie, don't be such a sourpuss."
He grimaced and hedged, whining a little as he tried to decide between orange juice Steve had probably backwashed into and his own breast milk. He glanced back at the sink and though about dumping some water over it, but that would probably just turn it into a flavorless paste. The orange juice at least had flavor, and the milk was at least sweet. Either one would make the particleboard fragments that made up the muesli much more palatable. He could eat it dry, but then, he could also eat a bowl of drywall screws dry, too.
"No," he said and looked at her. "Don't hide it from him— her— whatever the hell he is. He deserves to know." He turned back to Tony. "They were in a building. Steve was there. Building came crashing down."
" he breathed out and pressed his head back against the pillow, curling his fingers into the sheets and squirming as Steve held him wide open and used his mouth on him in the most
But did he have to so blatantly ignore the life that was sitting right next to him in order to do that?
"Oh, I don't know. Maybe the way that you were ready, willing, and able to reorganize your life around her after
to the other people at the table, all of whom seem to think I shouldn't be so cocky about the fact that I'm
Steve bit his lip, and it looked like he was trying to figure out how to choose his words very carefully as he said, "What exactly do you plan on wearing?"
"Meaning he did curse out the players," Barnes said. "Kicked the seat, almost broke his foot, threatened never to attend another Dodgers game in his life—"
"Even if it means giving Hydra, AIM, our own fucking government, and god knows who else more reason to snatch us up and milk you for all the baby batter they can get out of you before using it on me and a number of other as-yet-to-be-determined volunteers?"
The girl at the desk looked at her computer screen and said, "OK, Ms. Carbonell—" She reached over and picked up a series of papers attached to a clipboard. "If you could just fill these out—"
"Six-one," Steve said, flat and with just a little bit of smugness. "Maybe there's a little more than five inches between us."
Tony slid his hands down Steve's torso and put his arms around his waist, and resting his head against Steve's pecs now, he turned in the loose embrace and said, "No one said you two had to eat breakfast here."
"Whatever," he muttered while the nurse laughed a little and motioned for them to follow her into the exam room.
"Why not? I just assumed it was an open secret— And 'secret' isn't really the right word because I'm not trying to keep it from anybody. I just never went blabbing about it. Anyway, I sort of… It's very…"
Tony nodded again, slow as the last time, and said, "OK. OK, we've got other things to deal with at the moment, but we're definitely going to talk about this later."
"Yes," he said and scooped the baby back into his arms. "I do. Incidentally, how did you manage that?"
Honestly, even Steve didn't know. He had a feeling, and he was pretty sure Bucky was smitten with her — Buck had always had a thing for redheads — but he was also pretty sure that Bucky hadn't breathed a word of it to anyone.
Whatever it was, if he was being honest with himself, it had given him just the tiniest glimmer of hope that he couldn't even admit to himself let alone anyone else.
Tony didn't have an answer, and he just shook his head a little and said, "She's probably not even mine, anyway."
"Oh, yeah," Bruce said with a slight laugh. "Nat helped you get dressed for last night, didn't she?"
"You must accept that you will never be rid of the Chancellor," she spoke, slowly, perhaps her accent and her native tongue making the vowels and consonants have difficulty tripping over her tongue. "He is the King's beloved. You know even better than I do that the Archbishop secretly united them in the sacred bonds of matrimony, and those are not so easily broken."
" he yelled, encased in complete darkness, as he began to fall from the sky. He couldn't move anything, couldn't see anything, and the most he could do was calculations in his head as he tried to figure out how far up he was, plus the rate of acceleration, to figure out how hard and how fast he would hit the—
He reached down and fisted both their cocks in his hand, and Steve keened high in the back of his throat, and Tony chuckled a little and murmured, "I guess it has been a long time for you, hasn't it?"
Tony tapped the microphone. "Uh, is this thing on?" he asked, only to be rewarded with a little bit of feedback. "Yes, I'm Tony Stark."
) because society said that was what a woman did if she wanted to fit in, and much as he liked and wanted to march to the beat of his own drummer, he wanted to fit in as well and had wanted to fit in, well, pretty much since he'd found himself thrown in with classmates several years older than he. He'd acted older to fit in with them and he'd acted more feminine to match the physical attributes he displayed. No, it wasn't fair and it didn't make sense and it wasn't even something he'd consciously done. And to that, he really wasn't sure what it said about himself.
"Hey, I'll have you know our shift has the best safety rating going three years in a row," Bucky said. "And no, Clint's working for some other security firm."
done a stupid fucking job of this whole thing. If the entire purpose of life on this earth was to keep making more of the species, then Mother Nature should have figured out a fucking way not to make the grand finale of it so goddamned
Bruce nodded and twirled a string of melted cheese around his finger as Olivia clambered up onto one of the chairs and held a plate out to Tony.
"First time for everything," Steve said and tucked her back into his arm. "You really don't like formula, do you, kiddo? Well, I'm sorry, sweetie, but Mama's not producing the good stuff anymore. You're just going to have to get used to it."
Tony let that sink in a moment before he drew a conclusion, and his eyes went wide and he opened his mouth to blather about it, but Pepper slapped a hand over his mouth and simply said a knowing, "
Rhodey just blinked at her, and he looked between her, then Steve and Tony, then Jane and Thor, then back to an innocent-looking Darcy before he shook his head and said, "I'm out," and walked away, leaving Darcy to beam like an undefeated champion in his wake.
"I'm not finished!" He ran a frustrated hand through his wet hair. "I can't do this again. I can't do this unless I
"Well," she said and blinked, face contorted into slight confusion, "because. I've not made the acquaintance of many of your kind in my time, which is such a shame. You're such fascinating creatures, and you bond the same as those of the other realms. You just aren't as aware of it. And you—" She put her arms out in a broad and opening gesture as though to encompass both Steve and Tony. "Well, you've got the strongest bond I've ever come across — perhaps in the whole galaxy."
God, this whole 'limiting his coffee intake for the sake of his unborn child' thing had better have been worth it in the end. What was worse? Herbal tea-shit or decaf coffee?
Olivia — would grow to adore her 'Unca Bucky' and 'Anna Tasha' as much as the other Olivia quite obviously had.
Bruce just shot Tony a questioning look, and Tony nodded and said, "Yes, this is what I live with every day of my life."
Tony hummed out a thought. "So, you're saying I'm the one that always gets knocked up. I mean, in our past…encounters — me and Steve. In our past encounters, I'm the one that gets knocked up and Steve does the knocking up."
He'd fought against it for so long, denied it for so long, and wished it away for so long, but it couldn't be ignored any longer. This
Europe, though? No, we're in New York, where it is perfectly acceptable to cut and switch. Don't think you have one-up on me, old man. I was taking lessons in etiquette while you were taking your comfy ice nap."
Steve just stared at the bit of gold in the middle of his hand, and he sat away from the baby and set the bottle down on the table. "I'd wondered what had happened to that," he murmured and reached out to take the ring from Tony's hand.
“Hmm…” Tony said, rubbing his hands up and down Steve’s arms. “I think we may need to do something about that.”
Yeah, sure, it was easier for someone like Steve nowadays. He didn't have to worry about stealing a quick one with some man in a back alley before he got caught by the cops — or worse — but Steve had also admitted that he had wanted to get married and he'd wanted a family. Maybe Steve was more turned on by the idea of sucking brain or having some fella suck brain for him, but Steve was also not above lying to himself. Steve would gladly try to convince himself 'til his dying day that he didn't want some man's cock in his mouth or he didn't want to shove his cock into some other guy's ass. Steve was that self-sacrificing type that would tell himself that he was perfectly happy with his little wife and his two-point-five kids and the dog and the little house with the white picket fence and—
Steve's face fell. "No, Tony," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "Of course not. We'll find a way. I promise. We'll find a way." He glanced to Thor. "We start by contacting this Esmeralda. We see if she responds to reason."
"Hmm… You know, if we're going to do this whole 'leave' thing," he said as he watched Steve get changed, "I may have to institute mandatory shirtlessness."
Steve glanced back at him from where he stood at the set looking for the antenna. "FM? What's that?" He pointed to the set. "Doesn't this have an antenna?"
He stared at them a few more moments, trying to place where he'd come across this photograph before, staring at their faces as though they could give them the answers, and out of the corner of his eye, he spotted Ella, a funny look on her face as she glanced between the portrait on the wall and Tony, like she saw something there. Tony turned and was about to ask her what she was thinking of, but she shook her head as though to clear her mind of the thought and gave her attendees a broad smile.
Steve nodded as well, and he looked down and watched the baby slurp her bottle a moment before he said, "You're not the only one that kept it from me."
Natasha just blinked at him, and she pursed her lips a little and sat down beside him. "What happened, Tony?" she asked and rubbed his shoulders some, as though she was trying to ease out the tension and turn him into easily-manipulated putty.
"You forgot the part where I'm not the oh-so-wonderful Howard," he muttered and began to swipe at screens without bothering to really read what was on them.
degradingly sexist our media was," he said then glanced over to where Barnes, an apron over his torso and a glowering look on his face, stood at the stove and insisted one more time, "I can't
If this was what that other Steve Rogers was like, and if the other Tony Stark was anything like him, then there was no question in his mind how that other Tony had fallen in love with that other Steve. Because, if he was being perfectly honest with himself, he…was kind of in love with
This isn't about me not being able to fulfill my duties as Iron Man. I almost got crushed through no fault of my own—"
"We're still working out the kinks," Tony said. "OK anyway, uh—" he blew out a breath that sounded like a raspberry, "—our story. Uh— I mean, it's not really that unusual. The standard, you know. Crazy space goddess turns you into a woman for her own amusement because she's delusional as well as crazy and, well, we're the assholes that forgot to use a condom."
Even Barnes got into it, even if most of his posts seemed to be vaguely insulting allusions to Wilson and what he kept insisting was his love of all things avian. Mixed in with positive posts dutifully tagged #LadyLiberty were photoshops of Wilson and his bird friends in the park, Wilson in a bird costume, Wilson hanging out with Big Bird (with hashtag #BFFs), and Wilson flying in the air and leading a flock of geese.
Steve stroked his fingers over the baby's head a few more times then reached up and kissed Tony's cheek. "You're amazing," he murmured. "I could never do this."
Tony pointed at the sheet of paper. "Look what they're asking about! That's— What— How— I mean, is it
Tony set the cups down on the coffee table. Steve figured it was a distraction — who cared about something like that when a fight was about to break out? — and glanced around for any Hydra goons about to make their appearance.
Steve exhaled a laugh and shook his head a little, but he crowded into Tony's space some, and he slid his hand off his abdomen to wrap an arm around his torso and nuzzled his face into his neck, murmuring out, "Tony, you're
it was to smile and how much prettier women — and thereby even girl!Tony Stark — were when they did so. He tsked a little and shook his head, the coffee carafe in hand as he went from Avenger to Avenger, pouring them each a cup of the good stuff.
"Enough," Bruce said, watching rather stringently as the tube filled with blood. Once it was filled, he pulled it off and grabbed the next tube. He snapped it on, and Tony watched as that one began to fill as well. After a few quiet moments, Bruce said in a low and somewhat unsure voice, "So, you want a boy, huh?"
Steve just hummed in agreement. "A lot of burglaries. A lot of break-ins. All kinds of stolen merchandise. It's going to take the city a while to clean up from that."
"I'm going to fist you tonight," she purred, her tone like smooth, liquid gold. "Would you like that, baby? Would you like me to fist you? You've been after me to do it for a while now."
He groaned and dragged his hands down his face, which was kind of awkward to do when he had the phone in one hand, and he took a breath and squared his shoulders and went back into the living room. He'd figure it out, but not right then. Cap wasn't due back for a week. He had time to figure it out.
than it actually is. I would say 'What the fuck, Mother Nature?' but I'm about ninety percent sure now there
"I'm fine, Steve," he said and braced one hand on the arm of the couch and the other on Steve's leg to get the leverage he needed to get up. "I'm just a little tired. I'm going to go lay down. Have fun reminiscing with your pal."
He looked so proud at that, so smug, like he'd uttered the absolutely most perfect insult that could ever be leveled at anyone or anything, and Tony almost burst into laughter at the realization that Captain America was an absolute
"Philistine," he muttered but took a gulp of the beverage. He set the glass down then cut into his chicken. He switched hands to shove the piece in his mouth, Steve watching him with a pointed smirk, and he rolled his eyes and said around the mouthful of food, "
"Oh, right. Um, funny story that I never told you about. Uh, couple months ago, you remember that thing down in the Financial District that we had to—? Yeah? No? Anyway, in the middle of it, this cosmic crazy shows up looking for Thor, but she found me instead, and I guess that was good enough for her and she thought that no one had fucked with my life in a while, and I was overdue, so she kind of turned me into a woman."
"You asked him to step in as Iron Man until I can squeeze into the suit again," Tony said, understanding what Steve either couldn't or was too embarrassed to get out.
Tony nodded, parsing his words for what he was really saying, before he said, "You're saying I'm too fat to go to the beach."
"Steve, he doesn't hate you," he cut in before Steve could finish his thought. "He doesn't. You're his brother. He just… For one, you're kind of at different points in your lives now, and for another… He doesn't want to keep reliving the past. He doesn't only want to talk about the 'good old days.' And he thinks you think that…if you don't keep talking about the past that you won't have anything else to talk about."
, all right?" Tony said. "It's the truth. Does it sound crazy? I don't know. Any crazier than aliens swarming out of a hole in the sky?"
He glanced at the clock on the microwave and saw it was nearly eight o'clock, and he figured he wasn't getting back to sleep any time soon, so he grabbed a bag of coffee beans from the cabinet, ground up enough for a pot, and then set the coffeemaker to brew, Olivia watching him the entire time.
Bruce and the doctor gave them a picture to take home, and while Tony finally relieved his poor, abused bladder and finished wiping off all the goo that was left on his belly, Steve studied that picture like he would a battle plan. Bruce thanked the doctor for all her help, and she waved off his concern and said it was her pleasure and she was happy to do it. And as they were packing up to leave, Tony grabbing his bag and making for the door, Steve looked at the doctor and said, "Can he— When Tony and I, when we
was the day it would happen, and fu—" he put his hands up to cover the child's ears, "—fuck you very much for that. The first Christmas she can actually enjoy, and you bail out on me and leave me with your ridiculously-suspicious younger counterpart."
He couldn't breathe. Goddamn it, why couldn't be breathe? Why weren't his lungs expanding? Why was it so hot in here all of a sudden?
Steve chuckled lightly and reached out to pick up a small shaker of colored sugar. Taking care to note that the top was still on, he shook it a little to watch the green-colored crystalline granules shift around in the tight space, and Tony shot him a look as he scooped a Santa-shaped piece of dough off the table and said, "You can't tell me they didn't have colored sugar in your day."
Steve started chopping carrots while Peter sat by him and colored, telling Steve all about all the kids in his school who are nice and funny and silly. Steve smiles, loving these moments where his kids go on and on about nothing too important in the big picture but extremely important to them at that moment. Just as Peter starts to talk about the birthday party Jake will be having soon, the phone rings.
"Um... I got hit by a taxi on my way to get the pizzas. I swear I'm ok though Pops, really it was only a couple of bruises, there is no need to over..."
"He got hit by a taxi while going to get Pizzas," Steve replied sitting down with his now slightly annoyed son still in his arms.
Natasha raised her eyebrows,"you really thought Clint and myself weren't going to follow you after we found out who you were? We saw you go into his apartment."
"Spider-Man, it's Tony. Cap needs your help. There is an emergency downtown. Get there as soon as possible."
"Don't you dare say that. You will not die on behalf of me or your father, do you understand? Never. Spider-man is finished. Please, Pete, just go to your room."
Peter just wanted his parents to walk through the front door. Natasha, Clint, Bruce and Thor had all been trying to get him to relax and be patient but he was slowly losing it. Bruce eventually called Rhodey who was able to calm him down for a little, but for the past 4+ hours Peter has really only cared about seeing Steve and Tony walk through the front door. Ned's constant texting about the new scary sci-fi film that was coming out next week was helping, but not enough. So when the door finally opened Peter couldn't get up any faster. He ran over and hugged his pops and dad tightly, both of them dropping their bags to hug him back. "Were they too boring Pete? Is that why you wanted us to come home? I told my honey bear to keep you entertained but I guess he didn't." Rhodey rolled his eyes and Peter and Steve laughed before Peter started telling them most of what he had been up to while they were away, making Steve and Tony both smile.
Ordinarily, Steve would have had the common courtesy to confirm that Tony was OK for him to keep going with what he was doing — especially after claiming that Steve had just taken his virginity — but common courtesy flew out the window the moment Tony shifted just a fraction beneath him, wet warmth clenching around his shaft, and he choked on a breath and lost himself to instinct. Holding himself above, he thrust into Tony, a slow, steady rhythm that gradually became harder and faster the longer he chased after his pleasure. Tony, eyes closed and breathing heavily beneath him, didn't seem too bothered by that, a hand dropping away from Steve's shoulder at one point to reach down and fondle a breast. Steve watched, enraptured, as Tony kneaded the soft, rounded flesh before pinching and twisting a dusky nipple between his thumb and forefinger, and Steve took that as a signal of sorts. He braced the bulk of his upper body weight on his left arm, which freed up his right to reach up and aid Tony with his other breast. He cupped the weighty, warm flesh in his hand, marveling again at how perfectly it fit against his palm, and as Tony continued to fondle one breast, Steve fondled the other, kneading the flesh and pinching the nipple the way he'd seen Tony do it to himself.
He tried to explain what had happened, but the breath he'd tried to take had turned into a gasp, and before he knew it, he was having a hard time getting any breaths in, which Steve seemed to catch right off the bat.
"Not the worst thing I've seen you do," Tony said as Steve burned red with humiliation. "Not the worst thing you've seen me do, either."
So, he enjoyed the stereotypical female pursuits, and he honestly hadn't found himself with any restrictions as to what he could do simply because he now had tits and a vagina. Yeah, OK, there were restrictions — he couldn't go out in the Iron Man suit now — but that was because he was nine-and-a-half-months pregnant and could barely fit into his pajamas let alone a metal exoskeleton. Besides, if he wasn't so goddamned tired all the time, he could just fly the suit remotely.
The lights flickered off while the computers and other electronics shut down, and Tony made his way over to Steve and said, "There's a Starbucks about five hundred feet from here, but I actually know this great little place in Brooklyn. Free trade, organic, independently-run and all that rigmarole." He put a hand to the small of Steve's back, firm and, if he didn't know better, just the slightest touch possessive.
woman that's been seen around town with Captain America. And she is, quite obviously, pregnant. Who are most people going to assume the father is?"
"Steve will do anything for anyone. He just has that good a heart. But you?" She shook her head a little, almost as though in awe. "I don't think there's anything he wouldn't do for you."
"Please stop talking," Tony said and slid off Steve's waist to sit beside him. "I really don't want to think about it."
"I really don't think it's fair to compare those two," he said with a pointed look in Tony's direction.
Tony watched him do this then asked, seeming to know there was more there than met the eye, "I'm sorry, are you trying to imply I
"I can handle seeing naked people, Tones. Just was not expecting that…full frontal…the moment I walked in the door," Rhodey said and took a seat on the chair. "How's this working, anyway? We all going out with you?"
He took hold of Steve by his shoulders, his fingers digging in and looking for the purchase he never again thought he'd have, and he looked over his husband and laughed, tears blurring his vision, before he threw his arms around him and pressed tight against him.
Rhodey finished putting her hair back into a ponytail, and he stood there and looked at it a moment before he frowned and said, "I can't believe it's gotten to the point that that was not weird at all for me."
The next morning, Steve worked those bashful, crystalline-blue irises, and Tony, in too much of a good mood from the things Steve had done to him the night before, found himself calling up an obstetrician for the first — and what he hoped would be
He wasn't sure what sort of reaction he expected from Steve at that revelation, but he was about ninety percent sure it wasn't teary-eyed joy.
He bit his lip and looked between Steve and Esmeralda. He kind of…well, honestly, he kind of enjoyed nursing, and not only that but no one else could do it— Well, given the right hormone and stimulation, they probably could, but at this moment in time, no one else could. He'd thought the whole thing about bonding over nursing was bullshit said to encourage women to nurse their young, but in his experience he'd found it was actually kind of…true. Not to mention it was healthier — going by all those stupid articles Steve had bookmarked, anyway — but was it…?
"Because I'm wearing a low-cut shirt and a tight pair of jeans? Are you fucking kidding me? Maybe I just like the way they look on me."
"It wasn't a philanthropic backpacking—" he started to say but then sighed and got back to the more important part of Tony's statement. "I have, just—" he took Tony by the shoulders and gently forced him to sit down, "—not for anyone I know. I'm not sure how the Other Guy would handle that happening to someone I care about."
"I think it looks great. Goes well with your coloring," Natasha said then added, "I think Steve will appreciate it very much."
"I don't know. I honestly couldn't tell you." He sat back and tried to fold his arms again and grumbled as he remembered he had to position his arms differently if he didn't want to…squash himself. "How do you deal with this?" he muttered, and she shrugged.
"Especially when you're the one that fucked up the relationship," Sam said, and Bucky nodded his solemn agreement.
Steve gave a derisive snort. "All your life? You've got to be at least twenty years older than I am."
Tony raised his hands, taking aim to fire. "You lay one finger on my baby, and I'll dismember you inch-by-inch."
It wasn't just the personality that was wrong. It was the other, smaller things as well. This Tony Stark was supposedly in a relationship with a stunningly beautiful woman named Pepper Potts, who was the CEO of Stark Industries — Howard's old company — and a highly successful one at that. He understood their portfolio to be quite impressive, whatever that meant, the company undergoing a new era of growth and prosperity and innovation under her leadership.
Steve looks up at his son and then gets up off the ground quickly. "Peter... um... your dad he... he's gone for a few days... maybe more... we aren't exactly sure." His Pops is clearly trying to sound ok but is not doing a very good job.
Tony got up and went to the closet in their bedroom. He reached inside and grabbed a big box. The first frame he pulled out had three pictures in it.
"As long as he doesn't pick some sappy rom com then Peter can choose the movie," his dad said as he opened his lab door, Bruce following close behind.
"Daddy it's the first day of camp! I can't be late for the first day! And we have so much to do! I need my suit daddy, and my goggles, and my new towel that papa got me, and my backpack, and uncle Thor said he would make me my lunch today but he's not here yet, and..." she continued to list the things that needed to be done as Tony walked up the steps until they got to Peters room.
Peter nods and Wade gets up to jump off the building, turning around one last time to lift his mask up and give Peter a quick kiss on the cheek over his Spidey mask. He then does a soldier salute and jumps off the building, leaving Peter to blush like crazy under his mask.
(Bucky, of course, already had, and was seemingly actually a little upset that he wasn't even considered a possibility for caregiver in the event of his and Tony's death; Peggy he had every intention of introducing her to come the spring when she was a little older and better suited to traveling.)
He moved aside to let the staff set it on the table in front of him and Steve, marveling at the design of it. It was tiered, three square layers atop each other, the icing or whatever that stuff was called an almost royal purple color with what looked like hand-crafted marzipan calla lilies placed around it and tiny, decorative silver balls stuck with precise measurement along the intricately- decorated sides of each layer. Maybe it wasn't what Tony would have ever picked for himself, but it still was a pretty nice-looking cake.
Pepper just blinked at him, and she stuttered out a few non-word responses before she said, "I really don't think
," he muttered and folded his arms, resting them between his breasts and his gigantic belly. "And it's not 'Antonia Stefania.' It's 'James Steven.'"
"Relax!" she said and waved off Jane's concern. "I'm not gonna say anything. It's a lot more fun being in-the-know. It's like I'm an honorary Avenger."
Tony took a sharp inhale of breath, and he said, "You have to. We have to trust each other. We've seen what happens when we don't. That can't happen— I will do everything in my power to make sure that doesn't happen here, and I know you — or
But Tony shook his head, tamping down that odd, prickling feeling of jealousy that had reared its ugly head at the idea that he wasn't Steve's first. It wasn't fair to Steve, either. Steve was far from his first, so why should it bother him that Steve had had another
"Barton, say one more word, and I'll strangle you with your bow. Understood?" Tony snapped and began to follow Steve back away from the field. "Babe?" he said and joined in-step with Steve. "It's not the end of the world."
"OK," Tony said with a nod and then leaned in and pecked a soft kiss against his lips for good measure. "I mean, is it weird as fuck? Sure," he said as he sat back, and Steve was two seconds away from getting himself worked up again before Tony continued, "But honestly? What isn't fucked up about our lives anymore? Fuck we fought aliens last year, Steve. Real fucking aliens. I mean, it was only a matter of time before one of us ended up with the ol' Rule 63. I actually thought it would have been more likely to be Thor, you know, because honestly, this really seems like something that would have been in his asshole brother's wheelhouse, but whatever."
"Anyway, I'm not intentionally trying to hurt you. I'm just saying that — though I love you — your culinary skills, well,
(Which was totally not true. Tony still had that magnificent work of modern art — the Iron Man portrait — hanging up in his lab. No one could tell him that wasn't art — not Pepper, not Steve, not anybody. And both Steve and Pepper had told him many, many times.)
"So, was Tony serious about it?" Sam asked, and Natasha shrugged as she let Bucky play with her hand.
to attend. Besides, they wanted to get this whole thing out in the open now and lay everyone's questions and concerns to rest, what better way to start doing that than by showing up to the Stark Foundation gala, pregnant and glowing and hanging off the arm of a handsome super soldier?
No, that was the little parasite thumping or turning or whatever the fuck it was doing inside of him.
She laughed and pushed in, holding the door open for Tony, who followed with Rhodey and the phone right behind him, and he suddenly realized how crazy this whole thing was when everyone turned to look at him—
would have shunned this woman if she really had been just a gold-digging whore out for Steve's money and fame — out to take advantage of some void left by the god- awful Tony Stark. Just what did Captain America see in that train wreck anyway? He could still remember the more cynical columnists and TV talking heads and radio morning show clowns setting up their countdown clocks to see how long it would be before Captain America came to his senses and dropped the dead weight that was Tony Stark on his ungrateful ass. They, of course, were having a field day with this news, half of them convinced Steve had finally dumped Tony for someone 'more fitting' for him while the other half thought Steve was so messed up by the ice that he didn't realize he'd gone from an alcoholic albatross to a 'stupid skank' (as one of the morning show assholes had called him; Steve had almost broken his tablet when he'd stumbled upon that).
He paused in thought for a moment, his gaze cast aside and a small smile pulling at his mouth like he was recalling a memory of an earlier time.
He scoffed. "Whatever. The only one that's going to yell at me about it is Steve, and I won't tell him if you don't. And that goes for you, too, J!" he called.
"It is. If it wasn't, you would have denied it." He exhaled a breath and said, "OK, why are you mad about Bucky?"
Tony glanced down Steve's body and noticed how the front of his uniform pants was soaked with something dark.
She pulled her hands away. "And now it's weird." She shook her head and laughed a little to herself before she said, "How are
"You're doing a shit job of proving me wrong," Tony assured them from the safety and security of Steve's embrace. Steve bit back a 'Language!' and instead pressed a light kiss to the top of Tony's head, and both Sam and Bucky stared at them with matching looks of annoyance and disgust.
“He’s grounded again. We are changing the password for the system override code, we are putting bars on the window, we are taking away the door to his room, done. Any shot Peter had of having some freedom he just lost, he...”
"I hang onto your every word." He let go and went back to the tablet. "I really think you need to read some of this stuff, though."
And, as Nat went to pester him again, he switched the comm back off and reached out to Tony, the Iron Man armor powering up and flying away from the scene and toward the direction of Midtown. "Come on. We ride the subway for free."
"What?" Romanoff said and looked from the screen to Barton, but Barton just looked at Bruce and said, "
"I really think we're all at risk for developing diabetes," Bruce replied and dug through for an onion bagel.
Tony just looked over at him, and Steve smiled a little stupidly and added, "Being Captain America's got to be good for something, right?"
Steve was silent a moment, and in that moment, Tony found himself lulled by the gentle rumble of the road, Steve's sturdy presence beside him and the soft sounds of 70s rock echoing from the speakers. He reveled in this contented peace until Steve said like the confused old man he sometimes was, "Why would people
"Now, tell your little boyfriend over there to take a hike. You're coming home with me tonight. And me alone."
He struggled to fall asleep every night because he could never seem to find a comfortable position unless he was lying on his side with a pillow shoved between his legs, and those times he was able to catch a few winks, he drifted off with the naïve hope that he'd wake up the following morning back to his old self. But every morning, he woke up disappointed because he was still a woman, still nauseated, and therefore still pregnant. Well, maybe 'disappointed' wasn't the right word to use. So fucking despondent that there were times he thought about throwing himself off the roof of the Tower and taking every precaution imaginable to make sure JARVIS wouldn't send one of the suits after him.
Tony shot her an unimpressed look. "You know what I mean," he said then motioned pointedly over his chest area.
The man snorted a laugh. "I see Barton found his new arrow set. Hope the fucker realizes he's not getting any new ones until after New Year's, so he'd better hope no one tries any shit until the holidays are over."
"Although that sounds a lot easier and would definitely get us even more press coverage—" he heaved out a sigh, "—unfortunately, no. One of the rooms downstairs. Pep's already got it set up."
He laughed a little. "I have a feeling they were only planning on doing it the one time, kiddo. Sorry."
"Are you sure it was safe?" the Cap asked, concern etched over his face, jaw set, and crease formed between his brows, and Tony startled at the now-familiar expression.
"Or just a drifter," Steve said just as the being emerged from the woods. Steve kept walking, but Tony stopped to look at what turned out to be a man — one with long hair and tattered clothes and the scruff of what was probably a two-week-old beard. He stood stock-still on the other side of the road as he stared at them, glowering and yet somehow, strangely, looking a little unsure, a little lost. On the surface, he looked like a threat — like the proverbial drifter with a hook for a hand — the type it was clearly smarter to keep distance from. But there was something about the look — something about the confusion and the pain — that made Tony realize what this man desperately needed was help.
This chapter is not my best. I just couldn't really get it to flow the way I wanted it to. I apologize for that.
"Not to say we weren't getting along just as swell before this. I'm not sure if you're aware, but we definitely one hundred percent did not need a baby to 'complete' us. We were doing absolutely fine just the two of us."
Tony startled a bit and looked at his watch. "Oh. Right. Probably. Tomorrow. What are you doing tomorrow?"
Well, he decided as he scanned his form from head down to where the large mirror cut him off at the knees, he didn't see anything different. He peered closer, checking for wrinkles under his eyes or gray hairs that might have sprouted up in the interim. Nothing. So far as he could tell, he looked exactly as he had earlier that morning.
"It's only a can of Coke," she said and sat down on the ottoman, setting the kit beside her. "It's not going to kill you."
Steve nodded, swallowing, like he was processing what Tony was telling him and filing it away for understanding and reference. "OK," he decided. "Are we still calling you 'Tony'?"
He slipped on a pair of briefs followed by a black pair of comfortable stretchy pants, and it was as he was digging for one of his favorite band shirts that he found it—
Steve swallowed again and fumbled with his hands before he gripped the counter behind them. "Are you sure it's safe?"
"Exactly," he said and looked up to where Bruce now stood at his elbow. "Look, I know you think it'll be easy as pie to get her back where you think she belongs, but what if that's the point? What if she doesn't belong there anymore? What if she belongs here? What if this is always how it was supposed to go? She was always supposed to come here."
Steve pulled away to look him in the eye. "You still really need to ask if I find you attractive like this?"
Bruce just gave his chosen pet-name-of-the-moment an odd smile then glanced around and said, "Gee, I hope Steve didn't get lost or something."
"Uh," Tony said and scratched his arm, frowning as he seemed to consider this. "Huh. I, ah, honestly, I never really thought about it. I've just...always used those names with Rhodey. I didn't know you would want me to use them with you."
." He put a hand over his mouth. "Good Christ," he muttered, dropping his hand away. "I can't believe those words came out of my mouth."
It had hurt, breaking up with Tony. He'd repressed it, closed off that part of himself, tried not to let himself think about it, but it was like a shadow always following him, like a cloud always hanging over his head. There was a part of him that wished he hadn't been so in love, had broken up with Tony because he'd moved on. It was selfish, of course, but Steve could admit there were times that he wasn't as selfless as he pretended to be, especially when it came to Tony. He gave to Tony, yes, but he also took from him, and gladly. Took Tony's love, Tony's confidence, his humor, and his care. Because Tony cared — good lord, how Tony cared. Because Tony always looked out for him, wanted him to be safe, wanted to give him the world. Because though he didn't say it, Steve knew that Tony allowed himself to be vulnerable with him in ways he wouldn't allow even to Rhodey. Because he knew that he made Tony feel
when Steve had — somehow — had that dream (or whatever it was). He may have been a wretch, but it wasn't his fault he wasn't the man Steve had once fantasized about (to put it mildly; he still remembered the…mess…he'd made of himself in that bathroom — the mess Tony had unthinkingly and unblinkingly cleaned up).
had ever thought Steve was cut out for spy work. The guy wouldn't know subtle sometimes if it hit him in the face with a 2x4.
"Why?" Wilson asked, not understanding the significance of that date. You know, like a normal person.
Did he really just…? Jesus, the stupid gendered things he'd come to accept as 'normal' or 'appropriate.' Fucking societal expectations.
Tony considered this, looking from Barnes to a suddenly solemn Natasha to a nervous and sad- eyed Bruce, but he shook his head and said, "No, I don't— J!"
Tony grinned at the little dark red onesie with 'Future MIT Grad' printed on it, and Steve made a face and said quietly, "What if... What if she doesn't want to go to MIT?"
"Isn't that what your lab is for?" Steve asked and carefully painted a line of pastel yellow trim just above the blue-taped base trim board of the wall.
Tony frowned at the dark and serious tone Steve's voice had taken on at those words. "Babe, it's OK. Nothing happened."
Tony shot him a sly glance. "No," he said after a moment's deliberation. "I think you need to find that one out the hard way."
"Hmm?" Tony asked without looking up from his phone. He took another bite of his platter, swallowed, and said, still not looking up, "Oh, he got some stupid idea in his head that he wasn't good enough for me, so he broke it off. Didn't see him for years after that. Not sure what he's doing now."
Tony grinned at him and sat down at the seat adjacent to him. "Oh!" he said, drawing the word out. "You like this one, don't you?"
He huffed and sighed he didn't know how many times, stared at the wall, at the ceiling, at the door, at the shadows reflected by the moonlight from outside. He drummed his fingers on his belly and then rolled his eyes when that seemed to rouse the kraken hibernating therein, and he pressed his face into his pillow and moaned when sleep, after nearly an hour, still didn't overtake him.
But Steve was not from Asgard. Steve did not have the same knowledge and understanding of centuries of existence in the way that Thor did. Steve was dumb kid from Brooklyn that maybe had gotten a little in over his head and had now found himself seventy years into a future he couldn't have imagined and now never wanted to leave. It was an unfortunate byproduct of the elixir that had given him this body that he now couldn't age and wouldn't age and — unless he pulled something stupid — would stay exactly as he was while he watched Tony — his Tony — grow old and wither and finally die, powerless to stop it. And someday, the same would be said of his little baby girl and any children she might have were he lucky enough to be a grandfather.
"I don't think they were," Steve replied. "But I'm pretty sure there's going to be a lot of broken glass and holes in walls when we get back."
"I don't," Bruce said because he was a glutton for punishment, and Olivia turned her attention to him. "Why don't you tell me what it is?"
But instead of comforting him or assuring him, Steve's words had provided clarity for him. Yes, this was absolutely horrifying, and no, there was not exactly a manual that he could follow, but what this was, at its heart, was life. It was a life they had created out of their love for one another (all right and horniness). There was something almost...pure about it. This wasn't a life born at the bottom of a whiskey bottle or a quick getting-off-of-rocks-before-going-to-war. This wasn't a desperate need for an heir. This was two people absolutely crazy about each other creating a whole new life from that love. It was not done in the most conventional way, no, and there were bound to be complications of some sort that would arise from it, but it was, at its heart, creating life from love.
He wasn't sure if the bump he felt against his rib was a 'Yes' or a 'Fuck you, Pops.' Weirdly, he presumed it to be the latter.
He kind of made a slight clutching motion with his hands as he said that — like he was squeezing that gorgeous ass right at that moment. Barnes just grimaced a little like he knew exactly what Tony was thinking about and wasn't happy the thought had been put into his head.
Tony waved him away and said, "Go. Play with your spores and fungus…things…" but Steve said, "Actually, the doctor wants Tony to have an ultrasound as well."
much taller than he was! — then sketched the other Avengers, including ones Tony had never heard of like Falcon and Wanda and Vision. She drew what Tony figured was supposed to be DUM-E with a dunce cap on — evidently, that was something he did — then Pepper sitting behind a big desk 'doing important stuff' while Olivia sat on her lap and helped. Most of this was Tony having to read into the pictures or getting Olivia to explain it to him, as they were simple line drawings and stick figures, and it was really only the hair and eye colors and the size differences that set any of the characters apart.
Steve tensed up beside him, and Tony sat up and turned his attention to Thor. "What are you talking about, big guy?"
"Are they bringing the body back? Thor didn't decide to do a Viking funeral for him somewhere, did he? Or some fucked up Asgardian thing to ensure Steve enters the pearly gates of Valhalla or whatever?"
of stuff I miss about being a guy, yeah, there's going to be some stuff I miss about being a woman. And
borrow one of those t-shirts. God forbid I breathe on them the wrong way. She's got syrup all over that one."
a good person then. I was a rich playboy alcoholic with a massive ego. I… Yinsen, the guy that saved my life in Afghanistan, we met years before at a conference in Bern. He remembered me. I… Well, I didn't remember him." He laughed out a breath and said. "Fuck, if I…if I could just have one chance to go back. All I'd want to do is shake his hand and say 'thank you.' He wouldn't know what I was talking about, clearly, but… He didn't
"Which I know sounds crass and insensitive especially in light of certain—" he coughed and shot a glance at the couple that had been through more fertility treatments than Thor had boxes of Pop-Tarts or Barton had bad jokes in the last two years, "—uh, histories present, but I mean, it's not like this was something I ever thought
After two hours of Steve going on and on about everything that supposedly ranked lower on the scale of importance to him than Tony, Tony struggled to his feet from where he sat beside Steve on the couch and found his way back to the bathroom. It had been a while since he'd showered, and he thought one might do him well, so he grabbed some clothes and closed the door and turned the shower on.
"Fuck's sake, Steve, stop blaming yourself!" Tony yelled, his voice cracking from the changed pitch. God, he hated what he sounded like as a woman. As he'd discovered the first time it had happened, he tended to get screechy when he got excited. "This is no one's fault but hers! She— She's nuts. There's no reasoning with crazy people. This was what she always intended. She thinks we're soul mates, and she thinks, as soul mates, we're supposed to be fruitful and multiply. I wouldn't be a bit surprised if the reason we were so goddamned horny for each other was because it was part of the spell — to make sure this—" he motioned down at himself once more, "— happened."
Tony hummed a little, and he reached out and ran his fingers through Steve's damp hair, and he said, "Well, as much fun as this was—"
Wary, distrustful, and wondering how long it would be before the dam broke, Steve sat down on the edge of the couch, giving himself enough room to jump into action when the need arose. Tony just shook his head and muttered something about '
"Are you kidding? He lives to contradict me. I just explained to him that my way sounded better and made more sense."
,” Stark stuttered, all the blood in his body clearly at the wrong head at the moment. Steve hummed a moment then said, “No, I’m going to fuck you, and you’re going to lay there like the needy little slut that you are and take it.”
"You OK?" he asked, half in a tease and half in concern. "You seem a little...clingy...all of a sudden."
"Yeah, and like she wouldn't have enough things to do," Barton said with a disappointed shake of his head.
Tony cringed and squeezed his eyes shut a moment, and he when he opened them again, Pepper was blinking furiously like she was trying to comprehend what had just been said to her.
"Mmm!" Thor said and sat up, one of the cookies in-hand. "They are most delicious. Our Anthony proves himself to be a masterful and formidable perpetrator of Midgardian feasts."
"I could use the Hulk," he said then looked at Tony, "but you could probably use Bruce here more, especially if we're going to be housing hospital patients for the foreseeable future—"
"You know, you'd think offering aid and assistance to the city would be enough for you people," he muttered as he watched a few commentators discuss what the banner at the bottom said was 'Lights Out: Why Aren't the Avengers Doing More?'
But not only was the old codger alive, but SHIELD wanted him to join their super-secret boy band along with Tony and a bunch of other misfits. OK, not Tony because Romanoff had decided he wasn't good enough.
kinds of material possessions, anyway — but Steve, as it turned out, was concerned that he didn't have anything
"You still look like our Tony. We can see it. But you're very classically beautiful. It's almost like that goddess purposely made you into what western society has historically determined to be what's most physically attractive in a woman."
"Exact same," Tony said, his joy cut short as the memory of what Steve had looked like then flashed in his mind: bloodied, bruised, tired, beat-up, and clearly coming from not exactly befitting a Saturday afternoon garden party.
Esmeralda just smiled at him, the kind that grated because there was something cryptic and knowing about it. "Now, why spoil the surprise?"
"How are— You— You're already— How were you able to— You actually looked like you wanted—" Pepper sputtered, directing her attention to Natasha, who just shrugged.
Steve glanced between Sam and Bucky, Bucky shot daggers at Sam, but he exhaled an annoyed breath through his nose and turned to Steve.
Natasha disappeared for a few minutes, and Tony was just beginning to think that she was leaving him to stew by himself when she reappeared, a glass in one hand and a kit of some kind in another. "Here," she said, holding out the glass to him, and he took it, seeing it was a tumbler of something caramel colored and fizzy over ice. There was a slice of lime and a slice of lemon in it and a little red stirrer-straw-swizzle-stick-thing sticking out of it.
He felt Tony's arms stiffen, and he pulled back some and went to check to see what was wrong when Tony mumbled out, "There's a lot of things Howard would never believe."
She looked up at him, and Tony met her gaze. Her lips parted just the slightest, her resolve fumbling for a moment before steely determination slipped back over her visage, one perfectly- sculpted eyebrow raising as she gave him a look like he was worrying over nothing.
Thor just reached out and pulled the hammer off the table, setting it instead on the floor beside the
Steve just shook his head and clutched a little tighter to the robot in his hands. "That's not the version I know. That damned song is everywhere. I hear it in my sleep. That's not the version I know."
He sat down on the corner chair, and he set the shoes on the floor before he opened the tin of black shoe polish and took some onto the rag. He picked up one of the shoes and began to rub the polish into it, and Tony stood there and watched for a few moments before he said, "How long is this going to take?"
"Baron von Strucker?" Tony said as he licked all the gelato off his spoon. "That's like a ridiculously obvious name for a bad guy. Like seriously, why not just call yourself Moustache-twirling McEvil-Doer? God, sounds like he should be wearing a monocle and have one of those hawk-noses — like Colonel Klink but actually evil."
He shrugged and stabbed another forkful of egg, sausage, and pancake. "I don't know," he said and shoved the bite in his mouth. "Clothes, I guess."
Where Steve and Barnes sat, the kitchen looking like a bomb had gone off and the two of them digging through what looked like bags from McDonald's.
He followed Steve down the hall, Bruce bringing up the rear, and Steve held the door for them once they got to the doctor's suite. They stepped into the waiting room, which, at three minutes after five, was completely devoid of patients. Even the girls behind the window were gone, the only one left being Doctor Ganford, who was looking at something on a computer, her face drawn in seriousness, before she looked up and smiled at her arrivals.
He grumbled a bit and pushed away from his workstation. "Save it, but don't close it. I'm not staying up there for very long, and make sure they know that. If it's just because they need me to settle another Thai versus Vietnamese debate, the answer is neither. It's Italian. It's always Italian."
"Yeah," Steve said and shot him an amused look, "I'm calling to book a doctor's appointment at eleven-thirty at night. We'll call in the morning."
"Her. Olivia," he said and nodded toward the baby. "What happened to me. What happened to you. It all fits. It all makes sense. It all— It all matches up. It happened…or is going to happen. Whatever. It was real. It
"Yeah huh. Fine, babe," he said, frozen with two fingers scissored inside of him. "Go back to sleep."
Tony exhaled a breath. "Steve has no problem discussing the concept of 'fucking.' When it comes to me and him, however, he insists on calling it 'making love.'"
He ignored them, figuring that acknowledging their gazes would be the wrong move, and instead moved over to a panel entitled 'Love from London.' There was a write-up of the photographer's exploits in London during 1964 and a portrait of her looking younger and more innocent, the makeup less pronounced and her dark-blonde hair done up in a very neat bouffant with the bangs combed to one side and the flip at the ends resting just above her shoulders. The famous Tower Bridge was set in the background with the Thames taking up parts of the middle and foreground. He skimmed the write-up because he didn't have much else to do, finding that she'd acted as a 'correspondent' of sorts for various American magazines about the 'hip' scene going on in London at the height of the so-called 'British Invasion.' Evidently, her tagline had been 'Love from London,' and the cynic in him wondered if she was nothing more than a PR stunt thought up to exploit the American obsession with all-things-British during that brief time period. Probably, as the write-up seemed to indicate that her series of 'letters home' only lasted about a year.
He scrubbed and rinsed off, wetting his hair and washing his face, and after what he figured amounted to two minutes, he stepped out of the shower and grabbed his towel.
"Well," Bruce said, and Tony wasn't sure if he was relieved or annoyed that he had some rapport with the brat, "maybe your Aunt…Pepper…thought it was time to pay some attention to your sister, too?"
Tony rubbed his hand over his belly again. "Steve, honey, I think you're being a little unreasonable about all this—"
"If you mean 'shape,' then clearly you need to have your eyes checked because there is no way a lumpy pillow could ever be confused with that expertly-sculpted marble he calls a torso. If you mean because the shirt would be too small for even the pillow, well, I can't argue with you there." He pointed a finger at her. "But I can tell you don't you
He glanced up and watched as Steve seemed to weigh this new information, mouth pursed and head cocked to the side and gaze somewhere across the room. He watched as Steve flexed his hands and ground his teeth a little and shook his head just the slightest before he nodded, either like he'd accepted this information in record time or was still having a hard time believing it.
Instead, Tony pointed to Darcy and said to Jane, "I'm not sure I'm so crazy about her knowing about this."
"Really makes you feel appreciated, doesn't it?" Wilson said and shared a look with the rest of the assembled group.
"Not this one. This is a different one. This one won't splatter in front of a semi. Come on, Steve! This way, I get to have my cake and eat it, too! I stay here, in the comfort of my own lab while you guys go out and deal with the shitty stuff."
Whether it was the cut of his jaw or the hairline or the shape of the eyes, this was clearly Steve's father, a service photo presumably taken before he'd shipped off for France to meet his doom.
"Hmm…" Tony said as he clambered under the covers then stopped and frowned at Steve. "Wait, for what?"
"Snow tires, babe." He glanced over just in time to see Steve's confusion. "Oh," he said with a laugh, "you've probably never heard of all-season radials, either."
"Yeah?" Steve said and tried to meet Tony's gaze, but Tony wouldn't let him. "Well, that's too bad."
"'Almost' isn't 'did,'" Sam radioed back. "And I was totally watching you over the cams, so don't even pull that shit with me."
gotten into his fucking penthouse. He really was going to have to talk to the guy that set up the building's security. Tony-something, he thought his name was. Fuck, Happy was going to have a bird when he found out.
"Uh," he said and sat back a little, frowning at her concern. "Why? You don't think he'd want to do it? Look, he's very detailed and very anal about those sorts of things. I figured he'd be a natural. Oh! Unless this is about, um, me not picking
Steve just laughed and took several long strides to meet up with Tony. He took Tony's hands in his and swung his arms a bit.
"You didn't even try! You didn't even try to get her back, and when I said I thought I had an idea, you shot me down! You didn't
"I mean," she said as Tony sat up again, "from everything I can see here, you're pretty much the perfect model of a woman, though
"Tony, you're only at about eight centimeters," Bruce had explained to Tony's whines and frustration as he snapped off a pair of disposable gloves. "You can't start pushing until you're at ten."
Tony swallowed again, squeezing the piece of paper tighter if possible, and he closed his eyes and saw, just for a moment, a bruised and bloodied Steve Rogers from another timeline carrying a little blonde-haired spitfire through a red-tinged portal, promising her that when she opened her eyes again, her papa — her
"I didn't say she doesn't. I've seen the pics of you as a kid. She's you with blonde hair. The attitude's all wrong, but I can't deny she looks like you."
He'd be lying if he said he hadn't intentionally chosen this route just for the chance to catch a glimpse of Tony again.
"I'm going with the food-thing," Natasha said and grabbed a plain bagel from the bag just as Steve had set it down on the island. He looked between Bruce and Natasha, shook his head, and then turned to Tony.
