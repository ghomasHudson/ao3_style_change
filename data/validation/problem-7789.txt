"Stay back, Sir." Steve heard one of the nurses tell Bucky before the doctors swarmed him once more, causing Steve to scream and thrash as he tried to shy away from their hands and the needle in one of the doctor's hands…
The footsteps got louder and louder, walking on the barren land below; the person who dared to walk on this forbidden land, gazed around the place, pale blue skin and cyborg body parts reflecting the deem light, informing whoever was waiting for her that she was there.
At least Steve was making a notable process with Harley, which Tony was thankful about even if he was a little bit jealous at times. but after three months of Harley living with them, Tony can safely say that the boy started to warm up to everyone, and by everyone Tony mean himself mainly, then his and Steve friends' and extended family, which was a process if Tony saw any.
"I see… so this is their leader, right?" Tony asked, tapping his ax near the man's neck which made the poor shmuck flinch and try to back away only to have Steve step on his back to still him. at Steve's nod, Tony only grin, his grin was predatory and full of teeth which only succeeded in making the man pale like a corpse. "Thank you, sweetheart, I started to get bored after we finished that bitch off, this toy would surely entertain me until we reach home," Tony said, giving Steve a loving kiss on the lips before turning his eyes toward the man who was squirming and trying to run away. "Get ready bitch, because when I am done with you, you will rot in the bottom of the ocean." Tony hissed, a grin taking over his lips as he raised his ax, chasing the idiot who thought it would be a great idea to miss with him.
"What do you mean by that, Edith, why is Steven considered a risk?" Natasha asked, eyes darting around the place searching for a gap, she realizes that she can't crush the glasses, the risk of Edith transforming its conscious to the Stark mansion is extremely high, and the probability of them being held here if they destroy it even higher, so that left her with nothing but work to gain information from the A.I. until it deemed it clear for them to leave the workshops.
So what do you think?
"I am sorry… but have we met?" Steve asked, taking in the woman's dark brown hair, brown eyes, and red lipstick, which were a strange thing for him to note, his question though, seemed to have snapped the woman out of her shock as she smiled at the Omega, but not without confusion burning behind her eyes.
"Use your voice!" Snarled the Omega as he held the knife like a weapon, the sound of footsteps behind them making both Tony and Steve tense, but the Alpha tried to calm himself and emit as much calmness as he could. "Use your voice, goddammit, or I will use the knife!" Desperation was seeping in Tony's voice, making the Alpha open his mouth and close it, heart pounding in his chest in fear, not knowing what to do or say. "Fine… Have it your way…" The Omega hissed before he raised the knife, planning to hurt himself, and that was what broke the Alpha from his shock, knowing that if he rushed to take the knife from Tony, not only would he hurt the Omega, there was a possibility of the Omega getting hurt with the knife more than he was planning.
Thankfully writing this chapter was able to calm me down.
Today, Tony got the courage to invite Steve and Peter for a dinner, which something he didn't dare to do in all of the six months he knew Steve because inviting the Alpha into his house for dinner meant something to him, especially when Tony was bad at making friends and not knowing how to act around anyone if he didn't sass the living daylight out of them, thankfully Steve finds it charming and not repulsive like many Alphas who will try and break a mouthy Omega.
Tony frown to himself, thinking about what Steve wants in exchange for him stopping his reign of terror. It was so tempting to say no and book it out of here; but the thing was, Steve nearly went through every Avengers there is, the only ones who hadn't taste his wrath yet, were Bruce and Bucky. He was sure that anything Steve will dish at Bucky, the man will find enjoyable he won't even care if Steve ended up killing him. Bruce on the other hand, if he ended at the end of one of Steve's pranks, it meant that the other guy will become involved, and when that happens, it will be hell. Not to forget that Tony doesn't even know if Steve won't go after Pepper and Happy later, maybe even Rhodey, and that was a No-no thing!
“Shame, it seems I missed the fun.” Tony spoke in mock disappointment, causing Natasha to laugh, the tense knots inside Tony left, him relaxing fully realizing that everything he saw last night, was just a horrible dream, him not used to being alone and all, hopefully, it will all pass away soon. “Hey, Nat. I remembered I need to talk with you about something.” These words caused Natasha to gaze at him with a lifted eyebrow, the delighted expression on her face faded as she lingered for Tony to say something, the transformation that took place stumped Tony, but he went on with a small smile. “You see, my best friends, who are practically my family, want to visit me, and I don’t even know if I should like, I don’t know? Get them approved by Fury or something? And the next thing is the matter of how I will be able to direct them here, like Shield isn’t even on the map, so what do you think I should do?” These words caused Natasha’s thoughtful look to melt and for a smile to twitch on her lips, a development that Tony was going to ask Natasha about later.
"It is but a simple price…" Nebula told the woman, her tongue getting thicker as she tried to banish the horror that would befall the Ancient One away from her mind. Nebula wondered if Thanos was going to be merciful enough to rip the star's heart and eat it out; Nebula desperately hoped for that, at least death would have been more merciful to the star than decades of torture and assault that would follow. Nebula could only before he too started breaking and losing his mind…
"I should have listened to your mother and Morticia and homeschool our boy, but nooooo! I was an idiot who wanted him to interact with people and make friends other than us… I was sooooo stupid!" Tony cried out, sobbing into his husband's chest… he should have really listened to Serpentine, he really should have, maybe then he wouldn't be crying his eyes out at the thought of his baby leaving the home so soon.
"…And, and, and now our lucky star is in our home!" Peter squeals happily, clapping his hands as he told Thor the tale of how Steven was the Stark family's lucky star, which made Tony roll his eyes fondly, Peter always loved their lucky star, he always loved that only Tony and him can see it, he always take a pride in the fact there was a star in the universe meant for only Tony and Peter; currently, Peter told the story of their lucky star to anyone who would listen, even before Steven came to live with them, he always went on and on about their lucky star, after Steven though, you can say that Peter won't stop talking about him no matter what, unless Tony tried to distract him with inventing in the workshop.
"What do you think?" Bucky asked nervously as he got out of the fitting room, Steve inspected the Alpha with a critical eye, his smile widen even more as he took in how the blue jacket fit the Alpha like it was made for him, which made Steve give a praise to his keen eyes for snatching that jacket before someone else did.
." Tony whined, moving his hips a little hoping that Steve will get the point across.
Tony sighed tiredly, pouting harder and harder with every second that passed, and sleep refused to come and greet him; how cruel, it wasn't like Tony didn't want to sleep and chill, it was just that he was too wrung out to do so, even on the soft
His love was pale, so pale, the only color on his pale skin was the black circles under Steve's eyes; even Steve's vibrate blond hair has lost all of its health. Lying on the large bed, Tony never realized how small his love could be, but on the white hospital bed, it made Tony realize how tiny his mate was. Tony realize at that moment how much of a failure he was, how pathetic he was, weak, stupid, careless, easily distracted, and never paid any attention to the important things in his life.
“I… I don’t remember really, everything is a bit fuzzy last night; I was extremely tired to pay any attention.” Tony offered with a sleepy smile, marveling to himself why he didn’t tell the chief and Natasha what had took a place last night, but knowing deep down that whatever he saw was not a teenager who was trying to intimidate him, but something else.
"Natasha! How could you? I thought you loved me? Why would you hide something important like that?" Angie start firing questions left and right walking toward the Alpha that was backing away from the Beta who was hissing like a dragon, the sight was too much that it made Tony laugh at that and shook his head as the redheaded Alpha squeaked and hide behind Peggy shivering in fear when she was Angie walking toward her. The sound of Tony's laughter stopped the women and made them turn to the Omega who was hiding his face in his pup's head; the pup was purring watching the woman in confusion while hugging his toy…
The car was silent this time when they returned home, Peter had fallen asleep inside the car still clutching the wristwatch, like it was a lifeline, which made Steve a little concern but Tony didn't bring it up. Parking near his house, Steve got out of the car, Tony was already out as he carried Peter's sleeping form, crooning to him gently and rocking him back to sleep when the pup scrunches his nose.
A voice called out desperately and the Omega wondered why the voice sounded like it was coming from under the water… or maybe it was Steven who was underwater? But everything sounded so fainted when all Steven could hear was the sound of his crying and weeping Omega as its voice increased making Steven's head throb painfully like it was about to split open, which didn't seem to matter to him anymore, because when darkness finally embraces him…
Tony glared at the Alpha, who was carrying the children in his arms when they latched into him, causing them to give a loud shriek of laughter, the movement in his arms made him look down at Peter who was looking at Steve with like he wanted to go in and participate in the fun, glaring at the other pups with a pout on his face, lips wobbled a little as he hides himself in Tony's chest. That made Tony bite the inside of his cheek and look at the room once again glaring at the Alpha hoping that he will burn by the power of his glare alone, no pressure, huh? What a fucker.
"Oh… I… I was sewing my shirt, it gets ripped a few days ago." Bucky explained as he starts inspecting the shirt for any other rip in it, causing Steve to press his lips tightly into a thin line as he gazed at the black shirt, he was sure that the shirt was familiar… it almost looked like the shirt dream-Bucky wore when he fought with dream-Tony.
His words made Rogers pause and he turned to Tony, and the man had to stop in his place as he took in Rogers's face, this was the first time that he actually saw Rogers's face without it being covered by his mask, and in the back of his mind, he grumbly admitted why everyone may have a small crush on the man. "Oh, hello, Mr. Stark, you arrived just in time, I was about to bury this poor animal." Rogers said as he gave a small (creepy, if Tony had anything to say) smile, lowering the box in the hole.
"Maybe…" Tony playfully answered, humming as he followed the trail that his fingers left, but with his lips this time, making his husband give a pleasant rumble deep from within his chest. "Saw you sleeping and couldn't help myself; you left yourself open for attacks, My Captain…" Tony purred his nosing around the bonding mark that had healed, leaving nothing but beautiful scaring on his husband's pale skin.
"Yeah, I am done…" As soon as Steve finished his sentence, a gunshot rang in the supermarket (Close to where Bucky and Steve were), causing panic and chaos to spread like wildfire. As soon as the screaming started, Bucky pulled Steve with him, protecting Steve with his body as he tried to pull Steve away from the deafening noise. Turning his head to see what the hells happened, Steve's eyes widen in shock when he saw the strange old man (Who gave Steve a gentle smile, the strange Beta who knew Steve's name when he shouldn't) getting shot once more before falling down, his white lab coat, getting stained red with blood.
"She… she abused Peter?" Tony asked shakily, getting a nod from the man as he tried to regain himself, taking a deep breath as he tried to calm himself before he detached himself from Tony's neck, kissing the Omega's temple before clearing his throat to start the tale once again.
Tony's eyes light at that and he nearly sob in relief, with shaky hand he took the phone and turn it around, it was strange kind of phone, it was small, not like the one his father owed, it made Tony wonder how much time passed since he was taken, but he shook the idea away for it doesn't matter, saving his baby was.
The office door was knocked on frantically then, causing Steve to flinch and turn to the door, relaxing slightly when he heard Bucky's frantic voice behind the door. "Oh thank God you two were OK." Bucky murmured when his eyes fell on Steve and Tony, who was frowning when he caught the sight of Bucky.
Natasha, as it seems, took it as her mission to interrogate him every time they were together, mainly to know more about the world he was from, it broke Steve's heart a little that the person he considered a best friend, always looked at him with suspicious eyes. "
It was like a normal day… or as much as normal it was considering that the first thing Steven after waking up was glaring at his counterpart with Peggy, daring the man to do something, to try something, which the man was smart enough not to dare them, Peggy made sure to pass on Steven's threat of ripping the man's knot perfectly.
As fast as he can, Tony tried to slam the door shut in the person's face, hoping that his sudden action would gain him a few more seconds to escape. The man on the other side though only held the door open and pushed the door with his shoulder, causing Tony to curse as he stumbled back and nearly fell on the floor if he didn't move in the last second. "How rude, is this how you treat your father after years of absence?" Howard sneer as he took a step inside the house, ignoring how Tony shivered and tried to cover his baby from Howard's sight. "So this was the place that Obadiah talked about… at least you knew where you belong," Howard stated in disgust, his eyes not straying too far from Tony who was frozen in his place, not knowing what to do or how to react.
It took three months before Steve, Tony, and newly cured Peter (The serum had worked and healed Peter, the day when the doctor said that their baby was all healed and healthy, was the day that Steve laughed and cried in happiness) before the went to the lake house in Ireland; and just as Steve's mother descript, the house, the land, the lake, it was beautiful and breathtaking, Steve even shed a few tears when his eyes fell on the house his mother and father lived in a long time ago.
He nearly broke all the ties with his friends, but still, they continue to be with him, standing by his side, refusing to let him wallow in grieve; refuse to leave him to depression…
Steve didn't know how long he stayed here with James's head in his lap, but it was long enough that the Alpha dozes off, his breath returning to normal which made the blond man hum a little and his hand reached one of the small pillows on the couch to put it under the Alpha's head, as he stood up after that and rushing to the kitchen.
"What was that for, Steven?" Peggy snapped when they were finally inside the workshop, though, Steven didn't answer her, too busy glaring at Tony, probably too angry to dress him down for breaking the promise that Tony promised Steven and Peggy.
"And in the unofficial records they were assassinated, right?" Steven asked which made Peggy pause and nod her head which made Steven press his lips tightly. "Does Tony know about that?" Steven asked already fearing the answer, and when Peggy shook her head no, it made Steven take a harsh breath. "How… how was Tony's relationship with his parents?" Steven finally dared to ask, already wondering how he will stop the next disaster; he didn't want another Civil War with Tony's heartbreaking about the truth of his parents' death.
The next time Tony opened his eyes, he was surrounded by the team, aunt Peggy was looking at him with happy tears in her eyes, Bucky was in the back looking at his with guilty look, the Hulk and Thor were both there too, but Tony could only look at the sky and let out a laugh, his prayers were answered…
Steve is 30 years old. Tony is 40 years old. Peter is 10 years old but he looks like seven or eight years old. Bucky is 31.
"Explain what?" Tony hissed, holding Morgan tightly in his arms, afraid of letting her go, fearing that they would take her away from him. "Explaining about how you lied to me for months? Explaining about the monster that lived in the lake and how you practically throw me to him on a silver plate? Explaining how you are planned on killing me if I discovered your secrets that you tried to hide? Or how about the monster living in the lake is no other than Steven Grant Rogers?" Tony ended up shouting, taking in the shocked faces that were looking at him. "What are you going to explain? Come on, enlighten me! Tell me!" Tony screamed, glaring at Peggy and Bucky, as he held his crying baby tightly, his nerves were already frazzled enough after seeing Steven Rogers.
The door behind him opened, but Tony didn't give it any mind, too busy trying to write and rewrite the codes in front of him, trying to find if something went missing or if he had to find another power source for the A.I. to function on. The Space Stone was Tony's first choice, but so far, Tony doesn't know what will happen to Steve if they tried to take the stone away from him, so far no one dared to touch the stone ever since Steve overcome its power.
Opening the door, Tony was greeted with the sight of Natasha and police chief Fury, forcing him to blink at the both of them. “Sorry to wake you up early, lad.” Fury said, and Tony wanted so much to ask them what this was about. Why are they here? He wanted to ask them if the reason they were here was about last night if they learned what happened. “… We received a number of complaints from the neighbors living here, apparently a group of teenagers decided it will be fun to go and terrorize the tenants living near you. Did anything happen last night? Strange noises you heard? Breaking in? Any unusual activity you noticed?” Fury asked, and Tony couldn’t help but remember last night’s events, doubting what happened to him was just a joke from the local kids who decided and try to play Halloween.
"Is that so?" Stane whispered in Tony's ear and he flinched at the closeness of the bigger man, and he took an unconscious step toward the lake. Suddenly a strong wind came and nearly knocked Tony down, trees rustled and leaves start falling down the trees who were shaking like they were going to fall; when Tony strained his ear his body froze when he heard the familiar rustling he usually hears under his house, Stane seemed to pick up on it too, because when he turned around and gaze at the place with a strange look on his face. "Who is there?" Stane snarled as he turns around waving his gun.
"No… Steve, please, don't you remember what you said; together." Tony whispered, his unoccupied hand going to Steve's cheek caressing it softly, his eyes pleading with Steve, begging him not to go. "We said we would do this together, Steve, we can do it, please don't go." Tony tightened his hand on Steve's, his eyes pleading and pleading and Steve, Steve wanted to cry, he wanted to curse and weep and hide with Tony, Peter, and their family, but no, Steve was not going to risk their lives, not against Thanos.
"You are awake my queen." He turned his head when he heard the familiar voice talk, a small smile taking over his face as he saw who the speaker was, the young adult who called him was bowing for him, but he can see the small relieved smile on her face, and the happiness of seeing him shining in her eyes.
Steve shiver at that and turn his attention to the Omega and pup, the pup who had the smell of death surrounding him, the pup who was too small that Steve would have mistaken him as two years old, the pup who was scrunching his nose like he was about to wake up… that made Steve's breath nearly leave him as he saw the pup blinks tiredly. "Mama…" The kid muttered, trying to wake the Omega, Steve swallowed at that and he gasped softly as the pup raises his head toward him. "C-Cap…?" The kid stuttered, raising his hand toward Steve, he didn't know what took over him, but Steve took the child's small hand in his, which only made the kid tear up. "You are 'ere…" The kid sniffed, looking at the Silver Star that dominates the front of Steve's suit.
"Fine, just a headache…" Steve said through his teeth, he couldn't say to them that the sound of singing was getting louder and louder, that Steve thought his eardrums were about to explode, that instead of a melodic singing it was a shrieking plea. Steve just swallowed, hoping nausea would pass away soon.
“He did what!” The Alpha snarled, practically causing Tony to jump in fear, his body frozen in place as he gazed at Sarah waiting for what the woman will do. “Doesn't he ever learn? Did he even think about Peter before thinking about his knot? Does he want a repeat of what happened years ago? Is-“ Before Sarah can continue with her rant, Tony cut her with a snarl. He couldn’t believe that Sarah will say such a thing; he couldn’t even fathom how she insulted her only son just because he decided to move on; that is not her being protective of her son, that was her being controlling! And for what? Because Steve was in one failed relationship, it suddenly means that his sense of judgment was bad? What happened to Sarah? This was not the woman that Tony met and looked up to.
"No, everything is fine, just work-related stuff. I'm going for a little while Becca, can you guys manage by your own for a little?" Steve asked which made the Alpha pause a little sending a glare toward the man before nodding her head, which made Steve smile at her as he wore his black running shoes and took his keys and wallet. "Good. You fuck face, move it and give me the letter!" Steve snapped as he pushed the Alpha after snatching the letter ignoring the small growl the Alpha gave, but he followed him anyway and pointed to the black car he wanted Steve to ride in, all the while trying to ignore the Omega's glare that was making him uncomfortable.
His mother and Angie had left this morning, they both have important jobs to attend to, his mom refused to leave him at first, it was until Tony begged her to just leave and go home to rest and shower and Jarvis promised to stay here with Tony that Maria and Angie left, all of his family had spent this three weeks attached to his bed, and it made feel like an invalid, like the weak person he was, it made him hate himself a little bit more.
"Y-yes… t-thank you, Sir…." Steve's voice cracked as he gave the newspaper back to the man, turning away and start wheeling himself as far away as he can while ignoring the man behind him that seemed to want him to stop. Steve doesn't know how long he wheeled himself around Brooklyn, he was dazed half of the time and when Steve finally snapped out of it, he saw himself in Central Park which ended with Steve giving a confused noise as he looked around, wondering how an hour and a half went without him noticing.
His son looked at him with huge brown eyes, too big and innocent making Tony open both of his eyes this time and kisses his son on the forehead, which made his baby give a toothy grin. "Cap… Mama alwa… Mama says cap stowies lots… 's cap Papa?" Tony froze at that looking at his son with opened mouth.
"Morgan… is she… is she Steven Rogers's daughter?" Tony asked instead of thinking about Angie's words, he doesn't think he has it in him to believe anything Bucky and Peggy said, not after hiding everything from him. Angie on the other hand, did warn him a few times, she even told him the rules of the lake to protect him, so maybe… just maybe; he can trust her words.
Steve didn't care about the nurses snapping at him or even the guards that no doubt were following him, thinking that he was a crazy maniac with a bomb. "Where is he?" Steve called out when he finally saw Natasha and Clint talking to each other with serious faces, which made Steve's heart jump at that.
"Papa, what's dis?" Peter said as he turned to Steve who was sitting beside Tony and Peter, the small pup was sitting in his mother's lap, looking out of the car's window, asking everyone about what he was seeing, every time the limo passed something strange in the pup's eyes.
"Rude!" Tony called out, rising the baby toward Steve which made the man pull away from the boy but stopped when Tony pout at him; Tony can see the hesitate and dislike in his husband's eyes, and he had to stop himself from laughing out because his husband was in for a surprise. The baby to his credit only gazed at Steve with curious eyes, taking the man in as he gurgled and cooed.
"I know!" Tony choked holding his son tightly. "Mama can defend himself! You should have listened to me! You nearly get hurt! What will Mama do if something happened to you? Tell me!" He said trying to pull his son into his lap.
Clint heard a voice behind him saying those same words Natasha said, making him turn around to see Thor… whose body was sewn together like he was a Frankenstein monster. Thor though only tilted his head and grin, ignoring the horror and sick look that took over Clint's face.
"I am fine; I have been telling everyone that. They are overreacting, I just fainted because of the heat, and I didn't need to be brought to the hospital for nothing." Tony huffed, a smile stretching on his lips as he leaned up to kiss Steve, which caused the Alpha to hum and lower his head, kissing Tony deeply on the lips before pulling back and nuzzling his right cheek. After assuring himself that his mate was fine, he then lower his head and kissed his kids on the forehead, telling them how proud they were and how brave they are. "So, am I going to go home, now?" Tony asked, leaning on Steve and widening his eyes, hoping that Steve would hear his plea.
"I gave you the serum, I'm sure that you remember that much at least." Howard state, annoyance and resignation clear in his voice, like Howard, spent all the time Steve was unconscious repeating his words over and over again. "You nearly died; you couldn't handle the serum and the poison at the same time, your heart was about to explode, but you survive somehow…
But Steve never came back, he never returned and Anthony hated the desperation he felt every day that passed, when he was interviewed one day, he hoped against all hope that Steve will come back when he saw the changing man he becomes, when the woman interviewed him and called him Anthony, something in him snapped, he didn't want to be called by that name, because it made his Omega run away from him, so what use it was? Maybe choosing another name will bring Steve back. So he told the woman to call him "Tony" Anthony became Tony Stark that day, Tony Stark was a billionaire, playboy, genius. Tony Stark was superior, he was the king, he was everything that Anthony was not, and the most important, he wasn't weak…
The woman closed her eyes and took a deep breath before going to the door, and opened it, ignoring Howard's piercing look as she entered the room he was in and closed the door behind her looking at the Alpha's eyes with her tired ones, the older woman just walked until she seat on the other side looking at Howard straight in the eyes. "Why?" Maria could only say after a while of silence, and she didn't know what that question was for, why did you change? Why were you so cruel? Why did you destroy Tony's life? Why did you destroy his mate's life? A lot of questions in just one single word… it was funny in some twisted way. "So you are not going to talk? Nothing? Not after destroying our son and his mate's life, after you destroyed your grandson's life." That got a reaction out of Howard which was him glaring at Maria which the Omega ignored.
The Alpha let out a happy sigh that turned into a moan when the Omega starts massaging his scalp, letting out happy noises when the Omega didn't stop. "Amazing… Peter was amazing… he is so smart, smarter than me even…" Tony murmured as his eyes took in the beautiful Omega in front of him, wondering if their talk yesterday after Barnes left was working somehow, I mean the Omega did let him stay the night before, they did talk most things through before the Omega shy from a few topics, and the Omega did let him spend time with his son, and was massaging his scalp! So maybe… the Alpha let out a sigh as he melted into the sofa, a reaction that Tony always has because of Steve's magical hands.
Peter looked at the ground before looking at Tony with a small pout on his face, nearly making Tony melt. "But… I wanted to thank you… for what you did…" The pup mumbles and looked at Tony with big brown eyes which did make Tony melt and he kneeled down to be in level with the small pup.
(See the end of the chapter for
' that without giving Tony the facts he wanted and needed. Natasha and Clint were also out, Natasha because she has too much attachment to Bucky and Peggy to not be affected by their words, and Clint because he does whatever his wife wanted from him, even if it meant lying. The same could be said about the rest of the people in the town; even Angie, Tony can't really trust her word not to be affected by her friendship with Peggy. No, what Tony need is someone not invested in Steven Rogers, what Tony need is someone who won't be afraid of giving him the facts and harsh truth; what Tony needed is someone who is old… old enough to know Steve Rogers when he was alive, but has a neutral opinion on him that won't cloud Tony's judgment…
"How did you… arrive here?" This time the one who spoke was the woman with the red, white, and blue colors, and Steven nearly sang in joy that at least someone still retains a little smart to try and help him discover what the hell happened to him and try and get him home, it's better than having the son of Odin panic every time Steven took a breath.
"Can I?" Steve whispered, his eyes not leaving the baby as his hands raised of their own will to take the baby from Becky. As soon as he touched the baby's small hand, Steve felt like electricity ran through his body, his breath hitching as he felt his tears running down his face without his permission when the baby smiled and waved his tiny fists around the place… what caused Steve to flinch so harshly that he pushed his wheelchair back and became unbalanced that fell off it and hit his head on the ground, was the familiar sound he nearly forgets its existence…
"We can't! We brought breakfast from Angie's diner, you know it's a sin to let it get cold and not enjoy it while it was hot, right?" Clint grinned, which made Tony narrow his eyes, only opening the door and invite them when the two of them showed him the goods, and Tony's mouth watered, his tummy made grumbling sound, making the teen flush when Natasha sent him a knowing look.
So what do you think?
The gentle hand left his hair and trailed softly to caress his cheek, causing Tony to let out a content sigh and snuggle into the warm and soft hand; part of Tony gave a soft purr in content at the lovely treatment, another part of him wanted to know who was the person who was treating him with such gentleness.
"The heat you say? Then why didn't they discharge you unless they think something is wrong?" Steve asked, running his hand through the kids' hair before nuzzling Tony's neck, causing the Omega to grumble and huffing, probably annoyed that Steve didn't fall for his pleas.
"Hey, little one…" Steve's gentle voice made the pup look at his father with trembling lips, sniffing a little as he felt his father's hand running through his hair. "Why don't you hold the Shield for me for a bit? It will protect you and Mama if the bad guys tried to enter the room, what do you say?" Steve asked which made the pup pause a little, and then nod his head; he took the Shield from Steve and held it tightly hiding behind it, only letting out his head a little to watch the door.
"It is not about understanding your side; I get it, the two of you were angry that your best friend caused the death of your only son. And because Rogers is not even a human, you don't feel guilty for what you did; even when he was your best friend, what you feel guilty about is lying to me for so long." Stated Tony, getting uncomfortable by the second as he looked any other way than his friends; Tony had already considered every scenario there was after Natasha left. As much as the town's people hated Rogers for killing and taking many lives, it didn't stop them from worshipping him and seeking his protection; if you asked Tony, it was messed up, really messed up of them to use Rogers like that and then throw him away like a used tissue, all because of a fucked up person wanted the power Rogers was cursed with.
"We were finally able to stabilize him; the thing was the stab wound wasn't the problem." Bruce let out a tired sigh as he ran his hands through his hair like he was trying to gather his thoughts. "It seemed that the blade Steve was stabbed with had some kind of poison; we didn't know about until Steve starts screaming on the operation table. The poison is not like anything I saw before, whatever poison Hydra was able to create, it was bad, it's a slow working one, which seemed to burn the host from the inside out; I took some samples to try and find the antidote for it… but I… I…" Bruce's voice vanished, not that Tony was paying that much attention, his head was already in his hands, and for once in his life Tony's mind was blank. "You should stay with him…" Bruce ended up whispering, putting his hand on Tony's shoulder, squeezing it in reassurance before walking away, probably going to the labs to try and find the antidote.
"Well, it wasn't like it was my fault, to begin with! Everyone in this Goddamn mansion is in love with Rogers, hell even Pepper is in love with him; so why am I the one forced to marry him when I don't even want to do anything with him? He took me to the cemetery yesterday, the cemetery! I never sat a foot inside one since my parents died!" Tony ranted, huffing and puffing as he tried to calm himself trying to make Rhodey understand that he was tricked into this unwanted marriage.
"You can do anything you want; no killing and severe physical harm though, but I want him to suffer, do you understand?" Tony asked feeling like somehow he was a monster for wanting this, for wanting justice to descend upon the person who used him, he wanted justice from the person that took and took and never gave leaving Tony hating himself more and more as the days and years pass. Just this time, Tony promised himself, just an hour of revenge for the four years he spent in hell because of that monster. "His name is Ty Stone. Remember no killing." Tony reminded as he gazed at Steve whose eyes became feral and bloodthirst when he gained the name he was after.
"Peter!" Tony cried out as he tried to run to the burning mansion, only to get pulled away by Peggy and Bucky as the two of them tried to calm him and make him stop thrashing; not something that will happen, not until Tony has his son in his own arms. Tony should have stayed in the mansion, he should have stayed to protect Peter and Steve, but he didn't, he didn't, and now the two of them are in the burning mansion, probably dead. "Peter!" A sob left Tony as he tried to make Peggy and Bucky let go of him, but it wasn't working, the two of them had a strong grip on his armor, restraining Tony's movement.
So what do you think?
Tony shiver at the cold breeze that hit him; Winter was coming. Finally Tony arrived at his house, gazing around the place, blinking his eyes when he took in the place; nothing changed, everything was still the same as he left it back then. Taking a deep breath, Tony gather the courage to walk toward the house, taking in the gardens, taking in the house, and lastly, he took in the lake.
The door to Steve's home opened which made the Alpha jump and gaze at the Omega, looking at Steve with awe and amazement at how beautiful the Omega was, the Omega was wearing black dress pants and shoes and a blue button-down shirt with his hair being slicked back, giving him a sharp look… looking at the Omega, his heart pounded in his chest with nervousness and happiness, remembering the day that Tony proposed to the love of his life, looking at Steve now, Tony felt several underdressed in his Armani suit, maybe he should have worn something else…
' over and over again, causing Tony to stiffen a gasp and rush toward the boy, thinking that the boy hurt himself by stepping on the shared of the glass lettering the ground. "Harley, baby, tell me what's wrong?" Tony whispered his picking the boy up and put him on the couch checking for injuries and being grateful when he found none.
"Did we wake you up?" Bucky asked as he took the boxes of takeout from Peggy and headed to the kitchen, leaving Peggy holding the cherry pie they brought. Bucky's words only made sense after Tony yawn and rubbed his eyes trying to wake up.
It was a few days later that they returned to the mansion, with the little pup that Tony named Peter; the name gained a knowing smile from Steven that Tony was only now able to detect because of him eavesdropping on Steven and Peggy a few days later.
"A strange… w-woman… is t-trying to… hurt Tony." Harley managed to gasp through his harsh breath, trying to take a few deep breaths from his inhaler; his words caused Peter to choke and nearly run out of the door, causing Harley to curse and rush behind him, gasping when they reached Mr. Clint and Mr. Tony. The absence of the strange lady made Harley relax a little, but his breath left him a second time as soon as he saw Mr. Tony shaking before he fainted, causing Harley to freeze before letting out an alarmed cry followed by Peter who screamed and rushed toward Mr. Tony with tears in his eyes…
The first one is a post-Civil War story with dark Tony, and Hydra Steve from another dimension, not team Captain America friendly, or team Iron Man friendly, the story is the most sensitive and dark fic I wrote, so please read the warnings before reading.
Knowing Steve, his Omega needed space, and the minimal time someone can give him is three days sometime four, but Tony was too impatient, wanting to see his mate and pull his bambino in his arms peppering both of their faces with kisses, telling them how much he missed them, and how much he loved them more than the whole wide world.
"Eye-Patch!" James suddenly shouted as he pointed at Nicolaus, causing the Alpha to glare at the pup and send Steven an accusing look, which ended up with the Omega smiling in amusement. Count on his babe to be just like him, a blunt kid who calls them as he sees them; that was the same exact title he gave Nicolaus when he saw him for the first time, the difference was that his dam had pulled his ears for insulting the Alpha.
"Tony…" Betty sighed tiredly, her eyes taking in the Omega with wild hair and heated glare; Tony's heart did give a pang at the hurt look crossing his friend's eyes, but when it comes to the safety of his family Tony would stop at nothing to protect them even if it meant being at cross with his friends. "Look, I know you are close with Harley, but the thing is no one expected this outcome; besides we couldn't disturb the three of you in the middle of bounding!" Betty started to rub the tips of her fingers on her temples trying no doubt to prevent a headache.
So what do you think?
"Ha, ha, very funny." Steve raised his arms over his head and stretched his body, uncaring that everyone was gazing at him with strange looks. "I wanted to come and see what the sun looks like at this time of the day; I didn't think that I will see the prince of Asgard eloping alone to go home, not even a word of goodbye for poor old me." Steve rolled his eyes, giving the Avengers a cheeky grin showing them that he was joking with them.
Also, this is my first try at iOS messages, probably sucks at it, I know nothing about coding, the green text is SMS messages.
"Just because my father-" She was cut by a glass of water being thrown her way making her squeak and avoid it last she got smacked in her face, she looked at Steve who thrown the glass with a feared look.
Staying here was like Tony admitting defeat, sitting like a duck as he waited for Rogers to enter the house, but until Tony managed to gather his scattered thoughts, staying inside the house is better than staying frozen in his place outside until Rogers catches up to them. In and out, in and out; Tony breathed as he tried to calm himself, cooing and bouncing his baby as he tried to shush her cries and whines, trying to ignore how his child nearly ran toward the monster and jumped into his arms.
" Steven finally broke and said when he saw Margaret glaring at him with tears in her eyes daring him to lie to her.
Tony nodded his head after a few minutes of him thinking hard. "Thank you… for understanding…" Hearing that made Steven smile a little then he turned his head to Tony.
"E…e-Edith…" Steve gasped as he raised his head to look at the people that were throwing him concern looks, the room felt so small with so many people crowding his bed, Steve flinch as he felt Peggy's gentle hand on his knees. "I died Edith, I should have died! How am I still alive?" Steve asked with a touch of hysteria in his voice. Everyone flinch as they heard the statics coming from the speaker installed in the room, it made Steve take a deep breath thankful that his mind was distracted by something other than the panic he was feeling at the moment.
"Yes…" Steve ended up saying, which made the Omega, let out a hitched breath, and Steve hated himself, especially when he saw the unshed tears in the Omega's eyes, he can see Tony opening and closing his mouth like he wanted to say something but he can't, like words refuse to leave him.
"I do not know what you are implying by your words; for I have not touched any child of yours. I admit my actions against you were wrong, but you have no right to accuse me of such a thing." The king said darkly, raising his head and gazing at the Omega with a daring look; daring the Omega to lie and spread wrong words about him, something that did nothing but amuse Steven even more.
"You won't torture anyone in front of me?" Steve nods his head at Tony's question, his eyes serious as he gazed at him. "You won't kill, burn, bewitch, mental torture, curse, stab, hit, and terrify innocent people in front of me?" Tony pressed, causing Steve to press his lips tightly before he nodded his head in acceptance. "You won't hurt my family, friends, and the Avengers or curse them, even when they act out?" Tony raised his eyebrow when Steve looked like he swallowed a bitter lemon at this request; a few moments later Steve ended up sighing and nodding his head. "You will do all the major creepiness you Addams do and I can't handle behind my back, or where I can never see or witness by a chance?" Steve nodded his head happily before pausing looking at Tony with a look like with a frown like he was played. "Look, you can stab, kill, sacrifice, and do whatever an Addams do, but not in front of me. Creepy dolls? I can handle, ghost around the mansion? Fine. But never ever do something in front of me or it's over." Tony tried to ignore the star-struck look Steve send his way, walking faster trying to ignore the man behind him.
In the end, it took two weeks, numerous panic attacks, and hundreds of late-night talks for Tony to decide the next step he wanted to take. Tony would admit it was not the best time for him, especially when he was a mess half of the time; no doubts that Harley more than Peter thought his action was because of Peggy Carter if the sad and teary looks he was sending him was anything to go by. Steve's concern looks made everything worse, especially when Tony manage to see the guilt hidden in his eyes, probably the man thinks that it was his fault that his ex-wife finding them and stressing Tony until he fainted.
Hmmm, was I satisfied with this chapter and its ending? No, not really, I think it was rushed and not that well done… or maybe it was OK? I don't know.
"In the ocean, it tried to bite my leg so I bit him back! He tastes like chicken, so I thought I will make good sashimi out of it!" Steve said with a happy grin on his face, causing Tony to raise his two eyebrows so high, he was sure the two of them flow toward the sun. Because Tony sower to every God out there, the shark looked at him with puppy dog eyes, pleading for salivation in any form there is, it even start flopping its fins around and look at the ocean… was Tony imagining this, or did the sun really melt his brain?
"It's presents time!" Rhodey the energetic Alpha jumped around while still clutching Peter in his arms which made the pup laugh happily and start chanting the word 'Presents' with Rhodey which made the Omega roll his eyes at that but the smile refused to leave his face causing his family to exchange pleasant smiles.
"Oh…" Serpentine let out when a… she really doesn't really know how to describe the goo that came out of the bathroom… swamp monster (Crawled? Slide?) Letting out moans and groans as he continued his way, ignoring how the red spider passed out (Legs up) and how Bucky's fabric face turned purple with him holding his breath desperately. "OK… I can work with that." Serpentine shrugged, chanting a few spells she knew will reverse whatever her boy did to his friends.
"Umm Steve, why are we in the cemetery?" Tony asks as he followed Steve, blinking his eyes at the rows and rows of headstones he was forced to pass in the darkness of the night. The cemetery was really scary right now, especially with the crows and owls making it their mission to scare the crap out of Tony, who was trying hard not to latch into Steve and scream bloody murder; even after getting used to the Addams scary way of life, walking in the cemetery at night was something that Tony never dared to cross, especially after his parents died, because he was so sure that the two of them raised from the ground like a zombie and until this day no one believed him when he tells them that his parents run away from their burial place.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, fluff, sadness a lot of it, a little bit of violence, Steve being a BAMF, and Tony losing his mind! And let's not forget, Howard! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Reaching the man road, the Alpha had to stop himself from letting out an angry roar when he saw Hamar stepping on his babe's hand, while his baby was crying and trying to wiggle out of the lesser Alpha's hold, just as he was about to rush toward his son, an angry snarl was let loose, nearly causing him to shiver to the bones at the fury and rage it holds, and from the corner of his eye, he saw the foolish queen rush toward Hamar and tackling him to the ground, far away from his babe as he could.
Tony felt like a fairy tale prince when he had his first dance with Steve, so many emotions swirled inside Tony that it was a wonder how he didn't cry. After the amazing and heart fill wedding, the party after was one full of laughter and fun, causing Tony to laugh at his friends' actions, even Peter, who spend the day on a sugar rush, finding an excuse to eat as many cakes as he liked because it was 'Papa and Mama's wedding!'
"No, not a toy, but a star." Tony said and Steven can identify the soreness at the mention of it being a star, maybe being displeasing to be reminded by Steven even when the person who did it was his son; truthfully it wasn't even Steven this time or Thor who did the reminder, it was Peter, so Steven knows that Tony won't do a thing.
The letter said making Steve blink at that and cock his eyes in confusion, thanks to Peggy and Howard, who made Steve take a crash course in technology, Steve can perfectly understand what's happening before him, but what he doesn't understand was the computer turning on without powering it up, and who was Sir? It seems like he asked the question loudly because not a second later he read the answer.
That day ends up with Tony having shrapnel in his chest, and for that Bucky Barnes to lose his arm trying to protect him, surprisingly the terrorist took Bucky with him instead of shooting him and leaving him for death, probably thinking that they have a bargaining chip because the found Bucky on top of him protecting him.
As soon as Peter smelled that Steve was close he whined and tried to twist around, hand outstretches in the Alpha's direction which made the Alpha croon gently to the pup and walks toward the pup, looking at Tony asking for permission before taking the pup in his arms humming gently when Tony allowed him to hold the pup rocking the pup back and forth whispering that it was OK until the pup calmed down. "The reporter took a picture of Peter." Tony's voice cracked as he said that looking at his son who was snuggling into Steve.
Thankfully, Pepper, sweet merciful Pepper saw him struggling and came to his rescue! Good, because Tony was about to growl and storm away from the woman he was talking with, something which would have probably cause scandal because he was sure that the woman he was talking to was the wife of some general or something. "Stop pouting Tony." Pepper smiled, her eyes were twinkling like she knew something that Tony didn't.
"Not important for you to know." The woman stated as she stood up, tilting her head to the side as she studied Tony with a frown on her face. "So you are the Normal, my cousin is in love with… interesting." The woman stated as she starts circling Tony, whose eyes widen and realization struck him.
Steve swallowed at that and went to Jarvis touching him on the shoulder. "Come with me, let's bring them coffee," Steve stated, making Jarvis paused a little looking at the group, he let out a tired sigh and followed Steve who went to the staff room to brew coffee.
Peter only tilted his head in confusion and wonder, it was a few seconds later before his eyes widen and his mouth dropped. "You guys got married! Only married people sleep in the same bed!" Peter squealed happily and Tony pale as he heard his son's words wondering who told his baby this. "Aunt Peggy, Uncle Bucky! Daddy and Mr. Steve got married!" Peter squealed as he rushed out of the room leaving Steve and Tony to scramble for the pieces of clothes littering the ground, planning on dressing up quickly before running after Peter.
It was a long and hard, that Tony wanted to cry, was it too much to be left alone so he can go and search for Steve? Tony was about to call it a quiet and activate the suit that was in the suitcase near his legs when Bruce, who was helping Pepper and Tony sort through the papers paused. "Tony, there is an old letter here for you…" The Beta said which made Tony blink and looked at the man.
Much to Steven's displeasure, he was stuck on Midgard. And how delightful it was? After Mrs. Barnes
Tony is having a baby!
A few seconds will tick by on the digital display, Tony usually will gaze at that clock hoping that time will run faster and that his time with the doctor will end so that he may leave and never think about this session like he did the others, but he already knows that he was lying to himself, that he will think about this hour over and over again dissecting every small detail when he was back in the safety of his lab, or in the boxing ring when he will scream at the Alpha to attack harder, only for the Alpha to frown and then hold him, never caring about Tony breaking down and crying on his chest after.
/Warning/: This Chapter contains, cursing, sadness, fluffy fluff! Peter being a precious bean, maybe a little bit of violence? And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Yes… it is Mama's Shield…" James offered distracted by the Shield, his small fingers tracing the star with wide eyes, and opened mouth, looking like he saw Odin in the flesh. That piece of information made Anton stop in his place, gazing at the Shield with a wondering look. The queen's Shield? How can Steven use a Shield like this? A piece of metal that offers no control to its user, was useless, so why? Was this some kind of Asgardian weapon of choice? A weapon that only those raised in the mountains knew how to use and mold?
Steve's lips trembled, tears were running down his face as he tried to ignore the insisting knocking on the door with every second that passed; Steve wanted this to be over, he wanted this to stop, Steve knew that he was an idiot and that a divorce is in his path, but for the next few days, Steve wanted to play pretend and ignore that his husband and lover of seven years was going to leave him.
Steven's lips twitched up into a gentle smile, feeling amused by his son's actions and words. "I see; is Petrus still here, though?" Steven asked which earned him a nod from James, as the boy pointed to the door like he was informing him that Petrus was waiting outside of it. "Can you call him, please?" Steven gave his boy a small smile, his words caused James to pause for a second before he nodded his head and get off the bed, rushing to the door.
At first, Bucky didn't answer for a long time, making Steve think that his question will remain unanswered, only for Bucky to clear his throat and shift, turning to Steve with soft eyes. "Well, other than the fact that I'm the kid's uncle and wanting to be the first one to know the gender… I think you deserve more than being left alone to deal with everything while my brother gets his shit back under control; besides, I like you, so being outside with you is no hardship at all." Bucky stated, making Steve flush pleasantly at the sincere tone the Alpha used; Steve won't admit that it made him happy that at least someone seemed to understand and want to be there for him, it really made him happy.
Steve smiled as he saw that the phone was his, it seems like Natasha had finally fixed the phone. "Why don't you look at that…?" Steve teased the woman making her roll her eyes, but smile at the same time; she went to give Angie and Peggy a hug before leaving the room. "Where is the pup?" Steve asked Jarvis who was waiting near one of the windows in the private room.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, violence, mention of characters' death, anxiety, mention of chemotherapy, near mental breakdown, and who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
I hope I was able to help by doing this
A chill went down Tony's spine, and this time it wasn't from the cold or from the fear he felt from Stane, no this was different… someone, no, some
"Yes, the little fella here is smart, but I had to say I am sorry Tony, I can't let you steal the pup, I still need him to make me an evil plan to rule the world." Steve said as he raises the pup in the air which got a laugh from the pup as he tried to squirm from the Alpha's grip only to fail.
Before Wanda succeed in perfecting her spell to make the Avengers relife their worst nightmares, Steve manage to snap from his shock, pulling a sliver of the Space Stone's power, mixing the power of the stone with his pure magic before attacking the witch, throwing her away from the Avengers making her slam hard and dent the wall behind her. Taking this as his chance Steve purged all of her tainted magic away from the communal floor, clearing the air around them and the Avengers' minds at the same before they fall prey to her magic.
"How are they?" Jarvis whispered as he entered the room and closed the door behind him, smiling at the sight of Steve being clung to by the Omega and pup.
He was really an idiot; Steve was the real idiot in all of this and everything that happened was his fault. Just a month, only one more month and Steve was going to have his daughter in his arms, and already Steve screwed everything up. His daughter was going to grow up without her father, she is always going to ask about her father and why he wasn't there with them, and when she was going to learn the truth, she was going to hate Steve and despise him for what he did.
"A toy?" Steven asked wanting to extend his help, wondering if a toy was worth all the tears that the kid shed but he will help get this toy back if only just to stop the boy from feeling down. Tony though sigh at the question shaking his head, running his hand on Peter's back to calm him further, certainly this was the most civil conversation they had since the two of them met and that was only for Peter's sake.
"He knows about his father… Anthony Carbonell." Steve ends up saying after a while of silence making Tony lower his head trying to hold a new wave of tears, because if it was a known truth between Steve, Tony was not Anthony Carbonell anymore, that man died ten years ago and Tony Stark was born. "He doesn't know you other than a superhero and well…" Steve let out an empty laugh at that. "I don't even know how to tell him the truth when the only thing he has of his father is an old picture." That made Tony nod his head leaning on the counter behind him… it was a miracle that Steve was talking to him, let alone telling him about their son, so Tony had no right to feel as heartbroken as he does now.
Suddenly the Captain laid his baby on the ground and flipped over which made him fall on his back which made Peter blink and turns around to look at the Captain. "Go easy on me, big fella, I am old." Steve said with a smile as he gazed at Peter while tilting his head, making the boy's eyes widen like saucers, and for his jaw to drop, Tony even saw sparkles in there, his baby was already believing that he was the one who flipped Captain America.
"It does not matter, he is here now… you should know, foolish king, an oath breaker is not welcomed in any land he travels to, and misfortune will follow them wherever they settle," Steven stated, taking a small stone beside him and throw it in the lake, gazing at the ripple that was caused by the stone dropping in the lake. The king shuffled beside Steven, making the Omega close his eyes and letting out a tired sigh. "Just ask the question on your mind, your movements are annoying me," Steven opening his eyes and gazing at the lake once more.
Ever since Steve entered Tony's room the first time… he didn't stop coming back… ever since that night he met JARVIS and Dum-E, he couldn't handle being away from the room. It was like safe heaven to Steve, a security blanket, the only place he knows that he wasn't going to get fingers pointing at him, leading him to more madness…
"Is very yummy, thank you, Mr. Stark!" Harley said after he finished his waffles, his eyes automatically going to the cheesecake a waitress put on the table near them, and he gulps, causing Tony to bite his lower lip to stop it from trembling. His phone felt like a brick pulling him down, making him try to hold his screams as he waited for a letter from Betty, waiting for her response and hoping that all this was just a misunderstanding and that Harley hadn't run away.
Sorry for the short chapter… again….
And finally when the party nearly winded down Steve and Tony sneaked away from their friends and family, wanting to have their alone time; both of them vibrating with anticipation and longing, for tonight it will be the night the two of them will finally dare to touch each other in the way the two of them longed for, for two years now.
"Central Park…" Tony said which made Steve give a big smile and then the three of them went to park their car in the nearest place to central park, it didn't take them a long time before the three of them were walking through the park, taking in the changes. And Tony had to hold his grin as he walked beside the people with no one knowing who he was or stopping him, he held Peter tightly humming happily at the awe he saw in his baby's eyes as he took everything in.
"Can we please cut this short? Like very short? With you going straight into your demands instead of a monologue about your evil plans to rule the world?" Tony cut the man before he started over his evil plans, which made the man narrow his eyes at Tony while glaring at the man like he was something nasty he found under his shoe, which was rude mind you.
Reaching his house, never felt like a death sentence until now, probably because his mind loved torturing him and remind him that the only reason he even bought it was for his baby to grow up in a nice place, not a penthouse in Manhattan or his father's mansion, always big and empty and made Tony felt like he was the only one in the world without someone there for him. Tony let out a sigh as he forced himself to enter the house, hoping against hope that Pepper and her daughter had left, just so that Tony can cry in peace.
So what do you think?
Arriving at the roof, Tony went to search for Peter; already thinking about the long talk he was going to have with his son for scaring him like this. Finding Peter, Tony stood still when he found his son hugging his legs and gazing at the yellow roses with a sad look on his tired face. Seeing his baby like this was enough for the fight to leave Tony and for him to rush toward his baby, how could Tony be so distracted that he didn't notice his baby was hurting?
1989. Steve becomes the CEO and The Starks and Peggy went into hidden, Tony gives birth to Peter by the end of the year…
Snarled a familiar voice making Tony flinch, an action that Steve noticed too well, for he turned to Stane and gave him a look; if Stane was alive he would have been dead all over again.
Bótey: Betty Ross who is Bruce's wife.
"Steve?! What did happened? Why are you here at this time?" That was Natasha's concerned and alarmed voice causing Steve to blink his eyes and gaze at the woman with a blank look, not knowing how he reached Natasha's apartment when he was sure that he was still in his car not a few moments ago. "Steve, honey, what's going on?" Natasha asked him in a calm voice, causing the tears that Steve finally managed to hold back to slide down his face once more as he starts crying harder and harder into Natasha's embrace…
The next month turned out to be more peaceful than Tony imagined; which he was thankful for. The earth was still spinning, Tony still has his baby that he was trying to take care of, the town is peaceful and quiet with many friendly faces who won't hesitate to lend a helping hand, and Tony was becoming fatter every day; other than the important issue of him getting fat, everything is good, more than good, it was fantastic, and Tony was finally getting the sleep he deserves.
"Let me go!" The sound of a whine from across the street made Tony stop in his place and look around to see what was going on, only for his heart nearly to stop at what he saw, a man was dragging pup from his hand… anyone seeing this would have thought of the man as the pup's father because of the brown hair and the brown eyes, they will just think that the pup was unruly and was throwing tantrum… but Tony knows that pup, he recognized the small toy the pup had in his hand, he knows what the pup's father looks like, the man who was trying to drag the pup brushing people's concern telling them about this being all a tantrum the pup was throwing, how could no one realize that this was wrong? How could no one smell the scent of fear from the pup? How are they letting the man drag the pup away?
Steve paused at the question not knowing what to do, should he tell his baby that his father had left them, or should he tell him that he died? After all, both answers were correct to some extent, his Anthony Carbonell had left him alone in this world, he died when he refused to answer Steve's pleas and letters, Steve was only nineteen and a half when he realized that he was pregnant, he was still a child himself, and a year later Tony Stark appeared to the world. "He is abroad… working." Steve ends up saying which made Peter look at him with wide eyes. "Your Daddy was an inventor baby, the best of the best, so Wakanda…" Steve had always told his baby the stories that the kind doctor had told him years and years ago, Steve made sure to pay his respect to the kind doctor every time he went to visit his mother, because if it wasn't for the older man and his kind heart, Steve would have been stuck in that shitty apartment struggling. "They plead with him to come and help them because they wanted to teach their daughter the princess how to become the best engineer… he will come when he finished his work there." Steve ends up saying which made Peter's eyes sparkle which joy and he starts asking Steve to tell him more about his father, Steve hated himself for lying, but…
"Peter, sweetie, go and wait for me in Daddy's room, I will come to get you shortly." Steve smiled at the boy, shaking the raccoon in his hand harshly when the rodent tried to bite his hand; hearing those words made Peter pout and try to look at Steve with the most heartbreaking puppy eyes. "If you do, I will take you to the park tomorrow." That got Steve a grumble from Peter before the boy nodded his head and rushed toward his and Tony's room. Steve stayed until he made sure that Peter locked the door before he turned his gaze to the raccoon who gulped at his dark look. "So… where were we?" Steve hissed, tightening his hold on the raccoon before going to the elevator.
, Clint was sitting in front of her snapping his fingers, trying to snap her out of the trance she was in or stop her whimpering… which was a feat considering that she was a scary assassin and was reduced to a whimpering mess by Steve, no less… he now knows how Rogers put the fear of God in that woman.
Sorry for the late update but you know… life…
Bucky's frantic voice caused Steve to sniffle and nod his head, trying to stop another full-bodied flinch when he heard the crash coming from the kitchen, informing Steve that his stalker found the boiling kettle. Steve didn't know how long he waited inside the locked bathroom hearing the cursing and furniture crashing outside, wondering when would Bucky arrive and save him, but the knock on the bathroom door, nearly made Steve jump off his skin, his heart dropping in his stomach at the realization that he was found.
Tony was so preoccupied with walking and dragging the heavy suit that he didn't notice the crater in front of him until he was about to fall in it which made him nearly made him have a heart attack if he didn't hold into the suit for dear life. Not that the danger of falling to his death was over, Tony cursed himself for not noticing the fucking hole in the ground that was probably three miles wide and a mile deep, how didn't he notice it? That was the question.
"Bucky…" Steven gently whispered; his words seemingly settled on deaf ears as the soldier sway before striding toward Steven, straddling his lap, not a few moments afterward, making Steven tense like a bow. "Bucky, don't do this; I can get us out of here." Steven hissed when he felt Bucky moving his hips, rubbing down on his prick, making Steven feel sick to the bones when he felt wetness soaking through his slacks; the knowledge that Bucky, his best friend, and brother forced to this, was enough to snap Steven, he bites his tongue harshly when he realized how glossy Bucky's eyes were, noting how drugged and out of it he undoubtedly was, and it made him wonder if Zola had adopted the same tactics in his universe too, a reflection that made the beast in his rage. "I'm sorry, Buck." Steven whispered as he leaned closer to Bucky, forcing him to let out a gasp when he breathed the hated trigger words in Bucky's ears, hoping that they were the same in this universe.
"Wow, if I know you will be all fired up about me having a vacation, I would have taken one sooner." Tony murmured kissing Steve's forehead, causing the Omega to blink his eyes and look at Tony; the sleepiness leaving him as confusion took over him.
"That's the thing, Mr. Wilson, I don't have any photos," Tony informed the social worker, which made the Beta raised his eyebrow and give Tony a long look, questioning, studying. "The thing is my father or his partner I don't know the full details gave my pup to another family in a closed adoption without my consent, taking advantage of me being underage at the time of the birth," Tony stated which made Sam wince at Tony's tale, unfortunately, a lot of parents using the advantage of their children being underage to give their pups away, this wasn't the first story, nor would it be the last, but he hoped that things changed in the years that will come…
The rest of the day was a blur, but Tony was sure that most of the town knew about his baby girl, Angie gave him free food that will last him a month, Clint and Natasha bickered about what to give to his baby girl as a present until they settled on teaching her karate and archery when she is born, Peggy hugged him tightly, while Bucky ruffled his hair, Pepper and Rhodey refused to leave him alone, it was fun, and Tony can say that he was truly happy that day.
Steve's laugh was as light and airy, captivating as he seemed to shine brightly and beautifully, Tony knows without a doubt that everyone must have realized that Steve was another being completely, especially when his glow seemed to lighten the entire ballroom the gala was taken place in. Tony wondered if people lost their breath as they gazed at Steve who seemed happy and carefree at this moment without the world weighing him down.
The sound of whimpering caught Tony's attention, causing him to tighten his grip on his ax, planning on swinging it on the first person he sees, not caring if they were Zemo or not, he wanted blood and he would get the blood he want. Holding his growl, Tony walked toward the source of whimpering, a harsh frown on his face as he arrived toward the source, only to see nothing but boxes. Raising his eyebrow, Tony tilted his head to the side, wondering what kind of thing would hide here, was it possible that Tony found a puppy or a cat on the verge of death? That thought caused a dark smile to paint Tony's face; with a hum, he moved the ax in his hand pushing the boxes away from his path, boredom coloring his face when he reached the last box.
"Good morning," Steve whispered back, giving a soft purr when Tony started kissing the back of his neck, an action that caused Steve to sigh and snuggle back into Tony. "Tony let go… I need to start breakfast soon," Steve said as he tried to stretch; as much as Steve loved to spend the day in bed with Tony, Steve needed to start breakfast soon, he was hungry, and the baby was hungry, let's not forget Bucky who was probably starting coffee now. "Besides, we are going to choose a baby name for our daughter today, and you promised to help Bucky decorate our daughter's room," Steve stated causing Tony to sigh before letting go of Steve.
The king had to say the queen was a strong one, it took Thor and Loki coming to help them to be able to hold the Omega back; not that it did much help as the queen thrashed and screamed, cursing Tyber and insulting him, lumping Anton with him when the Alpha continued to pull the thrashing Omega away from the crowd that kept on getting larger and larger. Good Gods this was turning into a nightmare.
"She was a mean lady." James peeped which made the Omega sigh at that and gave his babe a look, telling him to stop, he doesn't want the Alpha to lash if the woman was a family. "She said a lot of mean things before she left us too." James not paying attention to Steven's warning said which made the Alpha narrow his eyes with hum at that, though he didn't do anything which made the Omega relax a little.
The second surprise started with Natasha; Tony was going to the kitchen, planning on maybe stealing a piece of bread or two for his lunch, unfortunately, his stash of food had run out. Walking to the kitchen, Tony was hoping that he will be alone; it was ages since he walked into his house without looking over his shoulder preparing for death.
So what do you think?
"Are you sure about this?" Steve asked after breaking the kiss, pulling Tony toward him, getting nothing but a cheeky smile from the Omega who then crawled in his lap and start kissing him once again, causing Steve to let out a happy sigh, nuzzling Tony's cheek after they broke the kiss.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, hello, I guess? Please come in, cold weathers are bad for the baby." Steve said after shaking the man's hand, feeling his baby shiver against him, his apartment was shitty that was sure, but at least it had a decent heating system if you didn't go out in the hallways that it, the lawyer blink and nod his head at that entering the apartment and closing the door behind him looking around the place as he did. "Sit here sir; do you want water, tea?" Steve asked getting a headshake from the man who looked around the place.
The only bright spot in all of this madness was the little fella Peter, an energetic kid he was, the only one who treat him like he wasn't planning for a war every time he spoke with him. Part of Steven wondered how an annoying person like Tony got such a gentle and charming boy as his son, a mystery that Steven will never be able to discover. Though the next few days Steven was a concern for how somber Peter became; were before he was all beams and giggles and cuddles, now the child will gaze at the sky now and again, sniffling before turning to whatever he was looking at before he starts again. It made Steven wonder if Tony noticed, but who was he kidding? That thickheaded man won't notice a thing if it didn't hit him in the head.
"I love you…" Those words were said in such a serious voice it made Tony's heart skip a beat, especially looking at the serious look in Steve's eyes. "I don't want to lose you, and if I had any chance for you accepting me as a potential spouse then I will take it, even if it meant changing who I am." Steve stated, and Tony had to stop himself from face-palming with both of his hands, maybe even slap some sense into Rogers.
So what do you think?
"Pierce happened." Fury spat, slamming his cup down, his face darkened even more at the mention of the man that was the reason for Rogers's death. "Pierce was… he was looked up to by many people in the town, he was a man with a bright idea for the future, promising our town many good changes and even made it true on some of his promises; it was obvious that people all around him were going to protect him and his reputation of being a good man. What we didn't know, was that everything he has done was only for his personal gain and for manipulating the town." Fury explained, making Tony frown, already thinking back about what he read on Pierce.
Today started well. Steve spent some of his time with Peter, drawing with the small boy who seemed to finally gain his old happy self back, something that made Steve overjoy. Steve even managed to spend some time with Peggy and Bucky, he hadn't seen these two for ages now, and seeing them again after so long was fun in a way, especially when Steve considered them to be his dear friends (Even when the Avengers are the only real friends that Steve have in a very long, long time) and then look and behold, Steve finally met the famous Pepper Potts.
It had been two weeks since Steve asked Tony for the dance, two weeks of him fretting when he remembered that he doesn't even know any proper dances from this time, and Steve was sure that Tony won't appreciate the old dances that Midgard dance hundreds of years ago. Before Steve did something rash and regrets his life choices, he decided to man up and went to Peggy for help.
"…I felt like shit, especially when the Omega came into my office with a gift bag, hoping to see his pup, a gift bag! That contains a toy, and when I ran to return it, the Omega took it and ran away!" Sam sniffed taking another swing, Bucky nods his head not caring that much, after all, he heard a lot more sad stories when he was overseas, and this one was just like any other he heard… or maybe that was his drank mind as the Alpha had gone for the strong stuff first, trying to lessen the horror he felt when his Ma told him about how he should date Steve, and that he and the Alpha will make a great couple, especially raising Peter who adored Bucky… he needs another drink… Steve, on the other hand, runs his hand through his beard thinking, he hasn't drunk anything other than that one beer Loki gave, so he was left to listen to Sam and hopefully give a piece of advice that wouldn't make him feel like shit. "And then… and then I found this paper lying on the floor, and felt even more like a shit!" Sam said as he took the paper from his pocket and slammed in on the bar, the loud noise made everyone look at the trio, and Steve had to sigh and throw Loki an apologetic look which made the Alpha roll his eyes and mutter something under his breath.
"This is our cue!" Tony grinned, picking up the bouquet of flowers that Serpentine arranged for him; to say that they were flowers made for a wedding would be laughable, it was more suited for a funeral in a horror movie that than; the flowers were just stalks full of thorns with a few black roses here and there with one single rose in the middle, wrapped by spider webs to keep them together.
"Do you really think I am an idiot enough to actually work with you? Willingly? You get to be joking with me! I have met many stupid villains but you Sir are taking the cake." Tony snorted after he regained his breath, the humor still painting his face when Zemo's face turned dark at those words.
" The woman growled, and Peter screamed and cries softly, making Steve screams and screams inside his mind. "
That made Steve pause a little, and when it clicks Steve gave a small chuckle at that and gaze at the computer in wonder. "J.A.R.V.I.S." Steve hummed and cracks a smile at the questioning marks he read in the text. "He named you JARVIS." Steve said making the AI pause, if Steve really can say that, before answering with another text.
"It is OK, mother, I am here, do not cry please." Thor whispered pulling away from his mother and wiping her tears away, it hurt his heart to see his mother so pained and heartbroken because of him. His mother seemed to regain herself at his words, smiling gently as she leaned up to kiss his cheek, making warmth surround Thor's heart.
Even though Tony knows not to get closer to the man (Courtesy of the villains who liked to make cheap shots) Tony still did, he walked closer to take the man in, whistling when he saw his face more clearly, and tilting his head at the glowing necklace with the bluestone… it was familiar in some way…
"My name is Peter Rogers Ma'am, and I know you, you are Maria Stark, I saw you in Maria Stark's fundraising for leukemia patients." The pup piped out which made the smile on Maria's face to slip for a second as her eyes widen at what the pup said, the small pup shouldn't have been there unless he was… unless he was… she looked toward Steve to see the sadness in the Omegas eyes which made her choke a little as she tried to take a breath, feeling like the room around her was spinning. "Do you know Italian, Ma'am?" The pup strange question made Maria look at him as she swallowed a little at that, trying to regain her balance a little.
God, I'm beating! I will try to update the next chapter sooner next time, I promise!
Imagine Tony's surprise (not really) when he heard an ear-piercing scream coming from the kitchen. Natasha's, if Jarvis was right (which his AI was always right) and Tony should have known that the criminal was no one other than Rogers.
"He was hated for that, being called insane, made fun of, and abandoned, the only one who stood beside him was his caretaker… as you see, he was not popular… I guess him acting like this was a defense mechanism… as other stars used to do a lot of unpleasant things when they see him…" Thor shifted in his place, as he looked down, feeling shame creeping on him making it hard to breathe.
That's why Steve was agitated since he woke up from a coma, he can't tell the difference between the life he dreamed, and the one he really lived, in this state, everyone is considered his enemy.
screaming and snarling dominated the room, words being spoken but they were not one that Steve could focus on, he was on the floor holding his legs as he rocked back and forth trying to stop the freezing panic that made his blood run cold when he heard it, Steve felt like the whole universe stopped and all of his breath was stolen from him, he didn't even pay any attention to the men who were rolling on the ground and exchanging blows… his attention was attracted by a sound that was familiar in a way, it was so familiar it sounded like… sounded like…
"But we are fated, mates… that means the two of us going to mate in the end." Tony said, a little self-conscious when he saw Dr. Ross frown at his words, she put her notebook and pen down looking at Tony in the eyes.
This story just wouldn't leave my mind until I write it, but I think it went pretty good.
Not as much creepiness in this chapter, but the next one is!
It made Tony a little unbalanced to be honest, how Peter attached himself to Harley like this in such a short time, it made him want to do research, on this Harley guy who seemed to gain Peter's trust. "Hey, Betty, can you tell me about Harley?" Tony asked the Beta sitting near him getting a confused noise from her. "Peter's friend, who he always goes on and on about; like the two of them are a married couple." Tony stated, getting a snort and a laugh from Betty who nodded her head.
"I do not see why this would have stopped you, having a son is the same as not having one in every other person's eyes; it is a kill or be killed world, only the strongest can survive for a few more days before someone stronger than them show up, so why?" The king asked, and Steven smiled to himself, eyes going distant, his action caused the king to close his mouth, waiting for the answer he knows will come if he waited.
"Who?" Steve asked part of him intrigued by the person who came to see him, managing to go through Natasha and gaining her permission in the end; that's something rarely happens, especially when Natasha and Sam were in an overprotective mood ever since that night two weeks ago. Natasha only tilted her head to the side, pointing at the door, causing Steve's eyes to widen when he saw Bucky standing near the door, nervously playing with his hands as he tried to look as calm as he can; what made Steve's jaw drop a little was the black eye dominating Bucky's left side, leaving him looking like he gets the left side of his face painted. "Bucky?" Steve asked in shock, wondering if he finally lost it and started seeing things.
Steve though, could only shake Peter Quill's hand away when the man tried to drag him away from the communal floor that turned into a battleground; Steve doesn't want to leave, he doesn't want to leave Tony who seemed to be the Witch's only target, the witch who attacked to kill and torture, the witch who cussed and hissed and throw her magic left and right… her tainted magic that tried to latch into every being and break their minds with her torturous spells.
"God, don't scare me like this again! I was ready to go and fight them both; Good Lord!" Tony grunt, huffing when Steve pulled him to his chest and start kissing him slowly, starting from his neck, to his cheeks, and ending his destination by taking Tony's lips; all the while Tony's toes curled as he tried to keep his moan as his husband's beard tickled him and scratched him in the most pleasant way… in the past month you can say that Tony started having a beard kink because of his husband… bad, bad Steve.
"Help… me…" The pained moan coming from every direction of the gym made Thor tense as he turned around to see who dared to call him. "H-help me!" This time the caller was that of a woman, and strangely it was the sound of his mother which caused Thor to tense like a bow ready to shoot as he turned around the place hoping to see who dared to hurt his family. "Please, help us!" This time it was Loki's voice, which made Thor shake in his place as he tried to find where his family was so that he would save them, but no matter where he looked he didn't find any trace of them anywhere.
Reaching the Stark mansion was a disaster because, for one thing, Tony was there, holding himself in the basement with his AC/DC music on loud, nearly deafening everyone with it, and to top it all J.A.R.V.I.S. refused them entry which made all of the Avengers sit outside of the basement door waiting for the Alpha to get out, Peggy was with Maria pounding on the door hoping that Tony will hear them and open the door to one of them… so far no luck.
"I don't know, we just click I guess? He was the same as Peter, probably why I feel more related and protective of him." Steve explained to the best of his ability, though Tony feel like Steve can't really put his feelings and thoughts into words, which made the Omega hum and snuggle into his embrace.
“What the hell Tony! How did Rogers propose and only now we knew about it, that’s an outrage!” Rhodey complained, but looking closely, Tony noticed the tears in his best friend's eyes, making him chuckle and let go of Pepper, only to go to Rhodey and pull him in a tight hug.
"Wow, this is the first time I see you awake before the sunset, old man, what's the occasion?" Bucky's grin nonchallenged, trying to act like everything is normal and that nothing happened; a fate that Bucky played so well, especially with the charming smile he was sending Steve's way.
"I found them, Sir; they are living in the Portofino, under the Carbonell name."
Edith's sarcastic tone made Tony wince… Yup, too much like his mother for his liking, the AI even had his mother's 'I'm So Disappointed in you' voice; it made him uncomfortable as much as horrified about this Steve having an AI with his mother's voice in it.
Steven had to smile when Tony's rush to take one of the books with a huge grin on his face a manic glee shining in his eyes at the thought of gaining knowledge of something new. Though that smile fell as soon as he opened the book and start looking through it, furrowing his brows as he flipped the book a few times, causing nothing to change, which made the man look at Thor with a frown? "What language is this? It's not even old runes alphabet language!" Tony whines as he turns the book to Thor, showing strange runes to everyone.
"Tony!" Peter's squeals as he ran toward him, which made Tony give a happy chuckle and kneel on the ground, pulling Peter in his embrace when Peter finally reached him, getting a giggle from the little boy as he cuddled him in his embrace giving him kisses all over his face, which caused Peter to let out happy noises, to inform Tony that he was happy, which made Tony's heart warm up and flutter in his chest.
"Oh well, I tried." Steve said in mock disappointment, but the smile on his face told how happy he was, as he starts unwrapping the bandages from his hands, taking the water bottles from Peggy with a smile, and giving one of them to Tony who was smiling and nodding as his son chattered his ear happily.
"But it was boring! All those people ever talk about was money, money, and how much pity they felt for the kids!" The pup whine which made Tony hide his laughter, the kid had nailed it, at such a young age and he realized what a lousy people those who came here were, excluded few who really cared about the children and not showing how much they donated for this case.
Poor baby! What's going to happen next!
“H-he is sleeping, May’s house, he’s been through enough.” Steve swallowed when Tony let out a low hiss, his eyes turning to May’s house before settling on Steve, and the Omega hoped that his mate will calm down enough, that his inner Alpha will see that everything is alright and retreat in the back of his lover’s mind, bringing him his Tony back.
Tears started trickling down Steve's face as he hides his face in his knees hugging himself tightly, his heart, it felt like someone was squeezing it, he felt like the burden of the world was left on his shoulders, and Steve had been struggling to carry, ever since he discovered that he was pregnant… no before that, when he met Anthony for the first time, Steve should have known that he will end up here, crying his heart and wishing death because he couldn't do this anymore… he couldn't see his baby suffering anymore, he couldn't work, work, and work for hours, before his son woke up to him coming home hours after his baby fell asleep, only seeing his child one day in the week, he was tired of pinning after an Alpha that broke his heart over and over again, killing his best friend and brother, and breaking his child's fragile heart, he was tired of seeing May and Ben forcing themselves to help them when the two of them deserve to live their own lives without a needy Omega forcing their hands to take care of his child… he was so tired…
Steve and Serpentine gazed at each other's eyes before giving a nod, a shiver ran down Tony's spine at the dark look both of them had in place, a look that informed Tony that what's going to happen next will be much worse than aliens in New York…
"Maybe… she became a little stern considering that the adoption process is coming to an end?" Steve stated softly holding Tony to his chest tightly; scent-marking his husband while releasing a calming scent hoping that Tony wouldn't get stress at the reminder.
"I know…" Tony's voice cracked as he said that looking at the roses in his hands, nearly squeezing the roses tightly in his hands from how nervous he was, but he was able to calm himself a little in the last minute fearing that any wrong move will push Steve farther away from him. "But I… I…" Tony's voice got stuck in his throat, and Tony nearly start sobbing hysterically at that, finally, after having Steve listen to him without screaming his head off, after getting a chance he knows that he will never get another one no matter how much he will try, finally after all that time… and Tony's voice decided to vanish now of all times?
"Ancient One, Brother Stark was telling us about how you informed him that he is a reincarnation of someone named Anton, is that true?" Thor asked amazement and awe shining in his eyes, which caused Steven to blink his eyes and turn to Tony who was looking at him with wide innocent eyes, wondering if Steven will lie and say no or if he will say the truth.
It had been a week since Tony's talk with Fury, a week since Tony learned to read between the lines and discover what the creature in the lake wanted; a week with Tony packing his bag and contemplating leaving this town for once and for all… a week. And Tony still didn't know if he wanted to leave or not.
And yes, I took liberty as the author to rewrite the MCU world as I see fit.
"Because this is the only way for you to redeem yourself, right what wrong you did, I know you are a better person and maybe it is time for you to act like it. Besides, Thanos would have got his hands on you if I did not." Steven said as he looked at his elegant clothes and robes that were in red, white, and blue colors, he looked at Loki after that to see the God looking at him with a shock and disbelieve.
Four months passed and Steve did end up getting better, he put a little weight until he was finally what considered a healthy pregnant Omega, Steve made sure to take care of himself after his visit to the hospital, he was still struggling financially but his work at the book store and the college saving helped with the rent and the necessity he needed or wanted, using from his college's saving meant that Steve ends up dropping from college, it was hard being an Omega in college as people still weren't that open-minded yet, but a pregnant one? It was going to be a nightmare. Steve had the choice between, struggling after the baby was born if he continued going to college, or having a few dollars that will help him after the baby was born… it was obvious what choice has won.
"Of course, I love you three thousand remember?" Steve said making Tony hum at that. "I love you more than the suns, and stars, and moons, and every day I fell more in love with you than yesterday, I will love you for the rest of my life if you let me…" Steve said making Tony pause at that and chuckle while shaking his head at Steve.
Tony snarled as he tried to push through the electric bearer that was their prison cage that was put in the middle of the room, hissing when the bearer melted the outside layer of his suit, everything was fine, more than fine even! They were able to save the hostages that Hydra took and threatened to kill… only for those hostages to turn out to be Hydra's agents, Tony didn't know how Hydra was even able to win and capture them, throwing them into these cells, but the Alpha was going to grumble and say it was because Bruce wasn't with them on this mission so they couldn't use the Hulk to get them out, so that meant it was up to Tony to find a way to save his teammates and himself… just when he finally was able to have the talk he desperately wanted with his Omega.
"Why are you here Tony?" Steve said which made the Omega fumble out an answer that made the Alpha narrow his eyes and lean closer toward the Omega, mainly to make him uncomfortable so that he will excuse himself and leave Steve, but the Omega only blushes at the closeness between the two of them. "Just leave Tony…" Steve said which made the Omega frown at that, and huffed while shaking his head.
"Wait! So you are telling me that people bullied him because he was modest and refused to watch a woman birth her baby? Are you for real?" Tony raised his eyebrow at what he heard, not believing that a person can be bullied because he wasn't into seeing a bloody mess and squirming babies. "When I had Peter I kept screaming at the people to get their eyes off me, and he is being called crazy for not looking at woman's vagina? I now regret calling him crazy…" Tony rolled his eyes and cross his arms, turning his gaze to the blond who was on the sofa. "So tell me what changed that he suddenly became popular and wanted?" Tony questioned, curiously getting the better of him.
Steve was still groggy from sleep so it took him a few seconds to response, it was mainly because he turns to the side and smile a little as he saw Edith on his bedside table with a glass of water, after taking the glass and sipping a little cold water he turns to Bruce who was looking at Steve. "Oh, you know, same old, insane villains decided they wanted to rule the world, stole some files from Shield and decided to build a time machine, the usual," Steve said as he drank his glass of water.
The Iron King eventually scoffed, shaking his head and stepping back. "Enough. I will hear no more excuses. I was expecting the least that was an apology for those whose lives were taken, but you are capable of not even that, Hydra King, so we are done here." He announced, turning around and walking back to his group.
"Don't worry, I will protect you don't worry…" Steve whispered looking around the closet. Seve then turned to the hidden door behind Tony and opened it slowly as to not make any sound, pointing to Tony to go through the door to the other side. "Get in, no one will notice the hidden door, I made sure of that when I build the room…" Steve whispered, causing Tony to nod shakily as he crawled toward the door knowing that if the door closed probably, no one will realize that there was something amiss if they didn't look closely, both Steve and Tony flinching at the crashing sound followed by laughter they heard coming from downstairs.
" The king hissed as he pulled Steven with him, and this time Steven rushed to follow him while pulling his son with him, not wanting him to hear what's going to take a place inside of the room.
"Finally! I am going to Asgard!" Steven turned around to see Tony in his suit pulling a… a portable lab with him? Only for Jarvis to call for Peggy's help in stopping the Omega. "But Aunt Peggy This is the opportunity of a lifetime! Thor say something!" Tony whines when Peggy pulled the Omega away from his gadgets which made Tony struggle to get back to it
It was calm; the coldness was seeping in every living thing that dared to wake in the night. The eternal night with the dark sky that was doted by stars; stars in different sizes and shapes, giving the land below the light it needs, not to flourish, no, but enough that whoever walks on its land will see where their steps were taking them. Rocks float around the place, no gravity to hold them down; footsteps echoed loudly in the place, promising many things and nothing at the same time. The stars' light seemed to waver as if they flinched away from the dark and cursed place. Something was approaching, something dark… something that promised only death and pain and despair.
The two of them watched Peter for a little while, Steve drinking his drink and watching the pups with a proud smile on his face, while Tony could only watch how happy Peter was, not even flinching or screaming when one of the volunteers came to give him a box of apple juice and cake. It made Tony's heart flutter in happiness to see his pup nodding his head to the older boy who couldn't be older than sixteen, and he even thanked him. Tony looked at his hands while running his tongue over his lips trying to wet the. "Thank you, I am going back if you don't mind." Tony asked which made Steve smile at him and nod his head, watching Tony as he march toward the therapist room with a determined look in his eyes…
Harley may not be smart-smart as Peter, but he was people smart, he knows what change people, he knows what to do to appear unthreatened, he knows what to do to make them happy and how to force himself to smile and give them what they want so they would leave him alone. Peter may think that Mr. Tony was special and amazing, and maybe he was, but Mr. Tony, Mr. Steve, and even Peter would change once they have another baby coming into the house.
"Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, I will be honored!" Pepper said making Tony laughed at that happily. "What are you doing Tony? We should go and celebrate! Come one, I know the best place that sale ice-cream in New York, come one!" Pepper babbled happily getting up and nearly tripping making Tony laugh at that and help her standing up, the two of them went to buy ice-cream and talk about when the baby was going to arrive, and how far Tony was, and how Pepper was going to host the most epic baby shower there is, and… they talked about a lot of things…
It was Tony, it was his beautiful Tony, as young and beautiful as the day he first saw him when Shield asked him to fight Loki. A smile took over his face and he closed his eyes, feeling so happy that he was finally able to see Tony for one last time, he felt happy, and for the first time in a very long time he felt…
Tony knows that if he spoke to his Mom and Dad about the heat, they will do anything to insure his health and happiness, and that thought caused warmth inside Tony; what he was truly worried about was Steve's reaction to the announcement. What if he chooses to spend Tony's heat with him? What
Maybe it was a trick of the light, maybe he was sleep-deprived, maybe he was going crazy. No, Tony was sure after counting and recounting them; Natasha has eight eyes. Tony could only tilt his head and let out a stupid 'Huh' already knowing that Steve has reached Natasha a long time ago, because if he didn't, Tony wouldn't have been looking at a spider-Natasha glaring at him; in the back of Tony's mind, the genius couldn't help but think that it was fitting.
It took a long time before everything turned out to be alright in the end; a lot of ups and downs before everything settle down, lots of tears and crying, and many happy moments that made them hope and wish for a better future. It was getting better, things are looking up, and bridges that were burned a long time ago were being mended.
"Aunt May…" The pup laughed nervously as he backed away from Tony, which made Tony stand up and look behind him at the scowling Beta who was glaring at the pup who was trying to look away from the woman.
"How do you do it?" Tony asked that night as he looked at his room's ceiling, his baby was snuggling in his arms snorting contently as he suckled on his thumb, Tony didn't really know if the Alpha was asleep, but he really did want the Alpha to tell him what to do, how he could do it? Talk with his therapist, and then ignoring how it felt draining after he returns home, how can he just… not care about it?
Even if his heat took him by surprise and the only thing he could remember was taunts and pain, even if Stane smirked at him when his heat ended and laughed at him. Tony just gritted his teeth at that, if he didn't remember than it didn't happen, and that was it. Sex was sex and people do it all the time for different reasons and forgets about it, he will forget about it as sex was unimportant, virginity was overrated. He took sick pleasure at the shock and disgust that paint Stane's face when he spits on him, he endured the beating he got after as it was the norm. The only thing he was grateful for is that a mating mark won't take without the Omega consent, if Stan thought losing his virginity would humiliate him, will he should think again…
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, a little bit of sadness, creepiness, smut, and poor Stevie! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"She… she looks like you…" Howard mumbled as he stood beside Harley, gazing at the baby with lost eyes like he doesn't know what do to; a soft smile took over Tony's face and he had to let out a laugh, the sight his father was making was as beautiful as heartbreaking as it was.
"He is dead Tony." Said Howard with a scowl making Tony look at him with an innocent look… far from it actually, he can hear Aunt Peggy sigh at that and shake her head, Angie was doing her best not to laugh.
Steve sighed tiredly as he finally shuffled to the kitchen, going to the kettle and heating some water, hoping that a cup of herbal tea would calm him down from the dark path he was heading to. Looking at the clock, Steve blinked his eyes when he saw that it was already seven PM and he wondered when Bucky would arrive so the two of them were going to talk about the pain in the ass that was Howard.
Personally, Nebula would have preferred to be away from all of this madness, away from Thanos, away from the war, and away from the Ancient One, that Nebula couldn't help but petty for the dark fate waiting for him in Thanos' delusional grip. Not for the first time, a spark of envy light inside Nebula as she remembered her sister Gamora and how she managed to escape Thanos' clutch while Nebula was still slaving away like a dog, trying to save herself every second. Another part, a small part inside Nebula's heart couldn't help but feel a little betrayed, betrayed with how her sister escaped and left her to rot away beside Thanos without even helping her or reaching out to her.
"Fine! Do as you want, but know this Tony if something happens to the kid it will be on you." Betty snarled, sending a harsh and disapproving look to Tony, hoping that he will back down, only to growl harshly when Tony just stood straight and met Betty's stare head-on…
Pepper… well, Pepper had wanted to stay with him, fearing that he will relapse somehow, but Tony knew that he couldn't be in anyone's presence right now, he even begged the woman to just leave him alone for a precious few days, he just wanted a few days for himself, and he promised himself that when the time was over, he will leave his house and smile and try to pretend that nothing happened that everything was OK, but he just needed few days to do that…. Thankfully the Beta gave him his few days, which turned into weeks, which turned into a whole month of Tony doing nothing but staying in his lab working, sometimes sleeping if exhaustion took over his body, and he was forced to eat by Pepper who always come to check on him.
Steve returned early today, planning on cheering Tony a little, he knows that the Omega wasn't doing well, not since last night, not since he saw the comics, the comics that the Alpha tried so hard to keep out of the Omega's way, comics that he always told his son to put in his room, but as it seems, his son didn't always listen, it wasn't that Steve didn't want the Omega to see his work, he knows that the names he used for his comic will make the Omega go crazy, probably do something rush too, that may as well have been part of the reason why he decided to return home earlier today, with a heavy heart, his mind was running around in circles, wondering what the Omega will do, wondering if he would…
She was tired, she was so tired of trying to fix Howard's mistakes, tired of telling her bambino that no, Howard didn't hate him it wasn't the reason that he didn't come to his birthday, that she was sorry but his father was so busy with work that he couldn't attend his graduation from college, that she was sure that Howard didn't mean it when he paid Sunset because she was sure something was not right. She was tired of trying to come up with excuses to Howard's shitty ways of dealing with his family and friends, she was just so tired…

You will think that after Steve gained the date he has been after for months it will mean he will calm down a little. Tony thought that he will, so Tony prepared for a few days of relaxation before he has to face the horror that was their first and last date. As soon as Tony got over the terror that Steve's room is somehow connected to his workshop and that all this time Steve could have entered his sanctuary but didn't because he respected Tony's privacy and loves him too much to do something as entering his safe haven (Which was kind of sweet, no one has ever done something like that to him; not that Tony will tell anyone that) Tony went to his comfy couch in the corner of his workshop, planning on taking a nap, or doing some light reading or maybe do some projects that don't need him to move his ass from the couch for the next few days if that was possible.
So finally after going back and forth with himself and J.A.R.V.I.S. Tony accepted marrying Steve; mainly because that meant Tony won't die alone or get killed by anyone without Steve avenging him, another was because he really started to like Steve. Believe it or not, the man wasn't that bad when you get to know him; especially the protective side of him.
' and that it was his fault, causing Tony's heart to break and curse whoever caused Harley to turn out like this, feeling scared at the notion of a broken glass that Tony can buy a million of easily.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, heartbreak, a lot of plot twists (?), and we got to meet a lot of different characters! Also, Steve is an asshole! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Yup, Tony is a little shit in this one :)
"How are you, Steve? I know this must be a lot for you, not only did you meet the person who the fate chose as the one, but now you are to take care of a child that not only is not yours, but he thinks that you are his father… what's your Alpha's reaction to all of this?" Jarvis said calmly looking at the tired Alpha that leans on the wall behind him to think.
In the end, Tony was left with too many loose ends and too many 'What ifs'; he was left with too many questions and not enough answers to them. With that, Tony finally decided enough was enough and he left the house, planning on interrogating and threatening people until he finally got the answers he wanted and needed; answers that would decide what Tony's next step would be.
Why is Howard here?
"I've seen colder," Tony said, trying not to break as he remembered the dream/vision he saw, how Steve's bone broke one after another with every refusal he gave to Thanos until his death, how Tony stood helplessly staring as his family was killed and his home was destroyed and his baby was taken from him; Tony won't let that vision come true, he won't even if everyone turned against him on this. "This one, this very vulnerable blue one?" Tony started pointing down to the ground, his home, causing Steve to press his lips tightly. "It needs Ultron. Can't you imagine that? Peace; finally we will have peace, why can't you see that, Steve?" Tony took a step toward Steve hoping the star will understand why wouldn't he? Steve stated it himself, the only thing that stopped other worlds from invading Earth was because it was too weak, too underdeveloped, but now, Thanos' eyes sit on Earth, his eyes sit on Steve.
It doesn't matter that much anymore really, because it seems that Tony got used to living with an Addams; crazy one at that, but still an Addams. Unfortunately, no one decided to tell his teammates about his heroic deed, he was sure that if someone did, his team wouldn't plan on killing him on the spot every time their eyes fell on him. All in all, Tony's life sucks, and he hates that he was prey for a crazy Addams, who somehow start warming his creepy self in Tony's terrified heart; something that he will pay his therapist double so that she will find him the cure, because hell no!
Steve's words made Tony pout a little, and then he starts biting his lower lip as he starts thinking of ways to right what happened a few hours ago. "But Steve! This is not a math problem I can solve in a few seconds and be done with; this is Harley we are talking about…" Whatever complaint Tony wanted to say was cut by the door of his room being knocked on, making Tony sigh as he stood up from his bed. "I got to go, the kids came knocking, probably Peter, do you want to say goodnight?" Tony asked, shaking his head with a smile when he heard Fury's voice yelling in the background, probably slaving Steve and dragging him around.
Steven gazed at the medicine, that seemed to be a herbal drink, after giving it a sniff, he scrunches his nose at the sharp smell, taking a sip from the drink; after confirming that he knew the ingredient of the drink and that there wasn't any poison, Steven held his breath and drank all of the medicine in one go, ignoring how he start feeling nauseous for taking the drink on an empty stomach. "What happened to Petrus?" Steven asked, his mind wandering to the small pup that endangered himself to try and help Steven, from the corner of his eyes, Steven noticed the surprise on Braes' face, probably wondering why the queen will ask about the king's pup.
As much as Steven hated following that arrogant Alpha, a deal is a deal and he must honor it, so Steven followed that Alpha, while glaring at the back of his head hoping that he will burn to the ground and end Steven's suffering, but as always life wasn't fair, and Steven was forced to follow the arrogant and useless Alpha, but the Omega tried to not glare at the Alpha with such an obvious way, not because he was afraid of the Alpha's people after all the Omega made sure to insult Johann in front of his subjects, but the Omega toned down his frightful glare because the king's pup was looking at him and James with wondering wide blue eyes, blue like his babe, hiding in his father's neck every time Steven's eyes caught his, but James took it as a fun way to pass the time, waving to the king's pup when he raised his head to look at them, making the small pup pause a little before waving back to James.
"Can I help you, sir?" A voice asked making Tony blink his eyes, he turns toward the person who spoke only to see an African-American male, from his scent he was a Beta and a concern one at that as he looked at Tony who was spacing with worry and a little bit of suspicion.
So many possibilities and so much time in his hands that he was finally free! Something moves through the trees, which made the brunette look up as the car moved; the branches were shaking, spilling yellowing leaves which made Tony smile, thinking that it was nothing but a squirrel…
A shine caught the Alpha's attention and his hand followed the path to it, his right hand touched a silver chain which made the Alpha hum at that wondering how he didn't notice the Omega wearing something as fancy as that, just as the Alpha was about to pull the Omega's chain so that he will be able to see the shape of the necklace a hand took hold of his and squeezed harshly making the Alpha look at the Omega's tired eye, watching as the Omega's blue eyes widen when they fell on him and the queen pushed his hand away. "What did you do?" The Omega snapped at the Alpha making the Alpha frown at him.
Tony doesn't know how long it took him to hail a taxi and drive toward the building that Sam Wilson was in, his heart was pounding so loudly in his chest that Tony feared it will rip out of his chest any minute now when Tony reached the building and paid the driver fee while tipping him for driving him here in record time.
A nasty spoiler T-T
"Am… fine… just nightmares…" Steve murmured in a muffled voice, trying to calm himself as his lover's hand ran through his hair, calming a part of Steve that he didn't know needed this. Slowly, it took only a few more minutes before Steve finally calmed down, the vision of the dark future going to the back of his mind as he focused his sense on his lover…
All in all, everything was good, everything was perfect, better, much safer than it was a few days ago… or at least that's what Tony liked to convince himself. Tony doesn't know if Rhodey and Pepper knew or suspected that something was amiss in the house or in the town; Tony knew that the past few days were hard and strained on everyone's nerves even when everyone was trying to hide the truth.
"Because she died at birth." These five words caused Tony's heart to still in his chest, his breath left him in a rush as he gazed at Fury with disbelieving eyes, his lips trembling at the dark image of his words being true. "She died; everyone knew that, especially when the bullet wound was clear for everyone to see…" Fury trailed off when he saw how pale Tony was becoming; it took a few minutes before Tony finally managed to calm down, holding tightly to Morgan as he tried to reign himself. "We didn't know what to say or do. It was then that Rogers did something; no one knows how, or what he did, but he managed to bring back your baby… no one saw Rogers after that day, even when Barnes and Carter went to talk to him, it was like he… disappeared." Tony took a shuddered breath as he tried to wrap his mind around what Fury told him, knowing deep down where Rogers went to and what he did since he disappeared.
So what do you think?
Harley remembered that saying in one of the neglected foster homes he was forced into; he still remembered how his foster sister laughed in his face as she said these words, snickering as she gave her back to Harley. Harley didn't want to believe in such words, after all, he was not a dog, nor was a baby going to change someone's life so dramatically, that such nasty actions would take place… Harley always believed that, until he was thrown back into the orphanage the second day after Mrs. Joe told her husband she was pregnant.
Steve though, put the last dish on the dining table, going to his son and picking him up, giving Tony a wink before taking Peter with him outside of the house, which gained him a blink from the Omega followed by a knowing look, which informed Steve that Tony caught on the private conversation Steve plan to have with his boy, Steve knows that it is better if the news came out of his mouth before anyone even Tony.

"I know, Jamti, I already know all of that!" Hissed Anton, his words causing Jamti to huff and for his lips to curl down in disapproval, which did nothing but cause Anton to grit his teeth and look forward. "Even if I was interested in the queen like that, I would not have perused a relationship with him," Anton stated, his words did nothing but make Jamti roll his eyes and grumble something under his breath.
Oh God, why? Why does the universe hate him? Why does the world hate him? Why does his company hate him? What did he ever do? Other than continuing his family legacy, Tony knew he fucked up by continuing to make weapons (But that was mostly Stane's manipulation and him trying to make his dead/zombie parents proud) but Tony regret it and was trying to repent for years now; so, why? Oh merciful Lord, why was he getting punished with an Addams of all the cruel things in the world?
"I'm sorry, I promise I will do better, please Steve, don't leave me…" Tony plea as he took a step toward Steve trying to pull him in his arms; Steve doesn't know if he should push Tony away and march back toward Bucky, leaving his husband alone just as his husband left him for the past few months, a part of Steve still hasn't forgiven the Alpha yet, not after what he had done.
"That what the fuck did you give him?" Jarvis snapped, finally getting feed up with the way Howard was acting; uncaring and cold, nearly causing Jarvis to attack his once friend, it makes him wonder if the old Howard was there somewhere inside the cold empty shell in front of him…
Tony let out a breath and looks at the door, then at the phone taking in the shape 'Nokia' was writing in white letters above the screen. Tony took a breath and tried to open the phone, after a few tries he was able to, Tony bit his lips in concentration, for God's sake! He was an engineering student! He graduate from MIT when he was fifteen and a half, a stupid phone was not going to stop him from saving his son! Tony then tried to go to the phone database and sighs in happiness as he accesses the base… he was fascinated by the phone capability, and he nearly sobs as he saw that the phone can send SMS messages! He doesn't have to be afraid of someone calling this number again if they didn't answer Tony the first time, he can delete the message after sending it!
In the final scene, Tony, Steven, and their children would have moved into the lake house that Steven told Tony about, the five of them living there happily.
"Oh, God, I'm so proud of you," Pepper said holding Tony tightly, making the Omega let out a wet laugh, and hide his face in her neck.
"Look around you, it's night, stars don't sleep at night." Steven hissed as his eyes returned to glare at the cuffs. Well, that was better wording to that piece of accessory, but then again, Steven got a blue stone necklace that doesn't want to detach itself off him, that Steven wanted it to stay away from him after knowing what it was, so Steven may not be the best person to decide on what was fashionable to attach to his body without consent and what was not in this wasteland.
And Tony… Tony was frozen in his place, he was shaking uncontrollably at what he saw and heard, a part of him was telling him that this was a play from the man in front of him, that his mate was home with their baby and that this was nothing but a play with his mate's look-alike, but another part told him that this man just took his mate and child away from him… he took his mate and child away from him! Tony let out a roar at that as he slammed himself at the bearer, over and over again as he let out a roar after roar, and when Peggy tried to stop him before he hurt himself, he pushed her away as he hissed at her, making the Avengers freeze in their place when they saw that Tony's eyes were golden… this was not Tony anymore… this was
"So what's her name?" Pepper finally asked after stopping her cooing to the baby, nearly squealed when the baby, yawn cutely and curling up into Tony, Steve and Tony glanced at each other before Tony gives a devilish grin, Steve though only nodding the smile panting his face.

It was a few weeks since Doom, and the world know that there was two Captain America walking on earth now, and Steven had to say that he was nearly about to rip his hair off, not only he was becoming a dancing monkey again because everyone wanted to meet the new Captain or a Commander Rogers as they start calling him that they knew about Shield, but people always made passes at him, especially when he wears his glass and slick his hair back like he always does… Clint joke that it was all in the beard, which usually made Steven roll his eyes at the Omega but smiled at his words as he remembered that the Clint from his universe would have said the same.
It was a month later that Tony finally dared to leave his house, in that month, he spent every waking moment he had closing himself in his lab ignoring people left and right, his friends come a week later after Pepper told them about the news, every one of them looking at him with sadness and understanding looks, but Tony didn't have it in him to smile or even cry, he was just so tired, he took a month-long vacation, and fuck everyone in SI who would talk about him doing what he wanted because he was Howard Stark's son, he just wanted to be alone and have the chance to mourn his lost son in peace.
I'm sure that you know the reference to Peter's name right? Gave you a spoiler for the chapters that will come of that story ;)
“Why are you here?” Steve finally dared to ask, he had been watching Howard for a long time now, and he knew that the man was on his last nerves and wanted to say something to Steve, probably to threaten him again or offer him money, you never know with Howard. When the man starts walking in his direction Steve took it as his chance to ask what the hell did the Alpha want, why was he here, and probably scream at him some more, but Steve was too tired that he simply said those words without any bit to them.
Steve looked at Tony's face and he pursed his lips, looking at the Alpha's begging face, he let out a sigh and turns his gaze to his cup before finally coming to a decision and looking at Tony with a hard look. "One chance Stark, you only got one chance to make everything right, you messing that up, and you are out, out of my life, and most importantly out of Peter's life, and you better make sure to tell your father to not stick his nose in our lives this time, or else…" Steve threats which made Tony nod his head so fast the Omega wondered how it didn't fly off, he ignored the warmth he felt at the happiness he saw in the Alpha's eyes. "Tomorrow is Peter's appointment with the hospital, 9 AM sharp, try to not be late." Steve ended up saying as he took his cup and went to wash it in the sink, ignoring the happiness that took over Tony's face…
"Mama…" James murmured as he woke up, gazing at Steven who turned his face toward his babe and gave him a small tired smile, seeing Steven awake, James gasped and his eyes start clouding with tears, as he all but throw himself in Steven's embrace when the Omega opened his arms. "I was so worried, you did not wake up for seven days, they said…. They said that you may not wake up, they said…" James let out a sob, which caused Steven to coo, he winced as he tried to sit down, the pain in his abdomen was sharp but he paid the pain no attention as he held his babe tightly in his arms.
