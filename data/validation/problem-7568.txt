“That was not awkward at all,” Wanda remarked. Bucky was chuckling to himself.
“Hey Jane, what happened?” Tony asked softly.
Wow, only Tony Stark had the ability to find himself in a mess like this.
Hey everyone, how's your day?
“Watch it!” she snapped. But she cheered up once she realized it was Tony. “Oh hey Tony. Are you late?”
“But the Tower is huge!” Tony pointed out.
“Yeah free entertainment I know, I know,” Tony scoffed.
Tony winked at the receptionist as he walked out of the building. He sat in his convertible and drove back home, taking occasional sips from his milkshake.
Once they felt satisfied, they both withdrew.
“Doctor Strange?” Steve said. But before he could say another word, the Frost Giant had grabbed him by his neck. He sneered before punching Steve on his stomach.
“You should get used to my attempts, I hope,” Steve looked at him, with hope blazing in his eyes. His cheeks were a little red.
“Yeah Sam. I haven’t told you. But one of them came looking for the stone. All of them were hostages. Doctor Strange came and locked him in another dimension and took the stone with him. And then thank God, you came. He also said Thor was coming in 2 days, which is tomorrow. I just feel, odd.” Steve confessed. He was giving his forehead a massage.
Howard didn’t bother to tone down his insults despite seeing the tears in Tony’s eyes. He gave his son one last glare before walking away.
“Not really,” Kayla said. “The cots are up for sale, the clothes and some of the toys are sold, and we managed to sell off all the baby foods.”
Tony let out a laugh at what Reed said.
“I demand an explanation!” Jarvis raised his voice.
“It kinda makes sense,” Doctor Strange spoke up. “Thor, get the soft one here. And bring our two boys back please.”
“You didn’t tell me what Clint was going through…” Bucky shrugged. He held Jan to stop her from losing balance.
“Oh God,” she whispered.
Bruce stopped and raised his eyebrows. “Then where do you think Wanda will sleep?”
“Uh… yeah,” Clint replied.
Tony’s eyes were red. He nodded his head. He knew that if he were to say even one word, his voice would break and waterworks would emerge. “Tony, the people coming are your friends. Friends fight. But they also know how to get back together. Take your time. But don’t neglect them for too long. Alright?” Natasha patted his cheeks and got up.
“Is that a problem?” Howard frowned. “It’s something important and it’s not like you’re going to pick up your damn phone. So I figured direct contact would be good. Anyway, I wanted to tell you that you will be working closely with Obi. He’s a nice guy but… it’s not wise to trust him too much.”
“Trust us Thor,” Tony inhaled sharply. “We are about a 300% done too.”
“Sir, you should be resting. You are losing water and electrolytes the more you vomit.”
“I’d like to keep you in stealth mode. Stay invisible for the time being,” Tony mumbled to himself. He pressed another button and the jet became invisible.
“ETA, one minute, sir,” Jarvis informed him.
“It’s okay, Tony, I got you,” Thor said as he hurled Iron Man towards him. He held him by the waist and both of them flew off to the Tower, with the rest of the Avengers watching them fly by.
Tony stepped out of their walk-in closet and started to dance like an enthusiastic drunk in the club. He clapped his hands and wiggled his butt.
“You bring that everywhere you go?” Tony asked, bewildered.
The lot of them continued eating and were talking about how they were expecting the next semester to be.  Clint was sharing about how he knew his semester was going to be slightly relaxed, and that the new modules were actually his favorite. Natasha and Bruce remained neutral, and said that the Science school was full of surprises, so they didn’t want to jump into conclusions. Thor was more excited because he could focus on the technical aspect of theatre, while Steve was happy with his next semester modules, while Tony felt like his elective might kill them.
“No!” Clint scrambled towards Natasha.
Compulsory training exercise was the reason he gave as he placed a soft kiss on Tony’s cheek. Tony had mumbled some gibberish sentences, but woke up because sleep was just gone anyway. He took a quick shower, to wash away the grease and dried sweat that had accumulated on his skin.
“Both of you got de-aged during battle,” Steve carefully said.
“Where is Iron Man?” one of the reporters asked.
“Thanks Tony,” Bruce croaked.
“I shall, since I’m free!” Thor grinned. He took the pan and was already preparing the eggs.
But Tony couldn’t stop. In his mind, the only thing that was important was the safety of his adult self’s friends. So he kept Mjolnir targeted at the leader, almost beginning to fry him.
Kayla was staring at a muscular man who was dressed up like he was going for a Viking themed cosplay. She was still not fully awake from her sleep. She kept blinking at him.
“That’s right!” Sam winked at her. They exchanged handshakes. “Steve, where are the others? And wow, look at these babies!” Sam walked to where the babies were playing. Baby Clint willingly toddled into Sam’s open arms.
“My mushroom soup is one of the best!” Ana laughed while scooping out more soup for Steve’s bowl.
He entered the lab, where Bruce was. He was standing over his desk, reading some notes.
“What is the meal for today, Jarv?” Howard asked, without facing them.
Hi guys! How have you all been?
“Jarvis, scan the crowd for any desperate parents looking for their daughter.”
“Outside is getting clear,” Thor confirmed while hitting the cybernauts using Mjolnir, and sent them flying to the Hulk.
Tony began to moan uncontrollably, and he was writhing already. Steve chose this moment to place a finger into Tony, and straight away hit his sweet spot. Tony let out a little scream when he felt Steve’s finger hit right at home. Steve curled his finger in his boyfriend, and kept hitting his sweet spot.
Tony and company had reached the burger place in record time. The other three joined them 5 minutes later.
“At least she did some research,” Bruce said.
Hope you enjoyed this story!
“Hey Tony,” Reed grinned. For a mad scientist, he looked neat. “I’m glad you decided to return the call.”
Tony saw Steve’s little look of  jealousy wash over him. “I can cook too, you know.”
“So… why are we here?”
A little feeding session and Tony just, being Tony.
“Is Ana here?” Tony asked.
Iron Man was flying in with Bucky. He dropped Bucky on one of the buildings’ roofs and flew down to where Natasha was standing.
“Steve?” Tony called out. He ran to the passenger side and knelt down beside a now crying Steve.
He also saw how neat the room looked, compared to how it looked last night, with Steve’s and his professional clothes strewn all over the place.
Tony was looking at the clear skies. “You can, I am dropping Scott at the Tower. You can join him. But we may need you soon.”
“Yeah I do. I made a video compilation out of them and it’s in my phone. I was about to give it to you guys tomorrow morning,” Linda replied.
“Thank you, Bucky,” Thor smiled from below. He then proceeded to swing his hammer to fly around with Tony.
Bobbi narrowed her eyes at him, getting ready to whack him using her words.
They kept walking with arms swung around one another's shoulders for support. They looked like a big united but tired team. They kept walking forward, and the sun was slowly rising up behind them.
“He’s not gonna let that go!” Clint was laughing, along with many other heroes. “Such a fanboy! Hey how did that Frost Giant manage to get out?!”
“John… Johnny…” Tony croaked out. “Go behind the sh… shield.”
It was 6 in the evening. The babies, all currently two-year-olds, had just showered. They could walk and stand. Their speech was not that comprehensible, although they can form little sentences. They mostly enjoyed playing with the two girls. Steve liked to watch them, sometimes he would join the games. Now, he was giving baby Bruce a piggy back down the stairs. Bruce was giggling loudly at the way Steve bounced him on his back.
“I don’t,” Tony replied. “The arm can adjust itself to fit whatever measurements Bucky’s shoulder area is.”
“It’s the science calling. Some people get it strongly, especially smart men like Reed,” Tony explained. Both of them exited the elevator and Tony swung an arm around her. “I’ll talk to Reed after his little presentation, okay?”
“Oh Tony,” Steve raised his eyebrows. “But, he said he’d keep it in another dimension. So he bought us time. So Bruce, it’s not exactly in New York.”
“Boss,” the AI replied calmly. “He just might change his mind.”
“Not bad, sir,” Friday tried to make him feel better. “There have been worse tantrums thrown in the de-brief room.”
“That’s enough then.” Tony laughed.
requested him to follow her back to the Tower.
“Where am I?” a girl’s voice was heard in through the earpiece. “My parents and brother… There was an accident….”
“Get Captain America, my soldiers!” Strucker’s voice rang loudly.
“Um, hi,” Steve managed. “I was just… you know… checking Tony’s face. It’s alright… I guess.” He turned beet red when he heard Clint’s groan and Natasha’s laughter when they were walking to the door.
“How do we destroy both the stones?” Clint asked.
She too let out a small laugh. “I have faith. Especially in a team that is family to me.”
“This is getting harder,” Jessica panted. “Anyone know what the time is?”
It was another day and the Avengers had just fought another battle. This time, it was with a few scientists from the Advanced Idea Mechanics, or
“So which house is it?” Clint asked. “They all look the same to me you know.”
Tony pulled out the sick bag he had brought with him for emergencies, out of his suit pocket. He opened it, not caring about Steve being beside him.
“I loved it too,” Steve agreed. “It was something different to hear Thor scream like a girl. It was a change.”
Natasha didn’t say anything. She turned back to face the window. After a while, she spoke.
Tony stood up and pushed Howard to the ground. He was taken aback by his son’s sudden harsh movements. He kept giving his son a look that was a mixture of a glare and a look of surprise.
“Why did you leave it?” Scott asked. “I think you almost had it!”
It wasn’t long before only 1 crepe was left on one of the plates.
Steve didn’t move. He was looking at the floor, hands buried deep inside his pants pockets.
“This is beautiful,” Bruce said  to Natasha. “I only can wonder how the rooms are gonna look like.”
“Natasha told me,” Clint said, still thinking. “Okay, Karen helped us tick. There’s other members in the committee. And then…”
“Yeah they are,” he replied. "Just for tonight though. They have a friend's place to visit and stay at from tomorrow."
Mr. Rogers.”
The others knew about the situation. They kept very quiet. Clint, who was seated beside Tony, couldn't help but squeeze Tony's right hand. They were in opposite teams, yes, but they were still friends at the end of the day.
“Yes Tony honey boo!” Clint made fun of him from the pool.
Rhodey turned to look at the Captain. He was breathing heavily and he looked angry. He was looking at the blank screen with a steely gaze. Rhodey raised his eyebrows.
“Are you alright?” Steve asked in a quiet voice.
Natasha was definitely in denial. Steve let out a small laugh, but pretended to cough as he surely didn’t want to earn the Black Widow
Doctor Strange narrowed his eyes but had a little smile on his face. At the same time, his cloak rose up to where Tony was seated. He took it and gave it a few pats. The cloak gently caressed Tony's cheek, where the Frost Giant had slapped when he was de-aged. That was the final straw for Tony. His eyes watered, and he hugged the cloak, forgetting it was still connected to someone.
“But it was still food!” Tony shrugged.
The six of them took the wristbands and examined it. They knew they were going to have a very enjoyable time together at the theme park. Tony thanked Jarvis and told his friends to change up quickly. They were all sharing one car today, and were headed for the Santa Monica Pier.
“We have to do this as a team,” Steve spoke through gritted teeth.
“Hey big guy, the sun’s getting real low,” Natasha smiled. The Hulk turned to look at her, his stare softening.
Both of them tried it and gave it the green light.
“Yes,” Tony rolled his eyes. “Even though it’s cringe worthy. But… I don’t remember having a teddy bear… or maybe I did. Yeah yeah, I had a weird teddy bear when I was young. Jarvis didn’t know where it had come from, you know. He was freaking out!!”
“Clint!” Fisk angrily pushed Clint down, defending his close friend. “Keep your hands to yourself.”
Bruce leaned in closer to whisper to the girls. “I’m sure Tony is already planning on having you guys over.” The girls were grinning at that. Bruce nodded his head before jogging to the quinjet.
Then, the stairway door opened and the leader walked through. Tony’s defense mode kicked in. He called more lightning and casted it on the leader, letting out a shout.
Tony used the fingertip of the gauntlet to break open the pendant. The repulsor ray’s heat helped crack the strong glass. Thor then took the stone. They waited for three minutes for the puddle to show itself.
A rift enabled Tony and Steve to slide down and land right in front of Avengers Tower. Steve landed back-first, with a thud. Tony landed chest-first on Steve.
“Oh no you and that kook of your friend don’t just get to cut me off all the damn time!”
Steve lifted Tony up and made his way to the stairs. There were still debris littered around, with some AIM scientists on the ground. S.H.I.E.L.D personnel were carefully taking each man dressed in that obnoxious yellow suit into custody, while the people from Damage Control were waiting for them to finish up their work so that they could start theirs.
Both of them pulled away after a while.
“Come for me Tony,” Steve ordered.
“Yeah?” Steve managed to ask after about five seconds passed.
“So… what did I invent?” he asked.
“Uh… I don’t mind. But the movie..?”
Bruce nearly pressed the wrong readings. He adjusted his glasses and turned to face Tony, recalling a familiar conversation he had had with adult Tony. “You had asked me the same question; I mean, adult you. I want to ask you, what do you think, Tony?”
“Avengers, Defenders and the Fantastic Four,” Nick Fury’s voice came through their comms. “The medics are coming down pronto. There are some medical facilities here to treat the injured people too. Captain, can you tell me roughly how many people down there need the facilities?”
“Sir, we are going to land. Please stay seated,” one of the flight attendants spoke.
“You were hit by an AIM invention,” Bruce replied. “You kid self made an appearance here too. And… he just left.”
“We decided to give you all some of your things, like toys, which you all got close to when you guys were babies,” Kayla said, sounding reluctant. “We thought, you guys might want it.”
“What can I say? I support my boyfriend in all his endeavours,” Steve shrugged.
Peter started to look around him, thinking for a solid answer. “I was… you know there is this Vietnamese restaurant there… Yeah it’s not that expensive and I went there for dinner.” He smiled.
Thor stood under the tall trees for a while. As a leaf dropped on him, the Puddle revealed itself. He collected the liquid and stored it in a little glass bottle, which was made in Asgard.
“Yeah.” Sam turned to Tony. “How is Rhodes?”
Bruce chuckled. “You believe in all these crazy people huh?”
“Friday! 12am was 10 hours ago!!” Tony shouted at the ceiling while putting on his shirt. He grabbed his blazers and pants and ran out of his room.
“You should avoid mirrors,” Natasha shrugged at him.
“No look,” he stopped her. “I know I gave you a hard time. I'm still mad. But I know I made you suffer too. I'm sorry.”
“Oh my God Nat look it’s you!” Tony giggled. He stretched out the Black Widow teddy bear to her. She took it and sat down at the edge of the bed.
“Alright alright Thor,” Bruce chuckled. “Calm down yeah?”
“Sir, excuse me,” one of the female flight attendants said to Thor. She nodded at his stretched out leg.
“Likewise, I’m gonna have words with Pepper.” Tony leaned back on the deck railing.
Hey everyone!
“While the three of you argued, I took that distraction as an opportunity to take the last one. Sometimes, you have to be smart, Clint,” Natasha said while munching.
“This is just breakfast!” Steve laughed.
“I’m sorry, Tony,” Sam apologized. He was embarrassed and sad.
Tony flew to him and ripped his seat belt away from him. Strucker was immediately sucked out of the jet and launched into the air. Tony got out of the falling jet and caught Strucker.
“To be holding grudges for so long! When it wasn’t even my fault!” Natasha shouted at him, throwing the butter knife across him into the sink.
“Wow, you’re eating that as sadly as you could,” Natasha’s voice broke him out of his reverie.
“I’m taking you to The Vault,” Fury told Strucker. He turned to the team. “Thanks for your help.”
“Tony, it’s just you coming back here,” Steve pointed out. He walked and stood in front of Tony, knowing damn well he could get the little one’s eye contact.
“Not a problem,” Rhodey shrugged.
“I’m ready. So glad the quinjet still has many of my arrows,” Clint said. He was already holding his bow and was inserting his arrows into his quiver.
They still had the elevator ride to endure. Tony stood behind Steve as his bedroom was a few levels higher than Steve’s. He managed to see Steve’s hunched shoulders and how sad he looked. Loneliness radiated from this man, and suddenly, Tony felt bad arguing with him so much.
“Yes. I had Happy do the background check.”
Steve was confused. He was not sure how the Frost Giant came to the right location. But after the Frost Giant asked for the stone, realization dawned upon him. Once the stone was used, whether to open a portal or to de-age, it would be activated. Anybody who was holding on to the second half of the stone, could detect the energy released from the other stone easily, in fact, they could feel it.
Steve licked his lips. “So that’s it. They were just random questions and you answered what you randomly felt.”
“Good luck,” Tony wished him. Scott gave him a salute before jumping into the pipe.
Once the coast was clear, Tony called it. “Thor now!!”
Tony’s HUD lights were flashing warning signs and multiple alarms were ringing crazily inside.
Within 10 minutes, some of the Avengers found themselves walking down the street, wearing casual clothes.
"Stee, can I be star?" little Tony pointed at the sky and asked. They stopped for a minute near the empty field before turning to go home. Steve was carrying him. He was holding Bucky by placing his arm across his little chest. Bucky was standing near Steve's legs. He was hugging them while kicking the grass.
“Captain,” Thor said as he entered the store. “I need to bring these two boys with me. The liquid has finished. I’ll destroy the first stone and bring them back.”
Clint and Thor decided to jog around the field for a while.
How will this battle end though?
“The drill, Master Stark,” Jarvis rolled his eyes. He left the room, leaving Steve to chuckle while leaning against the door of the walk-in closet.
“If I may add,” Vision said. “Over half of them are there because they genuinely care about you.”
“F.R.I.D.A.Y, please tell me Cap is on his way,” Tony sighed.
“Got pissed,” Clint shrugged.
“I’ll get you to them,” he assured her.
“Who are his parents?” another female voice asked.
“I never really had any friends,” Tony shrugged. “But I’m so glad older me does!”
“Someone’s worthy,” Sam smirked.
“They want to show us that we are weak, defenseless,” Iron Fist added. Their conversation went on and they were fighting back. But Tony was thinking. He knew there could be something done here. But he needs a few more team members to arrive before he can think about doing something.
“And I got to witness that firsthand,” Natasha added on.
After getting their injuries patched up, most of the heroes had temporarily taken shelter at Avengers Tower. Some were seated and others were standing there, waiting to get one last debrief from anyone of authority, before parting ways.
Tony laughed to himself as he heard the commotion he had just created. He went back to 6-39, and to his room. He switched on the ceiling fan and air conditioner and placed all the pieces of paper on the ground, so that they would dry soon.
While waiting for the two super spies, Tony found himself telling Steve about his school, and about how he was the smartest kid there. Hence, he barely made any friends. He told him about eating ice cream with Jarvis on warm afternoons, about the trip to the beach he had with Jarvis and Ana. He also mentioned that his aunt Peggy visited him all the time, and she always told him stories about Captain America. He said at times when Howard got really abusive, aunt Peggy was there to defend him. Tony grinned at the end of sharing some things with Steve; which adult Tony obviously hadn’t shared.
“Heya Natasha!” Tony sighed, still brisk-walking. “Look, I don’t know who James Wesley is but Clint is on his way to maul that guy’s ass so I suggest you try to look for him and stop him.” After a pause, Tony continued. “Same, Natasha, same. I’ll see you at Business School then.”
“Okay!” Jarvis announced. “The last round! We are currently in a draw!”
He found himself walking up to the room where the babies were. The room door was ajar. He heard water running in the bathroom. Knowing that Kayla was out of the room, he went in. All the babies were fast asleep. Steve walked towards Clint’s cot. It was near the window and was the first one.
He then brushed away his tiredness, and slammed down into Tony. His hips jerked up in a fast pace, leaving Tony to moan out a garbled mess of words. Steve grit his teeth and continued to stimulate himself. Tony was shaking under Steve. This went on for a couple of minutes, with Steve getting hard again and Tony on the brink of an orgasm.
“Nice right,” Steve smiled. “This area is bound to get crowded, I mean, it was during lunch.”
Hi guys, I was supposed to update this fic a long time ago. Sadly, my laptop crashed and I lost every single fic of mine, including this which I was close to completing. I had to re-write every single work of mine, and many are still WIPs.
“Yes genius, you did,” Natasha laughed. “It’s time to go to bed, little one.”
“I don’t mind. I’m really hungry,” Luke smiled. “What about you two?”
“Since I know myself, I just want to tell you this,” Tony said. “I’m not good at saying how much I love people. The only people I ever said that to was to Jarbis, Ana and indirectly to my mom. But… I saw the photos on the table. Adult me must really love you guys a lot. I only spent a few hours with you all and I already love you all!”
The Frost Giant had pushed Kayla with such a force, that she landed near the stairs, her face hitting one of the balusters hard. She collapsed, with a nose bleed.
“Ana has a secret crepe recipe,” he grinned. “The entire Stark family loves it too.”
“Sure, your majesty,” Bucky dissed him.
“That’s great,” Tony said.
“You didn’t brush your teeth?!” Clint whispered harshly, grimacing.
Tony and Steve were seated right at the front. They raised their arms and screamed when the roller coaster descended. Both of them let out a laugh when they somehow heard Thor’s screams.
Jenny looked taken aback by Tony calling Pepper informally. She snapped out of it and rang someone on her phone.
“I could offer a massage, as a truce?” Thor asked innocently.
“I’m sorry,” she whispered. And a tear drop rolled down hey eye.
I hope you guys are enjoying the story so far.
Sam smiled at that. They have been walking regularly, with the support of the leg equipment for Rhodey. The exoskeleton Tony provided Rhodey was helping him so much. He had crutches now.
“So only certain people can pick up his hammer?” Danny asked.
The screen near the pilot seat lit up. Tony looked up briefly before turning to the screen. While Steve turned away.
Thor had swung an arm around Tony’s shoulders, while Tony was supporting Thor by placing an arm around his hip. He was still holding onto Mjolnir.
“Clint, let me give you some advice,” Fisk went up to him. “Girls like Natasha should be earned, not just picked randomly, especially, by someone like you.”
There is one thing about Tony. He simply hates it when someone takes any of his friends or someone he cares deeply about, hostage. He hates it so much. It is the one thing that makes him very
“Will do.” Bruce turned to Tony. “Hey, you alright?”
“It’s okay, we’re all fanboying,” Clint winced. He turned to Natasha.
“It’s my duty,” Wanda smiled back at him.
The channel had stopped that live broadcast and had switched back to the studios, where a perplexed looking man was seated. He let out a nervous laugh before moving on to talk about what social media was saying about the whole ordeal.
General Ross let out a cold laugh. “You’re lucky Tony is all banged up and isn’t here. I would have liked to have had several words with him and they all aren’t pleasant!”
“Here’s your package,” Tony pushed Strucker at Fury, who grimaced at the sight of him.
“No…” Doctor Strange muttered.
Will they get back home? Let me know what you thought about this chapter! Thank you :D
The plane banked to its left, which made the sunlight slip away from Steve’s face. A few seconds later the plane banked to its right. Steve slowly opened his eyes when the sunlight hit his face again.
On their way back, there was the usual press gathered at the entrance of the Tower. They were always snooping around for the scoop; with some journalists wanting to reach a milestone in their career. Once they saw a little boy on Natasha’s arms, they jumped in.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You and me, we’re gonna have a chat!” Tony said as he flew towards the top of the Brooklyn Bridge.
“Tony?” Pepper raised an eyebrow, surprised that he was in the office. “What brings you here?”
“Steve,” Tony breathed out. “Don’t… make prom… promises you can’t keep.” He motioned for Thor, who kneeled down immediately by his side. “Here is the hammer. It was… nice to hold her. She saved… my life. She’s the reason why… I didn’t de-age or disappear off the face of earth.”
“It’s already up there, at the master bedroom.” Kayla answered them.
Steve slowly started to straighten up. He caressed Tony’s cheeks and had his eyes closed. Tony was sliding off the bed. But he didn’t care. A moment like this might never come back again as Steve and the others might go back into hiding. So Tony gave everything he got.
“Enjoy dinner kids!” she waved at them.
“What the heck are you talking about?” Kayla’s voice was suddenly low. She was glaring at Linda.
“Tony, I hope there are no big plans today. I want to catch some sleep man!” Clint yawned.
“I-C-U-P,” Steve answered.
“You’ve got quite the attention here,” Natasha observed. She was standing beside Tony and they both were watching Clint and Thor torturing Steve.
Thor did some fake karate moves and accidentally backhand slapped Clint’s face. Bruce’s eyebrows shot up, while the rest of them stopped walking.
He was hovering in the air. And the little girl squealed in joy.
He looked at his message one last time and hit the send button. After that, he stuffed his phone back into his pocket. Then he took out his Avengers ID card which Tony made for each of his teammates. He sent an alert to Thor.
Tony jerked awake. He was panting and was holding onto the car seat. He was squeezing the leather seat, leaving marks on it. His face felt hot, even though it was coated with sweat.
“Right Linda,” Kayla agreed. She could feel a slight amount of tension in the air. She turned towards the gang. “My mum is on vacation now. She was uh, stressed, so she went to Asia to de-stress. She will be back in another 3 weeks’ time. So, what would you all like to have?”
The song ended. Steve assisted Tony on blowing the candle. Steve blew it away, but he acted like Tony blew it and was grinning at him. “You’re so strong, young man,” Steve complimented the little boy he was carrying. Tony smiled while looking at the cake and then at Steve.
“Help me?!” he immediately roared.
“Isn’t that what guys have?” Scott thought out loud. “My neighborhood boys used to say that.”
Steve was just staring at the arm and so was Bucky. Tony took the arm and was already fitting it for him. He held his shoulders gently, while making sure the arm goes into place properly.
“Jarvis, is Howard here?” Steve asked.
Tony sighed. He really didn’t have the energy to argue with his dad. “It’s my wish. I do what I want and I date whoever I want. I have work to do, dad, please step out of my way.”
“No arguments.” Steve said firmly. “I’ll stay. A nap, just for a while.”
“I want an even more thrilling ride after this,” Clint declared.
“The fuel is enough for 16 consecutive flights to East Somerville from Manhattan,” the AI replied. Tony nodded. This was more than enough for them to get to where Bruce was.
“Yeah there are many tablets actually,” Tony said, eyeing Rhodey with suspicion.
“That was powerful,” Sam commented.
“Such a good friend,” Thor grumbled to himself.
” Iron Man shouted. He flew towards her to check on her when another ice hit him straight in his arc reactor. Iron Man fell down too. But within seconds, his unibeam was activated. The ice melted but Steve knew the man inside the suit was shaken. “
“What the hell, Steve!” He exclaimed.
The room door opened, and Wanda entered while pushing in a wheelchair. She was panting.
“And I bet that pun was intended,” Natasha raised her eyebrow at Tony, who grinned back at her.
“Thor, on my mark you’ll throw the soft remnants at the portal,” Tony said. “The rest of you at 186, get out of there!”
Bruce knelt down and let out a groan, slowly opening his eyes. He looked at his teammates staring at him in awe. He was even more surprised to find himself holding onto little Tony.
“It’s
“I’m great,” Tony tried to convince them. But his voice went a little high-pitched, which meant he needed to stabilize himself.
“I’m in,” Clint grinned. “Can’t wait to see who is gonna scream like a girl for the first jumpscare!”
Steve went to the kitchen while Kayla prepared to sleep on one of the spare beds.
“Merci beaucoup,” Tony bowed down.
I hope you enjoy this story! Thank you so much for your support and Happy Reading!! :)
Tony already loved the future, because his dad’s points were being proven wrong.
“Where are they?” he asked Natasha and Steve.
“You’re kidding, right?” Tony straightened up. “No, tell me you’re kidding. Jane… I came here to check on you because I heard you crying!!”
“Yeah, Nick’s a nice guy and his fiance cooks so good! Damn, he’s gifted,” Tony said.
“So, is the cure here?”
“Yeah. And actually, I have something to tell the both of you,” Steve announced. “I don’t know how to put this. But both of you are actually in the future.”
Natasha was looking at Tony while Wanda was looking at Bucky. She felt as if everyone had their regrets. She saw the tears in Bucky's eyes when Tony was watching the footage of his parents. She saw Steve stopping Tony. She also saw Tony's face after realizing that Steve knew about his parents all along. She saw Steve dropping his shield and walking away with Bucky, who had lost his metal arm.
The room door opened and Bruce, Natasha, Thor and Clint exclaimed in unison, “Good morning doctor!!”
“Nowhere to run,” the man laughed. “Oh Tony Stark, AIM will have you now and we would like to thank you in advance for your services.” He walked in front of the stairway door and blocked it.
Tony leaned in closer, his heart hammering against his rib-cage. This was happening. This was so happening. He could feel Steve’s warmth, he could even smell his aftershave. He was so close to him and this was what Tony had desired all along, but was too scared to admit. Apparently it was what Steve had wanted too.
Natasha froze. But she recovered quickly and greeted Clint back, “Morning.”
“Jessica, listen to me,” Luke's voice was heard. “You’re… You survived that accident. Okay? You’re okay.”
“I’m glad you know me,” Clint smiled. He then turned back.
Clint and his runs. This was the fifth fucking round!
“Steve’s hit, guys!” Natasha said on comms.
“What idea?” Obadiah seemed more interested. He walked to the desktop and stopped behind Tony. “Hmm, Stark solar panels?”
“Clint...” Natasha whispered.
“I’m on my way, guys,” Sam’s voice suddenly came over the earpiece.
. This was something he had to deal with himself. At the moment, Steve was unsure of what to do.
“Let me be blunt. You need to talk to Steve,” Clint said.
Tony didn’t need to be told twice. He ran up and reached Steve, who was shivering despite the hot sun hanging above him.
“Of course, it’s the Avengers’ property!” Clint retorted. “So, are we boarding?”
Tony slowly moved up and saw Steve asleep right beside him, in a very uncomfortable position. He was seated on a chair but was leaning onto the bed, holding onto Tony’s hand. Behind Steve, there was a rollaway bed, shared by Thor and Clint. The bed was under heavy strain at Thor’s side. But both of them looked peaceful while asleep. On his left, there was another rollaway bed, which was occupied by both Bruce and Natasha. They were sleeping peacefully.
Not pity. Just a soft look which was what Tony appreciated about her. She didn’t feel sorry for Tony, which was the last thing he wanted anyone to feel. And it wasn’t his pride talking. He felt sorry for himself so why should someone else add to that feeling too?
Thank you so much, guys!
Bruce turned to look at Clint doing jumping jacks with Thor, who was jumping around messily.
Tony exited the elevator, feeling more relaxed now. He went to his room and grabbed his phone that was on the nightstand.
Whitney’s face turned darker as she glared at Tony. “You asshole.”
“Let them go and you will get your stone,” Steve managed to say after he calmed himself down. “Let them go.”
“Attack it at its waist area!” Steve said and examined the street. People were still running in utter panic, some crashing onto one another. Steve decided to help them up before dashing down the street to the bank.
Tony told this to Bruce, who heaved a huge sigh of relief. He thanked Tony for his help.
With that, he walked out.
“No…” he whispered to himself. “But what could possibly go wrong?”
The rest of them looked at each other, noting that Loki was not a topic to be raised in front of Thor, considering how sour their relationship sounds just from Thor talking about it.
“I could read him,” Wanda said. More tears fell. “He is very broken. He is… is sad.” She pointed at Tony. Steve turned to look at him. His heart sank.
Natasha’s left palm landed flat on his face, like a slap. Steve snorted.
Natasha swatted him in the head before walking towards the back door. She was laughing and a blush travelled up her cheeks.
“You sent some onto my hand,” Clint huffed. He wiped the moisture away and gave Steve a light-hearted glare.
“No!” Bruce shouted. He ran back down the stairs to push Wanda away from the stone.
Tony was wearing a shiny grey three-piece suit. His tie was light brown, and pants was just perfect for him. His face had a good amount of foundation, and his hair was all gelled perfectly into place. He simply looked like a celebrity.
“We hope we can work more with the Avengers,” Sue smiled.
“Oh boy, Tony,” Scott called. “You have no idea what I’m up to.”
That sent Tony wheezing away.
He rested his head on Steve’s firm chest. Steve pulled Tony closer to him and allowed his warmth to embrace Tony.
“So uh,” Tony rubbed his neck. “How long have you been here?”
“Strucker is about to destroy New York, we need to Assemble,” Tony said with urgency.
She pulled Steve into an embrace. He hugged her back, after two seconds of hesitation. Steve was so tall that Kayla had to tip-toe to be able to fully rest her head on his shoulders.
The jet flew over one of the portals. There was a slight turbulence. Clint and Wanda held onto the sides of the jet as they lost their balance. Natasha and Bruce held onto Thor, who was holding Mjolnir very tightly. Steve held onto the pilot seat’s headrest. Tony gritted his teeth while maneuvering the bird and Bucky was focused on the battle ensuing outside.
“I will, okay?” Tony shrugged. “Give me time.”
“Next time, look out for your daughter,” Tony said in a fierce voice. He turned to Aurora with a softer tone. “And you, continue to shine bright, little one.”
Tony flinched at how raw that statement was. “Okay, how about we don’t talk about your father’s death until the end for a surprise twist effect?”
All the Avengers gathered around Tony. He was hugging the teddy bear and posed for the photo. Clint took the first polaroid and kept it. He took another one, this time, with all of them grinning. He decided to give that to Tony.
Steve’s full attention was on her. His enhanced hearing helped him listen to her while the others were still arguing.
“Can I hold the hammer?” Tony asked.
A chubby baby Clint looked up at Bruce. He gave a very subtle smile, followed by a giggle.
He and Bruce jumped into the car and Clint scrambled to get in. Tony started the engine and winked at the other three, who were looking at them in the car with their lips pursed.
Tony whistled to himself and jogged over to Clint’s and Natasha’s room, which was in a total mess.
So, the leader of the Frost Giants, who has the stone now had sent one of his people to negotiate for the second half of the stone, in a manner that Steve detests.
Iron Man flew towards the first portal, about 52 meters away, opened on 186 Bleecker Street. There, Jessica Jones and Luke Cage were doing their best to push back the armies into the portal. Daredevil and Iron Fist were fighting with a single opponent. Doctor Strange was using his powers to push back the armies. Vision was using his high density form to try to knock them off their feet and Spiderman was webbing 3 Frost Giants together.
“I already informed them when I was starting the jet,” Tony spoke up. He was looking straight ahead, this time thinking about what he was going to do in the battlefield. “They said they were already on their way.”
“Alright. I didn’t really expect that but… okay. Then in that case, drop me where Bucky is.”
“Your highness, thank you.” Tony spoke.
Bruce was trying to lift Thor’s hammer, again. He saw the photo Linda had secretly taken and was speechless. He had tried lifting Thor’s hammer before but it didn’t even budge. But his younger, two-year-old self could lift it. He grunted while trying to pull the hammer up now. Thor was chuckling at his attempts. He was seated near the window, patting Chippy, who was half asleep.
“I don’t think Wanda should be hindered. She needs full rest- “
“Shit!” Tony cursed under his breath. But he managed to calm himself down. After a deep breath he continued. “I meant, Bucky Barnes, got mixed up. I want to get to my point straight. Ok, I… I am really sorry. For everything.”
“Worse than you can expect,” Tony said. “I mean, I threw up on his uniform, that’s bad, right?”
“What is it, little guy?” Steve asked him. Bucky pointed at the cake, and then at Tony. Steve didn’t understand. In fact, it took him a while before he did. “You want to feed Tony?” Steve was smiling. Bucky nodded his head.
“Have some respect, General,” Rhodey gritted his teeth. “What do you want?”
They were all walking down together to the basement, after an awkward silence started to fill in the attic.
“Steve?” she called out. “Hey, break out of it!”
Tony on the other hand was so glad he was able to thank his one inspiration, his idol, Captain America himself. At that age, his only wish was to see and talk to Steve. It got fulfilled, even though it was just for a short time. Little Tony was sure going to miss his time here in the future; in his future.
He walked to the edge and stood there, listening to the sound of the waves kissing the shore.
“I should go,” Bucky muttered. He left the room.
“We didn’t have a thing,” Clint shrugged. “Right, Bobbi? It was just a smile thing, right?”
Bruce stared him. After a while, he took the toy. He gave Clint an endearing grin. Clint grinned back. Linda seized this opportunity to finally feed him. She let out a satisfied sigh, which made Steve snicker.
“Wanda, you are a very strong lady and you deserve to know it. You deserve what is the best.”
“Okay,” Steve sighed. “I’m just gonna ask a few questions. Can you answer them
"So that would explain why kid Tony felt the feeling of an arc reactor on his chest earlier..." Steve thought to himself.
Wanda gave Steve a long look before running down the street to the bank.
“I’ll leave after dinner though!” Sam shouted once he exited the room. Rhodey grinned at that.
Steve looked at the half open front door. He went out, ran down the porch and onto the road. He looked at all the directions. It was empty. There was a lady walking with her young daughter down the street. That was all. Steve pushed back his hair in frustration.
He carried each one of them and gave a kiss on their foreheads. He had something to say to each of them before putting them on the cot.
“Thank you,” Steve whispered.
“Tony,” Happy sighed. “After that security breach thing during the Gala, I’m scared Pepper is going to demote me.”
“I’m sure you can sell all the toys and lab equipment,” Tony smiled. He walked towards the girls and gave them both a hug. “Any of you girls need a job, just call me. I left my number in the lab. Thank you so much, you two. Take care.” Tony left them to switch on the controls and engines.
The Frost Giants didn’t dare come out of the portal. They ran back in and never turned back, screaming.
“Bruce, I’ve got an idea,” Tony was saying while walking to the second floor landing.
“I’ll tell Kayla and Linda.” Tony was walking down along with the rest of the team. Bruce sighed and joined them.
How do you find the story so far? Please leave a feedback, I'll be more than happy to read it! :)
Scott was de-aged to about a 4 year old boy.
Wanda was ready to carry the stone using her powers. She told herself that she could do this, that she will be successful. Steve had encouraged her a lot. He gave her a pat on the back before she went to the basement.
Both of them were hovering a few meters above the others.
One of the AIM scientists moved to get Tony. Steve threw his shield at him and knocked him out. Tony let out another shudder and hid behind Steve’s leg.
Steve decided to take a sip of water from the glass he was holding.
At 1pm, Tony decided to get himself lunch because he hadn’t eaten for over a day, and Friday had strongly advised him to at least get a snack. No,
Tony didn’t say anything. Clint helped him up. He also brushed away the dust from his shirt and checked for any injuries. The Black Sabbath shirt Tony was wearing, was practically hanging off him. His pants were completely off.
Tony saw the night sky quickly moving further away from him. The cool New York air was literally hitting his face. He thought that this was it. He was going to die and would not live to be his adult self. He thought of closing his eyes and accepting his fate. That was when he saw Mjolnir charging towards him, leaving a smoky blue trail in its path.
So, the 6 of them decided to spend their last night in Malibu watching a horror movie. They decided to shut the curtains and door in Tony’s room, and placed a ‘do not disturb’ sign outside. Ana helped them bring in popcorn and drinks and left them to their own devices.
“Boss, armor integrity…” the AI said, one last time. Tony’s eyes widened.
All of them sat back on the couch properly. Natasha adjusted her hair. She ate the little piece of crepe that was left in her hand. Thor was eating the one he had snatched away from her. He tore a medium-sized piece and gave it Clint, who silently began nibbling it.
“Take care Tony,” Natasha smiled at him. She gave his forehead a kiss and patted his head.
“Yeah, I picked up every trash can and even tossed them back. I don’t see ‘em,” Luke affirmed.
“No!” Bruce and Bucky said in unison. “Stowy again!” Wanda piped up this time.
“Yes, I’d love that please,” Tony replied.
“No,” Bruce shook his head. “Thor knows how to bring them back. And I hope he comes soon.”
“Brucey?” Natasha asked, not believing that Bruce approved of nicknames.
“Yeah Tony, I know. It’s just a couple of miles away from Santa Monica,” Natasha assured him.
“Tony,” Rhodey’s voice came through instead of his AI's. “I’m looking at the alley with the help of your girl and details forwarded by Sam from Redwing. The stone and leader
Tony straightened up. Steve handed him a handkerchief silently. Tony wiped his mouth, feeling embarrassed about what had just happened. He easily ignored the odd looks a few tourists were throwing him. But he couldn’t ignore Steve’s stare burning a hole into his skull.
Tony turned to look at Clint, with a sinister smirk lighting up his face.
“It’s alright Hawkeye,” Steve assured him. He gave Clint a pat on the shoulder. “But Tony, do you remember why you went to touch the stone?”
*Tony experiences a very minor breakdown and anxiety*
“Don’t do that to yourself,” Steve said, voice slightly quiet.
Tony went into the walk-in closet to take out his presentation clothes. Steve too, did the same thing. Before Tony could walk out, Steve grabbed Tony’s arm and stopped him.
“Well,” Thor grinned. He was sitting on the bed, waiting for Bruce to finish up. He was wearing a suit with a grey shirt, and black tie. His shoes looked really polished and Thor was simply looking stunning. His golden locks were tied into a neat ponytail. “Waiting for friend Bruce.” Thor said.
“Tony,” Steve shook his head. “Stop lying and get the civilians away to safety. Get your suit to come here but before that, stay safe. I’m going to hold off the first wave of Hydra soldiers.”
“Have you met me?” he let out a laugh. “I called for a press conference right after getting out of Afghanistan. Steve, I can face the familiar faces after a nightmare.”
“I have something for you,” Tony said to Steve.
“Oh God…” Tony groaned.
“Thanks Thor,” Natasha smiled. “I can say the same for you too.”
What is gonna happen in the gala, though? Leave a feedback if you'd like to! <3
“Yes,” Bruce said. “I said if he messes it up purposely, I’ll unleash the Hulk at him. That thought itself terrified him.”
“Jarvis, warn us if Tony is in danger. Keep an eye on him,” she ordered.
Little Tony was listening to all these. He already knew he wouldn’t be spending much time with them anymore. And that he has to go back to his mundane life where his dad scolds him all the time. But he smiled when he thought about going back to Jarvis, where he truly felt at home. At least he was fun and was a human version there; not some disembodied voice. As much as he tried to be positive, the fact that he was going to leave Captain America behind broke his little heart. He sighed.
“You know Steve,” Tony said while chewing a fry. “Despite me having a thing for water, I do like the ocean. There’s something calming about it. The seaside, sitting at the shore and listening to the rhythm of the waves, I love it.”
“He said he does not feel worthy of the Cap mantle anymore, especially after what happened in Siberia,” Tony said while firing some repulsor blasts at a Frost Giant. “He’ll be on comms.”
“Steve?” Bucky placed a hand on his shoulder.
“Yeah!” Clint sat back and grinned. “I’m a 21
Steve got triggered by the bad word. He turned to Clint and opened his mouth but Tony cut in.
“He is still hanging over,” Thor frowned.
“Yeah whatever, it’s the truth,” Tony sighed. “What did you want your invention to do anyway?”
He exited the suit, adjusting his tie. “Jarvis, sentry mode.”
“Not much of a lab Tony. Just the basics.”
“Fury, you there?” Clint asked in his comms.
Thank you for all your support, guys! I truly truly appreciate it!!! Love you guys so much!
Clint had placed an arm around Natasha and was standing there, wishing he had more time to look at the shooting star. Bruce and Thor were kicking the grass, and Thor was lamenting about how he would have won if he wasn’t so careless.
After Clint was done, they all shut their room doors, locked them, and walked down the stairs.
“Vision, take Thor,” Tony said. His tone was so commanding Vision obliged without even questioning.
Steve knelt down beside him and closed his eyes. He knew Rhodey shouldn’t have been a victim. He let out a sad sigh, as he turned to look at the man still trying to rise up above his challenges.
Hey guys! The weekend is here and I hope you all are having a good one so far!
“Good cooking talents,” Howard let out a laugh. “Something to back them up.”
After getting seats for six, all of them studied the menu for over five minutes before ordering. Food quickly filled the space on their joined tables, and the six of them who were so famished, began devouring the burgers.
“This is far from over,” the leader growled.
He decided to walk in once Steve’s and the others’ little moment was over in the gym.
“I don’t think I’m worthy,” Tony said softly. “Dad always says how I’m good for nothing, and that I’m not worthy of the Stark mantle.”
Steve turned to face Bucky. He let out a smile and walked back. Tony knew Bucky was looking at him. But he didn’t turn. He didn’t want to turn.
The door slowly shut, leaving Steve and Tony alone. Steve grabbed one of the visitors’ chairs and pulled it closer to the bed. He sat down and sighed again.
“I don’t see the brilliance of this plan.”
“Actually it was 70,” Steve corrected him.
“Yeah,” Steve replied. “Nothing new.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I wanna talk about the camping trip I took with my father every year,” Carson practiced with Tony. “My father and I booked a trip to Malibu for a camping trip, in which we always found a way to irritate my mom. Of course we can’t do that now, because my father’s dead.”
They had fallen down when one of the Frost Giants had hit them with a weapon. The weapon had emitted ice onto the cameraman, which had pierced his back. It was melting; blood and water was running down. All these could be seen as the camera was recording their every move. The reporter was helping him up in a haste. Another policeman was also helping them.
He was looking at the clear blue sea just beside the highway. The waves were dancing away freely and the sunlight was already making the water look sparkly. There were some shop vendors at the other side of the highway; there was a man selling strawberries too. Clint loved the view. He just couldn’t wait to go to the mansion and look at the sea from a different vantage point.
Both men left the room and headed downstairs, where Clint was arguing about why he needed six pieces of toasts early in the morning.
“Steeb!” Bruce cackled. He decided to let go of the hammer. The hammer landed on the ground with a thud, which made Steve cringe. Bruce ran to Steve. He lifted the little boy up and bounced him on his lap. “Of course little Bruce is worthy.”
“You wanted me to brush my teeth, shower and spray my manly cologne and then stop you from this fight?” Tony spoke back. “Come on, Clint!”
Tony could swear he saw Rhodey controlling his facial expressions, making him look like he was trying not to cry. Tony gave his best friend’s shoulder a squeeze. Rhodey nodded his head. “But there’s something I’d like to do. You have another one of these right?”
“Slowly,” Linda said. Her voice was slightly shaky.
And then the memory of last night hit him like a runaway train.
Wesley and Fisk shared a look - how did Clint know?
It was very difficult to get hold of T’Challa. After many negotiations within 2 days, did he let Tony know where the secret Avengers were hidden. Tony had to beg for him to allow them to come back. He told them how out of all the people, Bruce Banner had asked for the team to assemble. He also assured T’Challa that there was a safe place for them to hide once they left Wakanda.
“Need help? I’ll get the first aid kit from Phil.” Tony offered.
“Yes Master Rogers,” Jarvis sighed sadly. “This has happened several times.”
Tony placed the girl down before he got in.
“You have a horrible poker face,” he deadpanned.
“Okay, tell me. But if I become a mess please feel free to leave me,” Tony sighed.
“Or we have to argue more with Ross,” Tony shrugged. “See, we need the Avengers united together. What if we were still broken apart while the Frost Giants came here? Can you imagine what would have happened?”
“Portal please, Strange!” Thor requested.
When the silence stretched longer, Thor stepped in. “We demand an answer from you!” he shouted.
“I dealt with it like an idiot,” Steve slammed the plate of PB&J on the coffee table. “I just want to make things right but he ran away, literally.”
At Avengers Tower, Steve was having a PB&J at the communal level. He was watching the news with focus, secretly hoping a super-villain was giving the public trouble so that he could throw himself into fighting him and not think about what he had done last night. He had already wrecked four punching bags in the gym. Never had he felt sorry for punching bags, till today.
“Alright guys,” Tony directed this at the others. “I have had our comms tweaked a little so we can now speak to the Defenders and vice versa. Cap’s ETA is in about 3-4 minutes. I am already looking for the stones. The rest of us, we do our best to push back the armies. Go on!”
Bruce didn’t say anything for a few seconds. He was just staring at the baby’s back, and then back at Steve. He didn’t know what to feel; scared, angry, surprised or aghast. “That’s him?” He managed to ask after a while. His mouth was so dry that uttering those words felt very uncomfortable.
“You asshole!” Clint shouted and splashed some water at Steve.
“You must have said something,” Bruce glared at him. “What did you tell him?”
“Are you out of your mind!” Steve yelled at him. “What do you think you’re doing?” He slowly got up.
Steve let out a soft chuckle. “It’s pain. I just… I just want him to be fine.”
Tony tilted his head to the side, thinking. “Tell you what, I’ll join you today. Let’s get the meetings done, work done.”
“So, a machine,” Natasha asked. “Where would we find one?”
After a ten second ride down, both the cars were parked in front of one another. The 6 of them were sitting together, closely, at the edge of the cliff, shaking their legs. They were passing around the box full of strawberries while chatting with one another. Natasha looked down, and the height didn’t even seem to faze her. She simply shook her legs and looked at the sea.
Doctor Strange sighed. He rolled his eyes. “The stone was here. It was transported elsewhere. And I know it. Now follow me out. I will bring you to it.” He said patiently.
Steve could not bear the silence. So, he decided to break it. “Where are we headed to?” He asked no one in particular.
after a time like this.”
Steve quickly got up and motioned for the driver to back away to safety.
“We can,” Natasha replied calmly. She patiently drove behind them for a while.
“I volunteer Tony Stark,” she said smugly.
Hi everyone! I hope you all are having a good day. Thank you so much for your support!
The back door slowly shut, the light disappearing.
And that was how Tony found himself walking at the level below the communal level. He saw a few room doors left ajar, and decided to hide inside one of them. The room he entered was looking quite neat. Pretty grand too. It looked like a hotel suite, with the television mounted on the wall opposite the bed and an attached bathroom to the room. There was a couch and a small round coffee table at the side, right beside the entrance. At the opposite end, right in front of the window, there was a study table. There were several books stacked neatly on it, with pens and pencils scattered around. There was also an easel with an empty canvas, standing right beside the table.
Clint gulped, hoping nothing would happen to Tony. Natasha was carefully watching what was unfolding in front of them, while holding the leader so that he wouldn’t escape.
“You knew?!” Steve looked and sounded scandalized. Tony felt sorry for him for a second, but it changed to love because he loved Steve so much. Steve, someone who couldn’t hide his emotions around Tony, and when he tried, it was always hilarious.
“You’ll be alright?” Steve asked.
“Where is Doktor Banner?!” Tony asked, instead of answering Clint’s question.
Wanda had caught him and was holding him up with all her might. Spiderman had also caught him. The others were looking at Tony, who was staring right back at them. She carefully placed him down. Once the redness vanished, Wanda started to pant.
Steve’s voice kept echoing in his mind.
“Right,” Aunt May laughed. “Oh Captain, some guy called Steve from Brooklyn, your area, bashed my boy up just three and a half months ago! If you could… could you… please?”
After lunch, little Tony got bored of playing board and card games. Thor decided to play hide-and-seek with him.
“Now that’s a good idea,” Clint smiled. “I’m getting coffee. Anything for you guys?”
Let me know your thoughts on the comments below! :)
The girls saw them disperse and got up. Tony and Bruce stayed behind in the lab. The rest of them went up.
Steve looked at his feet before walking away.
“At least I add milk at times. Clint drinks it without a thing!” Tony pointed at Clint.
“Wow Bruce,” Steve let out a soft laugh.
Tony gave the phone back to Jan. “Thanks Jan. I wish I could fly there.”
It became very quiet suddenly. Steve was looking at the floor, his face hot. Bucky was trying his best not to run out of the house.
“We need to find the stone the leader has!” Doctor Strange said. “If these idiots slip by, they could enter my place and take the other stone.”
“It is in here,” Doctor Strange said. He moved his hand in a circular motion. There were sparks and then a portal opened.
“They left to that place Bruce had asked them to go to.”
“Ha! So your soul is brown!” Thor laughed.
“With some clothes on, sexy boy!” Tony laughed as he went up the stairs, while Bruce blushed furiously.
“You know, I heard a guy ask Tony if I was his next date,” Natasha let out a laugh.
Once Tony was outside, he got up from the chair. “Jarvis, tell Bruce that he can find his chair outside the lab.”
If you've got feedback you can leave them at the comments below! I'd be more than happy to read and reply. :)
“No way,” Clint jumped in. “Punishment is punishment. They gotta cook the breakfast! Ana, let them do it.”
“I have other things to do,” Tony tried to leave.
Again, all the laughter died down. Tony’s smile just fell off his face. Howard took a plate and filled it up with food. He sat down at the dining table and started to eat.
“We took the Quinjet. Express service,” Clint grinned.
“I wasn’t,” Steve said firmly. “Now, can I start?”
“Go on,” Bruce said.
Tony curled his arms around his boyfriend and rested his head on his chest for a while. He closed his eyes, relishing the warmth radiating from Steve’s body.
By lunch time, Thor made sure Tony had some clothes to wear.
Without looking up, baby Bucky answered, “No.”
It's a brand new semester and Steve, Tony, Natasha, Bruce, Clint and Thor are already needed to stop a fist fight. Clint and Natasha are signing up for the dance competition and Tony meets Justin Hammer.
Steve was about to counter that when Thor walked to them with a freshly brewed pot of coffee. “Try this, friends!” he said enthusiastically.
“Actually uh, I came up to ask if you wanted milk or orange juice,” Steve said after recalling the question he wanted to ask Tony before he started to apologize.
“I’ll eat this first.” Bruce waved his burger at Tony.
The baby’s eyes stirred open. Deep brown eyes were staring back at him; definitely Tony. Baby Tony was about to cry again. That was when Steve heard the baby’s stomach growling.
-Natasha, 6.30pm
Tony adjusted her on his lap before wiping her face.
“It’s just a scratch, Cap,” Clint said. He was covered in sweat. And had apparently fallen off the building when an AIM scientist tried to be a spy and sneaked up on him. But Clint already knew about his presence, and kicked the AIM scientist. But he lost his balance. Thor had caught his comrade on time but his elbow came into contact with the brick building.
“Noted, boss.” The AI replied. “ETA 2 minutes.”
“Trish?” Luke asked while taking a sip of water.
“Is that for Bruce?” Clint asked. He was giving her a cheeky grin.
“Alright,” Tony smiled, slightly. “I need you to do me a favor. I sent you some energy levels emitted from the stone while I was looking at it on our first day in Boston. Scan this entire area for it. I want to know where those godforsaken stones are.”
Instead of fighting back, Fisk smiled, infuriating Clint more. “You’re jealous?”
This chapter is slightly longer than the others.
Steve stood up. “Sure. Just, take care of them.” He turned to the boys. “Oh, Scott and Tony, this is Thor. A teammate and friend of mine. You can trust him, he’s a pretty funny guy and he’s a God.”
“Surely, Master Banner. I know what to do,” Jarvis said.
“I have a feeling I know who may have instigated him. I’d have to go back to Asgard if I need answers.” Thor sighed. “I can sense bigger threats coming our way. We need to be more prepared.”
I'm so sorry for posting this so late. I've been so busy with my final year project in school. So here's a little warning for chapter 3, it could take a while. But I'll definitely post it!
“I hope so,” Steve sighed.
Tony scoffed softly.
“Avengers,” Steve called. He was still holding Kayla. “We need to Assemble!”
Clint smiled at little Tony’s excitement. “It’s fine. You were the CEO for some time. But then you gave your secretary the position and became the chair man.”
“Yes,” both Thor and Clint said in unison.
“Guys!” Tony called out while entering Thor’s and Bruce’s room. “It’s time, the driver is here!”
“Oh Sam,” Steve waved him off.
“Jarvis, what’s the best eatery here?” he asked.
“Not on my watch!” Steve shouted. He was really protective of Tony and couldn’t just stand there and watch them electrocute him. “Avengers Assemble!” Steve ordered.
As Reed got to work…
“What the hell!” Clint shouted over the comms. “Look at that!”
Tony pressed another button. This time, the back entrance fully opened up.
“I am happy, Tony. I’m actually happy to see you,” Steve said. “I just hate the circumstances of our meeting.”
“Well, that went well,” Natasha blinked while Bruce yawned.
Steve snorted. “I have a clue. You two couldn’t sleep, right?”
Tony screamed and jumped up, bouncing on the bed. His hair was extremely messy, and his eyes were wide open.
“Jeez, you both are warm,” Tony snuggled comfortably between them.
There were many boxes in his room. The clothes that were inside his wardrobe were all neatly laid out on his bed, courtesy of Steve.
Clint’s eyelids slowly fluttered open. He sat up further in the car. He turned around to find all the others except Tony asleep. He rubbed his eyes and was looking out of the window. That was when he saw the view. He couldn’t help but gape at what he was looking at.
“Maybe we got to go,” Scott said. “But it was a pleasure meeting you, Cap.”
“I like your beard,” he blurted out. Scott snorted while Tony raised an eyebrow.
He couldn’t stop thinking about the day, about how it went. About Tony asking him if he could be a star, the look on his face, the Frost Giant strangling Wanda and Steve fighting him. He shuddered when he realized how ill-prepared they all were. At the end, when Steve turned to his right side to fall asleep, he noticed how his hands were trembling.
The team then took the stairs up to level 3. It was just a door to the attic. There were boxes, taped up and neatly arranged. The attic window was covered with a small white curtain. It looked very plain.
He ended up sleeping instead. When he woke up, the time was well past 8pm. He took his phone to look for messages, or even a call from his friends or Tony. Only messages from his friends were there.
“Falcon…” Linda whispered in awe.
Steve nodded at that.
“My life,” Steve sighed.
“Obi said you brought your friends over,” Howard said. “Are you going to introduce us to one another?”
“And then I woke up in Bruce’s lab,” Tony sniffled. He wiped away his tears.
“So Wanda, if I lift Mjolnir, I am…?” He wanted her to end the sentence.
It was barely past 10am.
They all opened their doors and entered their rooms. Clint gasped at the size of it. It was like a suite from some five-star hotel, looking so modern yet simple. The bed was a queen size, with fluffy pillows and a duvet cover. There was a television mounted on the wall opposite the bed. There was a walk-in closet and a study table beside the bed.
“We can play badminton later right?” Thor asked with an innocent grin.
“Wow, okay,” Rhodey said. He shut his book. “You’re not here out of guilt, are you?”
“How long has this been going on?” Steve asked, throwing the two dancing figures an amused look.
“How sure are you about that, Tony?” Thor asked.
“Now where is he…” Tony muttered. “I can’t see you. You gotta show yourself up!” Tony spoke in the phone.
Hi everyone! How are you guys today?
“We need to find him and test out this…” a man dressed in an ugly yellow suit opened the stairway door, that was right beside the kitchen. “There he is! Get him!”
! -Natasha, 7.30pm
“Sorry to break this extremely humorous moment but, do we have a plan?” Clint asked.
“I love you, Cap,” Tony sniffled.
Natasha was looking at both portals. The armies were pouring in, not caring about getting hit by the heroes fighting. Hulk was already smashing the Frost Giants coming out from the second portal, opened at 170 Bleecker Street. Hawkeye was trying his luck on his EMP arrows. Thor was calling lightning and was pouring it straight into the first portal. Some of the Frost Giants got electrocuted while some others escaped out. Wanda was continuously creating shields to protect her teammates when the Frost Giants were shooting sharp edged ice at them.
“Nat, the strawberry place is like in the middle of the way-”
“Damn Jane,” Tony held his heart, acting as if he was hurt. “Is that rejection I hear?”
"What did I just witness?" Bucky added on.
Please let me know how the story is so far :)
“Tony is alright,” Doctor Strange said when Steve sat beside him. “He needs sleep. In fact, all of them do.” Steve nodded. The babies were tired by now.
“The boys are next, Captain.” Thor declared. His loud voice bounced around the house.
Once they entered, several figures stood up.
Tony nodded his head, not trusting his voice. After a brief kiss, they both headed down to the kitchen.
The jet made a perfect landing at the Tower. Both Scott and Sam were standing by the back door, which opened up slowly. The interior of the Tower came into view. Both of them took some time to get adjusted to the light.
“Tonee, Steeb.” Bucky was attempting to climb onto the table. At this point, Tony had already cut the cake.
“Oh my God,” he muttered.
Steve relaxed for a while. Baby Tony adjusted himself on his chest. He whimpered slightly, but fell back asleep.
He saw the pink smoke emerge from the side and knew it was time. He closed his eyes and thought about Steve.
Bucky now saw that everyone were looking at him from below, with awe. It took him two seconds to realize what he had done.
“Steve, you stay here in case Tony comes home,” Natasha ordered. “Clint, take another car and drive around with Bruce. Look for Tony. Thor and I will cover Santa Monica Pier, again.”
Bethany Cabe is from the classic Iron Man comics. In it, she was romantically involved (but it wasn't a long affair) with Tony and was hired to be in his company's security team. In this story AU, she's his good friend.
“Great, Friday, time to wake up and get the armor going! There are civilians!!” Tony said.
Steve couldn’t help it. He picked up the young boy and gave him a hug, knowing full well what little Tony was going through was nearly what Steve went through a while back. Tony hugged Steve back, burying his face into his firm shoulder. He let out a sob.
As if on cue, Thor ran in.
Hi guys! Here's the next chapter in this story. It's all gonna get real exciting in the next few chapters coming, with the dance competition and Tony and Whitney Frost arc!
Also, I have a nice Stony story coming up for this Christmas! Can't wait to post it! :D
“Fury, we all need it,” Steve said with a somber tone.
Natasha could sense Tony quoting his dad’s exact words. She gritted her teeth, wishing they were transported back into time so that she could knock some sense into Howard Stark.
“We hope you forgive us, friend Steve. We didn’t mean to give you a hard time,” Thor sighed.
Hydra attacks Tony in his gala and the Avengers come to his rescue. Also, Steve may have found out something he wasn't meant to find out.
Alright, this is the last chapter for this story. I just want to say thank you so much to everyone for reading this, for leaving their feedback or kudos or even for bookmarking this. It really means so much to me, because I was so scared to upload this at first. But I had constant encouragement from my best friend Ash and I saw that you guys were interested to read too. So I kept going.
Little Tony gave the good Captain another hug. This time, Steve held the little boy closer to him. He was slowly patting Tony’s back. He wished he wasn’t frozen so that he could have spent a good amount of time with little Tony. But nothing can be changed. So Steve held onto Tony a little longer. Before withdrawing, he gave the boy’s wet cheek a kiss. He wiped away his tears and cupped his face with his hands.
“Master Rogers,” he greeted. “What brings you to the roof at this stressful point of time?”
“He’s fine,” she replied, blushing a little. “Plus he’s your best friend so you can ask him that yourself.”
“No. You need to suit up and come with us
Kayla and Linda took Wanda and Natasha respectively. They all went up. Sam and Steve were with the rest of the babies.
“Jarvis,” Bruce started. “This is so good!”
“You do keep a lot of stuff from the past for someone who doesn’t call himself nostalgic,” Clint pointed out.
“Whitney.” Professor Williams raised his voice.
“I do not think they left New York,” Thor said quietly. He squinted because of the sunlight when he looked up at Iron Man. “I am absolutely done with their behavior.”
Tony swung an arm around her, guiding her back to 6-40. He joked a few times, and led her in safely.
“I mean, he can’t just come here and arrest you guys,” Tony tried assuring them. “But he’ll make attempts.”
“I agree. You’re getting somewhere, Tony.” Bruce gave Tony’s back a pat before he went to the kitchen to get something to eat.
It didn't take Steve long to realize what was going on. He sighed heavily, looking up at the deep blue skies.
“Steve?” a voice shook him out of his thoughts. “What are you doing here?”
“Kayla!” she called out. She turned and took a step back. “Tell Brucey-Brucey his companions are here!” She was practically squealing.
Will Natasha and Clint make up?
“Nice place you know,” Clint said. “Gosh I’d never want to leave this place if it were my house!”
“If it’s any consolation, Karen helped us tick the box before submitting. If you’re really pissed, try to figure out who messed up with the pairing results,” Natasha told him, speaking quickly while sounding pissed. She walked out of the apartment and slammed the door behind her.
“You also made Jarvis, the AI that runs the house. You have Friday, the other AI that runs your Iron Man suits,” Steve said, desperately trying to change the topic.
Tony nearly jumped up from his seat and choked on the drink. He spat out some of the milkshake, creating a mess on the table and computer screen. He coughed a little, feeling tears pricking the corners of his eyes.
“Tell you what,” Tony started. He was still in shock. “I’ll bring the girls out for a quick shopping. Bruce, go online and order 3 small baby cots. We can use the guys’ room for the kids.”
“Be ready to close it,” Thor warned Tony.
Thor immediately sprang into action.
“I am always here, young sir,” Jarvis replied coolly.
“With pleasure,” the AI replied. The armor closed and lifted off into the bright afternoon skies.
The seller stood up, happy to have made another sale. He gave Tony the best box of strawberries he had. After buying it, Tony started to walk back to his car.
Natasha sighed before turning to Bruce. “So, you alright?”
“Thanks Wanda, but this is just one cybernaut. I need you to join the others.” Steve ordered.
“See, people love Boston,” Linda smirked. She nudged Kayla at her side. “And some people here
“Good to know, just give Tony and I a minute, please? Thank you,” she smiled at him. Steve scurried out of the room. “So, how are you today?”
“Everyone are at the de-brief room talking about battle strategies,” Friday said.
“I am done, my friends!” Thor’s loud voice suddenly came. It made Clint jerk awake and slide down the luggage back, landing butt first.
“Tony, thank you for existing. You are smart for a toddler. I hope you realize that many people around you care about you. Tony, you give me life. I don’t think I’ll be brave enough to tell you this but, I really love you. I’m sorry for everything that happened before this. I hope you will forgive me. Let’s start a fresh chapter. And remember always, partner, you’re a good man.”
Johnny stepped aside to let Reed start the machine by turning a knob to the right. He then pushed the controls forward. Inside the machine, Tony felt excited as heard the machine whir to life. Various buttons and panels were lighting up. Steve went closer to Tony as he took in the stuff that was happening.
The rest of them settled down for a nap. They were having jet lag issues and couldn’t keep their eyes open. The vehicle’s air conditioner blasting at them wasn’t helping. As the others slowly drifted off into another round of sleep, Jarvis turned the volume of the radio up slightly to let the music accompany him.
Everyone stopped and turned to look at each other.
Everyone left to do their jobs quickly. Wanda and Doctor Strange were working together to push back the army. Spiderman was webbing some up in groups and swung it to where Luke and Jessica were. They punched the groups, sending them back to where they came from. Danny Rand was able to break some of their limbs and he flipped them to the Hulk and to Black Panther, who was using his claws to slice through them. Steve and Natasha were pushing back whoever who crossed the Spanish restaurant. Vision joined them, and used his high density form to knock them off. He dodged some of their punches and ice bullets by changing his tangibility.
Steve slammed open the office door, startling Howard.
He gave Bruce’s back a pat and pulled away from him. The lab doors whooshed open. When Tony saw who had entered, he blacked out for a second. Which caused him to stumble backwards. He landed on Bruce’s office chair.
Just then, Janet and Carol entered the apartment.
“That stone needs to be buried soon,” Bruce said, calloused. The team was at the living room. “And tomorrow, successfully.”
“So, what about your stuff you do outside school?” Bruce asked Clint.
Clint shut the door and walked in with Linda. They both had decided to sit on the floor and watch the film.
After adding some cinnamon powder, Steve turned to look at her. “Things are fine. We’re okay actually. Why do you ask?”
Did he want to know? Tony kept running away from Steve for this reason... did he now want to open a new can of worms? Maybe it would be great to hear Steve’s side of things. Whatever made him forget about the rest of them there and only focus on Tony that night, maybe he ought to know why.
“Dow!” Bucky squealed. He wanted to get down and walk back home, not wanting to be carried by Steve. “Dow Stee!”
“Is… Steve being here a problem? I thought he’s your team leader and needed to know about this machine…” Reed was scratching his head.
“What do you mean by one half?” Steve asked.
“I love you too, Cap!” he smiled.
“Tony, you’re... just in time. We were going through each other’s battle strategies,” Steve sighed. Tony knew Steve was trying so hard not to explode right there and then.
And he came, picturing Tony begging him for touch. He spilled his seed deep inside Tony and let out a growl as his orgasm crashed onto him. Steve closed his eyes, as it had begun rolling. He kept moaning Tony’s name out, and rocked his hips.
“Thor! If I take this away to Earth…” Bruce held out the stone.
“I don’t think I need breakfast for tomorrow,” Bruce laughed once they exited the restaurant. “This restaurant had the best steak ever!”
“With pleasure,” she replied. Rhodey could hear the smile in her voice.
From where he was standing, Tony could see what Steve was up to. He was fighting off ten Hydra soldiers at one go, actively avoiding getting sprayed.
The gang took a nap at 5 in the evening. Only Clint, Tony and Bruce woke up for dinner.
“Intruders probably,” Bruce Banner suggested. He sounded slightly out of breath, which meant he was already going up the stairs to be with his team.
“I will, Iron Man!” Thor replied with enthusiasm.
“Don’t start with me early morning, Clint,” Natasha nearly snapped at him. “It’s been so long and you’re still angry. It’s a bit too much.”
Silence settled in the room for a few minutes. Steve was standing at the window, looking at the white fluffy clouds moving slowly across the cornflower blue skies. Tony had managed to sit at the edge of his bed. He carefully placed the two plushies near his pillows. He turned to look at Steve’s back.
Tony tossed the keys to her. “Okay, two with me, two with Nat.”
“No… I mean… At this point of time, I don’t even know who to trust anymore,” Tony took another bite off his grilled chicken taco and expressed his worry.
“A few hours back, actually,” Tony shrugged. “I woke up early morning and couldn’t sleep back so I watched the sun rise. And then it hit me, about solar energy and the flaws the panels have. With my idea, we can generate more power, income for the company, oh and more press attention.”
“Oh my God so Cap got his best friend back! Dad must be happy too!” Tony squealed again. Natasha let out a small laugh at the excitement Tony showed.
Tony sighed. It was such a long night and he simply wanted to rest.
“Someone who cares about your son more than you do,” Steve glared at him. “And how dare you hit him.”
“Funny you should tell me that,” Clint got up quickly, ready for a fight. “You should keep your authority to your damn self and not mess with external competition pair results!”
“Take care,” Professor Yinsen gave Tony’s shoulder a pat before he walked away.
“Hey, Tony!” Jane called him, with so much of hope. “I may need your help.”
“Half of fish and chips,” Natasha added while examining a tear on her suit.
“I hope Bruce is working on the cure,” Fury said on the other end. “I’m having difficulty talking to Strucker. All he revealed so far was that the liquid was going to be used as a purification to cleanse this City.”
At the hallway in level 6, Bucky was standing near the elevator, waiting for his housemates to come out of their apartment. His eyes widened when he saw Tony running out of 6-39 half naked.
Tony wanted to tell Jarvis to send him a suit so that he could fly away from here. But looking at Steve staring at him expectantly made him realize that running away from Steve or his problems wasn’t going to fix anything. He had to face this head on. So, he had to be honest about his feelings, face Steve’s rejection and deal with whatever sadness coming his way head on. He needed to do this so that Steve could have his answer and so that he wouldn’t be running away every time Steve entered the same room as him.
The team sat there quietly, taking in the information.
“We choose Kick-Ass!” Wanda declared.
He then hacked into the mainframe and waited for a few minutes as it finally gave him authorized access.
“The final touch ups are done. It looks ten times grander than our mansion in New York,” Jarvis smiled.
“Thanks Cap,” Tony said.
Jarvis sighed.
Upstairs, Steve was waiting for Bucky to come out of the bathroom. When he heard his surname below, he wanted to know more about what the girls were talking about. He stood at the edge of the stairs to hear better.
“They seem friendly,” Wanda said while looking at the seemingly healthy plants lined up neatly on the side of the lawn.
“That’s such a specific location,” Tony frowned. “You sure he’s legit?”
And sadly, this is ending pretty soon. Thank you for all your support, guys! I appreciate that a lot!
“Good God, I’m actually hungry.” Everyone in the house could hear Clint’s stomach growling furiously. Bruce nodded at that too. “Do we have a proper meal? Gosh I need to eat something whole, especially now that I know all I had was milk and baby food.”
He then pulled Tony to his side and gave his forehead a kiss. Tony wrapped his arms around his boyfriend and rested his head on his chest. Both of them were standing there and were staring into the horizon. Tony closed his eyes and enjoyed the summer breeze kissing his face.
Tony gave Thor a long look and a smile. The rest of them settled down on Tony’s bed, relishing the comfortable silence that was settling around them. They were already finishing up the box of strawberries Tony had bought.
“Wait what?” Clint flinched. “The last I checked, you had feelings for him!”
"Really? What convinced you that we're not super-villains?" Tony asked.
Scott chuckled.
“They will be powerless! Look, try to get that other stone. I can take this and bury it somewhere on Earth!” Bruce suggested. Thor looked at him and at the stone. An explosion behind them took them both by surprise. “I will take this. Inform me if these monsters are coming to Earth, Thor!”
“Reed has been so focused on this multiverse project. He’s been ignoring other duties,” Sue sighed. “He hasn’t slept beside me in a week.”
“Me too.”
“Bucky please,” Steve sighed. He squeezed shut his eyes. “The comms are still attached to them.”
“Cap! On your left!” Sam’s voice suddenly came through.
“Jarbis?” he called out.
“Come on Steve, it’s not like they’re gonna barge in here!” Tony said.
“It’s called a goatee,” Tony corrected him.
“I have brought the cure, Captain,” Thor announced. He pointed at a glass bottle settled carefully on one of the pouches in his armor. “After they are fully awake, all we have to do is sprinkle this on them. Make sure the water lands on their hair and skin. Give them a minute to recover and the Avengers would have assembled.”
“Don’t be too slow,” Natasha raised an eyebrow.
“Keep these two close to you, okay?” Clint asked. He gave little Tony a hug, squeezing the little boy.
Tony was really mesmerized by what Thor was saying. He pushed himself down the couch, and went to touch the handle. To carry it.
“Tony, I can handle this. You need two shots to get cured.”
Unknown to them, Tony had heard the tail end of this conversation as he was standing at the entrance of the gym. He agreed with Sam on needing to talk it out with Steve. But there was always some sort of barrier there; right, Bruce loved calling it the palpable sexual tension.
,” Jarvis replied.
“It’s okay,” Steve replied, not being able to control his own tears.
Tony quickly slipped his shirt on. He took out his shorts and threw it onto the study tables at the open area.
Steve Rogers walked in, wearing track pants and a blue shirt that was too tight for him. Who was taking him for clothes shopping? Why would they let him dress like this? It wasn’t healthy! For Tony!
Did you enjoy the story? Please feel free to leave a feedback, thank you! And thank you for reading my work! <3
“You mean Hawkeye?” Sam raised an eyebrow. “The stone, did this?” Steve nodded again. Sam couldn’t believe it. But he decided to join the children once Clint started to babble to him.
Tony took in a deep breath. After a long exhalation, he looked into Steve's deep blue eyes.
“We’ve been friends ever since, and best friends after Clint didn’t care about what others said, but hung out with me. I was thinking if we should just be good friends. But then prom came, and he asked me to dance with him. And I realized I had fallen for him; and so did he.” Natasha wiped away her tears and let out a chuckle. “That’s how we met, Bruce.”
“You know, the Accords are still there. But it depends on you guys,” Rhodey shrugged. “Tony and I have been talking to Ross. But there’s only so much we can do.”
So both of them went outside. They went to the middle of the road. There were no cars driving by and no people walking past them. Steve was watching them from the front porch.
“Go we got this,” she assured him.
All in all, life was back to its normal crazy again.
The rest of them nodded their heads. Natasha and Clint left Coulson and Bobbi at the communal level. They went to their rooms to get their injuries checked.
Feedback is appreciated, you can always comment and I'll reply!:)
“What?” he frowned. “How’d you know this?”
“I thought you would have gotten used to it?” Thor smiled and helped Clint up.
“This is a different fuck me!” Tony said in a slightly high-pitched voice. He grabbed his jeans and a shirt with a white shirt from the shared cupboard.
“Fine,” Tony reluctantly agreed. “Help look for evidence. But that’s it.”
“Steve,” Tony gave him a smirk, even in this condition. “You’re my dork.”
And that was just another battle for Tony. Soon, he had to speak to the owner of the food place and settle everything, monetary wise, here. It was just another day. But what a day it was. He almost kissed Steve, who liked him back! He had a heart-to-heart with that one person he never thought he’d make an emotional connection with.
Once upstairs, Tony noticed how Happy was pacing about in front of the CEO office’s doors.
Let me know your thoughts about this chapter! :)
“Ah, so that was him in the suit,” another journalist commented.
By instinct, Steve pushed Wanda away, before taking the full brunt of one of the cybernaut’s hit.
Steve looked out of the store just in time to witness Natasha dive towards the de-aged T’Challa. She grabbed the young boy and landed at the other side of the road, bringing him away from the line of fire.
Thor had landed on the rooftop Bucky was perched on to get an aerial view.
“What in the!” Bruce’s voice was heard.
As expected, no one volunteered. Tony rolled his eyes and was about to raise his hands when Whitney’s arm shot up.
“I’m an expert,” he grinned. He turned to his Professor. “I think my speech went well, right Prof?”
“Yeah, yeah Einstein,” Clint mumbled. Natasha was laughing to herself.
“Steve,” Sam tapped his shoulder. “Will you be alright?”
He trusted Obadiah, so much. He was there for Tony. He was the one constant in Tony’s life. And, he was close to being Tony’s father figure. Jarvis was his ultimate father figure, no doubt. But Obadiah was there, encouraging him to pursue engineering and to help out with the company. Could he really be dealing under the table, with Stark Industries’ rival?
Tony’s computer screen lit up. F.R.I.D.A.Y was asking if he wanted to put the plane on autopilot mode. Tony rejected it. He wanted to be on manual. He felt a hand on his shoulder. He didn’t want to look up. Not when his eyes were red from fighting back the tears of frustration and just sadness.
Tony walked over and paid first, using his credit card. Steve was walking behind the others, admiring Tony’s shape. He also saw the little bulge Tony had, his tight pants exaggerating it even more.
“Whoa fuck!” Tony shouted when he heard Clint. He scrambled to his phone and switched off the music. “And no Clint, that wasn’t a lap dance. I was trying to cheer Steve up.”
“Sounds like you’re gonna make a helluva pitch,” Tony grinned. “I’ll see you tomorrow then.”
Tony’s smile widened.
“It’s a shooting star! Make a wish!” Tony exclaimed. He jumped up and was already running across the field. The rest of them followed suit, losing interest in the game.
“I am sorry,” Thor smiled and pulled his right leg in.
“Well, Pym Particles can be used to shrink objects and people. So when I shrunk, a blade shrunk with me too. I’m cutting the leader’s chain loose so that you can get the pendant,” Scott informed.
“Maybe uh…” Clint started. “Maybe the rest of us could go to another table and leave these two here…?”
“Hello,” Tony smiled. “I’ll get uh, this one box.”
“No it’s alright,” Natasha chuckled. “It did hurt. But we can get over it.”
“Calm down Clint,” Natasha smiled. “We’re still not done with the night yet!”
Hi guys! How are you all?
“Well, who knew Steve Rogers is a parent material,” Sam grinned mischeviously.
“You alright, punk?” Bucky asked. He was giving Steve the pity look. He placed his metal arm on Steve’s shoulder. “You sure about this?”
“Steve, you okay?” Tony asked.
“The last time, they did.” Steve deadpanned. “I don’t want to be caught off-guard again.”
“Everyone,” he started. “Thank you for coming down to help us. I know most of you had something else to do and fighting for an entire night, it’s not an easy feat. So really, thank you. I wish you all speedy recovery from your injuries.”
“Well shit,” Ben’s eyes widened. “We transported two key members of the Avengers to another universe and we can’t bring them back because our machine broke down...?”
“You’re in your lab, Boss. Thor deposited you here roughly five minutes ago before going for a de-brief session with Captain Rogers,” Friday informed him. “Might I also inform you that Captain Rogers is royally pissed at you for doing your job.”
Stupid Hydra, messing with Tony’s life as if it was meant to be messed with.
“In a twisted way, you appreciate what my serum did for you, right?” Strucker looked at Iron Man.
“I don’t think it’s a coincidence,” Steve replied. “I heard screams and thuds from our communal level. Plus, the AIs are down.”
Tony’s eyes welled up when he walked through the portal.
Natasha turned to look at Clint, who turned at the same time.
“Also, you don’t have any shoes on,” Bucky nodded at Tony’s bare feet. Tony opened his eyes and just stared at Bucky.
“Asshat,” Tony corrected Clint.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve did the math in his head. Three and a half months ago, there was a fight between his and Tony’s team in Leipzig Airport. He realized who this
The door opened. A girl, in her mid-twenties, was holding the door. She was wearing jeans and a white crop top. Her face lit up when her eyes met that of Tony Stark’s.
“I love my cake, yo!” Tony grinned. “Please kiss the cook for me?”
While Spidey began telling Steve about his plan, Rhodey had received a video call from the one person he didn’t really feel like speaking to. He opened up the tablet and decided to make it quick. The person’s face was displayed in the screen.
Soon, dinner time was over. The kids returned to play with one another. By now, Bucky and Natasha have become close to one another. Instead of fighting one another, they share toys. They sat together and babbled something. Steve was so happy with this. Clint, Wanda and Bruce played together. They are always filled with giggles. But Tony always played alone. He liked to read science stuff. And assembling puzzles were his absolute favorite. Sometimes he joined the others, but mostly, he was alone, unless Steve joined him.
As if on cue, Tony stepped on a muddy puddle of rain water. He looked at Jan and gave her a sheepish smile, shrugging.
“Is he still calling?” Rhodey asked Tony. He kept his volume low because he didn’t really want the others to hear. “You know I can take it and deal with it, right?”
“Morning,” Tony greeted him. “We’re gonna land soon.”
“I’m sorry I could not come earlier. I was helping with the cleaning of Asgard after a ruthless battle with the Frost Giants. They will be coming to earth, I can sense it,” Thor growled. “Oh the stone, where is it?”
“You know,” Bruce began. “I should have listened to you and should have turned the jet around. I went to a mystical land, came back and put all of us in danger, because of taking something that isn’t even mine, worst, it doesn’t even belong on earth.”
Tony took Clint’s advice and asked Steve to meet him at Central Park with ice cream, like a date. He was waiting for him, feeling excited and nervous at the same time.
“Brooklyn,” he replied, after a firm handshake.
“So b’tiful,” Steve smirked while fucking the life out of Tony.
“What are we up to?” Obadiah’s voice came from the front door even before Tony could click on one of the files.
“Yeah,” Sam said. “Steve wants me there soon.”
“Well,” Tony smiled. “You’re not paying a thing. Now we know, and we will not trigger a thing.”
“So… Wanna talk about it?” Tony asked.
It only took a few more seconds. The portal closed fully with a violent huff of wind. Thor flew backwards but managed to stabilize himself. Tony was caught off guard. He did a few somersaults in the air.
This got nearly everyone’s attention.
After giving Tony a pat on his back, Natasha walked back. All of them, even Bucky, were looking at her. They looked at her as if she owed them some explanation or an answer for a question not asked. She gave them a light smile and a firm nod.
“No.. touch…” Steve whispered out.
The girls were carrying a red velvet sponge cake to the table. Once placed down, Linda lit up a big number 2 candle. It was two since Tony got de-aged.
He was wearing Bermuda shorts and a soft cotton t-shirt, just like the guys. Natasha was wearing a three-quarter track pants and a tank top. Her hair was brushed back neatly, secured into a fine ponytail.
Scott was planning on how to get back to his daughter. Sam was listening intently to Scott’s plan, although he was getting sleepier. Natasha and Clint were seated side by side, in silence. It was not some uncomfortable silence, it was quiet and peaceful. Definitely comfortable. Wanda was walking around the jet. She was touching the interior of jet as she marveled at the complex design of it. She turned her head towards the pilot seat. She was looking at Tony’s back.
“When I was under S.H.I.E.L.D, I always got training, especially on hand-to-hand combat. After joining the Avengers, I jog a lot. I used the gym in the Tower a lot. Yeah I did.” Natasha was looking at the punching bag, a small smile appeared on her face. “Do you? Bucky?”
“Steve,” Natasha sighed. “Bruce and I will be seated outside, if you need anything.” He nodded his head.
Thank you so much for sticking with the story and series so far! Your support means the world to me!
It finally descended, hovering just two meters away from the River.
“Steve,” Natasha placed her hand on his shoulder in a reassuring manner. “Don’t keep beating yourself up over it.”
“So no worries!” Tony raised both his hands. “Hey, where are the stuff?”
By the end of the game, both Clint and Thor were so into the it they started to forget their surroundings. They were laughing loudly, and kept swinging their right arm, which had the remote control.
“Dad,” Tony said, sounding irritated. “Is everything always about rivalry and competition for you? Anyway, I know Obi. He’s a good guy and he won’t betray Stark Industries. I mean, this is the job that pulled him out of the mud!”
“Woaaah!!!” Tony screamed, with a little smile on his face.
“He’s in his office, I wouldn’t advise what you’re about to do,” Tony said firmly.
“He apparently had sprained both his ankles,” Clint grimaced. “I wonder how he landed after destroying the stone.”
“I’m okay,” Tony said softly.
“Everything is but fine,” Thor suddenly said, staring into his bisque. “Friend Steve needs some action tonight with friend Tony.”
“Alright Wanda, whenever you’re ready.” Bruce sighed. He was walking up the basement stairs. Steve was in the process of digging a deep hole at the backyard.
“Big words coming from you, Stark.”
“I used Adamantium. Pretty strong,” Tony said. “I’ll fit it for you.”
“No uh, nothing. So between us, it’s settled right? I mean, no more trust issues and sides to choose from right?” Clint asked. He offered Tony his right hand for a handshake.
“Here,” he stretched it to little Tony. “A little souvenir from the future.”
Bucky decided to walk with Jan, who was limping. Tony jogged out of campus, ignoring some laughter he got his way for looking like a big mess. He made it back to his apartment in one piece, trying his best to swallow the feeling of dread he had because of Clint’s behavior and Natasha losing it.
“He is at the lab,” Linda replied.
In case you weren't familiar with the characters Carson Wyche and Bethany Cabe, they're from the comics.
And then it hit Tony like a runaway train. This was a setup. Both women had conspired against them and had lied to them so that they would talk to each other.
The good Captain was standing in the penthouse, looking out of the windows. He was staring at the other buildings, thinking. He was feeling conflicted. Should he not go there? But if he doesn’t, it’s like he was selfish. He dropped the shield for a reason and it didn’t feel right to pick it up again. Yes, there were many heroes assembled there, fighting the battle. But they needed a leader and he was a natural at it. They need him and he simply deserted all of them.
The Frost Giants at the second portal were looking at their first with awe. It was lit up with fire and lightning. Those who were in the portal started to melt. And it was beginning to close.
He looked at the babies. Kayla was helping Clint and Bucky finish up a painting of a big goldfish. Natasha and Bruce were silently coloring, tongue slightly sticking out of their mouths. They were pressed beside one another. But Wanda and Tony weren’t here. That’s odd.
“You three will have to make breakfast for us tomorrow,” Tony said. He jumped off the hood and walked to where the guy selling the strawberries was seated. “We’ll talk to Ana about that later.”
“You’re tall.” Her voice was muffled. Steve let out a laugh. It was genuine, relaxed and comfortable.
Great, there was a huge possibility of a media ambush as the Quinjet was parked here. But the fight with Hydra was already all over the news anyway.
He gave both the kids a hug, Tony on his right and Wanda on his left, while Chippy looked up at him with his tongue sticking out, expectantly.
“Fine,” Steve sighed. “I’ll just get wet.”
Tony chuckled to himself, before walking to Steve. He placed his armored arm on Steve’s shoulder to calm him down. Steve held Tony’s hand and took in a deep breath, visibly relaxing.
Steve let out a laugh and leaned back on the wall beside the washroom door. He was waiting for Spiderman to come out, and to be dressed in civvies and look clean, according to the plan. Yes, Spidey had brought civvies with him in case of a time like this.
“Alright Thor. I’m glad you came,” Steve managed. He got up and was walking to the bathroom.
“Shut up,” Clint said fondly yet firmly. “We’re friends. We help each other, that’s what we do. Also, you have done so much for us. This could be our way, or, one of our ways of thanking you.”
“Hey, we’ll get some fresh LA air once we land, Bruce,” Tony smiled. “You’ll be fine in no time!”
“So how is Boston?” Kayla asked Wanda.
“No,” Clint shook his head. “He’s at the kitchen with Nat. Go and get it over with now.”
“Face the consequences of your invention, Strucker!” Tony grinned.
“Did you say Baxter Building and Reed?” Clint frowned.
Bucky was marveling at what he was looking at. He loved the view from the glass windows located high above them. Steve on the other hand, got reminded of the good memories the team spent there before the rift. He looked down while walking towards the elevator.
He grabbed Mjolnir's handle, and whatever happened next to the AIM scientists, was worthy enough to be included in history.
Natasha got up from the couch. She picked up the last piece of crepe and started to eat it, halting the little argument the three guys were having.
Tony smiled a tad too much. “Yes. Everything’s great, couldn’t be more perfect. I’m glad all of you were evacuated on time.”
“They… they usually won’t do it a second time,” Jane’s cheeks turned red in embarrassment. “They… they’ll see me as someone who isn’t responsible enough for her own stuff.”
“No Bruce. You should really save your relationship.” Wanda walked towards the stairs. She stopped for a brief moment. “It’s beautiful and worth a save.” She said softly. She continued to go down the stairs.
Strucker didn’t say anything for a while. He was letting Tony’s words sink in. Even Tony himself couldn’t believe all those wise words just came out of his mouth. Maybe this was what happened when you kept telling the truth.
But he chose not to share this with his friends. He, honestly, wanted them to have fun and enjoy themselves, especially on their last night in Malibu. He managed to grin at the others, completely pushing his feelings away.
He turned to Natasha with a soft smile. Out of everyone at the Tower, Steve found a close confidante in Natasha. She had seen him through some tough times, especially when he needed to adjust to living in the 21st Century. Tony was there too, but he was more to the tech aspect and suggesting what Steve could check out. They made a list together, some of which he and Natasha did together, as Tony always found a reason to lock himself in the lab throwing himself into project after project. Oh Tony…
The Avengers are returning back, how do you feel about it?
Sam then brought the bird down and made swooping movements. So it looked like the giant bird wanted to attack the giraffe and the deer.
“You can date anyone, regardless of their gender, Tony,” Jarvis said. “But make sure they don’t hurt you.”
The others thought about it.
Tony chuckled and waved at Nat when she drove right beside him. Her hair was flying wildly and she waved back. She then overtook Tony’s car.
Baby Clint wasn’t looking at where he was running. He was going around the couch and getting away from Linda. So he was shocked when he found himself falling face first.
I hope you will enjoy this update.
“Stop feeling guilty man!” Rhodey said sounding exasperated. “If Steve himself needs you in Boston, then you need to go.”
“Sir, Ms. Potts is calling for you,” Jarvis informed him.
“Intruders smart enough to disable Tony’s AIs,” Natasha also suggested.
Who do you really think screamed at the first jump scare? :D
“Uh, no guys it’s fine. I’ll be here,” Tony walked to the shore and let the warm foamy water wash his legs.
Clint could not chew his food anymore. He was torn between feeling glad for Tony and feeling sad because of how much Tony was neglected. Natasha and Thor were just staring at Tony while Bruce let out a sigh. Steve gave Tony’s back a pat before picking up his cutlery. The others followed suit and soon, they completed their meals.
Peggy sighed.
As if on cue, there was a loud crash from one of the stores. Captain America jumped out of a broken window, with his shield held firmly in front of him. Black Panther and Ant Man landed beside Natasha and Tony.
“Fuck no!” Clint screamed this time. “Cut across! Go any way just do it!”
“So… are you okay, Tony?” Thor asked. “After last night, it is safe to say that perhaps you are avoiding Captain Rogers.”
Bucky was jumping up and down. Linda was carrying Natasha while Kayla was carrying Bruce, who were clapping enthusiastically. The rest of them were standing on the chairs, under the supervision of the girls. Tony was giggling away. While singing, Steve wanted to know, suddenly, how the adult Tony would have reacted to this. He just really wanted his teammates back. He wanted all of them to be happy in the house. He yearned for a better reunion.
“Let me introduce you to Bruce, Clint, Tony and Bucky,” Sam spoke. Wanda gasped while Natasha raised her eyebrows.
What do you think will happen in day 4? Let me know your thoughts in the comments! :)
All of them got out, except for Tony. He was shutting down the engines and the systems. He double checked the condition of his engines. Once the sound died down, he got out. He looked at the jet one last time, then pressed a button on a device which looked like a very small remote control. The back door shut, with a click.
“You’re not gonna argue,” Natasha smiled. “The strategies can wait. I’ll hand you over to the Captain, Tony.”
Tony talks to both Natasha and Clint. Also, we get a glimpse of Tony in his theater module class!!
“Have a safe journey back to New York,” Kayla said.
“Steve,” Sam placed his hand on Steve’s knee. “It will be alright.”
“Driving,” Tony replied while rubbing his eyes.
Steve’s face softened. He nodded his head, and both of them ended up walking to the car.
Tony took a few French toasts and pancakes. He dipped them into maple syrup and was immediately in bliss. Steve grinned at his boyfriend’s reaction. Bruce was in love with the crispy bacon strips, while Thor was happily eating as much as he could.
“Ugh I’m already missing kid Tony,” Clint interrupted. “At least he didn’t do the cost talks with us.”
It was a love lock - a padlock with romantic words written on it. Tony read the words that were written in permanent marker.
Thor managed to hit the shuttlecock back to Clint at ease. They were running around, hitting it back to each other. The game was going smoothly, until Thor decided that it was enough. He used the forehand smash technique, hard, taking Clint completely by surprise.
Tony tilted his head to the side, and let out a chuckle. “Aye aye Captain! But first, I need clothes.”
He pulled his hand back, shaking his head.
Another man, dressed up the same way started to chase Tony down the hallway. Tony let out a gut wrenching scream and ran to the elevator. But it was not working.
Steve had tears in his eyes reminiscing, although he was smiling at the way Tony was holding his pen. The team was so united then. Now it was trying to get back together, with so much of effort and difficulty.
After twenty minutes of waiting and dealing with all the attention he had received due to his presence, Tony made it back up to his office level. In the CEO’s office, there was a designated casual space where two black leather couches were, along with a coffee table. Tony decided to sit there and eat his lunch.
“Tony,” Thor set his burger down. “Only Steven can decide whether he wants you or not. If you have feelings for Steven, then you tell him. You cannot decide his love for you just because you think you are unworthy of it.”
Jarvis walked out of the room, passing by Steve, who was wiping his hair. Steve quickly slipped into his jeans and a round-neck shirt. He looked at Tony sprawled across the bed and smiled.
Tony gave him a sour look.
Happy reading everyone! :)
“Thanks, my girl,” Tony smiled. And then he realized what Friday had said. “Wait, did you say tantrums? How the… fuck it you’re right. I get angry like a hormonal teenager.”
“Yeah, I brought them in,” Tony spoke up while looking for that project of his. “Ah, there you go. Bucky, come here.”
“They won’t give up until their leader does,” Steve growled. “Team 3, you gotta find the stone
There was a flicker of emotion that crossed Maria’s face. It was as if the opening of an old wound caused her to flinch. She then pushed all of it away by putting a smile on her face. “Oh Anthony…” she sighed. Her left hand was caressing Tony’s right cheek. “That’s something you should never hang on to, son. Just forget it like as if, it was some sort of a worst nightmare.”
“DD’s right,” Bruce confirmed. “Tony is still with us. Anybody called S.H.I.E.L.D for medics?”
“I think we should,” Tony nodded his head. He took a quick sip from his milkshake and started to speak again. “Learn how to live flexibly, Steve!”
“Is Pepper in the office? I’d like to join her today.”
“Oh crap,” Clint whispered.
She was putting together the piece on the right part of the board, while Tony took the left. They were slowly forming an image of the Avengers. Steve lied down, chest flat, and just watched them in silence. Chippy got up and walked towards him. He settled down right beside Steve’s warm torso and curled up into a sleeping position.
“You think he got kidnapped?” Natasha asked. “I mean, he’s a pretty public figure by now. That’s one possible explanation.”
“So my worst fears came true huh,” Bruce said. He was standing behind Tony.
Baby Natasha was trying to touch his face. Both her little arms were stretching toward him. Tony smiled. He went closer to her.
Back in Tony’s and Steve’s room, the air reeked of sex. Steve was still slamming into his boyfriend. Both of them were moaning loudly, with Steve getting very close to his orgasm. He looked at Tony writhing under him. He leaned down and kissed his boyfriend. Tony kissed him back, letting out gasps when the feeling was too electrifying.
“I wasn’t the only one who saw that, right?” Clint asked. He looked very surprised.
“I didn’t know your hammer could do that,” Clint commented.
“There has been a complication!” Wanda was panting when she reached the backyard.
After an hour of playing hide-and-seek, literally, AIM gave up. Some scientists surrendered while others were forcefully taken into custody. S.H.I.E.L.D stepped in and took control of the investigation. They had obtained the weapon, and were gathering all the scientists around their security vans.
“Add anything further and I’ll leave right now,” Tony joked.
With that, Natasha walked away, with Jessica following her. Clint sighed and adjusted himself. He looked at his watch, eyes widening a little.
“But first, we need to go to the park of legacy,” Thor said cheerfully.
Tony thought Steve bought that crappy explanation because Steve was nodding his head, looking up at the Brooklyn Bridge.
Tony looked back up just in time to catch a Frost Giant running towards them. The Giant jumped up and was ready to punch the boy.
“Nat,” Steve started. “While you all got de-aged, the stone was activated. So the leader of the Frost Giants sent one of his kind to negotiate with us…” Steve went on to tell her the entire story. Her eyes widened at the recollection. She got angry because her teammates, her good friends were attacked at their most vulnerable state. Her hand automatically went to baby Tony’s cheek. She rubbed it softly and then ruffled his hair. Baby Tony leaned into her touch, which made her smile.
“Yeah,” Spidey said softly. “And I can kinda remember what he did and said when I got hit by that purple thing. I don’t think I can forget them.” His voice cracked at the end.
Tony choked on his own saliva and opened his eyes. He turned to face Steve, with both his eyebrows raised.
“Do you think you have won!?!” a rough voice shouted at them.
Everyone were staring in awe at the spread out field and huge mansion in front of them. Jarvis was smiling so much at their reaction.
“It was anything but that,” Tony pointed out. He slowly got down, wrapping the sheets around him. He walked towards the elevator.
All the shields broke and nearly everyone there fell down, including the Frost Giants. The buildings were still standing, but glass windows shattered, trees were uprooted and the street now had a big hole with the courtesy of Thor. A car had a small explosion that rocked that entire area. Doors from the buildings were completely annihilated. Thank God, the civilians were out of there.
“Thank you!” Black Widow said.
“Hey Cap,” Tony spoke up. “How does it feel living in a generation you don’t actually belong to?”
Tony frowned. “The thing in me is a virus?”
Two levels above the communal level, Thor was soundly asleep. Mjolnir was on the small coffee table in his room. It was vibrating, ready to take flight. The vibration became wilder, and the sound of uru hitting wood instantly woke Thor up. He rubbed his eyes, turning to look at Mjolnir.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m not sure,” Steve replied. He was busy whisking fours eggs in a bowl. “Who made that?”
Maria Stark helped Howard up. She forcefully dragged him away from there, slowly going down the stairs. Howard shrugged her off and proceeded to lock himself in his office.
“Yeah yeah I know,” Scott sighed.
“Tony,” Steve stepped forward. “That’s not how we do things. Put the leader down.”
“I can’t… can’t…” Tony tried to catch his breath. “I can’t believe both of you tried to swear my AI into silence.”
Wanda sat down on another loveseat, which was on the left of the room, with Vision. There was a long couch in the middle, where Rhodey, T’Challa, Scott, Bucky, Thor and Kayla were already sitting on. Sam was sitting on a bean bag chair beside Rhodey.
“I don’t see the mansion at all,” Clint yawned. He looked slightly better after the nap. “All I see is a road surrounded by trees.”
Tony looked at the wall clock in the cafe; the time was 4pm. He and Steve sat at one of the tables near the cashier, which had two menus for each patron, a small basket full of cutlery and napkins, and two glasses, ready to be filled up with water.
“What did you do to Tony?” Steve went straight to the point.
Everyone now knows about Tony’s situation. They didn’t know what to say; words of encouragement or some sad statement, they were unsure. What Kayla was sure of, was that baby Tony needed his own set of clothes and they needed more formula milk. So she left the house at around 9am to get the necessary things. Bruce had already ordered another cot.
Steve raised an eyebrow at him. “I spelled what you said. What does this have to do with me feeling things for Tony?”
“I didn’t invite myself here, Tony.” He clarified with a dangerously calm tone.
Clint was changing into his gear at the side of the jet. Everyone’s back was facing him. Natasha and Wanda were already dressed up. Bruce was preparing to Hulk out once the jet drops them off at the street. Bucky was thinking he was going to sit this one out. What can he do with just one arm? He closed his eyes for a moment.
There were streaks of lightning hitting Mjolnir now.
Thor slowly took his hammer away from Tony. He ruffled Tony’s hair. “Thank you.” Thor smiled.
The kids started to walk toward Sam. Sam raised his hands in surrender and walked backwards. Steve snorted at this.
“And science is winning,” Carol quipped as she placed her bag on the dining table. Jan huffed at that and went to the kitchen to get a drink.
Steve smiled as he pictured Peggy shielding Tony away from Howard. He wished he was there with her, shielding little Tony together.
Tony’s jaw twitched. He didn’t let go of the leader and his grip was crushing the leader’s neck. He was struggling to breathe. He tried kicking Tony, but he couldn’t even reach him.
Both of them helped Tony sit on the wheelchair. They walked him to the elevator, with Happy behind them.
The five of them below stood up once Tony and his mother started to walk down the stairs.
Great.
“I don’t know what to say, Strucker,” Tony stared at the man, who now seemed tired. Even Tony almost felt sorry for him but he had to remind himself that he was a super-villain hellbent on destroying New York using his invention. “Us humans are imperfect and we are going to lie at certain times in our lives.”
“Great,” Steve muttered to himself. “He is mad and I’ll never be able to open up to him.”
“Want to go back home?” Danny Rand suddenly asked. “Because we might get this.”
Jane instinctively clutched onto the papers, squeezing them. As a result, water oozed out of them, dropping onto the wooden floor.
Clint finds out who manipulated the pairing results while Tony puts Whitney in her place during his theater class.
When adult Tony woke up, he was more than surprised to find himself sprawled across Bruce’s lab. On a freaking gurney!!
“I think you should re-consider,” Bucky said quietly. “They need you there, Steve.” Bucky walked away. He was already asking the AI for the sniper rifles' location.
“Oh Tony,” she whispered. “I missed you!”
“See you, Tony,” Reed smiled as he cut off the feed.
“Ah, so it’s like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde personality,” Tony spoke to himself. He scanned through the S.H.I.E.L.D reports, and one particular information stood out. “Jarbis, remind me to ask Dr. Banner about-”
“Oh, come on Steve,” Tony said, gritting his teeth.
“You’d think that,” Steve said. “Of course you’d think that. That’s why you ran away that night, because you never wanted to tell me about your feelings. What if I never found out? Would you still have told me?”
“They should be here by now,” Natasha affirmed.
Tony quickly passed the pair of socks to Clint, and rallied around the rest of his friends.
Tony’s face reddened with embarrassment. “It was early morning. I went down to just examine it. I was still pretty half asleep so without thinking,I went to touch it.” He shrugged. Steve pursed his lips while Bruce exhaled loudly.
try. He was seated on the floor. “You’re worthy and you know it.”
